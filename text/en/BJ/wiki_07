<text>In mathematics, and more specifically in computer algebra, computational algebraic geometry, and computational commutative algebra, a Gröbner basis is a particular kind of generating set of an ideal in a polynomial ring over a field . A Gröbner basis allows many important properties of the ideal and the associated algebraic variety to be deduced easily, such as the dimension and the number of zeros when it is finite. Gröbner basis computation is one of the main practical tools for solving systems of polynomial equations and computing the images of algebraic varieties under projections or rational maps.

Gröbner basis computation can be seen as a multivariate, non-linear generalization of both Euclid&#x27;s algorithm for computing polynomial greatest common divisors, and
Gaussian elimination for linear systems.

Gröbner bases were introduced by Bruno Buchberger in his 1965 Ph.D. thesis, which also included an algorithm to compute them (Buchberger&#x27;s algorithm). He named them after his advisor Wolfgang Gröbner. In 2007, Buchberger received the Association for Computing Machinery&#x27;s Paris Kanellakis Theory and Practice Award for this work.
However, the Russian mathematician Nikolai Günther had introduced a similar notion in 1913, published in various Russian mathematical journals. These papers were largely ignored by the mathematical community until their rediscovery in 1987 by Bodo Renschuch &quot;et al.&quot; An analogous concept for multivariate power series was developed independently by Heisuke Hironaka in 1964, who named them standard bases. This term has been used by some authors to also denote Gröbner bases.

The theory of Gröbner bases has been extended by many authors in various directions. It has been generalized to other structures such as polynomials over principal ideal rings or polynomial rings, and also some classes of non-commutative rings and algebras, like Ore algebras.

== Tools ==

=== Polynomial ring ===

Gröbner bases are primarily defined for ideals in a polynomial ring formula_1 over a field . Although the theory works for any field, most Gröbner basis computations are done either when is the field of rationals or the integers modulo a prime number.

In the context of Gröbner bases, a nonzero polynomial in formula_1 is commonly represented as a sum formula_3 where the formula_4 are nonzero elements of , called &quot;coefficients&quot;, and the formula_5 are monomials (called &quot;power products&quot; by Buchberger and some of his followers) of the form formula_6 where the formula_7 are nonnegative integers. The vector formula_8 is called the &quot;exponent vector&quot; of the monomial. When the list formula_9 of the variables is fixed, the notation of monomials is often abbreviated as formula_10

Monomials are uniquely defined by their exponent vectors, and, when a monomial ordering (see below) is fixed, a polynomial is uniquely represented by the ordered list of the ordered pairs formed by an exponent vector and the corresponding coefficient. This representation of polynomials is especially efficient for Gröbner basis computation in computers, although it is less convenient for other computations such as polynomial factorization and polynomial greatest common divisor.

If formula_11 is a finite set of polynomials in the polynomial ring , the ideal generated by is the set of linear combinations of elements of with coefficients in ; that is the set of polynomials that can be written formula_12 with formula_13

=== Monomial ordering ===

All operations related to Gröbner bases require the choice of a total order on the monomials, with the following properties of compatibility with multiplication. For all monomials , , ,
# formula_14
# formula_15.
A total order satisfying these condition is sometimes called an &quot;admissible ordering&quot;.

These conditions imply that the order is a well-order, that is, every strictly decreasing sequence of monomials is finite.

Although Gröbner basis theory does not depend on a particular choice of an admissible monomial ordering, three monomial orderings are especially important for the applications:
* &quot;Lexicographical ordering&quot;, commonly called &quot;lex&quot; or &quot;plex&quot; (for pure lexical ordering).
* &quot;Total degree reverse lexicographical ordering&quot;, commonly called &quot;degrevlex&quot;.
* &quot;Elimination ordering&quot;, &quot;lexdeg&quot;.

Gröbner basis theory was initially introduced for the lexicographical ordering. It was soon realised that the Gröbner basis for degrevlex is almost always much easier to compute, and that it is almost always easier to compute a lex Gröbner basis by first computing the degrevlex basis and then using a &quot;change of ordering algorithm&quot;. When elimination is needed, degrevlex is not convenient; both lex and lexdeg may be used but, again, many computations are relatively easy with lexdeg and almost impossible with lex.

=== Basic operations ===

==== Leading term, coefficient and monomial ====

Once a monomial ordering is fixed, the terms of a polynomial (product of a monomial with its nonzero coefficient) are naturally ordered by decreasing monomials (for this order). This makes the representation of a polynomial as a sorted list of pairs coefficient–exponent vector a canonical representation of the polynomials (that is, two polynomials are equal if and only if they have the same representation).

The first (greatest) term of a polynomial for this ordering and the corresponding monomial and coefficient are respectively called the &quot;leading term&quot;, &quot;leading monomial&quot; and &quot;leading coefficient&quot; and denoted, in this article, and .

Most polynomial operations related to Gröbner bases involve the leading terms. So, the representation of polynomials as sorted lists make these operations particularly efficient (reading the first element of a list takes a constant time, independently of the length of the list).

==== Polynomial operations ====
The other polynomial operations involved in Gröbner basis computations are also compatible with the monomial ordering; that is, they can be performed without reordering the result:
* The addition of two polynomials consists in a merge of the two corresponding lists of terms, with a special treatment in the case of a conflict (that is, when the same monomial appears in the two polynomials).
* The multiplication of a polynomial by a scalar consists of multiplying each coefficient by this scalar, without any other change in the representation.
* The multiplication of a polynomial by a monomial consists of multiplying each monomial of the polynomial by . This does not change the term ordering by definition of a monomial ordering.

==== Divisibility of monomials ====

Let formula_16 and formula_17 be two monomials, with exponent vectors formula_18 and formula_19

One says that &quot;divides&quot; , or that is a &quot;multiple&quot; of , if formula_20 for every ; that is, if is componentwise not greater than . In this case, the quotient formula_21 is defined as formula_22 In other words, the exponent vector of formula_21 is the componentwise subtraction of the exponent vectors of and .

The &quot;greatest common divisor&quot; of and is the monomial formula_24 whose exponent vector is the componentwise minimum of and . The &quot;least common multiple&quot; is defined similarly with instead of .

One has
:formula_25

===Reduction===
The &quot;reduction&quot; of a polynomial by other polynomials with respect to a monomial ordering is central to Gröbner basis theory. It is a generalization of both row reduction occurring in Gaussian elimination and division steps of the 
Euclidean division of univariate polynomials. When completed as much as possible, it is sometimes called multivariate division although its result is not uniquely defined.

&quot;Lead-reduction&quot; is a special case of reduction that is easier to compute. It is fundamental for Gröbner basis computation, since general reduction is needed only at the end of a Gröbner basis computation, for getting a reduced Gröbner basis from a non-reduced one.

Let an admissible monomial ordering be fixed, to which refers every monomial comparison that will occur in this section.

A polynomial is &quot;lead-reducible&quot; by another polynomial if the leading monomial is a multiple of . The polynomial is &quot;reducible&quot; by if some monomial of is a multiple . (So, if is lead-reducible by , it is also reducible, but may be reducible without being lead-reducible.)

Suppose that is &quot;reducible&quot; by , and let be a term of such that the monomial is a multiple of . A &quot;one-step reduction&quot; of by consists of replacing by 
:formula_26

This operation removes the monomial from without changing the terms with a monomial greater than (for the monomial ordering). In particular, a &quot;one step lead-reduction&quot; of produces a polynomial all of whose monomials are smaller than .

Given a finite set of polynomials, one says that is &quot;reducible&quot; or &quot;lead-reducible&quot; by if it is reducible or lead-reducible, respectively, by at least one element of . In this case, a one-step reduction (resp. one-step lead-reduction) of by is any one-step reduction (resp. one-step lead-reduction) of by an element of .

The (complete) reduction (resp. lead-reduction) of by consists of iterating one-step reductions (respect. one-step lead reductions) until getting a polynomial that is irreducible (resp. lead-irreducible) by . It is sometimes called a &quot;normal form&quot; of by . In general this form is not uniquely defined because there are, in general, several elements of that can be used for reducing ; this non-uniqueness is the starting point of Gröbner basis theory.

The definition of the reduction shows immediately that, if is a normal form of by , one has
:formula_27
where is irreducible by and the formula_28 are polynomials such that formula_29 In the case of univariate polynomials, if consists of a single element , then is the remainder of the Euclidean division of by , and is the quotient. Moreover, the division algorithm is exactly the process of lead-reduction. For this reason, some authors use the term &quot;multivariate division&quot; instead of reduction.

==== Non uniqueness of reduction ====

In the example that follows, there are exactly two complete lead-reductions that produce two very different results. The fact that the results are irreducible (not only lead-irreducible) is specific to the example, although this is rather common with such small examples.

In this two variable example, the monomial ordering that is used is the lexicographic order with formula_30 and we consider the reduction of formula_31, by formula_32 with formula_33

For the first reduction step, either the first or the second term of may be reduced. However, the reduction of a term amounts to removing this term at the cost of adding new lower terms; if it is not the first reducible term that is reduced, it may occur that a further reduction adds a similar term, which must be reduced again. It is therefore always better to reduce first the largest (for the monomial order) reducible term; that is, in particular, to lead-reduce first until getting a lead-irreducible polynomial.

The leading term formula_34 of is reducible by formula_35 and not by formula_36 So the first reduction step consists of multiplying formula_35 by and adding the result to :
:formula_38

The leading term formula_39 of formula_40 is a multiple of the leading monomials of both formula_35 and formula_42 So, one has two choices for the second reduction step. If one chooses formula_42 one gets a polynomial that can be reduced again by formula_44
:formula_45
No further reduction is possible, so formula_46 is a complete reduction of .

One gets a different result with the other choice for the second step:
:formula_47
Again, the result formula_48 is irreducible, although only lead reductions were done.

In summary, the complete reduction of can result in either formula_49 or formula_50

It is for dealing with the problems set by this non-uniqueness that Buchberger introduced Gröbner bases and -polynomials. Intuitively, may be reduced to formula_51 This implies that formula_52 belongs to the ideal generated by . So, this ideal is not changed by adding formula_53 to , and this allows more reductions. In particular, formula_48 can be reduced to formula_46 by formula_53 and this restores the uniqueness of the reduced form.

Here Buchberger&#x27;s algorithm for Gröbner bases would begin by adding to the polynomial
:formula_57
This polynomial, called -polynomial by Buchberger, is the difference of the one-step reductions of the least common multiple formula_58 of the leading monomials of formula_35 and formula_60, by formula_60 and formula_35 respectively:
:formula_63.
In this example, one has formula_64 This does not complete Buchberger&#x27;s algorithm, as gives different results, when reduced by formula_60 or formula_66

=== &quot;S&quot;-polynomial ===
Given monomial ordering, the &quot;S-polynomial&quot; or &quot;critical pair&quot; of two polynomials and is the polynomial
:formula_67;
where denotes the least common multiple of the leading monomials of and .
Using the definition of formula_68, this translates to:
:formula_69
Using the property that relates the and the , the &quot;S&quot;-polynomial can also be written as:
:formula_70
where denotes the greatest common divisor of the leading monomials of and . 

As the monomials that are reducible by both and are exactly the multiples of , one can deal with all cases of non-uniqueness of the reduction by considering only the &quot;S&quot;-polynomials. This is a fundamental fact for Gröbner basis theory and all algorithms for computing them. 

For avoiding fractions when dealing with polynomials with integer coefficients, the &quot;S&quot; polynomial is often defined as
:formula_71
This does not changes anything to the theory since the two polynomials are associates.

==Definition==

Let formula_72 be a polynomial ring over a field . In this section, we suppose that an admissible monomial ordering has been fixed.

Let be a finite set of polynomials in that generates an ideal . The set is a Gröbner basis (with respect to the monomial ordering), or, more precisely, a Gröbner basis of if
# the ideal generated by the leading monomials of the polynomials in equals the ideal generated by the leading monomials of ,
or, equivalently,
There are many characterizing properties, which can each be taken as an equivalent definition of Gröbner bases. For conciseness, in the following list, the notation &quot;one-word/another word&quot; means that one can take either &quot;one-word&quot; or &quot;another word&quot; for having two different characterizations of Gröbner bases. All the following assertions are characterizations of Gröbner bases:
Counting the above definition, this provides 12 characterizations of Gröbner bases. The fact that so many characterizations are possible makes Gröbner bases very useful. For example, condition 3 provides an algorithm for testing ideal membership; condition 4 provides an algorithm for testing whether a set of polynomials is a Gröbner basis and forms the basis of Buchberger&#x27;s algorithm for computing Gröbner bases; conditions 5 and 6 allow computing in formula_73 in a way that is very similar to modular arithmetic.

===Existence===

For every admissible monomial ordering and every finite set of polynomials, there is a Gröbner basis that contains and generates the same ideal. Moreover, such a Gröbner basis may be computed with Buchberger&#x27;s algorithm.

This algorithm uses condition 4, and proceeds roughly as follows: for any two elements of , compute the complete reduction by of their &quot;S&quot;-polynomial, and add the result to if it is not zero; repeat this operation with the new elements of included until, eventually, all reductions produce zero. 

The algorithm terminates always because of Dickson&#x27;s lemma or because polynomial rings are Noetherian (Hilbert&#x27;s basis theorem). Condition 4 ensures that the result is a Gröbner basis, and the definitions of &quot;S&quot;-polynomials and reduction ensure that the generated ideal is not changed.

The above method is an algorithm for computing Gröbner bases; however, it is very inefficient. Many improvements of the original Buchberger&#x27;s algorithm, and several other algorithms have been proposed and implemented, which dramatically improve the efficiency. See , below.

===Reduced Gröbner bases ===

A Gröbner basis is if all leading monomials of its elements are irreducible by the other elements of the basis. Given a Gröbner basis of an ideal , one gets a minimal Gröbner basis of by removing the polynomials whose leading monomials are multiple of the leading monomial of another element of the Gröbner basis. However, if two polynomials of the basis have the same leading monomial, only one must be removed. So, every Gröbner basis contains a minimal Gröbner basis as a subset.

All minimal Gröbner bases of a given ideal (for a fixed monomial ordering) have the same number of elements, and the same leading monomials, and the non-minimal Gröbner bases have more elements than the minimal ones.

A Gröbner basis is if every polynomial in it is irreducible by the other elements of the basis, and has as leading coefficient. So, every reduced Gröbner basis is minimal, but a minimal Gröbner basis need not be reduced.

Given a Gröbner basis of an ideal , one gets a reduced Gröbner basis of by first removing the polynomials that are lead-reducible by other elements of the basis (for getting a minimal basis); then replacing each element of the basis by the result of the complete reduction by the other elements of the basis; and, finally, by dividing each element of the basis by its leading coefficient.

All reduced Gröbner bases of an ideal (for a fixed monomial ordering) are equal. It follows that two ideals are equal if and only if they have the same reduced Gröbner basis.

Sometimes, reduced Gröbner bases are defined without the condition on the leading coefficients. In this case, the uniqueness of reduced Gröbner bases is true only up to the multiplication of polynomials by a nonzero constant.

When working with polynomials over the field formula_74 of the rational numbers, it is useful to work only with polynomials with integer coefficients. In this case, the condition on the leading coefficients in the definition of a reduced basis may be replaced by the condition that all elements of the basis are primitive polynomials with integer coefficients, with positive leading coefficients. This restores the uniqueness of reduced bases.

=== Special cases ===

For every monomial ordering, the empty set of polynomials is the unique Gröbner basis of the zero ideal.

For every monomial ordering, a set of polynomials that contains a nonzero constant is a Gröbner basis of the unit ideal (the whole polynomial ring). Conversely, every Gröbner basis of the unit ideal contains a nonzero constant. The reduced Gröbner basis of the unit is formed by the single polynomial .

In the case of polynomials in a single variable, there is a unique admissible monomial ordering, the ordering by the degree. The minimal Gröbner bases are the singletons consisting of a single polynomial. The reduced Gröbner bases are the monic polynomials.

== Example and counterexample ==
Let formula_75 be the ring of bivariate polynomials with rational coefficients and consider the ideal formula_76 generated by the polynomials

:formula_77,
:formula_78.

By reducing by , one obtains a new polynomial such that formula_79
:formula_80

None of and is reducible by the other, but is reducible by , which gives another polynomial in :
:formula_81

Under lexicographic ordering with formula_82 we have
:

As and belong to , and none of them is reducible by the others, none of formula_83 formula_84 and formula_85 is a Gröbner basis of .

On the other hand, is a Gröbner basis of , since the S-polynomials
:formula_86
can be reduced to zero by and .

The method that has been used here for finding and , and proving that is a Gröbner basis is a direct application of Buchberger&#x27;s algorithm. So, it can be applied mechanically to any similar example, although, in general, there are many polynomials and S-polynomials to consider, and the computation is generally too large for being done without a computer.

== Properties and applications of Gröbner bases ==
Unless explicitly stated, all the results that follow are true for any monomial ordering (see that article for the definitions of the different orders that are mentioned below).

It is a common misconception that the lexicographical order is needed for some of these results. On the contrary, the lexicographical order is, almost always, the most difficult to compute, and using it makes impractical many computations that are relatively easy with graded reverse lexicographic order (grevlex), or, when elimination is needed, the elimination order (lexdeg) which restricts to grevlex on each block of variables.

===Equality of ideals===

Reduced Gröbner bases are &quot;unique&quot; for any given ideal and any monomial ordering. Thus two ideals are equal if and only if they have the same (reduced) Gröbner basis (usually a Gröbner basis software always produces reduced Gröbner bases).

===Membership and inclusion of ideals===

The reduction of a polynomial &quot;f&quot; by the Gröbner basis &quot;G&quot; of an ideal yields 0 if and only if &quot;f&quot; is in . This allows to test the membership of an element in an ideal. Another method consists in verifying that the Gröbner basis of &quot;G&quot;∪{&quot;f&quot;} is equal to &quot;G&quot;.

To test if the ideal generated by &quot;f&quot;1, ..., &quot;f&quot;&quot;k&quot; is contained in the ideal , it suffices to test that every is in . One may also test the equality of the reduced Gröbner bases of and ∪ {&quot;f&quot;1, ...,&quot;f&quot;&quot;k&quot;}.

=== Solutions of a system of algebraic equations ===

Any set of polynomials may be viewed as a system of polynomial equations by equating the polynomials to zero. The set of the solutions of such a system depends only on the generated ideal, and, therefore does not change when the given generating set is replaced by the Gröbner basis, for any ordering, of the generated ideal. Such a solution, with coordinates in an algebraically closed field containing the coefficients of the polynomials, is called a &quot;zero of the ideal&quot;. In the usual case of rational coefficients, this algebraically closed field is chosen as the complex field.

An ideal does not have any zero (the system of equations is inconsistent) if and only if 1 belongs to the ideal (this is Hilbert&#x27;s Nullstellensatz), or, equivalently, if its Gröbner basis (for any monomial ordering) contains 1, or, also, if the corresponding reduced Gröbner basis is [1].

Given the Gröbner basis &quot;G&quot; of an ideal &quot;I&quot;, it has only a finite number of zeros, if and only if, for each variable &quot;x&quot;, &quot;G&quot; contains a polynomial with a leading monomial that is a power of &quot;x&quot; (without any other variable appearing in the leading term). If this is the case, then the number of zeros, counted with multiplicity, is equal to the number of monomials that are not multiples of any leading monomial of &quot;G&quot;. This number is called the &quot;degree&quot; of the ideal.

When the number of zeros is finite, the Gröbner basis for a lexicographical monomial ordering provides, theoretically, a solution: the first coordinate of a solution is a root of the greatest common divisor of polynomials of the basis that depend only on the first variable. After substituting this root in the basis, the second coordinate of this solution is a root of the greatest common divisor of the resulting polynomials that depend only on the second variable, and so on. This solving process is only theoretical, because it implies GCD computation and root-finding of polynomials with approximate coefficients, which are not practicable because of numeric instability. Therefore, other methods have been developed to solve polynomial systems through Gröbner bases (see System of polynomial equations for more details).

=== Dimension, degree and Hilbert series ===
The dimension of an ideal &quot;I&quot; in a polynomial ring &quot;R&quot; is the Krull dimension of the ring &quot;R&quot;/&quot;I&quot; and is equal to the dimension of the algebraic set of the zeros of &quot;I&quot;. It is also equal to number of hyperplanes in general position which are needed to have an intersection with the algebraic set, which is a finite number of points. The degree of the ideal and of its associated algebraic set is the number of points of this finite intersection, counted with multiplicity. In particular, the degree of a hypersurface is equal to the degree of its definition polynomial.

Both degree and dimension depend only on the set of the leading monomials of the Gröbner basis of the ideal for any monomial ordering.

The dimension is the maximal size of a subset &quot;S&quot; of the variables such that there is no leading monomial depending only on the variables in &quot;S&quot;. Thus, if the ideal has dimension 0, then for each variable &quot;x&quot; there is a leading monomial in the Gröbner basis that is a power of &quot;x&quot;.

Both dimension and degree may be deduced from the Hilbert series of the ideal, which is the series formula_87, where formula_88 is the number of monomials of degree &quot;i&quot; that are not multiple of any leading monomial in the Gröbner basis. The Hilbert series may be summed into a rational fraction
:formula_89
where &quot;d&quot; is the dimension of the ideal and formula_90 is a polynomial such that formula_91 is the degree of the ideal.

The dimension and the degree do not depend on the choice of a monomial ordering, although the Hilbert series and the polynomial formula_90 change with changes of the monomial ordering.

Most computer algebra systems that provide functions to compute Gröbner bases provide also functions for computing the Hilbert series, and thus also the dimension and the degree.

=== Elimination ===

The computation of Gröbner bases for an &quot;elimination&quot; monomial ordering allows computational elimination theory. This is based on the following theorem.

Consider a polynomial ring formula_93 in which the variables are split into two subsets &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot;. Let us also choose an elimination monomial ordering &quot;eliminating&quot; &quot;X&quot;, that is a monomial ordering for which two monomials are compared by comparing first the &quot;X&quot;-parts, and, in case of equality only, considering the &quot;Y&quot;-parts. This implies that a monomial containing an &quot;X&quot;-variable is greater than every monomial independent of &quot;X&quot;.
If &quot;G&quot; is a Gröbner basis of an ideal &quot;I&quot; for this monomial ordering, then formula_94 is a Gröbner basis of formula_95 (this ideal is often called the &quot;elimination ideal&quot;). Moreover, formula_94 consists exactly of the polynomials of whose leading terms belong to (this makes the computation of formula_94 very easy, as only the leading monomials need to be checked).

This &quot;elimination property&quot; has many applications, some described in the next sections.

Another application, in algebraic geometry, is that &quot;elimination&quot; realizes the geometric operation of projection of an affine algebraic set into a subspace of the ambient space: with above notation, the (Zariski closure of) the projection of the algebraic set defined by the ideal &quot;I&quot; into the &quot;Y&quot;-subspace is defined by the ideal formula_98

The lexicographical ordering such that formula_99 is an elimination ordering for every partition formula_100 Thus a Gröbner basis for this ordering carries much more information than usually necessary. This may explain why Gröbner bases for the lexicographical ordering are usually the most difficult to compute.

=== Intersecting ideals ===

If and are two ideals generated respectively by {&quot;f&quot;1, ..., &quot;f&quot;&quot;m&quot;} and {&quot;g&quot;1, ..., &quot;g&quot;&quot;k&quot;}, then a single Gröbner basis computation produces a Gröbner basis of their intersection . For this, one introduces a new indeterminate &quot;t&quot;, and one uses an elimination ordering such that the first block contains only &quot;t&quot; and the other block contains all the other variables (this means that a monomial containing &quot;t&quot; is greater than every monomial that does not contain &quot;t&quot;). With this monomial ordering, a Gröbner basis of consists in the polynomials that do not contain &quot;t&quot;, in the Gröbner basis of the ideal
:formula_101
In other words, is obtained by &quot;eliminating&quot; &quot;t&quot; in &quot;K&quot;.
This may be proven by observing that the ideal &quot;K&quot; consists of the polynomials formula_102 such that formula_103 and formula_104. Such a polynomial is independent of &quot;t&quot; if and only if , which means that formula_105

=== Implicitization of a rational curve ===

A rational curve is an algebraic curve that has a set of parametric equations of the form

:formula_106
where formula_107 and formula_108 are univariate polynomials for 1 ≤ &quot;i&quot; ≤ &quot;n&quot;. One may (and will) suppose that formula_107 and formula_108 are coprime (they have no non-constant common factors).

Implicitization consists in computing the implicit equations of such a curve. In case of &quot;n&quot; = 2, that is for plane curves, this may be computed with the resultant. The implicit equation is the following resultant:
:formula_111

Elimination with Gröbner bases allows to implicitize for any value of &quot;n&quot;, simply by eliminating &quot;t&quot; in the ideal
formula_112
If &quot;n&quot; = 2, the result is the same as with the resultant, if the map formula_113 is injective for almost every &quot;t&quot;. In the other case, the resultant is a power of the result of the elimination.

=== Saturation ===
When modeling a problem by polynomial equations, it is often assumed that some quantities are non-zero, so as to avoid degenerate cases. For example, when dealing with triangles, many properties become false if the triangle degenerates to a line segment, i.e. the length of one side is equal to the sum of the lengths of the other sides. In such situations, one cannot deduce relevant information from the polynomial system unless the degenerate solutions are ignored. More precisely, the system of equations defines an algebraic set which may have several irreducible components, and one must remove the components on which the degeneracy conditions are everywhere zero.

This is done by &quot;saturating&quot; the equations by the degeneracy conditions, which may be done via the elimination property of Gröbner bases.

==== Definition of the saturation ====
The localization of a ring consists in adjoining to it the formal inverses of some elements. This section concerns only the case of a single element, or equivalently a finite number of elements (adjoining the inverses of several elements is equivalent to adjoining the inverse of their product). The &quot;localization&quot; of a ring &quot;R&quot; by an element &quot;f&quot; is the ring formula_114 where &quot;t&quot; is a new indeterminate representing the inverse of &quot;f&quot;. The &quot;localization&quot; of an ideal of &quot;R&quot; is the ideal formula_115 of formula_116 When &quot;R&quot; is a polynomial ring, computing in formula_117 is not efficient because of the need to manage the denominators. Therefore, localization is usually replaced by the operation of &quot;saturation&quot;.

The with respect to &quot;f&quot; of an ideal in &quot;R&quot; is the inverse image of formula_118 under the canonical map from &quot;R&quot; to formula_116 It is the ideal formula_120 consisting in all elements of &quot;R&quot; whose product with some power of &quot;f&quot; belongs to .

If is the ideal generated by and 1−&quot;ft&quot; in &quot;R&quot;[&quot;t&quot;], then formula_121 It follows that, if &quot;R&quot; is a polynomial ring, a Gröbner basis computation eliminating &quot;t&quot; produces a Gröbner basis of the saturation of an ideal by a polynomial.

The important property of the saturation, which ensures that it removes from the algebraic set defined by the ideal the irreducible components on which the polynomial &quot;f&quot; is zero, is the following: &quot;The primary decomposition of&quot; formula_122 &quot;consists of the components of the primary decomposition of I that do not contain any power of f&quot;.

==== Computation of the saturation ====
A Gröbner basis of the saturation by &quot;f&quot; of a polynomial ideal generated by a finite set of polynomials &quot;F&quot;, may be obtained by eliminating &quot;t&quot; in formula_123 that is by keeping the polynomials independent of &quot;t&quot; in the Gröbner basis of formula_124 for an elimination ordering eliminating &quot;t&quot;.

Instead of using &quot;F&quot;, one may also start from a Gröbner basis of &quot;F&quot;. Which method is most efficient depends on the problem. However, if the saturation does not remove any component, that is if the ideal is equal to its saturated ideal, computing first the Gröbner basis of &quot;F&quot; is usually faster. On the other hand, if the saturation removes some components, the direct computation may be dramatically faster.

If one wants to saturate with respect to several polynomials formula_125 or with respect to a single polynomial which is a product formula_126 there are three ways to proceed which give the same result but may have very different computation times (it depends on the problem which is the most efficient).
* Saturating by formula_127 in a single Gröbner basis computation.
* Saturating by formula_128 then saturating the result by formula_129 and so on.
* Adding to &quot;F&quot; or to its Gröbner basis the polynomials formula_130 and eliminating the formula_131 in a single Gröbner basis computation.

=== Effective Nullstellensatz ===

Hilbert&#x27;s Nullstellensatz has two versions. The first one asserts that a set of polynomials has no common zeros over an algebraic closure of the field of the coefficients, if and only if 1 belongs to the generated ideal. This is easily tested with a Gröbner basis computation, because 1 belongs to an ideal if and only if 1 belongs to the Gröbner basis of the ideal, for any monomial ordering.

The second version asserts that the set of common zeros (in an algebraic closure of the field of the coefficients) of an ideal is contained in the hypersurface of the zeros of a polynomial &quot;f&quot;, if and only if a power of &quot;f&quot; belongs to the ideal. This may be tested by saturating the ideal by &quot;f&quot;; in fact, a power of &quot;f&quot; belongs to the ideal if and only if the saturation by &quot;f&quot; provides a Gröbner basis containing 1.

===Implicitization in higher dimension===
By definition, an affine rational variety of dimension &quot;k&quot; may be described by parametric equations of the form
:formula_132
where formula_133 are &quot;n&quot;+1 polynomials in the &quot;k&quot; variables (parameters of the parameterization) formula_134 Thus the parameters formula_135 and the coordinates formula_136 of the points of the variety are zeros of the ideal
:formula_137

One could guess that it suffices to eliminate the parameters to obtain the implicit equations of the variety, as it has been done in the case of curves. Unfortunately this is not always the case. If the formula_138 have a common zero (sometimes called &quot;base point&quot;), every irreducible component of the non-empty algebraic set defined by the formula_138 is an irreducible component of the algebraic set defined by &quot;I&quot;. It follows that, in this case, the direct elimination of the formula_131 provides an empty set of polynomials.

Therefore, if &quot;k&quot;&gt;1, two Gröbner basis computations are needed to implicitize:
# Saturate formula_141 by formula_142 to get a Gröbner basis formula_143
# Eliminate the formula_131 from formula_143 to get a Gröbner basis of the ideal (of the implicit equations) of the variety.

== Algorithms and implementations ==
Buchberger&#x27;s algorithm is the oldest algorithm for computing Gröbner bases. It has been devised by Bruno Buchberger together with the Gröbner basis theory. It is straightforward to implement, but it appeared soon that raw implementations can solve only trivial problems. The main issues are the following ones:
# Even when the resulting Gröbner basis is small, the intermediate polynomials can be huge. It results that most of the computing time may be spent in memory management. So, specialized memory management algorithms may be a fundamental part of an efficient implementation.
# The integers occurring during a computation may be sufficiently large for making fast multiplication algorithms and multimodular arithmetic useful. For this reason, most optimized implementations use the GMPlibrary. Also, modular arithmetic, Chinese remainder theorem and Hensel lifting are used in optimized implementations
# The choice of the S-polynomials to reduce and of the polynomials used for reducing them is devoted to heuristics. As in many computational problems, heuristics cannot detect most hidden simplifications, and if heuristic choices are avoided, one may get a dramatic improvement of the algorithm efficiency.
# In most cases most S-polynomials that are computed are reduced to zero; that is, most computing time is spent to compute zero.
# The monomial ordering that is most often needed for the applications (pure lexicographic) is not the ordering that leads to the easiest computation, generally the ordering &quot;degrevlex&quot;.

For solving 3. many improvements, variants and heuristics have been proposed before the introduction of F4 and F5 algorithms by Jean-Charles Faugère. As these algorithms are designed for integer coefficients or with coefficients in the integers modulo a prime number, Buchberger&#x27;s algorithm remains useful for more general coefficients.

Roughly speaking, F4 algorithm solves 3. by replacing many S-polynomial reductions by the row reduction of a single large matrix for which advanced methods of linear algebra can be used. This solves partially issue 4., as reductions to zero in Buchberger&#x27;s algorithm correspond to relations between rows of the matrix to be reduced, and the zero rows of the reduced matrix correspond to a basis of the vector space of these relations.

F5 algorithm improves F4 by introducing a criterion that allows reducing the size of the matrices to be reduced. This criterion is almost optimal, since the matrices to be reduced have full rank in sufficiently regular cases (in particular, when the input polynomials form a regular sequence). Tuning F5 for a general use is difficult, since its performances depend on an order on the input polynomials and a balance between the incrementation of the working polynomial degree and of the number of the input polynomials that are considered. To date (2022), there is no distributed implementation that is significantly more efficient than F4, but, over modular integers F5 has been used successfully for several cryptographic challenges; for example, for breaking HFE challenge.

Issue 5. has been solved by the discovery of basis conversion algorithms that start from the Gröbner basis for one monomial ordering for computing a Gröbner basis for another monomial ordering. FGLM algorithm is such a basis conversion algorithm that works only in the zero-dimensional case (where the polynomials have a finite number of complex common zeros) and has a polynomial complexity in the number of common zeros. A basis conversion algorithm that works is the general case is the &quot;Gröbner walk algorithm&quot;. In its original form, FGLM may be the critical step for solving systems of polynomial equations because FGML does not take into account the sparsity of involved matrices. This has been fixed by the introduction of &quot;sparse FGLM algorithms&quot;.

Most general-purpose computer algebra systems have implementations of one or several algorithms for Gröbner bases, often also embedded in other functions, such as for solving systems of polynomial equations or for simplifying trigonometric functions; this is the case, for example, of CoCoA, GAP, Macaulay 2, Magma, Maple, Mathematica, SINGULAR, SageMath and SymPy. When F4 is available, it is generally much more efficient than Buchberger&#x27;s algorithm. The implementation techniques and algorithmic variants are not always documented, although they may have a dramatic effect on efficiency.

Implementations of F4 and (sparse)-FGLM are included in the library &quot;Msolve&quot;. Beside Gröbner algorithms, Msolve contains fast algorithms for real-root isolation, and combines all these functions in an algorithm for the real solutions of systems of polynomial equations that outperforms dramatically the other software for this problem (Maple and Magma). Msolve is available on GitHub, and is interfaced with Julia, Maple and SageMath; this means that Msolve can be used directly from within these software environments.

== Complexity ==
The complexity of the Gröbner basis computations is commonly evaluated in term of the number of variables and the maximal degree of the input polynomials.

In the worst case, the main parameter of the complexity is the maximal degree of the elements of the resulting reduced Gröbner basis. More precisely, if the Gröbner basis contains an element of a large degree , this element may contain formula_146 nonzero terms whose computation requires a time of formula_147 On the other hand, if all polynomials in the reduced Gröbner basis a homogeneous ideal have a degree of at most , the Gröbner basis can be computed by linear algebra on the vector space of polynomials of degree less than , which has a dimension formula_148 So, the complexity of this computation is formula_149

The worst-case complexity of a Gröbner basis computation is doubly exponential in . More precisely, the complexity is upper bounded by a polynomial in formula_150 Using little o notation, it is therefore bounded by formula_151 On the other hand, examples have been given of reduced Gröbner bases containing polynomials of degree formula_152
or containing formula_153 elements. As every algorithm for computing a Gröbner basis must write its result, this provides a lower bound of the complexity.

Gröbner basis is EXPSPACE-complete.

== Generalizations ==
The concept and algorithms of Gröbner bases have been generalized to submodules of free modules over a polynomial ring. In fact, if is a free module over a ring , then one may consider the direct sum formula_154 as a ring by defining the product of two elements of to be . This ring may be identified with formula_155, where formula_156 is a basis of &quot;L&quot;. This allows identifying a submodule of generated by formula_157 with the ideal of formula_158 generated by formula_157 and the products formula_160, formula_161. If is a polynomial ring, this reduces the theory and the algorithms of Gröbner bases of modules to the theory and the algorithms of Gröbner bases of ideals.

The concept and algorithms of Gröbner bases have also been generalized to ideals over various rings, commutative or not, like polynomial rings over a principal ideal ring or Weyl algebras.

==Areas of applications==

===Error-Correcting Codes===
Gröbner basis has been applied in the theory of error-correcting codes for algebraic decoding. By using Gröbner basis computation on various forms of error-correcting equations, decoding methods were developed for correcting errors of cyclic codes, affine variety codes, algebraic-geometric codes and even general linear block codes. Applying Gröbner basis in algebraic decoding is still a research area of channel coding theory.

<doc id="357331" wikidata="Q943329" url="?curid=357331" title="Common nighthawk">
<text>The common nighthawk or bullbat (Chordeiles minor) is a medium-sized crepuscular or nocturnal bird of the Americas within the nightjar (Caprimulgidae) family, whose presence and identity are best revealed by its vocalization. Typically dark (gray, black and brown), displaying cryptic colouration and intricate patterns, this bird is difficult to spot with the naked eye during the day. This bird is most conspicuous when in its buoyant and erratic flight. The most remarkable feature of this aerial insectivore is its small beak that belies the massiveness of its mouth. Some claim appearance similarities to owls. With its horizontal stance and short legs, the common nighthawk does not travel frequently on the ground, instead preferring to perch horizontally, parallel to branches, on posts, on the ground or on a roof. The males of this species may roost together but the bird is primarily solitary. The common nighthawk shows variability in territory size.

This caprimulgid has a large, flattened head with large eyes; facially it lacks rictal bristles. The common nighthawk has long slender wings that at rest extend beyond a notched tail. There is noticeable barring on the sides and abdomen, also white wing-patches.

The common nighthawk measures long, displays a wing span of weighs , and has a life span of 4 to 5 years.

==Names and etymology==

The genus name &quot;Chordeiles&quot; is from Ancient Greek &quot;khoreia&quot;, a dance with music, and &quot;deile&quot;, &quot;evening&quot;. The specific &quot;minor&quot; is Latin for &quot;smaller&quot;.

The term &quot;nighthawk&quot;, first recorded in the King James Bible version of 1611, was originally a local name in England for the European nightjar. Its use in the Americas referring to members of the genus &quot;Chordeiles&quot; and related genera was first recorded in 1778.

The common nighthawk is sometimes called a &quot;bull-bat&quot;, due to its perceived &quot;bat-like&quot; flight, and the &quot;bull-like&quot; boom made by its wings as it pulls from a dive.

They, in addition to other nightjars, are also sometimes called &quot;bugeaters&quot;, for their insectivore diet. The common nighthawk is likely the reason that Nebraska&#x27;s state nickname was once the &quot;Bugeater State&quot;, and its people were known as &quot;bugeaters&quot;. The Nebraska Cornhuskers college athletic teams were also briefly known the Bugeaters, before adopting their current name, which was also adopted by the state as a whole. A semi-professional soccer team in Nebraska, Nebraska Bugeaters FC, now uses the moniker.

==Taxonomy==
Within the family Caprimulgidae, the subfamily Chordeilinae (nighthawks) are limited to the New World and are distinguished from the subfamily Caprimulginae, by the lack of rictal bristles.

The American Ornithologists&#x27; Union treated the smaller Antillean nighthawk as conspecific with the common nighthawk until 1982.

Up until the early 19th century, the common nighthawk and the whip-poor-will were thought to be one species. The latter&#x27;s call was explained as the nocturnal expression of the common nighthawk. Alexander Wilson, &quot;The Father of American Ornithology&quot;, correctly made the differentiation between the two species.

===Subspecies===
There are 9 currently recognized subspecies:
* &quot;C. m. panamensis&quot; – : breeds on the Pacific slope of Panama and north west Costa Rica. It is noted to depart Panama during winter for points in South America
* &quot;C. m. neotropicalis&quot; – : breeds in south Mexico and Honduras
* &quot;C. m. howelli&quot; – : breeds in west central United States (north Texas, west Oklahoma, and Kansas to east Colorado, less typical form in central Colorado, north east Utah and Wyoming). It is darker than &quot;sennetti&quot; and paler and less cinnamon than &quot;henryi&quot;.
* &quot;C. m. hesperis&quot; – : breeds in south west Canada (British Columbia and Alberta), the western interior of United States (Washington, Montana, Nevada, interior California, Utah, extreme north Colorado, west Wyoming). It is darker than &quot;sennetti&quot; and paler and less cinnamon than &quot;henryi&quot;.
* &quot;C. m. aserriensis&quot; – : breeds from south central Texas to north Mexico. It is darker than &quot;sennetti&quot; and paler and less cinnamon than &quot;henryi&quot;.
* &quot;C. m. chapmani&quot; – : breeds from southeast Kansas to east North Carolina and southwards to south east Texas and south Florida. It is the darkest of the subspecies.
* &quot;C. m. sennetti&quot; – : breeds in the north Great Plains: east Montana, south Saskatchewan, Manitoba, southwards to North Dakota, Minnesota and Iowa. It is the palest of the subspecies.
* &quot;C. m. henryi&quot; – : breeds from south east Utah and south west Colorado through mountains of west Texas, Arizona and New Mexico (less north east) to east Sonora, Chihuahua, and Durango. It is unique with ochraceous to deep cinnamon feather edges on upperparts.
* &quot;C. m. minor&quot; – : breeds from south east Alaska to Vancouver Island, British Columbia, Canada, and south Canada/northern United States (Minnesota, Indiana) to Virginia, North Carolina, Georgia and Oklahoma. Considered by some as the darkest subspecies.

===History===
This species is recorded as widespread during the Late Pleistocene, from Virginia to California and from Wyoming to Texas.

In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, because their name contained the word &quot;hawk&quot;, they had habits of diurnal insect hunting, and they travelled in migrating flocks, they were hunted for sport and nourishment and because they were seen as predators.

===Field identification===

The common nighthawk is distinguished from other caprimulguids by its forked tail (includes a white bar in males); its long, unbarred, pointed wings with distinctive white patches; its lack of rictal bristles, and the key identifier – their unmistakable calls. These birds range from in total length and from in wingspan. Body mass can vary from . Among standard measurements, the wing chord is , the tail is , the bill is and the tarsus is .

The common nighthawk resembles both the Antillean nighthawk and the lesser nighthawk and occurs at least seasonally in the entire North American range of both of these species. The lesser nighthawk is a smaller bird and displays more buffy on the undertail coverts, where the common nighthawk shows white. Common nighthawks and Antillean nighthawks exhibit entirely dark on the basal portion of the primary feathers, whereas lesser nighthawks have bands of buffy spots. Common and Antillean nighthawks have a longer outermost primary conveying a pointier wing tip than the lesser nighthawk. The common nighthawk forages higher above ground than the lesser nighthawk and has a different call. The only reliable way to distinguish Antillean nighthawk without disturbance is also by the differences in their calls. Visually, they may only be distinguished as different from the common nighthawk once in the hand. Subtle differences are reported to be a challenge in field identification.

==Habitat and distribution==
The common nighthawk may be found in forests, desert, savannahs, beach and desert scrub, cities, and prairies, at elevations of sea level or below to . Nighthawks prefer to nest in edge and early successional habitats, making them one of only a handful of birds which will live and hunt in burned or clearcut patches of forest. The common nighthawk is drawn into urban built-up areas by insects.

The common nighthawk is the only nighthawk occurring over the majority of northern North America.

Food availability is likely a key factor in determining which and when areas are suitable for habitation. The common nighthawk is not well adapted to survive in poor conditions, specifically low food availability. Therefore, a constant food supply consistent with warmer temperatures is a driving force for migration and ultimately survival.

It is thought that the bird is not able to enter torpor, although recent evidence suggests it does.

===Migration===
During migration, common nighthawks may travel . They migrate by day or night in loose flocks, frequently numbering in the thousands; flocks have not been observed with a visible leader. The enormous distance travelled between breeding grounds and wintering range is one of the North America&#x27;s longer migrations. The northbound journey commences at the end of February and the birds reach destinations as late as mid-June. The southbound migration commences mid-July and reaches a close in early October.
While migrating, these birds have been reported travelling through middle America, Florida, the West Indies, Cuba, the Caribbean and Bermuda, finally completing their journey in the wintering grounds of South America, primarily Argentina.

As aerial insectivores, the migrants will feed en route, congregating to hunt in marshes, rivers and on lakeshores. In Manitoba and Ontario, Canada, it is reported that during migration the nighthawks are seen most commonly in the late afternoon, into the evening, with a burst of sunset feeding activities.

Additionally, it has been noted that during migration the birds may fly closer to the ground than normal; possibly foraging for insects. There is speculation that feeding also occurs at higher altitudes.

The common nighthawk winters in southern South America, but distribution in this range is poorly known due to difficulties in distinguishing the bird from the lesser nighthawk and in differentiating between migrants and overwintering birds. In some South and Central American countries, a lack of study has led to restricted and incomplete records of the bird. Records do support wintering in Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia, Brazil, Paraguay, Uruguay and Argentina.

==Molt==
In the common nighthawk, all bodily plumage and rectrices are replaced in the post-juvenile molt. This moult commences in September at the breeding grounds; the majority of the body plumage is replaced but wing-coverts and rectrices are not completed until January–February, once the bird arrives at the wintering grounds. There is no other molt prior to the annual molt of the adult. Common nighthawk adults have a complete molt that occurs mostly or completely on wintering grounds and is not completed until January or February.

==Behavior==

===Vocalization===
There are no differences between the calls and song of the common nighthawk. The most conspicuous vocalization is a nasal &quot;peent&quot; or &quot;beernt&quot; during flight. Peak vocalizations are reported 30 to 45 minutes after sunset. 

A croaking &quot;auk auk auk&quot; is vocalized by males while in the presence of a female during courtship. Another courtship sound, thought to be made solely by the males, is the boom, created by air rushing through the primaries after a quick downward flex of the wings during a daytime dive.

In defense of their nests, the females make a rasping sound, and males clap their wings together. Strongly territorial males will perform dives against fledglings, females, and intruders such as humans or raccoons.

===Feeding and diet===
Frequent flyers, the long-winged common nighthawk hunts on the wing for extended periods at high altitudes or in open areas. Crepuscular, flying insects are its preferred food source. The hunt ends as dusk becomes night, and resumes when night becomes dawn. Nighttime feeding (in complete darkness) is rare, even on evenings with a full moon. The bird displays opportunistic feeding tendencies, although it may be able to fine-tune its meal choice in the moments before capture. Common nighthawks have been shown to prefer eating Coleopterids (beetles) and Hymenopterids (bees, ants, and wasps), seeking these insects out in their habitats. While the most common type of insects in their diets are Lepidopterans (butterflies and moths), they actively avoid eating Dipterids (flies).

Vision is presumed to be the main detection sense; no evidence exists to support the use of echolocation. The birds have been observed to converge on artificial light sources in an effort to forage for insects enticed by the light. The average flight speed of common nighthawks is .

===Drinking===
The common nighthawk was observed to drink on its winter range by flying extremely low over the surface of the water.

===Waste excretion===
The common nighthawk is recognized to discharge feces around nest and roosting positions. The bird will sporadically defecate in flight. The defecation is pungent.

===Reproduction and nesting===
The common nighthawk breeds during the period of mid-March to early October. It most commonly has only one brood per season, however sometimes a second brood is produced. The bird is assumed to breed every year. Reuse of nests by females in subsequent years has been reported. A monogamous habit has also recently been confirmed.

Courting and mate selection occur partially in flight. The male dives and booms (see Vocalization) in an effort to garner female attention; the female may be in flight herself or stationary on the ground.

Copulation occurs when the pair settles on the ground together; the male with his rocking body, widespread tail wagging and bulging throat expresses guttural croaking sounds. This display by the male is performed repeatedly until copulation.

The preferred breeding/nesting habitat is in forested regions with expansive rocky outcrops, in clearings, in burned areas or in small patches of sandy gravel. The eggs are not laid in a nest, but on bare rock, gravel, or sometimes a living substrate such as lichen. Least popular are breeding sites in agricultural settings. As displayed in the latter portion of the 20th century, urban breeding is in decline. If urban breeding sites do occur, they are observed on flat gravel rooftops.

It is a solitary nester, putting great distances between itself and other pairs of the same species, but a nest would more commonly occur in closer proximity to other species of birds.

Females choose the nest site and are the primary incubators of the eggs; males will incubate occasionally. Incubation time varies but is approximately 18 days. The female will leave the nest unattended during the evening in order to feed. The male will roost in a neighbouring tree (the spot he chooses changes daily); he guards the nest by diving, hissing, wing-beating or booming at the sites. In the face of predation, common nighthawks do not abandon the nest easily; instead they likely rely on their cryptic colouration to camouflage themselves. If a departure does occur, the females have been noted to fly away, hissing at the intruder or performing a disturbance display.

===Incubation, hatching and young===
The eggs are elliptical, strong, and variably coloured with heavy speckling. The common nighthawk lays two eggs per clutch; the eggs are laid over a period of 1 to 2 days. The female alone displays a brood patch.

The chicks may be heard peeping in the hours before they hatch. Once the chicks have broken out of the shells, the removal of the debris is necessary in order to avoid predators. The mother may carry the eggshells to another location or consume a portion of them. Once hatched, the nestlings are active and have their eyes fully or half open; additionally they display a sparing cover of soft down feathers. The chicks are semi-precocial. By day 2, the hatchlings&#x27; bodily mass will double and they will be able to self-propel towards their mother&#x27;s call. The young will hiss at an intruder.

The young are fed by regurgitation before sunrise and after sunset. The male parent assists in feeding fledglings and will also feed the female during nesting. No records exist to support a parent&#x27;s ability to physically carry a chick.

On their 18th day, the young will make their first flight; by days 25–30, they are flying proficiently. The young are last seen with their parents on day 30. Complete development is shown between their 45–50th day. At day 52, the juvenile will join the flock, potentially migrating. Juvenile birds, in both sexes, are lighter in colour and have a smaller white wing-patch than adult common nighthawks.

===Predators===
Like other members of the caprimulgid clan, the nighthawk&#x27;s ground nesting habits endanger eggs and nestlings to predation by ground carnivores, such as skunks, raccoons and opossums. Confirmed predation on adults is restricted to domestic cats, golden eagles, and great horned owls. Peregrine falcons have also been confirmed to attack nighthawks as prey, although the one recorded predation attempt was unsuccessful. Other suspected predators are likely to attack them, such as dogs, coyotes, foxes, hawks, American kestrels, owls, crows and ravens, and snakes.

==Status and conservation==
There has been a general decline in the number of common nighthawks in North America, but some population increases also have occurred in other geographical locations. The bird&#x27;s large range makes individual risk thresholds in specific regions difficult to establish. In Ontario, the common nighthawk is rated as a species of special concern.

The Common nighthawk&#x27;s trait of being a ground-nesting bird makes it particularly susceptible to predators, some of which include domestic cats, ravens, snakes, dogs, coyotes, falcons and owls.

Lack of flat roofs, pesticides, increased predation and loss of habitat are noted factors of their decline. Further unstudied potential causes of decline include climate change, disease, road kills, man-made towers (posing aerial hazards), and parasites.

The absence of flat roofs (made with gravel) in urban settings is an important cause of decline. In an effort to provide managed breeding areas, gravel pads have been added in the corners of rubberized roofs; this proves acceptable, as nesting has been observed.

<doc id="357339" wikidata="Q360812" url="?curid=357339" title="Correctness (computer science)">
<text>In theoretical computer science, an algorithm is correct with respect to a specification if it behaves as specified. Best explored is &quot;functional&quot; correctness, which refers to the input-output behavior of the algorithm: for each input it produces an output satisfying the specification.

Within the latter notion, &quot;partial correctness&quot;, requiring that &quot;if&quot; an answer is returned it will be correct, is distinguished from &quot;total correctness&quot;, which additionally requires that an answer &quot;is&quot; eventually returned, i.e. the algorithm terminates. Correspondingly, to prove a program&#x27;s total correctness, it is sufficient to prove its partial correctness, and its termination. The latter kind of proof (termination proof) can never be fully automated, since the halting problem is undecidable.
For example, successively searching through integers 1, 2, 3, … to see if we can find an example of some phenomenon—say an odd perfect number—it is quite easy to write a partially correct program (see box). But to say this program is totally correct would be to assert something currently not known in number theory.

A proof would have to be a mathematical proof, assuming both the algorithm and specification are given formally. In particular it is not expected to be a correctness assertion for a given program implementing the algorithm on a given machine. That would involve such considerations as limitations on computer memory.

A deep result in proof theory, the Curry–Howard correspondence, states that a proof of functional correctness in constructive logic corresponds to a certain program in the lambda calculus. Converting a proof in this way is called &quot;program extraction&quot;.

Hoare logic is a specific formal system for reasoning rigorously about the correctness of computer programs. It uses axiomatic techniques to define programming language semantics and argue about the correctness of programs through assertions known as Hoare triples.

Software testing is any activity aimed at evaluating an attribute or capability of a program or system and determining that it meets its required results. Although crucial to software quality and widely deployed by programmers and testers, software testing still remains an art, due to limited understanding of the principles of software. The difficulty in software testing stems from the complexity of software: we can not completely test a program with moderate complexity. Testing is more than just debugging. The purpose of testing can be quality assurance, verification and validation, or reliability estimation. Testing can be used as a generic metric as well. Correctness testing and reliability testing are two major areas of testing. Software testing is a trade-off between budget, time and quality.

<doc id="357346" wikidata="Q313354" url="?curid=357346" title="Hundred (county division)">
<text>A hundred is an administrative division that is geographically part of a larger region. It was formerly used in England, Wales, some parts of the United States, Denmark, Sweden, Finland, Norway, and in Cumberland County in the British Colony of New South Wales. It is still used in other places, including in Australia (in South Australia and the Northern Territory).

Other terms for the hundred in English and other languages include &quot;wapentake&quot;, &quot;herred&quot; (Danish and Bokmål Norwegian), &quot;herad&quot; (Nynorsk Norwegian), &quot;härad&quot; or &quot;hundare&quot; (Swedish), &quot;Harde&quot; (German), &quot;hiird&quot; (North Frisian), &quot;kihlakunta&quot; (Finnish), and &quot;cantref&quot; (Welsh).

In Ireland, a similar subdivision of counties is referred to as a barony, and a hundred is a subdivision of a particularly large townland (most townlands are not divided into hundreds).

==Etymology==
The origin of the division of counties into hundreds is described by the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; (&quot;OED&quot;) as &quot;exceedingly obscure&quot;. It may once have referred to an area of 100 hides; in early Anglo-Saxon England a hide was the amount of land farmed by and required to support a peasant family, but by the eleventh century in many areas it supported four families. Alternatively the hundred may have been an area originally settled by one &quot;hundred&quot; men at arms, or the area liable to provide one &quot;hundred&quot; men under arms. In this early medieval use, the number term &quot;hundred&quot; can itself be unclear, meaning the &quot;short&quot; hundred (100) or in some contexts the long hundred of 120.

There was an equivalent traditional Germanic system. In Old High German a is a division of a &quot;gau&quot;, but the &quot;OED&quot; believes that the link between the two is not established.

==England==

===Administrative functions===

From the 11th century in England, and to a lesser extent from the 16th century in Wales, and until the middle of the 19th century, the annual assemblies had varying degrees of power at a local level in the feudal system. Of chief importance was their more regular use for taxation, and six centuries of taxation returns for the divisions survive to this day.

Groupings of divisions, small shires, were used to define parliamentary constituencies from 1832 to 1885. On the redistribution of seats in 1885 a different county subdivision, the petty sessional division, was used. Hundreds were also used to administer the first five national censuses from 1801 to 1841.

The system of county divisions was not as stable as the system of counties being established at the time, and lists frequently differ on how many hundreds a county had. In many parts of the country, the Domesday Book contained a radically different set of divisions from that which later became established. The numbers of divisions in each county varied widely. Leicestershire had six (up from four at Domesday), whereas Devon, nearly three times the size, had 32.

By the end of the 19th century, several single-purpose subdivisions of counties, such as poor law unions, sanitary districts, and highway districts, had sprung up, which, together with the introduction of urban districts and rural districts in 1894, mostly replaced the role of the parishes, and to a lesser extent the less extensive role of hundreds. The division names gave their name to multiple modern local government districts.

===Hundred===

In south and western England, a hundred was the division of a shire for military and judicial purposes under the common law, which could have varying extent of common feudal ownership, from complete suzerainty to minor royal or ecclesiastical prerogatives and rights of ownership. Until the introduction of districts by the Local Government Act 1894, hundreds were the only widely used assessment unit intermediate in size between the parish, with its various administrative functions, and the county, with its formal, ceremonial functions.

The term &quot;hundred&quot; is first recorded in the laws of Edmund I (939–46) as a measure of land and the area served by a hundred court. In the Midlands, they often covered an area of about 100 hides, but this did not apply in the south; this may suggest that it was an ancient West Saxon measure that was applied rigidly when Mercia became part of the newly established English kingdom in the 10th century. The &quot;Hundred Ordinance&quot;, which dates to the middle of the century, provided that the court was to meet monthly, and thieves were to be pursued by all the leading men of the district. 

During Norman times, the hundred would pay geld based on the number of hides. To assess how much everyone had to pay, a clerk and a knight were sent by the king to each county; they sat with the shire-reeve (or sheriff), of the county and a select group of local knights. There would be two knights from each hundred. After it was determined what geld had to be paid, the bailiff and knights of the hundred were responsible for getting the money to the sheriff, and the sheriff for getting it to the Exchequer.

Above the hundred was the shire, under the control of a sheriff. Hundred boundaries were independent of both parish and county boundaries, although often aligned, meaning that a hundred could be split between counties, or a parish could be split between hundreds. Exceptionally, in the counties of Kent and Sussex, there was a sub-division intermediate in size between the hundred and the shire: several hundreds were grouped together to form lathes in Kent and rapes in Sussex. At the time of the Norman conquest of England, Kent was divided into seven lathes and Sussex into four rapes.

====Hundred courts====
Over time, the principal functions of the hundred became the administration of law and the keeping of the peace. By the 12th century, the hundred court was held twelve times a year. This was later increased to fortnightly, although an ordinance of 1234 reduced the frequency to once every three weeks. In some hundreds, courts were held at a fixed place; while in others, courts moved with each sitting to a different location. The main duty of the hundred court was the maintenance of the frankpledge system. The court was formed of twelve freeholders, or freemen. According to a 13th-century statute, freeholders did not have to attend their lord&#x27;s manorial courts, thus any suits involving them would be heard in a hundred court.

For especially serious crimes, the hundred was under the jurisdiction of the Crown; the chief magistrate was a sheriff, and his circuit was called the sheriff&#x27;s tourn. However, many hundreds came into private hands, with the lordship of the hundred being attached to the principal manor of the area and becoming hereditary. Helen Cam estimated that even before the Conquest, over 130 hundreds were in private hands; while an inquest of 1316 found that by that date 388 of 628 named hundreds were held, not by the Crown, but by its subjects. Where a hundred was under a lord, a steward, acting as a judge and the chief official of the lord of the manor, was appointed in place of a sheriff.

The importance of the hundred courts declined from the 17th century, and most of their powers were extinguished with the establishment of county courts in 1867. The remaining duty of the inhabitants of a hundred to make good damages caused by riot was ended by the Riot (Damages) Act 1886, when the cost was transferred to the county police rate. The jurisdiction of hundred courts was curtailed by the Administration of Justice Act 1977.
====Chiltern Hundreds====
The steward of the Chiltern Hundreds is notable as a legal fiction, owing to a quirk of British Parliamentary law. A Crown Steward was appointed to maintain law and order in the area, but these duties ceased to be performed in the 16th century, and the holder ceased to gain any benefits during the 17th century. The position has since been used as a procedural device to allow resignation from the British House of Commons as a (formerly) remunerated office of the Crown.

=== Wapentake === 
A wapentake, an Old Norse–derived term as common in Northern England, was the equivalent of the Anglo-Saxon hundred in the northern Danelaw. In the Domesday Book of 1086, the term is used instead of hundreds in Yorkshire, the Five Boroughs of Derby, Leicester, Lincoln, Nottingham and Stamford, and also sometimes in Northamptonshire. The laws in wapentakes were similar to those in hundreds with minor variations. 

According to the first-century historian Tacitus, in Scandinavia the wapentake referred to a vote passed at an assembly by the brandishing of weapons. In some counties, such as Leicestershire, the wapentakes recorded at the time of Domesday Book later evolved into hundreds. In others, such as Lincolnshire, the term remained in use. 

Although no longer part of local government, there is some correspondence between the rural deanery and the former wapentake or hundred; especially in the East Midlands, the Buckingham Archdeaconry and the York Diocese.

==Wales==

In Wales an ancient Celtic system of division called &quot;cantrefi&quot; (a hundred farmsteads; singular &quot;cantref&quot;) had existed for centuries and was of particular importance in the administration of the Welsh law. The antiquity of the &quot;cantrefi&quot; is demonstrated by the fact that they often mark the boundary between dialects. Some were originally kingdoms in their own right; others may have been artificial units created later. With the coming of Christianity, the &quot;llan&quot; (similar to the parish) based Celtic churches often took the borders of the older cantrefi, and the same happened when Norman &#x27;hundreds&#x27; were enforced on the people of Wales.

Each &quot;cantref&quot; had its own court, which was an assembly of the &quot;uchelwyr&quot;, the main landowners of the &quot;cantref&quot;. This would be presided over by the king if he happened to be present, or if he was not present, by his representative. Apart from the judges there would be a clerk, an usher and sometimes two professional pleaders. The &quot;cantref&quot; court dealt with crimes, the determination of boundaries, and inheritance.

==Nordic countries==


The term &quot; (&quot;hundred&quot;) was used in Svealand and present-day Finland. The name is assumed to mean an area that should organise 100 men to crew four rowed war boats, which each had 12 pairs of oars and a commander.

Eventually, that division was superseded by introducing the &quot;härad&quot; or &quot;Herred&quot;, which was the term in the rest of the Nordic countries. This word was either derived from Proto-Norse *&quot;harja-raiðō&quot; (warband) or Proto-Germanic *&quot;harja-raiða&quot; (war equipment, cf. &quot;wapentake)&quot;. Similar to &quot;skipreide&quot;, a part of the coast where the inhabitants were responsible for equipping and manning a war ship.

Hundreds were not organized in Norrland, the northern sparsely populated part of Sweden. In Sweden, a countryside &#x27; was typically divided in a few &quot;socken&quot; units (parish), where the ecclesiastical and worldly administrative units often coincided. This began losing its basic significance through the municipal reform of 1862. A &#x27; was originally a subdivision of a &#x27; (province), but since the government reform of 1634, &#x27; (&quot;county&quot;) took over all administrative roles of the province. A &#x27; functioned also as electoral district for one peasant representative during the Riksdag of the Estates (Swedish parliament 1436–1866). The &#x27; (assize court) was the court of first instance in the countryside, abolished in 1971 and superseded by &quot; (modern district courts).

Today, the hundreds serve no administrative role in Sweden, although some judicial district courts still bear the name (e.g. ) and the hundreds are occasionally used in expressions, e.g. &quot; (district of seven hundreds).

It is not entirely clear when hundreds were organised in the western part of Finland. The name of the province of Satakunta, roughly meaning &quot;hundred&quot; ( meaning &quot;one hundred&quot; in Finnish), hints at influences from the times before the Northern Crusades, Christianization, and incorporation into Sweden.

As &#x27;, hundreds remained the fundamental administrative division for the state authorities until 2009. Each was subordinated to a &#x27; (province/county) and had its own police department, district court and prosecutors. Typically, cities would comprise an urban &#x27; by themselves, but several rural municipalities would belong to a rural &#x27;. In a rural hundred the lensmann (chief of local state authorities) was called &quot;nimismies&quot; (&quot;appointed man&quot;), or archaically &quot;vallesmanni&quot; (from Swedish). In the Swedish era (up to 1809), his main responsibilities were maintenance of stagecoach stations and coaching inns, supplying traveling government personnel with food and lodging, transport of criminal prisoners, police responsibilities, arranging district court proceedings (&quot;tingsrätt&quot;), collection of taxes, and sometimes arranging hunts to cull the wolf and bear population. Following the abolition of the provinces as an administrative unit in 2009, the territory for each authority could be demarcated separately, i.e. police districts need not equal court districts in number. The title &quot;härad&quot; survives in the honorary title of &quot;herastuomari&quot; (Finnish) or &quot;häradsdomare&quot; (Swedish), which can be given to lay judges after 8–10 years of service.

The term &quot;herred&quot; or &quot;herad&quot; was used in Norway between 1863 and 1992 for rural municipalities, besides the term kommune (heradskommune). Today, only four municipalities in western Norway call themselves &quot;herad&quot;, as Ulvik and Kvam. Some Norwegian districts have the word &quot;herad&quot; in their name, of historical reasons - among them Krødsherad and Heradsbygd in eastern Norway.

==United States==
Counties in Delaware, New Jersey and Pennsylvania were divided into hundreds in the 17th century, following the English practice familiar to the colonists. They survive in Delaware (see List of hundreds of Delaware), and were used as tax reporting and voting districts until the 1960s, but now serve no administrative role: their only official legal use is in real estate title descriptions.

Following American independence, the term &quot;hundred&quot; fell out of favour and was replaced by &quot;election district&quot;. However, the names of the old hundreds continue to show up in deeds for another 50 years.

Some plantations in early colonial Virginia used the term hundred in their names, such as Martin&#x27;s Hundred, Flowerdew Hundred, and West and Shirley Hundred. Bermuda Hundred was the first incorporated town in the English colony of Virginia. It was founded by Sir Thomas Dale in 1613, six years after Jamestown.

While debating what became the Land Ordinance of 1785, Thomas Jefferson&#x27;s committee wanted to divide the public lands in the west into &quot;hundreds of ten geographical miles square, each mile containing 6086 and 4-10ths of a foot&quot;. The legislation instead introduced the six-mile square township of the Public Land Survey System.

===Maryland===
The hundred was also used as a division of the county in Maryland. Carroll County, Maryland was formed in 1836 by taking the following hundreds from Baltimore County: North Hundred, Pipe Creek Hundred, Delaware Upper Hundred, Delaware Lower Hundred; and from Frederick County: Pipe Creek Hundred, Westminster Hundred, Unity Hundred, Burnt House Hundred, Piney Creek Hundred, and Taneytown Hundred. Maryland&#x27;s Somerset County, which was established in 1666, was initially divided into six hundreds: Mattapony, Pocomoke, Boquetenorton, Wicomico, and Baltimore Hundreds; later subdivisions of the hundreds added five more: Pitts Creek, Acquango, Queponco, Buckingham, and Worcester Hundreds.

The original borders of Talbot County (founded at some point prior to 12 February 1661) contained nine hundreds: Treadhaven Hundred, Bolenbroke Hundred, Mill Hundred, Tuckahoe Hundred, Worrell Hundred, Bay Hundred, Island Hundred, Lower Kent Island Hundred, Chester Hundred. In 1669 Chester Hundred was given to Kent County. In 1707 Queen Anne&#x27;s County was created from the northern parts of Talbot County, reducing the latter to seven hundreds (Lower Kent Island Hundred becoming a part of the former). Of these, only Bay Hundred legally remains in existence, as District 5 in Talbot County. The geographic region, which includes several unincorporated communities and part of present-day Saint Michaels, continues to be known by the name Bay Hundred, with state and local governments using the name in ways ranging from water trail guides to community pools, while local newspapers regularly use the name in reporting news.

==Australia==
In South Australia, land titles record in which hundred a parcel of land is located. Similar to the notion of the South Australian counties listed on the system of titles, hundreds are not generally used when referring to a district and are little known by the general population, except when transferring land title. When the land in the region of the present Darwin, in the Northern Territory, was first surveyed, the territory was administered by South Australia, and the surveyed land was divided up into hundreds.
The Cumberland County (Sydney) was also allocated hundreds in the nineteenth century, although these were later repealed. A hundred is traditionally one hundred square miles or , although this is often not exact as boundaries often follow local topography.

<text>The Tigray Region (or simply Tigray; officially the Tigray National Regional State) is the northernmost regional state in Ethiopia. The Tigray Region is the homeland of the Tigrayan, Irob and Kunama people. Its capital and largest city is Mekelle. Tigray is the fifth-largest by area, the fourth-most populous, and the fifth-most densely populated of the 11 regional states.

Tigray is bordered by Eritrea to the north, the Amhara Region to the south, the Afar Region to the east, and Sudan to the west. Towns in Tigrai include: Mekelle, Adigrat, Axum, Shire, Adwa, Humera, Dansha, Mai Kadra, Enticho, Feresmay, Wukro, Agula&#x27;e, Freweyni, Korarit, Adi Daero, Ketema Ngus, Adi Remets, Sheraro, Abiy Addi, Atsbi, Hawzen, Adi Gudom, Adi Shu, Chercher, Korem, Maychew, Alamata, Mekoni, Rama, May Tsebri, Addi Remets, Hagere Selam,Dowhan and Zalambessa.

Tigray&#x27;s official language is Tigrinya, similar to that of southern Eritrea. The Tigray region had an estimated pre-war population of 7,070,260. The majority of the population (c. 80%) are farmers, contributing 46% to the regional gross domestic product (2009). The highlands have the highest population density, especially in eastern and central Tigray. The much less densely populated lowlands comprise 48% of Tigray&#x27;s area. Although the percentage of Muslims in Tigray is less than 5%, it has supposedly been historically Islam&#x27;s doorway to the region and to Africa at large. Approximately 99% of Tigrayans are Orthodox Christian. Ethnic Tigrayans have the highest percentage of Orthodox Christians in the world.

The government of Tigray consists of the executive branch, led by the president, Getachew Reda; the legislative branch, which comprises the state council; and the judicial branch, which is led by the state supreme court. In early November 2020, a conflict between the Tigray People&#x27;s Liberation Front (TPLF) and the Ethiopian federal government (with support from Eritrea) rapidly escalating into the Tigray War, destabilizing the region, and exposing a well-organized campaign to wipe out the region of ethnic Tigrayans. As many as 600,000 people were killed as a result of the war. As of 2023, the region is run by the Interim Regional Administration of Tigray.

== History ==

=== 3rd millennium to 1st century BC ===
Tigray is often regarded as the cradle of Ethiopian civilization. Its landscape has many historic monuments. Three major monotheistic religions, Judaism, Christianity and Islam arrived in Ethiopia through the Red Sea and then Tigray.

Given the presence of a large temple complex and fertile surroundings, the capital of the 3,000-year-old kingdom of Dʿmt may have been near present-day Yeha. Dʿmt developed irrigation schemes, used the plough, grew millet, and made iron tools and weapons. Some modern historians, including Stuart Munro-Hay, Rodolfo Fattovich, Ayele Bekerie, Cain Felder, and Ephraim Isaac consider this civilization to be indigenous, although Sabaean-influenced due to the latter&#x27;s dominance of the Red Sea. Others, including Joseph Michels, Henri de Contenson, Tekletsadik Mekuria, and Stanley Burstein, have viewed Dʿmt as the result of a mixture of Sabaean and indigenous peoples. The most recent research, however, shows that Ge&#x27;ez, the ancient Semitic language spoken in Tigray, Eritrea and northern Ethiopia in ancient times, is not likely to have been derived from Sabaean. There is evidence of a Semitic-speaking presence in Tigray, Eritrea and northern Ethiopia at least as early as 2000 BC. It is now believed that Sabaean influence was minor, limited to a few localities and disappearing after a few decades or a century, It may have represented a trading or military colony, in some sort of symbiosis or military alliance with the civilization of Dʿmt or some other proto-Aksumite state.

After the fall of Dʿmt in the 5th century BC, the plateau came to be dominated by smaller, unknown successor kingdoms. This lasted until the rise of one of these polities during the first century BC, the Aksumite Kingdom, which succeeded in reunifying the area and is, in effect, the ancestor of medieval and modern states in Eritrea and Ethiopia using the name &quot;Ethiopia&quot; as early as the 4th century.

=== 1st to 10th century AD ===

The Kingdom of Aksum was a trading empire rooted in northern Ethiopia. It existed from approximately 100–940 AD, growing from the proto-Aksumite Iron Age period c. 4th century BC to achieve prominence by the 1st century AD.

According to the &quot;Book of Axum&quot;, Axum&#x27;s first capital, Mazaber, was built by Itiyopis, son of Cush. The capital was later moved to Aksum in northern Ethiopia.

The Empire of Aksum, at its height, at times extended across most of present-day Eritrea, Ethiopia, Djibouti, Sudan, Yemen and Saudi Arabia. The capital city of the empire was Axum, now in northern Ethiopia. Today a smaller community, the city of Axum was once a bustling metropolis and a cultural and economic hub. Two hills and two streams lie on the east and west expanses of the city; perhaps providing the initial impetus for settling this area. Along the hills and plain outside the city, the Aksumites had cemeteries with elaborate grave stones, which are called stelae, or obelisks. Other important cities included Yeha, Hawulti-Melazo, Matara, Adulis, and Qohaito, the last three of which are now in Eritrea. By the reign of Endubis in the late 3rd century, Aksum had begun minting its own currency and was named by Mani as one of the four great powers of his time, along with China and the Sassanid and Roman empires. It converted to Christianity in 325 or 328 under King Ezana and was the first state to use the image of the cross on its coins.
=== 11th to 19th century AD ===
In the 11th century the Tigrinya-speaking lands (Tigray-Mareb Melash) were divided into two provinces, separated by the Mereb River, by the newly enthroned Agaw emperors. The governor of the northern province received the title Bahre Negash (Ruler of the sea), whereas the governor of the southern province was given the title of Tigray Mekonen (Lord of Tigray). The Portuguese Jesuit Emanuele Baradas&#x27;s work titled &quot;Do reino de Tigr&quot;, written in 1633–34, states that the &quot;Reino de Tigr&quot; (Kingdom of Tigray) extended from Hamasien to Temben, from the borders of Dankel to the Adwa mountain. He also stated that Tigray-Mereb Melash was divided into 24 smaller political units (principalities), twelve of which were located south of the Mereb and governed by the Tigray Mekonen, based in Enderta. The other twelve were located north of the Mereb, under the authority of the Bahre Negash, based in the district of Serae.

The &quot;Book of Aksum&quot;, written and compiled mainly in the period from the sixteenth to seventeenth centuries, shows a traditional schematic map of Tigray with the city of Aksum at its center, surrounded by the 13 principal provinces: &quot;Tembien, Shire, Serae, Hamasien, Bur, Sam&#x27;a, Agame, Amba Senayt, Garalta, Enderta, Sahart and Abergele.&quot;

During the Middle Ages, the position of Tigray Mekonnen (&quot;Governor of Tigray&quot;) was established to rule over the area. Other districts included Akele Guzay (now part of Eritrea), and the kingdom of the Bahr negus, who ruled much of what is now Eritrea and Shire district and town in Western Tigray. At the time when Tigray Mekonnen existed simultaneously with that of Bahr negus, their frontier seems to have been the Mareb River, which is currently constitutes the border between the Ethiopian province of Tigray and Eritrea.

After the loss of power of the Bahr negus in the aftermath of Bahr negus Yeshaq&#x27;s rebellions, By the unsettled Zemene Mesafint period (&quot;Era of the Princes&quot;), both designations had declined to little more than empty titles, and the lord who succeeded them used (and received from the Emperor) the title of either Ras or Dejazmach, beginning with Ras Mikael Sehul. Rulers of Tigray such as Ras Wolde Selassie alternated with others, chiefly those of Begemder or Yejju, as warlords to maintain the Ethiopian monarchy during the Zemene Mesafint.

In the mid-19th century, the lords of Tembien and Enderta managed to establish an overlordship of Tigray. One of its members, Dejazmach Kahsay Mercha, ascended the imperial throne in 1872 under the name Yohannes IV. Following his 1889 death in the Battle of Metemma, the Ethiopian throne came under the control of the king of Shewa, and the center of power shifted south and away from Tigray.

=== 20th century ===
In 1943, a rebellion broke out all over southern and eastern Tigray under the slogan, &quot;there is no government; let&#x27;s organize and govern ourselves&quot;. Throughout Enderta Awraja, including Mekelle, Didibadergiajen, Hintalo, Saharti, Samre and Wajirat, Raya Awraja, Kilte-Awlaelo Awraja and Tembien Awraja, local assemblies, called gerreb, were formed. The gerreb sent representatives to a central congress, called the shengo, which elected leaders and established a military command system. Although the first Woyane rebellion of 1943 had shortcomings as a prototype revolution, historians agree that it involved a fairly high level of spontaneity and peasant initiative. It demonstrated considerable popular participation and reflected widely shared grievances. The uprising was specifically directed against the central &quot;Shoan Amhara&quot; regime of Haile Selassie I to rile support, despite Tigrayan imperial elite being collaborators and beneficiaries of the regime.

==== Ethiopian Civil War ====
Following the outbreak of the Ethiopian Revolution in February 1974, the first signal of any mass uprising was the actions of the soldiers of the 4th Brigade of the 4th Army Division in Nagelle in southern Ethiopia. The Coordinating Committee of the Armed Forces, Police, and Territorial Army, or the Derg (Ge&#x27;ez &quot;Committee&quot;), was officially announced 28 June 1974 by a group of military officers. The committee elected Major Mengistu Haile Mariam as its chairman and Major Atnafu Abate as its vice-chairman. In July 1974, the Derg obtained key concessions from the emperor, Haile Selassie, which included the power to arrest not only military officers but government officials at every level. Soon both former Prime Ministers Tsehafi Taezaz Aklilu Habte-Wold and Endalkachew Makonnen, along with most of their cabinets, most regional governors, many senior military officers and officials of the Imperial court were imprisoned. In August 1974, after a proposed constitution creating a constitutional monarchy was presented to the emperor, the Derg began a program of dismantling the imperial government in order to forestall further developments in that direction. The Derg deposed and imprisoned the emperor on 12 September 1974.
In addition, the Derg in 1975 nationalized most industries and private and somewhat secure urban real-estate holdings. But mismanagement, corruption, and general hostility to the Derg&#x27;s violent rule, coupled with the draining effects of constant warfare with the separatist guerrilla movements in Tigray, led to a drastic fall in general productivity of food and cash crops. In October 1978, the Derg announced the National Revolutionary Development Campaign to mobilize human and material resources to transform the economy, which led to a Ten-Year Plan (1984/85–1993/94) to expand agricultural and industrial output, forecasting a 6.5% growth in GDP and a 3.6% rise in per capita income. Instead per capita income declined 0.8% over this period. Famine scholar Alex de Waal observes that while the famine that struck the country in the mid-1980s is usually ascribed to drought, &quot;closer investigation shows that widespread drought occurred only some months after the famine was already under way&quot;. Hundreds of thousands fled economic misery, conscription, and political repression, and went to live in neighboring countries and all over the Western world, creating an Ethiopian diaspora.

Toward the end of January 1991, a coalition of rebel forces, the Ethiopian People&#x27;s Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF) captured Gondar, the ancient capital city, Bahar Dar, and Dessie.

==== Postwar ====
John Young, who visited the area several times in the early 1990s, attributes this delay in part to &quot;central budget restraint, structural readjustment, and lack of awareness by government bureaucrats in Addis Ababa of conditions in the province&quot;, but notes &quot;an equally significant obstacle was posed by an entrenched, and largely Oromo and Southern-dominated, central bureaucracy which used its power to block government-authorized funds from reaching Tigray&quot;. At the same time, a growing urban middle class of traders, businessmen and government officials emerged that was suspicious of and distant from the victorious EPRDF.
From 1991 to 2001, the president of Tigray was Gebru Asrat.
In 1998, war erupted between Eritrea and Ethiopia over a portion of territory that had been administered as part of Tigray, which included the town of Badme. A 2002 United Nations decision awarded much of this land to Eritrea, but Ethiopia did not accept the ruling until 2018, when a bilateral agreement ended the border conflict. The text of this agreement has not been publicly availed.

=== 21st century ===

From 2001 to 2010 the president was Tsegay Berhe.

==== 2020 administrative reorganisation ====
Between 2018 and 2020, as part of a reform aimed to deepen and strengthen decentralisation, woredas were reorganised, and new boundaries established. As smaller towns had been growing, they had started providing a larger range of services, such as markets and even banks, that encouraged locals to travel there rather than to their formal woreda centre. However, these locals still had to travel to their local woreda centre for most local government services – often in a different direction. In 2018 and 2019, after multiple village discussions that were often vigorous in the more remote areas, 21 independent urban administrations were added and other boundaries re-drawn, resulting in an increase from 35 to 88 woredas in January 2020.

==== Tigray War ====
Following the 2020 Tigray regional election, on 4 November, after the attacks by TDF on Northern Command units in Tigray and missiles sent to Eritrea, the Ethiopian and Eritrean militaries launched counterattacks. Ethiopian forces advanced through southern Tigray, while Eritrean troops occupied northern border towns. 

Warfare, the COVID-19 pandemic in Ethiopia, and a locust outbreak contributed to an emergency food situation in the region by January 2021. Approximately two million people faced food shortages, with a critical situation in Shire Inda Selassie, hosting 100,000 refugees. The Famine Early Warning Systems Network indicated that parts of central and eastern Tigray were likely in emergency phase 4, a step below famine.

== Geography ==
=== Location and size ===
Tigray is situated between 12° – 15°N and 36° 30&#x27; – 40° 30&#x27;E.

A 2006 national statistics report stated the land area as . The 2011 National Statistics gave an area of , but the sum of the figures it gave for the Tigray zones was substantially different, rendering the 2011 report internally inconsistent. The figure of 53,036 km2 (20,477 sq mi) is supported by the Google Maps area calculator demonstrated in this article.

=== Geology ===
==== Overview ====
The East African Orogeny led to the growth of a mountain chain in the Precambrian (up to 800 Ma [million years ago]), which was largely eroded afterwards. Around 600 Ma, the Gondwana break-up led to the presence of tectonic structures and a Palaeozoic planation surface, that extents to the north and west of the Dogu&#x27;a Tembien massif.

Subsequently, there was the deposition of sedimentary and volcanic formations, from older (at the foot of the massif) to younger, near the summits. From Palaeozoic to Triassic, Tigray was located near the South Pole. The (reactivate) Precambrian extensional faults guided the deposition of glacial sediments (Edaga Arbi Glacials and Enticho Sandstone). Later alluvial plain sediments were deposited (Adigrat Sandstone). The break-up of Gondwana (Late Palaeozoic to Early Triassic) led to an extensional tectonic phase, what caused the lowering of large parts of the Horn of Africa. As a consequence a marine transgression occurred, leading to the deposition of marine sediments (Antalo Limestone and Agula Shale). The region has an estimated 3.89 billion tons of mostly &quot;excellent&quot; quality oil shale.

At the end of the Mesozoic tectonic phase, a new (Cretaceous) planation took place. After that, the deposition of continental sediments (Amba Aradam Formation) indicates the presence of less shallow seas, probably caused by a regional uplift. At the beginning of the Caenozoic, there was a relative tectonic quiescence, during which the Amba Aradam Sandstones were partially eroded, which led to the formation of a new planation surface.

In the Eocene, the Afar plume, a broad regional uplift, deformed the lithosphere, leading to the eruption of flood basalts. Three major formations may be distinguished: lower basalts, interbedded lacustrine deposits and upper basalts. Almost at the same time, the Mekelle Dolerite intruded into the Mesozoic sediments, following joints and faults.

A new magma intrusion occurred in the Early Miocene, which gave rise to phonolite plugs, mainly in the Adwa area and also in Dogu&#x27;a Tembien. The present geomorphology is marked by deep valleys, eroded as a result of the regional uplift. Throughout the Quaternary, deposition of alluvium and freshwater tufa occurred in the valley bottoms.

==== Fossils ====
In Tigray, there are two main fossil-bearing geological units. The Antalo Limestone (upper Jurassic) is the largest. Its marine deposits comprise mainly benthic marine invertebrates. Also, the Tertiary lacustrine deposits, interbedded in the basalt formations, contain a range of silicified mollusc fossils.

In the Antalo Limestone: large &quot;Paracenoceratidae&quot; cephalopods (nautilus); &quot;Nerineidae&quot; indet.; sea urchins; Rhynchonellid brachiopod; crustaceans; coral colonies; crinoid stems.

In the Tertiary silicified lacustrine deposits: &quot;Pila (gastropod)&quot;; &quot;Lanistes&quot; sp.; &quot;Pirenella conica&quot;; and land snails (&quot;Achatinidae&quot; indet.).

All snail shells, both fossil and recent, are called &quot;t&#x27;uyo&quot; in Tigrinya language, which means &#x27;helicoidal&#x27;.

==== Traditional uses of rock ====
As Tigray holds a wide variety of rock types, there is expectedly a varied use of rock.
:* Natural stone masonry. Preferentially, the easier shaped limestone and sandstone are used to build homesteads and churches, but particularly in the upland areas, basalt is also used. Traditionally, fermented mud will be used as mortar
:* Fencing of homesteads, generally in dry stones
:* Church bells, generally three elongated plates in phonolite or clinkstone, with different tonalities
:* Milling stone: for this purpose plucked-bedrock pits, small rock-cut basins that naturally occur in rivers with kolks, are excavated from the river bed and further shaped. Milling is done at home using an elongated small boulder
:* Door and window lintels, prepared from rock types that frequently have an elongated shape (sandstone, phonolite, limestone), or that are easily shaped (tufa)
:* Troughs for livestock watering and feeding, generally hewn from tufa
:* Footpath paving, generally done as community work. Some very ancient paved footpaths occur on major communication lines dating back to the period before the introduction of the automobile
:* foot travellers stop, pray and put an additional stone
:* Stones collected from farmlands in order to free space for the crop, and heaped in typical rounded metres-high heaps, called &quot;zala&quot;
:* Contour bunding or &quot;gedeba&quot;: terrace walls in dry stone, typically laid out along the contour for sake of soil conservation
:* Check dams or &quot;qetri&quot; in gullies for sake of gully erosion control
:* Cobble stones, used for paving secondary streets in the towns. Generally limestone is used.

==== Major mountains ====
:* Ferrah Imba, 3954 metres, summit of the Tsibet massif in Endamekoni &quot;woreda&quot; (), and highest peak of Tigray
:* Imba Alaje, 3438 metres, in Alaje &quot;woreda&quot; ()
:* Mugulat, 3263 metres, in Ganta Afeshum &quot;woreda&quot; (); one of its spurs is crossed by the Siqurto foot tunnel
:* Asimba, 3199 metres, in Irob &quot;woreda&quot; ()
:* Upper plateaus of the Atsbi Horst at 3057 metres in Atsbi Wenberta &quot;woreda&quot; ()
:* Maebino, 3031 metres, in Irob &quot;woreda&quot; ()
:* Imba Tsion, 2917 metres, in Hawzen &quot;woreda&quot; ()
:* Ekli Imba, 2799 metres, summit of the Arebay massif in Degua Tembien &quot;woreda&quot; ()
:* Imba Aradom – sometimes transliterated as Amba Aradam, 2756 metres, in Hintalo Wajirat &quot;woreda&quot; ()
:* Soloda, 2436 metres, part of the Adwa plugs in Adwa &quot;woreda&quot; ()
:* Imba Neway, 2388 metres, in Abergele (woreda)()

=== Water challenge ===
Overall, the region is semi-arid. The wet season lasts only for a couple of months. The farmers are adapted to this, but the problem arises when rains are less than normal. Another major challenge is providing water to urban areas. Smaller towns, but particularly Mekelle, face endemic water shortages. Reservoirs have been built, but their management is sub-optimal.

=== Wildlife ===

==== Large mammals ====

Besides elephants in Western Tigray and the endemic gelada baboon on the highest mountains, large mammals in the region, with scientific (italics), English and Tigrinya language names, are:
* &quot;Cercopithecus aethiops&quot;; grivet monkey, ወዓግ ()

* &quot;Canis mesomelas&quot;, black-backed jackal, ቡኳርያ ()
* &quot;Canis anthus&quot;, golden jackal, ቡኳርያ ()
* &quot;Papio hamadryas&quot;, hamadryas baboon, ጋውና ()
* &quot;Procavia capensis&quot;, rock hyrax, ጊሐ ()
* &quot;Felis silvestris&quot;, African wildcat, ሓክሊ ድሙ ()
* &quot;Civettictis civetta&quot;, African civet, ዝባድ ()
* &quot;Papio anubis&quot;, olive baboon, ህበይ ()
* &quot;Ichneumia albicauda&quot;, white-tailed mongoose, ፂሒራ ()
* &quot;Herpestes ichneumon&quot;, large grey mongoose, ፂሒራ ()
* &quot;Hystrix cristata&quot;, crested porcupine, ቅንፈዝ ()
* &quot;Oreotragus oreotragus&quot;; klipspringer, ሰስሓ ()

* &quot;Lepus capensis&quot;, cape hare, ማንቲለ ()
* &quot;Mellivora capensis&quot;, honey badger, ትትጊ ()
==== Small rodents ====
The most common pest rodents with widespread distribution in agricultural fields and storage areas are three Ethiopian endemic species: the Dembea grass rat (&quot;Arvicanthis dembeensis&quot;, sometimes considered a subspecies of &quot;Arvicanthis niloticus&quot;), Ethiopian white-footed rat (&quot;Stenocephalemys albipes&quot;), and Awash multimammate mouse (&quot;Mastomys awashensis&quot;).

==== Bats ====
Bats occur in natural caves, church buildings and abandoned homesteads. The large colony of bats that roosts in Zeyi cave comprises &quot;Hipposideros megalotis&quot; (Ethiopian large-eared roundleaf bat), &quot;Hipposideros tephrus&quot;, and &quot;Rhinolophus blasii&quot; (Blasius&#x27;s horseshoe bat).

==== Birds ====
With its numerous exclosures, forest fragments and church forests, Tigray is a birdwatcher&#x27;s paradise. Detailed inventories list at least 170 bird species, including numerous endemic species.
Species belonging to the Afrotropical Highland Biome occur in the dry evergreen montane forests of the highland plateau but can also occupy other habitats. Wattled Ibis can be found feeding in wet grassland and open woodland. Black-winged Lovebird, Banded Barbet, Golden-mantled or Abyssinian Woodpecker, Montane White-eye, Rüppell&#x27;s Robin-chat, Abyssinian Slaty Flycatcher and Tacazze Sunbird are found in evergreen forest, mountain woodlands and areas with scattered trees including fig trees, &quot;Euphorbia abyssinica&quot; and &quot;Juniperus procera&quot;. Erckel&#x27;s spurfowl, Dusky Turtle Dove, Swainson&#x27;s or Grey-headed Sparrow, Baglafecht Weaver, African Citril, Brown-rumped Seedeater and Streaky Seedeater are common Afrotropical breeding residents of woodland edges, scrubland and forest edges. White-billed Starling and Little Rock Thrush can be found on steep cliffs; Speckled or African rock pigeon and White-collared Pigeon in gorges and rocky places but also in towns and villages.

Species belonging to the Somali-Masai Biome. Hemprich&#x27;s Hornbill and White-rumped Babbler are found in bushland, scrubland and dense secondary forest, often near cliffs, gorges or water. Chestnut-Winged or Somali Starling and Rüppell&#x27;s Weaver are found in bushy and shrubby areas. Black-billed wood hoopoes have some red at the base of the bill or an entirely red bill in this area.

Species belonging to the Sudan-Guinea Savanna Biome: Green-backed eremomela and Chestnut-crowned Sparrow-Weaver.

Species that are neither endemic nor biome-restricted but that have restricted ranges or that can be more easily seen in Ethiopia than elsewhere in their range: Abyssinian Roller is an Ethiopian relative of Lilac-breasted Roller, which is an intra-tropical breeding migrant of south and east Africa, and of European Roller, an uncommon Palearctic passage migrant. Black-billed Barbet, Yellow-breasted Barbet and Grey-headed Batis are species from the Sahel and Northern Africa but also occur in Acacia woodlands in the area.

The most regularly observed raptor birds in crop fields in Tigray are Augur buzzard (&quot;Buteo augur&quot;), Common Buzzard (&quot;Buteo buteo&quot;), Steppe Eagle (&quot;Aquila nipalensis&quot;), Lanner falcon (&quot;Falco biarmicus&quot;), Black kite (&quot;Milvus migrans&quot;), Yellow-billed kite (&quot;Milvus aegyptius&quot;) and Barn owl (&quot;Tyto alba&quot;).

Birdwatching can be done particularly in exclosures and forests. Eighteen bird-watching sites have been inventoried in Enderta and Degua Tembien and mapped.

=== Major cities ===
Mekelle, home to Mekelle University, Mekelle Institute of Technology, Tigray Institute of Policy Studies, Admas University, Microlink College, Nile College, and Mekelle College of Teacher Education is the capital of Tigray, near the geographic center of the state.

Other Tigray cities functioning as centers of Ethiopian metropolitan areas include:
:* Adigrat (home of Adigrat University, Debre Damo monastery and Addis Pharmaceutical Factory)
:* Adwa (home of Adwa Pan African University,)
:* Axum (home of Aksum University,)
:* Maychew (home of Raya University)

Of the 10 largest cities in Tigray, Maychew has the highest elevation at 2479 meter above sea level. Plenty of smaller towns, like Atsbi and Edaga Hamus are located at even higher elevations. Of the large cities, Humera is located at the lowest altitude (585 m).

The executive branch is headed by the Chief Administrator of the Interim Regional Administration of Tigray. The current president is Getachew Reda Kahsay, a TPLF member, appointed in 2023. A Vice President of Tigray succeeds the president in the event of any removal from office, and performs any duties assigned by the president. The other elected constitutional offices in the executive branch are the Regional Health Bureau (&quot;Ato&quot; Hagos Godefy), Educational Bureau (&quot;Ato&quot; Gebre&#x27;egziabher), Auditor General (&quot;Ato&quot; Alemseged Kebedew), and 12 other officials.

=== Judicial branch ===
There are three levels of the Tigray state judiciary. The lowest level is the court of common pleas: each woreda maintains its own constitutionally mandated court of common pleas, which maintain jurisdiction over all justiciable matters. The intermediate-level court system is the district court system. Four courts of appeals exist, each retaining jurisdiction over appeals from common pleas, municipal, and county courts in an administrative zone. A case heard in this system is decided by a three-judge panel, and each judge is elected.

The highest-ranking court, the Tigray Supreme Court, is Tigray&#x27;s &quot;court of last resort&quot;. A seven-justice panel composes the court, which, by its own discretion, hears appeals from the courts of appeals, and retains original jurisdiction over limited matters. The chief judge is called the President of Tigray Supreme Court (&quot;W/ro&quot; Hirity Miheretab).

=== Legislative branch ===
The State Council, which is the highest administrative body of the state, is made up of 152 members.

=== National politics ===
Tigray is represented by 38 representatives in the Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia House of Peoples&#x27; Representatives. But currently after the illegitimate postponement of the national election of Ethiopia Tigray has pulled it representative from the House of House of Peoples&#x27; Representatives and has no representation in the Federal parliament .

== Demographics ==

Based on the 2007 census conducted by the Central Statistical Agency of Ethiopia (CSA), the Tigray Region has a population of 4,316,988, of whom 2,126,465 are men and 2,190,523 women; urban inhabitants number 844,040 or 19.6% of the population. With an estimated area of 84,722 km2, the region had an estimated density of 51 people per km2. In the entire region 992,635 households were counted, for an average of 4.4 people per household, with urban households having on average 3.4 and rural households 4.6.

In the previous census, conducted in 1994, the region&#x27;s population was 3,136,267, of whom 1,542,165 were men and 1,594,102 women; urban inhabitants numbered 621,210, or 14% of the population.

According to the CSA, , 54.0% of the total population had access to safe drinking water, of whom 42.7% were rural inhabitants and 97.3% were urban. Values for other reported common indicators of the standard of living for Tigray include: 31.6% of the inhabitants fall into the lowest wealth quintile; adult literacy for men is 67.5% and for women 33.7%; and the infant mortality rate is 67 infant deaths per 1,000 live births, less than the national average of 77; at least half of these deaths occurred in the infants&#x27; first month of life.

The predominant religion in Tigray is Orthodox Christianity at 96.6%.


=== Ethnicity ===
With 96.6% of the local population, the region is predominantly inhabited by the Tigrinya-speaking Tigrayan people. The Tigrinya language belongs to the Semitic branch of the Afro-Asiatic family of languages. Most other residents hail from other Afro-Asiatic-speaking communities, including the Amhara, Irob, Afar, Agaw and Oromo. Partly assimilated Oromo live in remoter villages in Raya Azebo and Alamata (woreda), whereas there are Agaw in Abergele (woreda). There are also Nilo-Saharan-speaking Kunama as well.

=== Languages ===
The working language is Tigrinya. Saho and Kunama are also spoken, and most people in urban areas are also able to speak Amharic.

== Agriculture ==

=== Cropping ===

=== Terracing and dam construction ===

An important aspect of the agricultural work in Tigray after the end of the 1991 civil war was to minimize the problems of drought. In the past, Tigray was covered with forests and had a micro-climate that favoured the rains. Subsequently, the forests were cut down, usually to impoverish the population during the wars. Consequently, Tigray achieved a fair amount of rainfall during the rainy season, from August to September, but quickly lost these waters downstream. In the process the fertile soil of the fields eroded. After a few weeks of rain, the country again dried up.
The government undertook two projects in Tigray. The first was the construction of terraces which, with the agreement and help of local communities, go up to the tops of the mountains at 2,500 metres. The goal was to prevent the rainfall flowing away immediately so that it could be conserved for the agricultural season. On the highest terraces were planted trees, mainly eucalyptus, the dominant tree in Ethiopia and native to Australia. These plants created a new microclimate. The terracing method was very simple but required good organization. Long stretches of the fields were terraced by the villagers using stone walls from stones that erosion had exposed. The rains eroding the still non-terraced ground formed mudslides that were held by the topmost walls, which permitted construction of a new terrace field and another wall with uncovered stones, creating new ground terraced farmland every year.
Another endeavour involved the construction of small reservoirs for local irrigation. As rains last only for a couple of months per year, reservoirs of different sizes allow harvesting runoff from the rainy season for further use in the dry season. The dams needed to create these basins are typically an embankment of a few hundreds of meters, closing off one part of a valley, with a maximum height of 20 metres. Each took months of work, in which people carried earth on their back, and with assistance of donkeys. Generally 2,000–3,000 people – men, women and children – carried the earth in simple baskets.

The small reservoirs in Tigray include:

* Addi Abagiè
* Addi Akhor
* Addi Amharay
* May Leiba
* Hiza&#x27;iti Wedi Cheber
* Addi Asme&#x27;e
* Chini
* Addi Gela
* Addi Hilo
* Addi Qenafiz
* Addi Shihu
* Aqushela
* Arato
* Belesat
* Betqua
* Chichat
* Dibdibo
* Dur Anbesa
* Imbagedo
* Inda Zib&#x27;i
* Era (reservoir)
* Era Quhila
* Gereb Mihiz
* Filiglig
* Gereb May Zib&#x27;i
* Gereb Bi&#x27;ati
* Gereb Awso
* Felaga
* Gereb Segen (Hintalo)
* Gereb Segen (May Gabat)
* Gereb Shegal
* Ginda&#x27;i
* Godew

Overall, these reservoirs suffer from rapid siltation. Part of the water that could be used for irrigation is lost through seepage; the positive side-effect is that this contributes to groundwater recharge.

=== Vegetation and enclosures ===

Tigray holds numerous exclosures, areas that are set aside for regreening. Logging and livestock grazing are not allowed there. Besides effects on biodiversity, water infiltration, protection from flooding, sediment deposition, carbon sequestration, people commonly have economic benefits from these exclosures through grass harvesting, beekeeping and other non-timber forest products. The local inhabitants also consider it as &quot;land set aside for future generations&quot;. In Dogu&#x27;a Tembien, several exclosures are managed by the EthioTrees project. They have as an additional benefit that the villagers receive carbon credits for the sequestered CO2, as part of a carbon offset programme. The revenues are then reinvested in the villages, according to the priorities of the communities; it may be for an additional class in the village school, a water pond, conservation in the exclosures, or a store for incense.

=== Livestock ===
The CSA estimated in 2005 that farmers in Tigray had a total of 2,713,750 cattle (representing 7.0% of Ethiopia&#x27;s total cattle), 72,640 sheep (0.4%), 208,970 goats (1.6%), 1,200 horses (less than 0.1%), 9,190 mules (6.2%), 386,600 asses (15.4%), 32,650 camels (7.2%), 3,180,240 poultry of all species (10.3%), and 20,480 beehives (0.5%). Cattle are an essential component in the dominant grain-plough agricultural system. In the rainy season, a large part of the cattle herds are in transhumance.

Mainly used for draught, there are several cattle landraces in Tigray:
* Arado cattle, the dominant variety
* Raya cattle, long horned, especially raised in Southern Tigray and traded widely as plough oxen
* Irob cattle, particularly in the Irob woreda
* Abergele cattle, particularly in Abergele (woreda) and on the southwestern slopes of Dogu&#x27;a Tembien
* Begayt cattle, in western Tigray. They are known for better milk production
* In small towns: Cross-bred Arado x Begayt, and Arado x Holstein-Friesian milk cows

== Landmarks ==


A distinctive feature of Tigray are its rock-hewn churches. Similar in design to those of Lalibela in the Amhara Region, these churches are found in four or five clusters – Gheralta, Teka-Tesfay, Atsbi and Tembien – with Wukro sometimes included. Some of the churches are considered earlier than those of Lalibela, perhaps dating from the eighth century. Mostly monolithic, with designs partly inspired by classical architecture, they are often located at the top of cliffs or steep hills, for security. For example, Tigray&#x27;s ancient Debre Damo monastery is accessible only by climbing a rope 25 metres up a sheer cliff.

Looting has become a major issue in the Tigray Region, as archaeological sites have become sources for construction materials and ancient artifacts used for everyday purposes by local populations.

The area is famous for a single rock sculptured 23 meter long obelisk in Axum as well as for other fallen obelisks. The Axum treasure site of ancient Tigrayan history is a major landmark. Yeha is another important local landmark that is little-known outside the region.

== Transport ==

=== Ground travel ===
A major north–south road corridor goes through Tigray. This is facilitated by Highway 2 which goes from Adigrat to Addis Ababa and Highway 3 which goes from Shire to Addis Ababa.

=== Air travel ===

Tigray has one international airport and four commercial airports. The international airport is Alula Aba Nega Airport (MQX) near Mekelle. The region&#x27;s four other commercial airports are Shire Airport (SHC), Humera Airport (HUE), Dansha Airport, and Emperor Yohannes IV Airport (AXU), which serves Axum.

<text>The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) is the world&#x27;s largest and highest-energy particle accelerator. It was built by the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) between 1998 and 2008, in collaboration with over 10,000 scientists, and hundreds of universities and laboratories across more than 100 countries. It lies in a tunnel in circumference and as deep as beneath the France–Switzerland border near Geneva.

The first collisions were achieved in 2010 at an energy of 3.5 tera-electronvolts (TeV) per beam, about four times the previous world record. The discovery of the Higgs boson at the LHC was announced in 2012. Between 2013 and 2015, the LHC was shut down and upgraded; after those upgrades it reached 6.5 TeV per beam (13.0 TeV total collision energy). At the end of 2018, it was shut down for maintenance and further upgrades, and reopened over three years later in April 2022.

The collider has four crossing points where the accelerated particles collide. Nine detectors, each designed to detect different phenomena, are positioned around the crossing points. The LHC primarily collides proton beams, but it can also accelerate beams of heavy ions, such as in lead–lead collisions and proton–lead collisions.

The LHC&#x27;s goal is to allow physicists to test the predictions of different theories of particle physics, including measuring the properties of the Higgs boson, searching for the large family of new particles predicted by supersymmetric theories, and studying other unresolved questions in particle physics.

== Background ==
The term &quot;hadron&quot; refers to subatomic composite particles composed of quarks held together by the strong force (analogous to the way that atoms and molecules are held together by the electromagnetic force). The best-known hadrons are the baryons such as protons and neutrons; hadrons also include mesons such as the pion and kaon, which were discovered during cosmic ray experiments in the late 1940s and early 1950s.

A &quot;collider&quot; is a type of a particle accelerator that brings two opposing particle beams together such that the particles collide. In particle physics, colliders, though harder to construct, are a powerful research tool because they reach a much higher center of mass energy than fixed target setups. Analysis of the byproducts of these collisions gives scientists good evidence of the structure of the subatomic world and the laws of nature governing it. Many of these byproducts are produced only by high-energy collisions, and they decay after very short periods of time. Thus many of them are hard or nearly impossible to study in other ways.

== Purpose ==
Many physicists hope that the Large Hadron Collider will help answer some of the fundamental open questions in physics, which concern the basic laws governing the interactions and forces among elementary particles and the deep structure of space and time, particularly the interrelation between quantum mechanics and general relativity.

These high-energy particle experiments can provide data to support different scientific models. For example, the Standard Model and Higgsless model required high-energy particle experiment data to validate their predictions and allow further theoretical development. The Standard Model was completed by detection of the Higgs boson by the LHC in 2012.

LHC collisions have explored other questions, including:
* Do all known particles have supersymmetric partners, as part of supersymmetry in an extension of the Standard Model and Poincaré symmetry?
* Are there extra dimensions, as predicted by various models based on string theory, and can we detect them?
* What is the nature of the dark matter, a hypothetical form of matter which appears to account for 27% of the mass-energy of the universe?

Other open questions that may be explored using high-energy particle collisions include:
* It is already known that electromagnetism and the weak nuclear force are different manifestations of a single force called the electroweak force. The LHC may clarify whether the electroweak force and the strong nuclear force are similarly just different manifestations of one universal unified force, as predicted by various Grand Unification Theories.
* Why is the fourth fundamental force (gravity) so many orders of magnitude weaker than the other three fundamental forces? See also Hierarchy problem.
* Are there additional sources of quark flavour mixing beyond those already present within the Standard Model?
* Why are there apparent violations of the symmetry between matter and antimatter? See also CP violation.
* What are the nature and properties of quark–gluon plasma, thought to have existed in the early universe and in certain compact and strange astronomical objects today? This will be investigated by &quot;heavy ion collisions&quot;, mainly in ALICE, but also in CMS, ATLAS and LHCb. First observed in 2010, findings published in 2012 confirmed the phenomenon of jet quenching in heavy-ion collisions.

== Design ==
The collider is contained in a circular tunnel, with a circumference of , at a depth ranging from underground. The variation in depth was deliberate, to reduce the amount of tunnel that lies under the Jura Mountains to avoid having to excavate a vertical access shaft there. A tunnel was chosen to avoid having to purchase expensive land on the surface and to take advantage of the shielding against background radiation that the Earth&#x27;s crust provides.
The wide concrete-lined tunnel, constructed between 1983 and 1988, was formerly used to house the Large Electron–Positron Collider. The tunnel crosses the border between Switzerland and France at four points, with most of it in France. Surface buildings hold ancillary equipment such as compressors, ventilation equipment, control electronics and refrigeration plants.

The collider tunnel contains two adjacent parallel beamlines (or &quot;beam pipes&quot;) each containing a beam, which travel in opposite directions around the ring. The beams intersect at four points around the ring, which is where the particle collisions take place. Some 1,232 dipole magnets keep the beams on their circular path (see image), while an additional 392 quadrupole magnets are used to keep the beams focused, with stronger quadrupole magnets close to the intersection points in order to maximize the chances of interaction where the two beams cross. Magnets of higher multipole orders are used to correct smaller imperfections in the field geometry. In total, about 10,000 superconducting magnets are installed, with the dipole magnets having a mass of over 27 tonnes. About 96 tonnes of superfluid helium-4 is needed to keep the magnets, made of copper-clad niobium-titanium, at their operating temperature of , making the LHC the largest cryogenic facility in the world at liquid helium temperature. LHC uses 470 tonnes of Nb–Ti superconductor.

During LHC operations, the CERN site draws roughly 200 MW of electrical power from the French electrical grid, which, for comparison, is about one-third the energy consumption of the city of Geneva; the LHC accelerator and detectors draw about 120 MW thereof. Each day of its operation generates 140 terabytes of data.

When running an energy of 6.5 TeV per proton, once or twice a day, as the protons are accelerated from 450 GeV to 6.5 TeV, the field of the superconducting dipole magnets is increased from 0.54 to . The protons each have an energy of 6.5 TeV, giving a total collision energy of 13 TeV. At this energy, the protons have a Lorentz factor of about 6,930 and move at about , or about slower than the speed of light (&quot;c&quot;). It takes less than for a proton to travel 26.7 km around the main ring. This results in per second for protons whether the particles are at low or high energy in the main ring, since the speed difference between these energies is beyond the fifth decimal.

Rather than having continuous beams, the protons are bunched together, into up to , with in each bunch so that interactions between the two beams take place at discrete intervals, mainly apart, providing a bunch collision rate of 40 MHz. It was operated with fewer bunches in the first years. The design luminosity of the LHC is 1034 cm−2s−1, which was first reached in June 2016. By 2017, twice this value was achieved.
Before being injected into the main accelerator, the particles are prepared by a series of systems that successively increase their energy. The first system is the linear particle accelerator Linac4 generating 160 MeV negative hydrogen ions (H− ions), which feeds the Proton Synchrotron Booster (PSB). There, both electrons are stripped from the hydrogen ions leaving only the nucleus containing one proton. Protons are then accelerated to 2 GeV and injected into the Proton Synchrotron (PS), where they are accelerated to 26 GeV. Finally, the Super Proton Synchrotron (SPS) is used to increase their energy further to 450 GeV before they are at last injected (over a period of several minutes) into the main ring. Here, the proton bunches are accumulated, accelerated (over a period of ) to their peak energy, and finally circulated for 5 to while collisions occur at the four intersection points.

The LHC physics programme is mainly based on proton–proton collisions. However, during shorter running periods, typically one month per year, heavy-ion collisions are included in the programme. While lighter ions are considered as well, the baseline scheme deals with lead ions (see A Large Ion Collider Experiment). The lead ions are first accelerated by the linear accelerator LINAC 3, and the Low Energy Ion Ring (LEIR) is used as an ion storage and cooler unit. The ions are then further accelerated by the PS and SPS before being injected into LHC ring, where they reach an energy of 2.3 TeV per nucleon (or 522 TeV per ion), higher than the energies reached by the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider. The aim of the heavy-ion programme is to investigate quark–gluon plasma, which existed in the early universe.

=== Detectors ===

Nine detectors have been built in large caverns excavated at the LHC&#x27;s intersection points. Two of them, the ATLAS experiment and the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS), are large general-purpose particle detectors. ALICE and LHCb have more specialized roles, while the other five—TOTEM, MoEDAL, LHCf, SND and FASER—are much smaller and are for very specialized research. The ATLAS and CMS experiments discovered the Higgs boson, which is strong evidence that the Standard Model has the correct mechanism of giving mass to elementary particles.

=== Computing and analysis facilities ===
Data produced by LHC, as well as LHC-related simulation, were estimated at 200 petabytes per year.

The LHC Computing Grid was constructed as part of the LHC design, to handle the massive amounts of data expected for its collisions. It is an international collaborative project that consists of a grid-based computer network infrastructure initially connecting 140 computing centres in 35 countries (over 170 in more than 40 countries ). It was designed by CERN to handle the significant volume of data produced by LHC experiments, incorporating both private fibre optic cable links and existing high-speed portions of the public Internet to enable data transfer from CERN to academic institutions around the world. The LHC Computing Grid consists of global federations across Europe, Asia Pacific and the Americas.

The distributed computing project LHC@home was started to support the construction and calibration of the LHC. The project uses the BOINC platform, enabling anybody with an Internet connection and a computer running Mac OS X, Windows or Linux to use their computer&#x27;s idle time to simulate how particles will travel in the beam pipes. With this information, the scientists are able to determine how the magnets should be calibrated to gain the most stable &quot;orbit&quot; of the beams in the ring. In August 2011, a second application (Test4Theory) went live which performs simulations against which to compare actual test data, to determine confidence levels of the results.

By 2012, data from over 6 quadrillion () LHC proton–proton collisions had been analysed. The LHC Computing Grid had become the world&#x27;s largest computing grid in 2012, comprising over 170 computing facilities in a worldwide network across more than 40 countries.

== Operational history ==

The LHC first went operational on 10 September 2008, but initial testing was delayed for 14 months from 19 September 2008 to 20 November 2009, following a magnet quench incident that caused extensive damage to over 50 superconducting magnets, their mountings, and the vacuum pipe.

During its first run (2010–2013), the LHC collided two opposing particle beams of either protons at up to 4 teraelectronvolts or , or lead nuclei (574 TeV per nucleus, or 2.76 TeV per nucleon). Its first run discoveries included the long-sought Higgs boson, several composite particles (hadrons) like the χb (3P) bottomonium state, the first creation of a quark–gluon plasma, and the first observations of the very rare decay of the Bs meson into two muons (Bs0 → μ+μ−), which challenged the validity of existing models of supersymmetry.

===Construction===

==== Operational challenges ====

The size of the LHC constitutes an exceptional engineering challenge with unique operational issues on account of the amount of energy stored in the magnets and the beams. While operating, the total energy stored in the magnets is and the total energy carried by the two beams reaches .

Loss of only one ten-millionth part (10−7) of the beam is sufficient to quench a superconducting magnet, while each of the two beam dumps must absorb . These energies are carried by very little matter: under nominal operating conditions (2,808 bunches per beam, 1.15×1011 protons per bunch), the beam pipes contain 1.0×10−9 gram of hydrogen, which, in standard conditions for temperature and pressure, would fill the volume of one grain of fine sand.

==== Cost ====
With a budget of €7.5 billion (about $9bn or £6.19bn ), the LHC is one of the most expensive scientific instruments ever built. The total cost of the project is expected to be of the order of 4.6bn Swiss francs (SFr) (about $4.4bn, €3.1bn, or £2.8bn ) for the accelerator and 1.16bn (SFr) (about $1.1bn, €0.8bn, or £0.7bn ) for the CERN contribution to the experiments.

The construction of LHC was approved in 1995 with a budget of SFr 2.6bn, with another SFr 210M toward the experiments. However, cost overruns, estimated in a major review in 2001 at around SFr 480M for the accelerator, and SFr 50M for the experiments, along with a reduction in CERN&#x27;s budget, pushed the completion date from 2005 to April 2007. The superconducting magnets were responsible for SFr 180M of the cost increase. There were also further costs and delays owing to engineering difficulties encountered while building the cavern for the Compact Muon Solenoid, and also due to magnet supports which were insufficiently strongly designed and failed their initial testing (2007) and damage from a magnet quench and liquid helium escape (inaugural testing, 2008). Because electricity costs are lower during the summer, the LHC normally does not operate over the winter months, although exceptions over the 2009/10 and 2012/2013 winters were made to make up for the 2008 start-up delays and to improve precision of measurements of the new particle discovered in 2012, respectively.

==== Construction accidents and delays ====
* On 25 October 2005, José Pereira Lages, a technician, was killed in the LHC when a switchgear that was being transported fell on top of him.
* On 27 March 2007, a cryogenic magnet support designed and provided by Fermilab and KEK broke during an initial pressure test involving one of the LHC&#x27;s inner triplet (focusing quadrupole) magnet assemblies. No one was injured. Fermilab director Pier Oddone stated &quot;In this case we are dumbfounded that we missed some very simple balance of forces&quot;. The fault had been present in the original design, and remained during four engineering reviews over the following years. Analysis revealed that its design, made as thin as possible for better insulation, was not strong enough to withstand the forces generated during pressure testing. Details are available in a statement from Fermilab, with which CERN is in agreement. Repairing the broken magnet and reinforcing the eight identical assemblies used by LHC delayed the start-up date, then planned for November 2007.
* On 19 September 2008, during initial testing, a faulty electrical connection led to a magnet quench (the sudden loss of a superconducting magnet&#x27;s superconducting ability owing to warming or electric field effects). Six tonnes of supercooled liquid helium—used to cool the magnets—escaped, with sufficient force to break 10-ton magnets nearby from their mountings, and caused considerable damage and contamination of the vacuum tube. Repairs and safety checks caused a delay of around 14 months.
* Two vacuum leaks were found in July 2009, and the start of operations was further postponed to mid-November 2009.
==== Exclusion of Russia ====

With the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, the participation of Russians with CERN was called into question. About 8% of the workforce are of Russian nationality. In June 2022, CERN said the governing council &quot;intends to terminate&quot; CERN&#x27;s cooperation agreements with Belarus and Russia when they expire, respectively in June and December 2024. CERN said it would monitor developments in Ukraine and remains prepared to take additional steps as warranted. CERN further said that it would reduce the Ukrainian contribution to CERN for 2022 to the amount already remitted to the Organization, thereby waiving the second installment of the contribution.

==== Initial lower magnet currents ====
In both of its runs (2010 to 2012 and 2015), the LHC was initially run at energies below its planned operating energy, and ramped up to just 2 x 4 TeV energy on its first run and 2 x 6.5 TeV on its second run, below the design energy of 2 x 7 TeV. This is because massive superconducting magnets require considerable magnet training to handle the high currents involved without losing their superconducting ability, and the high currents are necessary to allow a high proton energy. The &quot;training&quot; process involves repeatedly running the magnets with lower currents to provoke any quenches or minute movements that may result. It also takes time to cool down magnets to their operating temperature of around 1.9 K (close to absolute zero). Over time the magnet &quot;beds in&quot; and ceases to quench at these lesser currents and can handle the full design current without quenching; CERN media describe the magnets as &quot;shaking out&quot; the unavoidable tiny manufacturing imperfections in their crystals and positions that had initially impaired their ability to handle their planned currents. The magnets, over time and with training, gradually become able to handle their full planned currents without quenching.

=== Inaugural tests (2008) ===

The first beam was circulated through the collider on the morning of 10 September 2008. CERN successfully fired the protons around the tunnel in stages, three kilometres at a time. The particles were fired in a clockwise direction into the accelerator and successfully steered around it at 10:28 local time. The LHC successfully completed its major test: after a series of trial runs, two white dots flashed on a computer screen showing the protons travelled the full length of the collider. It took less than one hour to guide the stream of particles around its inaugural circuit. CERN next successfully sent a beam of protons in an anticlockwise direction, taking slightly longer at one and a half hours owing to a problem with the cryogenics, with the full circuit being completed at 14:59.

==== Quench incident ====
On 19 September 2008, a magnet quench occurred in about 100 bending magnets in sectors 3 and 4, where an electrical fault vented about six tonnes of liquid helium (the magnets&#x27; cryogenic coolant) into the tunnel. The escaping vapour expanded with explosive force, damaging 53 superconducting magnets and their mountings, and contaminating the vacuum pipe, which also lost vacuum conditions.

Shortly after the incident, CERN reported that the most likely cause of the problem was a faulty electrical connection between two magnets. It estimated that repairs would take at least two months, owing to the time needed to warm up the affected sectors and then cool them back down to operating temperature. CERN released an interim technical report and preliminary analysis of the incident on 15 and 16 October 2008 respectively, and a more detailed report on 5 December 2008. The analysis of the incident by CERN confirmed that an electrical fault had indeed been the cause. The faulty electrical connection had led (correctly) to a failsafe power abort of the electrical systems powering the superconducting magnets, but had also caused an electric arc (or discharge) which damaged the integrity of the supercooled helium&#x27;s enclosure and vacuum insulation, causing the coolant&#x27;s temperature and pressure to rapidly rise beyond the ability of the safety systems to contain it, and leading to a temperature rise of about 100 degrees Celsius in some of the affected magnets. Energy stored in the superconducting magnets and electrical noise induced in other quench detectors also played a role in the rapid heating. Around two tonnes of liquid helium escaped explosively before detectors triggered an emergency stop, and a further four tonnes leaked at lower pressure in the aftermath. A total of 53 magnets were damaged in the incident and were repaired or replaced during the winter shutdown. This accident was thoroughly discussed in a 22 February 2010 &quot;Superconductor Science and Technology&quot; article by CERN physicist Lucio Rossi.

In the original schedule for LHC commissioning, the first &quot;modest&quot; high-energy collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 900 GeV were expected to take place before the end of September 2008, and the LHC was expected to be operating at 10 TeV by the end of 2008. However, owing to the delay caused by the incident, the collider was not operational until November 2009. Despite the delay, LHC was officially inaugurated on 21 October 2008, in the presence of political leaders, science ministers from CERN&#x27;s 20 Member States, CERN officials, and members of the worldwide scientific community.

Most of 2009 was spent on repairs and reviews from the damage caused by the quench incident, along with two further vacuum leaks identified in July 2009; this pushed the start of operations to November of that year.

=== Run 1: first operational run (2009–2013) ===

On 20 November 2009, low-energy beams circulated in the tunnel for the first time since the incident, and shortly after, on 30 November, the LHC achieved 1.18 TeV per beam to become the world&#x27;s highest-energy particle accelerator, beating the Tevatron&#x27;s previous record of 0.98 TeV per beam held for eight years.

The early part of 2010 saw the continued ramp-up of beam in energies and early physics experiments towards 3.5 TeV per beam and on 30 March 2010, LHC set a new record for high-energy collisions by colliding proton beams at a combined energy level of 7 TeV. The attempt was the third that day, after two unsuccessful attempts in which the protons had to be &quot;dumped&quot; from the collider and new beams had to be injected. This also marked the start of the main research programme.

The first proton run ended on 4 November 2010. A run with lead ions started on 8 November 2010, and ended on 6 December 2010, allowing the ALICE experiment to study matter under extreme conditions similar to those shortly after the Big Bang.

CERN originally planned that the LHC would run through to the end of 2012, with a short break at the end of 2011 to allow for an increase in beam energy from 3.5 to 4 TeV per beam. At the end of 2012, the LHC was planned to be temporarily shut down until around 2015 to allow upgrade to a planned beam energy of 7 TeV per beam. In late 2012, in light of the July 2012 discovery of the Higgs boson, the shutdown was postponed for some weeks into early 2013, to allow additional data to be obtained before shutdown.

=== Long Shutdown 1 (2013–2015) ===

The LHC was shut down on 13 February 2013 for its two-year upgrade called Long Shutdown 1 (LS1), which was to touch on many aspects of the LHC: enabling collisions at 14 TeV, enhancing its detectors and pre-accelerators (the Proton Synchrotron and Super Proton Synchrotron), as well as replacing its ventilation system and of cabling impaired by high-energy collisions from its first run. The upgraded collider began its long start-up and testing process in June 2014, with the Proton Synchrotron Booster starting on 2 June 2014, the final interconnection between magnets completing and the Proton Synchrotron circulating particles on 18 June 2014, and the first section of the main LHC supermagnet system reaching operating temperature of , a few days later. Due to the slow progress with &quot;training&quot; the superconducting magnets, it was decided to start the second run with a lower energy of 6.5 TeV per beam, corresponding to a current in the magnet of 11,000 amperes. The first of the main LHC magnets were reported to have been successfully trained by 9 December 2014, while training the other magnet sectors was finished in March 2015.

=== Run 2: second operational run (2015–2018) ===

On 5 April 2015, the LHC restarted after a two-year break, during which the electrical connectors between the bending magnets were upgraded to safely handle the current required for 7 TeV per beam (14 TeV collision energy). However, the bending magnets were only trained to handle up to 6.5 TeV per beam (13 TeV collision energy), which became the operating energy for 2015 to 2018. The energy was first reached on 10 April 2015. The upgrades culminated in colliding protons together with a combined energy of 13 TeV. On 3 June 2015, the LHC started delivering physics data after almost two years offline. In the following months, it was used for proton–proton collisions, while in November, the machine switched to collisions of lead ions and in December, the usual winter shutdown started.

In 2016, the machine operators focused on increasing the luminosity for proton–proton collisions. The design value was first reached 29 June, and further improvements increased the collision rate to 40% above the design value. The total number of collisions in 2016 exceeded the number from Run 1 – at a higher energy per collision. The proton–proton run was followed by four weeks of proton–lead collisions.

In 2017, the luminosity was increased further and reached twice the design value. The total number of collisions was higher than in 2016 as well.

The 2018 physics run began on 17 April and stopped on 3 December, including four weeks of lead–lead collisions.

===Long Shutdown 2 (2018–2022)===

Long Shutdown 2 (LS2) started on 10 December 2018. The LHC and the whole CERN accelerator complex was maintained and upgraded. The goal of the upgrades was to implement the High Luminosity Large Hadron Collider (HL-LHC) project that will increase the luminosity by a factor of 10. LS2 ended in April 2022. The Long Shutdown 3 (LS3) in the 2020s will take place before the HL-LHC project is done.

===Run 3: third operational run (2022)===

LHC became operational again on 22 April 2022 with a new maximum beam energy of 6.8 TeV (13.6 TeV collision energy), which was first achieved on 25 April. It officially commenced its run 3 physics season on 5 July 2022. This round is expected to continue until 2026. In addition to a higher energy the LHC is expected to reach a higher luminosity, which is expected to increase even further with the upgrade to the HL-LHC after Run 3.

== Timeline of operations ==


== Findings and discoveries ==

An initial focus of research was to investigate the possible existence of the Higgs boson, a key part of the Standard Model of physics which was predicted by theory, but had not yet been observed before due to its high mass and elusive nature. CERN scientists estimated that, if the Standard Model was correct, the LHC would produce several Higgs bosons every minute, allowing physicists to finally confirm or disprove the Higgs boson&#x27;s existence. In addition, the LHC allowed the search for supersymmetric particles and other hypothetical particles as possible unknown areas of physics. Some extensions of the Standard Model predict additional particles, such as the heavy W&#x27; and Z&#x27; gauge bosons, which are also estimated to be within reach of the LHC to discover.

=== First run (data taken 2009–2013) ===

The first physics results from the LHC, involving 284 collisions which took place in the ALICE detector, were reported on 15 December 2009. The results of the first proton–proton collisions at energies higher than Fermilab&#x27;s Tevatron proton–antiproton collisions were published by the CMS collaboration in early February 2010, yielding greater-than-predicted charged-hadron production.

After the first year of data collection, the LHC experimental collaborations started to release their preliminary results concerning searches for new physics beyond the Standard Model in proton–proton collisions. No evidence of new particles was detected in the 2010 data. As a result, bounds were set on the allowed parameter space of various extensions of the Standard Model, such as models with large extra dimensions, constrained versions of the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model, and others.

On 24 May 2011, it was reported that quark–gluon plasma (the densest matter thought to exist besides black holes) had been created in the LHC.
Between July and August 2011, results of searches for the Higgs boson and for exotic particles, based on the data collected during the first half of the 2011 run, were presented in conferences in Grenoble and Mumbai. In the latter conference, it was reported that, despite hints of a Higgs signal in earlier data, ATLAS and CMS exclude with 95% confidence level (using the CLs method) the existence of a Higgs boson with the properties predicted by the Standard Model over most of the mass region between 145 and 466 GeV. The searches for new particles did not yield signals either, allowing to further constrain the parameter space of various extensions of the Standard Model, including its supersymmetric extensions.

On 13 December 2011, CERN reported that the Standard Model Higgs boson, if it exists, is most likely to have a mass constrained to the range 115–130 GeV.
Both the CMS and ATLAS detectors have also shown intensity peaks in the 124–125 GeV range, consistent with either background noise or the observation of the Higgs boson.

On 22 December 2011, it was reported that a new composite particle had been observed, the χb (3P) bottomonium state.

On 4 July 2012, both the CMS and ATLAS teams announced the discovery of a boson in the mass region around 125–126 GeV, with a statistical significance at the level of 5 sigma each. This meets the formal level required to announce a new particle. The observed properties were consistent with the Higgs boson, but scientists were cautious as to whether it is formally identified as actually being the Higgs boson, pending further analysis. On 14 March 2013, CERN announced confirmation that the observed particle was indeed the predicted Higgs boson.

On 8 November 2012, the LHCb team reported on an experiment seen as a &quot;golden&quot; test of supersymmetry theories in physics, by measuring the very rare decay of the formula_1 meson into two muons (formula_2). The results, which match those predicted by the non-supersymmetrical Standard Model rather than the predictions of many branches of supersymmetry, show the decays are less common than some forms of supersymmetry predict, though could still match the predictions of other versions of supersymmetry theory. The results as initially drafted are stated to be short of proof but at a relatively high 3.5 sigma level of significance. The result was later confirmed by the CMS collaboration.

In August 2013, the LHCb team revealed an anomaly in the angular distribution of B meson decay products which could not be predicted by the Standard Model; this anomaly had a statistical certainty of 4.5 sigma, just short of the 5 sigma needed to be officially recognized as a discovery. It is unknown what the cause of this anomaly would be, although the Z&#x27; boson has been suggested as a possible candidate.

On 19 November 2014, the LHCb experiment announced the discovery of two new heavy subatomic particles, and . Both of them are baryons that are composed of one bottom, one down, and one strange quark. They are excited states of the bottom Xi baryon.

The LHCb collaboration has observed multiple exotic hadrons, possibly pentaquarks or tetraquarks, in the Run 1 data.
On 4 April 2014, the collaboration confirmed the existence of the tetraquark candidate Z(4430) with a significance of over 13.9 sigma. On 13 July 2015, results consistent with pentaquark states in the decay of bottom Lambda baryons (Λ) were reported.

On 28 June 2016, the collaboration announced four tetraquark-like particles decaying into a J/ψ and a φ meson, only one of which was well established before (X(4274), X(4500) and X(4700) and X(4140)).

In December 2016, ATLAS presented a measurement of the W boson mass, researching the precision of analyses done at the Tevatron.

=== Second run (2015–2018) ===

At the conference EPS-HEP 2015 in July, the collaborations presented first cross-section measurements of several particles at the higher collision energy.

On 15 December 2015, the ATLAS and CMS experiments both reported a number of preliminary results for Higgs physics, supersymmetry (SUSY) searches and exotics searches using 13 TeV proton collision data. Both experiments saw a moderate excess around 750 GeV in the two-photon invariant mass spectrum, but the experiments did not confirm the existence of the hypothetical particle in an August 2016 report.

In July 2017, many analyses based on the large dataset collected in 2016 were shown. The properties of the Higgs boson were studied in more detail and the precision of many other results was improved.

As of March 2021, the LHC experiments have discovered 59 new hadrons in the data collected during the first two runs.

=== Third run (2022 – present) ===
The third run of the LHC began in July of 2022, after more than three years of upgrades, and is planned to last until July of 2026.

On 5 July 2022, LHCb reported the discovery of a new type of pentaquark made up of a charm quark and a charm antiquark and an up, a down and a strange quark, observed in an analysis of decays of charged B mesons. The first ever pair of tetraquarks was also reported.

On 18 September 2024, ATLAS reported the first observation of quantum entanglement between quarks, with it also being the highest-energy observation of entanglement so far.

== Future plans ==

=== &quot;High-luminosity&quot; upgrade ===
After some years of running, any particle physics experiment typically begins to suffer from diminishing returns: as the key results reachable by the device begin to be completed, later years of operation discover proportionately less than earlier years. A common response is to upgrade the devices involved, typically in collision energy, luminosity, or improved detectors. In addition to a possible increase to 14 TeV collision energy, a luminosity upgrade of the LHC, called the High Luminosity Large Hadron Collider, started in June 2018 that will boost the accelerator&#x27;s potential for new discoveries in physics, starting in 2027. The upgrade aims at increasing the luminosity of the machine by a factor of 10, up to 1035 cm−2s−1, providing a better chance to see rare processes and improving statistically marginal measurements.

=== Proposed Future Circular Collider ===
CERN has several preliminary designs for a Future Circular Collider (FCC)—which would be the most powerful particle accelerator ever built—with different types of collider ranging in cost from around €9 billion (US$10.2 billion) to €21 billion. It would use the LHC ring as preaccelerator, similar to how the LHC uses the smaller Super Proton Synchrotron. It is CERN&#x27;s opening bid in a priority-setting process called the European Strategy for Particle Physics Update, and will affect the field&#x27;s future well into the second half of the century. As of 2023, no fixed plan exists and it is unknown if the construction will be funded.

== Safety of particle collisions ==
The experiments at the Large Hadron Collider sparked fears that the particle collisions might produce doomsday phenomena, involving the production of stable microscopic black holes or the creation of hypothetical particles called strangelets. Two CERN-commissioned safety reviews examined these concerns and concluded that the experiments at the LHC present no danger and that there is no reason for concern, a conclusion endorsed by the American Physical Society.

The reports also noted that the physical conditions and collision events that exist in the LHC and similar experiments occur naturally and routinely in the universe without hazardous consequences, including ultra-high-energy cosmic rays observed to impact Earth with energies far higher than those in any human-made collider, like the Oh-My-God particle which had 320 million TeV of energy, and a collision energy tens of times more than the most energetic collisions produced in the LHC.

== Popular culture ==
The Large Hadron Collider gained a considerable amount of attention from outside the scientific community and its progress is followed by most popular science media. The LHC has also inspired works of fiction including novels, TV series, video games and films.

CERN employee Katherine McAlpine&#x27;s &quot;Large Hadron Rap&quot; surpassed 8 million YouTube views as of 2022.&lt;ref name=&quot;Telegraph02/09/2008&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The band Les Horribles Cernettes was founded by women from CERN. The name was chosen so to have the same initials as the LHC.
National Geographic Channel&#x27;s &quot;World&#x27;s Toughest Fixes&quot;, Season 2 (2010), Episode 6 &quot;Atom Smasher&quot; features the replacement of the last superconducting magnet section in the repair of the collider after the 2008 quench incident. The episode includes actual footage from the repair facility to the inside of the collider, and explanations of the function, engineering, and purpose of the LHC.

The song &quot;Munich&quot; on the 2012 studio album &quot;Scars &amp; Stories&quot; by The Fray is inspired by the Large Hadron Collider. Lead singer Isaac Slade said in an interview with &quot;The Huffington Post&quot;, &quot;There&#x27;s this large particle collider out in Switzerland that is kind of helping scientists peel back the curtain on what creates gravity and mass. Some very big questions are being raised, even some things that Einstein proposed, that have just been accepted for decades are starting to be challenged. They&#x27;re looking for the God Particle, basically, the particle that holds it all together. That song is really just about the mystery of why we&#x27;re all here and what&#x27;s holding it all together, you know?&quot; 

The Large Hadron Collider was the focus of the 2012 student film &quot;Decay&quot;, with the movie being filmed on location in CERN&#x27;s maintenance tunnels.

===Fiction===
The novel &quot;Angels &amp; Demons&quot;, by Dan Brown, involves antimatter created at the LHC to be used in a weapon against the Vatican. In response, CERN published a &quot;Fact or Fiction?&quot; page discussing the accuracy of the book&#x27;s portrayal of the LHC, CERN, and particle physics in general. The movie version of the book has footage filmed on-site at one of the experiments at the LHC; the director, Ron Howard, met with CERN experts in an effort to make the science in the story more accurate.

The novel &quot;FlashForward&quot;, by Robert J. Sawyer, involves the search for the Higgs boson at the LHC. CERN published a &quot;Science and Fiction&quot; page interviewing Sawyer and physicists about the book and the TV series based on it.

<doc id="357354" wikidata="Q45286" url="?curid=357354" title="Cauchy–Binet formula">
<text>In mathematics, specifically linear algebra, the Cauchy–Binet formula, named after Augustin-Louis Cauchy and Jacques Philippe Marie Binet, is an identity for the determinant of the product of two rectangular matrices of transpose shapes (so that the product is well-defined and square). It generalizes the statement that the determinant of a product of square matrices is equal to the product of their determinants. The formula is valid for matrices with the entries from any commutative ring. 

== Statement ==

Let &quot;A&quot; be an &quot;m&quot;×&quot;n&quot; matrix and &quot;B&quot; an &quot;n&quot;×&quot;m&quot; matrix. Write [&quot;n&quot;] for the set {1, ..., &quot;n&quot;}, and formula_1 for the set of &quot;m&quot;-combinations of [&quot;n&quot;] (i.e., subsets of [&quot;n&quot;] of size &quot;m&quot;; there are formula_2 of them). For formula_3, write &quot;A&quot;[&quot;m&quot;],&quot;S&quot; for the &quot;m&quot;×&quot;m&quot; matrix whose columns are the columns of &quot;A&quot; at indices from &quot;S&quot;, and &quot;B&quot;&quot;S&quot;,[&quot;m&quot;] for the &quot;m&quot;×&quot;m&quot; matrix whose rows are the rows of &quot;B&quot; at indices from &quot;S&quot;. The Cauchy–Binet formula then states

: formula_4

Example: Taking &quot;m&quot; = 2 and &quot;n&quot; = 3, and matrices formula_5
and formula_6, the Cauchy–Binet formula gives the determinant

:formula_7

Indeed formula_8, and its determinant is formula_9 which equals formula_10 from the right hand side of the formula.

== Special cases ==
If &quot;n&quot; &lt; &quot;m&quot; then formula_1 is the empty set, and the formula says that det(&quot;AB&quot;) = 0 (its right hand side is an empty sum); indeed in this case the rank of the &quot;m&quot;×&quot;m&quot; matrix &quot;AB&quot; is at most &quot;n&quot;, which implies that its determinant is zero. If &quot;n&quot; = &quot;m&quot;, the case where &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; are square matrices, formula_12 (a singleton set), so the sum only involves &quot;S&quot; = [&quot;n&quot;], and the formula states that det(&quot;AB&quot;) = det(&quot;A&quot;)det(&quot;B&quot;).

For &quot;m&quot; = 0, &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; are empty matrices (but of different shapes if &quot;n&quot; &gt; 0), as is their product &quot;AB&quot;; the summation involves a single term &quot;S&quot; = Ø, and the formula states 1 = 1, with both sides given by the determinant of the 0×0 matrix. For &quot;m&quot; = 1, the summation ranges over the collection formula_13 of the &quot;n&quot; different singletons taken from [&quot;n&quot;], and both sides of the formula give formula_14, the dot product of the pair of vectors represented by the matrices. The smallest value of &quot;m&quot; for which the formula states a non-trivial equality is &quot;m&quot; = 2; it is discussed in the article on the Binet–Cauchy identity.

=== In the case &quot;n&quot; = 3 ===
Let formula_15 be three-dimensional vectors.

: formula_16

In the case &quot;m&quot; &gt; 3, the right-hand side always equals 0.

== A simple proof ==

The following simple proof relies on two facts that can be proven in several different ways:

# For any formula_17 the coefficient of formula_18 in the polynomial formula_19 is the sum of the formula_20 principal minors of formula_21. 
# If formula_22 and formula_23 is an formula_24 matrix and formula_25 an formula_26 matrix, then
::: formula_27.

Now, if we compare the coefficient of formula_28 in the equation formula_27, the left hand side will give the sum of the principal minors of formula_30 while the right hand side will give the constant term of formula_31, which is simply formula_32, which is what the Cauchy–Binet formula states, i.e.

: formula_33

== Proof ==

There are various kinds of proofs that can be given for the Cauchy−Binet formula. The proof below is based on formal manipulations only, and avoids using any particular interpretation of determinants, which may be taken to be defined by the Leibniz formula. Only their multilinearity with respect to rows and columns, and their alternating property (vanishing in the presence of equal rows or columns) are used; in particular the multiplicative property of determinants for square matrices is not used, but is rather established (the case &quot;n&quot; = &quot;m&quot;). The proof is valid for arbitrary commutative coefficient rings.

The formula can be proved in two steps:

# use the fact that both sides are multilinear (more precisely 2&quot;m&quot;-linear) in the &quot;rows&quot; of &quot;A&quot; and the &quot;columns&quot; of &quot;B&quot;, to reduce to the case that each row of &quot;A&quot; and each column of &quot;B&quot; has only one non-zero entry, which is 1.
# handle that case using the functions [&quot;m&quot;] → [&quot;n&quot;] that map respectively the row numbers of &quot;A&quot; to the column number of their nonzero entry, and the column numbers of &quot;B&quot; to the row number of their nonzero entry.

For step 1, observe that for each row of &quot;A&quot; or column of &quot;B&quot;, and for each &quot;m&quot;-combination &quot;S&quot;, the values of det(&quot;AB&quot;) and det(&quot;A&quot;[&quot;m&quot;],&quot;S&quot;)det(&quot;B&quot;&quot;S&quot;,[&quot;m&quot;]) indeed depend linearly on the row or column. For the latter this is immediate from the multilinear property of the determinant; for the former one must in addition check that taking a linear combination for the row of &quot;A&quot; or column of &quot;B&quot; while leaving the rest unchanged only affects the corresponding row or column of the product &quot;AB&quot;, and by the same linear combination. Thus one can work out both sides of the Cauchy−Binet formula by linearity for every row of &quot;A&quot; and then also every column of &quot;B&quot;, writing each of the rows and columns as a linear combination of standard basis vectors. The resulting multiple summations are huge, but they have the same form for both sides: corresponding terms involve the same scalar factor (each is a product of entries of &quot;A&quot; and of &quot;B&quot;), and these terms only differ by involving two different expressions in terms of constant matrices of the kind described above, which expressions should be equal according to the Cauchy−Binet formula. This achieves the reduction of the first step.

Concretely, the multiple summations can be grouped into two summations, one over all functions &quot;f&quot;:[&quot;m&quot;] → [&quot;n&quot;] that for each row index of &quot;A&quot; gives a corresponding column index, and one over all functions &quot;g&quot;:[&quot;m&quot;] → [&quot;n&quot;] that for each column index of &quot;B&quot; gives a corresponding row index. The matrices associated to &quot;f&quot; and &quot;g&quot; are

:formula_34

where &quot;formula_35&quot; is the Kronecker delta, and the Cauchy−Binet formula to prove has been rewritten as

: formula_36

where &quot;p&quot;(&quot;f&quot;,&quot;g&quot;) denotes the scalar factor formula_37. It remains to prove the Cauchy−Binet formula for &quot;A&quot; = &quot;L&quot;&quot;f&quot; and &quot;B&quot; = &quot;R&quot;&quot;g&quot;, for all &quot;f&quot;,&quot;g&quot;:[&quot;m&quot;] → [&quot;n&quot;].

For this step 2, if &quot;f&quot; fails to be injective then &quot;L&quot;&quot;f&quot; and &quot;L&quot;&quot;f&quot;&quot;R&quot;&quot;g&quot; both have two identical rows, and if &quot;g&quot; fails to be injective then &quot;R&quot;&quot;g&quot; and &quot;L&quot;&quot;f&quot;&quot;R&quot;&quot;g&quot; both have two identical columns; in either case both sides of the identity are zero. Supposing now that both &quot;f&quot; and &quot;g&quot; are injective maps [&quot;m&quot;] → [&quot;n&quot;], the factor formula_38 on the right is zero unless &quot;S&quot; = &quot;f&quot;([&quot;m&quot;]), while the factor formula_39 is zero unless &quot;S&quot; = &quot;g&quot;([&quot;m&quot;]). So
if the images of &quot;f&quot; and &quot;g&quot; are different, the right hand side has only null terms, and the left hand side is zero as well since &quot;L&quot;&quot;f&quot;&quot;R&quot;&quot;g&quot; has a null row (for &quot;i&quot; with formula_40). In the remaining case where the images of &quot;f&quot; and &quot;g&quot; are the same, say &quot;f&quot;([&quot;m&quot;]) = &quot;S&quot; = &quot;g&quot;([&quot;m&quot;]), we need to prove that

:formula_41

Let &quot;h&quot; be the unique increasing bijection [&quot;m&quot;] → &quot;S&quot;, and &quot;π&quot;,&quot;σ&quot; the permutations of [&quot;m&quot;] such that formula_42 and formula_43; then formula_44 is the permutation matrix for , formula_45 is the permutation matrix for &quot;σ&quot;, and &quot;L&quot;&quot;f&quot;&quot;R&quot;&quot;g&quot; is the permutation matrix for formula_46, and since the determinant of a permutation matrix equals the signature of the permutation, the identity follows from the fact that signatures are multiplicative.

Using multi-linearity with respect to both the rows of &quot;A&quot; and the columns of &quot;B&quot; in the proof is not necessary; one could use just one of them, say the former, and use that a matrix product &quot;L&quot;&quot;f&quot;&quot;B&quot; either consists of a permutation of the rows of &quot;B&quot;&quot;f&quot;([&quot;m&quot;]),[&quot;m&quot;] (if &quot;f&quot; is injective), or has at least two equal rows.

== Relation to the generalized Kronecker delta ==
As we have seen, the Cauchy–Binet formula is equivalent to the following:
:formula_47
where 
:formula_48

In terms of generalized Kronecker delta, we can derive the formula equivalent to the Cauchy–Binet formula:
:formula_49

== Geometric interpretations ==

If &quot;A&quot; is a real &quot;m&quot;×&quot;n&quot; matrix, then det(&quot;A&quot; &quot;A&quot;T) is equal to the square of the &quot;m&quot;-dimensional volume of the parallelotope spanned in R&quot;n&quot; by the &quot;m&quot; rows of &quot;A&quot;. Binet&#x27;s formula states that this is equal to the sum of the squares of the volumes that arise if the parallelepiped is orthogonally projected onto the &quot;m&quot;-dimensional coordinate planes (of which there are formula_2).

In the case &quot;m&quot; = 1 the parallelotope is reduced to a single vector and its volume is its length. The above statement then states that the square of the length of a vector is the sum of the squares of its coordinates; this is indeed the case by the definition of that length, which is based on the Pythagorean theorem.

In tensor algebra, given an inner product space formula_51 of dimension &quot;n&quot;, the Cauchy–Binet formula defines an induced inner product on the exterior algebra formula_52, namely:formula_53

== Generalization ==

The Cauchy–Binet formula can be extended in a straightforward way to a general formula for the minors of the product of two matrices. Context for the formula is given in the article on minors, but the idea is that both the formula for ordinary matrix multiplication and the Cauchy–Binet formula for the determinant of the product of two matrices are special cases of the following general statement about the minors of a product of two matrices. 
Suppose that A is an &quot;m&quot; × &quot;n&quot; matrix, B is an &quot;n&quot; × &quot;p&quot; matrix, &quot;I&quot; is a subset of {1...,&quot;m&quot;} with &quot;k&quot; elements and &quot;J&quot; is a subset of {1...,&quot;p&quot;} with &quot;k&quot; elements. Then 
:formula_54
where the sum extends over all subsets &quot;K&quot; of {1...,&quot;n&quot;} with &quot;k&quot; elements.

== Continuous version ==

A continuous version of the Cauchy–Binet formula, known as the Andréief-Heine identity or Andréief identity appears commonly in random matrix theory. It is stated as follows: let formula_55 and formula_56 be two sequences of integrable functions, supported on formula_57. Then
:formula_58

Forrester describes how to recover the usual Cauchy–Binet formula as a discretisation of the above identity.

<text>The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (SEP) is a freely available online philosophy resource published and maintained by Stanford University, encompassing both an online encyclopedia of philosophy and peer-reviewed original publication. Each entry is written and maintained by an expert in the field, including professors from many academic institutions worldwide. Authors contributing to the encyclopedia give Stanford University the permission to publish the articles, but retain the copyright to those articles.

==Approach and history==
As of August 5, 2022, the &quot;SEP&quot; has 1,774 published entries. Apart from its online status, the encyclopedia uses the traditional academic approach of most encyclopedias and academic journals to achieve quality by means of specialist authors selected by an editor or an editorial committee that is competent (although not necessarily considered specialists) in the field covered by the encyclopedia and peer review.

The encyclopedia was created in 1995 by Edward N. Zalta, with the explicit aim of providing a dynamic encyclopedia that is updated regularly, and so does not become dated in the manner of conventional print encyclopedias. The charter for the encyclopedia allows for rival articles on a single topic to reflect reasoned disagreements among scholars. Initially, the &quot;SEP&quot; was developed with U.S. public funding from the National Endowment for the Humanities and the National Science Foundation. A long-term fundraising plan to preserve open access to the encyclopedia is supported by many university libraries and library consortia. These institutions contribute under a plan devised by the &quot;SEP&quot; in collaboration with the Scholarly Publishing and Academic Resources Coalition, the International Coalition of Library Consortia, and the Southeastern Library Network, with matching funding from the National Endowment for the Humanities.

The logo depicts the initials of &quot;SEP&quot; in the shape of &quot;The Thinker&quot;, an original copy of which is co-owned by Stanford and which features across the university&#x27;s iconography and culture.

<text>The Crown is a political concept used in some Commonwealth realms. Depending on the context used, it generally refers to the entirety of the state (or in federal realms, the relevant level of government in that state), the executive government specifically or only to the monarch and their direct representatives.

The term can be used to refer to the rule of law; or to the functions of executive (the Crown-in-council), legislative (the Crown-in-parliament), and judicial (the Crown on the bench) governance and the civil service.

The concept of the Crown as a corporation sole developed first in the Kingdom of England as a separation of the physical crown and property of the kingdom from the person and personal property of the monarch. It spread through English and later British colonisation and developed into an imperial crown, which rooted it in the legal lexicon of all 15 Commonwealth realms, their various dependencies, and states in free association with them. Further evolution in the 20th century, whereby colonies became sovereign states caused divergence of the institution in the now former colonies, although still embodied in a single monarch. As a political concept or set of political concepts, the Crown should not to be confused with any physical crown, such as those of the British regalia.

The term is also found in various expressions such as &quot;Crown land&quot;, which some countries refer to as &quot;public land&quot; or &quot;state land&quot;; as well as in some offices, such as minister of the Crown, Crown attorney, and Crown prosecutor.

==Definition==

The term &quot;the Crown&quot; does not have a single definition. Legal scholars Maurice Sunkin and Sebastian Payne opined, &quot;the nature of the Crown has been taken for granted, in part because it is fundamental and, in part, because many academics have no idea what the term &quot;the Crown&quot; amounts to&quot;. Nicholas Browne-Wilkinson theorised that the Crown is &quot;an amorphous, abstract concept&quot; and, thus, &quot;impossible to define&quot;, while William Wade stated the Crown &quot;means simply the Queen&quot;. 

Warren J. Newman described the Crown is &quot;a useful and convenient means of conveying, in a word, the compendious formal, executive and administrative powers and apparatus attendant upon the modern constitutional and monarchical state.&quot; 

Lord Simon of Glaisdale stated:

Lord Diplock suggested the Crown means &quot;the government [and] all of the ministers and parliamentary secretaries under whose direction the administrative work of the government is carried out by the civil servants employed in the various government departments.&quot; This interpretation was supported by section 8 of the Pensions (Colonial Service) Act 1887 (50 &amp; 51 Vict. c. 13), which set the terms &quot;permanent civil service of the state&quot;, &quot;permanent civil service of Her Majesty&quot; and &quot;permanent civil service of the Crown&quot; as having the same meaning.

The Crown was first defined as an &#x27;imperial&#x27; crown during the reign of Henry VIII in the Ecclesiastical Appeals Act 1532 which declared that &#x27;this realm of England is an empire... governed by one Supreme Head and King having the dignity and royal estate of the imperial Crown of the same&#x27;. In William Blackstone&#x27;s 1765 &quot;Commentaries on the Laws of England&quot;, he explained that &quot;the meaning therefore of the legislature, when it uses these terms of &quot;empire&quot; and &quot;imperial&quot;, and applies them to the realm and crown of England, is only to assert that our king is equally sovereign and independent within these his dominions, as any emperor is in his empire; and owes no kind of subjection to any other potentate on earth.&quot;

==Concept==
The concept of the Crown took form under the feudal system. Though not used this way in all countries that had this system, in England, all rights and privileges were ultimately bestowed by the ruler. Land, for instance, was granted by the Crown to lords in exchange for feudal services and they, in turn, granted the land to lesser lords. One exception to this was common socage: owners of land held as socage held it subject only to the crown. When such lands become ownerless, they are said to escheat; i.e. return to direct ownership of the Crown (Crown land). is the royal prerogative by which unowned property, primarily unclaimed inheritances, becomes the property of the Crown.

As such, the physical crown and the property belonging to successive monarchs in perpetuity came to be separated from the person of the monarch and his or her private property. After several centuries of the monarch personally exercising supreme legislative, executive, and judicial power, these functions decreased as parliaments, ministries, and courts grew through the 13th century. The term &quot;the Crown&quot; then developed into a means by which to differentiate the monarch&#x27;s official functions from his personal choices and actions. Even within medieval England, there was the doctrine of capacities separating the person of the king from his actions in the capacity of monarch.

When the kingdom of England merged with those of Scotland and
Ireland, the concept extended into the legal lexicons of the United
Kingdom and its dependencies and overseas territories and, eventually, all of the independent Commonwealth realms. There are, thus, now many distinct crowns, as a legal concept, &quot;worn by&quot;—or many different offices of monarch occupied by—one person as sovereign (supreme monarch) of each country. However, &quot;the Crown&quot; can also mean the pan-national institution shared by all 15 Commonwealth realms.
In each Commonwealth realm, the term &quot;the Crown&quot;, at its broadest, now means the government or the polity known as the state, while the sovereign in all realms is the living embodiment of the state, or symbolic personification of the Crown. The body of the reigning sovereign thus holds two distinct personas in constant coexistence, an ancient theory of the &quot;King&#x27;s two bodies&quot;—the body natural (subject to infirmity and death) and the body politic (which never dies). The Crown and the sovereign are &quot;conceptually divisible but legally indivisible [...] The office cannot exist without the office-holder&quot;.

The terms &quot;the state&quot;, &quot;the Crown&quot;, &quot;the Crown in Right of [jurisdiction]&quot;, &quot;His Majesty the King in Right of [jurisdiction]&quot;, and similar, are all synonymous and the monarch&#x27;s legal personality is sometimes referred to simply as the relevant jurisdiction&#x27;s name. (In countries using systems of government derived from Roman civil law, the state is the equivalent concept.) However, the terms &quot;the sovereign&quot; or &quot;monarch&quot; and &quot;the Crown&quot;, though related, have different meanings: &quot;The Crown&quot; includes both the monarch and the government. The institution and powers of the Crown are formally vested in the king, but, conventionally, its functions are exercised in the sovereign&#x27;s name by ministers of the Crown drawn from and responsible to the elected chamber of parliament.

Still, the king or queen is the employer of all government officials and staff (including the viceroys, judges, members of the armed forces, police officers, and parliamentarians), the guardian of foster children (Crown wards), as well as the owner of all state lands (Crown land), buildings and equipment (Crown property), state-owned companies (Crown corporations or Crown entities), and the copyright for government publications (Crown copyright). This is all in his or her position as sovereign, not as an individual; all such property is held by the Crown in perpetuity and cannot be sold by the sovereign without the proper advice and consent of his or her relevant ministers. Should the monarch abdicate, all such property would remain with the Crown and come under the ownership of their successor.
The Crown also represents the legal embodiment of executive, legislative, and judicial governance. While the Crown&#x27;s legal personality is usually regarded as a corporation sole, it can, at least for some purposes, be described as a corporation aggregate headed by the monarch. Frederic William Maitland argued the Crown is a corporation aggregate embracing the government and the &quot;whole political community&quot;. J.G. Allen preferred to view the Crown as a corporation sole; one office occupied by a single person, enduring &quot;through generations of incumbents and, historically, lends coherence to a network of other institutions of a similar nature.&quot; Canadian academic Philippe Lagassé found the crown &quot;acts in various capacities, as such: crown-in-council (executive); crown-in-parliament (legislative); crown-in-court (judicial). It is also an artificial person and office as a corporation sole. At its most basic, &quot;the Crown&quot; is, in the UK and other Commonwealth realms, what in most other countries is &quot;the state&quot;.&quot;

==Divisibility of the Crown==

Historically, the Crown was considered to be indivisible. Two judgments—&quot;Ex parte Indian Association of Alberta&quot; (EWCA, 1982) and &quot;Ex parte Quark&quot; (House of Lords, 2005)—challenged that view. Today, it is considered separate in every country, province, state, or territory, regardless of its degree of independence, that has the shared monarch as part of the respective country&#x27;s government; though, limitations on the power of the monarch each territory vary according to relevant laws, thus making the difference between full sovereignty, semi-sovereignty, dependency, etc. The Lords of Appeal wrote, &quot;the Queen is as much the Queen of New South Wales and Mauritius and other territories acknowledging her as head of state as she is of England and Wales, Scotland, Northern Ireland, or the United Kingdom.&quot;

The Crown in each of the Commonwealth realms is a similar, but separate, legal concept. To distinguish the institution&#x27;s role in one jurisdiction from its place in another, Commonwealth law employs the expression &quot;the Crown of [place]&quot;; for example, the Crown in Right of the United Kingdom, the Crown in Right of Canada, the Crown in Right of the Commonwealth of Australia, etc. Because Canada is a federation, there are also crowns in right of each Canadian province. It is a matter of debate whether separate Crowns exist for each Australian state. When referring to the Crown in multiple jurisdictions, wording is typically akin to &quot;the Crown in right of [place], and all its other capacities&quot;.

The powers of a realm&#x27;s crown are exercised either by the monarch, personally, or by his or her representative on the advice of the appropriate local ministers, legislature, or judges, none of which may advise the Crown in any other realm.
===New Zealand===
In New Zealand, the term &quot;the Crown&quot; is used to mostly mean the authority of government; its meaning changes in different contexts. In the context of people considering the claims and settlements related to the Treaty of Waitangi, professor of history Alan Ward defines the Crown as &quot;the people of New Zealand—including Māori themselves—acted through elected parliament and government.&quot;

===Crown Dependencies===
In the Bailiwick of Guernsey, legislation refers to &quot;the Crown in Right of the Bailiwick of Guernsey&quot; or &quot;the Crown in Right of the Bailiwick&quot; and the law officers of the Crown of Guernsey submitted that, &quot;the Crown in this context ordinarily means the Crown in right of the &quot;république&quot; of the Bailiwick of Guernsey&quot; and that this comprises &quot;the collective governmental and civic institutions, established by and under the authority of the monarch, for the governance of these islands, including the states of Guernsey and legislatures in the other islands, the royal court and other courts, the lieutenant governor, parish authorities, and the Crown acting in and through the Privy Council&quot;.
In the Bailiwick of Jersey, statements by the law officers of the Crown define the Crown&#x27;s operation in that jurisdiction as &quot;the Crown in Right of Jersey&quot;, with all Crown land in the Bailiwick of Jersey belonging to the Crown in Right of Jersey and not to the Crown Estate of the United Kingdom. The Succession to the Crown (Jersey) Law 2013 defined the Crown, for the purposes of implementing the Perth Agreement in Jersey law, as the &quot;Crown in Right of the Bailiwick of Jersey&quot;.

Legislation in the Isle of Man also defines the Crown in Right of the Isle of Man as being separate from the Crown in Right of the United Kingdom.

===British Overseas Territories===
Following the Lords&#x27; decision in &quot;Ex parte Quark&quot;, 2005, it is held that the King, in exercising his authority over British Overseas Territories, does not act on the advice of the Cabinet of the United Kingdom, but, in his role as king of each territory, with the exception of fulfilling the UK&#x27;s international responsibilities for its territories. To comply with the court&#x27;s decision, the territorial governors now act on the advice of each territory&#x27;s executive and the UK government can no longer disallow legislation passed by territorial legislatures.

==In the courts==
In criminal proceedings, the state is the prosecuting party; the case is usually designated (in case citation) as &quot;R v [defendant]&quot;, where &quot;R&quot; can stand for either &quot;rex&quot; (if the current monarch is male) or &quot;regina&quot; (if the monarch is female), and the &quot;v&quot; stands for &quot;versus&quot;. For example, a criminal case against Smith might be referred to as &quot;R v Smith&quot; and verbally read as &quot;the Crown against Smith&quot;.
The Crown is, in general, immune to prosecution and civil lawsuits. So, &quot;R&quot; is rarely (albeit sometimes) seen on the right hand side of the &#x27;v&#x27; in the first instance. To pursue a case against alleged unlawful activity by the government, a case in judicial review is brought by the Crown against a minister of the Crown on the application of a claimant. The titles of these cases now follow the pattern of &quot;R (on the application of [X]) v [Y]&quot;, notated as &quot;R ([X]) v [Y]&quot;, for short. Thus, &quot;R (Miller) v Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union&quot; is &quot;R (on the application of Miller and other) v Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union&quot;, where &quot;Miller&quot; is Gina Miller, a citizen. Until the end of the 20th century, such case titles used the pattern &quot;R v Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union, ex parte Miller&quot;. Either form may be abbreviated &quot;R (Miller) v Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union&quot;.

In Scotland, criminal prosecutions are undertaken by the lord advocate (or the relevant procurator fiscal) in the name of the Crown. Accordingly, the abbreviation &quot;HMA&quot; is used in the High Court of Justiciary for &quot;His/Her Majesty&#x27;s Advocate&quot;, in place of &quot;rex&quot; or &quot;regina&quot;; as in, &quot;HMA v Al Megrahi and Fahima&quot;.

Most jurisdictions in Australia use &quot;R&quot; or &quot;The King&quot; (or &quot;The Queen&quot;) in criminal cases. If the Crown is the respondent to an appeal, the words &quot;The King&quot; will be spelled out, instead of using the abbreviation &quot;R&quot; (i.e. the case name at trial would be &quot;R v Smith&quot;; if the defendant appeals against the Crown, the case name would be &quot;Smith v The King&quot;). In Western Australia and Tasmania, prosecutions will be brought in the name of the respective state instead of the Crown (e.g. &quot;The State of Western Australia v Smith&quot;). Victorian trials in the original jurisdiction will be brought in the name of the director of public prosecutions. The Commonwealth director of public prosecutions may choose which name to bring the proceeding in. Judges usually refer to the prosecuting party as simply &quot;the prosecution&quot; in the text of judgments. In civil cases where the Crown is a party, it is a customary to list the body politic (e.g. &quot;State of Queensland&quot; or &quot;Commonwealth of Australia&quot;) or the appropriate government minister as the party, instead. When a case is announced in court, the clerk or bailiff may refer to the Crown orally as &quot;our sovereign lord the king&quot; (or &quot;our sovereign lady the queen&quot;).

In reporting on court proceedings in New Zealand, news reports will refer to the prosecuting lawyer (often called a Crown prosecutor, as in Canada and the United Kingdom) as representing the Crown; usages such as, &quot;for the Crown, Joe Bloggs argued&quot;, being common.

The Crown can also be a plaintiff or defendant in civil actions to which the government of the Commonwealth realm in question is a party. Such crown proceedings are often subject to specific rules and limitations, such as the enforcement of judgments against the Crown. lawsuits on behalf of the Crown were once common, but have been unusual since the Common Informers Act 1951 ended the practice of allowing such suits by common informers.

== Crown forces ==
The term &quot;Crown forces&quot; has been used by Irish republicans and nationalists, including members of paramilitary groups, to refer to British security forces which operate in Ireland. The term was used by various iterations of the Irish Republican Army (IRA) during conflicts such as Irish War of Independence and the Troubles. As noted by Irish republican Danny Morrison, &quot;[t]he term &#x27;security forces&#x27; suggests legitimacy, which is why republicans prefer terms like &#x27;the Brits&#x27; or &#x27;the Crown Forces&#x27;, which undermines their authority.&quot; Due to the Irish War of Independence, &quot;the phrase &#x27;Crown Forces&#x27; came to represent something abhorrent in the Republican narrative&quot;.

==Symbolism==
The Crown is represented by the image of a crown in heraldry and other imagery such as cap badges, uniforms, government logos and elsewhere. The heraldic crown is chosen by the reigning monarch. From 1661 to the reign of Queen Victoria, an image of St Edward&#x27;s Crown was used. The early part of Victoria&#x27;s reign depicted the Imperial State Crown created for her coronation, while a Tudor Crown began to be used from the 1860s. In 1901, the Tudor Crown design was standardised and continued in use until the reign of Elizabeth II in 1952 when a heraldic St Edward&#x27;s Crown was restored. In 2022, Charles III opted for a modified Tudor Crown design.

Crown copyright applies in perpetuity to depictions of the Royal Arms and any of its constituent parts under the royal prerogative, and The National Archives restricts rights to reproduce them. Although Crown Copyright usually expires 50 years after publication, Section 171(b) of the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988 made an exception for &#x27;any right or privilege of the Crown&#x27; not written in an act of parliament, thus preserving the rights of the Crown under the unwritten royal prerogative.

In addition, use of images of the crowns for commercial purposes is specifically restricted in the UK (and in countries which are party to the Paris Convention) under sections 4 and 99 of the Trade Marks Act 1994, and their use is governed by the Lord Chamberlain&#x27;s Office. It is also an offence under Section 12 of the Trade Descriptions Act 1968 to give a false indication that any goods or services are supplied to the monarch or any member of the royal family.

<text>Maria Luigi Carlo Zenobio Salvatore Cherubini ( ; ; 8 or 14 September 1760 – 15 March 1842) was an Italian Classical and Romantic composer. His most significant compositions are operas and sacred music. Beethoven regarded Cherubini as the greatest living composer of his era. Cherubini&#x27;s operas were heavily praised and interpreted by Rossini.

==Early years==
Cherubini was born Maria Luigi Carlo Zenobio Salvatore Cherubini in Florence in 1760. There is uncertainty about his exact date of birth. Although 14 September is sometimes stated, evidence from baptismal records and Cherubini himself suggests the 8th is correct. Perhaps the strongest evidence is his first name, Maria, which is traditional for a child born on 8 September, the feast-day of the Nativity of the Virgin. His instruction in music began at the age of six with his father, Bartolomeo, &quot;maestro al cembalo&quot; (&quot;Master of the harpsichord&quot;, in other words, ensemble leader from the harpsichord). Considered a child prodigy, Cherubini studied counterpoint and dramatic style at an early age. By the time he was thirteen, he had composed several religious works.

==Adulthood and first operas==
In 1780, he was awarded a scholarship by the Grand Duke of Tuscany to study music in Bologna and Milan. Cherubini&#x27;s early &quot;opere serie&quot; used libretti by Apostolo Zeno, Metastasio (Pietro Trapassi), and others that adhered closely to standard dramatic conventions. His music was strongly influenced by Niccolò Jommelli, Tommaso Traetta, and Antonio Sacchini, who were the leading Italian composers of the day. The first of his two comic works, &quot;Lo sposo di tre e marito di nessuna,&quot; premiered at a Venetian theater in November 1783.

Feeling constrained by Italian traditions and eager to experiment, Cherubini traveled to London in 1785 where he produced two &quot;opere serie&quot; and an &quot;opera buffa&quot; for the King&#x27;s Theatre. In the same year, he made an excursion to Paris with his friend the violinist Giovanni Battista Viotti, who presented him to Marie Antoinette and Parisian society. Cherubini received an important commission to write &quot;Démophoon&quot; to a French libretto by Jean-François Marmontel that would be his first &quot;tragédie en musique.&quot; Except for a brief return trip to London and to Turin for an &quot;opera seria&quot; commissioned by King Victor Amadeus III, Cherubini spent the rest of his life in France where he was initiated into Grand Orient de France &quot;Saint-Jean de Palestine&quot; Masonic Lodge in 1784.

==French assimilation==
Cherubini adopted the French version of his name, Marie-Louis-Charles-Zénobi-Salvador Cherubini; this appears in &quot;all&quot; extant documents that show his full name after 1790, though his Italian name is favored nowadays. Performances of &quot;Démophoon&quot; were favorably received at the Académie Royale de Musique in 1788. With Viotti&#x27;s help, the Théâtre de Monsieur in the Tuileries appointed Cherubini as its director in 1789. Three years later, after a move to the rue Feydeau and the fall of the monarchy, the company became known as the Théâtre Feydeau. This position gave Cherubini the opportunity to read countless libretti and choose one that best suited his temperament.

Cherubini&#x27;s music began to show more originality and daring. His first major success was &quot;Lodoïska&quot; (1791), which was admired for its realistic heroism. This was followed by &quot;Elisa&quot; (1794), set in the Swiss Alps, and &quot;Médée&quot; (1797), Cherubini&#x27;s best-known work. &quot;Les deux journées&quot; (1800), in which Cherubini simplified his style, was a popular success. These and other operas were premièred at the Théâtre Feydeau or the Opéra-Comique. Feeling financially secure, he married Anne Cécile Tourette in 1794 and began a family of three children.

The fallout from the French Revolution affected Cherubini until the end of his life. Politics forced him to hide his connections with the former aristocracy and seek governmental appointments. Although Napoleon found him too complex, Cherubini wrote at least one patriotic work per year for more than a decade. He was appointed Napoleon&#x27;s director of music in Vienna for part of 1805 and 1806, whereupon he conducted several of his works in that city.

In 1808 Cherubini was elected an associated member of the Royal Institute of the Netherlands.

==From opera to church music==

After &quot;Les deux journées&quot;, Parisian audiences began to favor younger composers such as Boieldieu. Cherubini&#x27;s opera-ballet &quot;Anacréon&quot; was an outright failure and most stage works after it did not achieve success. &quot;Faniska&quot;, produced in 1806, was an exception, receiving an enthusiastic response, in particular by Haydn and Beethoven. &quot;Les Abencérages&quot; (1813), an heroic drama set in Spain during the last days of the Moorish kingdom of Granada, was Cherubini&#x27;s attempt to compete with Spontini&#x27;s &quot;La vestale&quot;; it received critical praise but few performances.

Disappointed with his lack of acclaim in the theater, Cherubini turned increasingly to church music, writing seven masses, two requiems, and many shorter pieces. During this period (under the restored monarchy) he was appointed &quot;Surintendant de la Musique du Roi&quot;, a position he would hold until the fall of Charles X (1830). In 1815 London&#x27;s Royal Philharmonic Society commissioned him to write a symphony, an overture, and a composition for chorus and orchestra, the performances of which he went especially to London to conduct, increasing his fame.

Cherubini&#x27;s Requiem in C minor (1816), commemorating the anniversary of the execution of King Louis XVI, was a huge success. The work was greatly admired by Beethoven, Schumann and Brahms. In 1836, Cherubini wrote a Requiem in D minor to be performed at his own funeral. It is for male choir only, as the religious authorities had criticised his use of female voices in the earlier work.

==Later years and legacy==

In 1822, Cherubini became director of the Conservatoire and completed his textbook, &quot;Cours de contrepoint et de fugue&quot;, in 1835. His role at the Conservatoire brought him into conflict with the young Hector Berlioz, who portrayed the old composer in his memoirs as a crotchety pedant. Some critics, such as Basil Deane, maintain that Berlioz&#x27;s depiction has distorted Cherubini&#x27;s image with posterity. There are many allusions to Cherubini&#x27;s personal irritability among his contemporaries; Adolphe Adam wrote, &quot;some maintain his temper was very even, because he was always angry.&quot; Nevertheless, Cherubini had many friends, including Szymanowska, Rossini, Chopin and, above all, the artist Ingres. The two had mutual interests: Cherubini was a keen amateur painter and Ingres enjoyed practising the violin. In 1841, Ingres produced the most celebrated portrait of the old composer.

Although chamber music does not make up a large portion of his output, what he did write was important. Wilhelm Altmann, writing in his &quot;Handbuch für Streichquartettspieler&quot; (&quot;Handbook for String Quartet Players&quot;) about Cherubini&#x27;s six string quartets, stated that they are first rate and regarded Nos. 1 and 3 as masterworks. His String Quintet for two violins, viola and two cellos is also considered a first-rate work.

During his lifetime, Cherubini received France&#x27;s highest and most prestigious honors. These included the &quot;Chevalier de la Légion d&#x27;honneur&quot; (1814) and &quot;Membre de l&#x27;Académie des Beaux-Arts&quot; (1815). In 1841, he was made &quot;Commandeur de la Légion d&#x27;honneur&quot;, the first musician to receive that title.

Cherubini died in Paris in 1842 at age 81 and is buried at Père Lachaise Cemetery, just four metres from his friend Chopin. His tomb was designed by the architect Achille Leclère and includes a figure by the sculptor Augustin-Alexandre Dumont representing &quot;Music&quot; crowning a bust of the composer with a wreath.

<doc id="357364" wikidata="Q782939" url="?curid=357364" title="Afonso, Hereditary Prince of Portugal">
<text>Afonso, Hereditary Prince of Portugal (; 18 May 147513 July 1491) was the heir apparent to the throne of Portugal. He was born in Lisbon, Portugal, and died in a horse-riding accident on the banks of the river Tagus.

==Heir apparent==
Afonso, named after his grandfather, King Afonso V, was the only son of King John II and Eleanor of Viseu. The king was very fond of him and named the island of Príncipe after him (&quot;príncipe&quot; meaning &quot;prince&quot; in the Portuguese language).

==Marriage==
Afonso&#x27;s grandfather Afonso V of Portugal had sided with Joanna la Beltraneja, who was a rival for the throne of Castile against her half-aunt, Queen Isabella I of Castile. She was never considered legitimate and, when the king was dying, no one took her as a serious contender for the crown. Isabella was due to inherit the crown, but Afonso V was keen to interfere with the succession in Castile. In 1475 he married his niece Joanna, whom he considered the legitimate heir to the crown. Since her adulteress mother was his own sister, Afonso V had not only ambition, but the family honour to protect. He proclaimed himself King of Castile and León and prepared to defend his wife&#x27;s rights.

King Ferdinand and Isabella, however, won the war of succession and, as part of the Treaty of Alcáçovas, signed in 1479, it was agreed that their eldest daughter Isabella would marry Afonso. Isabella was also to come with a very large dowry that in practice represented the war compensation obtained by Portugal. In 1480, Prince Afonso, who at that time was five years old, went to live in the town of Moura with his maternal grandmother, Beatrice. In the early months of the following year, his future wife, the ten-year-old Isabella, joined him and lived there for about two years.

The wedding, by proxy, took place ten years later in the spring of 1490 in Seville. On 19 November of that year, Isabella arrived in Badajoz where she was welcomed by Afonso&#x27;s uncle, Manuel, the future King Manuel I of Portugal, whom she would eventually marry six years after her husband&#x27;s death. Afonso and Isabella were reunited in Elvas on 22 November and, on the following day, Isabella met her mother-in-law, Queen Eleanor, in the Convento do Espinheiro in Évora, where the court had gathered to ratify the marriage that had been celebrated earlier in Seville.

This wedding had the blessings of both Kingdoms. The queen of Castile, whose mother and nurse were Portuguese, wanted to strengthen the ties with Portugal, and, at the same time, this would allow her to &quot;keep an eye on and control the steps of her eternal rival, Joanna la Beltraneja&quot;, through her daughter.

==Death==

In July 1491, the royal family was spending the summer in the Santarém District near the banks of the River Tagus. King John invited his son to swim with him. The young prince refused the invitation at first, but seeing that his father wanted him to keep him company, decided to join him. According to the chronicle of Rui de Pina:
According to the same author, when Afonso&#x27;s mother heard the news of the accident, stricken with grief, she ran, riding on a mule, accompanied by her daughter-in-law, to be with her son who was lying on the ground. Nothing could be done. As a sign of mourning, his parents decided to dress in black. The funeral rites were held at Batalha Monastery and Prince Afonso was buried there, also the resting place of his grandfather King Afonso V. His widow, Infanta Isabella, returned to Castile and even before the siege of Granada was lifted, she joined her parents in Íllora. The Catholic Monarchs abandoned the camp temporarily to be with their daughter and to console her.

==Aftermath==
King John tried without success until the end of his life to legitimize the ten-year-old Jorge, Duke of Coimbra, his illegitimate son. His wife, Queen Eleanor, was adamantly against having the king&#x27;s bastard son occupy the throne, an opinion shared by the Catholic Monarchs, who, like Queen Eleanor, supported the claims of the Duke of Beja, Eleanor&#x27;s brother, as the heir to the throne. In 1494, King John, whose health had worsened, executed his last will in which named his cousin and brother-in-law, the Duke of Beja, his successor. King John died in October 1495 and, in 1497, his successor, the Duke of Beja, now King Manuel I of Portugal, married Isabella, Prince Afonso&#x27;s widow.

<doc id="357365" wikidata="Q157521" url="?curid=357365" title="Charles Lucien Bonaparte">
<text>Charles Lucien Jules Laurent Bonaparte, 2nd Prince of Canino and Musignano (24 May 1803 – 29 July 1857) was a French naturalist and ornithologist, and a nephew of Napoleon. Lucien and his wife had twelve children, including Cardinal Lucien Bonaparte.

==Life and career==
Bonaparte was the son of Lucien Bonaparte and Alexandrine de Bleschamp. Lucien was a younger brother of Napoleon I, making Charles the emperor’s nephew. Born in Paris, he was raised in Italy. On 29 June 1822, he married his cousin, Zénaïde, in Brussels. Soon after the marriage, the couple left for Philadelphia in the United States to live with Zénaïde&#x27;s father, Joseph Bonaparte (who was also the paternal uncle of Charles). Before leaving Italy, Charles had already discovered a warbler new to science, the moustached warbler, and on the voyage he collected specimens of a new storm-petrel. On arrival in the United States, he presented a paper on this new bird, which was later named after Alexander Wilson. 

He and his wife resided in the Lake House in his father-in-law&#x27;s Point Breeze estate in Bordentown, New Jersey.

Bonaparte then set about studying the ornithology of the United States and updating Wilson&#x27;s &quot;Ornithology or History of the Birds of the United States&quot;. The revised edition was published between 1825 and 1833. His other publications included &quot;Observations on the Nomenclature of Wilson&#x27;s Ornithology&quot; (in the Journal of the Philadelphia Academy) and &quot;Synopsis of the Birds of the United States&quot; (in the Annals of the Lyceum of New York). In 1824, Bonaparte tried to get the then unknown John James Audubon accepted by the Academy of Natural Sciences, but this was opposed by the ornithologist George Ord who disliked Audubon&#x27;s dramatic bird poses and considered him to be &quot;a back-country upstart who romanticized his subject matter,&quot; according to the Audubon Galleries.

At the end of 1826, Bonaparte and his family returned to Europe. He visited Germany, where he met Philipp Jakob Cretzschmar, and England, where he met John Edward Gray at the British Museum, and renewed his acquaintance with Audubon. In 1828, the family settled in Rome. In Italy, he was the originator of several scientific congresses, and lectured and wrote extensively on American and European ornithology and other branches of natural history. Between 1832 and 1841, Bonaparte published his work on the animals of Italy, &quot;Iconografia della Fauna Italica&quot;. He had also published &quot;Specchio Comparativo delle Ornithologie di Roma e di Filadelfia&quot; (Pisa, 1827), presenting a comparison between birds of the latitude of Philadelphia and Italian species. He created the genus &quot;Zenaida&quot;, after his wife, for the mourning dove and its relatives. He was elected a member of the American Antiquarian Society in 1845.

In 1840, he became Prince of Canino and Musignano after his father&#x27;s death and became involved in politics, particularly the anti-Austrian party that he joined in 1848. He did not, however, lose interest in his favourite studies for he organized and presided over several scientific congresses in Italy.

In 1849, he was elected to the Roman Assembly and participated in the creation of the Roman Republic. According to Jasper Ridley, when the Assembly convened for the first time: &quot;When the name of Carlo Bonaparte, who was a member for Viterbo, was called, he replied to the roll-call by calling out &quot;Long live the Republic!&quot;&quot; (&quot;Viva la Repubblica!&quot;). He participated in the defense of Rome against the 40,000 French troops sent by his cousin Louis Napoleon. He left Rome after the Republican army was defeated in July 1849. He landed at Marseilles, but was ordered to leave the country by Louis Napoleon. He reaffirmed his political beliefs the following year in naming Wilson&#x27;s bird-of-paradise (&quot;Cicinnurus respublica&quot;) in honor of the republican idea.

He travelled to the United Kingdom, attending the meeting of the British Association in Birmingham. He then visited Sir William Jardine in southern Scotland. Charles then began work on preparing a methodical classification of all the birds in the world, visiting museums across Europe to study the collections. In 1850, he was allowed to return to France and made Paris his home for the rest of his life. In 1854, he became director of the Jardin des Plantes. In 1855, he was made a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. He published the first volume of his &quot;Conspectus Generum Avium&quot; before his death, the second volume being edited by Hermann Schlegel.

Bonaparte also studied amphibians and reptiles, and is the author of &quot;Vipera ursinii&quot;, commonly known as Orsini&#x27;s viper.

Bonaparte was extremely prolific and is responsible for coining Latin names for a large number of bird species. As of August 2019, in the online list of birds maintained by Frank Gill and David Donsker on behalf of the International Ornithological Committee (IOC), Bonaparte is credited as the authority for 165 genera, 203 species and 262 subspecies. He was credited with describing a rare Australian bird, &quot;Menura alberti&quot; (Albert&#x27;s lyrebird), although this was based on a technicality as English ornithologist John Gould had previously described the bird but the supplement containing the description was published after Bonaparte had made reference to it.

Lucien Charles Bonaparte died in Paris at age 54.

<doc id="357366" wikidata="Q1616517" url="?curid=357366" title="Heuristic evaluation">
<text>A heuristic evaluation is a usability inspection method for computer software that helps to identify usability problems in the user interface design. It specifically involves evaluators examining the interface and judging its compliance with recognized usability principles (the &quot;heuristics&quot;). These evaluation methods are now widely taught and practiced in the new media sector, where user interfaces are often designed in a short space of time on a budget that may restrict the amount of money available to provide for other types of interface testing.

==Introduction==

The main goal of heuristic evaluations is to identify any problems associated with the design of user interfaces. Usability consultants Rolf Molich and Jakob Nielsen developed this method on the basis of several years of experience in teaching and consulting about usability engineering. Heuristic evaluations are one of the most informal methods of usability inspection in the field of human–computer interaction. There are many sets of usability design heuristics; they are not mutually exclusive and cover many of the same aspects of user interface design. Quite often, usability problems that are discovered are categorized—often on a numeric scale—according to their estimated impact on user performance or acceptance. Often the heuristic evaluation is conducted in the context of use cases (typical user tasks), to provide feedback to the developers on the extent to which the interface is likely to be compatible with the intended users&#x27; needs and preferences.

The simplicity of heuristic evaluation is beneficial at the early stages of design and prior to user-based testing. This usability inspection method does not rely on users which can be burdensome due to the need for recruiting, scheduling issues, a place to perform the evaluation, and a payment for participant time. In the original report published, Nielsen stated that four experiments showed that individual evaluators were &quot;mostly quite bad&quot; at doing heuristic evaluations and suggested multiple evaluators were needed, with the results aggregated, to produce and to complete an acceptable review. Most heuristic evaluations can be accomplished in a matter of days. The time required varies with the size of the artifact, its complexity, the purpose of the review, the nature of the usability issues that arise in the review, and the competence of the reviewers. Using heuristic evaluation prior to user testing is often conducted to identify areas to be included in the evaluation or to eliminate perceived design issues prior to user-based evaluation.

Although heuristic evaluation can uncover many major usability issues in a short period of time, a criticism that is often leveled is that results are highly influenced by the knowledge of the expert reviewer(s). This &quot;one-sided&quot; review repeatedly has different results than software performance testing, each type of testing uncovering a different set of problems.

== Methodology ==
Heuristic evaluation are conducted in variety of ways depending on the scope and type of project. As a general rule of thumb, there are researched frameworks involved to reduce bias and maximize findings within an evaluation. There are various pros and cons to heuristic evaluation. A lot of it depends on the amount of resources and the time available to the user. 

Pros: Because there’s a very detailed list of criteria the evaluator goes through, it is a very detailed process and provides good feedback on areas that could be improved on. In addition, since it is done by several people the designer can get feedback from multiple perspectives. As it is a relatively straightforward process, there are less ethical and logistical concerns related to organizing the evaluation and executing it. 

Cons: Since there is a specific set of criteria, the quality of the evaluation is limited by the skill and knowledge of the people who evaluate it. This leads to another issue: finding experts and people qualified enough to conduct this evaluation. However, if you have close resources of experts and qualified evaluators, this wouldn’t pose an issue. In addition, because the evaluations are more just personal observations, there’s no hard data in the results — the designer just has to take all the information and evaluations with these considerations in mind. 

=== Number of Evaluators ===
According to Nielsen, three to five evaluators are recommended within a study. Having more than five evaluators does not necessarily increase the amount of insights, and this may add more cost than benefit to the overall evaluation.

=== Individual and Group Process ===
Heuristic evaluation must start individually before aggregating results in order to reduce group confirmation bias. The evaluator should examine the prototype independently before entering group discussions to accumulate insights.

=== Observer Trade-offs ===
There are costs and benefits associated when adding an observer to an evaluation session. 

In a session without an observer, evaluators would need to formalize their individual observations within a written report as they interact with the product/prototype. This option would require more time and effort from the evaluators, and this would also require further time for the conductors of the study to interpret individual reports. However, this option is less costly because it reduces the overhead costs associated with hiring observers. 

With an observer, evaluators can provide their analysis verbally while observers transcribe and interpret the evaluators&#x27; findings. This option reduces the amount of workload from the evaluators and the amount of time needed to interpret findings from multiple evaluators.

==Nielsen&#x27;s heuristics==

Jakob Nielsen&#x27;s heuristics are probably the most-used usability heuristics for user interface design. An early version of the heuristics appeared in two papers by Nielsen and Rolf Molich published in 1989-1990. Nielsen published an updated set in 1994, and the final set still in use today was published in 2005: 

# Visibility of system status:The system should always keep users informed about what is going on, through appropriate feedback within reasonable time.
# Match between system and the real world:The system should speak the user&#x27;s language, with words, phrases and concepts familiar to the user, rather than system-oriented terms. Follow real-world conventions, making information appear in a natural and logical order.
# User control and freedom:Users often choose system functions by mistake and will need a clearly marked &quot;emergency exit&quot; to leave the unwanted state without having to go through an extended dialogue. Support undo and redo.
# Consistency and standards:Users should not have to wonder whether different words, situations, or actions mean the same thing. Follow platform conventions.
# Error prevention:Even better than good error messages is a careful design which prevents a problem from occurring in the first place. Either eliminate error-prone conditions or check for them and present users with a confirmation option before they commit to the action.
# Recognition rather than recall:Minimize the user&#x27;s memory load by making objects, actions, and options visible. The user should not have to remember information from one part of the dialogue to another. Instructions for use of the system should be visible or easily retrievable whenever appropriate.
# Flexibility and efficiency of use:Accelerators—unseen by the novice user—may often speed up the interaction for the expert user such that the system can cater to both inexperienced and experienced users. Allow users to tailor frequent actions.
# Aesthetic and minimalist design:Dialogues should not contain information which is irrelevant or rarely needed. Every extra unit of information in a dialogue competes with the relevant units of information and diminishes their relative visibility.
# Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors:Error messages should be expressed in plain language (no codes), precisely indicate the problem, and constructively suggest a solution.
# Help and documentation:Even though it is better if the system can be used without documentation, it may be necessary to provide help and documentation. Any such information should be easy to search, focused on the user&#x27;s task, list concrete steps to be carried out, and not be too large.

== Gerhardt-Powals&#x27; cognitive engineering principles ==
Although Nielsen is considered the expert and field leader in heuristic evaluation, Jill Gerhardt-Powals developed a set of cognitive engineering principles for enhancing human-computer performance. These heuristics, or principles, are similar to Nielsen&#x27;s heuristics but take a more holistic approach to evaluation. The Gerhardt Powals&#x27; principles are listed below.

# Automate unwanted workload:Eliminate mental calculations, estimations, comparisons, and any unnecessary thinking, to free cognitive resources for high-level tasks.
# Reduce uncertainty:Display data in a manner that is clear and obvious to reduce decision time and error.
# Fuse data:Bring together lower level data into a higher level summation to reduce cognitive load.
# Present new information with meaningful aids to interpretation:New information should be presented within familiar frameworks (e.g., schemas, metaphors, everyday terms) so that information is easier to absorb.
# Use names that are conceptually related to function:Display names and labels should be context-dependent, which will improve recall and recognition.
# Group data in consistently meaningful ways:Within a screen, data should be logically grouped; across screens, it should be consistently grouped. This will decrease information search time.
# Limit data-driven tasks:Use color and graphics, for example, to reduce the time spent assimilating raw data.
# Include in the displays only that information needed by the user at a given time:Exclude extraneous information that is not relevant to current tasks so that the user can focus attention on critical data.
# Provide multiple coding of data when appropriate:The system should provide data in varying formats and/or levels of detail in order to promote cognitive flexibility and satisfy user preferences.
# Practice judicious redundancy:Principle 10 was devised by the first two authors to resolve the possible conflict between Principles 6 and 8, that is, in order to be consistent, it is sometimes necessary to include more information than may be needed at a given time.

== Shneiderman&#x27;s Eight Golden Rules of Interface Design ==
Ben Shneiderman&#x27;s book was published a few years prior to Nielsen, &quot;Designing the User Interface: Strategies for Effective Human-Computer Interaction&quot; (1986) covered his popular list of the, &quot;Eight Golden Rules&quot;.

# Strive for consistency:Consistent sequences of actions should be required in similar situations ...
# Enable frequent users to use shortcuts: As the frequency of use increases, so do the user&#x27;s desires to reduce the number of interactions ...
# Offer informative feedback: For every operator action, there should be some system feedback ...
# Design dialog to yield closure: Sequences of actions should be organized into groups with a beginning, middle, and end ...
# Offer simple error handling: As much as possible, design the system so the user cannot make a serious error ...
# Permit easy reversal of actions: This feature relieves anxiety, since the user knows that errors can be undone ...
# Support internal locus of control: Experienced operators strongly desire the sense that they are in charge of the system and that the system responds to their actions. Design the system to make users the initiators of actions rather than the responders.
# Reduce short-term memory load: The limitation of human information processing in short-term memory requires that displays be kept simple, multiple page displays be consolidated, window-motion frequency be reduced, and sufficient training time be allotted for codes, mnemonics, and sequences of actions.

== Weinschenk and Barker classification ==
In 2000, Susan Weinschenk and Dean Barker created a categorization of heuristics and guidelines used by several major providers into the following twenty types:

# User Control: The interface will allow the user to perceive that they are in control and will allow appropriate control.
# Human Limitations: The interface will not overload the user’s cognitive, visual, auditory, tactile, or motor limits.
# Modal Integrity: The interface will fit individual tasks within whatever modality is being used: auditory, visual, or motor/kinesthetic.
# Accommodation: The interface will fit the way each user group works and thinks.
# Linguistic Clarity: The interface will communicate as efficiently as possible.
# Aesthetic Integrity: The interface will have an attractive and appropriate design.
# Simplicity: The interface will present elements simply.
# Predictability: The interface will behave in a manner such that users can accurately predict what will happen next.
# Interpretation: The interface will make reasonable guesses about what the user is trying to do.
# Accuracy: The interface will be free from errors.
# Technical Clarity: The interface will have the highest possible fidelity.
# Flexibility: The interface will allow the user to adjust the design for custom use.
# Fulfillment: The interface will provide a satisfying user experience.
# Cultural Propriety: The interface will match the user’s social customs and expectations.
# Suitable Tempo: The interface will operate at a tempo suitable to the user.
# Consistency: The interface will be consistent.
# User Support: The interface will provide additional assistance as needed or requested.
# Precision: The interface will allow the users to perform a task exactly.
# Forgiveness: The interface will make actions recoverable.
# Responsiveness: The interface will inform users about the results of their actions and the interface’s status.

== Domain or culture-specific heuristic evaluation ==
For an application with a specific domain and culture, the heuristics mentioned above do not identify the potential usability problems. These limitations of heuristics occur because these heuristics are incapable of considering the domain and culture-specific features of an application. This results in the introduction of domain-specific or culture-specific heuristic evaluation.

<doc id="357367" wikidata="Q506040" url="?curid=357367" title="Granny Smith">
<text>The Granny Smith is an apple cultivar that originated in Australia in 1868. It is named after Maria Ann Smith, who propagated the cultivar from a chance seedling. The tree is thought to be a hybrid of &quot;Malus sylvestris&quot;, the European wild apple, with the domesticated apple &quot;Malus domestica&quot; as the polleniser.

The fruit is hard, firm and with a light green skin and crisp, juicy flesh. The flavour is tart and acidic. It remains firm when baked, making it a popular cooking apple used in pies, where it can be sweetened. The apple goes from being completely green to turning yellow when overripe. The US Apple Association reported in 2019 that the Granny Smith was the third most popular apple in the United States.

==History==

The Granny Smith cultivar originated in Eastwood, New South Wales, Australia (now a suburb of Sydney) in 1868. Its discoverer, Maria Ann Smith (née Sherwood), had emigrated to the district from Beckley, East Sussex in 1839 with her husband Thomas. They purchased a small orchard in the area in 1855–1856 and began cultivating fruit, for which the area was a well known centre in colonial Australia. Smith had eight children and was a prominent figure in the district, earning the nickname &quot;Granny&quot; Smith in her advanced years.

The first description of the origin of the Granny Smith apple was not published until 1924. In that year, &quot;Farmer and Settler&quot; published the account of a local historian who had interviewed two men who had known Smith. One of those interviewed recalled that, in 1868, he (then twelve years old) and his father had been invited to Smith&#x27;s farm to inspect a chance seedling that had sprung near a creek. Smith had dumped there, among the ferns, the remains of French crab-apples that had been grown in Tasmania. Another story recounted that Smith had been testing French crab-apples for cooking, and, throwing the apple cores out her window as she worked, had found that the new cultivar had sprung up underneath her kitchen windowsill. Whatever the case, Smith took it upon herself to propagate the new cultivar on her property, finding the apples good for cooking and for general consumption. Having &quot;all the appearances of a cooking apple,&quot; they were not tart but instead were &quot;sweet and crisp to eat.&quot; She took a stall at Sydney&#x27;s George Street market, where the apples stored &quot;exceptionally well and became popular&quot; and &quot;once a week sold her produce there.&quot;

Smith died only a couple of years after her discovery (in 1870), but her work had been noticed by other local planters. Edward Gallard was one such planter, who extensively planted Granny Smith trees on his property and bought the Smith farm when Thomas died in 1876. Gallard was successful in marketing the apple locally, but it did not receive widespread attention until 1890. In that year, it was exhibited as &quot;Smith&#x27;s Seedling&quot; at the Castle Hill Agricultural and Horticultural Show, and the following year it won the prize for cooking apples under the name &quot;&quot;Granny&quot; Smith&#x27;s Seedling.&quot; The apple was so highly successful that the following year, many were exhibiting Granny Smith apples at horticultural shows.

In 1895, the New South Wales Department of Agriculture recognised the cultivar and had begun growing the trees at the Government Experimental Station in Bathurst, New South Wales, recommending the gazette of its properties as a late-picking cooking apple for potential export. Over the following years the government actively promoted the apple, leading to its widespread adoption. Its worldwide fame grew from the fact that it could be picked from March and stored till November. Enterprising fruit merchants in the 1890s and the 1900s experimented with methods to transport the apples overseas in cold storage. Because of its excellent shelf life, the Granny Smith could be exported long distances and most times of the year, at a time when Australian food exports were growing dramatically on the back of international demand. Granny Smiths were exported in enormous quantities after the First World War, and by 1975, 40 percent of Australia&#x27;s apple crop was Granny Smith.
By this time, it was being grown intensely elsewhere in the Southern Hemisphere, as well as in France and the United States. The advent of the Granny Smith apple is now celebrated annually in Eastwood with the Granny Smith Festival.

==Uses==
===Culinary===

Granny Smith apples are light green in colour. The tart flavor of these apples makes them one of the most versatile varieties of apple to cook with. They are popularly used in many apple dishes, such as apple pie, apple cobbler, apple crumble, and apple cake. They are also commonly eaten raw as table apples, and at least one company (Woodchuck Hard Cider) makes Granny Smith varietal cider.

==Properties==
It is moderately susceptible to fire blight and is very prone to scab, powdery mildew, and cedar apple rust.

Granny Smith is much more easily preserved in storage than other apples, a factor which has greatly contributed to its success in export markets. Its long storage life has been attributed to its fairly low levels of ethylene production, and in the right conditions Granny Smiths can be stored without loss of quality for as long as a year. This cultivar needs fewer winter chill hours and a longer season to mature the fruit, so it is favoured for the milder areas of the apple growing regions. However, they are susceptible to superficial scald and bitter pit. Superficial scald may be controlled by treatment with diphenylamine before storage. It can also be controlled with low-oxygen storage. Pit can be controlled with calcium sprays during the growing season and with postharvest calcium dips.

According to the US Apple Association website, it is one of the fifteen most popular apple cultivars in the United States.

==Cultural references==
In 1968, the rock band The Beatles used an image of a Granny Smith apple as the logo for their corporation, Apple Corps Limited. For their record label, Apple Records, one side of vinyl albums featured the exterior of the fruit, while the other side of the recording featured a cross-section of the apple.

Yoko Ono&#x27;s 1966 artwork &quot;Apple&quot; used a Granny Smith apple in its 2015 recreation at New York City&#x27;s Museum of Modern Art. John Lennon had taken a bite from the apple on display in its 1966 incarnation at the Indica Gallery in London.

The Granny Smith was one of four apples honored by the United States Postal Service in a 2013 set of four 33¢ stamps commemorating historic strains, joined by Northern Spy, Baldwin, and Golden Delicious.

<doc id="357371" wikidata="Q5273779" url="?curid=357371" title="Dickson's lemma">
<text>In mathematics, Dickson&#x27;s lemma states that every set of formula_1-tuples of natural numbers has finitely many minimal elements. This simple fact from combinatorics has become attributed to the American algebraist L. E. Dickson, who used it to prove a result in number theory about perfect numbers. However, the lemma was certainly known earlier, for example to Paul Gordan in his research on invariant theory.

==Example==

Let formula_2 be a fixed natural number, and let formula_3 be the set of pairs of numbers whose product is at least formula_2. When defined over the positive real numbers, formula_5 has infinitely many minimal elements of the form formula_6, one for each positive number formula_7; this set of points forms one of the branches of a hyperbola. The pairs on this hyperbola are minimal, because it is not possible for a different pair that belongs to formula_5 to be less than or equal to formula_6 in both of its coordinates. However, Dickson&#x27;s lemma concerns only tuples of natural numbers, and over the natural numbers there are only finitely many minimal pairs. Every minimal pair formula_10 of natural numbers has formula_11 and formula_12, for if &quot;x&quot; were greater than &quot;K&quot; then (&quot;x&quot; − 1, &quot;y&quot;) would also belong to &quot;S&quot;, contradicting the minimality of (&quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;), and symmetrically if &quot;y&quot; were greater than &quot;K&quot; then (&quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot; − 1) would also belong to &quot;S&quot;. Therefore, over the natural numbers, formula_5 has at most formula_14 minimal elements, a finite number.

==Formal statement==
Let formula_15 be the set of non-negative integers (natural numbers), let &quot;n&quot; be any fixed constant, and let formula_16 be the set of formula_1-tuples of natural numbers. These tuples may be given a pointwise partial order, the product order, in which formula_18 if and only if formula_19 for every formula_20.
The set of tuples that are greater than or equal to some particular tuple formula_21 forms a positive orthant with its apex at the given tuple.

With this notation, Dickson&#x27;s lemma may be stated in several equivalent forms:
*In every non-empty subset formula_5 of formula_16 there is at least one but no more than a finite number of elements that are minimal elements of formula_5 for the pointwise partial order.
*For every infinite sequence formula_25 of formula_1-tuples of natural numbers, there exist two indices formula_27 such that formula_28 holds with respect to the pointwise order.
*The partially ordered set formula_29 does not contain infinite antichains nor infinite (strictly) descending sequences of formula_1-tuples.
*The partially ordered set formula_29 is a well partial order.
*Every subset formula_5 of formula_16 may be covered by a finite set of positive orthants, whose apexes all belong to formula_5.

==Generalizations and applications==
Dickson used his lemma to prove that, for any given number formula_1, there can exist only a finite number of odd perfect numbers that have at most formula_1 prime factors. However, it remains open whether there exist any odd perfect numbers at all.

The divisibility relation among the &quot;P&quot;-smooth numbers, natural numbers whose prime factors all belong to the finite set &quot;P&quot;, gives these numbers the structure of a partially ordered set isomorphic to formula_37. Thus, for any set &quot;S&quot; of &quot;P&quot;-smooth numbers, there is a finite subset of &quot;S&quot; such that every element of &quot;S&quot; is divisible by one of the numbers in this subset. This fact has been used, for instance, to show that there exists an algorithm for classifying the winning and losing moves from the initial position in the game of Sylver coinage, even though the algorithm itself remains unknown.

The tuples formula_21 in formula_16 correspond one-for-one with the monomials formula_40 over a set of formula_1 variables formula_42. Under this correspondence, Dickson&#x27;s lemma may be seen as a special case of Hilbert&#x27;s basis theorem stating that every polynomial ideal has a finite basis, for the ideals generated by monomials. Indeed, Paul Gordan used this restatement of Dickson&#x27;s lemma in 1899 as part of a proof of Hilbert&#x27;s basis theorem.

<doc id="357375" wikidata="Q332374" url="?curid=357375" title="Liam Fox">
<text>Sir Liam Fox (born 22 September 1961) is a British politician who served as Secretary of State for International Trade from 2016 to 2019 and Secretary of State for Defence from 2010 to 2011. A member of the Conservative Party, he was the Member of Parliament (MP) for North Somerset, formerly Woodspring, from 1992 to 2024.

Fox studied medicine at the University of Glasgow and worked as a GP and civilian army medical GP before being elected as an MP. After holding several ministerial roles under John Major, Fox served as Constitutional Affairs Spokesman from 1998 to 1999, Shadow Health Secretary from 1999 to 2003, Chair of the Conservative Party from 2003 to 2005, Shadow Foreign Secretary in 2005 and Shadow Defence Secretary from 2005 to 2010.

In the 2009 expenses scandal, he was the Shadow Cabinet minister found to have the largest over-claim on expenses and, as a result, was forced to repay the most money. In 2010, he was appointed Defence Secretary by Prime Minister David Cameron, a position from which he resigned on 14 October 2011 over allegations that he had given a close friend, lobbyist Adam Werritty, inappropriate access to the Ministry of Defence and allowed him to join official trips overseas.

In July 2016, in the wake of the United Kingdom&#x27;s vote to leave the European Union, Fox was appointed the first Secretary of State for International Trade by new Prime Minister Theresa May. He was also made President of the Board of Trade. Fox has twice stood unsuccessfully for the leadership of the Conservative Party, in 2005 and 2016. In July 2019, he lost his cabinet position when new Prime Minister Boris Johnson appointed his cabinet.

He was knighted in the 2023 Political Honours for public and political service.

==Early life and education==
Liam Fox was born and raised in a Roman Catholic family of Irish heritage in East Kilbride, Scotland, and brought up in a council house that his parents later bought. His great-uncle, John Fox, was the Labour Provost of Motherwell, with most of his family being Labour supporters.

Along with his brother and two sisters, he was educated in the state sector, attending St Bride&#x27;s High School (now part of St Andrew&#x27;s and St Bride&#x27;s High School) in East Kilbride. He then studied medicine at the University of Glasgow, graduating with a MB ChB in 1983. Fox is a former general practitioner (he was a GP in Beaconsfield, Buckinghamshire, before his election to Parliament), a former Civilian Army General Practitioner and Divisional Surgeon with St John Ambulance. 

==Parliamentary career==
At the 1987 general election, Fox stood as the Conservative Party candidate in Roxburgh and Berwickshire, coming second with 37.2% of the vote behind the Liberal Party candidate Archy Kirkwood. 

Fox was first elected to Parliament as MP for Woodspring at the 1992 general election with 54.5% of the vote and a majority of 17,509.

In June 1993, Fox was appointed Parliamentary private secretary to the Home Secretary, Michael Howard. Thereafter, in July 1994, he was appointed an Assistant Government Whip. Following a limited government reshuffle in November 1995, he was appointed a Lord Commissioner of Treasury – a Senior Government Whip. He was Parliamentary under-secretary of state at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office from 1996 to 1997.

In 1996, he brokered an accord in Sri Lanka, called the Fox Peace Plan, between Chandrika Kumaratunga&#x27;s PA and the opposition UNP of Ranil Wickremasinghe, on a bipartisan approach for ending the ethnic war. In 2001, Jonathan Goodhand wrote, &quot;However, little has happened since then to suggest that the various parties would have acted in good faith in the interests of peace.&quot;

Fox was re-elected as MP for Woodspring at the 1997 general election with a decreased vote share of 44.4% and a decreased majority of 7,734.
In June 1997, Fox was appointed Opposition Front Bench Spokesman on Constitutional Affairs and joined the Shadow Cabinet in 1998 as the principal spokesman for Constitutional Affairs. Between 1999 and 2003, he was the Shadow Secretary of State for Health.

At the 2001 general election, Fox was again re-elected, with a decreased vote share of 43.7% and an increased majority of 8,798.

In November 2003, Fox was appointed campaign manager for Michael Howard following the no-confidence vote against the Conservative&#x27;s party leader, Iain Duncan Smith. Fox became co-chairman of the party following Michael Howard&#x27;s elevation to the post of party leader in November 2003. 

Fox voted for the 2003 invasion of Iraq. As Shadow Defence Secretary he supported the Government&#x27;s position of maintaining British troops in Iraq until the security situation allowed for a withdrawal of troops but was critical of the lack of post-invasion planning and poor equipment initially provided to British troops. He supported the idea of the American Surgel, believing that it was successful, and visited Iraq several times as Shadow Defence Secretary.

Fox was again re-elected at the 2005 general election, with a decreased vote share of 41.8% and a decreased majority of 6,016. After the general election he was promoted within the Shadow Cabinet to become Shadow Foreign Secretary. 

In September 2005, Fox announced he would join the contest to be the next leader of the Conservative party. His campaign theme for the leadership race was based on the &quot;broken society&quot; theme, which he said Conservatives could address by returning the emphasis to marriage and reforming welfare. In the initial ballot of Conservative MPs, on 18 October 2005, he gained enough support (42 votes) to enter the second ballot two days later. He was eliminated in the second ballot with 51 votes in third place behind David Cameron (90 votes) and David Davis (57 votes). Cameron, who eventually won the leadership election, gave Fox the role of Shadow Defence Secretary.

In February 2008, Fox spoke in the House of Commons in opposition to the defence provisions in the Lisbon Treaty. 

Fox has been an outspoken supporter of the war in Afghanistan and the British presence there. In 2009, he was critical towards some NATO partners for not contributing enough to the effort in the more dangerous southern and eastern parts of Afghanistan.

Prior to the 2010 general election, Fox&#x27;s constituency of Woodspring was abolished, and replaced with North Somerset. At the general election, Fox was elected as MP for North Somerset with 49.3% of the vote and a majority of 7,862.

On 5 February 2013, Fox voted against a second reading of the Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Bill, designed to introduce same-sex marriage in the United Kingdom. He described David Cameron&#x27;s plans to legalise same-sex marriage as &quot;divisive, ill thought through and constitutionally wrong&quot;, arguing that redefining marriage for the majority to satisfy a &quot;small, yet vocal, minority&quot; was not a good basis for a stable, tolerant society.

Fox was re-elected as MP for North Somerset at the 2015 general election with an increased vote share of 53.5% and an increased majority of 23,099.

In late June 2016, Fox announced on LBC that he intended to run for the leadership of the Conservative party once again, after David Cameron resigned following the result of the EU referendum, in which Fox supported leaving the EU. During the announcement of his candidacy, he said that the UK should trigger Article 50 by the end of 2016 so it could leave the EU by 2019, specifying 1 January 2019 as the date on which the UK should leave. He stated that he would not allow freedom of movement to be considered as part of any alternative trade arrangement with the EU. Fox promised to increase defence spending, stating that he would particularly like to see &quot;an increase in the size of the Navy and our cyber capability&quot;. He also promised to scrap HS2, spending the £55 billion set aside for the project on regional train lines, cut taxes, cut welfare spending, create a new governmental department for &quot;trade and foreign affairs&quot; and review the aid budget. Fox was eliminated in the first ballot, finishing in last place with 16 votes. Theresa May went on to win the leadership and become Prime Minister and gave Fox the job of International Trade Secretary.

At the snap 2017 general election, Fox was again re-elected, with an increased vote share of 54.2% and a decreased majority of 17,103. He was again re-elected at the 2019 general election, with a decreased vote share of 52.9% and an increased majority of 17,536.

On 8 July 2020, the UK government nominated Fox as a candidate for Director-General of the World Trade Organisation. Fox&#x27;s main rival for the nomination, the Labour peer Peter Mandelson, was overlooked due to his opposition to Brexit. Fox progressed to the second round of the selection process. He did not become one of the two candidates to enter the final round, who were South Korea&#x27;s Yoo Myung-hee and Nigeria&#x27;s Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, and was knocked out on 7 October.

In 2021 Fox was the sponsor of a Down Syndrome Bill, an Act to &quot;make provision about meeting the needs of persons with Down syndrome.&quot;

In the 2024 general election Fox was defeated by the Labour candidate, Sadik Al-Hassan.

==Secretary of State for Defence==

Fox was appointed as Secretary of State for Defence in the cabinet of David Cameron on 12 May 2010. 

In July 2010, he said that the dire state of the public finances meant the Armed Forces could no longer be equipped to cover every conceivable danger. He said that the strongest signal that it will have to give up one or more of these capabilities, which have been maintained at the same time as contributing to collective security pacts such as NATO. &quot;We don&#x27;t have the money as a country to protect ourselves against every potential future threat,&quot; he said. &quot;We have to look at where we think the real risks will come from, where the real threats will come from and we need to deal with that accordingly. The Russians are not going to come over the European plain any day soon,&quot; he added. Fox&#x27;s admission cast doubt on the future of the 25,000 troops currently stationed in Germany. The Defence Secretary had previously said that he hoped to withdraw them at some point, leaving Britain without a presence in the country for the first time since 1945.

The Ministry of Defence (MoD) faced budget cuts of up to 8% over the next five years, according to some analysts, and the department was grappling with a £37 billion shortfall on programmes it has signed up to. The results of the Strategic Defence and Security Review (SDSR) were published on 19 October 2010. Speaking in September 2010 at a meeting in Paris with his French counterpart Hervé Morin on the possibility of sharing aircraft carriers with the French Navy, Fox said, &quot;I think it is unrealistic to share an aircraft carrier but, in other areas like tactical lift we can see what we can do.&quot; He added: &quot;I can&#x27;t deny that there is an element of urgency added by budget concerns.&quot;
In September 2010, in a private letter to David Cameron, Fox refused to back any &quot;draconian cuts&quot; in the Armed Forces at a time when Britain was at war. The letter was written the night before a National Security Council (NSC) meeting on the Strategic Defence and Security Review (SDSR). In the letter, Fox wrote that: &quot;Frankly this process is looking less and less defensible as a proper SDSR (Strategic Defence and Strategy Review) and more like a &#x27;super CSR&#x27; (Comprehensive Spending Review). If it continues on its current trajectory it is likely to have grave political consequences for us&quot;. Fox continued saying that &quot;Our decisions today will limit severely the options available to this and all future governments. The range of operations that we can do today we will simply not be able to do in the future. In particular, it would place at risk.&quot;

In February 2011, Fox criticised &quot;ballooning&quot; spending in his own department. The top 15 major procurement projects were running at £8.8 billion over budget and, between them, were delayed by a total of 32 years. That included the A400M transporter aircraft order that was £603 million over budget and six years behind schedule. Fox criticised what he called a &quot;conspiracy of optimism based on poor cost-estimation, unrealistic timescales&quot; at the MoD and in industry. &quot;These practices in the MOD would simply not be tolerated in the private sector, and they will no longer be tolerated in the MoD.&quot;

In March 2011, Fox defended the decision to make 11,000 redundancies in the armed forces, insisting that personnel who have recently returned from Afghanistan would not be sacked. Cameron had conceded that axing around 5,000 personnel from the army, 3,300 from the Navy and 2,700 from the RAF will be &quot;difficult&quot; for those affected. Strategic Defence and Security Review (SDSR) set out plans for reducing the size of the armed forces by 17,000 in total. Some of that number would be met by not replacing people who were retiring or leaving for other reasons. Defence officials said 11,000 personnel still faced being redundant on a compulsory or voluntary basis. Fox said it was essential that service personnel were made &quot;fully aware of the options available and the time-scales involved&quot;. &quot;That means that a timetable needs to be adhered to for the sake of themselves and their families,&quot; he said. &quot;It would simply be wrong to alter that timetable for the convenience of the Government.&quot;

In light of the 2011 Libyan civil war, Fox warned that Libya could end up split in two as Muammar Gaddafi unleashed the full fury of his military arsenal, sending warplanes and ground troops to attack rebel-held positions across the country. &quot;We could see the Gaddafi forces centred around Tripoli,&quot; Fox said. &quot;We could see a de facto partition of the country.&quot;

In May 2011, Fox opposed plans to sharply increase Britain&#x27;s aid budget, in a direct challenge to David Cameron&#x27;s authority. In a leaked letter to the Prime Minister, Fox said he could not accept plans to increase the development budget to 0.7 percent of the gross domestic product. The aid pledge, made in the Conservative election manifesto last year, was at the heart of Cameron&#x27;s attempts to change his party&#x27;s image. It has gained opponents among right-wing Tories, many of whom voted for Fox when he fought Cameron for the party leadership in 2005. &quot;I cannot support the proposal in its current form,&quot; Fox told the Prime Minister. Fox suggested that development funding should be diverted to the defence budget, writing that reneging on the aid pledge would release more public money to be spent on &quot;other activities or programmes rather than aid&quot;. The &quot;Telegraph&quot; James Kirkup said the leak was increasing suspicion among Cameron&#x27;s allies that the Defence Secretary was trying to undermine the Prime Minister.

After negative comments by Sir Simon Bryant and Sir Mark Stanhope, Secretary Fox said admirals and air marshals who have voiced concerns were giving strength to Muammar Gaddafi&#x27;s regime. He also warned that high-ranking members of the Armed Forces were facing the sack because the Government wanted to reduce bureaucracy by cutting &quot;the star count&quot;. &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; had learned that the redundancies would include up 500 starred officers, equivalent to the rank of an Army brigadier and above. Fox said: &quot;We must be very careful, those of us who have authority in defence, when discussing the sustainability of a mission. People&#x27;s lives are at stake and there can only be one message that goes out on Libya.&quot; Admiral Sir John &quot;Sandy&quot; Woodward, a former deputy chief of the defence staff, suggested Fox was trying to blame military chiefs for &quot;his own failings&quot;. He said: &quot;Of course the service chiefs should not be talking outside the MoD, but when politicians have got it so wrong they have no other choice.&quot;

===Levene report===

On 27 June 2011, Fox announced that Baron Levene had completed his report on the reform of the MoD which suggested that they could cut the number of senior officers and could also lead to ministerial posts being axed. The army, navy and air force would each be run by a single chief. Currently, the services have two commanders, one in charge of strategy, the second in charge of day-to-day operations. The reforms would see operational control pushed down the chain of command. In addition, the three service chiefs will be removed from the defence board, a powerful committee the defence secretary chairs. The overall head of the military, the chief of the defence staff, currently, General Sir David Richards, will represent them. A committee chaired by an independent non-executive director, chosen by the defence secretary, will be in charge of appointments to the services&#x27; top ranks. The MoD is expected to axe up to 8,000 civil servants in 2012. Senior commanders would be given more overall control of their budgets and internal appointments.

The report also suggested that a new Joint Forces Command structure should be created with senior appointments in the MoD lasting longer than every two years by making sure people stay in post for longer. Levene said that &quot;finance and the need for affordability are not regarded as sufficiently important throughout the organisation.&quot; He said that the &quot;lack of trust&quot; which pervades the MoD has led to a tendency for those at the top to try to micromanage, while the individual services look out for themselves rather than thinking of defence as a whole. This has led to a &quot;predisposition to overcomplicate ... and a culture of reinventing the wheel&quot;. The role of the chief of the defence staff should also be enhanced so that &quot;he alone will be responsible for representing the military voice.&quot; Levene says that the new defence board &quot;should be the primary decision-making body for non-operational matters&quot;, and should meet 10 times a year. It will have nine members, but only one will be from the military, the chief of the defence staff, currently General Sir David Richards.

===Defence and Security Review===

In a speech on the future of the Armed Forces to the House of Commons on 19 October 2010 Prime Minister David Cameron set out plans that would mean cuts: 7,000 jobs go in the British Army; 5,000 in the Royal Navy; 5,000 in the Royal Air Force; and 25,000 civilian jobs at the Ministry of Defence. In terms of equipment, the RAF would lose the Nimrod reconnaissance aircraft programme, the entire Harrier fleet would be scrapped, and bases will be turned over to the Army. The Army will have its tanks and heavy artillery cut by 40%, and half of the soldiers in Germany will return to the UK by 2015, with the rest brought home by 2030 and housed in former RAF bases. The Navy would have its destroyer and frigate fleet cut from 23 to 19 (by cutting the Type 22 frigates) and will be provided with less expensive frigates. It will be affected by the loss of the Harriers. Overall, the defence budget was to be cut by 8% but Cameron insisted that Britain would continue to meet the NATO target of spending 2% of GDP on defence.

In the same speech Cameron announced a national cyber security programme, costing £500 million, &quot;to fix shortfalls in cyber infrastructure&quot;, while more focus will be given to tackling terrorists such as Al Qaeda and dissident Irish republicans in what he said would be &quot;continuing investment in our world class intelligence agencies&quot;. Army numbers will fall to 95,500 by 2015 – 7,000 fewer than today – but ground forces will continue to have vital operational role in the future, he said.

===Resignation===
It was revealed that Fox&#x27;s close friend, best man and former business partner Adam Werritty had made visits to Fox at the Ministry of Defence (MoD) in Whitehall on 22 occasions in 16 months; Werritty was not security-cleared with the MoD. Additionally, over a 17-month period, ending October 2011, Werritty was present at 40 of Fox&#x27;s 70 recorded engagements. The uncertain nature of Werritty&#x27;s relationship with Fox led to an investigation by senior civil servants, initially the MoD&#x27;s Permanent Secretary, Ursula Brennan and latterly the Cabinet Secretary Sir Gus O&#x27;Donnell. Fox said that Werrity had never worked for him either in an official or unofficial capacity despite allegations that Fox was using a source of advice outside the Civil Service, paid for by private funds, allegedly a private intelligence firm. Disclosure of increasing amounts of detail of their contact, funding and explanations of their relationship led to Fox&#x27;s resignation on 14 October 2011 in advance of O&#x27;Donnell&#x27;s report of his investigation into Fox breaking the Ministerial code by letting his friend Adam Werritty into defence meetings.

The Cabinet Secretary&#x27;s investigation into the incident concluded that Fox&#x27;s conduct constituted a &quot;clear breach of the Ministerial code&quot; and that his actions posed a &quot;security risk&quot;.

==Secretary of State for International Trade==
After Theresa May became Prime Minister of the United Kingdom in July 2016, Fox was appointed Secretary of State for International Trade, responsible for helping to secure trade deals with other countries following Brexit.

&quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; reported Fox as saying he would prefer a free trade agreement with the EU rather than be part of the EU customs union, which he said could restrict Britain&#x27;s ability to negotiate lower tariffs with other trading partners.

In a September 2016 speech on international trade, Fox said there needed to be a change in British business culture, arguing that exporting was a &quot;duty&quot; which companies neglected because &quot;it might be too difficult or too time-consuming or because they can&#x27;t play golf on a Friday afternoon&quot;. In April 2017, he was criticised for a trade visit to the Philippines, where he acknowledged &quot;shared values&quot; when speaking to Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte, heavily criticised for the increase in extrajudicial killings in the Philippines.

In 2017, Fox announced a new board of trade which would meet four times a year to &quot;ensure the benefits of free trade are spread throughout the UK.&quot; The announcement was criticised by Liberal Democrat MP Tom Brake, who said the board was a &quot;job-creation scheme&quot; for Fox. A DIT spokesman said it was a &quot;technicality&quot; that Fox was the sole member of the board, because of a constitutional convention that full membership is only for privy counsellors. In July 2019, he lost his cabinet position when new Prime Minister Boris Johnson made a cabinet reshuffle.

==Political positions==

===Finances===
Fox was a registered shareholder of the medical educational firm Arrest Ltd which was dissolved in 2010. 

Fox accepted a £50,000 donation from Jon Moulton, whose investment firm, Better Capital, later went on to own Gardner Aerospace, an aerospace metallic manufactured details supplier which includes component parts for both military and civilian aircraft. This potentially exposed Fox to conflict of interest but neither Fox nor Moulton violated any rules with this donation.

In 2023 the Good Law Project revealed that Fox had personally received a £10,000 cash donation in January 2023 by Aquind, a British cabling company controlled by Russian oil tycoon Viktor Fedotov, further fuelling ongoing investigation into Tory funds given by Russian donors.

===Bahrain===
In March 2013, Fox was one of the chief guests at a conference in Bahrain designed to rally Western opinion to the side of the Bahrain government in its struggle against the Arab Spring. In August 2014, Fox argued that the UK should start bombing Islamist extremists in northern Iraq. The following month this became government policy.

=== Brexit ===
Fox supported Brexit at the EU Referendum 2016, and is a self-proclaimed &quot;staunch Eurosceptic&quot;. Following this assertion, he stated that he wants a &quot;clean break&quot; from Brussels, in order to regain &quot;national sovereignty&quot;. In July 2019 he acknowledged that no deal could lead to the breakup of the United Kingdom.

In March 2018, Fox said that he would &quot;no longer support&quot; an extension to the EU transition period. He had previously said that a post-Brexit trade deal &quot;should be the easiest in human history&quot;. By July 2019 he recognised that a deal with the US would &quot;take time&quot; and that despite reaching &quot;above 99% of agreement&quot; on a deal based on Canada&#x27;s existing deal with the EU, the Canadians were now looking at the zero-tariff access being promised in the event of no deal.

On 30 November 2018, he came out in support for Theresa May&#x27;s Brexit deal, calling it the best possible deal that safely delivers Brexit.

=== Afghanistan ===
In July 2010, Fox said that an early withdrawal of coalition troops from Afghanistan would risk a return of civil war and act as a &quot;shot in the arm to jihadists&quot; across the world. In marked contrast to David Cameron, who pledged to withdraw all British troops by 2015, Fox said Britain would be betraying the sacrifices of its fallen soldiers if it left &quot;before the job is finished&quot;. British forces would be among the last to leave Afghanistan, he added, because they are stationed in Helmand, one of the most dangerous provinces in the country. He said that &quot;Were we to leave prematurely, without degrading the insurgency and increasing the capability of the Afghan national security forces, we could see the return of the destructive forces of transnational terror ... Not only would we risk the return of civil war in Afghanistan, creating a security vacuum, but we would also risk the destabilisation of Pakistan with potentially unthinkable regional, and possibly nuclear, consequences.&quot;

In July 2010, it was reported that 1,000 Royal Marines were expected to leave and be redeployed to central Helmand by the end of 2010. Fox told MPs that UK forces had made &quot;good progress&quot; in Sangin, but the move would enable Britain to provide &quot;more manpower and greater focus&quot; on Helmand&#x27;s busy central belt, leaving the north and south to the US. &quot;The result will be a coherent and equitable division of the main populated areas of Helmand between three brigade-sized forces, with the US in the north and the south, and the UK-led Task Force Helmand, alongside our outstanding Danish and Estonian allies, in the central population belt,&quot; he told the House of Commons.

On 19 July 2010, Fox said that within four years the Afghan army and police should take responsibility for security, leaving British troops to work only as military trainers. The date is a full year earlier than the deadline suggested by David Cameron this month, who said he wanted most troops back by 2015. Fox said: &quot;It has always been our aim to be successful in the mission and the mission has always said that the Afghan national security forces would be able to deal with their own security by 2014. We recognise that there will be further work to do in terms of training and improving the quality of those forces beyond that, which is why we have said training forces may be available after that date. But we have made it very clear that that will not be combat forces.&quot;

===NATO===

He has very strong Atlanticist views. He believes that NATO is the cornerstone of the United Kingdom and Europe&#x27;s defence and that NATO must have primacy over the European Union including the right of first refusal for all matters relating to the defence of continental Europe. He has been critical of the common funding mechanism within NATO and has called for a system to be used that allows for more proportionate burden sharing between NATO member states for NATO led military operations.

===European Union===

He is considered to be staunchly Eurosceptic and opposed to European defence integration as well as European political integration. He is opposed to the European Commission having any role in defence policy. He believes that the European Security and Defence Policy duplicates and takes away scarce national resources from NATO. 

===Abortion===
Fox is critical of abortion and has called for &quot;huge restriction, if not abolition&quot; on the UK&#x27;s &quot;pro-abortion laws&quot;. In an interview with &quot;Morgan and Platell&quot;, Fox elaborated on these views, stating that he would &quot;like to see [abortion limits] brought down...well below 20 weeks; I&#x27;d like to see us look at limits more akin to some of the European countries at 12 or 14 weeks.&quot;

He went on to state that &quot;a society that actually aborts 180,000 unborn children every year is a society that needs to be asking a lot of questions about itself. For me, it&#x27;s a simple personal belief. It says, &quot;thou shall not kill&quot;, it doesn&#x27;t say, thou shall not kill unless Parliament says it&#x27;s OK. For the same reason I&#x27;m against the death penalty. However, I do accept...that if the majority of the population decide that it&#x27;s something they find acceptable, I&#x27;ve got to live with that. But I&#x27;m not going to be quiet and I&#x27;m not going to pretend that my views are other than they are for the sake of political convenience.&quot;

===Military welfare===
Fox has stated on a number of occasions that the Military Covenant is broken and that the British Armed Forces are being asked to do too much for what they are resourced to do.

Along with the leader of the Conservative Party, David Cameron, he established the Military Covenant Commission headed by Frederick Forsyth with the aim of finding ways to improve the welfare of service members, veterans, and their families under a future Conservative Government. Fox has a particular interest in mental health issues and has criticised Gordon Brown&#x27;s Labour Government for failing to adequately address the problem.

===Israel===
Fox is a supporter of Israel and is a member of Conservative Friends of Israel. In 2006 he said, &quot;Israel&#x27;s enemies are our enemies and this is a battle in which we all stand together or we will all fall divided.&quot; &quot;The Jewish Chronicle&quot; has called Fox a &quot;champion of Israel&quot; while in government. In January 2009, referring to Israel, he also said, &quot;British support for any ally is never unqualified. International law and values must always be obeyed.&quot; In May 2011, Fox was booed at the &quot;We Believe in Israel&quot; event for saying that Israeli settlements &quot;are illegal and an obstacle to peace&quot;.

===US–UK relations===

He is a strong believer in the Special Relationship between the United Kingdom and the United States. He was the UK Director and founding member of The Atlantic Bridge, a UK-based charity that aims to preserve and promote the Special Relationship. The Atlantic Bridge closed down in October 2011 after being told to cease activities by the Charity Commission for &quot;promoting a political policy [that] is closely associated with the Conservative Party&quot;.

Fox was able to retain a good relationship with the administration of George W. Bush, despite a five-year breakdown in relations between the Conservative and Republican parties over the Iraq War. He led the Conservative delegation to the 2008 Republican National Convention. In 2018, he commented that the 25% tariffs imposed by the United States on imported EU steel were &quot;patently absurd.&quot;

Fox criticised protesters against Donald Trump&#x27;s visit to the UK in 2018, calling them a &quot;embarrassment to themselves&quot;.

===Freedom of the press===
In October 2013, Fox called for &quot;The Guardian&quot; newspaper to face prosecution over the 2013 mass surveillance disclosures.

In January 2015, Fox published a video on YouTube detailing his opinions and criticism of Edward Snowden. He stated: &quot;We&#x27;re constantly having to protect our society from a range of threats, especially organised crime, paedophilia, and terrorism. For our intelligence services to operate effectively, and to protect us from these threats, they need to be able to do things in secret, secrets whose public disclosure would be damaging to our National Interest. When Edward Snowden stole files and took them with him to China and then Russia, some 58,000 files came from GCHQ, information that had played a vital role in preventing terrorist outrages in Britain, over the past decade and longer. It was not freedom fighting. We should call treason by its name. And those who assisted Snowden must be held responsible for their actions.&quot;

===National Health Service===
In January 2014, Fox stated that ring-fenced funding for the NHS should end, stating: &quot;The increase [in spending] over the last decade has been phenomenal and yet a lot of our health indicators lag behind other countries, particular things like stroke outcome or a lot of cancer outcomes.&quot;

===Syria===
Fox was disappointed that Parliament voted not to take military action over the use of chemical weapons in Syria. Fox was critical of Cameron&#x27;s strategy and performance for that debate, and stated &quot;There was no need to seek parliamentary approval for any military action, as constitutional authority lies with the government.&quot; He later took the view that there were no easy answers to the Syrian civil war and the prospect of the Assad government surviving should be considered. Fox argued that bombing attacks against ISIL in Iraq should be extended into Syria, and safe havens should be created in Syria by military intervention.

=== Western Sahara ===
In January 2024, Fox publicly expressed his support for Morocco and its Western Sahara Autonomy Proposal in the Western Sahara conflict, and called on the government to officially recognise Morocco&#x27;s claim to the territory, as the United States had done in 2020 in exchange for the Israel–Morocco normalization agreement.

===Expenses===
In March 2010, Fox appealed Sir Thomas Legg&#x27;s decision that he had overclaimed £22,476 in mortgage interest payments. Fox immediately repaid the money, then appealed the decision. Fox&#x27;s appeal was rejected and the decision was upheld by Sir Paul Kennedy, a former high court judge. Fox stated that his decision to remortgage his second home to pay for redecorations and claim the higher interest repayments on his expenses represented value for money because he could have charged the taxpayer for the decorating bills directly. In his response, Sir Paul Kennedy stated: &quot;What you claimed was not recoverable under the rules then in force. I entirely accept that, like many others, you could have made other claims if the fees office had rejected your claims for mortgage interest, and that you may well have spent some of what you raised by increasing your mortgage on your constituency home, but the evidence is imprecise, and my terms of reference only allow me to interfere if I find special reasons in your individual case showing that it would not be fair and equitable to require repayment, either at all or at the level recommended.&quot; This reportedly made him the Conservative Shadow Cabinet member with the largest over-claim on expenses, and as a result, he has been forced to repay the most money.

It was reported in June 2009 that Fox claimed expenses of more than £19,000 over the previous four years for his mobile phone. Fox stated that the high bill was due to regular trips overseas, in his capacity as Shadow Defence Secretary and said he was looking for a cheaper tariff.

In October 2012, the Commons Speaker blocked the release of data showing which MPs were renting their homes to other MPs for financial gain. However, a study of parliamentary records was published in &quot;the Daily Telegraph&quot;. The study showed that Liam Fox receives rental income from his London home while simultaneously claiming rental income from the taxpayer to live at another residence.

In October 2013, documents showed that Fox claimed 3p for a 100 metre car trip a year earlier. He also made an additional 15 claims under £1 for car travel approved in 2012–13, two of which were for 24p and 44p. He told the &quot;Sunday People&quot;: &quot;I don&#x27;t do my expenses. My office does them. But they are all done according to the rules for travel distances.&quot;

===Breaches of parliamentary rules===
In March 2010, Fox admitted breaking parliamentary rules on two occasions by visiting Sri Lanka on a trip paid for by the Sri Lankan government without declaring the trip in the Register of Members&#x27; Financial Interests in the required time of 30 days and failing to declare an interest in Sri Lanka when asking ministers how much UK aid had been given to Sri Lanka. Fox has declared all of his trips to Sri Lanka paid for by the Sri Lankan government in the Register of Members&#x27; Financial Interests. One trip he took in November 2007 was declared two months late. Fox blamed a &quot;changeover of staffing responsibilities&quot; for this error. Of the five trips to Sri Lanka mentioned in the BBC article, three were paid for fully by the Sri Lankan government. Those not paid in full by the Sri Lankan government were paid for by the Sri Lankan Development Trust.

Fox stated that he had been working for &#x27;all sides of the ethnic divide&#x27;: &quot;I have been involved in attempts to promote peace and reconciliation in Sri Lanka, involving all sides of the ethnic divide, since I was a foreign minister in 1997. During my most recent visit, I spoke at a press conference to outline my reasons for being there. The declaration of the visit you refer to in November 2007 was highlighted in an end-of-year audit following a changeover of staffing responsibilities. The registrar was immediately notified and my register entry was updated accordingly. All visits have been fully declared on the House of Commons Register of Members&#x27; Interests and are therefore public knowledge and entirely legitimate. I do, however, recognise that when asking one question in 2008, I should have noted an interest and will be writing to the registrar to make this clear&quot;.

==Personal life==
On 10 June 2005, he announced his engagement to longtime girlfriend Jesme Baird, a doctor who works at the Roy Castle Lung Cancer Foundation. They married at St Margaret&#x27;s Church opposite Parliament on 17 December 2005.

He previously dated Natalie Imbruglia and is credited in the liner notes of her 1997 album &quot;Left of the Middle&quot;.

He has lived in North Somerset since 1990, and currently resides in Tickenham.

In September 2013, Fox launched &quot;Rising Tides: Facing the Challenges of a New Era&quot;, a 384-page book in which he warns that many of the world’s institutions are ill-equipped to tackle the economic and security threats of the 21st century.

Fox is a member of the Royal College of General Practitioners.

<text>Non-attached members, also known by the French term  (, NI), are members of the European Parliament (MEPs) who do not belong to one of the recognised political groups.

These MEPs may be members of a national party, or of a European political party; however, for a political grouping to be formed in the European Parliament there need to be 23 MEPs from seven different countries. Being part of a group grants access to state funds and committee seats, but the group members must be ideologically tied. Groups of convenience, such as the Technical Group of Independents, previously existed, but are no longer allowed, and the minimum requirements for group formation have been raised, forcing parties and MEPs without ideological similarity to already existing groupings to sit as non-inscrits. Whilst some groups of MEPs who sit as non-inscrits may share similar views and express an intention to form new groupings between themselves in the future, non-inscrits as a whole have no specific ties to each other, other than their mutual lack of a political grouping.

== MEPs ==
=== 10th European Parliament (2024–2029)===


=== 9th European Parliament (2019–2024)===

The majority of Non-attached members were right wing.
Prior to the United Kingdom&#x27;s withdrawal from the EU on 31 January 2020, there were 30 British MEPs who were Non-Inscrits: 29 members of the Brexit Party and 1 member of the Democratic Unionist Party.

=== 8th European Parliament (2014–2019) ===
The number of Non-Inscrits rose temporarily from 48 at the beginning of the term to 100 between 16 and 20 October 2014 when the EFDD group dissolved following the departure of Latvian MEP Iveta Grigule. The EFDD group was restored when Robert Iwaszkiewicz (KNP, Poland) decided to join it.

On 15 June 2015, 35 Non-Inscrits MEPs and a former EFDD member (Janice Atkinson, excluded from UKIP) formed a new group, named &quot;Europe of Nations and Freedom&quot; (ENF), around Marine Le Pen (FN) and Marcel de Graaff (PVV), later joined on 24 June 2015 by Aymeric Chauprade. The number of Non-Inscrits then fell to 14 on 22 July 2015, when Juan Fernando López Aguilar reintegrated S&amp;D. Aymeric Chauprade left ENF on 9 November 2015. Marcus Pretzell was expelled from ECR before joining the ENF in May 2016, bringing the number of Non-Inscrits to 15. From May 2016 to May 2017 Renato Soru was expelled from S&amp;D after being sentenced for tax evasion. When Steven Woolfe and Diane James left EFDD in October and November 2016 and Alessandra Mussolini left EPP during twelve days in November–December 2016 the number of Non-Inscrits grew to 19 before coming back to 18. Jacek Saryusz-Wolski was expelled from the EPP in March 2017.

The majority of Non-attached members were right wing. 
====Previous members====
=== 7th European Parliament (2009–2014)===
The majority of Non-attached members were right wing.
=== 6th European Parliament (2004-2009)===
In the 6th European Parliament 23 right-wing NIs briefly formed the Identity, Tradition, Sovereignty group at the start of 2007, but it collapsed on 14 November 2007 due to internal disagreements.

The majority of Non-attached members were right wing.
=== 5th European Parliament (1999–2004)===

The majority of Non-attached members were right wing.

<text>Brindas () is a commune of the Rhône department in eastern France.

== Geography ==
It lies about 15 km (9,5 mi) South-West of Lyon, but not included in the Metropolis of Lyon.

== History ==
Brindas is often regarded as the second home of &quot;Guignol&quot;, a French puppet show from Lyon. The name of the village was often quoted in parts of &quot;Guignol&quot; plays as several Guignol entertainers used to spend holiday time in this village. Pierre Neichthauser, mayor of Brindas from 1929 until 1940, was also the puppeteer for the character &quot;Gnafron&quot; in his &quot;Guignol Mourguet&quot; theatre.

A Guignol museum-theater (&quot;Musée-théâtre Guignol&quot;) was opened in Brindas in 2008 (year of Guignol&#x27;s bicentenary).

<doc id="357391" wikidata="Q47750" url="?curid=357391" title="Lega Nord">
<text>Lega Nord (LN; ), whose complete name is &#x27; (), is a right-wing, federalist, populist and conservative political party in Italy. In the run-up to the 2018 general election, the party was rebranded as &#x27; (), without changing its official name. The party was nonetheless frequently referred to only as &quot;Lega&quot; even before the rebranding, and informally as the (). The party&#x27;s latest elected leader was Matteo Salvini.

In 1989, the LN was established as a federation of six regional parties from northern and north-central Italy (Liga Veneta, Lega Lombarda, Piemont Autonomista, Uniun Ligure, Lega Emiliano-Romagnola and Alleanza Toscana), which became the party&#x27;s founding &quot;national&quot; sections in 1991. The party&#x27;s founder and long-time federal secretary was Umberto Bossi, now federal president. The LN has advocated the transformation of Italy from a unitary to a federal state, fiscal federalism, regionalism and greater regional autonomy, especially for northern regions. At times, the party has advocated the secession of northern Italy, which the party has referred to as &quot;Padania&quot;, and, thus, Padanian nationalism. The party has always opposed illegal immigration and often adopted Eurosceptic stances.

Since 31 January 2020, through a mandate given by the federal council, the party has been managed by commissioner Igor Iezzi. The LN was thus eclipsed by the Lega per Salvini Premier (LSP), until that moment active as the central and southern Italian branch of the party established by Salvini himself in the 2010s, and since 2020 throughout entire Italy. Following the emergence of LSP, the original LN is practically inactive and its former &quot;national&quot; sections (Lega Lombarda, Liga Veneta, etc.) have become &quot;regional&quot; sections of the LSP.

== History ==
=== Precursors and foundation ===

At the 1983 general election, &quot;Liga Veneta&quot; (&quot;Venetian League&quot;, based in Veneto) elected a deputy, Achille Tramarin; and a senator, Graziano Girardi. At the 1987 general election, another regional party, &quot;Lega Lombarda&quot; (&quot;Lombard League&quot;, based in Lombardy) gained national prominence when its leader Umberto Bossi was elected to the Italian Senate. The two parties, along with other regionalist outfits, ran as &quot;Alleanza Nord&quot; (&quot;Northern Alliance&quot;) during the 1989 European Parliament election, gaining 1.8% of the vote.

Lega Nord, which was first launched as a reform of Alleanza Nord in December 1989, was officially established as a party in February 1991 through the merger of various regional parties, notably including Lega Lombarda and Liga Veneta. These continue to exist as &quot;national sections&quot; of the main party, which presents itself in regional and local contests as &quot;Lega Lombarda–Lega Nord&quot;, &quot;Liga Veneta–Lega Nord&quot;, &quot;Lega Nord–Piemont&quot; and so on.

The foundational inspiration for the original regional parties and the unified party was the medieval political alliance of northern Italy known as the Lombard League (1167–1250), the consciousness that the northern ethnicities of the Italian peninsula are descendants of Gaulish and Lombardic populations — historically, northern Italians were called &quot;Lombards&quot; and the entire northern portion of the peninsula was called &quot;Lombardy&quot; —, and that they are ethnically different from the Greco-Roman population of the central-southern half of the peninsula (&quot;Italy&quot; proper). The Lega Nord party conveyed resentment against Rome&#x27;s centralism and the Italian government (epitomised by the popular slogan &quot;Roma Ladrona&quot;, meaning &quot;Rome the Big Thief&quot;), common in northern Italy as many northerners felt that the government wasted resources collected mostly from northerners&#x27; taxes, especially for sustaining the economies of Rome and southern Italy. Resentment against illegal immigrants was also exploited. The party&#x27;s electoral successes began approximately at a time when public disillusionment with the established political parties was at its height: the &quot;Tangentopoli&quot; corruption scandals, which involved most of the established parties, broke out from 1992 onwards. Contrary to what many pundits observed at the beginning of the 1990s, Lega Nord became a stable political force in the Italian political scene.

Lega Nord&#x27;s first electoral breakthrough was at the 1990 regional elections, but it was with the 1992 general election that the party emerged as a leading political actor. Having gained 8.7% of the vote, 56 deputies and 26 senators, it became the fourth largest party of the country and within the Italian Parliament. In 1993, Marco Formentini (a left-wing member of the party) was elected mayor of Milan, the party won 49.3% in the provincial election of Varese and by the end of the year—before Silvio Berlusconi launched his own political career and party—it was estimated around 16–18% in electoral surveys (half of that support was later siphoned by Berlusconi).

=== First alliance with Berlusconi ===
In early 1994, some days before the announcement of the Bossi–Berlusconi pact which led to the formation of the Pole of Freedoms, Roberto Maroni, Bossi&#x27;s number two, signed an agreement with Mario Segni&#x27;s centrist Pact for Italy, which was later cancelled.

The party thus fought the 1994 general election in alliance with Berlusconi&#x27;s Forza Italia (FI) within the Pole of Freedoms coalition. Lega Nord gained just 8.4% of the vote, but thanks to a generous division of candidacies in Northern single-seats constituencies its parliamentary representation was almost doubled to 117 deputies and 56 senators. The position of President Chamber of Deputies was thus given to a LN member, Irene Pivetti, a young woman hailing from the Catholic faction of the party.

After the election, the League joined FI, National Alliance (AN) and the Christian Democratic Centre (CCD) to form a coalition government under Berlusconi and the party obtained five ministries in Berlusconi&#x27;s first cabinet: Interior for Roberto Maroni (who was also Deputy Prime Minister), Budget for Giancarlo Pagliarini, Industry for Vito Gnutti, European affairs for Domenico Comino and Institutional Reforms for Francesco Speroni. However, the alliance with Berlusconi and the government itself were both short-lived: the latter collapsed before the end of the year, with the League being instrumental in its demise.

The last straw was a proposed pension reform, which would have hurt some of the key constituencies of the LN, but the government was never a cohesive one and relations among coalition partners, especially those between the LN and the centralist AN, were quite tense all the time. When Bossi finally decided to withdraw from the government in December, Maroni vocally disagreed and walked out.

In January 1995, the League gave a vote of confidence to the newly formed cabinet led by Lamberto Dini, along with the Italian People&#x27;s Party and the Democratic Party of the Left. This caused several splinter groups to leave the party, including the Federalist Party (which was actually founded in June 1994) of Gianfranco Miglio, the Federalists and Liberal Democrats of Franco Rocchetta, Lucio Malan and Furio Gubetti and the Federalist Italian League of Luigi Negri and Sergio Cappelli. All these groups later merged into FI while a few other MPs, including Pierluigi Petrini, floor leader in the Chamber of Deputies, joined the centre-left. By 1996, a total of 40 deputies and 17 senators had left the party while Maroni had instead returned to the party&#x27;s fold after months of coldness with Bossi.

Between 1995 and 1998, Lega Nord joined centre-left governing coalitions in many local contexts, notably including the Province of Padua to the city of Udine.

=== Padanian separatism ===
After a big success at the 1996 general election, its best result so far (10.1%, 59 deputies and 27 senators), Lega Nord announced that it wanted the secession of northern Italy under the name of Padania. On 13 September 1996, Bossi took an ampoule of water from the springs of the Po River (called &quot;Padus&quot; in Latin, whence &quot;Padania&quot;), which was poured into the sea of Venice two days later as a symbolic act of birth of the new nation. The Po River was deified by the party (&quot;Dio Po&quot;, &quot;Po God&quot;) and the &quot;Ampoule Rite&quot; was conducted as a yearly Pagan rite by the party&#x27;s leaders until the 2010s; in its early phase, the party supported a Celtic Druidic form of religion against Roman Catholicism and some party leaders married with Druidic rites. The party gave &quot;Padania&quot;, previously referring to the Po Valley, a broader meaning covering entire Northern Italy that has steadily gained currency, at least among its followers. The party even organised a referendum on independence and elections for a Padanian Parliament.

The years between 1996 and 1998 were particularly good for the League, which was the largest party in many provinces of northern Italy and was able to prevail in single-seat constituencies and provincial elections by running alone against both the centre-right and the centre-left. The party also tried to expand its reach through a number of Padanian-styled associations and media endeavours (under the supervision of Davide Caparini), notably including &quot;La Padania&quot; daily, &quot;Il Sole delle Alpi&quot; weekly, the &quot;Lega Nord Flash&quot; periodical, the TelePadania TV channel, the Radio Padania Libera and the Bruno Salvadori publishing house.

However, after the 1996 election, which Lega Nord had fought outside the two big coalitions, the differences between those who supported a new alliance with Berlusconi (Vito Gnutti, Domenico Comino, Fabrizio Comencini and more) and those who preferred to enter Romano Prodi&#x27;s Olive Tree (Marco Formentini, Irene Pivetti and others) re-emerged. A total of 15 deputies and 9 senators left the party to join either centre-right or centre-left parties. Pivetti left a few months after the election. Comencini left in 1998 to launch Liga Veneta Repubblica with the mid-term goal of joining forces with FI in Veneto. Gnutti and Comino were expelled in 1999 after they had formed local alliances with the centre-right. Formentini also left in 1999 in order to join Prodi&#x27;s Democrats.

As a result, the party suffered a huge setback at the 1999 European Parliament election in which it garnered a mere 4.5% of the vote. Since then, the League de-emphasised demands for independence in order to rather focus on devolution and federal reform, paving the way for a return to coalition politics.

=== House of Freedoms ===

After the defeat at the 1999 European Parliament election, senior members of the party thought it was not possible to achieve anything if the party continued to stay outside the two big coalitions. Some, including Maroni, who despite 1994–1995 row with Bossi had always been left-leaning in the heart, preferred an alliance with the centre-left. Bossi asked Maroni to negotiate an agreement with Massimo D&#x27;Alema, who had described Lega Nord as &quot;a rib of the left&quot;. These talks were successful and Maroni was indicated as the joint candidate for President of Lombardy for the 2000 regional election. Despite this, Bossi decided instead to approach Berlusconi, who was the front-runner in the upcoming 2001 general election. The centre-right coalition won the 2000 regional elections and the League entered the regional governments of Lombardy, Veneto, Piedmont and Liguria.

One year later, Lega Nord was part of Berlusconi&#x27;s House of Freedoms in the 2001 general election. According to its leader, the alliance was a &quot;broad democratic arch, composed of the democratic right, namely AN, the great democratic centre, namely Forza Italia, CCD and CDU, and the democratic left represented by the League, the New PSI, the PRI and, at least I hope so, Cossiga&quot;.

The coalition won handily the election, but the LN was further reduced to 3.9% while being returned in Parliament thanks to the victories scored by the League members in single-seat constituencies. In 2001–2006, although severely reduced in its parliamentary representation, the party controlled three key ministries: Justice with Roberto Castelli, Labour and Social affairs with Roberto Maroni and Institutional Reforms and Devolution with Umberto Bossi (replaced by Roberto Calderoli in June 2004). In March 2004, Bossi suffered a stroke that led many to question over the party&#x27;s survival, but that ultimately confirmed Lega Nord&#x27;s strength due to a very organised structure and a cohesive set of leaders.

In government, the LN was widely considered the staunchest ally of Berlusconi and formed the so-called &quot;axis of the North&quot; along with FI (whose strongholds included Lombardy and Veneto as well as Sicily) through the special relationship between Bossi, Berlusconi and Giulio Tremonti while AN and the Union of Christian and Centre Democrats (UDC), the party emerged from the merger of the CCD and the CDU in late 2002, became the natural representatives of Southern interests.

During the five years in government with the centre-right, the Parliament passed an important constitutional reform, which included federalism and more powers for the Prime Minister. The alliance that Lega Nord forged with the Movement for Autonomy (MpA) and the Sardinian Action Party (PSd&#x27;Az) for the 2006 general election was not successful in convincing Southern voters to approve the reform, which was rejected in the 2006 constitutional referendum.

=== Fourth Berlusconi government ===
In the aftermath of the fall of Romano Prodi&#x27;s government in January 2008, which led President Giorgio Napolitano to call an early election, the centre-right was re-organised by Berlusconi as The People of Freedom (PdL), now without the support of the UDC. Lega Nord ran the election in coalition with the PdL and the MpA, gaining a stunning 8.3% of the vote (+4.2pp) and obtaining 60 deputies (+37) and 26 senators (+13).

Following this result, since May 2008 the party was represented in Berlusconi&#x27;s fourth cabinet by four ministers (Roberto Maroni, Interior; Luca Zaia, Agriculture; Umberto Bossi, Reforms and Federalism; and Roberto Calderoli, Legislative simplification) and five under-secretaries (Roberto Castelli, Infrastructures; Michelino Davico, Interior; Daniele Molgora, Economy and Finances; Francesca Martini, Health; and Maurizio Balocchi, Legislative simplification).

In April 2009, a bill introducing a path towards fiscal federalism was approved by the Senate after having passed by the Chamber. The bill gained bipartisan support by Italy of Values, which voted in favour of the measure; and the Democratic Party (PD), which chose not to oppose the measure. As of late March 2011, all the most important decrees of the reform were approved by the Parliament and Bossi publicly praised the Democrats&#x27; leader Pier Luigi Bersani for not having opposed the decisive decree on regional and provincial fiscality. Lega Nord influenced the government also on illegal immigration, especially when dealing with immigrants coming from the sea. While the UNCHR and Catholic bishops expressed some concerns over the handling of asylum seekers, Maroni&#x27;s decision to send back to Libya the boats full of illegal immigrants was praised also by some leading Democrats, notably including Piero Fassino; and it was backed by some 76% of Italians according to a poll.

In agreement with the PdL, Luca Zaia was candidate for President in Veneto and Roberto Cota in Piedmont in the 2010 regional elections while in the other Northern regions, including Lombardy, the League supported candidates of the PdL. Both Zaia and Cota were elected. The party became the largest in Veneto with 35.2% and the second-largest in Lombardy with 26.2% while getting stronger all around the North and in some regions of central Italy.

In November 2011, Berlusconi resigned and was replaced by Mario Monti. The League was the only major party to oppose Monti&#x27;s technocratic government.

=== From Bossi to Maroni ===

Throughout 2011, the party was riven in internal disputes, which Bossi&#x27;s weak-as-ever leadership was not able to stop. Roberto Maroni, a moderate figure who had been the party&#x27;s number two since the start, was clearly Bossi&#x27;s most likely successor. The rise of Maroni and his fellow &quot;maroniani&quot; was obstacled by a group of Bossi&#x27;s loyalists, whom journalists called the &quot;magic circle&quot;. The leaders of this group were Marco Reguzzoni (floor leader in the Chamber of Deputies) and Rosi Mauro.

After being temporarily forbidden from speaking at the party&#x27;s public meetings, Maroni gained the upper hand in January 2012. During a factional rally in Varese, he launched direct attacks on Reguzzoni and Mauro in the presence of a puzzled Bossi. On that occasion, Maroni called for the celebration of party congresses and closed his speech paraphrasing Scipio Slataper and Che Guevara (the latter being one of his youth&#x27;s heroes): &quot;We are barbarians, dreaming barbarians. We are realistic, we dream the impossible&quot;. On 20 January, Bossi replaced Reguzzoni as leader in the Chamber with Gianpaolo Dozzo. Two days later, the federal council of the party scheduled provincial congresses by April and national (regional) congresses by June. Maroni, whose flock included people as diverse as Flavio Tosi, a conservative liberal; and Matteo Salvini, then a left-winger, strengthened his grip on the party.

On 3 April, a corruption scandal hit the magic circle and consequently the entire party. The party&#x27;s treasurer Francesco Belsito was charged with money-laundering, embezzlement and fraud of the LN&#x27;s expenses. Among other things, he was accused of having taken money away from the party&#x27;s chest and paid it out to Bossi&#x27;s family and other members of the magic circle, notably including Mauro. Maroni, who had already called for Belsito&#x27;s resignation as early as in January, asked for his immediate replacement. Belsito resigned a few hours later and was replaced by Stefano Stefani.

More shockingly, on 5 April, Bossi resigned as the federal secretary. The party&#x27;s federal council then appointed a triumvirate composed of Maroni, Calderoli and Manuela Dal Lago, who would lead the party until a new federal congress was held. Bossi, however, was then elected the federal president. On 12 April, the federal council expelled both Belsito and Mauro and decided that a federal congress would be held at the end of June. In the 6–7 May local elections, the League was crushed almost everywhere while retaining the city of Verona, where Tosi, the incumbent mayor, was re-elected by a landslide; and a few other strongholds.

The Bossi–Belsito scandal finally resulted, on 7 August 2019, in a sentence by Italy&#x27;s highest court, according to which the LN was to pay back 49 million euros.

=== Leadership of Maroni ===
At the beginning of June, after having secured the leadership of several national sections of the party, Maroni and his followers scored two big victories at the congresses of the two largest &quot;nations&quot;, Lombardy and Veneto: Matteo Salvini was elected secretary of Lega Lombarda with 74% of the votes while Flavio Tosi fended off a challenge by the Venetists&#x27; and Bossi&#x27;s loyalists&#x27; standard-bearer Massimo Bitonci, defeating him 57%–43%.
On 1 July, Maroni was virtually unanimously elected federal secretary. The party&#x27;s constitution was changed in order to make Bossi federal president for life, to restructure the federal organisation and to give more autonomy to the national sections, in fact transforming the federation into a confederation.

At the 2013 general election, which saw the rise of the Five Star Movement (M5S), the League won a mere 4.1% of the vote (−4.2pp). However, in the simultaneous 2013 regional election in Lombardy the party won the big prize: Maroni was elected President by defeating his Democratic opponent 42.8% to 38.2%. The League, which retrieved 12.9% in Lombardy in the general election, garnered 23.2% (combined result of party list, 13.0% and Maroni&#x27;s personal list, 10.2%) in the regional election. All three big regions of the North were thus governed by the League.

In September 2013, Maroni announced he would soon leave the party&#x27;s leadership. A congress was scheduled for mid December and in accordance to the new rules set for the leadership election five candidates filed their bid to become secretary: Umberto Bossi, Matteo Salvini, Giacomo Stucchi, Manes Bernardini and Roberto Stefanazzi. Of these, only Bossi and Salvini gathered the 1,000 necessary signatures by party members to take part to the internal &quot;primary&quot; and Salvini collected four times the signatures gathered by Bossi.

=== Leadership of Salvini ===

On 7 December, Salvini, endorsed by Maroni and most leading members (including Tosi, who had renounced a bid of his own), trounced Bossi with 82% of the vote in the &quot;primary&quot;. His election was ratified a week later by the party&#x27;s federal congress in Turin. Under Salvini, the party embraced a very critical view of the European Union, especially of the euro, which he described a &quot;crime against mankind&quot;. Ahead of the 2014 European Parliament election, Salvini started to cooperate with Marine Le Pen, leader of the French National Front; and Geert Wilders, leader of the Dutch Party for Freedom. All this was criticised by Bossi, who re-called his left-wing roots; and Tosi, who represented the party&#x27;s centrist wing and defended the Euro.

In the European election, the party, which ran on a &quot;Stop the Euro&quot; ticket, emphasised Euroscepticism and welcomed candidates from other anti-Euro and/or autonomist movements, notably including South Tyrol&#x27;s Freiheitlichen, obtained 6.2% of the vote and five MEPs. The result was far worse than that of the previous European election in 2009 (−4.0pp), but better than that of 2013 general election (+2.1pp). The LN came third with 15.2% in Veneto (where Tosi obtained many more votes than Salvini, showing his popular support once for all and proving how the party was far from united on the anti-Euro stance), ahead of the new Forza Italia (FI) and the other PdL&#x27;s spin-offs; and fourth in Lombardy with 14.6%. Salvini was triumphant, despite the party had lost Piedmont to the Democrats after Cota had been forced to resign due to irregularities committed by one of its supporting lists in filing the slates for the 2010 election and had decided not to stand. Moreover, Bitonci was elected mayor of Padua, a centre-left stronghold.

The party&#x27;s federal congress, summoned in Padua in July 2014, approved Salvini&#x27;s political line, especially a plan for the introduction of a flat tax and the creation of a sister party in central-southern Italy and the Isles. In November, the Emilia-Romagna regional election represented a major step for Salvini&#x27;s &quot;national project&quot;: the LN, which won 19.4% of the vote, was the region&#x27;s second-largest and resulted far ahead of FI, paving the way for a bid for the leadership of the centre-right. In December, Us with Salvini (NcS) was launched. The party&#x27;s growing popularity among voters was reflected also by a constant rise in opinion polls.

In March 2015, after a long struggle between Tosi and Zaia, who was backed by Salvini, over the party&#x27;s candidates in the upcoming regional election in Veneto, Tosi was removed from national secretary of Liga Veneta and ejected from the federal party altogether. However, the 2015 regional elections were another success for the LN, especially in Veneto, where Zaia was handily re-elected with 50.1% of the vote (Tosi got 11.9%) and the combined score of party&#x27;s and Zaia&#x27;s personal lists was 40.9%. The party also came second in Liguria (22.3%) and Tuscany (16.2%), third in Marche (13.0%) and Umbria (14.0%).

After the 2016 local elections in which the party ran below expectations in Lombardy (while doing well in Veneto—thanks to Zaia, Emilia-Romagna and Tuscany) and the NcS performed badly, Salvini&#x27;s political line came under pressure from Bossi, Maroni and Paolo Grimoldi, the new leader of Lega Lombarda. In the 2017 leadership election, Salvini, who was focused on becoming the leader of the centre-right and possibly changing the LN&#x27;s name by ditching the word &quot;North&quot;, was re-elected leader of the party with 82.7% of the vote against his opponent Gianni Fava&#x27;s 17.3%. Consequently, Salvini launched his campaign to become Prime Minister.

In the meantime, the LN campaigned heavily for Veneto&#x27;s and Lombardy&#x27;s autonomy referendums, which took place on 22 October. In Veneto, the turnout was 57.2% and those who voted &quot;yes&quot; reached 98.1% whereas in Lombardy the figures were 38.3% and 95.3%. When the referendums were over, with strong opposition by Bossi, Salvini persuaded the party&#x27;s federal council to style the party simply as &quot;Lega&quot;, including NcS, in the upcoming general election. Additionally, Salvini toned down his stances against the European Union and the Euro in order to make an alliance with FI possible.

Despite misgivings by Bossi and the Padanist old guard, the party still had a strong autonomist outlook in the northern regions, especially in Veneto where Venetian nationalism was stronger than ever before. Additionally, the League maintained its power base in the North, where it continued to get most of its support.

=== Yellow-green coalition ===
The League ran in the 2018 general election within the four-party centre-right coalition, also composed of FI, Brothers of Italy (FdI) and Us with Italy (NcI), which formed a joint list with the Union of the Centre (UdC). In a further effort to broaden its base, the League welcomed in its electoral slates several independents, notably including Giulia Bongiorno and Alberto Bagnai, as well as a wide range of minor parties, including the Sardinian Action Party (PSd&#x27;Az), the Italian Liberal Party (PLI) and the National Movement for Sovereignty (MNS). The League obtained a resounding success, becoming the third largest party in Italy with 17.4% of the vote (+13.3pp). The ticket won most of its votes in the North (including 32.2% in Veneto, 28.0% in Lombardy, 26.7% in Trentino, 25.8% in Friuli-Venezia Giulia and 22.6% in Piedmont) while making inroads elsewhere, especially in central Italy (notably 20.2% in Umbria), the upper part of the South (13.8% in Abruzzo) and Sardinia (10.8%).

In the simultaneous regional election in Lombardy, LN&#x27;s Attilio Fontana ran for President after Maroni, increasingly critical of Salvini, chose not to run for a second term and step aside from politics. Fontana was elected with 49.8% of the vote and the party scored 29.4%. In late April in the regional election in Friuli-Venezia Giulia, LN&#x27;s Massimiliano Fedriga was elected with 57.1% of the vote and the party scored 34.9%.

As neither of the three main groupings (the centre-right, the PD-led centre-left and the M5S) obtained a majority of seats in Parliament, the League entered in coalition talks with the M5S which was the most voted party with 32.7% of the vote. The talks resulted in the proposal of the so-called &quot;government of change&quot; under the leadership of Giuseppe Conte, a law professor close to the M5S. After some bickering with President Sergio Mattarella, Conte&#x27;s government, which was dubbed by the media as Western European &quot;first all-populist government&quot;, was sworn in on 1 June. The cabinet featured Salvini as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of the Interior, Giancarlo Giorgetti as Secretary of the Council and four other League members (plus an independent close to the party) as ministers.

During 2019, along with the LN&#x27;s membership recruitment in the Centre-North, the party launched a parallel drive in the Centre-South for the LSP, practically supplanting NcS. It was a sign that the LSP, whose party constitution had been published in the &quot;Gazzetta Ufficiale&quot; in December 2017 and had been described as a &quot;parallel party&quot;, might eventually replace both the LN and NcS. In the meantime, the parties&#x27; joint parliamentary groups were named &quot;League–Salvini Premier&quot; in the Chamber and &quot;League–Salvini Premier–Sardinian Action Party&quot; in the Senate. According to some news sources, Salvini wanted to launch a brand-new party and absorb most of the centre-right parties into it.

Since the government&#x27;s formation, the party was regularly the country&#x27;s largest party in opinion polls, at around or over 30%. The party&#x27;s strength was confirmed in October by the Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol provincial elections: in Trentino LN&#x27;s Maurizio Fugatti was elected President with 46.7% of the vote and the party scored 27.1% (despite competition from several autonomist parties), while in South Tyrol it came third with 11.1% (being the most voted in Bolzano and, more generally, among Italian-speakers), leading it to replace the PD as junior partner of the South Tyrolean People&#x27;s Party in the provincial government coalition.

In the 2019 European Parliament election in Italy, the League won 34.3% of the vote, winning for the first time a plurality of the electorate, while the M5S stopped at 17.1%. The election thus weakened the M5S and strengthened Salvini&#x27;s position within the government. At the European level, Salvini worked to create a pan-European alliance of nationalist political parties, the European Alliance of Peoples and Nations, and he continued these efforts after the election through the Identity and Democracy Party. In the election the party performed strongly in its northern strongholds, especially Veneto (49.9%) and Lombardy (43.4%), obtaining as usual most of its votes in small towns, as well as increasing its share of vote all around the country. The party also obtained notable results in some of the places associated with the European migrant crisis, from north to south, such as Bardonecchia, Ventimiglia, Riace and Lampedusa.

In July 2019, a case of attempted Russia-linked corruption by the League was made public by voice recordings acquired by BuzzFeed. The recordings showed Gianluca Savoini, a LN member, meeting with unspecified Russian agents in Moscow, at the same time when Salvini was also in Moscow on an official trip. The meeting centered around providing the party with $65 million of illegal funding by Russia. The matter was made part of a larger investigation by Italian authorities into the League&#x27;s finances. In February 2019 the Italian magazine &quot;L&#x27;Espresso&quot; had already published an investigation revealing another 3 million euro funding scheme, paid for by Kremlin-linked entities and disguised as a diesel sale. That scheme involved the Russian state-owned oil company Rosneft selling 3 million dollars worth of diesel to an Italian company. Allegedly, the money was to be transferred from Rosneft to the League through a Russian subsidy of the Italian bank Intesa Sanpaolo, in which LN&#x27;s federal council member Andrea Mascetti was a board member. The money was supposed to fund the coming European election campaign. Italian authorities are currently investigating the matter. The League was also an official cooperation partner of the Russian governing party United Russia.

On 8 August 2019, Salvini announced his intention to leave the coalition with the Five Stars and called for a snap general election. However, after successful talks between the M5S, and the PD, a new government led by Conte was formed. The League thus returned to opposition, together with its electoral allies of the centre-right coalition.

The first election after the formation of Conte&#x27;s second government was the 2019 Umbrian regional election. In a traditional stronghold of the centre-left, the League won 37.0% of the vote and its candidate Donatella Tesei was elected President with 57.6% of the vote and a 20% lead over Vincenzo Bianconi, who was the candidate of a joint list of centre-left and M5S.

=== 2019 federal congress ===
During a federal congress on 21 December 2019, the party&#x27;s constitution undwerwent some major changes, including reduced powers for the federal president, the extension of the federal secretary&#x27;s and federal council&#x27;s terms from three to five years, the introduction of &quot;dual membership&quot; and the faculty given to the federal council to grant the use of the party&#x27;s symbol to other political movements. With the end of its membership drive in August 2020, the LSP, until then present only in central-southern Italy, became active throughout Italy. The LN, unable to be dissolved because of its burden of €49 million debt to the Italian state, was instead formally kept alive, while its cards were donated to former activists.

== Ideology ==
The party&#x27;s ideology is a combination of political federalism, fiscal federalism, regionalism and defense of northern Italian traditions. The historical goal of the party is to transform Italy into a federated state, letting Padania keep more tax revenues collected there under a regime of fiscal federalism. Through Lega Nord, federalism has become a major issue in the country. This is also the main difference between the Lega Nord and most European regionalist parties (South Tyrolean People&#x27;s Party, Basque Nationalist Party, Republican Left of Catalonia, Scottish National Party, Vlaams Belang and the like), which focus on special rights for their own regions.

The original programme of the party identified &quot;federalist libertarianism&quot; as ideology. In fact, the party has often varied its tone and policies, replacing its original libertarianism and social liberalism with a more socially conservative approach, alternating anti-clericalism with a pro-Catholic Church stance and Europeanism with a marked Euroscepticism and ultimately abandoning much of its original pacifism and uncompromising environmentalism. Lega Nord is now often regarded as a right-wing populist party. Party leaders generally reject the &quot;right-wing&quot; label, though not the &quot;populist&quot; label. In 2008, Umberto Bossi explained in an interview that Lega Nord is &quot;libertarian, but also socialist&quot; and that the right-wing ideology he prefers is an anti-statist one with a &quot;libertarian idea of a state which does not weigh on citizens&quot;. When asked to tell his most preferred politician of the 20th century, he said Giacomo Matteotti, a Socialist MP who was killed by Fascist squads in 1925 and remembered his anti-fascist and left-wing roots.

Lega Nord&#x27;s political culture was a mix of northern Italian pride or even Padanian nationalism, often with claims of a proud Celtic heritage; resentment of perceived southern Italian habits and Roman authorities; distrust of the Republic of Italy and especially its flag; and some support for the free market, anti-statism, anti-globalism and separatism or secessionism. The party boasts historical references to the anti-imperialist Lombard League and Alberto da Giussano (stylised in the party&#x27;s symbol), the hero of the wars against Frederick I Barbarossa. These historical references are the base for the party&#x27;s anti-monopolism and anti-centralism.

Lega Nord has long maintained an anti-southern Italian stance. Party members have been known to oppose large-scale southern Italian migration to northern Italian cities, stereotyping southern Italians as welfare abusers, criminals and detrimental to Northern society. Party members have often attributed Italy&#x27;s economic stagnation and the disparity of the North-South divide in the Italian economy to supposed negative characteristics of the southern Italians, such as lack of education, laziness, or criminality. Some LN members have been known to publicly deploy the offensive slur &quot;terrone&quot; (&quot;earthling&quot;, &quot;mulatto&quot;), a common pejorative term for southern Italians.

At times, it has seemed possible that the League might unite with similar leagues in central and southern Italy, but it has not succeeded in doing so. The party continues dialogue with regionalist parties throughout Italy, notably the South Tyrolean People&#x27;s Party, the Valdostan Union, the Trentino Tyrolean Autonomist Party, the Movement for the Autonomies and the Sardinian Action Party; and it has some figures from the South in its parliamentary ranks. Notably, Angela Maraventano, former deputy mayor of Lampedusa, was a senator of Lega Nord. Although it is no longer a member of the European Free Alliance, the party has ties with many regionalist parties around Europe, including left-wing parties such as the Republican Left of Catalonia. Lega Nord has some ties also with the Ticino League from Switzerland.

=== Catch-all nature ===
Lega Nord aims at uniting all those northern Italians who support autonomy and federalism for their land. For this reason, it has tended to be a multi-ideological catch-all party, especially at its beginnings, following what Bossi stated in 1982 to his early followers: &quot;It does not matter how old are you, what your job is and what your political tendency: what matters is that you and we are all Lombard. [...] It is as Lombards, indeed, that we have a fundamental common goal in face of which our division in parties should fall behind&quot;. Roberto Biorcio, a political scientist, wrote: &quot;The political commitment of Umberto Bossi was influenced by his encounter with Bruno Salvadori, leader of the Valdostan Union [...]. The convictions of Salvadori on federalism, the self-determination of the peoples (the so-called nations without state) and the belonging to a people on the basis of cultural criteria and not on blood, were adopted by the future leader of the League&quot;.

Since the beginning the electorate of the party has been very diverse on a left-right scale. At the 1992 general election, for instance, 25.4% of the party supporters were former Christian Democratic voters, 18.5% Communists, 12.5% Socialists and 6.6% former voters of the post-fascist Italian Social Movement. According to a 1996 Abacus poll, 28.7% of LN voters identified as centrist, 26.3% as right-wingers and 22.1% as left-wingers.

It is quite difficult to define it in the left-right spectrum because it is variously conservative, centrist and left-wing with regard to different issues. For example, the party supports both liberal ideas such as deregulation and social-democratic positions such as the defense of workers&#x27; wages and pensions. This is because Lega Nord, as a &quot;people&#x27;s party&quot; representing the North as a whole, includes both liberal-conservative and social-democratic factions. As Lega Nord, the party could be seen as a cross-class entity uniting northern Italians, whether working class or petit bourgeois, around a sense of opposition to both the powerful forces of capital and a centralising state based in Rome which redistributes resources towards southern Italy.

Generally speaking, the party supports the social market economy and other typical issues of Christian-democratic parties and has been described as a &quot;neo-labour party&quot; by some commentators and also by some of its members. Lega Nord is populist in the sense that it is an anti-monopolist and anti-elitist popular and participative party (it is one of the few Italian political parties not to permit freemasons to join), fighting against the &quot;vested interests&quot;, once identified by Bossi in &quot;Agnelli, the Pope and the Mafia&quot;. The party is also libertarian populist in its promotion of small ownership, small and medium-sized enterprise, small government as opposed to governmental bureaucracy, waste of public funds, pork barrel spending and corruption. These are the main reasons why the party is strong in the North despite being obscured (especially at the beginning of its history) and badly presented by national media, television and newspapers. According to a number of scholars, Lega Nord is an example of a right-wing populist, radical right, or far-right party while some see significant differences to typical European radical right-wing populist parties, or reject the label of radical right as inadequate to describe the party&#x27;s ideology.

According to many observers, under Matteo Salvini the party lurched to the right, but both Salvini, a former communist; and Luca Zaia insist the party is &quot;neither right nor left&quot; while Roberto Maroni, another former leftist, stated that &quot;we are a big political movement which has in its platform issues and people of right and left&quot;.

=== Platform and policies ===
The party usually takes a socially conservative stance on social issues, such as abortion, euthanasia, medical embryonic stem cell research, artificial insemination, same-sex marriage (although there is an association called &quot;Los Padania&quot;, where &quot;Los&quot; stands for &quot;free sexual orientation&quot;, linked to the party and Lega Nord was once in favour of same-sex marriage) and drug use (although it did once support the legalization of marijuana along with Marco Pannella&#x27;s Radicals). Despite this, the party has been home to some social liberals, namely Giancarlo Pagliarini, Rossana Boldi, Giovanna Bianchi Clerici and to some extent Roberto Castelli.

The party has often espoused criticism of Islam and has styled itself as a defender of &quot;Judeo-Christian values&quot;. In 2018 the party made a proposal to make it mandatory for crucifixes to be displayed in all public spaces, including ports, schools, embassies and prisons, with fines of up to €1,000 for failing to comply.
Lega Nord has long opposed statism and supports lower taxes, especially for families and small entrepreneurs, most recently in the form of a 15% flat tax for all. In earlier times, the party campaigned for a stop of the flow of public money in help to big businesses facing crisis as for FIAT and Alitalia. Other key policies include the legalisation, regulation and taxation of prostitution in brothels, the direct election of prosecutors and a regionalised judiciary and Constitutional Court.

In its political programme, the party is committed to the environment, supporting public green areas, the establishment of natural parks, recycling and the end (or regulation) of the construction of sheds in country areas, especially in Veneto. Lega Nord, which has a strong agricultural wing, also supports the protection of traditional food, opposes GMOs and has campaigned for a revision of the quota system of the Common Agricultural Policy.

In foreign policy, the League has never had a particularly pro-United States stance, although it admires the American federal political system. The party&#x27;s MPs opposed both the Gulf War in 1991 and the NATO intervention in Kosovo in 1999 in the name of pacifism and Bossi personally met Slobodan Milošević during that war. However, after the September 11 attacks and the emergence of Islamic terrorism, the League became a supporter of the American efforts in the War on Terror, while expressing several reservations about the Iraq War and the American policy in its aftermath. The League is also a staunch supporter of Israel. In 2011, the party was severely opposed to the Italian participation in the war in Libya while in 2014 it opposed the sanctions on Russia, a key economic partner of Lombard and Venetian entrepreneurs and a likely ally in the fight against Islamic terrorism and the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant. At times, the party has adopted anti-globalist views.

Through the &quot;Associazione Umanitaria Padana&quot;, Lega Nord participates in humanitarian projects which are intended to respect local cultures, traditions and identities. The campaigns are carried out in poor countries or in those that have suffered from war or natural catastrophes. Locations of missions include Darfur, Iraq, Afghanistan and Ivory Coast. The association is led by Sara Fumagalli, wife of Roberto Castelli and born-again Catholic after a pilgrimage in Medjugorje.

==== Federalism vs. separatism ====

The exact program of Lega Nord was not clear in the early years as some opponents claimed it wanted secession of Padania while at other times it appeared to be requesting only autonomy for Northern regions. The League eventually settled on federalism, which rapidly became a buzzword and a popular issue in most Italian political parties.

By 1996, the party switched to open separatism, calling for the independence of Padania. The party&#x27;s constitution was reformed accordingly and still proclaims at article 1 that the LN&#x27;s fundamental goal is &quot;the achievement of the independence of Padania, through democratic means, and its international recognition as independent and sovereign federal republic&quot;. A voluntary group of militants, the &quot;Green Volunteers&quot;, often referred as &quot;green shirts&quot; (green being the colour of Padania), was also established, but it has since been active mainly in civil defense and emergency management. In September 1996 in Venice, the party unilaterally proclaimed the independence of Padania at which time while reading the Padanian Declaration of Independence Bossi announced: 

The renewed alliance with Berlusconi in 2001 forced the party to tone down its separatism and Padania became the name of a proposed &quot;macro-region&quot;, based on the ideas of Miglio: the establishment an Italian federal republic, divided into three &quot;macro-regions&quot; (&quot;Padania&quot;, &quot;Etruria&quot; and the &quot;South&quot;) and some autonomous regions. A new buzzword, devolution (often used in English), was also introduced, but with less success than &quot;federalism&quot;. This evolution caused some criticism within party ranks and led to the formation of some minor breakaway groups. Moreover, the peculiarity of the LN among European regionalist parties is that its main goal has long been the transformation of Italy into a federal state instead of simply demanding special rights and autonomy for Northern regions. Despite this, the party&#x27;s constitution continues to declare that the independence of Padania is one of the party&#x27;s final goal.

==== Euroscepticism vs. Europeanism ====
Lega Nord often criticises the European Union (it was the only party in the Italian Parliament, along with the Communist Refoundation Party, to vote against the Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe, but it voted in favour of the Treaty of Lisbon) and opposes what it calls the &quot;European superstate&quot;, favoring instead a &quot;Europe of the Regions&quot;. Especially under the leadership of Matteo Salvini and the influence of professor Claudio Borghi, the party has proposed the abandonment of the Euro by Italy, although this has been opposed by some party heavyweights, notably including Flavio Tosi. In an October 2012 interview, Salvini said that &quot;I in Milan want [the euro], because here we are in Europe. The South, however, is like Greece and needs another currency, the euro can&#x27;t afford it.&quot;

However, according to Roberto Maroni the party is not Eurosceptic and stands for a &quot;new Europeanism&quot;. In a public speech in 2012, he said to party activists: &quot;We should start looking at Padania in a Northern, European perspective. [...] The project of Padania is not anti-European, this is a new Europeanism which looks at the future: a Europe of the regions, a Europe of the peoples, a truly federal Europe&quot;. Moreover, under Maroni the party has supported the direct election of the President of the European Commission, more powers for the European Parliament, acceleration of the four unions (political, economic, banking and fiscal), Eurobonds and project bonds, the European Central Bank as lender of last resort and the &quot;centrality of Italy in European politics&quot;.

==== Illegal immigration ====

The party takes a tough stance on crime, illegal immigration, especially from Muslim countries, and terrorism. It supports the promotion of immigration from non-Muslim countries in order to protect the &quot;Christian identity&quot; of Italy and Europe, which according to party officials should be based on &quot;Judeo-Christian heritage&quot;. The party has been labeled as &quot;nationalist&quot;, &quot;xenophobic&quot; and &quot;anti-immigration&quot;. In 1992, the League was compared by &quot;Le Nouvel Observateur&quot; to some national populist parties of the European far-right, including France&#x27;s National Front, the Freedom Party of Austria and the Vlaams Blok, claiming that &quot;the League rejects any association with neo-fascists but plays on themes of xenophobia regionalism and trivial racism&quot;.

In 2002, the European Commission against Racism and Intolerance (ECRI) denounced the party, saying that &quot;exponents of the Lega Nord [...] have been particularly active in resorting to racist and xenophobic propaganda, although members of other parties have also made use of xenophobic or otherwise intolerant political discourse&quot;. In 2006 the ECRI noticed that &quot;some members of the Northern League have intensified the use of racist and xenophobic discourse&quot;. While noting that those expressing themselves this way were mostly local representatives, according to the ECRI &quot;representatives exercising important political functions at national level have also resorted to racist and xenophobic discourse. Such discourse has continued to target essentially non-EU immigrants, but also other members of minority groups, such as Roma and Sinti&quot;. The ECRI also recalled that &quot;in December 2004, the first instance court of Verona found six local representatives of Lega Nord guilty of incitement to racial hatred in connection with a campaign organised in order to send a group of Sinti away from a local temporary settlement&quot;. However, the Court of Cassation cancelled the sentence in 2007. 

Although several LN members speak strongly against illegal immigrants (Bossi suggested in 2003 opening fire on the boats of illegal immigrants from Africa, whom he described as &quot;bingo-bongos&quot;; and Giancarlo Gentilini labeled foreigners as &quot;immigrant slackers&quot;, saying that &quot;we should dress them up like hares and bang-bang-bang&quot;), the party&#x27;s official line is more moderate. In a 2010 interview after some riots in Milan between South American and North African immigrants, Maroni, then Minister of the Interior, stated that &quot;the police state is not the solution&quot; to integration problems and calling for a &quot;new model of integration&quot; maintained that &quot;we should think that, other than a permit of stay, a job and a house, there are further conditions that today are missing for integration to succeed&quot;. Bossi endorsed the position.

Lega Nord rejects all charges of xenophobia, instead claiming that the North is the victim of discrimination and racism. After more than fifteen years of government by Lega Nord, the Province of Treviso was widely considered the place in Italy where immigrants are best integrated. Similar things can be said about the city of Verona, governed by Flavio Tosi, who evolved from being a hardliner to be one of the most popular mayors of Italy. Moreover, the first and so far only black mayor in Italy belongs to the League: Sandy Cane (whose mother is Italian and father is an African American) was elected mayor in Viggiù in 2009. In an interview with &quot;The Independent&quot;, Cane said that the League does not include racist or xenophobic members. She eventually left the League in 2014. More recently, Hajer Fezzani, a Tunisian-born lapsed Muslim, was appointed local coordinator in Malnate; Souad Sbai, president of the association &quot;Moroccan women in Italy&quot; and former deputy of The People of Freedom, joined the party; and most notably Toni Iwobi, a Nigerian-born long-time party member, was appointed at the head of the party&#x27;s department on immigration (&quot;Tony will do more for legal immigrants in a month than what Kyenge has done in an entire life&quot;, Salvini said during the press conference) and became the first person of colour to be elected a senator of Italy after 2018 general election.

=== International affiliation ===
Lega Nord was originally a member of the European Free Alliance (EFA) and its first two MEPs, Francesco Speroni and Luigi Moretti, joined the Rainbow Group in the European Parliament during the fourth parliamentary term (1989–1994). Between 1994 and 1997, it was a member of the group of the European Liberal Democrat and Reform Party (ELDR) and one MEP of Lega Nord, Raimondo Fassa, continued to sit in the ELDR group until 1999. During the sixth parliamentary term (1999–2004), it was briefly a component of the Technical Group of Independents (TGI) along with Italian Radicals and then returned to the Non-Inscrits.

Following the 2004 European Parliament election, Lega Nord joined the Independence/Democracy (I/D) group and later the Union for Europe of the Nations (UEN), a seemingly awkward affiliation for a party proposing a &quot;Europe of the Regions&quot;—but in the Lega Nord&#x27;s view a state&#x27;s &quot;regions&quot; are populated by &quot;nations&quot; such as the Catalans or the Lombards. The party was affiliated to the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe (ALDE) in the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe until 2006, when its members joined the European Democrat Group (EDG), a diverse group stretching from the British Conservative Party to United Russia.

Following the 2009 European Parliament election, Lega Nord joined the newly formed the Europe of Freedom and Democracy (EFD) group. One year after the 2014 European Parliament election, the party was a founding member of the Europe of Nations and Freedom (ENL) group. After the 2019 European Parliament election, Lega Nord co-founded the Identity and Democracy (ID) group, alongside the French National Rally, the Danish People&#x27;s Party, the Freedom Party of Austria, the Conservative People&#x27;s Party of Estonia, the Finns Party, the Belgian Vlaams Belang, the Czech Freedom and Direct Democracy party, and Alternative for Germany. Outside of its European parliamentary group, Lega also has contacts with the Spanish Vox, the Dutch Forum for Democracy, the Sweden Democrats, the Hungarian Fidesz, and the Polish Law and Justice party. In March 2017 the LN signed a cooperation protocol with United Russia.

The party has also been active in counter-jihad networks, and in 2016 signed the &quot;Prague Declaration&quot; as part of the Fortress Europe group alongside the Pegida movement and other groups against the &quot;Islamic conquest of Europe&quot;.

== Factions ==
Although there are almost no official factions within the party, it is possible to distinguish several tendencies or wings.

=== Regional and ideological divides ===

The wing from the province of Varese and more broadly the bulk of the original Lega Lombarda (including Umberto Bossi, Roberto Maroni and Marco Formentini) has tended to be the left-wing of the party while that from the province of Bergamo (notably Roberto Calderoli) has tended to be more conservative. In fact, both Bossi and Maroni hailed from the far-left of the political spectrum, having been active in the Italian Communist Party, &quot;il manifesto&quot; movement, the Party of Proletarian Unity, Proletarian Democracy and the Greens before starting Lega Lombarda; and conceived Lega Nord as a centre-left (and to some extent social-democratic) political force. From the left came also Marco Formentini, a long-time member of the left-wing of the Italian Socialist Party; and Rosi Mauro, a trade unionist of the metal workers&#x27; section of the Italian Labour Union and later leader of the Padanian Trade Union (SinPa).

Since its foundation, Liga Veneta was instead characterised as a liberal, centrist and economically libertarian outfit due to the political upbringing of its early leaders and a more conservative electoral base. In the early 1990s, the League took votes especially from the Communists and the Socialists in western and central Lombardy, while the party electorally replaced Christian Democracy in eastern Lombardy and Veneto.

Lega Lombarda also included liberal-conservative figures such as Gianfranco Miglio and Vito Gnutti, both former Christian Democrats, while Giovanni Meo Zilio, a Socialist partisan during the Italian Resistance, was one of the founding fathers of Liga Veneta.

In Emilia-Romagna, a left-wing heartland, the party has many former Communists in its ranks and many others have Communist upbringings. However, with the passing of time the party underwent a process of homogenisation.

Between Maroni and Calderoli, there has been a liberal centrist wing including Roberto Castelli, a conspicuous group of former Liberals (Manuela Dal Lago, Daniele Molgora, Francesco Speroni and more) and a new generation of &quot;leghisti&quot; (Roberto Cota, Giancarlo Giorgetti, Marco Reguzzoni, Luca Zaia and others).

=== Issue-oriented groups ===
The League is home also to some issue-oriented groups. First, there is a group of Christian democrats, most of whom are affiliated to the Padanian Catholics, founded by late Roberto Ronchi and currently led by Giuseppe Leoni. Another leading Catholic is Massimo Polledri. Many &quot;leghisti&quot; are committed to Catholic social teaching and the social market economy and several party members are former members or voters of Christian Democracy.

There is a right-wing which is represented mainly by Mario Borghezio, a former Monarchist and &quot;Ordine Nuovo&quot; member who is the leader of Christian Padania, which is a key advocate of social conservatism within party ranks and has some links with the traditionalist Society of St. Pius X.
Third and fourth, the party has always included also a group of libertarians, whose leading members Leonardo Facco, Gilberto Oneto and Giancarlo Pagliarini have since left the party; and an Independentist Unit. The independentist wing crosses all the other factions and tendencies and in fact includes Borghezio and Francesco Speroni, among others. Oneto, father of Padanian nationalism; and Pagliarini were also close to this group.

Finally, the party is home to an agricultural wing, which is particularly strong in southern Lombardy, Emilia-Romagna and Veneto and is represented by the &quot;Cobas del latte&quot;, a farmers&#x27; trade union; the Land Movement, whose leader was Giovanni Robusti; and politicians such as Luca Zaia, a former Minister of Agriculture, Fabio Rainieri, one of the leader of Lega Nord Emilia; and Erminio Boso, a historic and now marginal figure from Trentino.

=== 1997 Padanian Parliament election ===
In October 1997, Lega Nord organised what it called &quot;the first elections to the Padanian Parliament&quot;. Roughly 4 million northern Italians (6 million according to the party) went to the polls and chose between a number of Padanian parties. This is a short resume of the affiliations of leading party members:
* Marco Formentini, Giovanni Meo Zilio, Roberto Bernardelli, Franco Colleoni and Mariella Mazzetto, with the support of Roberto Maroni, launched the Europeanist and social-democratic European Democrats – Padanian Labour (52 seats out of 210);
* Vito Gnutti, Giancarlo Pagliarini, Domenico Comino, Roberto Cota and Massimo Zanello led the liberal-conservative Liberal Democrats – Forza Padania (50);
* Oreste Rossi, Enzo Flego and Walter Gherardini formed the national-conservative Padanian Right (27);
* Roberto Ronchi and Giuseppe Leoni founded the Christian democratic Padanian Catholics (20);
* A group of Venetian &quot;leghisti&quot; formed the Venetist Padanian Lions (14);
* Leonardo Facco, Leopoldo Siegel and Marco Pottino launched Libertarian and Liberal Padania (12);
* Matteo Salvini and Mauro Manfredini were candidates of the Padanian Communists (5);
* Erminio Boso led the agrarian conservative Padanian Union – Agriculture, Environment, Hunting, Fishing (5);
* Benedetto Della Vedova, a Radical politician, was elected at the head of an anti-prohibitionist and free market libertarian list in Milan while Nando Dalla Chiesa, a Green MP, was an unsuccessful candidate in Milan too.

=== Differing viewpoints on coalitions ===
During the years in government in Rome (2001–2006), in the party there were different viewpoints on coalitions: some, led by Calderoli and Castelli (with the backing of Bossi), vigorously supported the alliance with the centre-right while others, represented by Maroni and Giorgetti, were less warm about it. Some of them spoke about joining the centre-left some time after the 2006 general election, which they were certain to lose. This idea was ascribed to the fact that without any support from the left it seemed even more difficult to win the constitutional referendum which would have turned Italy into a federal state.

Similar differences emerged during (and within) Berlusconi&#x27;s fourth government (2008–2011). While Calderoli was again a keen supporter of the arrangement, Maroni was far less warm on Berlusconi and at times evoked an alliance with the centre-left Democratic Party. Calderoli&#x27;s line had the backing of Federico Bricolo, Cota, Reguzzoni and chiefly Bossi while Maroni was backed by Giorgetti, Speroni, Zaia and Tosi. However, the alliance with the centre-right continued at the regional/local level (Veneto, Piedmont, Lombardy and others municipalities) after 2011 and has become a virtually permanent feature of Lega Nord&#x27;s electoral politics.

=== 2008–2011 developments ===
Since 2008, besides the traditional regional divides, the party was increasingly divided among three groups. The first was the so-called &quot;magic circle&quot;, that was to say Bossi&#x27;s inner circle, notably including Marco Reguzzoni, Rosi Mauro and Federico Bricolo. The second was formed around Roberto Calderoli, who was the powerful coordinator of Lega Nord&#x27;s national secretariats and had among his closest supporters Giacomo Stucchi and Davide Boni. The third one was led by Roberto Maroni, who tended to be more independent from Bossi and was somewhat critical of the centre-right affiliation of the party; and it included Giancarlo Giorgetti, Attilio Fontana, Matteo Salvini and Flavio Tosi. Gian Paolo Gobbo and Luca Zaia, leaders of the party in Veneto, although very loyal to Bossi, tended to be independent from &quot;federal&quot; factions and were engaged in a long power struggle with Flavio Tosi (see Liga Veneta#Factions). Indeed, &quot;Corriere della Sera&quot; identified four main groups: the magic circle, &quot;maroniani&quot;, &quot;calderoliani&quot; and &quot;Venetians&quot; (or, better, Venetists), leaving aside the core independentists (see Lega Nord#Issue-oriented groups). Roberto Cota, leader of Lega Nord Piemont, the third largest national section of Lega Nord, was very close to Bossi and was part of the magic circle, but since his election as President of Piedmont became more independent. Equidistant from the main factions were also Roberto Castelli and Francesco Speroni.
By 2011, &quot;maroniani&quot; clearly became the strongest faction within the party and Maroni, who was acclaimed at the traditional rally in Pontida in June, became Bossi&#x27;s obvious successor. &quot;Maroniani&quot; commanded wide support among rank-and-file members and were well represented in all regions, notably including Veneto, where Tosi was loyal to Maroni despite being a conservative-liberal. Maroni and Calderoli, who had been on opposite sides for years, joined forces against the magic circle and its influence on Bossi. After Pontida 2011, Mauro and Reguzzoni tried to convince Bossi to remove Giorgetti from the leadership of Lega Lombarda, but this move was strongly opposed by Maroni and Calderoli, who were supported in this also by Cota and most Venetians. The attempted &quot;coup d&#x27;etat&quot; produced an umparalleled backclash against the magic circle: 49 deputies out of 59 wanted to replace Reguzzoni as floor leader in the Chamber of Deputies with Stucchi, but Bossi imposed the &quot;status quo&quot;.

After earning resounding victories in the provincial congresses of Verona, Belluno and eastern Veneto during the first half of 2011, &quot;maroniani&quot; (with the support of &quot;calderoliani&quot;) prevailed also in Brescia and Val Camonica, defeating the candidates of the magic circle by landslides. In October, fearing a remake in Varese, his homeprovince, Bossi imposed his candidate, who was declared elected without a vote. In the event, Bossi was openly contested by many delegates at the congress and there had been an open vote, &quot;maroniani&quot; would have won. These party infightings ended with Bossi&#x27;s demise in February 2012 (see Lega Nord#From Bossi to Maroni).

=== 2013–2018 developments ===
Since Salvini&#x27;s rise to leadership in 2013, the party sported the usual regional and ideological divides and especially that between Salvini and Tosi as the former displayed a more populist attitude, strongly opposed the Euro and nominally supported separatism while the latter presented himself as a more centrist figure, supported European integration, was soft on independence and unveiled a liberal program for his intended run in a putative &quot;centre-right prime-ministerial primary election&quot;. As leader of Liga Veneta, Tosi, who was ejected from Lega Nord in March 2015, was confronted by the Venetist and separatist wings of the regional party, having in Zaia and Massimo Bitonci their leading members (see Liga Veneta#Factions). Curiously enough, those Venetists did not oppose Salvini&#x27;s &quot;Italian nationalist&quot; turn.

Since 2014, Salvini started to build a network of supporters in central-southern Italy and the Isles with the creation of Us with Salvini, a sister party to Lega Nord. This was broadly accepted by Venetians, but it was increasingly opposed by key Lombard figures, including Bossi, Maroni and Paolo Grimoldi (leader of Lega Lombarda), who criticised the LN&#x27;s right-wing turn and its focus on the South while reclaiming the federalist and autonomist identity of the LN.

In the 2017 leadership election, Salvini easily fended off the challenge posed by Gianni Fava, Lombard minister of Agriculture in the old social-democratic tradition, representing the federalist/autonomist/separatist wing of the party. Fava, who was anti-prohibition of drugs, pro-civil unions for same-sex couples, pro-Atlanticism, and anti-National Front (&quot;[it] is one of the most centralist and conservative blocs in Europe, what has it to do with us?&quot;), recalled an old activist saying &quot;let&#x27;s hurry up in making Padania, that I want to return voting for the left&quot; and added &quot;this was the League and it has to be like this anew&quot;. After Marine Le Pen&#x27;s defeat by Emmanuel Macron in the second round of the French presidential election, Maroni declared that the &quot;tactical and not strategic&quot; alliance with Le Pen, &quot;who wants to go back to national states&quot;, was over and that &quot;we should return to our origins of post-ideological movement, neither right nor left&quot;. Maroni added that &quot;the League is not right-wing, we have done things in Lombardy that the red regions would dream of, from the baby bonus to the welfare. Typically left-wing policies. For us there are the Lombards, not those of right or left&quot;. Finally, reminding Salvini&#x27;s left-wing roots, he remarked that &quot;those are the origins&quot; and that also Salvini would eventually share his views. More worryingly for party&#x27;s unity, Bossi threatened to leave the party and form an alternative movement with Roberto Bernardelli&#x27;s Padanian Union.

The tensions between Salvini and Maroni culminated in latter&#x27;s decision not to run for a second term as President of Lombardy in 2018. On that occasion, Maroni was very critical of Salvini in an interview with &quot;Il Foglio&quot;. As a result, very few &quot;maroniani&quot; were selected as candidates for the 2018 general election and Fava was also excluded. Bossi, who had not left the party, was selected by Salvini to lead the LN&#x27;s list for the Senate in Varese, but he was challenged also by Gianluigi Paragone, a former LN member who had switched to the Five Star Movement; and Great North, a party launched by Bernardelli and Marco Reguzzoni.

== Popular support ==
Support for Lega Nord is diverse even within Padania and has varied over time, reaching an early maximum of 10.1% of the vote at the 1996 general election (around 25% north of the Po River). That year, the League scored 29.3% of the vote in Veneto, 25.5% in Lombardy, 23.2% in Friuli-Venezia Giulia, 18.2% in Piedmont, 13.2% in Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol, 10.2% in Liguria, 7.2% in Emilia-Romagna, 1.8% in Tuscany, 1.5% in the Marche and 1.0% in Umbria. The party got 59 deputies and 27 senators (39 and 19, respectively, in single-seat constituencies), helping the centre-left to win due to its victories in some Northern constituencies characterised by three-way races. The League won barely all the seats in the provinces of the so-called &quot;Pedemontana&quot;, the area at the feet of the Prealps, from Udine to Cuneo, encompassing Friuli, Veneto, Trentino, Lombardy and Piedmont. Lega Nord is stronger in the areas of the late Republic of Venice and among Catholics.

At the 2008 general election, Lega Nord scored 8.3% at the national level, slightly below the result of 1996: 27.1% in Veneto, 21.6% in Lombardy, 13.0% in Friuli-Venezia Giulia, 12.6% in Piedmont, 9.4% in Trentino-Alto Adige, 7.8% in Emilia-Romagna, 6.8% in Liguria, 2.2% in the Marche, 2.0% in Tuscany and 1.7% in Umbria.

At the 2009 European Parliament election, Lega Nord won 10.2% of the vote: 28.4% in Veneto, 22.7% in Lombardy, 17.5% in Friuli-Venezia Giulia, 15.7% in Piedmont, 9.9% in Trentino-Alto Adige, 11.1% in Emilia-Romagna, 9.9% in Liguria, 5.5% in the Marche, 4.3% in Tuscany and 3.6% in Umbria. At the 2014 European Parliament election, the party scored 15.2% in Veneto and 14.6% in Lombardy.

At the 2010 regional elections, the party gained 35.2% of the vote in Veneto, 26.2% in Lombardy, 16.7% in Piedmont, 13.7% in Emilia-Romagna, 10.2% in Liguria, 6.3% in the Marche, 6.5% in Tuscany and 4.3% in Umbria. At the 2014–2015 regional elections, it obtained 40.9% in Veneto, 20.3% in Liguria, 19.4% in Emilia-Romagna, 16.2% in Tuscany, 14.0% in Umbria and 13.0% in Marche, marking its best results so far in those six regions.

The 2013 general election was not a good moment for the party, which gained meagre results, e.g. 12.9% in Lombardy and 10.5% in Veneto.

Five years later, the party obtained its best results so far in the 2018 general election: 17.4% in Italy, 32.2% in Veneto, 28.0% in Lombardy, 26.7% in Trentino, 25.8% in Friuli-Venezia Giulia, 22.6% in Piedmont, 20.2% in Umbria, 19.9% in Liguria, 19.2% in Emilia-Romagna, as well as significant results in the South (5–10%).

In the 2019 European Parliament election the party again increased its share of the vote: 34.3% in Italy, 49.9% in Veneto, 43.4% in Lombardy, 42.6% in Friuli-Venezia Giulia, 37.7% in Trentino, 38.2% in Umbria, 38% in Marche, 37.1% in Piedmont, 33.9% in Liguria, 33.8% in Emilia-Romagna, 31.5% in Tuscany, as well as 15-25% in the South.

== Name and symbols ==

Thanks to its use of the figure of Alberto da Giussano—legendary warrior of the Lombard League during the Battle of Legnano—in his iconography and campaigns, the LN has been nicknamed &quot;il Carroccio&quot; by the Italian media, a reference to a four-wheeled war altar used during the battle. Later on, the &quot;sun of the Alps&quot; was chosen as a symbol of Padanian nationalism. The party also made &quot;Va, pensiero&quot; by Giuseppe Verdi Padania&#x27;s &quot;national&quot; anthem.

<text>The Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (RSPCA) is a charity operating in England and Wales which promotes animal welfare. The RSPCA is funded primarily by voluntary donations. Founded in 1824, it is the oldest and largest animal welfare organisation in the world, and is one of the largest charities in the UK. The organisation also does international outreach work across Europe, Africa and Asia.

The charity&#x27;s work has inspired the creation of similar groups in other jurisdictions, starting with the Ulster Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (founded in 1836), and including the Scottish Society for Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (1839), the Dublin Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (1840), the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (1866), the Royal New Zealand Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (1882), the Singapore Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (1959) and various groups which eventually came together as the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Australia (1981), the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (Hong Kong) (1997) – formerly known as the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (Hong Kong) (1903–1997).

==History==


=== Changing political climate ===
The emergence of the RSPCA has its roots in the intellectual climate of the late 18th and early 19th centuries in Britain where opposing views were exchanged in print concerning the use of animals. The harsh use and maltreatment of animals in hauling carriages, scientific experiments (including vivisection), and cultural amusements of fox-hunting, bull-baiting and cock fighting were among some of the matters that were debated by social reformers, clergy, and parliamentarians. At the beginning of the 19th century there was an unsuccessful attempt by Sir William Pulteney on 18 April 1800 to pass legislation through the British parliament to ban the practice of bull-baiting. In 1809 Lord Erskine (1750–1823) introduced an anti-cruelty bill which was passed in the House of Lords but was defeated in a vote in the House of Commons. Erskine in his parliamentary speech combined the vocabulary of animal rights and trusteeship with a theological appeal to biblical passages opposing cruelty. A later attempt to pass anti-cruelty legislation was spearheaded by the Irish parliamentarian Richard Martin and in 1822 an anti-cruelty to cattle bill (sometimes called Martin&#x27;s Act) became law.

=== Formation of the SPCA and royal patronage ===
Martin&#x27;s Act was supported by various social reformers who were not parliamentarians, and the efforts of the Reverend Arthur Broome (1779–1837) to create a voluntary organisation to promote kindness toward animals resulted in the founding of an informal network. Broome canvassed opinions in letters that were published or summarised in various periodicals in 1821. Broome organised a meeting and extended invitations to various reformers that included parliamentarians, clergy and lawyers. The meeting was held on Wednesday 16 June 1824 in Old Slaughter&#x27;s Coffee House, London. The meeting was chaired by Thomas Fowell Buxton MP (1786–1845) and the resolution to establish the society was voted on. Among the others who were present as founding members were Sir James Mackintosh MP, Richard Martin, William Wilberforce, Basil Montagu, John Ashley Warre, the Rev. George Bonner, the Rev. George Avery Hatch, Sir James Graham, John Gilbert Meymott, William Mudford, and Lewis Gompertz. The organisation was founded as the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. Broome was appointed as the society&#x27;s first honorary secretary. The foundation is marked by a plaque on the modern day building at 77–78 St Martin&#x27;s Lane.

The society was the first animal welfare charity to be founded in the world. In 1824 it brought 63 offenders before the courts. Princess Victoria became the society&#x27;s patron in 1835, and, as Queen, granted its royal status in 1840 to become the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, as it is today.

=== RSPCA Inspectors ===
The origins of the role of the RSPCA inspector stem from Broome&#x27;s efforts in 1822 to personally bring to court some individuals against whom charges of cruelty were heard. Broome employed and personally paid the salary for an inspector to monitor the abuse of animals at the Smithfield Market. The inspector hired by Broome, Charles Wheeler, served in the capacity of an inspector from 1824 to 1826 but his services were terminated when the society&#x27;s revenue was exceeded by its debts. The accrued debts led to a suspension of operations when Broome as the society&#x27;s guarantor for debts was imprisoned. When operations resumed there was some divided opinions in the committees that steered the society about employing inspectors, which resulted in a resolution in 1832 to discontinue employing an inspector. The permanent appointment of a salaried inspector was settled in 1838, and the inspector is the image best known of the organisation today.

Broome&#x27;s experience of bankruptcy and prison created difficulties for him afterwards and he stood aside as the society&#x27;s first secretary in 1828 and was succeeded by the co-founding member Lewis Gompertz. Unlike the other founder members who were Christians, Gompertz was a Jew and despite his abilities in campaigning against cruelty, fund-raising and administrative skills, tensions emerged between him and other committee members, due to Gompertz&#x27;s approach, considered very radical at the time, in opposition to hunting and other forms of using animals he regarded as abusive. The tensions led to the convening of a meeting in early 1832 which led to Gompertz resigning. His resignation coincided with a resolution adopted in 1832 that &quot;the proceedings of the Society were entirely based on the Christian faith and Christian principles.&quot;

=== Impacting public opinions ===
Alongside the society&#x27;s early efforts to prosecute offenders who maltreated animals, there were efforts made to promote kindly attitudes toward animals through the publication of books and tracts as well as the fostering of annual sermons preached against cruelty on behalf of the society. The first annual anti-cruelty sermon that was preached on behalf of the society was delivered by Rev Dr Rudge in March 1827 at the Whitechapel Church. In 1865 the RSPCA looked for a way to consolidate and further influence public opinion on animal welfare by encouraging an annual &quot;Animal Sunday&quot; church service where clergy would preach sermons on anti-cruelty themes and the very first sermon was delivered in London on 9 July 1865 by the Rev. Arthur Penrhyn Stanley (1815–1881), the Dean of Westminster. The &quot;Animal Sunday&quot; service became an annual event in different church gatherings in England, which was later adopted by churches in Australia and New Zealand in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century, and it was the forerunner of the &quot;pet blessing&quot; services that emerged in the 1970s. In the twentieth century the RSPCA widened the horizons in the public domain by promoting an annual &quot;animal welfare week&quot;.

The RSPCA also had annual accounts published in newspapers, like The Londoner, where the secretary would discuss improvements, report cases, and remind the public to watch over their animals&#x27; health.

During the second half of 1837 the society sponsored an essay-writing competition with a benefactor offering a prize of one hundred pounds for the winning entry. The terms of the competition stipulated:
&quot;The Essay required is one which shall morally illustrate, and religiously enforce, the obligation of man towards the inferior and dependent creatures – their protection and security from abuse, more especially as regards those engaged in service, and for the use and benefit of mankind-on the sin of cruelty – the infliction of wanton or unnecessary pain, taking the subject under its various denominations – exposing the specious defence of vivisection on the ground of its being for the interests of science – the supplying the infinite demands on the poor animal in aid of human speculations by exacting extreme labour, and thereby causing excessive suffering – humanity to the brute as harmonious with the spirit and doctrines of Christianity, and the duty of man as a rational and accountable creature.&quot; 

There were 34 essays submitted and in December 1838 the prize was awarded to the Congregational minister Rev John Styles. Styles published his book-length work, &quot;The Animal Creation; its claims on our humanity stated and enforced&quot;, and all proceeds of sale were donated to the society. Other contestants, such as David Mushet and William Youatt, the society&#x27;s veterinarian, also published their essays. One entrant whose work was submitted a few days after the competition deadline, and which was excluded from the competition was written by the Unitarian minister William Hamilton Drummond and he published his text in 1838, &quot;The Rights of Animals: And Man&#x27;s Obligation to Treat Them with Humanity&quot;. This competition set a precedent for subsequent RSPCA prize-winning competitions.

=== Women in the RSPCA ===
The role of women in the society began shortly after the organisation was founded. At the society&#x27;s first annual meeting in 1825, which was held at the Crown and Anchor Tavern on 29 June 1825, the public notice that announced the gathering specifically included appropriate accommodation for the presence of women members. Several women of social standing were listed as patronesses of the society, such as the Duchess of Buccleuch, Dowager Marchioness of Salisbury, Dowager Countess Harcourt, Lady Emily Pusey, Lady Eyre and Lady Mackintosh. In 1837 the novelist Catherine Grace Godwin (1798–1845) described in her novel &quot;Louisa Seymour&quot; an incident where two leading female characters were aghast at the behaviour of a driver abusing a horse pulling a carriage that they subsequently discussed the problem of cruelty with other characters one of whom, called Sir Arthur Beauchamp, disclosed that he was a member of the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. In 1839 another female supporter of the society, Sarah Burdett, a relative of the philanthropist Angela Burdett-Coutts and a poet, published her theological understanding of the rights of animals. However it was not until 12 July 1870 that the RSPCA Ladies&#x27; Committee was established. Through the Ladies Committee various activities were sponsored including essay-prize competitions among children, and the formation of the Band of Mercy as a movement to encourage children to act kindly toward animals.

Women were debarred from membership of the RSPCA&#x27;s executive committee until 1906.

=== International relations ===
In the 19th century the RSPCA fostered international relations on the problem of cruelty through the sponsoring of conferences and in providing basic advice on the establishment of similar welfare bodies in North America and in the colonies of the British Empire. The RSPCA celebrated its jubilee in June 1874 by holding an International Congress on Prevention of Cruelty to Animals and Queen Victoria delivered a letter of congratulations to the RSPCA on its anniversary. Although the society was founded by people who were mostly Christian social reformers, and in 1832 presented itself as a Christian charity concerned with welfare as well as moral reform, the RSPCA gradually developed into a non-religious, non-sectarian animal welfare charity.

=== Lobbying for legal change ===
The RSPCA lobbied Parliament throughout the 19th century, resulting in a number of new laws. The Cruelty to Animals Act 1835 amended Martin&#x27;s Act and outlawed baiting. There was a public groundswell of opinions that were divided into opposing factions concerning vivisection, where Charles Darwin (1809–1882) campaigned on behalf of scientists to conduct experiments on animals while others, such as Frances Power Cobbe (1822–1904) formed an anti-vivisection lobby. The stance adopted by the RSPCA was one of qualified support for legislation. This qualified support for experiments on animals was at odds with the stance taken by Society&#x27;s founder Broome who had in 1825 sought medical opinions about vivisection and he published their anti-vivisection sentiments. It was also a departure from the 1837 essay-competition (discussed above) where the essayists were obliged to expose &quot;the specious defence of vivisection on the ground of its being for the interests of science.&quot; In 1876 the Cruelty to Animals Act was passed to control animal experimentation. In 1911 Parliament passed Sir George Greenwood&#x27;s Animal Protection Act. Since that time the RSPCA has continued to play an active role, both in the creation of animal welfare legislation and in its enforcement. An important recent new law has been the Animal Welfare Act 2006 (c. 45).

=== First World War – present ===
During the First World War the RSPCA provided support for the Army Veterinary Corps in treating animals such as donkeys, horses, dogs and birds that were co-opted into military service as beasts of burden, messengers and so forth. However, the RSPCA estimates that 484,143 horses, mules, camels and bullocks were killed in British service during the war.

The RSPCA&#x27;s centenary in 1924 and its 150th anniversary in 1974 were accompanied by books telling the society&#x27;s story. During World War II it was reported that the RSPCA had rescued 256,000 animals during bombing raids. Bernard Montgomery sent a letter of appreciation to the RSPCA, commenting that the Society had alleviated the suffering of animals during the war.

Since the end of the Second World War the development of intense agricultural farming practices has raised many questions for public debate concerning animal welfare legislation and the role of the RSPCA. This development has included debates both inside the RSPCA (e.g. the RSPCA Reform Group) as well as among ethicists, social activists and supporters of claims for animal rights outside of it concerning the society&#x27;s role in ethical and legal issues involving the use of animals.

===Publications===

The RSPCA&#x27;s official publication, &quot;The Animal World: A Monthly Advocate of Humanity&quot; was released in October 1869. It was inspired by the MSPCA&#x27;s publication &quot;Our Dumb Animals&quot; which had been created a year before. The &quot;Animal World&quot; magazine defined its objective as &quot;to protect animals from torture and ameliorate their condition, and to awaken in the minds of men a proper sense of the claims of creatures placed under their dominion&quot;. It was edited by John Colam the then secretary of the RSPCA from 1869–1905. In 1883, the RSPCA Ladies&#x27; Committee took over the Band of Mercy&#x27;s magazine &quot;The Bang of Mercy Advocate&quot; and renamed it simply, &quot;Band of Mercy&quot;. Colam was also its editor until 1905. Both magazines were formed to educate people about treating animals more kindly. The &quot;Animal World&quot; magazine was published up until the 1990s. Copies are stored at the RSPCA Archive in Horsham, West Sussex and digitized by the NC State University Libraries.

The RSPCA currently publishes an annual review and the &quot;Animal Life&quot; magazine twice a year for members.

==Animal welfare establishments==
RSPCA centres, hospitals and branches operate throughout England and Wales. In 2012 RSPCA centres and branches assisted and rehomed 55,459 animals.

===Hospitals===
In 2013 the society owned four animal hospitals, Birmingham, Greater Manchester, Putney (south London) and the Harmsworth Memorial Hospital in Finsbury Park (north London), and a number of clinics which provide treatments to those who could not otherwise afford it, neuter animals, and accept animals from the RSPCA inspectorate. As of September 2020, the Putney Animal Hospital has been permanently closed.

===Centres===
RSPCA animal centres deal with a wide range of injured and rescued animals, working alongside its inspectorate, volunteers, and others to ensure that each animal is found a new home. There are currently 17 RSPCA animal centres across the UK and a further 42 centres ran independently by Branches.

In 2013 the society had four wildlife centres at East Winch (Norfolk), West Hatch (Somerset), Stapeley Grange (Cheshire) and Mallydams Wood (East Sussex), which provide treatment to sick, injured and orphaned wild animals to maximise their chances of a successful return to the wild.
*closed as of September 2020

==Organisation and structure==

===National organisation===
At the national level, the charity comprises all central functions, and a number of animal hospitals and centres. This national charity also employs local inspectors and Animal Rescue Officers (AROs) to respond to urgent calls. In additional to this there is a National Control Centre which takes calls from the public and helps ensure that RSPCA officers attend incidents where animals need help, the National Control Centre is however, a third party contract and are not RSPCA employees.

In previous years the National Headquarters located at Southwater in West Sussex houses several general departments, each with a departmental head, consistent with the needs of any major organisation. The current chief executive officer is Chris Sherwood. Since the pandemic the RSPCA no longer has a National Headquarters, with most employees now working from home and small satellite offices being set up in locations such as Horsham and London.

===Regions===
There are three regions (&quot;North&quot;, &quot;South&quot;, and &quot;East, Midlands and Wales&quot;), each headed by a regional superintendent who has responsibility for the chief inspectors, inspectors and AROs. The regional managers are expected to have a broad understanding of operations throughout their regions.

===Branches===

RSPCA branches operate locally across England and Wales. Branches are separately registered charities operating at a local level and are run by volunteers. Some RSPCA branches are self-funding and raise money locally to support the animal welfare work they do. They find homes for about three-quarters of all animals taken in by the RSPCA. RSPCA branches also offer advice, microchipping, neutering and subsidised animal treatments. In 2013 there were also about 1000 RSPCA shops.

===Groups===
Each region of the RSPCA contains groups of inspectorate staff. A group is headed by a chief inspector, who might typically be responsible 6-12 officers (Inspector and AROs), working with several local branches. There is also a small number of market inspectors across the country.

=== Inspectorate rank insignia ===
==Mission statement and charitable status==

The RSPCA is a registered charity (no. 219099) that relies on donations from the public. The RSPCA states that its mission as a charity is, by all lawful means, to prevent cruelty, promote kindness and to alleviate the suffering of animals.

RSPCA inspectors respond to calls from the public to investigate alleged mistreatment of animals. They offer advice and assistance to improve animal welfare, and in some cases prosecute under laws such as the Animal Welfare Act 2006.

Animals rescued by the RSPCA are treated, rehabilitated and rehomed or released wherever possible.

The RSPCA brings private prosecution (a right available to any civilian) against those it believes, based on independent veterinary opinion, have caused neglect to an animal under laws such as the Animal Welfare Act 2006. The society has its own legal department and veterinary surgeons amongst the resources which facilitate such private prosecutions. All prosecutions are brought via independent solicitors acting for the RSPCA, as the association has no legal enforcement powers or authority in its own right.

In May 2012 the RSPCA launched its own mobile virtual network operator service, RSPCA Mobile, in partnership with MVNO whitelabel service Shebang. RSPCA Mobile claimed to be the first charity mobile phone network in the UK. The agreement included provisions such that the RSPCA would receive up to 15% of top-ups made on the network and it was expected the network would raise £50,000 in the first year of operations. RSPCA Mobile ceased service in October 2014.

==Legal standing==

In 1829 when the first recognisable police force was established in England, they adopted a similar uniform to that of RSPCA inspectors who had been wearing uniforms since the charity&#x27;s beginning in 1824. This adoption has led to similarities in the RSPCA rank names and rank insignia with British police ranks, which has led some critics (such as Chris Newman, chairman of the Federation of Companion Animal Societies) to suggest an attempt to &quot;adopt&quot; police powers in the public imagination.

An RSPCA inspector may also verbally caution a member of the public, similar to that used by the police, i.e. &quot;You do not have to say anything. But it may harm your defence if you do not mention when questioned something which you later rely on in court. Anything you do say may be given in evidence&quot;; this may strengthen the perception that the RSPCA has statutory powers. 
When Richard Girling of &quot;The Times&quot; asked about its lack of powers, a spokesman for the RSPCA said &quot;We would prefer you didn&#x27;t publish that, but of course it&#x27;s up to you&quot;. Chris Newman claimed that the RSPCA &quot;impersonate police officers and commit trespass. People do believe they have powers of entry&quot;; however, he did not produce any evidence of such impersonation of police officers, and the society strongly denies the allegation.

Sally Case, former head of prosecutions, insisted that RSPCA inspectors are trained specifically to make clear to pet-owners that they have no such right. They act without an owner&#x27;s permission, she says, &quot;only if an animal is suffering in a dire emergency. If the court feels evidence has been wrongly obtained, it can refuse to admit it&quot;.

In 2012, a trial was halted and charges relating to nine dogs were thrown out of court after District Judge Elsey ruled that they had been wrongly seized, stating that the police and RSPCA acted unlawfully when they seized the animals without a warrant or a vet present to establish any suffering.

While the Protection of Animals Act 1911 provided a power of arrest for police, the British courts determined that Parliament did not intend any other organisation, such as the RSPCA, to be empowered under the act and that the RSPCA therefore does not possess police-like powers of arrest, of entry or of search (&quot;Line v RSPCA&quot;, 1902). Like any other person or organisation that the law deems to have a duty to investigate — such as HM Revenue and Customs and local authority trading standards — the RSPCA is expected to conform to the rules in the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 so far as they relate to matters of investigation. RSPCA officers are trained to state, following giving the caution, that the person is &quot;not under arrest and can leave at any time&quot;.

The Animal Welfare Act 2006 has now replaced the Protection of Animals Act 1911, and it empowers the police and an inspector appointed by a local authority. Such inspectors are not to be confused with RSPCA inspectors who are not appointed by local authorities. In cases where, for example, access to premises without the owner&#x27;s consent is sought, a local authority or animal health inspector or police officer may be accompanied by an RSPCA inspector if he or she is invited to do so, as was the case in previous law.

Following a series of Freedom of Information requests in 2011, to police constabularies throughout England and Wales it was revealed that the RSPCA has developed local information sharing protocols with a number of constabularies, allowing designated RSPCA workers access to confidential information held on the Police National Computer (PNC). Although RSPCA workers do not have direct access to the PNC, information is shared with them by the various police constabularies which would reveal any convictions, cautions, warnings, reprimands and impending prosecutions. Information regarding motor vehicles can also be accessed. The Association of Chief Police Officers released a statement clarifying that the RSPCA had no direct access to the PNC, and that in common with other prosecuting bodies, it may make a request for disclosure of records. This indirect access does not include any information that the RSPCA does not need in order to prosecute a case at court.

==Controversy and criticism==

===1925 film===

In 1925, Ada Cole and Jules Ruhl produced a controversial film for the RSPCA depicting the inhumane slaughter of export horses in Belgium that featured graphic footage taken at the village of Terhagon in 1914. Cole and Ruhl produced the film to aid their goal in obtaining the prohibition of live export of horses for slaughter. 

In October 1925, the Departmental Committee of the Ministry of Agriculture published a report which concluded that the footage showing horses being stabbed to death was staged and filmed on a street. The Committee alleged that butchers were paid to kill the horses for the Society&#x27;s film and the method of killing them with a knife without previous stunning was no longer used in Belgium during this period. Captain Robert Gee alleged that the film contained fake footage for the RSPCA&#x27;s financial profit. It became known as a &quot;faked film&quot; and damaged the public reception of the RSPCA. 

All charges were denied by the RSPCA who noted that the film had only been shown on several private occasions, one of which was for the Departmental Committee&#x27;s viewing. Edward G. Fairholme, chief secretary of the RSPCA defended the film, stating that &quot;it is absolutely false to say that the films were in any way faked, or that they were taken in the street. Enlarged photographs prove that the films were taken in the slaughter yards of the butcheries&quot;. Jules Ruhl was summoned by the Departmental Committee and affirmed on his honour that the film was genuine. He stated that he had recently spoken to the police and slaughtermen in Terhagon who confirmed that stabbing was the method of slaughtering used in that part of the country in 1914. In regard to the Committee&#x27;s conclusion, Cole suggested that this &quot;can only mean that in 1914 Monsieur Ruhl and I concocted a cruel and disgraceful plot and that in 1925 we lied before the committee&quot;. 

Cole denied the faked film allegations, arguing that the butcher and slaughterers who took part in the film were not paid by the Society and only received a small sum in the nature of tips. According to Cole; the slaughtering of horses was going on every Monday in villages near Antwerp and the film was genuine in depicting the method of slaughter that was used in the area at the time. The film was shot with arrangements with the Belgian police and was filmed in Terhagon, near Antwerp. 

A butcher, Frans Cools of Willebroek, signed an affidavit declaring that he was paid for his services. This was denied by Cole who stated that the film was not taken in Willebroek. The film was first shown by the RSPCA to the public on November 23, 1925 at Central Hall, Westminster. Women in the audience were in tears during the scenes of slaughter and were carried out of the hall. Captain Robert Gee who was present at the meeting repeated his allegations that the film was fake and had been made for financial profit but was not allowed to publicly speak to the crowd. Lord Banbury of the RSPCA and a London magistrate Cecil Chapman defended the film and denied all allegations. In January 1926, the RSPCA hired Messrs, Lewis and Lewis solicitors to issue a writ against Captain Gee, claiming damages for slander.

=== RSPCA Assured ===

The RSPCA operates a not-for-profit farm animal welfare assurance scheme. All farms on the RSPCA Assured scheme must comply with the RSPCA&#x27;s &quot;stringent higher welfare standards&quot;. RSPCA Assured assesses farms, hauliers and abattoirs and if they meet every standard, the RSPCA Assured label can be used on their food product. The RSPCA Assured scheme has received criticism from media coverage of animal cruelty that has taken place on RSPCA Assured farms.

===Fundraising in Scotland===
In 2009 the RSPCA was criticised by the Scottish SPCA for fundraising in Scotland and thereby &quot;stealing food from the mouths of animals north of the border by taking donations intended for Scotland.&quot; The RSPCA insists that it does not deliberately advertise in Scotland but that many satellite channels only enabled the organisation to purchase UK-wide advertising. In a statement, the RSPCA said it went &quot;to great lengths&quot; to ensure wherever possible that adverts were not distributed outside England and Wales, and &quot;Every piece of printed literature, television advertising and internet banner advertising always features the wording &#x27;The RSPCA is a charity registered in England and Wales. &quot;All Scottish donors, who contact us via RSPCA fundraising campaigns, are directed to the Scottish SPCA so that they can donate to them if they so wish.&quot; The Scottish SPCA changed its logo in 2005 to make a clearer distinction between itself and the RSPCA in an attempt to prevent legacies being left to its English equivalent by mistake when the Scottish charity was intended.

===Political lobbying===
The RSPCA is an opponent of badger culling; in 2006 there was controversy about a &quot;political&quot; campaign against culling, with the Charity Commission being asked to consider claims that the charity had breached guidelines by being too overtly political. The charity responded saying that it took &quot;careful account of charity law and the guidance issued by the Charity Commission&quot;. Years later, an RSPCA advertisement published in the &quot;Metro&quot; newspaper said: &quot;The UK Government wants to shoot England&#x27;s badgers. We want to vaccinate them – and save their lives.&quot;
However, more than 100 people complained to the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA), saying the use of the term &quot;exterminate&quot; was misleading. The advertising standards watchdog judged that the advert was likely to mislead the general public who had not taken an active interest in the badger cull saying, &quot;The ad must not appear again in its current form. We told the RSPCA not to use language that implied the whole badger population in the cull areas would be culled in future advertising.&quot; An RSPCA spokesman said it &quot;welcomed&quot; the judgement of the ASA to dismiss three of the areas of complaint about their advert but &quot;respectfully disagreed&quot; with the complaint which had been upheld.

In September 2013 the RSPCA deputy chairman Paul Draycott said that &#x27;too political&#x27; campaigns threatened the charity&#x27;s future and could deter donors. Draycott said that the RSPCA could go insolvent &quot;We have spent months discussing where we want to be in 10 years&#x27; time, but unless we develop a strategy for now we won&#x27;t be here then&quot;. In response the chairman Mike Tomlinson said &quot;The trustee body continues to place its full support behind the RSPCA&#x27;s chief executive, management and all our people who do such outstanding work&quot;. The accusations of politicisation remain unsubstantiated.

Paul Draycott also warned that the RSPCA fears an exodus of &quot;disillusioned staff&quot; with &quot;poor or even non-existent management training and career paths&quot; for employees. In response the RSPCA&#x27;s chief executive, Gavin Grant denied suggestions in the memo that there was &quot;no strategy&quot; in some areas, stating that there was no difficulty in attracting trustees or serious internal concerns about management.

In June 2014 RSPCA campaigner Peta Watson-Smith compared the conditions livestock are brought up in across the country to that of the Jews during the Holocaust. The comments were condemned by countryside campaigners and Jewish groups. In 2015 Watson-Smith was elected to the RSPCA ruling council. At the same election the RSPCA members also voted to give a seat on the ruling council to Dan Lyons.

In 2016 the new head of the RSPCA, Jeremy Cooper, made a dramatic, public apology for the charity&#x27;s past mistakes and vowed to be less political and bring fewer prosecutions in the future. The new chief executive admitted that RSPCA had become &quot;too adversarial&quot; and will now be &quot;a lot less political&quot;. Cooper said that the charity had alienated farmers in its aggressive campaign against the government&#x27;s badger cull and disclosed that it would be &quot;very unlikely&quot; to ever bring another prosecution against a hunt. Cooper later resigned after just on year in charge.

In April 2019 the RSPCA has faced a new fraud investigation held at south-east London branch over the alleged mishandling of funds by two men, who were arrested on suspicion of fraud. The suspected fraud was exposed during a financial audit of the south-east London branch.

===Euthanasia controversies===
The RSPCA also state that whilst a few of their own branches operate &quot;no kill&quot; policies themselves, its policy on euthanasia is:

There have been incidents where the RSPCA has apologised for decisions to euthanise animals. In 2008, the RSPCA was sued by Hindu monks over the killing of a sacred cow at the Bhaktivedanta Manor Hindu temple in Hertfordshire and 200 people protested at the RSPCA headquarters. On 13 December 2008, the RSPCA admitted culpability, apologised for the euthanising of the cow, and donated a pregnant cow to the temple as a symbol of reconciliation.

The RSPCA admitted that in 2014 it had euthanised 205 healthy horses. In one particular case 12 horses from a Lancashire farm that had been assessed by vets as being &quot;bright, alert and responsive&quot; and suffering no life-threatening issues were killed by the RSPCA.

===Prosecutions===
In May 2013 former RSPCA employee Dawn Aubrey-Ward was found hanged at her home when suffering from depression after leaving the animal charity. Aubrey-Ward was described by &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; as a whistleblower for the RSPCA&#x27;s prosecution practices. The RSPCA subsequently had a meeting with the Charity Commission over its approach to prosecutions.

On 7 August 2013 the BBC Radio 4 &quot;Face the Facts&quot; radio programme broadcast an episode called &quot;The RSPCA – A law unto itself?&quot;
The programme presented a number of cases of where the RSPCA has sought to hound vets and expert witnesses who had appeared in court for the defence in RSPCA prosecutions. In one case it sought to discredit the author of the RSPCA Complete Horse Care Manual (Vogel) after he appeared as an expert witness for the defence team in an RSPCA prosecution. The RSPCA later released a statement saying that this is untrue and that they do not persecute vets and lawyers who appear for the defence and as defence experts. There have been thousands of lawyers taking defence cases against the RSPCA and they have only ever made a complaint about one.

In November 2013 the RSPCA was accused of instigating police raids on small animal shelters with insufficient evidence that animals were being mistreated. The owners claimed that they were being persecuted because of their &quot;no kill&quot; policy of only putting animals down if they cannot be effectively treated. The RSPCA stated that their inspectors will offer advice and guidance to help people improve conditions for their animals, and it only seeks the help of the police where it considers there is no reasonable alternative to safeguard animal welfare.

===Governance===
The RSPCA has long been criticised for its governance with the Charity Commission describing it as below the standard expected of a large charity and in August 2018 issued the society with an official warning. The RSPCA made significant changes to its governance in 2019 reducing the size of its council from 28 trustees to a new board of trustees of 12 trustees with nine elected by the membership and three co-opted. The RSPCA also introduced term limits of nine years for its trustees and appointed its first independent chair, Rene Olivieri, in its 196 years of history.

<text>The Oxo Tower is a building with a prominent tower on the south bank of the River Thames in London. The building has mixed use as Oxo Tower Wharf containing a set of design, arts and crafts shops on the ground and first floors with two galleries, Bargehouse and gallery@oxo. The Oxo Tower Restaurant, Bar and Brasserie is on the eighth floor, which is the roof-top level with fine and casual dining. In addition to this, situated on the eighth floor is a viewing gallery open to the public. The third to seventh floors contain 78 flats owned by Redwood Housing. Much of the second floor can be hired out for events and weddings.

== Location ==
Oxo Tower Wharf is in the east of London&#x27;s South Bank cultural area in the London Borough of Southwark. A continuous riverside walkway passes in front of the building, and links it with other riverside attractions such as the Royal Festival Hall, the National Theatre, the Tate Modern and Shakespeare&#x27;s Globe.

The building is flanked to the west by Bernie Spain Gardens and Gabriel&#x27;s Wharf, and to the east by Sea Containers House. When viewing the tower, there are only a few places in which it can be seen. These include the Observation Point, the adjacent riverside walkway, the green at the back of the tower, and the two piers stood in front of the tower.

== History ==
The building was originally constructed as a power station to supply electricity to the Royal Mail post office, built towards the end of the 19th century. It was subsequently acquired by the Liebig Extract of Meat Company (Lemco) in the 1920s, manufacturers of Oxo beef stock cubes, for conversion into a cold store.

The building was largely rebuilt to an Art Deco design by company architect Albert Moore between 1928 and 1929. Much of the original power station was demolished, but the river-facing facade was retained and extended. Lemco wanted to include a tower featuring illuminated signs advertising the name of their product. When permission for the advertisements was refused, the tower was built with four sets of three vertically-aligned windows, each of which &quot;coincidentally&quot; happened to be in the shapes of a circle, a cross and a circle. This was significant because skyline advertising was banned at the time along Southbank.

Despite these windows being the building&#x27;s architectural focal point, there is no general public access to the tower which is restricted to maintenance tradesmen.

Lemco and the building were eventually purchased by the Vestey Group. For a long time the building was left derelict until the late 1970s and early 1980s where there were several proposals to demolish the building and develop it and the adjacent Coin Street site, but these were met with strong local opposition and two planning inquiries were held. Although permission for redevelopment was granted, the support of the Greater London Council (GLC) finally resulted in the tower and adjoining land being sold to the GLC in 1984 for £2.7m—who sold the entire site to the non-profit Coin Street Community Builders for just £750,000.

In the 1990s the tower was refurbished to a design by Lifschutz Davidson to include housing, a restaurant, shops and exhibition space. The tower won the Royal Fine Art Commission/BSkyB Building of the Year Award for urban regeneration in 1997, the RIBA Award for Architecture also in 1997, the Brick Development Association Award 1997, Civic Trust Award 1998 and The Waterfront Center USA Honor Award 2000. It includes hireable space and floors devoted to occupation. Regardless of the tower&#x27;s historical significance and multiple awards, it is yet to be classed as a listed building.

== Coin Street Community Builders ==
Coin Street Community Builders (CSCB) is a social enterprise and development trust which has redeveloped London&#x27;s South Bank. CSCB has reconstructed the surrounding 13 acres into co-operative homes, shops, galleries, restaurants, cafes and bars; a park and riverside walkway; sports facilities; by organising festivals and events; and by providing childcare, family support, learning, and enterprise support programmes. Income is generated from a variety of sources including the hire of retail and catering spaces, event spaces, meeting room spaces and conference venue spaces as well as the provision of consultancy services.

<text>The manipulation of the devil stick (also devil-sticks, devilsticks, flower sticks, bâtons fleurs, stunt sticks, gravity sticks, or juggling sticks) is a form of gyroscopic juggling or equilibristics, consisting of manipulating one stick (&quot;baton&quot;, &#x27;center stick&#x27;) between one or two other sticks held one in each hand. The baton is lifted, struck, or stroked by the two control sticks (&#x27;handsticks&#x27;, &#x27;sidesticks&#x27;, or &#x27;handles&#x27;), stabilizing the baton through gyroscopic motion.

Manipulating devil sticks is one of the circus arts and is sometimes called devil-sticking, twirling, sticking, or stick juggling.

==History==
Devil sticks are believed to have originated in China in the distant past as simple wooden juggling sticks. It was apparently brought to Britain sometime around 1813, when a publication mentioned that previous generations had not known of it.

The first scientific analysis of the physics behind the game, known as &quot;the Devil on Two Sticks,&quot; was published in 1855 by Benjamin Peirce.

==Variants==

Devil sticks vary widely in size and construction materials, but the batons are generally based on one of two basic designs: tapered and straight. Tapered batons are tapered from the ends towards the middle such that the middle is thinner than the ends. Straight batons are uniform in width but have weights attached to the ends. Rarely, a hybrid design consisting of a tapered baton with weights attached to the ends is used.

Devil sticks are usually constructed of wood, plastic, aluminum, or composite materials such as fiberglass or carbon fiber. They are most often covered with an elastomer that both increases the friction coefficient (grip) between the baton and handles as well as providing some protection against repeated drops. Infrequently, other coverings such as cloth, suede, or leather are used. Even more rarely, a vinyl or mylar covering which reduces the stick&#x27;s &quot;grip&quot; is used. 

Flower sticks have flower-shaped ends which slow down the movement of the baton and make learning some moves and tricks easier. Heavier and floppier ends allow for greater control by expanding the sweet spot with more weight and increasing the duration of the control phase of a stroke or lift due to the momentum and continued motion of the &#x27;flop&#x27; or &#x27;tassel&#x27; on the ends of the central baton.

Fire devil sticks (also known as firesticks) typically have an aluminum core and have fuel-soaked wicks on the ends to allow them to be set on fire for visual effect. Both flower and non-flower versions of firesticks exist.

Illuminated devilsticks can create interesting visual effects in darkness with the use of battery-powered electric &#x27;seed&#x27; bulbs; LEDs; or with phosphorescent or chemiluminescent materials.

<doc id="357404" wikidata="Q619536" url="?curid=357404" title="Apollo Kaggwa">
<text>Sir Apollo Kagwa (standard Luganda orthography spelling Kaggwa) (1864–1927) was a major intellectual and political leader in Uganda when it was under British rule. He was a leader of the Protestant faction and was appointed prime minister (Katikkiro) of the Kingdom of Buganda by King Mwanga II in 1890. He served until 1926. Kagwa served as prince regent from 1897 until 1914 when the infant King Daudi Chwa came of age. He was Buganda&#x27;s first and foremost ethnographer.

==Career==
Kagwa was an administrative apprentice at the royal palace of Buganda when the first Christian missionaries arrived in the 1870s. These palace apprentices, referred to as pages by European historians of the era, were bright youths from all over the kingdom sent to the palace to train as the next generation of leaders. He was one of the earliest converts to the Protestant faith. He nearly became one of the Uganda Martyrs when King Mwanga II fell out with the Christians a few years later. He was reportedly spared execution because he had already shown himself to be exceptionally capable as an assistant in the treasury.
From 1885 to 1887, the kingdom fell into a religious civil war with Protestants, Catholics, and Moslem factions vying for control. Kagwa, still in his twenties, was from early on recognised as the leader of the Protestant faction. A keen rifleman, Kagwa served actively in combat during these wars. The Moslems were in ascendancy in the early part of the war, and Kagwa and other Protestants spent some time in exile in the neighboring kingdom of Ankole.

==Prime minister==
King Mwanga, temporarily deposed, was restored in 1890 with the assistance of the Protestants, and Kagwa was named &quot;Katikkiro&quot; (Prime Minister). King Mwanga was again deposed in 1897 when he chose to reject foreign influence and fought an unsuccessful war with the British. An infant prince, Daudi Chwa, was named King (&quot;Kabaka&quot;) with Kaggwa as one of three regents. Kagwa was one of the negotiators of the Uganda Agreement, by which Buganda became a British protectorate with limited internal autonomy.

The Uganda Agreement of 1900 solidified the power of the largely Protestant &#x27;Bakungu&#x27; client-chiefs, led by Kagwa. London sent only a few officials to administer the country, relying primarily on the &#x27;Bakungu&#x27; chiefs. For decades they were preferred because of their political skills, their Christianity, their friendly relations with the British, There are their ability to collect taxes, and the proximity of Entebbe (the capital) was close to the Buganda capital. By The 1920s the British administrators were more confident, and have less need for military or administrative support. Colonial officials taxed cash crops produced by the peasants. There was popular discontent among the Baganda rank-and-file, which we can the position of their leaders. In 1912 Kagwa moved to solidify &#x27;Bakungu&#x27; power by proposing a second &#x27;Lukiko&#x27; for Buganda with himself as president and the &#x27;Bakungu&#x27; as a sort of hereditary aristocracy. British officials vetoed the idea when they discovered widespread popular opposition. Instead British officials began some reforms and attempted to make the &#x27;Lukiko&#x27; a genuine representative assembly.

==Travels==
He visited England in 1902 in his capacity as &quot;Katikkiro&quot; (Prime Minister), for the coronation of King Edward VII, accompanied by his secretary, Ham Mukasa.

==Books==
Kagwa authored many books on Buganda, including a general history &quot;Bassekabaka ba Buganda&quot;, a treatise on laws and customs &quot;Empisa z&#x27;Abaganda&quot; and a collection of folklore &quot;Engero z&#x27;Abaganda&quot;. His history of Buganda included brief histories of the neighboring kingdoms of Bunyoro and Ankole. Some of his books have been translated into English.

==Career==
He was a strong supporter of the establishment of modern education in Uganda. In particular, he was appalled by what he saw as a tendency of the sons of the nation&#x27;s leaders to grow up spoiled, in contrast to the spartan upbringing his generation received from the palace apprenticeship system. He worked with British missionaries to establish boarding schools, notably King&#x27;s College Budo, explicitly to keep young noblemen from growing up spoiled.

In 1918, he was made an honorary member of the Order of the British Empire for services in raising and organising native levies and local Defence Corps in the Uganda Protectorate.

==Personal life==
He had 23 children, including Michael Kawalya Kagwa (who served as &quot;Buganda&#x27;s Katikiro&quot; from 1945 to 1950)

==Quotes about Kaggwa==

&quot;… it was Kaggwa more than anyone else whom Mwanga abhorred. His personal contribution to Mwanga&#x27;s downfall is therefore enormous, as Mwanga himself pointed out in more than one letter.&quot;
* MM Semakula Kiwanuka 

&quot;... and just as Queen Elizabeth I had bestowed a knighthood on a notorious pirate, Francis Drake, so had King Edward VII bestowed a knighthood on Apolo Kaggwa. Sir Francis Drake and Sir Apolo Kaggwa were both predators and were honoured for their vices. Francis Drake delivered stolen Spanish gold and silver bullion and Apolo Kaggwa delivered Buganda&#x27;s sovereignty.&quot;
* Samwiri Lwanga-Lunyiigo, &quot;Mwanga II&quot; (2011), page 2 

&quot;The real head of the country, British officials excepted, is Apolo Kagwa, the Prime Minister or Katikiro. The page-boy who bore the scars of Mwanga&#x27;s rage has developed into a leader in war and a ruler in peace whose force of peace and character and genuine Christianity have made him a power for good.&quot;
* JD Mullins, &quot;The Wonderful Story of Uganda&quot; (1908), page 115.

The company&#x27;s production transitioned from highway coaches and other products to transit buses over the period 1953–1970, and during the years that followed, Flxible was one of the largest transit-bus manufacturers in North America.

==History==

In 1913, Hugo H. Young and Carl F. Dudte founded the Flexible Side Car Company in Loudonville, Ohio, to manufacture motorcycle sidecars with a flexible mounting to the motorcycle. The flexible mounting allowed the sidecar to lean on corners along with the motorcycle, and was based on a design patented by Young.

In 1919, the company dropped the first &quot;E&quot; in &quot;flexible&quot; and changed its name to The Flxible Company as the business looked for new opportunities to expand.

After low-priced automobiles became available in the 1920s, the motorcycle sidecar demand dropped and in 1924, Flxible turned to production of funeral cars (hearses), and ambulances, which were primarily manufactured on Buick chassis, but also occasionally on Studebaker, Cadillac and REO chassis, and intercity buses, initially (1930s and early 1940s) built on GMC truck chassis, and powered with Buick Straight 8 engines.

===Charles Kettering and General Motors===
Charles Kettering, a Loudonville, Ohio native and vice president of General Motors, was closely associated with Flxible for almost the entire first half of the company&#x27;s existence. In 1914, Flxible was incorporated with the help of Kettering, who then became president of the company and joined the board of directors. Kettering provided significant funding for the company in its early years, particularly after 1916, when he sold his firm, the Dayton Engineering Laboratories Company (Delco), to GM for $2.5 million. Kettering continued to serve as president of Flxible, until he became chairman of the board in 1940, a position he held until his death in 1958.

After selling Delco to GM in 1916, Kettering organized and ran a research laboratory at GM and, by the 1950s, held the position of vice president at GM. As a result of Kettering&#x27;s close relationship with both GM and Flxible, many GM parts were used in the production of Flxible vehicles, particularly prior to GM&#x27;s 1943 purchase of Yellow Coach, a competing bus manufacturer, of which GM had been a majority owner since 1925. For example, most Flxible ambulances, hearses and buses, from the mid-1920s to the early 1940s, were built on Buick chassis, and Flxible&#x27;s &quot;Airway&quot; model buses of the mid-1930s were built on a Chevrolet chassis.

In 1958, as a result of the consent decree from the 1956 anti-trust case, &quot;United States v. General Motors Corp.&quot;, GM was mandated to sell their bus components, engines, and transmissions to other manufacturers, free of royalties. However, in the early 1950s and prior to the consent decree, Flxible built a small number of buses with GM diesel engines while Kettering still served on the board. It has been postulated that GM may have made its diesel engines available to Flxible to reduce the criticisms of GM&#x27;s business practices that some felt were monopolistic. The same has been said about GM&#x27;s decision in the 1960s and 1970s not to produce a &quot;New Look&quot; transit bus with an 8-cylinder engine. However, it is also possible that GM chose not to enter that market because the potential sales did not warrant the added costs of engineering and production. Another result of the consent decree, which was not settled in its entirety until 1965, was that GM was barred from having any of its officers or directors serve as an officer or director for any other bus manufacturing company. That provision would have applied to Kettering, had he not died in 1958.

===Bus manufacturing===

In 1953, Flxible absorbed the bus-manufacturing portion of the Fageol Twin Coach Company, and accepted its first order for transit buses from the Chicago Transit Authority. In 1964, Flxible purchased Southern Coach Manufacturing Co. of Evergreen, Alabama, and built small transit buses at the former Southern Coach factory until 1976. Flxible was purchased by Rohr Industries in 1970, and a new factory and corporate headquarters were built in Delaware, Ohio, in 1974, with the original factory in Loudonville, Ohio, being used to manufacture parts and sub-assemblies. Flxible was sold to Grumman Corporation in 1978 and became known as Grumman Flxible. The name reverted to Flxible when Grumman sold the company in 1983 to General Automotive Corporation. In 1996, Flxible declared bankruptcy and its assets were auctioned. The last Flxible vehicles were produced in 1995.

===870 &quot;A&quot; frame problems===
In the mid-1980s, several Grumman 870 buses operated by the New York City Transit Authority (NYCTA) developed cracks in their A-shaped underframes. This prompted NYCTA President David Gunn to remove the entire fleet from service. Soon, several other companies reported cracked 870 &quot;A&quot; frames. However, the frame issues primarily affected NYCTA 870s and not the 870s owned by the franchisees of the New York City Department of Transportation, which were the first buses built with the problem rectified the following year. NYCTA attempted to get the remainder of its pending order for new buses transferred to GM, but was barred from doing so unless they could prove that the 870s were flawed and unsafe. The buses were eventually returned to Flxible, and were rebuilt and resold to Queen City Metro and New Jersey Transit. Grumman blamed the problems with the NYCTA 870s on NYCTA&#x27;s poor maintenance practices at the time, despite the fact that transit operations in Chicago, Connecticut Transit, Houston, Los Angeles and Orange County, California had also reported problems with their 870s. Regardless, NYCTA ordered fifty Metros in 1995, but Flxible closed its doors before the order was produced, and NYCTA obtained the remaining new buses from Orion instead.

===Last transit buses in service===
By the mid-2010s, very few transit systems were still operating any Flxible buses. Portland, Oregon&#x27;s TriMet retired its last Flxible buses in May 2015, after which the only known continued use of Flxible buses in service was by Charleston Area Regional Transportation Authority (CARTA) in Charleston, South Carolina, and by Metro Transit in Omaha, Nebraska. However, Omaha ordered replacement buses in summer 2018 and retired its last Flxible buses before the end of that year. Subsequently, CARTA retired its last Flxible buses in October 2019.

==Engineering program==
Flxible implemented a CAD program, CATIA, in the late 1990s to support production design. They were one of the first customers of IBM/Dassault.

==Production outside the United States==

Flxible&#x27;s intercity buses were popular in Mexico and in Latin American countries. However, high import duties into these countries limited sales. In the early 1960s, Flxible began licensing a producer in Mexico, DINA S.A. (Diesel Nacional), to manufacture Flxible-designed intercity coaches, and this continued until the late 1980s. In 1965 and 1966, Flxible also licensed its &quot;New Look&quot; transit bus design to Canadair Ltd., an aircraft manufacturer in Ville St-Laurent, Quebec.

In 1994, Flxible&#x27;s parent company, General Automotive Corporation, and three other American companiesRoger Penske, Mark IV Industries, and Carrierentered into a joint venture with Changzhou Changjiang Bus, a Chinese manufacturer located in Changzhou, Jiangsu province, to produce buses based on the Flxible Metro design and with the Flxible name. The resulting company, China Flxible Auto Corporation, manufactured buses in a variety of lengths, from to . These buses, which include both front- and rear-engine designs, and share only their general exterior appearance with the American-built Flxibles, were sold to many transit operators in major Chinese cities, including Beijing and Shanghai. A trolleybus version was manufactured for only one operator, the Hangzhou trolleybus system, which bought 77 units between the late 1990s and 2001. For these vehicles, Changzhou Changjiang supplied the chassis and Metro-style bodies to the Hangzhou Changjiang Bus Company (in Hangzhou), and that company equipped them as trolleybuses.

==Flxible Owners International==

Flxible Owners International (see external link) was founded in the mid-1980s as an offshoot of the Family Motor Coach Association, and is dedicated to the preservation of buses and coaches produced by Flxible. The organization holds a rally in Loudonville biannually, in even-numbered years and normally in mid-July, where many preserved Flxible coaches and buses may be seen.

The majority of vehicles owned by members are of the Clipper series (Clipper, Visicoach, Starliner) that were produced from the 1930s until 1967. However, there are also quite a few &quot;non-clipper&quot; Flxible coaches that are owned, maintained, and operated by proud Flxible owners. This includes the Starliner, VL100 (VistaLiner), Hi Level, and Flxliner as well as some of the more modern transit buses. Most of these vehicles have been converted to motor homes; however, there are still a few examples of seated coaches belonging to members.

<text>North American Bus Industries, Inc. (NABI) was a manufacturer of heavy-duty transit buses with its headquarters, bus manufacturing and assembly operations, located in Anniston, Alabama. Its products ranged from 31-feet to 60-feet in length, and were sold to operators throughout the United States and Puerto Rico. NABI&#x27;s U.S. operations also include an aftermarket parts division in Delaware, Ohio (at the former Flxible factory), and an after-sales service center at Mira Loma, California.

The company was acquired by New Flyer Industries in 2013, which in 2015 discontinued production of NABI&#x27;s product lines at the Anniston plant.

== History ==
Ikarus Body and Coach Building Works of Budapest, Hungary (Ikarus Hungary) was a very large bus manufacturer having multiple plants in Hungary, with a production output during the 1980s of over 13,000 buses per year. In the 1980s, Ikarus Hungary entered strategic partnerships with domestic assemblers to sell its Ikarus 280 articulated bus to the United States and Canadian transit markets as the Crown-Ikarus 286 (with Crown Coach in Los Angeles) and Orion-Ikarus 286 / Orion III (with Ontario Bus Industries in Mississauga, Ontario), respectively. Under these partnerships, partially finished rolling chassis were shipped from Hungary for local fitment of seats and drivetrains compatible with domestic transit fleets. Both partnerships were dissolved by the late 1980s.

Ikarus Hungary formed another partnership in 1989 with Union City Body Company, Inc. (UCBC) of Union City, Indiana to produce domestic variants of the and transit bus for the United States market as the 416 and 436, respectively. The partnership was incorporated as Ikarus USA, Inc. (Ikarus USA), which was responsible for assembling and marketing the buses to the United States market, with operations based in Anniston, Alabama. UCBC declared bankruptcy in 1992.

===American Ikarus, 1992–1996===
The company that is now known as NABI was incorporated in the US, in the state of Alabama, in November 1992, under the name American Ikarus, Inc. (American Ikarus). It was incorporated by the First Hungary Fund Limited, (FHF) a Jersey equity investment fund. Its incorporation was accompanied by FHF&#x27;s concurrent formation of a Hungarian holding company, North American Bus Industries, Kft. (NABI Hungary) owning the shares of American Ikarus. This arrangement—with American Ikarus as a subsidiary of NABI Hungary--(collectively The Group) resulted in FHF&#x27;s investment being Hungarian-based—in alignment with FHF&#x27;s objective of investing in business opportunities resulting from the political and economic changes then taking place in Hungary. American Ikarus simultaneously acquired the assets of Ikarus USA. Such assets included facilities in Alabama, miscellaneous equipment and inventory. Simultaneously with the formation of American Ikarus, the previously established strategic alliance between Ikarus USA and Ikarus Hungary was assigned to the newly incorporated American Ikarus.

At the time of incorporation, it was planned that American Ikarus would purchase unfinished buses from Ikarus Hungary under its strategic alliance, ship them to the U.S. and perform final assembly at its Alabama plant. This arrangement provided certain engineering and manufacturing benefits and allowed compliance with &quot;Buy America&quot; requirements of the Surface Transportation Assistance Act of 1982 which established American content requirements for federally assisted rolling stock procurements, including transit buses. Such vehicles had already been designed by Ikarus Hungary specifically for the U.S. market, with unfinished buses having been produced previously by Ikarus Hungary under the same strategic alliance with Ikarus USA. These vehicles were the Model 416 forty-foot standard-floor transit bus and its larger sibling, the Model 436 sixty-foot articulated transit bus.

The plant in Anniston, AL opened in 1993 under this business arrangement, performing final assembly operations, delivery and after-sales service using unfinished knock-down buses produced in Hungary. Delivery of unfinished buses was accomplished by rail shipment from Budapest to Bremerhaven, then shipment by roll-on/roll-off ocean vessels to Charleston, SC, and then by delivery on flatbed trailers to Anniston, AL.

At the time of incorporation, Ikarus&#x27; business was in decline due to unusual political and economic changes following the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989. Such decline continued after The Group&#x27;s formation, resulting in the shutdown of one of Ikarus&#x27; plants in Budapest. This plant was purchased from Ikarus Hungary by NABI, Kft. which simultaneously entered a license agreement with Ikarus Hungary allowing NABI, Kft. to produce its own unfinished buses in Budapest and deliver them to its subsidiary in Alabama for final assembly and delivery to U.S. customers. In 1994 The Group began use of this manufacturing arrangement with no further involvement of Ikarus Hungary other than its role as licensor of the Model 416 and Model 436 standard-floor transit bus designs; the license was dropped in 1996.

===North American Bus Industries, 1996–2006===
In 1996, the company began aggressive expansion of its aftermarket parts department which had previously supplied service parts only for its own products. This expansion was accomplished by hiring individuals previously employed within the aftermarket parts organization of the defunct Flxible Corporation, which had recently discontinued transit bus manufacturing and aftermarket parts operations in Ohio. Once hired, this group leased facilities in Ohio, and began to expand the sale of aftermarket parts to operators of competing makes of buses.

Also in 1996, American Ikarus, Inc. was renamed North American Bus Industries, Inc. due to the dissolution of its affiliation with Ikarus Hungary some years earlier, and because the company was easily and incorrectly confused with the no longer related Ikarus Hungary, which had fallen into further distress due to continued decline of its European markets.

In 1997, NABI Kft. was re-registered in Hungary from a limited liability company to NABI, Rt., a joint stock company, allowing it to raise capital via public offering. Thereafter, in August of that year, the company raised $US 27.1 million in a public offering, with its shares listed on the Budapest Stock Exchange. FHF retained approximately 56% of NABI, Rt. shares, with the remainder of the shares publicly traded.
Also in 1997, NABI Hungary was certified as conforming to the ISO 9001 quality and organizational standard, with NABI, Inc. becoming ISO 9001 certified the following year. In 1998, The Group also implemented the use of BaaN, an integrated enterprise resource planning system. Additionally, 1998 marked the first delivery of NABI&#x27;s new, 40-foot low-floor Model 40-LFW transit bus. (35-foot and 31-foot variants of this product were later derived). NABI announced it had won the first contract for the 40-LFW in January 1997, awarded by the cities of Phoenix and Tempe, both in Arizona.

NABI debuted the CompoBus at the City Transport Exhibit 99 in Toronto, Ontario, on May 25, 1999. The CompoBus used a one-piece composite body made from fiberglass and plastic resin, built for NABI by TPI Composites, Inc. in Warren, Rhode Island. NABI previously had announced its partnership with TPI in 1998, adding that three composite-bodied products would be developed: 30-foot and 40-foot low-floor transit buses, and a 45-foot motor coach. The first CompoBus orders were placed by transit agencies serving Santa Monica, California (40C-LFW) and Phoenix (45C-LFW) in November 1999, and 100 CompoBus models had been delivered five years later, by November 2004.

In 2000, The Group announced its move into the European bus market with NABI, Inc.&#x27;s debt-financed acquisition of all of the shares of the Optare Group, (Optare) of Leeds, U.K. for $US 28.5 million, making Optare a NABI, Inc. subsidiary. Anticipated benefits included immediate participation in the European market as well as eventual European market participation with a new, composite-structured bus then under development. Plans also included the derivation of certain left-hand-drive Optare products for U.S. and Hungarian markets.

Although NABI had previously expanded its Anniston facility in 1999 (new research and development center) and 2000 (new bus assembly plant), 2001 marked additional and substantial factory expansion, taking the Anniston plant from (under roof). 2001 also marked derivation of the 30-foot NABI Model 30-LFN which was a left-hand-drive derivative of the recently developed Optare &quot;Solo&quot; being sold in the UK. Sale of these small low-floor buses commenced to private and public operators within the U.S. An additional outgrowth of the Optare acquisition was the sale of a small number of full-size (11 meter) NABI Model 700SE&#x27;s the following year in Hungary. These were derived from the Optare Excel, and were produced on Scania chassis.
In 2002, NABI Hungary completed construction of a new plant in Kaposvár, Hungary. This new plant was purpose-built for the manufacture of the CompoBus, a new, composite-structured low-floor bus. Production of CompoBuses began in earnest in 2003, with a significantly greater portion of this particular NABI product produced in Hungary than with other NABI products.

This new CompoBus manufacturing arrangement—unique for NABI—resulted in these buses being short of the FTA&#x27;s normal Buy America requirements. However, NABI had sought Buy America waivers associated with the development of this new bus model, and had been granted two such waivers by the FTA. The first waiver allowed NABI to assemble its CompoBus outside the United States, and the second allowed it to count the composite chassis/frame as domestic for purposes of calculating the domestic component content of the vehicle. Both waivers applied to FTA funded procurements for which solicitations were issued within two years of the date of the waiver letter. That same year NABI introduced the 60-LFW, a new 60-foot low-floor articulated derivative of its 40-LFW model developed some years earlier.

In October 2004, NABI unveiled the new Model 60-BRT, which had been in development since early 2003. in response to LA Metro&#x27;s request for a 60-foot low-floor articulated bus with rail-like styling for use on its new bus rapid transit route. Delivery of production versions began the following year, and a shorter, 42-foot derivative was eventually produced, making its debut at the American Public Transportation Association Bus &amp; Paratransit Conference in May 2006.

After continuing disappointing financial results through 2004, NABI, Inc. sold its Optare subsidiary in 2005, and it also idled its composite bus production facility in Kaposvar, laying off 23% of its workforce in Hungary. The shutdown was due to uncertain future demand for the CompoBus and the weakened U.S. dollar. Also, in December 2005, the FTA refused to extend the previously granted waivers exempting the CompoBus from Buy America requirements.

===Under Cerberus, 2006–2013===
In early 2006, NABI entered a preliminary agreement with affiliates of Cerberus Capital Management, L.P. (Cerberus) for the acquisition of all of the shares of NABI, Inc. and the business assets of NABI Rt. This transaction was completed in February 2006. (Concurrently, the Hungarian company that was not being acquired changed its name to ExBus, relegating itself to asset management unrelated to NABI.)

In August 2006, NABI announced its acquisition of Optima Bus Corporation in Wichita, Kansas (Optima) for an undisclosed amount. A short time later, it was announced that Cerberus had also acquired Blue Bird Corporation of Ft. Valley, Georgia (Blue Bird) thus rendering it a &quot;sister&quot; to NABI, Inc.

In June 2007, Optima&#x27;s operations in Wichita were shut down, and work-in-process, inventory and tooling for Optima&#x27;s products were moved to NABI&#x27;s Anniston plant. At generally the same time, the work-in-process, tooling and inventory for Blue Bird&#x27;s commercial buses were acquired by NABI and was also transferred to NABI, Inc.&#x27;s plant. NABI, Inc. elected to retain the names these products, and began producing these smaller buses at its Anniston, AL plant, thus adding Optima and Blue Bird brands to its product portfolio.

Generally at this same time, NABI also shifted the manufacture of its standard-floor model 416 unfinished buses from Hungary to newly leased facilities adjoining its existing Anniston plant. Under this arrangement, standard-floor body structures and other vehicle elements are fabricated at the adjoining facility and are then towed a short distance into NABI&#x27;s final assembly operation.
In late 2007, NABI began re-commissioning its CompoBus production plant in Kaposvar, simultaneously shifting certain assembly operations to Anniston and thus rendering the CompoBus compliant with Buy America requirements. CompoBus deliveries resumed in 2008 without the need for further waivers from the FTA. Los Angeles County Metro placed the first order for revived CompoBus production in July 2008.

2008 also saw additional expansion at NABI&#x27;s Anniston plant with the installation of a new, robotic paint system. This expansion took the Anniston plant to approximately 1/3 million square feet under roof, not including adjacent leased facilities used for manufacture of standard-floor unfinished buses.

Attempts to integrate the production of the smaller Optima and Blue Bird buses into NABI&#x27;s operations eventually proved disruptive, and in 2010, NABI discontinued the production of its Optima and Blue Bird brand commercial bus products.
The following year, NABI commissioned a new fabrication shop at its plant, equipped with robotic laser cutting equipment as well as tube bending and other new fabrication equipment. At approximately the same time, new body assembly tooling for low-floor buses was installed at its adjoining body fabrication facility. With these changes in place, NABI shifted the manufacturing of its metal-structured low-floor unfinished buses from Hungary to the same facility that had already begun manufacturing NABI&#x27;s standard-floor products in Alabama a few years earlier.

Also in 2010, NABI unveiled its new 12-meter Sirius bus at its plant in Kaposvar, Hungary. This new product, produced on an MAN chassis, was developed for Hungarian public transportation operators.

In 2011, NABI unveiled new styling for its metal-structured low-floor product (&quot;nn&quot;-LFW) and its CompoBus. Restyling of both products was accomplished primarily by using a redesigned front mask, leaving the body structure unchanged from earlier versions of the same models. Also, a 40-foot CompoBus prototype incorporating the new styling was also produced.

NABI utilized various manufacturing arrangements throughout its history. Initially, rolling shells were assembled in Hungary and shipped to Anniston for finishing until 2011, when it began transitioning to produce its metal-structured products in Anniston; the transition was complete in late 2012. These metal-structured buses consisted of the standard-floor model 416 (40-foot length), the low-floor Model LFW (produced in 31-foot, 35-foot and 40-foot lengths) and the low-floor BRT (produced in 42-foot and 60-foot lengths). CompoBus shells were assembled at Kapsovár and finished in Anniston until the end of production in 2013.

===Under New Flyer, 2013–2015===
On April 30, 2013, after completing a large order of CompoBuses for the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority, NABI produced its final CompoBus in Hungary. At the same time, NABI elected to discontinue promotion of its Hungarian Sirius bus, thus ending all production in Hungary and relegating all manufacturing and final assembly activities to its facilities in the USA.
On June 21, 2013, New Flyer Industries announced the acquisition of North American Bus Industries, Inc from Cerberus Capital Management, L.P. (Cerberus) for $79 million. The deal was completed later that day. However, New Flyer continued the NABI name for its existing bus products, which continued in production for the time being. This made NABI a subsidiary of New Flyer, using the legal name of NABI Bus, LLC. The Blue Bird school bus production assets were not included in the sale to New Flyer; they remain owned by Cerberus.

A second restyling was implemented in March 2014. In June 2014, New Flyer announced that the NABI product line would be discontinued after existing orders are filled. The last bus, a 40-LFW which was built for the Dallas Area Rapid Transit system, was completed in late October 2015. Since then, New Flyer has exclusively produced its Xcelsior heavy-duty transit bus product line at the former NABI Anniston plant, under the new name of New Flyer of America, Inc. New Flyer invested $20 million to retool the plant for Xcelsior production in 2015; a second expansion of the plant to , costing an additional $25 million, was announced in September 2017 and opened in November 2018.

<doc id="357416" wikidata="Q243723" url="?curid=357416" title="Monomial">
<text>In mathematics, a monomial is, roughly speaking, a polynomial which has only one term. Two definitions of a monomial may be encountered:
# A monomial, also called a power product or primitive monomial, is a product of powers of variables with nonnegative integer exponents, or, in other words, a product of variables, possibly with repetitions. For example, formula_1 is a monomial. The constant formula_2 is a primitive monomial, being equal to the empty product and to formula_3 for any variable formula_4. If only a single variable formula_4 is considered, this means that a monomial is either formula_2 or a power formula_7 of formula_4, with formula_9 a positive integer. If several variables are considered, say, formula_10 then each can be given an exponent, so that any monomial is of the form formula_11 with formula_12 non-negative integers (taking note that any exponent formula_13 makes the corresponding factor equal to formula_2).
# A monomial in the first sense multiplied by a nonzero constant, called the [[coefficient]] of the monomial. A primitive monomial is a special case of a monomial in this second sense, where the coefficient is formula_2. For example, in this interpretation formula_16 and formula_17 are monomials (in the second example, the variables are formula_10 and the coefficient is a complex number).

In the context of Laurent polynomials and Laurent series, the exponents of a monomial may be negative, and in the context of Puiseux series, the exponents may be rational numbers.

In mathematical analysis, it is common to consider polynomials written in terms of a shifted variable formula_19 for some constant formula_20 rather than a variable formula_4 alone, as in the study of Taylor series. By a slight abuse of notation, monomials of shifted variables, for instance formula_22 may be called monomials in the sense of shifted monomials or centered monomials, where formula_20 is the center or formula_24 is the shift.

Since the word &quot;monomial&quot;, as well as the word &quot;polynomial&quot;, comes from the late Latin word &quot;binomium&quot; (binomial), by changing the prefix &quot;bi-&quot; (two in Latin), a monomial should theoretically be called a &quot;mononomial&quot;. &quot;Monomial&quot; is a syncope by haplology of &quot;mononomial&quot;.

== Comparison of the two definitions ==
With either definition, the set of monomials is a subset of all polynomials that is closed under multiplication.

Both uses of this notion can be found, and in many cases the distinction is simply ignored, see for instance examples for the first and second meaning. In informal discussions the distinction is seldom important, and tendency is towards the broader second meaning. When studying the structure of polynomials however, one often definitely needs a notion with the first meaning. This is for instance the case when considering a monomial basis of a polynomial ring, or a monomial ordering of that basis. An argument in favor of the first meaning is that no obvious other notion is available to designate these values, though primitive monomial is in use and does make the absence of constants clear. 

&quot;The remainder of this article assumes the first meaning of &quot;monomial&quot;.&quot;

==Monomial basis==

The most obvious fact about monomials (first meaning) is that any polynomial is a linear combination of them, so they form a basis of the vector space of all polynomials, called the &quot;monomial basis&quot; - a fact of constant implicit use in mathematics.

==Number==
The number of monomials of degree formula_25 in formula_9 variables is the number of multicombinations of formula_25 elements chosen among the formula_9 variables (a variable can be chosen more than once, but order does not matter), which is given by the multiset coefficient formula_29. This expression can also be given in the form of a binomial coefficient, as a polynomial expression in formula_25, or using a rising factorial power of formula_31:
:formula_32
The latter forms are particularly useful when one fixes the number of variables and lets the degree vary. From these expressions one sees that for fixed &quot;n&quot;, the number of monomials of degree &quot;d&quot; is a polynomial expression in formula_25 of degree formula_34 with leading coefficient formula_35.

For example, the number of monomials in three variables (formula_36) of degree &quot;d&quot; is formula_37; these numbers form the sequence 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, ... of triangular numbers.

The Hilbert series is a compact way to express the number of monomials of a given degree: the number of monomials of degree formula_25 in formula_9 variables is the coefficient of degree formula_25 of the formal power series expansion of
:formula_41

The number of monomials of degree at most in variables is formula_42. This follows from the one-to-one correspondence between the monomials of degree formula_25 in formula_44 variables and the monomials of degree at most formula_25 in formula_9 variables, which consists in substituting by 1 the extra variable.

==Multi-index notation==

The &quot;multi-index notation&quot; is often useful for having a compact notation, specially when there are more than two or three variables. If the variables being used form an indexed family like formula_47 one can set 
:formula_48
and
:formula_49
Then the monomial 
:formula_50
can be compactly written as
:formula_51

With this notation, the product of two monomials is simply expressed by using the addition of exponent vectors:
:formula_52

==Degree==

The degree of a monomial is defined as the sum of all the exponents of the variables, including the implicit exponents of 1 for the variables which appear without exponent; e.g., in the example of the previous section, the degree is formula_53. The degree of formula_54 is 1+1+2=4. The degree of a nonzero constant is 0. For example, the degree of −7 is 0. 

The degree of a monomial is sometimes called order, mainly in the context of series. It is also called total degree when it is needed to distinguish it from the degree in one of the variables.

Monomial degree is fundamental to the theory of univariate and multivariate polynomials. Explicitly, it is used to define the degree of a polynomial and the notion of homogeneous polynomial, as well as for graded monomial orderings used in formulating and computing Gröbner bases. Implicitly, it is used in grouping the terms of a Taylor series in several variables.

==Geometry==

In algebraic geometry the varieties defined by monomial equations formula_55 for some set of α have special properties of homogeneity. This can be phrased in the language of algebraic groups, in terms of the existence of a group action of an algebraic torus (equivalently by a multiplicative group of diagonal matrices). This area is studied under the name of &quot;torus embeddings&quot;.

<text>The Greens/European Free Alliance (Greens/EFA) is a political group of the European Parliament composed primarily of green political parties.

The group consists of four distinct European political parties, namely the European Green Party (EGP), Volt Europa (Volt), part of the European Free Alliance (EFA) and the European Pirate Party (PPEU).

== History ==

Formed following the 1999 European elections for the 5th European Parliament, the group has generally limited its membership to progressive parties. These European parties are joined by MEPs from non-aligned national parties, which have included the Dutch Europe Transparent (2004–2009) and the Swedish (2009–2014), German (2014–) and Czech (2019–) Pirate Parties.

=== 9th European Parliament ===
On 9 June 2019, following a pan-European vote of party members, Volt Europa chose to join the Greens–European Free Alliance group in the European Parliament.

=== 10th European Parliament ===
On 19 June 2024, the group elected Bas Eickhout, and re-elected Terry Reintke, as Co-Presidents of the group. On 25 June, the group elected the members of its bureau.

<doc id="357421" wikidata="Q46476" url="?curid=357421" title="Bozo the Clown">
<text>Bozo the Clown, sometimes billed as &quot;Bozo, The World&#x27;s Most Famous Clown&quot;, is a clown character created for children&#x27;s entertainment, widely popular in the second half of the 20th century. He was introduced in the United States in 1946, and to television in 1949, later appearing in franchised television programs of which he was the host, where he was portrayed by numerous local performers.

==Creation and history==
The character was created by Alan W. Livingston, and portrayed by Pinto Colvig for a children&#x27;s storytelling record album and illustrated read-along book set in 1946. He became popular and served as the mascot for Capitol Records.

The character first appeared on US television in 1949 portrayed by Colvig. After the creative rights to Bozo were purchased by Larry Harmon in 1957, the character became a common franchise across the United States, with local television stations producing their own Bozo shows featuring the character. Harmon bought out his business partners in 1965 and produced &quot;Bozo&#x27;s Big Top&quot; for syndication to local television markets not producing their own Bozo shows in 1966, while Chicago&#x27;s &quot;Bozo&#x27;s Circus&quot;, which premiered in 1960, went national via cable and satellite in 1978.

Bozo also appeared in a 1958–1962 animated series, &quot;&quot;, with Harmon providing the voice of Bozo. 

Performers who have portrayed Bozo, aside from Colvig and Harmon, include Syd Saylor (1950s on KTTV), Bob McNea (1959-1966), Earl Frank Cady (WJRT-TV, 1967-), Willard Scott (1959–1962), Frank Avruch (1959–1970), Bob Bell (1960–1984), and Joey D&#x27;Auria (1984–2001). Bozo TV shows were also produced in other countries including Mexico, Brazil, Greece, Australia, and Thailand.

David Arquette purchased the rights to the Bozo the Clown character from Larry Harmon Pictures in 2021.

==Franchises and licensing==

Bozo was created as a character by Livingston, who produced a children&#x27;s storytelling record-album and illustrative read-along book set, the first of its kind, titled &quot;Bozo at the Circus&quot; for Capitol Records and released in October 1946. Colvig portrayed the character on this and subsequent Bozo read-along records. The albums were popular and the character became a mascot for the record company and was later nicknamed &quot;Bozo the Capitol Clown.&quot; Many non-Bozo Capitol children&#x27;s records had a &quot;Bozo Approved&quot; label on the jacket. In 1948, Capitol and Livingston began setting up royalty arrangements with manufacturers and television stations for use of the Bozo character. KTTV in Los Angeles began broadcasting the first show, &quot;Bozo&#x27;s Circus&quot;, in 1949 featuring Colvig as Bozo with his blue-and-red costume, over-sized red hair and whiteface clown makeup on Fridays at 7:30 p.m.

In 1957, Larry Harmon, one of several actors hired by Livingston and Capitol Records to portray Bozo at promotional appearances, formed a business partnership and bought the licensing rights (excluding the record-readers) to the character one year after Livingston left Capitol. Harmon renamed the character &quot;Bozo, The World&#x27;s Most Famous Clown&quot; and modified the voice and costume, also changing the laugh to a distinctively hoarse, slightly deranged chuckle. He then worked with a wig stylist to get the wing-tipped bright orange style and look of the hair that had previously appeared in Capitol&#x27;s Bozo comic books. He started his own animation studio and distributed (through Jayark Films Corporation) a series of cartoons (with Harmon as the voice of Bozo) to television stations, along with the rights for each to hire its own live Bozo host, beginning with KTLA-TV in Los Angeles on January 5, 1959, and starring Vance Colvig Jr., son of the original &quot;Bozo the Clown,&quot; Pinto Colvig.

Unlike many other shows on television, &quot;Bozo the Clown&quot; was mostly a franchise as opposed to being syndicated, meaning that local TV stations could put on their own local productions of the show complete with their own Bozo. Another show that had previously used this model successfully was fellow children&#x27;s program &quot;Romper Room&quot;. Because each market used a different actor for the character, the voice and look of each market&#x27;s Bozo also differed slightly. One example is the voice and laugh of Chicago&#x27;s WGN-TV Bob Bell, who also wore a red costume throughout the first decade of his portrayal.

The wigs for Bozo were originally manufactured through the Hollywood firm Emil Corsillo Inc. The company designed and manufactured toupees and wigs for the entertainment industry. Bozo&#x27;s headpiece was made from yak hair, which was adhered to a canvas base with a starched burlap interior foundation. The hair was styled and formed, then sprayed with a heavy coat of lacquer to maintain its form. Occasionally the headpiece needed freshening, and was sent to the Hollywood factory for a quick refurbishing. The canvas top would slide over the actor&#x27;s forehead. With the exception of the Bozo wigs for WGN-TV Chicago, the eyebrows were permanently painted on the headpiece.

In 1965, Harmon bought out his business partners and became the sole owner of the licensing rights. Thinking that one national show that he fully owned would be more profitable for his company, Harmon produced 130 of his own half-hour shows from 1965 to 1967 titled &quot;Bozo&#x27;s Big Top&quot; which aired on Boston&#x27;s WHDH-TV (now WCVB-TV) with Boston&#x27;s Bozo, Frank Avruch, for syndication in 1966. Avruch&#x27;s portrayal and look of Bozo resembled Harmon&#x27;s more so than most of the other portrayers&#x27; at the time. Avruch was enlisted by UNICEF as an international ambassador and was featured in a documentary, &quot;Bozo&#x27;s Adventures in Asia&quot;.

The show&#x27;s distribution network included New York City, Los Angeles, Washington, D.C., and Boston at one point, though most television stations still preferred to continue producing their own versions. The most popular local version was Bob Bell and WGN-TV Chicago&#x27;s &quot;Bozo&#x27;s Circus,&quot; which went national via cable and satellite in 1978. It had a waiting list for studio tickets that eventually reached ten years.

Bell retired in 1984 and was replaced by Joey D&#x27;Auria. The WGN version successfully survived competition from syndicated and network children&#x27;s programs until 1994, when WGN management decided to exit the weekday children&#x27;s television business and buried &quot;The Bozo Show&quot; in an early Sunday timeslot as &quot;The Bozo Super Sunday Show.&quot; It suffered another blow in 1997, when its format became educational following a Federal Communications Commission mandate requiring broadcast television stations to air a minimum three hours of educational children&#x27;s programs per week.

In 2001, station management controversially ended production, citing increased competition from newer children&#x27;s cable channels. In 2005, WGN&#x27;s Bozo returned to television in a two-hour retrospective titled &quot;Bozo, Gar and Ray: WGN TV Classics&quot;. The prime-time premiere was No. 1 in the Chicago market and continues to be rebroadcast and streamed live worldwide during the holiday season each year. In 2003, Harmon released six of his &quot;Bozo&#x27;s Big Top&quot; programs with Avruch on DVD and 2 box sets of 30 episodes each in 2007 retitled &quot;Larry Harmon&#x27;s Bozo, The World&#x27;s Most Famous Clown Vols.1 &amp; 2.&quot; The WGN Bozo shows have not been released commercially in any video format.

On July 3, 2008, Larry Harmon died of congestive heart failure at the age of 83. On March 13, 2009, Alan W. Livingston died of age-related causes at the age of 91. On October 2, 2010, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that the father of U.S. Senate candidate Christine O&#x27;Donnell &quot;worked a series of small television roles before scoring his signature gig, playing Bozo the Clown.&quot; But upon further investigation, a &quot;New York Times&quot; follow-up two days later reported that the father, Daniel O&#x27;Donnell, was an assistant and understudy for the full-time local television Bozo in Philadelphia and would fill in for the full-time Bozo when the latter was unavailable.

==Bozo the Clown series by locality==
===Boston TV===
The Bozo franchise appeared on two separate Boston-area stations from 1959 to 1974.

====WHDH-TV Boston====
The local WHDH-TV Boston production of &quot;Bozo&#x27;s Circus&quot;, with Frank Avruch playing Bozo, aired daily from 1959 until 1970. In 1965, Larry Harmon became the sole owner of the Bozo licensing rights after buying out his business partners, and produced 130 episodes of the Boston-based Bozo show between 1965 and 1967 and syndicated them to local U.S. television markets that did not produce their own Bozo shows. The half-hour syndicated shows were retitled &quot;Bozo The Clown&quot; (on episodes with a 1965 date) and &quot;Bozo&#x27;s Big Top&quot; (on episodes with a 1966 date). Caroll Spinney (billed in the credits as Ed Spinney) appeared as various characters which included Mr. Lion and Kookie the Boxing Kangaroo. He later went on to portray Big Bird and Oscar the Grouch on &quot;Sesame Street&quot;. Carl Carlsson also appeared as Bozo&#x27;s sidekick Professor Tweedy Foofer. Ruth Carlsson also appeared in several 1966 episodes. Del Grosso played Clank the Robot in a few episodes. Harmon personally supervised the taping of these episodes, with Harmon-approved characters added, some based on characters in Harmon&#x27;s classic 1958–1962 animated &quot;Bozo&quot; cartoon shorts which also aired in each episode. These were the only Bozo shows Harmon fully owned. Bozo&#x27;s frequent exclamations on the show included, &quot;Whoa, Nellie!&quot; and &quot;Wowie Kazowie!&quot; and always ended the show with, &quot;Always keep laughing!&quot;

The Boston show also occasionally featured Nozo the Clown, the brother of Bozo, played by Bill Harrington. Nozo was used to fill in for Bozo on occasion when Frank Avruch was unable to appear on the show. Nozo did not wear the red ball on his nose that other Bozos wore. Instead, his nose was Harrington&#x27;s nose in makeup.

In 2003, Harmon released six of these shows on DVD and, in 2007, 30 of them in a DVD box set titled &quot;Larry Harmon&#x27;s Bozo, The World&#x27;s Most Famous Clown, Collection 1&quot;. A second box set was released later that year, also containing 30 of the half-hours; the second box set (&quot;Collection 2&quot;) includes the six episodes previously released on the two earlier single DVD releases, and also repeats one show from &quot;Collection 1&quot;, for a grand total of 59 episodes released on DVD altogether. Although the shows included on the two single-disc DVDs had contemporary computer-animated characters superimposed over some scenes, the 59 episodes included in &quot;Collections 1 &amp; 2&quot; are presented in their original form.

On March 20, 2018, Frank Avruch died of heart failure in Boston at the age of 89.

====WSMW-TV Worcester====
From 1970 to 1974, WSMW-TV, an independent station in Worcester, Massachusetts, west of Boston, produced &quot;Bozo&#x27;s Big Top&quot;, their local version of the Bozo the Clown franchise. Tom Matzell played Bozo, alongside Gene Sanocki as Bozo&#x27;s sidekick Professor Tweetyfoofer. Local children were featured on the program daily, with many waiting a year or more for their chance to be on the show.

===Detroit/Windsor===
Bozo first came to Detroit in 1958 on WWJ-TV channel 4. Bob McNea, who worked as a clown in various circuses, including the Shrine Circus, was hired to play Bozo. McNea&#x27;s Bozo became popular, expanding to two shows a day, and becoming the first children&#x27;s program in Detroit to switch to color. However, there was friction with Larry Harmon. McNea played the character in a more genteel and subdued way than Harmon&#x27;s playbook required, and McNea did the show without a live audience. After years of increasing the franchise fee, WWJ-TV ended the contract with Harmon in 1967. WWJ-TV kept McNea, who created his own clown character Oopsy, which continued on WWJ-TV until 1979. McNea then took Oopsy to CKCO-TV in Kitchener, Ontario where he continued for another 15 years.

Meanwhile, across the Detroit River in Windsor, Ontario CKLW-TV channel 9 picked up the Bozo franchise in 1967. Popular local talent Jerry Booth was tapped to play Bozo, but he only did the role for a few months. He was replaced by local disc jockey and radio program director Art Cervi, who was the definitive Bozo to Detroit families. Now titled &quot;Bozo&#x27;s Big Top&quot;, Cervi was joined by Larry Thompson as red-suited, turban wearing Mr. Whoodini, who had hosted his own children&#x27;s show &quot;Magic Shoppe&quot;, as his sidekick. Also on the show was piano player Mr. Calliope, played by Wally Townsend.

Unlike WWJ-TV, CKLW-TV included a live audience, but they also did things that were not sanctioned by Harmon. CKLW-TV quickly phased out the cartoons, increasing the entertainment on &quot;Bozo&#x27;s Big Top&quot;. After a taped opening in which Bozo runs through the streets of Detroit calling kids to his Big Top, and on set singing and dancing to the &quot;Bozo is Back&quot; theme song, with the illuminated, flashing Bozo sign superimposed over in a slightly psychedelic way, Cervi would preside over an hour long variety show that included local dance troupes, singers, musicians, live animals, and national celebrities. In between, kids would play games to win prizes (one of the most plentiful being a six-pack of Orange Crush), Mr. Whoodini would pick kids to assist him in magic tricks, and of course Bozo would provide comedy. Cervi was also a good singer, and one of the highlights were two or three times per show, Bozo would sit next to Mr. Calliope at his piano and sing a song, most of the time in Cervi&#x27;s own voice rather than his Bozo voice, with all the kids in the audience clapping in time to the music. The shows would usually end with Bozo and Mr. Whoodini going into the audience and letting kids tell jokes and riddles. At one point &quot;Bozo&#x27;s Big Top&quot; became so popular, that it aired twice a day.

In 1977, after the station&#x27;s conversion to CBC Television-owned CBET, the Canadian border protection and labor rules forced the station to cancel &quot;Bozo&#x27;s Big Top&quot; because most of the cast and staff were American. &quot;Bozo&#x27;s Big Top&quot; moved to WJBK-TV channel 2, where it lasted for two more years, and was syndicated to other markets such as New York, Las Vegas, Wichita, and Los Angeles. Due to WJBK-TV&#x27;s lack of interest in producing such an ambitious show, it was cancelled in 1979, ending Bozo&#x27;s twenty-year reign in Detroit and Windsor.

On November 5, 2005, Bob McNea, the first Detroit Bozo, died at the age of 76.

In 2014, a memoir of Art Cervi&#x27;s Bozo years, &quot;I Did What?&quot;, co-written by Herb Mentzer, was published.

On February 5, 2019, Larry Thompson, who played Mr. Whoodini, died at the age of 76.

On February 15, 2021, Art Cervi died at his Novi, MI home at age 86.
===Washington, D.C.===
Willard Scott played Bozo on WRC-TV from 1959 to 1962. Dick Dyszel played the character on Washington, D.C. broadcast TV, WDCA channel 20, in the 1970s to millions of viewers. Dyszel also played TV horror host &quot;Count Gore de Vol&quot; and hosted &quot;Captain 20&quot; afternoon kids&#x27; TV shows in D.C.

===Chicago TV===
The Chicago Bozo franchise was the most popular and successful locally produced children&#x27;s program in the history of television. It also became the most widely known Bozo show as WGN-TV became a national cable television Superstation. WGN-TV Chicago&#x27;s &quot;Bozo&quot; show debuted on June 20, 1960, starring Bob Bell on a live half-hour program weekdays at noon, performing comedy sketches and introducing cartoons. The series was placed on hiatus in January 1961 to facilitate WGN&#x27;s move from Tribune Tower in downtown Chicago to 2501 West Bradley Place on the city&#x27;s northwest side. WGN-TV&#x27;s &quot;Bozo&#x27;s Circus&quot; debuted on September 11, 1961.

The live hour-long show aired weekdays at noon and featured comedy sketches, circus acts, cartoons, games and prizes before a 200+ member studio audience. The program began airing nationally via cable and satellite in 1978, and studio audience reservations surpassed a 10-year wait. In 1980, the series moved to weekday mornings as &quot;The Bozo Show&quot; and aired on tape delay. In 1994, it moved to Sunday mornings as &quot;The Bozo Super Sunday Show&quot; and became &quot;education and information&quot; in 1997 following a Federal Communications Commission mandate requiring broadcast television stations to air a minimum three hours per week of &quot;educational and informational&quot; children&#x27;s programs. The final Bozo show, a primetime special titled &quot;Bozo: 40 Years of Fun!&quot; was taped on June 12, 2001, and aired on July 14, 2001. Reruns of &quot;The Bozo Super Sunday Show&quot; aired until August 26, 2001.

Cast members throughout the program&#x27;s 40-year run included Bob Bell as Bozo (1960–1984) (Bell&#x27;s voice was later the pattern for that of Krusty the Clown on &quot;The Simpsons&quot;), Ned Locke as Ringmaster Ned (1961–1976), Don Sandburg as Sandy the Tramp (1961–1969), Ray Rayner as Oliver O. Oliver (1961–1971), Roy Brown as Cooky the Cook (1968–1994), Marshall Brodien as Wizzo the Wizard (1968–1994), Frazier Thomas as the circus manager (1976–1985), Joey D&#x27;Auria as Bozo (1984–2001), Andy Mitran as Professor Andy (1987–2001) and Robin Eurich as Rusty the Handyman (1994–2001). Bozo returned to television on December 24, 2005, in a two-hour retrospective titled &quot;Bozo, Gar &amp; Ray: WGN TV Classics.&quot; The primetime premiere was No. 1 in the Chicago market and continues to be rebroadcast and streamed annually during the holiday season. Bozo also continues to appear on the WGN-TV float in Chicago&#x27;s biggest parades.

Allen Hall, the long-time producer, died September 6, 2011, after an 18-month battle with lung cancer at the age of 82. Hall worked at WGN for 40 years. He joined the station in 1961, a year after &quot;Bozo&quot; debuted on WGN, as the show&#x27;s director until 1966 and returned to the program as producer in 1973 until 2001.

Few episodes from the show&#x27;s first two decades survive; although some shows were recorded to videotape for delayed broadcasts, the tapes were reused and eventually discarded. In 2012, a vintage tape was located on the Walter J. Brown Media Archives &amp; Peabody Awards Collection Web site archive list by Rick Klein of The Museum of Classic Chicago Television, containing material from two 1971 episodes. WGN reacquired the tape and put together a new special entitled &quot;Bozo&#x27;s Circus: The Lost Tape,&quot; which aired in December 2012.

On October 6, 2018, Don Sandburg, &quot;Bozo&#x27;s Circus&quot; producer and writer from 1961 to 1969 and the last surviving original cast member, died at the age of 87. Four months later, WGN-TV paid tribute to Sandburg and the rest of the original cast with a two-hour special titled &quot;Bozo&#x27;s Circus: The 1960s.&quot;

===Grand Rapids, Michigan===
From 1966 to 1999, WZZM-TV produced a Bozo show, starring Dick Richards for the majority of the run. Significant is that when it was cancelled in 1999, it was the last Bozo show other than the Chicago WGN show to be on the air.

===Brazilian TV===

In 1979, Brazil&#x27;s most famous TV show host Silvio Santos (founder and owner of the SBT television network) decided to produce a national version of Bozo show for the former TVS-Record TV alliance station. Comedian Wandeko Pipoca was chosen by Larry Harmon to be the first Brazilian Bozo. Brazilian characters were created for the Brazilian Bozo show, like Salci Fufu — played by famous comedian Pedro de Lara — and Vovó Mafalda, played by Valentino Guzzo. With the clown&#x27;s large success in Brazil, two more actors, Luís Ricardo and Arlindo Barreto, were hired to play Bozo for additional shows which ran from mornings to afternoons and more comedians were chosen to play Bozo in other parts of the country. Brazil&#x27;s Bozo shows ended in 1991, following the death of Décio Roberto, the last actor to portray the clown in that country. Brazil&#x27;s Bozo won five &quot;Troféu Imprensa&quot;, a Brazilian award given to personalities and productions in the media (in 1984, 1985, 1986, 1987 and 1989), as well as three Gold Albums. In the last years of the program, UNESCO bestowed the Brazilian Bozo with its Ambassador of Goodwill recognition, for its outstanding success among children and the youth.

In 2012, when the audience of children&#x27;s shows started to fall, SBT decided to rehire the clown to a new building on the success of the program clowns Patati Patatá who also had a program on the same channel. But, unlike the 1980s versions, the character ended up being poorly received by the public. A criticism was having its premiere in early children&#x27;s program Bom Dia e Companhia, where he was abruptly inserted into the program, replacing one of the presenters. Bozo continued to show up to receive their own program in 2013 on Saturday mornings, but the program ended up being a failure and canceled after a month. After that the channel decided to return it to Bom Dia e Companhia, but after a while was removed and the contract to continue to use the character was broken.

===Mexican TV===
In 1961, Mario Quintanilla, chairman of XEFB-TV Channel 3 obtained the local rights of the Bozo Cartoons, including the authorization of the Bozo characterization. José Marroquín (who later became famous with his &quot;Pipo&quot; character) was chosen as the first Mexican Bozo. He portrayed the character on local XHX-TV Channel 10 Monterrey television shows until 1963, when the licensing rights ended. After that, José Manuel Vargas Martínez, under sponsorship by Antonio Espino (famous comedy actor of the late 1940s and 1950s, known by his nickname, Clavillazo), portrayed the character. He was the most famous Bozo in Latin America and created his own version of Bozo&#x27;s Circus, which traveled all along Latin America for decades. He started as a television artist participating in a dance marathon he won dressed as Bozo. After his success as Bozo, he traveled to several countries representing the Bozo character. He made special presentations in Italy, Greece, Spain, Hawaii and Canada with his circus. In 2000, he received the ANDA&#x27;s Arozamena Award for 50 years of uninterrupted career. He died one year later, October 19, 2001, due to a lung disease.

In Mexico, television star, comedian and political commentator Víctor Trujillo created the character &quot;Brozo, El Payaso Tenebroso&quot; (Brozo, the Creepy Clown) in 1988 as a parody of Bozo for a TV Azteca program with Ausencio Cruz called &quot;La Caravana&quot; (The Caravan). He pleased the audience with double-entendres and adult humor, telling sarcastic and sometimes obscene versions of classic children&#x27;s tales. Bozo once appeared as a guest in &quot;La Caravana&quot;. He became so popular that TV Azteca asked him to join the reporters and anchors during coverage of the FIFA World Cup in 1990, 1994 and 1998, also doing the same with Televisa for the 2002 World Cup. He also gave his commentary on the Olympics, starting with the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona, Spain until the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Greece. From 2000 to 2004, Trujillo as Brozo was the anchor of a popular and successful television news show, &quot;El Mañanero&quot;. It was first broadcast on Canal 40 XHTVM-TV and later Televisa&#x27;s 4TV from 2001 onwards. Trujillo discontinued the Brozo character following the death of his wife, producer Carolina Padilla, but brought back Brozo in a new television program that began in early 2006 on Televisa&#x27;s Canal de las Estrellas, &quot;El Notifiero.&quot; He is considered an influential political commentator in Mexico.

===Ronald McDonald===
Immediately following Willard Scott&#x27;s three-year-run as WRC-TV Washington, D.C.&#x27;s Bozo, the show&#x27;s sponsors, McDonald&#x27;s drive-in restaurant franchisees John Gibson and Oscar Goldstein (Gee Gee Distributing Corporation), hired Scott to portray &quot;Ronald McDonald, the Hamburger-Happy Clown&quot; for their local commercials on the character&#x27;s first three television &quot;spots&quot;. McDonald&#x27;s replaced Scott with other actors for their national commercials and the character&#x27;s costume was changed. One of them was Ray Rayner (Oliver O. Oliver on WGN-TV&#x27;s &quot;Bozo&#x27;s Circus&quot;), who appeared in McDonald&#x27;s national ads in 1968. In the mid-1960s, Andy Amyx, performing as Bozo on Jacksonville, Florida, television station WFGA, was hired to do local appearances of Ronald McDonald periodically. Andy recalls having to return the wardrobe to the agency after each performance.

==Actors==
The following is a partial list of Bozo television portrayers since the original (Pinto Colvig):
* Frank Avruch (1959–1970)
(Produced at WHDH-TV Boston 1965–1967 and syndicated to U.S. TV markets that were not producing their own local versions at the time, including New York City, Los Angeles &amp; Washington, D.C. These were the only Bozo shows that were wholly owned and syndicated by Larry Harmon Pictures Corporation, 60 of which are currently available on worldwide DVD distribution entitled &quot;Bozo The World&#x27;s Most Famous Clown&quot; Volumes 1 &amp; 2.) On March 20, 2018, Avruch died at age 89 after a long fight against heart disease.
* Bob Bell (1960–1984) at Superstation WGN Chicago
* Joey D&#x27;Auria (1984–2001) at Superstation WGN Chicago

A 2005 retrospective titled &quot;Bozo, Gar &amp; Ray: WGN TV Classics&quot; and 2019 special titled &quot;Bozo&#x27;s Circus: The 1960s&quot; continue to air annually. WGN&#x27;s Bozo show is recognized as the most popular and successful locally produced children&#x27;s program in the history of television, boasting a 10-year-wait for studio audience reservations and over 40 years in production.)

<text>Neoplan Bus GmbH is a German automotive company that manufactures buses, trolleybuses and coaches. It became a subsidiary of MAN Truck &amp; Bus SE in 2001.
==History==
===Early days===

The company was founded by (1903–1993) in Stuttgart in 1935, and manufactured bodywork for bus and truck chassis. By 1953, the company had moved away from manufacturing buses on truck chassis, to a partial monocoque design with a steel tube skeleton, providing the structural support, enhanced by welded side panels. The engine was moved to the rear. In 1957, air suspension was made available.

===1960s===
In 1961, a new bus design, the &quot;Typ Hamburg&quot;, was unveiled at the Geneva Motor Show. Developed by the founder&#x27;s eldest son, Albrecht Auwärter, and another student, Swiss national Bob Lee, as part of their dissertation at Hamburg University. The design was the first bus to allow passengers to regulate their fresh air supply through a nozzle from two air ducts, commonly seen in contemporary designs, as well as offering air suspension.

Both Albrecht and Lee joined Neoplan after graduating from university. Albrecht took over management of the company in 1965, and Bob Lee later became head of Engineering and Design.

In 1964, the founder&#x27;s second son, Konrad Auwärter, developed a double-deck bus design for a service bus as part of his dissertation. The &quot;Do-Bus&quot; design had low weight, and could carry over 100 passengers. It also featured a low-frame front axle with forward-mounted steering gear that permitted a low, flat floor. The double-deck principle was applied to the coach design, creating a high-capacity, comfortable touring vehicle. This vehicle was known as the Skyliner.

===1970s–1980s===
In 1971, the Cityliner was introduced to the public. This design had a passenger platform above the driver&#x27;s cab, and included an onboard toilet. The vehicle also made use of glass-fibre reinforced plastic for certain areas of the body; this was the first instance when this technique was used. 

A second manufacturing facility opened in Pilsting in 1973, and a third opened in Kumasi, Ghana in December 1974 to support increasing orders.

Several more plants were added in the 1980s, including two in the United States. The United States plants were later spun off into a separate, and now defunct, independent company (Neoplan USA) that used the Neoplan name under licence. Chinese production started in 1986, originally producing North brand Neoplan buses via companies under the Norinco umbrella: this was spun off into a separate joint venture with Youngman.

===1990s-2000s===
Further manufacturing facilities were opened during the 1990s and 2000s.

The Starliner was introduced in 1996, and would go on to win the &quot;Bus of the Year&quot; award for two consecutive years – in 1998 and 1999.

In 1999 the company unveiled a prototype fuel cell bus.

In 2001, Neoplan, or correctly, &quot;Gottlob Auwärter GmbH &amp; Co KG&quot; was acquired by MAN AG subsidiary MAN Nutzfahrzeuge AG to form Neoman Bus GmbH. The Starliner won the &quot;Bus of the Year&quot; award for two more consecutive years in 2001 and 2002.

In 2008, the Gottlob Auwärter Museum was opened in Stuttgart, opposite the headquarters of Stuttgarter Straßenbahnen AG.

On 1 February 2008, Neoman Bus GmbH was fully integrated into the bus division of the larger MAN Nutzfahrzeuge Group, and ceased to exist in its own right. Neoplan and MAN Truck &amp; Bus began operating as two separate but integrated marques of MAN Nutzfahrzeuge Group.

<doc id="357427" wikidata="Q1350181" url="?curid=357427" title="Shires of Scotland">
<text>The Shires of Scotland (; ), or Counties of Scotland, were historic subdivisions of Scotland.

The shires were originally established in the Middle Ages for judicial purposes, being territories over which a sheriff had jurisdiction. They were distinct from the various older mormaerdoms, earldoms and other territories into which Scotland was also divided, which are collectively termed the provinces of Scotland by modern historians. The provinces gradually lost their functions, whereas the shires gradually gained functions. From the 16th century, the shires served as constituencies, electing shire commissioners to the Parliament of Scotland. From 1667 each shire had commissioners of supply responsible for collecting local taxes; the commissioners of supply were subsequently given various local government functions as well. From 1797, the shires also served as areas for organising the militia, which was the responsibility of a lord-lieutenant.

Following the union of Scotland and England under the Acts of Union 1707, the term &#x27;county&#x27; came to be used interchangeably with the older term &#x27;shire&#x27;. From 1748 onwards sheriffs ceased to be automatically appointed to a single shire, with progressively larger sheriffdoms created instead, grouping multiple shires under a single sheriff.

Elected county councils were created in 1890 under the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1889, taking most of the functions of the commissioners of supply. The county councils were abolished in 1975, when local government was reorganised. Following another reorganisation in 1996, Scotland is now divided into 32 council areas. Some of the council areas share names with the historic counties, but in most such cases they have notable differences in their boundaries. The historic counties are still used for certain limited functions, serving as registration counties. There are also lieutenancy areas which are based on the historic counties, but with some notable differences.

==History==
===Shires===

The early Kingdom of Alba was subdivided into smaller territories under the control of various ranks of noble, including mormaers, earls, and thanes. As Alba expanded and evolved into the Kingdom of Scotland, it took in various other territories as it grew. There was no single collective term for these territories at the time, but modern historians now use the term provinces, or provincial lordships for the smaller ones.

Malcolm III (reigned 1058 to 1093) appears to have introduced sheriffs as part of a policy of imitating the administrative structures then being used in England by its Norman rulers. The provinces formed part of the feudal hierarchy of land ownership, but justice was administered by sheriffs, appointed to separately defined shires. More shires were created by Edgar (reigned 1097 to 1107), Alexander I (reigned 1107 to 1124), and in particular David I (reigned 1124 to 1153). David completed the division of the country (as it then was) into shires by the conversion of existing thanedoms.

The shires occasionally covered the same area as a province; for example, the shire of Forfar covered the same area as the province of Angus. More often though, the shires were groupings or subdivisions of the provinces. For example, the province of Lothian was covered by the three shires of Linlithgow, Edinburgh and Haddington. Conversely, the shire of Ayr covered the three provinces of Carrick, Cunninghame and Kyle. Shires were sometimes created which did not endure. For example, there was a Sheriff of Dingwall in the mid-13th century, and in 1293 shires of Lorn and Kintyre were created, which were later merged into the shire of Argyll.

===Shires extant by 1305===
In 1305 Edward I of England, who had deposed John Balliol, issued an ordinance for the government of Scotland. The document listed the twenty-three shires then existing and either appointed new sheriffs or continued heritable sheriffs in office.
===Shires formed after 1305===
The remaining shires were formed either by the territorial expansion of the Kingdom of Scotland, or by the subdivision of existing sheriffdoms. There were occasional changes to the shires; those of the Lowlands were relatively stable from the 14th century, but there were more pronounced changes to the shires of the Highlands and Islands into the 17th century, as the Scottish crown sought to consolidate its authority over the whole kingdom.

*: Argyll (or Argyle): lordship subdued by Alexander II in 1222. Norwegian claims over the area finally ended in 1266. First record of appointment of sheriff dates from 1326.
*1369: Kirkcudbright: formed when area between Rivers Nith and Cree granted to Archibald the Grim. Archibald appointed a steward to administer the area, hence it became a &quot;stewartry&quot;.
*: Bute: the islands formed part of Kintyre district of Argyll. A heritable sheriff was appointed to the shire in 1388.
*1402: Renfrew: separated from the Shire of Lanark by Robert III.
* Tarbertshire: existed from before 1481, when it gained territory from Perthshire, until 1633, when it was annexed to Argyll.
*Orkney and Shetland were absorbed into the Kingdom of Scotland in 1472. They initially kept their own legal systems which had operated when they were under Norwegian rule, with Orkney being an earldom and Shetland a lordship. They were placed under a single Sheriff of Orkney and Shetland in 1541, and the general laws of Scotland were applied in 1612.
*Ross eventually became a fully-fledged shire in 1661, after a couple of earlier abortive attempts. It was briefly a shire between 1504 and 1509, formed from part of Inverness-shire by an act of parliament during the reign of James IV, the sheriff to sit at Tain or Dingwall. Ross was restored to Inverness-shire in 1509. Another act in 1649 re-stated Ross&#x27;s separation from Inverness-shire, but was only implemented for the purposes of appointing commissioners (as members of the Parliament of Scotland were called). A subsequent act in 1661 finally separated Ross from Inverness-shire for all other purposes. Sir George Mackenzie&#x27;s Ross-shire estates were transferred to Cromartyshire by a 1685 act of parliament (repealed 1686, re-enacted 1690). 
*1633: Sutherland: separated from Inverness.
*Caithness, like Ross, was briefly removed from Inverness-shire to be its own shire between 1504 and 1509. The area of the shire was that of the Diocese of Caithness and the sheriff was to sit at Dornoch or Wick. Caithness was restored to being a shire in 1641, but covering just the smaller area of the earldom of Caithness; other parts of the diocese had since been included in the shire of Sutherland created in 1633.

===Commissioners of Supply===
From the 17th century the shires started to be used for local administration apart from judicial functions. In 1667 Commissioners of Supply were appointed in each shire to collect the land tax. There were 33 shires at that time, which were each given their own commissioners of supply, with the exception of the sheriffdom of Orkney and Shetland, where separate bodies of commissioners were created for each group of islands.

Orkney and Shetland having one sheriff but two sets of commissioners of supply led to ambiguity about their status. At a court case in 1829, the Court of Session was asked to rule on whether Shetland and Orkney formed one shire or two. The court declined to give such a ruling in abstract terms, as the answer depended on the context; they were one shire for the purposes of the administration of justice, lieutenancy, and parliamentary constituencies, but formed two shires for local government functions.

The commissioners were gradually given other local government functions. The commissioners did not exercise powers over any royal burghs within their areas, which were self-governing.

===1707 Act of Union and the ending of heritable jurisdictions===

In 1707, the Act of Union united Scotland with England. England also had shires, which had been mostly created in Anglo-Saxon times, and had gradually also come to be known as counties. The word &#x27;county&#x27; means an area controlled by a noble called a count in Norman French, or earl in English. Following the Norman conquest, England&#x27;s earldoms (which, like Scotland&#x27;s provinces, had previously covered substantially different territories to the shires) were reorganised to generally correspond to individual shires, which therefore also became known as counties.

Unlike in England, Scotland&#x27;s shires remained quite distinct territories from its earldoms and other provinces in 1707. Whereas English earls by that time had little or no role in local administration, Scottish earls and other nobles continued to exercise significant authority in their provinces, having powers of regality to hold courts which operated in parallel with those of the sheriffs. Despite the shires of Scotland not being controlled by a count or earl as their English counterparts had once been, following the union of 1707, the term &#x27;county&#x27; also came to be used for Scottish shires.

The office of sheriff or steward had become hereditary in certain families in the majority of sheriffdoms. At the accession of George II in 1727, twenty-two sheriffs were hereditary, three were appointed for life and only eight held office at the pleasure of the monarch.

Following the unsuccessful Jacobite Rising of 1745 the government took the opportunity of overhauling county government. In 1748, under the Heritable Jurisdictions (Scotland) Act 1746, hereditary sheriffs were abolished, with the right to appoint all sheriffs returning to the crown. The same act also abolished other hereditary jurisdictions including regality, justiciary and others; these had formed the basis for the authority of the earls and other nobles in their provinces. Those office holders who were displaced were compensated. The reforms of 1748 therefore saw the effective end of any meaningful function for the provinces, with the shires or counties thereafter being the main administrative divisions of Scotland.

Also in 1748, under the Sheriffs (Scotland) Act 1747, the office of sheriff principal was reduced to a largely ceremonial one, with a sheriff depute or sheriff substitute appointed to each &#x27;county, shire or stewartry&#x27;. Twelve of the smallest counties were paired to form sheriffdoms, a process of amalgamation that was to continue until the twentieth century, and thus led to the sheriffdoms and the shires having different boundaries. Where multiple shires were grouped into a single sheriffdom after 1748, the grouped shires were nevertheless still considered separate shires, retaining separate commissioners of supply.

In 1794 Lord-Lieutenants were appointed to each county, and in 1797 county militia regiments were raised, bringing Scotland into line with England, Wales and Ireland.

In 1858 police forces were established in each shire under the Police (Scotland) Act 1857. The counties lost their role as constituencies under the Representation of the People (Scotland) Act 1868, generally being divided into smaller constituencies. The group of constituencies within each county was termed the &#x27;parliamentary county&#x27;.

===County councils===

Elected county councils were introduced in 1890 under the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1889, taking most of the functions of the commissioners of supply, which were eventually abolished in 1930. The 1889 Act also merged Ross-shire and Cromartyshire into a single county called Ross and Cromarty, and resolved the ambiguity regarding Orkney and Shetland by declaring them to be two separate counties (using the then-prevalent spelling of &#x27;Zetland&#x27; for Shetland), after which there were 33 counties.

The act also triggered a review of parish and county boundaries to eliminate exclaves and cases where parishes straddled county boundaries. Most of the resulting boundary changes took effect in 1891. The amended boundaries were not just used for the local government functions of the county councils, but were also applied for all other administrative functions, including justice, militia, school boards and other functions, with just three exceptions. Firstly, the boundary changes did not affect any parliamentary constituencies, which remained as they were when last reviewed under the Redistribution of Seats Act 1885. This led to some divergence between the counties and the parliamentary counties, which was resolved when constituencies were next reviewed in 1918. Secondly, valuation rolls continued to have effect over the area for which they had been originally compiled. Thirdly, any ecclesiastical rights or jurisdictions were unaffected by the changes to boundaries (a provision more relevant to the parish changes than the county ones).

Burghs were towns with certain rights of self-government. Prior to the introduction of county councils in 1890, there were two main types: royal burghs and police burghs. Some burghs were additionally classed as parliamentary burghs, excluding them from the constituency of the wider county. Royal burghs were independent from the county&#x27;s commissioners of supply, but police burghs were not. Both types of burgh were subject to the authority of the sheriff court of the county, with the exception of the burgh of Edinburgh, which from 1482 had appointed its own sheriff. Edinburgh was thereafter sometimes described as the &quot;city and county of the city of Edinburgh&quot; to distinguish it from the surrounding &quot;county of Edinburgh&quot; (Midlothian).

When county councils were created in 1890, the 26 largest burghs were allowed to retain their independence, but smaller burghs were placed under the authority of the county councils. Following the example of Edinburgh, three of the burghs outside county council control were subsequently also made independent from their host county for other functions too, with the provost of such burghs acting as lieutenant, being Glasgow in 1893, Dundee in 1894, and Aberdeen in 1899.

Aberdeen, Dundee, Edinburgh and Glasgow were then each known as a county of a city. The boundaries of the counties of cities were periodically expanded as their urban areas grew. With the exception of the four counties of cities, the other burghs which had been excluded from county council control in 1890 were all placed under the authority of the county councils in 1930.

Under the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1929, the county councils of the two least populous counties, Kinross-shire and Nairnshire, were each paired with a larger neighbour; Nairnshire with Moray, and Kinross-shire with Perthshire. The county councils of these four counties continued to be elected separately, but most functions were provided through them acting as the &quot;joint county councils&quot; of Perth &amp; Kinross and Moray &amp; Nairn.

===Reforms and loss of functions===
In 1963 the Government published a white paper which proposed a reduction in the number of counties from thirty-four to between ten and fifteen. A process of consultation between county councils and officials from the Scottish Office was begun to effect the amalgamations. Following a change of government, it was announced in 1965 that a &quot;more comprehensive and authoritative&quot; review of local government areas would be undertaken.

In 1966 a Royal Commission on Local Government in Scotland, chaired by Lord Wheatley, was appointed. The commission&#x27;s report in 1969 recommended the replacement of the counties with larger regions.

In 1970 another change in government control was followed by the publication of a white paper in 1971 implementing the commission&#x27;s reforms in a modified form. The abolition of counties &quot;for local government purposes&quot; was enacted by the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973, with counties playing no part in local government after 16 May 1975, being replaced by regions and districts. The counties had already lost almost all their non-local government functions by this time; justice was administered by larger sheriffdoms and counties no longer served as constituencies. As part of the 1975 reforms, lord-lieutenants ceased to be appointed to counties, instead being appointed to new lieutenancy areas based on groups of the new districts. The lieutenancy areas loosely corresponded to the pre-1975 counties, but with some notable differences. The administrative functions left operating on a county basis after 1975 were very few, principally relating to land registration, in which capacity they are known as registration counties.

Local government was reorganised again in 1996 under the Local Government etc. (Scotland) Act 1994, with the regions and districts being replaced by 32 single-tier council areas. Some of the council areas have the same names as historic counties, but may cover significantly different areas. For example, the Aberdeenshire council area is much larger than the historic county of Aberdeenshire, also including most of the historic county of Kincardineshire and part of Banffshire, whereas the Renfrewshire council area is much smaller than historic Renfrewshire, only covering the central part of the historic county. Conversely, Fife retained the same boundaries at both the 1975 and 1996 reforms.

The historic counties of Scotland are included in the Index of Place Names (IPN) published by the Office for National Statistics. Each &quot;place&quot; included in the IPN is related to the historic county it lies within, as well as to a set of administrative areas.

==Names==
None of the counties&#x27; legal names included the suffix &#x27;shire&#x27;. Those counties named after towns therefore had the same name as the town, but were routinely referred to in legal contexts as the &#x27;shire of X&#x27; or &#x27;county of X&#x27; in order to distinguish the county from the town. However, in general usage, many of the counties had &#x27;shire&#x27; appended to their names, particularly those named after towns.

The first detailed county maps of Scotland were produced in the late 17th century. John Adair&#x27;s maps of c. 1682 included the names of &quot;Midlothian&quot;, &quot;East Lothian&quot;, &quot;Twaddall&quot; and &quot;Wast Lothian&quot; (the latter also as &quot;Linlithgowshire&quot;). The county maps of Herman Moll (c. 1745) preferred to keep the &quot;Shire&quot; suffix a separate word, as for example &quot;Berwick Shire&quot;, &quot;Roxburgh Shire&quot;, &quot;the Shire of Selkirk otherwise known as Etterick Forest&quot;, and in the north to &quot;Murray&quot; (Moray), &quot;Inverness Shire&quot;, &quot;Aberdeen Shire&quot;, &quot;Banff Shire&quot;, &quot;Ross Shire&quot;. The map of Boswell&#x27;s and Johnson&#x27;s A Journey to the Western Islands of Scotland (1773) gives &quot;Shire&quot; to every one shown, including &quot;Angus Shire&quot; and &quot;Fife Shire&quot;.

The Ordnance Survey&#x27;s official maps produced from the 19th century onwards adopted the practice of adding &#x27;shire&#x27; to the end of the name of each shire named after a town, and also used the names Argyllshire, Buteshire, Ross-shire (prior to its merger with Cromartyshire in 1889) and Morayshire, despite those four not being named after towns.

Some counties had alternative names by which they were sometimes known. In five cases the legal name was changed during the 20th century:
*Edinburghshire became Midlothian in 1913.
*Elginshire became Moray in 1919.
*Haddingtonshire became East Lothian in 1921.
*Linlithgowshire became West Lothian in 1925.
*Forfarshire became Angus in 1928.

Other alternative names sometimes used informally included &#x27;The Mearns&#x27; for Kincardineshire, &#x27;Tweeddale&#x27; for Peeblesshire, &#x27;Ettrick Forest&#x27; for Selkirkshire, and &#x27;Teviotdale&#x27; for Roxburghshire.

Until the 1930s, the General Post Office advised against included county names in addresses, recommending they only be used in those cases where it was necessary to distinguish between post towns with the same name.

The Post Office changed its policy in the 1930s, requiring the name of the county in which the post town lay to be included in most cases, with the exception of certain post towns which were large and well-known places, or which gave their names to their counties. Like the Ordnance Survey, the Post Office appended &#x27;shire&#x27; to the legal name for all counties named after towns. For counties not named after towns, the Post Office used the form Morayshire, and used Ross-shire for the mainland part of Ross and Cromarty. Otherwise, it omitted the &#x27;shire&#x27; suffix. The Post Office also used the spelling &#x27;Shetland&#x27; rather than the legal spelling of &#x27;Zetland&#x27;.

The county council of Dunbartonshire considered a motion to change that county&#x27;s name to &#x27;Lennox&#x27; in 1956. Supporters of the idea argued that as well as bringing back into use the name of the old province which had covered the area, it would eliminate the long-standing confusion caused by the county using the spelling &#x27;Dunbarton&#x27; and the town the spelling &#x27;Dumbarton&#x27;. The change was not pursued.

<doc id="357429" wikidata="Q461231" url="?curid=357429" title="Subdivisions of Scotland">
<text>For local government purposes, Scotland is divided into 32 areas designated as &quot;council areas&quot; (), which are all governed by single-tier authorities designated as &quot;councils&quot;. They have the option under the Local Government (Gaelic Names) (Scotland) Act 1997 of being known (but not re-designated) as a &quot;comhairle&quot; when opting for a Gaelic name; only &quot;Comhairle nan Eilean Siar&quot; (Council of the Western Isles) has chosen this option, whereas the Highland Council (&quot;Comhairle na Gàidhealtachd&quot;) has adopted its Gaelic form alongside its English equivalent, informally.

The council areas have been in existence since 1 April 1996, under the provisions of the Local Government etc. (Scotland) Act 1994. Historically, Scotland was divided into 34 counties or shires. Although these no longer have any administrative function, they are still used to some extent in Scotland for cultural and geographical purposes, and some of the current council areas are named after them. There are also a number of other administrative divisions, some of which are handled by joint boards of the councils.

At the most local level, Scotland is divided into civil parishes, which are now used only for statistical purposes such as the census. The lowest level of administrative subdivision are the communities, which may elect &quot;community councils&quot;.

==History of the subdivisions of Scotland==
Traditionally burghs have been the key unit of the local government of Scotland, being highly autonomous entities, with rights to representation in the old Parliament of Scotland. Even after the Acts of Union 1707, burghs continued to be the principal subdivision. Until 1889, administration was on a burgh and parish basis.

The years following 1889 saw the introduction of a hierarchy of local government administration comprising counties, counties of cities, large burghs and small burghs.

With effect from 16 May 1975 and until 31 March 1996 the local government divisions of Scotland consisted of an upper tier of &quot;regions&quot; each containing a lower tier of &quot;districts&quot; except for the single-tier &quot;island council areas&quot;. Since 1996 there has only been a single tier of government, and the former island council areas are of equal status to the other councils.

==Council areas==


==Other subdivisions==
Scotland has several other administrative divisions, some of which are handled by joint boards of the councils.

===Electoral and valuation===
There are several joint boards for electoral registration and the purposes of property valuation for assessing council tax and rates.

===Health===
See also &quot;NHS Scotland&quot;
Until 1 April 2014 the towns of Cambuslang and Rutherglen were in the Greater Glasgow and Clyde health board area despite being located in South Lanarkshire. They are now part of NHS Lanarkshire.

===Transport===

The Scottish Government has created seven &quot;Regional Transport Partnerships&quot;, for establishing transport policy in the regions. They broadly follow council area groupings.

===Eurostat NUTS===
In the Eurostat Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics (NUTS), Scotland is a level-1 NUTS region, coded &quot;UKM&quot;, which is subdivided as follows:

===Land registration===
The current land registration system in Scotland divides Scotland into 33 Registration Counties, each coming into effect on various dates between 1981 and 2003. These areas in most cases resemble those of the pre-1975 administrative counties with Glasgow being the only current city to form a registration county.

===Sheriffdoms===
Sheriffdoms are judicial areas. Since 1 January 1975, these have been six in number:

*Glasgow and Strathkelvin
*Grampian, Highland and Islands
*Lothian and Borders
*North Strathclyde
*South Strathclyde, Dumfries and Galloway
*Tayside, Central and Fife

===Lieutenancy areas===
The Lieutenancy areas of Scotland are the areas used for the ceremonial lord-lieutenants, the monarch&#x27;s representatives. The areas are similar to the Historic Counties and the Registration Counties, but are not identical to either. Most notably, the four cities of Aberdeen, Dundee, Edinburgh, and Glasgow form separate areas from the surrounding countryside, with the Lord Provost of each city acting &quot;ex officio&quot; as the lord-lieutenant.

=== Former police and fire services ===
The Police and Fire Reform (Scotland) Act 2012 resulted in the merger of local police and fire services on 1 April 2013 to form the Police Service of Scotland (Scottish Gaelic: ) and the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service (SFRS, Scottish Gaelic: ).

Prior to 1975 policing was the responsibility of the Cities and Burghs of Scotland (see List of burghs in Scotland). Between 1975 and 2013 Scotland was subdivided into Police and fire service areas based on the regions and districts and island council areas that were also formed in 1975. The police and fire service regions used between 1975 and 2013 are listed below.

==Lower level subdivisions==

Scotland is divided into 871 civil parishes which often resemble same-named but legally different ecclesiastical parishes. Although they have had no administrative function since 1930, they still exist and are still used for statistical purposes such as the census. Many former civil parish areas also continued to form registration districts until 1 January 2007. Many boundary changes have occurred over the years and an area currently derived from an old parish might no longer contain a place previously within that parish. Similarly, county boundaries (as still used for land registration) have also changed over the years such that a parish mentioned historically (generally before the 1860s) as being in one county (or sometimes two due to straddling a border) might now be in a neighbouring county and consequentially in a different succeeding council area.

For most administrative purposes, the base level of sub-division in Scotland is now that of communities, which may elect &quot;community councils&quot;. The main role of these bodies is to channel and reflect local opinion to other bodies; they otherwise have very limited powers. There are around 1,200 communities in Scotland. Not all communities have councils; some have joint councils.

Scottish communities are the nearest equivalent to civil parishes in England.
