<text>The Northeast Regional is an intercity rail service operated by Amtrak in the Northeastern and Mid-Atlantic United States. In the past it has been known as the &quot;NortheastDirect&quot;, &quot;Acela Regional&quot;, or &quot;Regional&quot;. It is Amtrak&#x27;s busiest route, carrying 9,163,082 passengers in fiscal year (FY) 2023. The &quot;Northeast Regional&quot; service received more than $787.7 million in gross ticket revenue in FY 2023.

The &quot;Northeast Regional&quot; offers daily all-reserved service, usually at least every hour. Trains generally run along the Northeast Corridor between Boston in the north to Washington, D.C., in the south with multiple stops, including in New York City, Philadelphia, and Baltimore. Extensions and branches provide service to Newport News, Norfolk, and Roanoke, Virginia, and Springfield, Massachusetts, with intermediate stops.

Trains cover the most popular stretch between New York Penn Station and Washington Union Station in about 3.5 hours. The section between New York and Philadelphia takes 1.5 hours, while the part between Philadelphia and Washington takes two hours. North of New York, the travel time to Boston is four hours, while trips to Springfield take 3.5 hours. South of Washington, trains take 4.5 hours to reach Newport News, 4.5 hours to reach Norfolk, or five hours to reach Roanoke.
==History==

The services along the line, as inherited from Penn Central, once had their own names, such as the &quot;&quot;Yankee Clipper&quot; and the &quot;Federal&quot;&quot;; typically a name applied to at most one train and its &quot;twin&quot; in the opposite direction. Electrification ended at New Haven, Connecticut, requiring an engine change. On October 28, 1995, Amtrak introduced the &quot;NortheastDirect&quot; brand for all trains on the Northeast Corridor (and its extension to Newport News, Virginia) except for the express and hourly services. The November 10, 1996, timetable restored the old names in addition to the &quot;NortheastDirect&quot; brand. The names (except the ) were dropped with the May 16, 1999, schedule. 

In 2000, Amtrak completed electrifying the route from New Haven to Boston in preparation for the introduction of the &quot;Acela Express&quot;, thereby eliminating the engine change at New Haven. The first two all-electric round-trips to and from Boston were branded &quot;Acela Regional&quot; and equipped with refurbished Amfleet cars painted in the Acela-like &quot;Phase V&quot; livery. All-electric service began on January 31, 2000. The &quot;NortheastDirect&quot; branding continued to be used for trains which changed from electric to diesel traction in New Haven.

Due to customer confusion with the &quot;Acela Express&quot;, the name was changed again on March 17, 2003, to simply &quot;&quot;Regional&quot;.&quot; As part of rebranding and service improvements, the name was changed to &quot;Northeast Regional&quot; on June 23, 2008 (though it also appeared on schedules several months beforehand).

On May 12, 2015, &quot;Northeast Regional&quot; Train 188, traveling from Washington, D.C., to New York City, derailed in the Port Richmond neighborhood of Philadelphia, killing eight people and injuring more than 200 people. The train derailed along a curve and was determined to have been traveling at a speed of about 100 mph, exceeding the limit of 50 mph on that curve. This speed limit was not posted; engineers on that route are expected to rely on memory to control the speed of the train. Additionally, the train was suspected to have been hit by a projectile, as was a commuter train in the area shortly before the derailment.

Private sleeping rooms on overnight trains 65/66/67, last available in 2004 on the &quot;Federal&quot;, were made available effective April 5, 2021. The overnight trains were temporarily cancelled in January 2022; they resumed in July 2022 without sleepers. They were temporarily cancelled north of New York City effective April 4, 2023, due to Penn Station Access construction.

===Virginia service===
Some &quot;Northeast Regional&quot; trains continue into Virginia, serving three branches to Norfolk, Newport News, and Roanoke, serving points in between. These tracks are not electrified and are partially owned by both freight railroads and the State of Virginia.

Virginia and Amtrak partnered in 2009 under the brand Amtrak Virginia to expand passenger rail service within the Commonwealth, making Virginia the 15th state to fund state services in addition to federally funded routes.

One daily &quot;Northeast Regional&quot; round trip was extended to from Washington to Lynchburg via Manassas and Charlottesville on October 1, 2009, supplementing the existing &quot;Crescent&quot; service. Service was extended from Lynchburg to Roanoke starting October 31, 2017. A second daily Roanoke round trip was added on July 11, 2022. An extension from Roanoke to Christiansburg, Virginia, near Virginia Tech, is in planning, as is an infill station in Bedford, Virginia.

On July 20, 2010, Amtrak added an additional &quot;Northeast Regional&quot; frequency from Washington to Richmond Staples Mill Road station, increasing the Washington-Richmond corridor to eight daily round trips with hourly northbound morning service. One round trip was extended from Richmond to Norfolk starting December 12, 2012. A second daily Norfolk round trip on weekdays was added on March 4, 2019. One round trip was extended from Staples Mill to Main Street in September 2021. Service changes on July 11, 2022, added an additional Norfolk weekday round trip (making three round trips on weekdays and two on weekends).

===Proposed expansion===

In spring 2021, Amtrak proposed extending three &quot;Northeast Regional&quot; round trips from New York Penn Station to Ronkonkoma station along the Main Line of the Long Island Rail Road, with stops at , , , and . The move would enable one-seat rides between Long Island and points south on the Northeast Corridor, provide express train service within Long Island, and connect JFK International Airport to the Amtrak network. In December 2023, the Federal Railroad Administration accepted the project into its Corridor Identification and Development Program, granting $500,000 toward service planning and prioritizing the route for future federal funding. 

In January 2025, Suffolk County Executive Edward Romaine, along with Amtrak officials, officially announced the proposed extension. It was reported that work was expected to begin in 2026, and that Amtrak service was anticipated to commence in 2028, at the earliest. Trains would operate using diesel on Long Island. Required infrastructure upgrades for the service would likely include an additional platform and track at Ronkonkoma. Romaine said that Amtrak wanted the extension, in part, due to Ronkonkoma&#x27;s location next to Long Island MacArthur Airport.

==Operation==
===Equipment===

, most &quot;Northeast Regional&quot; trains consist of 7 to 9 passenger cars hauled by a locomotive.

The passenger cars are the Amfleet I series passenger cars built by the Budd Company in the mid-to-late 1970s. Most trains include a Business Class car, a Café car (food service/lounge), and up to seven Coach Class cars, one of which is designated the Quiet Car, where passengers are asked to refrain from loud talking and mobile phone conversations.

Between Boston and Washington, the service has overhead electric wires and is pulled by Siemens ACS-64 electric locomotives at speeds up to . &quot;Northeast Regional&quot; trains operating south of Washington, D.C., into Virginia, and on the New Haven–Springfield Line use GE Genesis diesel locomotives which have a slightly lower top speed of .

In the coming years all equipment will be replaced with Amtrak Airo trainsets, the railroad&#x27;s branding of its combination of Siemens Venture passenger cars and a Siemens Charger diesel-electric locomotive. The trainsets for the Northeast Corridor will have eight passenger cars, which will include a food service area and a mix of 2×2 Coach Class and 2×1 Business Class seating. The car closest to the locomotive will be a specialized &quot;Auxiliary Power Vehicle&quot; which will include a pantograph to collect power from overhead lines and will feed it to four traction motors in the car, and via a DC link cable, to the four traction motors in the locomotive. Outside of electrified territory, the locomotive&#x27;s diesel engine will generate power for the traction motors. The arrangement will offer a near-seamless transition between power sources on through trains to Virginia and Springfield, Massachusetts, a process that currently requires a time-consuming locomotive change.

===Classes of service===
All classes of service include complimentary WiFi, an electric outlet (120 V, 60 Hz AC) at each seat, reading lamps, and fold-out tray tables. Reservations are required on all trains; tickets may be purchased online, over the phone, from a station agent, or via ticketing machine.
*Coach Class: 2×2 seating. Passengers self-select seats on a first-come, first-served basis.
*Business Class: 2×2 or 2×1 seating with more legroom than coach. Passengers receive a complimentary soft drink. Seats are assigned in advance.

===Route===

Most &quot;Northeast Regional&quot; trains operate over the Northeast Corridor between Boston and Washington (via New York, Philadelphia, and Baltimore). The corridor is owned, in part, by Amtrak, the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA), Metro-North Railroad (MNRR), and the Connecticut Department of Transportation (CDOT).
*MBTA Attleboro Line: Boston to MA/RI state line (dispatched and maintained by Amtrak)
*Amtrak Northeast Corridor: MA/RI state line to New Haven, Connecticut
*CDOT New Haven Line: New Haven to CT/NY state line (dispatched and maintained by MNRR)
*MNRR New Haven Line: CT/NY state line to New Rochelle, New York
*Amtrak Northeast Corridor: New Rochelle to Washington, D.C.

Some trips diverge at New Haven and turn north to serve Springfield, Massachusetts, operating over Amtrak&#x27;s New Haven–Springfield Line. Additional service on that line is provided by Amtrak&#x27;s &quot;Hartford Line&quot; trains, which have timed transfers to and from many &quot;Northeast Regional&quot; trips.

Several trips continue south of Washington D.C. to Virginia, running to either Roanoke, Richmond, Newport News, or Norfolk. All Virginia services use the northernmost portion of the ex-Richmond, Fredericksburg and Potomac Railroad (now owned by CSX Transportation) between Washington and Alexandria, Virginia. South of Alexandria, trains to Roanoke use the Norfolk Southern Railway (ex-Southern Railway, ex-Virginia Midland Railway). Trains to Richmond, Norfolk and Newport News use the CSX RF&amp;P, Richmond Terminal, and Bellwood subdivisions between Alexandria and Richmond.

South of Richmond, trains to Newport News use the CSX Peninsula Subdivision (ex-Chesapeake and Ohio Railway). Trains to Norfolk use the CSX North End Subdivision and Norfolk Southern&#x27;s Norfolk District (ex-Norfolk and Western Railway).

===Funding===
Amtrak receives federal funding for its operations between Boston and Washington, D.C. &quot;Northeast Regional&quot; operations south of Washington are funded in part by the Commonwealth of Virginia. Operations along the New Haven–Springfield Line are funded by the State of Connecticut and the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.

<doc id="360916" wikidata="Q4301" url="?curid=360916" title="Arusha">
<text>Arusha is a Tanzanian city, capital of Arusha Region. It is populated with over 617,631 people, 

Located below Mount Meru on the eastern edge of the eastern branch of the Great Rift Valley, Arusha region has a temperate climate. The region is close to the Serengeti National Park, the Ngorongoro Conservation Area, Lake Manyara National Park, Olduvai Gorge, Tarangire National Park, Mount Kilimanjaro, and Mount Meru in the Arusha National Park. 

The region is a major international diplomatic hub. It hosts the African Court of the African Union and is the capital of the East African Community. From 1994 to 2015, the region also hosted the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, but that entity has ceased operations. Currently, it hosts one of the branches of the United Nations International Residual Mechanism for Criminal Tribunals. 

Arusha is a multicultural region with a majority Tanzanian population of mixed backgrounds: indigenous African, Arab-Tanzanian and Indian-Tanzanian population, plus a small European and North American minority population. Religions of the Arusha region population include Christianity, Islam, Sikhism and Hinduism.

==History==
The current site of Arusha was first settled in the 1830s by the agro-pastoral Arusha Maasai from the Arusha Chini community, south of Mount Kilimanjaro. They traded grains, honey, beer, and tobacco with the pastoral Kisongo Maasai in exchange for livestock, milk, meat, and skins. Demand for Arusha&#x27;s foodstuffs increased substantially during the 1860s when the Pangani Valley trade route was extended through Old Moshi, Arusha, and ultimately to western Kenya. Although not yet a town, it was a regional centre with a number of urban features.

Arusha was conquered by the Germans in 1896 after the murder of the first two missionaries who attempted to settle on nearby Mount Meru. The Germans established a permanent presence in 1900 when a military fort (a &quot;boma&quot;) was built and soldiers were garrisoned there. &quot;The &quot;boma&quot; was a solid statement, meant to impress German moral and political order on the surrounding countryside. Set on a rise overlooking the plains, the fortress-like building dominated the surrounding landscape&quot; complete with a machine gun. 

Many Africans were forcibly displaced from their ancestral lands by the Germans and forced to dig lime or carry stones to construct the fort. The British took Arusha from the Germans in 1916 during World War I. German officials left the area, the British deported German missionaries and settlers, and only a skeletal military administration of the town remained. 

During the 1920s, civilian administration was implemented, missionaries from the United States arrived, British and Greek settlers reoccupied the former German farms, and the town grew, especially after the British moved the regional administration from New Moshi to Arusha. The extension of the railroad from Moshi to Arusha in 1928-29 greatly increased commerce. The Great Depression soon squelched commerce and Arusha in 1940 had fewer than 2,000 residents. Growth resumed during World War II and by 1948, the population had increased to more than 5,000. 

By the 1950s, Arusha was &quot;a polyglot, westernized little town; it has a Greek community, several Germans predating World War I, and some German Jewish refugees post-dating World War II.&quot; A state of emergency was declared in the Arusha region in 1953 in response to the Mau Mau Uprising. Journalist John Gunther noted at the time that &quot;a loyal tribe, the Waarusha, threatened to take violent countermeasures against the Kikuyus themselves, if the British did not. The authorities arrested the leading Mau Mau conspirators, screened thousands more, and deported other thousands back to Kenya.&quot;

In the 1960s, parts of the movie &quot;Hatari!&quot; with John Wayne were filmed at Momela Lakes and at Mount Meru.

Arusha has been a crucial city in the history of modern Tanzania. Official documents ceding independence to Tanganyika were signed by the United Kingdom at Arusha in 1961. The Arusha Declaration was signed in 1967 in Arusha. The Arusha Accords were signed at the city of Arusha on 4 August 1993, by representatives of competing factions in the Rwandan civil war.

The Arusha Peace and Reconciliation Agreement for Burundi was signed on 28 August 2000 as part of a process forging peace in that country through power sharing and establishing a transitional government. 

The January 2015 Arusha Agreement for South Sudan created a framework for the reunification of South Sudan&#x27;s ruling SPLM party, which had splintered into three creating a humanitarian crisis as fighting between factions intensified. It provided that all SPLM members who were dismissed be reinstated to their previous positions and a secret ballot system be adopted.

In 1994, the UN Security Council decided by its Resolution 955 of 8 November 1994 that Arusha should host the &quot;ad hoc&quot; International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda. The establishment of the tribunal with its foreign employees has influenced the local economy of the city increasing the cost of living for residents. The tribunal has downsized due to its closure in 2014, but its legal successor, the United Nations International Residual Mechanism for Criminal Tribunals established by United Nations Security Council Resolution 1966, will continue entertaining a branch in Arusha, opening on 1 July 2012. The tribunal indicted 93 individuals and sentenced 62.
The Tanzanian government intended to declare Arusha a city on 1 July 2006, but this was delayed due to pending municipality boundary adjustments. Arusha was granted city status on 15 August 2012, with it becoming official on 2 November 2012.

In 2013, a quarry located in Arusha collapsed and killed 14 miners after heavy rain.

== Intergovernmental organisations ==
Arusha is home to a number of notable intergovernmental organisations. The city of Arusha is the headquarters of the East African Community, hosts a branch of the International Residual Mechanism for Criminal Tribunals, and the African Court on Human and Peoples&#x27; Rights.

==Transport==
=== Airport ===
Arusha is served by two airports: the Kilimanjaro International Airport for international air travellers, some east, approximately halfway to Moshi. The airport provides international and domestic flights. Arusha Airport is a regional air hub in the west of the city, and serves more than 87,000 passengers yearly.

===Road links===
Travel by road can be done through privately run coaches (buses) to Nairobi, Dodoma, Babati, Morogoro, Tanga, Mbeya, Singida, Tabora, Mpanda, Kigoma, Mwanza, Bukoba, Iringa, and Dar es Salaam.

Arusha is on the Cape to Cairo Road. There was a marker in the 1930s in Arusha indicating the mid-point of the route. It is also on the Cairo-Cape Town Highway.

==Culture==

== History ==
Amtrak began the &quot;Three Rivers&quot; on September 10, 1995, as a replacement for the discontinued &quot;Broadway Limited&quot;. The train originally ran between New York and Pittsburgh, extending a New York–Harrisburg &quot;Keystone Service&quot; train. Using train numbers 46/47, it exchanged mail cars with the Chicago–Washington, D.C. &quot;Capitol Limited&quot; in Pittsburgh, while through passengers disembarked and changed trains.

Through service began on February 1, 1996, by coupling two &quot;Three Rivers&quot; Amfleet coaches to the Superliner consist of the &quot;Capitol Limited&quot;. Passage between the single-level and double-level cars was facilitated by a transition dorm car.

Amtrak ended the switching operation on November 10, 1996, in favor of extending the &quot;Three Rivers&quot; to Chicago as an independent train. In doing so, they restored the &quot;Broadway Limited&quot;&#x27;s numbers (40/41), albeit neither its full dining service nor its sleeping cars due to equipment shortages and an unfavorable schedule.

On April 1, 1999, Amtrak added a sleeping car to the &quot;Three Rivers&quot;, using four previously stored Heritage Fleet sleepers that they had restored for $250,000 since no Viewliners were available. The last standard 10-6 sleepers operated by Amtrak, they required a Federal Railroad Administration waiver to operate because of their direct-dump toilets. When the waiver expired in October 2001, Amtrak retired the Heritage sleepers and replaced them with Viewliners, which had since become available.

== Route ==
The Pittsburgh–New York &quot;Three Rivers&quot; stopped at Pittsburgh, Greensburg, Johnstown, Altoona, Huntingdon, Lewistown, Harrisburg, Lancaster, Paoli, Philadelphia, Trenton, Newark and New York. With the extension to Chicago in 1996, service began to Hammond–Whiting and Nappanee. Other stops in Ohio were added as station improvements were funded: Youngstown (May 16, 1997), Fostoria (December 15, 1997) and Akron (August 10, 1998). Latrobe was added as a flag stop on May 17, 1998.

Highlights along the route included Horseshoe Curve near Altoona, Pennsylvania, and the Allegheny Mountains. The New York–Chicago trip took about 20 hours.

Service over the former route of the &quot;Three Rivers&quot; east of Pittsburgh is now provided by the &quot;Pennsylvanian&quot;. While its route west of Pittsburgh to Hammond–Whiting is no longer served by passenger trains, the &quot;Floridian&quot; still connects Pittsburgh and Chicago, albeit on a different route via Cleveland.

== Equipment ==
The &quot;Three Rivers&quot; used Amfleet coaches and either Amfleet or Horizon dinettes in addition to the later Heritage sleeper. At the height of Amtrak&#x27;s experiment with mail and express business, a typical late 1990s &quot;Three Rivers&quot; had 4–6 passenger cars and upwards of 25 mail cars.

<text>The TenDRA Compiler is a C/C++ compiler for POSIX-compatible operating systems available under the terms of the BSD license.

It was originally developed by the Defence Evaluation and Research Agency (DERA) in the United Kingdom. In the beginning of 2002 TenDRA was actively developed again by Jeroen Ruigrok van der Werven and offered as a BSD-licensed open source project through the website tendra.org. In the third quarter of 2002 the one-man effort was expanded to a small team.

The TDF technology behind TenDRA has an academic history dating back to work on algebraic code validation in the 1970s.

In August 2003 TenDRA split into two projects, TenDRA.org and Ten15.org. Both projects seemed to have disappeared from the web around 2006–2007, but actually they are still active.

The goals of TenDRA.org are:
*to continuously produce correct code,
*to ensure code correctness through various means, and
*to continuously improve the performance of the compiler and resulting code, unless it would jeopardize the points above.

The goals of Ten15.org added:
*to be a friendly competitor to GCC in order to get a best-of-breed compiler.

Features of both compilers include good error reporting with respect to standards compliance and a smaller code size than the same programs compiled on gcc. C++ support never got as developed as C support, and there was no STL supporting release. TenDRA uses the Architecture Neutral Distribution Format (ANDF), a specification created by the Open Group, as its intermediate language.

At a point, most of the Alpha OSF/1 kernel could be built with TenDRA C and afterwards there was also a similar effort to port the FreeBSD kernel.

==Documentation==
TenDRA.org has a comprehensive set of documentation available online at http://www.tendra.org/docs

<doc id="360919" wikidata="Q698402" url="?curid=360919" title="Kawakami Gensai">
<text>was a Japanese samurai of the late Edo period. A highly skilled swordsman, he was one of the four most notable assassins of the Bakumatsu period. Gensai&#x27;s high-speed sword discipline allowed him to assassinate targets in broad daylight.

== Early life ==
He was born in Kumamoto, Higo Province, Japan in 1834 as the second son to , a retainer of the daimyō of the Kumamoto Domain and his wife . Because Genjiro&#x27;s older brother Hanzaemon was chosen as the family&#x27;s heir, at age 11 he was given in adoption to , another Kumamoto retainer and was renamed to Kawakami Gensai. 

He then entered the domain&#x27;s school, the Jishūkan (時習館), and followed its academic and martial courses of study. Given his later prowess, it is rather curious to note that during his martial training he apparently did not win many bouts. With regards to this he is said to have commented &quot;&quot;Kenjutsu&quot; (swordsmanship) with bamboo &quot;shinai&quot; is nothing more than play.&quot; At age 16 he was called to serve in the Kumamoto castle town as a menial in charge of cleaning (&quot;Osōji-bōzu&quot; お掃除坊主).

Although this was a low-level position, Gensai devoted himself wholeheartedly to it, using his free time to polish his martial and literary skills, as well as learn sadō (tea ceremony) and ikebana (flower arrangement). It was at this time that he met two men who were later important in the activities of the &quot;Ishin Shishi&quot;: Todoroki Buhē and Miyabe Teizō. Thanks to his discussions with them, he took a serious interest in the concept of &quot;kinnō&quot; (勤王), or imperial loyalty.

== Activity in the 1850s ==
In 1851, he joined the Kumamoto lord Hosokawa Narimori and went to Edo for his lord&#x27;s &quot;sankin-kōtai&quot; rotation. It was during his service to the lord in Edo that Commodore Perry arrived in 1853. As the shogunate subsequently entered into a series of increasingly unfair unequal treaties, Gensai left Edo in anger and returned to Kumamoto, where he entered the Gendōkan academy of the &quot;kinnō&quot; scholar Hayashi Ōen. After a thorough schooling in Ōen&#x27;s &quot;kinnō&quot; philosophy, Gensai returned to Edo.

== Activity in the 1860s ==
Gensai was present at the Kumamoto residence in Edo during the Ansei Purge. In the aftermath of Ii Naosuke&#x27;s assassination, when a group of the escaping assassins suddenly entered the residence, it was Gensai who calmed down the subsequent uproar, calling for a doctor and having a private tea ceremony for the men. It was during this ceremony that he told the men of his admiration for them.

In 1861, Gensai married Misawa Teiko, the daughter of another Kumamoto retainer. A martial artist herself, she was highly skilled in the use of the naginata. The couple had a son, Gentarō, who survived even after Gensai&#x27;s execution, thanks to Teiko&#x27;s efforts.
In 1862, he joined Kumamoto forces who were posted to security duty in Kyoto. After the political event of Higo-han, he left there and went to Chōshū-han, where he became a personal body guard of Sanjō Sanetomi. It was at this point, he quit his job as &quot;bōzu&quot;, and soon after, left Kumamoto service altogether. In 1864, he lost his mentor Miyabe Teizō to a Shinsengumi raid at Ikedaya.

Soon after, Gensai carried out his most famous and only confirmed assassination: that of Sakuma Shōzan. Together with at least three other assassins, they ambushed and attacked Shōzan in broad daylight on 12 August 1864, and ended with Gensai killing him in one stroke. Shortly after that incident, at the Tenryuji temple in Saga Tenryu-ji, Kyoto, Gensai told his confederates, &quot;It was the first time I actually felt I&#x27;d killed someone, the hair on my head stood on end because he is the greatest man of the time.&quot; While other assassinations have been attributed to him, only his murder of Shōzan can be proven.

After this, he withdrew to Chōshū and took part in the military actions of Takasugi Shinsaku&#x27;s Kiheitai against the shogunate&#x27;s Chōshū Expeditions. During the second Chōshū campaign by the Tokugawa regime, he participated for Chōshū and eventually won the battle. However, during action in Kokura, he decisively surrendered to Kumamoto forces, and was imprisoned until just after the Meiji Restoration.

== Later life and death ==

In the aftermath of the Meiji Restoration in 1868, Gensai was released from prison. He changed his name to , and served as a military official and sword teacher for the Kumamoto domain. Because of his harboring of some Kiheitai stragglers under his old comrade Oraku Gentarō, he was arrested in November 1870 and later transferred to a prison in Tokyo in 1871. He was later executed by decapitation in , Tokyo on 13 January 1872. He was buried at Ikegami Honmon-ji, Tokyo.

== Gensai in fiction ==
The fictional swordsman and wanderer, Himura Kenshin also known as &quot;Battosai&quot;, from the manga series &quot;Rurouni Kenshin&quot; was inspired by Gensai. The character is a repentant former assassin who has sworn never to kill 10 years after the Meiji Revolution.

The character Kawakami Bansai from the manga &quot;Gin Tama&quot; takes his name from Gensai.

<doc id="360920" wikidata="Q989490" url="?curid=360920" title="Empire Service">
<text>The Empire Service is an inter-city rail service operated by Amtrak within the state of New York in the United States. The brand name originated with the New York Central Railroad in 1967. Trains on the line provide frequent daily service along the Empire Corridor between New York City and Niagara Falls via Albany, the state capital.

During fiscal year 2018, the &quot;Empire Service&quot; carried 1,150,498 passengers on the line between New York City and Albany, while services between Albany and points west, including the and , carried an additional 366,696. Ticket revenue on the New York City–Albany section in FY2016 was $49,361,545, an increase of 1.4% from FY2015, while revenue on the Albany–Toronto route was $22,143,803.

== Services ==
Approximately hourly weekday service is available on the southern portion of the line between New York Penn Station and Albany–Rensselaer. As of the April 2024 timetable, the route operates nine round trips on most days – seven between New York City and Albany, and two between New York City and Niagara Falls.

The corridor is served by four additional Amtrak trains each day:

*The &quot;Maple Leaf,&quot; which runs along the entire corridor before continuing across Central and Western New York and on to Toronto
*The &quot;Lake Shore Limited&quot;, which follows the corridor through central and western New York as far as Buffalo–Depew en route to Chicago, with one section breaking off at Albany to serve Massachusetts en route to Boston.
*The &quot;Adirondack&quot; to Montreal and &quot;Ethan Allen Express&quot; to Burlington supplement service on the southern portion of the line between New York City and Albany. Both follow the corridor as far as Schenectady.

Downstate, in the Hudson Valley, the portion of the route from Poughkeepsie southward is shared with the Metro-North Railroad&#x27;s Hudson Line, and sees frequent commuter service, with connections to the &quot;Empire Service&quot; at Poughkeepsie, Croton-Harmon, and Yonkers.

The Empire Service is one of four New York-based train routes that Amtrak operates with funding from the New York State Department of Transportation with the other three routes being the &quot;Adirondack&quot;, &quot;Maple Leaf,&quot; and &quot;Ethan Allen Express.&quot;

== History ==
Today&#x27;s Empire Service is the descendant of numerous routes dating to 1869, when Cornelius Vanderbilt merged his Hudson River Railroad (forerunner of today&#x27;s Metro-North Hudson Line) with the New York Central Railroad (NYC), thus linking New York City with Albany.

Its route is largely coextensive with what was once the NYC&#x27;s main line, which was the eastern portion of the &quot;Water Level Route&quot; from New York City to Chicago. The Buffalo-Niagara Falls leg was formerly part of an NYC subsidiary, the Buffalo and Niagara Falls Railroad, but passenger service was dropped in 1961.

On December 3, 1967, just months before its merger with the Pennsylvania Railroad to become the Penn Central Transportation Company, the Central reorganized all its passenger routes. All trains along the New York City-Buffalo corridor were consolidated under the Empire Service brand. Marketing emphasized convenient service within the state, with a reduced emphasis on long-distance trains which continued west of Buffalo. This program continued after the Penn Central merger. The new scheduling produced mixed results; passengers were deterred by the poor quality of the passenger cars and the inconvenient locations of stations along the route.
Penn Central handed the Empire Service, along with most of its other routes, to Amtrak on May 1, 1971. Initially, Amtrak retained seven daily trains on the New York City–Albany–Buffalo corridor: four operated from New York City to Albany, and three ran through to Buffalo. All service west of Buffalo was discontinued. All trains retained their ex-Penn Central numbers and were otherwise nameless. Westward service resumed briefly after May with the introduction of the Chicago–New York City &quot;Lake Shore&quot;, but this train was canceled on January 6, 1972.

The &quot;Empire Service&quot; name was restored on June 11, 1972, and individual names were added to the trains along the corridor on May 19, 1974.

Despite doubts about Amtrak&#x27;s potential success, the company was key in reestablishing some discontinued services along the Empire Corridor. Service beyond Buffalo to Niagara Falls was reestablished with such trains as the &quot;Niagara Rainbow&quot; and the &quot;Maple Leaf&quot;. In addition Amtrak restored service to downtown Schenectady in 1978, a service which Penn Central had discontinued in 1968, for all &quot;Empire Service&quot; trains that continued beyond Albany. Service was restored permanently on the old Water Level Route with the reintroduction of the old New York Central train, the &quot;Lake Shore Limited,&quot; on October 31, 1975.

On April 7, 1991, all Amtrak &quot;Empire Service&quot; trains started using the new Empire Connection into New York Penn. Prior to that change, all passenger trains from Albany and beyond originated and terminated at Grand Central Terminal, forcing passengers traveling to the Northeast Corridor to transfer via shuttle bus, taxicab, or via the New York City Subway to reach Penn Station. The move also saved Amtrak the expense of operating two stations in New York City.

All service along the Empire Corridor was consolidated under the &quot;Empire&quot; brand on October 28, 1995. The names were restored just a year later, only to be dropped again in 1999.

In October 2011, CSX and Amtrak reached an agreement for Amtrak to lease the Hudson Subdivision between Poughkeepsie and Hoffmans, west of Schenectady. Since 2012, Amtrak has effectively had operational control over the Hudson Subdivision, handling all maintenance and capital responsibilities. CSX retained freight rights over the line, which hosts only five freights a day.

In the Capital District, Amtrak has used federal funds to double-track the line between Rensselaer and Schenectady (which once had four tracks under the New York Central), and add an additional station track at the Albany–Rensselaer station. Amtrak sees the lease as key to improving &quot;Empire Service&quot; speeds and frequencies. Amtrak officially assumed control on December 1, 2012, with trains in the section now dispatched by the Amtrak Control and Command Center in New York City.

From July 10 through September 1, 2017, six &quot;Empire Service&quot; trains (three round trips) used Grand Central Terminal as part of Amtrak&#x27;s work to make repairs at Penn Station. All trains using the Empire Connection, excluding the &quot;Lake Shore Limited&quot;, again operated into Grand Central Terminal from May 26 to September 4, 2018, to allow work on the Empire Tunnel, the Spuyten Duyvil movable bridge, and Track 19 in New York City&#x27;s Penn Station.
In May 2018, the Massachusetts Senate approved funds for a two-year pilot of the &quot;Berkshire Flyer&quot;, a seasonal extension of a weekend &quot;Empire Service&quot; round trip to Pittsfield. The service, modeled on the CapeFLYER, would extend one New York City–Albany train to Pittsfield on Friday afternoons, with a return trip on Sunday afternoons. The trial was scheduled to begin in June 2020, but was delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic and outstanding questions around the program&#x27;s legal sponsorship. After delays due to the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States, the pilot was rescheduled for summer 2022 and 2023, with the first trip on July 8, 2022.

Service along the southern portion was disrupted for several days in November 2023. Increased inspection and regulation that followed an April 2023 parking garage collapse resulted in the discovery of similar structural issues at another garage overlying the tracks in Manhattan. One round trip was resumed on March 4, 2024, restoring service to pre-COVID levels. Service was reduced to eight round trips on November 10, 2024, due to construction work in the East River Tunnels limiting capacity at Penn Station. One round trip was re-added from December 2, 2024, to April 28, 2025.

== Operation ==
=== Equipment ===

Most &quot;Empire Service&quot; trains consist of five or six cars hauled by a locomotive.

The passenger cars are the Amfleet I series passenger cars built by the Budd Company in the mid-to-late 1970s. Most trains include an Amfleet club car which has a combination of Business Class seating with a Café (food service/lounge) and four or five Coach Class cars.

Between New York City and Albany–Rensselaer, trains are pulled by a GE Genesis P32AC-DM dual-mode diesel locomotive at speeds up to . The locomotives operate on third rail electric power in Penn Station and the Empire Connection tunnel and on diesel power for the rest of the route. Between Albany–Rensselaer and Niagara Falls, traditional diesel-only GE Genesis locomotives are used.

The New York Central did not order new equipment for the &quot;Empire Service&quot;, preferring to rehabilitate existing equipment. 40 64-seat coaches, built by Pullman-Standard in 1946, were refurbished in 1967–1968. Another 21 coaches from the same pool were rebuilt as 50-seat &quot;coach-buffet&quot; cars. Amtrak acquired this equipment when it took over the Penn Central&#x27;s passenger trains in 1971. The cars remained on the &quot;Empire Service&quot; under Amtrak into the mid-1970s. A typical train between New York City and Albany consisted of two coaches and the coach-buffet or &quot;snack bar&quot; coach. Trains which operated west of Albany had additional coaches.

In the coming years all equipment will be replaced with Amtrak Airo trainsets, the railroad&#x27;s branding of its combination of Siemens Venture passenger cars and a Siemens Charger diesel-electric locomotive. The trainsets for the &quot;Empire Service&quot; will have six passenger cars, which will include a cab control car food service area and a mix of 2x2 Coach Class and 2x1 Business Class seating. The car closest to the locomotive will have batteries to supply electricity to traction motors in the locomotive when operating in Penn Station and the Empire Connection tunnel, eliminating the need for third rail propulsion. The arrangement will eliminate the time-consuming locomotive change at Albany–Rensselaer.

=== Classes of service ===
All classes of service include complimentary WiFi, an electric outlet (120 V, 60 Hz AC) at each seat, reading lamps, fold-out tray tables. Reservations are required on all trains, tickets may be purchased online, from an agent at some stations, a ticketing machine at most stations, or, at a higher cost, from the conductor on the train.
*Coach Class: 2x2 seating. Passengers self-select seats on a first-come, first-served basis.
*Business Class: 2x1 seating with more legroom than coach. Passengers receive complimentary soft drinks.

=== Route ===
The &quot;Empire Service&quot; operates over CSX Transportation, Metro-North Railroad, and Amtrak trackage:
* CSX trackage: Niagara Subdivision, Buffalo Terminal Subdivision, Rochester Subdivision, Mohawk Subdivision, Selkirk Subdivision, and Hudson Subdivision, Niagara Falls to Poughkeepsie (Amtrak-owned between Hoffmans and Schenectady, leased to Amtrak between Schenectady and Poughkeepsie)
* Metro-North Railroad: Hudson Line, Poughkeepsie to Spuyten Duyvil
* Amtrak: Empire Connection, Spuyten Duyvil to Penn Station

The northern terminus for most trains, Albany–Rensselaer, is the ninth-busiest Amtrak station in the country and the busiest serving a metropolitan area of fewer than two million people. This is mainly due to the large number of passengers traveling along the New York City–Albany corridor, which for years was to the New York Central what the Philadelphia–New York corridor was to the Pennsylvania Railroad.

From Spuyten Duyvil to Albany, the train runs mostly parallel to the Hudson River (viewable on the left side northbound and the right side southbound).

=== Station stops ===
All stops are within the U.S. state of New York.
== High-speed rail ==
The &quot;Empire Service&quot; has been a long-standing candidate for high-speed rail and electrification. The need for high-speed rail service has been addressed by former Governor George Pataki, former Senate Majority Leader Joseph Bruno, and members of the New York State Assembly who represent the upstate regions. Other politicians have asked that high-speed rail be introduced along the Empire Corridor, diminishing the time for New York City – Buffalo trains from seven hours to just three hours; train travel from New York City to Albany would take less than two hours to complete. This may introduce Acela trains to the Empire Corridor if high-speed rail is successful. Another reason, which politicians have noted, is that high-speed trains might help improve Upstate New York&#x27;s economy, which had become stagnant.

Currently, trains attain a maximum speed of on the stretch of track just northwest of Albany. Areas east of Schenectady also see speeds above . The overall average including stops is about 50 mph, taking nearly 9 hours to go 450 miles.

<text> (or , ; and &quot;&quot;, , and ) means &#x27;between the acts&#x27;. It can mean a pause between two parts of a stage production, synonymous to an intermission (this is nowadays the more common meaning in French), but it more often (in English) indicates a piece of music performed between acts of a theatrical production.

In the case of stage musicals, the serves as the overture of act 2 (and sometimes acts 3 and 4, as in &quot;Carmen&quot;). In films that were meant to be shown with an intermission, there was frequently a specially recorded on the soundtrack between the first and second half of the film, although this practice eventually died out.

==Origin==
Originally &quot;entr&#x27;actes&quot; resulted from stage curtains being closed for set or costume changes: to fill time as not to halt the dramatic action, to make a transition from the mood of one act to the next, or to prevent the public from becoming restless. In front of the closed curtains, the action could be continued during these &quot;entr&#x27;actes&quot;, albeit involving only players with no scenery other than the curtain, and a minimum of props.

An &quot;entr&#x27;acte&quot; can take the action from one part of a large-scale drama to the next by completing the missing links. The Spanish Sainete often performed a similar function.

==Role of music==
In traditional theatre, incidental music could also bridge the &quot;closed curtain&quot; periods: ballet, opera and drama each have a rich tradition of such musical interludes. The literal meaning of the German word &quot;&quot; refers to its original function – &quot;change music&quot;. Eventually, &quot;entr&#x27;actes&quot; (or &quot;intermezzi&quot;) would develop into a separate genre of short theatrical realizations (often with a plot completely independent from the main piece) that could be produced with a minimum of requisites during intermissions of other elaborate theatre pieces. These later &quot;entr&#x27;actes&quot; were distinctly intended to &quot;break&quot; the action or mood with something different, such as comedy or dance. Such pieces also allowed the chief players of the main piece to have a break. Eventually the idea of being an insert into a greater whole became looser: &quot;interlude&quot; sometimes has no other connotation than a &quot;short play&quot;.

==Other dramatic devices==
When the insert was intended only to shift the mood before returning to the main action, without a change of scene being necessary, authors could revert to a &quot;play within a play&quot; technique, or have some accidental guests in a ballroom perform a dance, etc. In this case the insert is a &quot;divertimento&quot; (the term is Italian; the French &quot;divertissement&quot; is also used) rather than an &quot;entr&#x27;acte&quot;.

In the French opera tradition of the end of the 17th century and early 18th century (Jean-Philippe Rameau, for example) such &quot;divertissements&quot; would become compulsory in the form of an inserted ballet passage, a tradition that continued until well into the 19th century. This was eventually parodied by Jacques Offenbach: for example, the cancan ending &quot;Orpheus in the Underworld&quot;.

By the middle of the 18th century, a &quot;divertimento&quot; had become a separate genre of light music as well. These &quot;divertimenti&quot; could be used as interludes in stage works, many of the &quot;divertimenti&quot; composed in the last half of the 18th century appears to have lost the relation to the theatre, the music in character only having to be a &quot;diversion&quot; in one or another way.

==Examples==
Some more or less elaborate or independent &quot;entr&#x27;actes&quot; or &quot;intermezzi&quot; became famous in their own right, in some cases eclipsing the theatre productions for which they were originally written:
* &quot;La serva padrona&quot;, a two-act &quot;opera buffa&quot; by Pergolesi, was intended to break the seriousness of his &quot;opera seria&quot; &quot;Il prigioner superbo&quot; (1733). Eventually the &quot;intermezzo&quot; got more attention than the large-scale work to which it was added (see &quot;Querelle des Bouffons&quot;).
* Mozart shows his mastery in the finale of the first act of &quot;Don Giovanni&quot;, where he mixes the &quot;divertimento&quot;-like dancing (accompanied by a small ensemble on the scene) with the actual singing. The characters mingle, performing light dances, while they are supposed to be chasing each other for murder and rape. The diversion and the drama become a single multi-layered item.
* Helmina von Chézy&#x27;s play &quot;Rosamunde&quot;, with music by Franz Schubert, has two famous entr&#x27;actes. The third entr&#x27;acte in B major, the &quot;Andantino&quot;, is famous for its idyllic melody, similar to Beethoven&#x27;s Seventh Symphony, which has been used in two of Schubert&#x27;s other works, while the first entr&#x27;acte in B minor is a suspected finale to his Eighth &quot;Unfinished&quot; Symphony.
* Bizet&#x27;s opera &quot;Carmen&quot; has &quot;entr&#x27;actes&quot; before acts 2, 3 and 4; the one before act 3, featuring flute and harp, is often played in concert performances.
* A comparable &#x27;filmic&#x27; interlude was foreseen in the early 1930s by Alban Berg for his opera &quot;Lulu&quot;, between the two scenes of the central act. In this case Berg only composed the music and gave a short schematic scenario for a film, that was not yet realised when he died in 1935. The &quot;Lulu&quot; interlude film, in contrast to the previous example, was intended to chain the action between the first and second half of the opera. Because of the completely symmetrical structure of this opera, the filmic interlude of &quot;Lulu&quot; is, in a manner of speaking, the axis of the opera.
* Interludes of the &quot;divertimento&quot; kind can be found in Leoš Janáček&#x27;s last, sombre opera &quot;From the House of the Dead&quot; (1928): releasing the tension after Skuratov&#x27;s disheartening tale at the centre of the second act, two an &quot;opera&quot; and a &quot;pantomime&quot; within the larger opera are executed consecutively by a cast of prisoners, both presentations farcical variations on the Don Juan theme, and mirroring the religious ceremony &quot;divertimento&quot; before the Skuratov tale.
* Also, the first publicly performed furniture music composed by Erik Satie was premiered as &quot;entr&#x27;acte&quot; music (1920 – the play for which it was written fell into oblivion), with this variation that it was intended as background music to the sounds the public would usually produce at intermission, walking around and talking. Allegedly, the public did not obey Satie&#x27;s intention: they kept silently in their places and listened, trained by a habit of incidental music, much to the frustration of the &quot;avant-garde&quot; musicians, who tried to save their idea by inciting the public to get up, talk, and walk around.
* Most of the film adaptations of Broadway musicals feature &quot;entr&#x27;actes&quot; during the intermission, which make use of music from the production.
* Many roadshow presentations of films from the 1950s through to the 1970s were provided with entr&#x27;actes that took the form of overtures to the second part, including most of the adaptations of Broadway musicals released at that time, but the practice soon spread to drama films. In many cases it was the same piece as was used for the entr&#x27;acte (as in &quot;Lawrence of Arabia&quot; in 1962 and &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot; in 1968), but others such as &quot;Ben-Hur&quot; (1959) and &quot;How the West Was Won&quot; (1962) employ different pieces.
&quot;Doctor Zhivago&quot;,
* The 1968 British-American film &quot;Chitty Chitty Bang Bang&quot;
* The 1970 film &quot;Tora! Tora! Tora!&quot;

<text>Alexei Shirov (, ; born 4 July 1972) is a Latvian and Spanish chess player. Shirov was ranked number two in the world in 1994. 

He won a match against Vladimir Kramnik in 1998 to qualify to play as challenger for the classical world championship match with Garry Kasparov; it never took place due to a lack of sponsorship.

==Career==
Shirov became the world under-16 champion in 1988 and was the runner-up at the World Junior Championship in 1990 (second on tiebreaks to Ilya Gurevich). In the same year, he achieved the title of Grandmaster. Shirov is the winner of numerous international tournaments: Biel 1991, Madrid 1997 (shared first place with Veselin Topalov), Ter Apel 1997, Monte Carlo 1998, Mérida 2000, Paul Keres Memorial Rapid Tournament in Tallinn (2004, 2005, 2011, 2012, 2013), Canadian Open Chess Championship 2005.

He reached second on the FIDE rating list in January and July 1994, behind Anatoly Karpov, though Garry Kasparov was excluded from those lists and was rated higher. In 1998, Shirov&#x27;s ranking rose again, to number four in the PCA rating list. On the basis of this rating, he was invited to play a ten-game match against Vladimir Kramnik to select a challenger for PCA World Champion Garry Kasparov. Shirov won the match with two wins, no losses and seven draws. However, the plans for the Kasparov match fell through when sufficient financial backing could not be found. When Kasparov instead played Kramnik for Kasparov&#x27;s world title in 2000, Shirov maintained that the match was invalid and he was the rightful challenger.

In 2000, Shirov reached the final of the FIDE World Chess Championship, losing 3½–½ to Viswanathan Anand.

In 2002, he played in the Candidates Tournament to choose a challenger for Classical World Champion Kramnik. He won his group of four, but lost his semi-final 2½–½ to eventual winner Peter Leko.

In May–June 2007 he played in the Candidates Tournament of the World Chess Championship 2007. He won his first-round match against Michael Adams (+1−1=4, won in rapid playoff), but was eliminated when he lost his second-round match to Levon Aronian (+0−1=5). this is Shirov&#x27;s last appearance at a Candidates Tournament.

In November–December 2007 Shirov played in the Chess World Cup 2007, which was a qualifier for the World Chess Championship 2010. He made the final, but lost the final 2½–1½ to Gata Kamsky.

In May 2009, Alexei Shirov won the category 21 M-Tel Masters 2009 tournament, held in Sofia, Bulgaria.

In September 2010, Shirov participated in the Grand Slam Chess Masters preliminary tournament in Shanghai, where he faced world No. 4 Levon Aronian, world No. 5 Vladimir Kramnik, and Wang Hao; the top two scorers qualified for the Grand Slam final supertournament from October 9 to 15 in Bilbao against world No. 1 Magnus Carlsen and World Champion Viswanathan Anand. After drawing his first two games, Shirov then won three consecutive games, including his first victory over Kramnik since 2003. Finishing with 4½/6 points, Shirov won the tournament, qualifying along with Kramnik for the Grand Slam final.

In May 2011, Shirov won a strong round-robin tournament in Lublin, Poland, the 3rd Lublin Union Memorial 2011 with a score of 5/7. In December 2011, he switched back federations from Spain to Latvia.

In February 2012, Shirov won the Aivars Gipslis Memorial in Riga with 8 points out of 9. In June 2012 Shirov won the Buenos Aires Masters Tournament (category 13) with 5½/7.

In August 2013, he played in the Chess World Cup. He won his first-round match against Hou Yifan, and was eliminated when he lost his second round match to Wei Yi. In August 2015, Shirov won the 5th Riga Technical University Open edging out Robert Hovhannisyan on tiebreak score, after both players finished on 7½/9. In March 2017, Shirov won the Mikhail Tal Memorial blitz tournament in Jūrmala scoring 9½/11 points.

In 2018 and 2019, he won the 5th and 6th Arica Open.

In September 2020, during the FIDE Online Chess Olympiad 2020, Shirov won the Gazprom Brilliancy Prize for his win as Black against Danyyil Dvirnyy in the Slav Defense, involving a queen sacrifice in a queenside attack, and achieved an overall score of 13/15 (+12−1=2) playing for the Spanish team.

In February 2021, Shirov won the 3rd Salamanca Chess Festival with a score of 6/7.

Through February and March 2022, Shirov played in the FIDE Grand Prix 2022. In the first leg, he placed fourth in Pool D with a 1.5/6 result. In the second leg, he tied with Vladimir Fedoseev for third in Pool C with a result of 2.5/6, finishing last in the standings with one point.

In July 2023, Shirov played in the 2023 Canadian Open Chess Championship. Shirov placed first with a result of 8.5/10.

==Personal life==
Shirov is of Russian descent. In 1994 he married an Argentine, Verónica Álvarez, moved to Tarragona, and became a citizen of Spain. From 2001 to 2007, He was married to Lithuanian Viktorija Čmilytė, also a chess grandmaster and one of the strongest female chess players in the world. Shortly before the Shanghai 2010 tournament, Shirov got married for a third time to WIM Olga Dolgova. At that time he still played for Spain, but he and his wife also had an apartment in Riga, Latvia.

==Playing style==

Shirov is noted for his attacking style, a tendency which has led to comparisons with fellow Latvian and former world champion, Mikhail Tal, under whom he studied in his youth.

===Illustrative game===

During the 1998 Linares chess tournament Shirov played Black against future FIDE world champion Veselin Topalov and won by sacrificing his only bishop in a bishop and pawn ending: 
:1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 g6 3.Nc3 d5 4.cxd5 Nxd5 5.e4 Nxc3 6.bxc3 Bg7 7.Bb5+ c6 8.Ba4 0-0 9.Ne2 Nd7 10.0-0 e5 11.f3 Qe7 12.Be3 Rd8 13.Qc2 Nb6 14.Bb3 Be6 15.Rad1 Nc4 16.Bc1 b5 17.f4 exd4 18.Nxd4 Bg4 19.Rde1 Qc5 20.Kh1 a5 21.h3 Bd7 22.a4 bxa4 23.Ba2 Be8 24.e5 Nb6 25.f5 Nd5 26.Bd2 Nb4 27.Qxa4 Nxa2 28.Qxa2 Bxe5 29.fxg6 hxg6 30.Bg5 Rd5 31.Re3 Qd6 32.Qe2 Bd7 33.c4 Bxd4 34.cxd5 Bxe3 35.Qxe3 Re8 36.Qc3 Qxd5 37.Bh6 Re5 38.Rf3 Qc5 39.Qa1 Bf5 40.Re3 f6 41.Rxe5 Qxe5 42.Qa2+ Qd5 43.Qxd5+ cxd5 44.Bd2 a4 45.Bc3 Kf7 46.h4 Ke6 47.Kg1 Bh3 (&quot;diagram&quot;) 48.gxh3 Kf5 49.Kf2 Ke4 50.Bxf6 d4 51.Be7 Kd3 52.Bc5 Kc4 53.Be7 Kb3 

Shirov&#x27;s bishop sacrifice (47...Bh3!!) is considered one of the greatest chess moves of all time.

<text>This Year&#x27;s Model is the second studio album by the English singer-songwriter Elvis Costello, released on 17March 1978 through Radar Records. After being backed by Clover for his debut album &quot;My Aim Is True&quot; (1977), Costello formed the Attractions—keyboardist Steve Nieve, bassist Bruce Thomas and drummer Pete Thomas (no relation)—as his permanent backing band. Recording sessions took place at London&#x27;s Eden Studios in eleven days between late1977 and early1978. Nick Lowe returned as producer, and Roger Béchirian acted as engineer. Most of the songs were written prior to the sessions, and debuted live during the latter half of 1977.

Embracing new wave, power pop and punk rock, the songs draw from bands such as the Rolling Stones and the Beatles. The lyrics explore subjects such as technologies of mass control and failing relationships, but in a manner that some reviewers found misogynistic. Echoing the lyrics of some of the tracks, the cover artwork, designed by the English graphic artist Barney Bubbles, shows Costello behind a camera on a tripod, emphasising his role as an observer.

The accompanying singles &quot;(I Don&#x27;t Want to Go to) Chelsea&quot; and &quot;Pump It Up&quot; were commercially successful and the album reached number four on the UK Albums Chart. The American LP was released in May1978 through Columbia Records. Substituting &quot;(I Don&#x27;t Want to Go to) Chelsea&quot; and &quot;Night Rally&quot; for &quot;Radio Radio&quot;, it reached number 30 on &quot;Billboard&quot; Top LPs &amp; Tape chart. &quot;This Year&#x27;s Model&quot; also received critical acclaim; reviewers highlighted strong songwriting and performances, while also admiring Costello and the band as artists. The album appeared on year-end lists in both the UK and the US.

In later decades, &quot;This Year&#x27;s Model&quot; has been acclaimed as one of Costello&#x27;s best works, some critics commenting on its influence on punk and new wave. It has appeared on several lists of the greatest albums of all time and has been reissued multiple times with bonus tracks. In 2021, Costello spearheaded a new version of the album titled &quot;Spanish Model&quot;, which featured songs from &quot;This Year&#x27;s Model&quot; sung in Spanish by Latin artists over the Attractions&#x27; original backing tracks. It received favourable reviews and charted on several &quot;Billboard&quot; charts.

==Background==
Elvis Costello was backed on his debut album &quot;My Aim Is True&quot; (1977) by the California-based country rock act Clover, whose laid-back approach he felt did not fit the sound of the times. Wanting a harder and sharper sound, he decided to assemble a permanent backing band. The first musician hired was Pete Thomas, former drummer of Chilli Willi and the Red Hot Peppers; the second hired was Bruce Thomas, a bassist whose previous involvements included several folk rock albums earlier in the decade; and last Steve Nieve, who had no prior band experience and had trained at the Royal College of Music. With Costello on guitar, he and the band, now named the Attractions, made their live debut on 14July 1977. Shortly after the release of &quot;My Aim Is True&quot; eight days later, the group performed an unauthorised show outside a Columbia Records convention, which led to Costello&#x27;s arrest. The stunt attracted the attention of record executive Greg Geller, who months later became integral in signing Costello to Columbia in the United States.

Costello and the band were on tour for most of the rest of 1977. The dates included the Greatest Stiffs Live Tour with other Stiff Records artists and their first tour of America. During this time, Stiff co-founder Jake Riviera departed Stiff due to disputes with the label&#x27;s co-founder Dave Robinson. Per Costello&#x27;s management contract, Costello followed Riviera and left Stiff for Radar Records but retained his American deal with Columbia. His final release for Stiff was that October&#x27;s &quot;Watching the Detectives&quot;, his first single to reach the UK top 20. In the meantime, Costello had written a large amount of new material which would appear on &quot;This Year&#x27;s Model&quot;.

According to the author Graeme Thomson, Costello&#x27;s reputation in the US grew faster than in the UK. He was acclaimed in publications such as &quot;Time&quot; and &quot;Newsweek&quot; and approached to appear on NBC&#x27;s &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; as a last-minute replacement for the Sex Pistols, which took place the day after the tour&#x27;s end. During the appearance, Costello and the Attractions played &quot;Watching the Detectives&quot; and began &quot;Less Than Zero&quot; before Costello abruptly cut the band off and counted them into the then-unreleased &quot;Radio Radio&quot;, a critique of the commercialisation of broadcasting. The impromptu stunt angered producer Lorne Michaels and resulted in Costello&#x27;s banning from &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; until 1989.

==Writing and recording==

&quot;This Year&#x27;s Model&quot; was recorded during a break in Costello&#x27;s touring schedule. Recording took place at Eden Studios, a 24-track studio in Acton, London, beginning towards the end of December 1977 and completing in early January 1978. Costello later said the entire album was recorded in about eleven days. The band briefly paused to play a three-night residency at London&#x27;s Nashville Rooms, which concluded on Christmas Eve 1977. Nick Lowe returned from &quot;My Aim Is True&quot; as producer and, in Thomson&#x27;s words, was the &quot;mad professor&quot;, pushing the band&#x27;s energy further to attain the best performance. Like the debut, Lowe primarily wanted to capture the songs live with few overdubs. Acting as a foil to Lowe was engineer Roger Béchirian, who Costello recalled was tasked with interpreting Lowe&#x27;s commands, such as &quot;turn the drums into one big maraca&quot; or &quot;make it sound like a dinosaur eating cars&quot;.

Costello stayed at Bruce Thomas&#x27;s flat during the sessions. According to Thomson, Costello remained focused despite keeping himself apart from his wife Mary during this time, which eventually led to their separation. Most of the songs had been written and performed live with the Attractions before the recordings. One of the final tracks written was &quot;Pump It Up&quot;, which Costello began writing outside a hotel fire escape during the Live Stiffs tour, debuting the song two days later and properly recording it in the studio a week after that. Having frequently played the tracks live, the band were able to complete them with few overdubs; some of Costello&#x27;s live guide vocals ended up in the final mix. Bruce Thomas recalled: &quot;We literally did the best tracks on the album – &quot;Pump It Up&quot;, &quot;(I Don&#x27;t Want to Go to) Chelsea&quot; – in one afternoon. It was like Motown. We&#x27;d just go in, play them, and that was it.&quot; Despite the fast-paced nature of the sessions, Béchirian recalled Costello coming off the tour with &quot;radiating energy&quot;:

Thomson says the sessions were &quot;vibrant&quot;, productive and completed without difficulty. They began each day around 11 a.m. and finished around 9 p.m. According to Béchirian, &quot;the whole thing was really good, it was really friendly, very positive. Everyone was really excited because they were the stars of the moment.&quot; Costello and the Attractions collaborated during the songwriting process. Although Costello preferred an &quot;immaculate approach&quot; to songwriting, wherein he would not present songs to the musicians until they were fully written, the Attractions offered suggestions that helped shape the songs. For &quot;(I Don&#x27;t Want to Go to) Chelsea&quot;, Costello based the guitar parts on the 1964 tracks &quot;I Can&#x27;t Explain&quot; by the Who and &quot;All Day and All of the Night&quot; by the Kinks, which the band used to create new figures to make &quot;Chelsea&quot; stand out on its own. The band recorded several outtakes, including &quot;Radio Radio&quot; and &quot;Big Tears&quot;, the latter featuring a guest contribution from the Clash guitarist Mick Jones. Other tracks written or demoed included &quot;Crawling to the U.S.A.&quot;, &quot;Running Out of Angels&quot;, &quot;Green Shirt&quot; and &quot;Big Boys&quot;.

===Mixing===
The album was mixed at Eden by Béchirian with Lowe and Costello in attendance; Costello did not contribute due to his relative inexperience in the studio. The mixing console had been custom-built by Béchirian in the early 1970s after the studio had changed locations. According to the author Mick St. Michael, Lowe intentionally made the record louder than its predecessor. Béchirian recalled in an interview with &quot;Mix&quot; magazine that Lowe&#x27;s primary goal was to &quot;make sure the bass sat in well with the kick&quot; and to bring Costello&#x27;s voice to the forefront. With the record completed, Costello and the Attractions toured America in January 1978.

==Music and lyrics==

In the 2002 liner notes, Costello mentioned the Rolling Stones&#x27; &quot;Aftermath&quot; (1966) as a major influence on &quot;This Year&#x27;s Model&quot;. Musically, the album embraces several styles, including new wave, power pop, punk rock, garage rock, and pop rock; St. Michael also recognised references to Merseybeat and glam. According to biographer Tony Clayton-Lea, rather than reusing the rockabilly and country sounds of &quot;My Aim Is True&quot;, &quot;This Year&#x27;s Model&quot; opts for straightforward pop music &quot;as influenced by punk rock&quot;. AllMusic editor Stephen Thomas Erlewine, on the other hand, defines the album as pure punk, with music that is &quot;nervous, amphetamine-fueled, [and] nearly paranoid&quot;.

In a contemporary interview with &quot;Creem&quot; magazine, Costello said the record contained less humour than its predecessor: &quot;It&#x27;s more vicious overall but far less personal, though.&quot; Referencing technologies of mass control, from corporate logos to night rallies, Hinton writes that the lyrics are &quot;strongly visual, as befits the voyeurism which fuels many of the songs&quot;. References to objects such as cameras, films and telephones are present throughout many tracks, in both positive and negative lights, which the author David Gouldstone argues creates a disillusioned world where greed and revenge are dominant. Like the cover artwork itself, the mechanical imagery emphasises observation rather than participation. Themes of uncertainty between reality and artifice previously emerged on &quot;Watching the Detectives&quot;, and appear throughout &quot;This Year&#x27;s Model&quot; on tracks such as &quot;Pump It Up&quot;, &quot;This Year&#x27;s Girl&quot; and &quot;Living In Paradise&quot;. The author James E. Perone interprets songs like &quot;Lipstick Vogue&quot;, &quot;(I Don&#x27;t Want to Go to) Chelsea&quot; and &quot;This Year&#x27;s Girl&quot; as relating to Costello&#x27;s former job working at cosmetics and perfume company Elizabeth Arden.

Some reviewers identified themes of misogyny. In 1978, the writer Jon Pareles found the album &quot;so wrong-headed, so full of hatred, [and] so convinced of its moral superiority&quot; in &quot;Crawdaddy&quot; magazine. Drawing comparisons to &quot;Aftermath&quot; similar lyrical content, &quot;Sounds&quot; magazine&#x27;s Jon Savage said that &quot;at least on occasion Elvis has the grace to make clear that it&#x27;s a two-way process and at fault. Just wanna be your victim...&quot;. Costello himself later wrote in the 2002 reissue&#x27;s liner notes that he never understood the misogynistic accusations, believing they &quot;clearly contained more sense of disappointment than disgust&quot;. Costello&#x27;s failure to succeed romantically is the focal point of most of the relationships described in the album. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; writer Kit Rachlis agreed, stating that all romances on the album are over or are about to commence, including a situation where he is unsure of whether to answer the phone or not (&quot;No Action&quot;) or coming to terms after rejecting all compromises (&quot;Lipstick Vogue&quot;).

===Side one===

&quot;No Action&quot; begins with Costello&#x27;s solo voice. The lyrics detail the regret of a failed relationship. Gouldstone said that the song is the first example of Costello&#x27;s use of &quot;thematic punning&quot;, meaning the incorporation of references that indirectly relate to the song&#x27;s main subject; &quot;No Action&quot;, in this case, uses a telephone as comparisons to the narrator&#x27;s companion. According to Costello, &quot;This Year&#x27;s Girl&quot; was written as an &quot;answer song&quot; to the Rolling Stones&#x27; &quot;Stupid Girl&quot; (1965). Other influences included the mid-1960s works of the Beatles. In his 2015 memoir, Costello wrote that the song discusses how men see women and what they desire from them. The song&#x27;s subject has achieved fame through fashion but it is only temporary, as by the next year, another girl will take her place. Once she realises it as time runs out, she feels cheated but by then it is too late. &quot;The Beat&quot; is primarily led by Nieve&#x27;s keyboard and the rhythm section of Bruce and Pete Thomas. The song explores the uncertainties and pains of adolescence and early manhood, and Hinton regards it as the closest thing on the album to romantic love. It quotes Cliff Richard&#x27;s &quot;Summer Holiday&quot; (1963) as a way to express enjoyment before the narrator is sought after by vigilantes.

&quot;Pump It Up&quot; was based on the stylings of Bob Dylan&#x27;s &quot;Subterranean Homesick Blues&quot; (1965) and Chuck Berry&#x27;s &quot;Too Much Monkey Business&quot; (1956). An energetic attack on a female chic society&#x27;s member, the song takes place in a nightclub, where its self-important members aspire to fit into high society, seeking purpose. The vocals are fuelled by obsessive sexual desire, while the rhythmic guitar riff is likened by Gouldstone to heavy metal. Writing for AllMusic, Mark Deming stated that the song &quot;perfectly captures the giddy but terrifying feeling of a wild, adrenaline-fueled all-night party that&#x27;s dangling on the verge of collapse.&quot; A softer track changing from soft soul to Burt Bacharach, &quot;Little Triggers&quot; is about a failing relationship caused by the woman&#x27;s indifference. The &#x27;little triggers&#x27; refer to the small things that occur in the beginning of a relationship that make it meaningful, such as kissing, body-brushing and lip expressions. &quot;Rock Australia Magazine&quot; Anthony O&#x27;Grady called it &quot;a hypnotic, frustrated, hurt love song that&#x27;s almost the mirror image of &#x27;Alison&#x27; [from &quot;My Aim Is True&quot;].&quot; &quot;You Belong to Me&quot; is heavily in debt to the Rolling Stones, using the same riff as &quot;The Last Time&quot; (1965). Lyrically, it is a plea for sexual freedom and is full of resentment and anger. Musically, AllMusic&#x27;s Stewart Mason likens it to 1960s garage rock.

===Side two===
The track &quot;Hand in Hand&quot; opens with guitar feedback evoking the Beatles and Jimi Hendrix. Although the music provides a Merseybeat shuffle, the dark and revenge-driven lyrics follow two lovers walking hand in hand straight to Hell. Like &quot;No Action&quot; and &quot;My Aim Is True&quot; &quot;I&#x27;m Not Angry&quot;, the narrator tries to deal with chaotic emotions by denying they ever occurred. &quot;(I Don&#x27;t Want to Go to) Chelsea&quot; is a ska-infected rocker that was originally directly influenced by the works of the Who, before Bruce and Pete Thomas contributed new rhythms that made the track stand out on its own. Lyrically, the song attacks fashionable society; the girl is described as &#x27;last year&#x27;s model&#x27;, as she has suffered a fall from grace. According to Rachlis, &quot;Chelsea represents Costello&#x27;s nightmare world of success, where deceit is masked by propriety and last year&#x27;s model is thrown out with yesterday&#x27;s wash.&quot; &quot;Lip Service&quot; represents a culmination of Beatles influences into a track that contains sexual innuendos, both in its lyrics and title. It is primarily led by Bruce Thomas&#x27;s bassline, which Hinton compares to the sound of the Hollies. The partially vague lyrics express a narrator&#x27;s sexual frustrations on a would-be lover and observations on insincerity around him.

&quot;Living in Paradise&quot; was written in 1975 when Costello was a member of the pub rock band Flip City. O&#x27;Grady calls it as &quot;shuffling power-pop reggae detailing how dreams of soft-living actualise in soul-decaying corruption&quot;. Morgan Troper of &quot;PopMatters&quot; maintained that it abandons the punk workings of the rest of the album for a ska-type rhythm. According to Gouldstone the track has themes already present in the album&#x27;s other songs, including misogynistic ideals. &quot;Lipstick Vogue&quot; is described by AllMusic&#x27;s Tom Maginnis as a showcase for the band&#x27;s energy and skill. It opens with a drum fill by Pete Thomas before Bruce Thomas and Nieve drive on bass and keyboards, respectively. Reflecting themes of alienation, the song is about the perils of imperfect love. &quot;Night Rally&quot; provides commentary on the then-prevalent UK National Front. It presents, in Hinton&#x27;s words, a &quot;nightmare of state control and worse&quot; that argues how totalitarianism infiltrates and affects society. Costello compares conglomerate corporations to these types of governments, in how they attempt to control the people. It cuts off abruptly, ending the album on, in St. Michael&#x27;s words, &quot;an explicit and disturbingly pessimistic note&quot;.

==Packaging and artwork==

The original UK cover artwork for &quot;This Year&#x27;s Model&quot; was deliberately off-centre, making the title appear as &quot;His Year&#x27;s Model&quot; and the artist &quot;Lvis Costello&quot;. The design by Barney Bubbles left a printers&#x27; colour bar intact along the right side. The American and Swedish sleeves were lined up correctly and not off-centre. Riviera&#x27;s F-Beat Records released a May 1980 issue with an aligned sleeve, which has been retained for all subsequent releases.

Photographed by Chris Gabrin, the front cover depicts Costello in his signature black framed glasses, wearing a dark suit with a polka dot shirt, glaring from behind a camera on a tripod. In Thomson&#x27;s words, he is &quot;expressionless&quot; and &quot;both observed and observing&quot;. According to Hinton, it was a &quot;careful reconstruction&quot; of David Hemmings from Michelangelo Antonioni&#x27;s &quot;Blow Up&quot; (1966). The British cover had Costello standing back with his hands open; on the American cover, he crouched forward with both hands gripping the camera like a gun; a third shot was also used for the Swedish release. The back cover depicts Costello and the Attractions in a small, dimly lit hotel room reacting to a television with mock horror. Three of them are wearing black ties while Nieve dons a V-neck pullover. The inner sleeve depicts a robotic hand gripping a miniature TV on which Costello is playing, standing on one leg, and the other side depicts four colour-coded and dismembered mannequin bodies wearing string vests in a laundromat. Hinton states that the label&#x27;s gimmick at the time was off-centre sleeves and avant-garde inner fold images.

The Attractions were acknowledged on the LP labels but did not receive sleeve credits on the original release. The LP labels contain text between the holding spirals reading &quot;Special pressing No. 003. Ring 434-3232. Ask for Moira for your prize&quot;. Packaged with the first 50,000 copies of the LP was a free 7&quot; single containing &quot;Stranger in the House&quot;, an outtake from &quot;My Aim Is True&quot; left off the album due to its country-influenced sound, with a live cover of the Damned&#x27;s &quot;Neat Neat Neat&quot; as the B-side. The first American pressings contain Costello&#x27;s rather than Columbia&#x27;s logo.

==Release and promotion==
The band&#x27;s North American tour before the album&#x27;s release lasted from January to . The setlist consisted of tracks from both &quot;My Aim Is True&quot; and &quot;This Year&#x27;s Model&quot;, as well as B-sides and covers. The tour was positively received, but contributed to the growing exhaustion of Costello and the Attractions.

Radar released the first single, &quot;(I Don&#x27;t Want to Go to) Chelsea&quot;, backed by &quot;You Belong to Me&quot;, on 3March 1978 in the UK, which received acclaim and reached number 16 on the UK Singles Chart. A performance in Toronto on 6March was heavily bootlegged, and was eventually issued as &quot;Live at the El Mocambo&quot; in 1993 with the &quot;2½ Years&quot; box set, and as a standalone release in 2009. &quot;This Year&#x27;s Model&quot; was released in the UK on 17March with the catalogue number RAD3. Costello and the Attractions undertook a 28-date UK tour between March and April. The dates were plagued with problems, including Bruce Thomas cutting his hand smashing a glass bottle, requiring Lowe to substitute for him; Thomas wore bandages for the filming of promotional clips for &quot;(I Don&#x27;t Want to Go to) Chelsea&quot; and &quot;Pump It Up&quot;. Costello grew more exhausted from constant touring but continued writing new material. By the tour&#x27;s end, &quot;This Year&#x27;s Model&quot; had reached number 4 on the UK Albums Chart.
Another US tour commenced just three days after the previous tour&#x27;s end. With Bruce Thomas still unavailable, Costello brought back Clover guitarist John Ciambotti, who only had one day of rehearsal. Throughout the tour, Costello and the band continued the wild behaviour they had become known for—both on and off stage—and experienced an increase in drug use, lack of sleep and growing exhaustion. Songs that would appear on Costello&#x27;s next album, 1979&#x27;s &quot;Armed Forces&quot;, began appearing in the set-lists. &quot;This Year&#x27;s Model&quot; was issued in the US in May1978; Columbia substituted &quot;(I Don&#x27;t Want to Go to) Chelsea&quot; and &quot;Night Rally&quot; with &quot;Radio Radio&quot; on the notion that the lyrics on both tracks were &quot;too English&quot;. It reached to number 30 on &quot;Billboard&quot; Top LPs &amp; Tape chart. The Scandinavian release retained the UK track listing and added &quot;Watching the Detectives&quot; as the final track on side one. It reached number 10 in Sweden. Elsewhere, &quot;This Year&#x27;s Model&quot; reached the top 20 in New Zealand (11), the Netherlands (14) and Norway (15), and the top 30 in Canada (21) and Australia (26).

The tour lasted until June1978, after which the band again toured Europe. &quot;Pump It Up&quot;, backed by &quot;Big Tears&quot;, was released as the second single in June, which peaked at number 24 in the UK, earning Costello another appearance on BBC&#x27;s &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;. In July, Costello recorded &quot;Stranger in the House&quot; with country artist George Jones, which appeared on the latter&#x27;s &quot;My Very Special Guests&quot; album in 1979, before commencing the recording sessions for &quot;Armed Forces&quot;. &quot;This Year&#x27;s Girl&quot;, backed by &quot;Big Tears&quot;, was issued as a US single. After appearing on the American LP, &quot;Radio Radio&quot; was released as a stand-alone single in the UK on 24October 1978, backed by &quot;Tiny Steps&quot;.
==Critical reception==

&quot;This Year&#x27;s Model&quot; was well received on release. Many critics deemed it superior to &quot;My Aim Is True&quot;, praised the Attractions as a better band than Clover, and highlighted the strong songwriting and performances. &quot;Melody Maker&quot; Allan Jones called it &quot;an achievement so comprehensive, so inspired, that it exhausts superlatives&quot;. He wrote that &quot;the penetration of the language matches the vaulting hysteria of the performance&quot; and concluded that the record &quot;promotes its author to the foremost ranks of contemporary rock writers&quot;, such as Bruce Springsteen. &quot;Cash Box&quot; remarked that &quot;This Year&#x27;s Model&quot; allowed Costello to surpass early comparisons of Springsteen and Graham Parker to establish his own identity. &quot;Rock Australia Magazine&quot; Anthony O&#x27;Grady dubbed &quot;This Year&#x27;s Model&quot; &quot;the best collection of...fashion-conscious songs since Ray Davies [of the Kinks] started his &#x27;Dedicated Follower of Fashion&#x27; period.&quot; Tom Zito of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; had a hard time recalling an artist whose sophomore record surpassed their &quot;already impressive&quot; debut.
Several reviewers placed Costello as one of the best British New Wave artists. In &quot;Circus&quot; magazine, Fred Schruers lauded his lyrics, musicianship and angry persona, and cited &quot;This Year&#x27;s Model&quot; as having fulfilled &quot;every new wave expectation&quot;. Robert Christgau of &quot;The Village Voice&quot; also saw Costello&#x27;s emotional delivery as full of anger and grimace, which he found &quot;more attractive musically and verbally than all his melodic and lyrical tricks&quot;. In the midst of the punk movement, Christgau acknowledged the genre&#x27;s influence on the album and artist. &quot;Creem&quot; Alan Madeleine found the artist proves himself &quot;stylistically mindful&quot;: he is &quot;distinct enough from any other extant act to be noted, yet cautious of excess experimentation in this establishmental sophomore phase.&quot; &quot;Record Mirror&quot; Tim Lott considered the songs &quot;less vicious&quot; than its predecessors, but said the artist remains an &quot;Aladdin&#x27;s cave of anti-matter&quot;. He called Costello&#x27;s voice &quot;insubstantial but wiry&quot;, the music &quot;clever in its very lack of detail&quot;, and compared the organ-heavy sound with Blondie: a Sixties sound &quot;trapped for ten years on atmospherics&quot;. Naming &quot;This Year&#x27;s Model&quot; the winner of May 1978&#x27;s &quot;disc derby&quot; in the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, Robert Hilburn wrote that Costello&#x27;s vocals &quot;bristle with conviction and bite that we rarely find in rock in the &#x27;70s&quot;. Other critics highlighted Lowe&#x27;s production.

Some critics were less enthusiastic. Savage felt Costello was &quot;less than likable&quot; and the Attractions &quot;spare yet full&quot;, but ultimately considered the album &quot;an excellent, soon-to-be-popular&quot; record. In &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, Rachlis believed the album was more &quot;musically and thematically&quot; cohesive than &quot;My Aim Is True&quot;, but not &quot;diminish[ing] the prodigal brilliance&quot; of its predecessor. Conversely, Joel Selvin of the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; found &quot;no new surprises&quot; on &quot;Model&quot;, but felt the songs improved on the style exhibited on &quot;Aim&quot;, concluding that it &quot;should satisfy his growing legion of fans, as well as gain new converts&quot;. In &quot;The New York Times&quot;, John Rockwell described &quot;This Year&#x27;s Model&quot; as a &quot;fine&quot; record that maintains all of the artist&#x27;s previous angry energy, yet &quot;filling out the arrangements with a richness of texture (organ especially) that is very appealing&quot;. Pareles was critical of the overtly misogynistic themes.

&quot;This Year&#x27;s Model&quot; was voted the best album of 1978 by both &quot;Melody Maker&quot; and &quot;The Village Voice&quot;. It was highly placed in other year-end lists by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, &quot;NME&quot; (3), &quot;Record Mirror&quot; (5) and &quot;Sounds&quot; (8).

==Legacy and influence==
&quot;This Year&#x27;s Model&quot; continues to receive critical acclaim. Journalists praise the Attractions&#x27; music, describing them as one of the best backing bands in rock music. Gouldstone wrote that with Costello on guitar, they became a band who are &quot;capable of making even mediocre music listenable and of giving Costello&#x27;s greatest songs an enthralling sense of intensity and immediacy.&quot; Erlewine described them as giving the album a &quot;reckless, careening feel&quot;, further commending the sound, concluding that &quot;Costello and the Attractions never rocked this hard, or this vengefully, ever again.&quot; Writing for &quot;Pitchfork&quot; in 2002, Matt LeMay said they were the reason the album was superior to &quot;My Aim Is True&quot;, and that &quot;it&#x27;s not only a more complex and dynamic album, but also one that steers well clear of the retro guitar twang that marred the less interesting bits of his debut.&quot; Declaring &quot;This Year&#x27;s Model&quot; not only Costello&#x27;s best, but one of the best albums ever made, he stated that it balanced the &quot;raw energy&quot; of its predecessor with the &quot;more elegant pop songwriting&quot; of his later works.&quot; Writing for &quot;Blender&quot; magazine, Douglas Wolk considered the Attractions &quot;perfect creative foils&quot; for Costello, particularly signalling out Nieve&#x27;s playing throughout the record.

Critics consider &quot;This Year&#x27;s Model&quot; one of Costello&#x27;s best, and &quot;angriest&quot;, works. &quot;Spin&quot; Al Shipley argued that Costello was never able surpass the record&#x27;s &quot;inventive punch&quot;, while Michael Gallucci of &quot;Ultimate Classic Rock&quot; deemed it the work that &quot;bridged his brief past with his wide-open future&quot;. Troper deemed it Costello&#x27;s &quot;most consistent&quot; release and finest with the Attractions, finding it the artist&#x27;s &quot;most live-sounding, most punk, and most honest record of his dauntingly expansive career&quot;. &quot;PopMatters&quot; writers Jason Mendelsohn and Eric Klinger hailed the album as &quot;simple, refreshing, and surprisingly modern&quot; and &quot;an object lesson that the New Wave could compete on the old school&#x27;s field&quot;, respectively. &quot;Consequence of Sound&quot; Ryan Bray named it the first of Costello and the Attractions&#x27; eight-year run he nicknamed &quot;murderer&#x27;s row&quot;. Reviewing in 2008, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; Rob Sheffield named &quot;This Year&#x27;s Model&quot; as an album everyone should own, saying the songs &quot;remain brutally funny, sung with moments of unexpected tenderness&quot;. Regarding Costello&#x27;s musicianship, &quot;Uncut&quot; Paul Moody argued that after he &quot;dispensed with his musical safety net entirely&quot; from &quot;My Aim Is True&quot;, &quot;This Year&#x27;s Model&quot; began &quot;his insatiable urge to &#x27;bite the hand that feeds me&#x27;.&quot; The album was not without its detractors. &quot;Mojo&quot; magazine&#x27;s Jim Irvin was more mixed on the material and arrangements, overall finding the album &quot;unfeasibly invigorating&quot; following its &quot;mild-mannered&quot; predecessor, but liked Lowe&#x27;s production.

Some reviewers mention the album&#x27;s influence on punk and its evolution into new wave. In 2002, &quot;Uncut&quot; magazine&#x27;s Chris Roberts called Costello the &quot;bitter bard of the punk era&quot;, writing that with &quot;This Year&#x27;s Model&quot;, he &quot;articulat[ed] a generation&#x27;s ire every bit as caustically as the [Sex] Pistols&#x27; gigantic guitars&quot;. Bray cited it as the album that proved pop and punk could co-exist. Writing for &quot;Record Collector&quot; in 2008, Terry Staunton cited it as &quot;the post-punk distillation of the times&quot;, especially in London, and ten years later, Nick Hasted named it the &quot;template&quot; for the transition from punk to new wave. Regarding the album&#x27;s position in the new wave genre, punknews.org&#x27;s Julie River described &quot;This Year&#x27;s Model&quot; as one of the first and strongest new wave albums, ultimately standing as one of Costello&#x27;s finest albums. &quot;Paste&quot; magazine&#x27;s Andy Whitman went further, describing the album as &quot;the moment when New Wave found its frontman&quot;. Both River and Whitman agreed the album has aged well.

Thomson described the songs as &quot;tight and instantly memorable&quot;, and mentioned Costello&#x27;s improved songwriting and the Attractions&#x27; performances. Hinton considers it &quot;light years ahead&quot; of its predecessor, creating a &quot;paranoid universe, where everyone is being watched.&quot; St. Michael similarly writes that the record &quot;provokes and invokes&quot; the listener as much as it entertains. In &quot;The Words &amp; Music of Elvis Costello&quot;, Perone calls &quot;This Year&#x27;s Model&quot; one of the &quot;strongest sophomore efforts of any singer-songwriter&quot;, arguing that it affirmed the seeds that outlined on &quot;My Aim Is True&quot; that predicted the artist&#x27;s future projects. The author also comments that it debuted one of the strongest four-piece rock bands of the era.

Black Francis of Pixies named the album as a favorite, recalling, &quot;The [album] I listened to the most [at college], though, was &quot;This Year&#x27;s Model&quot;. ... Instead of studying I&#x27;d go in [my room] and listen to Elvis Costello over and over until my ears hurt and my head couldn&#x27;t take it anymore&quot;.

===Rankings===
&quot;This Year&#x27;s Model&quot; often appears on lists of the greatest albums of all time. In 2000 &quot;Q&quot; placed it at number 82 on its list of the &quot;100 Greatest British Albums Ever&quot;. In 1987, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; placed the album at number 11 on its list of the best of the past 20 years, and said that Costello charted &quot;the modern romantic terrain with keen cynicism, caustic wit and furious energy.&quot; The same magazine ranked the album number 98 in its list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time in 2003, maintaining the rating in a 2012 revised list, and dropping to number 121 in a 2020 revised list. In lists compiling the 100 greatest albums of all time, &quot;Mojo&quot;, &quot;NME&quot; and &quot;Spin&quot; ranked &quot;This Year&#x27;s Model&quot; at numbers 69, 40 and 8 in 1995, 1985 and 1989, respectively. &quot;NME&quot; listed it at number 256 in their 2013 list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time. In a 2018 issue selecting 70 landmark albums of the past 70 years, &quot;Record Collector&quot; chose &quot;This Year&#x27;s Model&quot; as their pick for 1978. In 2004, &quot;Pitchfork&quot; Sam Ubl ranked it the 52nd best album of the 1970s, calling it &quot;one of [Costello&#x27;s] most deceptive rock records&quot;, and in 2012, &quot;Paste&quot; placed it at number 35 in a similar list. &quot;Ultimate Classic Rock&quot; also included it in their list of the 100 best rock albums from the decade. &quot;Paste&quot; magazine also ranked it the 19th greatest new wave album in 2016. The album was included in the 2018 edition of Robert Dimery&#x27;s book &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;.

==Reissues==

&quot;This Year&#x27;s Model&quot; was first released on CD through Columbia and Demon Records in January1986. Its first extended reissue came in October1993 through Demon in the UK and Rykodisc in the US, which added the bonus tracks &quot;Radio Radio&quot;, &quot;Crawling to the U.S.A.&quot;, &quot;Running Out of Angels&quot;, &quot;Greenshirt&quot; and &quot;Big Boys&quot;. The 2002 CD reissue by Rhino Entertainment added more tracks on top of the 1993 additions; with this release, &quot;Radio Radio&quot; was sequenced as the album closer after &quot;Night Rally&quot;. Troper argues that the addition changes the record&#x27;s tone immensely, stating that as &quot;Radio Radio&quot; is more upbeat, it brings the album to a proper conclusion compared to the disturbing imagery and abrupt ending of &quot;Night Rally&quot;.

In 2008, it was reissued again by Universal/Hip-O Records as a deluxe edition, featuring most of the same tracks as the Rhino reissue, with the addition of a 13-track live bonus disc taken from a show at the Warner Theater in Washington, D.C., on 28February 1978. For its 2021 remaster by UMe, &quot;Big Tears&quot; was added before &quot;Radio Radio&quot; on the standard album, bringing the total track count to 14.

==&quot;Spanish Model&quot;==
In 2018, Costello collaborated with singer Natalie Bergman for a new version of &quot;This Year&#x27;s Girl&quot; for the second season of the American television series &quot;The Deuce&quot;. For this version, Costello and his frequent collaborator, producer Sebastian Krys, added new vocals from Bergman alongside Costello&#x27;s originals. The project led Costello to conceive a reimagining of &quot;This Year&#x27;s Model&quot; entirely in Spanish. The project, titled &quot;Spanish Model&quot;, features 16 songs from the &quot;This Year&#x27;s Model&quot; period sung by an array of Latin artists, including Juanes, Jorge Drexler, Luis Fonsi, Francisca Valenzuela, Fuego, Draco Rosa and Fito Páez, replacing Costello&#x27;s original vocals but retaining Costello and the Attractions&#x27; original backing instrumentation.

In a 2021 interview with &quot;Mojo&quot;, Costello said that he had three requirements for the project: he wanted a lesser-known line-up, each singer would translate his or her own song and the Attractions&#x27; original backing tracks would be used. He was insistent on the quality of the band&#x27;s performances: &quot;Take my voice out of it and the playing from Pete, Bruce and Steve is sensational.&quot; As a non-Spanish speaker, Costello and Krys worked with songwriters Elsten Torres, Ximena Muñoz, Luis Mitre and Andie Sandoval to translate the lyrics. Costello told &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;:

The lyrics themselves are not literal translations. The first track completed was Cami&#x27;s reinterpretation of &quot;This Year&#x27;s Girl&quot; titled &quot;La Chica de Hoy&quot;, which literally means &quot;the girl of today&quot;. Costello explained that it has the same ideas as the original track, but Cami introduced reflections from her own career. &quot;Radio Radio&quot; was given &quot;the most radical change&quot; due to the track&#x27;s now-outdated themes. &quot;Night Rally&quot; and &quot;Chelsea&quot; were also given changes to instead reflect the rise of Spanish fascism and the updated location of Miami, respectively. Krys originally intended to mimic Lowe and Béchirian&#x27;s original mix, but decided it worked better when he mixed the backing tracks around the new vocals.

Many of the Latin performers connected with the music on the original album. La Marisoul, a huge fan of Costello&#x27;s, felt honoured to sing &quot;Little Triggers&quot;, now titled &quot;Detonantes&quot;. The artist approached the track by saying &quot;Okay, I&#x27;m gonna live in these lyrics&quot;. For &quot;Radio Radio&quot;, Fito Páez amended it to the current era where he presented himself &quot;like this old dinosaur who goes back to his little radio to listen to Elvis Costello&quot;. Juanes, who recalled watching the music video for &quot;Pump It Up&quot; on MTV, offered a Spanish take on the lyric&#x27;s events for his version of the song. Francisca Valenzuela, who sang &quot;Hand In Hand&quot; with Luis Humberto Navejas, cited &quot;This Year&#x27;s Model&quot; and &quot;Imperial Bedroom&quot; (1982) as her favourite records by Costello and was delighted when she was approached for the project, stating: &quot;I think it reflects something we&#x27;re all interested in, which is the multiculturalism and syncretism of music.&quot; Draco Rosa was thrilled at the opportunity to provide a new and natural take on &quot;The Beat&quot;, titled &quot;Yo Te Vi&quot;.

Preceded by the release of Juanes&#x27;s &quot;Pump It Up&quot; on 15July 2021, Spanish Model was issued on 10September through record label UMe and was packaged with the 2021 remaster of the original album. Costello said in a statement: &quot;Part of the fun of this project is its unexpected nature. Although, I think people in my audience that have been paying attention are pretty much used to surprises by now.&quot; Speaking to &quot;Mojo&quot;, he stated that the Attractions, Lowe and Béchirian all responded positively to &quot;Spanish Model&quot;.

&quot;Spanish Model&quot; earned Costello and the Attractions their first top-ten entry on a &quot;Billboard&quot; Latin chart, reaching number six on Latin Pop Albums. It also charted at number 50 on the Top Album Sales, number 32 on the Top Current Album Sales and number 38 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top Latin Albums. The album debuted to 2,000 album-equivalent units in the US the week of 16 September 2021.

===Critical reception===

&quot;Spanish Model&quot; has been favourably reviewed by music critics. Erlewine commended the new vocals, stating that the Latin singers retain the &quot;barbed humour&quot; and &quot;spiky politics&quot; of the original album. He believes the new songs improved the project overall and expand the &quot;musical and emotional palette&quot;, creating an album that was &quot;not as a curiosity but rather a small wonder, revealing new dimensions of the original recording while opening up these songs for new audiences&quot;. &quot;Mojo&quot; John Aizlewood found the project unnecessary but refreshing.

In &quot;PopMatters&quot;, Marty Lipp cited the project as a complete display of the Attractions&#x27; strength as a band and recognised how many of the Latin singers on the project were female, which represented a &quot;striking reversal&quot; of the &quot;she done me wrong&quot; mentality that pervaded a majority of Costello&#x27;s early work. He felt that the absence of Costello&#x27;s &quot;brilliantly cynical wordplay&quot; did the album more harm than good, particularly on &quot;Pump It Up&quot;, but considered the project &quot;still as exciting and fun as ever&quot; and commended Costello for continuing to surprise his fans. Matthew Berlyant in &quot;Under the Radar&quot; magazine called the project unique and praised Costello for taking a major left turn almost 45 years into his career. He highlighted the rearranged track listing and additions to the original record as making the project stand on its own, concluding that Costello succeeded in both bringing attention to the original album and the Spanish-speaking artists that enveloped &quot;Spanish Model&quot;.

<text>James Sacra Albus (May 4, 1935 – April 17, 2011) was an American engineer, Senior NIST Fellow and founder and former chief of the Intelligent Systems Division of the Manufacturing Engineering Laboratory at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).

==Biography==
Born in Louisville, Kentucky, Albus received the B.S. degree in physics from Wheaton College, Illinois, in 1957 and the M.S. degree in electrical engineering from Ohio State University, Columbus, in 1958. In 1972 he received a Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering from the University of Maryland, College Park.

From 1957 to 1973 Albus worked at NASA starting in 1957 as Physicist-Engineer on Project Vanguard at the Naval Research Laboratory, Washington DC. From 1958 to 1969 he was Physicist-Engineer at the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center and from 1963 Acting Head of the Video Techniques Section. From 1969 to March 1973 he was head of the Cybernetics and Subsystems Development Section. In the 1960s he was associated with the early Vanguard satellite program and responsible for the optical aspect sensors on seven Goddard satellites, more than ten sounding rockets, and over 15 NASA spacecraft.

From 1973 to 2008 Albus worked at the National Bureau of Standards (NBS) which changed its name in 1988 to the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). March 1973 to June 1980 he was Project Manager for Sensors and Computer Control Technology, NBS where he developed the Cerebellar Model Arithmetic Computer (CMAC) neural net model. From June 1980 to January 1981 he was leader of the Programmable Automation Group at the NBS and developed the RCS reference model architecture for the Automated Manufacturing Research Facility.

From 1981 to 1996 he was chief of the Robot Systems Division at NIST. Here he founded the Robot Systems Division, developed the RoboCrane, and many applications of the RCS architecture for DARPA, NASA, ARL, U.S. Bureau of Mines, Ford, and General Motors. From 1995 to 1998 as Chief, Intelligent Systems Division, NIST he managed a Division of 35 professional scientists and engineers with an $8+ million per year budget. He developed the 4D/RCS architecture for the Army Research Lab (ARL) Demo III Experimental Unmanned Vehicle program. From 1998 to 2008 he was a Senior NIST Fellow, National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Provided technical leadership to the Intelligent Systems Division and served as Principal Investigator for the implementation of intelligent ground vehicle projects funded by the Army and DARPA.

From June 2008 to 2009 he was a Senior Fellow of the Krasnow Institute for Advanced Studies at George Mason University, Fairfax, Virginia, where he worked toward advancing the understanding of the computational and representational mechanisms of the human brain. From 2008 to 2011 he worked part-time at Robotic Technology Incorporated (RTI) and Robotic Research, LLC.

He was a member of the editorial board of the Wiley Series on Intelligent Systems served on the editorial boards of six journals related to intelligent systems and robotics&quot; &quot;Autonomous Robots&quot;, &quot;Robotics and Autonomous Systems&quot;, &quot;Journal of Robotic Systems&quot;, &quot;Intelligent Automation&quot; and &quot;Soft Computing&quot;.

In 1962 he received the highest NASA cash award granted to that time for the invention of the Digital Solar Aspect Sensor. In 1984 he was winner of the Joseph F. Engelberger Award for robotics technology. He also received several other awards for his work in control theory including the NIST Applied Research Award, the Department of Commerce Gold and Silver Medals, the Industrial Research IR-100 award, the Presidential Rank Meritorious Executive, the Jacob Rabinow Award, and the Japan Industrial Robot Association R&amp;D Award.

==Work==
Albus made contributions to cerebellar robotics, developed a two-handed manipulator system known as the Robocrane (a crane-like variation on the Stewart platform idea), and proposed an economic concept known as &quot;Peoples&#x27; Capitalism&quot;. Peoples&#x27; Capitalism is similar to the ideas of Louis O. Kelso and discusses the question &quot;how would we live without jobs?&quot;. Albus himself described the impact of his economic ideas as &quot;slight&quot;.

Albus&#x27;s vision concerns included the following: a world without poverty, a world of prosperity, a world of opportunity, a world without pollution, a world without war, and includes a detailed plan for achievement of these goals.

===Brain theory===
In 1971, he published a new theory of cerebellar function that modified and extended a previous theory published by David Marr in 1969.

===Neural nets===
Based on his cerebellar model, Albus invented a new type of neural net computer, the Cerebellar Model Articulation Controller (CMAC), for which he received the IR-100 award from Industrial Research Magazine as one of the 100 most important industrial innovations of the year 1976.

===RoboCrane===
Albus invented and developed a new generation of robot cranes based on six cables and six winches configured as a Stewart platform.

===Real-time Control System===
Albus co-invented the Real-Time Control System (RCS), a reference model architecture that has been used over the past 25 years for a number of intelligent systems including the NBS Automated Manufacturing Research Facility (AMRF), the NASA telerobotic servicer, a DARPA Multiple Autonomous Undersea Vehicle project, a nuclear Submarine Operational Automation System, a Post Office General Mail facility, a Bureau of Mines automated mining system, a commercial open architecture machine tool controller, and numerous advanced robotic projects, including the Army Research Lab Demo III Experimental Unmanned Ground vehicle.

During the 1980s, the Albus-Barbera reference model architecture (a.k.a. RCS - for Real-time Control System) provided the fundamental integrating principle of the National Bureau of Standards (NBS) Automated Manufacturing Research Facility (AMRF.) This was an $80 million experimental automated factory-of-the-future. It was co-funded by the U.S. Navy Manufacturing Technology Program and the National Bureau of Standards (NBS). The success of the AMRF was largely responsible for the Congressional Legislation that transformed NBS into NIST.

===Computational Theory of Mind===
The 4D-RCS Reference Model Architecture is a reference model for military unmanned vehicles developed by the NIST, which describes how software components of military unmanned vehicles should be identified and organized. Albus has extended the reference model to a cognitive architecture for Intelligent Multi-Agent Systems. Albus (2009) described:

This extended architecture is designed to enable any level of intelligent behavior, up to and including human levels of performance in driving vehicles and coordinating tactical behaviors between autonomous air, ground, and amphibious vehicle systems. It addresses the fundamental theoretical questions regarding whether computational processes are capable of emulating the functional processes in the brain, and provides a theoretical basis for understanding how the machinery of the brain generates the processes of the mind. Albus&#x27; work has led to a biologically plausible model of representation and computation in the human cortex.
==Publications==

<text>Hugh Lawson White (October 30, 1773April 10, 1840) was an American politician during the first third of the 19th century. After filling in several posts particularly in Tennessee&#x27;s judiciary and state legislature since 1801, thereunder as a Tennessee Supreme Court justice, he was chosen to succeed Andrew Jackson in the United States Senate in 1825. He became a member of the new Democratic Party, supporting Jackson&#x27;s policies and his future presidential administration. However, he left the Democrats in 1836 and was a Whig candidate in that year&#x27;s presidential election.

An ardent strict constructionist and lifelong states&#x27; rights advocate, White was one of President Jackson&#x27;s most trusted allies in Congress in the late 1820s and early 1830s. White fought against the national bank, tariffs, and the use of federal funds for internal improvements, and led efforts in the Senate to pass the Indian Removal Act of 1830. In 1833, at the height of the Nullification Crisis, White, as the Senate&#x27;s president pro tempore, coordinated negotiations over the Tariff of 1833.

Suspicious of the growing power of the presidency, White began to distance himself from Jackson in the mid-1830s, and realigned himself with Henry Clay and the burgeoning Whig Party. He was eventually forced out of the Senate when Jackson&#x27;s allies, led by James K. Polk, gained control of the Tennessee state legislature and demanded his resignation.

==Biography==

===Early life===

White was born in what is now Iredell County, North Carolina (but then part of Rowan County), the eldest son of James White and Mary Lawson White. James, a Revolutionary War veteran, moved his family to the Tennessee frontier in the 1780s, and played an active role in the failed State of Franklin. In 1786, he constructed White&#x27;s Fort, which would eventually develop into Knoxville, Tennessee. Young Hugh was a sentinel at the fort and helped manage its small gristmill. 
In 1791, White&#x27;s Fort was chosen as the capital of the newly created Southwest Territory, and James White&#x27;s friend, William Blount, was appointed governor of the territory. Hugh Lawson White worked as Blount&#x27;s personal secretary, and was tutored by early Knoxville minister and educator, Samuel Carrick. In 1793, he fought in the territorial militia under John Sevier during the Cherokee–American wars. Historian J. G. M. Ramsey credited Hugh Lawson White&#x27;s company with the killing of the Chickamauga Cherokee war chief, King Fisher, and White&#x27;s granddaughter and biographer, Nancy Scott, stated that White fired the fatal shot.

White studied law in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, under James Hopkins, and was admitted to the bar in 1796. Two years later, he married Elizabeth Carrick, the daughter of his mentor, Samuel.

===The judiciary and early political career===

In 1801, White was appointed judge of the Superior Court of Tennessee, then the state&#x27;s highest court. In 1807, he resigned after being elected to the state legislature. He left the state legislature in 1809, following his appointment to the state&#x27;s Court of Errors and Appeals (which replaced the Superior Court as the highest court). He resigned this position in 1815 when he was elected to the state senate. He served in the state senate until 1817. As a state legislator, White helped reform the state&#x27;s land laws, and engineered the passage of an anti-dueling measure.

In 1812, White was named president of the Knoxville branch of the Bank of Tennessee. White was described as a very cautious banker, and his bank was one of the few in the state to survive the Panic of 1819.

In 1821, President James Monroe appointed White to a commission to settle claims against Spain, following the Adams-Onís Treaty in which that nation sold Florida to the United States.

===United States Senate===

In 1825, the Tennessee state legislature chose White to replace Andrew Jackson in the United States Senate (Jackson had resigned following his failed run for the presidency in 1824). White spearheaded the Southern states&#x27; opposition to sending delegates to 1826 Congress of Panama, which was a general gathering of various nations in the Western Hemisphere, many of which had declared their independence from Spain and abolished slavery. White argued that if the U.S. attended the congress, it would violate the commitment to neutrality put forth by President Washington decades earlier, and stated that the nation should not get involved in foreign treaties merely for the sake of &quot;gratifying national vanity.&quot;

Following Jackson&#x27;s election to the presidency in 1828, White became one of the Jackson Administration&#x27;s key congressional allies. White was chairman of the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs, which drew up the Indian Removal Act of 1830, a major initiative of Jackson. The act called for the relocation of the remaining Native American tribes in the southeastern United States to territories west of the Mississippi River and would culminate in the so-called Trail of Tears.

In an 1836 speech, White described himself as a &quot;strict constructionist,&quot; arguing that the federal government could not pass any laws outside its powers specifically stated in the Constitution. Like many Jacksonians, he was a staunch states&#x27; rights, advocate. He opposed the national bank, and rejected federal funding for internal improvements (which he believed only the states had the power to fund). He also supported Jackson&#x27;s call for the elimination of the Electoral College. A slaveowner himself, he and opposed federal intervention into the issue of slavery.

Like most Southern senators, White opposed the Tariff of 1828, which placed a high tax on goods imported from overseas to protect growing northern industries. White argued that while the federal government had the power to impose tariffs, it should only do so when it benefited the nation as a whole, and not merely one section (i.e., the North) at the expense of another (i.e., the agrarian South, which relied on trade with England). During the resulting Nullification Crisis in late 1832 and early 1833, as the Senate&#x27;s president pro tempore (presiding officer of the Senate in the absence of the Vice President), White coordinated negotiations in the interim between the resignation of Vice President John C. Calhoun (December 28, 1832) and the swearing in of Vice President Martin Van Buren (March 4, 1833). Vice President Calhoun&#x27;s resignation put White next in line to assume the presidency.

===1836 presidential election===

Toward the end of Jackson&#x27;s first term, a rift developed between White and Jackson. In 1831, as Jackson reshuffled his cabinet in the aftermath of the Petticoat affair, White was offered the office of Secretary of War but turned it down. During the Nullification Crisis in February 1833, White angered Jackson by appointing Delaware senator and Clay ally John M. Clayton to the select committee to consider the Clay compromise. In later speeches, White stated that the Jackson Administration had drifted away from the party&#x27;s core states&#x27; rights principles, and argued that the executive was gaining too much power.

At the end of Jackson&#x27;s second term, the Tennessee state legislature endorsed White for the presidency in 1835. This angered Jackson, as he had chosen Martin Van Buren as his successor. White stated that no sitting president should choose a successor, arguing that doing so was akin to having a monarchy. In 1836, White left Jackson&#x27;s party entirely, and decided to run for president as a candidate for the Whig Party led by Henry Clay, which had mainly formed from opposition to Jackson but also continued the nationalist agenda of the National Republican Party, although this very contradicting position in regard to White&#x27;s ideals was not yet determined at that time, as the party was still regionally factionalized.

In the 1836 presidential election, the Whig Party, unable to agree on a candidate, ran four candidates against Van Buren: White, William Henry Harrison, Daniel Webster, and Willie Person Mangum. Jackson actively campaigned against White in Tennessee, and accused him of being a federalist who was opposed to states&#x27; rights. In spite of this, White won Tennessee, as well as Georgia, giving him 26 electoral votes, the third highest total behind Van Buren&#x27;s 170 and Harrison&#x27;s 73.

===Later career===

By 1837, the relationship between White and Jackson had turned hostile. Jackson was outraged when he learned that White had accused his administration of committing outright fraud, and stated in a letter to Adam Huntsman that White had a &quot;lax code of morals.&quot; Jackson&#x27;s allies such as James K. Polk, Felix Grundy, and John Catron, also turned against White and blamed him for the dispute with Jackson. White stood by his accusations and blasted Jackson for making &quot;useless expenditures&quot; of public money, and increasing the power of the presidency.

By the late 1830s, Jackson&#x27;s allies had gained control of the Tennessee state legislature. After White refused their demand that he vote for the Subtreasury Bill, he was forced to resign on January 13, 1840. Following a large banquet in Washington, White returned to his native Knoxville. His entry into the city was marked by the firing of cannons and the ringing of church bells, as he paraded through the streets on horseback.

Shortly after his return, White fell ill, and he died on April 10, 1840. A large funeral procession led his casket and riderless horse through the streets of Knoxville. He is interred with his family in the First Presbyterian Church Cemetery.

==Personality and style==

White believed strongly in the principles of strict constructionism and a limited federal government and voted against fellow Jacksonians if he felt their initiatives ran counter to these principles. His independent nature and his stern rectitude earned him the appellation &quot;The Cato of the United States.&quot; His congressional colleague, Henry Wise, later wrote that White&#x27;s &quot;patriotism and firmness&quot; as the Senate&#x27;s president pro tempore was key to resolving the Nullification Crisis.

White believed that being on the public payroll obligated him to attend every Senate meeting, no matter the issue.  Felix Grundy recalled that White once departed Knoxville in the middle of a driving snowstorm to ensure he made it to Washington in time for the Senate&#x27;s fall session. Senator John Milton Niles later wrote that White was often &quot;the only listener to a dull speech.&quot; White prided himself on being the most punctual member of the Senate and was usually the first senator to arrive at the Capitol on days when the Senate was in session. Senator Ephraim H. Foster once told a story about waking up well before sunrise one morning, determined to beat White to the Capitol at least once in his career, and arriving only to find White in the committee room analyzing some papers.

==Family and legacy==

White&#x27;s father, James White (1747–1820), was the founder of Knoxville, Tennessee. His brothers-in-law included surveyor Charles McClung (1761–1835), who platted Knoxville in 1791, Judge John Overton (1766–1833), the co-founder of Memphis, Tennessee, and Senator John Williams (1778–1837). White and his first wife, Elizabeth Carrick, had 12 children, two of whom died in infancy. Between 1825 and 1831, eight of their surviving ten children died of tuberculosis. Their lone surviving son, Samuel (1825–1860), served as mayor of Knoxville in 1857.

White&#x27;s farm lay just west of Second Creek in Knoxville. In the late 19th century, this became a land development area known as &quot;White&#x27;s Addition.&quot; The area is now part of the University of Tennessee campus and the Fort Sanders neighborhood. White County, Arkansas was also named in his honor.

<text>Hickory is a common name for trees composing the genus Carya, which includes 19 species accepted by &quot;Plants of the World Online&quot;.

Seven species are native to southeast Asia in China, Indochina, and northeastern India (Assam), and twelve are native to North America. A number of hickory species are used for their edible nuts or for their wood.

==Etymology==
The name &quot;hickory&quot; derives from a Native American word in an Algonquian language (perhaps Powhatan). It is a shortening of &quot;pockerchicory&quot;, &quot;pocohicora&quot;, or a similar word, which may be the name for the hickory tree&#x27;s nut, or may be a milky drink made from such nuts. The genus name &quot;Carya&quot; is , &quot;káryon&quot;, meaning &quot;nut&quot;.

==Description==
Hickories are temperate to subtropical forest trees with pinnately compound leaves and large nuts. Most are deciduous, but one species (&quot;C. sinensis&quot;, syn. &quot;Annamocarya sinensis&quot;) in southeast Asia is evergreen.

Hickory flowers are small, yellow-green catkins produced in spring. They are wind-pollinated and self-incompatible. The fruit is a globose or oval nut, long and diameter, enclosed in a four-valved husk, which splits open at maturity. The nut shell is thick and bony in most species, but thin in a few, notably the pecan (&quot;C. illinoinensis&quot;); it is divided into two halves, which split apart when the seed germinates.

Some fruit are borderline and difficult to categorize. Hickory (&quot;Carya&quot;) nuts and walnut (&quot;Juglans&quot;) nuts, both in the family Juglandaceae, grow within an outer husk; these fruit are sometimes considered to be drupes or drupaceous nuts, rather than true botanical nuts. &quot;Tryma&quot; is a specialized term for such nut-like drupes. The Angiosperm Phylogeny Group, however, considers the fruit to be a nut.

==Taxonomy==

=== Phylogeny ===
The oldest fossils attributed to &quot;Carya&quot; are Cretaceous pollen grains from Mexico and New Mexico. Fossil and molecular data suggest the genus &quot;Carya&quot; may have diversified during the Miocene. Modern &quot;Carya&quot; first appear in Oligocene strata 34 million years ago. Recent discoveries of &quot;Carya&quot; fruit fossils further support the hypothesis that the genus has long been a member of Eastern North American landscapes, however its range has contracted and Carya is no longer extant west of the Rocky Mountains.

Fossils of early hickory nuts show simpler, thinner shells than modern species with the exception of pecans, suggesting that the trees gradually developed defenses to rodent seed predation. During this time, the genus had a distribution across the Northern Hemisphere, but the Pleistocene Ice Age beginning 2 million years ago obliterated it from Europe. In Anatolia, the genus appears to have disappeared only in the early Holocene, probably related to human disturbance. The distribution of &quot;Carya&quot; in North America also contracted and it completely disappeared from the continent west of the Rocky Mountains. It is likely that the genus originated in North America, and later spread to Europe and Asia.

=== Subdivision ===
The genus &quot;Carya&quot; (not to be confused with &quot;Careya&quot; in the Lecythidaceae) is in the walnut family, Juglandaceae. In the APG system, this family is included in the order Fagales. Several species are known to hybridize, with around nine accepted, named hybrids.

==== Asian hickories ====
Carya&quot; sect. &quot;Sinocarya

*&quot;Carya dabieshanensis&quot; – Dabie Shan hickory (may be synonymous with &quot;C. cathayensis&quot;)
*&quot;Carya cathayensis&quot; – Chinese hickory
*&quot;Carya hunanensis&quot; – Hunan hickory
*&quot;Carya kweichowensis&quot; – Guizhou hickory
*&quot;Carya poilanei&quot; – Poilane&#x27;s hickory
*&quot;Carya sinensis&quot; – Beaked hickory
*&quot;Carya tonkinensis&quot; – Vietnamese hickory

&quot;C. sinensis&quot; has sometimes been split out in a separate genus as &quot;Annamocarya sinensis&quot;, but not by &quot;Plants of the World Online&quot;, as genetic data support it being embedded within the other Asian &quot;Carya&quot;.

==== North American hickories ====
Carya&quot; sect. &quot;Carya – typical hickories

*&quot;Carya floridana&quot; – scrub hickory
*&quot;Carya glabra&quot; – pignut hickory, pignut, sweet pignut, coast pignut hickory, smoothbark hickory, swamp hickory, broom hickory
*&quot;Carya laciniosa&quot; – shellbark hickory, shagbark hickory, bigleaf shagbark hickory, kingnut, big shellbark, bottom shellbark, thick shellbark, western shellbark
*&quot;Carya myristiciformis&quot; – nutmeg hickory, swamp hickory, bitter water hickory
*&quot;Carya ovalis&quot; – red hickory, spicebark hickory, sweet pignut hickory (treated as a variety of &quot;C. glabra&quot; by &quot;Flora N. Amer.&quot; and &quot;Plants of the World Online&quot;)
*&quot;Carya ovata&quot; – shagbark hickory
**&quot;C. o.&quot; var. &quot;ovata&quot; – northern shagbark hickory
**&quot;C. o.&quot; var. &quot;australis&quot; – southern shagbark hickory, Carolina hickory (syn. &quot;C. carolinae-septentrionalis&quot;)
*&quot;Carya pallida&quot; – sand hickory
*&quot;Carya texana&quot; – black hickory
*&quot;Carya tomentosa&quot; – mockernut hickory (syn. &quot;C. alba&quot;)
*†&quot;Carya washingtonensis&quot; – Miocene of Kittitas County, Washington
Carya&quot; sect. &quot;Apocarya – pecans

*&quot;Carya aquatica&quot; – bitter pecan or water hickory
*&quot;Carya cordiformis&quot; – bitternut hickory
*&quot;Carya illinoinensis&quot; – pecan
*&quot;Carya palmeri&quot; – Mexican hickory

== Distribution and habitat ==
Seven species are native to southeast Asia in China, Indochina, and northeastern India (Assam), and twelve are native to North America, of which eleven occur in the United States, four in Mexico (of which one, &quot;C. palmeri&quot;, endemic there), and five extending into southern Canada.

== Ecology ==
Hickory is used as a food plant by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species. These include:
* Luna moth (&quot;Actias luna&quot;)
* Brown-tail moth (&quot;Euproctis chrysorrhoea&quot;)
* &quot;Coleophora&quot; case-bearers, &quot;C. laticornella&quot; and &quot;C. ostryae&quot;
* Regal moths (&quot;Citheronia regalis&quot;), whose caterpillars are known as hickory horn-devils
* Walnut sphinx (&quot;Amorpha juglandis&quot;)
* The bride (nominate subspecies &quot;Catocala neogama neogama&quot;)
* Hickory tussock moth (&quot;Lophocampa caryae&quot;)

The hickory leaf stem gall phylloxera (&quot;Phylloxera caryaecaulis&quot;) also uses the hickory tree as a food source. Phylloxeridae are related to aphids and have a similarly complex life cycle. Eggs hatch in early spring and the galls quickly form around the developing insects. &quot;Phylloxera&quot; galls may damage weakened or stressed hickories, but are generally harmless. Deformed leaves and twigs can rain down from the tree in the spring as squirrels break off infected tissue and eat the galls, possibly for the protein content or because the galls are fleshy and tasty to the squirrels. The pecan gall curculio (&quot;Conotrachelus elegans&quot;) is a true weevil species also found feeding on galls of the hickory leaf stem gall phylloxera.

The banded hickory borer (&quot;Knulliana cincta&quot;) is also found on hickories.

==Uses==
===Nutrition===
Dried hickory nuts are 3% water, 18% carbohydrates, 13% protein, and 64% fats. In a 100 gram (3.5 oz) reference amount, dried hickory nuts supply 657 calories, and are a rich source (20% or more of the Daily Value, DV) of several B vitamins and dietary minerals, especially manganese at 220% DV.

=== Culinary ===
An extract from shagbark hickory bark is used in an edible syrup similar to maple syrup, with a slightly bitter, smoky taste. The Cherokee people would produce a green dye from hickory bark, which they used to dye cloth. When this bark was mixed with maple bark, it produced a yellow dye pigment. The ashes of burnt hickory wood were traditionally used to produce a strong lye (potash) fit for soapmaking.

The nuts of some species are palatable, while others are bitter and only suitable for animal feed. Hickory nuts were a significant food source for indigenous peoples of the Eastern Woodlands of North America since the middle Archaic period. They were used by the Cherokee in Kanuchi soup, but more often edible oil would be extracted through crushing the nuts and then either straining or boiling the remains. Shagbark and shellbark hickory, along with pecan, are regarded by some as the finest nut trees. Pecans are the most important nut tree native to North America.

When cultivated for their nuts, clonal (grafted) trees of the same cultivar cannot pollinate each other because of their self-incompatibility. Two or more cultivars must be planted together for successful pollination. Seedlings (grown from hickory nuts) will usually have sufficient genetic variation.

=== Wood ===

Hickory wood is hard, stiff, dense and shock resistant. There are woods stronger than hickory and woods that are harder, but the combination of strength, toughness, hardness, and stiffness found in hickory wood is not found in any other commercial wood. Hickory is therefore used in a number of items requiring these properties, such as tool handles, bows, wheel spokes, walking sticks, drumsticks and wood flooring. Baseball bats were formerly made of hickory, but are now more commonly made of ash; however, it is replacing ash as the wood of choice for Scottish shinty sticks. Traditional lacrosse sticks are made out of hickory, however since the 1970s lacrosse sticks have switched to plastic heads on metal shafts. Hickory was also extensively used for the construction of early aircraft.

Due to its grain structure, hickory is more susceptible to moisture absorption than other species of wood, and is therefore more prone to shrinkage, warping or swelling with changes in humidity.

Hickory is also highly prized for wood-burning stoves and chimineas, as its density and high energy content make it an efficient fuel. Hickory wood is also a preferred type for smoking cured meats. In the Southern United States, hickory is popular for cooking barbecue, as hickory grows abundantly in the region and adds flavor to the meat.

<text>Beach Flags is a sporting event used by Surf lifesavers to practice beach sprinting and reflexes.

The game is played by sticking a series of &quot;flags&quot; (typically short lengths of hosepipe) into the sand in a row. The competitors lie facing away (and face down) approximately 20 metres away. Upon a starting signal, the competitors race to the flags and try to grab one. The difficulty in the sport is that &quot;there are always fewer flags than there are competitors&quot;. The competitors who do not manage to capture a flag are eliminated, the flags are reset (removing one more), and the game continues until there is one person remaining - the winner. The game progresses in much the same way as musical chairs. Competitors are also eliminated if they commit a starting infringement by moving between the &quot;heads down heads up&quot; and starting signal usually a horn or just someone yelling go. British team member and beach sprint specialist Jo Devine calls the sport “great fun for all” 

The event involves a tactical component as competitors have discretion as to which flag they obtain. While there is a degree of jostling, a competitor can be disqualified for deliberately impeding another competitor. 
Rather than testing endurance and stamina, the event tests power and reflexes. A round run by Open Australian national finalists will take approximately 3.7 seconds.

<doc id="360984" wikidata="Q2063360" url="?curid=360984" title="Rescue of Jessica McClure">
<text>Jessica McClure Morales (born March 26, 1986; widely known as &quot;Baby Jessica&quot; in 1987) fell into a well in her aunt&#x27;s backyard in Midland, Texas, on October 14, 1987, at the age of 18 months.

Over the next 56 hours, rescuers worked to free her from the well casing, about below grade.

The story garnered worldwide attention. A 1989 ABC television movie was made about the events: &quot;Everybody&#x27;s Baby: The Rescue of Jessica McClure&quot;.

== Rescue ==
The incident occurred in Midland, Texas, where firemen and police developed a plan to drill a parallel shaft to the well where Jessica was lodged—and drill another horizontal cross-tunnel to rescue her. Enlisting the help of local oil drillers, officials hoped to free McClure quickly. But they then discovered that the well was surrounded by rock. The rescuers&#x27; jackhammers were also inadequate, as they were designed for downward rather than horizontal drilling.

A mining engineer eventually arrived to help supervise and coordinate the rescue effort, and a relatively new technology, waterjet cutting, was ultimately used to cut through the rock.

Forty-five hours after Jessica fell into the well, the adjacent shaft and cross-tunnel were complete. During the drilling, rescuers could hear Jessica singing &quot;Winnie the Pooh.&quot;

A roofing contractor, Ron Short, volunteered to go down the shaft. He had been born without collarbones and could collapse his shoulders to work in tight confines. The team considered his offer, but ultimately EMT/paramedic Robert O&#x27;Donnell was the one who descended the shaft, inching his way into the tunnel and wresting Jessica free from her position pinned inside the well with one leg above her forehead. O&#x27;Donnell then returned with Jessica to the parallel shaft, handing her off to fellow EMT Steve Forbes, who carried her up to safety before giving her to another firefighter who carried her to a waiting ambulance.

== Media coverage ==
CNN covered the rescue effort.

Then-President Ronald Reagan said, &quot;Everybody in America became godmothers and godfathers of Jessica while this was going on.&quot;

Throughout the incident, local media outlet KMID-TV received calls from news organizations and private individuals globally, seeking the latest information.

In 1988, McClure and her parents appeared on &quot;Live with Regis and Kathie Lee&quot; to talk about the incident.

A photograph of McClure&#x27;s rescue by Scott Shaw of the &quot;Odessa American&quot; received the 1988 Pulitzer Prize for Spot News Photography.

ABC made a television movie of the story in 1989, &quot;Everybody&#x27;s Baby: The Rescue of Jessica McClure&quot;, starring Beau Bridges and Patty Duke and featuring many participants from the actual rescue as extras.

On May 30, 2007, &quot;USA Today&quot; ranked McClure number 22 on its list of &quot;25 lives of indelible impact&quot;.

== Aftermath ==

Following McClure&#x27;s rescue on October 16, 1987, doctors feared they would have to amputate Jessica&#x27;s foot due to damage from loss of blood flow sustained from her leg being elevated above her head for the 58 and a half hours she was stuck in the well. They decided to try hyperbaric therapy in an attempt to avoid full amputation. In the end, surgeons only had to amputate a toe due to gangrene caused by loss of circulation while she was in the well. Jessica carries a scar on her forehead where her head rubbed against the well casing and, despite the incident and 15 subsequent related surgeries, retains no first-hand memory of the events. Her parents divorced in 1990.

Paramedic Robert O&#x27;Donnell (August 27, 1957 – April 27, 1995) developed post-traumatic stress disorder after the rescue and later struggled to cope with the abrupt decline in recognition/fame that he had experienced in the immediate aftermath of his heroic act. He died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound.

In May 2004, McClure graduated from Greenwood High School, in a small community near Midland. On January 28, 2006, she married Daniel Morales at the Church of Christ in Notrees, Texas, about from Midland. They met at a day care center where she worked with his sister. They have two children, a son born in 2007 and a daughter born in 2009.

When McClure turned 25 on March 26, 2011, she received a trust fund, composed of donations from around the world, which she discussed using for her children&#x27;s college and which she used to purchase her home, less than from the well into which she fell. However, she also indicated that a great deal of the fund was lost in the 2008 stock market crash.

== In popular culture ==
* On March 11, 1988, only 5 months after the rescue of Jessica McClure, in Season 2, Episode 16 of &quot;It&#x27;s Garry Shandling&#x27;s Show&quot;, the show starts with the opening credits playing more than once because Garry Shandling can&#x27;t be found, and it turns out he fell into a hole in his backyard and needed to be rescued. The episode is titled &quot;Garry Falls Down a Hole&quot;.
* &quot;Malootty&quot;, the 1990 Indian Malayalam-language movie starring Jayaram, was based on the incident.
* &quot;The Simpsons&quot; referenced the incident with an episode about Bart Simpson falling and becoming stuck inside a well.
*Gary Larson&#x27;s &quot;The Far Side&quot; drawing dated 15 May 1992 shows &quot;The life and times of Baby Jessica&quot; with a sequence of unfortunate events starting with being stuck in a vertical pipe shaft; however she is fully upright.
* In &quot;Scary Movie 3&quot;, during a scene which parodies events from &quot;The Ring&quot; (2002), the character Brenda references the rescue when she exclaims, &quot;Cindy the news is on! Another little white girl done fell down a well&quot;. She then proceeds to mock the national attention brought to the event when she complains that &quot;50 black people get their asses beat by the police every day, but the whole world gotta stop for one little whitey down the hole&quot;.
* In the first episode of the fourth season of &quot;Everybody Hates Chris&quot; titled &quot;Everybody Hates Tattaglia&quot; (2008), Chris (Tyler James Williams) says to his best friend Greg (Vincent Martella), &quot;All the white people think I look like every black person on Earth. I could go to jail for anything from a parking ticket to throwing little baby Jessica down the well.&quot; Being that the season takes place starting in 1986, and that event did not occur until 1987, Greg replies (breaking the fourth wall) by saying, &quot;Dude, that didn&#x27;t even happen yet.&quot;
* In 2010, blues musician Charlie Musselwhite released an album titled &quot;The Well&quot;. In the title song, he credits McClure&#x27;s ordeal for inspiring him to quit drinking.
* In 2010, her story was featured satirically in the &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; sketch &quot;What Up With That.&quot;
* In 2012, an episode of &quot;American Dad!&quot; titled &quot;National Treasure 4: Baby Franny: She&#x27;s Doing Well: The Hole Story&quot; referenced the incident. Francine Smith (Wendy Schaal) begins to feel guilty over wasting her life while the fireman who rescued her (Guest Star: Will Forte) from a well 35 years ago died in her place; but as it turns out, the fireman had been living in the well for the duration.
* In 2017, an episode of ABC&#x27;s &quot;Modern Family&quot;, titled &quot;Heavy Is the Head&quot;, Cam (Eric Stonestreet) has great difficulty getting an MRI scan. He later attributes his fear to being stuck in a well as a teenager on the same day as Baby Jessica.
* In 2019, an episode of NBC&#x27;s A.P. Bio entitled &quot;Dr. Whoopsie&quot; has Jack (Glenn Howerton) asking the class for ideas to &quot;take over the airwaves&quot;. Jack wants to look the hero after a clumsy video of him goes viral. Baby Jessica is suggested, and they stage a sewer rescue by having a student go down a manhole.

<text>Joanna Cole (August 11, 1944July 12, 2020) was an American author of children&#x27;s books, best known as the author of the &quot;Magic School Bus&quot; series, which sold more than 93 million copies in 13 countries. She wrote more than 250 books, ranging from her first book &quot;Cockroaches&quot; to her famous series &quot;Magic School Bus&quot;, which is illustrated by Bruce Degen.

==Early life==
Cole was born in Newark, New Jersey, the daughter of Elizabeth (Reid), a homemaker, and Mario Basilea, a house painter. She grew up in the suburb East Orange. She loved science as a child, and had a teacher that she says acted a little like Ms. Frizzle, but that she did not resemble her physically because her teacher looked &quot;very conservative&quot;. Her teacher let students check out one of her science books each week and Cole stated, &quot;I thought that reading science books for pleasure was an ordinary thing&quot;. As a child, she studied insects and plants in her backyard. Cole enjoyed school and also enjoyed writing science reports for class. Her favorite book as a child was titled &quot;Bugs, Insects and Such&quot; which was a gift from her aunt because Cole liked to watch insects in her backyard.

In 1965, she married Philip A. Cole. She attended the University of Massachusetts and Indiana University before graduating from the City College of New York in 1967 with a B.A. in psychology.

==Career==
After some graduate education courses, she became a librarian in a Brooklyn elementary school. Cole subsequently became a letters correspondent at &quot;Newsweek&quot;, then associate editor for the SeeSaw book club at Scholastic, and then a senior editor for Doubleday Books for Young Readers. She went freelance in 1980, writing children&#x27;s books and articles for &quot;Parents&quot; magazine. Her first children&#x27;s book was about cockroaches and it was published in 1971. Cole decided to write &quot;Cockroaches&quot; because there was not a book written about the insect at the time. She decided to write children&#x27;s books full-time in 1980. Two of her books were written for parents to read with their children, with the titles being &quot;How You Were Born&quot; (1984) and &quot;Your New Potty&quot; (1989). Cole always kept the emotional level of her readers in mind when writing children&#x27;s books. She stated that it is a privilege to have a career doing what she enjoyed as a child.

===&quot;The Magic School Bus&quot;===
The first &quot;Magic School Bus&quot; book was written in 1985 and published the following year. She and illustrator Bruce Degen spent over a year per book when they worked on the first 10 titles. Cole was nervous about starting the first &quot;Magic School Bus&quot; book, stating, &quot;I couldn&#x27;t work at all. I cleaned out closets, answered letters, and went shopping—anything but sit down and write. But eventually I did it, even though I was scared&quot;. She also said that she wanted to write science books that told stories which readers would enjoy even with no science aspect.

When writing a &quot;Magic School Bus&quot; book Cole wrote the text first, then she and Degen went over each page. She also wrote more words on removable tape which she placed over those she had previously written. If she did not like something she had written, she figured that she might like what was on the tape instead.

&quot;The Magic School Bus&quot; has enjoyed continued success and has sold millions of copies in multiple languages. The most recent installment in the series is &quot;The Magic School Bus Explores Human Evolution&quot; (2020). Cole said that her favorite &quot;The Magic School Bus&quot; book is &quot;Inside the Earth&quot;, in which the character Arnold confuses a piece of Styrofoam with dirt on it as a rock and brings it to class, similar to an incident involving Cole&#x27;s daughter.

The book series was adapted into an animated TV show starring the voice of Lily Tomlin (as &quot;Ms. Frizzle&quot;), which ran for 3 years beginning in 1994. In 2017, the books were adapted for a Netflix series starring the voice of Kate McKinnon (as &quot;Fiona Felicity Frizzle&quot;), titled &quot;The Magic School Bus Rides Again&quot;.

The video game series was published for several other hardware platforms in 1994 until 2010.

==Reception==
Most of Cole&#x27;s books became ALA Notables and received NSTA/CBC Non-fiction Awards. Cole received the &quot;Washington Post&quot;/Children&#x27;s Book Guild for her non-fiction children&#x27;s books in 1971. Her books &quot;A Cat&#x27;s Body&quot; and &quot;A Bird&#x27;s Body&quot; were selections for the Junior Literary Guild.

A 1988 review in &quot;The New York Times&quot; of &quot;The Magic School Bus Inside the Earth&quot; (second book in the series) said:
The author Joanna Cole and the illustrator Bruce Degen have come up with the freshest, most amusing approach to science for children that I&#x27;ve seen...Elementary school science should never be the same again after the &quot;Magic School Bus&quot; series is completed.

An author spotlight in the book &quot;Valerie &amp; Walter&#x27;s Best Books for Children 2nd Ed: A Lively, Opinionated Guide&quot; stated, &quot;If Joanna Cole had contributed nothing to the world of children&#x27;s books other than her &quot;Magic School Bus&quot; books, her popularity would still be assured&quot;.

However, Cole&#x27;s &quot;Asking About Sex and Growing Up&quot; was named the 57th most challenged book from 1990 to 1999.

==Death==
Cole died on July 12, 2020, aged 75, of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Her frequent collaborator Stephanie Calmenson wrote a tribute that states: &quot;Losing Joanna, we lose the chance to share Ms. Frizzle’s latest science adventure with children, making them laugh and helping them better understand the world they live in.&quot; Until her death, Cole continued to write books on many subjects for a range of ages, and collaborated on many books with Calmenson, including the &quot;Ready, Set, Dogs!&quot; series and &quot;The Adventures of Allie and Amy&quot; series.

The three 2020 specials of The Magic School Bus Rides Again, &quot;Kids in Space&quot;, &quot;The Frizz Connection&quot; and &quot;In the Zone&quot; were all dedicated to her memory.

<text>Huatusco de Chicuellar (commonly known as Huatusco), is a city in the Mexican state of Veracruz, on the Xalapa–Mexico City railroad that was founded by Italian immigrants. It is bordered by Calcahualco, the state of Puebla, Ixhuatlán del Café and Federal Highway 180.

The oldest church in Huatusco is dedicated to San Antonio de Padua with a height of approximately 20 meters. A nearby hill, called &quot;Cerro de Guadalupe&quot; has a church on top of it, where every year on December 11 and 12 Catholic people hold religious festivities. In these days, the priest celebrates with a mass, and after that, people stay around the hill to have a picnic.

Economic activities in Huatusco include growing coffee, sugar cane and several fruits.

Huatusco is a small quiet town during the week. Important geographical features in the vicinity include Cerro de ecatepec, Cerro de Elotepec, and the Sierra Madre Oriental; the highest mountain in Mexico, Pico de Orizaba is also visible from the town. Huatusco is sometimes called the city of pianos (&quot;La Ciudad de los Pianos&quot;), because having a piano and playing it used to be common within the city.

The suffix of Huatusco, &quot;de Chicuellar&quot; allegedly comes from a story where a man wanted to buy the town to industrialize it, but a poor farmer named Chicuellar paid a large amount of money to prevent that from happening.
From 1902 to 1953, Huatusco was served by the Córdoba and Huatusco Railroad narrow gauge railroad.

Manuel Chacón, commander of the municipal police department, was assassinated in May 2020.

<doc id="361000" wikidata="Q4448417" url="?curid=361000" title="Sandy Hill, Ottawa">
<text>Sandy Hill () is a neighbourhood in Ottawa, Ontario, located just east of downtown. The neighbourhood is bordered on the west by the Rideau Canal, and on the east by the Rideau River. To the north it stretches to Rideau Street and the Byward Market area while to the south it is bordered by the Queensway highway and Nicholas Street. The area is named for its hilliness, caused by the river, and its sandy soil, which makes it difficult to erect large buildings. It is home to a number of embassies, residences and parks. Le Cordon Bleu operates its Canadian school there, at the opposite end of Sandy Hill from the University of Ottawa.

According to the 2011 Canadian Census, the population of Sandy Hill was 12,490.

==History==

Sandy Hill was, during the nineteenth and early twentieth century, Ottawa&#x27;s wealthiest neighbourhood. Originally the estate of Louis-Théodore Besserer,
who donated part of this land to University of Ottawa, it was subdivided and
became home to most of Ottawa&#x27;s lumber barons. When Ottawa became the country&#x27;s capital, it became home to senior public servants and to the Prime Minister who lived at Stadacona Hall and later at what is now known as Laurier House.

The construction of bridges over the canal and the introduction of automobiles and streetcars made the area much more accessible to downtown, and it began to decline as the very wealthy moved to Rockcliffe Park. The neighbourhood became much denser and more middle class. It was predominantly francophone, and the 1960s Radio-Canada television network drama &quot;La Côte de Sable&quot; was set there, to this day one of the network&#x27;s only drama set outside Quebec.

The area saw much growth at the end of the Second World War as the baby boom increased the population and the nearby federal government began hiring. Many of the once grand mansions became embassies. Many nations still have their embassies in Sandy Hill, including those of Russia and of many African nations, which are clustered near the Rideau River. Its population dropped by 30% in the &#x27;60s and &#x27;70s as families fled the dismal urban planning. Currently, there are many students living in the area due to its proximity to the University of Ottawa.

==Geography==

Unusual among modern urban neighbourhoods, Sandy Hill demographics change dramatically within a few blocks. Very wealthy people live near the embassies of the Rideau River, but closer to the university, one finds more students, senior citizens, and new immigrants with more diversified income levels. Housing in the western end of Sandy Hill includes boarding houses, student rental housing, modest privately owned homes and cooperative housing. For example, on Henderson Avenue, a historically Irish working-class sector of Sandy Hill, there are two Housing Cooperatives: Sandy Hill Housing Co-op and St. Georges Housing Cooperative / la Coopérative d&#x27;habitation St Georges, a bilingual, multicultural coop, with residents who come from Canada, with neighbours newly arrived from Ghana, DR Congo, Morocco, Rwanda, Burundi, Poland and several Middle Eastern countries. These Coops not only provided attractive low-rise multi-housing mixed income communities but also contributed to the restoration of the heritage homes on this street and won awards for their contribution to Sandy Hill&#x27;s heritage restoration.

The Sandy Hill area is split about equally between the English speaking and the francophone population, with large communities from Somalia, Lebanon, and Haiti. The area is very close to downtown, especially to the Rideau Centre, a large downtown shopping mall. The area is well served by mass transit and O-Train Line 1 serves the University of Ottawa 

Sandy Hill is often divided into four areas. North Sandy Hill consists of the area north of Laurier Avenue. This part of the neighbourhood is much older with many of its buildings dating from the nineteenth century. The area is subject to the influences of more recent developments on the thoroughfare of Rideau Street. South of Laurier is South Sandy Hill largely built after the Second World War, though there are a number of much older structures. The far south of neighbourhood below Mann Avenue is an area known as Strathcona Heights. This area is much smaller geographically than the other two but is as densely populated. It consists almost entirely of low-rise apartment buildings that are either subsidised housing or co-operatives. This area was completely redeveloped in the early 1990s. The area below the Strathcona Heights escarpment, near the Rideau River, is known as Robinson village. It was cut off from other neighbourhoods when highways were built, and contains low-rise houses and light industrial uses.

*University of Ottawa
*Strathcona Park
*Heritage Canada, 5 Blackburn
*Amnesty International, Canadian headquarters
*Examination Unit, a secretive unit of the National Research Council (Canada) and later became Communications Security Establishment, was located at a house near Laurier House.

<text>Qin (, or &quot;Ch&#x27;in&quot;) was an ancient Chinese state during the Zhou dynasty. It is traditionally dated to 897 BC. The Qin state originated from a reconquest of western lands that had previously been lost to the Xirong. Its location at the western edge of Chinese civilisation allowed for expansion and development that was not available to its rivals in the North China Plain.

After extensive reform during the 4th century BC, Qin emerged as one of the dominant powers among the Seven Warring States. It unified the seven states of China in 221 BC under Qin Shi Huang. This unification established the Qin dynasty, which, despite its short duration, had a significant influence on later Chinese history. Accordingly, the Qin state before the Qin dynasty was established is also referred to as the &quot;predynastic Qin&quot; or &quot;proto-Qin&quot;.

==History==
===Founding===

According to the 2nd-century BC &quot;Records of the Grand Historian&quot; by Sima Qian, the Qin state traced its origin to Zhuanxu, one of the legendary Five Emperors in ancient times. One of his descendants, Boyi, was granted the family name of Ying by Emperor Shun. During the Xia and Shang dynasties, the Ying clan split into two: a western branch that migrated across the Ordos Plateau to Quanqiu ( &#x27;hill of the Quanrong&#x27;, modern Li County, Gansu), and an eastern branch that settled east of the Yellow River in modern Shanxi. The latter became the ancestors of the rulers of the later state of Zhao.

The western Ying clan at Quanqiu were lords over the Xichui (&#x27;western march&#x27;) region west of Mount Long and served as a buffer state for the Shang dynasty against invasions by the Xirong barbarians. One of them, Elai, was killed defending King Zhou of Shang during the rebellion led by Ji Fa that established the Zhou dynasty. The Ying clan was, however, allied with the politically influential marquesses of Shen, whom the Zhou monarch relied upon heavily to manage the Rong people and was thus allowed to retain their lands and continued serving as an attached vassal under the Zhou dynasty. Feizi, a younger son of Elai&#x27;s fourth-generation descendant Daluo, impressed King Xiao of Zhou so much with his horse breeding skills, that he was awarded a separate fief in the valley of Qin (modern Qingshui and Zhangjiachuan in Gansu) northeast of Quanqiu, and his seat was named Qinyi (秦邑 Qin&#x27;s hamlet) in today&#x27;s town of Qinting (秦亭). Both branches of the western Ying clan lived in the midst of the Rong tribes, sometimes fighting their armies and sometimes intermarrying with their kings.

Scholars such as Annette Juliano and Arthur Cotterel have suggested that having a horse-breeder as their ancestor may imply that the Ying family had a partial connection to nomadic tribes. As late as 266 BC, it was remarked by a noble of Wei that they shared customs with the Rong and Beidi tribes; the central plains states seemed to hold Qin culture and other peripheral states like Yan and Chu in low regard, due to the marginal location of their states. Qin was the second state after Zhao to adopt cavalry tactics from the nomads. Following the collapse of the Zhou dynasty, the Qin state absorbed cultures from two of the Four Barbarians from the west and north, which made the other warring states see their culture in low esteem. However, the Qin state was sensitive to the cultural discrimination by the Central Plains states and attempted to assert their Huaxia identity. In Qin law, mixed-ethnicity offspring were categorised as Huaxia, as well as in their preference for importing recruits from the neighbouring state of Jin.

In 842 BC, nobles revolted against the corrupt King Li of Zhou in a coup known as the &#x27;countrymen&#x27;s riot&#x27; (). They overthrew him the following year, leading the country into political turmoil. The Xirong tribes seized this opportunity to rebel against the Zhou dynasty, attacking and exterminating the senior branch of the Ying clan at Quanqiu. This left the cadet branch at Qinyi as the only surviving Ying clan in the west.

After King Xuan of Zhou ascended the throne in 827 BC, he appointed Qin Zhong, Feizi&#x27;s great-grandson, as the commander of his forces in the campaign against the Xirong. In 822 BC, Qin Zhong was killed in battle and succeeded by his eldest son, Duke Zhuang. To commemorate Qin Zhong&#x27;s loyalty, King Xuan summoned Duke Zhuang and his four younger brothers and gave them 7,000 soldiers. The Qin brothers successfully defeated the Rong and recovered their lost patrimony, formerly held by the deceased branch of the Ying clan. King Xuan formally awarded them the territory of Quanqiu. Duke Zhuang then moved his seat from Qinyi to Quanqiu and had three sons.

When Duke Zhuang died in 778 BC, his eldest son Shifu chose to continue fighting the Xirong and avenge their grandfather, turning down the succession. As a result, his second son, Duke Xiang, ascended as the clan leader. In 777 BC, Duke Xiang married his younger sister, Mu Ying, to a Rong leader named King Feng () in an apparent attempt to make peace. The following year, he moved the Qin capital eastward from Quanqiu to Qian (; modern Long County, Shaanxi). However, Quanqiu soon fell to the Rong again after he left. His older brother Shifu, who led the defense of Quanqiu, was captured by the Rong but was released a year later.

In 771 BC, the Marquess of Shen, in collaboration with the state of Zeng and the Quanrong nomads, attacked and sacked the Zhou capital Haojing, killing King You of Zhou and ending the Western Zhou. Duke Xiang led his troops to escort King You&#x27;s son, King Ping, to Luoyi (modern Luoyang), where the new capital city of the Eastern Zhou dynasty was established. In gratitude for Duke Xiang&#x27;s service, King Ping formally enfeoffed Duke Xiang as a feudal lord and elevated Qin from an &#x27;attached state&#x27; (, a minor state with limited self-rule under the authority of another liege-lord) to a major vassal state with full autonomy. He further promised to permanently grant Qin the lands west of Qishan, the former heartland of Zhou, if Qin could expel the Rong tribes that were occupying it. Encouraged by this promise, the following generations of Qin rulers launched several military campaigns against the Rong, eventually expanding their territories far beyond the original lands lost by the Western Zhou dynasty. The Qin state therefore viewed the Zhou rulers King Wen and Wu as their predecessors and themselves as the legitimate inheritors of their legacy.

===Spring and Autumn period===

During the Spring and Autumn period (722–481 BC), the Qin state&#x27;s interaction with other central Chinese states remained minimal due to their primary concern with the Rong to the west. The exception was their immediate eastern neighbor, Jin, a large vassal of the Zhou. Qin maintained diplomatic relations with Jin through intermarriages between the royal clans, but relations occasionally deteriorated to the point of armed conflict.

In the early reign of Duke Mu of Qin, the Jin state, under the leadership of Duke Xian of Jin, was a formidable power. However, after Duke Xian&#x27;s death, Jin descended into internal conflict as Duke Xian&#x27;s sons fought for succession. Duke Hui of Jin, one of the contenders, emerged victorious. However, Jin was struck by a famine in 647 BC, and Duke Hui requested aid from Qin. Duke Mu of Qin, married to Duke Hui&#x27;s half-sister, sent relief food supplies and agricultural equipment to Jin out of goodwill. However, when Qin experienced a famine the following year, Duke Hui did not reciprocate, leading to diplomatic deterioration and a war in 645 BC. The war ended with Duke Hui&#x27;s defeat and capture, but Duke Mu later released him after Jin agreed to cede land and form an alliance.

During the battles with Jin, Duke Mu learned that Chong&#x27;er, one of Duke Xian&#x27;s exiled sons, was taking refuge in the state of Chu. After consulting his subjects, Duke Mu sent an emissary to Chu to invite Chong&#x27;er and supported him in his challenge against his brother, Duke Hui. After Chong&#x27;er defeated Duke Hui to become Duke Wen of Jin, he expressed gratitude to Duke Mu, and relations between the two states improved. With stability on his eastern front, Duke Mu seized the opportunity to launch military campaigns against the Rong tribes in the west.
In 630 BC, Qin and Jin agreed to wage war on the state of Zheng, but Duke Mu was lobbied by the Zheng emissary to abandon the alliance. In 627 BC, Duke Mu planned a covert attack on Zheng, but the Qin army retreated after being deceived into believing that Zheng was already prepared for Qin&#x27;s invasion. By that point, Duke Wen had died and his personal alliance with Duke Mu no longer stood, and his successor Duke Xiang ordered an ambush for the retreating Qin army. The Qin forces were defeated at the Battle of Xiao (near modern Luoning County, Henan) and suffered heavy casualties, and all three of its generals were captured. Three years later, Qin attacked Jin for revenge and achieved a major victory. Duke Mu refused to advance further east after holding a memorial service for those killed in action at the Battle of Xiao and returned to focus on the traditional policy of expanding Qin&#x27;s dominance in the west. Duke Mu&#x27;s achievements in Qin&#x27;s western campaigns and his handling of foreign relations with Jin earned him a position among the Five Hegemons of the Spring and Autumn period.

In a speech pronounced on the eve of a major interstate conference of 546 BC, a Jin leader recognized Qin, along with Jin, Chu and Qi, as one of the four pivotal great powers of the current world.
In 506 BC, King Helü of Wu defeated Chu at the Battle of Boju and captured the Chu capital, Ying (modern Jingzhou). Helü&#x27;s adviser, Wu Zixu, who had previously been forced into exile by the already deceased King Ping of Chu and craved vengeance for the brutal execution of his father and brother, exhumed King Ping&#x27;s corpse and posthumously lashed it. This was a great humiliation for the Chu state. Consequently, Shen Baoxu, a Chu official and a former friend of Wu Zixu, travelled to the Qin court and pleaded for assistance from Duke Ai of Qin to recover the capital. After Duke Ai initially refused to help, Shen spent seven days crying in the palace courtyard. Duke Ai was eventually moved by his devotion and agreed to send troops to assist Chu. The famous poem, &quot;No Clothes&quot; (), recorded in the &quot;Classic of Poetry&quot;, was a battle hymn personally composed by Duke Ai to boost the morale of the Qin troops. In 505 BC, the Qin and Chu armies jointly defeated Wu in several battles, allowing King Zhao of Chu to be restored and return to the recaptured capital.

===Warring States Period===
====Early non-involvement====
Mozi (460–390 BC) did not list Qin among the powerful states. However, other scattered information of its military exploits indicates that Qin remained a powerful polity ever since Lord Mu. Its armies acted, even if infrequently, in the eastern and southeastern parts of the Chinese world, occasionally against great power Wu. Although not weak, the overall impact of Qin on the affairs of the Zhou world in the 5th and the early 4th century BC considerably diminished. Another research also finds that Qin was strong and explains the weak influence on the Central Plain by the Qin isolationist policy. Initially, Qin avoided involvement using its protective geography and, responding to growing external threats, gradually turned to intervention in the manner of &quot;defensive imperialism.&quot;

During the early Warring States period, its neighbours in the Central Plains began rapidly developing. The Wei state, formed from the partition of Jin, became the most powerful state on Qin&#x27;s eastern border. Qin largely relied on natural defences such as the Hangu Pass (northeast of modern Lingbao, Henan) and Wu Pass (modern Danfeng County) in the east, to protect its Guanzhong heartland. Between 413 and 409 BC, during the reign of Duke Jian of Qin, the Wei army, led by Wu Qi and supported by Zhao and Han, attacked Qin and conquered some Qin territories west of the Yellow River.

====Legalist reforms====

In 362 BC, Qin defeated Wei and Han. Following these victories, the Qin rulers actively pursued legal, economic, and social reforms. In 361 BC, Duke Xiao ascended the throne of Qin. He issued an announcement inviting men of talent (including scholars, administrators, theorists, and militarists) from other states to enter Qin and assist him with his reforms, promising rewards of high offices and lands in return.

Among these foreign talents, Shang Yang successfully conducted a series of Legalist reforms in Qin with the support of Duke Xiao, despite facing strong opposition from conservative Qin politicians. Direct primogeniture was abolished, with all commoners granted citizenship rights. Many were resettled in new clusters with a focus on increasing agricultural output. Meritocracy was practiced throughout, especially in the military, with soldiers and officers receiving due rewards according to their contributions, regardless of their backgrounds. 

However, stringent and strict laws were also imposed, with severe punishments being meted out for the slightest of offences, and even the nobility and royalty were not exempt. After decades, the reforms strengthened Qin economically and militarily, and transformed it into a highly centralised state with an efficient administrative system.

Following the death of Duke Xiao, King Huiwen ascended as the new ruler of Qin. He executed Shang Yang by tearing him apart with chariots, citing charges of treason. However, some speculated that the king harboured a personal grudge against Shang, as he had been severely punished for a minor infraction during his adolescence under Shang&#x27;s reformed system. Despite this, King Huiwen and his successors maintained the reformed systems, which laid the foundation for Qin&#x27;s eventual unification of China under the Qin dynasty in 221 BC. Shang Yang&#x27;s theories were later expanded upon by Han Fei, another Legalist scholar. Han Fei amalgamated Shang&#x27;s ideas with those of Shen Buhai and Shen Dao, forming the core philosophies of Legalism. Following these reforms, Qin rose to prominence in the late fourth century BC and emerged as the dominant superpower among the Seven Warring States.

====Hegemonic stage====
In 364 BC, Qin defeated the combined armies of Wei and Han, and King Xian of Zhou, the nominal ruler of China, declared Duke Xian the Hegemon (ba) of China (Sima Qian 4:160). His successor, Duke Xiao, who ascended the throne in 361 BC, was also appointed Hegemon (Sima Qian 7:203). The &quot;Guanzi&quot; defines the status of hegemon as intermediate between king and emperor. A text from the late Warring States period describes hegemon as controlling military forces and commerce of the states under the hegemony and using court visits as a means of supervision.

After Xiao, the status of hegemon was not officially granted to the kings of Qin, but de facto Qin remained hegemonic until its universal conquest in 221 BC. It seldom suffered defeats and repeatedly crashed other states in at least 15 major campaigns. &quot;Memorial on the Abolition of Feudal Lords&quot; by Qin official Li Si, dated to 246 BC, described: Through military victories, Qin has, &quot;in the time of the last six kings,&quot; that is from Xiao in 361 BC to the First Emperor, brought the other states &quot;into submission.&quot; Already by the 240s BC, other states &quot;yielded obeiscence to Qin as if they were its commanderies and prefectures.&quot; Sima Qian (6:282) confirmed and dated the beginning of the Qin hegemonic policy already from the reign of Xiao&#x27;s predecessor, Xian (384-361 BC): Since his reign, Qin &quot;gradually swallowed up the six states until, after 100 years or so,&quot; the First Emperor conquered them. &quot;For more than one hundred years [before 221 BC], Qin commanded Eight lands and brought the lords of equal rank to its court.&quot;

By the late 4th century BC, other states in China became alarmed by the Qin power and began forming anti-hegemonic alliances, called Perpendicular (Sima Qian 5:208; 6:279). Qin repeatedly clashed with these alliances. This pattern continued during the last century of the Warring States.

The success of Qin is attributed to the industriousness of its people. The Qin kings authorised numerous state development projects, including significant public works such as irrigation canals and defensive structures.

One of the most evident outcomes of the reforms was the transformation in Qin&#x27;s military. Previously, the army was under the control of Qin&#x27;s nobles and comprised feudal levies. Following Shang Yang&#x27;s reforms, the aristocracy system was abolished and replaced by a meritocracy, in which ordinary citizens had the same opportunities as the nobles to be promoted to high ranks. Additionally, military discipline was strictly enforced, and the troops were trained to adapt more effectively to various battle situations. Qin&#x27;s military strength increased significantly with the full support of the state. In 318 BC, the states of Wei, Zhao, Han, Yan, and Chu formed an alliance and attacked Qin, but failed to advance beyond Hangu Pass, and were defeated by counter-attacking Qin forces. The alliance crumbled due to mistrust, suspicion, and a lack of coordination among the five states.

In addition to the effects on Qin&#x27;s military, Shang Yang&#x27;s reforms also increased labour for numerous public works projects aimed at enhancing agriculture, and enabled Qin to maintain and supply an active military force of more than a million troops. This achievement could not be matched by any other state, except Chu, during that time. Qin&#x27;s conquests of the southern states of Ba and Shu (modern Sichuan) also provided Qin with significant strategic advantages. The lands in the new territories were highly fertile and served as a &quot;backyard&quot; for supplies and additional manpower. It was difficult for Qin&#x27;s rivals to attack Ba and Shu, as the territories were located deep in the mountains upstream of the Yangtze. Simultaneously, Qin&#x27;s strategic position in Ba and Shu provided it with a platform for launching attacks on the Chu state, which lies downstream of the Yangtze.

====Actions against Chu====

During the reign of King Huiwen of Qin, the state of Chu to the southeast became a target for Qin&#x27;s aggression. Although Chu had the largest operation-ready army of all the Seven Warring States at over a million troops, its administrative and military strength was plagued by corruption and divided among the nobles. The Qin strategist Zhang Yi suggested to King Huiwen to exercise Qin&#x27;s interest at the expense of Chu. Over the following years, Zhang engineered and executed a number of diplomatic plots against Chu, supported by the constant military raids on Chu&#x27;s north-western border. Chu suffered many defeats in battles against Qin and was forced to cede territories to Qin. King Huai I of Chu was furious and ordered a military campaign against Qin, but he was tricked by Zhang Yi into breaking diplomatic ties with his allies, and his angered allies joined Qin in inflicting a crushing defeat on Chu. In 299 BC, King Huai I was tricked into attending a diplomatic conference in Qin, where he was captured and held hostage until his death. In the meantime, Qin launched several attacks on Chu and eventually sacked the Chu capital city of Chen (; modern Jiangling County, Hubei). The crown prince of Chu fled east and was crowned King Qingxiang of Chu in the new capital city of Shouchun (; modern Shou County, Anhui).

====Wars against Zhao, Han, and Wei====
In the five decades following King Huiwen&#x27;s death, King Zhaoxiang of Qin shifted his focus to the central plains after victories in the south against Chu. In the early years of King Zhaoxiang&#x27;s reign, the Marquis of Rang () served as Qin&#x27;s chancellor and actively advocated for military campaigns against the state of Qi in the far eastern part of China. However, the marquis had personal motives, intending to use Qin&#x27;s formidable military to secure his own fief in Qi territories, as these lands were not directly linked to Qin and would not be under the Qin government&#x27;s direct administration.

King Zhaoxiang&#x27;s foreign adviser, Fan Sui, counselled the king to abandon these fruitless campaigns against distant states. King Zhaoxiang heeded this advice and altered Qin&#x27;s foreign policy to foster good diplomatic relations with the distant states of Yan and Qi), while focusing on attacking the nearby Zhao, Han, and Wei. As a result, Qin began to launch constant attacks on Han and Wei over the subsequent decades, conquering several territories in its campaigns. By then, Qin&#x27;s territories had expanded beyond the eastern shore of the Yellow River, and Han and Wei were reduced to the status of &quot;buffers&quot; for Qin against the other states in the east.

Starting from 265 BC, Qin launched a massive invasion on Han and forced Han to cede its territory of Shangdang (; modern Shanxi). However, Han offered Shangdang to Zhao instead, leading to a conflict between Qin and Zhao for control of Shangdang. Qin and Zhao engaged in the three-year-long Battle of Changping, followed by another three-year siege by Qin on Zhao&#x27;s capital city of Handan. The conflict at Changping was seen as a power struggle, as both sides pitted their forces against each other not only on the battlefield, but also domestically. Although Qin had an abundance of resources and vast manpower, it had to enlist every man above the age of 15 for war-related duties, ranging from front-line service to logistics and agriculture. King Zhaoxiang even personally directed his army&#x27;s supply lines. Qin&#x27;s eventual victory in 260 BC was attributed to its use of schemes to stir up internal conflict in Zhao, which led to the replacement of Zhao&#x27;s military leaders.
Following the Qin victory at the Battle of Changping, the Qin commander, Bai Qi, ordered the 400,000 prisoners of war from Zhao to be executed by burying them alive. Subsequently, the Qin forces marched on the Zhao capital city of Handan in an attempt to conquer Zhao completely. However, the Qin troops were unable to capture Handan as they were already exhausted and also because the Zhao forces put up fierce resistance. King Xiaocheng of Zhao offered six cities to Qin as a peace offer, and King Zhaoxiang of Qin accepted the offer after being persuaded by Fan Sui. Within Zhao, many officials strongly opposed King Xiaocheng&#x27;s decision to give up the cities, and subsequent delays caused the siege on Handan to be prolonged until 258 BC. Meanwhile, Bai Qi was consecutively replaced by Wang Xi, Wang Ling, and Zheng Anping as the Qin commander at the siege.

In 257 BC, Qin was still unable to penetrate Handan after besieging it for three years, and Zhao requested aid from the neighbouring states of Wei and Chu. Wei was hesitant to help Zhao initially but launched an attack on Qin after seeing that Qin was already exhausted after years of war. The Qin forces crumbled and retreated, and Zheng Anping surrendered. The combined forces of Wei and Chu continued to pursue the retreating Qin army, and Wei managed to retake part of its original lands that were lost to Qin earlier.

====Infrastructural works====
In the middle of the 3rd century, Zheng Guo, a hydraulic engineer from the state of Han, was dispatched to Qin to advise King Zhaoxiang on the construction of irrigation canals. Qin had a predilection for constructing large-scale canals, as evidenced by its irrigation system for the Min River. King Zhaoxiang approved Zheng Guo&#x27;s proposal to construct an even larger canal. The project was completed in 264 and the canal was named in honour of Zheng. Qin benefited from the project as it became one of the most fertile states in China due to the efficient irrigation system, and also because it could now muster more troops as a result of increased agricultural yield.

===Unification===
In 247, the 13-year-old Ying Zheng became King of Qin following the sudden death of King Zhuangxiang. However, Ying Zheng did not fully wield state power until 238, after eliminating his political rivals, Lü Buwei and Lao Ai. Ying formulated a plan for conquering the other six states and unifying China, with assistance from Li Si and Wei Liao.

In 230, Qin attacked Han, the weakest of the Seven Warring States, and succeeded in conquering Han within a year. Since 236, Qin had been launching several assaults on Zhao, which had been devastated by its calamitous defeat at the Battle of Changping three decades earlier. Although Qin faced strong resistance from the Zhao forces, led by General Li Mu, it still managed to defeat the Zhao army by using a ploy to sow discord between King Qian of Zhao and Li Mu, leading King Qian to order Li Mu&#x27;s execution and replace Li with the less competent Zhao Cong. Zhao eventually fell to Qin in 228 after the capital city of Handan was taken. However, a Zhao noble managed to escape with remnant forces and proclaim himself King in Dai. Dai fell to Qin six years later.
After the fall of Zhao, Qin turned its attention towards Crown Prince Dan of Yan, who had sent Jing Ke to assassinate Ying Zheng, but the assassination attempt failed, and Qin used that as a pretext to attack Yan. Yan lost to Qin at a battle on the eastern bank of the Yi River in 226, and King Xi of Yan fled with remnant forces to Liaodong. Qin attacked Yan again in 222 and annexed Yan completely. In 225, the Qin army, led by Wang Ben, invaded Wei and besieged Wei&#x27;s capital city of Daliang for three months. Wang directed the waters from the Yellow River and the Hong Canal to flood Daliang; King Jia of Wei surrendered, and Wei was conquered.

In 224, Qin prepared for an attack on Chu, its most powerful rival among the six states. During a discussion between Ying Zheng and his subjects, the veteran general Wang Jian claimed that the invasion force needed to be at least 600,000 strong, but the younger general Li Xin thought that 200,000 men would suffice. Ying Zheng put Li Xin in command of the Qin army to attack Chu. The Chu defenders, led by Xiang Yan, took Li Xin&#x27;s army by surprise and defeated the Qin invaders. The defeat was deemed the greatest setback for Qin in its wars to unify China. Ying Zheng put Wang Jian in command of the 600,000-strong army as he had requested and ordered Wang to lead another attack on Chu. Wang scored a major victory against the Chu forces in 224, and Xiang Yan was killed in action. The following year, Qin pushed on and captured Chu&#x27;s capital city of Shouchun, bringing an end to Chu&#x27;s existence. In 222, the Qin army advanced southward and annexed the Wuyue region (modern Zhejiang and Jiangsu).

By 221, Qi was the only rival state left. Qin advanced into the heartland of Qi via a southern detour, avoiding direct confrontation with the Qi forces on Qi&#x27;s western border and arrived swiftly at Qi&#x27;s capital city of Linzi. The Qi forces were taken by surprise and surrendered without putting up resistance. Following the fall of Qi in 221 BC, China was unified under the rule of Qin. Ying Zheng declared himself &quot;Qin Shi Huang&quot; (meaning &quot;First Emperor of Qin&quot;), founded the Qin dynasty, and became the first sovereign ruler of a united China.

==Culture and society==
Before Qin unified China, each state had its own customs and culture. According to the &quot;Yu Gong&quot; or &quot;Tribute of Yu&quot;, composed in the 4th or 5th century BC and included in the &quot;Book of Documents&quot;, there were nine distinct cultural regions of China, which are described in detail in this book. The work focuses on the travels of the titular sage, Yu the Great, throughout each of the regions. Other texts, predominantly military, also discussed these cultural variations.

One of these texts was the &quot;Wuzi&quot;, written in response to a query by Marquis Wu of Wei on how to cope with the military threat posed by competing states. Wu Qi, the author of the work, declared that the government and nature of the people were reflective of the terrain they live in. Of Qin, he said:

According to Wu, the character of the populace is a consequence of the government, which in turn is a result of the ruggedness of the terrain. Wu expounds upon each of the states in this manner.

Following a visit to Qin in 264, the Confucian philosopher Xun Kuang observed that Qin society was &quot;simple and unsophisticated&quot;, and its people held their officials in awe but were entirely devoid of Confucian literati. Despite being disliked by many Confucians of its time for &quot;dangerously lacking in Confucian scholars&quot;, Confucian Xun Kuang wrote of the later Qin that &quot;its topographical features are inherently advantageous&quot;, and that its &quot;manifold natural resources gave it remarkable inherent strength. Its people were unspoiled and exceedingly deferential; its officers unfailingly respectful, earnest, reverential, loyal, and trustworthy; and its high officials public-spirited, intelligent, and assiduous in the execution of the duties of their position. Its courts and bureaus functioned without delays and with such smoothness that it was as if there were no government at all.&quot;

In his &quot;Petition against driving away foreigners&quot; (), Li Si mentioned that the &quot;guzheng&quot; and percussion instruments made of pottery and tiles were characteristic of Qin music.

<text>The Glebe is a neighbourhood in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. It is located just south of Downtown Ottawa in the Capital Ward. As of 2016, the neighbourhood had a population of 13,055.

The Glebe is bounded on the north by the Queensway, on the east and south by the Rideau Canal and on the west by LeBreton Street South, Carling Avenue and Dow&#x27;s Lake. This area includes the Glebe Annex, an area west of Bronson Avenue, north of Carling Avenue, east of LeBreton South Street and south of the Queensway. It also includes the Dow&#x27;s Lake neighbourhood, an area north of the Rideau Canal, east of Dow&#x27;s Lake, south of Carling Avenue, and west of Bronson.

The Glebe lies in the federal riding of Ottawa Centre and the provincial electoral district of the same name.

== Community ==

The Glebe has a strong community association which, in addition to operating the Glebe Community Centre, lobbies the local government on issues such as traffic calming and neighbourhood development. The Glebe has a community newspaper, &quot;Glebe Report&quot;, that has been published independently since 1973.

The Glebe is mostly populated by families; the area has many children, and consequently, its social services are oriented towards youth.

The stretch of Bank Street that runs through the Glebe is one of Ottawa&#x27;s premier shopping areas, with many small stores and restaurants offering a wide variety of services. Much of the rest of the Glebe consists of detached homes, many of them constructed in the early decades of the 20th century. Some of these homes are owner-occupied family residences, while others have been subdivided into multiple rental apartments.

The Glebe is home to Lansdowne Park which contains TD Place Stadium, where Ottawa&#x27;s Canadian Football League (CFL) football team (the Ottawa Redblacks) and the University of Ottawa Gee-Gees play their home games. Lansdowne Park also contains TD Place Arena, which is the permanent home of the Ottawa 67&#x27;s and was the temporary home (1992–1995) for the Ottawa Senators before the Canadian Tire Centre (originally called The Palladium) was completed. The area that became the park was purchased from local farmers in 1868 by the City of Ottawa Agricultural Society.
From the Rideau Canal, two bodies of water jut into the Glebe: Patterson Creek and Brown&#x27;s Inlet. These areas are surrounded by parks and some of the city&#x27;s most expensive homes.

The last Saturday in May of each year brings the &quot;Great Glebe Garage Sale&quot; to the neighbourhood; every household that participates puts items out for sale, attracting a large contingent of bargain hunters to the area. Sellers are expected to donate a portion of the proceeds to a designated charity.

May is also the time of the Canadian Tulip Festival. The largest tulip beds in the National Capital Region are found in Commissioner&#x27;s Park in the Dow&#x27;s Lake neighbourhood, next to Dow&#x27;s Lake.

== History ==

The area is called the Glebe because in the initial 1837 survey of Ottawa, the area of 178 acres was deeded by the Crown to St. Andrew&#x27;s Presbyterian Church as Clergy Reserve. The word &quot;glebe&quot; means church lands, and the area was originally known as &quot;the glebe lands of St. Andrew&#x27;s Presbyterian Church&quot;. When the area was opened for development in 1870, real estate agents began to refer to it simply as &quot;The Glebe&quot;. The initial area was bounded by Carling Avenue and Fifth Avenue on the north and south sides, and Main Street and Bronson Avenue as the eastern and western limits. The original city limits on the south side had been set at Gladstone Avenue when the city was incorporated. Annexation in 1889 extended the new limits to the Rideau Canal. By the Act of the Provincial Legislature, the Glebe became part of a small but growing city. By the late 1960s, the Glebe was bounded by the Queensway on the north side, by the Rideau Canal on the east and south, and with Bronson Avenue as a western boundary.

The Glebe was one of Ottawa&#x27;s first suburbs. In 1871 James Whyte, one of the leading merchants of the town, built a large residence on Canal Road on the north side of the waterway at midpoint between what is now Bank Street and Bronson Avenue, which served the Basilian Fathers in the 1960s. In 1872, James Whyte moved into a new home on Bank Street near Holmwood Avenue, which served the community in the 1960s as a residence for older people. In 1882 the creation of Central Park and the construction of the new Canada Atlantic Railway terminal on the west side of the Rideau Canal at the end of the Glebe encouraged the development of the southern section of the city.

In June 1891, the first electric street car set off down Bank Street for the Exhibition, which opened at Lansdowne Park in 1888. First Avenue Public School and St. Matthew&#x27;s Anglican Church, then a small frame structure, opened their doors about the same time in 1898. Mutchmor Public School on Fifth Avenue was built in the 1890s with additions in 1911 and 1920 as housing density increased and new families moved into the district. The separate school, Corpus Christi, also dates from this early era. Roman Catholic families attended Mass for some years to a temporary chapel on the south side of Fourth Avenue near Percy. In 1900, the Ottawa Electric Street Railway was established, with one of its first routes running south along Bank Street. The Drive way, from Elgin Street and Laurier Avenue over the route to the Experimental Farm, was built between 1900 and 1903, providing added impetus to city growth on the south side. Most Glebe houses (which were largely built before 1914) date from this era, and the area became home to many middle-class workers. As housing went up on the avenues, corner stores and other commercial properties began to appear on Bank Street. The electric street car allowed workers to live in the Glebe and take the street car to work. As part of this building program, Clemow and Monkland Avenues were laid out and Clemow Avenue was paved west from Bank Street. From 1903-1904, a large low-lying area between Second and Third Avenues was filled in with sand taken from the land along Carling Avenue. Growth was slower on the blocks west of Bank Street, and housing did not extend much beyond Kent Street.

Between Powell and Carling Avenues, a transformation gradually took place since an address in this part of the Glebe showed that the owner had property or position, probably both. A series of distinctive homes, both east and west of Bank Street, were indicative of the style and wealth of the owners. A number of the more upscale residences were designed by renowned Canadian architects W.E. Noffke and David Younghusband, while others were pattern-book homes built by local builders based on catalog designs similar to foursquare architecture elsewhere in North America.

Blessed Sacrament Parish was formed in 1913; however, the church was constructed 19 years later. The Methodist Congregation worshiped originally in Moreland&#x27;s Hall, on Bank Street, however Glebe Methodist Church was organized in 1913. At the time of church union in the 1920s, Glebe Methodist Church became St James United Church on Second Avenue, now known as Glebe-St. James United Church.

Glebe Collegiate Institute opened in 1922 (originally as a branch of the Ottawa Collegiate Institute, now Lisgar Collegiate), under Principal McDougall. The adjoining High School of Commerce opened in 1929. Ottawa Ladies&#x27; College, a private school specialising in the education of young women, operated on First Avenue from 1914 to 1942. During the Second World War years, the Ladies College facilities were used by the Canadian Military. Later as Carleton College, the premises played a vital part in the establishment of Carleton University. The Ava Theatre, a spacious cinema opened in 1928 at the corner of Bank Street and Second Avenue.

After 1945, postwar housing filled in the remaining acres, particularly on those streets just off Bronson Avenue where house construction had declined in the years after 1930. Side yards and vacant lots disappeared in the final stages of development.

Elsewhere in the Glebe, house construction at the time was unplanned and erratic, with housing standards lower and development haphazard. After World War II, however, these areas were largely removed or rehabilitated so that by the late 1960s, generally speaking, the Glebe possessed housing stock suitable for both upper and middle income groups. The Ottawa Improvement Commission, the forerunner of the National Capital Commission, beautified the area with special attention to sidewalks, trees and shrubs, and street lights.

In the middle part of the century the Glebe changed as the middle class moved to more distant suburbs such as Alta Vista and Nepean, and the Glebe became transformed into a predominantly working-class neighbourhood with the houses subdivided into multiple apartments or turned into rooming houses.

The neighbourhood began to change again in the 1970s when it underwent significant gentrification and became one of Ottawa&#x27;s elite neighbourhoods. These changes are obvious in the census. From 1971 to 1996 the percentage of the population with university degrees rose from 10 to 60 percent. White collar employment grew from less than half to some 95%. While in 1971 Glebe residents were 14 percent poorer than the average citizen of Ottawa, in 1996 they were 18 percent wealthier.

The 5 metre wide and 123 metre long CAD 21 million Flora Footbridge, which connects the Glebe to Old Ottawa East, opened to pedestrians and cyclists in 2019.

== Community associations ==
The Glebe has its own neighbourhood association, the Glebe Community Association.

The Glebe Annex maintains its own neighbourhood association, the Glebe Annex Community Association (GACA). Dow&#x27;s lake also maintains its own neighbourhood association, the Dow&#x27;s Lake Residents Association (DLRA).

<text>The Paper Lads is a children&#x27;s television series produced by Tyne Tees Television and broadcast nationally on ITV from 24 August 1977 to 22 January 1979. It was set in the northern industrial city of Newcastle upon Tyne, although much of the series was filmed in Gateshead, and recounted the adventures of a group of newspaper delivery boys and a girl.

There were two series made, each of seven episodes. William Corlett&#x27;s four scripts for the series won him the Writer&#x27;s Guild Award for Best Children&#x27;s Writer.

The signature tune of the series, &quot;Back Home Once Again&quot;, was performed by progressive rock band Renaissance, and it appears (re-recorded) as a full-length song on their 1978 album &quot;A Song for All Seasons&quot;.

The full series was released on DVD by Network in July 2013.

Two novels by William Humble based on the series were released by children&#x27;s paperback publisher Target Books.

<doc id="361017" wikidata="Q117425" url="?curid=361017" title="S. E. Hinton">
<text>Susan Eloise Hinton (born July 22, 1948) is an American writer best known for her young-adult novels (YA) set in Oklahoma, especially &quot;The Outsiders&quot; (1967), which she wrote during high school. Hinton is credited with introducing the YA genre.

In 1988, she received the inaugural Margaret Edwards Award from the American Library Association for her cumulative contribution in writing for teens.

== Career ==
While still in her teens, Hinton became a household name as the author of &quot;The Outsiders&quot;, her first and most popular novel, set in Oklahoma in the 1960s. She began writing it in 1965. The book was inspired by two rival gangs at her school, Will Rogers High School, the Greasers and the Socs, and her desire to empathize with the Greasers by writing from their point of view. She wrote the novel when she was 16 and it was published in 1967. Since then, the book has sold more than 14 million copies. In 2017, Viking Press stated the book sells over 500,000 copies a year.

Hinton&#x27;s publisher suggested she use her initials instead of her feminine given names so that the first male book reviewers would not dismiss the novel because its author was female. After the success of &quot;The Outsiders&quot;, Hinton chose to continue writing and publishing using her initials because she did not want to lose what she had made famous and to allow her to keep her private and public lives separate.

== Personal life ==
In interviews, Hinton has said that she is a private person and an introvert who no longer does public appearances. She enjoys reading (Jane Austen, Mary Renault, and F. Scott Fitzgerald), taking classes at the local university, and horseback riding. Hinton also revealed to &quot;Vulture&quot; that she enjoys writing fan fiction.

She resides in Tulsa, Oklahoma, with her husband David Inhofe, a software engineer she met in her freshman biology class at college. He is a cousin of former Oklahoma Senator Jim Inhofe.

== Adaptations ==
The film adaptations &quot;The Outsiders&quot; (March 1983) and &quot;Rumble Fish&quot; (October 1983) were both directed by Francis Ford Coppola; Hinton cowrote the script for &quot;Rumble Fish&quot; with Coppola. Also adapted to film were &quot;Tex&quot; (July 1982), directed by Tim Hunter, and &quot;That Was Then... This Is Now&quot; (November 1985), directed by Christopher Cain. Hinton herself acted as a location scout, and she had cameo roles in three of the four films. She plays a nurse in Dallas&#x27;s hospital room in &quot;The Outsiders&quot;. In &quot;Tex&quot;, she is the typing teacher. She also appears as a sex worker propositioning Rusty James in &quot;Rumble Fish&quot;. In 2009, Hinton portrayed the school principal in &quot;The Legend of Billy Fail&quot;.

== Awards and honors ==
Hinton received the inaugural 1988 Margaret A. Edwards Award from the American YA librarians, citing her first four YA novels, which had been published from 1967 to 1979 and adapted as films from 1982 to 1985. The annual award recognizes one author of books published in the U.S., and specified works &quot;taken to heart by young adults over a period of years, providing an &#x27;authentic voice that continues to illuminate their experiences and emotions, giving insight into their lives&#x27;.&quot; The librarians noted that in reading Hinton&#x27;s novels &quot;a young adult may explore the need for independence and simultaneously the need for loyalty and belonging, the need to care for others, and the need to be cared for by them.&quot;

In 1992, she was inducted into Phi Beta Kappa by the University of Tulsa, and in 1998 she was inducted into the Oklahoma Writers Hall of Fame at the Oklahoma Center for Poets and Writers of Oklahoma State University–Tulsa.

<text>Jane Hope Bown CBE (13 March 1925 – 21 December 2014) was an English photographer who worked for &quot;The Observer&quot; newspaper from 1949. Her portraits, primarily photographed in black and white and using available light, received widespread critical acclaim and her work has been described by Lord Snowdon as &quot;a kind of English Cartier-Bresson.&quot;

==Life and work==
Bown was born in Eastnor, Herefordshire on 13 March 1925. She described her childhood as happy, brought up in Dorset by women whom she believed to be her aunts. Bown said she was upset to realise, at the age of twelve, that one of them was her mother and her birth was illegitimate. This discovery precipitated her into delinquent behaviour in her adolescence, and acting coldly towards her mother. Her father had been the over sixty year old Charles Wentworth Bell who had employed her mother as a nurse. She first worked as a chart corrector with the WRNS, which included a role in plotting the D-Day invasion, and this employment entitled her to an education grant. She then studied photography at Guildford School of Art under Ifor Thomas.

Bown began her career as a wedding portrait photographer until 1951, when Thomas put her in touch with Mechthild Nawiasky, a picture editor at &quot;The Observer&quot;. Nawiasky showed her portfolio to editor David Astor who was impressed and immediately commissioned her to photograph the philosopher Bertrand Russell.

Bown worked primarily in black-and-white and preferred to use available light. Until the early 1960s, she worked primarily with a Rolleiflex camera. Subsequently, Bown used a 35 mm Pentax SLR, before settling on the Olympus OM-1 camera, often using an 85 mm lens. She photographed hundreds of subjects, including Orson Welles, Samuel Beckett, Sir John Betjeman, Woody Allen, Cilla Black, Quentin Crisp, P. J. Harvey, John Lennon, Truman Capote, John Peel, the gangster Charlie Richardson, Field Marshal Sir Gerald Templer, Jarvis Cocker, Björk, Jayne Mansfield, Diana Dors, Henri Cartier-Bresson, Eve Arnold, Evelyn Waugh, Brassai and Margaret Thatcher. She took Queen Elizabeth II&#x27;s eightieth birthday portrait.

Bown&#x27;s extensive photojournalism output includes series on Hop Pickers, evictions of Greenham Common Women&#x27;s Peace Camp, Butlin&#x27;s holiday resort, the British Seaside, and in 2002, the Glastonbury festival. Her social documentary and photojournalism was mostly unseen before the release of her book &quot;Unknown Bown 1947–1967&quot; (2007).

In 2007, her work from Greenham Common was selected by Val Williams and Susan Bright as part of &quot;How We Are: Photographing Britain&quot;, the first major survey of photography to be held at Tate Britain.

A documentary about Bown, &quot;Looking For Light&quot; (2014), directed by Luke Dodd and Michael Whyte, features Bown conversing about her life and interviews those she photographed and worked with, including Edna O&#x27;Brien, Lynn Barber and Richard Ashcroft.

In June 2014, Bown was awarded an honorary degree from the University for the Creative Arts.

==Private life==
In 1954, Bown married the fashion retail executive Martin Moss. The couple had three children, Matthew, Louisa, and Hugo. Moss pre-deceased her in 2007.

On 21 December 2014, Bown died at the age of 89. Paying tribute to her work, Lord Snowdon described her as &quot;a kind of English Cartier-Bresson&quot; who produced &quot;photography at its best. She doesn&#x27;t rely on tricks or gimmicks, just simple, honest recording, but with a shrewd and intellectual eye.&quot;

<doc id="361019" wikidata="Q944414" url="?curid=361019" title="McCain Foods">
<text>McCain Foods Limited is a Canadian multinational frozen food company established in 1957 in Florenceville, New Brunswick, Canada.

It is the world&#x27;s largest manufacturer of frozen potato products, with 1 in 4 french fries in the world being a McCain fry. Its major competitors are Simplot and Lamb Weston.

==History==

McCain Foods was co-founded in 1957 by brothers Harrison McCain and Wallace McCain with the help of their two older brothers.

In their first year of production, the company hired 30 employees and grossed over $150,000 in sales. During the 1970s–1990s, the company expanded into additional prepared food markets including frozen pizza and vegetables.

As of 2017, the company is the world&#x27;s largest manufacturer of frozen potato products, and has over 20,000 employees and 47 production facilities in six continents. The company generates more than $8.5 billion in annual sales.

Based on 2014 sales, it is the 19th largest private company in Canada, according to &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot;″s Report on Business. Nancy McCain, of the McCain family, is married to former Canadian Finance Minister Bill Morneau. In 2020, McCain Foods won the Lausanne Index Prize – Best of Packaging.

==UK operations==
McCain Foods&#x27; UK subsidiary has a factory in Scarborough, North Yorkshire, and sponsored the former football stadium in the town until the football team was dissolved on June 20, 2007. There is also a plant at Whittlesey, Cambridgeshire, and a cold store in Easton, Lincolnshire.

A legal case in which McCain Foods (GB) Ltd sued Eco-Tec (Europe) Ltd. was decided by the High Court in 2011. McCain had ordered a system intended to remove hydrogen sulphide from biogas produced in its waste water treatment plant, which would allow the gas to produce power and heat for the Whittlesey plant. The system proved to be &quot;impossible to commission successfully&quot; and so McCain sued for compensation. The court&#x27;s ruling confirmed that Eco-Tec were in breach of their contract. Legally, the court took a broadly inclusive approach to the scope of the losses incurred by McCain and the damages due to them, declining to treat a number of items as &quot;consequential losses&quot; for which Eco-Tec sought protection under a contractual exclusion clause.

<doc id="361020" wikidata="Q193628" url="?curid=361020" title="Sofia Coppola">
<text>Sofia Carmina Coppola ( , ; born May 14, 1971) is an American filmmaker and former actress. She has won an Academy Award, a Golden Globe Award, a Golden Lion, and a Cannes Film Festival Award. She was also nominated for three BAFTA Awards, as well as a Primetime Emmy Award.

Her parents are filmmakers Eleanor and Francis Ford Coppola, and she made her acting debut as an infant in her father&#x27;s acclaimed crime drama &quot;The Godfather&quot; (1972). Coppola later appeared in several music videos and had a supporting role in the fantasy comedy film &quot;Peggy Sue Got Married&quot; (1986). She then portrayed Mary Corleone, the daughter of Michael Corleone, in the sequel &quot;The Godfather Part III&quot; (1990).

Coppola transitioned into filmmaking with her feature-length directorial debut in the coming-of-age drama &quot;The Virgin Suicides&quot; (1999). It was the first of her collaborations with actress Kirsten Dunst. Her films often deal with themes of loneliness, wealth, privilege, isolation, youth, femininity, and adolescence in America. Coppola received the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay for the comedy-drama &quot;Lost in Translation&quot; (2003), and was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Director, becoming the third woman to do so. She has since directed the historical drama &quot;Marie Antoinette&quot; (2006), the family drama &quot;Somewhere&quot; (2010), the satirical crime drama &quot;The Bling Ring&quot; (2013), the southern gothic thriller &quot;The Beguiled&quot; (2017), the comedy &quot;On the Rocks&quot; (2020), and the biographical drama &quot;Priscilla&quot; (2023).

In 2015, Coppola released the Netflix Christmas musical comedy special &quot;A Very Murray Christmas&quot;, which earned her a nomination for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Television Movie.

== Early life ==
Coppola was born in New York City on May 14, 1971, the youngest child of documentarian Eleanor (&quot;née&quot; Neil) and filmmaker Francis Ford Coppola. She is of Italian descent (Lucanian and Neapolitan) on her father&#x27;s side and was raised on her parents&#x27; farm in Rutherford, California. At 15, Coppola interned with Chanel. Coppola graduated from St. Helena High School in 1989. She first studied at Mills College and transferred to the California Institute of the Arts from 1993 to 1994 to focus on painting. Thereafter, she attended Art Center College of Design, where she was mentored by Paul Jasmin. After dropping out of college, Coppola started a clothing line called Milkfed, which is now sold exclusively in Japan.

Coppola had many varying interests growing up, including fashion, photography, music, and design, and did not initially intend to become a filmmaker. However, after making her first short film &quot;Lick the Star&quot; in 1998, she realized it &quot;brought together all the things [she] loved&quot;, and decided to continue her directing pursuits.

== Career ==

=== 1972–1999: Acting career ===
Coppola&#x27;s acting career, marked by frequent criticisms of nepotism and negative reviews, began while she was an infant, as she made background appearances in eight of her father&#x27;s films. The best known of these is her appearance in &quot;The Godfather&quot; as the infant Michael Francis Rizzi, in the baptism scene. Coppola also acted in her father&#x27;s films &quot;The Outsiders&quot; (1983), in a scene where Matt Dillon, Tommy Howell, and Ralph Macchio are eating at a Dairy Queen; &quot;Rumble Fish&quot; (1983); &quot;The Cotton Club&quot; (1984); and &quot;Peggy Sue Got Married&quot; (1986), in which she portrayed Kathleen Turner&#x27;s sister Nancy. &quot;Frankenweenie&quot; (1984) was the first film Coppola performed in that was not associated with her father, however, it often goes unnoticed due to her stage name &quot;Domino&quot;, which she adopted at the time because she thought it was glamorous. A short film entitled &quot;Life Without Zoe&quot; (1989), released as part of a anthology film &quot;New York Stories&quot;, was co-written by a teenage Coppola and her father; her father also directed the film.

Coppola returned to her father&#x27;s &quot;Godfather&quot; trilogy in both the second and third &quot;Godfather&quot; films, playing an immigrant child in &quot;The Godfather Part II&quot; and playing Michael Corleone&#x27;s daughter in &quot;The Godfather Part III&quot; after the originally cast actress, Winona Ryder, dropped out of the film at the last minute due to nervous exhaustion. It has been suggested that Coppola&#x27;s performance in &quot;The Godfather Part III&quot; damaged Francis Ford Coppola&#x27;s career and ruined Sofia&#x27;s before it had even begun. Coppola has said that she never really wanted to act and only did it to help out when her father asked her to. It has also been suggested that Sofia&#x27;s role in the film may have affected its box office performance, which started strongly and then went into decline. Coppola herself worried that she had only been given the role because she was the director&#x27;s daughter, and the role placed a strain on her during the time of shooting that her mother observed in a series of diaries she wrote for &quot;Vogue&quot; during the filming. Coppola later stated that she was not hurt by the criticism from her work in the film because she never especially wanted an acting career.

After she was critically panned for her performance in &quot;The Godfather Part III&quot; (for which she was named &quot;Worst Supporting Actress&quot; and &quot;Worst New Star&quot; at the 1990 Golden Raspberry Awards), Coppola largely ended her acting career. However, she did appear in the independent film &quot;Inside Monkey Zetterland&quot; (1992), as well as in the backgrounds of films by her friends and family (for example, she appeared as Saché, one of Queen Padmé Amidala&#x27;s five handmaidens, in George Lucas&#x27; 1999 film &quot;Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace&quot;).

Coppola also appeared in several 1990s music videos: the Black Crowes&#x27; &quot;Sometimes Salvation&quot;; Sonic Youth&#x27;s &quot;Mildred Pierce&quot;; Madonna&#x27;s &quot;Deeper and Deeper&quot;; the Chemical Brothers&#x27; &quot;Elektrobank&quot;, which was directed by her then-husband Spike Jonze; and later Phoenix&#x27;s &quot;Funky Squaredance&quot;.

=== 1998–2003: Directorial debut and acclaim ===
 &quot;The Virgin Suicides&quot; (1999) 

Coppola&#x27;s first short film was &quot;Lick the Star&quot; (1998). It played many times on the Independent Film Channel. She made her feature film directing debut with &quot;The Virgin Suicides&quot; (1999); the film adaptation of the novel &quot;The Virgin Suicides&quot; by Jeffrey Eugenides. It received critical acclaim upon its premiere in North America at the 2000 Sundance Film Festival and was released later that year. Coppola was first drawn to the story after reading the book by Jeffrey Eugenides in 1995, at the recommendation of musician Thurston Moore. Coppola said she felt the novel&#x27;s author understood the teenage experience. She has also said that if not for the book, she may not have had a career in film. Specifically, Coppola has highlighted the representation of teenagers &quot;lazing around&quot;, a situation she connected with but felt was not seen very much in films in any relatable way. The story&#x27;s theme of loss was a personal connection for Coppola in light of the 1986 death of her oldest brother in a boating accident, though she stated that she did not immediately realize this connection. Coppola secured the rights to the novel and adapted the screenplay herself. The low-budget film drew praise from critics and represented the point at which Coppola became a filmmaker independent of her family connections. She credits the start of her career to the Cannes festival after the film premiered there. The film stars actors Danny DeVito, Kirsten Dunst, Scott Glenn, Josh Hartnett, Michael Paré, Jonathan Tucker, Kathleen Turner, and James Woods.

; &quot;Lost in Translation&quot; (2003)
Coppola&#x27;s second feature &quot;Lost in Translation&quot; (2003) won her the Academy Award for best original screenplay and three Golden Globe Awards including Best Picture Musical or Comedy. After Lina Wertmüller and Jane Campion, Coppola became the third female director to be nominated for an Academy Award for Directing and the second to win the Original Screenplay award, after Campion in 1994 (Wertmüller was also nominated). Her win for the best original screenplay in 2003 made her a third-generation Oscar winner. Coppola was the second woman, after Edith Head, to be nominated for three Oscars in one night. In 2004, Coppola was invited to join the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. Coppola shot &quot;Lost in Translation&quot; in 27 days, with a small crew, working without permits. Scenes were filmed impromptu on the street, while scenes shot at the Park Hyatt Hotel allowed the crew to use its corridors between two and three in the morning without disturbing guests.

The film received positive reception and acclaim, though also generated controversy due the film&#x27;s usage &quot;of Japan as an exotic and bizarre landscape for its American protagonists&quot;. The group Asian Mediawatch lobbied against the film&#x27;s Academy Award nominations, stating &quot;The film has no meaningful Japanese roles, nor is there any significant dialogue between the main characters and the Japanese. Such portrayals perpetuate negative stereotypes and attitudes that are harmful to Asian Americans in the US, where a significant minority of Americans already have negative attitudes towards Asians.&quot; Coppola responded to these allegations in an interview for &quot;The Independent&quot;, &quot;I can see why people might think that, but I know I&#x27;m not racist. I think if everything&#x27;s based on truth, you can make fun, have a little laugh, but also be respectful of a culture. I just love Tokyo, and I&#x27;m not mean-spirited...Even on our daily call sheets, they would mix up the &#x27;rs&#x27; and the &#x27;ls&#x27; – all that was from experience, it&#x27;s not made up. I guess someone has misunderstood my intentions. It bugs me, because I know I&#x27;m not racist.&quot;

=== 2006–2017: Established career ===

; &quot;Marie Antoinette&quot; (2006)

Her third film was the biopic &quot;Marie Antoinette&quot; (2006), adapted from the biography by British historian Antonia Fraser. Kirsten Dunst plays the titular character and Jason Schwartzman, Coppola&#x27;s cousin, plays King Louis XVI. The film debuted at the 2006 Cannes Film Festival where, despite boos in the audience, it received a standing ovation. Though critics were divided at the time of its release, it has since received a cult following and more critical acclaim in the years that followed. Peter Bradshaw of &quot;The Guardian&quot; declared, &quot;Sofia Coppola&#x27;s presentation of Marie&#x27;s life has a sisterly, unjudging intimacy, and the director has carried off pert inventions and provocations with some style, combining dazzling visual tableaux and formal set-pieces in strict period, with new wave chart hits from the 1970s and 80s: these musical anachronisms lending ironic torsion to the overall effect.&quot;

&quot;Marie Antoinette&quot; was shot on location at the Château de Versailles. Coppola herself has claimed that she was initially drawn towards the character of Marie Antoinette as an innocent and caring character who found herself in a situation outside of her control, and that rather than creating a historical representation, she wanted to create a more intimate look into the world of the heroine. Coppola was interested in making an emotional connection to the young royalty whose &quot;coming-of-age took place under conditions familiar to a pampered zoo animal&quot;. The film&#x27;s style is not that of a traditional biopic, and instead utilizes &quot;hit songs and incongruous dialogue&quot;. The film received the Academy Award for Best Costume Design as well as three BAFTA Awards nominations.

; &quot;Somewhere&quot; (2010)

Coppola&#x27;s fourth film was &quot;Somewhere&quot; (2010), filmed at Chateau Marmont. The plot focuses on a &quot;bad boy&quot; actor Marco (portrayed by Stephen Dorff) who is forced to reevaluate his life when his daughter Cleo (played by Elle Fanning) arrives unexpectedly. The relationship between Marco and Cleo was loosely based on Coppola&#x27;s own relationship with her father. The film won the prestigious Golden Lion at the Venice Film Festival. In November 2010, Coppola was interviewed by Joel Coen, who professed his admiration of her work, at the DGA screening of &quot;Somewhere&quot; in New York City.

&quot;Somewhere&quot; depicts a newly famous actor (Stephen Dorff) recuperating from a minor injury whose wealth, fame, and professional experiences cannot alleviate the existential crisis he is experiencing, as he is forced to care for his 11-year-old daughter in the absence of his wife. The film premiered at the 67th Venice International Film Festival, and opened in the rest of Italy, on September 3, 2010. The festival jury unanimously awarded the film the Golden Lion prize for the best overall film. Quentin Tarantino, president of the jury, said the film &quot;grew and grew in our hearts, in our minds, in our affections&quot; after the first screening. The film continued to receive critical acclaim, especially from notable film critic Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; who praised the detail in the portrait of Johnny Marco, writing, &quot;Coppola is a fascinating director. She sees, and we see exactly what she sees. There is little attempt here to observe a plot. All the attention is on the handful of characters, on Johnny.&quot;

; &quot;The Bling Ring&quot; (2013)

Coppola&#x27;s next film, &quot;The Bling Ring&quot; (2013), was based on actual events centered around the Bling Ring, a group of California teenagers who burgled the homes of several celebrities over 2008 and 2009, stealing around $3 million in cash and belongings. Emma Watson, Taissa Farmiga, Leslie Mann, Israel Broussard, Katie Chang, and Claire Julien starred in the film, which premiered at the 2013 Cannes Film Festival, opening the &quot;Un Certain Regard&quot; section. It was inspired by a &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; feature on the real-life criminals depicted in the film, whom Coppola described as &quot;products of our growing reality TV culture&quot;. The film received generally positive reviews, with many praising its style and performances. While some felt that the film glamorized the crimes in the story and failed to make an assertive message about them through the narrative; &quot;Coppola neither makes a case for her characters nor places them inside of some kind of moral or critical framework; they simply pass through the frame, listing off name brands and staring at their phones&quot;.

; &quot;A Very Murray Christmas&quot; (2015)

Coppola collaborated again with her &quot;Lost in Translation&quot; star Bill Murray on &quot;A Very Murray Christmas&quot;, which stars Murray and was co-written by herself, Murray and Mitch Glazer. The film, an homage to classic Christmas-themed variety shows, was released in December 2015 on Netflix.

; &quot;The Beguiled&quot; (2017)

Coppola directed &quot;The Beguiled&quot; (2017), a remake of the 1971 eponymous Southern Gothic film, starring Nicole Kidman, Elle Fanning, and Kirsten Dunst. The film premiered at the 2017 Cannes Film Festival, where Coppola became the second woman (and the first American woman) to win the Best Director award. The film is based on the 1966 book of the same name by author Thomas P. Cullinan about a wounded Union soldier in a Mississippi seminary during the American Civil War, and was made for under $10 million. The film exhibited elements of the thriller genre, another departure for Coppola.
Coppola cited her intrigue with the South as part of the story&#x27;s appeal. Coppola has said that she &quot;wanted the film to represent an exaggerated version of all the ways women were traditionally raised there just to be lovely and cater to men—the manners of that whole world, and how they change when the men go away&quot;. Coppola has cited &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; as her inspiration for creating a film that was relatable despite its position within a different era. The film faced a wave of controversy and division, including accusations of &#x27;whitewashing&#x27; the original story after Coppola removed the supporting role of a black female slave from the film, as well as chose Kirsten Dunst to portray a character who was biracial in the original novel. Coppola also faced criticism for minimizing the story of the people experiencing actual hardship in favor of depicting, albeit authentically, the lavish lifestyle of her protagonists, thus minimizing the importance of a weighty topic. Coppola responded to these allegations by citing the presence of young girls among her movie-going audience. &quot;The Beguiled&quot; is not the only of Coppola&#x27;s films to be accused of exposing the socio-cultural affordances of her own childhood.

Coppola described her version of the film as a reinterpretation, rather than a remake, of Don Siegel&#x27;s 1971 adaption of the same book. Coppola wanted to tell the story of the male soldier entering into a classically southern and female environment from the point of view of the women and represent what that was like for them. Coppola thought that the earlier version made the characters out to be crazy caricatures and did not allow the viewer to know them. While some critics claim that Coppola intended &quot;The Beguiled&quot; as a feminist work, Coppola explained that she is not in favor of that labeling. Though she has said she is happy if others see the film in this way, she sees it as a film, rather, that possesses a female perspective—an important distinction. &quot;The Beguiled&quot; was also made as a contrast to &quot;The Bling Ring&quot;, and Coppola has explained that
she needed to correct that film&#x27;s harsh Los Angeles aesthetic with something more beautiful and poetic.

=== 2020–present ===
; &quot;On the Rocks&quot; (2020)

Coppola&#x27;s film, &quot;On the Rocks&quot;, tells the story of a daughter and father, played by Rashida Jones and Bill Murray respectively, as they explore New York together in an attempt to mend their fractured relationship. It was released in a limited theatrical release on October 2, 2020, by A24 and was released for digital streaming on October 23, 2020, by Apple TV+.

The film received positive reviews from critics, who praised Coppola&#x27;s screenplay and direction, and noted it as lighter than her previous films. Some critics stated that the film &quot;isn&#x27;t destined to achieve the same kind of iconic status as some of Coppola&#x27;s previous work&quot;.

; &quot;Fairyland&quot; (2023)

An announcement in mid-December 2013 stated that American Zoetrope had successfully attained the screen rights for the memoir &quot;Fairyland: A Memoir of My Father&quot; and that Coppola would adapt the book with Andrew Durham. Coppola would also produce the film with her brother Roman. Coppola would later drop out of directing duties while remaining herself as a producer, as Durham took over as the sole director and writer for the film.

The film, titled &quot;Fairyland&quot; and starring Emilia Jones and Scoot McNairy, premiered at the 2023 Sundance Film Festival to positive reviews.

; &quot;Priscilla&quot; (2023)

Coppola&#x27;s next film, &quot;Priscilla&quot; (2023), her eighth as a director, is based on the life of Priscilla Presley and her 1985 memoir &quot;Elvis and Me&quot;. It stars Cailee Spaeny as Priscilla and Jacob Elordi as Elvis Presley. The film is distributed by A24 and premiered at the 80th Venice International Film Festival in September 2023.

The film dives into the life of Priscilla Presley, allowing viewers to take a look into Priscilla&#x27;s relationship with Elvis Presley. Unlike the film Elvis (2022) by Baz Luhrmann, the film does not portray Elvis positively or much of his successful career. Instead, it portrays Elvis&#x27; &quot;darker, domestic side&quot;. Coppola was more interested in showing Priscilla&#x27;s side of their relationship, highlighting the terror of Elvis&#x27; physical and emotional abuse towards Priscilla.

The film received positive reviews, with &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; declaring the film to be her best since &quot;Lost in Translation&quot;. David Rooney of &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; wrote, &quot;Coppola has always been a filmmaker who coaxes out feelings rather than blasts them with emphatic declarations, and the nuanced restraint of her writing and direction here are very much points in Priscilla&#x27;s favor.&quot;

Coppola stated that she used her teenage years growing up in the Bay Area to inform her position in this role. She stated specifically about her time as a teenager, &quot;I just remember everything being epic and important and with a lot of feeling and driving around and listening to music. Your senses are more heightened or something.&quot;

==Other work==
===Television===
In the mid-1990s, Coppola and her best friend Zoe Cassavetes helmed the short-lived Comedy Central series &quot;Hi Octane&quot;, which spotlit performers in underground music. The show was cancelled after four episodes.

In December 2008, Coppola&#x27;s first commercial premiered during an episode of &quot;Gossip Girl&quot;. The advertisement she directed for the Christian Dior fragrance &quot;Miss Dior Chérie&quot;, shot in France with model Maryna Linchuk, was very well received and continues to be popular on YouTube.

In October 2014, Coppola launched a series of Christmas ads for the clothing chain Gap.

In May 2020, it was announced Coppola would write and direct an adaptation of &quot;The Custom of the Country&quot; by Edith Wharton for Apple TV+.

In 2022, Coppola guest-starred as herself, alongside her husband Thomas Mars and fellow director Jim Jarmusch, in an episode of the FX horror comedy series &quot;What We Do in the Shadows&quot;.

===Modeling===
At the beginning of the 1990s, Coppola was often featured in girl-oriented magazines like &quot;Seventeen&quot; and &quot;YM&quot;. In 1994, she co-founded the clothing line &quot;Milk Fed&quot; in Japan, with her friend Stephanie Hayman in cooperation with Sonic Youth&#x27;s Kim Gordon. In 2001, the fashion designer Marc Jacobs chose the actress/director to be the &quot;face&quot; of his house&#x27;s fragrance, Daisy. The campaign photographs of Coppola were shot by photographer Jürgen Teller. The July 2013 issue of &quot;Elle&quot; featured photographs shot by Coppola of Paris Hilton at Hilton&#x27;s Beverly Hills mansion (Both model and house appear in &quot;The Bling Ring&quot;).

===Stage direction===
In 2017, before Coppola started pre-production on &quot;The Beguiled&quot;, she was asked by Italian state broadcaster Rai Com from All&#x27;Opera to direct their latest production of &quot;La Traviata. La Traviata&quot; is a three act opera by Giuseppe Verdi set to an Italian libretto by Francesca Maria Piave. This Coppola-directed production was filmed for broadcast in Germany and France by Arte/ZDF, using multiple state-of-the art 4k cameras and up to 100 microphones. Coppola said in an interview she &quot;could not turn down the project&quot; with designer and fashion icon Valentino Garavani designing the costumes for this 15 show run of &quot;La Traviata&quot; (2017). Discussing her modern take on this classic story Coppola says &quot;I wanted to bring out the personal side of the French courtesan, the party girl used to the social scene. It&#x27;s a very feminine world that I love&quot;.

This was the first stage production Coppola directed. Coppola discusses how Valentino &quot;really motivated me to take a chance and do something that was scary for me and very unfamiliar,&quot; and promised a &quot;traditional&quot; production that could nevertheless be appreciated by those who are not opera connoisseurs. Rome Opera House Director Carlo Fuortes said in an interview ticket sales had exceeded 1.2 million euros (1.35 million dollars), a record for the establishment.

All fifteen shows nearly sold out before opening night. It was the biggest box office success since the Teatro dell&#x27;Opera Di Roma opened in 1880.

In 2024, Coppola released a line of lip balms in collaboration with skin care brand Augustinus Bader.

==Personal life==
In 1992, Coppola met director Spike Jonze; they married in 1999 and divorced in 2003. In an official statement, Coppola&#x27;s publicist explained that the divorce decision was reached &quot;with sadness&quot;. It is widely believed that the main character&#x27;s husband in &quot;Lost in Translation&quot; is based on Jonze, as Coppola stated after the film&#x27;s release, &quot;There are elements of Spike there, elements of experiences.&quot;

From 2003 to 2005 Coppola dated filmmaker Quentin Tarantino. They have remained friends since their separation.

Coppola married musician Thomas Mars on August 27, 2011, at Palazzo Margherita in Bernalda, Italy. They met while producing the soundtrack to &quot;The Virgin Suicides&quot;. They have two daughters: Romy (born November 28, 2006), whose name is an homage to Coppola&#x27;s brother Roman, and Cosima (born May 2010).

Coppola and her family lived in Paris for several years before moving to New York City in 2010.

Coppola has maintained a low public profile for her family, aiming for her daughters&#x27; lives to be unaffected by her career and travel. When asked if her choices as a parent to keep her children out of the spotlight is a result of her own upbringing, Coppola has explained that she never wants her children to be jaded.

==Awards and nominations==
Coppola was nominated for three Academy Awards for her film &quot;Lost in Translation&quot; (2003), in the categories of Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Original Screenplay. She went on to win Best Original Screenplay, losing the other two nominations to Peter Jackson&#x27;s &quot;The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King&quot;. Coppola&#x27;s nomination for Best Director made her the first American woman to be nominated in that category, and the third woman overall, after Lina Wertmüller and Jane Campion. In 2010, Kathryn Bigelow became the fourth woman to be nominated, and the first to win the award. Coppola, however, remains the youngest woman to be nominated in the category. Her win for Best Original Screenplay (along with her cousin Nicolas Cage&#x27;s 1996 win for Best Actor) resulted in her family becoming the second three-generation Oscar-winning family, with her grandfather Carmine Coppola and her father Francis Ford Coppola having previously won Oscars as well. The first family to achieve this feat was the Huston family, for wins by Walter, John, and Anjelica. For her work on &quot;Lost in Translation&quot;, Coppola also won the Golden Globe Awards for Best Motion Picture and Best Screenplay, in addition to receiving three Independent Spirit Awards and three BAFTA Award nominations.

On September 11, 2010, Coppola&#x27;s film &quot;Somewhere&quot; won the Golden Lion, the top prize at the Venice International Film Festival. Coppola became the first American woman and the fourth American filmmaker to win the award.

In 2016, Coppola&#x27;s musical comedy special &quot;A Very Murray Christmas&quot; earned her a nomination for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Television Movie.

On May 28, 2017, Coppola was awarded the Best Director Award at the Cannes Film Festival for her film &quot;The Beguiled&quot;, making her the second woman and the first American woman to win the award.

<doc id="361021" wikidata="Q2608426" url="?curid=361021" title="Electrolytic cell">
<text>An electrolytic cell is an electrochemical cell that utilizes an external source of electrical energy to force a chemical reaction that would otherwise not occur. The external energy source is a voltage applied between the cell&#x27;s two electrodes; an anode (positively charged electrode) and a cathode (negatively charged electrode), which are immersed in an electrolyte solution. This is in contrast to a galvanic cell, which itself is a source of electrical energy and the foundation of a battery. The net reaction taking place in an electrolytic cell is a non-spontaneous reaction (reverse of a spontaneous reaction), i.e., the Gibbs free energy is +ve, while the net reaction taking place in a galvanic cell is a spontaneous reaction, i.e., the Gibbs free energy is - ve.

==Principles==
In an electrolytic cell, a current passes through the cell by an external voltage, causing a non-spontaneous chemical reaction to proceed. In a galvanic cell, the progress of a spontaneous chemical reaction causes an electric current to flow. An equilibrium electrochemical cell exists in the state between an electrolytic cell and a galvanic cell. The tendency of a spontaneous reaction to push a current through the external circuit is exactly balanced by a counter-electromotive force so that no current flows. If this counter-electromotive force is increased, the cell becomes an electrolytic cell, and if it is decreased, the cell becomes a galvanic cell.

An electrolytic cell has three components: an electrolyte and two electrodes (a cathode and an anode). The electrolyte is usually a solution of water or other solvents in which ions are dissolved. Molten salts such as sodium chloride can also function as electrolytes. When driven by an external voltage applied to the electrodes, the ions in the electrolyte are attracted to an electrode with the opposite charge, where charge-transferring (also called faradaic or redox) reactions can take place. Only with an external electrical potential (i.e., voltage) of correct polarity and sufficient magnitude can an electrolytic cell decompose a normally stable, or inert chemical compound in the solution. The electrical energy provided can produce a chemical reaction that would otherwise not occur spontaneously.

Michael Faraday defined the cathode of a cell as the electrode to which cations (positively charged ions, such as silver ions Ag) flow within the cell, to be reduced by reacting with electrons (negatively charged) from that electrode. Likewise, he defined the anode as the electrode to which anions (negatively charged ions, like chloride ions Cl) flow within the cell, to be oxidized by depositing electrons on the electrode. To an external wire connected to the electrodes of a galvanic cell (or battery), forming an electric circuit, the cathode is positive and the anode is negative. Thus positive electric current flows from the cathode to the anode through the external circuit in the case of a galvanic cell.

==Applications==

Electrolytic cells are often used to decompose chemical compounds, in a process called electrolysis—with &quot;electro&quot; meaning &quot;electricity&quot; and the Greek word &quot;lysis&quot; means &quot;to break up&quot;. Important examples of electrolysis are the decomposition of water into hydrogen and oxygen, and bauxite into aluminum and other chemicals. Electroplating (e.g., of copper, silver, nickel, or chromium) is done using an electrolytic cell. Electrolysis is a technique that uses a direct electric current (DC).

Commercially, electrolytic cells are used in the electrorefining and electrowinning of several non-ferrous metals. Most high-purity aluminum, copper, zinc, and lead are produced industrially in electrolytic cells.

As already noted, water, particularly when ions are added (saltwater or acidic water), can be &quot;electrolyzed&quot; (subjected to electrolysis). When driven by an external source of voltage, hydrogen (H) ions flow to the cathode to combine with electrons to produce hydrogen gas in a reduction reaction. Likewise, hydroxide (OH) ions flow to the anode to release electrons and a hydrogen (H) ion to produce oxygen gas in an oxidation reaction.

In molten sodium chloride (NaCl), when a current is passed through the salt the anode oxidizes chloride ions (Cl) to chlorine gas, it releases electrons to the anode. Likewise, the cathode reduces sodium ions (Na), which accepts electrons from the cathode and deposits them on the cathode as sodium metal.

Sodium chloride that has been dissolved in water can also be electrolyzed. The anode oxidizes the chloride ions (Cl), and produces chlorine (Cl2) gas. However, at the cathode, instead of sodium ions being reduced to sodium metal, water molecules are reduced to hydroxide ions (OH) and hydrogen gas (H2). The overall result of the electrolysis is the production of chlorine gas, hydrogen gas, and aqueous sodium hydroxide (NaOH) solution.

<text>Sinaia () is a town and a mountain resort in Prahova County, Romania. It is situated in the historical region of Muntenia. The town was named after the Sinaia Monastery of 1695, around which it was built. The monastery, in turn, is named after the Biblical Mount Sinai. King Carol I of Romania also built his summer residence, Peleș Castle, in Sinaia in the late nineteenth century.

Sinaia is about northwest of Ploiești and south of Brașov, in a mountainous area on the Prahova River valley, just east of the Bucegi Mountains. The town&#x27;s altitude varies between above sea level.

The city is a popular destination for hiking and winter sports, especially downhill skiing. Among the tourist landmarks, the most important are Peleș Castle, Pelișor Castle, Sinaia Monastery, Sinaia Casino, Sinaia train station, and the Franz Joseph and Saint Anne Cliffs. Sinaia was also the summer residence of the Romanian composer George Enescu, who stayed at the Luminiș villa.
==Climate==
Sinaia has a warm-summer humid continental climate (&quot;Dfb&quot; in the Köppen climate classification).

Summers are bracing and very rainy at the beginning of the season. Winters are moderately cold, with heavy snow.

A uniform layer of snow is deposited usually in November and it melts from March to April, sometimes at the beginning of May. The thickness of the snow layer varies between and in higher elevations.

In recent years, Sinaia has felt the effects of global climate change.

==Nature preservation==
In the town of Sinaia and its surroundings restrictions are in place regarding cutting down or picking flora. The felling of trees is not allowed. It is forbidden to pick any alpine plants. Severe punishments are enforced for anyone who gathers : the Mountain Peony (&quot;Rhododendron Kotsky&quot;), Edelweiss (&quot;Leontopodium alpinum&quot;), and the Yellow Gentiana (&quot;Gentiana lutea&quot;). Tourist camping is only authorized in designated places, following necessary and compulsory protection standards.

The mountainous area in which Sinaia is located is in the Bucegi Natural Park region. The Park covers a total area of , of which are under strict protection and contain natural monuments. The Bucegi Natural Preserve area includes all the most precipitous areas of the mountains Vârful cu Dor, Furnica, and Piatra Arsă. The mountainous area is continuously patrolled by mountain rescue patrols as well as by members of the Mountain Police.

At the entrance to the Cumpătu district, one can find the “Sinaia alder-tree grove” botanical reservation placed under the protection of the Romanian Academy and the Bucharest Biology Institute. In the same district, there is also another ecological research station under the patronage of UNESCO – Jacques-Yves Cousteau, belonging to the University of Bucharest, which also includes a museum of Bucegi Mountains fauna.

== Sinaia Forever Festival ==
Sinaia Forever, or the Autumn Festival, is one of the main festivals that takes place in Sinaia. The goal of the festival is to recreate the atmosphere of the 1940s while bringing in modern performers. The festival once took place during the last weekend of September, but was just recently changed to the first weekend of the month. During the festival, the downtown area of Sinaia is closed off to motorized vehicles. It becomes full of people, food stands, and children&#x27;s rides. The three-day festival consists of the opening parade, concerts from well known musical artists of Romania, and amusement rides.

== Eagles of Freedom Plaza == 

The Eagles of Freedom Plaza () is a square inaugurated in 2015, dedicated to honoring the memory of 378 American soldiers who lost their lives in Romania during World War II. At the heart of the plaza stands the &quot;Book of Americans&quot;, a marble monument inscribed with the names of these fallen soldiers. Originally created in 1999, the monument was previously located on the outskirts of the Heroes Cemetery but has since been relocated to this new, more prominent site. A commemorative plaque is also present, honoring the heroic sacrifice of the American soldiers and celebrating the historic bonds of friendship between the Romanian and American people. The inauguration of the plaza was attended by Sinaia&#x27;s Mayor, Vlad Oprea, the United States Defense Attaché to Romania, Colonel Paul T. Matier, and the Dutch Ambassador to Bucharest, Mr. Matthijs van Bonzel.

==International relations==
Sinaia is twinned with:
* Aosta, Italy
* Cetinje, Montenegro
* Hod HaSharon, Israel
* Cascais, Portugal
* Thame, United Kingdom
* Kuşadası, Turkey
* Athis-Mons, France

==Notable residents==
* George Enescu
* Romanian Royal family
* Claudiu David

<text>The men&#x27;s rights movement (MRM) is a branch of the men&#x27;s movement. The MRM in particular consists of a variety of groups and individuals known as men&#x27;s rights activists (MRAs) who focus on social issues, such as specific government services, which adversely impact, or in some cases, structurally discriminate against, men and boys. Common topics discussed within the men&#x27;s rights movement include family law, such as child custody, alimony and marital property distribution; reproduction; suicide; domestic violence against men; false accusations of rape; circumcision; education; conscription; social safety nets; and health policies. The men&#x27;s rights movement branched off from the men&#x27;s liberation movement in the early 1970s, with both groups comprising a part of the larger men&#x27;s movement.

Many scholars describe the movement or parts of the movement as a backlash against feminism. Sectors of the men&#x27;s rights movement have been described by some scholars and commentators as misogynistic, hateful, and, in some cases, as advocating violence against women. In 2018, the Southern Poverty Law Center categorized some men&#x27;s rights groups as being part of a hate ideology under the umbrella of male supremacy while stating that others &quot;focused on legitimate grievances&quot;. In 2024, UN Women claimed that men&#x27;s rights movements as a whole are anti-rights movements.

==History==
===Forerunners===
The term &quot;men&#x27;s rights&quot; was used at least as early as February 1856 when it appeared in &quot;Putnam&#x27;s Magazine&quot;. The author was responding to the issue of women&#x27;s rights, calling it a &quot;new movement for social reform, and even for political revolution&quot;, which the author proposed to counter with men&#x27;s rights. Ernest Belfort Bax wrote &quot;The Legal Subjection of Men&quot; in 1896, deriding the women&#x27;s rights movement as a farcical effort by women—the &quot;privileged sex&quot;—to prove they were &quot;oppressed.&quot;

Three loosely connected men&#x27;s rights organizations formed in Austria in the interwar period. The &quot;League for Men&#x27;s Rights&quot; was founded in 1926 with the goal of &quot;combating all excesses of women&#x27;s emancipation&quot;. In 1927, the &quot;Justitia League for Family Law Reform&quot; and the &quot;Aequitas World&#x27;s League for the Rights of Men&quot; split from the &quot;League of Men&#x27;s Rights&quot;. The three men&#x27;s rights groups opposed women&#x27;s entry into the labor market and what they saw as the corrosive influence of the women&#x27;s movement on social and legal institutions. They criticized marriage and family laws, especially the requirement to pay spousal and child support to former wives and illegitimate children, and supported the use of blood tests to determine paternity. &quot;Justitia&quot; and &quot;Aequitas&quot; issued their own short-lived journals &quot;Men&#x27;s Rightists Newspaper&quot; and &quot;Self-Defense&quot; where they expressed their views that were heavily influenced by the works of Heinrich Schurtz, Otto Weininger, and Jörg Lanz von Liebenfels. The organizations ceased to exist before 1939.

===Split from men&#x27;s liberation movement===
The modern men&#x27;s rights movement emerged from the men&#x27;s liberation movement, which appeared in the first half of the 1970s when scholars began to study feminist ideas and politics. These scholars acknowledged men&#x27;s institutionalized power while critically examining the consequences of hegemonic masculinity, believing that both men and women suffered in a patriarchal society. The men&#x27;s liberation movement was led by psychologists who argued that femininity and masculinity were socially formed behaviors and not the result of genes. They tried to balance the two ideas that men were responsible for oppressing women, but also being oppressed themselves by strict gender roles.In the mid-1970s, this movement began to focus on the oppression of men and less on the effects of sexism on women. In the late 1970s, the movement split into two separate strands with opposing views: the pro-feminist men&#x27;s movement and the anti-feminist men&#x27;s rights movement, which sees men as an oppressed group.In the 1980s, the men&#x27;s rights movement focused only on the ways that sex roles discriminated against males rather than the oppression it inflicted on both genders. Author Herb Goldberg claimed that the U.S. was a &quot;matriarchal society&quot; because women have the power to transgress gender roles and assume masculine and feminine roles, while males are still constrained to the purely masculine role. Reneé Blank and Sandra Slipp in 1994 compiled the testimonies of men who believed they were discriminated against based on their sex and race. This occurred in a time where women were entering the work force and obtaining managerial positions.A major concern of the men&#x27;s rights movement has been the issue of fathers&#x27; rights. In the 1980s and 1990s, men&#x27;s rights activists opposed societal changes sought by feminists and defended the patriarchal gender order in the family, schools and the workplace. Sociologist Michael Kimmel states that their earlier critiques of gender roles &quot;morphed into a celebration of all things masculine and a near infatuation with the traditional masculine role itself&quot;.

===Organizations===
One of the first major men&#x27;s rights organizations was the Coalition of American Divorce Reform Elements, founded by Richard Doyle in 1971, from which the Men&#x27;s Rights Association spun off in 1973. Free Men Inc. was founded in 1977 in Columbia, Maryland, spawning several chapters over the following years, which eventually merged to form the National Coalition of Free Men (known since 2008 as the National Coalition for Men). Men&#x27;s Rights, Inc. was also formed in 1977, the National Organization for Men was founded in 1983, and Fathers and Families was formed in 1994. In the United Kingdom, a men&#x27;s rights group calling itself the UK Men&#x27;s Movement began to organize in the early 1990s. The Save Indian Family Foundation (SIFF) was founded in 2005, and in 2010 claimed to have over 30,000 members.

Men&#x27;s rights groups have formed in some European countries during periods of shifts toward conservatism and policies supporting patriarchal family and gender relations. In the United States, the men&#x27;s rights movement has ideological ties to neoconservatism. Men&#x27;s rights activists have received lobbying support from conservative organizations and their arguments have been covered extensively in neoconservative media.

Fringe political parties focusing on men&#x27;s rights have been formed including, but not limited to, the Australian Non-Custodial Parents Party (Equal Parenting), the Israeli Man&#x27;s Rights in the Family Party, and the Justice for Men and Boys party in the UK.

===Online presence===
The men&#x27;s rights movement has become more vocal and more organized since the development of the Internet, where activists tend to congregate. Men&#x27;s rights websites and forums have proliferated within the online manosphere. While some of the groups have adversarial relationships with one another, they tend to be united in their misogyny, promotion of masculinity, and opposition to feminism.

Men&#x27;s rights proponents often use the red pill and blue pill metaphor from the film &quot;The Matrix&quot; to identify each other online; those who accept the idea that men are the oppressed victims of a misandrist society are said to have &quot;taken the red pill&quot;. Paul Elam&#x27;s site &quot;A Voice for Men&quot; (AVFM) functions as a central point of discussion and organization for men&#x27;s rights issues. Other sites dedicated to men&#x27;s rights are &quot;Fathers Rights Foundation&quot; &quot;MGTOW.com&quot; (Men Going Their Own Way), and several Reddit forums such as /r/MensRights and /r/TheRedPill.

==Ideology==
Many scholars consider the men&#x27;s rights movement a backlash or countermovement to feminism.
The men&#x27;s rights movement generally incorporates points of view that reject feminist and profeminist ideas. Men&#x27;s rights activists (MRAs) say feminism has surpassed its original goals and is now harming men. MRAs believe that men are victims of feminism and &quot;feminizing&quot; influences in society, and that entities such as public institutions now discriminate against men.

Men&#x27;s rights activists argue that society has historically benefited women and femininity at the expense of men, an idea termed gynocentrism. MRAs believe that patriarchy is a feminist myth and that feminism creates unfair advantages for women, causing men to become a disadvantaged group. They argue that men are not only oppressed, but also degraded and vilified; this idea of misandry or hatred of men is commonly used by MRAs to dispute feminist accusations of misogyny. Feminism is portrayed as having degenerated from its original purpose as a movement for basic equality into an outlet for vindictive, irrational women to gain power and express their hatred of men. 

MRAs dispute that men as a group have institutional power and privilege and believe that men are victimized relative to women, including in regard to what had been considered feminist concerns, such as domestic violence, pornography, prostitution, and sexism in mass media. The movement is divided between those who consider sexism equally harmful to both men and women and those who view men as disadvantaged relative to women, who benefit from &quot;female privilege&quot;.

Men&#x27;s rights groups generally reject the notion that feminism is interested in men&#x27;s problems, and some men&#x27;s rights activists have viewed the women&#x27;s movement as a plot to deliberately conceal discrimination against men and promote gynocentrism. Warren Farrell and Herb Goldberg have argued that women hold the true power in society through their roles as the primary caregivers of children, and that male power is an illusion.

Sociologist Michael Messner states that the early men&#x27;s rights movement &quot;appropriates the symmetrical language of sex roles&quot; first used by feminists, which implies a false balance of institutional power between men and women. Masculinities scholar Jonathan A. Allan described the men&#x27;s rights movement as a reactionary movement that is defined by its opposition to women and feminism but has not yet formulated its own theories and methodologies outside of antifeminism.

==Topics==
Men&#x27;s rights proponents are concerned with a wide variety of matters, some of which have spawned their own groups or movements, such as the fathers&#x27; rights movement, concerned specifically with divorce and child custody issues. Some, if not all, men&#x27;s rights issues stem from gender roles and, according to sociologist Allan G. Johnson, patriarchy.

===Adoption===
Men&#x27;s rights activists seek to expand the rights of unwed fathers in case of their child&#x27;s adoption. Warren Farrell argues that in failing to inform the father of a pregnancy, an expectant mother deprives an adopted child of a relationship with the biological father. He proposes that women be legally required to make every reasonable effort to notify the father of her pregnancy within four to five days. In response, philosopher James P. Sterba agrees that, for moral reasons, a woman should inform the father of the pregnancy and adoption, but this should not be imposed as a legal requirement as it might result in undue pressure, for example, to have an abortion.

===Anti-dowry laws===
Men&#x27;s rights organizations such as Save Indian Family Foundation (SIFF) say that women misuse legislation meant to protect them from dowry death and bride burnings. SIFF is a men&#x27;s rights organization in India that focuses on abuse of anti-dowry laws against men. SIFF has campaigned to abolish Section 498A of the Indian Penal Code, which penalizes cruelty by husbands (and the husband&#x27;s family) in pursuit of dowry or for driving a wife to suicide. SIFF states anti-dowry laws are regularly being abused to settle petty disputes in marriage and that they regularly receive calls from many men who allege their wives have used false dowry claims to imprison them.

===Child custody===
Family law is an area of deep concern among men&#x27;s rights groups. Men&#x27;s rights adherents argue that the legal system and family courts discriminate against men, especially in regards to child custody after divorce. They believe that men do not have the same contact rights or equitable shared parenting rights as their ex-spouse and use statistics on custody awards as evidence of judicial bias against men. Men&#x27;s rights advocates seek to change the legal climate for men through changes in family law, for example by lobbying for laws that make joint custody the default custody arrangement except in cases where one parent is unfit or unwilling to parent. They have appropriated the feminist rhetoric of &quot;rights&quot; and &quot;equality&quot; in their discourse, framing child custody as a matter of basic civil rights. Men&#x27;s rights activists argue that the lack of contact with their children makes fathers less willing to pay child support. Others cite the discredited parental alienation syndrome (PAS) or parental alienation as a reason to grant custody to fathers; they claim that mothers alienate children from their fathers and make false accusations of abuse in order to seek revenge against fathers.Scholars and critics assert that empirical research does not support the notion of a judicial bias against men and that men&#x27;s rights advocates distort statistics in a way that ignores the fact that the majority of men do not seek custody, and the overwhelming majority of custody cases are settled outside of court.

Academics critique the rhetorical framing of custody decisions, stating that men&#x27;s rights advocates appeal for &quot;equal rights&quot; without ever specifying the legal rights they believe have been violated. Scholars and critics assert that the men&#x27;s rights rhetoric of children&#x27;s &quot;needs&quot; that accompanies their plea for fathers&#x27; rights is merely to deflect criticism that they are motivated by self-interest and masks men&#x27;s rights advocates&#x27; own claims. Critics argue that abusive men use allegations of parental alienation to counter mothers&#x27; legitimate concerns about their and their chlldren&#x27;s safety. Deborah Rhode argues that, contrary to the claims of some men&#x27;s rights activists, research shows that joint legal custody does &quot;not&quot; increase the likelihood that fathers will pay child support or remain involved parents. Michael Flood argues that the fathers&#x27; and men&#x27;s rights movement seems to prioritize re-establishing paternal authority over the children, rather than actual involvement, and that they prioritize principles of equality over the positive parenting and well-being of the children.

===Circumcision===

Observers have stated that the &#x27;intactivist&#x27; movement, an anti-circumcision movement, has some overlap with the men&#x27;s rights movement. Most men&#x27;s rights activists object to routine neonatal circumcision and say that female genital mutilation has received more attention than male circumcision.

The controversy around non-consensual circumcision of children for non-therapeutic reasons is not exclusive to the men&#x27;s rights movement, and involves concerns of feminists and medical ethics. Some doctors and academics have argued that circumcision is a violation of the right to health and bodily integrity, while others have disagreed.

===Divorce===
Men&#x27;s rights groups in the United States began organizing in opposition to divorce reform and custody issues around the 1960s. Up until this time, husbands held legal power and control over wives and children. The men involved in the early organization claimed that family and divorce law discriminated against them and favored their wives. Men&#x27;s rights leader Rich Doyle likened divorce courts to slaughterhouses, considering their judgements unsympathetic and unreasonable.

Men&#x27;s rights activists have argued that divorce and custody laws violate men&#x27;s individual rights to equal protection. Law professor Gwendolyn Leachman writes that this sort of framing &quot;downplays the systemic biases that women face that justify protective divorce and custody laws&quot;.

===Domestic violence===

Men&#x27;s rights groups describe domestic violence committed by women against men as a problem that goes ignored, under-reported, and under-researched, in part because men are reluctant to label themselves as victims. They say that women are as aggressive or more aggressive than men in relationships and that domestic violence is gender-symmetrical. They cite controversial family conflict research by Murray Straus and Richard Gelles as evidence of gender symmetry. Men&#x27;s rights advocates argue that judicial systems too easily accept false allegations of domestic violence by women against male partners. Men&#x27;s rights advocates have been critics of legal, policy and practical protections for abused women, campaigning for domestic violence shelters for battered men and for the legal system to be educated about women&#x27;s violence against men. In the early 21st or late 20th century, the National Coalition for Free Men sued the Minnesota state, calling for funding to women&#x27;s domestic violence programmes to be removed under the idea that they &quot;discriminate against men&quot;.

In response to such claims, family violence scholar Richard Gelles published an article entitled &quot;Domestic Violence: Not An Even Playing Field&quot; and accused the men&#x27;s rights movement of distorting his research findings on men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s violence to promote a misogynistic agenda. Many domestic violence scholars and advocates have rejected the research cited by men&#x27;s rights activists as flawed, disputing their claims that such violence is gender symmetrical, saying that their focus on women&#x27;s violence stems from a political agenda to minimize the severity of the problem of men&#x27;s violence against women and children and to undermine services to abused women.

===Education===

Men&#x27;s rights adherents describe the education of boys as being in crisis, with boys having reduced educational achievement and motivation compared to girls. Advocates blame the influence of feminism on education for what they believe is discrimination against and systematic oppression of boys in the education system. They critique what they describe as the &quot;feminization&quot; of education, stating that the predominance of female teachers, a focus on girls&#x27; needs, as well as a curricula and assessment methods that supposedly favour girls, have proved repressive and restrictive to men and boys.

Men&#x27;s rights groups call for increased recognition of masculinity, greater numbers of male role models, more competitive sports, and the increased responsibilities for boys in the school setting. They have also advocated clearer school routines, more traditional school structures, including gender-segregated classrooms, and stricter discipline.

One primary characteristic of men&#x27;s rights groups is the view of boys as a homogeneous group that shares common educational experiences; this means that it fails to account for how responses to educational approaches may differ by age, disability, culture, ethnicity, sexuality, religion, and class.

In Australia, men&#x27;s rights discourse has influenced government policy documents. Compared to Australia, less impact has been noted in the United Kingdom, where feminists have historically had less influence on educational policy. However, Mary Curnock Cook, the British Universities and Colleges Admissions Service (UCAS) chief executive, argued that in Britain &quot;despite the clear evidence and despite the press coverage, there is a deafening policy silence on the issue. Has the women&#x27;s movement now become so normalised that we cannot conceive of needing to take positive action to secure equal education outcomes for boys?&quot;

===Governmental structures===
Men&#x27;s rights groups have called for governmental structures to address issues specific to men and boys including education, health, work and marriage. Men&#x27;s rights groups in India have called for the creation of a Men&#x27;s Welfare Ministry and a National Commission for Men, or for the abolition of the National Commission for Women. In the United Kingdom, the creation of a Minister for Men analogous to the existing Minister for Women, has been proposed by David Amess, MP and Lord Northbourne, but was rejected by the government headed by Prime Minister Tony Blair. In the United States, Warren Farrell heads a commission focused on the creation of a White House Council on Boys and Men as a counterpart to the White House Council on Women and Girls, which was formed in March 2009.

===Health===
Men&#x27;s rights groups view the health issues faced by men, and their shorter life spans compared to women globally, as evidence of discrimination and oppression. They claim that feminism has led to women&#x27;s health issues being privileged at the expense of men&#x27;s. They highlight certain disparities in funding of men&#x27;s health issues as compared to women&#x27;s, stating that, for example, prostate cancer research receives less funding than breast-cancer research. However, women and minorities had typically been excluded from medical research until the 1990s. Viviana Simon states, &quot;Most biomedical and clinical research has been based on the assumption that the male can serve as representative of the species.&quot; Medical scholars warn that such false assumptions are still prevalent. Contrary to antifeminist assertions, empirical findings suggest that gender bias against females remains the norm in medicine. Farrell argues that industrialization raised the stress level of men while lowering the stress-level of women by pulling men away from the home and the family, and pushing women closer to home and family. He cites this an explanation why men are more likely to die from all 15 leading causes of death than women at all ages. He argues that the U.S. government having an Office of Research on Women&#x27;s Health but no Office of Research on Men&#x27;s Health, along with the U.S. federal government spending twice as much money on Women&#x27;s health, shows that society considers men more disposable than women.

Scholars have critiqued these claims, stating, as Michael Messner puts it, that the poorer health outcomes are the heavy costs paid by men &quot;for conformity with the narrow definitions of masculinity that promise to bring them status and privilege&quot; and that these costs fall disproportionately on men who are marginalized socially and economically. According to Michael Flood, men&#x27;s health would best be improved by &quot;tackling destructive notions of manhood, an economic system which values profit and productivity over workers&#x27; health, and the ignorance of service providers&quot;, instead of blaming a feminist health movement. Genevieve Creighton &amp; John L Oliffe have stated that men engage in positive health practices, such as reducing fat intake and alcohol, to conform to positive masculine ideals. Some have argued that biology contributes to the life-expectancy gap. For example, it has been found that females consistently outlive males among primates. Eunuchs, castrated before puberty, have shown to live with varying differences, more than other males, pointing to testosterone levels playing a role in the life-expectancy gap. Luy and Gast found that the female–male life expectancy gap is primarily due to higher mortality rates among specific sub-populations of men. They therefore state that social programs should be narrowly targeted to those sub-populations, rather than to men as a whole.

===Homelessness===
Glen Poole, author of the book &quot;Equality For Men&quot;, argues that homelessness is a gendered issue, saying that in Britain, most homeless people are male. A 2018 study focused on three Pennsylvania emergency departments found little difference in the number of men and women who self-reported as homeless; however, the study did not claim to reflect the homeless population in the United States as a whole. In 2022, most homeless individuals were male. Men are also more likely to be unsheltered than women, this may be partly due to the administrators of the homelessness system prioritizing vulnerability, age, or risk of violence over serving men and women equally. But, many reasons are found outside the homelessness system, like men being over-represented in the criminal justice system and more likely to drop out of school than women. For information on the homeless population of the United States as a whole, see Homelessness in the United States.

===Incarceration===
Men&#x27;s rights campaigners believe that men receive harsher treatment than women in criminal justice systems around the world. They cite the disproportionate number of men in prison as evidence of this. In the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, India and across the European Union, 90–95% of prison inmates are male. Studies have shown that, compared with women who commit similar crimes, men are more likely to be incarcerated, receive longer prison sentences, and have to serve a greater portion of their sentences. According to Warren Farrell, a man convicted of murder in the United States is twenty times more likely to receive a death sentence than a woman convicted of murder. There is also evidence that female sex offenders are treated with more leniency than their male counterparts. Farrell believes society considers women to be naturally more innocent and credible, and criticizes battered woman and infanticide defenses. He criticizes conditions in men&#x27;s prisons and the lack of attention to prison male-to-male rape by authorities.

===Military conscription===

Men&#x27;s rights activists argue that the sole military conscription of men is an example of discrimination against men. Historically, most societies have only required men to be conscripted. According to David Benatar, &quot;perhaps the most obvious example of male disadvantage is the long history of social and legal pressures on men, but not on women, to enter the military and to fight in war, thereby risking their lives and bodily and psychological health. Where the pressure to join the military has taken the form of conscription, the costs of avoidance have been self-imposed exile, imprisonment, physical assault or, in the most extreme circumstances, execution.&quot; Around 80 countries worldwide still use conscription in various forms, and most of these have a male-only draft. As of 2018, only two countries – Norway and Sweden – required women to be conscripted under the same formal conditions as men.

In the United States, all males ages 18–25 are required to register for Selective Service. Failure to do so can result in fines, imprisonment, and ineligibility for student loans and federal employment. Women are not required to register. In 1971, draft resisters in the United States initiated a class-action suit alleging that male-only conscription violated men&#x27;s rights to equal protection under the US constitution. When the case, &quot;Rostker v. Goldberg&quot;, reached the Supreme Court in 1981, they were supported by a men&#x27;s rights group and multiple feminist groups, including the National Organization for Women. However, the Supreme Court upheld the Military Selective Service Act, stating that &quot;the argument for registering women was based on considerations of equity, but Congress was entitled, in the exercise of its constitutional powers, to focus on the question of military need, rather than &#x27;equity&#x27;&quot;. The 2016 decision by Defense Secretary Ash Carter to make all combat positions open to women relaunched debate over whether or not women should be required to register for the Selective Service System. In the case &quot;National Coalition for Men v. Selective Service System&quot;, the Southern District Court of Texas ruled the male-only draft unconstitutional.

===Paternity fraud===

Men&#x27;s and fathers&#x27; rights groups interest in &quot;paternity fraud&quot; or mistaken paternity falls into two main categories: men who are compelled to provide financial support for a child that has been proven by DNA testing not to be their biological offspring, and men who have been led to believe that the children they are raising are their own, and have subsequently discovered otherwise. They hold biological views of fatherhood, emphasizing the imperative of the genetic foundation of paternity rather than social aspects of fatherhood. They state that men should not be forced to support children fathered by another man, and that men are harmed because a relationship is created between a man and non-biological children while denying the children and their biological father of that experience and knowledge of their genetic history. In addition, they say non-biological fathers are denied the resources to have their own biological children in another relationship.

Men&#x27;s rights activists support the use of one-parent consent paternity testing to reassure presumed fathers about the child&#x27;s paternity; men&#x27;s and fathers&#x27; rights groups have also called for compulsory paternity testing of all children. They have campaigned vigorously in support of men who have been shown by genetic testing not to be the biological father, but who are nevertheless required to be financially responsible for them. Prompted by these concerns, legislators in certain jurisdictions have supported this biological view and have passed laws providing relief from child support payments when a man is proved not to be the father. Australian men&#x27;s rights groups have opposed the recommendations of a report by the Australian Law Reform Commission and the National Health and Medical Research Council that would require the informed consent of both parents for paternity testing of young children, and laws that would make it illegal to obtain a sample for DNA testing without the individual&#x27;s informed consent.

Estimates of the extent of misattributed paternity vary considerably. Some campaigners claim that between 10% and 30% of children are being parented by men who are unaware that they are not the biological father, but Professor Leslie Cannold writes that these numbers have been inflated by an order of magnitude, with about 1% seen in Australia and the UK, and 3% observed in the US. Sociologist Michael Gilding asserts that men&#x27;s rights activists have exaggerated the rate and extent of misattributed paternity, which he estimates at about 1–3%. Gilding opposed as unnecessary calls for mandatory paternity testing of all children. Even the lowest estimates of the prevalence of paternity fraud suggest it affects tens of thousands of men in the US alone.

===Rape===

====False accusations against men====

Men&#x27;s rights activists believe there are a significant number of false accusations of rape, and have proposed legal changes to protect men in those situations.

Men&#x27;s rights proponents believe that the naming of the accused while providing the accuser (victim) with anonymity encourages abuse of this kind. Men&#x27;s rights advocates have also claimed that rape &quot;has been used as a scam.&quot; Studies from the United States, Australia, and the Britain have found the percentage of estimated false or unsubstantiated rape allegations to be around 2% to 8%. 

Whilst false accusations of rape often receive much online and media attention, the vast majority do not lead to conviction or wrongful jail time despite the claims of some organisations. A study from the British Home Office for example, shows that in the early 2000s, of 216 sexual assault cases that were classified as false allegations, only six led to an arrest and just two led to charges against the accused before ultimately being ruled as false. 

To argue the issue of false accusations of rape, the categories of &#x27;false&#x27; and &#x27;unsubstantiated&#x27; are often conflated, such as the National Coalition for Men citing reports such as the 1996 FBI summary that finds a rate of 8% for unsubstantiated forcible rape, which is four times higher than the average for all index crimes as a whole. Experts emphasize that &quot;verified&quot; false allegations are a distinct category from unsubstantiated allegations, and conflating the two is fallacious. These figures are widely debated due to the questionable methodology and small sample sizes.

====Sexual violence against men====

Men&#x27;s rights activists have also raised contention on the issue of sexual violence against men, especially in the context of the stigma surrounding male victims of rape and the legal troubles they face, including being counter-sued for rape, child support (see Hermesmann v. Seyer), and lack of action. Men&#x27;s rights activists have also criticized the lack of attention towards prison male-to-male rape by authorities.

====Criminalization of marital rape====

Legislation and judicial decisions criminalizing marital rape are opposed by some men&#x27;s rights groups in the United Kingdom, the United States and India. The reasons for opposition include concerns about false allegations related to divorce proceedings, and the belief that sex within marriage is an irrevocable part of the institution of marriage. In India, there has been anxiety about relationships and the future of marriage that such laws have given women &quot;grossly disproportional rights&quot;. Virag Dhulia of the Save Indian Family Foundation, a men&#x27;s rights organization, has opposed recent efforts to criminalize marital rape in India, arguing that &quot;no relationship will work if these rules are enforced&quot;.

====Critique of men&#x27;s rights rape discourse====

Feminist scholars Lise Gotell and Emily Dutton argue that content on the manosphere reveals anti-feminist arguments, including that sexual violence is a gender-neutral problem, feminists are responsible for erasing men&#x27;s experiences of victimization, false allegations are widespread, and that rape culture is a feminist-produced moral panic. They contend it is important to engage [this topic] as there is a real danger that MRA (Men&#x27;s Rights Activism) claims could come to define the popular conversation about sexual violence.

===Reproductive rights===

Men&#x27;s rights campaigners assert that while a woman has several legal avenues to opt out of being a mother after conception (abortion, adoption, safe haven laws), a man has no choice in whether he becomes a father and is at the mercy of the mother&#x27;s decision. Moreover, a man who fathers a child as a result of reproductive coercion or a sexual assault by a woman can still be compelled to support the child financially. Cases in Kansas, California and Arizona have established that a male raped as a minor by a woman can be held legally responsible for a child that results from the assault, a situation the director of the National Center for Men described as &quot;off-the-charts ridiculous&quot; that &quot;wouldn&#x27;t be tolerated&quot; if the genders were reversed. According to Warren Farrell, &quot;&quot;Roe v. Wade&quot; gave women the vote over their bodies. Men still don&#x27;t have the vote over theirs—whether in love or war.&quot;

In consequence, some advocate for &quot;paper abortion&quot;, which would allow the biological father, before the birth of the child, to opt out of any rights, privileges, and responsibilities toward the child, including financial support.

In 2006, the American National Center for Men backed &quot;Dubay v. Wells&quot;, a lawsuit which concerned whether men should have the opportunity to decline all paternity rights and responsibilities in the event of an unplanned pregnancy. Supporters argued that this would allow the woman time to make an informed decision and give men the same reproductive rights as women. The case and the appeal were dismissed, with the U.S. Court of Appeals (Sixth Circuit) stating that neither parent has the right to sever their financial responsibilities for a child and that &quot;Dubay&#x27;s claim that a man&#x27;s right to disclaim fatherhood would be analogous to a woman&#x27;s right to abortion rests upon a false analogy&quot;.

===Social security and insurance===
Men&#x27;s rights groups argue that women are given superior social security and tax benefits than men. Warren Farrell states that men in the United States pay more into social security, but in total, women receive more in benefits, and that discrimination against men in insurance and pensions have gone unrecognized.

===Suicide===

Men&#x27;s rights activists point to higher suicide rates in men compared to women. In the United States for example, the male-to-female suicide death ratio varies, approximately, between 3:1 and 10:1, and some studies have shown a higher suicidal intent in men.

In Australia, 75% of suicides are male, with, on average, 6 men killing themselves each day.

Studies have also found an over-representation of women in attempted or incomplete suicides and men in complete suicides. This phenomenon, described as the &quot;gender paradox in suicide,&quot; is argued to derive from a tendency for females to use less lethal methods and greater male access and use of lethal methods.

==Prominent men&#x27;s rights activists==

Most men&#x27;s rights activists in the United States are white, middle-class, heterosexual men. Prominent advocates include Warren Farrell, Herb Goldberg, Richard Doyle, and Asa Baber. There are also women in the movement, including Helen Smith, Christina Hoff Sommers, Erin Pizzey and Bettina Arndt.

===Karen DeCrow===

Karen DeCrow was an American attorney, author, and activist and feminist, who served as president of the National Organization for Women from 1974 to 1977, she was also a strong supporter of equal rights for men in child custody decisions, arguing for a &quot;rebuttable presumption&quot; of shared custody after divorce. She also asserted that men as well as women should be allowed the decision not to become a parent, and was an avid supporter of father&#x27;s rights movements, and argued that domestic violence is a &quot;two-way street.&quot; As a result, DeCrow found she was &quot;increasingly at odds with the organization she had once led, though she never broke with it.&quot;

===Marc Angelucci===

Marc Angelucci was an American attorney, men&#x27;s rights activist, and the vice-president of the National Coalition for Men (NCFM). As a lawyer, he represented several cases related to men&#x27;s rights issues, most prominently &quot;National Coalition for Men v. Selective Service System&quot;, in which the federal judge declared the male-only selective-service system unconstitutional, and &quot;Woods v. Horton&quot;, which ruled that the California State Legislature had unconstitutionally excluded men from domestic violence victim protection programs.

===Warren Farrell===

Warren Farrell is an American educator, activist and author of seven books on men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s issues.

Farrell initially came to prominence in the 1970s as a supporter of second wave feminism; he served on the New York City Board of the National Organization for Women (NOW). Generally considered the &#x27;Father of Men&#x27;s Rights Movement,&#x27;&quot; Farrell advocates for &quot;a gender liberation movement, with &quot;both sexes walking a mile in each other&#x27;s moccasins.&quot;

===Herb Goldberg===

Herb Goldberg was the author of the book &quot;What Men Still Don&#x27;t Know About Women, Relationships, and Love&quot;,&quot;The Hazards of Being Male: Surviving the Myth of Masculine Privilege&quot; (1975), and &quot;What Men Really Want&quot; and &quot;Men&#x27;s Secrets&quot; related to the formative men&#x27;s movement. He was a professor emeritus of psychology at California State University, Los Angeles and a practicing psychologist in Los Angeles.

===Erin Pizzey===
Erin Pizzey is an English men&#x27;s rights advocate, domestic abuse advocate and ex-feminist. She holds a controversial theory that most domestic violence between men and women is mutual and reciprocated. Pizzey has released two notable works, &quot;Scream Quietly or the Neighbours Will Hear&quot; and &quot;Prone to Violence.&quot; In the 2024 New Year Honours she was named Commander of the Order of the British Empire.

=== Bettina Arndt ===

Bettina Arndt is an Australian men&#x27;s right activist who was awarded the Order of Australia for gender equity in 2020. Despite heavy criticism, the Council of the Award of Australia decided not to strip her of the award.

==Reception==

Many authors have characterized the men&#x27;s rights movement as misogynistic. The Southern Poverty Law Center has stated that while some of the websites, blogs and forums related to the movement &quot;voice legitimate and sometimes disturbing complaints about the treatment of men, what is most remarkable is the misogynistic tone that pervades so many.&quot; After further research into the movement, the SPLC elaborated: &quot;A thinly veiled desire for the domination of women and a conviction that the current system oppresses men in favor of women are the unifying tenets of the male supremacist worldview.&quot; Other studies have pointed towards men&#x27;s rights groups in India trying to change or completely abolish important legal protections for women as a form of &quot;patriarchal anxiety&quot; as well as being hostile towards women. In 2024 UN Women described men&#x27;s rights, anti-gender and gender-critical movements as examples of anti-rights movements and linked them to &quot;hateful propaganda and disinformation to target and attempt to delegitimize people with diverse sexual orientations, gender identities, gender expressions, and sex characteristics.&quot;

The venue for the first Men&#x27;s Rights Conference in the US received death threats, calls, and demonstrations forcing the organizers to raise funds for extra security and eventually change the venue.

Professor Ruth M. Mann of the University of Windsor in Canada suggests that men&#x27;s rights groups fuel an international rhetoric of hatred and victimization by disseminating misinformation via online forums and websites containing constantly-updated &quot;diatribes against feminism, ex-wives, child support, shelters, and the family law and criminal justice systems.&quot; According to Mann, these stories reignite their hatred and reinforce their beliefs that the system is biased against men and that feminism is responsible for a large scale and ongoing &quot;cover-up&quot; of men&#x27;s victimization. Mann says that although existing legislation in Canada acknowledges that men are &quot;also&quot; victims of domestic violence, men&#x27;s rights advocates demand government recognition that men are equally or &quot;more&quot; victimized by domestic violence, claims not supported by the data. Mann also states that in contrast to feminist groups, who have advocated for domestic violence services on behalf of other historically oppressed groups in addition to women, such as individuals impacted by poverty, ethnicity, disability, sexual orientation, etc., men&#x27;s rights groups have attempted to achieve their goals by actively opposing and attempting to dismantle services and supports put in place to protect abused women and children.

Other researchers such as Michael Flood have accused the men&#x27;s rights movement, particularly the father&#x27;s rights groups in Australia, of endangering women, children, and even men who are at greater risk of abuse and violence. Flood states that the men&#x27;s rights/father&#x27;s rights groups in Australia pursue &quot;equality with a vengeance&quot; or equal policies with negative outcomes and motives in order to re-establish paternal authority over the well-being of children and women as well as positive parenting.

<text>Nitrification is the biological oxidation of ammonia to nitrate via the intermediary nitrite. Nitrification is an important step in the nitrogen cycle in soil. The process of complete nitrification may occur through separate organisms or entirely within one organism, as in comammox bacteria. The transformation of ammonia to nitrite is usually the rate limiting step of nitrification. Nitrification is an aerobic process performed by small groups of autotrophic bacteria and archaea.

==Microbiology==

=== Ammonia oxidation ===
The process of nitrification begins with the first stage of ammonia oxidation, where ammonia (NH3) or ammonium (NH4+) get converted into nitrite (NO2−). This first stage is sometimes known as nitritation. It is performed by two groups of organisms, ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) and ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA).

====Ammonia-Oxidizing Bacteria====
Ammonia-Oxidizing Bacteria (AOB) are typically Gram-negative bacteria and belong to Betaproteobacteria and Gammaproteobacteria including the commonly studied genera including &quot;Nitrosomonas&quot; and &quot;Nitrococcus&quot;. They are known for their ability to utilize ammonia as an energy source and are prevalent in a wide range of environments, such as soils, aquatic systems, and wastewater treatment plants.

AOB possess enzymes called ammonia monooxygenases (AMOs), which are responsible for catalyzing the conversion of ammonia to hydroxylamine (NH2OH), a crucial intermediate in the process of nitrification. This enzymatic activity is sensitive to environmental factors, such as pH, temperature, and oxygen availability.

AOB play a vital role in soil nitrification, making them key players in nutrient cycling. They contribute to the transformation of ammonia derived from organic matter decomposition or fertilizers into nitrite, which subsequently serves as a substrate for nitrite-oxidizing bacteria (NOB).

====Ammonia-Oxidizing Archaea====
Prior to the discovery of archaea capable of ammonia oxidation, ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) were considered the only organisms capable of ammonia oxidation. Since their discovery in 2005, two isolates of AOAs have been cultivated: &quot;Nitrosopumilus maritimus&quot; and &quot;Nitrososphaera viennensis&quot;. When comparing AOB and AOA, AOA dominate in both soils and marine environments, suggesting that &quot;Nitrososphaerota&quot; (formerly &quot;Thaumarchaeota&quot;) may be greater contributors to ammonia oxidation in these environments.

Crenarchaeol, which is generally thought to be produced exclusively by AOA (specifically Nitrososphaerota), has been proposed as a biomarker for AOA and ammonia oxidation. Crenarchaeol abundance has been found to track with seasonal blooms of AOA, suggesting that it may be appropriate to use crenarchaeol abundances as a proxy for AOA populations and thus ammonia oxidation more broadly. However the discovery of Nitrososphaerota that are not obligate ammonia-oxidizers complicates this conclusion, as does one study that suggests that crenarchaeol may be produced by Marine Group II Euryarchaeota.

=== Nitrite oxidation ===
The second step of nitrification is the oxidation of nitrite into nitrate. This process is sometimes known as nitratation. Nitrite oxidation is conducted by nitrite-oxidizing bacteria (NOB) from the taxa &quot;Nitrospirota&quot;, &quot;Nitrospinota&quot;, &quot;Pseudomonadota&quot; and &quot;Chloroflexota&quot;. NOB are typically present in soil, geothermal springs, freshwater and marine ecosystems.

=== Complete ammonia oxidation ===

Ammonia oxidation to nitrate in a single step within one organism was predicted in 2006 and discovered in 2015 in the species &quot;Nitrospira inopinata&quot;. A pure culture of the organism was obtained in 2017, representing a revolution in our understanding of the nitrification process.

== History ==
The idea that oxidation of ammonia to nitrate is in fact a biological process was first given by Louis Pasteur in 1862. Later in 1875, Alexander Müller, while conducting a quality assessment of water from wells in Berlin, noted that ammonium was stable in sterilized solutions but nitrified in natural waters. A. Müller put forward, that nitrification is thus performed by microorganisms. In 1877, Jean-Jacques Schloesing and Achille Müntz, two French agricultural chemists working in Paris, proved that nitrification is indeed microbially mediated process by the experiments with liquid sewage and artificial soil matrix (sterilized sand with powdered chalk). Their findings were confirmed soon (in 1878) by Robert Warington who was investigating nitrification ability of garden soil at the Rothamsted experimental station in Harpenden in England. R. Warington made also the first observation that nitrification is a two-step process in 1879 which was confirmed by John Munro in 1886. Although at that time, it was believed that two-step nitrification is separated into distinct life phases or character traits of a single microorganism.

The first pure nitrifier (ammonia-oxidizing) was most probably isolated in 1890 by Percy Frankland and Grace Frankland, two English scientists from Scotland. Before that, Warington, Sergei Winogradsky and the Franklands were only able to enrich cultures of nitrifiers. Frankland and Frankland succeeded with a system of serial dilutions with very low inoculum and long cultivation times counting in years. Sergei Winogradsky claimed pure culture isolation in the same year (1890), but his culture was still co-culture of ammonia- and nitrite-oxidizing bacteria. S. Winogradsky succeeded just one year later in 1891.

In fact, during the serial dilutions ammonia-oxidizers and nitrite-oxidizers were unknowingly separated resulting in pure culture with ammonia-oxidation ability only. Thus Frankland and Frankland observed that these pure cultures lose ability to perform both steps. Loss of nitrite oxidation ability was observed already by R. Warington. Cultivation of pure nitrite oxidizer happened later during 20th century, however it is not possible to be certain which cultures were without contaminants as all theoretically pure strains share same trait (nitrite consumption, nitrate production).

== Ecology ==

Both steps are producing energy to be coupled to ATP synthesis. Nitrifying organisms are chemoautotrophs, and use carbon dioxide as their carbon source for growth. Some AOB possess the enzyme, urease, which catalyzes the conversion of the urea molecule to two ammonia molecules and one carbon dioxide molecule. &quot;Nitrosomonas europaea&quot;, as well as populations of soil-dwelling AOB, have been shown to assimilate the carbon dioxide released by the reaction to make biomass via the Calvin Cycle, and harvest energy by oxidizing ammonia (the other product of urease) to nitrite. This feature may explain enhanced growth of AOB in the presence of urea in acidic environments.

In most environments, organisms are present that will complete both steps of the process, yielding nitrate as the final product. However, it is possible to design systems in which nitrite is formed (the &quot;Sharon process&quot;).

Nitrification is important in agricultural systems, where fertilizer is often applied as ammonia. Conversion of this ammonia to nitrate increases nitrogen leaching because nitrate is more water-soluble than ammonia.

Nitrification also plays an important role in the removal of nitrogen from municipal wastewater. The conventional removal is nitrification, followed by denitrification. The cost of this process resides mainly in aeration (bringing oxygen in the reactor) and the addition of an external carbon source (e.g., methanol) for the denitrification.

Nitrification can also occur in drinking water. In distribution systems where chloramines are used as the secondary disinfectant, the presence of free ammonia can act as a substrate for ammonia-oxidizing microorganisms. The associated reactions can lead to the depletion of the disinfectant residual in the system. The addition of chlorite ion to chloramine-treated water has been shown to control nitrification.

Together with ammonification, nitrification forms a mineralization process that refers to the complete decomposition of organic material, with the release of available nitrogen compounds. This replenishes the nitrogen cycle.

=== Nitrification in the marine environment ===
In the marine environment, nitrogen is often the limiting nutrient, so the nitrogen cycle in the ocean is of particular interest. The nitrification step of the cycle is of particular interest in the ocean because it creates nitrate, the primary form of nitrogen responsible for &quot;new&quot; production. Furthermore, as the ocean becomes enriched in anthropogenic CO2, the resulting decrease in pH could lead to decreasing rates of nitrification. Nitrification could potentially become a &quot;bottleneck&quot; in the nitrogen cycle.

Nitrification, as stated above, is formally a two-step process; in the first step ammonia is oxidized to nitrite, and in the second step nitrite is oxidized to nitrate. Diverse microbes are responsible for each step in the marine environment. Several groups of ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) are known in the marine environment, including &quot;Nitrosomonas&quot;, &quot;Nitrospira&quot;, and &quot;Nitrosococcus&quot;. All contain the functional gene ammonia monooxygenase (AMO) which, as its name implies, is responsible for the oxidation of ammonia. Subsequent metagenomic studies and cultivation approaches have revealed that some Thermoproteota (formerly Crenarchaeota) possess AMO. Thermoproteota are abundant in the ocean and some species have a 200 times greater affinity for ammonia than AOB, contrasting with the previous belief that AOB are primarily responsible for nitrification in the ocean. Furthermore, though nitrification is classically thought to be vertically separated from primary production because the oxidation of nitrate by bacteria is inhibited by light, nitrification by AOA does not appear to be light inhibited, meaning that nitrification is occurring throughout the water column, challenging the classical definitions of &quot;new&quot; and &quot;recycled&quot; production.

In the second step, nitrite is oxidized to nitrate. In the oceans, this step is not as well understood as the first, but the bacteria &quot;Nitrospina&quot; and &quot;Nitrobacter&quot; are known to carry out this step in the ocean.

==Chemistry and enzymology==
Nitrification is a process of nitrogen compound oxidation (effectively, loss of electrons from the nitrogen atom to the oxygen atoms), and is catalyzed step-wise by a series of enzymes.
:&lt;chem&gt;2NH4+ + 3O2 -&gt; 2NO2- + 4H+ + 2H2O&lt;/chem&gt; (&quot;Nitrosomonas&quot;, &quot;Comammox&quot;)
:&lt;chem&gt;2NO2- + O2 -&gt; 2NO3-&lt;/chem&gt; (&quot;Nitrobacter&quot;, &quot;Nitrospira&quot;, &quot;Comammox&quot;)
OR
:&lt;chem&gt;NH3 + O2 -&gt; NO2- + 3H+ + 2e-&lt;/chem&gt;
:&lt;chem&gt;NO2- + H2O -&gt; NO3- + 2H+ + 2e-&lt;/chem&gt;
In &quot;Nitrosomonas europaea&quot;, the first step of oxidation (ammonia to hydroxylamine) is carried out by the enzyme ammonia monooxygenase (AMO).

:&lt;chem&gt;NH3 + O2 + 2H+ -&gt; NH2OH + H2O&lt;/chem&gt;

The second step (hydroxylamine to nitrite) is catalyzed by two enzymes. Hydroxylamine oxidoreductase (HAO), converts hydroxylamine to nitric oxide.

:&lt;chem&gt;NH2OH -&gt; NO + 3H+ + 3e-&lt;/chem&gt;

Another currently unknown enzyme converts nitric oxide to nitrite.

The third step (nitrite to nitrate) is completed in a distinct organism.

:&lt;chem&gt;{nitrite} + acceptor &lt;=&gt; {nitrate} + reduced\ acceptor&lt;/chem&gt;

==Factors Affecting Nitrification Rates==
===Soil conditions===
Due to its inherent microbial nature, nitrification in soils is greatly susceptible to soil conditions. In general, soil nitrification will proceed at optimal rates if the conditions for the microbial communities foster healthy microbial growth and activity. Soil conditions that have an effect on nitrification rates include:
*Substrate availability (presence of NH4+)
*Aeration (availability of O2)
*Soil moisture content (availability of H2O)
*pH (near neutral)
*Temperature

=== Inhibitors of nitrification ===
Nitrification inhibitors are chemical compounds that slow the nitrification of ammonia, ammonium-containing, or urea-containing fertilizers, which are applied to soil as fertilizers. These inhibitors can help reduce losses of nitrogen in soil that would otherwise be used by crops. Nitrification inhibitors are used widely, being added to approximately 50% of the fall-applied anhydrous ammonia in states in the U.S., like Illinois. They are usually effective in increasing recovery of nitrogen fertilizer in row crops, but the level of effectiveness depends on external conditions and their benefits are most likely to be seen at less than optimal nitrogen rates.

The environmental concerns of nitrification also contribute to interest in the use of nitrification inhibitors: the primary product, nitrate, leaches into groundwater, producing toxicity in both humans and some species of wildlife and contributing to the eutrophication of standing water. Some inhibitors of nitrification also inhibit the production of methane, a greenhouse gas.

The inhibition of the nitrification process is primarily facilitated by the selection and inhibition/destruction of the bacteria that oxidize ammonia compounds. A multitude of compounds inhibit nitrification, which can be divided into the following areas: the active site of ammonia monooxygenase (AMO), mechanistic inhibitors, and the process of N-heterocyclic compounds. The process for the latter of the three is not yet widely understood, but is prominent. The presence of AMO has been confirmed on many substrates that are nitrogen inhibitors such as dicyandiamide, ammonium thiosulfate, and nitrapyrin.

The conversion of ammonia to hydroxylamine is the first step in nitrification, where AH2 represents a range of potential electron donors.

: + + → + A + 

This reaction is catalyzed by AMO. Inhibitors of this reaction bind to the active site on AMO and prevent or delay the process. The process of oxidation of ammonia by AMO is regarded with importance due to the fact that other processes require the co-oxidation of NH3 for a supply of reducing equivalents. This is usually supplied by the compound hydroxylamine oxidoreductase (HAO) which catalyzes the reaction:

: + → − + 5 H+ + 4 e−

The mechanism of inhibition is complicated by this requirement. Kinetic analysis of the inhibition of NH3 oxidation has shown that the substrates of AMO have shown kinetics ranging from competitive to noncompetitive. The binding and oxidation can occur on two sites on AMO: in competitive substrates, binding and oxidation occurs at the NH3 site, while in noncompetitive substrates it occurs at another site.

Mechanism based inhibitors can be defined as compounds that interrupt the normal reaction catalyzed by an enzyme. This method occurs by the inactivation of the enzyme via covalent modification of the product, which ultimately inhibits nitrification. Through the process, AMO is deactivated and one or more proteins is covalently bonded to the final product. This is found to be most prominent in a broad range of sulfur or acetylenic compounds.

Sulfur-containing compounds, including ammonium thiosulfate (a popular inhibitor) are found to operate by producing volatile compounds with strong inhibitory effects such as carbon disulfide and thiourea.

In particular, thiophosphoryl triamide has been a notable addition where it has the dual purpose of inhibiting both the production of urease and nitrification. In a study of inhibitory effects of oxidation by the bacteria Nitrosomonas europaea, the use of thioethers resulted in the oxidation of these compounds to sulfoxides, where the S atom is the primary site of oxidation by AMO. This is most strongly correlated to the field of competitive inhibition. 

N-heterocyclic compounds are also highly effective nitrification inhibitors and are often classified by their ring structure. The mode of action for these compounds is not well understood: while nitrapyrin, a widely used inhibitor and substrate of AMO, is a weak mechanism-based inhibitor of said enzyme, the effects of said mechanism are unable to correlate directly with the compound&#x27;s ability to inhibit nitrification. It is suggested that nitrapyrin acts against the monooxygenase enzyme within the bacteria, preventing growth and CH4/NH4 oxidation. Compounds containing two or three adjacent ring N atoms (pyridazine, pyrazole, indazole) tend to have a significantly higher inhibition effect than compounds containing non-adjacent N atoms or singular ring N atoms (pyridine, pyrrole). This suggests that the presence of ring N atoms is directly correlated with the inhibition effect of this class of compounds.

===Methane oxidation inhibition===
Some enzymatic nitrification inhibitors, such as nitrapyrin, can also inhibit the oxidation of methane in methanotrophic bacteria. AMO shows similar kinetic turnover rates to methane monooxygenase (MMO) found in methanotrophs, indicating that MMO is a similar catalyst to AMO for the purpose of methane oxidation. Furthermore, methanotrophic bacteria share many similarities to oxidizers such as Nitrosomonas. The inhibitor profile of particulate forms of MMO (pMMO) shows similarity to the profile of AMO, leading to similarity in properties between MMO in methanotrophs and AMO in autotrophs.

==Environmental concerns==

Nitrification inhibitors are also of interest from an environmental standpoint because of the production of nitrates and nitrous oxide from the nitrification process. Nitrous oxide (N2O), although its atmospheric concentration is much lower than that of CO2, has a global warming potential of about 300 times greater than carbon dioxide and contributes 6% of planetary warming due to greenhouse gases. This compound is also notable for catalyzing the breakup of ozone in the stratosphere. Nitrates, a toxic compound for wildlife and livestock and a product of nitrification, are also of concern.

Soil, consisting of polyanionic clays and silicates, generally has a net anionic charge. Consequently, ammonium (NH4+) binds tightly to the soil, but nitrate ions (NO3−) do not. Because nitrate is more mobile, it leaches into groundwater supplies through agricultural runoff. Nitrates in groundwater can affect surface water concentrations through direct groundwater-surface water interactions (e.g., gaining stream reaches, springs) or from when it is extracted for surface use. For example, much of the drinking water in the United States comes from groundwater, but most wastewater treatment plants discharge to surface water.

Among wildlife, amphibians (tadpoles) and freshwater fish eggs are most sensitive to elevated nitrate levels and experience growth and developmental damage at levels commonly found in U.S. freshwater bodies (&lt;20 mg/l). In contrast, freshwater invertebrates are more tolerant (~90+mg/l), and adult freshwater fish can tolerate very high levels (800 mg+/l). Nitrate levels also contribute to eutrophication, a process in which large algal blooms reduce oxygen levels in bodies of water and lead to death in oxygen-consuming creatures due to anoxia. Nitrification is also thought to contribute to the formation of photochemical smog, ground-level ozone, acid rain, changes in species diversity, and other undesirable processes. In addition, nitrification inhibitors have also been shown to suppress the oxidation of methane (CH4), a potent greenhouse gas, to CO2. Both nitrapyrin and acetylene are shown to be potent suppressors of both processes, although the modes of action distinguishing them are unclear.

<doc id="361038" wikidata="Q506623" url="?curid=361038" title="Chemical polarity">
<text>In chemistry, polarity is a separation of electric charge leading to a molecule or its chemical groups having an electric dipole moment, with a negatively charged end and a positively charged end.

Polar molecules must contain one or more polar bonds due to a difference in electronegativity between the bonded atoms. Molecules containing polar bonds have no molecular polarity if the bond dipoles cancel each other out by symmetry.

Polar molecules interact through dipole-dipole intermolecular forces and hydrogen bonds. Polarity underlies a number of physical properties including surface tension, solubility, and melting and boiling points.

== Polarity of bonds ==
Not all atoms attract electrons with the same force. The amount of &quot;pull&quot; an atom exerts on its electrons is called its electronegativity. Atoms with high electronegativitiessuch as fluorine, oxygen, and nitrogenexert a greater pull on electrons than atoms with lower electronegativities such as alkali metals and alkaline earth metals. In a bond, this leads to unequal sharing of electrons between the atoms, as electrons will be drawn closer to the atom with the higher electronegativity.

Because electrons have a negative charge, the unequal sharing of electrons within a bond leads to the formation of an electric dipole: a separation of positive and negative electric charge. Because the amount of charge separated in such dipoles is usually smaller than a fundamental charge, they are called partial charges, denoted as δ+ (delta plus) and δ− (delta minus). These symbols were introduced by Sir Christopher Ingold and Edith Hilda (Usherwood) Ingold in 1926. The bond dipole moment is calculated by multiplying the amount of charge separated and the distance between the charges.

These dipoles within molecules can interact with dipoles in other molecules, creating dipole-dipole intermolecular forces.

===Classification===
Bonds can fall between one of two extremescompletely nonpolar or completely polar. A completely nonpolar bond occurs when the electronegativities are identical and therefore possess a difference of zero. A completely polar bond is more correctly called an ionic bond, and occurs when the difference between electronegativities is large enough that one atom actually takes an electron from the other. The terms &quot;polar&quot; and &quot;nonpolar&quot; are usually applied to covalent bonds, that is, bonds where the polarity is not complete. To determine the polarity of a covalent bond using numerical means, the difference between the electronegativity of the atoms is used.

Bond polarity is typically divided into three groups that are loosely based on the difference in electronegativity between the two bonded atoms. According to the Pauling scale:
* &quot;Nonpolar bonds&quot; generally occur when the difference in electronegativity between the two atoms is less than 0.5
* &quot;Polar bonds&quot; generally occur when the difference in electronegativity between the two atoms is roughly between 0.5 and 2.0
* &quot;Ionic bonds&quot; generally occur when the difference in electronegativity between the two atoms is greater than 2.0

Pauling based this classification scheme on the &quot;partial ionic character&quot; of a bond, which is an approximate function of the difference in electronegativity between the two bonded atoms. He estimated that a difference of 1.7 corresponds to 50% ionic character, so that a greater difference corresponds to a bond which is predominantly ionic.

As a quantum-mechanical description, Pauling proposed that the wave function for a polar molecule AB is a linear combination of wave functions for covalent and ionic molecules: ψ = aψ(A:B) + bψ(A+B−). The amount of covalent and ionic character depends on the values of the squared coefficients a2 and b2.

===Bond dipole moments===
The bond dipole moment uses the idea of electric dipole moment to measure the polarity of a chemical bond within a molecule. It occurs whenever there is a separation of positive and negative charges. 

The bond dipole μ is given by:

:formula_1.

The bond dipole is modeled as δ+ — δ– with a distance &quot;d&quot; between the partial charges δ+ and δ–. It is a vector, parallel to the bond axis, pointing from minus to plus, as is conventional for electric dipole moment vectors.

Chemists often draw the vector pointing from plus to minus. This vector can be physically interpreted as the movement undergone by electrons when the two atoms are placed a distance &quot;d&quot; apart and allowed to interact, the electrons will move from their free state positions to be localised more around the more electronegative atom.

The SI unit for electric dipole moment is the coulomb–meter. This is too large to be practical on the molecular scale. 
Bond dipole moments are commonly measured in debyes, represented by the symbol D, which is obtained by measuring the charge formula_2 in units of 10−10 statcoulomb and the distance &quot;d&quot; in Angstroms. Based on the conversion factor of
10−10 statcoulomb being 0.208 units of elementary charge, so 1.0 debye results from an electron and a proton separated by 0.208 Å. A useful conversion factor is 1 D = 3.335 64 C m. 

For diatomic molecules there is only one (single or multiple) bond so the bond dipole moment is the molecular dipole moment, with typical values in the range of 0 to 11 D. At one extreme, a symmetrical molecule such as bromine, , has zero dipole moment, while near the other extreme, gas phase potassium bromide, KBr, which is highly ionic, has a dipole moment of 10.41 D.

For polyatomic molecules, there is more than one bond. The total molecular dipole moment may be approximated as the vector sum of the individual bond dipole moments. Often bond dipoles are obtained by the reverse process: a known total dipole of a molecule can be decomposed into bond dipoles. This is done to transfer bond dipole moments to molecules that have the same bonds, but for which the total dipole moment is not yet known. The vector sum of the transferred bond dipoles gives an estimate for the total (unknown) dipole of the molecule.

== Polarity of molecules ==
A molecule is composed of one or more chemical bonds between molecular orbitals of different atoms. A molecule may be polar either as a result of polar bonds due to differences in electronegativity as described above, or as a result of an asymmetric arrangement of nonpolar covalent bonds and non-bonding pairs of electrons known as a full molecular orbital.

While the molecules can be described as &quot;polar covalent&quot;, &quot;nonpolar covalent&quot;, or &quot;ionic&quot;, this is often a relative term, with one molecule simply being &quot;more polar&quot; or &quot;more nonpolar&quot; than another. However, the following properties are typical of such molecules.

===Boiling point===
When comparing a polar and nonpolar molecule with similar molar masses, the polar molecule in general has a higher boiling point, because the dipole–dipole interaction between polar molecules results in stronger intermolecular attractions. One common form of polar interaction is the hydrogen bond, which is also known as the H-bond. For example, water forms H-bonds and has a molar mass M = 18 and a boiling point of +100 °C, compared to nonpolar methane with M = 16 and a boiling point of –161 °C.

===Solubility===
Due to the polar nature of the water molecule itself, other polar molecules are generally able to dissolve in water. Most nonpolar molecules are water-insoluble (hydrophobic) at room temperature. Many nonpolar organic solvents, such as turpentine, are able to dissolve nonpolar substances.

===Surface tension===
Polar compounds tend to have higher surface tension than nonpolar compounds.

===Capillary action===
Polar liquids have a tendency to rise against gravity in a small diameter tube.

===Viscosity===
Polar liquids have a tendency to be more viscous than nonpolar liquids. For example, nonpolar hexane is much less viscous than polar water. However, molecule size is a much stronger factor on viscosity than polarity, where compounds with larger molecules are more viscous than compounds with smaller molecules. Thus, water (small polar molecules) is less viscous than hexadecane (large nonpolar molecules).

== Examples ==
===Polar molecules===
A polar molecule has a net dipole as a result of the opposing charges (i.e. having partial positive and partial negative charges) from polar bonds arranged asymmetrically. Water (H2O) is an example of a polar molecule since it has a slight positive charge on one side and a slight negative charge on the other. The dipoles do not cancel out, resulting in a net dipole. The dipole moment of water depends on its state. In the gas phase the dipole moment is ≈ 1.86 debye (D), whereas liquid water (≈ 2.95 D) and ice (≈ 3.09 D) are higher due to differing hydrogen-bonded environments. Other examples include sugars (like sucrose), which have many polar oxygen–hydrogen (−OH) groups and are overall highly polar.

If the bond dipole moments of the molecule do not cancel, the molecule is polar. For example, the water molecule (H2O) contains two polar O−H bonds in a bent (nonlinear) geometry. The bond dipole moments do not cancel, so that the molecule forms a molecular dipole with its negative pole at the oxygen and its positive pole midway between the two hydrogen atoms. In the figure each bond joins the central O atom with a negative charge (red) to an H atom with a positive charge (blue).

The hydrogen fluoride, HF, molecule is polar by virtue of polar covalent bondsin the covalent bond electrons are displaced toward the more electronegative fluorine atom.

 Ammonia, NH3, is a molecule whose three N−H bonds have only a slight polarity (toward the more electronegative nitrogen atom). The molecule has two lone electrons in an orbital that points towards the fourth apex of an approximately regular tetrahedron, as predicted by the VSEPR theory. This orbital is not participating in covalent bonding; it is electron-rich, which results in a powerful dipole across the whole ammonia molecule.
In ozone (O3) molecules, the two O−O bonds are nonpolar (there is no electronegativity difference between atoms of the same element). However, the distribution of other electrons is unevensince the central atom has to share electrons with two other atoms, but each of the outer atoms has to share electrons with only one other atom, the central atom is more deprived of electrons than the others (the central atom has a formal charge of +1, while the outer atoms each have a formal charge of −). Since the molecule has a bent geometry, the result is a dipole across the whole ozone molecule.

===Nonpolar molecules===

A molecule may be nonpolar either when there is an equal sharing of electrons between the two atoms of a diatomic molecule or because of the symmetrical arrangement of polar bonds in a more complex molecule. For example, boron trifluoride (BF3) has a trigonal planar arrangement of three polar bonds at 120°. This results in no overall dipole in the molecule.


Carbon dioxide (CO2) has two polar C=O bonds, but the geometry of CO2 is linear so that the two bond dipole moments cancel and there is no net molecular dipole moment; the molecule is nonpolar.
Examples of household nonpolar compounds include fats, oil, and petrol/gasoline. 

In the methane molecule (CH4) the four C−H bonds are arranged tetrahedrally around the carbon atom. Each bond has polarity (though not very strong). The bonds are arranged symmetrically so there is no overall dipole in the molecule. The diatomic oxygen molecule (O2) does not have polarity in the covalent bond because of equal electronegativity, hence there is no polarity in the molecule.

=== Amphiphilic molecules ===

Large molecules that have one end with polar groups attached and another end with nonpolar groups are described as amphiphiles or &quot;amphiphilic&quot; molecules. They are good surfactants and can aid in the formation of stable emulsions, or blends, of water and fats. Surfactants reduce the interfacial tension between oil and water by adsorbing at the liquid–liquid interface.

== Predicting molecule polarity ==

Determining the point group is a useful way to predict polarity of a molecule. In general, a molecule will not possess dipole moment if the individual bond dipole moments of the molecule cancel each other out. This is because dipole moments are euclidean vector quantities with magnitude and direction, and a two equal vectors that oppose each other will cancel out.

Any molecule with a centre of inversion (&quot;i&quot;) or a horizontal mirror plane (&quot;σh&quot;) will not possess dipole moments. 
Likewise, a molecule with more than one C&quot;n&quot; axis of rotation will not possess a dipole moment because dipole moments cannot lie in more than one dimension. As a consequence of that constraint, all molecules with dihedral symmetry (D&quot;n&quot;) will not have a dipole moment because, by definition, D point groups have two or multiple C&quot;n&quot; axes.

Since C1, Cs,C∞h C&quot;n&quot; and C&quot;n&quot;v point groups do not have a centre of inversion, horizontal mirror planes or multiple C&quot;n&quot; axis, molecules in one of those point groups will have dipole moment.

== Electrical deflection of water ==
Contrary to popular misconception, the electrical deflection of a stream of water from a charged object is not based on polarity. The deflection occurs because of electrically charged droplets in the stream, which the charged object induces. A stream of water can also be deflected in a uniform electrical field, which cannot exert force on polar molecules. Additionally, after a stream of water is grounded, it can no longer be deflected. Weak deflection is even possible for nonpolar liquids.

<doc id="361053" wikidata="Q27075852" url="?curid=361053" title="Common linnet">
<text>The common linnet (Linaria cannabina) is a small passerine bird of the finch family, Fringillidae. It derives its common name and the scientific name, &quot;Linaria&quot;, from its fondness for hemp seeds and flax seeds—flax being the English name of the plant from which linen is made.

==Taxonomy==
In 1758, the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus included the common linnet in the 10th edition of his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; under the binomial name, &quot;Acanthis cannabina&quot;. The species was formerly placed in the genus &quot;Carduelis&quot; but based on the results of a phylogenetic analysis of mitochondrial and nuclear DNA sequences published in 2012, it was moved to the genus &quot;Linaria&quot; that had been introduced by the German naturalist Johann Matthäus Bechstein in 1802.

The genus name &quot;linaria&quot; is the Latin for a linen-weaver, from &quot;linum&quot;, &quot;flax&quot;. The species name &quot;cannabina&quot; comes from the Latin for hemp. The English name has a similar root, being derived from Old French &quot;linette&quot;, from &quot;lin&quot;, &quot;flax&quot;.

There are seven recognised subspecies:

* &quot;L. c. autochthona&quot; (Clancey, 1946) – Scotland
* &quot;L. c. cannabina&quot; (Linnaeus, 1758) – western, central and northern Europe, western and central Siberia. Non-breeding in north Africa and southwest Asia 
* &quot;L. c. bella&quot; (Brehm, CL, 1845) – Middle East to Mongolia and northwestern China
* &quot;L. c. mediterranea&quot; (Tschusi, 1903) – Iberian Peninsula, Italy, Greece, northwest Africa and Mediterranean islands
* &quot;L. c. guentheri&quot; (Wolters, 1953) – Madeira
* &quot;L. c. meadewaldoi&quot; (Hartert, 1901) – western and central Canary Island (El Hierro and Gran Canaria)
* &quot;L. c. harterti&quot; (Bannerman, 1913) – eastern Canary Islands (Alegranza, Lanzarote and Fuerteventura)

== Description ==
The common linnet is a slim bird with a long tail. The upper parts are brown, the throat is sullied white and the bill is grey. The summer male has a grey nape, red head-patch and red breast. Females and young birds lack the red and have white underparts, the breast streaked buff.

== Distribution ==
The common linnet breeds in Europe, the western Palearctic and North Africa. It is partially resident, but many eastern and northern birds migrate farther south in the breeding range or move to the coasts. They are sometimes found several hundred miles off-shore. It has been introduced to the Dominican Republic.

==Behaviour==
Open land with thick bushes is favoured for breeding, including heathland and garden. It builds its nest in a bush, laying four to seven eggs.

This species can form large flocks outside the breeding season, sometimes mixed with other finches, such as twite, on coasts and salt marshes.

The common linnet&#x27;s pleasant song contains fast trills and twitters.

It feeds on the ground, and low down in bushes, its food mainly consisting of seeds, which it also feeds to its chicks. It likes small to medium-sized seeds from most arable weeds, knotgrass, dock, crucifers (including charlock, shepherd&#x27;s purse), chickweeds, dandelions, thistle, sow-thistle, mayweed, common groundsel, common hawthorn and birch. They have a small component of Invertebrates in their diet.

==Conservation==
The common linnet is listed by the UK Biodiversity Action Plan as a priority species. It is protected in the UK by the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981.

In Britain, populations are declining, attributed to increasing use of herbicides, aggressive scrub removal and excessive hedge trimming; its population fell by 56% between 1968 and 1991, probably due to a decrease in seed supply and the increasing use of herbicide. From 1980 to 2009, according to the Pan-European Common Bird Monitoring Scheme, the European population decreased by 62%

Favourable management practices on agricultural land include:

* Set-aside
* Overwinter stubbles
* Uncultivated margins, ditches, field corners
* Conservation headlands
* Wild bird cover, using plants that produce small, oil-rich seeds, such as kale, quinoa, mustard plant and oil-seed rape &quot;Brassica napus&quot;
* Restoration of meadows: restoration and creation of hay-meadows
* Short, thick, thorny hedgerows and scrub for nesting habitat

==Cultural references==
The bird was a popular pet in the late Victorian and Edwardian eras. Alfred, Lord Tennyson mentions &quot;the linnet born within the cage&quot; in Canto 27 of his 1849 poem &quot;In Memoriam A.H.H.&quot;, the same section that contains the famous lines &quot;&#x27;Tis better to have loved and lost / Than never to have loved at all.&quot; A linnet features in the classic British music hall song &quot;Don&#x27;t Dilly Dally on the Way&quot; (1919) which is subtitled &quot;The Cock Linnet Song&quot;. It is a character in Oscar Wilde&#x27;s children&#x27;s story &quot;The Devoted Friend&quot; (1888) and Wilde also mentions how the call of the linnet awakens &quot;The Selfish Giant&quot; to the one tree where it is springtime in his garden. William Butler Yeats evokes the image of the common linnet in &quot;The Lake Isle of Innisfree&quot; (1890) : &quot;And evening full of the linnet&#x27;s wings.&quot; and also mentions the bird in his poem &quot;A Prayer for My Daughter&quot; (1919): &quot;May she become a flourishing hidden tree That all her thoughts may like the linnet be, And have no business but dispensing round Their magnanimities of sound.&quot; In the 1840 novel &quot;The Old Curiosity Shop&quot; by Charles Dickens, the heroine Nell keeps &quot;only a poor linnet&quot; in a cage, which she leaves for Kit as a sign of her gratefulness to him.

The English Baroque composer John Blow composed an ode on the occasion of the death of his colleague Henry Purcell, &quot;An Ode on the Death of Mr. Purcell&quot; set to the poem &quot;Mark how the lark and linnet sing&quot; by the poet John Dryden.

&quot;The Linnets&quot; has become the nickname of King&#x27;s Lynn Football Club, Burscough Football Club and Runcorn Linnets Football Club (formerly known as &#x27;Runcorn F.C.&#x27; and Runcorn F.C. Halton). Barry Town F.C., the South Wales-based football team, also used to be nicknamed &#x27;The Linnets&#x27;.

Robert Burns&#x27;s 1788 poem &quot;A Mother&#x27;s Lament for the Death of Her Son&quot; also tells of a linnet bird bewailing her ravished young.

William Blake invokes &quot;the linnet&#x27;s song&quot; in one of the poems entitled &quot;Song&quot; in his &quot;Poetical Sketches&quot;.

Walter de la Mare&#x27;s poem &quot;The Linnet&quot;, published in 1918 in the collection &quot;Motley and Other Poems&quot;, has been set to music by a number of composers including Cecil Armstrong Gibbs, Kenneth Leighton and Jack Gibbons.

The Eurovision Song Contest 2014 entry for the Netherlands &quot;The Common Linnets&quot; is a direct reference to the bird.

William Wordsworth argued that the song of the common linnet provides more wisdom than books in the third verse of &quot;The Tables Turned&quot;:
&lt;poem&gt;Books! &#x27;tis a dull and endless strife:
Come, hear the woodland linnet,
How sweet his music! on my life,
There&#x27;s more of wisdom in it.&lt;/poem&gt;

But the fellow English poet Robert Bridges used the common linnet instead to express the limitations of poetry—concentrating on the difficulty in poetry of conveying the beauty of a bird&#x27;s song. He wrote in the first verse:
&lt;poem&gt;I heard a linnet courting
His lady in the spring:
His mates were idly sporting,
Nor stayed to hear him sing
His song of love.—
I fear my speech distorting
His tender love.&lt;/poem&gt;

The musical Sweeney Todd features the song &quot;Green Finch and Linnet Bird&quot;, in which a young lady confined to her room wonders why caged birds sing:
&lt;poem&gt;Green finch and linnet bird,
Nightingale, blackbird,
How is it you sing?
How can you jubilate,
Sitting in cages,
Never taking wing?&lt;/poem&gt;

In Emily Dickinson&#x27;s poem &quot;Morns like these—we parted—&quot; the last line is: &quot;And this linnet flew!&quot;

<text>The Fantastic Baggys were an American surf and hot rod group, created by P.F. Sloan and Steve Barri. The studio group released several unsuccessful singles. They released one album internationally, &quot;Tell &#x27;Em I&#x27;m Surfin&#x27; &quot; (1964) on Imperial Records, and several singles and albums only in South Africa, where they proved to be briefly popular.

They provided Jan and Dean with several songs to record, including &quot;Summer Means Fun&quot; and &quot;From All over The World&quot;.

<text>Finger Eleven is a Canadian rock band from Burlington, Ontario, formed in 1990. They have released seven studio albums (six as Finger Eleven and one as Rainbow Butt Monkeys), with their album &quot;The Greyest of Blue Skies&quot; bringing them into the mainstream. Their 2003 self-titled album achieved Gold status in the United States and Platinum in Canada, largely from the success of the single &quot;One Thing&quot;, which marked the band&#x27;s first placing on the US Hot 100 Chart at number 16. Their 2007 album, &quot;Them vs. You vs. Me&quot; launched the single &quot;Paralyzer&quot;, which went on to top the Canadian Hot 100 and both US rock charts, as well as reaching No. 6 on the US Hot 100 and No. 12 on the Australian Singles Chart. They won the Juno Award for Rock Album of the Year in 2008. The same album was later certified gold in the US and multi-platinum in Canada. They released their sixth studio album, &quot;Life Turns Electric&quot;, on October 5, 2010; it was nominated as Best Rock Album of the Year at the Juno Awards of 2011. &quot;Five Crooked Lines&quot;, their 7th studio album, was released in 2015. Between 1995 and 2016, Finger Eleven was among the top 75 best-selling Canadian artists in Canada and among the top 25 best-selling Canadian bands in Canada. In 2023, the band released a compilation album titled &quot;Greatest Hits&quot;.

==History==
===&quot;Letters from Chutney&quot; (1990–1996)===
Finger Eleven first formed at Lester B. Pearson High School in Burlington, Ontario as Stone Soul Picnic, then changed their name to Rainbow Butt Monkeys. One of their first shows was at a school Christmas concert in 1990, and they won the 97.7 CHTZ (Hits) HTZ FM&#x27;s Rock Search competition. At the time, the band&#x27;s lineup consisted of lead vocalist Scott Anderson, guitarists James Black and Rick Jackett, bassist Sean Anderson (bass), and drummer Rob Gommerman.

They were signed by Mercury Records and, after releasing four EPs, they issued the album &quot;Letters from Chutney&quot; (1995), which received generally favourable reviews. In 1996, they were taken on by the management company Coalition Entertainment.

===&quot;Tip&quot; (1997–1999)===
In 1997, the band changed its name to Finger Eleven, which came from a demo of their song &quot;Thin Spirits&quot;. Their first album under the new name was &quot;Tip&quot;, produced by Arnold Lanni (Our Lady Peace). Mercury dropped the band after the album&#x27;s release; they were then signed to Wind-up Records, which re-released the record in 1998. During this period, the band toured heavily, as part of Edgefest, the Vans Warped Tour and, several times, opening for Creed and Fuel. In 1999, the track &quot;Quicksand&quot; was used in the TV series &quot;Roswell&quot; (uncredited).

Following the release of &quot;Tip&quot;, drummer Rob Gommerman left the band. He was replaced by Rich Beddoe, whom James Black had met at an Alice in Chains concert in Toronto several years earlier.

===&quot;The Greyest of Blue Skies&quot; (2000–2002)===
In 2000, Finger Eleven released &quot;The Greyest of Blue Skies&quot;, again produced by Arnold Lanni. The album was commercially successful in Canada and was certified Gold. This was another period of heavy touring, with the band playing X-Fest, Edgefest, K-Rockathon, and the four-city Canadian festival Summersault 2000. Finger Eleven also began appearing on its own, and headlining concerts with other bands.

A song from this album, &quot;Suffocate&quot;, was used in the 2000 film &quot;Scream 3&quot;. In 2001, the song &quot;Drag You Down&quot; was used in the animated sitcom &quot;Daria&quot;. In 2002, Finger Eleven covered and remixed the entrance theme for wrestler Kane, a song they called &quot;Slow Chemical&quot;, which was recorded and mixed at Metalworks Studios in Mississauga, Ontario. Kane used the song from 2002 to 2008. It was also used in WrestleMania 20 (2004), WrestleMania 22 (2006), WWE Backlash (2006), WrestleMania 23 (2007), and in the video game &quot;WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2008&quot;, as well as on the soundtrack for 2004&#x27;s film &quot;The Punisher&quot;.

===&quot;Finger Eleven&quot; (2003–2006)===
The band&#x27;s 2003 self-titled album, &quot;Finger Eleven&quot;, was produced by Johnny K. This album, characterized by screamed vocals over repetitive rock guitar rhythms, included the hit single &quot;One Thing&quot;, which earned them their first US Gold and Canadian Platinum albums. &quot;One Thing&quot; reached No.16 on &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s U.S charts, and appeared in the TV shows &quot;Scrubs&quot;, &quot;Smallville&quot;, and &quot;Third Watch&quot; (uncredited). It was also used on World Wrestling Entertainment&#x27;s 2007 edition of &quot;Raw&quot;, during a tribute video for Chris Benoit, who had killed himself and his family on June 25. In 2004, Finger Eleven won the MuchMusic Video Award for Best Video for &quot;One Thing&quot; and performed the song on &quot;Live with Regis and Kelly&quot; and &quot;The Tonight Show with Jay Leno&quot;.

In 2003, the Finger Eleven song &quot;Good Times&quot; was used in the soundtrack for the snowboard racing game &quot;SSX 3&quot;. &quot;Good Times&quot; and &quot;Conversations&quot; were used in the Nintendo video game &quot;1080° Avalanche&quot;. In 2004, the song &quot;Stay in Shadow&quot; was used in the video game &quot;Burnout 3: Takedown&quot;. In 2005, &quot;Thousand Mile Wish&quot; was used in the soundtrack of the superhero film &quot;Elektra&quot;.

The band followed this success with a tour of North America, Europe, and Australia, from 2003 to 2005. They played numerous festivals and opened for Evanescence, Nickelback, and The Tragically Hip.

===&quot;Them vs. You vs. Me&quot; (2007–2009)===
Finger Eleven&#x27;s fifth studio album, &quot;Them vs. You vs. Me&quot;, was released on March 6, 2007, with Johnny K returning as producer. The style on this album was more mellow than previous work. The lead single, &quot;Paralyzer&quot;, became the band&#x27;s biggest hit; it spent fifty weeks on the charts and reached No. 6 on the U.S. Hot 100 in November 2007, as well as attaining the No. 1 spot in Canada and on U.S. rock charts. The album also featured the singles &quot;Falling On&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;ll Keep Your Memory Vague&quot;, and &quot;Talking to the Walls&quot;.

&quot;Paralyzer&quot; was included in the soundtrack of the 2007 Victoria&#x27;s Secret Fashion Show, in a 2008 episode of the TV series &quot;Gossip Girl&quot; and, in 2009, in the soundtrack of the video game &quot;Band Hero&quot;.

In December 2007, the DVD &quot;Us-vs-Then-vs-Now&quot; was released, with footage spanning the band&#x27;s career up to that point.

&quot;Them vs. You vs. Me&quot; was certified Gold in the U.S. in March 2008, peaking at No. 14 on the Hot 100. The album also won Rock Album of the Year at the Juno Awards of 2008. At the ceremony, the band performed live on national television with the Calgary Youth Orchestra.

During this period, Finger Eleven continued to tour heavily, playing various festivals and numerous concerts with Seether, 3 Doors Down, and Kid Rock. They also performed at the 2007 NHL Awards Show in Toronto and, in 2009, played a show for Canadian and US troops in Kandahar, Afghanistan

===&quot;Life Turns Electric&quot; (2010–2012)===
Finger Eleven&#x27;s sixth album, &quot;Life Turns Electric&quot;, was released in October 2010. The first single from the record, &quot;Living in a Dream&quot;, was released on iTunes in July of that year; it added elements of funk rock and dance rock. A music video for the second single, &quot;Whatever Doesn&#x27;t Kill Me&quot;, was released in January 2011. The video was directed by Alon Isocianu. The remaining singles, &quot;Stone Soul&quot; and &quot;Pieces Fit&quot;, were released without music videos. The album received mixed reviews. It peaked at No 88 on the Billboard Charts.

Finger Eleven toured in support of the record throughout 2011 and 2012, again playing numerous festivals and concerts with Seether, Papa Roach, and Three Days Grace.

===&quot;Five Crooked Lines&quot; (2013–2016)===
At the end of 2013, drummer Rich Beddoe left the band; he was replaced by Steve Molella the following year. In the interim, Finger Eleven recorded their next album with session drummer Chris Powell. Also in 2013, Wind-Up Records&#x27; catalogue was sold to the Bicycle Music Company which, in 2015, merged with Concord Music Group, so that Finger Eleven&#x27;s new label became Concord Bicycle Music.

The band toured during the summer of 2015 with Three Days Grace.
(In 2015, former Three Days Grace frontman Adam Gontier would team up with Beddoe, Staind guitarist Mike Mushok, and bassist Corey Lowery to form the supergroup Saint Asonia).

Finger Eleven issued their seventh album, &quot;Five Crooked Lines&quot;, on July 31, 2015, and released the lead single &quot;Wolves and Doors&quot; to Canadian radio. The album received favourable reviews, charted for one week, and reached No 44 on the charts. They set out on their cross-Canada Fall of the Hammer Tour in support of the release. In some markets, the band participated with media partners in an opening-act contest.

===Twentieth anniversary of &quot;Tip&quot; and Rainbow Butt Monkeys reunion (2017–2018)===
Finger Eleven scheduled three shows in southern Ontario to celebrate the twentieth anniversary of the Canadian release of &quot;Tip&quot;, on March 23 in Burlington, March 24 in St. Catharines, and March 31 in Toronto. All three of these shows had a similar format: there was an exclusively acoustic set, with Q&amp;A before the show. For the main event, the band played &quot;Tip&quot; in its entirety; this was followed by an encore of &quot;Best of the Rest&quot;, a selection of band favourites from their other albums.

On June 9, 2018, Finger Eleven performed as Rainbow Butt Monkeys for the first time since 1997, playing at Burlington&#x27;s Sound of Music Festival and showcasing songs from their debut album, &quot;Letters from Chutney&quot;. They have since played festivals and concerts throughout North America.

===&quot;Greatest Hits&quot;, &quot;Adrenaline&quot; (2023–present)===
On May 10, 2023, the band released a music video for the song &quot;Together Right&quot;, their first new material in over seven years, from their upcoming compilation album. &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; was issued on June 16 of the same year.

In July 2024, Finger Eleven announced their eighth studio album, &quot;Adrenaline&quot;, due out in 2025, accompanied by an eponymous single, set to be released in August 2024.

<text>Sagwa, the Chinese Siamese Cat, or simply Sagwa, is a children&#x27;s animated television series based on the children&#x27;s book &quot;The Chinese Siamese Cat&quot;, created by Amy Tan which aired on PBS Kids, co-produced by Canada-based animation studio CinéGroupe and Sesame Workshop.

In the series, which is set , after the cinematograph was patented and during the late Qing dynasty, Sagwa has fun in her day-to-day life while learning and teaching valuable life lessons. The show is notable for its setting and messages about family obligations and loyalty. The show is also intentionally cross-cultural, with the theme song in both English and Chinese.

The series was developed and produced for television by executive producers George Daugherty and Michel Lemire, and producers David Ka Lik Wong and Leon G. Arcand.

The series aired from September 3, 2001, to October 5, 2002, running for one season and 40 episodes.

The series won the Silver Plaque at the Chicago International Film Festival for Children&#x27;s Film in 2001, as well as winning an Outstanding Individual in Animation award for background artist Valery Mihalkov at the 29th Daytime Emmy Awards and a &quot;TV Series - Family/Children&quot; award at WorldFest Houston in 2002.

==Premise==
Sagwa resides in a palace of a magistrate in China in what is assumed to be modern-day Fujian province (possibly during the late Qing dynasty, as shown by the characters&#x27; clothes), as part of a royal family of cats who have the ability to write with their tails. She and her siblings, along with various other cats and Fu-Fu the bat, have adventures that are usually accompanied by moral lessons, as is typical with most children&#x27;s shows. However, one aspect of the show which sets it apart is its display of various elements of Chinese culture.

==Characters==
===Miao family===
* Sagwa Miao (傻瓜 &quot;shǎguā&quot;, &quot;silly melon&quot;) (voiced by Holly Gauthier-Frankel) is the middle of the Miao family, as well as the titular protagonist of the series. Kind, curious, quick thinking, creative and often a bit bossy. She was originally pure white in color, but later gained her current Siamese cat markings after falling into an inkpot. Sagwa is very talented in calligraphy and is said by her parents to have the best artistic skills in the Miao family. She has a golden-yellow and salmon-red Miao Family collar on her neck. While her name literally means &quot;silly melon&quot;, it translates to an affectionate way of calling someone a fool.
* Dongwa Miao (冬瓜 &quot;dōngguā&quot;, winter melon) (voiced by Oliver Grainger) is the oldest child of the Miao family. Intelligent, competitive and sometimes a bit stubborn, Dongwa is independent and often prefers the company of the Alley Cats or solitary martial-arts practice to playing with his younger sisters. He is the only male child of this entire family and is also very caring of his sisters despite the typical sibling squabbles that occasionally occur between them. He is cream-colored and has the traditional Siamese markings and has a purple Miao Family collar on his neck.
* Sheegwa Miao (西瓜 &quot;xīguā&quot;, watermelon) (voiced by Jesse Vinet) is the youngest child of the Miao family. Curious, very friendly, cheerful and full of energy, Sheegwa is also very optimistic and ascribes good intentions to almost every creature she meets. She is pure white in color, except for a pink tinge on her cheeks, and has a folded right ear. She also has a pink Miao Family collar (with a purple flower symbol on it) on her neck.
* Baba Wim Bao Miao (爸爸寶寶 &quot;bàba bǎobǎo&quot;, &quot;father darling&quot;) (voiced by Arthur Holden) is the father of the Miao family. He is very strict with his children, and in matters of very hard work and duty, but also has a much softer, playful side as well. Baba also fancies himself a devotee of Chinese Opera, although he has Beat deafness. He and Mama are the official calligraphers of the Foolish Magistrate. Baba, like Dongwa, is cream-colored and has typical Siamese facial markings. When Angwan took care of him, she called him Bu-Gu, &quot;Cuckoo Bird&quot;. He is also voiced by Bruce Dinsmore in a flashback where he&#x27;s shown as a younger version of himself.
* Mama Shao Faing Miao (媽媽小風 &quot;māma xiǎo fēng&quot;, &quot;mother small wind&quot;) (voiced by Ellen David) is the mother of the Miao family. Like Baba, she is also a very loving but very strict parent, but is usually much more lenient and gentle than Baba. She and Sagwa have similar coloring and markings.
* Nai-Nai Miao (奶奶 &quot;nǎinai&quot;, paternal grandmother) (voiced by Sonja Ball) is the grandmother of the Miao family. Grey in color, she is old-fashioned, patient and full of wisdom. She often tells the kittens stories, and the family treats her as a respected ancestor. 
* Yeh-Yeh Miao (爺爺 &quot;yéyé&quot;, paternal grandfather) (voiced by Neil Shee) is the grandfather of the Miao family. Like Nai-Nai, he is very wise and patient. He is a good storyteller, and the kittens treat him with great love and respect.
* Uncle Miao (voiced by Neil Shee) is the paternal uncle of Sagwa and Baba&#x27;s brother. He&#x27;s very much into ancient local history.
* Mae-Mae Miao is an aunt of Sagwa and Baba&#x27;s in-law. She and her husband adopt a dog named Cha-Siu. That dog then became a cousin to the Miao kittens.
* Cha-Siu Miao (叉烧 &quot;chāshāo&quot;, cousin) (voiced by Daniel Brochu) is the adopted child of Uncle Miao and Aunt Chi-Chi, and a cousin of Sagwa, Dongwa and Sheegwa. He is a puppy dog and is very different than the rest of the family. Sagwa and Sheegwa are very happy to meet him for the first time and immediately bond with him. However, Dongwa isn&#x27;t very sure about him at first because he&#x27;s a dog and different than everyone else. After the Sleeve Dogs make fun of him for being a dog and not being able to do anything, Dongwa later comforts him and they bond together.
* Chi-Chi Miao (voiced by Susan Glover) is another aunt of Sagwa and Mama&#x27;s sister. She is an acrobat and teaches Sagwa and Sheegwa the art of acrobatics.
* Uncle Catfish (voiced by Richard Newman) is a mysterious Uncle to the Miao kittens who could also be a first cousin to Yeh-Yeh. He is half cat and half fish who lives in the water. Sagwa visited him once and he told her a tale of his great-grandmother. She was a cat who fell in the water to meet a fish and that made him who he is today.

===Humans===
* Shoo-Jee-Deh-Shan-Taiyeh Suen, the Foolish Magistrate is the ruler of the province, Shoo-Jee-Deh-Shan-Taiyeh (湑稽的縣太爺 &quot;xū jī de xiàn tàiyé&quot;, &quot;county high master of strain spirit ground-bowing&quot;) (voiced by Hiro Kanagawa) is a large and rather absent-minded man. He occasionally makes rules without any reason, or makes ill-conceived decisions under pressure from his wife, Tai-Tai, but for the most part he is portrayed as a just and reasonable ruler. He is very fond of his cats, both for their calligraphy skills and for their ability to keep away mice and rats, of which he is deathly afraid of. In one episode, when he says &quot;No rules, no race.&quot;, his phrase turns into a musical drumbeat song as a result of being chanted by him.
* Tai-Tai Suen (太太 &quot;tàitài&quot;, &quot;wife&quot;) (voiced by Khaira Ledeyo) is the Foolish Magistrate&#x27;s wife. She is a very irritable, strict, and status-conscious woman who really needs to prove her superiority to the &quot;common&quot; people of the village; however, she occasionally shows kindness and rationality, in which she sees the consequences of her actions and apologizes to those she has wronged. She is very attached to the Sleeve Dogs who live in her robe, and values the cats only when they can bring praise to the family. She has a niece called Angwan.
* The Three Daughters (voiced by Kathy Tsoi, Leanne Adachi and Rosa Lee, respectively) are the Magistrate&#x27;s children, each distinguished by their differently-colored robes. Ba-Do (白豆 &quot;bái dòu&quot;, &quot;white bean&quot;) is the oldest of the three, and usually wears pink. Ba-Do is the most prominent of her sisters, having received several episodes partly or entirely centered around her. Luk-Do (绿豆 &quot;lǜ dòu&quot;, &quot;green bean&quot;) is the middle daughter and usually wears yellow. Huang-Do (黄豆 &quot;huáng dòu&quot;, &quot;yellow bean&quot;) is the youngest daughter, the tallest of her sisters, and usually wears blue. The girls are generally spoiled, mischievous, and argumentative, but do love and care for each other, and can often be seen playing together.
* Chef Cook (voiced by Raugi Yu) not only prepares meals, but he also attends to medical care and other emergencies around the palace. He is a very good friend of the Reader. Of the humans, he seems to have the closest relationship with the Miao cats.
* Seeyeh Suen is the Advising Reader of the Rules Seeyeh (師爺 &quot;shīyé&quot;, &quot;division master&quot;) (voiced by Russell Yuen) is the Magistrate&#x27;s brother who is in charge of reading his rules to the villagers; informally, he and the Cook often serve as advisors to the Magistrate as well. He also served as a tutor to the three daughters, and in one episode is discovered to be a very talented poet as well. The reader is often the victim of mishaps caused by others in the palace.
* Jun (voiced by Annette Bening) is the new tutor to the three daughters who appears in the final episodes. She wears purple clothing and is shown to be from another village.
* Sir Richard (voiced by Simon Peacock) is a very clumsy English archaeologist who goes to the palace for tasks. He has brought Sagwa as his good luck kitten into caves and a hot air balloon to help find artifacts. They found the old poetry scrolls from the magistrate&#x27;s ancestor, and an ancient fossil in a balloon as they were always up for adventure.
===Best friends / allies===
* Fu-Fu (福蝠 &quot;fú fú&quot;, literally &quot;lucky bat&quot;) (voiced by Rick Jones) is Sagwa&#x27;s best friend and a sidekick. A cave-dwelling bat who wears round glasses, he is an extremely clumsy bat who often crashes into trees and other objects. He acts as Sagwa&#x27;s conscience, warning her against taking unneeded risks, and then rescues Sagwa from the consequences of her adventures.
* The Mice (all voiced by Jaclyn Linetsky) are a large group of other mice live unseen behind the Palace walls. They are close friends of the three kittens and do no harm to the Palace nor its inhabitants. However, the Foolish Magistrate and his family are very afraid of mice in general, so their presence must remain hidden. 
* Tung (voiced by Thor Bishopric) is a cricket that belonged to the magistrate that lived in a cage in his study. He sang a song that really annoyed everyone, except the Magistrate who loved him. Tai-Tai snuck behind his back to get rid of him and everyone else thought he died. With the help of Sagwa, he found his way back into the palace. He sang again, but everyone thought he was a different cricket.
* Hai-Yo (voiced by Thor Bishopric) is a bluebird. Dongwa accidentally hurt his wing in the alley. Dongwa tried to help him out and hide him in the clubhouse from the alleycats. He tried to get rid of him to impress his friends, but was looking for him in the end to see if he&#x27;s alright. They made up in the end. This bird loves flying and looking for worms in the alley. He also made a cameo appearance in &quot;Sagwa&#x27;s Lucky Bat&quot;, as he accidentally ran into FuFu while flying.
* Ping Wing (voiced by Sonja Ball) a pigeon kept by the magistrate in an episode. Sagwa and FuFu fought on who would get more attention for her. She hated the fighting between them and she only wanted to talk to them, if everyone made up. She&#x27;s also skilled at flying while making music.

===Other===
* The Alley Cats are a group of cats who live in the streets and alleys outside the palace grounds. They include &quot;bullies&quot; such as Wing Wing (voiced by Michael Yarmush), Jet Jet (voiced by Mitchell Rothpan), and Lik Lik (voiced by Terrence Scammell) who often tease the Miao kittens because of their &quot;goody-goody&quot; ways and privileged lives. Others, however, are good friends to their siblings Sagwa, Dongwa, and (to a lesser extent), Sheegwa, such as two female alley cats named &quot;Hun-Hun&quot; (voiced by Kathy Tsoi) and &quot;Ling&quot; (voiced by Kamiko Taka in her only mainstream appearance) and three male ones named &quot;Wong Ton&quot; (voiced by Ian James Corlett), Shao-Pao (voiced by Jesse Camacho) (from the birds, bees and silkworms&#x27; episode), and &quot;Fam&quot; (voiced by Kyle Fairlie).
* The Sleeve Dogs Ping (voiced by Dean Hagopian), Pong (voiced by Michel Perron), and Pang (voiced by Sonja Ball) are three small Pekingese dog triplets who live in the sleeves of Tai-Tai&#x27;s robe. They antagonize the cats and boast of their superior status, but invariably their taunting and plots cause them to appear ridiculous and get into lots of trouble in the end.
* Gunji (voiced by Ricky Mabe) is a large red cat that is owned by Tai-Tai&#x27;s aunt. She has a rooster pillow for her but when she was chasing Sagwa, Sagwa&#x27;s paw accidentally got stuck in the thread wrecking it. Gungi was blamed at first, but Sagwa told the truth of the accident then everyone knew what happened. In the end, Gungi apologized for being mean and Sagwa was rewarded by her parents.
* Fi-Fu (voiced by Dean Hagopian) and Fo-Fu (voiced by Michel Perron) are two bullies in a pack of bats that antagonized Fu-Fu and made fun of his confidence before he had to leave a full moon flight, and whom Sagwa once blamed as her kidnappers when making up a story about how she got a bad haircut.
* The Rat (voiced by Michael O&#x27; Reilly) is a hungry brown rodent who always breaks into the palace to steal food. He led onto the kittens&#x27; making deals with them before they realized they were tricked. He was always chased by other cats to leave the palace.
* Oogway (voiced by Howard Ryshpan) is an elderly tortoise. He guided Sagwa in the garden and showed her the beauty of it. He did sleep a lot, and got a rose thorn out of Sagwa&#x27;s foot. He also made cameo appearances in &quot;The Favorite&quot;, and &quot;Lord of the Flies&quot;. 
* Bei-Hu (voiced by Eleanor Noble) is a tribal cat with larger ears who are owned by traveling entertainers. He and his family do things much different than other cats, as they catch and eat locusts as a hobby. He also pretty smart as he taught Sagwa how to travel home quick and what&#x27;s East and West.

Many of the names of the characters derive from the Chinese language. Their spellings are romanizations (though not always Wade–Giles, but possibly dialects also), and differ from the standardized Pinyin system.

<doc id="361087" wikidata="Q1060334" url="?curid=361087" title="Chalumeau">
<text>The chalumeau (; ; plural chalumeaux) is a single-reed woodwind instrument of the late baroque and early classical eras. The chalumeau is a folk instrument that is the predecessor to the modern-day clarinet. It has a cylindrical bore with eight tone holes (seven in front and one in back for the thumb) and a broad mouthpiece with a single heteroglot reed (&quot;i.e.&quot; separate, not a continuous part of the instrument&#x27;s body) made of cane. Similar to the clarinet, the chalumeau overblows a twelfth.

==History==
The word &quot;chalumeau&quot; first begins to appear in writing during the 1630s, but may have been in use as early as the twelfth century. Several French dictionaries in the sixteenth century use the word to refer to various types of simple, idioglot reed-pipes all with tone holes. The heteroglot style reed (detached from the reed-plant&#x27;s sidewall) was later adopted in the seventeenth and into the eighteenth centuries. These single-pipe instruments probably evolved from earlier multiple-pipe instruments through the abandonment of the drone tube. (See Similar instruments, below. The etymology is discussed in detail at Shawm#Etymology.)

The use of the chalumeau originated in France and later spread to Germany by the late seventeenth century. By 1700, the chalumeau was an established instrument on the European musical scene. Around this time, well-known Nuremberg instrument maker Johann Christoph (J.C.) Denner made improvements to the chalumeau, eventually developing it into the Baroque clarinet. The chalumeau is distinguished by two keys (thought to be added by Denner), which cover tone holes drilled diametrically to each other. The position of these tone holes prohibits the instrument from overblowing, limiting its range to only twelve notes. In order to counteract the limited range, multiple sizes of chalumeau were produced ranging from bass to soprano.

Over a period of about 20 years, the clarinet became distinguishable from the chalumeau due to a number of structural improvements. The first and most important development was the displacement of the rear key up towards the mouthpiece. Denner also reduced the size of the hole and inserted a small tube to facilitate overblowing, greatly increasing the range of the instrument to nearly three octaves. The instrument was also lengthened to increase accuracy of tuning, the recorder-like foot joint of the chalumeau was replaced by a bell similar to the oboe, and a key on the lower joint was eventually added to sound a b’. This new instrument eventually became the Baroque clarinet and specialized in the higher &quot;clarino&quot; register, as opposed to the lower chalumeau register. In its early development, the clarinet could not be tuned across the range of the instrument, so the chalumeau was still used for music in the lower range. Later developments in the key work allowed better intonation throughout the range of the clarinet, and the chalumeau register on the clarinet eventually rendered the chalumeau itself superfluous. The limited range and modest strength of sound compared with the clarinet made the chalumeau increasingly impractical. By 1800, the chalumeau had disappeared from the repertoire entirely and the clarinet was well-established on the European musical scene.

These improvements are attributed to J.C. Denner, but may have also been an invention of his son Jacob Denner who was trained by his father. Another son, Johann David, helped with the business but is not recorded as an instrument builder. The Denners were the only instrument builders to produce both chalumeaux and clarinets.

==Music for the chalumeau==
Composers initially favored the chalumeau, but the clarinet soon overtook it in repertoire and ubiquity. Estienne Roger in Amsterdam published a set of duets for two chalumeaux in 1706 (prior to the first duets for clarinet). And in 1716, the same publisher released six volumes of duets for chalumeaux. In the first decades of the eighteenth century, the chalumeau was especially popular in the Habsburg court, as evidenced by chalumeau parts in over forty operas and oratorios, and the Denners had many orders for chalumeaux from royalty all over Europe. Composers Fux, the Bononcini brothers, Zelenka, de Rossi, Vivaldi, Telemann and Hasse wrote for the chalumeau but chalumeau parts were not common in the second half of the century. Graupner wrote extensively for all sizes of chalumeaux and featured the instrument, often in groups of two or three, in numerous Ouverture-Suites, Concertos, Church Cantatas and Trio Sonatas. During the brief revival of chalumeau after 1760, Florian Gassmann included a chalumeau part in two pieces, and chalumeau parts were included in several ballets in the 1770s. But later renditions of these pieces transposed the chalumeau parts to clarinet or flute. The chalumeau was often included in music dictionaries until the early nineteenth century.

==Timbre and tone==
The chalumeau sounds much lower than one might expect, due to the acoustical nature of a cylindrical stopped pipe. It has an intimate, cantabile-like quality – as opposed to the trumpet-like sound of the Baroque clarinet – and is very similar to the sound of speaking.

==Historical and modern chalumeaux==
About ten original chalumeaux are extant, but modern craftsmen produce replicas based on these original instruments. Of the original instruments, most are made of boxwood and all feature two keys placed opposite each other to be played by the thumb and first finger of the left hand. The mouthpieces of these instruments usually have the reed placed on top so that it vibrates against the upper lip when played. The surviving chalumeaux were made between the beginning of the eighteenth century and about 1760 by five known instrument makers including J.C. Denner, W. Kress, Liebau, Klenig, and Muller. Of these instruments, there is one soprano and one bass chalumeau, several tenor and alto chalumeaux, and one rare chalumeau d’amour (aka Mezzo-Soprano chalumeau). The chalumeau d’amour has a bulbous bell like its rare contemporary the clarinette d’amour (aka &quot;Mezzo-Soprano Clarinet&quot;) and the modern-day English horn or &quot;Alto Oboe&quot;.

Present day makers of replica chalumeaux include Peter van der Poel, Andreas Schöni, R. Tutz, François Masson, and Guntram Wolf. Other makers, including Tupian, Hahl, and Kunath, produce modern adaptations of the chalumeau.

==Similar instruments==
Similar single-reed folk instruments with single, cylindrical tubes are found in many Arabic and European cultures throughout history. Examples include the albogue, alboka, diplica, hornpipe, pibgorn, and sipsi. 

In England, by 1698 a similar instrument was known as the mock trumpet. The mock trumpet predated the chalumeau and may be one of the primary predecessors of both the chalumeau and clarinet.

A similar instrument called the xaphoon (also called &quot;Maui bamboo sax&quot; or &quot;pocket sax&quot;) was developed by Hawaiian craftsman Brian Wittman. A similar instrument called the venova was created and sold by Yamaha Corporation in 2017.

==Notes==
The name &#x27;chalumeau&#x27; is used by European organ-builders to denote an eight-foot short-resonator organ stop used for color effects. This was first encountered in the organ of the Frauenkirche at Dresden and was built by celebrated organ builder Gottfried Silbermann between 1732 and 1736. Silbermann was so pleased with the sound of this new invention that he included it in most of his later organs.

<doc id="361093" wikidata="Q27547" url="?curid=361093" title="Sandwich tern">
<text>The Sandwich tern (Thalasseus sandvicensis) is a tern in the family Laridae. It is very closely related to the lesser crested tern (&quot;T. bengalensis&quot;), Chinese crested tern (&quot;T. bernsteini&quot;), Cabot&#x27;s tern (&quot;T. acuflavidus&quot;), and elegant tern (&quot;T. elegans&quot;) and has been known to interbreed with both elegant and lesser crested. It breeds in the Palearctic from Europe to the Caspian Sea and winters in South Africa, India, and Sri Lanka.

The Sandwich tern is a medium-large tern with grey upperparts, white underparts, a yellow-tipped black bill, and a shaggy black crest which becomes less extensive in winter with a white crown. Young birds bear grey and brown scalloped plumage on their backs and wings. It is a vocal bird. It nests in a ground scrape and lays one to three eggs.

Like all &quot;Thalasseus&quot; terns, the Sandwich tern feeds by plunge diving for fish, usually in marine environments, and the offering of fish by the male to the female is part of the courtship display.

==Taxonomy==
The terns are small to medium-sized seabirds, gull-like in appearance, but usually with a more delicate, lighter build and shorter, weaker legs. They have long, pointed wings, which gives them a fast buoyant flight, and often a deeply forked tail. Most species are grey above and white below, and have a black cap which is reduced or flecked with white in the winter.

The Sandwich tern was originally described by ornithologist John Latham in 1787 as &quot;Sterna sandvicensis&quot;, but was moved to its current genus &quot;Thalasseus&quot; (Boie, 1822) following mitochondrial DNA studies which confirmed that the three types of head pattern (white crown, black cap, and black cap with a white blaze on the forehead) found among the terns corresponded to distinct clades. The current genus name is derived from Greek &quot;Thalassa&quot;, &quot;sea&quot;, and &quot;sandvicensis&quot;, which, like the English name, refers to Sandwich, Kent, Latham&#x27;s type locality.

This bird has no subspecies. Two former subspecies are now treated as a separate species, Cabot&#x27;s tern (&quot;T. acuflavidus&quot;); this breeds on the Atlantic coasts of North America, northern and eastern South America, and has wandered to Western Europe.

==Description==

This is a medium-large tern, long with an wingspan, which is unlikely to be confused within most of its range. The weight ranges from 200–300 g.

The Sandwich tern&#x27;s thin, sharp bill is black with a yellow tip. Its short legs are black. Its upper wings are pale grey and its underparts white, and this tern looks very pale in flight, although the primary flight feathers darken during the summer. In winter, the adult Sandwich tern&#x27;s forehead becomes extensively white. Juvenile Sandwich terns have dark tips to their tails, an all-blackish bill (lacking the yellow tip, but sometimes yellowish at the base) and a scaly appearance on their back and wings, like juvenile roseate terns but with less black on the crown.

The lesser crested tern and elegant tern differ in having all-orange bills; lesser crested also differs in having a grey rump and marginally stouter bill, and elegant in having a slightly longer, more slender bill. The Chinese crested tern is more similar to the Sandwich tern, but has a reversal of the bill colour, yellow with a black tip; it does not overlap in range with the Sandwich tern so confusion is unlikely. Cabot&#x27;s tern is the most similar, sharing the black bill with a yellow tip, but differs in the bill being obviously stouter, and also differs in moult timing, losing its black forehead earlier in the summer. Its juveniles also lack the scaly pattern of Sandwich tern, being a plainer grey (though this can be confused with first-winter plumage of Sandwich tern).

The Sandwich tern is a vocal bird; its call is a characteristic loud grating &quot;kear-ik&quot; or &quot;kerr ink&quot;.

==Behaviour==
This species breeds in very dense colonies on coasts and islands, and exceptionally inland on suitable large freshwater lakes close to the coast. It nests in a ground scrape and lays one to three eggs. Unlike some of the smaller white terns, it is not very aggressive toward potential predators, relying on the sheer density of the nests—often only apart and nesting close to other more aggressive species such as Arctic terns and black-headed gulls to avoid predation.

Like all &quot;Thalasseus&quot; terns, the Sandwich tern feeds by plunge-diving for fish, almost invariably from the sea. It usually dives directly, and not from the &quot;stepped-hover&quot; favoured by Arctic terns. The offering of fish by the male to the female is part of the courtship display.

==Status==
The Sandwich tern has an extensive global range estimated at . It has a population estimated at 460,000–500,000 individuals. Population trends have not been quantified, but the species is not believed to approach the thresholds for the population decline criterion of the IUCN Red List (i.e., declining more than 30% in ten years or three generations). For these reasons, the species is evaluated as least concern.

The Sandwich tern is among the taxa to which the Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds (AEWA) applies. Parties to the agreement are required to engage in a wide range of conservation actions, which are describes in a detailed action plan. This plan should address key issues such as species and habitat conservation, management of human activities, research, education, and implementation.

Their habit of breeding in very dense colonies made them highly vulnerable to the 2021–2023 highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) outbreaks, with mass mortality in numerous colonies in northwestern Europe in 2022.

<doc id="361099" wikidata="Q747322" url="?curid=361099" title="Madurodam">
<text>Madurodam () is a miniature park and tourist attraction in the Scheveningen district of The Hague in the Netherlands. It is home to a range of 1:25 scale model replicas of famous Dutch landmarks, historical cities and large developments. The park was opened in 1952 and has since been visited by tens of millions of visitors. The entirety of net proceeds from the park go towards various charities in the Netherlands.

==Name==
Madurodam was named after George Maduro, a Dutch law student from Curaçao who fought the Nazi occupation forces, first as a lieutenant in the army and later as a member of the Dutch resistance, and who died at Dachau concentration camp in 1945. In 1946, Maduro was posthumously awarded the Medal of Knight Fourth class of the Military Order of William, the highest and oldest military decoration in the Kingdom of the Netherlands, for the valor he had demonstrated in the Battle of the Netherlands against German troops.

==History==
===Idea for the park===
Mrs B. Boon-van der Starp was a member of a foundation for the Dutch Students Sanatorium. In this sanatorium students with tuberculosis could obtain treatment, and could also study. Financial support was needed to pay for their convalescent care. Mrs Boon-van der Starp heard about Bekonscot, a miniature park in Beaconsfield, England. This park generated large profits, a large part of which was donated to a hospital in London each year.

After a meeting with Mrs Boon-van der Starp, George Maduro&#x27;s parents donated the funds needed for the Madurodam project, as a memorial to their son. S.J. Bouma was appointed architect of Madurodam, and visited Bekonscot because Mrs Boon-van der Starp wanted the new park to be similar. After his visit he created a plan for Madurodam and came up with a theme: &quot;Het stadje met de glimlach&quot; (&quot;The little city with the smile&quot;).

===Mayor and city council===

On 2 July 1952, the then teenage Princess Beatrix was appointed mayor of Madurodam, and was given a tour of her town. When Beatrix became Queen, she relinquished this title. After her resignation a new tradition arose: the city council would annually select a mayor from their midst. All members of the youth council are The Hague students. Every year schools from The Hague can nominate students to take part in the youth council.

The youth council members are also members of the disbursement committee at Madurodam. The disbursement committee manages charities – Madurodam has its own fund which provides financial support to institutions that organize activities for young people.

===Renovations===

In 2011, research showing declining public interest prompted the park management to invest in a large-scale renovation, at a cost of €8 million, in time for the park&#x27;s 60th anniversary in 2012. For this purpose the park was closed to the public between November 2011 and April 2012.

The park is now divided into three themes: &quot;water, as a friend and an enemy&quot;; &quot;historical cities&quot;; and &quot;The Netherlands as an inspiration for the world.&quot; Each theme offers different activities – from light shows to mixing music. Small coin slots trigger bridges, factories or an oil tanker on fire. While aesthetic improvements have been made, the informative aspect has also been improved. Small television stands show brief video footage or in-depth information. Visitors receive chipped cards upon entry, which can be used to trigger these.

On 7 April 2012, Madurodam opened its doors to the public again. The official opening was on 21 April 2012 with then-Queen Beatrix.

==The park==

===Modelling===
Every object in Madurodam has been built at a scale of 1:25. When the management decides that a specific miniature is to be made for Madurodam, the builders first research all aspects of the actual building. They research the shape, color and all other properties of that object, by analysing many pictures. After this they start making the models. A computer measures everything and sends all information to a machine that makes the physical model. The model goes to the painting room, where it gets the final look. In this painting room restorations also take place. Because most of the miniatures are outdoors, they need regular paint retouches.

===Realism===
Madurodam strives to show a realistic view of The Netherlands in a scaled-down environment. Everything, including flora and street decoration, is modeled to scale. Producing scaled-down trees is time-consuming. Also there are a lot of little people around the buildings. This shows the real life of the Dutch people. These &quot;residents&quot; also change with the weather. In the winter they wear jackets and warm clothes and in the summer they wear T-shirts. The &quot;residents&quot; of Madurodam have become more and more multicultural, and include some who appear to have come from other countries (immigrants), reflecting real life in The Netherlands.

===Fantasitron===
Fantasitron is a 3D selfie photo booth where patrons can have 3D models of themselves created by software from pictures taken in the photo booth. A third-party printing company such as Shapeways prints and ships manufactured models to patrons.

===Buildings and structures===
Although Madurodam is mainly a miniature city, a collection of Dutch landmarks is also found amidst the landscapes.
They include:
* Rijksmuseum
* Binnenhof (where the government is located)
* Amsterdam Airport Schiphol, The Netherlands&#x27; main international airport
* Port of Rotterdam, world&#x27;s third-largest port
* Dom Tower of Utrecht
* Traditional Dutch canal houses
* Tulip fields
* Windmills
* Skyline of the city of Rotterdam, like the Erasmus bridge, Euromast, central train station, cubes houses and Unilever HQ buildings.

===The Dutch court===
Unlike the rest of the park, the &quot;Hof van Nederland&quot; (Dutch court) is not built as a miniature: it is life-sized. In 4 minutes the attraction explains the beginning of the Netherlands in 1572. The attraction is inspired by the &quot;Hof van Nederland&quot; in Dordrecht and was opened on 19 July 2015.

==Inspiration==
The park was the inspiration for Storybook Land, an attraction opened at Disneyland in 1956 and at Disneyland Paris in 1994. Additionally, it was a visit to Madurodam that inspired Fernando de Ercilla Ayestarán to promote construction of the Catalunya en Miniatura project, one of the largest miniature parks in the world, opened in Catalonia, Spain, in 1983.

<text>The honey badger (Mellivora capensis), also known as the ratel ( or ), is a mammal widely distributed across Africa, Southwest Asia, and the Indian subcontinent. It is the only living species in both the genus &quot;Mellivora&quot; and the subfamily Mellivorinae. It has a fairly long body, with a distinctly thick-set and broad back, and remarkably loose skin, allowing the badger to turn and twist freely within it. The largest terrestrial mustelid in Africa, the honey badger measures long and weighs up to . Sexual dimorphism has been recorded in this species, with males being larger and heavier than females. There are two pairs of mammae, and an anal pouch which, unusual among mustelids, is eversible, a trait shared with hyenas and mongooses. 

The honey badger is a solitary animal that can be active at any time of day, depending on the location. It is primarily a carnivorous species and has few natural predators because of its thick skin, strength and ferocious defensive abilities. Adults maintain large home ranges, and display scent-marking behavior. The species has no fixed breeding period. After a gestation of 50–70 days, a female will give birth to an average of one to two cubs that will remain under her care for 1–1¼ years. Because of its wide range and occurrence in a variety of habitats, it is listed as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List. In popular media, the honey badger is best known as an aggressive, intelligent animal that is fearless and tough in nature

==Taxonomy==
&quot;Viverra capensis&quot; was the scientific name used by Johann Christian Daniel von Schreber in 1777 who described a honey badger skin from the Cape of Good Hope. &quot;Mellivorae&quot; was proposed as name for the genus by Gottlieb Conrad Christian Storr in 1780, while
Mellivorina was proposed as a tribe name by John Edward Gray in 1865. The honey badger is the only species of the genus &quot;Mellivora&quot;. Although in the 1860s it was assigned to the badger subfamily, the Melinae, it is now generally agreed that it bears few similarities to the Melinae. It is much more closely related to the marten subfamily, Guloninae, and furthermore is assigned its own subfamily, Mellivorinae. 

The genus name, &quot;Mellivora&quot;, is derived from Latin, meaning &quot;honey eater&quot;, while the species name, &quot;capensis&quot;, pertains to the location where the type specimen was discovered: the Cape of Good Hope. The origin of the word &quot;ratel&quot; is uncertain, but is thought to either be derived from &quot;ratel&quot;, which is Dutch for rattle or from the Dutch word &quot;raat&quot;, meaning honeycomb.

===Evolution===
The species first appeared during the middle Pliocene in Asia. A number of extinct relatives are known dating back at least 7 million years to the Late Miocene. These include &quot;Mellivora benfieldi&quot; from South Africa and Italy, &quot;Promellivora&quot; from Pakistan, and &quot;Howellictis&quot; from Chad. More distant relatives include &quot;Eomellivora&quot;, which evolved into several different species in both the Old and New World, and the giant, long-legged &quot;Ekorus&quot; from Kenya.

===Subspecies===
In the 19th and 20th centuries, 16 zoological specimens of the honey badger were described and proposed as subspecies. Points taken into consideration in assigning different subspecies include size and the extent of whiteness or greyness on the back. , 12 subspecies are recognised as valid taxa:
==Description==

The honey badger has a fairly long body, but is distinctly thick-set and broad across the back. Its skin is remarkably loose, and allows the animal to turn and twist freely within it. The skin around the neck is thick, an adaptation to fighting conspecifics. The head is small and flat, with a short muzzle. The eyes are small, and the ears are little more than ridges on the skin, another possible adaptation to avoiding damage while fighting. The honey badger has short and sturdy legs, with five toes on each foot. The feet are armed with very strong claws, which are short on the hind legs and remarkably long on the forelimbs. It is a partially plantigrade animal whose soles are thickly padded and naked up to the wrists. The tail is short and is covered in long hairs, save for below the base.

The honey badger is the largest terrestrial mustelid in Africa. Adults measure in shoulder height and in body length, with the tail adding another . Females are smaller than males. In Africa, males weigh while females weigh on average. The mean weight of adult honey badgers from different areas has been reported at anywhere between , with a median of roughly , per various studies. This positions it as the third largest known badger, after the European badger and hog badger, and fourth largest extant terrestrial mustelid after additionally the wolverine. However, the average weight of three wild females from Iraq was reported as , about the typical weight of male wolverines or male European badgers in late autumn, indicating that they can attain much larger than typical sizes in favourable conditions. However, an adult female and two males in India were relatively small weighing and a median of . Skull length is in males and for females.

There are two pairs of mammae. The honey badger possesses an anal pouch which, unusual among mustelids, is , a trait shared with hyenas and mongooses. The smell of the pouch is reportedly &quot;suffocating&quot;, and may assist in calming bees when raiding beehives.

The skull greatly resembles a larger version of that of a marbled polecat.
The dental formula is: . The teeth often display signs of irregular development, with some teeth being exceptionally small, set at unusual angles or absent altogether. Honey badgers of the subspecies &quot;signata&quot; have a second lower molar on the left side of their jaws, but not the right. Although it feeds predominantly on soft foods, the honey badger&#x27;s cheek teeth are often extensively worn. The canine teeth are exceptionally short for carnivores. The papillae of the tongue are sharp and pointed, which assists in processing tough foods.

The winter fur is long, being long on the lower back, and consists of sparse, coarse, bristle-like hairs, with minimal underfur. Hairs are even sparser on the flanks, belly and groin. The summer fur is shorter (being only long on the back) and even sparser, with the belly being half bare. The sides of the head and lower body are pure black. A large white band covers the upper body, from the top of the head to the base of the tail. Honey badgers of the &quot;cottoni&quot; subspecies are unique in being completely black.

==Distribution and habitat==
The honey badger ranges through most of sub-Saharan Africa, from the Western Cape, South Africa, to southern Morocco and southwestern Algeria and outside Africa through Arabia, Iran, and Western Asia to Turkmenistan and the Indian Peninsula. It is known to range from sea level to as much as in the Moroccan High Atlas and in Ethiopia&#x27;s Bale Mountains. Throughout its range, the honey badger is predominantly found in deserts, mountainous regions and forests. These habitats can have an annual rainfall of as low as 100 mm in dry, arid regions to as high as 2,000 mm. 

==Behaviour and ecology==
The honey badger is mostly solitary, but has also been sighted in Africa to hunt in pairs. It also uses old burrows of aardvark, warthog and termite mounds. In the Serengeti National Park, the activity levels of the honey badger was largely dependent on the time of year; in the dry season, it was mostly nocturnal, in contrast to the wet season, when it remained active throughout the day, reaching its zenith during crepuscular hours. In the Sariska Tiger Reserve in India, a study concluded that the honey badger was highly nocturnal; a study in the Cauvery Wildlife Sanctuary yielded similar results. The honey badger is a skilled digger, able to dig tunnels into hard ground in 10 minutes. These burrows usually have only one entry, are usually only long with a nesting chamber that is not lined with any bedding. Adults control a patch of land known as a home range. Females establish a large home range that changes in size depending foremost on the abundance of food, and particularly when rearing young, while males&#x27; considerably larger home ranges depend on the availability of females in heat; this often leads to males&#x27; home ranges intersecting with that of about 13 females. Adult males have an average home range of , compared to females&#x27; average of . It is suggested that adult males have a dominance hierarchy, and that females tend to avoid contact with each other, displaying less profound territorial behavior in spite of the 25% overlap in female home ranges. In the wild, honey badgers were confirmed to scent-mark while squatting, and it is suggested that this behaviour is an &quot;important form of communication&quot;. They frequently scent-mark their territories with anal gland excretions, feces and urine. According to personal accounts, honey badgers in captivity were said to scent-mark in a squatting position, releasing fluid from their anal glands. 

The honey badger is famous for its strength, ferocity and toughness. It is known to savagely and fearlessly attack almost any other species when escape is impossible, reportedly even repelling much larger predators such as lion and hyena. In some instances, honey badgers deter large predators by unleashing a pungent yellow liquid produced by the anal glands. They accompany this with a threat display characterized by rattling noises, goosebumps, a straight, upward-facing tail, and general charging behaviour while also holding their heads up high. In a 2018 study, it was found that the presence of large predators had no effect on the population of honey badgers in the Serengeti. This is likely indicative of the honey badger seeking areas comparable to those favoured by larger predators, and perhaps adopting a similar ecological niche. Bee stings, porcupine quills, and animal bites rarely penetrate their skin. If horses, cattle, or Cape buffalos intrude upon a honey badger&#x27;s burrow, it will attack them. In the Cape Province it is a potential prey species of the African leopard and African rock pythons.

The voice of the honey badger is a hoarse &quot;khrya-ya-ya-ya&quot; sound. When mating, males emit loud grunting sounds. Cubs vocalise through plaintive whines, and when confronting dogs, honey badgers scream like bear cubs.

===Diet===
The honey badger has the least specialised diet of the weasel family next to the wolverine. It accesses a large part of its food by digging it out of burrows.
It often raids beehives in search of both bee larvae and honey. It also feeds on insects, frogs, tortoises, turtles, lizards, rodents, snakes, birds and eggs. It also eats berries, roots and bulbs. When foraging for vegetables, it lifts stones or tears bark from trees. Some individuals have even been observed to chase away lion cubs from kills. It devours all parts of its prey, including skin, hair, feathers, flesh and bones, holding its food down with its forepaws. It feeds on a wide range of animals and seems to subsist primarily on small vertebrates. Honey badgers studied in Kgalagadi Transfrontier Park preyed largely on geckos and skinks (47.9% of prey species), gerbils and mice (39.7% of prey). The bulk of its prey comprised species weighing more than such as cobras, young African rock python and South African springhare. The study also found that males and females caught similar sized-prey, despite their disparity in size.
In the Kalahari, honey badgers were also observed to attack domestic sheep and goats, as well as kill and eat black mambas. A honey badger was suspected to have broken up the shells of tent tortoises in the Nama Karoo. In India, honey badgers are said to dig up buried human corpses.

Despite popular belief, there is no evidence that honeyguides guide the honey badger. In a 2022 study in the Southern Kalahari Desert, it was found that black-backed jackals fed in such a way that took food away from the honey badger, leading to a 5% decline in total food intake above ground. The honey badgers were preyed upon by larger predators such as spotted hyenas, leopards, and lions.

===Reproduction===
The honey badger does not have a specific mating period, and instead breeds at any time of the year. Females have an estimated oestrus period of about 14 days. Their gestation period is thought to last 50–70 days, usually resulting in one to two cubs, which are born blind and hairless. Females give birth in a den, and transport their young from one shelter to another for the first three months. When foraging, females abandon their cubs, and return to suckle them in the den; sightings of females suckling young are generally rare, however, in one instance, a female suckling her young outside the den was observed laying in a supine position with her cub sitted atop her abdomen in an upside down orientation. At about three to five weeks of age, cubs begin developing the adult black-and-white coat, and at eight to twelve weeks, they follow their mother on foraging expeditions; weaning occurs during this period. On average, females will remain with their cubs for 1–1¼ years and during that time, they will teach cubs important life skills such as climbing, foraging and hunting. Not all cubs reach adulthood; in one study, the mortality rate of cubs in the Kgalagadi Transfrontier Park was 37%, and was caused by predation, infanticide and starvation. Although the exact age of when males reach sexually mature is uncertain, several factors indicate that they reach sexual maturity at two to three years of age. Also uncertain is when females reach sexual maturity, however, they are thought to be sexually mature on the onset of independency, the largest indicator of this being the migration of females outside their mothers range not too long after the separation. The lifespan of the species in the wild is unknown, though captive individuals have been known to live for approximately 24 years.

=== Pathogens ===
Honey badgers are known to be susceptible to rabies. In one instance, a seemingly rabid honey badger attacked a dog and a couple of people in separate attacks within the span of two days before being shot. The incident occurred in Kromdraai, South Africa in July 2021. An autopsy of the dead individual confirmed that the rabies arose from canines, both wild and domestic. Parasites that infect honey badgers include flatworms such as &quot;Strongyloides akbari,&quot; &quot;Uncinaria stenocephala&quot;, &quot;Artyfechinostomum sufrartyfex&quot;, &quot;Trichostrongylidae&quot;, &quot;Physaloptera&quot;, &quot;Ancylostoma&quot;, and &quot;Rictulariidae&quot;. There have also been cases of parasitic worm infections. Blood-sucking parasites known to infect this species include &quot;Haemaphysalis indica&quot;, &quot;Amblyomma javanensis&quot; and &quot;Rhipicephalus microplus&quot;. In addition, the honey badger has been recorded with feline parvovirus.

==Status==
As of 2016, the honey badger is listed as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List due to its extensive range. It is mostly threatened by killings from beekeepers and farmers, sometimes with the use of poisons or traps, and is used in traditional medicine and as bushmeat. In other cases, control programs that were meant for other predators such as caracals have led to unintentional honey badger deaths. It is thought that many honey badger populations were eradicated as a result of poisoning alone.

The species has been given protection in numerous range countries, such as Algeria, Morocco, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, and Turkmenistan. It also occurs in protected areas in many countries, such as the Kruger National Park in South Africa, and the Ustyurt Nature Reserve in Kazakhstan. In Ghana and Botswana, the resident populations are included under CITES Appendix III, while the Indian population is listed in the Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972, as Scheduled-I.

==Relationships with humans==

In popular media, the honey badger has garnered a reputation for being an intelligent, fearless animal, with some people, such as Nick Cummins, adopting the name to symbolize these attributes. Nicknames or titles given to this species include &quot;pound for pound, the most powerful creature in Africa&quot;, &quot;most fearless animal in the world&quot;, &quot;bravest animal in the world&quot; and &quot;meanest animal in the world&quot;. These names stem from the honey badger&#x27;s ability to repel larger predators, which has been highlighted in such a way as to gives the public audience the impression of invincibility. The noises made when performing the threat display are cited as another component of the honey badger&#x27;s invincible image. Due to its ability of using tools, the honey badger is considered an intelligent creature and according to a BBC documentary titled &quot;Honey Badgers: Masters of Mayhem&quot;, captive individuals may work with others as cohesive unit to help unlock gates or enclosures with the use of tools; this has been met with skepticism. The species&#x27; supposed fearless attitude is highlighted in the popular comic book &quot;Randall&#x27;s Guide to Nastyass Animals: Honey Badger Don&#x27;t Care&quot;.

The native people of Somalia believe that a man becomes infertile after being bitten by a honey badger, hence the wide berth they give to the species.

===Human–wildlife conflict===
Honey badgers often become serious poultry predators. Because of their strength and persistence, they are difficult to deter. They are known to rip thick planks from hen-houses or burrow underneath stone foundations. Surplus killing is common during these events, with one incident resulting in the death of 17 Muscovy ducks and 36 chickens. Because of the toughness and looseness of their skin, honey badgers are very difficult to hunt with dogs. Their skin is hard to penetrate, and its looseness allows them to twist and turn on their attackers when held. The only safe grip on a honey badger is on the back of the neck.

During the British occupation of Basra in 2007, rumours of &quot;man-eating badgers&quot; emerged from the local population, including allegations that these beasts were released by the British troops, something that the British categorically denied. A British army spokesperson said that the badgers were &quot;native to the region but rare in Iraq&quot; and &quot;are usually only dangerous to humans if provoked&quot;. The honey badger has also been reported to dig up human corpses in India.
In Kenya, the honey badger is a major reservoir of rabies and is suspected to be a significant contributor to the sylvatic cycle of the disease.

=== In captivity ===

Honey badgers are kept in captivity as pets and to be exhibited in zoos. They are said to be easy to tame, with some reportedly ceasing the utilization of their anal glands. Despite this, when in contact with a handler, honey badgers often release anal gland secretions.

<text>Les Liaisons dangereuses (; English: Dangerous Liaisons) is a French epistolary novel by Pierre Choderlos de Laclos, first published in four volumes by Durand Neveu from March 23, 1782.

It is the story of the Marquise de Merteuil and the Vicomte de Valmont, two amoral lovers-turned-rivals who amuse themselves by ruining others and who ultimately destroy each other. 

It has been seen as depicting the corruption and depravity of the French nobility shortly before the French Revolution, and thereby attacking the Ancien Régime despite having been written nearly a decade prior to those events. The author aspired to &quot;write a work which departed from the ordinary, which made a noise, and which would remain on earth after his death&quot;.

As an epistolary novel, the book is composed of letters written by the various characters to each other. In particular, the letters between Valmont and the Marquise make up the majority of the plot, along with those of Cécile de Volanges and Madame de Tourvel.

It has been adapted multiple times, including the successful 1985 play and subsequent award-winning 1988 film adaptation.

==Plot summary==

The Marquise de Merteuil is determined to corrupt the young Cécile de Volanges, whose mother has only recently brought her out of a convent to be married to Merteuil&#x27;s previous lover, who has discarded her rudely. At the same time the notorious Vicomte de Valmont is determined to seduce the virtuous, married, and therefore inaccessible Madame de Tourvel, who is staying with his aunt while her husband is away on a court case. Cécile falls in love with the Chevalier Danceny (her young music tutor), and Merteuil and Valmont pretend to help the secret lovers in order to gain their trust and manipulate them later to benefit their own schemes.
Merteuil first suggests that the Vicomte should seduce Cécile in order to enact her revenge on Cécile&#x27;s future husband but Valmont refuses, finding the challenge too easy and preferring to devote himself to seducing Madame de Tourvel. He is however interested in resuming their affair. Merteuil promises Valmont that if he seduces Madame de Tourvel and provides her with written proof of seduction, she will spend the night with him. 

Valmont befriends Tourvel by convincing her that he has changed his rakish ways and become a virtuous man, but he finds seducing her to be a far greater challenge than his previous conquests. 

Valmont is infuriated on discovering that Cécile&#x27;s mother has written to Madame de Tourvel to warn her about his bad character. He avenges himself by seducing Cécile as Merteuil had suggested. Meanwhile, Merteuil takes Danceny as her lover.

By the time Valmont has succeeded in seducing Madame de Tourvel, he seems to have fallen in love with her. Jealous, Merteuil tricks him into deserting Madame de Tourvel, and reneges on her promise of spending the night with him. In retaliation, Valmont reveals that he prompted Danceny to reunite with Cécile, leaving Merteuil abandoned yet again. Merteuil declares war on Valmont and reveals to Danceny that Valmont has seduced Cécile.

Danceny and Valmont duel, and Valmont is fatally wounded. Before he dies, he gives Danceny the letters proving Merteuil&#x27;s own involvement. These letters are sufficient to ruin her reputation, and she flees to the countryside, after contracting smallpox. Her face is left permanently scarred and she is rendered blind in one eye. She loses her greatest asset, her beauty, as well as her reputation and much of her fortune. Desperate with guilt and grief, Madame de Tourvel succumbs to a fever and dies, while Cécile returns to the convent, dishonoured.

==Literary significance and criticism==

&quot;Les Liaisons dangereuses&quot; is celebrated for its exploration of seduction, revenge and malice, presented in the form of fictional letters collected and published by a fictional author. The book was viewed as scandalous at the time of its publication, though the real intentions of the author remain unknown. It has been suggested that Laclos&#x27;s intention was the same as that of his fictional author in the novel; to write a morality tale about the French nobility of the Ancien Régime. The theory has been questioned on several grounds; Laclos enjoyed the patronage of France&#x27;s most senior aristocrat—Louis Philippe II, Duke of Orléans. All the characters in the story are aristocrats, including the virtuous ones like Madame de Tourvel and Madame de Rosemonde and many royalist and conservative figures enjoyed the book, including Queen Marie Antoinette, which suggests that—despite its scandalous reputation—it was not viewed as a political work until the French Revolution made it appear as such, with the benefit of hindsight.

Wayland Young notes that most critics have viewed the work as
He argues that
In a well-known essay on &quot;Les Liaisons dangereuses&quot;, which has often been used as a preface to French editions of the novel, André Malraux argues that, despite its debt to the libertine tradition, &quot;Les Liaisons dangereuses&quot; is more significant as the introduction of a new kind of character in French fiction. Malraux writes that the Marquise de Merteuil and the Vicomte de Valmont are creations &quot;without precedent&quot;; they are &quot;the first [in European literature] whose acts are determined by an ideology&quot;.

&quot;Les Liaisons dangereuses&quot; is a literary counter-thesis to the epistolary novel as exemplified by Richardson&#x27;s &quot;Pamela; or, Virtue Rewarded&quot;. Whereas Richardson uses the technique of letters to provide the reader with a feeling of knowing the protagonist&#x27;s true and intimate thoughts, Laclos&#x27; use of this literary device is the opposite: by presenting the reader with grossly conflicting views from the same writer when addressing different recipients, it is left to the reader to reconcile story, intentions and characters behind the letters. The use of duplicitous characters with one virtuous face can be viewed as a complex criticism of the immensely popular naïve moral epistolary novel.

==Adaptations==

The novel has been adapted into various media, under many different names.

<text>Kota Kinabalu (; formerly known as Jesselton), colloquially referred to as KK, is the state capital of Sabah, Malaysia. It is also the capital of the Kota Kinabalu District as well as the West Coast Division of Sabah. The city is located on the northwest coast of Borneo facing the South China Sea. The Tunku Abdul Rahman National Park lies to its west and Mount Kinabalu, which gave the city its name, is located to its east. Kota Kinabalu has a population of 452,058 according to the 2010 census; when the adjacent Penampang and Tuaran districts are included, the metro area has a combined population of 628,725. The 2020 Census revealed an increase in the municipal population to 500,421, while the wider area including the Penampang and Putatan districts had a population of 731,406.

Historically, the Kadazandusuns called the area by the name of Dondoung. In the 15th century, the area of Kota Kinabalu was under the influence of Bruneian Empire. In the 19th century, the British North Borneo Company (BNBC) first set up a settlement near the Gaya Island. However, it was destroyed by fire in 1897 by a local leader named Mat Salleh. In July 1899, the place located opposite to the Gaya Island was identified as a suitable place for settlements. Development in the area was started soon after that; and the place was named &quot;Api-api&quot; before it was renamed after Sir Charles Jessel, the vice-chairman of BNBC, as &quot;Jesselton&quot;. Jesselton became a major trading port in the area, and was connected to the North Borneo Railway. Jesselton was largely destroyed during World War II. The Japanese occupation of Jesselton provoked several local uprisings notably the Jesselton Revolt but they were eventually defeated by the Japanese. After the war, BNBC was unable to finance the high cost of reconstructions and the place was ceded to the British Crown Colony. The British Crown declared Jesselton as the new capital of North Borneo in 1946 and started to rebuild the town. After the formation of Malaysia, North Borneo was renamed as Sabah. In 1967, Jesselton was renamed as Kota Kinabalu, Kota being the Malay word for City and Kinabalu after the nearby Mount Kinabalu. Kota Kinabalu was granted city status in 2000.

Kota Kinabalu is often known as KK both in Malaysia and internationally. It is a major tourist destination and a gateway for travellers visiting Sabah and Borneo. Kinabalu Park is located about 90 kilometres from the city and there are many other tourist attractions in and around the city. Kota Kinabalu is also one of the major industrial and commercial centres of East Malaysia. These two factors combine to make Kota Kinabalu one of the fastest-growing cities in Malaysia.

==Etymology==

Kota Kinabalu is named after Mount Kinabalu, which is situated about 50 kilometres east-northeast of the city. &quot;Kinabalu&quot; is derived from the name &quot;Aki Nabalu&quot; meaning the &quot;revered place of the dead.&quot; &quot;Aki&quot; means &quot;ancestors&quot; or &quot;grandfather&quot;, and &quot;Nabalu&quot; is a name for the mountain in the Dusun language. There is also a source claiming that the term originated from &quot;Ki Nabalu&quot;, &quot;Ki&quot; meaning &quot;have&quot; or &quot;exist&quot;, and &quot;Nabalu&quot; meaning &quot;spirit of the dead&quot;.

The word &quot;kota&quot; comes from Malay word &quot;kota&quot; which in turn comes from the Sanskrit word कोट्ट (kota) which means fort, fortress, castle, fortified house, fortification, works, city, town, or place encircled by walls. It is also used formally in a few other Malaysian towns and cities, for example, Kota Bharu, Kota Tinggi, and Kota Kemuning. It can also be used informally to refer to any towns or cities. Hence, a direct translation of the name &quot;Kota Kinabalu&quot; into English would be &quot;City of Kinabalu&quot; or &quot;Kinabalu City&quot;.

===Original names===

Besides Jesselton, there are also other older names for Kota Kinabalu. The most popular is &quot;Api-Api&quot;, or simply &quot;Api&quot;, which is a Malay word meaning &#x27;Fire&#x27;. Wendy Law Suart wrote in her book on North Borneo, &quot;The Lingering Eye&quot;, &quot;there is in the Sabah State Museum a Dutch map of Borneo and the Celebes dated 1657 in which the settlement where Jesselton was to stand is clearly labelled Api Api. It may have some connection with the seaside tree with breathing roots that bears the same name&quot;. There are claims, however, that Kota Kinabalu was actually named after a nearby river called &quot;Sungai Api-Api&quot;. In Chinese, the city is still known as &#x27;Api&#x27;, which is the Hakka pronunciation for 亚庇 (Simplified Chinese; Traditional Chinese: 亞庇; Pinyin: &quot;yà bì&quot;).

Another suggested historical name is &quot;Deasoka&quot;, which roughly means &quot;below the coconut tree&quot; in the Bajau language. The Bajau locals purportedly used this name to refer to a village in the southern part of the city which was filled with coconut trees. Yet another name was &quot;Singgah Mata&quot; which literally means &quot;transit eye&quot;, but can be loosely translated as &quot;pleasing to the eye&quot;. It is a name said to have been given by fishermen from Gaya Island referring to the strip of land that is today&#x27;s downtown Kota Kinabalu. Today, all these names have been immortalised as names of streets or buildings around the city. Some examples are Lintasan Deasoka, Api-Api Centre and Singgah Mata Street.

==History==

Since the 15th century, the area of what is now Kota Kinabalu came under the influence of the Bruneian Empire. In the late 1800s, the British North Borneo Company (BNBC) began to establish colonial settlements throughout North Borneo. In 1882, BNBC founded a small settlement in the area known as Gaya Bay, which was already inhabited by the Bajau people. The first settlement was at Gaya Island. However, in 1897, the settlement was burned and destroyed by the indigenous Bajau-Suluk chief Mat Salleh.

After the destruction, BNBC decided to relocate the settlement to the more easily defended mainland at Gantian Bay (now Sepanggar Bay) in 1898. However, Gantian Bay was found to be unsuitable and in July 1899, Henry Walker, a Land Commissioner, identified a site opposite Gaya Island as a replacement for Gantian Bay. The replacement settlement site was a fishing village called &quot;Api-Api&quot; (see &quot;Original names&quot; above). The site was chosen due to its proximity to the North Borneo Railway and its natural port that provided good anchorage, which was up to 24 feet deep.


By the end of 1899, construction had started on shoplots, a pier and government buildings. This new administrative centre was renamed &quot;Jesselton&quot; after Sir Charles Jessel, who was the then Vice-Chairman of BNBC. Eventually, Jesselton became a major trading post of North Borneo, dealing in rubber, rattan, honey, and wax. The North Borneo Railway was used to transport goods to the Jesselton harbour. The Malay and Bajau uprisings during those times were not uncommon, and BNBC worked to quell the long-standing threat of piracy in the region. Jesselton was partially razed by the British during their retreat from the advancing Japanese and suffered further devastation when the Allies bombed it in 1945. After the Japanese takeover of Borneo, it was again renamed Api. Several rebellions against the Japanese military administration took place in Api. One major rebellion in the town occurred on 10 October 1943 by a group called Kinabalu Guerrillas in the Jesselton Revolt consisting of local inhabitants. Japanese forces quelled the rebellion after its leader, Albert Kwok, was arrested and executed in 1944. At the later stages of the war, what remained of the town was destroyed again by Allied bombings day and night for over six months as part of the Borneo Campaign in 1945, leaving only three buildings standing. The war in North Borneo ended with the official surrender of the Japanese 37th Army by Lieutenant General Baba Masao in Labuan on 10 September 1945.

After the war on the edge of bankruptcy, the British North Borneo Company returned to administer Jesselton but was unable to finance the huge costs of reconstruction. They gave control of North Borneo to the British Crown on 18 July 1946. The new colonial government elected to rebuild Jesselton as the capital of North Borneo instead of Sandakan, which had also been destroyed by the war. The Crown Colony administration designed a plan, later known as the &quot;Colonial Office Reconstruction and Development Plan for North Borneo: 1948–1955&quot;, to rebuild North Borneo. This plan provided £6,051,939 for the rebuilding of infrastructure in North Borneo. When the Crown Colony of North Borneo together with Sarawak, Singapore and the Federation of Malaya formed the Federation of Malaysia in 1963, it became known as Sabah, and Jesselton remained its capital. On 22 December 1967, the State Legislative Assembly under Chief Minister Mustapha Harun passed a bill renaming Jesselton as Kota Kinabalu. Kota Kinabalu town board was upgraded to municipal status in 1979. The city was upgraded to city status on 2 February 2000.

==Capital city==

Being the capital city of Sabah, Kota Kinabalu plays an important role in the political and economic welfare of the population of the entire state. It is the seat of the state government where almost all of their ministries and agencies are based. Most of the Malaysian federal government agencies and departments are also located in Kota Kinabalu. The Sabah State Legislative Assembly is located at the nearby Likas Bay. There are four members of parliament (MPs) representing the four parliamentary constituencies in the city: Sepanggar (&quot;P.171&quot;), Kota Kinabalu (&quot;P.172&quot;), Putatan (&quot;P.173&quot;), Tuaran (&quot;P.176&quot;) and Penampang (&quot;P.174&quot;). The city also elects 9 representatives to the state legislature from the state assembly districts of Karambunai, Inanam, Likas, Api-Api, Luyang, Tanjung Aru, Petagas, Kepayan, Segama, Menggatal, Tuaran, Lido, and Moyog.

===Local authority and city definition===
The city is administered by the Kota Kinabalu City Hall (Dewan Bandaraya Kota Kinabalu). The current mayor of Kota Kinabalu is Sabin Samitah, who became the latest mayor after taking over the post from Noorliza Awang Alip on 1 January 2024. Iliyas in turn became the second mayor of the city after taking over from Abdul Ghani Rashid in 2006. The city obtained city status on 2 February 2000, and prior to this it was administered by Majlis Perbandaran Kota Kinabalu (Kota Kinabalu Municipal Council/Kota Kinabalu Town Hall).
The city is defined within the borders of what is the district, formerly the municipality, of Kota Kinabalu. With an area of 351 square kilometres, it is the smallest but the most populous district in Sabah. It encompasses Tanjung Aru and Kepayan in the south, up to Telipok and Sepanggar in the north. The urban expanse of the city however extends into the district of Penampang on the south of the city border, which includes the towns of Donggongon and Putatan. The combined area of Kota Kinabalu District and the contiguous built up areas in Penampang and Putatan is known as Greater Kota Kinabalu. The district of Penampang has an area of 466 square kilometres, and is administered by Majlis Daerah Penampang (Penampang District Council).

On one end of the scale, Kota Kinabalu may sometimes only refer to, especially by local inhabitants, the city centre or central business district near the sea facing Gaya Island. On the other end of the scale, it may also refer to the metropolitan area which includes urban Kota Kinabalu (Greater Kota Kinabalu), and the surrounding towns of Papar and Kinarut in the south, and Tuaran and Tamparuli in the north, being within its zone of influence.

==Geography==
Kota Kinabalu is located on the west coast of Sabah. The city lies on a narrow flatland between the Crocker Range to the east and the South China Sea to the west. There are six islands off the coast of the city. The largest is Gaya Island, the site of the first British settlement. Approximately 8,000 people live there. The smaller islands, mainly uninhabited, are named Sapi Island, Manukan Island, Sulug Island, Mamutik Island and Sepanggar Island to the north. Sepanggar island is located north of the National Park opposite Sepanggar Bay.

Flat land is at a premium in the city centre, and there is a strict limit to the height of buildings: the airport is away, and the city is directly in the flight path. Most of the Central Business District (CBD) today is built on land reclaimed from the sea. The original local plant life has largely disappeared, but several hills within the city (too steep for building) are still clothed with tropical rainforest. One of these is Signal Hill, which confines the CBD to the shore. In the area of Likas Bay, the remnants of an extensive mangrove forest was nearly lost. In 1996, the state government declared of the forest as a protected area. This forest is now known as the Kota Kinabalu City Bird Sanctuary. The sanctuary was given additional protection as a State Cultural Heritage Site in 1998.
The five islands (of Gaya, Sapi, Manukan, Sulug, Mamutik) opposite the city, and their surrounding waters, are also preserved as the Tunku Abdul Rahman National Park. The park was named in honour of the first Prime Minister of Malaysia, Tunku Abdul Rahman. The park is a recreational spot for tourists and local people. The Kota Kinabalu city centre, consisting of mostly businesses and the government, includes Karamunsing, the port area (Tanjung Lipat), Signal Hill, Kampung Air, Sinsuran, Segama, Asia City, Gaya Street (Old Town), Bandaran Berjaya, Api-Api, Sutera Harbour and Sembulan. Outlying neighbourhoods and residential suburbs include Kepayan Ridge, Tanjung Aru, Petagas, Kepayan, Lido, Lintas, Nosoob, Bukit Padang, Luyang, Damai, Lok Kawi, Bukit Bendera, Kasigui, Bundusan, Likas and Kolombong. The city is growing steadily and the urban sprawl extends to the towns of Inanam, Menggatal, Sepanggar, Telipok and south of the district border to Penampang, Putatan, and Lok Kawi. Kota Kinabalu is generally isolated from the rest of the country; it is located about from Kuala Lumpur in Peninsular Malaysia and from Kuching in the neighbouring state of Sarawak.

===Climate===
Kota Kinabalu features a tropical monsoon climate (Am) with constant high temperatures, and a considerable amount of rain and high humidity throughout the course of the year. Two prevailing monsoons characterise the climate of this part of Sabah are the Northeast Monsoon and the Southwest Monsoon. The Northeast Monsoon occurs between November and March, while the Southwest Monsoon occurs between May and September. There are also two successive inter-monsoons from April to May and from September to October.

During the 1995–2004 period, Kota Kinabalu&#x27;s average temperature ranges from to . April and May are the hottest months, while January is the coolest one. The average annual rainfall is around 2,400 millimetres and varies markedly throughout the year. February and March are typically the driest months while rainfall peaks in the inter-monsoon period in October. The wind speed ranges from 5.5 to 7.9 m/s during the Northeast Monsoon but is significantly lower to 0.3 to 3.3 m/s during the Southwest Monsoon.

==Demography==
There have not been any official or popular adjectives, or demonyms, to describe the people of Kota Kinabalu. A simple way to describe the people of the city is &quot;orang KK&quot;, where &quot;orang&quot; means &quot;person&quot; or &quot;people&quot; in Malay. The terms &quot;K.K-ites&quot; and &quot;K.K-ians&quot; have also been used to a limited extent. People from Sabah are called Sabahans.

===Ethnicity and religion===
The following is based on Department of Statistics Malaysia 2010 census.
The Malaysian Census 2010 Report estimated the population of Kota Kinabalu at 452,058. The city&#x27;s population is a mixture of many different races and ethnicities. Non-Malaysian citizens form the largest group in the city with 110,556 people followed by Chinese (93,429), Bajau (72,931), Kadazan-Dusun (69,993), other Bumiputras (59,107), Malay (35,835), Murut (2,518), Indian (2,207) and others (5,482).

The Chinese are mostly Hakkas and reside mainly in the Luyang area as well as in Likas and Damai neighbourhoods with significant populations in other suburbs such as Manggatal, Inanam and Telipok. There is also a sizeable Cantonese-speaking population and smaller communities of Hokkien and Fuzhounese-speaking Chinese scattered throughout all areas of the city. Most of the Fuzhounese speakers in particular emigrated to Sabah from the neighbouring Malaysian state of Sarawak.

Kota Kinabalu is home to a diverse range of indigenous groups. The Kadazans, who predominantly come from Penampang and Papar, and the Dusuns, from the west coast and the interior of Sabah, are among the largest groups. The Bajaus, originally from Tuaran and Kota Belud, also have a significant presence in the city, along with other Bajau communities from various coastal regions of Sabah. The Malay population in Kota Kinabalu is primarily descended from Bruneian Malays, with smaller communities from the Malay Peninsula and Sarawak. Additionally, there are several other indigenous groups, including the Murut, Suluk, Sungai, Lun Bawang/Lundayeh, Bisaya, Illanun, Kedayan, Ida&#x27;an and Rungus, who have relocated to the city for socio-economic opportunities from different parts of the state.

Penampang district is populated mainly by Kadazans, while Bajaus and Dusuns mainly reside in Likas, Sembulan, Inanam, Menggatal, Sepanggar and Telipok. In Tuaran, both Dusun and Bajau communities are prominent, while Papar is largely inhabited by Kadazans and Bruneian Malays.

The Brunei Malays and Bajau are Muslims. The Kadazan-Dusuns, Muruts, Rungus and Lundayeh/Lun Bawang mainly practice Folk forms of Christianity, Islam, or Animism, while the Chinese are mainly Buddhists, Taoist or Christians. There are numerous Roman Catholic, Basel (Lutheran), Anglican, Evangelical, and Methodist churches throughout the city. A small number of Hindus, Sikhs, Animists, and secularists can also be found. The Census 2020 Report showed an increase to 500,421 inhabitants.

There is also a sizeable Filipino population in the city. The first wave of migrants arrived in the late 15th century during the Spanish colonisation, while a later wave arrived in the early 1970s, driven away from the Philippines by political and economic uncertainties there. Most of the earlier migrants have been naturalised as Malaysian citizens. However, there are still some Filipinos living in the city without proper documentation as illegal immigrants.

The majority of Filipino migrants in the city come from the southern Philippines and the Sulu Archipelago, with notable communities of Chavacano speakers and Bangsamoro background. Additionally, there is a significant population of Visayan origin, as well as smaller groups from northern Philippines.

In addition to Filipinos, the city is also home to sizeable residence of Indonesian descent. These groups, primarily of Bugis, Banjarese, Torajans and Javanese ancestry, have established visible presence in the city.
There is a small population of Indians, Pakistanis, Timorese and Eurasians scattered around the city. More recently, the number of expatriates living in the city, whether temporarily or permanently, have also increased. Most of them come from China, South Korea, Japan, Australia, Taiwan and Europe.

Interracial marriages across various ethnicities and nationalities are common. A notable example is the union between Chinese and indigenous groups such as the Kadazan, Dusun, Murut and Rungus, known as Sino-Native. The mixed-race descendants are commonly referred to as Sino, with the term adapted to reflect the specific ethnic backgrounds of the parents, such as Sino-Kadazan, Sino-Dusun and others.

===Languages===
The people of Kota Kinabalu mainly speak Malay, with a distinct Sabahan creole. However, as about 20% of Kota Kinabalu residents are of Chinese descent, Chinese is also widely spoken. Among the Chinese, the most commonly spoken varieties are Huiyang Hakka (Simplified Chinese: 惠阳客家话; Traditional Chinese: 惠陽客家話) and Mandarin. Additionally, most Chinese can speak Cantonese, although with widely varying levels of fluency. Almost all residents are also able to speak English, especially the younger generation. However, some find it difficult to speak fluently due to a limited vocabulary and the general lack of usage of the English language as a conversational lingua franca among Sabahans as a whole.

The number of Kadazan-Dusun speakers is thought to have dropped significantly throughout Sabah, especially in larger towns or cities like Kota Kinabalu. However, some effort has been taken by some to revive the usage of the language. Kadazan has been considered an endangered language, along with the culture of ethnic Kadazans.

==Economy==

Besides being the capital city, Kota Kinabalu is also the main industrial and commercial centre for Sabah. The economy is dominated by the primary sector of industry. Historically, the secondary sector dominated the economy, but due to rapid urbanisation and economic development, this sector of the economy is slowly diminishing. More recently, a move towards a more tertiary-based industry has become more apparent, especially with regards to the boom in the tourism industry. Many state-level, national-level and international commercial banks, as well as some insurance companies have their headquarters or branches here. The overseas Chinese population also contributes to the development of KK since their immigration in the late 19th century. Their original role was often a &#x27;coolie&#x27; (manual labourer) and today many Chinese work as shopowners.

A number of industrial and manufacturing companies also have plants here, especially in the industrial districts of Likas, Kolombong, and Inanam. The ongoing construction of the Kota Kinabalu Industrial Park (KKIP) in Sepanggar is intended to boost the city&#x27;s industrial and commercial activity, making it a major growth centre in East Malaysia, as well for the BIMP-EAGA (Brunei-Indonesia-Malaysia-Philippines East ASEAN Growth Area) region.

==Transportation==

===Land===
The internal roads linking different parts of the city are generally state roads constructed and maintained by the state&#x27;s Public Works Department. Most major internal roads are dual-carriageways. One of the major roads here is Lintas-Tuaran Bypass Road, which together serves almost as a ring road, circling the city and connecting the districts and suburbs surrounding the city, namely Putatan, Penampang, Luyang, Likas, Inanam, Menggatal, Sepanggar and Tuaran. There are currently no freeways in the city or in any other part of Sabah. The city is linked by highways to other towns in Sabah. These are mainly federal roads maintained by the national Public Works Department. Highway routes from Kota Kinabalu include:
* Kota Kinabalu – Tuaran – Tamparuli – Kota Belud – Kota Marudu – Pitas – Kudat
* Kota Kinabalu – Penampang – (Putatan – Lok Kawi) – Papar – Beaufort – Sindumin (part of the Pan Borneo Highway)
* Kota Kinabalu – Penampang – Tambunan – Keningau – Tenom – Nabawan - Kalabakan - Tawau (completing the Southern route in Sabah, part of the Pan Borneo Highway)
* Kota Kinabalu – Tuaran – Tamparuli – Kundasang – Ranau – Telupid – Sandakan – Tawau (AH150 route, Northern route part of the Pan Borneo Highway)


Regular bus services operate in the city. Aside from buses, minibuses or vans are used as an alternative mode of public transport. There are two main bus terminals in the city centre. The terminal along Tun Razak Road provide bus services to different parts of the city and its outskirts, while the KK Sentral terminal provides intercity services to destinations south of the city (Papar, Beaufort, Sipitang, Limbang etc.). A third bus terminal, the North Kota Kinabalu Bus Terminal in Inanam district, services intercity buses heading towards destinations north and north-east of the city (Ranau, Sandakan, Lahad Datu, Tawau, Semporna etc.). Taxis are available throughout the city.

A railway system formerly known as the North Borneo Railway was established in 1896 by the British North Borneo Company. It was built for the main purpose of transporting commodities from the Interior Division to the port in Jesselton (now Kota Kinabalu) during the period of British rule. The railway line connects Tanjung Aru in Kota Kinabalu to Tenom and several other towns in between, and it is the only railway system operating in East Malaysia. Today, the railway line is known as the Western Line and managed by the Sabah State Railway, providing daily services for commuters, travellers, as well as for cargo transportation. A separate company operates the leisure tour also called the &quot;North Borneo Railway&quot;, which caters mainly for tourists. This antique steam train service only running on Saturday and Wednesday mornings from Tanjung Aru station to Kinarut station before returning to the former station. In 2016, the Tanjung Aru railway station was moved to Aeropod with a new terminal and more public facilities.

===Air===

<text>Intermodal freight transport involves the transportation of freight in an intermodal container or vehicle, using multiple modes of transportation (e.g., rail, ship, aircraft, and truck), without any handling of the freight itself when changing modes. The method reduces cargo handling, and so improves security, reduces damage and loss, and allows freight to be transported faster. Reduced costs over road trucking is the key benefit for inter-continental use. This may be offset by reduced timings for road transport over shorter distances.

==Origins==

Intermodal transportation has its origin in 18th century England and predates the railways. Some of the earliest containers were those used for shipping coal on the Bridgewater Canal in England in the 1780s. Coal containers (called &quot;loose boxes&quot; or &quot;tubs&quot;) were soon deployed on the early canals and railways and were used for road/rail transfers (road at the time meaning horse-drawn vehicles).

Wooden coal containers were first used on the railways in the 1830s on the Liverpool and Manchester Railway. In 1841, Isambard Kingdom Brunel introduced iron containers to move coal from the vale of Neath to Swansea Docks. By the outbreak of the First World War the Great Eastern Railway was using wooden containers to trans-ship passenger luggage between trains and sailings via the port of Harwich.

The early 1900s saw the first adoption of covered containers, primarily for the movement of furniture and intermodal freight between road and rail. A lack of standards limited the value of this service and this in turn drove standardisation. In the U.S. such containers, known as &quot;lift vans&quot;, were in use from as early as 1911.

==Intermodal container==
===Early containers===

In the United Kingdom, containers were first standardised by the Railway Clearing House (RCH) in the 1920s, allowing both railway-owned and privately-owned vehicles to be carried on standard container flats. By modern standards these containers were small, being long, normally wooden and with a curved roof and insufficient strength for stacking. From 1928 the London, Midland &amp; Scottish Railway offered &quot;door to door&quot; intermodal road-rail services using these containers. This standard failed to become popular outside the United Kingdom.

Pallets made their first major appearance during World War II, when the United States military assembled freight on pallets, allowing fast transfer between warehouses, trucks, trains, ships, and aircraft. Because no freight handling was required, fewer personnel were needed and loading times were decreased.

Truck trailers were first carried by railway before World War II, an arrangement often called &quot;piggyback&quot;, by the small Class I railroad, the Chicago Great Western in 1936. The Canadian Pacific Railway was a pioneer in piggyback transport, becoming the first major North American railway to introduce the service in 1952. In the United Kingdom, the big four railway companies offered services using standard RCH containers that could be craned on and off the back of trucks. Moving companies such as Pickfords offered private services in the same way.

===Containerization===

In 1933 in Europe, under the auspices of the International Chamber of Commerce, The &quot;Bureau International des Containers et du Transport Intermodal&quot; (BIC; English: International Bureau for Containers and Intermodal Transport) was established. In June 1933, the BIC decided about obligatory parameters for container use in international traffic. Containers handled by means of lifting gear, such as cranes, overhead conveyors, etc. for traveling elevators (group I containers), constructed after July 1, 1933. Obligatory Regulations:
* Clause 1 — Containers are, as regards form, either of the closed or the open type, and, as regards capacity, either of the heavy or the light type.
* Clause 2 — The loading capacity of containers must be such that their total weight (load, plus tare) is: for containers of the heavy type; for containers of the light type; a tolerance of 5 percent excess on the total weight is allowable under the same conditions as for wagon loads.

In April 1935, BIC established a second standard for European containers:


In the 1950s, a new standardized steel Intermodal container based on specifications from the United States Department of Defense began to revolutionize freight transportation. The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) then issued standards based upon the U.S. Department of Defense standards between 1968 and 1970.

The White Pass &amp; Yukon Route railway acquired the world&#x27;s first container ship, the &quot;Clifford J. Rogers&quot;, built in 1955, and introduced containers to its railway in 1956. In the United Kingdom the modernisation plan, and in turn the Beeching Report, strongly pushed containerization. British Railways launched the Freightliner service carrying high pre-ISO containers. The older wooden containers and the pre-ISO containers were rapidly replaced by ISO standard containers, and later by containers and larger.

In the U.S., starting in the 1960s, the use of containers increased steadily. Rail intermodal traffic tripled between 1980 and 2002, according to the Association of American Railroads (AAR), from 3.1 million trailers and containers to 9.3 million. Large investments were made in intermodal freight projects. An example was the US$740 million Port of Oakland intermodal rail facility begun in the late 1980s.

Since 1984, a mechanism for intermodal shipping known as double-stack rail transport has become increasingly common. Rising to the rate of nearly 70% of the United States&#x27; intermodal shipments, it transports more than one million containers per year. The double-stack rail cars design significantly reduces damage in transit and provides greater cargo security by cradling the lower containers so their doors cannot be opened. A succession of large, new, domestic container sizes was introduced to increase shipping productivity. In Europe, the more restricted loading gauge has limited the adoption of double-stack cars. However, in 2007 the Betuweroute, a railway from Rotterdam to the German industrial heartland, was completed, which may accommodate double-stacked containers in the future. Other countries, like New Zealand, have numerous low tunnels and bridges that limit expansion for economic reasons.

Since electrification generally predated double-stacking, the overhead wiring was too low to accommodate it. However, India is building some freight-only corridors with the overhead wiring at above rail, which is high enough.

===Containers and container handling===

Containers, also known as intermodal containers or ISO containers because the dimensions have been defined by ISO, are the main type of equipment used in intermodal transport, particularly when one of the modes of transportation is by ship. Containers are wide by  or high. Since introduction, there have been moves to adopt other heights, such as . The most common lengths are , , , , although other lengths exist. The three common sizes are:
*one TEU – × 
*two TEU – × 
*highcube × .

In countries where the railway loading gauge is sufficient, truck trailers are often carried by rail. Variations exist, including open-topped versions covered by a fabric curtain are used to transport larger loads. A container called a &quot;tanktainer&quot;, with a tank inside a standard container frame, carries liquids. Refrigerated containers (reefer) are used for perishables. Swap body units have the same bottom corners as intermodal containers but are not strong enough to be stacked. They have folding legs under their frame and can be moved between trucks without using a crane.

Handling equipment can be designed with intermodality in mind, assisting with transferring containers between rail, road and sea. These can include:
*container gantry crane for transferring containers from seagoing vessels onto either trucks or rail wagons. A spreader beam moves in several directions allowing accurate positioning of the cargo. A container crane is mounted on rails moving parallel to the ship&#x27;s side, with a large boom spanning the distance between the ship&#x27;s cargo hold and the quay.
*Straddle carriers, and the larger rubber tyred gantry crane are able to straddle container stacks as well as rail and road vehicles, allowing for quick transfer of containers.
*Grappler lift, which is very similar to a straddle carrier except it grips the bottom of a container rather than the top.
*Reach stackers are fitted with lifting arms as well as spreader beams for lifting containers to truck or rail and can stack containers on top of each other.
*Sidelifters are a road-going truck or semi-trailer with cranes fitted at each end to hoist and transport containers in small yards or over longer distances.
*Forklift trucks in larger sizes are often used to load containers to/from truck and rail.
*Flatbed trucks with special chain assemblies such as QuickLoadz can pull containers onto or off of the bed using the corner castings.

===Load securing in intermodal containers===

According to the European Commission Transportation Department &quot;it has been estimated that up to 25% of accidents involving trucks can be attributable to inadequate cargo securing&quot;. Cargo that is improperly secured can cause severe accidents and lead to the loss of cargo, the loss of lives, the loss of vehicles, ships and airplane; not to mention the environmental hazards it can cause.
There are many different ways and materials available to stabilize and secure cargo in containers used in the various modes of transportation. Conventional Load Securing methods and materials such as steel banding and wood blocking &amp; bracing have been around for decades and are still widely used. In the last few years the use of several, relatively new and unknown Load Securing methods have become available through innovation and technological advancement including polyester strapping and -lashing, synthetic webbings and Dunnage Bags, also known as air bags.

==Transportation modes==

===Container ships===
Container ships are used to transport containers by sea. These vessels are custom-built to hold containers. Some vessels can hold thousands of containers. Their capacity is often measured in TEU or FEU. These initials stand for &quot;twenty-foot equivalent unit&quot;, and &quot;forty-foot equivalent unit&quot;, respectively. For example, a vessel that can hold 1,000 40-foot containers or 2,000 20-foot containers can be said to have a capacity of . After the year 2006, the largest container ships in regular operation are capable of carrying in excess of .

On board ships they are typically stacked up to seven units high.

A key consideration in the size of container ships is that larger ships exceed the capacity of important sea routes such as the Panama and Suez canals. The largest size of container ship able to traverse the Panama canal is referred to as Panamax, which is presently around . A third set of locks is planned as part of the Panama Canal expansion project to accommodate container ships up to in future, comparable to the present Suezmax.

Very large container ships also require specialized deep water terminals and handling facilities. The container fleet available, route constraints, and terminal capacity play a large role in shaping global container shipment logistics.

===Railways and intermodal terminals===


Increasingly, containers are shipped by rail in container well cars. These cars resemble flatcars but have a container-sized depression, or well, in the middle of the car between the bogies or trucks. Some container cars are built as an articulated &quot;unit&quot; of three or five permanently coupled cars, each having a single bogie rather than the two bogies normally found on freight cars.

Containers can be loaded on flatcars or in container well cars. In North America, Australia and Saudi Arabia, where vertical clearances are generally liberal, this depression is sufficient for two containers to be loaded in a &quot;double-stack&quot; arrangement. In Europe, height restrictions imposed by smaller structure gauges, and frequent overhead electrification, prevent double-stacking. Containers are therefore hauled one-high, either on standard flatcars or other railroad cars – but they must be carried in well wagons on lines built early in the Industrial Revolution, such as in the United Kingdom, where loading gauges are relatively small.

 narrow-gauge railways have smaller wagons that do not readily carry ISO containers, nor do the long and wide wagons of the gauge Kalka-Shimla Railway. Wider narrow gauge railways of e.g. and gauge can take ISO containers, provided that the loading gauge allows it.

It is also common in North America and Australia to transport semi-trailers on railway flatcars or spine cars, an arrangement called &quot;piggyback&quot; or TOFC &quot;(trailer on flatcar)&quot; to distinguish it from &quot;container on flatcar&quot; (COFC). Some flatcars are designed with collapsible trailer hitches so they can be used for trailer or container service. Such designs allow trailers to be rolled on from one end, though lifting trailers on and off flatcars by specialized loaders is more common. TOFC terminals typically have large areas for storing trailers pending loading or pickup.

Thievery has become a problem in North America. Sophisticated thieves learn how to interpret the codes on the outside of containers to ascertain which ones have easily disposable cargo. They break into isolated containers on long trains, or even board slowly moving trains to toss the items to accomplices on the ground.

=== Trucks ===

Trucking is frequently used to connect the &quot;linehaul&quot; ocean and rail segments of a global intermodal freight movement. This specialized trucking that runs between ocean ports, rail terminals, and inland shipping docks, is often called drayage, and is typically provided by dedicated drayage companies or by the railroads.
As an example, since many rail lines in the United States terminate in or around Chicago, Illinois, the area serves as a common relay point for containerized freight moving across the country. Many of the motor carriers call this type of drayage “crosstown loads” that originate at one rail road and terminate at another. For example, a container destined for the east coast from the west will arrive in Chicago either via the Union Pacific or BNSF Railway and have to be relayed to one of the eastern railroads, either CSX or Norfolk Southern.

===Barges===

Barges utilising ro-ro and container-stacking techniques transport freight on large inland waterways such as the Rhine/Danube in Europe and the Mississippi River in the U.S.

===Land bridges===
The term &quot;landbridge&quot; or &quot;land bridge&quot; is commonly used in the intermodal freight transport sector. When a containerized ocean freight shipment travels across a large body of land for a significant distance, that portion of the trip is referred to as the &quot;land bridge&quot; and the mode of transport used is rail transport. There are three applications for the term.
* &quot;Land bridge&quot; – An intermodal container shipped by ocean vessel crosses an entire body of land/country/continent before being reloaded on a cargo ship. For example, a container shipment from China to Germany is loaded onto a ship in China, unloads at a Los Angeles port, travels via rail transport to a New York/New Jersey port, and loads on a ship for Hamburg. Also see Eurasian Land Bridge.
* &quot;Mini land bridge&quot; – An intermodal container shipped by ocean vessel from country A to country B passes across a large portion of land in either country A or B. For example, a container shipment from China to New York is loaded onto a ship in China, unloads at a Los Angeles port and travels via rail transport to New York, the final destination.
* &quot;Micro land bridge&quot; – An intermodal container shipped by ocean vessel from country A to country B passes across a large portion of land to reach an interior inland destination. For example, a container shipment from China to Denver, Colorado, is loaded onto a ship in China, unloads at a Los Angeles port and travels via rail transport to Denver, the final destination.

The term &quot;reverse land bridge&quot; refers to a &quot;micro land bridge&quot; from an east coast port (as opposed to a west coast port in the previous examples) to an inland destination.

=== Planes and aircraft ===

Generally modern, bigger planes usually carry cargo in the containers. Sometimes even the checked luggage is first placed into containers, and then loaded onto the plane. Of course because of the requirement for the lowest weight possible (and very important, little difference in the viable mass point), and low space, specially designed containers made from lightweight material are often used. Due to price and size, this is rarely seen on the roads or in ports. However, large transport aircraft make it possible to even load standard container(s), or use standard sized containers made of much lighter materials like titanium or aluminium.

<text>Spetters (English translation: &quot;Splashes&quot;) is a Dutch film released in 1980 and directed by Paul Verhoeven. The film follows the lives of three young men who have little in common but their love for dirt-bike racing. Set on the outskirts of Rotterdam, the film depicts three characters who are hoping to escape a dead-end, working-class existence.

Each of the boys is seduced by a young woman who, with her brother, sells French fries and kroket at the races. She is looking for the person who will help her get out of the business and away from her brother. The motocross racers want to make their marks as professional racers, but their hopes don&#x27;t go according to their plans.

&quot;Spetters&quot; led to protests about how Verhoeven portrayed gays, Christians, the police, and the press. Although Verhoeven made one more film in the Netherlands, the response to &quot;Spetters&quot; led him to leave for Hollywood. Despite the large amount of controversy surrounding it, the film proved to be popular, with 1,124,162 admissions in the Netherlands alone.

The film was a small success in the United States, and it helped launch the Hollywood careers of Verhoeven and some of the actors, including Jeroen Krabbé, Rutger Hauer and Renee Soutendijk. The town of Maassluis was the setting for the movie.

==Plot==

Their hero is legendary motocross champion Gerrit Witkamp (Rutger Hauer), who inspires their competitive rides. Their lives are changed when they meet a young seductress named Fientje (Renée Soutendijk). Eventually, she makes the three men face the reality of success, defeat and homosexuality.

<doc id="361140" wikidata="Q534023" url="?curid=361140" title="Turducken">
<text>Turducken is a dish associated with Louisiana, consisting of a deboned chicken stuffed into a deboned duck, further stuffed into a deboned turkey. Outside North America it is known as a three-bird roast. Gooducken is an English variant, replacing turkey with goose.

The word &quot;turducken&quot; is a portmanteau combining &quot;turkey&quot;, &quot;duck&quot;, and &quot;chicken&quot;. The dish is a form of engastration, which is a recipe method in which one animal is stuffed inside the gastric passage of another—twofold in this instance.

The thoracic cavity of the chicken/game hen and the rest of the gaps are stuffed, sometimes with a highly seasoned breadcrumb mixture or sausage meat, although some versions have a different stuffing for each bird. The result is a fairly solid layered poultry dish, suitable for cooking by braising, roasting, grilling, or barbecuing.

The turducken was popularized in America by John Madden, who promoted the dish during NFL Thanksgiving Day games and, later, &quot;Monday Night Football&quot; broadcasts. On one occasion, the commentator sawed through a turducken with his bare hand, live in the booth, to demonstrate the turducken&#x27;s contents. Madden ate his first on-air turducken on December 1, 1996, during a game between the New Orleans Saints and St. Louis Rams at the Louisiana Superdome.

== Origin ==
Credit for the creation of the turducken is uncertain; other matryoshka-like stuffed dishes have existed for centuries, in a variety of cultures. One early version is found in the 1913 Spanish cookbook &quot;La Cocina Española Antigua&quot; by Emilia Pardo Bazan. On page 208, recipe 320 describes a dish called &quot;guisado particular&quot; which is made by first stuffing an olive, then a small bird with the olive, then that stuffed bird is stuffed into another larger bird and so on sixteen times more, then cooked in an open flame for 24 hours.

As a named dish, it is generally agreed to have been introduced by Cajun chef Paul Prudhomme. The earliest print reference to the dish is a 1982 &quot;Newsweek&quot; article that describes it as a new Prudhomme dish. A 1983 &quot;New York Daily News&quot; article called the turducken &quot;an example of his inventiveness.&quot; In the 1960s, Prudhomme had worked as a chef at a series of resorts in Colorado and Wyoming. In 1984, Prudhomme told the &quot;Star Tribune&quot; that he had come up with the turducken in 1963 while preparing turkey for a Sunday brunch at one such resort. He said he had started selling turduckens in New Orleans around 1982, raising the price repeatedly to lower demand because of the day-long cooking process required. Prudhomme trademarked &quot;Turducken&quot; in 1986. In 2003, the food writer Jeffrey Steingarten investigated the dish&#x27;s origin and concluded Prudhomme&#x27;s was &quot;the first, and therefore the authentic, recipe.&quot;

Another claimant is Hebert&#x27;s Specialty Meats in Maurice, Louisiana, whose owners Widley Hebert Jr. and Sammy Hebert say they created it in 1985 &quot;when a local man brought his own birds to their shop and asked the brothers to create the medley&quot;. But Prudhomme&#x27;s turducken had already been featured in media for several years before Hebert&#x27;s opened in 1984.

In the United Kingdom, a turducken is a type of ballotine called a &quot;three-bird roast&quot; or a &quot;royal roast&quot;. The Pure Meat Company offered a five-bird roast (a goose, a turkey, a chicken, a pheasant, and a pigeon, stuffed with sausage), described as a modern revival of the traditional Yorkshire Christmas pie, in 1989; and a three-bird roast (a duck stuffed with chicken stuffed with a pigeon, with sage and apple stuffing) in 1990.

&quot;Gooducken&quot; is a goose stuffed with a duck, which is in turn stuffed with a chicken.

==Historical predecessors==
In his 1807 &quot;Almanach des Gourmands&quot;, gastronomist Grimod de La Reynière presents his &quot;rôti sans pareil&quot; (&quot;roast without equal&quot;)—a bustard stuffed with a turkey, a goose, a pheasant, a chicken, a duck, a guinea fowl, a teal, a woodcock, a partridge, a plover, a lapwing, a quail, a thrush, a lark, an ortolan bunting and a garden warbler—although he states that, since similar roasts were produced by ancient Romans, the &quot;rôti sans pareil&quot; was not entirely novel. The final bird is very small but large enough to just hold an olive; it also suggests that, unlike modern multi-bird roasts, there was no stuffing or other packing placed in between the birds.

An early form of the recipe was &quot;Pandora&#x27;s cushion&quot;, a goose stuffed with a chicken stuffed with a quail.

Another version of the dish is credited to French diplomat and gourmand Charles Maurice de Talleyrand-Périgord. The 1891 newspaper article &quot;French Legends Of The Table&quot; offers &quot;Quail à la Talleyrand&quot;:

In Hunan cuisine, the famed chef Liu Sanhe from Changsha invented a dish called &quot;sanceng taoji&quot; (), meaning &quot;three-layer set chicken&quot;, consisting of a sparrow inside a pigeon inside a hen, along with medicinal herbs such as &quot;Gastrodia elata&quot; and wolfberries. He originally devised the dish to alleviate Lu Diping&#x27;s ill concubine of headaches.
The book &quot;Passion India: The Story of the Spanish Princess of Kapurthula&quot; (p. 295) features a section that recounts a similar dish in India in the late 1800s:

<doc id="361157" wikidata="Q176934" url="?curid=361157" title="Bio-inspired computing">
<text>Bio-inspired computing, short for biologically inspired computing, is a field of study which seeks to solve computer science problems using models of biology. It relates to connectionism, social behavior, and emergence. Within computer science, bio-inspired computing relates to artificial intelligence and machine learning. Bio-inspired computing is a major subset of natural computation.

== History ==
Early Ideas

The ideas behind biological computing trace back to 1936 and the first description of an abstract computer, which is now known as a Turing machine. Turing firstly described the abstract construct using a biological specimen. Turing imagined a mathematician that has three important attributes. He always has a pencil with an eraser, an unlimited number of papers and a working set of eyes. The eyes allow the mathematician to see and perceive any symbols written on the paper while the pencil allows him to write and erase any symbols that he wants. Lastly, the unlimited paper allows him to store anything he wants memory. Using these ideas he was able to describe an abstraction of the modern digital computer. However Turing mentioned that anything that can perform these functions can be considered such a machine and he even said that even electricity should not be required to describe digital computation and machine thinking in general.

Neural Networks

First described in 1943 by Warren McCulloch and Walter Pitts, neural networks are a prevalent example of biological systems inspiring the creation of computer algorithms. They first mathematically described that a system of simplistic neurons was able to produce simple logical operations such as logical conjunction, disjunction and negation. They further showed that a system of neural networks can be used to carry out any calculation that requires finite memory. Around 1970 the research around neural networks slowed down and many consider a 1969 book by Marvin Minsky and Seymour Papert as the main cause. Their book showed that neural network models were able only model systems that are based on Boolean functions that are true only after a certain threshold value. Such functions are also known as threshold functions. The book also showed that a large amount of systems cannot be represented as such meaning that a large amount of systems cannot be modeled by neural networks. Another book by James Rumelhart and David McClelland in 1986 brought neural networks back to the spotlight by demonstrating the linear back-propagation algorithm something that allowed the development of multi-layered neural networks that did not adhere to those limits.

Ant Colonies

Douglas Hofstadter in 1979 described an idea of a biological system capable of performing intelligent calculations even though the individuals comprising the system might not be intelligent. More specifically, he gave the example of an ant colony that can carry out intelligent tasks together but each individual ant cannot exhibiting something called &quot;emergent behavior.&quot; Azimi et al. in 2009 showed that what they described as the &quot;ant colony&quot; algorithm, a clustering algorithm that is able to output the number of clusters and produce highly competitive final clusters comparable to other traditional algorithms. Lastly Hölder and Wilson in 2009 concluded using historical data that ants have evolved to function as a single &quot;superogranism&quot; colony. A very important result since it suggested that group selection evolutionary algorithms coupled together with algorithms similar to the &quot;ant colony&quot; can be potentially used to develop more powerful algorithms.

== Areas of research ==

Some areas of study in biologically inspired computing, and their biological counterparts:
===Population Based Bio-Inspired Algorithms===
Bio-inpsired computing, which work on a population of possible solutions in the context of evolutionary algorithms or in the context of swarm intelligence algorithms, are subdivided into Population Based Bio-Inspired Algorithms (PBBIA). They include Evolutionary Algorithms, Particle Swarm Optimization, Ant colony optimization algorithms and Artificial bee colony algorithms.

==== Virtual Insect Example ====
Bio-inspired computing can be used to train a virtual insect. The insect is trained to navigate in an unknown terrain for finding food equipped with six simple rules:

* turn right for target-and-obstacle left; 
* turn left for target-and-obstacle right; 
* turn left for target-left-obstacle-right; 
* turn right for target-right-obstacle-left;
* turn left for target-left without obstacle;
* turn right for target-right without obstacle.
The virtual insect controlled by the trained spiking neural network can find food after training in any unknown terrain. After several generations of rule application it is usually the case that some forms of complex behaviour emerge. Complexity gets built upon complexity until the result is something markedly complex, and quite often completely counterintuitive from what the original rules would be expected to produce (see complex systems). For this reason, when modeling the neural network, it is necessary to accurately model an &quot;in vivo&quot; network, by live collection of &quot;noise&quot; coefficients that can be used to refine statistical inference and extrapolation as system complexity increases.

Natural evolution is a good analogy to this method–the rules of evolution (selection, recombination/reproduction, mutation and more recently transposition) are in principle simple rules, yet over millions of years have produced remarkably complex organisms. A similar technique is used in genetic algorithms.

=== Brain-inspired computing ===

Brain-inspired computing refers to computational models and methods that are mainly based on the mechanism of the brain, rather than completely imitating the brain. The goal is to enable the machine to realize various cognitive abilities and coordination mechanisms of human beings in a brain-inspired manner, and finally achieve or exceed Human intelligence level.

==== Research ====
Artificial intelligence researchers are now aware of the benefits of learning from the brain information processing mechanism. And the progress of brain science and neuroscience also provides the necessary basis for artificial intelligence to learn from the brain information processing mechanism. Brain and neuroscience researchers are also trying to apply the understanding of brain information processing to a wider range of science field. The development of the discipline benefits from the push of information technology and smart technology and in turn brain and neuroscience will also inspire the next generation of the transformation of information technology.

==== The influence of brain science on Brain-inspired computing ====
Advances in brain and neuroscience, especially with the help of new technologies and new equipment, support researchers to obtain multi-scale, multi-type biological evidence of the brain through different experimental methods, and are trying to reveal the structure of bio-intelligence from different aspects and functional basis. From the microscopic neurons, synaptic working mechanisms and their characteristics, to the mesoscopic network connection model, to the links in the macroscopic brain interval and their synergistic characteristics, the multi-scale structure and functional mechanisms of brains derived from these experimental and mechanistic studies will provide important inspiration for building a future brain-inspired computing model.

==== Brain-inspired chip ====
Broadly speaking, brain-inspired chip refers to a chip designed with reference to the structure of human brain neurons and the cognitive mode of human brain. Obviously, the &quot;neuromorphic chip&quot; is a brain-inspired chip that focuses on the design of the chip structure with reference to the human brain neuron model and its tissue structure, which represents a major direction of brain-inspired chip research. Along with the rise and development of “brain plans” in various countries, a large number of research results on neuromorphic chips have emerged, which have received extensive international attention and are well known to the academic community and the industry. For example, EU-backed SpiNNaker and BrainScaleS, Stanford&#x27;s Neurogrid, IBM&#x27;s TrueNorth, and Qualcomm&#x27;s Zeroth.

TrueNorth is a brain-inspired chip that IBM has been developing for nearly 10 years. The US DARPA program has been funding IBM to develop pulsed neural network chips for intelligent processing since 2008. In 2011, IBM first developed two cognitive silicon prototypes by simulating brain structures that could learn and process information like the brain. Each neuron of a brain-inspired chip is cross-connected with massive parallelism. In 2014, IBM released a second-generation brain-inspired chip called &quot;TrueNorth.&quot; Compared with the first generation brain-inspired chips, the performance of the TrueNorth chip has increased dramatically, and the number of neurons has increased from 256 to 1 million; the number of programmable synapses has increased from 262,144 to 256 million; Subsynaptic operation with a total power consumption of 70 mW and a power consumption of 20 mW per square centimeter. At the same time, TrueNorth handles a nuclear volume of only 1/15 of the first generation of brain chips. At present, IBM has developed a prototype of a neuron computer that uses 16 TrueNorth chips with real-time video processing capabilities. The super-high indicators and excellence of the TrueNorth chip have caused a great stir in the academic world at the beginning of its release.

In 2012, the Institute of Computing Technology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences(CAS) and the French Inria collaborated to develop the first chip in the world to support the deep neural network processor architecture chip &quot;Cambrian&quot;. The technology has won the best international conferences in the field of computer architecture, ASPLOS and MICRO, and its design method and performance have been recognized internationally. The chip can be used as an outstanding representative of the research direction of brain-inspired chips.

==== Unclear Brain mechanism cognition ====
The human brain is a product of evolution. Although its structure and information processing mechanism are constantly optimized, compromises in the evolution process are inevitable. The cranial nervous system is a multi-scale structure. There are still several important problems in the mechanism of information processing at each scale, such as the fine connection structure of neuron scales and the mechanism of brain-scale feedback. Therefore, even a comprehensive calculation of the number of neurons and synapses is only 1/1000 of the size of the human brain, and it is still very difficult to study at the current level of scientific research.
Recent advances in brain simulation linked individual variability in human cognitive processing speed and fluid intelligence to the balance of excitation and inhibition in structural brain networks, functional connectivity, winner-take-all decision-making and attractor working memory.

==== Unclear Brain-inspired computational models and algorithms ====
In the future research of cognitive brain computing model, it is necessary to model the brain information processing system based on multi-scale brain neural system data analysis results, construct a brain-inspired multi-scale neural network computing model, and simulate multi-modality of brain in multi-scale. Intelligent behavioral ability such as perception, self-learning and memory, and choice. Machine learning algorithms are not flexible and require high-quality sample data that is manually labeled on a large scale. Training models require a lot of computational overhead. Brain-inspired artificial intelligence still lacks advanced cognitive ability and inferential learning ability.

==== Constrained Computational architecture and capabilities ====
Most of the existing brain-inspired chips are still based on the research of von Neumann architecture, and most of the chip manufacturing materials are still using traditional semiconductor materials. The neural chip is only borrowing the most basic unit of brain information processing. The most basic computer system, such as storage and computational fusion, pulse discharge mechanism, the connection mechanism between neurons, etc., and the mechanism between different scale information processing units has not been integrated into the study of brain-inspired computing architecture. Now an important international trend is to develop neural computing components such as brain memristors, memory containers, and sensory sensors based on new materials such as nanometers, thus supporting the construction of more complex brain-inspired computing architectures. The development of brain-inspired computers and large-scale brain computing systems based on brain-inspired chip development also requires a corresponding software environment to support its wide application.

<text>James Edwin Gunn (July 12, 1923 – December 23, 2020) was an American science fiction writer, editor, scholar, and anthologist. His work as an editor of anthologies includes the six-volume &quot;Road to Science Fiction&quot; series. He won the Hugo Award for &quot;Best Related Work&quot; in 1983 and he won or was nominated for several other awards for his non-fiction works in the field of science fiction studies. The Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America made him its 24th Grand Master in 2007, and he was inducted by the Science Fiction and Fantasy Hall of Fame in 2015. His novel &quot;The Immortals&quot; was adapted into a 1970–71 TV series starring Christopher George.

Gunn was a professor emeritus of English and the founding director of the Center for the Study of Science Fiction, both at the University of Kansas.

==Early life, family and education==
Gunn was born in Kansas City, Missouri, on July 12, 1923 to Jesse and Elsie Mae (née Hutchison) Gunn. He came from a publishing family: his father was a printer, two uncles were pressmen, another uncle was a proofreader, and his grandfather was a newspaper editor. His grandfather, Benjamin Gunn, appeared in &quot;Ripley&#x27;s Believe it or Not.&quot; As a Masonic representative, he had visited every county in every state in the country and could name them all, including where he had spent the night.

Gunn served for three years in the U.S. Navy during World War II but never saw combat. With several months of Japanese language training and a few hours spent learning to fly an airplane, he was sent to Truk Island, now known as Chuuk Lagoon, to be adjutant to the commanding officer. He then attended the University of Kansas, earning a Bachelor of Science in Journalism in 1947 and a Masters of Arts in English from Northwestern University in 1951.

==Career==
By 1958, Gunn was managing editor of University of Kansas Alumni Publications. He became a faculty member of the university, where he served as the director of public relations and as a Professor of English, specializing in science fiction and fiction writing. He was a professor emeritus and founding director of the original Center for the Study of Science Fiction, which awarded the annual John W. Campbell Memorial Award for best novel and the Theodore Sturgeon Memorial Award for best short fiction.

He served as President of the Science Fiction Writers of America from 1971–72 and was President of the Science Fiction Research Association from 1980–82. SFWA honored him as a Grand Master of Science Fiction in 2007.

On June 12, 2015, Locus announced the selection of Gunn and four others for induction into the Science Fiction and Fantasy Hall of Fame, along with &quot;a &#x27;lightning-fast&#x27; fundraiser to cover [Gunn&#x27;s] travel expenses so he can attend the June 27, 2015 induction ceremony in Seattle&quot;.

===Writing===
Gunn became a professional writer in 1947 when he wrote a play produced by the University of Kansas, &quot;Thy Kingdom Come,&quot; then wrote newspaper articles and radio scripts. 
Although he considered moving to New York to become a playwright, he began his career as a science fiction writer in 1949, making his first short story sale to &quot;Thrilling Wonder Stories&quot;. He has had nearly 100 stories published in magazines and anthologies and has written 28 books and edited 10. Many of his stories and books have been reprinted around the world.

In 1948, Gunn wrote his first science fiction, ten short stories, and published nine from 1949 to 1952 as &quot;Edwin James&quot;, a pseudonym derived from his full name James Edwin Gunn. The first two in print, &quot;Communications&quot; and &quot;Paradox&quot; (the first sale), were published in September and October 1949 by editor Sam Merwin in &quot;Startling Stories&quot; and &quot;Thrilling Wonder Stories&quot; respectively. Gunn&#x27;s master&#x27;s thesis, a critical analysis of the genre, was also published in a professional magazine. His novels were first published by Gnome Press in 1955, &quot;Star Bridge&quot;, written by Gunn and Jack Williamson, and &quot;This Fortress World&quot;.

Scribner&#x27;s published Gunn&#x27;s novel &quot;The Listeners&quot; in 1972 and it was runner-up for the first annual John W. Campbell Memorial Award for Best Science Fiction Novel. Carl Sagan called it &quot;one of the very best fictional portrayals of contact with extraterrestrial intelligence ever written.&quot; According to the publisher of a 2004 edition, &quot;this book predicted and inspired the creation of the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI)—the organization dedicated to the search for extraterrestrial life.&quot;

In 1996, Gunn wrote a Star Trek novel that was a novelization of &quot;The Joy Machine&quot;, an unproduced episode of the first &quot;Star Trek&quot; series that was scripted by Theodore Sturgeon.

==Personal life and death==
Gunn married Jane Frances Anderson on February 6, 1947, at Danforth Chapel in Lawrence, Kansas. They had two sons, Christopher, born in 1949, and Kevin, born in 1954. Christopher died on St. Patrick&#x27;s Day, 2005. Jane died September 27, 2012. They were survived by Kevin.

Gunn died in Lawrence, Kansas, on the morning of December 23, 2020, at age 97 of natural causes after a brief hospitalization.

==Adaptations== 
His stories also have been adapted into radio plays and teleplays.

<text>In mathematics, restriction of scalars (also known as &quot;Weil restriction&quot;) is a functor which, for any finite extension of fields &quot;L/k&quot; and any algebraic variety &quot;X&quot; over &quot;L&quot;, produces another variety Res&quot;L&quot;/&quot;k&quot;&quot;X&quot;, defined over &quot;k&quot;. It is useful for reducing questions about varieties over large fields to questions about more complicated varieties over smaller fields.

== Definition ==

Let &quot;L/k&quot; be a finite extension of fields, and &quot;X&quot; a variety defined over &quot;L&quot;. The functor formula_1 from &quot;k&quot;-schemesop to sets is defined by

:formula_2

(In particular, the &quot;k&quot;-rational points of formula_3 are the &quot;L&quot;-rational points of &quot;X&quot;.) The variety that represents this functor is called the restriction of scalars, and is unique up to unique isomorphism if it exists.

From the standpoint of sheaves of sets, restriction of scalars is just a pushforward along the morphism formula_4 and is right adjoint to fiber product of schemes, so the above definition can be rephrased in much more generality. In particular, one can replace the extension of fields by any morphism of ringed topoi, and the hypotheses on &quot;X&quot; can be weakened to e.g. stacks. This comes at the cost of having less control over the behavior of the restriction of scalars.

=== Alternative definition ===
Let formula_5 be a morphism of schemes. For a formula_6-scheme formula_7, if the contravariant functor
:formula_8
is representable, then we call the corresponding formula_9-scheme, which we also denote with formula_10, the Weil restriction of formula_7 with respect to formula_12. 

Where formula_13 denotes the dual of the category of schemes over a fixed scheme formula_9.

== Properties ==

For any finite extension of fields, the restriction of scalars takes quasiprojective varieties to quasiprojective varieties. The dimension of the resulting variety is multiplied by the degree of the extension.

Under appropriate hypotheses (e.g., flat, proper, finitely presented), any morphism formula_15 of algebraic spaces yields a restriction of scalars functor that takes algebraic stacks to algebraic stacks, preserving properties such as Artin, Deligne-Mumford, and representability.

== Examples and applications ==
Simple examples are the following: 
# Let &quot;L&quot; be a finite extension of &quot;k&quot; of degree &quot;s&quot;. Then formula_16 and formula_17 is an &quot;s&quot;-dimensional affine space formula_18 over Spec &quot;k&quot;.
# If &quot;X&quot; is an affine &quot;L&quot;-variety, defined by formula_19we can write formula_3 as Spec formula_21, where formula_22 (formula_23) are new variables, and formula_24 (formula_25) are polynomials in formula_22 given by taking a &quot;k&quot;-basis formula_27 of &quot;L&quot; and setting formula_28 and formula_29.

If a scheme is a group scheme then any Weil restriction of it will be as well. This is frequently used in number theory, for instance: 
# The torus formula_30 where formula_31 denotes the multiplicative group, plays a significant role in Hodge theory, since the Tannakian category of real Hodge structures is equivalent to the category of representations of formula_32 The real points have a Lie group structure isomorphic to formula_33. See Mumford–Tate group.
# The Weil restriction formula_34 of a (commutative) group variety formula_35 is again a (commutative) group variety of dimension formula_36 if &quot;L&quot; is separable over &quot;k&quot;.
# Restriction of scalars on abelian varieties (e.g. elliptic curves) yields abelian varieties, if &quot;L&quot; is separable over &quot;k&quot;. James Milne used this to reduce the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture for abelian varieties over all number fields to the same conjecture over the rationals.
# In elliptic curve cryptography, the Weil descent attack uses the Weil restriction to transform a discrete logarithm problem on an elliptic curve over a finite extension field L/K, into a discrete log problem on the Jacobian variety of a hyperelliptic curve over the base field K, that is potentially easier to solve because of K&#x27;s smaller size.

== Weil restrictions vs. Greenberg transforms ==

Restriction of scalars is similar to the Greenberg transform, but does not generalize it, since the ring of Witt vectors on a commutative algebra &quot;A&quot; is not in general an &quot;A&quot;-algebra.
