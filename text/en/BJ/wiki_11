<text>The Warsaw Confederation, also called the Compact of Warsaw, was a political-legal act signed in Warsaw on 28 January 1573 by the first Convocation Sejm (&quot;Sejm konwokacyjny&quot;) held in the Polish Commonwealth. Convened and deliberating as a confederation between 6 and 29 January 1573, during the Commonwealth&#x27;s first interregnum period (1572–1574), it aimed to form a general confederation to prepare the election of a new king of Poland and ensure continuity during the interregnum. The confederation also pursued the goal of a religious tolerance edict, while ensuring the political equality of dissenters with Catholics. It was one of the first European acts to grant freedom of religion.

It was an important development in the history of Poland and Lithuania, extending religious tolerance to the nobility and free persons (burghers, the townspeople of royal cities) within the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. This event is considered the formal beginning of religious freedom in the Commonwealth. Although the confederation initially granted religious freedom primarily to the nobility, it was also embraced in practice by the townspeople of royal cities. This groundbreaking act marked a significant milestone not just for the Commonwealth but for the entire continent, as it was one of the first European acts granting broad religious freedoms.

The text of the &quot;Warsaw Confederation&quot; was originally written in multiple languages: the original in Classical Latin and Old Polish (mixed-language manuscript), with translations in Ruthenian, Early New High German, and Middle French (intended for Prince Henry of Valois who would be crowned King of Poland and Grand Duke of Lithuania). This multilingual approach ensured that the document could be understood by a diverse audience within the Commonwealth and beyond.

While the confederation could not prevent all religious conflicts and tensions within the state, it guaranteed religious tolerance, civil rights, and political equality to religious minorities, the so-called dissenters (&quot;dissidentes de religione&quot;), who did not follow the dominant Roman Catholic state religion. At the same time, it ensured internal peace and stability in the Commonwealth, especially during a time of great religious upheavals in 16th and 17th century Europe, which culminated in events such as the bloody Huguenot Wars and the devastating Thirty Years&#x27; War.

==Origin==
===History of religious tolerance in Poland===
Religious tolerance in Poland has a long tradition (e.g., Statute of Kalisz), and influenced by two significant documents issued by King Casimir III the Great. On 30 August 1356, the king approved customs, freedoms, and privileges in the realm of worship and administrative matters for the Monophysite Armenians. In a document from 1341, he guaranteed the followers of the Orthodox Church respect for their rites and customs. This stance by King Casimir made Poland the first multi-denominational state in Europe, where the royal court was Roman Catholic. However, tolerance for schismatics did not extend to heresies that arose within the Catholic Church. The Edict of Wieluń by King Władysław II Jagiełło in 1424 recognised Hussitism as a crime against the state. Nonetheless, in the same century, the Orthodox nobility enjoyed the same privileges as the Catholic nobility, as did the Armenians in Poland. Certain restrictions on the access of Orthodox Christians to the highest offices in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania were lifted by King Sigismund II of Poland in 1563 and 1568. In addition to the Orthodox and Armenians, Lipka Tatars, Ashkenazi Jews, and Crimean Karaites living in some cities and more numerous Lithuanian villages also enjoyed tolerance in Poland.

In opposition to the prevailing principles in Western Europe, a doctrine regarding the state&#x27;s relationship with pagans was formed in Poland in the 15th century, represented by Bishop Andrzej Łaskarz of Poznań and Paweł Włodkowic from the Kraków Academy (Jagiellonian University). In the early years of the Protestant Reformation, royal edicts against reformers were issued, but their implementation was far from perfect. King Sigismund I the Old himself recognised not only the secularisation of the Duchy of Prussia in 1525 but also, as the first ruler, recognised Lutheranism in Prussia as an official religion, guaranteeing tolerance for Catholics. Bishop Andrzej Krzycki, defending the Treaty of Kraków of 1525, referred to the fact that in Poland, alongside Catholics, Ruthenians, Armenians, Ashkenazi Jews, and Lipka Tatars had long lived together in harmony; in this community, there was also a place for Lutherans in the Duchy of Prussia.

Anabaptists, who arrived in Poland in 1535, and Mennonites, who appeared in Poland in 1526, also received tolerance. In the years 1557–1559, King Sigismund II Augustus guaranteed the cities of Prussia the freedom of the Augsburg Confession, and in the Treaty of Vilnius of 1561, Livonia received the same privilege, where the king guaranteed the nobility and townspeople freedom of the Lutheran Confession while simultaneously ensuring tolerance for Catholicism.

===Sandomierz Agreement to the Warsaw Confederation===

In 1570, representatives of Lutherans, Calvinists, and the Bohemain Brethren residing in the Commonwealth gathered in Sandomierz, where they reached an agreement to mutually recognize each other as Christian denominations and to jointly oppose the Catholic majority. They excluded the Arians (Polish Brethren) from their group, deeming them heretics. The dissenters presented a draft constitution (the Sandomierz Agreement) to the Sejm (parliament) in 1570, guaranteeing freedom of religion for all, so that &quot;everyone may believe according to their conscience&quot; on an equal footing with Roman Catholics and Orthodox Christians. However, this draft was not accepted at that time.

Meanwhile, on 7 July 1572, following the childless death of the last king, Sigismund II Augustus of the Jagiellonian dynasty, the Protestant camp, facing a new election for a new king, found itself without legal guarantees for their faith. The matter of choosing a new king was crucial for both sides, as in Europe, kings determined the religious character of their kingdom. Catholics rallied around Bishop Stanisław Karnkowski of Kuyavia. The Roman Catholic primate of Poland Jakub Uchański was a supporter of church reform, which brought him closer to the Protestants. The dissenters were led by Grand Marshal Jan Firlej and the Voivode of Sandomierz Piotr Zborowski. Fearing pressure from the numerous Mazovian nobility loyal to the Catholic Church, the Protestants decided that the election of the new king should take place in Bystrzyca near Lublin, hoping that the Protestant nobility of Lublin would influence the future election. The Catholics, on the other hand, aimed for the election to be held near Warsaw due to the numerous Catholic Mazovian nobility.

Religious tolerance in Poland had been &quot;de facto&quot; policy during the reign of King Sigismund II Augustus. However, the articles signed by the Confederation gave official sanction to earlier customs. In that sense, they may be considered either the beginning or the peak of Polish tolerance.

===Formation of the Warsaw Confederation===

The Convocation Sejm (parliament), acting as the Confederation Legislature, was composed of approximately 200 high-ranking nobles (the &quot;szlachta&quot;) from Poland and Lithuania. They gathered at Warsaw to prevent any separatists from acting and to maintain the existing legal order. To achieve this, the citizens had to unconditionally abide by the decisions made by the body, and the Confederation was a potent declaration that the two former states were still closely linked. At the Convocation Sejm (January 1573), it was decided that every nobleman (&quot;&quot;) from the Commonwealth could participate in electing a new king, although attendance was not obligatory. Warsaw was designated as the place of election. Another victory for the Catholics was the recognition of the Roman Catholic primate of Poland, Jakub Uchański, as interrex, who would henceforth convene assemblies, appoint, and crown the king. The Grand Marshal, who was then the Calvinist Jan Firlej, was granted the right to announce the election of the new king.

On 28 January 1573, the Confederation Legislature signed the &quot;Warsaw Confederation&quot; in which representatives of all the major religions pledged mutual support and tolerance. A new political system was arising, aided by the Confederation, the so-called nobles democracy, which contributed to the Commonwealth&#x27;s stability. Religious tolerance was an important factor in a multiethnic and multi-religious state, as the territories of the Commonwealth were inhabited by many generations of people from different ethnic backgrounds (Poles, Lithuanians, Ruthenians, Germans, Armenians, Italians, Lipka Tatars, and Ashkenazi Jews) and of different denominations (Roman Catholic, Protestant, Orthodox, Lutheran, Calvinist, Polish Brethren, Monophysite Armenians, Judaism, and even Muslim communities in Poland and in Lithuania). This kingdom became what Cardinal Stanislaus Hosius called &quot;a place of shelter for heretics&quot;. It was a place where the most radical religious sects, trying to escape persecution in other regions of the Christian world, sought refuge.

This act was not imposed by a government or as a consequence of war but rather resulted from the actions of members of Polish-Lithuanian society. It was also influenced by the 1572 French St. Bartholomew&#x27;s Day Massacre, which prompted the Polish-Lithuanian nobility to ensure that no monarch would ever be able to carry out such an act in Poland.

The people most involved in preparing the articles were Mikołaj Sienicki (leader of the &quot;execution movement&quot;), Jan Firlej, and Jan Zborowski. Together with his brothers, Jan Zborowski became the head of the Zborowskis party. Their efforts were opposed by many dignitaries of the Roman Catholic Church. Franciszek Krasiński was the only lone bishop who signed them (Szymon Starowolski claimed he did so under the &quot;threat of the sword&quot;), and the future legal acts containing the Articles of the Confederation were signed by Catholic bishops with the stipulation: &quot;excepto articulo confoederationis&quot; (except the article of the confederation). Another Catholic bishop, Wawrzyniec Goślicki, was excommunicated by the Holy See for acceding to the repeated acts of the Sejm of 1587.

In 1573, Zborowski participated in the Polish address to Paris, which aimed to bring Henry of Valois to the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. During the meeting of the envoy with the king-elect in the cathedral of Notre-Dame, he forced the Duke of Anjou, speaking loudly in his direction in the &quot;lingua franca&quot; of Classical Latin: &quot;Si non iurabis, non regnabis&quot; (&quot;If you do not swear, you will not reign&quot;). With these words, he addressed the future king of Poland and the Grand Duke of Lithuania, Henry of Valois, who did not want to guarantee the Commonwealth freedom of faith, conscience, and word. This provision was part of the Articles of 1573, ensuring the Polish and Lithuanian nobility these freedoms.

The legitimisation of the principles of tolerance was a significant achievement. The Articles of the Warsaw Confederation were the foundational document for the election, incorporated into the statutes that every newly elected king had to swear to uphold (the &quot;Henrician Articles&quot;), thus becoming constitutional provisions alongside the &quot;Pacta conventa&quot;, also instituted in 1573. Despite some generalities, the Warsaw Confederation provided a legal foundation for Polish Protestantism and was the first act of broad religious tolerance in Europe.

==Election and impact on Poland&#x27;s religious and political landscape==
The election of a new king in Poland was closely monitored by the Holy See in Rome with considerable interest and concern. This event held significant importance due to the ongoing threat of war with the Ottoman Empire and the further re-Catholicisation of Poland and other European states. Pope Gregory XIII, informed by Cardinal Hosius about the situation in Poland, ordered public prayers for the successful election of the Polish king and dispatched one of the best papal diplomats, Cardinal Giovanni Francesco Commendone, to Poland.

Among the candidates for the Polish throne were Protestants (Duke Albert of Prussia, King John III of Sweden), the Orthodox Tsar Ivan the Terrible, and Catholics (Archduke Ernest of Habsburg, Prince Henry of Valois from France). Henry of Valois was proposed as a candidate for the throne of the Commonwealth by Jean de Monluc, Bishop of Valence. Monluc assured the electors that Henry would marry Anna Jagiellon, the heiress of the Jagiellons and sister of King Sigismund II Augustus, to uphold the dynastic tradition. His candidature was also supported by Anna Jagiellon herself. Due to the potential war with the Ottoman Empire and the support of Catholic interests, the Pope instructed Cardinal Commendone to support the Habsburg candidacy, which he also communicated in a letter to the Polish bishops. This candidacy was opposed by both Protestants and the noble masses, who feared the loss of their Golden Liberty and war with the Ottoman Empire. It was said: &quot;What happens to others, that is to the Hungarians, Silesians, Bohemians, would happen to the Poles [...] Poles would no longer expect an election, as they [Habsburgs] would make us their heirs.&quot;

At the electoral Sejm in April 1573, two candidacies were proposed: Archduke Ernest of Habsburg and Prince Henry of Valois from France. On 11 May 1573, primate Uchański announced the nomination of King Henry of Valois, which the Protestants agreed to after some negotiations. The &quot;pacta conventa&quot;, which the new king had to swear to, included the provisions of the Warsaw Confederation at the request of the dissenters. The election of Prince Henry as King of Poland was received with joy in Rome, although it was unofficially said that the Ottoman Sultan Selim II contributed to this. On 11 May 1573, &quot;Prayer of Thanksgiving&quot; was held in Rome, celebrated by Cardinal Hosius in the presence of Pope Gregory XIII and 31 cardinals.

In February 1574, the young 22-year-old King Henry arrived in Poland, and in June, when news of the death of his brother King Charles IX of France reached Kraków, he escaped from Poland forever to return to France and claim the French throne. There were calls for his immediate dethronement. His departure left the throne of Poland vacant, leading to significant political turmoil and the need for a new election. After the king&#x27;s abrupt departure, signs of chaos were not lacking. In Kraków, on 12 October 1574, a crowd demolished the Calvinist church known as the brog, and the Sejm in Środa demanded the expulsion of the Jesuits from Poznań as agitators against the nobility.

The ten-year reign of King Stephen Báthory of Transylvania (1576–1586), along with his elected co-ruler and wife, Queen Anna Jagiellon of Poland, was of decisive importance for the religious future of Poland. The rebellious city of Gdańsk, unwilling to recognise him as King of Poland, not only submitted and paid a contribution but also had to rebuild the Cistercian abbey in Oliwa, which had been destroyed by a mob. Thanks to King Stephen&#x27;s initiative, the Polish Church adopted the Tridentine decrees at the Piotrków Synod (1577). In accordance with the wishes of Pope Gregory XIII, King Stephen significantly supported the Jesuits, who expanded their ecclesiastical activities during his reign. This included the Diocese of Wenden, endowed by the king, and the newly opened Vilnius Academy, entrusted to the Jesuits (1579). Even in his will, he admonished his nephew, Prince Sigismund Báthory, to defend the Catholic religion and the Jesuits against the Protestantised Hungarian estates.

After the victorious Livonian campaign of Stephen Báthory against the Tsardom of Moscow, when a ten-year truce was concluded in the Truce of Yam-Zapolsky in 1582 through the mediation of Jesuit Antonio Possevino, King Stephen, with the cooperation of Pope Sixtus V, organised an anti-Ottoman league, which was to include the kingdoms of Spain, Germany, Poland, Republic of Venice, and the Tsardom of Moscow. The league was also supported by the nobility. The death of the king on 12 December 1586 hindered the realisation of the league&#x27;s plans. Sixtus V, speaking at a public consistory on 7 January 1587, tearfully remarked on the king&#x27;s death: &quot;We had placed great hopes in him, we had already sent him financial aid for a certain undertaking [...], we consider his unexpected death as a punishment for our sins. In misfortune, however, we do not lose our heads, for we have the assurance that Christ will not abandon us.&quot; Although the king was a devout Catholic, he upheld religious tolerance. He did not allow anti-Protestant actions, adhered to the Warsaw Confederation, and upon hearing of actions against dissenters in Kraków, issued an ordinance against the perpetrators of the riots. In 1581, he sent a mandate to Vilnius, noting that he had sworn to uphold the confederation and wished to maintain it, &quot;leaving each person&#x27;s conscience in matters of faith to the judgment of God.&quot;

==Significance==
Late-16th-century Poland stood between the Orthodox Tsardom of Moscow in the East, the Muslim Ottoman Empire to the South, and Western Europe, torn between Protestant Reformation and Counter-Reformation, to the North and West. Its religious tolerance made it a welcome refuge for those escaping religious persecution elsewhere; in the words of Cardinal Hosius, it became &quot;a place of shelter for heretics&quot;. The confederation legalised the previously unwritten customs of religious tolerance.

The debate over whether religious freedom in historical contexts was intended solely for the nobility or also for burghers and peasants is a topic of discussion among historians. While there are differing opinions, many historians lean towards the interpretation that religious freedom was intended for all social classes, not just the nobility.

The Warsaw Confederation of 1573 was a groundbreaking document that established religious tolerance in the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. As historian Norman Davies noted, &quot;Certainly, the wording and substance of the declaration of the Confederation of Warsaw of 28 January 1573 were extraordinary with regards to prevailing conditions elsewhere in Europe; and they governed the principles of religious life in the Commonwealth for over two hundred years.&quot; This confederation was a significant achievement, ensuring that the principles of religious tolerance were upheld for generations.

In 2003, the text of the Warsaw Confederation was added to UNESCO&#x27;s Memory of the World Programme.

==Parchment wax seals==
Among the 209 suspended seal bowls on the parchment manuscript, as determined during the latest conservation work by Justyna Król-Próba from the Central Archives of Historical Records in Warsaw, there are 181 wax seals with the heraldic imprints of the signatories, 27 empty bowls (without imprints), and one fragment. These wax seals, belonging to each member of the legislature, hang in seven horizontal rows, with each row intended to hold 32 seals across 16 vertical string cords. This suggests, according to the researcher&#x27;s assumptions, that at the time of the manuscript&#x27;s creation, it could have had 224 suspended seals.

<doc id="358024" wikidata="Q2435166" url="?curid=358024" title="Timothy Dwight V">
<text>Timothy Dwight V (November 16, 1828 – May 26, 1916) was an American academic, educator, Congregational minister, and President of Yale University (1886–1898). During his years as the school&#x27;s president, Yale&#x27;s schools first organized as a university. His grandfather was Timothy Dwight IV, who served as President of Yale College ninety years before his grandson&#x27;s tenure.

==Biography==
Dwight was born in Norwich, Connecticut, the son of James Dwight. His paternal grandfather, Timothy Dwight IV, served as president of Yale College from 1795 to 1817. He was the great-grandson of Major Timothy Dwight and Mary (Edwards) Dwight, the latter&#x27;s father being the Rev. Jonathan Edwards, the third president of Princeton University. His mother was Susan, daughter of John McLaren Breed, by his second wife Rebecca (Walker) Breed, who was the daughter of Robert Walker, a judge of the Superior Court of Connecticut.

Timothy Dwight entered Yale in 1845, and during his undergraduate course received prizes in mathematics and Latin, and was a member of the Linonian Society, Phi Beta Kappa, and Skull and Bones. As the Clark Scholar, he spent the period from 1849 to 1851 in graduate work at Yale, in the fall of the latter year entering the Theological Department, where he studied for two years. He served as a tutor in the College from 1851 to 1855, and then went abroad to continue his studies at the universities of Bonn and Berlin.

==Career==
Returning to America in July 1858, he became professor of sacred literature at Yale at the opening of the next college year. His work in the Divinity School continued until 1886, when he was elected president of Yale College. Yale had begun to develop the departments of professional study—particularly of theology and medicine—at the beginning of the nineteenth century, during the administration of the elder President Dwight; and the institution, long a University in fact, became one in name at the inauguration of the younger Dwight. During the thirteen years of his presidency, from 1886 to 1899, the University began that rapid development in scope, in numbers of students and faculty, in material prosperity, and in national influence.

Dwight was licensed to preach May 22, 1855, and ordained to the ministry of the Congregational Church six years later. In 1869, Chicago Theological Seminary conferred the honorary degree of Doctor of Divinity upon him, and Yale honored him with a similar degree in 1886. He also received the degree of LLD from Harvard in 1886 and from Princeton in 1888. He was an associate member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and elected an honorary member of the Connecticut Society of the Cincinnati in 1895.

Dwight was a member of the American committee for the revision of the English version of the Bible, and for a number of years he was one of the editors of the &quot;New Englander&quot;. He had contributed extensively to various publications on theological and educational subjects. In 1886, he translated and edited, with additional notes, Frédéric Louis Godet&#x27;s &quot;Commentary on the Gospel of John&quot;, and he had also edited several of Meyer&#x27;s commentaries, including those on Romans, on several other Pauline Epistles, on Hebrews, and on the Epistles of James, Peter, John, and Jude.

He was the author of &quot;Thoughts of and for the Inner Life&quot; (1899), and in 1903 published &quot;Memories of Yale Life and Men&quot; &quot;Address Delivered at the Funeral of President Porter&quot; (1892) and a &quot;Commemorative Address&quot; in honor of W. D. Whitney and J. D. Dana (1895).

On April 19, 1889, he was a delegate to the organizational meeting of the National Society of the Sons of the American Revolution at Fraunces Tavern in New York City. He was elected as the first chaplain of the National Society.

Dwight played an important role in the founding and early growth of the Hotchkiss School, a college preparatory boarding school located in Lakeville, Connecticut. After Maria Bissell Hotchkiss received a large inheritance from her husband, Benjamin B. Hotchkiss, Dwight approached her with the idea that she &quot;finance a school that would prepare young men for college—for Yale, to be precise.&quot; Dwight was one of the incorporators and original trustees of Hotchkiss when the school was founded in 1891, and he continued to serve as a trustee for 25 years until his death in 1916, when the school&#x27;s board noted in a resolution that the institution &quot;in a large sense was the child of his creation... [and] that it was his wisdom that largely dominated its inception, creation, and upbuilding.&quot;

He served as Secretary of the Class of 1849 continuously from graduation until his death, which occurred, without warning, at his home in New Haven, May 26, 1916, as the result of infirmities incident to his advanced age. Burial was in Grove Street Cemetery in New Haven.

Dwight&#x27;s full-length portrait by Edmund C. Tarbell hangs in the stairwell of Woodbridge Hall, the Yale administration building.

==Family==
He was married in that city, December 31, 1866, to Jane Wakeman, daughter of Roger Sherman Skinner, who graduated from Yale in 1813, and Mary Lockwood (DeForest) Skinner. She survived him with their son, Winthrop Edwards (B.A. 1893, Ph.D. 1895, LL.B. 1896). Their daughter, Helen Rood, died October 16, 1909. John Breed Dwight, a graduate of Yale in 1840, and James McLaren Breed Dwight (B.A. 1846, LL.B. Columbia 1861) were his brothers. He was a cousin of Theodore Dwight Woolsey (B.A. 1820), who for 25 years was the president of Yale. In 1935, Yale constructed the ninth of its twelve residential colleges, Timothy Dwight College. It was named for Dwight and his grandfather, who were both regarded as particularly important presidents of Yale.

Jane Wakeman (Skinner) Dwight was the great-granddaughter of American founding father Roger Sherman.

<text>The City of Milton Keynes is a borough with city status, in Buckinghamshire, England. It is the northernmost district of the South East England Region. The borough abuts Bedfordshire, Northamptonshire and the remainder of Buckinghamshire. The borough is administered by Milton Keynes City Council, a unitary authority.

The principal built-up area in the borough is the Milton Keynes urban area, which accounts for about 20% of its area and 90% of its population. The borough also includes many rural areas surrounding the Milton Keynes urban area (especially to the north), containing several villages and the town of Olney. At the 2021 census, the population of the unitary authority area was just over 287,000.

==History==

The district was created on 1 April 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972, covering the whole area of four former districts and part of a fifth, which were all abolished at the same time:
*Bletchley Urban District
*Newport Pagnell Urban District
*Newport Pagnell Rural District
*Winslow Rural District (part within the designated New Town area only, rest went to Aylesbury Vale)
*Wolverton Urban District

The new district was named Milton Keynes (after its largest settlement). The district was given borough status from its creation, allowing the chair of the council to take the title of mayor.

As established in 1974, the borough of Milton Keynes was one of five non-metropolitan districts of Buckinghamshire, with Buckinghamshire County Council providing county-level services to the area. On 1 April 1997, Milton Keynes became a self-governing unitary authority by being redefined as its own non-metropolitan county, independent from Buckinghamshire County Council. Milton Keynes remains part of the ceremonial county of Buckinghamshire for the purposes of lieutenancy.

On 15 August 2022, letters patent were issued giving the borough the status of a city, allowing the council to change its name to Milton Keynes City Council.

==Local government==

Arising from the local government elections of May 2024, the borough is governed by a Labour administration. The Liberal Democrat party is the main opposition group.

In the 2024 Labour gained 4 seats to become the majority party, having previously been part of a joint Labour-Lib-Dem run administration. 
The borough is fully parished, with over 50 parishes.

==Economy==
According to data from the Office for National Statistics for 2017, the borough was the highest performing NUTS3 region in the UK outside inner London (which takes the first five places), on the basis of gross value added per head.

==Education==
Further education in the borough is provided by Milton Keynes College. For higher education, the Open University&#x27;s headquarters are in Milton Keynes though, as this is a distance education institution, the only students resident on campus are approximately 200 full-time postgraduates. A campus of the University of Bedfordshire located in Central Milton Keynes, provides conventional undergraduate courses.

Cranfield University is the academic partner in project with Milton Keynes City Council to establish a new university, code-named &quot;MK:U&quot;, 

on a reserved site in the city centre. , the project is stalled pending assurance of government funding.

<text>David Gerrold (born Jerrold David Friedman; January 24, 1944) is an American science fiction screenwriter and novelist. He wrote the script for the original &quot;Star Trek&quot; episode &quot;The Trouble with Tribbles&quot;, created the Sleestak race on the TV series &quot;Land of the Lost&quot;, and wrote the novelette &quot;The Martian Child&quot;, which won both Hugo and Nebula Awards, and was adapted into a 2007 film starring John Cusack.

== Early life ==
Gerrold was born to a Jewish family on January 24, 1944, in Chicago, Illinois. He attended Van Nuys High School and graduated from Ulysses S. Grant High School in its first graduating class, Los Angeles Valley College, and San Fernando Valley State College (now California State University, Northridge).

==Career==
=== &quot;Star Trek&quot; ===
==== &quot;Star Trek: The Original Series&quot; ====

Within days of seeing the &quot;Star Trek&quot; series premiere &quot;The Man Trap&quot; on September 8, 1966, 22-year-old Gerrold wrote a 60-page outline for a two-part episode called &quot;Tomorrow Was Yesterday&quot; about the &quot;Enterprise&quot; discovering a ship launched from Earth centuries earlier. Although &quot;Star Trek&quot; producer Gene L. Coon rejected the outline, he realized Gerrold was talented and expressed interest in his submitting some story premises. Bearing preliminary titles and, in some cases, preliminary character names, Gerrold submitted five premises.

Two of the submissions of which he later had little recollection involved a spaceship-destroying machine, similar to Norman Spinrad&#x27;s &quot;The Doomsday Machine&quot;, and a situation in which Kirk had to play a chess game with an advanced intelligence using his crew as chess pieces. A third premise, &quot;Bandi&quot;, involved a small being running about the &quot;Enterprise&quot; as someone&#x27;s pet, and which empathically sways the crew&#x27;s feelings and emotions to comfort it, even at someone else&#x27;s expense.

A fourth premise, &quot;The Protracted Man&quot;, applied science fiction to an effect seen in &quot;West Side Story&quot;, when Maria twirls in her dancing dress and the colours separate. Gerrold&#x27;s story involved a man transported from a shuttlecraft trying out a new space warp technology. The man is no longer unified, separating into three visible forms when he moves, separated by a fraction of a second. As efforts are undertaken to correct the condition and move the &quot;Enterprise&quot; to where corrective action can be taken, the protraction worsens.

The fifth premise, &quot;The Fuzzies&quot;, was also initially rejected by Coon, but a while later he changed his mind and called Gerrold&#x27;s agent to accept it. Gerrold then expanded the story to a full television story outline entitled &quot;A Fuzzy Thing Happened to Me...&quot;, and it eventually became &quot;The Trouble with Tribbles&quot;. The name &quot;Fuzzy&quot; was changed because H. Beam Piper had written novels about a fictional alien species of the same name (see &quot;Little Fuzzy&quot;). The script went through numerous rewrites, including, at the insistence of Gerrold&#x27;s agent, being re-set in a stock frontier town instead of an &quot;expensive&quot; space station. Gerrold later wrote a book, &quot;The Trouble with Tribbles&quot;, telling the story of producing the episode and his earlier premises.

&quot;The Cloud Minders&quot; from the third season has a story credited to Gerrold and Oliver Crawford.

I came in with what I thought was a near-perfect Star Trek story, which is we find a culture that isn&#x27;t working for everybody and fix it. But my original ending was that, as they&#x27;re flying off, Kirk says, &quot;Well, we solved another one.&quot; Spock says, &quot;Well, actually, it&#x27;ll take years and years and years for all of these changes to be put in place.&quot; And McCoy says, &quot;I wonder how many children are going to die in the meantime.&quot; So the idea was, &quot;Let&#x27;s get gritty. We&#x27;re not going to change things overnight, but we can put changes in place that will have long-term effects.&quot; There was also more to the story that was about the social issue, and there was no magical zenite gas that was causing the problem. Freddy Freiberger and Margaret Armen came in and changed it to a &quot;Let&#x27;s solve it all in the last five minutes with gas masks&quot; (ending). And I thought, &quot;That&#x27;s really not a very good story. It doesn&#x27;t do what Gene Roddenberry or Gene L. Coon would have been willing to do.&quot; So I was disappointed.

&quot;The Trouble with Tribbles&quot; was one of two books Gerrold wrote about &quot;Star Trek&quot; in the early 1970s after the original series had been canceled. His other was an analysis of the series, entitled &quot;The World of Star Trek&quot;, in which he criticized some of the elements of the show, particularly Kirk&#x27;s habit of placing himself in dangerous situations and leading landing parties himself.

====&quot;Star Trek: The Animated Series&quot;====

Gerrold contributed two stories for the Emmy Award-winning &quot;Star Trek: The Animated Series&quot; which ran from 1973 to 1974: &quot;More Tribbles, More Troubles&quot; and &quot;Bem&quot;. &quot;Bem&quot; featured the first use of James T. Kirk&#x27;s middle name, which was revealed to be Tiberius. This was later entered into live-action canon in the movie &quot;Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country&quot; when Captain Kirk and Doctor McCoy are on trial for the death of the Klingon Chancellor Gorkon.

====&quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot;====

Many of the changes Gerrold had advocated in &quot;The World of Star Trek&quot; were incorporated into &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot; when it debuted in 1987. He parted company with the producers at the beginning of the first season.

Gerrold wrote a script for &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot; entitled &quot;Blood and Fire&quot;, which included an AIDS metaphor and a gay couple in the ship&#x27;s crew. Gerrold wrote this script in response to being with Roddenberry at a convention in 1987 where he had promised that the upcoming &quot;Next Generation&quot; series would deal with the issue of sexual orientation in the egalitarian future. The script was purchased by the TNG producers, but eventually shelved. He later reworked the story into the third book in the &quot;Star Wolf&quot; series (see below) and again as a two-part episode of the fan-produced &quot;Star Trek: New Voyages&quot;, which he also directed.

====Other &quot;Trek&quot; involvement====
Gerrold had wanted to appear onscreen in an episode of &quot;Star Trek&quot;, particularly &quot;The Trouble with Tribbles&quot;. The character of Ensign Freeman, who appears in the bar scene with the Klingons, was originally intended by Gerrold to be a walk-on part for himself, however another actor took the role since Gerrold was deemed too thin at the time. He also had an in-joke cameo of sorts in &quot;Star Trek The Animated Series&quot;: &quot;More Tribbles, More Troubles&quot; where a very thin Ensign is told to seal off the transporter room area by Kirk. Gerrold also provided the voice for alien Em/3/Green in &quot;The Jihad&quot;. While Gerrold appeared as a crewman extra with other Trek fandom notables in &quot;Star Trek: The Motion Picture&quot;, he did not appear in a Trek series until &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&quot;, when he played a security guard in &quot;Trials and Tribble-ations&quot;, set during the timeframe of his original episode.

Gerrold wrote a novelization of the &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot; series premiere &quot;Encounter at Farpoint&quot;, published in 1987, and an original &quot;Star Trek&quot; novel titled &quot;The Galactic Whirlpool&quot;, published in 1980, which was based on his story outline &quot;Tomorrow Was Yesterday&quot;. In 2006, for the 40th anniversary of &quot;Star Trek,&quot; he co-edited, with Robert J. Sawyer, an essay collection titled &quot;Boarding the &quot;Enterprise&quot;&quot;.

Gerrold acted as a series consultant for fan-produced series &quot;Star Trek: New Voyages&quot; and &quot;Star Trek: Phase II&quot; starting in 2006. In June 2013 he was named showrunner of the series.

===Early science fiction novels===
His science fiction novels include &quot;The Man Who Folded Himself&quot; (1973), about a man who inherits a time-travel belt, and &quot;When HARLIE Was One&quot; (1972), the story of an artificial intelligence&#x27;s relationship with his creators. &quot;When HARLIE Was One&quot; was nominated for best novel for both the Hugo Award and the Nebula Award. This novel is notable for being one of the first to describe a computer virus. A revised edition, entitled &quot;When HARLIE Was One, Release 2.0&quot;, was published in 1988, incorporating new insights and reflecting new developments in computer science.

=== &quot;The War Against the Chtorr&quot; ===
Gerrold is the author of the &quot;War Against the Chtorr&quot; series of books, about an invasion of Earth by mysterious aliens: &quot;A Matter for Men&quot; (1983), &quot;A Day for Damnation&quot; (1985), &quot;A Rage for Revenge&quot; (1989), and &quot;A Season for Slaughter&quot; (1993). He eventually announced that what was initially supposed to be a trilogy would in fact require seven books. In approximately 2010 Gerrold was reputed to have a considerable amount of work completed on the remainder of the series, and the fifth book, &quot;A Method for Madness&quot;, was listed on Amazon with a publication date. The publication date has been updated several times since; the last was January 1, 2014. At that time the remaining books in the series were tentatively titled &quot;A Method For Madness&quot;, &quot;A Time For Treason&quot;, and &quot;A Case For Courage&quot;. In 2017, he announced that the fifth book, now tentatively titled &quot;A Nest for Nightmares&quot;, and the sixth book, &quot;A Method For Madness&quot;, are nearing completion, over two decades after the last book came out. Whether a seventh Chtorr book is still planned, or what its title will be if it is, are unknown. Gerrold is considering crowdfunding and other ways to raise money to fund completion of organization of the material and final writing for the two books.

The alien invasion is an ecological one. Instead of Earthlings terraforming another planet, the aliens are &quot;Chtorraforming&quot; Earth. Instead of armies, the unseen aggressors gradually unleash plants and animals from their older, more evolved planet (which is indicated as being perhaps a half billion years older than Earth, and evolved into a higher effective competitiveness). These outcompete and displace their terrestrial counterparts and Earth becomes more and more Chtorr-like as the &quot;war&quot; progresses.

Portions of the remaining books have made it into print, however. Gerrold released to fans a cliffhanger teaser chapter from &quot;Method for Madness&quot;. In his collection &quot;The Involuntary Human&quot; (), he included &quot;It Needs Salt&quot; (as a portion of the planned but not formally scheduled &quot;Time for Treason&quot;). Finally, he also published the story &quot;Enterprise Fish&quot; in a volume of &quot;Thrilling Wonder Stories&quot;, (; edited by Winston Engle). &quot;Enterprise Fish&quot; is described as an excerpt from &quot;Time for Treason&quot;. The Chtorr series and its central character have moved through stages of development with each book in the series, with another layer of the Chtorran ecology explained and understanding of it unveiled with each successive book. Since &quot;It Needs Salt&quot; and &quot;Enterprise Fish&quot; are short stories from planned future layers of plot and character development, fans of the series are forewarned that they contain &quot;spoilers&quot;.

=== &quot;Star Wolf&quot; ===

Gerrold is also the author of the &quot;Star Wolf&quot; series of books, centered on the star ship &quot;Star Wolf&quot; and its crew: &quot;Voyage of the Star Wolf&quot; (1990), &quot;The Middle of Nowhere&quot; (1995), &quot;Blood and Fire&quot; (2004), and &quot;Yesterday&#x27;s Children&quot; (1972) which is actually an earlier novel that features the same main character, later significantly expanded and republished as &quot;Starhunt&quot; (1985)—it occurs prior to the other novels in the series&#x27; main continuity. The initial germ of &quot;Yesterday&#x27;s Children&quot; was the &quot;framing&quot; story in his early &quot;Star Trek&quot; proposal &quot;Tomorrow Was Yesterday&quot;, much altered over time. Gerrold had planned to develop this concept into a TV series, as he writes in an introduction to &quot;Voyage of the Star Wolf&quot;. The &quot;Star Wolf&quot; series reflects Gerrold&#x27;s contention that, due to the distances involved, space battles would be more like submarine hunts than the dogfights usually portrayed—in most cases the ships doing battle would not even be able to see each other.

=== Other works ===
After his early success with &quot;The Trouble with Tribbles&quot; Gerrold continued writing television scripts (mostly for science fiction series such as &quot;Land of the Lost&quot;, &quot;Babylon 5&quot;, &quot;Sliders&quot;, and &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot;). He has also made several uncredited appearances on the TV series &quot;The Big Bang Theory.&quot;

In 1999, he contributed a short piece to &quot;Smart Reseller&quot; magazine predicting that cell phones could evolve into devices he called &quot;Personal Information Telecommunications Agent&quot;, and described a feature set very similar to modern smartphones:

Gerrold wrote the non-fiction book &quot;Worlds of Wonder: How to Write Science Fiction &amp; Fantasy&quot;, published in 2001.

&quot;The Martian Child&quot; is a semi-autobiographical novel, expanded from a novelette of the same name, based on the author&#x27;s own experiences as a single adoptive father, with most of the key moments drawn from actual events. The novelette won both the Hugo and Nebula awards, and a movie version was released in November 2007, with John Cusack playing the adoptive father. There is some controversy surrounding this character, as David Gerrold and his character in the novel are both gay, but in the movie he is a straight widower.

In 2000, his long-time admiration of the works of Robert A. Heinlein led him to create a new series, called &quot;The Dingilliad&quot;. It follows a resourceful teenager and his family as they try to begin a new life. Although not necessarily canon, there are hints that it ties into the &quot;War Against the Chtorr&quot; universe, with everything from the plagues to the rumored appearance of a giant purple worm (similar cross-universe tie-ins occur in Gerrold&#x27;s Trackers books). The Dingilliad trilogy consists of &quot;Jumping Off the Planet&quot; (2000), &quot;Bouncing Off the Moon&quot; (2001), and &quot;Leaping to the Stars&quot; (2002). &quot;Jumping Off the Planet&quot; received the 2002 Hal Clement (Young Adult Award) for Excellence in Children&#x27;s Science Fiction Literature.

In 2005, Gerrold was awarded the Telluride Tech Festival Award of Technology in Telluride, Colorado.

In 2013, Gerrold wrote a &quot;Starcraft 2&quot; short story titled &quot;In the Dark&quot; for Blizzard Entertainment&#x27;s series of &quot;Starcraft&quot; short stories.

As of 2015, he is also a member of the board of directors for the Hollywood Science Fiction Museum.

Gerrold continues to write and publish online on Patreon and other mediums. He is also a proponent of personal development programs such as Lifespring and Landmark, among others. See his post on Patreon, &quot;Why I Believe in Personal Development Courses.&quot;

Gerrold was the winner of the Robert A. Heinlein Award for 2022.

<text>The Borough of Swindon is a unitary authority area with borough status in Wiltshire, England. Centred on Swindon, it is the most north-easterly district of South West England.

== History ==

The first borough of Swindon was a municipal borough, created in 1900 as a merger of the two urban districts of Old Swindon and New Swindon.

In 1974 the borough of Thamesdown was created under the Local Government Act 1972. Thamesdown covered the areas of the municipal borough of Swindon and the neighbouring Highworth Rural District (which had been created in 1894), which were both abolished at the same time. Thamesdown was a lower-tier non-metropolitan district, with Wiltshire County Council being the higher-tier authority for the area. Thamesdown was given borough status from its creation, allowing the chair of the council to take the title of mayor.

On 1 April 1997 Thamesdown was made a unitary authority, making it administratively independent from Wiltshire County Council. In June 1996, during the transition period to becoming a unitary authority, the council passed an order that the area would be renamed Swindon with effect from 1 April 1997 as well. The former Thamesdown name and logo continued to be used by the municipal bus operator, Thamesdown Transport, until 2017 when it was sold and renamed to &quot;Swindon&#x27;s Bus Company&quot;. Swindon remains part of the ceremonial county of Wiltshire for the purposes of lieutenancy.

==Geography==
The borough of Swindon occupies an area forming the north east corner of Wiltshire and is bordered by two other counties, Gloucestershire (to the north) and Oxfordshire (to the east). West Berkshire is also only a short distance from the borough&#x27;s south eastern tip.
The generally hilly landscape is sculpted by the upper Thames guiding the northern border, small tributaries draining into the Thames, and the Marlborough Downs rising toward the south.
The borough encompasses the Swindon urban area and surrounding countryside to the north, east and south, including the town of Highworth. It comprises the former Swindon Municipal Borough and a further 18 civil parishes:

* Bishopstone (with Hinton Parva)
* Blunsdon
* Castle Eaton
* Chiseldon
* Covingham
* Hannington
* Haydon Wick
* Highworth (town and surrounding district, including Sevenhampton)
* Inglesham
* Liddington
* Nythe, Eldene and Liden
* St Andrews 
* South Marston
* Stanton Fitzwarren
* Stratton St Margaret
* Wanborough
* West Swindon
* Wroughton

Since 1 April 2017 the entire Borough has been parished, following the establishment of West Swindon parish and the creation of Central Swindon North and Central Swindon South (styled by its parish council as South Swindon). The two Central parishes fall within the boundaries of the town and former municipal borough, divided along the Great Western Main Line railway.

At the same time:

* the part of Chiseldon parish north of the M4, including the former hamlet of Coate, was transferred to Central Swindon South;
* the parish of Blunsdon St Andrew was divided into St Andrews and Blunsdon, the A419 forming the boundary between them;
* the parish of Nythe was expanded to form Nythe, Eldene and Liden.

==Swindon Borough Council==

The council follows a leader and cabinet model and has 57 members elected by 20 wards. Elections are held in three out of every four years, with one-third of the seats being elected at each election. From the first election in 1996 to the 2000 election, Labour had a majority on the council. Following a period where no party had a majority, the Conservatives gained a majority at the 2003 election and had control until the 2023 election, when Labour took control. 

=== Wards ===

=== Other elections ===
The borough is divided into three Parliamentary constituencies. Swindon North and Swindon South are wholly within the boundaries of the borough of Swindon, while East Wiltshire includes the Swindon borough council wards of Wroughton &amp; Wichelstowe and Ridgeway, and the parish of Chiseldon. Swindon North and Swindon South are seen as key marginal seats at general elections, having been bellwether seats since 1997 when their predecessor constituencies were created; currently both seats are held by the Labour Party. East Wiltshire is currently held by the Conservative Party.

The borough was one of the first areas to declare in the 2016 European Union membership referendum. 61,745 (54.3%) voters supported leaving the European Union, whilst 51,220 (45.7%) wished to remain.

<text>The Polish Brethren (Polish: &quot;Bracia Polscy&quot;) were members of the Minor Reformed Church of Poland, a nontrinitarian Protestant church that existed in Poland from 1565 to 1658. By those on the outside, they were called &quot;Arians&quot; or &quot;Socinians&quot; (, &quot;&quot;), but themselves preferred simply to be called &quot;Brethren&quot; or &quot;Christians&quot; (and, after their expulsion from Poland, &quot;Unitarians&quot;).

== History ==
The &quot;Ecclesia Minor&quot; or &quot;Minor Reformed Church of Poland&quot;, better known today as the Polish Brethren, was started on January 22, 1556, when Piotr of Goniądz (Peter Gonesius), a Polish student, spoke out against the doctrine of the Trinity during the general synod of the Reformed (Calvinist) churches of Poland held in the village of Secemin.

===1565: Split with the Calvinists===
A theological debate called by the Polish king Sigismund II Augustus himself in 1565 did not succeed in bringing both Protestant factions together again. Finally, the faction that had supported Piotr of Goniądz&#x27;s arguments broke all ties with the Calvinists and organised its own synod in the town of Brzeziny on June 10, 1565.

In the 1570s a split was developing between the pacifist and Arian group, led by Marcin Czechowic and Grzegorz Paweł z Brzezin, and the non-pacifist and Ebionite group, led by the Belarusian Symon Budny. In 1579, the Italian exile Fausto Sozzini arrived in Poland and applied for admission to the &quot;Ecclesia Minor&quot;, which was refused because of his rather unusual personal objection to water baptism, but they saw in the Italian an able advocate and Sozzini&#x27;s capable answering of Budny, followed by his marriage to the daughter of Krzysztof Morsztyn Sr. in 1586 cemented his place among the Polish Brethren. The calling of the group &quot;Socinian&quot; in England is more a result of the place given to Sozzini&#x27;s writings in the publishing of his grandson Andrzej Wiszowaty Sr. in Amsterdam a century later than any role of active leadership in Sozzini&#x27;s life, especially given that without submitting to baptism, he could never formally join the church that later bore his name abroad.

===1602–1638: Racovian Academy===
Their biggest cultural centres were Pińczów and Raków, site of the main Arian printing press and the university &quot;Racovian Academy&quot; () founded in 1602 and closed in 1638, which trained over 1000 students.

===1658: Expulsion===
The Brethren never participated in the Sandomierz Agreement of 1570 between different Polish Protestants. The Minor Church in Poland was dissolved on July 20, 1658, when the Sejm expelled the Socinians from Poland after a series of 17th-century wars known as the Deluge in which Protestant Sweden invaded Poland since the Brethren (like almost all other non-Catholic Christians) were commonly seen as Swedish collaborators.

The Brethren were exiled in three directions and found asylum in the following regions:
* Duchy of Prussia, where Krzysztof Crell-Spinowski and his sons founded new congregations.
* Netherlands, where Andrzej Wiszowaty Sr. published the &quot;Bibliotheca Fratrum Polonorum quos Unitarios vocant&quot; (1668) and Christopher Sand published the (1684).
* Transylvania, where the Unitarian Church of Transylvania enjoyed freedom. This was the destination of Andrzej Wiszowaty Jr. who became a teacher at the Unitarian College in Kolozsvár (today Cluj, Romania).

==Beliefs==

===Theology===
Originally, the Minor Church followed a non-trinitarian doctrine, inspired by the writings of Michael Servetus. Later on, Socinianism, named for the Italian theologian Fausto Sozzini, became its main theological approach. 
They were against capital punishment and did not believe in the traditional Christian doctrines of Hell or the Trinity.

===Church and state===
They advocated the separation of church and state and taught the equality and brotherhood of all people. They opposed social privileges based on religious affiliation, and their adherents refused military service (they were known for carrying wooden swords, instead of the real almost obligatory szablas), and they declined to serve in political office.

==Influence==
Although never numerous, they had a significant impact on political thought in Poland. After being expelled from Poland, they emigrated to England, East Prussia and the Netherlands, where their works were widely published and influenced much of the thinking of later philosophers such as John Locke and Pierre Bayle.

Their main ideologues were Piotr z Goniadza (&quot;Gonesius&quot;), Grzegorz Paweł z Brzezin, Marcin Czechowic, although Johannes Crellius (from Germany), and Johann Ludwig von Wolzogen (who came to Poland from Austria) were far better known outside Poland. Among the best known adherents of this fellowship are Mikołaj Sienicki, Jan Niemojewski, and writers and poets Zbigniew Morsztyn, Olbrycht Karmanowski and Wacław Potocki.

This expulsion is sometimes taken as the beginning of decline of famous Polish religious freedom, although the decline started earlier and ended later: the last non-Catholic deputy was removed from parliament in the beginning of the 18th century. Most of Polish Brethren moved to the Netherlands, where they greatly influenced European opinion, becoming precursors to Enlightenment. 

===Influence in Britain===
John Locke was preceded by a few decades by Samuel Przypkowski on tolerance and by Andrzej Wiszowaty on &#x27;rational religion&#x27;. Isaac Newton had met Samuel Crell, son of Johannes Crellius, of the Spinowski family. Newton was well informed about the developments in Poland and collected many books from the Racovian Academy. 

The Englishman John Biddle had translated two works by Przypkowski, as well as the Racovian Catechism and a work by Joachim Stegmann, a &quot;Polish Brother&quot; from Germany. Biddle&#x27;s followers had very close relations with the Polish Socinian family of Crellius (aka Spinowski).

===Influence in the United States===
Subsequently, the Unitarian strain of Christianity was continued by, most notably, Joseph Priestley, who had emigrated to the United States and was a friend of both James Madison and Thomas Jefferson, the latter of whom sometimes attended services at Priestley&#x27;s congregation in Philadelphia. Notably, Priestley was very well informed on the earlier developments in Poland, especially by his mentions of Socinus and Szymon Budny (translator of Bible, author of many pamphlets against the Trinity).

===In the modern era===
During the Second Polish Republic, the priest Karol Grycz-Śmiałowski recreated what he considered was a revival of the Church of Polish Brethren in Kraków in 1937. During the People&#x27;s Republic of Poland, it was registered in 1967 as the Unity of Polish Brethren ().

Modern groups that look to the Polish Brethren include the Christadelphians and Church of God General Conference. Although Christadelphians had since their origins in the 1840s always looked for historical precedents, the group was unaware of closer precedents in Socinianism. That changed with a series of articles in the community magazine during the early 1970 that was subsequently published. The Polish arm of the Christadelphians use the name in a conscious echo of Socinian precedents. The Atlanta Bible College of the Church of God General Conference also publishes a Journal continuing research into the Polish Brethren and related groups.

<text>:&quot;Cataluña is the Spanish name for Catalonia&quot;

Cataluña, Op. 47, No. 2, is a composition by Isaac Albéniz. It premiered as a piano performance in Paris in January 1899. Since it has been transcribed for classical guitar by Miguel Llobet, it has become one of the staples of classical guitar music. It has been performed and recorded by guitarists such as Julian Bream, John Williams, Milos Janjic, Charles Mokotoff and many others. It is usually played in the key of G minor.

<doc id="358057" wikidata="Q4226027" url="?curid=358057" title="When HARLIE Was One">
<text>When HARLIE Was One is a 1972 science fiction novel by American writer David Gerrold. It was nominated for the Nebula Award for Best Novel in 1972 and the Hugo Award for Best Novel in 1973. The novel, a &quot;fix-up&quot; of previously published short stories, was published as an original paperback by Ballantine Books in 1972, with an accompanying Science Fiction Book Club release. A revised version, subtitled &quot;Release 2.0&quot;, was published in 1988 by Bantam Books.

== Plot introduction ==
Central to the story is an artificial intelligence named H.A.R.L.I.E., also referred to by the proper name &quot;HARLIE&quot;—an acronym for Human Analog Replication, Lethetic Intelligence Engine (originally Human Analog Robot Life Input Equivalents).

HARLIE&#x27;s story revolves around his relationship with David Auberson, the psychologist who is responsible for guiding HARLIE from childhood into adulthood. It is also the story of HARLIE&#x27;s fight against being turned off, and the philosophical question of whether or not HARLIE is human; for that matter, what it &quot;means&quot; to be human.

&quot;When HARLIE Was One&quot; contains one of the first fictional representations of a computer virus (preceded by Gregory Benford in 1970), and one of the first uses of the term &quot;virus&quot; to describe a program that infects another computer.

==Reception==
Theodore Sturgeon reported that the novel &quot;carries a good freight of social and psychological insight&quot;.

==In other works==
The HARLIE intelligence engine appears in a number of Gerrold&#x27;s other works:
*In the &quot;Star Wolf&quot; series, HARLIE is routinely installed as the administrating AI of Terran warships.
* The Dingilliad series, &quot;Jumping Off the Planet&quot;,&quot; Bouncing Off the Moon&quot;, and &quot;Leaping to the Stars&quot;.
* &quot;A Nest for Nightmares&quot;, the fifth book of &quot;The War Against the Chtorr&quot;.
*HARLIE is a major character in &quot;Hella &quot;.

<doc id="358059" wikidata="Q528476" url="?curid=358059" title="John Bartram">
<text>John Bartram (June 3, 1699 – September 22, 1777) was an American botanist, horticulturist, and explorer, based in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, for most of his career. Swedish botanist and taxonomist Carl Linnaeus said he was the &quot;greatest natural botanist in the world.&quot; Bartram corresponded with and shared North American plants and seeds with a variety of scientists in England and Europe.

He started what is known as Bartram&#x27;s Garden in 1728 at his farm in Kingsessing (now part of Philadelphia). It was considered the first botanic garden in the United States. His sons and descendants operated it until 1850. Still operating in a partnership between the city of Philadelphia and a non-profit foundation, it was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1960.

==Early life==
Bartram was born into a prominent Quaker political and farming family in Marple near Darby, Pennsylvania, on June 3, 1699. His parents were William Bartram and his first wife Elizabeth (&quot;née&quot; Hunt). His mother Elizabeth died in 1701. John Bartram and his brother James were left to be raised with their maternal grandfather James Hunt of Kingsessing. William Bartram, his father, was killed and his stepmother and half-siblings were captured during the Tuscarora War in 1711. Elizabeth (&quot;née&quot; Smith), John&#x27;s stepmother, brought his half-siblings to Pennsylvania after the family was ransomed by relatives from Philadelphia. John remained in Pennsylvania, while one of his brothers, also named William, later went to North Carolina to take care of the estate of their father.

Bartram later wrote &quot;all my younger years being subject to grip, grievous coughs, heartburn, acrimonious looseness, dizziness, and rheumatism.&quot; He was afflicted with a &quot;slavish fear of lightning&quot; that carried with him to adulthood. Bartram considered himself to be a plain farmer, with no formal education beyond the local school. He had a lifelong interest in medicine and medicinal plants, and read widely. He started his botanical career by devoting a small area of his farm to growing plants he found interesting. Later, he made contact with European botanists and gardeners interested in North American plants, and developed his hobby into a thriving business.

==Plant collecting, correspondence, and travels ==
Bartram began to travel extensively in the eastern American colonies in order to study and collect plants. 

Bartram maintained a friendship with Peter Collinson, Alexander Catcot, and others through letter writing between London and the colonies, and he regularly collected specimens for Collinson and others in Europe who were interested in obtaining unfamiliar species from the New World for their gardens and scientific study. 

In 1737 Bartram travelled by horseback through modern day Delaware and the Eastern Shore of Maryland to Northampton County, Virginia. In the fall of 1738, he made another excurion from his home in Philadelphia through Virginia, visiting the Gover family in Anne Arundel County, to Port Tobacco on the Potomac. Cedar Point, Maryland, opposite Hooe&#x27;s Ferry in King George County, Virginia, and then went to Fredericksburg. He proceeded to visit John Clayton in Gloucester County, Virginia, crossed the York River to visit John Custis in Williamsburg, Virginia, and then journeyed up the James River to visit William Byrd II&#x27;s plantation at Westover. He continued westware to visit Isham Randolph&#x27;s Dungeness estate, and then continued west to the Blue Ridge Mountains and the Shenandoah Valley.

In 1743, he visited western parts of New York and the northern shores of Lake Ontario, and wrote &quot;Observations on the Inhabitants, Climate, Soil, Rivers, Productions, Animals, and other Matters Worthy of Notice, made by Mr. John Bartram in his Travels from Pennsylvania to Onondaga, Oswego, and the Lake Ontario, in Canada&quot; (London, 1751). During the winter of 1765/66, he visited East Florida in the south, which was a British colony, and published an account of this trip with his journal (London, 1766). He also visited areas along the Ohio River west of the Appalachian Mountains. Many of his plant acquisitions were shipped to collectors in Europe. In return, they supplied him with books and apparatus.

Bartram, sometimes called the &quot;father of American botany&quot;, was one of the first practicing Linnaean botanists in North America. He forwarded plant specimens to Carl Linnaeus, Dillenius, and Gronovius. He also assisted Linnaeus&#x27;s student Pehr Kalm during his extended collecting trip to North America in 1748–1750.

Bartram was aided in his collecting efforts by other British colonists. In Bartram&#x27;s &quot;Diary of a Journey through the Carolinas, Georgia and Florida&quot;, a trip taken from July 1, 1765, to April 10, 1766, Bartram wrote of specimens he had collected. In the colony of British East Florida, he was helped by Dr. David Yeats, secretary of the colony.

About 1728, he established an botanic garden in Kingsessing, on the west bank of the Schuylkill, about 3 miles (5 km) from the center of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Known as Bartram&#x27;s Garden, it is frequently cited as the first true botanic collection in North America. It was designated in 1960 as a National Historic Landmark.

In 1743, Bartram was one of the co-founders, along with Benjamin Franklin, of the American Philosophical Society in Philadelphia. It supported scientific studies as well as philosophy.

==Contact with other botanists==

Bartram was particularly instrumental in sending seeds from the New World to European gardeners; many North American trees and flowers were first introduced into cultivation in Europe by this route. Beginning around 1733, Bartram&#x27;s work was assisted by his association with the English merchant Peter Collinson. Collinson, also a lover of plants, was a fellow Quaker and a member of the Royal Society, with a familiar relationship with its president, Sir Hans Sloane. Collinson shared Bartram&#x27;s new plants with friends and fellow gardeners. Early Bartram collections went to Lord Petre, Philip Miller at the Chelsea Physic Garden, Mark Catesby, the Duke of Richmond, and the Duke of Norfolk. In the 1730s, Robert James Petre, 8th Baron Petre of Thorndon Hall, Essex, was the foremost collector in Europe of North American trees and shrubs. Earl Petre&#x27;s death in 1743 resulted in his American tree collection being auctioned off to Woburn, Goodwood, and other large English country estates. Thereafter, Collinson became Bartram&#x27;s chief London agent.

&quot;Bartram&#x27;s Boxes&quot;, as they became known, were shipped regularly to Peter Collinson every fall for distribution in England to a wide list of clients, including the Duke of Argyll, James Gordon, James Lee, and John Busch, progenitor of the exotic Loddiges nursery in London. The boxes generally contained 100 or more varieties of seeds, and sometimes included dried plant specimens and natural history curiosities, as well. Live plants were more difficult and expensive to send and were reserved for Collinson and a few special correspondents.

In 1765, after lobbying by Collinson and Benjamin Franklin in London, George III rewarded Bartram a pension of £50 per year as King&#x27;s Botanist for North America, a post he held until his death. With this position, Bartram shipped his seeds and plants also to the royal collection at Kew Gardens. Bartram also contributed seeds to the Oxford and Edinburgh botanic gardens. In 1769 he was elected a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in Stockholm.

Bartram died on September 22, 1777. He was buried at the Darby Friends Cemetery in Darby, Pennsylvania.

==Personal views==
===Native Americans===
Bartram did not hold the Native Americans in high regard, with his views affected by his father being killed while Bartram was young during the Tuscarora War. One letter Bartram wrote to Peter Collinson ends with &quot;Many years past, in our most peaceable times, far beyond the mountains, as I was walking in a path with an Indian guide, hired for two dollars, an Indian man met me and pulled off my hat in a great passion, and chawed it all round—I suppose to show me that he would eat me if I came into that country again.&quot; Bartram twice wrote the only way to deal with the Native Americans &quot;is to bang them stoutly&quot;.

===Slavery===
Bartram owned, bought, and sold a number of slaves throughout his life, and, to his later regret, helped his son William purchase slaves when he made a failing attempt at being a Florida planter. A letter John Bartram wrote mentioning his slave purchases to his son William reads, &quot;all thy friends here laments thy resolute choice to live at St Johns &amp; leave off drawing or writeing... thay say the negros will run away or murther thee&quot;. John Bartram wrote he received the &quot;daily assistance &amp; choice&quot; of his friends in Charleston, which included Alexander Garden, Henry Laurens, and John Moultrie. It is clear from two letters to his son dated April 5 and 9, 1766, that Laurens was a major source of advice as he worked on obtaining plantation supplies and arranged the shipping of the slaves and supplies from Charleston to Florida. Bartram wrote a letter criticizing George Whitefield&#x27;s ambition to educate slaves. There is also the remains of a grave at Bartram&#x27;s Garden that is attributed to a free black individual that in as late as the 1860&#x27;s was first given the name &quot;Harvey&quot;. Although there is no historical record of Harvey, biographical accounts mention that Bartram freed a slave and told J. Hector St. John de Crèvecœur that one of his former slaves transacted his &quot;business in Philadelphia, with a punctuality, from which he has never deviated.&quot;

===Religion===
In the letter criticizing George Whitefield, Bartram also expressed &quot;utter disdain&quot; for Whitefield&#x27;s Calvinism. He was twice married, in accordance with the discipline of the Society of Friends, of which he was a member until 1758. Bartram was disowned for holding opinions not in accordance with the doctrines of Friends.

==Family==

Bartram married twice, first in 1723 to Mary Maris (d. 1727), with whom he had two sons, Richard and Isaac. After her death, in 1729 he married Ann Mendenhall (1703–1789). They had five boys and four girls together.

His third son, William Bartram (1739–1823), became a noted botanist, natural history artist, and ornithologist in his own right. He wrote &quot;Travels Through North &amp; South Carolina, Georgia, East &amp; West Florida...&quot; which was published in Philadelphia by James &amp; Johnson in 1791.

The family business in North American plants was continued after the American Revolution by Bartram&#x27;s sons John Bartram, Jr., and William Bartram. A total of three generations of the Bartram family continued to operate and expand the botanic garden. Bartram&#x27;s Garden was known as the major botanic garden in Philadelphia until the last Bartram heirs sold out in 1850.

==Legacy and honors==
Most of Bartram&#x27;s many plant discoveries were named by botanists in Europe. He is best known today for the discovery and introduction of a wide range of North American flowering trees and shrubs, including kalmia, rhododendron, and magnolia species; for introducing the &quot;Dionaea muscipula&quot; or Venus flytrap to cultivation; and for discovering the Franklin tree, &quot;Franklinia alatamaha&quot; in southeastern Georgia in 1765, later named by his son William Bartram.

A genus of mosses, &quot;Bartramia&quot;, was named for him, as were such plants as the North American serviceberry, &quot;Amelanchier bartramiana&quot;, as well as the subtropical tree &quot;Commersonia&quot; &quot;bartramia&quot; (brown kurrajong). This grows in an area from the Bellinger River in coastal eastern Australia to Cape York, Vanuatu, and Malaysia.

John Bartram High School in Philadelphia is named after him.

Bartram&#x27;s Garden has been designated as a National Historic Landmark.

<text>William Bartram (April 20, 1739 – July 22, 1823) was an American naturalist, writer and explorer. Bartram was the author of an acclaimed book, now known by the shortened title Bartram&#x27;s &quot;Travels&quot;, which chronicled his explorations of the Southern Colonies of British North America from 1773 to 1777. Bartram has been described as &quot;the first naturalist who penetrated the dense tropical forests of Florida&quot;.

Bartram was one of the first ornithologists born in America. In 1756, at the age of 17, he collected the type specimens of 14 species of American birds, which were illustrated and described by the English naturalist George Edwards in &quot;Gleanings of Natural History&quot; vol. 2 (1760). These accounts formed the basis of the scientific descriptions of Linnaeus (1707–1778), Johann Friedrich Gmelin (1748–1804) and John Latham (1740–1837). Bartram also made significant contributions to botanical literature. Like his father, he was a member of the American Philosophical Society, elected in 1768.

==Early life and family==
The son of Ann (&quot;née&quot; Mendenhall) and the naturalist John Bartram, William and his twin sister Elizabeth were born in Kingsessing, Philadelphia, in the Province of Pennsylvania. As a boy, he accompanied his father on many of his travels to the Catskill Mountains, the New Jersey Pine Barrens, New England, and Florida. From his mid-teens, Bartram was noted for the quality of his botanic and ornithological drawings. He also had an increasing role in the maintenance of his father&#x27;s botanic garden, and added many rare species to it.

On &quot;may ye 30th 1756&quot;, his father John wrote the following passage in a letter to the English naturalist Peter Collinson: &quot;Billy is much obliged to thee for his drawing paper...he hath drawn many rare birds in order to send to thee &amp; dryed ye birds to send to his friend edwards to whome he is much obliged for those two curious bookes...he spent his time this spring in shooting &amp; drawing ye rare birds of quick passage...&quot;

==Bartram&#x27;s explorations (1773–77)==
===Travels in Georgia===

William Bartram arrived in Charleston on March 31, 1773. He learned that a Native American congress was to take place in Augusta, Georgia in June and was invited by Superintendent of Indian affairs, John Stuart, to join the party that would survey a new land cession. After attending to some business Bartram traveled on to Savannah, arriving in that city on either April 11 or 12. While he awaited the beginning of the Native American congress he traveled to the coast of Georgia. He first visited some rice plantations in Midway then traveled on to Darien where he was the guest of Lachlan McIntosh.

In &quot;Travels&quot;, Bartram related an incident at this point that most probably took place in 1776. As he traveled through the sparsely populated country of South Georgia, he encountered an &quot;intrepid Siminole&quot; who had resolved upon killing the next white man he met but was disarmed by Bartram&#x27;s unexpected friendliness.

During his trip along the coast, Bartram revisited the region of Fort Barrington on the Altamaha River. John and William Bartram had discovered two new trees there in 1765, but they had no flowers for the season was late. William described these trees in &quot;Travels&quot;, the Franklin tree (&quot;Franklinia alatamaha&quot;) and fevertree (&quot;Pinkneya pubens&quot;). The Franklin tree no longer exists in the wild and all living trees are descended from seeds collected by William Bartram.

Bartram then traveled to Augusta and explored the area while he awaited the conclusion of the Native American congress. The conference ended on June 3, 1773, with the Treaty of Augusta. In return for dissolving their debts to the traders in Augusta, the Creeks and Cherokees gave up 674,000 acres of land in northeast Georgia. Bartram joined the survey party as it marked the boundary. An incident occurred at a place known as the Great Buffalo Lick when the Native Americans questioned the accuracy of the surveyor&#x27;s course. When the surveyor said it was right because the compass told him so the chief, Young Warrior, said that:

... he knew better, and the little wicked instrument was a liar; and he would not acquiesce in its decisions, since it would wrong the Indians out of their land. This mistake (the surveyor proving to be in the wrong) displeased the Indians; the dispute arose to that height, that the Chief and his party had determined to break up the business, and return the shortest way home, and forbad the surveyors to proceed any farther: however, after some delay, the complaisance and prudent conduct of the Colonel made them change their resolution; the Chief became reconciled, upon condition that the compass should be discarded, and rendered incapable of serving on this business; that the Chief himself should lead the survey; and, moreover, receive an order for a very considerable quantity of goods.

Bartram returned to Savannah in mid-July and spent the fall and winter on the coast of Georgia, exploring the Altamaha River, writing his report, and preparing his seeds for shipment to England.

===Travels in Florida===
In March 1774, Bartram began his much-anticipated trip to East Florida. He crossed the mouth of the St. Marys River and landed on the north end of Amelia Island, then crossing Egan&#x27;s creek he traveled to Lord Egmont&#x27;s plantation, near where the town of Fernandina would later arise. There he was entertained by Stephen Egan, Egmont&#x27;s agent, who rode with him around the entire island observing the plantation and Indian mounds. Bartram and Egan sailed from Amelia Island on the inner passage (now the Intracoastal Waterway) to the St. Johns River and to the Cow Ford, the future site of Jacksonville, where Bartram purchased a little sailboat. 
In three days Bartram landed at the plantation of Francis Philip Fatio at Switzerland. There he received information concerning the recent disturbances at Spalding&#x27;s Stores. He paused the next day at Fort Picolata where he had failed as a planter seven years earlier.
Bartram then kept to the west bank, or Indian shore, the river being the division between Indian country on the west bank and English land on the east. He observed a Seminole village on the bluff where Palatka now stands and where he was invited to a watermelon feast that summer. Just south of Palatka, at Stokes Landing, James Spalding built his Lower Store where Bartram made his headquarters while in Florida. One day while working at his desk Bartram heard a disturbance in the adjacent Indian camp. Stepping outside he discovered his Seminole neighbors were alarmed by a large rattlesnake that had entered their camp. They entreated &quot;Puc Puggy&quot; to come kill the snake, which Bartram reluctantly agreed to do. Later he saw three young men approaching. He wrote:

Bartram joined Spalding&#x27;s traders in mid-April on a trip to Cuscowilla (Micanopy) and Alachua Savannah, now Paynes Prairie Preserve State Park. In late May, Bartram traveled up the St. Johns River to Spalding&#x27;s Upper Store at present-day Astor and to Blue Spring. Some of the most memorable events in &quot;Travels&quot; occurred during this trip upriver when a wolf stole his fish as Bartram slept, he was jostled and threatened by alligators while fishing from his boat, and he was witness to a territorial battle between two of the monsters. He wrote:

During the summer Bartram made another excursion to Alachua Savannah and on to the Suwannee River. He traveled one last time up the St. Johns River in September and left Florida forever in November 1774.

===Exploration of the Cherokee Nation===

On April 22, 1775, Bartram left Charleston, South Carolina on horseback to explore the Cherokee Nation. After passing through Augusta May 10, Dartmouth on May 15, a few days later he left Fort Prince George and Keowee after not being able to procure a guide.

In addition to his botanizing, Bartram aptly described the journey:

...all alone in a wild Indian country, a thousand miles from my native land, and a vast distance from any settlements of white people.

It was now after noon; I approached a charming vale, amidst sublimely high forests, awful shades! Darkness gathers around, far distant thunder rolls over the trembling hills; the black clouds with august majesty and power, moves slowly forwards, shading regions of towering hills, and threatening all the destructions of a thunderstorm; all around is now still as death, not a whisper is heard, but a total inactivity and silence seems to pervade the earth; the birds afraid to utter a chirrup, and in low tremulous voices take leave of each other, seeking covert and safety; every insect is silenced, and nothing heard but the roaring of the approaching hurricane; the mighty cloud now expands its sable wings, extending from North to South, and is driven irresistibly on by the tumultuous winds, spreading his livid wings around the gloomy concave, armed with terrors of thunder and fiery shafts of lightning; now the lofty forests bend low beneath its fury, their limbs and wavy boughs are tossed about and catch hold of each other; the mountains tremble and seem to reel about, and the ancient hills to be shaken to their foundations: the furious storm sweeps along, smoaking through the vale and over the resounding hills; the face of the earth is obscured by the deluge descending from the firmament, and I am deafened by the din of thunder; the tempestuous scene damps my spirits, and my horse sinks under me at the tremendous peals, as I hasten for the plain.

==Return to Philadelphia==
Bartram returned to Philadelphia in January 1777 and assisted his brother John in all aspects of running Bartram&#x27;s Garden.

In the late 1780s, he completed the book for which he became most famous, &quot;Travels through North and South Carolina, Georgia, East and West Florida, the Cherokee Country, etc.&quot; It was considered at the time one of the foremost books on American natural history. Many of Bartram&#x27;s accounts of historical sites were the earliest records, including the Georgia mound site of Ocmulgee. In addition to its contributions to scientific knowledge, &quot;Travels&quot; is noted for its original descriptions of the American countryside. Bartram&#x27;s writing influenced many of the Romantic writers of the day. William Wordsworth, Samuel Taylor Coleridge, and François-René de Chateaubriand are known to have read the book, and its influence can be seen in many of their works.

Although Bartram has often been characterized as a recluse, all evidence shows that he remained active in commercial, scientific, and intellectual pursuits well into the nineteenth century. He tutored nieces and nephews, penned a number of essays, contributed to several works anonymously, and helped run the family horticultural business. In 1802, Bartram met the school teacher Alexander Wilson and began to teach him the rudiments of ornithology and natural history illustration. Wilson&#x27;s &quot;American Ornithology&quot; includes many references to Bartram and the area around Bartram&#x27;s Garden. Among Bartram&#x27;s more significant later contributions were the illustrations for his friend Benjamin Smith Barton&#x27;s explanation of the Linnaean system, &quot;Elements of Botany&quot; (1803–04).

After the War of 1812, when many of his colleagues, contacts, and friends had died, Bartram settled into a long period of work, observation, and study at the family&#x27;s garden in Kingsessing. He maintained a &quot;Diary&quot; that records bird migrations, plant life, and the weather. He refused a request to teach botany at the University of Pennsylvania, and in his sixties, declined an invitation from President Thomas Jefferson to accompany an expedition up the Red River in the Louisiana Territory, in 1806.

==Death==
Bartram died at his home in 1823, at the age of 84. According to a short biography penned by Robert Carr, &quot;He wrote an article on the natural history of a plant a few minutes before his death.&quot; Details of the event were described in a letter by Thomas L. McKenney to Dolley Madison, dated July 28, 1835:&quot;My Dear Madam, / You once did me the favor to send me some lines on the traveller &amp; Botanist Bartram. I send with this a likeness of that excellent man ... On a visit receently [sic] to Bartram&#x27;s garden Mr. Car pointed out the spot where the old man died. You will doubtless remember it. It is under a pear tree that grewe at the south corner of the house. You have doubtless seen it. The old man, then in his 86th year, rose from the Table, taking with him a bit of bread &amp; cheese, saying – &quot;I will do as the boys do.&quot; In going out, he reached the pear tree – where he was shortly after discovered throwing up blood from his lungs. A crumb, it supposed, choaking him, he ruptured, in his efforts to dislodge it, a blood vessel. He walked [to] another pear tree near the west corner of the house, &amp; returning, aided by the family, he reached the first, under which he was discovered, were he died.&quot;

<doc id="358069" wikidata="Q619388" url="?curid=358069" title="Proof by infinite descent">
<text>In mathematics, a proof by infinite descent, also known as Fermat&#x27;s method of descent, is a particular kind of proof by contradiction used to show that a statement cannot possibly hold for any number, by showing that if the statement were to hold for a number, then the same would be true for a smaller number, leading to an infinite descent and ultimately a contradiction. It is a method which relies on the well-ordering principle, and is often used to show that a given equation, such as a Diophantine equation, has no solutions.

Typically, one shows that if a solution to a problem existed, which in some sense was related to one or more natural numbers, it would necessarily imply that a second solution existed, which was related to one or more &#x27;smaller&#x27; natural numbers. This in turn would imply a third solution related to smaller natural numbers, implying a fourth solution, therefore a fifth solution, and so on. However, there cannot be an infinity of ever-smaller natural numbers, and therefore by mathematical induction, the original premise—that any solution exists—is incorrect: its correctness produces a contradiction.

An alternative way to express this is to assume one or more solutions or examples exists, from which a smallest solution or example—a minimal counterexample—can then be inferred. Once there, one would try to prove that if a smallest solution exists, then it must imply the existence of a smaller solution (in some sense), which again proves that the existence of any solution would lead to a contradiction.

The earliest uses of the method of infinite descent appear in Euclid&#x27;s &quot;Elements&quot;. A typical example is Proposition 31 of Book 7, in which Euclid proves that every composite integer is divided (in Euclid&#x27;s terminology &quot;measured&quot;) by some prime number. 

The method was much later developed by Fermat, who coined the term and often used it for Diophantine equations. Two typical examples are showing the non-solvability of the Diophantine equation formula_1 and proving Fermat&#x27;s theorem on sums of two squares, which states that an odd prime &quot;p&quot; can be expressed as a sum of two squares when formula_2 (see Modular arithmetic and proof by infinite descent). In this way Fermat was able to show the non-existence of solutions in many cases of Diophantine equations of classical interest (for example, the problem of four perfect squares in arithmetic progression).

In some cases, to the modern eye, his &quot;method of infinite descent&quot; is an exploitation of the inversion of the doubling function for rational points on an elliptic curve &quot;E&quot;. The context is of a hypothetical non-trivial rational point on &quot;E&quot;. Doubling a point on &quot;E&quot; roughly doubles the length of the numbers required to write it (as number of digits), so that &quot;halving&quot; a point gives a rational with smaller terms. Since the terms are positive, they cannot decrease forever.

== Number theory==
In the number theory of the twentieth century, the infinite descent method was taken up again, and pushed to a point where it connected with the main thrust of algebraic number theory and the study of L-functions. The structural result of Mordell, that the rational points on an elliptic curve &quot;E&quot; form a finitely-generated abelian group, used an infinite descent argument based on &quot;E&quot;/2&quot;E&quot; in Fermat&#x27;s style.

To extend this to the case of an abelian variety &quot;A&quot;, André Weil had to make more explicit the way of quantifying the size of a solution, by means of a height function – a concept that became foundational. To show that &quot;A&quot;(&quot;Q&quot;)/2&quot;A&quot;(&quot;Q&quot;) is finite, which is certainly a necessary condition for the finite generation of the group &quot;A&quot;(&quot;Q&quot;) of rational points of &quot;A&quot;, one must do calculations in what later was recognised as Galois cohomology. In this way, abstractly-defined cohomology groups in the theory become identified with &quot;descents&quot; in the tradition of Fermat. The Mordell–Weil theorem was at the start of what later became a very extensive theory.

== Application examples ==

=== Irrationality of ===
The proof that the square root of 2 () is irrational (i.e. cannot be expressed as a fraction of two whole numbers) was discovered by the ancient Greeks, and is perhaps the earliest known example of a proof by infinite descent. Pythagoreans discovered that the diagonal of a square is incommensurable with its side, or in modern language, that the square root of two is irrational. Little is known with certainty about the time or circumstances of this discovery, but the name of Hippasus of Metapontum is often mentioned. For a while, the Pythagoreans treated as an official secret the discovery that the square root of two is irrational, and, according to legend, Hippasus was murdered for divulging it. The square root of two is occasionally called &quot;Pythagoras&#x27; number&quot; or &quot;Pythagoras&#x27; Constant&quot;, for example .

The ancient Greeks, not having algebra, worked out a geometric proof by infinite descent (John Horton Conway presented another geometric proof by infinite descent that may be more accessible). The following is an algebraic proof along similar lines:

Suppose that were rational. Then it could be written as

:formula_3

for two natural numbers, and . Then squaring would give

:formula_4
:formula_5

so 2 must divide &quot;p&quot;2. Because 2 is a prime number, it must also divide &quot;p&quot;, by Euclid&#x27;s lemma. So &quot;p&quot; = 2&quot;r&quot;, for some integer &quot;r&quot;.

But then,

:formula_6
:formula_7

which shows that 2 must divide &quot;q&quot; as well. So &quot;q&quot; = 2&quot;s&quot; for some integer &quot;s&quot;.

This gives

:formula_8.

Therefore, if could be written as a rational number, then it could always be written as a rational number with smaller parts, which itself could be written with yet-smaller parts, &quot;ad infinitum&quot;. But this is impossible in the set of natural numbers. Since is a real number, which can be either rational or irrational, the only option left is for to be irrational.

(Alternatively, this proves that if were rational, no &quot;smallest&quot; representation as a fraction could exist, as any attempt to find a &quot;smallest&quot; representation &quot;p&quot;/&quot;q&quot; would imply that a smaller one existed, which is a similar contradiction.)

=== Irrationality of if it is not an integer ===

For positive integer &quot;k&quot;, suppose that is not an integer, but is rational and can be expressed as for natural numbers &quot;m&quot; and &quot;n&quot;, and let &quot;q&quot; be the largest integer less than (that is, &quot;q&quot; is the floor of ). Then

:formula_9

The numerator and denominator were each multiplied by the expression ( − &quot;q&quot;)—which is positive but less than 1—and then simplified independently. So, the resulting products, say &quot;m′&quot; and &quot;n′&quot;, are themselves integers, and are less than &quot;m&quot; and &quot;n&quot; respectively. Therefore, no matter what natural numbers &quot;m&quot; and &quot;n&quot; are used to express , there exist smaller natural numbers &quot;m′&quot; &lt; &quot;m&quot; and &quot;n′&quot; &lt; &quot;n&quot; that have the same ratio. But infinite descent on the natural numbers is impossible, so this disproves the original assumption that could be expressed as a ratio of natural numbers.

===Non-solvability of &quot;r&quot;2 + &quot;s&quot;4 = &quot;t&quot;4 and its permutations===
The non-solvability of formula_10 in integers is sufficient to show the non-solvability of formula_11 in integers, which is a special case of Fermat&#x27;s Last Theorem, and the historical proofs of the latter proceeded by more broadly proving the former using infinite descent. The following more recent proof demonstrates both of these impossibilities by proving still more broadly that a Pythagorean triangle cannot have any two of its sides each either a square or twice a square, since there is no smallest such triangle:

Suppose there exists such a Pythagorean triangle. Then it can be scaled down to give a primitive (i.e., with no common factors other than 1) Pythagorean triangle with the same property. Primitive Pythagorean triangles&#x27; sides can be written as formula_12 formula_13 formula_14, with &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; relatively prime and with &quot;a+b&quot; odd and hence &quot;y&quot; and &quot;z&quot; both odd. The property that &quot;y&quot; and &quot;z&quot; are each odd means that neither &quot;y&quot; nor &quot;z&quot; can be twice a square. Furthermore, if &quot;x&quot; is a square or twice a square, then each of &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; is a square or twice a square. There are three cases, depending on which two sides are postulated to each be a square or twice a square:

*y&quot; and &quot;z: In this case, &quot;y&quot; and &quot;z&quot; are both squares. But then the right triangle with legs formula_15 and formula_16 and hypotenuse formula_17 also would have integer sides including a square leg (formula_16) and a square hypotenuse (formula_17), and would have a smaller hypotenuse (formula_17 compared to formula_14).
*z&quot; and &quot;x: &quot;z&quot; is a square. The integer right triangle with legs formula_22 and formula_23 and hypotenuse formula_24 also would have two sides (formula_22 and formula_23) each of which is a square or twice a square, and a smaller hypotenuse (formula_24 compared to .
*y&quot; and &quot;x: &quot;y&quot; is a square. The integer right triangle with legs formula_23 and formula_29 and hypotenuse formula_22 would have two sides (&quot;b&quot; and &quot;a&quot;) each of which is a square or twice a square, with a smaller hypotenuse than the original triangle (formula_22 compared to formula_14).

In any of these cases, one Pythagorean triangle with two sides each of which is a square or twice a square has led to a smaller one, which in turn would lead to a smaller one, etc.; since such a sequence cannot go on infinitely, the original premise that such a triangle exists must be wrong.

This implies that the equations
:formula_33
:formula_34 and
:formula_35
cannot have non-trivial solutions, since non-trivial solutions would give Pythagorean triangles with two sides being squares.

For other similar proofs by infinite descent for the &quot;n&quot; = 4 case of Fermat&#x27;s Theorem, see the articles by Grant and Perella and Barbara.

<text>Johannes Crellius (Polish: &quot;Jan Crell&quot;, English: John Crell; 26 July 1590 in Hellmitzheim – 11 June 1633 in Raków) was a Polish and German theologian.

==Life==
Johann Crell&#x27;s father, Johann Crell Sr., was pastor of the church at Hellmitzheim, (today part of Iphofen in Kitzingen District), in Franken, northern Bavaria. His son Krzysztof Crell-Spinowski (1622–1680), and his grandsons Christopher Crell Jr. M.D. of London (1658-), Samuel Crellius (1660–1747) and Paweł Crell-Spinowski (1677-), as well as his great-grandsons in Georgia, United States, were all proponents of Socinian views.

Crellius moved to Poland at the age of 22, and quickly became known as one of the chief theologians of the Socinians, also known as Polish brethren. From 1613 he worked at the Racovian Academy at Raków, of which he was the rector from 1616 to 1621. In 1630 he worked with Joachim Stegmann Sr. in the production of a German version of the Racovian New Testament.

==Influence==
Several of Crell&#x27;s works were printed first by Rodecki and Sternacki at the printery of the Racovian Academy 1602-1638. These and others then appeared as Vol.III-V of Frans Kuyper&#x27;s &quot;Bibliotheca Fratrum Polonorum quos Unitarios vocant&quot; (&quot;Library of the Polish Brethren called Unitarians&quot;) Amsterdam 1668 Crell also featured in Christopher Sand&#x27;s bibliography and biographical collection &quot;Bibliotheca antitrinitariorum&quot; (1684). These works were widely distributed being owned by Voltaire, John Locke and other Enlightenment thinkers.

Two of Crell&#x27;s works were translated into English. First, &quot;A Learned and Exceeding Well-Compiled Vindication of Liberty of Religion&quot; (London: 1646). Second, &quot;The Two Books ... Touching on God the Father: Wherein Many Things Also Concerning the Nature of the Son of God, and the Holy Spirit are Discoursed of&quot;. The first edition was published in Konigsburg (1665). A second edition was published in London (1691). It was re-titled &quot;The Unity of God Answered and Defended&quot;, but with the exception of the title page it was identical to the first edition.
Knowledge of Crell&#x27;s works passed out of the later generations of English Unitarians. However Thomas Belsham is one of the Unitarian authors who had access to Crell in the Latin and he repeatedly cites Crell in his &quot;The Epistles of Paul the Apostle Translated, with an Exposition, and Notes&quot; (1822).

<doc id="358086" wikidata="Q15591" url="?curid=358086" title="28978 Ixion">
<text>28978 Ixion (, provisional designation ) is a large trans-Neptunian object and a possible dwarf planet. It is located in the Kuiper belt, a region of icy objects orbiting beyond Neptune in the outer Solar System. Ixion is classified as a plutino, a dynamical class of objects in a 2:3 orbital resonance with Neptune. It was discovered in May 2001 by astronomers of the Deep Ecliptic Survey at the Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory, and was announced in July 2001. The object is named after the Greek mythological figure Ixion, who was a king of the Lapiths.

In visible light, Ixion appears dark and moderately red in color due to organic compounds covering its surface. Water ice has been suspected to be present on Ixion&#x27;s surface, but may exist in trace amounts hidden underneath a thick layer of organic compounds. Ixion has a measured diameter of , making it the fourth-largest known plutino. Several astronomers have considered Ixion to be a possible dwarf planet, whereas others consider it a transitional object between irregularly-shaped small Solar System bodies and spherical dwarf planets. Ixion is currently not known to have a natural satellite, so its mass and density remain unknown.

== History ==
=== Discovery ===

Ixion was discovered on 22 May 2001 by a team of American astronomers at the Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory in Chile. The discovery formed part of the Deep Ecliptic Survey, a survey conducted by American astronomer Robert Millis to search for Kuiper belt objects located near the ecliptic plane using telescopes at the facilities of the National Optical Astronomy Observatory. On the night of 22 May 2001, American astronomers James Elliot and Lawrence Wasserman identified Ixion in digital images of the southern sky taken with the 4-meter Víctor M. Blanco Telescope at Cerro Tololo. Ixion was first noted by Elliot while compiling two images taken approximately two hours apart, which revealed Ixion&#x27;s slow motion relative to the background stars. At the time of discovery, Ixion was located in the constellation of Scorpius.

The discoverers of Ixion noted that it appeared relatively bright for a distant object, implying that it might be rather large for a TNO. The discovery supported suggestions that there were undiscovered large trans-Neptunian objects comparable in size to Pluto. Since Ixion&#x27;s discovery, numerous large trans-Neptunian objects, notably the dwarf planets Haumea, , and Makemake, have been discovered; in particular, Eris is almost the same size as Pluto.

The discovery of Ixion was formally announced by the Minor Planet Center in a Minor Planet Electronic Circular on 1 July 2001. It was given the provisional designation , indicating that it was discovered in the second half of May 2001. Ixion was the 1,923rd object discovered in the latter half of May, as indicated by the last letter and numbers in its provisional designation.

At the time of discovery, Ixion was thought to be among the largest trans-Neptunian objects in the Solar System, as implied by its high intrinsic brightness. These characteristics of Ixion prompted follow-up observations in order to ascertain its orbit, which would in turn improve the certainty of later size estimates of Ixion. In August 2001, a team of astronomers used the European Southern Observatory&#x27;s Astrovirtel virtual observatory to automatically scan through archival precovery photographs obtained from various observatories. The team obtained nine precovery images of Ixion, with the earliest taken by the Siding Spring Observatory on 17 July 1982. These precovery images along with subsequent follow-up observations with the La Silla Observatory&#x27;s 2.2-meter MPG/ESO telescope in 2001 extended Ixion&#x27;s observation arc by over 18 years, sufficient for its orbit to be accurately determined and eligible for numbering by the Minor Planet Center. Ixion was given the permanent minor planet number 28978 on 2 September 2001.

=== Name ===

This minor planet is named after the Greek mythological figure Ixion, in accordance with the International Astronomical Union&#x27;s (IAU&#x27;s) naming convention which requires plutinos (objects in a 3:2 orbital resonance with Neptune) to be named after mythological figures associated with the underworld. In Greek mythology, Ixion was the king of the legendary Lapiths of Thessaly and had married Dia, a daughter of Deioneus (or Eioneus), whom Ixion promised to give valuable bridal gifts. Ixion invited Deioneus to a banquet but instead pushed him into a pitfall of burning coals and wood, killing Deioneus. Although the lesser gods despised his actions, Zeus pitied Ixion and invited him to a banquet with other gods. Rather than being grateful, Ixion became lustful towards Zeus&#x27;s wife, Hera. Zeus found out about his intentions and created the cloud Nephele in the shape of Hera, and tricked Ixion into coupling with it, fathering the race of Centaurs. For his crimes, Ixion was expelled from Olympus, blasted with a thunderbolt, and bound to a burning solar wheel in the underworld for all eternity.

The name for Ixion was suggested by E. K. Elliot, who was also involved in the naming of Kuiper belt object 38083 Rhadamanthus. The naming citation was published by the Minor Planet Center on 28 March 2002.

The usage of planetary symbols is discouraged in astronomy, so Ixion never received a symbol in the astronomical literature. There is no standard symbol for Ixion used by astrologers either. Sandy Turnbull proposed a symbol for Ixion (), which includes the initials I and X as well as depicts the solar wheel that Ixion was bound to in Tartarus. Denis Moskowitz, a software engineer in Massachusetts who designed the symbols for most of the dwarf planets, substitutes the Greek letter iota (Ι) and xi (Ξ) for I and X, creating a variant (). These symbols are occasionally mentioned on astrological websites, but are not used broadly.
== Orbit and rotation ==

Ixion is classified as a plutino, a large population of resonant trans-Neptunian objects in a 2:3 mean-motion orbital resonance with Neptune. Thus, Ixion completes two orbits around the Sun for every three orbits that Neptune takes. At the time of Ixion&#x27;s discovery, it was initially thought to be in a 3:4 orbital resonance with Neptune, which would have made Ixion closer to the Sun. Ixion orbits the Sun at an average distance of , taking 251 years to complete a full orbit. This is characteristic of all plutinos, which have orbital periods around 250 years and semi-major axes around 39 AU.

Like Pluto, Ixion&#x27;s orbit is elongated and inclined to the ecliptic. Ixion has an orbital eccentricity of 0.24 and an orbital inclination of 19.6 degrees, slightly greater than Pluto&#x27;s inclination of 17 degrees. Over the course of its orbit, Ixion&#x27;s distance from the Sun varies from 30 AU at perihelion (closest distance) to 49.6 AU at aphelion (farthest distance). Although Ixion&#x27;s orbit is similar to that of Pluto, their orbits are oriented differently: Ixion&#x27;s perihelion is below the ecliptic whereas Pluto&#x27;s is above it (see right image). , Ixion is approximately 39 AU from the Sun and is currently moving closer, approaching perihelion by 2070. Simulations by the Deep Ecliptic Survey show that Ixion can acquire a perihelion distance (&quot;qmin&quot;) as small as 27.5 AU over the next 10 million years.

The rotation period of Ixion is uncertain; various photometric measurements suggest that it displays very little variation in brightness, with a small light curve amplitude of less than 0.15 magnitudes. Initial attempts to determine Ixion&#x27;s rotation period were conducted by astronomer Ortiz and colleagues in 2001 but yielded inconclusive results. Although their short-term photometric data was insufficient for Ixion&#x27;s rotation period to be determined based on its brightness variations, they were able to constrain Ixion&#x27;s light curve amplitude below 0.15 magnitudes. Astronomers Sheppard and Jewitt obtained similarly inconclusive results in 2003 and provided an amplitude constraint less than 0.05 magnitudes, considerably less than Ortiz&#x27;s amplitude constraint. In 2010, astronomers Rousselot and Petit observed Ixion with the European Southern Observatory&#x27;s New Technology Telescope and determined Ixion&#x27;s rotation period to be hours, with a light curve amplitude around 0.06 magnitudes. Galiazzo and colleagues obtained a shorter rotation period of hours in 2016, though they calculated that there is a 1.2% probability that their result may be erroneous.

== Physical characteristics ==
=== Size and brightness ===

Ixion has a measured diameter of , with an optical absolute magnitude of 3.77 and a geometric albedo (reflectivity) of 0.11. Compared to Pluto and its moon Charon, Ixion is less than one-third the diameter of Pluto and three-fifths the diameter of Charon. Ixion is the fourth-largest known plutino that has a well-constrained diameter, preceding , , and Pluto. It was the intrinsically brightest object discovered by the Deep Ecliptic Survey and is among the twenty brightest trans-Neptunian objects known according to astronomer Michael Brown and the Minor Planet Center.

Ixion was the largest and brightest Kuiper belt object found when it was discovered. Under the assumption of a low albedo, it was presumed to have a diameter around , which would have made it larger than the dwarf planet and comparable in size to Charon. Subsequent observations of Ixion with the La Silla Observatory&#x27;s MPG/ESO telescope along with the European Southern Observatory&#x27;s Astrovirtel in August 2001 concluded a similar size around , though under the former assumption of a low albedo.

In 2002, astronomers of the Max Planck Institute for Radio Astronomy measured Ixion&#x27;s thermal emission at millimeter wavelengths with the IRAM 30m telescope and obtained an albedo of 0.09, corresponding to a diameter of , consistent with previous assumptions of Ixion&#x27;s size and albedo. They later reevaluated their results in 2003 and realized that their detection of Ixion&#x27;s thermal emission was spurious; follow-up observations with the IRAM telescope did not detect any thermal emission within the millimeter range at frequencies of 250 GHz, implying a high albedo and consequently a smaller size for Ixion. The lower limit for Ixion&#x27;s albedo was constrained at 0.15, suggesting that Ixion&#x27;s diameter did not exceed .

With space-based telescopes such as the Spitzer Space Telescope, astronomers were able to more accurately measure Ixion&#x27;s thermal emissions, allowing for more accurate estimates of its albedo and size. Preliminary thermal measurements with Spitzer in 2005 yielded a much higher albedo constraint of 0.25–0.50, corresponding to a diameter range of . Further Spitzer thermal measurements at multiple wavelength ranges (bands) in 2007 yielded mean diameter estimates around and for a single-band and two-band solution for the data, respectively. From these results, the adopted mean diameter was (), just beyond Spitzer&#x27;s 2005 diameter constraint albeit having a large margin of error. Ixion&#x27;s diameter was later revised to , based on multi-band thermal observations by the Herschel Space Observatory along with Spitzer in 2013.

On 13 October 2020, Ixion occulted a 10th magnitude red giant star (star Gaia DR2 4056440205544338944), blocking out its light for a duration of approximately 45 seconds. The stellar occultation was observed by astronomers from seven different sites across the western United States. Of the ten participating observers, eight of them reported positive detections of the occultation. Observers from the Lowell Observatory provided highly precise measurements of the occultation chord timing, allowing for tight constraints to Ixion&#x27;s diameter and possible atmosphere. An elliptical fit for Ixion&#x27;s occultation profile gives projected dimensions of approximately , corresponding to a projected spherical diameter of . The precise Lowell Observatory chords place an upper limit surface pressure of &lt;2 microbars for any possible atmosphere of Ixion.

==== Possible dwarf planet ====
Astronomer Gonzalo Tancredi considers Ixion as a likely candidate as it has a diameter greater than , the estimated minimum size for an object to achieve hydrostatic equilibrium, under the assumption of a predominantly icy composition. Ixion also displays a light curve amplitude less than 0.15 magnitudes, indicative of a likely spheroidal shape, hence why Tancredi considered Ixion as a likely dwarf planet. American astronomer Michael Brown considers Ixion to highly likely be a dwarf planet, placing it at the lower end of the &quot;highly likely&quot; range. However, in 2019, astronomer William Grundy and colleagues proposed that trans-Neptunian objects similar in size to Ixion, around in diameter, have not collapsed into solid bodies and are thus transitional between smaller, porous (and thus low-density) bodies and larger, denser, brighter and geologically differentiated planetary bodies such as dwarf planets. Ixion is situated within this size range, suggesting that it is at most only partially differentiated, with a porous internal structure. While Ixion&#x27;s interior may have collapsed gravitationally, its surface remained uncompressed, implying that Ixion might not be in hydrostatic equilibrium and thus not a dwarf planet. However, this notion for Ixion cannot currently be tested: the object is not currently known to have any natural satellites, and thus Ixion&#x27;s mass and density cannot currently be measured. Only two attempts with the Hubble Space Telescope have been made to find a satellite within an angular distance of 0.5 arcseconds from Ixion, and it has been suggested that there is a chance as high as 0.5% that a satellite may have been missed in these searches.

=== Spectra and surface ===

The surface of Ixion is very dark and unevolved, resembling those of smaller, primitive Kuiper belt objects such as Arrokoth. In the visible spectrum, Ixion appears moderately red in color, similar to the large Kuiper belt object . Ixion&#x27;s reflectance spectrum displays a red spectral slope that extends from wavelengths of 0.4 to 0.95 μm, in which it reflects more light at these wavelengths. Longward of 0.85 μm, Ixion&#x27;s spectrum becomes flat and featureless, especially at near-infrared wavelengths. In the near-infrared, Ixion&#x27;s reflectance spectrum appears neutral in color and lacks apparent absorption signatures of water ice at wavelengths of 1.5 and 2 μm. Although water ice appears to be absent in Ixion&#x27;s near-infrared spectrum, Barkume and colleagues have reported a detection of weak absorption signatures of water ice in Ixion&#x27;s near-infrared spectrum in 2007. Ixion&#x27;s featureless near-infrared spectrum indicates that its surface is covered with a thick layer of dark organic compounds irradiated by solar radiation and cosmic rays.

The red color of Ixion&#x27;s surface originates from the irradiation of water- and organic-containing clathrates by solar radiation and cosmic rays, which produces dark, reddish heteropolymers called tholins that cover its surface. The production of tholins on Ixion&#x27;s surface is responsible for Ixion&#x27;s red, featureless spectrum as well as its low surface albedo. Ixion&#x27;s neutral near-infrared color and apparent lack of water ice indicates that it has a thick layer of tholins covering its surface, suggesting that Ixion has undergone long-term irradiation and has not experienced resurfacing by impact events that may otherwise expose water ice underneath. While Ixion is generally known to have a red color, visible and near-infrared observations by the Very Large Telescope (VLT) in 2006 and 2007 paradoxically found a bluer color. This discrepancy was concluded to be an indication of heterogeneities across its surface, which may also explain the conflicting detections of water ice in various studies.
In 2003, VLT observations tentatively resolved a weak absorption feature at 0.8 μm in Ixion&#x27;s spectrum, which could possibly be attributed to surface materials aqueously altered by water. However, it was not confirmed in a follow-up study by Boehnhardt and colleagues in 2004, concluding that the discrepancy between the 2003 and 2004 spectroscopic results may be the result of Ixion&#x27;s heterogenous surface. In that same study, their results from photometric and polarimetric observations suggest that Ixion&#x27;s surface consists of a mixture of mostly dark material and a smaller proportion of brighter, icy material. Boehnhardt and colleagues suggested a mixing ratio of 6:1 for dark and bright material as a best-fit model for a geometric albedo of 0.08. Based on combined visible and infrared spectroscopic results, they suggested that Ixion&#x27;s surface consists of a mixture largely of amorphous carbon and tholins, with the following best-fit model of Ixion&#x27;s surface composition: 65% amorphous carbon, 20% cometary ice tholins (ice tholin II), 13% nitrogen and methane-rich Titan tholins, and 2% water ice.

In 2005, astronomers Lorin and Rousselot observed Ixion with the VLT in attempt to search for evidence of cometary activity. They did not detect a coma around Ixion, placing an upper limit of for Ixion&#x27;s dust production rate.

== Exploration ==
The &quot;New Horizons&quot; spacecraft, which successfully flew by Pluto in 2015, observed Ixion from afar using its long range imager on 13 and 14 July 2016. The spacecraft detected Ixion at magnitude 20.2 from a range of , and was able to observe it from a high phase angle of 64 degrees, enabling the determination of the light scattering properties and photometric phase curve behavior of its surface.

In a study published by Ashley Gleaves and colleagues in 2012, Ixion was considered as a potential target for an orbiter mission concept, which would be launched on an Atlas V 551 or Delta IV HLV rocket. For an orbiter mission to Ixion, the spacecraft have a launch date in November 2039 and use a gravity assist from Jupiter, taking 20 to 25 years to arrive. Gleaves concluded that Ixion and were the most feasible targets for the orbiter, as the trajectories required the fewest maneuvers for orbital insertion around either. For a flyby mission to Ixion, planetary scientist Amanda Zangari calculated that a spacecraft could take just over 10 years to arrive at Ixion using a Jupiter gravity assist, based on a launch date of 2027 or 2032. Ixion would be approximately 31 to 35 AU from the Sun when the spacecraft arrives. Alternatively, a flyby mission with a later launch date of 2040 would also take just over 10 years, using a Jupiter gravity assist. By the time the spacecraft arrives in 2050, Ixion would be approximately 31 to 32 AU from the Sun. Other trajectories using gravity assists from Jupiter or Saturn have been also considered. A trajectory using gravity assists from Jupiter and Saturn could take under 22 years, based a launch date of 2035 or 2040, whereas a trajectory using one gravity assist from Saturn could take at least 19 years, based on a launch date of 2038 or 2040. Using these alternative trajectories for the spacecraft, Ixion would be approximately 30 AU from the Sun when the spacecraft arrives.

<doc id="358093" wikidata="Q81515" url="?curid=358093" title="Great horned owl">
<text>The great horned owl (Bubo virginianus), also known as the tiger owl (originally derived from early naturalists&#x27; description as the &quot;winged tiger&quot; or &quot;tiger of the air&quot;) or the hoot owl, is a large owl native to the Americas. It is an extremely adaptable bird with a vast range and is the most widely distributed true owl in the Americas. Its primary diet is rabbits and hares, rats and mice, and voles, although it freely hunts any animal it can overtake, including rodents and other small mammals, larger mid-sized mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, and invertebrates. 

In ornithological study, the great horned owl is often compared to the Eurasian eagle-owl (&quot;Bubo bubo&quot;), a closely related species, which occupies the same ecological niche in Eurasia despite its notably larger size. The great horned owl is also compared to the red-tailed hawk (&quot;Buteo jamaicensis&quot;), with which it often shares similar habitat, prey, and nesting habits by day; thus the red-tailed hawk is something of a diurnal ecological equivalent. The great horned owl is one of the earliest nesting birds in North America, often laying eggs weeks or even months before other raptorial birds.

==Taxonomy==
The great horned owl was formally described in 1788 by the German naturalist Johann Friedrich Gmelin in his revised and expanded edition of Carl Linnaeus&#x27;s &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;. He placed it with the other owls in the genus &quot;Strix&quot; and coined the binomial name &quot;Strix virginia&quot;. Gmelin based his description on that of English naturalist George Edwards who had described and illustrated the great horned owl in 1747 in the second volume of his &quot;A Natural History of Uncommon Birds&quot;. Edwards had seen a live specimen from Virginia at the house of the Earl of Burlington in Chiswick. Edwards also owned a preserved specimen, and another specimen formed part of the Leverian collection. The great horned owl is now placed in the genus &quot;Bubo&quot; that was introduced in 1805 by André Duméril.

The great horned owl represents one of the one or two radiations of the genus across the Bering land bridge to the Americas. Whereas the lesser horned owl clearly divided once the owl had spread through the Americas, the consensus seems to be that the snowy owl and the great horned owl divided back in Eurasia and the snowy then spread back over the Arctic through northernmost North America separately from the radiation of the greater and lesser horned owls. One older study suggested that great horned and Eurasian eagle-owls may be conspecific, based on similarities in life history, geographic distribution, and appearance, though this is not supported by genetic evidence, which places them in separate clades of their genus. Genetic testing indicates that the lesser horned owl, and then the snowy owl, not the Eurasian eagle-owl, are the most closely related living species. Pleistocene era fossils have been found of &quot;Bubo&quot; owls in North America, which may either be distinct species or paleosubspecies, from as far east as Georgia, but predominantly in the Rocky Mountains and to the west of them. Almost all fossils indicate these owls were larger than modern great horned owls.

A large number of subspecies, more than 20 altogether, have been named. However, many of these are not true subspecies and only examples of individual or clinal variation. Subspecies differences are mainly in color and size and generally follow Gloger&#x27;s and Bergmann&#x27;s rules: The most conservative treatments of great horned owl subspecies may describe as few as 10, although an intermediate number is typical in most writings.

Fifteen subspecies are currently recognised:
* &quot;B. v. algistus&quot; (Oberholser, 1904) – west Alaska
* &quot;B. v. lagophonus&quot; (Oberholser, 1904) – central Alaska to northeast Oregon, Idaho and northwest Montana (US)
* &quot;B. v. saturatus&quot; Ridgway, 1877 – coastal southeast Alaska to coastal north California (US)
* &quot;B. v. pacificus&quot; Cassin, 1854 – coastal central California (US) to northwest Baja California (Mexico)
* &quot;B. v. subarcticus&quot; Hoy, PR, 1853 – central west Canada to north Idaho (US)
* &quot;B. v. pallescens&quot; Stone, 1897 – southwest US to south Mexico
* &quot;B. v. pinorum&quot; Dickerman &amp; Johnson, AB, 2008 – south Idaho to north Arizona and north New Mexico (US)
* &quot;B. v. heterocnemis&quot; (Oberholser, 1904) – northeast Canada to the Great Lakes region
* &quot;B. v. virginianus&quot; (Gmelin, JF, 1788) – southeast Canada to central, east US
* &quot;B. v. elachistus&quot; Brewster, 1902 – south Baja California (Mexico)
* &quot;B. v. mayensis&quot; Nelson, 1901 – Yucatán Peninsula (southeast Mexico)
* &quot;B. v. mesembrinus&quot; (Oberholser, 1904) – south Mexico to west Panama
* &quot;B. v. nigrescens&quot; Berlepsch, 1884 – Colombia to northwest Peru
* &quot;B. v. nacurutu&quot; (Vieillot, 1817) – east Colombia through the Guianas to north, east Brazil, Argentina, Bolivia and central Peru
* &quot;B. v. deserti&quot; Reiser, 1905 – northeast Brazil (central north Bahia)

==Description==
The great horned owl is generally colored for camouflage. The underparts of the species are usually light with some brown horizontal barring; the upper parts and upper wings are generally a mottled brown usually bearing heavy, complex, darker markings. All subspecies are darkly barred to some extent along the sides. 

A variable-sized white patch is seen on the throat. The white throat may continue as a streak running down the middle of the breast even when the birds are not displaying, which in particularly pale individuals can widen at the belly into a large white area. South American great horned owls typically have a smaller white throat patch, often unseen unless actively displaying, and rarely display the white area on the chest. 

Individual and regional variations in overall color occur, with birds from the subarctic showing a washed-out, light-buff color, while those from the Pacific Coast of North America, Central America, and much of South America can be a dark brownish color overlaid with blackish blotching. The skin of the feet and legs, though almost entirely obscured by feathers, is black. Even tropical great horned owls have feathered legs and feet. The feathers on the feet of the great horned owl are the second-longest known in any owl (after the snowy owl). The bill is dark gunmetal-gray, as are the talons.

All great horned owls have a facial disc. This can be reddish, brown, or gray in color (depending on geographical and racial variation) and is demarked by a dark rim culminating in bold, blackish side brackets. This species&#x27; eyebrow-like &quot;horns&quot; are tufts of feathers, called plumicorns. The purpose of plumicorns is not fully understood, but the hypothesis that they serve as a visual cue in territorial and sociosexual interactions with other owls is generally accepted.

===Physiology and measurements===

The great horned owl is the heaviest extant owl in Central and South America and is the second-heaviest owl in North America, after the closely related but very different-looking snowy owl. It is heavily built, with a barrel-shaped body, a large head, and broad wings. Its size can vary considerably across its range, with populations in interior Alaska and Ontario being largest and populations in California and Texas being smallest, though those from the Yucatán Peninsula and Baja California appear to be even smaller. Adult great horned owls range in length from , with an average of , and possess a wingspan of , with an average of . Females are somewhat larger than males. Mean body weight is for females and for males. Depending on subspecies, maximum weight can reach .

The wing chord length is . The wing loading, the measured wing area compared to weight, is high, meaning the wings are relatively small in surface area for the bird&#x27;s weight; the species&#x27; wing loading has been described as proportionately the highest among raptors. The tail, being relatively short as is typical of most owls, is long. Like other owl species, the great horned owl is capable of &quot;silent flight&quot;, which is the way owls fly while making almost no discernable noise, despite their large size. 
This is made possible thanks to three main components of the owl&#x27;s wing structure. The leading edge of their feathers have serrations that help to disrupt the turbulence generated by wing flapping, then the softer feathers help deaden the sound, and finally the trailing fringe of the feathers works to finish cutting the sounds made by flight. The structure of the great horned owl wing also allows it to fly at a very low speed for the size of the species, as slow as 2 miles per hour when they are gliding on breezes.

The legs, feet, and talons are large and powerful. Tarsal length is . The average foot span of a fully spread foot, from talon to talon, is around , as compared to in long-eared owls, in barn owls, and in the great grey owl. Great horned owls can apply at least of crushing power in their talons, a pressure considerably greater than the human hand is capable of exerting. In some big females, the gripping power of the great horned owl may be comparable to much larger raptor species such as the golden eagle.

The hard, inflexible bill of the great horned owl is long, although the culmen, the exposed bill portion as measured along the top of the beak, is only .

The outer ear openings, which are concealed by feathers on the sides of the head, are relatively smaller than those of the Eurasian eagle owl, being in vertical axis, with the left ear slightly larger than the right. Like most exclusively (or near exclusively) nocturnal species, the great horned owl has asymmetrical ear holes that allow for the triangulation of sounds when hunting in the dark. The different-height holes, while still close together, are differentiated enough that the owl is able to use the timing and direction of the sound waves hitting each hole to precisely locate prey even if the prey is located under cover such as snow. The disc-like shape of their faces also helps to direct the sounds they hear toward their ears. While the true nature/purpose of the ear tufts that are present on the great horned owl is unknown, researchers agree that the tufts do not play any role in the hearing ability of the owl. It is estimated that their hearing is up to ten times that of a human being.

The great horned owl&#x27;s eyes, just slightly smaller than the eyes of a human being, are large even for an owl and rank proportionately among the largest eyes of all terrestrial vertebrates. The great horned owl has cylindrical eyes which creates more distance from the lens of the eye to the retina, which allows it to act more like a telephoto lens for farther distance sight compared to that possible from round eyes. They are visually highly adapted for nocturnal hunting and provide a wide, almost completely binocular field of view, a large corneal surface and a predominantly rod retina. 

The great horned owl&#x27;s eye contains both rods and cones like most species that see in color, but the vision of a great horned owl closely resembles that of many other nocturnal species. The peak wavelengths that are observed by the cones is 555 nm and the research suggests that the great horned owl has relatively weak color vision, especially compared to other bird species. Despite (or perhaps as a result of) the poorer sense of color vision, the owl manages to have excellent night vision. Instead of turning its eyes, an owl must turn its whole head, and the great horned owl can rotate its neck 270°. The iris is yellow, except in the amber-eyed South American great horned owl (&quot;B. v. nacurutu&quot;).

===Calls===

The great horned owl&#x27;s song is normally a low-pitched but loud (or also transcribed as , or , , ) and can last for four or five syllables. The call is resonant and has warranted descriptions as varied as &quot;solemn&quot; and &quot;terrifying&quot;. The female&#x27;s call is higher and rises in pitch at the end of the call. Female vocalizations are higher in pitch because of a smaller syrinx in the larger sex. Calling seems to peak after rather than before midnight. Usually, territorial hooting decreases in February or March at the onset of egg laying. 

On occasion, this species exhibits &quot;an indescribable assemblage of hoots, chuckles, screeches, and squawks, given so rapidly and disconnectedly that the effect is both startling and amusing&quot;. Descriptions of some of these odd sounds including a growling note pair, a laughing , a high-pitched ; a weak, soft , a cat-like , a hawk-like note of , and a nighthawk-like . These vocalizations may be variously uttered when the birds are disturbed and angered at the nest (frequently preceding an attack on an interloping human or other animal), represent the vocal development of young owls, or are given during courtship and during territorial disputes with other owls. Young owls still in the care of their parents make loud, persistent hissing or loud, piercing screeching sounds that are often confused with the calls of the barn owl.

===Subspecies===
Common/eastern great horned owl (&quot;Bubo virginianus virginianus&quot;)
:Eastern United States eastwards from at least as far west as Minnesota to Texas; northeastwards in distribution to southern Quebec, southern Ontario, Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island. Resident all-year. The race &quot;B. v. mesembrinus&quot; from Central America south of the Isthmus of Tehuantepec, may be merely a southerly leg of this race, as its coloring is almost exactly the same as &quot;virginianus&quot;, although with rather smaller body size. However, &quot;mesembrinus&quot; type owls are discontinuous in range, with only paler owls from &quot;pallescens&quot; and &quot;mayensis&quot; found in the in-between range before the northern &quot;virginianus&quot; reappears back up in South Texas.
:The &quot;nominate race&quot; is a medium-hued form, neither darkly saturated nor strikingly pale. Darker gray or somewhat paler individuals are known. It tends to be richly tinged with rufous and barred distinctly blackish-brown below with rather soft contrast. The feet can range from tawny to buff to creamy and are the legs are typically barred dark to a moderate extent. The facial disc is often a solid cinnamon-red color. This is mid-to-large race, with a wing chord length of , averaging , in males and , averaging , in females. Unexpectedly, although it is not the longest-winged, the nominate is the heaviest known race as males weigh from , averaging , and females weigh from , averaging ; the prior figures originally from a huge sample around Michigan. In comparison, &quot;B. v. subarcticus&quot;, though averaging longer in wing length averages somewhat less heavy. On the contrary, in Costa Rica, within the range of the possibly synonymous &quot;mesembrinus&quot;, great horned owls average approximately , the lightest average mass reported anywhere for this species. Other standard measurements of this race are a tail length of , a tarsus length of about and a bill length of . &quot;B. v. virginianus&quot; also tends to have relatively the longest ear tufts on any race.
South American great horned owl (&quot;Bubo virginianus nacurutu&quot;)

:Originally named as a separate species &quot;Strix nacurutu&quot;, A lowland form occurring in disjunct populations from eastern Colombia to the Guyanas; also from Brazil and Uruguay south of the Amazon Basin to Bolivia, the Buenos Aires Province in northern Argentina and western Paraguay; resident all-year. Includes the proposed subspecies &quot;scotinus&quot;, &quot;elutus&quot;, and &quot;deserti&quot;. The status of this form, especially the relationships between the scattered subpopulations and with ssp. &quot;nigrescens&quot; and the Magellanic horned owl, deserves more study.
:Dull, earthy brownish color is typical; birds from the semiarid interior of Brazil often have much white on uppertail- and ear-coverts against a dull gray background (sometimes separated as &quot;deserti&quot;). This race is less fuscous than &quot;nigrescens&quot;. It is the only subspecies where the iris is amber, not yellow. The Magellanic horned owl, while somewhat similar in coloring, has yellow eyes like other horned owls, not amber eyes. &quot;B. v. nacurutu&quot; is a medium-sized race, smaller than most in North America but not as small as some of the Mexican races. The wing chord length is in males and in females. The tail in both sexes can range from . Only three birds have had published weights, two males scaling and one female weighing . The most notable feature of this race is its large bill, at , which is the biggest of any horned owl race despite the otherwise moderate size of &quot;B. v. nacurutu&quot;.
Northern/sub-Arctic great horned owl (&quot;Bubo virginianus subarcticus&quot;)

:Breeding range from Mackenzie, British Columbia region east to the southern Hudson Bay; southern limit unclear but at least reaches to Montana and North Dakota. Non-breeding birds are regularly found south to latitude 45°S, i.e. Wyoming or South Dakota, occasionally ranging beyond this limit especially in years with low prey in the north. This race includes the birds described as &quot;occidentalis&quot; (based on a wintering individual, as was the original &quot;subarcticus&quot;) and &quot;sclariventris&quot;. The older name &quot;wapacuthu&quot; was occasionally used for this subspecies, but it cannot with certainty be assigned to a recognizable taxon and is thus considered a &quot;nomen dubium&quot;. The population described as &quot;algistus&quot; is probably based on wandering individuals and/or various intergrades of &quot;subarcticus&quot; with other races.
:This is the palest form of horned owl, with the ground color essentially whitish with a faint buff tinge above; black underside barring variable from indistinct to pronounced, being most often prominent on the upper chest amongst otherwise pale plumage. This race shows little to no reddish coloration. &quot;B. v. subarcticus&quot; shows a very high degree of clinal variation, ranging from in the Contiguous United States where owls are often medium-grayish and more heavily marked to the subarctic zone in Canada where very pale birds with almost non-existent markings are prominent. Very pale birds are similar to a young female snowy owl from a distance. In this race, the feet range from immaculate white to buff, with little or no mottling. In the west of Canada, &quot;subarcticus&quot; may hybridize with the dark &quot;saturatus&quot; and may do the same with this similarly dark &quot;heterocnemis&quot; in the east. In both cases, they may produce intermediate looking hybrids of reddish tone, like a &quot;virginianus&quot; but with sharper contrasting of colors. This is one of the largest-bodied subspecies. The wing chord length is , averaging , in males and , averaging , in females. Body mass ranges from , averaging , in males and from , averaging , in females. Tail length is and in males and females, respectively. Bill length is in both and one bird had a tarsus of .
California great horned owl (&quot;Bubo virginianus pacificus&quot;)

:Central and southern California west of the Sierra Nevada except for the San Joaquin Valley, south to Northwestern Baja California, Mexico. Intergrades with &quot;pallescens&quot; in San Diego County, California (see also below). Resident all-year.
:Very rich brown, dark underside barring distinct, less pronounced than in &quot;saturatus&quot; but more pronounced than in &quot;pallescens&quot;. Humeral area is black. Feet are mottled dark. The facial disc is often even darkly mottled. This is a fairly small-bodied race, in fact including the lightest wild great horned owl adult ever weighed. The wing chord length is , averaging , in males and , averaging , in females. Body mass ranges from , averaging , in males and from , averaging , in females. Tail length is and in males and females, respectively. Bill length is and one bird had a tarsus of .
Coastal great horned owl (&quot;Bubo virginianus saturatus&quot;)

:Pacific coast from southeastern Alaska to northern California. Includes the previously described form of &quot;B. v. leucomelas&quot;. The often-recognized race &quot;B. v. lagophonus&quot; is often now considered a mere clinal variation of the same race from interior Alaska to Oregon, the Snake River, and northwestern Montana. These forms may be reported in winter as far south as Colorado and Texas, but these are in times of irruption.
:A dark and overall brownish form with heavily barred and mottled underside, with a dull tawny base. Inland birds (&quot;lagophonus&quot;) tend to have a more grayish base, the coastal owls being more richly brown. Otherwise, inland and coastal owls are practically the same. The facial disc can range from gray to reddish-gray to dark rufous. The feet are fairly dusky gray typically, although some buff-footed individuals are known, and legs are more prominently barred with black than in other North American races. This is a large race going on linear measurements, which in Alaskan owls outmatch those of all other races but for &quot;heterocnemis&quot; in Ontario (which may itself be a discontinuous eastern wing of this race). The wing chord length is , averaging , in males and , averaging , in females. Tail length is and in males and females. In both sexes, known bill and tarsal lengths are and . No weights are known to have been published.
North Andean great horned owl (&quot;Bubo virginianus nigrescens&quot;)
:Andes; arid temperate and puna zones from Colombia to northwestern Peru. Resident all-year round. Presumably synonymous with the described &quot;columbianus&quot;.
:A dark, cold gray-brown form with heavy fuscous blotching. Arguably this is the darkest colored race on average, though it could be rivaled by individuals from &quot;saturatus&quot; and &quot;elachistus&quot;. This race has only minimally the rufous tinge seen in other darkish races, although some &quot;nigrescens&quot; may have a cinnamon facial disc. The largest winged race of owl in South America, this owl has a wing chord length of in males and in females. The tail in both sexes can range from . Bill length is , again relatively long as in &quot;nacurutu&quot; and one bird had a tarsal length of , indicating relatively long legs in the race. No published weights are known. Apparently, despite its sizeable wing area, &quot;nigrescens&quot; is notably smaller overall when specimens are compared side-by-side with those from &quot;saturatus&quot;.
Desert great horned owl (&quot;Bubo virginianus pallescens&quot;)
:San Joaquin Valley southeastwards through arid regions of southeastern California and southern Utah eastwards to western Kansas and southwards to Guerrero and western Veracruz in Mexico; intergrades with &quot;pacificus&quot; in San Diego County, if not elsewhere; vagrant individuals of &quot;saturatus&quot; and the Rocky Mountains population, which look similar to intergrades, also seem to occur in its range. Resident all-year. This race is likely synonymous with &quot;melanocercus&quot;.
:A pale dusky buff form with indistinct barring, especially on the underside. Darker individuals tend to have a deeper fulvous base to their upper sides. Humeral area is umber in color and the feathers of the feet are white and usually unmarked. A small race, it averages slightly larger in wing length than &quot;pacificus&quot; but weighs less on average. The wing chord length is , averaging , in males and , averaging , in females. Body mass ranges from , averaging , in males and from , averaging , in females. In both sexes, tail length is and bill length is .
Yucatán great horned owl (&quot;Bubo virginianus mayensis&quot;)
:Endemic to the southern two-thirds of the Yucatán Peninsula. Resident all-year.
:A medium-pale form, fairly similar to &quot;pallescens&quot; in both hue and ventral markings. Going on linear measurements, &quot;B. v. mayensis&quot; is smaller than all North American horned owls, even the smallish &quot;pallescens&quot;, and is only slightly larger at median than the following race. This race has wing chord and tail lengths of and in males and and in females. In both sexes, the bill length is and tarsal length is .
Baja California great horned owl (&quot;Bubo virginianus elachistus&quot;) 
:Southern Baja California, Mexico. Resident all-year.
:Similar in color to &quot;pacificus&quot; but even darker and more heavily barred, like a miniaturized &quot;saturatus&quot;. It is considerably (5–10%) smaller than &quot;pacificus&quot; linearly; some size overlap does occur though. On average, it is the smallest known subspecies. Males have a wing chord length of , tail length of and bill length of . A single female had a wing chord of and tail of .
Northeastern great horned owl (&quot;Bubo virginianus heterocnemis&quot;)
:Breeds in eastern Canada (northern Quebec, Labrador, Newfoundland). Its southern breeding range seems to be delineated by the Saint Lawrence River. In winter, this race may disperses southwards throughout Ontario to as far as the Northeastern United States. This subspecies may be synonymous with &quot;saturatus&quot;, although it is distributed far to the east of that race. &quot;B. v. heterocnemis&quot; is surrounded by the much paler &quot;subarcticus&quot; to its west and quite differently marked &quot;virginianus&quot; to its south, the latter two overlap and possibly hybridize in some of the northeast.
:A fairly dark and grey, heavily barred form. Feet pale with dusky mottling. Going on median reported linear measurements (since body mass is unknown), this is the largest bodied subspecies on average. Males have a wing chord length of and females range from . In both sexes, the tail is and the bill is .
Rocky Mountains great horned owl (&quot;Bubo virginianus pinorum&quot;)
:The Rocky Mountains population breeds south of the Snake River in Idaho south to Arizona, New Mexico, and the Guadalupe Mountains of Texas. Westwards, it is presumed to occur to the Modoc Plateau and Mono Lake of California. This race was included in the presumed subspecies &quot;occidentalis&quot;, but was recently first described and named as a distinct subspecies and makes up the missing piece in the once-muddled distribution of great horned owls in the West and Rockies. Downslope movements into valleys occupied by &quot;pallescens&quot; might occur, but this needs study.
:A medium gray form, intermediate in coloring between &quot;saturatus&quot; and &quot;pallescens&quot;. Moderately barred and tinged buff or ochraceous on the underside. Feet mottled. This is a largish race, wing chord lengths being inexplicably greater in males, at , than in females, at . Tail length can range from and a female weighed .

===Species identification===

The combination of the species&#x27; bulk, prominent ear tufts and barred plumage distinguishes it through much of the range, but it may be easily confused with the lesser horned owl (&quot;B. magellanicus&quot;), which may overlap in range. The Magellanic horned owl was once considered a subspecies of the great horned, but is now almost universally considered a distinct species, as is supported by genetic materials, with the great horned being the paraspecies. Overall coloration is similar, but the Magellanic is markedly smaller with smaller feet and a smaller head, with finer, but more numerous brownish bars on the underside, rather than the blotchy, irregular barring typical of great horned owls. Other eagle-owls may superficially be somewhat similar, but the species is generically allopatric with the exception of wintering snowy owls. More tropical species with ear tufts, the stygian owl (&quot;A. stygius&quot;) and striped owl (&quot;A. clamator&quot;), are much smaller. Other large owls lack ear tufts.

==Distribution and habitat==

The breeding habitat of the great horned owl extends high into the subarctic of North America, where they are found up to the northwestern and southern Mackenzie Mountains, Keewatin, Ontario, northern Manitoba, Fort Chimo in Ungava, Okak, Newfoundland and Labrador, Anticosti Island and Prince Edward Island. They are distributed throughout most of North America and very spottily in Central America and then down into South America south to upland regions of Argentina, Bolivia and Peru, before they give way to the Magellanic horned owl, which thence ranges all the way to Tierra del Fuego, the southern tip of the continent. It is absent or rare from southern Guatemala, El Salvador, Nicaragua, and Costa Rica to Panama (where only two records) in Central America and the mangrove forests of northwestern South America. The species is also absent from the West Indies, the Haida Gwaii and almost all off-shore islands in the Americas, its ability to colonize islands apparently being considerably less than those of barn owls and short-eared owls. Since the division into two species, the great horned owl is the second most widely distributed owl in the Americas, just after the barn owl.

The great horned owl is among the world&#x27;s most adaptable owls or even bird species in terms of habitat. The great horned owl can take up residence in trees that border all manner of deciduous, coniferous, and mixed forests, tropical rainforests, pampas, prairie, mountainous areas, deserts, subarctic tundra, rocky coasts, mangrove swamp forests, and some urban areas. It is less common in the more extreme areas of the Americas. In the Mojave and Sonora Deserts, they are absent from the heart of the deserts and are only found on the vegetated or rocky fringes. Even in North America, they are rare in landscapes including more than 70% old-growth forest, such as the aspen forest of the Rockies. They have only been recorded a handful of times in true rainforests such as the Amazon rainforest. In the Appalachian Mountains, they appear to use old-growth forest but in Arkansas are actually often found near temporary agricultural openings in the midst of large areas of woodland. Similarly in south-central Pennsylvania, the owls use cropland and pasture more than deciduous and total forest cover, indicating preference for fragmented landscapes. In prairies, grasslands and deserts, they can successfully live year round as long as there are rocky canyons, steep gullies and/or wooded coulees with shade-giving trees to provide them shelter and nesting sites.

In mountainous areas of North America, they are usually absent above the tree line, but great horned owls can be found up to in California and in the Rockies. In the Andean Mountains, on the other hand, they have adapted to being a true montane species, often found at least above sea level and are regularly recorded in treeless Puna grassland zones at in Ecuador and Peru. They are generally rare in non-tidal wetland habitat, and are replaced in the high Arctic tundra by snowy owls. They prefer areas where open habitats, which they often hunt in, and woods, where they tend to roost and nest, are juxtaposed. Thus lightly populated rural regions can be ideal. This species can occasionally be found in urban or suburban areas. However, they seem to prefer areas with less human activity and are most likely to be found in park-like settings in such developed areas, unlike eastern and western screech owls (&quot;Megascops asio&quot; &amp; &quot;M. kennicottii&quot;) which may regularly occur in busy suburban settings. All mated great horned owls are permanent residents of their territories, but unmated and younger birds move freely in search of company and a territory, and leave regions with little food in winter.

==Behavior==
In most aspects of their behavior, great horned owls are typical of owls and most birds of prey. Like most owls, the great horned owl makes great use of secrecy and stealth. Due to its natural-colored plumage, it is well camouflaged both while active at night and while roosting during the day. During the daytime it roosts usually in large trees (including snags &amp; large hollows but usually thick branches) but may occasionally be in crevices or small caves in rocks or in dense shrubbery. Pine and other coniferous trees may be preferred where available since they are particularly dense and provide cover throughout the year. Typically, males have a favorite roosting site not far from the nest, sometimes used over successive years. While roosting, great horned owls may rest in the &quot;tall-thin&quot; position, where they sit as erect and hold themselves as slim as is possible. The kind of posture is well known as a further method of camouflage for other owls, like long-eared owls or great grey owls, especially if humans or other potential mammalian carnivores approach them. The Eurasian eagle owl rarely, if ever, assumes the tall-thin position.

Outside of the nesting season, great horned owls may roost wherever their foraging path ends at dawn. Generally great horned owls are active at night, although in some areas they may be active in the late afternoon or early morning. At dusk, the owl utters a few calls before flying to a more open sing-post, i.e. large bare branch or large rocks to deliver song. Normally several perches are used to mark occupied territory or to attract a female. Despite its camouflage and cryptic locations, this species can still sometimes be spotted on its daytime roosts, especially by American crows (&quot;Corvus brachyrhynchos&quot;). Since owls are, next to red-tailed hawks, perhaps the main predator of crows and their young, crows sometimes congregate from considerable distances to mob owls and caw angrily at them for hours on end. When the owls try to fly off to avoid this harassment, they are often followed by the corvids.

===Territoriality and movements===
Typically, great horned owls are highly sedentary, often capable of utilizing a single territory throughout their mature lives. Although some species such as snowy owls, northern saw-whet owls, long-eared and short-eared owls are true migrants, most North American owls are not migratory and will generally show fidelity to a single territory year around. In great horned owls, mated pairs occupy territories year-round and long-term. Territories are established and maintained through hooting, with highest activity before egg-laying and second peak in autumn when juveniles disperse, and can range from an average of in Yukon to an average of in Wyoming.

Most territorial defense is performed by males, but females frequently assist their partners in hooting contests with neighbors or intruders, even during incubation. On occasion, although territory borders may be successfully maintained via vocalizations alone without even seeing the competing owl, such confrontations may turn physical, with various levels of threats distinguished. The highest threat level involves the spreading of wings, bill-clapping, hissing, higher-pitched screams of longer duration, with general body poised to strike with its feet at intruder. If the intruder continues to press the confrontation, the defending owl will &quot;hop&quot; forward and strike it with feet, attempting to grasp and rake with claws.

Territoriality appears to place a limit on the number of breeding pairs in a given area. Individuals prevented from establishing a territory live a silent existence as &quot;floaters&quot;. Radio-telemetry revealed that such floaters concentrate along boundaries of established territories. At Kluane Lake in Yukon, incursions into neighboring territories were observed only twice—by females when a neighboring female had died or emigrated, suggesting that territorial defense may be sex-specific. At least four dead great horned owls in Kluane were apparently killed by others of their own species in territorial conflicts. Owls killed by other horned owls are sometimes cannibalized, although the origin of the killing may have been territorial aggression. Northern populations occasionally irrupt south during times of food shortage, but there is no annual migration even at the northern limits of the great horned owl&#x27;s range.

===Hunting behavior===
Hunting tends to peak between 8:30 pm and midnight and then can resume from 4:30 am to sunrise. Hunting tends to be most prolonged during winter by virtue of prey being more scarce. However, great horned owls can learn to target certain prey during daylight in the afternoon when it is more vulnerable, such as eastern fox squirrels (&quot;Sciurus niger&quot;) while they are building their leaf nests and chuckawallas (&quot;Sauromalus ater&quot;) sunning themselves on desert rocks. Owls hunt mainly by watching from a snag, pole or other high perch. During hunting forays, they often fly about from perch to perch, stopping to survey for food at each, until they sense a prey item below. From such vantage points, owls dive down to the ground, often with wings folded, to ambush their prey. Effective maximum hunting distance of an owl from an elevated perch is . Due to their short but broad wings, great horned owls are ideally suited for low speed and maneuverability.

Despite reports that they do not hunt on the wing, they also sometimes hunt by flying low over openings on the ground, scanning below for prey activity. Great horned owls can fly at speeds of more than in level flight. Hunting flights are slow, often quartering low above the ground where prey is likely to occur in open country or open woodland. Brief hovering flight (for about 6–18 seconds) has been described, especially in windy areas. On occasion owls may actually walk on the ground in pursuit of small prey or, rarely, inside a chicken coop to prey on the fowl within. Rodents and invertebrates may be caught on foot around the base of bushes, through grassy areas, and near culverts and other human structures in range and farm habitat. The great horned owl is generally a poor walker on the ground; it walks like a starling, with a pronounced side-to-side gait. They have been known to wade into shallow water for aquatic prey, although this has been only rarely reported. Owls can snatch birds and some arboreal mammals directly from tree branches in a glide as well. The stiff feathering of their wings allows owls to produce minimal sound in flight while hunting.

Almost all prey are killed by crushing with the owl&#x27;s feet or by incidentally stabbing of the talons, though some may be bitten about the face as well. Prey is swallowed whole when possible. When prey is swallowed whole, owls regurgitate pellets of bone and other non-digestible bits about 6 to 10 hours later, usually in the same location where the prey was consumed. Great horned owl pellets are dark gray or brown in color and very large, long and thick, and have been known to contain skulls up to in width inside them. However, not all prey can be swallowed at once, and owls will also fly with prey to a perch and tear off pieces with their bill. Most dietary studies focus on pellets found under perches and around nests, since they provide a more complete picture of the diversity of prey consumed, but prey remains outside of pellets may provide clues to prey excluded from the pellets and a combination of both is recommended.

Many large prey items are dismembered. Great horned owls may behead large prey before taking it to its nest or eating perch. The legs may also be removed, as may (in some bird prey) the wings. The great horned owl will also crush the bones of its prey to make it more compact for carrying. On occasion, the owls may return to the kill site to continue eating if the prey is too heavy to fly with after dismemberment. Many owls will accrue a cache of prey, especially those who are nesting. Caches must be at a safe location, usually the crotch of a tall tree. In northern regions, where large prey is prevalent, an owl may let uneaten food freeze and then thaw it out later using its own body heat. Hunting success seems to require fairly open understory, and experimental testing of microhabitat proved that open areas provided more hunting success on five species of rodent, with cloudy nights and denser bush foliage both decreasing success.

==Prey and trophic ecology==

Prey can vary greatly based on opportunity. According to one author, &quot;Almost any living creature that walks, crawls, flies, or swims, except the large mammals, is the great horned owl&#x27;s legitimate prey&quot;. In fact, the great horned owl has the most diverse prey profile of any raptor in the Americas. Over 500 species have been identified as great horned owl prey, with dozens more identified only to genus or general type (especially numerous invertebrates) and presumably several more unknown from their relatively little-studied populations in the Neotropics. Mammals (more than 200 species) and birds (nearly 300 species) make up the majority of their diet. Their diet in North America is made up of 87.6% mammals, 6.1% birds, 1.6% reptiles and amphibians with the remaining 4.7% being made up by insects, other assorted invertebrates and fish.

Estimated mass of individual prey for the owls has ranged from as little as to as much as Most prey is in the range of (shrews) to (jackrabbits). A single owl requires about of food per day and can subsist on a large kill over several days. Despite the great diversity of prey taken by these predators, in most of the continental United States from the East to the Midwest as well as Canada and Alaska, great horned owls largely live off just a handful of prey species: three species of lagomorph: the eastern cottontail (&quot;Sylvilagus floridanus&quot;), the snowshoe hare (&quot;Lepus americanus&quot;) and the black-tailed jackrabbit (&quot;Lepus californicus&quot;); two species of New World mice: the white-footed mouse and the North American deermouse (&quot;Peromyscus leucopus &amp; maniculatus&quot;); approximately three species of vole: the meadow, prairie and woodland voles (&quot;Microtus pennsylvanicus, ochrogaster &amp; pinetorum&quot;); and one introduced pest, the brown rat.

===Rodents===

Small rodents form the great majority of great horned owl prey by number. Weighing a mere and on average, the nine species of New World mice in &quot;Peromyscus&quot; and eight species voles in &quot;Microtus&quot; recorded in the diet would appear to be overly small to be as important as they are to a predatory bird of this size. The prominence of these genera is undoubtedly due to the abundance of both genera in the wooded edge habitats frequented by great horned owls. It is estimated that a family of owls with two offspring would need to take about a half dozen (voles) to a dozen (mice) of these rodents every night to satisfy their dietary requirements but apparently the accessibility and abundance of these foods is irresistible as their numeric dominance is indisputable. By winter in areas that hold heavy snow, &quot;Peromyscus&quot; mice often come to outnumber the voles in the diet since the mice tend to travel over the surface of the snow while the voles make tunnels underneath the snow. In fact, a healthy family of great horned owls can decimate a colony of field rats, thus potentially performing a key role in controlling a highly destructive pest. Great horned owls living in the timbered fringes of garbage or refuse dumps may subsist mostly on rats.

In the Rockies, California, the Southwestern United States and northern Mexico, the diversity of this species&#x27; diet rises, in sync with the diversity of rodents. Especially important, from Colorado to Washington state is the northern pocket gopher (&quot;Thomomys talpoides&quot;), although assorted other pocket gophers (&quot;Geomys, Cratogeomys, Zygogeomys, Pappogeomys&quot; and other &quot;Thomomys&quot; ssp.) are readily taken. While the northern weighs from , other pocket gophers hunted average from in mass. From Washington to Baja California a very important food is the pocket mice, primarily the Great Basin pocket mouse (&quot;Perognathus parvus&quot;). While the Great Basin species is a relative giant at , other hunted pocket mice (which may include both &quot;Perognathus&quot; and &quot;Chaetodipus&quot; ssp.) can average nearly as light as . In East Texas, the hispid cotton rat (&quot;Sigmodon hispidus&quot;) is the most commonly recorded prey species. The same species constituted 75% by number of a small sampling in Oklahoma. In semi-desert and other arid habitats, kangaroo rats become increasingly important prey, ten species have been reported in the diet but most prominently the Ord&#x27;s and Merriam&#x27;s kangaroo rats (&quot;Dipodomys ordii &amp; merriami&quot;), both being widespread, numerous and relatively diminutive (at ). Eight known larger species of kangaroo rats, including the giant kangaroo rat (&quot;Dipodomys ingens&quot;) averaging at , are also taken.

The squirrels, including ground squirrels, marmots (&quot;Marmota&quot;), prairie dogs (&quot;Cynomys&quot;), chipmunks and tree squirrels, are diurnal and so are largely unavailable to great horned owls as prey. Occasionally though, one will be caught from their leaf nest, nest hole or burrow entrance first thing in the morning or in the late afternoon and approximately 35 species have been successfully predated by these owls. In general larger sized than other rodent families, the species hunting range from the gray-collared chipmunk (&quot;Tamias cinereicollis&quot;) to the hoary marmot (&quot;Marmota caligata&quot;); thus, squirrels can provide a very fulfilling meal. An even larger rodent is sometimes attacked as prey by great horned owls, the North American porcupine (&quot;Erethizon dorsatum&quot;), in which average adults range from . This has been determined from owls who have porcupine quills imbedded in them, sometimes resulting in death. On occasion, they are successful in killing porcupine, even adults as determined by the size of the quills left behind and prey remains at bloodied kill sites. Other rodents recorded as secondary prey in North America include flying squirrels (&quot;Glaucomys&quot; ssp.), the golden mouse (&quot;Ochrotomys nuttalli&quot;), red-backed voles &amp; bog lemmings (&quot;Myodes&quot; &amp; &quot;Synaptomys&quot; ssp.), the muskrat (&quot;Ondatra zibethicus&quot;), the northern grasshopper mouse (&quot;Onychomys leucogaster&quot;), the northern pygmy mouse (&quot;Baiomys taylori&quot;) and jumping mice (&quot;Zapus&quot; &amp; &quot;Napaeozapus&quot; ssp.).

===Lagomorphs===
Although generally no match for rodents in the sheer quantity of individuals, in terms of prey biomass, the most significant prey of North American great horned owls are hares and rabbits. About a dozen lagomorphs species are known to be hunted by the owl, from the relatively tiny pygmy rabbit to adult jackrabbits weighing more than . These species are overall the largest regular prey for this species.

In Utah, where great horned owls are dependent on the jackrabbits, average brood size rose from 2 at jackrabbit population lows to 3.3 when the jackrabbits were at their peak. At the peak of the population cycle, jackrabbits accounted for 90.2% and desert cottontails (&quot;Sylvilagus audubonii&quot;) for another 8.7% of prey biomass. In the short-grass prairie of Colorado, mountain cottontail (&quot;Sylvilagus nuttallii&quot;) and black-tailed jackrabbits predominated in October to December, making up 42.9% by number (and nearly all the biomass), thence dropping to 9.3% by number in April, while voles rose to 32.2% peak in May, down to a minimum of 10.2% by number in June. Further north in Colorado, in the absence of jackrabbits, the mountain cottontails falls to third place by number (12.9%) behind the northern pocket gopher (36.5%) and prairie vole (24.7%) but still dominates the biomass, making up about half. 

In central Utah, the lagomorphs (black-tailed jackrabbit/desert cottontail) and Ord&#x27;s kangaroo rat each made up 39% of the food by number, respectively. The mountain cottontail dominates the biomass of prey in the Sierran foothills of California, making up 61.1% of the biomass, although are numerically secondary to desert woodrat. Remarkably, in the Morley Nelson Snake River Birds of Prey National Conservation Area of Idaho, individual rodents (1159 counted) were more than 10 times more numerous than lagomorphs (114 counted) by quantity and yet the jackrabbit and mountain cottontail still made up approximately half of the biomass. The dependence on lagomorphs also extends into Mexico, as in Baja California about a quarter of identified prey was black-tailed jackrabbit and either desert or the larger Mexican cottontail (&quot;Sylvilagus cunicularius&quot;).

In the northern boreal forest, great horned owls are even more dependent on the snowshoe hare. At the peak of the 10-year hare cycle, snowshoe hares were by far the largest component of both summer and winter diets (77–81% and 90–99%, respectively, in Alberta; 83–86% and 75–98%, respectively, in Yukon). At the lowest point of the hare&#x27;s cycle, summer diets consisted of only 0–16% snowshoe hare in Alberta and 12.7% in Yukon. When hares were scarce, great horned owls in these regions fed mostly on large rodents, mice and voles, grouse and ducks. Because fewer of these alternative prey species are available in boreal forests during winter, owls had to emigrate or suffer high mortalities if they stayed. In Alberta, the local population of great horned owls can increase threefold from hare population lows to peaks. The dependency on the snowshoe hare by the great horned owl extends into Alaska as well.

===Other mammals===
Other mammals are taken readily as well. Several species of mammalian carnivore, such as ringtails (&quot;Bassariscus astutus&quot;), American minks (&quot;Neogale vison&quot;), American martens (&quot;Martes americana&quot;), black-footed ferret (&quot;Mustela nigripes&quot;) and various other small mustelids (&quot;Mustela&quot; ssp.), are sometimes taken as prey. In one case, a great horned owl was the likely killer of an adult female fisher (&quot;Martes pennanti&quot;), though young ones are typically taken. Prey in the form of canids, like foxes or coyotes (&quot;Canis latrans&quot;) are often juveniles presumably snatched from the mouths of dens by night. Kit and swift foxes of up to adult size may be taken.

The most regular predatory association amongst relatively larger carnivores is that with skunks. Due to their poor sense of smell, great horned owls are the only predators to routinely attack these bold mammals with impunity. All six skunk species found in North America are reported as prey, including full-grown striped skunks (&quot;Mephitis mephitis&quot;), which can be three times as heavy as the attacking owl. In one single nest, the remains of 57 striped skunks were found. Due to the proclivity of skunk predation, great horned owls nests frequently smell strongly of skunk and occasionally stink so powerfully of skunk that they leave the smell at kill sites or on prey remains. Surprisingly, at least two cases of a great horned owl preying on an adult raccoon (&quot;Procyon lotor&quot;) have been reported. One instance of an owl taking a bobcat (&quot;Lynx rufus&quot;) as prey was also reportedly observed. Occasionally, domestic carnivores are also prey. A few cases of young or small dogs (&quot;Canis lupus familiaris&quot;) and several of juvenile and adult cats (&quot;Felis silvestris catus&quot;) being killed by great horned owls have been reported.

Aside from carnivorans, various other mammals are taken as supplemental prey. At least eight species of shrews are taken by opportunity and make up the smallest mammalian prey taken by great horned owls, as specimens of least shrew (&quot;Cryptotis parva&quot;) or masked shrew (&quot;Sorex cinereus&quot;) have had an estimated weight of only . One of the more regularly taken shrews, though, is the larger northern short-tailed shrew (&quot;Blarina brevicauda&quot;), which was represented in more than 2% of pellets in the Upper Midwest. Moles, of at least four or five species, are also widely but lightly reported as prey. From both the tropics and the United States, several species of opossum may be taken, down to the size of the tiny dwarf fat-tailed mouse opossum (&quot;Thylamys velutinus&quot;). In Brazil, juvenile white-eared opossum (&quot;Didelphis albiventris&quot;) weighing around were found in 12% of pellets weighing about. North American subspecies can prey on larger Virginia opossum (&quot;Didelphis virginianus&quot;) readily, and can be a major predator of this species. Remnants of armadillo, presumably nine-banded armadillo (&quot;Dasypus novemcinctus&quot;), have been found around owl nests in the south. 11 species of bat are known to be hunted by great horned owls. One pellet in Texas was found to be composed entirely of Mexican free-tailed bats (&quot;Tadarida brasiliensis&quot;).

===Birds===

After mammals, birds rank as the next most important general prey group. Birds are usually considerably secondary in the diet but outnumber the mammals in the diet by diversity, as more than 250 species have been killed in North America alone. Statistically, the most significant avian prey seems to be galliforms, of which they are known to have preyed on 23 species, basically consisting of all of the native species found in the United States. In the Upper Midwest, the ring-necked pheasant (&quot;Phasianus colchicus&quot;) and northern bobwhite (&quot;Colinus virginianus&quot;) were the fifth and sixth (out of 124 identified species) most significant prey species in 4838 pellets. Errington characterized the predatory pressure exerted on bobwhites by great horned owls as &quot;light but continuous pressure&quot;, which may be considered characteristic of the species&#x27; hunting of all galliforms.

Usually coveys of quail are partially protected by spending the night roosting communally in dense thickets but should a hunting owl be able to track down the communal roost, losses can be fairly heavy until the roost relocates. Similarly, owls may track down sleeping grouse, which also roost in vegetation but more openly than quail. Some grouse, such as greater prairie chicken (&quot;Tympanuchus cupido&quot;), sharp-tailed grouse (&quot;Tympanuchus phasianellus&quot;) and greater sage-grouse (&quot;Centrocercus urophasianus&quot;), may also been vulnerable to great horned owls while displaying conspicuously in openings on a lek first thing in the morning. In the boreal forest, especially in years where the snowshoe hare experiences population decreases, great horned owls prey fairly heavily (approximately 25% of biomass) on ruffed grouse (&quot;Bonasa umbellus&quot;) and spruce grouse (&quot;Falcipennis canadensis&quot;), enough so in the earlier bird to possibly contribute to population reductions. Larger species of galliform are not immune to predation either. On Protection Island in Washington state, introduced common peafowl (&quot;Pavo cristatus&quot;) are an important prey item. The wild turkey (&quot;Meleagris gallopavo&quot;), on average between the sexes, is probably the largest bird the great horned owl hunts in which they kill adults. Both full-grown wild turkeys and adult domestic turkeys have been hunted and killed. Under normal circumstances, domestic chicken (&quot;Gallus gallus domesticus&quot;) will be ignored in favor of wild prey. On occasion, individual owls, especially inexperienced juveniles, will become habitual fowl killers. These errant owls mainly hunt chickens, though will also take domestic guineafowl, turkeys and anything else available. In general, chickens kept in locked cages with enclosed tops overnight are safe from great horned owls; not so chickens left free range or in open enclosures.

While galliforms are widely reported, the few cases where great horned owls locally turn to birds as the primary food source over mammals, these may often be local responses to the abundance of breeding water birds or concentrations of roosting water birds, since they tend to roost in relatively open spots. They have been known to predate more than 110 different species of assorted water bird. In prairie wetlands of North Dakota, avian prey, primarily represented by ducks and the American coot (&quot;Fulica americana&quot;) came to represent 65% by number and 83% by biomass of the diet of the local owls, also including secondarily grebes, smaller rails, loons, shorebirds and seabirds, as well as upland-based species like grey partridge (&quot;Perdix perdix&quot;), sharp-tailed grouse and passerines. 77% of the ducks in that study were juveniles, the largest duck being a male mallard (&quot;Anas platyrhnychos&quot;) weighing approximately , but nearly all the coots were adults. On Protection Island, Washington, where they are no native land mammals, rhinoceros auklets (&quot;Cerorhinca monocerata&quot;), both adults and nestlings, were the most numerous prey, present in 93% of 120 pellets. Species as large as adult Canada geese, snow goose and great blue herons have been successfully killed. Medium-sized birds of prey (even other species of owl) are also taken. The nestlings of even larger species like trumpeter swans (&quot;Cygnus buccinator&quot;), American white pelicans (&quot;Pelecanus eryhtrorhynchos&quot;), brown pelicans (&quot;Pelecanus occidentalis&quot;) and sandhill cranes (&quot;Grus canadensis&quot;) have also been killed by these owls.

Other assorted birds are taken seemingly at random opportunity. The predatory effect of this species on other raptorial birds, which is often considerable, is explored in the following section. In Brazil, it was found in a small study that birds overall outnumbered mammals in pellets, although most were not determined to species and the ones that were shown a tremendously diverse assemblage of birds with no obvious dietary preference. Although not usually numerically significant, 86 species of passerine have been taken by great horned owls. Members from most North American families are known as prey, although among smaller types such as chickadees, warblers, sparrows, cardinalids, wrens and most tyrant flycatchers only a few species from each have been recorded. Nonetheless, an occasionally unlucky migrant or local breeder is sometimes snatched. Fledgling songbirds are regularly taken in spring and summer. The smallest avian prey known for great horned owls are the blue-grey gnatcatcher (&quot;Polioptila caerulea&quot;) and the ruby-crowned kinglet (&quot;Regulus calendula&quot;). Somewhat larger bodied families are more prominent, i.e. the corvids (14 species) and icterids (14 species) and, secondarily, the kingbirds (&quot;Tyrannus&quot; ssp.), thrushes, mimids and European starling (&quot;Sturnus vulgaris&quot;). This is likely due to the fact that the larger passerines usually roost in relatively open spots and have larger, more conspicuous nests. Crows and ravens tend to be grabbed off of their communal roosts by night.

===Other prey===
The great horned owl rarely misses an opportunity to hunt reptiles and amphibians. However, lizards are largely unavailable as prey due to their typically diurnal periods of activity. However, some snakes are partially or largely nocturnal, and more than a dozen species are hunted in North America. Snakes hunted range from small, innocuous garter snakes (&quot;Thamnophis&quot; ssp.) and night snakes (&quot;Hypsiglena torquata&quot;) to venomous species like cottonmouths (&quot;Agkistrodon piscivorus&quot;) and prairie rattlesnakes (&quot;Crotalus virdis&quot;) and formidable, large species like common king snakes (&quot;Lampropeltis getula&quot;) and black rat snakes (&quot;Pantherophis obsoletus&quot;), which in mature specimens can rival the owl in mass and sheer predatory power. The capture of the hatchlings of very large reptiles such as loggerhead turtles (&quot;Caretta caretta&quot;) and American alligators (&quot;Alligator mississippiensis&quot;) by great horned owls has been reported, in both cases likely when the baby reptiles are attempting to make their way to the security of water. On rare occasion, salamanders, frogs and toads are reported as prey. On rare occasions, fish are taken including goldfish (&quot;Carassius auratus&quot;), bluegill (&quot;Lepomis macrochirus&quot;), bullheads (&quot;Ameiurus&quot; ssp.), other catfish, suckers, sunfish, eels and dace and chub.

Many types of invertebrates are recorded as prey. These include mainly insects, but also crayfish, crabs, centipedes, spiders, scorpions and worms. The occasionally invertebrate prey taken largely consists of common, large insects such as various beetles, crickets, grasshoppers, water bugs and katydids, some of which the great horned owl has even reportedly caught via &quot;hawking&quot;, i.e. swooping at on the wing. In some cases, the content of insects in great horned owl pellets may actually be due to the owls eating other birds which have freshly eaten insects in their own stomachs. It is commonly believed that routine insectivory in great horned owls is mainly restricted to inexperienced young owls too unskilled to graduate to larger prey yet. It is clearly inefficient for owls of this size to attempt to raise young on a diet of foods as small as insects. Although rare, carrion-feeding has been recorded in great horned owls, especially ones wintering in Canada and other northern areas during harsh weather. Road kills are sometimes opportunistically eaten. A case of an owl scavenging a white-tailed deer (&quot;Odocoileus virginianus&quot;) carcass, ultimately tearing off the deer&#x27;s leg, was captured on a motion capture video camera set out to film wildlife.

===Urban vs rural diet===
Studies comparing the diets of rural and urban great horned owls have identified that the most abundant rodent prey in their environment fulfils the majority of their diet. A study of food niche overlap between closely nested barn and great horned owls living in rural north-eastern Oregon identified voles as by far the most common prey. In southwestern British Columbia, Townsend&#x27;s voles were the most common prey species, while consumption of rats increased as the nesting location became more urban and rats replaced voles as the most abundant and stable food source. A similar focus on rats was found in populations in urban parks in Seattle. Although a stable and highly abundant food source, a diet consisting of primarily rats can be harmful to urban great horned owls due to bioaccumulation of rodenticides.

===Interspecific predatory relationships===

Due to their very broad dietary habits, the great horned owls share their prey with many other predators, including avian, mammalian and reptilian ones. Almost every study comparing the diets of North American owls illustrates the considerable overlap in the dietary selection of these species, as all species, besides the primarily insectivorous varieties, rely on many of the same small rodent species for most of their diet, extending from the small northern saw-whet owl and eastern screech owl to the great horned and great grey owls.

In a long-term study of a block of Michigan, all nine species of accipitrid, falcon and owl that stayed to breed there were found to be primarily dependent on the same two rodent genera, the meadow vole and the two common &quot;Peromyscus&quot; species. In the Great Basin, the owls share black-tailed jackrabbit and desert cottontail as the primary prey with golden eagles, red-tailed hawks and ferruginous hawks (&quot;Buteo regalis&quot;); all four species had diets with more than 90% of the biomass is made up of those lagomorphs. Of these, the great horned owl and golden eagle were able to nest most closely to one another because they had the most strongly dissimilar periods of activity. In California, when compared to the local red-tailed hawks and western diamondback rattlesnakes (&quot;Crotalus atrox&quot;), the diets were most similar in that by number about 15–20% of all three species&#x27; diets depended on cottontails, but the largest portion was made up of ground squirrels in the hawk and the rattlesnake and desert woodrats and other assorted rodents in the great horned owl. In the boreal forests, the great horned owl&#x27;s prolificacy as a snowshoe hare hunter places it second only to the Canada lynx (&quot;Lynx canadensis&quot;) among all predators. Although locally dependent on the hares as their main food, northern goshawks (&quot;Accipiter gentilis&quot;), red-tailed hawks and golden eagles apparently do not have as large of an impact on the hares, nor do mammalian carnivore generalists that also kill many hares, like the fisher, bobcat, wolverine (&quot;Gulo gulo&quot;), coyote and larger varieties (i.e. wolves (&quot;Canis lupus&quot;), cougars (&quot;Puma concolor&quot;) and bears (&quot;Ursus&quot; ssp.)).

The relationship between great horned owls and other raptorial birds in its range is usually decidedly one-sided. While certain species, such as the red-tailed hawk and northern goshawk, might be seen as potential competition for the owls, most others seem to be regarded merely as prey by great horned owls. The great horned owl is both the most prolific and diverse predator in America of other birds of prey, with other accomplished raptor-hunters such as the goshawk and the golden eagle being more restricted in range, habitat and number in North America and thus having a more minor impact. All studies have found raptors are a small portion of this owl&#x27;s diet but predation can be seriously detrimental for such prey, as raptors tend to be territorial and sparsely distributed as a rule and thus can be effectively decimated by a small number of losses. In the gray hawk (&quot;Buteo plagiatus&quot;), for example, in a study of one breeding block of Arizona, the owls were observed to visit nests nightly until all the nestlings were gone.

Raptorial birds in general tend to have large, conspicuous nests which may make them easier for a hunting owl to locate. The great horned owl gains an advantage by nesting earlier than any other raptor in its range (indeed any bird), as it is able to exploit the other raptors as food while in a more vulnerable state as their own nestlings have become well developed. On average, great horned owls begin nesting about three weeks before red-tailed hawks begin to build nests, although some raptors may locally breed as much as two months after the owls.

More so than diurnal varieties of raptor, fairly significant numbers of owls are hunted, as all species are to some extent nocturnal and thus their corresponding activity can attract the horned owl&#x27;s unwanted attention. The extent of predation on other owls depends on the habitat preferences of the other species. Eastern and western screech owls may be most vulnerable since they prefer similar wooded edge habitat. In a block of Wisconsin, great horned owls were responsible for the failure of 78% of eastern screech owl&#x27;s nests. Long-eared owls and, to a lesser extent, barn owls tend to hunt in open, sparsely treed habitats more so than great horned owls, but since they may return to wooded spots for nesting purposes, they may be more vulnerable there. The long-eared owl and barn owls are often compared to the great horned owl as these medium-sized species often occur in abutting habitats and often hunt primarily the same vole and mice species, although the alternate prey of the great horned tends to be much larger, including the smaller owls themselves. In a pair of studies from Colorado, the average weight of prey for long-eared owls was , for barn owl and for the great horned owl.

Both young and adult great grey owls, despite their superficially superior size, are apparently hunted with impunity by great horned owls. In the boreal forests, both the northern hawk owl and great grey owl appear to be in greater danger of great horned owl predation in years where the snowshoe hare have low populations. Great horned owls were the leading cause of mortality in juvenile spotted owls (30% of losses) and juvenile great grey owls (65% of losses). Less is known about relations with the snowy owl, which may compete with great horned owls for food while invading south for the winter. Anecdotally, both snowy and great horned owls have rarely been reported to dominate or even kill one another depending on the size and disposition of the individual owls, although the snowy&#x27;s preference for more open areas again acts as something of a buffer. The snowy may be the one North American owl too formidable for the great horned owl to consider as prey.

Whereas owls of any age are freely attacked by great horned owls whether nesting or not, when it comes to diurnal raptors, great horned owls are mainly a danger around the nest. They often hunt diurnal raptors when they come across their often relatively conspicuous active platform nests during hunting forays in spring and summer, taking numbers of both nestlings and brooding adults. Again, like owls, diurnal raptors are attacked depending on the relative similarity of their habitat preferences to the owl. Cooper&#x27;s hawks (&quot;Accipiter cooperii&quot;) and red-tailed hawks tend to be most vulnerable, as they prefer the same wooded edges frequented by great horned owls. Other diurnal raptors may be attracted to more enclosed wooded areas, such as sharp-shinned hawks (&quot;Accipiter striatus&quot;) or zone-tailed hawks (&quot;Buteo albonotatus&quot;), or more open plain and meadow areas, such as Northern harriers (&quot;Circus hudsonius&quot;) and ferruginous hawks, but this is almost never a total insurance against predation as all of these are recorded prey.

In a study of red-shouldered hawk (&quot;Buteo lineatus&quot;) and broad-winged hawk (&quot;Buteo brachyurus&quot;) breeding in New York, despite their nesting in deeper woods than those that host these owls, the main cause of nest failure was great horned owl predation. Similarly, the great horned owl was the primary cause of nesting failure for both desert-dwelling Harris&#x27;s hawks (&quot;Parabuteo unicinctus&quot;) and forest-dwelling northern goshawk in Arizona (39% and 40% of failures, respectively), wetland-inhabiting osprey (&quot;Pandion haliaetus&quot;) in Delaware (21% of failures) and peregrine falcons (&quot;Falco peregrinus&quot;) in the Western United States (27% of failures). The fact that many of the nests great horned owls use are constructed by accipitrids may lead to localized conflicts, almost always to the detriment of the hawks rather than the owls. While the young of larger diurnal raptors are typically stolen in the night, great horned owls also readily kill large adult raptors both in and out of breeding seasons, including osprey, northern goshawk and rough-legged buzzard.

Great horned owls are frequently mobbed by other birds. Most accipitrids will readily mob them, as will falcons. Hen harriers, northern goshawks, Cooper&#x27;s hawks, Harris&#x27;s hawks, red-tailed hawks, Swainson&#x27;s hawks, ferruginous hawks, red-shouldered hawks, American kestrels, peregrine falcons, prairie falcons (&quot;Falco mexicanus&quot;) and common ravens (&quot;Corvus corax&quot;) are among the reported species who have been recorded diving on great horned owls when they discover them. In Arizona and Texas, they may be mobbed by Mexican jays and western scrub jays (&quot;Aphelocoma wollweberi &amp; californica&quot;) and western and Cassin&#x27;s kingbirds (&quot;Tyrannus verticalis &amp; vociferans&quot;). In addition, there are several documented incidences of American crows mobbing a great horned owl, in groups of dozens or even hundreds of crows. In response to mobbing, if the owl flies it alights to the nearest secluded spot. If an owl alights on ground or on exposed branch or ledge, it may respond to swooping and stooping flights of corvids and raptors with threat display and raising of its wings.

==Reproduction==
Great horned owls are some of the earliest-breeding birds in North America, seemingly in part because of the lengthy nightfall at this time of year and additionally the competitive advantage it gives the owl over other raptors. In most of North America, courtship is from October to December and mates are chosen by December to January. This species was once thought to be strictly monogamous, but recent analysis indicates one male may mate with two females simultaneously, as was discovered for the first time in 2018 in Reno, Nevada. During courtship in late fall or early winter, the male attracts the attention of his mate by hooting emphatically while leaning over (with the tail folded or cocked) and puffing up his white throat to look like a ball. The white throat may serve as a visual stimulus in the low light conditions typical of when this owl courts. He often flies up and down on a perch, while approaching the potential mate. Eventually, he comes to approach the female and tries to rub his bill against hers while repeatedly bowing. If receptive, the female hoots back when the pair meet but is more subdued in both her hoot and display. The male may convince the female by bringing her freshly caught prey, which they will share. While males often hoot emphatically for about a month or six weeks towards the end of the year, the period where females also hoot is usually only a week to ten days. Pairs typically breed together year after year and may mate for life, although they associate with each other more loosely when their young become mostly independent. Pairs rekindling their reproductive relationship in the winter may perform a milder courtship to strengthen pair bonds before producing young.

Males select nesting sites and bring the females&#x27; attention to them by flying to the nest and then stomping on it. Considering the owls&#x27; large size, nests with open access are preferred to those enclosed with surrounding branches. Like all owls, great horned owls do not build their own nest. Great horned owls tend to examine an area for an abandoned nest, generally from larger birds like hawks, and take over the nest for raising their own young. They nest in a wider variety of sites than any other North American bird. Many nests are in cavernous hollows of dead trees or their branches, and especially in southern states in large trees along the edge of old-growth lots. In mountainous or hilly areas, especially in canyons of the Southwest and Rocky Mountains, cliff ledges, small caves, and other sheltered depressions may be used. Owls living in prairie country, in the absence of other animals&#x27; nests, riparian tree-hollows or man-made structures, will use boulders, buttes, railroad cuts, low bushes and even the bare ground as nest sites. Ground nests have also been recorded in the midst of tall grasses in Florida and in the midst of brushy spots on desert ground. Even the burrow entrances of American badger and coyote dens have reportedly been used as nests, in spite of the inherent risk of sharing space with such potentially dangerous co-inhabitants. Nesting behavior for the great horned owl appears to be more closely related to prey availability than it does to seasonal conditions. There has been some evidence that if prey availability is low enough then the species may forgo mating entirely for a season. Male and female owls of the species have been observed to help incubate the eggs once they have been laid on a nest.
Most tree nests used by great horned owls are constructed by other animals, often from a height of about off the ground. They often take over a nest used by some other large bird, sometimes adding feathers to line the nest but usually not much more. Allegedly there have some cases where the owls have reinforced a nest structure or appeared to have reconstructed a nest, but as a rule no owl species has ever been known to actually build a nest. Great horned owls in the Southwest may also use nests in cacti, built by Harris&#x27;s hawk and red-tailed hawk, as well as large hollows in cacti. The nests they use are often made by most larger types of acciptrids, from species as small as Cooper&#x27;s hawks to bald eagle and golden eagle, though perhaps most often those of red-tailed hawks and other buteonines. Secondly in popularity are crow and raven (&quot;Corvus&quot; ssp.) nests. Even Canada goose, black-crowned night heron (&quot;Nycticorax nycticorax&quot;) and great blue heron nests have been used, the latter sometimes right in the midst of an active heronry. The leaf nests of squirrels are also regularly used but in general great horned owls are partial to stick nests since they provide a much firmer, safer foundation.

The stage at which eggs are laid is variable across North America. In Southern Florida, eggs may be laid as early as late November to as late as early January. In the southeast, from south Texas to Georgia, egg laying may begin from late December to early February. From Southern California to northern Louisiana, egg laying is from early February to late March. The largest swath of egg-laying owls from central California to South Carolina to as far north as Ohio and Massachusetts is from late February to early April. In the Rocky Mountains, Northwestern United States, northern New England and eastern Canada, egg laying is from early March to late April. In the rest of Canada and Alaska, egg laying may be from late March to early May. The latest known date of egg laying was in mid-June in Saskatchewan and the Yukon Territory. In northwestern Utah and north-central Alberta, egg-laying can be 3–4 weeks earlier than usual when food is abundant and weather is favorable. For owls found in more tropical climates, the dates of the breeding season are somewhat undefined. There are usually 2 eggs per clutch, but clutches range in size from 1 to 6 eggs (over 3 is uncommon, over 4 is very rare), depending on environmental conditions. The average egg width is , the average length is and the average weight is , although mass could be slightly higher elsewhere because this figure is from Los Angeles County, CA where the owls are relatively small. The incubation period ranges from 28 to 37 days, averaging 33 days. The female alone usually does all the incubation and rarely moves from the nest, while the male owl captures food and brings it to her, with the first nightly food delivery typically occurring soon after dark.

The young weigh at birth on average and can gain about a day for the first four weeks of life, with typical weights in the range of by 25–29 days for males and females, respectively. When first hatched the young are covered in whitish gray down, with some brownish about the wings. Gradually the soft juvenile downy plumage comes through the down, being typically a cinnamon-buff color, but with variable hues predicting the eventual color of the mature owls. The extent of down gradually diminishes, developing mature-looking plumage by late summer, although many first year birds still have scattered bits of down into autumn. By late autumn, first-year birds look similar to adults but with a slightly warmer, reddish tinge, less well developed ear tufts and a smaller white throat patch. The nestling owls develop mostly in behavior between two weeks and two months of age, in which time they adapt the ability to defend themselves, grasp foods and climb. Vocally, the young are able to exert weak chips while still in the egg, developing into a raspy chirp shortly after hatching. The calls of the young increase rapidly in intensity, pitch and character, some juvenile males mimicking their father&#x27;s hooting in fall but usually they conclude with various odd gurgling notes. The earliest competent hooting by juvenile owls is not until January. Young owls move onto nearby branches at 6 weeks and start to fly about a week later. However, the young are not usually competent fliers until they are about 10 to 12 weeks old. The age at which the young leave the nest is variable based on the abundance of food.

The young birds stay in an area ranging from 13 to 52 ha from the nest into fall, but will usually disperse up to several thousand hectares by the end of fall. The offspring have been seen still begging for food in late October (5 months after leaving the nest) and most do not fully leave their parents territory until right before the parents start to reproduce for the next clutch (usually December to January). Birds may not breed for another year or two, and are often vagrants (&quot;floaters&quot;) until they establish their own territories. Based on the development of the bursa, great horned owls reach sexual maturity at two years of age.
===Urban vs rural nesting===
While urban and rural populations show little difference in productivity, there are differences in nest selection. Rural owls use old raptor nests more frequently than urban birds, who utilize crow or squirrel nests. Additionally, urban nesting individuals utilize trees that are taller/wider in diameter and nest much higher compared to rural nesting Great Horned Owls. The reason behind this increased tree height is due to the fact that urban areas have large trees used for ornamentation, shade and shelter. The higher nesting within the taller trees was attributed to human avoidance. Both rural and urban nesting sites were often within range of paved roads, likely a result of the great horned owl&#x27;s tendency to hunt along roadways

Studies have shown that nesting in urban areas can influence adult great horned owls to lay eggs earlier than those who nest in rural areas. In Wisconsin, eggs in urban nests hatched a month earlier (January rather than February) than their counterparts in rural areas, probably due to increased protection from wind and cold. Nesting owls at sites in Winnipeg, Manitoba began nesting five to six weeks earlier than those in rural parts of Manitoba, presumably due to experiencing an extremely warm winter by Winnipeg&#x27;s standards, as well as benefitting from the local urban heat island.

==Mortality and longevity==

===Longevity and natural mortality===
Great horned owls seem to be the most long-lived owl in North America. Among all owls, they may outrank even the larger Eurasian eagle owl in known longevity records from the wild, with almost 29 years being the highest age for an owl recorded in North America. In captivity, the record for the longest lived great horned owl was 50 years. A more typical top lifespan of a great horned owl is approximately 13 years. In general, great horned owls are most vulnerable in the early stages of life, although few species press attacks on the owl&#x27;s nests due to the ferocious defensive abilities of the parents. Occasionally, nestlings and fledglings will fall from the nest too early to escape or to competently defend themselves and fall prey to foxes, bobcat, coyotes, or wild or feral cats. Occasionally raccoons and American black bears consume eggs and nestlings from tree nests and Virginia opossum may take the rare unguarded egg. Crows and ravens have been reported eating eggs and small nestlings. This can normally only happen when owls are driven from the nest by human activity or are forced to leave the nest to forage by low food resources but on occasion huge flocks of crows have been able to displace owls by harassing them endlessly. In general, great horned owls rarely engage in siblicide, unlike many other raptorial birds. Siblicide occurred at 9 of 2,711 nests in Saskatchewan. Most cases where young owls are killed and/or consumed by their siblings or parents appear to occur when the nestling is diseased, impaired or starving or is inadvertently crushed. Adults generally have no natural predators, excepting both North American eagles and other owls of their own species.

Occasionally, great horned owls may be killed by their own prey. Although typically able to kill skunks without ill effect, five owls were found blind after getting sprayed in their eyes by skunks. Cases where the quills of porcupines have killed or functionally disabled them have been observed as well. Violent fights have been observed between great horned owls after attempts to capture rat snakes and black racers. When a peregrine falcon repeatedly attacked a great horned owl near its nest along the Hudson River, it was apparently unable to dispatch the larger raptor despite several powerful strikes. During their initial dispersal in fall, juvenile owls have a high mortality rate, frequently more than 50%. For owls in the Yukon Territory, juvenile survival in the 9 weeks after dispersal has dropped from 80% to 23.2% in a span of three years in response of instability of food supply. In the Yukon, adults on territory had an average annual survival rate of 90.5%. Anemia, caused by &quot;Leucocytozoon ziemanni&quot; and the drinking of blood by swarming, blood-drinking blackflies (&quot;Simulium&quot; ssp.), was a leading cause of juvenile mortality in the Yukon.

===Human-related mortality===
The great horned owl is not considered a globally threatened species by the IUCN. Including the Magellanic species, there are approximately 5.3 million wild horned owls in the Americas. Most mortality in modern times is human-related, caused by owls flying into man-made objects, including buildings, cars, power lines, or barbed wire. In one study, the leading causes of death for owls were collision with cars, entanglement with wires, flying into buildings and, lastly, electrocution. Among 209 banded nestlings in yet another study, 67% were found dead after independence: 56 were found shot, 41 were trapped, 15 hit by cars, 14 found dead on highways and 14 electrocuted by overhead power lines. Secondary poisoning from pest control efforts is widely reported variously due to anticoagulant rodenticides, strychnine, organophosphates (famphur applied topically to cattle (&quot;Bos primigenius taurus&quot;)), organochlorines, and PCBs.

Frequently, the species were denominated a pest due to the perceived threat it posed to domestic fowl and potentially small game. The first genuine nature conservationists, while campaigning against the &quot;Extermination Being Waged Against the Hawks and Owls&quot;, continued to advocate the destruction of great horned owls due to their predatory effect on other wildlife. Thus, small bounties were offered in trade for owl bodies. Around the turn of the 20th century, the great horned owl was considered endangered in the state of Michigan because of the large number of poachers who were illegally hunting and collecting it. Hunting and trapping of great horned owls may continue on a small scale but is now illegal in most countries.

===Effect on conservation-dependent species===
Occasionally, these owls may prey on threatened species. Following the devastation to its populations from DDT, the reintroduction of the peregrine falcon to the Mississippi and Hudson Rivers was hampered by great horned owls killing both young and adult peregrines at night. Similarly, as mainly recorded in New England, attempts to reintroduce ospreys, after they were also hit hard by DDT, were affected by heavy owl predation on nestlings, and the owls were also recorded to take a large toll locally on the threatened colonies of roseate terns. Where clear-cutting occurs in old-growth areas of the Pacific Northwest, spotted owls have been badly affected by considerable great horned owl predation. While at least the ospreys and peregrines have rebounded admirably nonetheless, bird and mammal species that are much rarer overall sometimes fall prey to great horned owls, many in which even sporadic losses can be devastating. Among the species considered threatened, endangered or critically endangered by the IUCN which are also known to be killed by great horned owls are Townsend&#x27;s ground squirrels (&quot;Urocitellus townsendii&quot;), Pacific pocket mice (&quot;Perognathus pacificus&quot;), giant kangaroo rats, Stephens&#x27; kangaroo rat (&quot;Dipodomys stephensi&quot;), black-footed ferrets, greater and lesser prairie chickens, marbled murrelets (&quot;Brachyramphus marmoratus&quot;), ivory-billed woodpeckers, Florida scrub jays (&quot;Aphelocoma coerulescens&quot;), pinyon jays, Kirtland&#x27;s warblers (&quot;Setophaga kirtlandii&quot;) and rusty blackbirds (&quot;Euphagus carolinus&quot;). The American Bird Conservancy&#x27;s &quot;green list&quot; includes birds with considerable population declines (many classed as near threatened by the IUCN) or other immediate threats and/or restricted populations. Altogether, great horned owls hunt 50 different species from that list.

==Captivity==
From experimentally raising young owls in captivity, Paul L. Errington felt that they were a bird of &quot;essentially low intelligence&quot; that could only hunt when partially wild and instinctually driven by hunger to hunt whatever they first encounter. He showed captive birds that were provided strips of meat from hatching, rather than having to hunt or to simulate hunting to obtain food, had no capacity to hunt. On the contrary, William J. Baerg compared behaviorally his captive-raised great horned owls to parrots, which are famously intelligent birds, although not as often playful: &quot;It knows its keeper and usually accepts whatever he wishes to do with a good deal of tolerance.&quot; Carl D. Marti disagrees with Errington&#x27;s assessments, noting that their prey selection is not as &quot;completely random as Errington suggested&quot;. He further notes that though great horned owls appear to &quot;select their mammalian prey in general relation to the prey populations&quot;, cottontails seem to be selected as prey &quot;out of relation to their population status&quot;.

Arthur C. Bent also noted the variability in temperaments of great horned owls to their handlers, some generally pleasant, though most are eventually aggressive. Most captive specimens, once mature, seem to resent attempts at contact and are often given to attacking their keepers. They will only follow cues when conditioned from an early age but rarely with the same level of success seen in some diurnal birds of prey trained for falconry or entertainment, although this does not necessarily correlate with intelligence as posited by Errington. 

A male great horned owl and a female Eurasian eagle-owl produced an apparently healthy hybrid young at Dudley Zoo in England. 

==Iconography and myth==
Many warrior-based tribes of Native Americans admired the great horned owl for their &quot;strength, courage and beauty&quot;. The Pima of the Southwest believed that owls were reincarnations of slain warriors who fly about by night. The Arikara of the Great Plains had mystic owl societies in which initiates were made to adorn a facial mask made of the wing and tail feathers of great horned owls. Some Indian nations regarded the great horned owl as a friendly spirit that could aid in matters of love, such as the Passamaquoddy of Maine, who felt the call of this species was a magical love flute designed to ignite human passions. The Hopi of the Southwest also associated this owl with fertility, albeit of a different kind: they believed the calling of the owls into summer predicted hot weather, which produced good peach crops. During the winter solstice, the Hopi performed a ceremony with great horned owl feathers in hopes of summoning the heat of summer. Tribes in New Mexico were known to use owl wing-feathers to produce arrows which could strike their enemies with a minimum of sound. The Zuni held owl feathers in their mouths hoping to gain some of the silence that owls use in ambushes while striking their own enemies from other tribes. The Iroquois felt the origin of the great horned owl was due to an unformed owl annoying Raweno, the almighty creator, while Raweno created the rabbit, causing Raweno to make the owl &quot;covered with mud&quot; (dark camouflage) and doomed to ceaselessly call &quot;whoo whoo&quot;, which he used while harassing Raweno by night because Raweno was active during the day.

<text>&quot;Barbara Allen&quot; (Child 84, Roud 54) is a traditional folk song that is popular throughout the English-speaking world and beyond. It tells of how the eponymous character denies a dying man&#x27;s love, then dies of grief soon after his untimely death.

The song began as a ballad in the seventeenth century or earlier, before quickly spreading (both orally and in print) throughout Britain and Ireland and later North America. Ethnomusicologists Steve Roud and Julia Bishop described it as &quot;far and away the most widely collected song in the English language—equally popular in England, Scotland and Ireland, and with hundreds of versions collected over the years in North America.&quot;

As with most folk songs, &quot;Barbara Allen&quot; has been published and performed under many different titles, including &quot;The Ballet of Barbara Allen&quot;, &quot;Barbara Allen&#x27;s Cruelty&quot;, &quot;Barbarous Ellen&quot;, &quot;Edelin&quot;, &quot;Hard Hearted Barbary Ellen&quot;, &quot;Sad Ballet Of Little Johnnie Green&quot;, &quot;Sir John Graham&quot;, &quot;Bonny Barbara Allan&quot;, &quot;Barbry Allen&quot; among others.

==Synopsis==
The ballad generally follows a standard plot, although narrative details vary between versions.

* A servant asks Barbara to attend on his sick master. 
* She visits the bedside of the heartbroken young man, who then pleads for her love.
* She refuses, claiming he had slighted her while drinking with friends.
* He dies soon after and Barbara hears his funeral bells tolling; stricken with grief, she dies as well.
* They are buried in the same church; a rose grows from his grave, a briar from hers, and the plants form a true lovers&#x27; knot.

==History==

A diary entry by Samuel Pepys on 2 January 1666 contains the earliest extant reference to the song. In it, he recalls the fun and games at a New Years party:

...but above all, my dear Mrs Knipp, with whom I sang; and in perfect pleasure I was to hear her sing, and especially her little Scotch song of Barbary Allen.

From this, Steve Roud and Julia Bishop have inferred the song was popular at that time, suggesting that it may have been written for stage performance, as Elizabeth Knepp was a professional actress, singer, and dancer. However, the folklorists Phillips Barry and Fannie Hardy Eckstorm were of the opinion that the song &quot;was not a stage song at all but a libel on Barbara Villiers and her relations with Charles II&quot;. Charles Seeger points out that Pepys&#x27; delight at hearing a libelous song about the King&#x27;s mistress was perfectly in character.

In 1792, the renowned Austrian composer Joseph Haydn arranged &quot;Barbara Allen&quot; as one of over 400 folk song arrangements commissioned by George Thomson and the publishers William Napier and William Whyte. He probably took the melody from James Oswald&#x27;s &quot;Caledonian Pocket Companion&quot;, c.1750.

=== Early printed versions ===

One 1690 broadside of the song was published in London under the title &quot;Barbara Allen&#x27;s cruelty: or, the young-man&#x27;s tragedy&quot; (see lyrics below). With Barbara Allen&#x27;s [l]amentation for her unkindness to her lover, and her self&quot;. Additional printings were common in Britain throughout the eighteenth century. Scottish poet Allan Ramsay published &quot;Bonny Barbara Allen&quot; in his Tea-Table Miscellany published in 1740. Soon after, Thomas Percy published two similar renditions in his 1765 collection &quot;Reliques of Ancient English Poetry&quot; under the titles &quot;Barbara Allen&#x27;s Cruelty&quot; and &quot;Sir John Grehme and Barbara Allen&quot;. Ethnomusicologist Francis James Child compiled these renditions together in the nineteenth century with several others found in the Roxburghe Ballads to create his A and B standard versions, used by later scholars as a reference.

The ballad was first printed in the United States in 1836. Many variations of the song continued to be printed on broadsides in the United States through the 19th and 20th centuries. Throughout New England, for example, it was passed orally and spread by inclusion in songbooks and newspaper columns, along with other popular ballads such as &quot;The Farmer&#x27;s Curst Wife&quot; and &quot;The Golden Vanity&quot;.

The popularity of printed versions meant that lyrics from broadsides greatly influenced traditional singers; various collected versions can be traced back to different broadsides.

=== Traditional recordings ===

According to the Vaughan Williams Memorial Library, approximately 500 traditional recordings of the song have been made. The earliest recording of the song is probably a 1907 wax cylinder recording by composer and musicologist Percy Grainger of the Lincolnshire folk singer Joseph Taylor, which was digitised by the British Library and can now be heard online via the British Library Sound Archive. Other authentic recordings include those of African American Hule &quot;Queen&quot; Hines of Florida (1939), Welshman Phil Tanner (1949), Irishwoman Elizabeth Cronin (early 1950s), Norfolk folk-singer Sam Larner (1958), and Appalachian folk singer Jean Ritchie (1961). Charles Seeger edited a collection released by the Library of Congress entitled &quot;Versions and Variants of Barbara Allen from the Archive of Folk Song&quot; as part of its series &quot;Folk Music of the United States&quot;. The record compiled 30 versions of the ballad, recorded from 1933 to 1954 in the United States.

==Lyrics==
&quot;Barbara Allen&#x27;s cruelty: or, the young-man&#x27;s tragedy&quot; (c.1690), the earliest &quot;Barbara Allen&quot; text:


== Variations ==
The lyrics are nowhere near as varied across the oral tradition as would be expected. This is because the continuous popularity of the song in print meant that variations were &quot;corrected&quot;. Nonetheless, American folklorist Harry Smith was known to, as a party trick, ask people to sing a verse of the song, after which he would tell what county they were born in.

=== Setting ===
The setting is sometimes &quot;Scarlet Town&quot;. This may be a punning reference to Reading, as a slip-song version c. 1790 among the Madden songs at Cambridge University Library has &#x27;In Reading town, where I was bound.&#x27; London town and Dublin town are used in other versions.

The ballad often opens by establishing a festive time frame, such as May, Martinmas, or Lammas. The versions which begin by mentioning &quot;Martinmas Time&quot; and others which begin with &quot;Early early in the spring&quot; are thought to be the oldest and least corrupted by more recent printed versions.

The Martinmas variants, most common in Scotland, are probably older than the Scarlet Town variants, which presumably originated in the south of England. Around half of all American versions take place in the month of May; these versions are the most diverse, as they appear to have existed within the oral tradition rather than on broadsides.

After the setting is established, a dialogue between the two characters generally follows.

=== Protagonists ===
The dying man is called Sir John Graeme in the earliest known printings. American versions of the ballad often call him some variation of William, James, or Jimmy; his last name may be specified as Grove, Green, Grame, or another. In most English versions, the narrator is often the unnamed male protagonist.

The woman is called &quot;Barbry&quot; rather than &quot;Barbara&quot; in almost all American versions and some English versions, and &quot;Bawbee&quot; in many Scottish versions. Her name is sometimes &quot;Ellen&quot; instead of &quot;Allen&quot;.

===Symbolism and parallels===
The song often concludes with poetic motif of a rose growing from his grave and a brier from hers forming a &quot;true lovers&#x27; knot&quot;, which symbolises their fidelity in love even after death. This motif is paralleled in several ballads including &quot;Lord Thomas and Fair Annet&quot;, &quot;Lord Lovel&quot;, and &quot;Fair Margaret and Sweet William&quot;. However, the ballad lacks many of the common phrases found in ballads of similar ages (e.g. mounting a &quot;milk white steed and a dapple&quot; grey), possibly because the strong story and imagery means these cliches are not required.

== Melody ==
A vast array of tunes were traditionally used for &quot;Barbara Allen&quot;. Many American versions are pentatonic and without a clear tonic note, such as the Ritchie family version. English versions are more rooted in the major mode. The minor-mode Scottish tune seems to be the oldest, as it is the version found in James Oswald&#x27;s &quot;Caledonian Pocket Companion&quot; which was written in the mid-1700s. That tune survived in the oral tradition in Scotland until the twentieth century; a version sung by a Mrs. Ann Lyell (1869–1945) collected by James Madison Carpenter from in the 1930s can be heard on the Vaughan Williams Memorial Library website, and Ewan MacColl recorded a version learned from his mother Betsy Miller. Whilst printed versions of the lyrics influenced the versions performed by traditional singers, the tunes were rarely printed so they are thought to have been passed on from person to person through the centuries and evolved more organically.

==Popular arrangements and commercial recordings==
Roger Quilter wrote an arrangement in 1921, dedicated to the noted Irish baritone Frederick Ranalow, who had become famous for his performance as Macheath in &quot;The Beggar&#x27;s Opera&quot; at the Lyric Theatre, Hammersmith. Quilter set each verse differently, using countermelodies as undercurrents. An octave B with a bare fifth tolls like a bell in the fourth verse. A short piano interlude before the fifth verse was commented on favourably by Percy Grainger. Quilter later incorporated the setting in his &quot;Arnold Book of Old Songs&quot;, rededicated to his late nephew Arnold Guy Vivian, and published in 1950.

Baritone vocalist Royal Dadmun released a version in 1922 on Victor Records. The song is credited to the arrangers, Eaton Faning and John Liptrot Hatton. British composer Florence Margaret Spencer Palmer published &quot;Variations on Barbara Allen&quot; for piano in 1923.

Versions of the song were recorded in the 1950s and &#x27;60s by folk revivalists, including Pete Seeger. Eddy Arnold recorded and released a version on his 1955 album &quot;Wanderin&#x27;&quot;. The Everly Brothers recorded and released a version on their 1958 folk album, &quot;Songs Our Daddy Taught Us&quot;. Joan Baez released a version in 1961, the same year as Jean Ritchie&#x27;s recording. Bob Dylan said that folk songs were highly influential on him, writing in a poem that &quot;[w]ithout &quot;Barbara Allen there&#x27;d be no &#x27;Girl from the North Country&#x27;; Dylan performed a live eight-minute rendition in 1962 which was subsequently released on &quot;Live at The Gaslight 1962&quot;.

The demo of the ballad recorded by Simon and Garfunkel appears on their anthology album &quot;The Columbia Studio Recordings (1964-1970)&quot; and a bonus track on the 2001 edition of their album &quot;Sounds of Silence&quot; as &quot;Barbriallen&quot;, and by Art Garfunkel alone in 1973 on his album &quot;Angel Clare&quot;.

June Tabor, the English folk singer includes the song as &quot;Barbry Allen&quot; on her 2001 album &quot;Rosa Mundi&quot;. 
Angelo Branduardi recorded this song as Barbrie Allen resp. Barbriallen on his two music albums &quot;Così è se mi pare – EP&quot; &quot; and &quot;Il Rovo e la rosa&quot; in Italian. On his French EN FRANÇAIS – BEST OF compilation in 2015 he sang this song in French-adaption written by Carla Bruni.

English singer-songwriter Frank Turner often sings the song a cappella during live performances. One rendition is included on the compilation album &quot;The Second Three Years&quot;.

UK folk duo Nancy Kerr &amp; James Fagan included the song on their 2005 album Strands of Gold, and also on their 2019 live album An Evening With Nancy Kerr &amp; James Fagan.

The Renaissance folk-rock band Blackmore&#x27;s Night include the song on their 2010 album &quot;Autumn Sky&quot;.

==Popular culture adaptations and references==
The song has been adapted and retold in numerous non-musical contexts. In the early twentieth century, the American writer Robert E. Howard wove verses of the song into a civil war ghost story that was posthumously published under the title &quot;&quot;For the Love of Barbara Allen&quot;.&quot; Howard Richardson and William Berney&#x27;s 1942 stage play &quot;Dark of the Moon&quot; is based on the ballad, as a reference to the influence of English, Irish and Scottish folktales and songs in Appalachia. It was also retold as a radio drama on the program &quot;Suspense&quot;, which aired 20 October 1952, and was entitled &quot;The Death of Barbara Allen&quot; with Anne Baxter in the titular role. A British radio play titled &quot;Barbara Allen&quot; featured Honeysuckle Weeks and Keith Barron; it was written by David Pownall and premiered on BBC Radio 7 on 16 February 2009. In &quot;The Hunger Games&quot; prequel novel &quot;The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes&quot;, characters from the Covey are given first names based on traditional ballads. The character Barb Azure Baird&#x27;s first name is based on Barbara Allen.

The song has also been sampled, quoted, and featured as a dramatic device in numerous films:

*&quot;Tom Brown&#x27;s School Days&quot; (1940)
*&quot;Scrooge&quot; (1951; released in the U.S. as &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot;)
*&quot;Robin Hood Daffy&quot; (1958; Warner Brothers cartoon)
*&quot;The Buccaneer&quot; (1958), sung by Claire Bloom.
*&quot;Parker Adderson, Philosopher&quot; (1974; short film)
*Jane Campion&#x27;s Oscar-winning &quot;The Piano&quot; (1993)
*&quot;Best in Show&quot; (2000)
*&quot;Songcatcher&quot; (2000)
*&quot;A Love Song for Bobby Long&quot; (2004)

<text>The City of Peterborough, is a district with city status in the ceremonial county of Cambridgeshire, England. The district is named after its largest settlement, Peterborough, but also covers a wider area of outlying villages and hamlets. The district is administered by Peterborough City Council, a unitary authority.

The district&#x27;s area covers parts of the historic counties of Northamptonshire and Huntingdonshire, as well as a small part of Cambridgeshire. In 1965, the area became part of the short-lived county of Huntingdon and Peterborough before becoming a district of Cambridgeshire in 1974. Located in the East Anglia region of England, the area borders the surrounding counties of Lincolnshire and Northamptonshire. The population of the district was 202,259 making it the second-largest district by population in East Anglia (after East Suffolk).

Most of the contemporary district was formerly part of the Soke of Peterborough, a liberty within the historic county of Northamptonshire. Between 1889 and 1965, Peterborough was governed by the Soke of Peterborough County Council, making the Soke of Peterborough a completely autonomous, self-governing part of Northamptonshire, while the rest of that county was governed by Northamptonshire County Council. Today, the City of Peterborough district holds a similar status as part of Cambridgeshire to that which the Soke of Peterborough had as part of Northamptonshire, in that the contemporary district is a Unitary Authority with its own council, and a self-governing part of Cambridgeshire while the rest of that county is governed by Cambridgeshire County Council.

Peterborough was a Saxon settlement during the Anglo-Saxon era. The district also includes outlying villages such as Thorney, Old Fletton, Werrington, Parnwell, Dogsthorpe, Eye Green, Glinton, Northborough, Maxey, Wittering, Wansford and Ailsworth.

The district borders North Northamptonshire, Huntingdonshire, Fenland, South Kesteven and South Holland.

== Administration ==
=== Parliamentary seat ===

The city formed a parliamentary borough returning two members from 1541, with the rest of the Soke being part of Northamptonshire parliamentary county. The Great Reform Act did not affect the borough, although the remaining, rural portion of the Soke was transferred to the northern division of Northamptonshire. In 1885, the borough&#x27;s representation was reduced to one member, and in 1918, the boundaries were adjusted to include the whole Soke. Recent Members of Parliament for Peterborough have included the Conservative Sir Harmar Nicholls (1950–1974), Labour&#x27;s Michael Ward (1974–1979), Conservative Brian Mawhinney (1979–1997), Labour&#x27;s Helen Clark (1997–2005) and Conservative Stewart Jackson, from 2005. Fiona Onasanya won the 2017 general election for Labour; Onasanya was then expelled from the Labour party in December 2018, but kept her seat as an independent until being ejected on 1 May 2019 after a recall petition, triggering a by-election, which won by Labour&#x27;s Lisa Forbes (June - November 2019). The current incumbent is Conservative Paul Bristow, who won the seat in the 2019 general election.

In 1997, the North West Cambridgeshire constituency was formed, incorporating parts of the city and neighbouring Huntingdonshire. The sitting member is the Conservative Shailesh Vara, who succeeded Sir Brian Mawhinney, former Secretary of State for Transport and Chairman of the Conservative Party, in 2005. Mawhinney, who had previously served as Member of Parliament for Peterborough from 1979, was created Baron Mawhinney of Peterborough in the county of Cambridgeshire later that year.

=== Local government ===

From 1889, the ancient Soke of Peterborough formed an administrative county in its own right with boundaries similar, although not identical, to the current unitary authority. The area however remained geographically part of Northamptonshire until 1965, when the Soke was merged with Huntingdonshire to form the county of Huntingdon and Peterborough. Following a review of local government in 1974, Huntingdon and Peterborough was abolished and the current district created by the merger of the Municipal Borough of Peterborough with Peterborough Rural District, Barnack Rural District, Thorney Rural District, Old Fletton Urban District and part of the Norman Cross Rural District, which had each existed since 1894. This became part of the non-metropolitan county of Cambridgeshire. Letters patent were granted continuing the status of city over the greater area. In 1998, the city became autonomous of Cambridgeshire county council as a unitary authority, but it continues to form part of that county for ceremonial purposes. The leader and cabinet model of decision-making, first adopted by the city council in 2001, is similar to national government.

Policing in the city remains the responsibility of Cambridgeshire Constabulary; and firefighting, the responsibility of Cambridgeshire Fire and Rescue Service. The Peterborough Volunteer Fire Brigade, founded in 1884, is unique in the United Kingdom in that it functions as a retained fire station, under the control of the county fire and rescue service, but with unpaid firefighters. The Royal Anglian Regiment serves as the county regiment for Cambridgeshire. Peterborough formed its first territorial army unit, the 6th Northamptonshire Rifle Volunteer Corps, in 1860.

=== Health service ===
Following the Health and Social Care Act 2012, Cambridgeshire and Peterborough Clinical Commissioning Group became the main commissioner of health services in the city. Adult social care functions of NHS Peterborough transferred back to the city council in 2012 and public health transferred in 2013. The responsibility of guided primary care services (general practitioners, dentists, opticians and pharmacists) transferred to NHS England. In 2017 the responsibility for commissioning Primary Care Services transferred back to the CCG. Cambridgeshire and Peterborough is one of the largest CCGs in the England with over 984,000 registered patients, 91 GP practices and a budget of £1.16bn in 2017–18. Although predominately providing health services in Cambridgeshire and Peterborough the CCG also has practices in both Hertfordshire and Northamptonshire.

Previously, NHS Peterborough (the public-facing name of Peterborough Primary Care Trust) guided primary care services in the city, directly provided adult social care and services in the community such as health visiting and physiotherapy and also funded hospital care and other specialist treatments. Prior to the formation of the PCT, the North West Anglia Healthcare NHS Trust provided health functions within the city and before that, Peterborough Health Authority.

Peterborough and Stamford Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust became one of the first ten English NHS foundation trusts in 2004 and in 2017, merged with Hinchingbrooke Health Care NHS Trust to form North West Anglia NHS Foundation Trust. Although a £300 million health investment plan has seen the transfer of the city&#x27;s two hospitals into a single site, the Trust has been plagued by financial problems since the move. The full planning application for the redevelopment of the former Edith Cavell Hospital was approved by the council in 2006. Planning permission for the development of an integrated care centre on the site of the former Fenland Wing at Peterborough District Hospital was granted in 2003. The City Care Centre finally opened in 2009 and the first patients were treated at the new Peterborough City Hospital in 2010. The private Fitzwilliam Hospital run by Ramsay Health Care UK is situated in the landscaped grounds of the Milton Estate. Cambridgeshire and Peterborough NHS Foundation Trust, a designated University of Cambridge teaching trust, provides services to those who suffer from mental health problems. Following merger of the Cambridgeshire Ambulance Service in 1994, then the East Anglian Ambulance NHS Trust in 2006, the East of England Ambulance Service NHS Trust is responsible for the provision of statutory emergency medical services (EMS) in Peterborough. The East Anglian Air Ambulance provides helicopter EMS across the region.

=== Public utilities ===
The council&#x27;s budget for the financial year 2018–19 is £418.7 million. The main source of non-school funding is the formula grant, which is paid by central government to local authorities based on the services they provide. This was reduced by nearly 40% during the course of the 2010-15 parliament. The remainder, to which the police and fire authorities (and parish council where this exists) set a precept, is raised from council tax and business rates. This amounts to £59.5 million in 2015–16. Mains water and sewerage services are provided by Anglian Water, a former nationalised industry and natural monopoly, privatised in 1989 and now regulated by OFWAT.

Following deregulation, the consumer has a choice of energy supplier. Electricity was formerly provided by Eastern Electricity, which was privatised in 1990. In 2002, the supply business was sold to Powergen (now E.ON UK) and the distribution rights to EDF Energy who sold them to UK Power Networks in 2010. Natural gas was (and still is) supplied by British Gas, which was privatised in 1986; distribution (and gas and electricity transmission) is the responsibility of the National Grid, having been demerged as Transco in 1997. These industries are regulated by OFGEM. Peterborough Power Station is a 367 MWe gas-fired plant in Fengate operated by Centrica Energy.

British Telecommunications, privatised in 1984, provides fixed ADSL enabled (8 Mbit/s) telephone lines. Local loop unbundling, giving other internet service providers direct access, is completed at four out of 12 exchanges. The city is cabled by Virgin Media (previously Peterborough Cablevision, Cable &amp; Wireless and NTL). These businesses are regulated by OFCOM. Cambridgeshire County Council and Peterborough City Council are embarking on a superfast broadband project to deliver access to improved connectivity to areas where it is acknowledged that the market is unlikely to deliver.

==2016 EU Referendum==

On Thursday 23 June 2016 Peterborough voted in the 2016 EU Referendum under the provisions of the European Union Referendum Act 2015 where voters were asked to decide on the question &quot;Should the United Kingdom remain a member of the European Union or leave the European Union?&quot; by voting for either &quot;Remain a member of the European Union&quot; or &quot;Leave the European Union&quot;. The result produced a large &quot;Leave&quot; majority by 61% of voters on a turnout of 72% across the city with only the wards of Peterborough Central, Barnack and late postal votes in the city council area returning &quot;Remain&quot; votes and all other wards returning &quot;Leave&quot; majority votes. Stewart Jackson, the then MP for the parliamentary constituency of Peterborough, backed &quot;Leave&quot;. Shailesh Vara, MP for the neighbouring constituency of North West Cambridgeshire which includes a substantial part of the city, campaigned for a &quot;Remain&quot; vote.

<text>Wawrzyniec Goślicki (between 1530 and 154031 October 1607), in Latin called Laurentius Grimaldius Goslicius, was a Polish nobleman, Bishop of Poznań (1601–1607), political thinker and philosopher best known for his 1568 book &quot;De optimo senatore&quot;.

==Biography==

He was the son of Paweł Goślicki and Ewa Kamieniecka. Born near Płock, after studying at Kraków&#x27;s Jagiellonian University and at Padua and Bologna, he entered the Roman Catholic Church. In 1569 he joined the Polish royal chancery and as a secretary served two kings, Sigismund II Augustus and Stefan Batory, and was successively appointed bishop of Kamieniec Podolski (1586), Chełm (1590), Przemyśl (1591), and Poznań (1601). Goślicki was a man of affairs, highly esteemed by contemporaries, and frequently engaged in active politics. He was also a staunch advocate of religious tolerance in Poland. It was due to his influence and to a letter that he wrote to the Pope against the Jesuits that they were prevented from establishing schools at Kraków during his reign. He was the only prelate who, in 1587, acceded to the Warsaw Confederation.

Goślicki&#x27;s Latin book &quot;De optimo senatore&quot; (published during his stay in Italy in Venice, 1568) and dedicated to King Zygmunt August, subsequently appeared in four English translations: as &quot;The Counsellor&quot; ( considered inaccurate) in 1598, &quot;A commonwealth of good counsaile&quot; in 1607, &quot;The Accomplished Senator... Done into English... By Mr. Oldisworth&quot; in 1733, and most recently as &quot;The Accomplished Senator&quot; in K. Thompson&#x27;s translation in 1992. The book proved immensely important in Britain among forces opposed to the Tudor monarchy; it was widely quoted and cited in opposition pamphlets and leaflets during the period leading up to the British Civil Wars of the 1640s.

In this book Goślicki shows the ideal statesman who is well versed in the humanities as well as in economy, politics, and law. He argued that law is above the ruler, who must respect it, and that it is illegitimate to rule over a people against their will. He equated godliness with reason, and reason with law. Many of the book&#x27;s ideas comprised the foundations of the Polish Nobles&#x27; Democracy (1505–1795) and were based on 14th-century writings by Stanisław of Skarbimierz. The book was not translated into Polish for 400 years.

The book was influential abroad, exporting the ideas of Poland&#x27;s Golden Freedom and democratic system. It was a political and social classic, widely read and long popular in England after its 1598 translation; read by Elizabeth I of England, it was also known by Shakespeare, who used his depiction of an incompetent senator as a model for Polonius in &quot;Hamlet&quot;. Its ideas might be seen in the turmoil that gripped England around the times of the Glorious Revolution. Goślicki&#x27;s ideas were perhaps suggestive for future national constitutions. He never wrote that &quot;all men are created equal,&quot; but did say, &quot;Sometimes a people, justly provoked and irritated, by the Tyranny and Usurpations of their Kings, take upon themselves the undoubted Right of vindicating their own liberties.&quot; The book was allegedly read by Robert Bellarmine, Algernon Sydney and Thomas Jefferson (who had it in his library), but there is no evidence of a direct link with Jefferson&#x27;s Declaration of Independence.

Goślicki argued that distinguished senators were more useful to a state than the king or the common people:
:For the king, being alone, cannot see everything and it often happens that either he yields to desires or his emotions disturb his ability of discretion. Also an ignorant crowd without a thought and head (as a proverb says) cannot by any means possess such prudence, while the senate, composed of men distinguished by virtue, prudence, and glory of accomplished deeds is capable from its middle position, as if from an observation point, of caring for the common weal of the state, perceiving those matters which are beneficial, and freeing it from disturbances, rebellions, and dangers.

He was an influence in the framing the Polish Constitution of 3 May 1791, which historian Norman Davies calls &quot;the first constitution of its kind in Europe&quot;.

<doc id="358103" wikidata="Q435481" url="?curid=358103" title="Michelle Shocked">
<text>Michelle Shocked (born Karen Michelle Johnston; February 24, 1962) is an American singer-songwriter. Her music has entered the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, been nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Contemporary Folk Album, and received an award for Folk Album of the Year at the CMJ New Music Awards.

==Early life==
Shocked was born Karen Michelle Johnston on February 24, 1962, in Dallas, Texas, at the Baylor University Medical Center. Her stepfather was in the US Army and the family moved from base to base, eventually settling in Gilmer, Texas. She was raised in a Mormon family. Johnston went through a punk rock phase, wearing a Mohawk hairdo and squatting in abandoned buildings in San Francisco, California.

==Career==
In 1984, Johnston adopted the stage name &quot;Michelle Shocked&quot;, a play on the expression &quot;shell shocked&quot;, she said in a 1992 interview with &quot;Green Left Weekly&quot;: &quot;The term &#x27;Miss shell shocked&#x27; is a direct reference to the thousand-yard stare, which was a term that they first used to describe the victims of shell-shock in World War I. &quot;I first used that name in 1984 at the Democratic Convention in San Francisco where I was arrested for protesting and demonstrating against corporations who contribute money to both the Democratic Party and the Republican Party campaigns.&quot;

Shocked received her first international exposure after Pete Lawrence recorded her performance on a portable tape recorder at the Kerrville Folk Festival in Texas. Lawrence released the tape in Europe as &quot;The Texas Campfire Tapes&quot; (1986) (later released as &quot;The Texas Campfire Takes&quot;). The album&#x27;s success brought major labels asking her to sign a contract. Shocked was resistant to what she saw as the machinations of the music industry, and worked to retain a degree of creative control.

=== Mercury trilogy ===
Her first US success came with the release of her 1988 debut album, &quot;Short Sharp Shocked&quot;, on college radio rotations around the country, which was met with strong acclaim from listeners. The debut single, &quot;Anchorage&quot;, charted on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, but a follow-up single from the album, &quot;When I Grow Up&quot;, did not chart. &quot;Short Sharp Shocked&quot; was the first album in what Shocked later described as a &quot;trilogy&quot; for Mercury Records.

The second album in the trilogy, &quot;Captain Swing&quot;, was released in 1989. Described by reviewer Chris Woodstra as an album of &quot;swing and big-band music&quot; that &quot;no one expected,&quot; the album was promoted with the release of &quot;On the Greener Side&quot;, whose music video is a gender-reversed parody of Robert Palmer&#x27;s 1986 video for &quot;Addicted to Love&quot;, in which topless male models performed the motions made famous by the female models in Palmer&#x27;s video.

The trilogy concluded with her 1992 album, &quot;Arkansas Traveler&quot;. Her desire to have the cover portray her in blackface in tribute to the roots of the music featured on the album drew criticism and a change in the cover art. However, the album received little commercial notice, and Shocked parted ways with the label following an acrimonious lawsuit.

=== Post-Mercury years ===
In 1995, Shocked contributed an original song to the soundtrack for the film &quot;Dead Man Walking&quot; called &quot;Quality of Mercy.&quot; In 1996, she released a studio version of &quot;Kind Hearted Woman&quot; on the short-lived Private Music label.

Starting in 2002 with the release of &quot;Deep Natural&quot;, Shocked established her own label, Mighty Sound. She reissued expanded versions of her entire catalog, made possible by having retained complete ownership of her work when she signed with Mercury in 1987.

An acoustic version of her song &quot;How You Play the Game&quot; was featured as the opening and credits soundtrack on the DVD of the 2004 documentary film &quot;Bush&#x27;s Brain&quot;.

Shocked continued to make music as an independent artist. In June 2005, she released a trilogy of albums called &quot;Threesome&quot; (&quot;Don&#x27;t Ask Don&#x27;t Tell&quot;, &quot;Mexican Standoff&quot; and &quot;Got No Strings&quot;). In May 2007, she released the album &quot;ToHeavenURide&quot;; and in September 2009, &quot;Soul of My Soul&quot;.

&quot;Soul of My Soul&quot; remains Shocked&#x27;s last released recording to date. She toured consistently through 2013, then took time off before resuming live performances and touring in 2016.

Shocked is a vocal critic of Spotify and its low pay rates for artists, declaring that &quot;None of my music will be on there until they commit to a sustainable rate rather than suing songwriters.&quot; She has also refused to allow her music to be on iTunes, YouTube, or Amazon Music.

==Personal life==
Shocked&#x27;s younger brother is the musician and multi-instrumentalist Max Johnston, of Uncle Tupelo, Wilco and the Gourds.

In 1992, Shocked married journalist Bart Bull. They divorced in 2004. She reported in 2007 that she was in a relationship with Disney artist David Willardson, with whom she had first worked in 2001 when he designed the branding for her record label Mighty Sound. Willardson has since designed album covers for &quot;Deep Natural&quot; and for Shocked&#x27;s album reissues. Willardson and Shocked share an artist&#x27;s studio in the Biscuit Company Lofts.

According to &quot;Gay 100&quot; author Paul Russell, in 1989 she joked to a US broadcast television audience that the Grammy award for Best Contemporary Folk Recording, whose nominees included herself, eventual winner Tracy Chapman, Phranc, and Indigo Girls, should have been called &quot;Best Lesbian Vocalist&quot;. Shocked herself remembers that she joked the award &quot;could have been called &#x27;They Might Be Lesbians&#x27;&quot;.

After an Earth Day performance in Chicago in April 1990, she gave an interview to Christie L. Nordhielm of &quot;Outlines&quot;, a Chicago newspaper for the gay community. Accompanied by future husband, journalist Bart Bull, she told Nordhielm she felt boxed in by listener expectations that she was either straight or gay; she said &quot;I would like a much broader definition for myself.&quot; She explained her wish to be politically and sexually subversive by saying, &quot;I resent like hell that I was maybe 18 years old before I even heard the &#x27;L&#x27; word. I mean, that&#x27;s understood, growing up sheltered in a Mormon environment. But it would have made all the difference for me had I grown up knowing that the reason I didn&#x27;t fit in, was because they hadn&#x27;t told me there were more categories to fit into.&quot; She said she did not condone the outing activities engaged in by members of ACT UP.

Since then, Shocked has been listed as bisexual in reference books, and does not self-identify as a lesbian. In a 2013 interview with CNN, Shocked stated &quot;I am, for the last 10 years, so deeply in love with a man that the idea of living my life without him is impossible. I know how much I love him, and knowing that passion that I have for him, would I ever want to deny that to anyone else? Absolutely not.&quot;

===Religion and views on homosexuality===
While performing at the Wild Goose Festival in June 2011, a Christian event at which the inclusion of gay Christians was debated, Shocked responded to an audience member&#x27;s question about homosexuality by saying &quot;Who drafted me as a gay icon? You are looking at the world&#x27;s greatest homophobe. Ask God what He thinks.&quot;

On March 17, 2013, Shocked made an impromptu speech against same-sex marriage during a concert at Yoshi&#x27;s nightclub in San Francisco, which led some audience members to leave in protest and the club&#x27;s management to end the show. All venues eventually cancelled scheduled performances of her &quot;Roadworks Tour&quot; in response to reports of Shocked&#x27;s remarks. In a March 20, 2013, email to the news media, Shocked apologized, saying that her comments had been misinterpreted, and that she was not describing her own opinions about homosexuality, but rather those of some Christians. An audio recording of the performance was reported as contradicting Shocked&#x27;s post-performance explanation.

On April 1, 2013, Shocked appeared on CNN&#x27;s &quot;Piers Morgan Live&quot; to clarify her remarks. Morgan asked Shocked three times whether she was &quot;homophobic&quot;. Eventually, Shocked stated &quot;If you want to keep this simple for the audience, let me just give you a straight no, I&#x27;m not homophobic. But the truth, I don&#x27;t think, lies in the simplicity. It&#x27;s in the nuance, and that&#x27;s been completely lost in this.&quot; She said that the meaning behind her prior comments was misinterpreted.

===Political activity===
A photograph of Shocked being detained during a protest that appears on the cover of her 1988 album &quot;Short Sharp Shocked&quot; was taken by Chris Hardy of the &quot;San Francisco Examiner&quot; at a protest in San Francisco during the 1984 Democratic National Convention. Years later, Shocked was arrested during the November 29, 2011, eviction of the Occupy Los Angeles movement.

==Awards==
Shocked was honored as having the Folk Album of the Year at the CMJ New Music Awards ceremony in late October 1989, taped in New York City for later broadcast. The award recognized the popularity of &quot;Short Sharp Shocked&quot; with college radio listeners.

<text>The barred owl (Strix varia), also known as the northern barred owl, striped owl or, more informally, hoot owl or eight-hooter owl, is a North American large species of owl. A member of the true owl family, Strigidae, they belong to the genus &quot;Strix&quot;, which is also the origin of the family&#x27;s name under Linnaean taxonomy. Barred owls are largely native to eastern North America, but have expanded their range to the west coast of North America where they are considered invasive. Mature forests are their preferred habitat, but they can also acclimatise to various gradients of open woodlands. Their diet consists mainly of small mammals, but this species is an opportunistic predator and is known to prey upon other small vertebrates such as birds, reptiles, and amphibians, as well as a variety of invertebrates.

Barred owls are brown to gray overall, with dark striping on the underside. Barred owls have typical nesting habits for a true owl, tending to raise a relatively small brood often in a tree hollow or snag (but sometimes also in other nesting sites) in forested areas. As a result of the barred owl&#x27;s westward expansion, the species has begun to encroach on the range of the related and threatened spotted owl (&quot;Strix occidentalis&quot;). Evidence shows the assorted threats posed by the invading barred species are only increasing. In response, biologists have recommended culling operations to mitigate the negative effect of the barred on the spotted owl species.

== Basics ==
The barred owl was first described by Philadelphia naturalist Benjamin Smith Barton in 1799. The species was named due to the varied directions the dusky markings take on their underside.

The barred owl is roughly intermediate in size between the larger Ural and the smaller tawny owl, but the structural features of its relatively short and decurved claws more so resemble the tawny species as does their dietary and habitat ecology. The spotted owl has been hypothesized to be within a superspecies with the barred owl. However, genetic testing reveals very early divergence (likely at or near their ancestor&#x27;s entry to North America) between spotted and barred owls. A fossil species once called &quot;Strix brea&quot; from the early Pleistocene in California does little to resolve the ancestry of modern species, given its ambiguous relation to any living &quot;Strix&quot;. The fossil species was larger (more similar in size and slenderness to the spotted owl, albeit with a slightly smaller skull and geographically isolated from that species) and longer-legged than either the spotted and barred owls, and is now considered to be in a separate genus, &quot;Oraristrix&quot;. Pleistocene era fossils of probable barred owls are known from Florida, Tennessee and Ontario.

=== Subspecies ===

The subspecies of the barred owl vary mostly by region, with slight to moderate variation by coloring, size and extent of feathering on the toes. Although several have been described in the past, the barred owl may include only three subspecies, subsequent to the separation of the fulvous and cinereous forms.

*&quot;S. v. varia&quot; (Barton, 1799): The northern barred owl. This race lives throughout the Northeastern United States and the Upper Midwest, ranging as far south as Oklahoma, the Carolinas and northern Georgia. It is also considered to comprise all western &quot;invader&quot; birds found as far west as California and British Columbia. However, genetic study of westerly birds show a substantial isolation, possibly up to the subspecific level, of the western and eastern populations of the northern owls, with an estimated divergence of around 7,000 years, perhaps indicating an unknown history of the species in remote forests of northern and central Canada (far west of what was considered their original distribution) that radiated more recently to comprise the western populations. This race is generally the typical mid gray-brown variety of barred owl. However, a paler variation with very washed out markings and a more pure whitish base color is known (in eastern Canada such as Quebec), formerly considered a race &quot;S. v. albescens&quot;, as well as darker and browner variation in northern Minnesota (formerly &quot;S. v. brunnescens&quot;). This race is fairly large (described as the largest race on average with the probable separation of the cinereous owl). The wing chord and tail length may measure from and in males and and in females. One nominate bird had a tarsus length of and the culmen from the cere may measure .
*&quot;S. v. georgica&quot; (Latham, 1801): The southern barred owl or, alternately, the Florida barred owl. This subspecies is found in southern North Carolina closer to the coast along to broadly through Georgia and all of Florida. This is the smallest of the three subspecies on average. Known wing chord lengths can vary from . Tail length is and the bill from the cere is . Males in Florida were found to weigh from , with averages in two samples of , while two females weighed , respectively. It therefore appears to show less pronounced sexual dimorphism than the northern barred owl race.
*&quot;S. v. helveola&quot; (Bangs, 1899): The Texas barred owl. Comprises most barred owls found in Texas. The distributional range is considered to range as far north as Lee County, east to Chambers County, west to Kerr County and south to Nueces County. In this race, the ground coloration tends to pale gingery-cream and the back and head tend to be a pale brown ranging into an almost cinnamon color. The toes can vary from rather bare to slightly bristled. This race is similar to other barred owls in size, perhaps averaging marginally smaller than those in the nominate race, but its bill and feet are larger on average than the preceding two races.

== Description ==
The barred owl is considered somewhat subdued and drab in coloration compared to the sometimes rich coloring of other sympatric owls. Overall, this owl is greyish-brown or brown. The brownish color extends from the head to the back. Barred owls are scalloped with white bars on the mantle and the back, bearing as well some whitish spotting on the wing coverts. The underside has a pale creamy gray-brown base color (ranging into dirty white in the palest individuals) overlaid about the throat and upper chest with horizontal, slightly crescent-shaped barring (hence its common name), while the belly is boldly streaked in a vertical pattern. The streaking is usually blackish, dusky brown, or sometimes rufescent- (reddish-) brown. The head is fairly large (although not especially so for a species in &quot;Strix&quot;) and rounded with no ear tufts. The facial disc is pale grayish-brown with darker yet subtle concentric lines. The bill is pale straw-yellow (occasionally showing a mild greenish tint) while the cere (a bare structure at the base of the beak) is &quot;horn-colored&quot;. Its eyes are a dark brown color; the eyes may appear intensely black in the field and, although large, are fairly closely set.

The barred owl has well-developed eye anatomy. As is typical of owls, their ocular anatomy is quite distinct from diurnal raptors especially in terms of their photoreceptor cells, as they have a very large number of rod cells in their quite sensitive retina. However, their pecten oculi is smaller relative to the size of their large ocular globe (other large owls are known to have similar pecten proportions). The vision in limited or almost no light during a laboratory study of a barred owl was found to be similar to that of other owls, including the long-eared owl (&quot;Asio otus&quot;) and the barn owl (&quot;Tyto alba&quot;). The tarsi and toes are feathered up to the dark gray, black-tipped talons. These feathers are more sparse and bristled in the southern races. On individuals with bare sections of their toes, the toes are yellowish-gray in color. The flight feathers are barred with whitish buff and brown while the tail is brown or grayish-brown with 4–5 whitish bars. Young barred owls with their second set of down feathers are fluffy brownish-white, with indistinct darker barring on their head, back and mantle. They quickly become juveniles which resemble adults but have less distinct markings (especially about the head and neck), more buff coloring overall, often some remnant down, pinkish skin and a pale, blue-green cere. Also the tail at this age may have as many as seven bands (though sometimes have four like adults). Full adult plumage is obtained via molt after about a year as well as adult bare part characteristics. A study of tail molt in Washington showed that molt tends to occur relatively quickly, and that young individuals are difficult to age by state of molt alone. Southern barred owls tend to be darker and slightly smaller than northerly ones. Rare captive and wild barred owls with albinism have been described and are pure white but tend to retain their brown eyes.

The barred owl is a large species. The adult measures anywhere from in length while the wingspan may range from . The wing area (measured by square centimeter relative to the body mass) is quite intermediate among American owls, with the wing loading being lower than larger, but proportionately small-winged larger owls and even than some smaller owls. The barred has high wing-loading. Wing-loading is related to hunting technique, with higher wing-loading owls typically hunting from a perch, with only a brief flight necessary to obtain food, whilst lower wing-loading owls often hunt their prey from active flight. As is the case in most owls, the various wing feathers of barred owls are uncharacteristically soft and bear a comb-like shape, which in turn renders their flight functionally silent during their hunts. Like most birds of prey, the female is larger than the male barred owl, sometimes described as reverse sexual dimorphism (due to the fact that males average larger than females in most non-raptorial birds).

Among standard measurements, the wing chord of grown males varies from , with an average from three sources of , the tail may measure from , with an average of and the culmen from the cere may measure from , with an average of . Meanwhile, for the female, the wing chord may range from , averaging , the tail from , averaging and the culmen from the cere , averaging . Sexual dimorphism is particularly pronounced in barred owls by body mass as males within a population are sometimes a third lighter in weight. In the nominate subspecies (&quot;S. v. varia&quot;), average weights for males have been reported as (sample size 12), (sample size 20) and (sample size unknown) in three samples. The weight range for adult males is known to vary from . The considerably larger female of the nominate subspecies has been reported to average (sample size 24), (sample size 14) and (sample size unknown). Altogether, fully-grown female barred owls may weigh from .

=== Vocalization ===
The barred owl is a powerful vocalist, with an array of calls that are considered &quot;spectacular, loud and emphatic&quot;. Calls probably carry well over . Its usual call is a series of eight accented hoots &quot;ok-ok-ok-ok ok-ok-buhooh&quot;, or the &quot;typical two-phrase hoot&quot; with a downward pitch at the end. The most common mnemonic device for remembering the call is &quot;Who cooks for you, who cooks for you all.&quot; Due to its best known call, the barred owl is sometimes colloquially referred to as &quot;Old Eight-Hooter&quot;. At 80% of study posts in Virginia, barred owls responded to playback of this call. A further call is the &quot;ascending type&quot; or the &quot;legato&quot; call, a series of variable notes ending in &quot;oo-aw&quot; or &quot;hoo-aah&quot;. At least two other variations on the legato/ascending call are known. 56% of studied owls in Virginia engaged in the ascending type call but 36% uttered only the closing notes. The isolated &quot;hoo-aah&quot;, sometimes called the &quot;inspection call&quot;, was the most common song type in north Florida and the most likely to be heard during daylight. Several other calls, although some are not dissimilar variations on the main calls, are known. Some of these vary into cackles, hoots, caws and gurgles, at times described as &quot;sudden demonic laughter&quot;, &quot;cat-like screams&quot; and &quot;prolonged outbursts of cackling&quot; and seem to be, among &quot;Strix&quot; species, an idiosyncrasy endemic to the barred owl.

Another call type is the &quot;mumble&quot;, a grumbling, slurred and subtle &quot;err-ERR-err&quot;, also an up-and-down &quot;twitter&quot; call at a high pitch. When agitated, this species will make a buzzy, rasping hiss about three times in three seconds, repeating every 10–30 seconds, and will click its beak together forcefully. Females and juveniles beg with high scratching &quot;skreeechch&quot; notes. The voice of the two sexes is similar, but the female has a higher-pitched voice with longer terminal notes. Of calls, 87 to 94% are identifiable to sex per one study. While calls are most common at night, the birds do call during the day as well, especially when provoked by human playback or imitation. They are more responsive than any hawk in the east to playback of calls of their own species. The barred owl is noisy in most seasons but peak vocalization times for barred owls tend to be between late January (in Florida) and early April (in Canada). Two seasonal peaks in vocalizations, one right before breeding and another after the young have dispersed, was detected in Connecticut, with peak vocalizations on nights with extensive cloud cover. Peak times for vocalizations are between 6:00pm and 6:00am, with the least frequent vocalizations around mid-afternoon.

== Distribution and habitat ==
The barred owl is distributed throughout most of the eastern United States, as well as much of southern Canada. They are found as far northeast as much of Nova Scotia (western two-thirds), New Brunswick and Sept-Îles, in much of Quebec, up to Lake Mistassini, and Ontario, up to Moosonee. The barred owl has been recorded as ended up as far north as central Labrador, though the species is not yet confirmed to breed in the province. The barred owl ranges in every part of the eastern United States continuously from northernmost Maine down throughout New England, the Mid-Atlantic states, much of the Midwest, the Southeast United States and all of Florida. They are found to as far west without substantial gaps to the limits of western Minnesota, easternmost South Dakota, the southeastern corner of Nebraska, the eastern half roughly of Kansas, most of Oklahoma and east Texas to as far west as Cisco and Burnet. Arguably and discontinuously from Texas, the species may range into central and southern Mexico but these populations are now often considered a separate species. These initial parts of the range in the eastern and central stretches would be considered as where the species is &quot;native&quot;. A wandering barred owl was once seen flying over Lake Michigan from the nearest land.

=== Range expansions ===
The remaining parts of the range are considered where the barred owl introduced itself in the last century or so. The historical lack of trees in the Great Plains presumably acted as a barrier to the range expansion, and recent increases in forests broke down this barrier. Increases in forest distribution along the Missouri River and its tributaries provided barred owls with sufficient foraging habitat, protection from the weather, and concealment from avian predators. This allowed barred owls to move westward, initially solely along other forested river corridors (e.g. the Yellowstone and Musselshell), but increases in forests in the northern Great Plains decades later would allow them to connect their eastern and western distributions across southern Canada. These increases in forests were caused by European-American settlers via wildfire suppression and ceasing the fires historically set by Native Americans, as well as by increased tree-planting.

In Canada, the barred owls with range expansion now range through southern Manitoba (excluding the southwest corner), a broad section of south-central Saskatchewan, and east-central and nearly all of western Alberta, now up to High Level. The barred owl has been present in Manitoba at least since 1886, Alberta since 1932 and Saskatchewan since 1948. However, a study in Alberta has shown that barred owls have likely been present for no less than 100 years. This owl species currently ranges through much of British Columbia, where they have been expanding their range since at least 1943, including Vancouver Island and as far north as Fort St. John. The barred owl has had a further northward expansion in the west to southeastern Alaska (Skagway to Ketchikan) and extreme southwestern Yukon. In the western United States they also range into northwestern Montana and northern Idaho. Barred owls were first verified in southwest Montana in 1909 and in northwest Montana in 1921 (although reports of the species may date back to the 1870s) but not in Idaho until 1968. Of unknown origin, barred owls have been seen in Colorado since around the turn of the 20th century. They range broadly in eastern and western Washington (reached by 1965) and western Oregon (reached by 1972) (mostly along the forested corridors hugging the montane areas of the Cascade, Olympic and Blue ranges), and northern California (reached by 1976), now down to the Redwood National Forest, the Sierra Nevada and outer San Francisco.

=== Habitat ===
The habitat used by barred owl is largely old deciduous, mixed forests and, occasionally, coniferous forests. Old growth forests are preferred due to more extensive potential nest sites, less lower-branch density to impede hunting (and perhaps superior structural complexity to aid hunting), greater security from mobbing and perhaps greater thermoregulation. They are often found in bottomland hardwood forests in the largest swath of the native breeding range, often (particularly from Virginia south and west) with deep, dark stands of oak, gum and cypress. Secondary habitat, often used during foraging forays in the south, are often oak savanna or cabbage-palm areas. Regardless of area, some variety of water is frequently present, including riparian areas or swampy ground. Closed canopy forests were preferred in a study from Oklahoma (62.8% of habitat used), followed by fallow agricultural fields (10.6%), wetlands (8.1%) and open terrain (6.2%). The latter three were visited during hunting forays, and wetlands and open terrain areas were not used outside of the breeding season. Along the Atlantic coast area from New England to New Jersey, barred owls are often found in mixed swamps areas with cedars, seldom wandering to adjacent wetlands or farmland. The species may be at home in wooded areas in mountainous regions. More upland wooded habitats, often in mixed woods containing hemlock, alder, poplar, pine and oak, are typical in the northern part of the range. A study in northern New Jersey found at least 15 species of both conifer and deciduous trees were routinely used for differing purposes. In Michigan, barred owl habitat usually consists largely of some combination of hemlock and maple trees, with mixed forest usage being use disproportionately to its prevalence in the environment. Large oak stands were preferred in Minnesota, a bit ahead of mixed forest and far ahead of white cedar swamps and other habitat types, which were either too dense, too open or had too few attractive nesting sites.

Barred owls are not confined to extensive forest, also dwelling extensively in semi-open wooded areas, locally in large parks with mature trees, and in forest adjacent regions recently logged. Recent studies show suburban neighborhoods can be ideal habitat for barred owls, and the species may be considered a local synanthrope. Using transmitters, scientists found that some regional populations, such as in Charlotte, North Carolina, increased faster in the suburban settings than in old growth forest. A factor of this suburban success may be easily accessible rodent prey in such settings. However, for breeding and roosting needs, this species needs at least some large trees and can be locally absent in some urban areas for this reason. The increased offspring offset the death rate due to impacts from cars, other types of collisions and disease. Similarly, in Piedmont, South Carolina, productivity of the owls was higher in suburban areas and they comprised 41% of the territories of the local owls but various sorts of anthropogenic mortality were seemingly higher. In suburban areas of Ohio, 41.4% of barred owl range was forested, 29.8% was low-density residential areas and less than 15% was pasture. On the other hand, studies from the Northeastern United States, such as in New Jersey, found barred owls breeding mainly in plots of old-growth woodlands, and rarely successfully breeding in peri-urban areas, in part because of competitive and predatory displacement by great horned owls. Furthermore, a study in North Carolina showed most barred owls appear to favor areas with at least of woods but did not seem to be affected by the presence of roadways.

In the Pacific Northwest, they can be quite adaptive to secondary forests. On the other hand, in Ontario where the barred owl is native, secondary forest seemed to be largely avoided per a study. In the recent western part of the range, barred owls often dwell in mixed wood areas, often where there are lowland stands of balsam poplar, trembling aspen and white spruce, occasionally but not commonly in pure conifer boreal stands. Barred owls in California preferred stands of red alder. More so confined to inland areas, as in eastern Washington, Idaho, Manitoba and Montana, they prefer Douglas fir, ponderosa pine, paper birch, burr oak and western larch. In north-central Alberta, the use of old growth forest was far more prevalent than its occurrence in the wild. In the Cascades Range of Washington, barred owls usually dwell in areas with more grand firs, taller and more diverse tree heights, more enclosed canopies, higher numbers of trees per acre and less ground cover. In Saskatchewan, barred owls preferred areas with a minimum of 66% forest cover.

== Behavior ==
The barred owl, like most owls, is largely adapted to nocturnality. Between 5:00am and 8:00 pm, juvenile barred owls were recorded to sleep an average of 28% of each hour. Peak times in Minnesota were found to be right after sunset and just before dawn. Nonetheless, they are not as fully nocturnal as many owls and rank around 6th amongst 19 regular North American owl species for the regularity of their activity outside of nightfall, especially in particular circumstances such as when a rival or a human impersonator is emitting barred owls calls or whilst hunting. Often daytime activity tends to be early in the morning or around dusk but potentially at any time (overcast days being preferred). This species often spends the daytime hidden away in the dense foliage of a tree, often at minimum above the ground, but sometimes also roosts in a branch close to a broad trunk or in a natural tree hollow. Roost tree heights in Minnesota was typically while, in Illinois, they were up to . Recently fledged owls sometimes roost in tall grass, usually after falling from the nest tree.

Roost site selection may be partially dictated by thermoregulation, as in spotted owls, with shadier roosts likely to mitigate heat stress. They seldom rely on camouflage, instead often flying at the least disturbance and not allowing close approaches, making them potentially difficult to observe. Yet, on the other hand, they can be surprisingly tame and seemingly curious of people in the wild; further they are considered &quot;as mild and engaging&quot; as a predator can be. Barred owls are regularly subject to mobbing by small birds, from several small passerines to corvids and woodpeckers, and mammals when discovered by them during the daytime, and such situations may lead to them being attacked by diurnal birds of prey. There are some records of barred owls engaging in allopreening, presumably between pairs, with each other in the wild. They are skilled and silent fliers and frequently use routine forest flyways with open understory and low branch densities.

Like most species of owl in the &quot;Strix&quot; genus, the barred owl tends to be highly territorial regardless of the time of year. The territories are claimed by singing from different perches, often near the perimeter of its perceived home range. The boundaries are almost always well-maintained by barred owls and are generally stable from year to year and even generation to generation. Territory sizes have been determined via radio telemetry. The average territory size of 13 in Minnesota was , of 7 in Michigan it was and of 10 in Wisconsin was . Another Minnesota study found pairs to occupy a mean of about in mixed hardwood-conifer woods. Pairs in an Oklahoma study were reportedly found every . The mean territory size from 10 studies was estimated from throughout the range. In this study, the breeding season mean area was calculated at in males and in females; whereas the means in nonbreeding season were in males and in females. Overall, the annual mean home range for males was and for females was . The breeding range&#x27;s mean home size in Washington was , while it was in the non-breeding season.
The ranges of pairs overlaps in the breeding season, at 87–95% range overlap, but decreases down to 45% after hatching. In a Florida study of barred owls, territorial responses, including several duets, by a pair were found to be provoked by researchers playing calls of both &quot;stranger&quot; owls and recordings of owls that were neighbors to the pair being tested. The aggressive response even to known neighbors in this study is unusual. In tawny owls in a study from Italy, for instance, they responded mildly or not at all to the calls of neighboring tawny owls known to them but with great aggression to the calls of &quot;stranger&quot; owls. Due to its rather stolidly territorial nature, the barred owl is not normally a migratory species. Claims in the past of &quot;rather impressive&quot; flights in New England in the past were lacking in verifiable details. Of 158 banded recoveries in the northern part of the range, movements during winter were found to cover no further than , while all those recovered in Saskatchewan and Alberta scarcely moved at all. There is little to no evidence of nomadic behavior as has been recorded in several other owls in the north.

== Dietary biology ==
Barred owls are opportunistic predators of the woodlands. Like the tawny owl, the barred owl usually hunts from a perch. During hunting efforts, they glide briefly from perch to perch until prey is detected. The barred owl has incredibly large eyes that capture as much light as possible, allowing for better night vision. Attacks may be carried out merely away from the prey due to the effectiveness of the silencing wing feathers. The barred owl, especially compared to the predominantly arboreal prey of the spotted owl, usually prefers to target small animals that are terrestrial. However, barred owls will also flush and capture night-roosting birds, and capture bats on the wing as well. Daytime hunting has been reported several times, although peak hunting time is typically shortly after sunset. Although they usually hunt within woodlands, they also occasionally hunt in open terrain, more typical of the hunting areas of a bird like the long-eared owl. Cases of snow-plunging have been verified for barred owls, allowing them to capture prey like voles in subnivean zones that they use as hidden snow tunnels during winter, a hunting method once thought particular to great grey owls. While hunting squirrels in the Foothill Model Forest of Alberta, barred owls were seen to make several passes before succeeding. Hunting on the ground is usually done to obtain foods such as invertebrates or amphibians. These owls may wade into shallow water to capture fish and may do an unusual amount of aquatic foraging, as compared to any &quot;Strix&quot; species or North American owl.

Due to its relatively modest foot size, it does not usually take particularly large prey. However, owls in general have proportionately larger feet and more powerful grips than similarly sized diurnal raptors, while the physiology of the daytime raptors differs. While the mechanism of the killing feet overlap, owls kill mainly with constriction and sacrifice velocity with their physiology while diurnal raptors have higher velocity and kill mainly by trauma inflicted by their enlarged talons. A majority of prey of barred owls is eaten outright but, with large prey, the barred owl may eat the head first and then return to consume the remainder of the body. Cases of owls of any variety scavenging on carrion are generally rare, but at least three instances of carrion-feeding by barred owls have been observed, more recently eating deer and squirrel roadkills on a remote camera in North Carolina. The pellet of the barred owl averages about in diameter and in length.

The barred owl has been known to consume a diversity of animals from different taxonomic classes. Primarily, these owls live off of small mammals. Other vertebrates are rarely neglected though, especially birds and amphibians, but also occasionally reptiles and fish. For an owl its size, the barred owl also consumes a large amount of arthropods and other invertebrates. One study from a wide swath of the range found that among 2234 accrued prey items, 76% were mammals, 15.8% were invertebrates, 5.8% were birds and 2.5% were other vertebrates. In four other studies from different parts of the distribution, the mean balance of mammals in diet was around 64.9%, birds at around 13.4%, invertebrates at around 11.4% and different classes of vertebrates (mostly amphibians) at around 10.3%. A compilation study that included a total of 7077 prey items using all methodologies, 71.9% were mammals, 9.5% were birds, 0.6% reptiles, 6% amphibians, 1.89% fish, 1% earthworms, 0.2% gastropods, 6.5% insects and 2.4% crayfish. Barred owls tend to focus on fairly small-sized prey, although are capable of attacking larger than usual prey in infrequent cases. The mean size of prey taken is seldom estimated in the barred owls&#x27; eastern range, although one study estimated mean size of prey in the general east was . Many more studies have estimated mean prey masses in westerly areas of sympatry with spotted owls to understand how their diets may conflict. Different studies from the west (mainly Washington and Oregon) have variously estimated the mean prey sizes for barred owls at , , , and .

=== Mammals ===
The predominant small mammals available in forest and woodland edges are generally small rodents, so the barred owl, like other &quot;Strix&quot; owls, most often relies on rodents as the primary type of food. Preferred rodents to be taken are voles, mice of the genus &quot;Peromyscus&quot; and assorted rats, including non-native &quot;Rattus&quot; species as well as unrelated native types like cotton rats, rice rats and woodrats. These all share with barred owls a penchant for nocturnality and crepuscular habits (although many voles are more correctly considered cathemeral) While during other seasons, the diet of barred owls can be fairly diverse, the winter diet may be almost wholly rodents. This was the case in winter in Montana, where 97.6% of 1153 prey items were montane voles or meadow voles, with a possible slight mixture of other voles. The diet of barred owls in a much smaller study near Urbana, Illinois during winter was less homogeneous but still led by rodents, especially the meadow vole (32.3%) and white-footed mouse (23.5%). A winter food study in Essex County, New Jersey found that among 118 prey items, meadow voles comprised a great majority of the prey, at 91.5% of the balance.

An unusual lack of diversity in barred owl pellets was found in several years of possibly an aseasonal study in Ann Arbor, Michigan where of 777 prey items, 83.3% were meadow voles. At Edwin S. George Preserve near the University of Michigan, the summer diet was also heavily rodent based, as among 146 prey items 37.9% were white-footed mice, 22.6% were southern bog lemming and 6.84% were meadow voles. In a somewhat larger Michigan study, the North American deermouse, lead the prey at 34.9% of 321 prey items. In Minnesota, the barred owl was counted as one of the leading causes of mortality of prairie voles. Studies of the barred owl diet in 6 urban metropolitan areas of British Columbia found that the diet was dominated by young rats of the invasive &quot;Rattus&quot; genus, comprising 52.8% of 688 prey items, well ahead of native Townsend&#x27;s voles, which were secondary at 19.2% of the diet. The average weight rats taken by owls were clearly juveniles, estimated to average , although several could be anywhere from infant rat to adult rat sizes, i.e. about . The mean size of black rats taken in Oregon was , indicating that here large adults of this species were selected. Beyond the typical more meadow-dwelling voles and woodland edge-dwelling native mice, larger and more forest dwelling rodents of different varieties can be of variable import. Numerous woodrat species may be taken and may provide a hearty meal to a barred owl, at a mean body mass when taken (in Oregon) of for unidentified species.

In different areas, barred owls may regularly hunt the diverse members of the squirrel family, despite their general penchant for diurnality. Smaller squirrel varieties are usually focused on when hunted as supplement prey, such as chipmunks, averaging about among the different species they prey upon, and pine squirrels, which average about twice as large as chipmunks. Usually juvenile specimens are focused on when taking the larger &quot;Sciurus&quot; tree squirrels, at least in summer, but presumably a mixture of yearling and adult &quot;Sciurus&quot; will be taken during winter. The mean weight of western gray squirrels taken during the breeding season in Oregon was , against a mean adult weight of around . The issue of temporal activities is less pertinent to the predator of flying squirrels, which are nocturnal. All studies of the diet of barred owls in Pacific Northwest show the importance of the northern flying squirrel to their diet. This flying squirrel was found to comprise from about 10.9% to 20% of the diet of barred owls (either as the most or second most important prey species) and, with a mean weight of when taken, they comprised up to 25.6% of the food biomass for this owl species. In Green Ridge State Forest in Maryland, although not numerically the most important prey family compared to unidentified cricetids and shrews, the southern flying squirrel was the most often identified prey species for barred owls. Beyond the aforementioned rodent prey, more infrequently rodent prey can including various other cricetid rodents, pocket gophers, mountain beavers (average weight when taken of up to ) and jumping mice. The largest known rodent prey of barred owls are adult muskrat, which were estimated to weigh when taken.

The other primary mammalian prey types are the shrews and the moles. At least a dozen species of shrew and most North American species of mole are known as prey of the barred owl. 12.8% of 7077 total prey items from across the range were shrews or moles. A small sample of prey in Michigan was led by the very small masked shrew, which weighs around , at 24% of 34 prey items. A much larger shrew, the northern short-tailed shrew at around , was the leading prey in Glenwood, Minnesota at 36% of 81 prey items. This prey species also is taken quite regularly in several other parts of the range, as well as a closely-related species. Assorted other shrew species and the smallest of the world&#x27;s moles, the American shrew mole are regular supplement prey elsewhere, especially in the Pacific Northwest. The most frequently taken single prey species through the Pacific Northwest, at 11.8% of 4299 total prey items of barred owls, was the coast mole. Usually, moles are secondary if relatively hearty prey elsewhere in the range.

Secondary prey can include several species of cottontail rabbits (&quot;Sylvilagus&quot; sp.) and snowshoe hares (&quot;Lepus americanus&quot;). 3.2% of 7077 prey items from across the range for barred owls were rabbits or hares. Among cottontails, small juveniles are largely taken, but rabbits as large as an adult brush rabbits can be taken. The weights of snowshoe hares taken by barred owls in the Pacific Northwest were estimated at ranging from leverets to juveniles and standard-sized adults about .

Bats are infrequently reported as prey in most of the range but an unusually close association was detected in Valdosta, Georgia, where most of the prey, 65% of pellet contents and 37 total bats, were southeastern myotis (&quot;Myotis austroriparius&quot;). Barred owls are also known predators of small mammalian carnivorans, mainly mustelids such as stoats (&quot;Mustela erminea&quot;) and long-tailed weasels (&quot;Neogale frenata&quot;). Predation on small American mink (&quot;Neogale vison&quot;) have also been reported. As they are seemingly not affected by strong odor, eastern spotted and western spotted skunks (&quot;Spilogale gracilis&quot; &amp; &quot;S. putorius&quot;) of all ages can be taken. Much larger mammals are sometimes recorded in the foods of barred owls, but there are few details known about the age, condition, or circumstances (i.e. they may have been consumed as carrion or, perhaps more likely, young or infirm specimens were taken). Some such prey species recorded have included the Virginia opossum, the North American porcupine, the striped skunk and the domestic cat. Adults of all these species are known to count amongst the prey of great horned owls which are better suited than barred owls to take particularly large prey given its more robust morphology.

=== Birds ===
Throughout the barred owl&#x27;s range, other birds are taken as prey, although avian species make up a much smaller proportion of their diets than mammals. The maximum known representation of bird prey in a barred owl food study was 25.1% in Alberta, meaning that they augment their diet less heavily with bird prey than their near equivalent in Europe, the tawny owl. No specific variety of bird is subject to the most frequent predation by barred owls and birds are the most diverse class in these owl&#x27;s prey spectrum, with more than 100 species of bird known to be hunted. Conspicuous nesting sites of barn swallow and purple martin on manmade structures and objects were revealed via video-monitoring to suffer heavy predation by barred owls. In the case of the barn swallows, all ages of swallow as well as possibly eggs were eaten. 65 of 95 monitoring barn swallow nests were consumed by owls over a 3-year period. The muddy bank nests of cliff swallows are also vulnerable to barred owls, while other swallow species are known to be opportunistically taken.

In more enclosed wooded areas, radio-tagging and video-monitoring of various passerines nests as well as examinations of owl pellets has shed light on the relationship of barred owls with these potential prey resources. Not only was the barred owl found to be a surprisingly routine predator at woodland passerine nests, but that an unexpected bulk of the acts of predation in studies from Missouri and Illinois were carried out during the daytime. Many different forest bird species (most frequently acadian flycatchers and indigo buntings in Missouri and Illinois) were hunted. These studies indicated that the barred owl may snatch passerines of any age, but recent fledglings are taken preferentially due to their more conspicuous behavior and limited ability to fly away. In Minnesota, about 62% of studied hermit thrush and ovenbird fledglings were taken per one study, with all thrush that nested in the radius of the barred owl&#x27;s nests failing to produce any young. A similarly high rate of local determent by barred owls has been found for other woodland thrushes like the veery, wood thrush and varied thrush, with the additional finding that pre-dawn singing by certain thrushes, when their escape abilities are dulled by the dim light, leaves them vulnerable to barred owl ambushes. Forest birds seem to recognize the barred owl as a threat, with mobbing behavior evoked easily by playing recordings of their calls in the daytime.
A wide diversity of bird prey may be occasionally hunted by barred owls in different circumstances. Smaller or mid-sized bird prey species known have including different species, though usually a relatively low species diversity and in low numbers, beyond swallows and thrushes of tyrant flycatchers, vireos, chickadees, wrens, mimids, tanagers, other cardinalids and finches. Somewhat higher diversity of species are known from the sparrow and warbler families. Birds down to the size of the calliope hummingbird, North America&#x27;s smallest hummingbird at , may be taken by barred owls. At the opposite end of passerine prey for barred owls, this species will sometimes take all ages of the American crow, from very young nestlings to adults. Numerous non-passerine birds are also taken, though seldom in great numbers and of low known species diversity. One exceptional family is the woodpeckers, which are probably so widely taken because of their generally overlapping habitat preferences with those of barred owls. Several species of woodpecker are preyed upon almost throughout the range, including at least a half dozen in Oregon alone, from the smallest North American species, the downy woodpecker, to the largest, the pileated woodpecker. Other small-to-medium-sized bird species known as prey for barred owls are: mountain quail, grey partridge, rock dove, band-tailed pigeon, mourning dove, purple gallinule, killdeer, American woodcock, least tern, snowy egret, cattle egret and belted kingfisher. Although they take many chicks of gamebirds, adults of these species are vulnerable as well. In many areas, ruffed grouse are not infrequently taken, comprising up to nearly 6% of prey items in Alberta. In Oregon, the weights estimated for ruffed grouse taken by barred owls varied enormously, from small chicks estimated at , to adults weighing about . Broader study in the Pacific Northwest indicated that adult ruffed grouse were mainly taken. Barred owls are also known to take adult spruce grouse of about the same size as the ruffed grouse, as well as much larger species including the common pheasant and the sooty grouse, the latter estimated to average when taken. Barred owls are also known to prey on the young of other, larger birds, such as the American white ibis and wild turkey.

=== Other prey ===
Barred owl predation on reptiles is widely reported but they seldom take large numbers in any given area. Most reported instances of such captures are of various small lizards, often of skinks in the genus &quot;Plestiodon,&quot; most often from the Midwest to the western parts of the range. Several reported instances of barred owls hunting snakes are also known, but they are perhaps even more seldom preyed upon than lizards. More than a half dozen snake species are known to be captured, several of which are colubrids, which are mostly harmless. The estimated body mass of black racer taken in Oregon was only , well under their mean mature size. However, consumption or predation on dangerous pit vipers, such as timber rattlesnakes and copperheads, by barred owls has been reported, although it is not known whether these are taken as adults. Rarer still is barred owl predation on turtles. Predation by this species was reported upon a very young river cooter, which had a carapace width of only , as well as on juvenile gopher tortoise and apparently diamondback terrapin. Much more characteristic than any reptilian prey are amphibians, with various types of frogs, salamanders and similar species reported in this owl&#x27;s foods. Amphibians were considerably more popular in the diet in western part of range, comprising 10.5% of known studies against 4.4% in the east. In total, well over 20 amphibian species have been identified in the foods of barred owls and amphibians collectively can make up to 24.5% of the local diet (as was reported in Alberta). While salamanders and newts are probably often visually discerned while scanning the forest floor, many frogs are probably hunted down by sound during their crepuscular choruses.

Amphibians are taken almost entirely during the breeding season, as they become unavailable to barred owls during the winter months. Most reported amphibian prey in Oregon were unidentified &quot;medium-sized salamanders&quot;. A diversity of frog sizes may be taken, varying potentially in size from spring peepers, which average around , to American bullfrogs, which average around in mature bullfrogs . A notable act of successful predation was carried out by a barred owl on a rough-skinned newt, which contains toxins that are often deadly to predators. Apparently, the owl was able to survive after consuming the newt. The rarest variety of vertebrate prey for barred owls is fish. However, there are several accrued accounts of fishing by these owls, including older accounts of barred owls coming to ice holes made by human fishermen and more recent accounts of possibly routine fishing by the owls on the St. Johns River in Florida, in the latter case utilizing a fishing dock as a hunting perch. At least five species of fish have been identified in the foods of barred owls, including fairly large fish like brown bullheads and largemouth bass.

The balance of assorted invertebrates in the diet of barred owls can be quite high. Although many of those found in pellets are unidentified to species, nearly 40 species of invertebrates have been found in their foods. Broad studies indicate arthropods (including millipedes and spiders but predominantly insects) in general comprise up to about 16% of the barred owl&#x27;s foods. When hunting insects, barred owls most often prefer ground-based beetles. In Oregon, 11.7% of the diet was assorted beetles (14 species were identified), being somewhat more numerous among 3686 prey items than other non-rodent prey orders. However, some insects prey such as luna moth, eastern tiger swallowtail and green darner are presumably hawked on the wing around dawn and dusk. It is known that barred owls will sometimes come hunt near manmade light sources and campfires, flying out from the perch to quickly capture flying insects that were attracted to them. Of 123 prey items found in southern Manitoba, flying Sphinx moths and flightless scarab beetles each comprised 7% (most of the remaining balance being unidentified mammals and birds). Crayfish of at least four identified species are another widely taken type of invertebrate, presumably snatched up by barred owls from shallow waterways. Crayfish seem to be exclusively taken in the east and Midwest, areas where they comprised 3.4% of all known food studies, and none at all were recorded in the western part of the range. In Missouri, annually up to 31.1% (though, in some years, 0%) of the diet was comprised by crayfish. Barred owls occasionally feed on snails and slugs, the latter especially in the Pacific Northwest. Another snail, the Pacific sideband, was surprisingly often present in the foods in Oregon as at least 135 were taken. Beyond slugs, other &quot;soft&quot; invertebrates are sometimes hunted, especially earthworms. Earthworms were most prominent in the foods of barred owls in Nova Scotia, where 27.6% of 186 video-monitored prey deliveries in Nova Scotia were worms, the most regularly delivered of all prey types there.

=== Interspecies predatory relationships ===
The barred owl&#x27;s range overlaps with multiple other predators of similar prey species. Due to the time period barred owls are active, the most interaction occurs with other owl species. Of the owls in North America, about three-quarters are reliant on similar small mammal prey, usually rodents, with a mixture of other prey genera as supplements. Other than its ecology where it today co-exists with spotted owls, however, there is some level of niche differentiation from a majority of sympatric owls. In the eastern forest biome, the barred owl is the only large owl species to dwell mainly in continuous forest areas. While many of the owls sympatric with barred owls over majority of their eastern and Midwestern range share a preference for hole-nesting, smaller hole-nesting owls usually prefer different habitats, such as the open country-dwelling barn owl and the screech owls, which usually in North America dwell at the interface of forest and open habitats. Both North American species in the &quot;Aegolius&quot; owl genus are forest-dwelling cavity nesters but are much smaller and are at entirely different trophic levels.

A singular diurnal raptor species that mirrors the barred owl at nearly all ecological levels is the red-shouldered hawk. Both species have similar distributions, habitat preferences and somewhat similar dietary habits and trophic level. They may considered as nearly nocturnal and diurnal ecological equivalents. In multiple parts of the range, including southwestern Ohio, North Carolina and northern Michigan, the paralleling habitat usage and nesting behavior of the barred owl and red-shouldered hawk has been noted. One of the few respects in which their habitat usage differs is that the barred owl is more adaptive to nesting in suburban areas if they have old growth trees that provide plentiful tree hollows. In contrast, red-shouldered hawks tend to avoid suburban areas whilst nesting, but may acclimate to these areas during the winter. Barred owls seldom alter their range throughout the year and remain more or less constrained to the stands they used during nesting. The red-shouldered hawk averages somewhat smaller and has a more limited diet than barred owls, but probably goes after dangerous prey such as snakes more regularly. Multiple occasions are recorded where the barred owl and red-shouldered hawk have nested in the same area, often within the same grove of trees, remarkably with little to no conflict. At least one nest was found including eggs from both species. When nesting near other hawks like red-tailed hawks and Cooper&#x27;s hawks, the relationship tends to be much more contentious between hawk and owl, despite barred owls sometimes sharing space or using the old nests of these hawks. A wing-clapping display by a pair of barred owls was recorded during antagonistic encounters in Manitoba with a pair of broad-winged hawks. Wing-claps were previously not recorded in this species, and when recorded for other owl species were often for the purposes of courtship displays.

One predator that is a major source of conflict for the barred owl is the great horned owl. In every part of their range, barred owls are compelled to share space with the larger owls. There is habitat partitioning between the barred owl and great horned owl that allows them to often co-exist. Great horned owls prefer various more open habitats mixed with trees, often in rather upland areas, which differs from the habitats preferred by the barred owl. If a great horned owl moves into an area, barred owls appear to avoid said areas, based on radio telemetry data. In much of the east, habitat alteration and fragmentation tends to favor the great horned owl at the expense of the barred owl. Where more continuous forest is available, however, the great horned and barred owl can occur surprisingly close to one another. In one case, a barred owl was observed to roost only from a great horned owl. In general the reforestation at the northern sections of the Great Plains have, on the contrary, benefited barred owls (and may have been a part of allowing their westward expansion) and been perhaps slightly detrimental to the great horned owl. However, even where the habitat becomes less ideal, the great horned owl is unlikely to vacate an area, unlike the barred owl which can be entirely displaced if woods become too small and fragmented. Great horned owls and barred owls have similar diets, as both are wide-ranging, large and opportunistic owls. However, the great horned owl is larger in bulk, sometimes averaging nearly twice as heavy, with much heavier, larger feet and talons. The great horned owl has a more powerful grip strength and access to a wider variety of prey than barred owls, which take fewer prey species because they occur in more limited habitats and have a smaller overall distribution. A study utilizing stable isotopes in Alberta appeared to confirm that the great horned owl preys on nearly twice as many prey species as do the barred owls of the area.

The great horned owl is indeed likely to be the greatest natural enemy of the barred owl. There are several accounts of the horned owl species preying on nestlings, fledglings and adults of the barred. Other than horned owls, predation of the barred owl seems to be fairly rare outside of the nestling age, both due to the owl&#x27;s relatively large size and their nesting habits, most often in secluded tree hollows. One more virulent nest predator is likely to be raccoons (&quot;Procyon lotor&quot;), which can nearly decimate both tree hollow and stick nest locations of almost any kind of bird, especially in peri-urban areas where they largely exist without controlling predators. Both the American marten and the fisher are known to be nest predators of barred owls, in turn appearing to cause the owls to switch nest sites. Other birds of prey may be an occasional threat to barred owls. Northern goshawks have reportedly killed both young and adult barred owls. One modern account mentions predation by a goshawk on a nestling barred owl (i.e. weight about ). A well-known instance of a goshawk attack on an adult barred owl concluded with the owl and goshawk killing one another. There are some very rare, singular cases of predation on barred owls (age unknown) by red-tailed hawks, which nonetheless generally appears to be a less menacing co-inhabitant than the goshawk. More surprisingly, a Cooper&#x27;s hawk, a smaller species of raptor, was observed to apparently prey upon a full-grown barred owl in British Columbia. An American alligator was reported to have preyed on a barred owl in at least one instance.

On the other hand, the barred owl is a significant predator of smaller raptor species as well. Most smaller owls that co-exist with barred owls are at occasional risk of predation. A particular cause of concern in intraguild predations by the barred has been their encroachment into the areas inhabited by western screech owl (&quot;Megascops kennicotti&quot;). Several instances of predation have been noted on the screech owls and the recent, unprecedented presence of the barred owls appears to have a correlation with the decline of the western screech owl in British Columbia and in Bainbridge Island, Washington. In one instance, a biologist who called in an eastern screech owl (&quot;Megascops asio&quot;) in Ohio observed it to be immediately captured and consumed by a barred owl. The barred owl is a serious predator of eastern screech owls, but is less deadly to them in general than the great horned owl. Various additional owl species known to be preyed upon by barred owls including the flammulated owl (&quot;Psiloscops flammeolus&quot;), northern pygmy owl (&quot;Glaucidium gnoma&quot;), northern saw-whet owl (&quot;Aegolius acadius&quot;) and long-eared owl (&quot;Asio otus&quot;). The interspecific owl trophic chain was perhaps most conspicuous in a case where a barred owl that was shot in New England was found to have a long-eared owl inside its stomach which in turn had an eastern screech-owl in its own stomach. More unexpectedly, barred owls may even prey on other &quot;Strix&quot; species. As many as four records of circumstantial but likely predation by barred owls on spotted owls have been reported. A likely event of predation by a barred owl on an adult great grey owl was observed. The authors hypothesized that the victim may have been a smaller male great grey owl (which can be about the same body mass as a large female barred) but this is the only known instance to date of a great gray owl being killed by another species of &quot;Strix&quot; owl. Barred owls have been known to take adults (or full-grown juveniles) of diurnal raptors as well, including snail kites, Cooper&#x27;s hawks, sharp-shinned hawks and possibly swallow-tailed kites.

== Reproduction ==
The barred owl&#x27;s preferred nest site is usually the hollow trunk of a large tree or the broken-off snag from a large tree branch. Hollows or snags may be made by any variety of sources, often due to a disease or storm, with hollows and snags large enough to accommodate these birds usually only occurring in an old-growth tree. Typically, nest sites are in rather deep and dark wooded areas, often with a well-developed understory but somewhat sparse lower branches, and may be fairly close to water. Average nest heights are between above the ground. In 25 studies from throughout the range, mean nest tree height was (lowest mean from Florida where it was ; the highest from Oregon where it was ), mean nest tree diameter was (thinnest mean in Saskatchewan at ; thickest in Washington at ), while the mean height of the tree cavity used from these studies was .

A big beech with a rotting core, encompassing a large cavity reached through a deep crevice, is an ideal nest site. The most widely reported nesting trees in breeding cards were elms (21%) and beeches (15%), followed by oaks, hickories, yellow birches, sycamores, aspens, maples and poplars. In Washington, the most often used nest trees were balsam poplar, Douglas fir and grand fir. Balsam poplar comprised 62% of known nest sites in Manitoba as well. It was found in Maryland that snags used were significantly higher than the average height of miscellaneous snags available in environment. The mean size of tree holes the owls used in Maryland was in inside diameter and in depth. These were slightly larger than the average from Michigan, which hollow used averaged in mean diameter and in mean depth. Record depth tree cavities used by barred owls was around deep from the opening on the tree. One study of cavity nesting birds in Ontario found that the barred owl preferred to nest in the most massive trees of any cavity-nester in the study area. In continuous bottomland forest, nests are often about every . Territory lines often remain the same even after the original owls are replaced entirely by a new pair. It was thought in Nova Scotia that some pairs may prospect a potential nest site as much as year before they use it. Despite usually using sickly or dying trees, some nests have found in partially hollow but still living oaks.

Usually in areas with few or no natural tree hollows, often within younger secondary forests or overharvested areas, this species will uses other birds&#x27; nests and occasionally also the dreys of squirrels. Evidence shows that the preference of barred owls for hollows and snags over bird nests is due to their earlier nest type having a more secure microclimate with better shelter (additionally, owl nests in hollows generally tend to be somewhat less vulnerable to predation than those of owls using old bird nests). Nest built by other birds that are most widely used are probably red-shouldered hawk and Cooper&#x27;s hawks, while those of red-tailed hawks, usually being in more open areas, are used secondarily outside of a local basis. In the south, nests have been found between fronds of palmetto palm leaves, in holes of broken palm stems and rotten snags of the palms. One unconventional nest was on the ground at the base of a lookout tower in Everglades National Park. Another was on the roof of a shed in Saskatchewan. Yet another was in an earthen bank in Texas. Locally, barred owls can take to nest boxes but, in general, barred owls take to these less readily than their cousin &quot;Strix&quot; owls in Europe. Suitable nesting hollows may be used quite often in subsequent years, with records of a single hollow seeing up to 25 years of barred owl use (presumably not by the same owls however). Other long-used nests were one reused in New England for 10 years by the same pair until it rotted out and while a nest box in Nova Scotia was reused 10 times over 16 years. Over 6 years in Minnesota, 14 nest boxes were reused; 7 were used once, 6 were twice and one was used three times. Like all owls, barred owls never construct their owl nest but they may press or dig slightly if soil is present or remove the top leaves from a squirrel drey.

In normal circumstances, barred owls tend to pair bond for life. Courting pairs are usually newly mature birds but also possibly widowed owls or those re-establishing existing pair bonds after the winter. During courtship, barred owl males especially may engage in nodding, bowing with half-spread wings and may wobble and twist their head from side to side. Courting pairs will often engage in duets. Copulation between pairs usually occurs in late winter, February to March, and occurs several times, probably to ensure implantation. The female enters a pre-breeding lethargy stage wherein she is fed by the male. In barred owls, egg laying occurs at two to three day intervals. Egg laying typically begins in March and runs throughout April. In more tropical locales like Florida, egg laying may occur as early as late December, though 22 were laid in between early January and early March. At similar latitudes in Texas, 22 first eggs were laid between as early as mid-February to as late as early June (although the latter may have been a replacement clutch). 23 clutches in Iowa and Illinois were initiated in between late February and late April, with roughly corresponding initial egg dates in New Jersey and probably western Maryland as well. 63 initial eggs in New England were laid between mid-March and mid-May. Further north, 38 clutches in Nova Scotia were initiated in between late March and late May, with initial clutches dates about a week later in Ontario. Normally the female lays 2 to 3 eggs, although as many as 5 is possible, directly on the base of the nest site. The mean clutch size in three broad samples from several parts of the range was between 2.22 and 2.46. In Minnesota, the mean clutch size was 2.68. The eggs are pure white, slightly rough and not glossy, and oval in shape. In 157 eggs, the length of the egg could measure from while the diameter could range from , with a mean of . 25 eggs in Nova Scotia averaged slightly smaller, at . The mean weight of the egg is around . The female alone incubates, doing so for about 28 days, while the male gathers food for her.

The female tends to closely brood the young for three weeks. Then after, she begins to hunt for the young. Both parents normally continue hunt for the young until they are about 6 weeks old and can fly well. During the first three weeks, the male does all prey deliveries, either bringing prey directly into the nest or leaves for the female at the nest entrance or on a nearby branch. The mean number of prey deliveries when the young are 6–10 days old is 2.4 per night, 1.4 when they are 11–15 days old, 3.6 when they are 16–20 days old and 2.2 when they are 21–25 days old. He will continue hunting until the young disperse. The female&#x27;s prey deliveries are much more frequent when she resumes hunting, ranging from a mean of 4.8 to 8 deliveries nightly. Male prey deliveries are often sporadically at any point through the night while female deliveries tend to be clustered immediately after sunset or just before sunrise. Barred owls have a variable reaction to human disturbance. Some parent owls remain sitting, while some leave the nest upon a person&#x27;s approach and some attack people climbing to the nest, as well as those approaching young on or near the ground. There are several accounts of barred owls engaging in fierce nest defense against humans, sometimes reportedly knocking people out of trees. However, their aggression is variable and, based on studies of similar owls like tawny and Ural owls from Europe, attacks tend to only occur when intrusions and disturbance by humans are frequent. A distraction display was recorded by a female barred owl when humans approached. In it, she spread and quivered her wings and engaged in chittering and squealing, somewhat similar to the sounds made by begging young.

The average hatchling weighs about . Like most birds, the young are initially altricial. The white down feathers that the barred owls are hatched with is replaced by white-tipped barred-buff second down at two to three weeks of age, correspondingly with growth of the wing primaries. The earlier chicks are bigger and stronger, while the latter ones may not survive if food is scarce. Size differences between barred owl nestlings may be less pronounced if the female does not begin incubation until the laying of the second egg. The larger young may fight with the younger siblings for food. The young barred owls first start moving about the nest at around this 3 week point and may start to perform threat displays if scared. Adult-like feathers begin to appear at six weeks of age, starting at the scapulars, then radiating down across the abdomen and flanks up through the upper breast, with the last wisps of down remaining for up to 4 months. The young often start exploring around the nest tree, often falling to ground, which makes them quite vulnerable to predation despite the parents&#x27; continued protection. However, the fledglings can usually clamber back up the tree using their feet and bills, constantly wing-flapping.

Fledging occurs at about 36–39 days. After that, both parents continue to hunt for the young but prey deliveries taper off as the young begin to make their first flights and practice hunting. Short flights are typical when the young barred owls are up to around 10 weeks old with longer flights commencing at about 14 weeks. By the time they are flying and hunting somewhat assuredly in early to mid-autumn, the young move away and gain independence. Dispersal of 5 young from Nova Scotia was away from their nests of origin. Furthermore, a recovered 6 month old was away from its nest of origin, while five encountered as adults were found at a distance of from the nests where they hatched. An exceptional dispersal distance from Nova Scotia was away to Stoney Creek, Ontario. The post-dispersal stage is one of great mortality among young owls. Usually juvenile owls are considered &quot;floaters&quot;, often hovering around the perimeter of fiercely defended territories for some time. In some areas, floaters may make use of nest boxes more readily than mature birds. Yearlings have been known to breed only very rarely, otherwise barred owl usually first breed when they are around two (sometimes three) years old. Therefore, around two years old is considered the age of maturity. The percentages of successful nests (i.e. at least 1 fledgling produced per attempt), per study were found to be: 86% of 22 clutches in Minnesota (with a mean of 2.42 fledglings per successful attempt), 66% of 114 clutches in Michigan (with a mean of 1.97 fledglings per successful attempt), 25% of 6 clutches in Maryland (with a mean of 1 fledgling per all attempts and 1.48 per successful attempts), 69% of 48 clutches in Nova Scotia (with a mean of 0.25 fledgling per all attempts and 2 per successful attempts) and 50% of 12 nests in Washington state. Little is known about the specific factors that dictate breeding success, but are likely to include the quality of the nesting site, the food supply in the area, the levels of disturbance from outside actors (usually humans) and the maturity of the pair.

== Longevity and parasitism ==
The barred owl is a naturally long-living bird. Some record lifespans recorded per banding studies in the wild are 18 years 2 months (initial banding Kentucky, died in Ohio) and 24 years and 1 month in Minnesota. There are several records of breeding barred owls nesting successfully for a decade or more. The record lifespan for a barred owl in captivity, where many animals can live longer without the stresses of surviving in wild conditions, was 34 years and 1 month, with six records of captive barred owls living over 30 years. Known causes of mortality are diverse, some due to predation (largely great horned owls, for nestlings to adults, and probably raccoons, for eggs, nestlings and fledglings). Some mortality is known to occur during hunting accidents. There are cases of barred owls being inadvertently killed in furbearer traps. Sometimes deaths occurs due to the defenses of prey. One barred owl was killed by the bite of an unknown rodent that was likely defending itself. Some cases of cannibalism between adult barred owls have been reported as well. This species, like other forest owls, is vulnerable to the respiratory disease aspergillosis. Spontaneous infections of West Nile fever are also known to kill wild barred owls. Barred owls were the most regularly infected with West Nile Virus of owl species in Georgia, as about 15% of studied barred tested positive (still at a lower rate than some hawks). Cases of Avipoxvirus are also known in barred owls but, as with West Nile virus, the rate of mortality to viral infection is not well-known. A case of follicular thyroid cancer was found in a wild barred owl that was unable to continue to fly. Fatty liver diseases have been recorded for barred owls in captivity. Eye lesions are fairly common in barred owls, but can be survived and possibly surgically corrected.

Parasitism is frequent in barred owls as expected for many different kinds of wild birds. The parasite load of helminths was determined to be higher in larger owls in Florida like the barred and great horned owl and lower in smaller owl species, like eastern screech owl. While parasitic infestations are not typically detected as direct mortality causes, in some severe cases complications or direct death can occur. These cases of mortality are most widely recorded in cases of toxoplasmosis, although generally owls have lower rates of dangerous &quot;Toxoplasma&quot; parasites than some other species of birds of prey. Of barred owls in one study, 26.7% had &quot;Toxoplasma gondii&quot;, the cause of toxoplasmosis, upon necropsy study, with adults having it more often than immature birds. Lethal cases of trichomoniasis are also known. The effect of other parasites are more poorly known beyond generally compromising their hosts&#x27; condition, but in one case &quot;Sarcocystis strixi&quot; may have caused paralysis in a barred owl. Other parasites recorded in barred owls include &quot;Eimeria varia&quot;, &quot;Novyella&quot;, &quot;Neodiplostomum&quot; as well as apparently rare species of &quot;Centrorhynchus&quot; and &quot;Tetrameres&quot; that were first found within barred owls. Trematode flatworms such as strigeids as well as &quot;Tylodelphys&quot; and &quot;Brachylaima&quot; are found in intermediate volume in barred owls relative to other owls. Invertebrates such as hippoboscid flies and &quot;Mallophaga&quot; are known to infect barred owls as ectoparasites but seldom at severe levels. Concern was expressed that barred owls may compromise spotted owl populations with novel parasites. However, studies of &quot;Haemoproteus&quot; in barred and spotted owls in northwestern California found that native parasites were finding a new host in barred owls and may have been transmitted from spotted to barred owls but that the barred owl acted as a poor parasite host and may have diluted the parasite levels in owl populations. Furthermore, there was no evidence found that barred owls were spreading parasites to spotted owls.

== Status ==
The barred owl is one of the most common owls in North America. Partners in Flight estimates that the barred owl may number up to 3 million individuals globally, making it, perhaps, the second most numerous North American owl behind the great horned owl and perhaps slightly ahead of other commoner species like barn owls and northern saw-whet owls. It estimated that Canada in total holds about 10,000–50,000 pairs. Canadian Maritimes had highest densities known, with 3600 pairs, being found in 80% of blocks totaling 377; this was a conspicuously higher density than that recorded in Ontario, where they were in 28% of 1824 study blocks. Iowa, Tennessee and Maryland had the highest densities of pairs apparently in the United States, being present from 39 to 47% of blocks. Throughout the year, the mean number of sightings per route is 0.12 sightings while during Christmas Bird Counts (CBC), the mean in 0.25 per route.

== Barred owl and northern spotted owl ==
Barred owls are thought to be partly responsible for the recent decline of the northern spotted owl, native to British Columbia, Washington, Oregon, and California. The 2011 Revised Recovery Plan for the Northern Spotted Owl states &quot;Based on the best available scientific information, competition from the barred owl (&quot;S. varia&quot;) poses a significant and complex threat to the spotted owl.&quot; Northern spotted owls were thought to be already declining considerably before barred owls moved into their range, mostly in sync with large-scale logging operations and land development carried out by humans, with their problems now further exacerbated by the barred species&#x27;s presence. There are ecological discrepancies between the species in areas of sympatry. While both species prefer old-growth forest areas, the spotted owls tend to live in significantly higher elevation areas in Washington&#x27;s Cascade mountains, with nest sites averaging meters above sea level against a mean of for barred owls, in areas with more steep slopes. The barred owls of the area additionally prefer wetter, more variable forest areas, down to riparian zones with limited forested land, while the spotted tended to cluster in more homogeneous upland and ancient coniferous forests. However, little is known on the feasibility or benefits of habitat maintenance that favors spotted over barred owls. Habitat management measures are hypothesized to be insufficient to mitigate the negative effect the barred owls are having. In areas where barred owls moved in within of a spotted owl nest area, 39% of spotted owls disappeared and were not seen again, while in areas still free of barred owls (so spared from this interspecific pressure), 11% of spotted owls disappeared and were not found again.
Since the 1960s, barred owls have been expanding their range westward from the eastern US and Canada. While some authors have described the expansion of barred owls into the west as &quot;natural&quot;, others state that this is a mischaracterization, as there is little to suggest that the barred owls could have reached the spotted&#x27;s range without the inadvertent aid of humans — increasing temperatures, wildlife suppression, and tree planting likely facilitated the range increase. When spotted owls and barred owls share the same area, the barred owls generally are more aggressive and out-compete the spotted owls, leading to decreased populations of the native owls. The more aggressive response of barred owls to interspecific stimuli has been verified with experiments incorporating vocalization and owl dummies. Additionally, the adult survival rates appear higher for barred owls (an estimated 91%) than for spotted owls (an estimated 82%). Therefore, the barred owl is considered &quot;demographically superior&quot;. In December 2023, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service issued a draft of a management plan indicating that hunters in the Pacific Northwest would be encouraged to shoot more than a half million barred owls. The rationale was to cull the numbers of this invasive species, to help protect native species, particularly the spotted owl which had been listed as threatened under the Endangered Species Act.

Another potential threat is that barred owls and spotted owls occasionally interbreed, creating hybrids (&quot;sparred owl&quot; or &quot;botted owl&quot;). Only 47 hybrids with barred owls (all between female barred owls and male spotted owls) were found in an analysis of more than 9,000 banded spotted owls; consequently, hybridization between these two species is considered to be &quot;an interesting biological phenomenon that is probably inconsequential compared with the real threat—direct competition between the two species for food and space&quot;. Most hybrids favor their barred owl heritage with similar and more pale overall coloring than spotted owls, though the back tends to be intermediate in color between the two and the beak coloring is variable. However, there has been much variation described. Due to variances in appearance, previously hybrids between the species were overestimated from field identification, only being certainly identified by genetic loci. Moreover, no recent hybrids could be detected in a survey of the Cascade Mountains.

== In art ==
John James Audubon illustrated the barred owl in &quot;Birds of America&quot; (published in London, 1827–1838) as Plate 46, where it is shown threatening a grey squirrel. The image was engraved and colored by Robert Havell&#x27;s London workshops. The original aquatint by Audubon is owned by the Brooklyn Museum.

<text>The Deluge was a series of mid-17th-century military campaigns in the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. In a wider sense, it applies to the period between the Khmelnytsky Uprising of 1648 and the Truce of Andrusovo in 1667, comprising the Polish theatres of the Russo-Polish and Second Northern Wars. In a stricter sense, the term refers to the Swedish invasion and occupation of the Commonwealth as a theatre of the Second Northern War (1655–1660) only; in Poland and Lithuania this period is called the Swedish Deluge (, Lithuanian: š&quot;vedų tvanas&quot;, ), or less commonly the Russo–Swedish Deluge () due to the simultaneous Russo-Polish War. The term &quot;deluge&quot; (&quot;potop&quot; in Polish) was popularized by Henryk Sienkiewicz in his novel &quot;The Deluge&quot; (1886).

During the wars the Commonwealth lost approximately one third of its population as well as its status as a great power due to invasions by Sweden and Russia. According to Professor Andrzej Rottermund, manager of the Royal Castle in Warsaw, the destruction of Poland in the Deluge was more extensive than the destruction of the country in World War II. Rottermund claims that Swedish invaders robbed the Commonwealth of its most important riches, and most of the stolen items never returned to Poland. Warsaw, the capital of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, was destroyed by the Swedes, and out of a pre-war population of 20,000, only 2,000 remained in the city after the war. According to the 2012 Polish estimates, the material damage caused by the Swedish army amounted to 4 billion złotys. 188 cities and towns, 186 villages, 136 churches, 89 palaces, and 81 castles were completely destroyed in Poland.

== Historical background ==
In 1648, Bohdan Khmelnytsky led a popular uprising of Zaporozhian Cossacks and Ukrainian peasants discontented with the rule of Polish and Lithuanian magnates. Although the initial phase of the rebellion ended (after much destruction) at the Battle of Berestechko (1651), it brought into focus the rivalry between Russia and the Commonwealth for hegemony over Ukraine and over the eastern Slavic lands in general. Thus, in October 1653, the Russian Zemsky Sobor declared war on the Commonwealth, and in June 1654 the forces of Tsar Alexis of Russia invaded the eastern half of Poland-Lithuania, starting the Russo-Polish War of 1654–1667. In the summer of 1654, the Russians managed to capture most important cities and strongholds of today&#x27;s Belarus. Smolensk was captured after a siege on October 3, 1654. The Swedish Empire, which technically already was at war with the Commonwealth (a ceasefire agreement existed from 1629 and was prolonged from 1635 to 1661), invaded in July 1655 and occupied the remaining half of the country.

== Swedish invasion ==
===Background===
Following the Thirty Years&#x27; War, the Swedish Empire emerged as one of the strongest kingdoms on the continent. It had a large army but little money to pay its soldiers. The Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, weakened by wars with the Cossacks and Tsardom of Russia, seemed like easy prey, also because its best soldiers had been either killed in the 1652 Battle of Batih or massacred after it. Furthermore, Swedes remembered claims to their throne by Polish kings Sigismund III Vasa and his sons Władysław IV Vasa and John II Casimir, who themselves belonged to the House of Vasa. An earlier conflict, the Polish–Swedish War (1626–1629) had ended with the Treaty of Stuhmsdorf.

The Polish–Lithuanian King John II Casimir (reigned 1648–68) lacked support among the Commonwealth nobility () due to his sympathies with absolutist Austria and his open contempt for the &quot;Sarmatist&quot; culture of the nobility. Earlier, in 1643, John Casimir had become a member of the Jesuits and had received the title of Cardinal. Nevertheless, in December 1646, he returned to Poland and, in October 1647, resigned his position as Cardinal to stand for election to the Polish throne, after the death of his brother Władysław IV Vasa. He became King in 1648. However, some of the nobility supported Charles Gustav (King of Sweden from 1654 to 1660 and John Casimir&#x27;s cousin) for the Polish–Lithuanian throne. Many members of the Polish nobility regarded John Casimir as a weak king or a &quot;Jesuit-King&quot;; Grand Treasurer Bogusław Leszczyński, a Protestant, and Deputy Chancellor of the Crown Hieronim Radziejowski, an old enemy of the Polish King who had been exiled to Sweden, encouraged Charles Gustav to claim the Polish crown. Two Lithuanian noble princes, Janusz Radziwiłł and Bogusław Radziwiłł, introduced dissension into the Commonwealth and began negotiations with the Swedish king Charles X Gustav of Sweden aimed at breaking up the Commonwealth and the Polish–Lithuanian union. They signed the Treaty of Kėdainiai (1655), which envisaged the Radziwiłł princes ruling over two duchies carved out from the Grand Duchy of Lithuania under Swedish protection.

=== 1655 ===

In July 1655 two Swedish armies, operating from Swedish Pomerania and the Province of Pomerania, entered Greater Poland, one of the richest and most developed provinces of the Commonwealth, which had for centuries been unaffected by any military conflicts, and whose had not been used to fighting. Greater Poland&#x27;s noble camp, located in the valley of the Noteć river, near the town of Ujście, looked more like a large party, as the , gathered there to face the Swedish Army, was more interested in drinking. To make matters worse, two powerful magnates, the Voivode of Poznań Krzysztof Opaliński, and the Voivode of Kalisz, Andrzej Karol Grudziński, argued with each other whether to fight or to give up. Polish troops lacked gunpowder, cannons, and even food, which was stolen at local villages by hungry soldiers.

After an easy Swedish victory at the Battle of Ujście, Krzysztof Opaliński surrendered Greater Poland to Charles Gustav. On July 31, 1655, the army commanded by Arvid Wittenberg captured Poznań, and on August 20 near Konin, the armies of Wittenberg and Charles Gustav joined forces, and headed for Warsaw. On September 2, the Poles lost the Battle of Sobota, and on September 4, the Swedes captured Łowicz. Four days later, the Swedish army entered the Polish capital, becoming the first foreign army in history to capture Warsaw. King Charles Gustav left a garrison in Warsaw, under Bengt Gabrielsson Oxenstierna, and headed southwards, in pursuit of John Casimir. On September 16, the Swedes defeated Polish troops in the Battle of Żarnów, and the Polish forces gave up resistance and surrendered to the invaders. The Polish king headed towards Kraków on September 25, and then fled to the Głogówek castle near Prudnik in Upper Silesia. Kraków was left in the hands of Stefan Czarniecki; on October 3 Swedish forces once again defeated the Poles in the Battle of Wojnicz, which opened the road to Kraków. The ancient capital of Poland was captured after a siege, on October 13, 1655. With the three most populated and best developed Polish provinces in his hands (Greater Poland, Lesser Poland and Mazovia), Charles Gustav decided to head back northwards to Royal Prussia, which was defended by the Voivode of Malbork, Jakub Wejher. The Swedes, who were generally superior in training, discipline, and equipment, advanced rapidly.
Meanwhile, in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, whose eastern part had been occupied by another Swedish army under Magnus Gabriel De la Gardie since August 1655, Janusz Radziwiłł and his cousin Bogusław Radziwiłł signed the Union of Kėdainiai (October 20, 1655), which ended Lithuania&#x27;s union with Poland. The decision of the Radziwiłłs was the result of the 1654 Russian invasion, as Janusz Radziwiłł accused the Poles of not helping the Lithuanians with the defence of the Grand Duchy. The Russian capture of Vilnius (August 9, 1655) and the subsequent slaughter of its residents convinced the Lithuanian nobility that Swedish protection was the best solution. The situation of the Commonwealth was desperate, but hope appeared with the Truce of Vilna (November 3), in which Poland and the Tsardom of Russia formed an anti-Swedish alliance. With Russian forces attacking Sweden in Livonia (see Russo-Swedish War (1656–1658)), Poland finally had time to recoup and gather fresh forces. On October 12, 1655, with permission from King John Casimir, Frederick William, Elector of Brandenburg signed the Treaty of Rinsk, in which the Royal Prussian nobility agreed to allow Brandenburgian garrisons in their province to defend it against the Swedish invasion (the treaty did not include the cities of Gdańsk, Elbląg and Toruń). In November and December 1655 the Swedish army under Gustaf Otto Stenbock captured all the towns of Royal Prussia except for Gdańsk, Puck and Malbork.
To prevent John Casimir&#x27;s return to Poland, Swedish units protected the border with Silesia. On November 18, 1655, the Swedes besieged the monastery at Jasna Góra, located in Lesser Poland, near the border. Led by the Grand Prior Augustyn Kordecki, the garrison of this symbolic sanctuary-fortress of Poland held off its enemies in the Siege of Jasna Góra. The defense of Jasna Góra galvanized Polish resistance against the Swedes. The news of the siege spread across the nation, and in several areas guerrilla units were created, outraged at the Swedes&#x27; attempt to seize the monastery. On December 7, 1655, the unit of Colonel Gabriel Wojniłłowicz defeated the Swedes and their Polish collaborators near Krosno. On December 13, Polish troops under Wojniłłowicz recaptured Nowy Sącz, and soon afterwards Sweden lost Biała, Dukla, Biecz, Wieliczka, and Oświęcim. By late 1655, the situation in southern Lesser Poland had deteriorated to such an extent for the invaders that on December 27 they decided to lift the siege of Jasna Góra. On December 16, 1655, in Sokal, Polish Crown hetmans urged the nation to fight the Swedish armies. Two days later, King John Casimir left the Głogówek in Silesia, and via Racibórz and Cieszyn, returned to Poland, arriving at Lubowla on December 27. Two days later, the Tyszowce Confederation was formed in support of the Polish king. John Casimir himself met with hetmans Stanisław Rewera Potocki, Jerzy Sebastian Lubomirski, Stanisław Lanckoroński and Stefan Czarniecki in Krosno, on December 31, 1655. The meeting was also attended by Primate Andrzej Leszczyński, and eight voivodes.

=== 1656 ===
While in Krosno, the Polish king found out about the end of the siege of Jasna Góra, and about the death of Janusz Radziwiłł. On January 12, 1656, John Casimir left Krosno, and after three days, arrived at Łańcut Castle, which belonged to the Lubomirski family. On February 10, the king came to Lwów, which, together with Gdańsk, was one of only two major cities of the Commonwealth not seized by any of Poland&#x27;s enemies. Soon Polish Army units began to concentrate in the area of Lwów, including militias from Red Ruthenia, Volhynia and Lublin, as well as forces under Potocki and Prince Lubomirski, together with the garrison of Kamieniec Podolski fortress. Charles Gustav, after finding out about the return of the Polish king, ordered his armies to concentrate in Łowicz. On February 8, 1656, the Swedes defeated Czarniecki in the Battle of Gołąb, and continued their march towards Lwów, reaching the Zamość Fortress on February 25. On March 1, realizing that without heavy guns it was impossible to capture the mighty stronghold, the Swedish army gave up the siege, and headed towards Bełżec. On March 3, Charles Gustav, whose units were harassed by Polish guerilla forces, decided to retreat. At the same time, guerilla warfare also broke out in Mazovia and Greater Poland, and Lithuanian units under the Grand Hetman of Lithuania Paweł Jan Sapieha began moving towards Red Ruthenia.

On March 11, the Swedish army arrived at Jarosław, fighting its way across the San river. Charles Gustav sent some of his forces to capture Przemyśl, but on March 16 they returned to Jarosław without success. On March 22, the Swedish army set off northwards, along the San and Vistula rivers, back to Warsaw. They were followed by units of Stefan Czarniecki and Aleksander Koniecpolski, and during the retreat, Polish troops supporting the invaders changed sides, joining the forces of John Casimir. On March 30, the starving, cold and tired Swedish army of 5,000 stopped near Sandomierz, which was already in Polish hands. The Swedes camped among the forests of Sandomierz Forest near Gorzyce, where they were quickly surrounded by approximately 23,000 Poles and Lithuanians. To help the besieged army, on March 27 Frederick VI left Warsaw with 2,500 reiters and dragoons, so John Casimir ordered the mounted units of Czarnecki and Lubomirski to face the margrave. Frederick&#x27;s army was defeated on April 7 in the Battle of Warka. At Gorzyce, however, second-quality Polish forces remained, and the Swedish king managed to break out (April 5), and on April 13, Charles Gustav reached Warsaw. Meanwhile, the Polish king made the Lwów Oath (April 1), in which he entrusted the Commonwealth to the Blessed Virgin Mary&#x27;s protection, and declared her &#x27;The Queen of the Polish Crown&#x27;.

After the Battle of Warka, Czarniecki and Lubomirski decided to head towards Greater Poland and Kujawy, to support guerrilla forces active there. By April 9, Polish troops reached Royal Prussia, capturing Bydgoszcz and Nakło (April 19). The Polish attempt to capture Toruń, on April 17, was a failure. After a short rest, Stefan Czarniecki considered a raid of Swedish Pomerania, but other Polish leaders opposed this idea. Charles Gustav decided to prevent the Poles from taking control of the northern districts of the country, and departed Warsaw with an army of 10,000 (April 17). On April 21, the Lithuanians under Sapieha freed Lublin, and on April 23, the Lithuanian army reached Praga, which today is a right-bank district of Warsaw. The forces of Czarniecki and Lubomirski joined other troops near Piła, but on May 7 they were defeated in the Battle of Kłecko, despite their numerical superiority. After the battle, the surviving Polish units regrouped near Gniezno, and in late May, they headed for Warsaw, to help the Lithuanians in the siege of the Polish capital (April 24 – July 1). Warsaw was being defended by Arvid Wittenberg with 2,000 soldiers, as the main Swedish army was busy besieging Gdańsk. Wittenberg capitulated on July 1, 1656.
Already in late 1655, Charles Gustav realized that it would be impossible for him to control the Commonwealth. The Swedish king decided to find allies, who would help him to divide Poland-Lithuania. On June 29, 1656, he signed the Treaty of Marienburg, in which he offered Frederick William, Elector of Brandenburg a reward for fighting on his side. Brandenburg-Prussia was promised sovereignty in four voivodeships – Poznań, Kalisz, Łęczyca, and Sieradz. On July 28, a reinforced Swedish–Brandenburgian army, under Charles Gustav, set out for Warsaw. Even though the allied army was smaller, it still managed to defeat the Poles and Lithuanians in the Battle of Warsaw (July 28–30), and to recapture Warsaw. This victory, however, achieved little, as the Poles retreated behind the Wieprz, where they regrouped, and were soon ready to continue fighting. Finally, Charles Gustav decided to abandon Warsaw, and retreat to Royal Prussia. To punish Brandenburg-Prussia, Commonwealth forces decided to invade the Duchy of Prussia. In early October 1656, an army of 11,000 under Wincenty Korwin Gosiewski entered Prussia, supported by 2,000 Crimean Tatars. On October 8, Gosiewski&#x27;s army won the Battle of Prostken (October 8), but after the Tatars decided to return to the Crimea, the Polish–Lithuanian army was defeated in the Battle of Filipów (October 22). In November 1656, Greater Poland&#x27;s troops invaded the Brandenburger province of Neumark, which resulted in withdrawal of Brandenburger forces from most of Greater Poland. Charles Gustav, knowing that he needed the support of the Elector, agreed to sign the Treaty of Labiau (November 20), which granted full sovereignty to the Prussian ruler, in exchange for his complete military support of Sweden in the ongoing war. The Commonwealth, on the other hand, had already been negotiating with the House of Habsburg. On December 1, 1656, the first Treaty of Vienna was signed, which was followed by a second Treaty of Vienna, in which Emperor Leopold I promised to aid John Casimir with 12,000 troops against the Swedish-Brandenburgian alliance. By late 1656, Swedish troops had been pushed out of most of the Commonwealth. They only held the right-bank half of Royal Prussia, northern Mazovia, Łowicz, Kraków, and Tykocin.

=== 1657 ===
In 1653, the Transylvanian Hungarian ruler George II Rákóczi signed an alliance with Poland, and the relations between the Commonwealth and Transylvania were friendly. George had even been offered the Polish crown, on condition that he convert to Catholicism. Stunning Swedish successes, however, made Rákóczi change his mind. On May 18, 1656, Charles X Gustav, in a letter sent from Malbork, offered the Hungarian prince Red Ruthenia, in exchange for military support against the Commonwealth. Meanwhile, Rákóczi had already been negotiating with Bohdan Khmelnytsky, and on September 7, 1656, Transylvania and the Zaporizhian Sich signed a peace treaty, which obliged both sides to help each other in war. On December 8, 1656, the Treaty of Radnot was signed, which divided Poland-Lithuania among Charles X Gustav, Bogusław Radziwiłł, Elector Frederick William, Bohdan Khmelnytsky, and George II Rákóczi. In late January 1657, the Transylvanian army of 25,000 crossed the Carpathians, heading towards Medyka, where 10,000 Cossack allies awaited them. To face the new invader, the army of hetman Stanisław Rewera Potocki rushed southwards. At the same time (January 2), in the Battle of Chojnice, the Swedes defeated the Poles. On February 26, Stefan Czarniecki and King John Casimir met in Kalisz, where they decided to prevent the Swedish and Transylvanian armies from meeting.
After joining the Cossacks, Rákóczi decided not to attack Lwów, but set off towards Kraków, where the situation of the Swedish garrison under Wirtz was desperate. On March 21, Rákóczi captured Tarnów, and on March 28, he reached Kraków. Along the way to the ancient Polish capital, the Transylvanian-Cossack army burned and looted towns and villages, murdering thousands. Since his army was too busy looting Lesser Poland, only 5,000 soldiers reached Kraków, which by the Treaty of Radnot, was to be ruled by Transylvania. After leaving 2,500 soldiers to help the Swedish garrison of Kraków, Rákóczi&#x27;s army headed northwards, along the Vistula. On April 12, 1657, the Transylvanian-Cossack army met with Swedish forces under Charles X Gustav, at Ćmielów. The joined forces began to follow the Polish Crown army under Stanisław Potocki, and the Lithuanian army under Paweł Sapieha, to force a decisive battle. On April 29, the Polish and Lithuanian armies joined forces at Łosice, and in early May 1657, the Poles decided to organize a revenge raid on Transylvania, under hetman Jerzy Sebastian Lubomirski. On May 13, Rákóczi and Charles X Gustav seized the fortress of Brześć Litewski, and on May 17, after a three-day siege, the Swedes, Cossacks, and Transylvanians captured Warsaw. Soon afterwards, however, the Dano-Swedish War began, and Charles X Gustav left Poland with most of his troops. The remaining Swedish army was commanded by Gustaf Otto Stenbock. The Swedish withdrawal made Rákóczi uneasy, as he was well aware of the poor quality of his soldiers. On July 7–8, 1656, at Łańcut Castle, King John Casimir and his hetmans agreed that Stefan Czarniecki would follow Rákóczi and the Cossacks, while Lubomirski&#x27;s and Potocki&#x27;s divisions together with Crimean Tatars.

The Ottomans were offended that George II Rakoczi, who was officially their vassal, did not ask their approval to attack Poland and did not want to open another war (in that time they tried to attack Venice through Dalmatia) but when he ignored them they ordered the Crimean Tatars to help the Polish troops and punish Rakoczi. They already replaced Rakoczi&#x27;s vassal voivodes from Moldavia and Wallachia.

On June 20, 1657, Stenbock was ordered by Charles X Gustav to abandon Rákóczi and head with his army to Stettin. To save his skin, the ruler of Transylvania began a quick retreat southwards, towards the Carpathians. On July 11, Stefan Czarniecki&#x27;s division defeated Rákóczi at Magierów near Lwów, and on July 20, the Transylvanian-Cossack army was destroyed in the Battle of Czarny Ostrów in Podolia. Three days later, Rákóczi signed a peace treaty with the Commonwealth, in which he promised to break the alliance with Sweden, withdraw his troops from Kraków and Brześć Litewski, and pay for the damage inflicted by his army. On July 26, remnants of the Transylvanian army were surrounded by the Tatars near Skałat. Rákóczi himself managed to flee, and the army was temporarily commanded by John Kemény, who himself was captured by the Tatars. After six months of fighting in Poland, Rákóczi&#x27;s army of 25,000 ceased to exist, with all survivors taken prisoner by the Tatars.

On August 30, the Swedish garrison left Kraków, and throughout August and September 1657, all Swedish troops in Poland moved northwards, to Royal Prussia. Altogether, by autumn of that year, only some 8,000 Swedish soldiers remained in Poland–Lithuania. The Swedes still kept some Prussian cities, as Malbork, Elbląg, Sztum, Brodnica, Grudziądz, and Toruń. On September 11, an Austrian army of 11,000, allied with Poland, concentrated near Kraków and set off to Płock, where it spent the winter. Polish army commanders and King John Casimir, gathered in Poznań on November 26, decided to delay the attack on Swedish forces in Royal Prussia until spring 1658. On November 6, 1657, Poland and Brandenburg–Prussia signed the Treaty of Bromberg. Ducal Prussia, which had previously allied itself with Sweden and attacked Poland, changed sides and guaranteed military support of the Commonwealth, in return for sovereignty (it had been a fief of Poland since 1466). This treaty is regarded by historian Józef Włodarski as one of the worst mistakes in Polish history.

=== 1658–1660 ===

In the spring of 1658, the Polish army, together with its Austrian allies under Raimondo Montecuccoli, began a campaign in Royal Prussia, where several key towns and cities were still in Swedish hands. On July 1, the siege of Toruń began. The heavily fortified city was defended by 2400 soldiers under Barthod Hartwig von Bülow. The Polish troops included the divisions of Krzysztof Grodzicki, Jan Sapieha and Stefan Czarniecki. Furthermore, they were provided support by the Brandenburgian-Prussian army of Bogusław Radziwiłł, which after the Treaty of Bromberg changed sides. Altogether, almost 25,000 soldiers besieged Toruń. After a prolonged artillery bombardment, the main attack took place in the night of November 16–17, and on December 30 Toruń capitulated. Meanwhile, Stefan Czarniecki&#x27;s division headed to Denmark–Norway, to help the Danes in the Dano-Swedish War. In October 1658, the Polish army of 4500 reached Hamburg, and in December 1658, with the help of Polish troops, the fortress of Kolding was captured (see Battle of Kolding).

On July 1, 1658, the Sejm ordered the expulsion of the Polish Brethren, who were accused of collaborating with the Swedish invaders.

In 1659, the Swedish army still remaining in Poland under Lorens von der Linde was withdrawn to major Royal Prussian fortresses – Malbork, Głowa Gdańska, Grudziądz, Elbląg, and Brodnica. In August 1659, the Polish army captured Głowa and Grudziądz, and soon afterwards, the starving Swedish garrison at Brodnica surrendered. The siege of Malbork was continued, and Polish – Brandenburgian troops blocked Elbląg. In December 1659, the siege of Elbląg began. Meanwhile, in late 1658, the Polish–Russian truce ended when Russian forces under Ivan Andreyevich Khovansky (Tararui) and Jurij Aleksiejewicz Dołgorukow again attacked the Polish – Lithuanian units (see Russo-Polish War (1654–1667)). The Russians managed to capture large parts of the Commonwealth, but were later defeated in the Battle of Konotop and the Battle of Polonka.

On May 3, 1660, the Treaty of Oliva was signed, which ended the Polish–Swedish War. After the conclusion of the conflict, Poland–Lithuania initiated a large offensive against the Russians, who were beaten in the Battle of Chudnov. In 1661, Vilnius was recaptured (December 2), and in 1663–64, Polish forces invaded Left-bank Ukraine. The war with Russia ended with the Truce of Andrusovo (January 30, 1667).

== Other conflicts ==
The Deluge was the climax of a series of wars that took place in Poland–Lithuania in the mid-17th century. The Commonwealth was first affected by the Khmelnytsky Uprising, which began in 1648, and affected southeastern provinces of the country. In the final stages of the uprising, the Russians invaded Poland–Lithuania in 1654, reaching as far west as the Vistula river near Puławy. The Commonwealth also fought forces from Transylvania and Brandenburg-Prussia, but the Duchy of Prussia gained formal Polish recognition of its independence outside of the Polish state (Treaty of Wehlau, 1657). The Tatars of the Crimean Khanate and the Nogai Horde conducted almost annual slave raids in the territories controlled by the Commonwealth. In all these other invasions, only the Russian invaders caused the most similar damages to the Swedes, due to Russian raids, destructions and rapid incursion which crippled Polish industries.

With the Treaty of Hadiach on September 16, 1658, the Polish Crown sought to elevate the Cossacks and Ruthenians to a position equal to that of Poland and Lithuania in the Polish–Lithuanian Union, and in fact transform the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth into a Polish–Lithuanian–Ruthenian Commonwealth (Polish: , &quot;Commonwealth of Three Nations&quot;). Supported by Cossack Hetman Ivan Vyhovsky and the , the treaty aimed to change the face of Eastern Europe. However, its terms never came into full operation: in addition to the unpopularity of continued integration with the Commonwealth with the majority of the Cossacks, Russia refused to recognize Hadiach, and maintained its claims to Ukraine. The Russo-Polish War (1654–1667) ended with the Treaty of Andrusovo of January 13, 1667. (Poland-Lithuania profited from Turkish participation in the Russo-Turkish War (1676–1681) due to Ottoman links with the Crimea.) The peace settlement gave Russia control over the so-called Left-bank Ukraine (left of the river Dnieper), with the Commonwealth retaining Right-bank Ukraine (right of the Dnieper). While initially the agreement stipulated that Russia would return Left-bank Ukraine to the Commonwealth in twenty years, the division became permanent with the Eternal Peace Treaty of 1686.

The Deluge brought to an end the era of religious tolerance in the Commonwealth: mostly non-Catholic invaders antagonized Catholic (including Uniate) population. The expulsion of the Protestant Polish Brethren from Poland in 1658 exemplified the increasing intolerance. During the Deluge, many thousands of Polish Jews also fell victim to violence carried out by the Zaporozhian Cossacks and Polish-Lithuanian forces.

== Outcome ==
The Treaty of Oliva signed in 1660 meant that: Poland gave up most of Livonia with Riga, retaining only part of it (Latgale – the south-eastern part of Livonia) which was in Russian hands at the time, until the Armistice of Andrusov in 1667. King John II Casimir Vasa renounced his right to claim the Swedish throne for himself and those who succeeded him. He did, however, retain the title of King of Sweden for the rest of his life. Sweden had pledged to uphold freedom of trade in the Baltic.

The evaluation of the outcome of the Deluge is disputed. Historians like Michael Fredholm von Essen state that the Deluge &quot;did not end in a Swedish defeat&quot; and &quot;did not end in a Polish victory&quot;.

Some claim that Sweden won the war. However, other historians claim that Sweden lost the war. Other historians also claim that the war ended favourably for Sweden. With other historians claiming the war to have ended favourably for the Commonwealth or unfavourably for Sweden.

== Destruction of the Commonwealth ==

The Swedish invasion affected the richest provinces of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth (Greater Poland, Lesser Poland, Mazovia, Pomerelia, Kujawy, Podlasie), which for the most part had not been affected by major wars for 200 years. According to Professor Andrzej Rottermund, manager of the Royal Castle in Warsaw, the Swedish army robbed Poland of her most precious goods – thousands of works of art, books and valuables. Most of these items have never been returned to Poland, and are kept both in private Swedish hands and in Stockholm museums, such as the Swedish Army Museum, and Livrustkammaren. Almost all cities, towns, castles and churches in locations where Swedish troops were stationed were destroyed, and in guides to many Polish towns and cities one can find notes that read &quot;object destroyed during Swedish invasion&quot;. From the Royal Castle in Warsaw the Swedes plundered approximately 200 paintings, a number of carpets and Turkish tents, musical instruments, furniture, Chinese porcelain, weapons, books, manuscripts, marbles, even dresses of maids and door frames pulled from walls. Meanwhile, the Russian invaders in the east had also destroyed and damaged much of the eastern part&#x27;s infrastructure, partly due to heavy agricultural fertile developments there.

Hubert Kowalski of the University of Warsaw Institute of Archeology says that Swedes stole anything they could lay their hands onwindows, stairs, chimneys, sculptures, floors, doors and gates. Most goods were loaded on boats and transported along the Vistula to the Baltic Sea and then to Sweden. In November 2011, archaeologists of the University of Warsaw found approximately 70 items (total weight five tons), which probably come from the Warsaw Royal Castle. They sank in the Vistula while being transported to Sweden. Even though Article 9 of the Treaty of Oliva stated that Sweden should return all stolen goods, all items are still kept in Stockholm and other Swedish locations. Several Polish kings (John II Casimir, John III Sobieski and Stanisław II Augustus) sent official missions to Sweden, but without success. In most situations, Swedish authorities claimed that they did not know where stolen goods were. In 1911, Kraków&#x27;s Academy of Science sent its own mission, which was made up of renowned professors Eugeniusz Barwiński, Ludwik Birkenmajer and Jan Łoś. In Stockholm and Uppsala they found 205 manuscripts and 168 rare Polish books, describing their foundings in a report. In 2002, the Warsaw Royal Castle organized an exhibition, &quot;Eagle and Three Crowns&quot;, which presented many items stolen from Poland, and kept in Swedish museums. After the Deluge, the Commonwealth became a &quot;cultural desert&quot;. Poland and Lithuania lost 67 libraries and 17 archives. Of all major cities of the country, only Lwów and Gdańsk were not destroyed, and when Swedish soldiers were unable to steal an item, they would destroy or burn it. In ruins were castles, palaces, churches, abbeys, towns and villages. As a result of the Swedish invasion, few pre-Baroque buildings remained in Poland. An estimated 3 million died.

Among others, Swedish troops stole such items as:
* both Polish and Lithuanian state records (&quot;Metrica Regni Poloniae&quot;),
* the royal library from Warsaw,
* libraries from Ujazdów Castle, Toruń, Bydgoszcz, Malbork, Poznań, Grudziądz, Gniezno, Lublin, Jarosław, Vilnius, Sandomierz, Radom, and Kraków, also archives and libraries from most towns of Royal Prussia. Most of the stolen books are kept in the University Library at Uppsala, the Royal Library at Stockholm, and private libraries of the Bielke, Oxenstierna, Rosenhahne, Wrangel and Brahe families,
* all Warsaw palaces – completely robbed were the Kazanowski Palace, the Ossoliński Palace, the Daniłłowicz Palace, the Primate Palace, the Bishophoric Palace, the Royal Palace and the Royal Castle,
* castles and churches, which were robbed and destroyed, as were almost all Polish towns; the most notable examples are Golub-Dobrzyń, Krzyżtopór, Wieluń, Krasnystaw, Wawel, Tęczyn, Lanckorona, Pieskowa Skała, Kielce, Sandomierz, Chęciny Niepołomice, Ojców, Wiśnicz, Łobzów, Kruszwica, Rabsztyn.

According to the estimates of Polish scholars I. Ihnatowicz, Z. Landau, A. Mączak and B. Zientara, the invasion by the Swedish army and its allies (Brandenburg-Prussia and Transilvania), resulted in the loss of 25% of the population in four core Polish provinces. Lesser Poland lost 23% of population, Mazovia 40% in villages and 70% in towns, Greater Poland 50% in villages and 60% in towns. Royal Prussia lost some 60% of its population. The Commonwealth&#x27;s population losses are estimated at between 30% and 50% in 1648–1660.

In January 2013 Marek Poznański, a Palikot Movement member of the Polish parliament, announced his plan to send thousands of postcards to European politicians and journalists, in which he wanted to convince the recipients that Poland should get financial compensation from Sweden for the destruction of the country in the deluge. Poznański claims that in the 1660 Treaty of Oliwa, Sweden pledged to return all stolen goods, which never happened. The MP had previously intervened at the Polish Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Culture; he also visited the Embassy of Sweden in Warsaw. A businessman from Warsaw, Sławian Krzywiński, joined Poznański, creating the Foundation of Reconstruction of Destruction Caused by the Swedish Invasion (Fundacja Odbudowy Zniszczeń Dokonanych w Czasie Potopu Szwedzkiego). According to Krzywiński, looted goods are still kept in Swedish museums and private collections. Among others, Poland lost the Braniewo Library, works of Nicolaus Copernicus, including the 1543 Nuremberg edition of &quot;De revolutionibus orbium coelestium&quot;, and the oldest printed text of Bogurodzica. Krzywiński states that as an act of goodwill, the Swedish side should cover the cost of reconstruction of the Rawa Mazowiecka castle, which was destroyed by them in the 1650s.

The population in cities like Warsaw had been reduced to only 10% of its pre-war population of 20,000, and the entire city was razed to the ground, akin to the centuries-after Nazi occupation of the city during World War II. Kraków and Vilnius were also devastated, with their populations being reduced by over half. Additionally, the Polish Gross national product (GNP or GNI) was reduced to 55% of its pre-war levels as a consequence of the Swedish invasion.

===Effect on the fate of the Commonwealth===
One of the most notable effects of the devastating Deluge was the subsequent weakening of Poland&#x27;s international standing. As a result of the Deluge, the Commonwealth began a subsequent period of decline.

== In popular culture ==
The Deluge had a major effect on Poland, and there are several books describing the war. In 1886 Henryk Sienkiewicz described the Swedish invasion in his novel &#x27;. Based on the novel, Jerzy Hoffman directed the film &quot;The Deluge&quot; (&#x27;) in 1974, a classic historical work. It starred Daniel Olbrychski as the character Andrzej Kmicic, a patriot who valiantly fought against the Swedish invasion. The film received a nomination for an Oscar in 1974, but lost to the Italian film &quot;Amarcord&quot;.

In 2000, Renata Ocieczek wrote the book (&quot;The time of the Swedish deluge in Polish literature&quot;), and in 2006 Jacek Płosiński wrote (&quot;Swedish deluge in Podlasie&quot;). Other books about this topic include: by Mirosław Nagielski, (&quot;Bloody storm&quot;) by Augustyn Necel (describing the Deluge in the region of Kaszuby), (&quot;The sign of the Jastrzębiec&quot;) by Stanisław Maria Jankowski, and (&quot;The memoir of the siege of Częstochowa&quot;), by Father Augustyn Kordecki. Furthermore, James Michener describes the Deluge in his novel &quot;Poland&quot; (1983). The Deluge has also found its way into video games. The video game &quot;Mount &amp; Blade: With Fire &amp; Sword&quot; (named after the first book of Sienkiewicz&#x27;s trilogy) contains a quest called &quot;The Deluge&quot; that is based on the events of the actual Deluge.

<text>The widemouth blindcat (Satan eurystomus) is a species of North American freshwater catfish endemic to Texas in the United States. It is the only species in the genus Satan.

==Description==
It was first discovered inhabiting a well, and is adapted for a lightless underground environment. Like other cavefish, the widemouth blindcat lacks pigmentation and has no externally visible eyes. The eye remnants are extremely reduced in size with very little or no trace of a retina or lens; the optic tract is present, but always regresses before reaching the brain. The swim bladder in these fish is reduced, and the skull is mostly cartilaginous and not well-ossified, unlike the adults of most larger ictalurids. The lateral line is fragmentary and never reaches past the anterior part of the anal fin. This species also has a few paedomorphic traits (indicated by small size, kidney morphology, and weak ossification of the skeleton). This species grows to about TL.

==Taxonomy==
The widemouth blindcat&#x27;s closest relative is the much larger flathead catfish (&quot;Pylodictis olivaris&quot;).

==Distribution and habitat==
Along with the related toothless blindcat (&quot;Trogloglanis pattersoni&quot;), this species is distributed in five artesian wells penetrating the San Antonio Pool of the Edwards Aquifer in and near San Antonio, Texas. These fish have been found with crustacean exoskeletons in their stomachs, and may be the top carnivore in their habitat.

==Conservation==
The widemouth blindcat is a vulnerable species, and is threatened by groundwater pollution. In 2023, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service proposed to list the species as endangered under the Endangered Species Act of 1973 along with the sympatric toothless blindcat.

<text>The Rotterdam Philharmonic Orchestra (RPhO; ) is a Dutch symphony orchestra based in Rotterdam. Its primary venue is the concert hall De Doelen. The RPhO is considered one of the Netherlands&#x27; two principal orchestras of international standing, second to the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra of Amsterdam. In addition to symphony concerts, the RPhO performs as the opera orchestra in productions at De Nederlandse Opera, as do other Dutch ensembles.

==History==

Several musicians founded the RPhO in 1918 as a private &quot;Society of Professional Musicians for Mutual Cultivation of the Arts&quot;. It had paying members and the aim was to make music for personal pleasure without pursuit of gain. The first musical director was Willem Feltzer, who was the manager of two Rotterdam music schools. Alexander Schmuller succeeded Felzer as music director, for two years.
In May 1930, Eduard Flipse was appointed principal conductor, and held the post until 1962. Under his stewardship, the amateur ensemble evolved into a professional orchestra. When Flipse took over from Feltzer and Schmuller, the orchestra was in poor shape both financially and artistically. However, Filpse had both managerial skills and musical vision. He established an &quot;Instrument Fund&quot; to raise funds for new instruments and other necessities, and the orchestra became known for its special attention to contemporary music, featuring the work of Dutch composers such as Johan Wagenaar, Willem Pijper and Alphons Diepenbrock.

A 1300-seat concert hall, the Doelen, was built in 1935, and the orchestra was rewarded by rising attendance numbers. When the Rotterdam City Council began to subsidize the orchestra, its problems seemed to be in the past.

On May 7, 1940 the orchestra played a concert of Bruch and Stravinsky in a celebration of Flipse&#x27;s first ten years as conductor. In June 1940 Rotterdam was planning to celebrate its six hundredth birthday and the Rotterdam Philharmonic planned a special program. However, on May 14 Nazi Germany bombed Rotterdam and nearly completely destroyed it, thereby launching its occupation of the Netherlands which lasted for the duration of World War II. The Doelen was destroyed, as was a rehearsal facility, with most of the music library and all of the orchestra&#x27;s instruments.

Despite the problems, the orchestra season finished according to plan, thanks to several other Dutch orchestras who gave concerts to raise money and helped with equipment and sheet music. The Koninginnekerk, one of the few churches that survived the bombing, became the new concert hall. During the occupation, the rules of the new &quot;Cultuurkamer&quot;, an organization meant to regulate the arts in the Nazi-occupied Netherlands, were severely restrictive and discriminatory. Every musician had to become a member of the &quot;Cultuurkamer&quot;, Jewish musicians had to be fired, and music by Jewish composers was banned, as was music from countries at war with Nazi Germany.

After the war, the orchestra lacked a permanent home until a new concert hall, also called the Doelen, was built in 1966. After Flipse retired as principal conductor in 1962, his successors were Franz Paul Decker (1962-1967) and Jean Fournet (1968-1973). In 1973, Edo de Waart became principal conductor, and served in the post until 1979. Under De Waart and David Zinman, who succeeded him as principal conductor from 1979 to 1982, the Rotterdam grew into an orchestra of international stature, making many recordings and successful international tours.

From 1983 to 1991, James Conlon was the RPhO&#x27;s principal conductor. Jeffrey Tate succeeded Conlon, from 1991 to 1995. From 1995, Valery Gergiev served as principal conductor, and featured the orchestra in his Gergiev Festival presentations. Gergiev stepped down as principal conductor in August 2008, and subsequently took the title of &quot;eredirigent&quot; (honorary conductor) of the RPhO. He held this title until March 2022, when the RPhO terminated its artistic relationship with Gergiev, rescinded his title of &quot;eredirigent&quot; and discontinued its Gergiev Festival, following Gergiev&#x27;s lack of denunciation of the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine.

In December 2006, the orchestra voted unanimously to name Yannick Nézet-Séguin as their 11th Principal Conductor, as of the 2008–2009 season, with an initial contract of 4 years. In April 2010, the RPhO announced the extension of Nézet-Séguin&#x27;s contract through 2015. In June 2013, the RPhO further extended his contract through the summer of 2018. In May 2015, the RPhO announced the scheduled conclusion of Nézet-Séguin&#x27;s tenure as principal conductor at the end of the 2017–2018 season. Nézet-Séguin now has the title of &quot;Eredirigent&quot; with the RPhO.

In June 2016, Lahav Shani made his first guest-conducting appearance with the RPhO. On the basis of this concert, in August 2016, the RPhO unanimously elected Shani as its next chief conductor, effective with the 2018–2019 season, with an initial contract of 5 years. Shani is the youngest conductor ever to be named chief conductor of the RPhO. In March 2020, the RPhO announced the extension of Shani&#x27;s contract as chief conductor through August 2026. In January 2023, the RPhO announced that Shani is to conclude his tenure as its chief conductor at the close of the 2025-2026 season.

Past principal guest conductors of the RPhO included Jirí Belohlávek, who held the title from the 2012–2013 season until his death on 31 May 2017. In May 2022, Tarmo Peltokoski first guest-conducted the RPhO. On the basis of this appearance, the RPhO announced the appointment of Peltokoski as its next principal guest conductor, effective with the 2023-2024 season, with an initial contract of 4 years.

The RPhO has made commercial recordings for such labels as Philips, EMI, BIS, and Deutsche Grammophon.

<text>The Battle of Dupplin Moor was fought between supporters of King David II of Scotland, the son of King Robert Bruce, and English-backed invaders supporting Edward Balliol, son of King John I of Scotland, on 11 August 1332. It took place a little to the south-west of Perth, Scotland, when a Scottish force commanded by Donald, Earl of Mar, estimated to have been stronger than 15,000 and possibly as many as 40,000 men, attacked a largely English force of 1,500 commanded by Balliol and Henry Beaumont, Earl of Buchan. This was the first major battle of the Second War of Scottish Independence. 

The First War of Scottish Independence between England and Scotland ended in 1328 with the Treaty of Northampton, recognising Bruce as King of Scots, but the treaty was widely resented in England. King Edward III of England was happy to cause trouble for his northern neighbour and tacitly supported an attempt to place Balliol on the Scottish throne. Balliol and a small force landed in Fife and marched on Perth, then the Scottish capital. A Scottish army at least ten times stronger occupied a defensive position on the far side of the River Earn. The invaders crossed the river at night via an unguarded ford and took up a strong defensive position.

In the morning the Scots raced to attack the English, disorganising their own formations. Unable to break the line of English men-at-arms, the Scots became trapped in a valley with fresh forces arriving from the rear pressing them forward and giving them no room to manoeuvre, or even to use their weapons. English longbowmen shot into both Scottish flanks. Many Scots died of suffocation or were trampled underfoot. Eventually they broke and the English men-at-arms mounted and pursued the fugitives until nightfall. Perth fell, the remaining Scottish forces dispersed and Balliol was crowned King of Scots. By the end of 1332 he had lost control of most of Scotland, but regained it in 1333 with Edward III&#x27;s open support. He was deposed again in 1334, restored again in 1335 and finally deposed in 1336, by those loyal to David II.

==Background==
The First War of Scottish Independence between England and Scotland began in March 1296, when Edward I of England () stormed and sacked the Scottish border town of Berwick-upon-Tweed as a prelude to his invasion of Scotland. After the 30 years of warfare which followed, the newly crowned 14-year-old King Edward III was nearly captured in the English disaster at Stanhope Park. This brought his regents, Isabella of France and Roger Mortimer, to the negotiating table. They agreed to the Treaty of Northampton with Robert Bruce () in 1328, recognising Bruce as King of Scots. The treaty was widely resented in England and commonly known as the , &quot;the cowards&#x27; peace&quot;. Some Scottish nobles, refusing to swear fealty to Bruce, were disinherited and left Scotland to join forces with Edward Balliol, son of King John I of Scotland (), who had been captured by the English in 1296 and abdicated.

Robert Bruce died in 1329 and his heir was 5-year-old David II (). In 1331, under the leadership of Edward Balliol and Henry Beaumont, Earl of Buchan, the disinherited Scottish nobles gathered in Yorkshire and plotted an invasion of Scotland. Edward III was aware of the scheme and officially forbade it, in March 1332 writing to his northern officials that anyone planning an invasion of Scotland was to be arrested. The reality was different, and Edward III was happy to cause trouble for his northern neighbour. He insisted Balliol not invade Scotland overland from England but turned a blind eye to his forces sailing for Scotland from Yorkshire ports on 31 July 1332. The Scots were aware of the situation and were waiting for Balliol. David II&#x27;s regent was an experienced old soldier, Thomas Randolph, Earl of Moray, who was appointed to the role of guardian of Scotland. He had prepared for Balliol and Beaumont, but he died ten days before they sailed.

==Prelude==
Balliol&#x27;s force was small, only 1,500 men: 500 men-at-arms and 1,000 infantry, the latter mostly longbowmen. He anticipated being joined by many Scots once he had landed. While they were underway, the Scots selected Donald, Earl of Mar, as the new guardian of Scotland, and so also regent for the young David. Mar was an experienced campaigner and a close blood relative to the young King David. He divided the large Scottish army: Mar commanded the part north of the Firth of Forth, while Patrick, Earl of March, commanded those to the south. Balliol had been in communication with Mar and hoped he would come over to his side with many of his troops. Knowing Mar to be commanding the troops on the northern shore of the firth, Balliol landed there, at Wester Kinghorn (present day Burntisland), on 6 August 1332.

While the invaders were still disembarking they were confronted by a large Scottish force commanded by Duncan, Earl of Fife, and Robert Bruce (an illegitimate son of King Robert the Bruce). The Scots attacked the part of the English force on the beach, but were driven off after a hard-pressed assault by the volleys of the English longbowmen and by their supporting infantry before Balliol and Beaumont&#x27;s men-at-arms could get ashore.

Scottish accounts of the time dismiss their losses as trivial, while one English source gives 90 Scots killed, two give 900, and a fourth 1,000. One chronicle, the &quot;Brut&quot;, reports that Fife was &quot;full of shame&quot; at being defeated by such a small force. There is no record of the casualties suffered by Balliol&#x27;s men. Mar withdrew his main force to the capital, Perth, amalgamated the survivors of Kinghorn and sent out a general call for reinforcements. Buoyed by their victory, Balliol and Beaumont&#x27;s force completed their disembarkation and marched to Dunfermline, where they foraged, looted a Scottish armoury and then headed for Perth.

==Battle==
===English approach===
The Scottish army under Mar took up a position on the north bank of the River Earn, south of Perth, and broke down the bridge. The Scots were enormously stronger than the English. Chronicles of the time give strengths of 20,000, 30,000 orin seven cases50,000. The historian Clifford Rogers guesses they numbered something more than 15,000. Nearly all of the Scots were infantry. The English arrived on the south bank of the Earn on 10 August. They were in a difficult position: in enemy territory, facing an army of more than ten times their number in a good defensive position across a river and aware that the second Scottish army, under March, was moving towards them. The Scots were content to rest in their defensive positions, while planning to send a portion of their army on a wide outflanking manoeuvre the next day. Any attempt by the English to force the river would clearly have been foredoomed. The English may have been hoping Mar would desert to their cause, but he gave no indication of doing so. The two forces faced each other across the river for the rest of the day.

The Scots were so confident of victory that some started their celebrations that evening, according to a contemporary source &quot;playing, drinking and making merry&quot; late into the night. A guard was set by the broken bridge, but otherwise no precautions were taken against any action by the English. Realising they had no hope if they either retreated or remained where they were, the entire English force forded the river at an unguarded spot. Advancing in the dark, at about midnight they stumbled upon a Scottish camp and attacked it. Those Scots who were not killed or captured fled. The English believed they had overcome the main Scottish force, but were disabused at dawn when they saw the Scots advancing against them in two large bodies. This revelation demoralised the English, but according to the chronicles they were given heart by a stirring speech from one of their leaders.

The English arrayed themselves for battle on foot, except for 50 German mercenary knights who fought mounted. The other men-at-arms formed up in three tightly packed ranks with a fourth rank of pike-equipped ordinary infantry. The longbowmen were divided and assigned to each side of this central group. They were positioned where a valley narrowed as it entered hilly terrain. The infantry occupied the centre of this valley where it was about wide with the archers on higher and rougher terrain on each side. The horses of the men-at-arms were kept to the rear.

===Scottish attack===
The Scots were still supremely confident and formed up in two large groups or battles – also referred to as schiltrons. These were tightly packed, deep, pike-armed formations. Mar suggested that the English be given the opportunity to surrender, so that they could have been ransomedwhich would have raised a large sum. On seeing the English across the Earn, Bruce, who was in command of the leading schiltron, and who was aware, at least in part, of Mar&#x27;s correspondence with Balliol, publicly claimed that this unopposed crossing was due to treachery by Mar. Mar denounced this as a lie and declared he would prove his loyalty by being the first to strike a blow against the English. Bruce claimed this honour for himself and the two Scottish schiltrons proceeded to race each other to come to grips with the English.

Bruce&#x27;s schiltron, being already in the lead, won the race. But its headlong charge disorganised it and left the slower men behind. When it contacted the English only 800 men were still with Bruce, but they struck with such force that they drove the infantry in the English centre back nearly . The English did not break, but turned their shoulders to the Scots, braced themselves and halted the Scottish onrush. The Scots in their haste had allowed themselves to be channelled by the terrain and all of them attacked the English men-at-arms in the centre, ignoring the longbowmen on the valley sides. Pushing back the English centre had the effect of exposing their flanks to these bowmen. The rest of Bruce&#x27;s schiltron followed him into the valley, pressing their comrades in front of them forward against the English so strongly that the front ranks of neither force were able to use their weapons.

The Scots were either largely without helmets, or wore helmets without visors (face guards), for contemporaries noted that the English archers &quot;blinded and wounded the faces&quot; of those in the leading schiltron. Harassed by the longbowmen, the Scots on the flanks pressed closer to their main body, further compressing it and hampering the freedom of movement of its members. Mar&#x27;s schiltron, which was also rushing towards the English, became disorganised due to its haste and was similarly channelled by the steep valley sides. They charged into the rear of Bruce&#x27;s formation, causing chaos. The struggle continued from a little past dawn until after noon. In the centre of the Scottish mass the result was literally suffocating; men were pressed too tightly together to be able to breathe and any who lost their footing were trampled to death. Contemporary accounts speak of more than a thousand Scots being smothered without coming into contact with the English. One claimed that &quot;more were slain by the Scots themselves than by the English. For ... everyone fallen there fell a second, and then a third fell, and those who were behind pressing forward and hastening to the fight, the whole army became a heap of the slain.&quot;

The English, being in a looser and less deep formation, had room to use their weapons more effectively, once they had withstood the initial onslaught. The survivors of Bruce&#x27;s schiltron attempted to extricate themselves, adding to the confusion and making easy targets for the English men-at-arms. The chronicles record the English infantry having to climb over heaps of dead Scots to be able to strike at those still living. All the while, the longbowmen continued to shoot into the Scottish flanks. Eventually the Scottish resistance collapsed and they were routed. Several of the surviving Scottish nobles made their escape on horseback; the rest of the Scots fled on foot. The English men-at-arms mounted their own horses and pursued the Scots, hacking them down until sunset. The English then occupied Perth and set to work on improving its fortifications, against the anticipated arrival of March&#x27;s army.

===Casualties===
Precise figures for the English dead are available: they lost 35 men-at-arms: 2 knights and 33 squires. Several accounts stress that not a single English archer was killed. The losses among the Scots are less certain, but all accounts agree they were very heavy. Mar and Bruce died on the field; as did 2 other earls, 14 barons, 160 knights and many less notable men. Of the contemporary accounts which estimate the number of Scottish dead, two English chronicles give more than 15,000. Two Scottish accounts record 2,000 or 3,000 dead, while a third specifies 3,000 &quot;nobles&quot; and &quot;of other men an untold number&quot;. Most accounts refer to the Scottish dead lying in great heaps, some taller than a spear&#x27;s length. The only high-ranking Scottish survivor was the Earl of Fife, who was captured and changed sides.

==Aftermath==

A week after the battle, March arrived outside Perth, having added the remnants of Mar&#x27;s army to his own force. There was little he could do. Given that Balliol had defeated Mar in open battle, it would have been folly for March to assault him in a fortified town. Balliol had captured plentiful supplies of food in Perth and the ships which had landed his army defeated the Scottish navy, enabling food and reinforcements to be shipped in. In any event, before long the Scottish host had exhausted its own supplies, stripped the surrounding countryside of food and dispersed.

Balliol was crowned King of Scots at Sconethe traditional place of coronation for Scottish monarchson 24 September 1332. Within two months Balliol granted Edward III Scottish estates to a value of £2,000, which included &quot;the town, castle and county of Berwick&quot;. Balliol&#x27;s support within Scotland was limited and within six months it had collapsed. He was ambushed by supporters of David II at the Battle of Annan on 17 December. Balliol fled to England half-dressed and riding bareback. He appealed to Edward III for assistance. Edward III dropped all pretence of neutrality, recognised Balliol as King of Scots and made ready for war. After the defeat of the Scots at the Battle of Halidon Hill in July 1333 by the English Balliol was reinstated on the Scottish throne. He was deposed again in 1334, restored again in 1335 and finally deposed in 1336, by those loyal to David II. The Second War of Scottish Independence which had started with Balliol&#x27;s invasion finally ended in 1357. The modern historian Ranald Nicholson states that Edward III copied the tactics used at Dupplin Moor&quot;all the men-at-arms dismounted, while archers were posted on either flank&quot;in the English victories at Halidon Hill and Crécy.

==Location==
Historic Environment Scotland has identified a site on Gaskmoor, which it suggests corresponds with the accounts in the chronicles. This is on the Dupplin plateau, south-east of Dupplin Loch, and south-west of Perth. It points out that if correct

and concludes that this choice of terrain &quot;is evidence of the tactical brilliance of the [English], who were battle-hardened veterans.&quot; Historic Environment Scotland added the battlefield to the Inventory of Historic Battlefields in Scotland on 21 March 2011.

<text>Ramón María del Valle-Inclán y de la Peña (born in Vilanova de Arousa, Galicia, Spain, on October 28, 1866, and died in Santiago de Compostela on January 5, 1936) was a Spanish dramatist, novelist, and member of the Spanish Generation of 98. His work was considered radical in its subversion of the traditional Spanish theatre in the early 20th century. He influenced later generations of Spanish dramatists and is honored on National Theatre Day with a statue in Madrid.

==Biography==

Ramón María del Valle-Inclán was the second son of Ramón Valle-Inclán Bermúdez and Dolores de la Peña y Montenegro. As a child he lived in Vilanova and A Pobra do Caramiñal, and then he moved to Pontevedra in order to study high school. In 1888 he started to study law at University of Santiago de Compostela, and there he published his first story, &quot;Babel&quot;, at the &quot;Café con gotas&quot; magazine. He left his studies and moved to Madrid in 1890, where he wrote for various periodical newspapers such as &quot;El Globo&quot;, &quot;La Ilustración Ibérica&quot; or &quot;El Heraldo de Madrid&quot;.

He traveled to Mexico in 1892 to write for &quot;El Universal&quot;, &quot;El Correo Español&quot; and &quot;El Veracruza,&quot; before the following year returning to Pontevedra to write his first book, &quot;Femeninas (Feminine)&quot;, published in 1895.

In 1895, he moved to Madrid again, working as an official at the Ministry of Public Instruction and Fine Arts. In Madrid he did some translations of José Maria de Eça de Queirós, Alexandre Dumas, Gabriele D&#x27;Annunzio, Jules Barbey d&#x27;Aurevilly, Paul Alexis and Matilde Serao. In spite of his economic difficulties, he started to have a name in the &quot;tertulias&quot; (literary gatherings) of many culturally significant coffeehouses in Madrid, such as Café Gijón, and to be noticed for his dandy attitude and his eccentric looks. 
His hot temper got him involved in various affrays. Because one of those, at Café de la Montaña in 1899, an unfortunate stick wound by writer Manuel Bueno caused one of his cufflinks to inlay in his arm. The wound produced gangrene, and Valle-Inclán had his arm amputated. That same year of 1899, he met Rubén Darío, and both of them became good friends. At that time, he published his first theater play, &quot;Cenizas (Ashes)&quot;, and he started a very prolific literary period.

In 1907 he married the actress Josefina Blanco.

In 1910 he traveled for six months to various Latin American countries (Argentina, Chile, Paraguay, Uruguay and Bolivia) escorting his wife on an acting tour.

In 1913 he returned to Galicia, and set his residence in Cambados. Then, after the death of his second son, he moved to A Pobra do Caramiñal.

In 1916 he published in the Cuban magazine Labor Gallega a poem in Galician language with the title of &quot;Cantiga de vellas (Son of old women)&quot;, which is his most valuable contribution to Galician literature.

During World War I, he supported the allied army, visiting the front in various occasions as a war correspondent for &quot;El Imparcial&quot;.

In 1921 he traveled to Mexico again, invited by the President of the Republic, Álvaro Obregón. There he participated in many literary and cultural events, and got conquered by the Mexican Revolution. On his way back to Spain, he spent two weeks in Havana, and two weeks in New York City. That same year, 1921, he was appointed President of the International Federation of Latin American Intellectuals.

He returned to Spain at the end of 1921, and there he started to write &quot;Tirano Banderas (Tyrant Banderas)&quot;. He went back to Madrid in 1922, still inflamed by the spirit of the Mexican Revolution.

Since 1924 he showed his opposition to Miguel Primo de Rivera&#x27;s dictatorship.

With the arrival of the Second Spanish Republic, he ran in the elections with the Partido Radical of Alejandro Lerroux, but he did not get a seat.

In 1932, Josefina Blanco filed for divorce. The same year, he was appointed Director of the Museum of Aranjuez and President of the Ateneo of Madrid. Also, the government of the Second Spanish Republic appointed him Curator of the National Artistic Heritage, but his confrontations with the Ministry because of the bad state of the palaces and museums under his direction forced his resigning. In 1933 he was the director of the Spanish Academy of Fine Arts in Rome, Italy.

He died in Santiago de Compostela, Galicia, Spain, on January 5, 1936.

==Works==

His early writings were in line with French symbolism and modernism; however, his later evolution took his works to more radical formal experiments. He despised literary realism and openly disregarded Benito Pérez Galdós, its most prominent Spanish representative. His political views, accordingly, changed from traditional absolutism (in Spain known as Carlismo) towards anarchism. This also caused him problems.

All his life he struggled to live up to his Bohemian ideals, and stayed loyal to his aestheticist beliefs. However, he had to write undercover for serialised popular novels.

Works by Valle-Inclán such as &quot;Divine Words&quot; (&quot;Divinas palabras&quot;) and &quot;Bohemian Lights (Luces de Bohemia)&quot; attack what he saw as the hypocrisy, moralising and sentimentality of the bourgeois playwrights, satirise the views of the ruling classes and target particular concepts such as masculine honour, militarism, patriotism and servile attitudes toward the Crown and the Roman Catholic Church. His dramas also featured irreverent portrays of figures from Spain&#x27;s political past and deployed crude, obscene language and vulgar imagery in a mocking attack on theatrical blandness.

In addition to being politically subversive, though, Valle-Inclán&#x27;s plays often required staging and direction that went far beyond the abilities of many companies working in the commercial theatre, often featuring complex supernatural special effects and rapid, drastic changes of scene. For this reason, some of his works are regarded as closet dramas.

Valle-Inclán also wrote major novels including the &quot;Tyrant Banderas&quot; (&quot;Tirano Banderas&quot;), which was influential on the Latin American &#x27;dictator&#x27; novel (for example, &quot;I, the Supreme&quot; by Augusto Roa Bastos), although it was received with disdain by many Latin American authors. Rufino Blanco Fombona, for example, pokes fun of &quot;the America of tambourine&quot; (&quot;la América de pandereta&quot;) of that novel where you could be in the jungle one day and the Andes the next. Some critics view him as being the Spanish equivalent to James Joyce; however, due to a lack of translations his work is still largely unknown in the English-speaking world, although his reputation is slowly growing as translations are produced.

Diego Martínez Torrón has studied and published &quot;El ruedo ibérico&quot;, the first annotated edition of this work, a lot of unpublished manuscripts of this work.

<text>Ramón Gómez de la Serna y Puig (July 3, 1888 – January 13, 1963), born in Madrid, was a Spanish writer, dramatist and avant-garde agitator. He strongly influenced surrealist film maker Luis Buñuel.

Ramón Gómez de la Serna was especially known for &quot;Greguería&quot;, a short form of poetry that roughly corresponds to the one-liner in comedy. The Gregueria is especially able to grant a new and often humorous perspective. Serna published over 90 works in all literary genres. In 1933, he was invited to Buenos Aires. He stayed there through the Spanish Civil War and the following Spanish State till the end of his life. 

==Biography==
Born into an upper-middle-class family, Gómez de la Serna refused to follow his father into law or politics and soon adopted the marginal lifestyle of a bohemian bourgeois artist, writing for the journal &quot;Prometeo&quot;, funded by his father between 1908 and 1912. In April 1909 Gómez de la Serna published the manifesto of futurism in the magazine which was translated by him into Spanish.

During the First World War, Gómez became Spain&#x27;s chief exponent of avant-garde writing, establishing a base in the literary &quot;tertulia&quot; he founded at the centre of Madrid.

This was Spain&#x27;s most famous contribution to what Roger Shattuck has called &quot;the banquet years&quot;. But behind the self-publicizing avant-garde antics, Gómez developed not only an extravagant public persona, but also his own equivalent of what Shattuck defines as a &quot;reversal of consciousness&quot;, deliberately divesting himself of conventional ways of thinking and being in order to adopt a peculiarly innovative way of looking at the world, one which influenced the younger 1927 generation of poets (as Luis Cernuda has explained).

The six or so remarkable books he published from 1914 to 1918 – &quot;El Rastro&quot; (The Flea-Market), &quot;El Doctor Inverosímil&quot; (The Improbable Doctor), &quot;Greguerías&quot; (Greguerias), &quot;Senos&quot; (Breasts), &quot;Pombo&quot; (Pombo), and &quot;El circo&quot; (The Circus) – illustrate most of his main characteristics: his search for a new fragmentary genre of short prose poems (giving them the arbitrary name of &quot;greguerías&quot;), his exaltation of trivial everyday objects, his emphasis on eroticism, his exuberant self-projection and exclusive dedication to art, his playful humour, his contemplative secular mysticism, and above all his cult of the image, especially witty surprising images.

These abound in all his works, especially his many, utterly idiosyncratic and textually pleasurable novels, such as the first real one &quot;La viuda blanca y negra&quot; (The Black and White Widow), written in 1921, inspired by his relationship with the early feminist writer, Carmen de Burgos.

It was in fact the &quot;greguerías&quot; that first attracted the attention of Valery Larbaud, who in the 1920s soon had him translated into French.

Within Spain, though his work often provoked controversy and sometimes hostility, one of his most eminent defenders was José Ortega y Gasset. Subsequently, unorganized consensus in mainstream Hispanism deemed Gómez&#x27;s work to have been overrated.
Gómez&#x27;s lack of commitment during the Republic, followed by his declaration of support for Franco after self-exile to his younger, Jewish wife&#x27;s flat in Buenos Aires at the outbreak of civil war, led to ostracism and neglect.

Despite still producing some of the most original works in Spanish of the twentieth century – the existential-surrealist novel &quot;El hombre perdido&quot; (The Lost Man) (1947) and his autobiography &quot;Automoribundia&quot; (Automoribund) [1948] – his life in exile was one of pathetic isolation and increasing poverty, neither of which were helped by the knowledge that he had left behind (and in 1947 donated to the Spanish State) the painting of the Pombo Tertulia by Gutiérrez-Solana (now given pride of place in Madrid&#x27;s Reina Sofia Museum), in addition to the cubist portrait of him painted in 1915 by Diego Rivera (which was lost during the civil war, but has apparently resurfaced). On 13 January 1963 Gómez died from natural causes. In a letter to one of his companions, he mentions acknowledging his imminent death and welcomed it.

Despite the decline in Gómez&#x27;s reputation, two notable voices in particular declared their admiration: Octavio Paz, who wrote the following in a letter to &quot;Papeles de Son Armadans&quot; in 1967: &#x27;Para mí es el gran escritor español: el Escritor o, mejor, la Escritura. Comparto la admiración, el fanatismo, de Larbaud: yo también habría aprendido el español sólo para leerlo’ (For me he is the great Spanish writer: &quot;the&quot; Writer, or rather, Writing. I share Larbaud’s admiration, his fanaticism: I also would have learned Spanish just to read him), and Pablo Neruda, who in his prologue to Ramón&#x27;s &quot;Obras selectas&quot; (Selected Works) (1971) claimed that &#x27;la gran figura del surrealismo, entre todos los países, ha sido Ramón&#x27; (the major figure of surrealism, in any country, has been Ramón).

His works have been published in 20 volumes by Círculo de Lectores/Galaxia Gutenberg (Barcelona), edited by Ioana Zlotescu.

<text>Campaign Cartographer is a Windows map creation program created by ProFantasy Software originally in 1993.

==Description==
The program was designed to draw maps for role playing and miniature war games. The CAD engine is based on FastCAD, although most of the code was written by the publishers. It includes a variety of add-ons for different genres, including fantasy, modern and science fiction. Campaign Cartographer 3 was released on June 30th, 2006 and has since been updated 9 times. There are currently 9 add-ons for Campaign Cartographer; 6 drawing add-ons that add tools, templates, symbol catalogs and 3 symbol set add-ons consisting of thousands of symbols. Campaign Cartographer has been used to illustrate novels such as &quot;Shades of Gray&quot; by Lisanne Norman,&quot; Le Temple Des Eaux-Mortes&quot; by Eric Ferris and &quot;Johannes Cabal the Detective&quot; by Jonathan L. Howard. The Forgotten Realms Interactive Atlas, published by TSR, Inc. in 1999, was likewise constructed using Campaign Cartographer.

=== Add-ons ===
The following are commercial add-ons available for the Campaign Cartographer tool.
==Reception==
In the September 1994 edition of &quot;Dragon&quot; (Issue 209), Lester W. Smith found &quot;Campaign Cartographer&quot; almost too good, and the 334-page manual almost too much, saying &quot;For those who like to invest multiple hours into creating detailed maps for their campaigns, and who have the hardware to take advantage of the program, the &quot;Campaign Cartographer&quot; software allows them to create, store, modify, and copy maps more beautiful than they could have hoped before. But for GMs with limited time to spend, the program may just be too much.&quot; However, Smith concluded that too much program was better than too little program, and gave this an above average rating of 5 out of 6, saying, &quot;The &quot;Campaign Cartographer&quot; software is sort of like a limousine of mapping programs, and some people might be better served with a rough-and-ready truck. On the other hand, this limousine isn&#x27;t that expensive, and playing with its multitude of &#x27;buttons&#x27; and &#x27;switches&#x27; is a lot of fun.&quot;

In the December 1995 edition of &quot;Arcane&quot; (Issue 1), Andy Butcher reviewed both &quot;Campaign Cartographer&quot; and its add-on &quot;Dungeon Designer&quot;:
* Butcher admired &quot;Campaign Cartographer&quot;, giving it an above average rating of 8 out of 10 and saying, &quot;&quot;Campaign Cartographer&quot; is an incredible program. It really does make it easy to create highly detailed maps of anything from a planet to a small forest.&quot;
* He was even more enthusiastic about &quot;Dungeon Designer&quot;, giving it an excellent rating of 9 out of 10 and commenting, &quot;Considering how often these kind of maps are needed in most games, this makes &quot;Dungeon Designer&quot; even more useful than &quot;Campaign Cartographer&quot; for most gamers, which is high praise indeed.&quot;

Two issues later, in the February 1996 edition of &quot;Arcane&quot; (Issue 3), Butcher gave the add-on &quot;City Designer&quot; an average rating of 7 out of 10, saying &quot;If you&#x27;re lucky enough to [have access to your computer during your game] then &quot;City Designer&quot;&#x27;s very handy indeed. On the other hand, if all you want to do is create maps to print out, &quot;Dungeon Designer&quot; is far more useful overall.&quot;

In a review of &quot;Campaign Cartographer 3&quot; in &quot;Black Gate&quot;, M Harold Page said &quot;Ultimately, &quot;Campaign Cartographer&quot; does require putting in some effort, but for map design, the results are rewarding and learning the software is not a bad way of spending a rainy Scottish afternoon.&quot;

<text>FastCAD (and EasyCAD, a 2D-only subset) is a type of computer-aided design (CAD) program for DOS and Microsoft Windows operating systems. It is also the basis for the map-drawing software Campaign Cartographer. It uses the file format extension codice_1 for its files.

The latest FastCAD release, version 7, is a full professional tool, including 3D modeling and rendering, symbol definition editing, and advanced abilities to work with multiple drawings and overlays. FastCAD is written in x86 assembly language and runs well on basic hardware.

FastCAD was written by Mike Riddle, the author of Interact for the Marinchip 9900 released in 1979, one of the first CAD programs to run on a personal computer (PC). In time, Interact became the architectural basis for early versions of AutoCAD.

<doc id="358139" wikidata="Q3747275" url="?curid=358139" title="Guadeloupe Fund">
<text>The Guadeloupe Fund () was established by Sweden&#x27;s Riksdag of the Estates in 1815 for the benefit of Crown Prince and Regent Charles XIV John, (Swedish: &quot;Karl XIV Johan&quot;) also known as &quot;Jean Baptiste Jules Bernadotte&quot;, and his heirs.

Bernadotte had been one of the most successful soldiers in Napoleon&#x27;s army. He was a Marshal of France, former minister of war and had been created Prince of Pontecorvo by Napoleon, before accepting the election as Crown Prince and heir to the Swedish throne. Under his adoptive father, the reigning and yet powerless King Charles XIII of Sweden, Crown Prince Charles John was effectively the regent of the country, and when Sweden sided with Napoleon&#x27;s enemies, Charles John came to be seen as a traitor to his native France. Upon Sweden&#x27;s accession to the Sixth Coalition, Britain&#x27;s offer of an island in the West Indies was an attempt to, in some way, compensate for this.

In 1810, British forces captured the island of Guadeloupe from the French. It was conveniently located in proximity to the Swedish colony of Saint-Barthélemy. On 3 March 1813, Guadeloupe was ceded by Britain to Sweden, which was done in order to keep the Swedish Crown Prince &quot;at least partially compensated for the donations and other property, which he had lost since being called to the succession of the Swedish throne&quot;, having also used proceeds of sales of his Italian and French property to pay off debts of Sweden and losses as a consequence of Sweden&#x27;s involvement in the Napoleonic Wars.

After France had been defeated and Napoleon exiled to Elba, the 1814 Treaty of Paris settled the terms of the peace, in which Guadeloupe, having previously been a French possession, was returned to France. On 13 August 1814, a settlement of 24 million French francs was given by Britain to Sweden as a replacement for the intended compensation. The Crown Prince, acting as regent, used about half of the sum to pay off government debts; the rest went to various projects of public benefit. In recognition of this, the Riksdag of 1815 instituted that the Crown Prince and his heirs would receive an annual installment of 300,000 Riksdaler, which was to be paid out in perpetuity.

In the middle of the 20th century the scheme came under close scrutiny. Following a settlement between Britain and the House of Bernadotte, the last payment of the fund was made in 1983.

<doc id="358141" wikidata="Q138107" url="?curid=358141" title="War of the Sixth Coalition">
<text>In the War of the Sixth Coalition () (December 1812 – May 1814), sometimes known in Germany as the Wars of Liberation (), a coalition of Austria, Prussia, Russia, Spain, the United Kingdom, Portugal, Sweden, Sardinia, and a number of German States defeated France and drove Napoleon into exile on Elba. After the disastrous French invasion of Russia of 1812 in which they had been forced to support France, Prussia and Austria joined Russia, the United Kingdom, Sweden, and Portugal, and the rebels in Spain who were already at war with France.

The War of the Sixth Coalition saw battles at Lützen, Bautzen, and Dresden. The even larger Battle of Leipzig (also known as the Battle of Nations) was the largest battle in European history before World War I. Ultimately, Napoleon&#x27;s earlier setbacks in Spain, Portugal and Russia proved to be the seeds of his undoing. With their armies reorganized, the allies drove Napoleon out of Germany in 1813 and invaded France in 1814. The Allies defeated the remaining French armies, occupied Paris, and forced Napoleon to abdicate and go into exile. The French monarchy was revived by the allies, who handed rule to the heir of the House of Bourbon in the Bourbon Restoration.

The &quot;Hundred Days&quot; War of the Seventh Coalition was triggered in 1815 when Napoleon escaped from his captivity on Elba and returned to power in France. He was defeated again for the final time at Waterloo, ending the Napoleonic Wars.

==Background: Invasion of Russia==
In June 1812, Napoleon invaded Russia to compel Emperor Alexander I to remain in the Continental System. The , consisting of as many as 650,000 men (roughly half of whom were French, with the remainder coming from allies or subject areas), crossed the Neman river on 24 June 1812. Russia proclaimed a Patriotic War, while Napoleon proclaimed a &quot;Second Polish War&quot;. But against the expectations of the Poles, who supplied almost 100,000 troops for the invasion force, and having in mind further negotiations with Russia, he avoided restoring the old Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. Russian forces fell back, destroying everything potentially of use to the invaders until giving battle at Borodino (7 September) where the two armies fought a devastating battle. Despite the fact that France won a tactical victory, the battle was inconclusive. Following the battle the Russians withdrew, thus opening the road to Moscow. By 14 September, the French had occupied Moscow but found the city practically empty. Alexander I (despite having almost lost the war by Western European standards) refused to capitulate, leaving the French in the abandoned city of Moscow with little food or shelter (large parts of Moscow had burned down) and winter approaching. In these circumstances, and with no clear path to victory, Napoleon was forced to withdraw from Moscow.

So began the disastrous Great Retreat, during which the retreating army came under increasing pressure due to lack of food, desertions, and increasingly harsh winter weather, all while under continual attack by the Russian army led by Commander-in-Chief Mikhail Kutuzov, and other militias. Total losses of the Grand Army were at least 370,000 casualties as a result of fighting, starvation and the freezing weather conditions, and 200,000 captured. By November, only 27,000 fit soldiers re-crossed the Berezina river. Napoleon now left his army to return to Paris and prepare a defence of the Duchy of Warsaw against the advancing Russians. The situation was not as dire as it might at first have seemed; the Russians had also lost around 400,000 men, and their army was similarly depleted. However, they had the advantage of shorter supply lines and were able to replenish their armies with greater speed than the French, especially because Napoleon&#x27;s losses of cavalry and wagons were irreplaceable.

==Formation of the Sixth Coalition==
=== Russia, Britain and Sweden form an alliance ===

At the beginning of 1812 Britain had already been at war with France for eight years, and had been fighting alongside the Portuguese and Spanish in the Peninsular War for more than three years.
Russia and Sweden, which had opposed Napoleon up to 1807 and 1810 respectively, had been forced to join his Continental System against Britain, but continued to trade secretly with her.
On 9 January 1812, French troops suddenly occupied Swedish Pomerania, ostensibly to end the illegal trade with the United Kingdom from Sweden, which was in violation of the Continental System. Swedish estates were confiscated and Swedish officers and soldiers were taken as prisoners.

In response, Charles John, formerly French Marshal Jean Baptiste Bernadotte, now the Crown Prince and Regent of Sweden, declared neutrality, and though Sweden was still at war with Britain, and Russia was its perennial enemy, he dispatched diplomats to London and St. Petersburg to create a new coalition against France. Sweden then signed the secret Treaty of Saint Petersburg with Russia against France and Denmark–Norway on 5 April 1812. On 18 July 1812, the Treaty of Örebro formally ended the wars between Britain and Sweden and Britain and Russia, forming the basis of coalition between Russia, Britain, and Sweden, though the exact parameters of a military alliance remained in negotiation throughout the winter of 1812-1813. When Napoleon marched on Moscow in June 1812, neither Britain nor Sweden was able to give direct military support to Russia, though that same month the British and Spanish armies had advanced into central Spain, defeating the French at Salamanca and capturing Madrid, tying down a French army of 230,000. Britain also helped subsidize the Russian war effort while Charles John had struck up a friendship with Alexander, and gave him moral support, strategic and tactical advice on how to defeat the French, as well as valuable insights on Napoleon himself (having had much contact with Napoleon as a member of the extended Imperial Family). However Russia bore the brunt of the French onslaught on her territory alone.

After the French retreated from Moscow on 18/19 October 1812 and suffered heavy casualties due to extreme cold, food shortages and repeated Russian attacks, Napoleon did not seem to be as invincible as before. On 14 December, the last French troops had left Russian soil, and Paris&#x27; allies were seriously considering rebellion and joining the Tsar&#x27;s side.

=== Defection of Prussia ===
The Convention of Tauroggen was a truce signed 30 December 1812 at Tauroggen between Generalleutnant Ludwig Yorck von Wartenburg on behalf of his Prussian troops (who had been compelled to augment the during the invasion of Russia), and by General Hans Karl von Diebitsch of the Imperial Russian Army. According to the Treaty of Tilsit (9 July 1807), Prussia had to support Napoleon&#x27;s invasion of Russia. This resulted in some Prussians leaving their army to avoid serving the French, like Carl von Clausewitz, who joined Russian service. When Yorck&#x27;s immediate French superior Marshal MacDonald, retreated before the corps of Diebitsch, Yorck found himself isolated. As a soldier his duty was to break through, but as a Prussian patriot his position was more difficult. He had to judge whether the moment was favorable for starting a war of liberation; and, whatever might be the enthusiasm of his junior staff-officers, Yorck had no illusions as to the safety of his own head, and negotiated with Clausewitz. The Convention of Tauroggen armistice, signed by Diebitsch and Yorck, &quot;neutralized&quot; the Prussian corps without consent of their king. The news was received with the wildest enthusiasm in Prussia, but the Prussian Court dared not yet throw off the mask, and an order was despatched suspending Yorck from his command pending a court-martial. Diebitsch refused to let the bearer pass through his lines, and the general was finally absolved when the Treaty of Kalisch (28 February 1813) definitely ranged Prussia on the side of the Allies.

Meanwhile, Austria&#x27;s alliance with France ended in February 1813, and Austria then moved to a position of armed neutrality. It would not declare war on France until half a year later, in August 1813.

=== Declarations of war ===
On 3 March 1813, after lengthy negotiations, the United Kingdom agreed to Swedish claims to Norway. Sweden entered a military alliance with the United Kingdom and declared war against France, liberating Swedish Pomerania shortly thereafter. On 17 March, King Frederick William III of Prussia published a call to arms to his subjects, &quot;An Mein Volk&quot;. Prussia had declared war on France on 13 March, which was received by the French on 16 March. The first armed conflict occurred on 5 April in the Battle of Möckern, where combined Prusso-Russian forces defeated French troops.

Meanwhile, Napoleon withdrew some 20,000 troops from the ongoing Peninsular War to reinforce his position in Central Europe, which left his Iberian forces weakened and vulnerable to Anglo–Spanish–Portuguese attacks. On 17 March 1813, his brother King Joseph Bonaparte of Spain withdrew from Madrid, a clear sign of losing control. Wellington led a 123,000-strong army across northern Spain, taking Burgos in late May, and decisively defeating Jourdan at the Battle of Vitoria on 21 June. Marshal Soult failed to turn the tide in his large-scale Battle of the Pyrenees (25 July to 2 August).

In June, the United Kingdom formally entered the coalition. Initially, Austria remained loyal to France, and foreign minister Metternich aimed to mediate in good faith a peace between France and its continental enemies, but it became apparent that the price was to be the dismantling of the Confederation of the Rhine, the Napoleon-controlled union of all German states aside from Prussia and Austria, and the return to France&#x27;s pre-Revolutionary borders. Napoleon was not interested in any such compromise that would in effect end his empire, so Austria joined the allies and declared war on France in August 1813.

==War in Germany==
=== Spring campaign of 1813 ===

Napoleon vowed that he would create a new army as large as that he had sent into Russia, and quickly built up his forces in the east from 30,000 to 130,000 and eventually to 400,000. Napoleon inflicted 40,000 casualties on the Allies at Lützen (near Leipzig, 2 May) and Bautzen (20–21 May 1813) but his army lost about the same number of men during those encounters. Both battles involved total forces of over 250,000 – making them among the largest battles of the Napoleonic Wars to that point in time. The lack of horses for Napoleon&#x27;s cavalry did not allow him to follow up his victories with a vigorous pursuit, robbing him of decisive results.

Despite losing as many men as the Allies, Napoleon&#x27;s victories had greatly demoralized the Prussians and Russians. Losses were heavy, and the Russian and Prussian forces were a shambles. Both Allied armies were in dire need of substantial reinforcements en route from the east and from Prussian recruiting depots. Many Russian officers yearned to return to Russia having achieved their goal of ridding Russia of the French. Frederick William of Prussia had always viewed a renewed war with France as dubious, and the two defeats at Lützen and Bautzen had led him to reconsider peace. Moreover, the Prussians and the Russians were hopeful of bringing the Austrians into the war and a break in the fighting would give them time to negotiate with Vienna. Another victory by Napoleon may very well have led to a favorable peace as not only were the Russians and Prussians at their nadir, but the Austrians, with their 150,000 troops would have seen a decisive French victory as ample proof that another war with France would be most undesirable.

Despite the two victories over the Prussians and Russians, French losses had been heavy and a chronic lack of horses for his cavalry meant that Napoleon could not fully exploit his victories and inflict a decisive defeat in the same vein as Austerlitz or Friedland. Napoleon&#x27;s new army was filled with fresh conscripts, lacked many necessities and was exhausted from their long march from France and Napoleon&#x27;s rapid maneuvering. The French were &quot;in dire need of a period of reconstruction and recuperation&quot; and Napoleon needed time to acquire horses for his depleted cavalry and bring up more reinforcements. Therefore, Napoleon was amiable to the armistice offered by the Allies despite the Allies being in a grave condition. During the armistice, a disastrous interview with Austrian Chancellor Metternich, in which Napoleon heaped recriminations on the Austrians and threw his hat to the ground and stamped it with his foot, ensured that Austria would join the coalition against France. Napoleon did not know it at the time, but the armistice would turn out to be a grave mistake as the Allies gained far more from the suspension of hostilities than he did.

Meanwhile, on 21 May 1813, a Swedish corps of 15,000 commanded by General Döbeln occupied Hamburg without orders from Bernadotte, following a Danish declaration that they would hold the city for Napoleon, irrevocably binding Denmark to France, an action that would guarantee full Swedish cooperation in North Germany. The Swedish occupation of Hamburg came as welcome news to the Allies, insofar as holding a wealthy center of finance was a blow against Napoleon. However, Bernadotte&#x27;s initial misgivings at extending his troops so far from the Allied lines, with British General Hope calling Döbeln, who was later court-martialed for disobeying orders &quot;the mad Swedish General&quot;, were validated when Marshal Davout approached Hamburg with a French force of 34,000, intent on retaking the city. The Swedes quietly withdrew on 26 May and Davout would occupy the city until after Napoleon&#x27;s abdication in 1814. It would be the last major action of the Spring before the Armistice of Pläswitz.

=== Armistice of Pläswitz; Austria joins the Coalition and creation of the Trachenberg Plan ===

The belligerents declared an armistice from 4 June 1813 which lasted until 13 August, during which time both sides attempted to recover from approximately a quarter of a million losses since April. During this time Allied negotiations finally brought Austria out in open opposition to France (like Prussia, Austria had moved from nominal ally of France in 1812 to armed neutral in 1813). Two principal Austrian armies deployed in Bohemia and Northern Italy, adding 300,000 troops to the Allied armies. In total the Allies now had around 800,000 frontline troops in the German theatre, with a strategic reserve of 350,000. As a consequence of the armistice, the French lost their initial advantage in numbers as the Austrians, and Russia&#x27;s huge manpower reserves, were brought to the front.

Napoleon succeeded in bringing the total imperial forces in the region up to around 650,000 (although only 250,000 were under his direct command, with another 120,000 under Nicolas Charles Oudinot and 30,000 under Davout). The Confederation of the Rhine furnished Napoleon with the bulk of the remainder of the forces, with Saxony and Bavaria as principal contributors. In addition, to the south, Murat&#x27;s Kingdom of Naples and Eugène de Beauharnais&#x27;s Kingdom of Italy had a combined total of 100,000 men under arms. In Spain an additional 150–200,000 French troops were being steadily beaten back by Spanish and British forces numbering around 150,000. Thus in total around 900,000 French troops were opposed in all theatres by somewhere around a million Allied troops (not including the strategic reserve being formed in Germany).

During the armistice, three Allied sovereigns, Alexander of Russia, Frederick William of Prussia, and Carl Johan of Sweden (by then Regent of the kingdom due to his adoptive father&#x27;s illness) met at Trachenberg Castle in Silesia to coordinate the war effort. Allied staffs began creating a plan for the campaign wherein Bernadotte once again put to use his fifteen years of experience as a French general as well as his familiarity with Napoleon. The result was the Trachenberg Plan, authored primarily by Carl Johan of Sweden and the Austrian Chief of Staff, Field-Marshal Lieutenant Joseph Radetzky, that sought to wear down the French using a Fabian strategy, avoiding direct combat with Napoleon, engaging and defeating his marshals whenever possible and slowly encircling the French with three independent armies until the French Emperor could be cornered and brought to battle against vastly superior numbers.

Following the conference, the Allies stood up their three armies: The Army of Silesia, with 95,000 Prussians and Russians, commanded by Field Marshal Gebhard von Blücher; the Army of the North, 120,000 Swedes, Russians, Prussians, and German troops from Mecklenburg, the Hanseatic cities and North Germany, under the independent command of Sweden&#x27;s Crown Prince Carl Johan; and the Army of Bohemia, the primary Allied force in the field, with which the Allied sovereigns Alexander, Francis and Frederick William oversaw the Campaign, numbering 225,000 Austrians, Russians, and Prussians commanded by Prince Karl von Schwarzenberg.

=== Renewal of hostilities; French losses and defecting allies ===

Following the end of the armistice, Napoleon seemed to have regained the initiative at Dresden (26–27 August 1813), where he inflicted one of the most lop-sided losses of the era on the Prussian-Russian-Austrian forces. On 26 August, the Allies under Prince von Schwarzenberg attacked the French garrison in Dresden. Napoleon arrived on the battlefield in the early hours of 27 August with the Guard and other reinforcements and despite being severely outnumbered having only 135,000 men to the Coalition&#x27;s 215,000, Napoleon chose to attack the Allies. Napoleon turned the Allied Left Flank, and in skilful use of terrain, pinned it against the flooded Weißeritz river and isolated it from the rest of the Coalition Army. He then gave his famed cavalry commander, and King of Naples, Joachim Murat leave to destroy the surrounded Austrians. The day&#x27;s torrential rain had dampened gunpowder, rendering the Austrians&#x27; muskets and cannon useless against the sabers and lances of Murat&#x27;s Cuirassiers and Lancers who tore the Austrians to shreds, capturing 15 standards and forcing the balance of three divisions, 13,000 men, to surrender.

The Allies were forced to retreat in some disorder having lost nearly 40,000 men to only 10,000 French. However, Napoleon&#x27;s forces were also hampered by the weather and unable to close the encirclement the Emperor had planned before the Allies narrowly slipped the noose. So while Napoleon had struck a heavy blow against the Allies, several tactical errors had allowed the Allies to withdraw, thus ruining Napoleon&#x27;s best chance at ending the war in a single battle. Nonetheless, Napoleon had once again inflicted a heavy loss on the primary Allied Army despite being outnumbered and for some weeks after Dresden Schwarzenberg declined to take offensive action.

However at about the same time the French sustained several serious defeats, first at the hands of Bernadotte&#x27;s Army of the North on 23 August, with Oudinot&#x27;s thrust towards Berlin beaten back by the Prussians, at Großbeeren. At the Katzbach the Prussians, commanded by Blücher, took advantage of Napoleon&#x27;s march toward Dresden to attack Marshal MacDonald&#x27;s Army of the Bober. During a torrential rainstorm on 26 August, and due to conflicting orders and a breakdown of communications, MacDonald&#x27;s several corps found themselves isolated from one another with many bridges over the Katzback and Neisse rivers destroyed by surging waters. 200,000 Prussians and French collided in a confused battle that degenerated into hand-to-hand combat. However, Blücher and the Prussians rallied their scattered units and attacked an isolated French corps and pinned it against the Katzbach, annihilating it; forcing the French into the raging waters where many drowned. The French suffered 13,000 killed and wounded and 20,000 captured. The Prussians lost but 4,000 men.

Napoleon himself, lacking reliable and numerous cavalry, was unable to prevent the destruction of a whole army corps, which had isolated itself pursuing the enemy following the Battle of Dresden without support, at the Battle of Kulm (29–30 August 1813), losing 13,000 men further weakening his army. Realizing that the Allies would continue to defeat his subordinates, Napoleon began to consolidate his troops to force a decisive battle.

The French then suffered another grievous loss at the hands of Bernadotte&#x27;s army on 6 September at Dennewitz where Ney was now in command, with Oudinot now as his deputy. The French were once again attempting to capture Berlin, the loss of which Napoleon believed would knock Prussia out of the War. However, Ney blundered into a trap set by Bernadotte and was stopped cold by the Prussians, and then routed when the Crown Prince arrived with his Swedes and a Russian corps on their open flank. This second defeat at the hands of Napoleon&#x27;s ex-Marshal was catastrophic for the French, with them losing 50 cannon, four Eagles and 10,000 men on the field. Further losses occurred during the pursuit that evening, and into the following day, as the Swedish and Prussian cavalry took a further 13,000–14,000 French prisoners. Ney retreated to Wittenberg with the remains of his command and made no further attempt at capturing Berlin. Napoleon&#x27;s bid to knock Prussia out of the war had failed; as had his operational plan to fight the battle of the central position. Having lost the initiative, he was now forced to concentrate his army and seek a decisive battle at Leipzig.

Compounding the heavy military losses suffered at Dennewitz, the French were now losing the support of their German vassal states as well. News of Bernadotte&#x27;s victory at Dennewitz sent shock waves across Germany, where French rule had become unpopular, inducing Tyrol to rise in rebellion and was the signal for the King of Bavaria to proclaim neutrality and begin negotiations with the Austrians (on the basis of territorial guarantees and Maximilian&#x27;s retention of his crown) in preparation of joining the Allied cause. A body of Saxon troops had defected to Bernadotte&#x27;s Army during the battle and Westphalian troops were now deserting King Jérôme&#x27;s army in large numbers. Following a proclamation by the Swedish Crown Prince urging the Saxon Army (Bernadotte had commanded the Saxon Army at the Battle of Wagram and was well liked by them) to come over to the Allied cause, Saxon generals could no longer answer for the fidelity of their troops and the French now considered their remaining German allies unreliable. Later, on 8 October 1813, Bavaria officially ranged itself against Napoleon as a member of the Coalition.

=== Battle of Leipzig and the Frankfurt peace proposals ===

Napoleon withdrew with around 175,000 troops to Leipzig in Saxony where he thought he could fight a defensive action against the Allied armies converging on him. There, at the so-called Battle of Nations (16–19 October 1813) a French army, ultimately reinforced to 191,000, found itself faced by three Allied armies converging on it, ultimately totalling more than 430,000 troops. Over the following days the battle resulted in a defeat for Napoleon, who however was still able to manage a relatively orderly retreat westwards. However, as the French forces were pulling across the White Elster, the bridge was prematurely blown and 30,000 troops were stranded to be taken prisoner by the Allied forces.

Napoleon defeated an army of his former ally Bavaria at the Battle of Hanau (30–31 October 1813) before pulling what was left of his forces back into France. Meanwhile, Davout&#x27;s corps continued to hold out in its Siege of Hamburg, where it became the last Imperial field force east of the Rhine.

The Allies offered peace terms in the Frankfurt proposals in November 1813. Napoleon would remain as Emperor of France, but it would be reduced to its &quot;natural frontiers&quot;. That meant that France could retain control of Belgium, Savoy and the Rhineland (the west bank of the Rhine river), while giving up control of all the rest, including all of Poland, Spain and the Netherlands, and most of Italy and Germany. Metternich told Napoleon these were the best terms the Allies were likely to offer; after further victories, the terms would be harsher and harsher. Metternich aimed to maintain France as a balance against Russian threats, while ending the highly destabilizing series of wars.

Napoleon, expecting to win the war, delayed too long and lost this opportunity; by December the Allies had withdrawn the offer. When his back was to the wall in 1814 he tried to reopen peace negotiations on the basis of accepting the Frankfurt proposals. The Allies now had new, harsher terms that included the retreat of France to its 1791 boundaries, which meant the loss of Belgium and the Rhineland. Napoleon adamantly refused.

==War in Denmark and Norway==
===Swedish invasion of Denmark and the liberation of northern Germany and the Low Countries===

Following the Battle of Leipzig, Bernadotte and his Army of the North parted ways with the rest of the Coalition armies, and liberated Bremen and Lübeck in late November 1813. In early December, Bernadotte launched his long projected invasion of Denmark to secure the Coalition&#x27;s northern flank prior to the invasion of France scheduled for early 1814 and to see the treaty guarantees over the Danish cession of Norway to Sweden enforced. Bernadotte&#x27;s Army, now some 65,000, composed only of Swedish, North German and Russian troops following the secondment of the Prussian troops to Blücher&#x27;s army, attacked the Royal Danish Army in Holstein. In a lightning campaign of only two weeks the Swedes subdued the Danes.

General Anders Skjöldebrand defeated the Danes at Bornhöved on 7 December 1813. Three days later, the Danish Auxiliary Corps scored a minor victory at Sehested. However, while the Danish victory managed to ensure the retreat of the main Danish army from immediate destruction, and brought about a three-week armistice, it could not change the course of war. Following a breakdown of negotiations, the armistice concluded and on 14 January 1814 Bernadotte invaded Schleswig, swiftly invested and reduced its fortresses and occupied the entire province. The Danes, heavily outnumbered, could not prevent an Allied advance on Jutland or Copenhagen, and sued for peace. It would be the final chapter in the long and bloody history of conflicts between Sweden and Denmark with the former definitively victorious.

On 14 January 1814, the Treaty of Kiel was concluded between Sweden and Denmark–Norway. By the terms of the treaty, the Kingdom of Norway was to be ceded to the King of Sweden. Believing his primary goal of detaching Norway from Denmark and binding it with Sweden had been fully achieved, Bernadotte and the Swedish and Russian corps of his Army of the North advanced into and occupied the Low Countries. Other elements of the Army of the North were also tasked with besieging Marshal Davout&#x27;s 40,000 French and Danish troops in Hamburg, as well as the 100,000 French troops still garrisoned in fortresses throughout northern Germany. Despite several attempts by the Russian General Bennigsen to storm the city, Marshal Davout held Hamburg for France until after Napoleon&#x27;s abdication in April 1814.

=== Final battles of the war: Sweden&#x27;s Norwegian campaign ===
However, whilst Bernadotte cleared the Low Countries of the French in Spring 1814, the people of Norway objected to being bartered between kings, declared independence and adopted their own constitution on 17 May 1814. Even as fighting between the Coalition and France ended with Napoleon&#x27;s abdication, codified in the Treaty of Fontainbleau on 11 April 1814, Bernadotte found himself planning and leading yet another campaign to see the results of the Treaty of Kiel fully realized. It would be the final campaign of the War of the Sixth Coalition.

On 27 July 1814, Bernadotte, supported by the Swedish and British fleets, invaded Norway on two fronts, intending to envelop the Norwegian forces with a combined Swedish army of 40,000 well-trained, well-equipped men, many of whom were veterans of the recent Leipzig and Danish Campaigns. Facing them were 30,000 Norwegian militia, who were short on equipment, training and munitions, but full of patriotic ardor and acquitted themselves well in the face of overwhelming odds.

The Norwegians fought well, winning defensive battles at Lier and Matrand, but could not stop the advancing Swedish columns. As a consequence, an armistice (the Convention of Moss) was concluded on 14 August followed by swift negotiations. The terms of Union were generous to the Norwegians as Bernadotte and the Swedes had no wish to inaugurate the union of Sweden and Norway with further bloodshed. Norway agreed to enter into a personal union with Sweden as a separate state with its own constitution and institutions, except for the common king and foreign service. The Union between Sweden and Norway was formally established on 4 November 1814, when the Storting adopted the necessary constitutional amendments, and elected Charles XIII of Sweden as King of Norway.

The Convention of Moss, signed on 14 August 1814, concluded the last active campaign of the War of the Sixth Coalition.

==Peninsular War==

While events unfolded in the East, the Peninsular War in Iberia continued to be Napoleon&#x27;s &quot;Spanish ulcer&quot; tying down hundreds of thousands of French soldiers. In 1813, Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington, finally broke the French power in Spain and forced the French to retreat. In a strategic move, Wellington planned to move his supply base from Lisbon to Santander. The Anglo-Portuguese forces swept northwards in late May and seized Burgos; they then outflanked the French army, forcing Joseph Bonaparte into the valley of the River Zadorra. At the Battle of Vitoria, 21 June, the 65,000 French under Joseph were routed by 53,000 British, 27,000 Portuguese and 19,000 Spaniards. Wellington pursued and dislodged the French from San Sebastián, which was sacked and burnt after a siege.

The allies chased the retreating French, reaching the Pyrenees in early July. Marshal Soult was given command of the French forces and began a counter-offensive, dealing the allied generals two sharp defeats at the Battle of Maya and the Battle of Roncesvalles. Yet, he was put again onto the defensive by the British army and its Portuguese allies, lost momentum, and finally fled after the allied victory at the Battle of Sorauren (28 and 30 July).

In the Battle of the Pyrenees Wellington fought far from his supply line but won with a mixture of manoeuvre, shock and persistent hounding of the French forces.

On 7 October, after Wellington received news of the reopening of hostilities in Germany, the Coalition allies finally crossed into France, fording the Bidasoa river. On 11 December, a beleaguered and desperate Napoleon agreed to a separate peace with Spain under the Treaty of Valençay, under which he would release and recognize Ferdinand VII as King of Spain in exchange for a complete cessation of hostilities. But the Spanish had no intention of trusting Napoleon, and the fighting continued on into France.

==War in France==


During the last months of 1813 and into 1814 Wellington led the Peninsular army into south-west France and fought a number of battles against Marshals Soult and Suchet. The Peninsular army gained victories at Vera pass, the Battle of Nivelle, the Battle of Nive near Bayonne (10–14 December 1813), the Battle of Orthez (27 February 1814) and the Battle of Toulouse (10 April).

After retreating from Germany, Napoleon fought a series of battles, including the Battle of Arcis-sur-Aube, in France, but was steadily forced back against overwhelming odds. During the campaign he had issued a decree for 900,000 fresh conscripts, but only a fraction of these were ever raised. In early February Napoleon fought his Six Days&#x27; Campaign, in which he won multiple battles against numerically superior enemy forces marching on Paris. However, he fielded less than 80,000 soldiers during this entire campaign against a Coalition force of between 370,000 and 405,000 engaged in the campaign. At the Treaty of Chaumont (9 March) the Allies agreed to preserve the Coalition until Napoleon&#x27;s total defeat. After defeating the French on the outskirts of Paris, on 31 March the Coalition armies entered the city with Tsar Alexander I at the head of the army followed by the King of Prussia and Prince Schwarzenberg. On 2 April the French Senate passed the &quot;Acte de déchéance de l&#x27;Empereur&quot;, which declared Napoleon deposed.

==Aftermath==
Napoleon was determined to fight on, proposing to march on Paris. His soldiers and regimental officers were eager to fight on. But Napoleon&#x27;s marshals and senior officers mutinied. On 4 April, at Fontainebleau, Napoleon was confronted by his marshals and senior officers, led by Ney. They told the Emperor that they refused to march. Napoleon asserted that the army would follow him. Ney replied, &quot;the army will obey its chiefs&quot;.

Napoleon abdicated on 11 April 1814 and the war officially ended soon after, although some fighting continued until May. The Treaty of Fontainebleau was signed on 11 April 1814 between the continental powers and Napoleon, followed by the Treaty of Paris on 30 May 1814 between France and the Great Powers including Britain. The victors exiled Napoleon to the island of Elba, and restored the Bourbon monarchy in the person of Louis XVIII. The Allied leaders attended Peace Celebrations in England in June, before progressing to the Congress of Vienna (between September 1814 and June 1815), which was held to redraw the map of Europe.

<text>Bicester ( ) is a market town and civil parish in the Cherwell district of northeastern Oxfordshire. The town also comprises an eco-town development at North West Bicester and a self-build village at Graven Hill. Its local market is located on Sheep Street which is a pedestrian zone in the conservation area of the town. Bicester is also known for the Bicester Village shopping centre.

Bicester is one of the fastest-growing towns in Oxfordshire and has expanded rapidly in recent generations due to the town&#x27;s picturesque historical town centre, garden town layout, independent and high-street shops and restaurants as well as rail connections to London, Birmingham, and Oxford. The town is also on the East West Rail route which is due to provide links to Milton Keynes starting in 2025 which is eventually planned to extend to Cambridge. The town is similarly proximate to Brackley, Buckingham, Banbury, Milton Keynes and Aylesbury by road. A considerable volume of high-quality and environmentally friendly housing stock has been constructed, particularly at the Elmsbrook eco-town and the self-built homes at Graven Hill. Its flat topography and compact size are suited to walking and cycling, which, together with an active cycle campaign, has attracted a significant focus on developing active travel infrastructure. This includes the majority of a £14 million central government award to Oxfordshire County Council to develop safer walking and cycling schemes.

Bicester has a town council. In 2014, the government, in concert with the local planning authority, planned for Bicester to become a garden city on the basis of the size of its buffers and its distance from the Metropolitan Green Belt and to accommodate the demand of commuters to London and Oxford. Up to 13,000 new homes will be built. In 2024, Bicester elected its first Green Party mayor.

==Toponymy==
There are several theories about the origin of the name Bicester. It may be derived from a personal name Beorna, meaning the &#x27;Fort of the Warriors&#x27;, or it may from the Latin for &quot;Bi-cester&quot;, which means &#x27;two forts&#x27;—a Roman fortress at Alchester which is southwest of the town, and Chesterton village is on the course of Akeman Street, the Roman road between Watling Street and Cirencester, about northwest of Alchester Roman Town. Bicester has been inhabited since the mid-7th century and derives from earlier forms including &quot;Berncestre&quot;, &quot;Burencestre&quot;, &quot;Burcester&quot;, &quot;Biciter&quot; and &quot;Bissiter&quot;; the John Speed map of 1610 shows four different spellings, and historian G. H. Dannatt found 45 variants in wills from the 17th and 18th centuries.

==History==

===Early history===
Bicester lies close to the junction of two Roman roads – Akeman Street, an east–west route between St. Albans and Cirencester, and a north–south route between Dorchester and Towcester, which lies under Queen&#x27;s Avenue. A Roman fort at Alchester lies southwest of the town. The West Saxons established a settlement in the 6th century at a nodal point of these ancient routes.

=== Ecclesiastical history ===
St. Edburg’s Church in Bicester was founded as a minster, perhaps in the mid-7th century after St. Birinus converted Cynegils, King of Wessex, following their meeting near Blewbury. The site was just east of the old Roman road between Dorchester and Towcester that passed through the former Roman town Alchester. The earliest church was probably a timber structure serving the inhabitants of the growing Saxon settlements on either side of the river Bure, and as a mission centre for the surrounding countryside. Archaeological excavations at Procter&#x27;s Yard identified the ecclesiastical enclosure boundary, and a large cemetery of Saxon graves suggesting a much larger churchyard has been excavated on the site of the Catholic Church car park almost opposite St. Edburg&#x27;s.

The first documentary reference is the Domesday Book of 1086 which records it as &quot;Berencestra&quot;, its two manors of Bicester and Wretchwick being held by Robert D&#x27;Oyly who built Oxford Castle. The town became established as twin settlements on opposite banks of the River Bure, a tributary of the Ray, Cherwell, and ultimately the River Thames.

By the end of the 13th century, Bicester was the centre of a deanery of 33 churches. The remains of an Augustinian priory founded between 1182 and 1185 survive in the town centre. It is unclear when St. Edburg&#x27;s Church was rebuilt in stone, but the 12th-century church seems to have had an aisleless cruciform plan. The earliest surviving material includes parts of the nave&#x27;s north wall, parts of an originally external zigzag string course, the north and south transepts, and the external clasping buttresses of the chancel. The triangular-headed opening at the end of the north wall of the nave was probably an external door of the early church. Three round-headed Norman arches at the end of the nave mark the position of a 13th-century tower.

The Augustinian Priory was founded by Gilbert Bassett around 1183, and endowed with land and buildings around the town and in other parishes including and the quarry at Kirtlington, at what is now called Wretchwick, at Stratton Audley, and on Gravenhill and Arncott. It also held the mill at Clifton and had farms let to tenants at Deddington, Grimsbury, Waddesdon, and Fringford. Although these holdings were extensive and close to the market at Bicester, they appear to have been poorly managed and did not produce much income for the priory.

The priory appropriated the church in the early 13th century. The church was expanded with a south aisle, and arches were formed in the nave and south transept walls linking the new aisle to the main body of the church.

A further extension was made in the 14th century when the north aisle was built. The arched openings in the north wall of the nave are supported by octagonal columns. The Perpendicular Gothic north chapel (now vestry) is of a similar date, and on the east wall are two windows. The chapel originally had an upper chamber used later for the vicars&#x27; grammar school, accessed from an external staircase which forms part of the north eastern buttress.

In the 15th century, the upper walls of the nave were raised to form a clerestory with square-headed Perpendicular Gothic windows. The earlier central tower and its nave arch was taken down and the nave roof rebuilt (the present roof is a copy of this design built in 1803). The columns of the north arcade were undercut making them appear very slim and the capitals top heavy. In the east bay of the nave, there is carved decoration probably forming part of a canopied tomb originally set between the columns. The west tower was built in three stages, each stage marked by a horizontal string course running round the outside. The construction would have taken several years to complete. The battlements and crockets on the top of the tower were replaced in the mid 19th century.

The priory church was built around 1200 and enlarged around 1300 in association with the construction of the Purbeck marble tomb of St. Eadburh. This may have been the gift of the priory&#x27;s patron Henry de Lacy, 3rd Earl of Lincoln. The walled rectangular enclosure of the priory lay just south of the church. The gatehouse was on the site of &#x27;Chapter and Verse&#x27; Guesthouse in Church Lane. The dovecote and houses in Old Place Yard lie within the central precinct. St. Edburg&#x27;s House is built partly over the site of the large priory church. This was linked by a cloister to a quadrangle containing the refectory, kitchens, dormitory and prior&#x27;s lodging. The priory farm buildings lay in the area of the present church hall, and these had direct access along Piggy Lane to land in what is now the King&#x27;s End estate.

Early charters promoted Bicester&#x27;s development as a trading centre, with a market and fair established by the mid 13th century. By this time two further manors are mentioned, Bury End and Nuns Place, later known as Market End and King&#x27;s End respectively.

=== Military history ===
The town has a long-standing connection with the military. Ward Lock &amp; Co&#x27;s &#x27;Guide to Oxford and District&#x27; suggests that Alchester was &#x27;a kind of Roman Aldershot&#x27;. During the English Civil War (1642–49) Bicester was used as the headquarters of parliamentary forces. Following the outbreak of the French Revolutionary Wars from 1793, John Coker, the manorial lord of Bicester King&#x27;s End, formed an &#x27;Association for the Protection of Property against Levellers and Jacobins&#x27; as an anti-Painite loyalist band providing local militia and volunteer drafts for the army. When Oxford University formed a regiment in 1798, John Coker was elected Colonel.
Coker&#x27;s Bicester militia had sixty privates, and six commissioned and non-commissioned officers led by Captain Henry Walford. The militia briefly stood down in 1801 after the Treaty of Amiens, but when hostilities resumed in 1804, concerns over potential invasion led to the reformation of the local militia as the Bicester Independent Company of Infantry. It had double the earlier numbers to provide defence in the event of an invasion or Jacobin insurrection. The Bicester Company was commanded by a captain, with 2 lieutenants, an ensign, 6 sergeants, 6 corporals and 120 privates. Their training and drill were such that they were deemed &#x27;fit to join troops in the line&#x27;. The only action recorded for them is in 1806 at the 21st birthday celebrations of Sir Gregory O Page-Turner when they performed a &quot;feu de joie&quot; &#x27;and were afterwards regaled at one of the principal inns of the town&#x27;.

===Later history===

The Lord of the Manor of Market End was the 1st Earl of Derby Sir Thomas Stanley, who had married Lady Margaret Beaufort, mother of Henry VII. Sir Thomas placed the crown on the head of the new King Henry VII at the Battle of Bosworth, as the step-father of Henry VII he was granted many manors. In his will of 1593, the 4th Earl of Derby, Sir Henry Stanley, bequeathed the manor to his second son Sir William Stanley of Lathom, Lancashire. Fate made William the 6th Earl of Derby in 1594 when his older brother Ferdinando, the 5th Earl, mysteriously died. In 1597, the 6th Earl sold a 9,999-year lease to 31 principal tenants. This in effect gave the manorial rights to the leaseholders, &#x27;purchased for the benefit of those inhabitants or others who might hereafter obtain parts of the demesne&#x27;. The leaseholders elected a bailiff to receive the profits from the bailiwick, mainly from the administration of the market and distribute them to the shareholders. From the bailiff&#x27;s title the arrangement became known as the Bailiwick of Bicester Market End. By 1752, all of the original leases were in the hands of ten men, who leased the bailiwick control of the market to two local tradesmen.

A fire in 1724 had destroyed the buildings on the eastern side of Water Lane. A Nonconformist congregation was able to acquire a site that had formerly been the tail of a long plot occupied at the other end by the King&#x27;s Arms. Their chapel built in 1728 was &#x27;surrounded by a burying ground and ornamented with trees. At the southern and downstream end of Water Lane, there were problems of pollution from animal dung from livery stables on the edge of town associated with the London traffic.
Edward Hemins was running a bell-foundry in Bicester by 1728 and remained in business until at least 1743. At least 19 of his church bells are known to survive, including some of those in the parishes of Ambrosden, Bletchingdon, Piddington and Wootton in Oxfordshire and Culworth in Northamptonshire.

King&#x27;s End had a substantially lower population and none of the commercial bustle found on the other side of the Bure. The manorial lords, the Cokers, lived in the manor house from 1584. The house had been rebuilt in the early 18th century remodelled in the 1780s. The park was enlarged surrounded by a wall after 1753 when a range of buildings on the north side of King&#x27;s End Green were demolished by Coker. A westward enlargement of the park also extinguished the road that followed the line of the Roman road. This partly overlapped a pre-1753 close belonging to Coker. The effect of the enlargement of the park was to divert traffic at the Fox Inn through King&#x27;s End, across the causeway to Market Square and Sheep Street before returning to the Roman road north of Crockwell.

The two townships of King&#x27;s End and Market End evolved distinct spatial characteristics. Inns, shops and high status houses clustered around the triangular market place as commercial activity was increasingly concentrated in Market End. The bailiwick lessees promoted a much less regulated market than that found in boroughs elsewhere. Away from the market, Sheep Street was considered &#x27;very respectable&#x27; but its northern end at Crockwell was inhabited by the poorest inhabitants in low quality, subdivided and overcrowded buildings.

By 1800, the causeway had dense development forming continuous frontages on both sides. The partially buried watercourses provided a convenient drainage opportunity, and many houses had privies discharging directly into the channels. Downstream, the Bure ran parallel with Water Lane, then the main road out of town towards London. Terraces of cottages were built backing onto the brook, and here too these took advantage of the brook for sewage disposal, with privies cantilevered out from houses over the watercourse. Town houses took their water from wells dug into the substrate which became increasingly polluted by leaching of waste through the alluvial bed of the Bure.

Until the early 19th century, the road from the market place to King&#x27;s End ran through a ford of the Bure brook and on to the narrow embanked road across the boggy valley. The causeway became the focus for development from the late 18th century as rubbish and debris was dumped on each side of the road to form building platforms. Minor channels of the braided stream were encased and culverted as construction proceeded.

During the First World War, an airfield was established north of the town for the Royal Flying Corps. This became a Royal Air Force station, and is now Bicester Airfield, the home of Windrushers Gliding Club, which was absorbed into the military gliding club previously based there, to re-emerge in 2004 when the military club left the airfield. There is now a campaign by the BCH to turn the RAF centre into a museum. An epitome of historical Royal Air Force (RAF) locations in the UK, RAF Bicester represents the most comprehensive portrayal of bomber airfield advancements up until 1939. Notably, it stands as the best-maintained of the bomber bases, a key component of Sir Hugh Trenchard&#x27;s RAF expansion strategy starting in 1923.

The MoD&#x27;s largest ordnance depot at MoD Bicester is just outside the town. The depot has its own internal railway system, the Bicester Military Railway.

==Geography==
Bicester is in north Oxfordshire, east-northeast of Oxford, near the Buckinghamshire and Northamptonshire boundaries.
===Areas and suburbs===
There are 5 electoral wards, North, East, South, West and Town as defined by the town council. The areas of Bicester include:

===Climate===
Bicester experiences an oceanic climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Cfb&quot;) similar to almost all of the United Kingdom.

== Architecture ==

The vernacular buildings of the town have features of both the Cotswold dip slope to the northwest and the Thames Valley to the southeast. The earliest surviving buildings of the town are the medieval church of St Edburg; the vicarage of 1500 and two post Dissolution houses in the former Priory Precinct constructed from reused medieval material. These buildings are mainly grey oolitic limestone, from the Priory Quarry at Kirtlington, west on Akeman Street, some ginger lias (ironstone) comes from the area around Banbury and white and bluish grey cornbrash limestone was quarried in Crockwell and at Caversfield to the north.

Early secular buildings were box framed structures, using timber from the Bernwood Forest. Infilling of frames was of stud and lath with lime render and limewash. Others were of brick or local rubble stonework. The river valleys to the south and east of the town were the source of clay for widespread local production of brick and tile. In the 18th and 19th centuries, the Page-Turners had brick fields at Wretchwick and Blackthorn which operated alongside smaller producers such as farmer George Coppock who produced bricks as a sideline.

Local roofing materials included longstraw thatch, which persisted on older and lower status areas on houses and terraced cottages. Thatch had to be laid at pitches in excess of 50 degrees. This generated narrow and steep gables which also suited heavy limestone roofs made with Stonesfield slate or other roofing slabs from the Cotswolds. The other widespread roofing material was local red clay plain tiles. 19th century bulk transport innovations associated with canal and railway infrastructure allowed imports of blue slate from North Wales. These could be laid at much more shallow pitches on fashionable high status houses.

Apart from imported slate, a striking characteristic of all of the new buildings of the early 19th century is the continued use of local vernacular materials, albeit in buildings of non-vernacular design. The new buildings were constructed alongside older wholly vernacular survivals and sometimes superficially updated with fashionable applied facades, fenestration or upper floors and roofs.

== Transport ==

=== Road ===
The town&#x27;s nearest motorway is the M40 motorway, which is served by junction 9 to the south, an interchange with the A34 towards Oxford and the A41 for Bicester and Aylesbury. Bicester has a ring road which is made up of the A41, A4095, A4421, and the newly completed Vendee Drive which forms part of the B4030.

=== Rail ===
Bicester benefited from the Railway Mania of the 1840s. The Buckinghamshire Railway was fully opened between and on 20 May 1851, running through the eastern side of Bicester, with &quot;a neat station at the bottom of the London road&quot; being opened on 1 October 1850 to serve the town. Bicester&#x27;s first fatal railway accident occurred at this station on 6 September 1851. Six people were killed and 18 injured. The station was renamed Bicester London Road station in March 1954 and Bicester Town station in May 1987.

The Great Western Railway sought to shorten its mainline route from London Paddington to Birmingham Snow Hill and, in 1910, opened the Bicester cut-off line through the north of the town, to complete a new fast route between the two cities and a large railway station on Buckingham Road named , which was opened on 1 July 1910. The final slip coach on the British Railways network was &quot;slipped&quot; at Bicester North on 10 September 1960.

The Bletchley - Oxford line was closed on 1 January 1968, but partly reopened on 11 May 1987, when a shuttle service was instituted between Bicester Town and Oxford. The line towards Bletchley remains closed. In 2011, funding for East West Rail was approved, with a plan to restore passenger services between Oxford and Bletchley via Bicester in 2017, then continuing to or . A further proposal was to extend the route through as far as and , but that did not materialise. At the end of 2017, the Department for Transport announced further government funding and a private company to build and operate the line by 2025.

Bicester has also benefited from the Chiltern Evergreen 3 project, which created a new mainline allowing trains to run from London Marylebone to Oxford via Bicester. The station was completely rebuilt and, despite objection by some local residents, renamed Bicester Village, after a large retail centre nearby. The station opened in October 2015.

The London to Birmingham line was run down in the 1970s. With the threat of partial closure, stretches of the line singled and trains rerouted into London, Marylebone. Following privatisation, Chiltern Railways was awarded the franchise. It reinstated the double track and considerably boosted the number of services, resulting in a substantial increase in patronage.

=== Bus ===
Stagecoach East route X5 links Bicester with Bedford, Milton Keynes and Oxford. Stagecoach in Oxfordshire buses link Bicester with Oxford, Banbury, Brackley, Headington, HM Prison Bullingdon and some local villages. Grayline and Hallmark Connections provide some local bus services, and Langston &amp; Tasker runs a limited service between Bicester and Buckingham. In late 2022 Diamond Bus South East, who had acquired Hallmark Connections, announced that service 250 which connected Bicester with Oxford via a number of villages would cease operating on Saturday 11 February 2023. A partial replacement will be provided by new Grayline service 24 from Monday 13 February 2023. 

=== Air ===
Bicester is within an hour&#x27;s drive of three major airports and from Oxford Airport. Luton Airport is the nearest major airport, by road, taking around 1 hour 5 minutes. Due to the town&#x27;s location beside the M40 motorway, it is a slightly shorter journey time of 51 minutes to Heathrow Airport which is away and 54 minutes to Birmingham Airport which is away. Bicester Airfield, available for private flights, is located adjacent to the town of Bicester to the north.

== Governance ==

There are three tiers of local government covering Bicester, at civil parish (town), district and county level: Bicester Town Council, Cherwell District Council and Oxfordshire County Council. The town council is based at The Garth on Launton Road.

===Administrative history===
Bicester was an ancient parish. It was subdivided into two townships, called King&#x27;s End and Market End. Such townships became civil parishes in 1866. The parish historically also included Stratton Audley, which was a chapelry of Bicester until it was made a separate parish around 1455.

An attempt to establish a local government district covering the whole parish of Bicester was rejected at a public meeting in 1858. Instead, separate local government districts were established for King&#x27;s End in 1859 and Market End in 1862, with each district having its own local board responsible for providing services including water supply, sewage treatment and street maintenance. The government merged the two districts into a single Bicester district in 1875. Such local government districts were reconstituted as urban districts under the Local Government Act 1894.

In 1946, Bicester Urban District Council bought The Garth, a large 1840s house, for £6,500. The main building was converted into the council&#x27;s headquarters, and the grounds were opened to the public as Garth Park. Bicester Urban District was abolished in 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972. District-level functions passed to the new Cherwell District Council. A successor parish called Bicester covering the area of the abolished urban district was created as part of the 1974 reforms, with its parish council adopting the name Bicester Town Council.

===Residents&#x27; associations===
Bicester has several active residents&#x27; associations including: Bure Park Residents&#x27; Association; Langford Village Community Association; Priory Lane Residents&#x27; Association, Derwent Green Residents Group and Bicester Parkland View Residents&#x27; Association.

== Schools ==
Bicester has three secondary schools: The Bicester School, the Cooper School, and Whitelands Academy. There are a number of primary schools including: Langford Village Primary; Glory Farm Primary School; Southwold; Brookside Primary School; St Edburg&#x27;s; Five Acres; Longfields; St Mary&#x27;s Primary School; King&#x27;s Meadow, Bure Park Primary and Gaglebrook Primary School. The new Kingsmere development (south of Bicester) is due to create a two-form primary school.

== Media ==
Local news and television programmes are provided by BBC South and ITV Meridian. Television signals are received from the Oxford TV transmitter.

Bicester&#x27;s local radio stations are BBC Radio Oxford on 95.2 FM, Heart South on 102.6 FM, Capital Mid-Counties on 107.6 FM, Greatest Hits Radio South on 106.4 FM, Hits Radio Oxfordshire on 107.9 FM, and community based radio station 3Bs Radio that broadcast to the town as well as Buckingham and Brackley.

&quot;The Bicester Advertiser&quot; is the town&#x27;s weekly local newspaper.

== Sport and leisure ==
Bicester and North Oxford Cricket Club play at Akeman Street, Chesterton. It was formed in 1996 from a merger of Bicester Town, (founded in 1871) and the North Oxford Cricket Clubs which until 1929 shared the Oxford Road ground with the town&#x27;s football club. As of 2014 season, the senior teams play in the Cherwell League. Bicester Rugby Club was founded in 1947, originally playing on land provided by the King&#x27;s Head pub. The club is presently based at the Akeman Street Ground. The senior teams play in the Berks/Bucks &amp; Oxon Premier

Bicester Town Football Club was founded in 1896 and until the 2010–11 season played in the Hellenic League. Bicester Colts F.C. organises teams from ages 5 through to 17 at facilities based at Akeman Street, Chesterton. Bicester Blue Fins Amateur Swimming Club was established in 1950 and has been based at Bicester Leisure Centre since 1971. Bicester Blue Fins is &#x27;SWIM 21&#x27; accredited and affiliated to the Oxfordshire &amp; North Buckinghamshire ASA and the ASA South East Region.

The Bicester Leisure Centre, which opened in 1970, comprises a swimming pool, fitness, gym facilities and all-weather pitches. Other popular sports and pastimes include tennis, which is played at the Bicester Tennis Club based at the Garth. It is affiliated to the Oxfordshire and Thames Valleys LTAs. Lawn bowls is organised by the Bicester Bowls Club which was founded in 1862 and since 1951 has been at the Garth. There are two 18-hole golf courses, at the Bicester Hotel and Bicester Country Club. The traditional game of Aunt Sally, widespread in Oxfordshire, is popular in the town and is organised under the auspices of the Bicester and District Aunt Sally League.

Bicester Town Council provides a wide range of sport and leisure facilities for local residents and sports team on sites at Pingle Field and Sunderland Drive

== Shopping ==

The historic shopping streets, particularly Sheep Street and Market Square, have a range of independent and national shops together with cafés, pubs and restaurants. Sheep Street is now pedestrianised, with car parks nearby. There are weekly markets on Fridays in the town centre along with farmers&#x27; markets and an occasional French market.

A £70 million redevelopment of the part of the town centre, originally planned to start in 2008, was delayed by the onset of the credit crunch; Sainsbury&#x27;s developed the project itself, commencing in January 2009. The development, since named Pioneer Square, is now complete and opened on 9 July 2013, offering a Sainsbury&#x27;s supermarket, 7 screen Vue Cinemas and many smaller retail units and restaurants such as Nando&#x27;s and Prezzo. In early 2023, Cherwell District Council announced plans to pedestrianise the Market Square to create a continental style plaza.

South of Bicester, beyond Pingle Field, is discount brand outlet Bicester Village, and beyond that is Bicester Avenue Home &amp; Garden Centre, one of the largest garden centres in the UK.

== Churches ==

Most churches in Bicester belong to an informal local group Churches in Bicester. This enables them to work together and share responsibilities, for example the Bicester Food Bank and the Bicester Refugee Support Group.

Member churches include: Journey Communities (Pioneers in missional church); St Edburg&#x27;s Parish Church (Church of England); Emmanuel Church (Church of England, which meets in a modern building at Barberry Place); Bicester Community Church (meeting in the Salvation Army Hall); Bicester Methodist Church; The Church of the Immaculate Conception (Roman Catholic); Elim Lighthouse Church (Pentecostal – meeting in Bicester Methodist Church); Orchard Baptist Church (meeting in Cooper School); and the Salvation Army. Churches independent of Churches in Bicester are: Bicester Baptist Church (meeting in Southwold Community Centre); and Hebron Gospel Hall.

==Future developments==

Bicester is in the midst of several construction projects the most recent of these completed is the new Tesco superstore which replaces the former site in Pingle Drive. The Pigle Drive site will be used to expand the Bicester village outlet centre by an additional quarter in size.

On 1 December 2014, it was announced that Bicester had been chosen as the site for the British government&#x27;s second new garden city. Up to 13,000 new homes could be built in the town, as part of plans to help deal with the UK&#x27;s housing shortage. The former Bicester Town railway station was reopened as Bicester Village Station, to serve the expanded population as part of rail plans previously detailed by Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg. The station will also serve the planned East West Rail Project, connecting Oxford to Cambridge, via Milton Keynes and Bedford. 
In accordance with the award of garden town status, the 6,000 home Eco-Town development has been constructed at Elmsbrook, to the northwest of Bicester. These comprise homes constructed with high environmental standards and environmentally friendly technology such as photovoltaic electrical panels, rainwater harvesting, and district heating. The first residents moved into the Eco-Town development in May 2016.

Similarly, 1,585 homes (phase 1) and 709 homes (phase 2) have been built in the southwesterly development named Kingsmere. Cherwell District Council established a self-build neighbourhood at the former Ministry of Defence estate at Graven Hill, to the south of Bicester, delivered through a wholly owned subsidiary company, the Graven Hill Village Development Company. 1,900 homes were due to be built, the majority to be self-build homes with the intention of offering an alternative to the mass build volume units being constructed in the rest of the town. The first ten self-builders were featured on the Channel 4 television show &quot;Grand Designs: The Street&quot;. However, controversy has arisen through the company&#x27;s recent decision to pivot to constructing mass build volume units itself, marketed as &#x27;custom build&#x27;, with residents complaining that the company is now delivering &#x27;volume build, identikit, energy inefficient&#x27; units.

==Twin towns==
Bicester is twinned with:
* Neunkirchen-Seelscheid, Germany
* Czernichów, Poland
* Les Essarts, France

==Notable residents and natives==

<doc id="358144" wikidata="Q3273389" url="?curid=358144" title="Alien Syndrome">
<text>is a run and gun video game developed by Sega and released in arcades in 1987, and later ported to the Master System the same year. The game utilizes a side-scrolling feature that allows the player to take control of either a male (Ricky) or female (Mary) soldier whilst hunting aliens and saving hostages before they run out of time.

&quot;Alien Syndrome&quot; released with a strong opening, becoming one of Sega&#x27;s best-selling video games for the Master System. It received generally positive reviews, with praise towards the gameplay, character designs, sounds, and horror theme. It was included as a bonus game in the Genesis compilation game, &quot;Sonic&#x27;s Ultimate Genesis Collection&quot; (2009). A sequel of the same name was released in 2007 to a strong negative response from critics.

==Gameplay==
Two players control two soldiers, named Ricky and Mary, who fight their way through large eight-way scrolling levels while rescuing their comrades who are being held by aliens. At the beginning of each level, a time bomb is set onboard the infested ship and the players must complete their task before it runs out which will result in the ship being destroyed. After they have rescued a certain number of hostages, the exit opens and they can pass through it in order to fight the end-of-level guardian. If this monstrosity is defeated before times runs out, they are then able to move onto the next stage. Once all seven levels are completed, the game starts over again with more aggressive aliens, and less time on the countdown to finish the levels.
&quot;Alien Syndrome&quot; features two player simultaneous gameplay and pickups, including better weapons and maps of the current level.

==Ports==
In 1988, the game was ported to the Master System, MSX, Amiga, Atari ST, Amstrad CPC, Commodore 64, and Famicom/Nintendo Entertainment System (published by Tengen without a Nintendo license). Later, the game was ported to the ZX Spectrum (1989), Game Gear (1992), and X68000 (1992).

==Reception==
In Japan, &quot;Game Machine&quot; listed &quot;Alien Syndrome&quot; on their May 15, 1987 issue as being the third most-successful table arcade unit of the month. The original arcade version of the game was reviewed in the July 1987 issue of &quot;Computer and Video Games&quot;, where Clare Edgeley described it as &quot;one of the most gripping games&quot; she &quot;played in months&quot;, praising the &quot;Aliens&quot;-like horror atmosphere, chilling sounds, special effects, graphics and gameplay. She stated it was &quot;the first time the atmosphere and sheer addictiveness of a shoot &#x27;em up has transported me to another planet&quot; and concluded that it &quot;is fantastic&quot;.

The Master System version of the game was reviewed in &quot;Console XS&quot; magazine, giving it an 85% score. It was reviewed in 1989 in &quot;Dragon&quot;, getting two out of five stars.

==Reviews==
* &quot;Computer and Video Games&quot; (April 1988)
* &quot;Power Play&quot; (February 1988)
* &quot;The Games Machine&quot; (March 1988)
* &quot;Sega Power&quot; (December 1993)
* &quot;ACE (Advanced Computer Entertainment)&quot; (May 1988)

==Legacy==
The game was also converted to polygonal graphics for the PS2 as part of the Sega Ages re-release program and included in the US version of the &quot;Sega Classics Collection&quot; (it was removed from the European version to receive a lower age certificate). This version has updated controls, adding the use of both analog sticks, similar to that seen in &quot;Sheriff&quot;, &quot;&quot; and &quot;Smash TV&quot;. The original arcade game was also included as an unlockable in &quot;Sonic&#x27;s Ultimate Genesis Collection&quot;.

A sequel of the same name, &quot;Alien Syndrome&quot;, was released for Wii and PSP in July 2007.

<text>Sömmerda (German: &quot;Landkreis Sömmerda&quot;) is a &quot;Kreis&quot; (district) in the north of Thuringia, Germany. Neighboring districts are (from the north clockwise) the districts Kyffhäuserkreis, the Burgenlandkreis in Saxony-Anhalt, the district Weimarer Land and the district-free city Erfurt, and the districts Gotha and Unstrut-Hainich-Kreis.

==History==
The district Sömmerda was created in 1952. In 1994, the districts of Thuringia were reorganized, and the district Sömmerda was enlarged significantly by adding municipalities from the dissolved districts Artern and Erfurt-Land.
==Geography==
The main river in the district is the Unstrut. The nearby town of Kölleda is known locally as the Peppermint City because of its long history of growing aromatic and medicinal herbs.

==Coat of arms==
The coat of arms shows the three historic states which Sömmerda belonged to in the past. In the left is the Saxon symbol, to the right is the lion as symbol of Thuringia, and in the bottom is the Wheel of Mainz as the symbol of Mainz.

<text>The Grips-Theatre in Berlin (official name: GRIPS Theater) is a well-known and well-respected emancipatory children&#x27;s and youth theatre, located at Altonaer Straße at Hansaplatz in the Hansaviertel in Berlin&#x27;s Mitte district. It is &quot;the first theatre worldwide to deal sociocritically with the lives and living conditions of children and young people and to incorporate this in original humorous and musical plays&quot;. It has gained a national and international reputation, not least due to its former artistic director Volker Ludwig&#x27;s musicals for adults, such as its evergreen Linie 1, Café Mitte or the adaptation of Aldous Huxley&#x27;s Brave New World. GRIPS&#x27; plays have been re-staged over 1,500 times in some 40 languages around the world.

== History ==
=== Origins ===
In 1966, a children&#x27;s theatre was formed at the Berlin &quot;Reichskabarett&quot;, &quot;a student group that created programs and satirical sketches interspersed with topical songs&quot;. , who would go on to serve as the GRIPS-Theatre&#x27;s artistic director for nearly four decades, was one of the authors and co-founders of the group, which defined itself as part of the Außerparlamentarische Opposition (German for extra-parliamentary opposition), a political protest movement in West Germany during the latter half of the 1960s and early 1970s, which formed a central part of the German student movement. In the summer of 1966, the group began performing plays for children on weekends, starting with the satirically reworked fairy tale The Devil with the Three Golden Hairs.

Gradually, the group performed more and more plays for children to provide an alternative to the fairy tale plays that were a staple of children&#x27;s theatre at the time. Instead, the group developed plays written expressly for children and dealing with issues faced by children, which fairy tale plays addressed only insufficiently or not at all. In 1968, Volker Ludwig and his brother, the caricaturist , wrote the first of these plays, titled &quot;The Journey to Pitschepatsch&quot; (&quot;Die Reise nach Pitschepatsch&quot;). It features a girl protagonist, named Millipilli, who travels to a far-away island to save Santa Claus&#x27;s tree, which wilts away after being neglected by the adults.

In 1969, the group agreed to develop children&#x27;s plays that would include more elements of social critique. This resulted in the first sociocritical children&#x27;s play, titled &quot;&quot;Stokkerlok und Millipilli&quot;, also written by Ludwig and Hachfeld. The play follows a little boy named Maximilian who blackmails his family and surroundings into child-friendly behaviour with an ear-piercing whistle. &quot;Stokkerlok und Millipilli&quot;&quot; is considered the GRIPS-Theatre&#x27;s first play and became a great success. Theatres across Germany staged performances of the play, which was also adapted by theatres in other countries. In 1969, it was awarded the , conferred by the Berlin government.

The then relatively new concept of a modern children&#x27;s theatre with a sociocritical background wasn&#x27;t welcomed by everyone, particularly not by conservative circles. The theatre faced significant criticism for its child protagonists who were often barefaced and disrespectful towards adults. However, an emphasis on children&#x27;s emancipation and child rights was entirely intended by the authors. The children&#x27;s theatre&#x27;s ensemble cast frequently interviewed the children and youths attending their performances to learn what issues were on their minds. A recurring topic were gender roles, including the then-typical path of girls becoming housewives instead of pursuing a career, and in the 1970s, the troupe developed more and more plays dealing with that subject.

=== Split ===
In 1971, some of the actors split from the troupe and formed the children&#x27;s theatre to develop a sex education play for children. The premiere of &quot;You don&#x27;t talk about that!!! A play for sexual education&quot; (&quot;Darüber spricht man nicht!!! Ein Spiel zur Sexualerziehung&quot;) in 1973 created public uproar. The actors used sexual taboo words and taught &quot;children not to be ashamed of their bodies and their bodily functions.&quot; Whereas in West Berlin, the municipal government recommended it for elementary school classes despite harsh criticism from conservatives, &quot;Bavarian teachers were not allowed to attend the play with their children&quot;.

=== The name GRIPS ===
In 1972, the children&#x27;s theatre&#x27;s move into the Forum Theatre at Kurfürstendamm triggered a name change, with the troupe choosing the name &quot;Grips&quot;, a colloquial German term describing one&#x27;s ability to understand quickly, to symbolise that thinking is fun. Volker Ludwig is quoted as saying, &quot;[Grips is] not to give up, always have faith in that last grain of common sense, and – hardest of all – try and develop some kind of positive outlook.&quot; The graphic designer and children&#x27;s book author designed the matching logo: a black face with a big nose, peeking out from inside a cardboard box bearing the word GRIPS.

=== Move to Hansaviertel ===
In 1974, the theatre moved to its current location at Hansaplatz in the southern part of the Hansaviertel, a post-war modernist housing development. The building was designed by German architects Ernst Zinsser and Hansrudi Plarre as part of the Interbau housing development, constructed for the International Architecture Exhibition in 1957. Before the GRIPS moved in, the venue housed the &quot;Bellevue&quot; cinema. The GRIPS opened first opened at the new location on 30 September 1974. The premises were remodelled in accordance with the vision of the troupe. As it had been at the Forum Theatre, the stage was surrounded by benches, placing the actors in the middle of their audience. To this day, it remains possible to place the audience on all four sides of the stage, although one side is usually used as backdrop. As the stage isn&#x27;t raised, visitors in the first row are at the same level as the actors. The theatre has a capacity of 360-400 people. The entrance is adorned with a mosaic of caricatures by Rainer Hachfeld. As the building is integrated into the U-Bahn station Hansaplatz, theatregoers can easily reach the GRIPS by public transport.
=== First plays for youth ===
While the troupe had rather focused on children&#x27;s plays at first, it subsequently aimed to include problems that teenagers face into its concept. Following the success of &quot;Gosh, Girl!&quot; (&quot;Mensch Mädchen!&quot;), a children&#x27;s play about gender roles, the GRIPS premiered its first youth play in the autumn of 1975. Titled &quot;That&#x27;s incredible!&quot; (&quot;Das hältste ja im Kopf nicht aus&quot;), it dealt with problems faced by general school students.

=== Anti-GRIPS campaign ===
Although its first youth play earned the troupe its next Brother Grimm Award, 1975 also marked the start of a public political debate about its plays and a smear campaign against their theatre. The Berlin chapter of the Christian Democrat Party, then in opposition, labelled the actors as communists who would corrupt children and claimed that the youth play&#x27;s &quot;unwholesome language&quot; incited young people to acts of violence. In May 1975, the town councillor for youth in Berlin&#x27;s Steglitz district, Klaus Dieter Friedrich, banned a guest performance of Mensch Mädchen! not because of the play itself but because &quot;members of the GRIPS Theatre moved in the city&#x27;s communist circles&quot;. Journalists of the powerful Springer publishing house, which controls the largest share of the German market for daily newspapers, also attacked the theatre. The Berliner Morgenpost wrote that GRIPS&#x27; plays were rearing &quot;a load of political psychopaths, poor devils who would one day be their own destruction, having destroyed other things on the way&quot;. Ludwig recalled the time in an interview with Berlin daily . &quot;Starting in 1975, the Christian Democrats ran an anti-GRIPS campaign. For three years, they forced its parliamentary group to vote in favour of withholding funds from Grips and not allowing school classes to visit us. At the time, I was labelled Stalinist, Maoist and child abuser. The Springer press wrote I destroyed children&#x27;s souls. That continued until in 1981, when a Christian Democrat, [Richard von] Weizsäcker, was elected mayor. He was extremely embarrassed by it all. &#x27;Nobody will outshine us in terms of liberality,&#x27; he had someone communicate to me. And then the whole spook was over.&quot; The attacks had the opposite effect to the intended and helped raise awareness of the GRIPS-Theatre, whose shows were sold out almost every night. In 1981, the GRIPS&#x27; youth play &quot;Everything is Plastic&quot; (&quot;Alles Plastik&quot;) reignited the debate about the theatre as the play, which dealt with the apathy and no-future mentality of teenagers, included references to the struggle of the squatters in Berlin in 1981.

=== Plays for adults ===
In 1980, the GRIPS presented a play for adults. A Story of the Left (&quot;Eine linke Geschichte&quot;), performed at the GRIPS to this day, deals with three students who meet in 1966 at a rally against the American War in Vietnam. The play follows their political development amidst the German student movement and the German Autumn, a set of terror events in West Germany in late 1977. The play was continuously updated to incorporate more recent historic events, including the German reunification. Since autumn 2007, however, the repertoire reverted to the play&#x27;s original version.

=== Linie 1 ===
In 1985, Volker Ludwig wrote the musical Line 1 (&quot;Linie 1&quot;). The title refers to Berlin&#x27;s subway line U1. The music was written by German musician and composer , a longtime friend of Ludwig, and the rock band No Ticket (Thomas Keller, George Kranz, Axel Kottmann, Michael Brandt, Richard Wester, Matthias Witting). The musical premiered on 30 April 1986 and became the biggest success of the GRIPS-Theatre.

The story follows a young woman who runs away from her provincial hometown and ends up at Berlin&#x27;s notorious Zoo station, searching for a rock musician who got her pregnant on a one-night stand. She gets stuck in underground line 1 and encounters a kaleidoscope of urban characters and their fates. According to the GRIPS, &quot;it&#x27;s a show, a drama, a musical about living and surviving in a large city, hope and adaptation, courage and self-deceit, to laugh and cry at, to dream, and to think about oneself.&quot; As its other plays, Linie 1 includes sociocritical elements, but it also serves as an amusing portrait of Berlin&#x27;s society before the fall of the Berlin Wall.

The success of Linie 1 also had its drawbacks. Due to the production&#x27;s considerable costs, ticket sales no longer covered the theatre&#x27;s expenses. However, after Volker Ludwig mentioned on a talk show that the theatre would have to close without additional support, the government eventually increased its subsidies. Initially, Germany&#x27;s main stages ignored Linie 1, but when the Stuttgart State Theatre successfully ran the musical, other theatres followed suit. Linie 1 became known nationwide after several of its songs were performed on satirical TV show &quot;Scheibenwischer&quot; (windshield wipers). The show&#x27;s creator, German satirist, actor and author Dieter Hildebrandt, later had a cameo appearance in the 1988 film version of the musical.

For years, Linie 1 was the most-played German production and it remains the second-most successful musical after Bertolt Brecht&#x27;s Threepenny Opera. In 1987, the musical&#x27;s author Volker Ludwig was awarded the Mülheimer Dramatikerpreis (English: dramatist award of Mülheim), considered Germany&#x27;s leading theatre award.

To this day, the musical has been performed at over 150 German-language theatres and adapted by theatres in 15 countries, including Brazil, Canada, Denmark, Finland, Greece, Italy, India, Lithuania, Namibia, the Netherlands, Russia, South Korea, Spain, Sweden and Yemen. In Barcelona (&quot;Linea Roja&quot;), Hong Kong (&quot;Island Line&quot;), Kolkata (&quot;Chord Line&quot;), Seoul (&quot;Seoul Linie 1&quot;), Vilnius (&quot;Rule No. 1: It is forbidden to dream of Vilnius&quot;), Windhoek (&quot;Friends 4Eva&quot;) and Aden (&quot;Mak Nazl&quot;), the original play was adapted to the respective cities and retained the original music (expect for Hong Kong).

In , a young Chinese Korean woman from Yanbian comes to Seoul, travelling back and forth between the Seoul Station and the Cheongnyangni 588 red light district. The Nazi widows of the original play become widows of former military big shots. This Korean version, adapted by Kim Min-ki, became even more successful than the original in Berlin. While the GRIPS put on its 1,800th performance of Linie 1 in October 2017, Seoul Line 1 was performed over 4,000 times during the 13 years the musical belonged to the Hakchon Theatre&#x27;s repertoire. After learning about this, members of the GRIPS, translated his song Morning Dew into German, visited South Korea in 2004, and gave it to him as a gift. The title is &quot;Morgentau&quot;.

In the Namibian version, a German girl arrives in Windhoek searching for a Namibian musician she met while he was playing in Germany. She travels all over Namibia with various typical means of transport, such as minibus taxis and a donkey cart. The Wilmersdorf widows in this version are widows of former Boers still dreaming of white supremacy in Africa.

=== GRIPS today ===
Since 1992, the GRIPS owns a so-called &#x27;studio and rehearsal stage&#x27; in addition to the theatre at Altonaer Straße. Until 2009, smaller productions were staged at the Schiller-Theater Werkstatt (workshop), but since then, the GRIPS Podewil at Klosterstraße. Usually, the GRIPS releases at least four new plays and stages 300 performances per year.

When Volker Ludwig left his post as the GRIPS&#x27; artistic director at the end of the 2011/2012 season, he appointed Stefan Fischer-Fels as his successor who had previously worked at the Düsseldorfer Schauspielhaus. Due to differences in opinions, Ludwig and Fischer-Fels agreed on a premature termination of the contract in 2015, which saw Fischer-Fels returning to the Düsseldorfer Schauspielhaus. He was succeeded by in-house theatre pedagogue Philipp Harpain. Until the end of the 2016/2017 season, Ludwig remained in his role as the GRIPS&#x27; managing director before turning this post over to Harpain, too, on his 80th birthday.

At his departure, author and theatre critic Rüdiger Schaper paid tribute to Ludwig. &quot;Berlin has made several contributions to world theatre. Volker Ludwig and the Grips belong into that category. […] A miracle. What luck to have been able to witness it.&quot;

=== Ensemble ===

==== Actors ====
Several of the GRIPS-Theatre&#x27;s cast have gone on to successful careers in TV and film, including Dieter Landuris, Petra Zieser, Heinz Hoenig, Axel Prahl, Julia Blankenburg, Nadine Warmuth, and Mathias Schlung. Veteran ensemble members and Thomas Ahrens have been with the GRIPS since 1969 and 1975, respectively. Lehmann accomplished the outstanding achievement of participating in every performance of Line 1 since its premiere in 1986. Since 1981, Lehmann also serves as head of the Fritz Kirchhoff School, the oldest state-recognized private drama school in Berlin.

==== Musician ====
Axel Kottmann, George Kranz and Matthias Witting, who joined the ensemble between 1978 and 1986, formed the band Zeitgeist from 1980 to 1983. In addition, Kranz is a successful solo musician, best known for his song Din Daa Daa (Trommeltanz). In 1986, the year Line 1 premiered, Thomas Keller, Michael Brandt and Richard Wester joined. Together, the six musicians participated in composing and arranging the music of the musical, which they performed as rock band No Ticket. All but Wester are performing at the GRIPS to this day.

<doc id="358155" wikidata="Q542330" url="?curid=358155" title="Tommy Sheridan">
<text>Thomas Sheridan (born 7 March 1964) is a Scottish politician who served as convenor of Solidarity from 2019 to 2021. He previously served as convenor of the Scottish Socialist Party (SSP) from 1998 to 2004 and as co-convenor of Solidarity from 2006 to 2016. He was a Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) for the Glasgow region from 1999 to 2007.

Sheridan was active as a Militant entryist in the Labour Party until 1989 when Labour expelled him, and became a member of Scottish Militant Labour (SML), which eventually became the core of the Scottish Socialist Party (SSP). He was a prominent campaigner against the Poll tax in Scotland, and was jailed for six months for attending a warrant sale in 1991 after Glasgow Sheriff Court had served a court order on him banning his presence. He was elected to the Scottish Parliament in 1999 as a Glasgow representative and re-elected in 2003 despite, in 2000 and 2002, being jailed over the non-payment of fines levied in connection with breach of the peace convictions resulting from his actions at demonstrations against the presence of the nuclear fleet at the Faslane Naval Base.

In 2006, in the case of &quot;Sheridan v News International&quot;, he won an action for defamation against the &quot;News of the World&quot; and was awarded £200,000 damages. The following year, he was charged with perjury for having told lies to the court in his defamation case. In the following weeks, six of his relatives and colleagues were also charged. In October 2010, he appeared together with his wife Gail at a trial for perjury. On 23 December 2010, Sheridan was convicted of perjury, and on 26 January he was sentenced to three years&#x27; imprisonment. The charges against his wife were withdrawn. In the light of the &quot;News of the World&quot; phone hacking affair, the Crown Office was ordered to reassess the case in 2011. Sheridan left prison in January 2012 under automatic early release rules.

==Early life==
Sheridan&#x27;s mother was Alice Sheridan, a political activist who stood as a candidate for political groups involving her son.

Sheridan, raised in Roman Catholic faith, attended St Monica&#x27;s Primary (Pollok) and Lourdes Secondary before studying at the University of Stirling, where he received a degree in economics. He obtained a MSc in Social Research at the University of Strathclyde in 2008. He studied law at Strathclyde Law School, on the two-year fast track degree, graduating in 2015. He also played football at Junior level with Larkhall Thistle, Benburb, East Kilbride Thistle, Baillieston Juniors and St Anthony&#x27;s.

==Political career, 1983–2009==

===Early activism===
Sheridan became a member of the Militant group while a student at Stirling University in around 1983, after being active in a broad-based anti-Trotskyist group including Liberals and Communists as well as Labour Party members. After graduation, he went to Cardonald College as a typing student as part of an (unsuccessful) effort on the part of Militant to recruit Scottish Labour Students in further education colleges. The Labour Party, led by Neil Kinnock at the time, found that Militant contravened the Labour Party constitution, and Sheridan himself was expelled from the Labour Party in 1989 for &quot;bringing the party into disrepute&quot;.

From within Militant, he was the public face of a mass non-payment campaign against the Community Charge in Scotland (where it was introduced a year earlier than other parts of the UK &quot;as an experiment&quot;). The campaign involving the refusal to pay the tax, together with resistance to warrant sales which local councils held to try to recoup the money, was ultimately successful and Sheridan became a popular political figure. Sheridan denounced those who fought the police in the large-scale riot against the poll tax in London – which took place on 31 March 1990, the day before the tax was introduced in England and Wales – and publicly threatened to &quot;name names&quot;. The police widely advertised for people to tell them the names of alleged rioters, and partly as a result of police acting on such information, over 100 individuals were jailed. With Joan McAlpine, he published &quot;A Time to Rage&quot; which chronicled the anti-poll tax movement of the late-1980s and early-1990s. McAlpine has since written about the Sheridan she became close to, with reference in particular to the defamation case.

As the highest profile Militant member in Scotland, Sheridan was a leading figure in the group&#x27;s split in the early-1990s. Emboldened by the success of the campaign against the poll tax, many Militant members – particularly in Scotland – argued for the abandonment of entryism and for the creation of Scottish Militant Labour and Militant Labour in England and Wales as separate political parties.

The argument was resolved when Sheridan and his supporters won a vote at a special conference held in Bridlington in October 1991, defeating the faction around Militant founder Ted Grant who argued against abandoning the Labour Party. The result was a split in the Militant in what has become known as the &#x27;Scottish Turn&#x27;; Scottish Militant Labour had gained six councillors in Glasgow by 1993, including Sheridan. With a strong Scottish National Party (SNP), Scottish Militant Labour argued in favour of founding a new, left-wing political party. Discussions were held with other left-wing and Scottish republican groups and a new group was formed in 1996 known initially as the Scottish Socialist Alliance. In 1998, the new Scottish Socialist Party was formed from the SSA. Differences over political strategy and priorities within the Committee for a Workers&#x27; International (CWI) soon surfaced, especially on the issue of Scottish independence, leading to a split within the CWI and Sheridan along with the majority of Scottish supporters left the organisation.

Sheridan fought two elections while in prison, coming second in the Pollok constituency at the 1992 general election, gaining nearly 20%, a result ahead of three candidates, but behind the elected Labour Party MP. A few weeks later he won the Pollok ward on Glasgow District Council. He contested the European Parliament election in 1994 as the SML candidate in Glasgow, and came third with 8% of votes cast.

===Election to the Scottish Parliament===
Sheridan was a leading figure in negotiations to establish the Scottish Socialist Alliance in 1996, which evolved into the Scottish Socialist Party (SSP) in 1998. He became the convenor of the party and was elected to the Scottish Parliament in 1999 as a Glasgow representative and re-elected in 2003. Together with Alan McCombes he published &quot;Imagine&quot;, an outline of the principles of socialism for a modern era.

Sheridan was active in implementing changes in Scottish law, including the Abolition of Poindings and Warrant Sales Act 2001, which he introduced as bills in Holyrood on 6 December 2001. 

On 11 November 2004, Sheridan stepped down as convenor of the SSP, citing his wife Gail&#x27;s pregnancy as a prime reason. The resignation was steeped in controversy. It later emerged that the party&#x27;s executive committee voted unanimously to force Sheridan to resign after a 9 November meeting in which he confirmed stories printed about a then-unnamed MSP were about him, and indicated he would take legal action against the paper.

Following Sheridan&#x27;s resignation, the &quot;News of the World&quot; named him as the MSP they said had had an extramarital affair and visited a swingers&#x27; club in Manchester. The party declined to support him in legal action against the paper. He later branded those who refused to support him as &quot;scabs&quot;.

The minutes of the meeting which detailed the deliberations leading to Sheridan&#x27;s resignation were kept confidential until subpoenaed by News International. After he refused to release the minutes to the Court of Session, Alan McCombes was jailed for twelve days by Judge Lady Smith. At an emergency meeting of the party&#x27;s National Council, it was agreed the minutes should be handed over with only 60 delegates opposed in order to secure McCombes&#x27; release the following day.

The minutes included a discussion by the party&#x27;s executive committee about a recent article that alleged a married MSP had visited a swingers&#x27; club in Manchester. According to the minute, Sheridan admitted that he had in fact visited the club on two occasions, in 1996 and 2002, with close friends. Some of those present at the meeting gave evidence that they had heard Sheridan acknowledge he had been &quot;reckless&quot; in his behaviour which had, with hindsight, been &quot;a mistake&quot; and that &quot;his strategy was to deny the allegations&quot;. Sheridan claimed this minute was not accurate.

Eleven members, including four of the party&#x27;s MSPs, stated they heard Sheridan admit to visiting the swingers&#x27; club at that meeting. Rosemary Byrne MSP and two other members of the executive committee, Graham McIver and Pat Smith, gave evidence that Sheridan made no such statement. The minutes record that Sheridan left the meeting early, but before leaving, &quot;he repeated that he did not believe there was any evidence which would prove him to be lying. He did not accept that he should admit the visits to the club and felt that no-one should comment on private lives&quot;.

At the annual conference of the SSP in early 2005, Sheridan was elected to the SSP executive and at the March 2006 conference, he was elected as party co-chair. However Sheridan left the SSP in August 2006, accusing the SSP of being part of &quot;the mother of all stitch-ups&quot; involving not only their leadership, but also MI5 and News International. He launched a new political party called Solidarity.

Sheridan was originally set to re-contest the post Scottish Socialist Party convenor at the October 2006 conference, and Colin Fox claimed he had only established the new party because he did not stand a chance of winning back that role as SSP convenor.

===Activism and arrests at Faslane===
Sheridan was first arrested at the Faslane nuclear base, the location of Britain&#x27;s Trident submarine fleet, for a breach of the peace offence committed during a demonstration in February 2000. He was convicted on this count, and for resisting arrest, when the case came to trial in November, and was fined £250. Believing nuclear weapons to be illegal under international law, Sheridan made it clear at the time that he had no intention of paying the fine. He served five days of a 14-day jail sentence the next month for this reason, and was released on 22 December.

Sheridan was arrested again at Faslane on 22 October 2001 shortly after the protest began at 7am. He was cleared when the case came to court in June 2002, the Justice of the Peace said there was insufficient evidence. Another acquittal in October 2001, this time regarding a February 2001 protest, led to an appeal by the Crown Office, but this was rejected by the Court of Criminal Appeal in Edinburgh in October 2002.

Sheridan was one of the first to be arrested for a breach of the peace at a demonstration at Faslane on 11 February 2002. He was found guilty in February 2003 and fined £200, but he refused to pay and was sent to prison for non-payment on 25 August 2003. This time, he was sentenced to seven days in jail, serving 3 days, plus the night in custody after his arrest. Before presenting himself for arrest at Glasgow police station on 24 August 2003, Sheridan had told reporters: &quot;Nuclear weapons are a crime against humanity and should be removed from the Clyde and from Britain.&quot;

===Split from the Scottish Socialist Party===
In September 2006, Tommy Sheridan formed a new political party in Scotland named Solidarity, with himself and fellow MSP Rosemary Byrne as joint convenors. Sheridan narrowly failed to be re-elected in the 2007 Holyrood election as top of his party&#x27;s list nominees for Glasgow. The party also stood a candidate in by-elections in 2008 in Glasgow East and the Glenrothes, and Sheridan himself stood in the 2009 Glasgow North East by-election.

Sheridan stood as a candidate in the 2009 European Parliament elections for No to EU – Yes to Democracy, a left-wing alter-globalisation coalition led by RMT union leader Bob Crow.

Sheridan resigned as the co-convenor of Solidarity in June 2016, but returned as convener in 2019. In 2020, Solidarity signed up for Action for Independence, a new pro-independence alliance.

In March 2021 he and his wife Gail joined the Alba Party.

==Defamation action==
Hearings in Sheridan&#x27;s defamation case against the publishers of the &quot;News of the World&quot; began in the Court of Session in Edinburgh on 4 July 2006. Unusually in Scottish civil proceedings, the case was heard before a jury.

The jury heard allegations that Sheridan had visited a swingers clubs in Manchester and engaged in adulterous affairs with two women. Sheridan, who claims to be a teetotaller, reportedly drank champagne and consumed cocaine during an extramarital liaison. Sheridan denies drinking the champagne and the claim of substance abuse. Eleven members of the SSP&#x27;s executive committee testified that he admitted in an executive committee meeting to attending a swingers club with women, but another four members of the SSP who were present at that Executive meeting backed Sheridan&#x27;s claim that he made no such admission at that meeting.

On 14 July 2006, Sheridan sacked his legal team and began representing himself. His cross-examination of witnesses was described by one left commentator as &quot;sickening&quot;, singling out the cross-examination of Katrine Trolle: &quot;Sheridan questioned her about their sexual history, which included visits to Cupids with Sheridan and group sex encounters with him and his brother-in-law, Andrew McFarlane. When she stated that she was embarrassed about her past, but that she was telling the truth, Sheridan unflinching brandished her as a perjurer, plotter and gold-digger. [...] I still find it astonishing, and not a little dispiriting, that anyone on the left – any decent human being in fact – could justify traducing a female socialist&#x27;s character in court, not once, but twice, in order to protect a leading socialist politician&#x27;s false reputation.&quot;

On 4 August 2006, Sheridan won his case with a majority verdict of 7–4 and the jury awarded him maximum damages of £200,000. The &quot;News of the World&quot; has appealed the verdict. In the &quot;Scottish Socialist Voice&quot; of 8 August, a letter signed by a further six leading members of the SSP claimed that Sheridan had told them that he had admitted at an SSP Executive meeting to attending the Manchester swingers club.

The &quot;News of the World&quot; intended to appeal against what they described as the &quot;perverse&quot; decision in the immediate aftermath of the trial, and a provisional date for the hearing was set for December 2007, however it was postponed until the outcome of the procurator fiscal&#x27;s perjury probe.

===Allegations of witness intimidation===
On 10 October 2006, BBC News reported that Grampian Police were investigating a claim by Fiona McGuire, who had been a witness in the trial for the &quot;News of the World&quot;, that she had received a death threat through the post. In a statement to the BBC, Sheridan said: &quot;I utterly condemn any threats to Fiona McGuire or any other individual&quot;.

On 26 August 2007, the &quot;Sunday Herald&quot; reported that John Lynn had been questioned by detectives about allegations of witness tampering. Lynn is reportedly an associate of Paul Ferris, a reformed criminal who has become friendly with Sheridan. The report said Helen Allison, who claimed in court that she saw Sheridan having sex in a Glasgow hotel, had been approached by Lynn who asked her not to give evidence. Lynn was once jailed for 17 years for shooting an Ulster barman.

===Hidden video===
On 1 October 2006, the &quot;News of the World&quot; reignited controversy by publishing new evidence in support of its claim that Sheridan lied to the Court of Session. It was a video recording of Sheridan admitting he had visited a swingers club in Manchester on two occasions and further, that he had, as other senior SSP members claimed in court, admitted this at an Executive meeting of the SSP. The tape had been made without Sheridan&#x27;s knowledge using a hidden camera by SSP member George McNeilage in McNeilage&#x27;s house after he invited Sheridan there. McNeilage had been one of three best men at Sheridan&#x27;s wedding.

Sheridan does not appear clearly on the video at any time. The newspaper has not been able to produce any images from the video showing Sheridan&#x27;s face and Sheridan says the video is a fake. He conceded his voice was on the tape but suggested it was spliced with clips of the voice of someone else. The &quot;News of the World&quot; claimed four independent voice analysts had confirmed that the voice on the tape is that of Tommy Sheridan. However, in an interview with the BBC a forensic speech scientist, Peter French, said: &quot;Experts should never say conclusively they have identified a person and this kind of evidence should never solely be used to bring a criminal trial&quot;.

Sheridan then suggested that MI5, someone within the SSP, Rupert Murdoch and Bill Gates had conspired to concoct the videotape to undermine his campaign for an independent socialist Scotland.

===Perjury conviction===
The conflicting evidence given during the trial resulted in the judge warning several witnesses about the implications of perjuring themselves. On Monday 7 August 2006, Lothian and Borders Police said they had received two complaints of perjury, one from the former Conservative MSP Brian Monteith, the other alleged to be from the SSP&#x27;s minutes secretary.

On 22 August 2006, the Crown Office instructed the Edinburgh Procurators Fiscal office to ascertain if there were grounds for a criminal investigation. On 2 October 2006, it was concluded that there were and Lothian and Borders Police were instructed to start a criminal investigation. On 21 February 2007, &quot;The Herald&quot; reported that the Crown Office had asked Lothian and Borders Police to undertake a full inquiry after receiving a preliminary report.

In May 2007, it was reported that staff at Cupid&#x27;s Swingers Club in Manchester had told police they had been offered bribes not to co-operate with the inquiry.

On 16 December 2007, Sheridan was charged with perjury in relation to the &quot;News of the World&quot; case. In a public statement outside the police station he attributed his arrest to the &quot;powerful reach&quot; of the Murdoch press. During February 2008, his wife Gail, former SSP MSP Rosemary Byrne, former members of the SSP Executive Committee, Patricia Smith, Graeme McIver, Jock Penman, and Sheridan&#x27;s father-in-law, Angus Healey, were also charged with perjury.

On 27 January 2009, Sheridan and his wife were indicted for perjury, and were summoned to attend a pre-trial hearing at Edinburgh High Court on 26 February. however this was postponed until 11 May.

The trial started at Glasgow High Court on 4 October 2010. Sheridan&#x27;s initial defence team included Donald Findlay, who was replaced by Maggie Scott. However, a few weeks into the case, Sheridan instructed his Solicitor Aamer Anwar, who had defended him since 2007, to withdraw Scott&#x27;s instructions. He then conducted his own defence, with Anwar assisting him as amicus curiae.

On 23 December 2010 a jury found Sheridan guilty of perjury and on 26 January 2011 he was sentenced to 3 years in prison.
Initially he was held in Barlinnie prison in Glasgow, but after several weeks he was moved to a semi-open wing in Barlinnie, and on 21 June he was moved to Castle Huntly open prison. Sheridan was released to a Home Detention Curfew on 30 January 2012, having served just over one year of his sentence.

Sheridan and Aamer Anwar subsequently parted company, with Gordon Dangerfield acting as his lawyer.

In 2015 the Scottish Criminal Cases Review Commission declined to refer the case to the High Court.

====Support for Sheridan====
A &quot;Defend Tommy Sheridan&quot; campaign was launched by sympathetic trade unionists and politicians to demand why Sheridan was being investigated. In December 2007, &quot;Sunday Herald&quot; columnist Iain MacWhirter said it was &quot;hard not to conclude that the police&#x27;s diligence has been inspired by Rupert Murdoch&#x27;s News International.&quot; The campaign drew support from the politician George Galloway and leading trade unionist Bob Crow (RMT). At a June 2008 rally organised by the campaign, speakers including FBU secretary Kenny Ross, Paddy Hill, and Gerry Conlon queried the motives for the investigation, questioned the role of the police and Crown Office and verbally attacked the witnesses who had given evidence unhelpful to Sheridan in the original hearing.

===Claims of illegal surveillance===
In March 2007, Lothian and Borders Police investigated claims that Tommy Sheridan had been bugged after a suspicious device was found in his car. The device was described as &quot;not of the kind used by British security services&quot;.

A complaint submitted to Strathclyde Police in July 2011 lead to Operation Rubicon, a major investigation involving 50 officers investigating allegations of phone hacking, breach of data protection and perjury by &quot;News of the World&quot;. In May 2012, Andy Coulson, editor of the &quot;News of the World&quot; from 2003 – 2007 and who gave evidence at Sheridan&#x27;s trial, was detained &quot;on suspicion of committing perjury before the High Court in Glasgow&quot;. On 7 July 2014, following Coulson&#x27;s conviction on phone hacking charges, Coulson himself faced perjury charges over Sheridan&#x27;s trial, and on 23 February 2015, a pre-evidential hearing at the High Court in Edinburgh set a trial date of 21 April. On 3 June 2015, Coulson was formally acquitted after the case against him was dismissed by a judge.

===News Group appeal against defamation award (2016)===
An appeal hearing at the Court of Session in Edinburgh against the 2006 defamation award in light of Sheridan&#x27;s later perjury conviction began on 10 May 2016. New Group Newspapers (now part of News UK) lost their appeal against the award of £200,000 damages to Sheridan on 19 August 2016.

===Publications===
Sheridan&#x27;s rise and extinction are dealt with in two works of political analysis: &quot;Downfall&quot; by his erstwhile colleague Alan McCombes (2011), and &quot;Tommy Sheridan: From Hero to Zero?&quot; by Gregor Gall (2012).

==Later career and other activities==

===Scottish independence referendum===
In the run-up to the 2014 Scottish independence referendum, Sheridan embarked on a pro-independence speaking tour under the banner &quot;Hope Over Fear&quot;. By June 2014, four pro-independence groups Women for Independence, Labour for Independence, Generation Yes, and the Radical Independence Campaign had adopted a policy of refusing Sheridan a platform during the campaign. According to a report in the &quot;Sunday Herald&quot;, pro-independence figures &quot;believe Sheridan is piggy-backing on the independence campaign to gain publicity for an appeal against his conviction&quot;.

Following the defeat of the Yes campaign, Sheridan called for a Scottish National Party (SNP) vote at the 2015 general election for the Westminster parliament, which he said would force a second independence referendum by 2020. He was later a headline speaker at a Hope Over Fear rally in George Square on Sunday 12 October, where he sparked controversy by asking for donations to be sent to his home address. He asked for cheques to be made out to a community group run by a former Solidarity candidate. Ahead of the rally, former MSP Rosie Kane said: &quot;Try to understand that Tommy is a divisive and manipulative character. By all means go along, but don&#x27;t for a minute imagine that this is an open, inclusive and friendly event. This is ego at its most manipulative.&quot;

===Broadcasting===
Tommy Sheridan had a weekly Sunday morning show on Talk 107 for 18 months, but the station did not renew his contract due to cutbacks and changes to programming that saw Mike Graham and others leave Talk107. He hosted a chat show during the Edinburgh fringe in 2007, which received muted reviews. He appeared in the Celebrity version of Big Brother UK. He was the fifth to be evicted (during the double eviction on 21 January 2009). He received mixed reactions from the crowd upon both entry and exit, and admitted during the post-eviction interview that his primary motivation for taking part was that he &quot;needed the money&quot;.

=== Celebrant ===
By 30 June 2018, Sheridan trained to become a humanist celebrant. Sheridan cited the reason as his occasional role presiding over funerals.

<text>Witney is a market town on the River Windrush in West Oxfordshire in the county of Oxfordshire, England. It is west of Oxford.

==History==

The place-name &quot;Witney&quot; is derived from the Old English for &quot;Witta&#x27;s island&quot;. The earliest known record of it is as &quot;Wyttannige&quot; in a Saxon charter of 969. The Domesday Book of 1086 records it as &quot;Witenie&quot;, in the ancient hundred of Bampton.

The Church of England parish church of St Mary the Virgin was originally Norman. The north porch and north aisle were added in this style late in the 12th century, and survived a major rebuilding in about 1243. In this rebuilding the present chancel, transepts, tower and spire were added and the nave was remodelled, all in the Early English style. In the 14th century a number of side chapels and some of the present windows were added in the Decorated style. In the 15th century the south transept was extended and the present west window of the nave were added in the Perpendicular style. The tower has a peal of eight bells. The tower of the church is 69 feet (21 metres) high, topped by a tall and slender spire, which brings the total height of the church to 154 feet (47 metres). 

Holy Trinity Church, Wood Green, was built in 1849 in a Gothic Revival rendition of Early English Gothic. St Mary the Virgin and Holy Trinity are now members of a single team parish. 

The Friends Meeting House in Wood Green was built in the 18th century. Since 1997 Quakers in Witney have met at the Corn Exchange. The Methodist church in the High Street was built in 1850. It is now one of five Methodist churches and chapels in Witney. The Roman Catholic parish of Our Lady and Saint Hugh was founded in 1913. It originally used a chapel in West End built in 1881 but now has its own modern building. The old chapel in West End is now Elim Christian Fellowship. Witney High Street still has several older buildings, which are protected by the Witney and Cogges conservation area. 

Witney Market began in the Middle Ages. Thursday is the traditional market day but there is also a market on Saturday. The buttercross in the market square is so called because people from neighbouring towns would gather there to buy butter and eggs. It was built in about 1600 and its clock was added in 1683. Witney Town Hall, which is arcaded on the ground floor and has an assembly room on the first floor, was completed in 1786. Witney has long been an important crossing over the River Windrush. The architect Thomas Wyatt rebuilt the bridge in Bridge Street in 1822. 

Witney workhouse was on Razor Hill (now Tower Hill). It was designed by the architect George Wilkinson and built in 1835–36. It had four wings radiating from an octagonal central building, similar to the Chipping Norton workhouse, which also was built by Wilkinson. His younger brother William Wilkinson added a separate chapel to Witney Workhouse in 1860. In the First World War the workhouse held prisoners of war. In 1940 the workhouse was converted into Crawford Collets engineering factory under the direction of Leonard Frank Eve. The chapel was made the factory canteen. In 1979 Crawford Collets had the main buildings demolished and replaced with a modern factory, but preserved the entrance gate and former chapel. In 2004 the modern factory was demolished for redevelopment. The gate and chapel have again been preserved and the former chapel converted into offices.

==Governance==
There are three tiers of local government covering Witney, at civil parish (town), district, and county level: Witney Town Council, West Oxfordshire District Council, and Oxfordshire County Council. The town council has its offices at Witney Town Hall and meets at the Corn Exchange. West Oxfordshire District Council is also based in the town, having its main offices on Woodgreen.

===Constituency===
The town forms part of the Witney constituency, represented by Charlie Maynard, a Liberal Democrat, since 2024. Former Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd and former leader of the Conservatives and Prime Minister David Cameron were both MPs for Witney. In the 1997 General Election, Shaun Woodward stood and won the seat as a Conservative, after Hurd retired. Woodward switched to the Labour Party in 1999. In the 2001 General Election Woodward stood as the Labour candidate in the St Helens South constituency, and David Cameron retook Witney for the Conservatives. He became Prime Minister in coalition with the Liberal Democrats in May 2010 and continued after the 2015 election, in which the Conservative Party gained a majority, but retired to the backbenches after the referendum that rejected his government&#x27;s recommendation to remain in the European Union. He stood down as an MP soon afterwards, triggering a by-election held on 20 October 2016, in which Robert Courts was elected for the Conservatives. Courts was re-elected in 2017 and 2019, before being defeated by Maynard in 2024.

===Administrative history===
Witney was an ancient parish in the Bampton hundred of Oxfordshire. The parish was divided into four townships, being Crawley, Curbridge, Hailey, and a Witney township covering the central part of the parish including the town itself. Such townships all became civil parishes in 1866.

The Witney township was made a local government district in 1863. Such local government districts were reconstituted as urban districts under the Local Government Act 1894.

Witney Urban District was abolished in 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972. District-level functions passed to the new West Oxfordshire District Council. A successor parish called Witney was created covering the area of the abolished urban district, with its parish council taking the name Witney Town Council.

==Industry==
Witney has been famous for its woollen blankets since the Middle Ages. The water for the production of these blankets is drawn from the River Windrush, which was believed to be the secret of Witney&#x27;s high-quality blankets. The cloth industry dominated life in Witney where one 17th-century observer noted that &quot;almost 3,000 people from 8 years old to old age worked&quot; in the manufacture of blankets. Mops were also traditionally made by the blanket manufacturers; at one time every ship in the Royal Navy had Witney mops aboard. The Blanket Hall in High Street was built in 1721 for weighing and measuring blankets. At one time there were five blanket factories in the town but with the closure of the largest blanket maker Early&#x27;s, in 2002, the town&#x27;s blanket industry completely ceased production. Early&#x27;s factory, once a vital and important part of the town&#x27;s history, has now been demolished, and is the site of several new housing estates.

One of the oldest mill sites in the town, New Mill, where there has been a mill since the Domesday Book, now houses the head office of Audley Travel.

For many years Witney had its own brewery and maltings: J.W. Clinch and Co, which founded the Eagle Maltings in 1841. In 1961, Courage bought Clinch&#x27;s for its pub estate and closed down the brewery. Paddy Glenny founded the Glenny Brewery at the former Clinch&#x27;s site in 1983, but it was renamed to Wychwood Brewery in 1990. Wychwood brewed real ales, including Hobgoblin, its flagship brand. Refresh UK, a subsidiary of Marston&#x27;s Brewery, took over the brewery in 2002, and Marston&#x27;s bought Refresh UK and Wychwood Brewery outright in 2008. Marston&#x27;s brewing operations, including Wychwood Brewery, were merged into Carlsberg Marston’s Brewing Company in 2020, and Wychwood Brewery was shut down in November 2023, its brands continuing to be brewed elsewhere in the CMBC network.

==Railways==
The Witney Railway opened Witney&#x27;s first station in 1861, linking the town to where the line joined the Oxford, Worcester and Wolverhampton Railway. In 1873 the East Gloucestershire Railway opened from a new station, linking Witney with and . The Great Western Railway operated services on both lines and eventually took them over. In 1962 British Railways closed the EGR completely and withdrew passenger services from the Witney Railway. In 1970 British Railways closed the Witney Railway completely and it was dismantled.

===Reopening proposal===
In 2015 Witney Oxford Transport Group (WOT) proposed the reopening of the railway, with a station at Witney, as an alternative to improvements to the A40 road proposed by Oxfordshire County Council. In 2016 WOT and West Oxfordshire Green Party cited chronic traffic congestion on roads linking Witney with Oxford as a reason to reopen the railway. In 2021 WOT Group submitted a bid to the Department for Transport&#x27;s &#x27;Restoring Your Railway&#x27; Ideas Fund for a grant to develop the case for a new railway in the A40 corridor &#x27;Building a better-connected West Oxfordshire, transforming the wider Oxford economic region&#x27; as part of an Oxford Metro advocated by Railfuture.
==Museums==
Witney has four museums. Cogges Manor Farm Museum, in the 13th-century manor house and farm of Cogges, represents farming and countryside history. Witney and District Museum has many artefacts and documents representing the history of the town. Witney Blanket Hall, built in the 18th century, showcases both the history of the Hall and of Witney&#x27;s blanket industry and has Witney blankets for sale. The Wychwood Brewery has a museum open at weekends.

==Education==
Witney has three county secondary schools: Henry Box School, Wood Green School and Springfield School. In 1660 Henry Box founded Witney Grammar School. In 1968 it became the comprehensive Henry Box School. In 1970 new school buildings were added to the original 17th-century premises beside Church Green. Wood Green School was founded in 1954 and is at the top of Woodstock Road. Springfield School was founded in 1967 and is a special-needs school for pupils with severe learning difficulties. Springfield School senior section is a self-contained unit, with some shared facilities, within the grounds of Wood Green School. Wood Green was substantially expanded from 2000 to 2004; an additional block with 15 teaching rooms was added, together with a purpose-built sixth form centre, school restaurant and new AstroTurf pitch. 2009 saw part of the old Lower School being remodelled to provide new changing and shower facilities for the AstroTurf pitch and its many users from local community sports clubs. 

The King&#x27;s School is independent of Oxfordshire Local Education Authority. It was founded by Oxfordshire Community Churches, an evangelical Christian organisation, in 1984. Cokethorpe School is an independent secondary school, founded in 1957. St. Mary&#x27;s School beside Church Green was established in 1813. It was a Church of England primary school but in 1953 it became a Church of England controlled School for Infant children, and the Junior children transferred to the Batt School premises. Witney now has two Church of England primary schools: The Batt School in Corn Street and The Blake School in Cogges Hill Road. Our Lady of Lourdes Catholic Primary School is a Roman Catholic school founded in 1958.

Witney has five community primary schools: Madley Park Community Primary School, Queen&#x27;s Dyke Primary School, Tower Hill Community Primary School, West Witney Primary School and Witney Community Primary School.
It also has one SEN primary school, Springfield School, which is part of the same school as Springfield secondary School. Springfield school (Primary) shares a building with Madley Brook Primary, but aside from sharing a building, some resources and integration, the schools run independently of one another. The former Witney Technical College is now part of Abingdon and Witney College. A complete rebuilding of its premises began in September 2008.

==Sports==
Witney United Football Club, formerly known as Witney Town and nicknamed the Blanketmen, played in the Hellenic League Premier Division, until they dissolved in the 2012–2013 season. Witney and District League is a local association football league with about 32 clubs in five divisions. Witney Rugby Football Club first XV plays in the RFU South West 1 East. Wychwood Ladies Hockey Club&#x27;s first team play in the Trysport Hockey League Division 1; Witney Hockey Club men&#x27;s first XI plays in the England Hockey Men&#x27;s Conference East division and its ladies&#x27; first XI plays in South Clubs&#x27; Women&#x27;s Hockey League Division 3A. Witney Swifts Cricket Club first XI plays in Oxfordshire Cricket Association Division Three. Witney Wolves Basketball Club plays in the Oxford and Chiltern Basketball League. 

The Toleman Group Motorsport racing team was once based in Witney until it was rebranded Benetton Formula in 1986. The team itself stayed in Witney until 1992 when they moved to Enstone eventually being rebranded in 2002 as Renault F1 when the team was purchased by the French Renault car company. The team competed as Renault F1 until 2011, when it was again rebranded this time under the &quot;Lotus Renault GP&quot; name after forging a partnership with the British Lotus Cars company. The subsequent year the team became Lotus F1 after they dropped the Renault name. The team was later re-purchased by Renault in late 2015 to become the Renault Sport F1 Team for 2016.

==Twinning==

Witney is twinned with:
* Unterhaching, Germany
* Le Touquet, France

==Floods==

In July 2007 Witney saw its worst flooding in more than 50 years. Homes and businesses were evacuated and Bridge Street, a major road into the town and the only road across the Windrush, was closed. About 200 properties in central Witney were flooded, with areas around Bridge Street, Mill Street and West End the worst affected. The new and incomplete housing development Aquarius also suffered substantial flooding. In 2008 further flooding contributed to the death of a 17-year-old boy who drowned in a culvert.
==Climate==
Witney has a maritime climate type typical to the British Isles, with evenly spread rainfall, a narrow temperature range, and comparatively low sunshine totals. The nearest official weather station is Brize Norton, about southwest of Witney. The absolute maximum recorded was 35.4c(95.7f) in August 1990, although in a typical year the warmest day should only reach 29.5c(85.1f) with an average of 14.6 days reporting a maximum temperature of 25.1c(77.2f) or above. The absolute minimum is −20.7c(−5.3f), recorded in January 1982. In a more typical year the annual minimum temperature should be −8.1c(17.4f), although a total of 47.1 nights should report an air frost. Rainfall averages slightly under 644mm per year with more than 1mm of rain falling on just under 115 days of the year.

==Media==
The town receives its television signals from the Oxford TV transmitter. 

In May 2010, WitneyTV was launched as a non-profit online broadcaster with a weekly show that features local news and upcoming events within West Oxfordshire for the benefit of the community. An archive of videos featuring local attractions, clubs, organisations and previous shows is also available. 

A small-scale music festival, Witney Music festival, is held annually on The Leys Recreation Ground. While mostly hosting smaller local artists and tribute bands, it has previously hosted acts such as EMF, The Farm and N-Trance. Witney has a number of recording studios. 

Local radio stations are BBC Radio Oxford on 95.2 FM, Heart South on 102.6 FM, and Greatest Hits Radio South on 106.4 FM. On 30 November 2012 Witney Radio was launched, providing hyper-local news, music and current affairs to the people of Witney and West Oxfordshire. A licence to broadcast on FM radio was granted in April 2016 by the licensing authority Ofcom. On 14 July 2017 Witney Radio began to broadcast on 99.9fm to Witney and West Oxfordshire. The station broadcasts 24 hours a day, 7 days a week with over 30 presenters from the local area. The station also broadcasts online for listeners online via TuneIn.

An Internet radio station, Windrush Radio, was established in 2018. It broadcasts mostly pop and electronic music in the daytime, but has a number of hosts that present specific genres, including a showcase of local artists. Windrush Radio has announced plans to broadcast over DAB radio, and a small-scale radio multiplex license has been submitted to Ofcom. 

The local newspapers are the &quot;Oxford Times&quot;, &quot;Oxfordshire Guardian&quot; and &quot;Witney Gazette&quot;.
