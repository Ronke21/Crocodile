<text>Tver (, ) is a city and the administrative centre of Tver Oblast, Russia. It is situated at the confluence of the Volga and Tvertsa rivers. Tver is located northwest of Moscow. Population: 

The city is situated where three rivers meet, splitting the town into northern and southern parts by the Volga, and divided again into quarters by the Tvertsa River, which splits the left (northern) bank into east and west halves, and the Tmaka River which does the same along the southern bank.

Tver was formerly the capital of a powerful medieval state and a model provincial town in the Russian Empire, with a population of 60,000 by 14 January 1913. The city was known as Kalinin () from 1931 to 1990.

==Etymology==
According to one hypothesis, the name of the city is of Finnic origin, &quot;*Tiheverä&quot;.

==History==

===Medieval origins===
Tver&#x27;s foundation year is officially accepted to be 1135. Originally a minor settlement of Novgorodian traders, it passed to the grand prince of Vladimir in 1209. In 1246, Alexander Nevsky granted it to his younger brother Yaroslav Yaroslavich (), from whom a dynasty of local princes descended. Four of them were killed by the Golden Horde and were proclaimed saints by the Russian Orthodox church.

Formerly a land of woods and bogs, the Principality of Tver was quickly transformed into one of the richest and most populous Russian states. As the area was hardly accessible for Tatar raids, there was a great influx of population from the recently devastated south. By the end of the century, it vied with Moscow for supremacy in Russia. Both Tver and Moscow were recently founded cities, so the outcome of their rivalry was far from certain.

===Grand princedom===
Mikhail Yaroslavich, the prince of Tver, who ascended the throne of Vladimir in 1305, was one of the most revered medieval Russian rulers. His policy of open conflict with the Golden Horde led to his assassination there in 1318. His son, Dmitry Mikhailovich (&quot;the Terrible Eyes&quot;), succeeded him and, concluding an alliance with the mighty Grand Duchy of Lithuania, managed to raise Tver&#x27;s prestige even higher.

Exasperated by Dmitry&#x27;s influence, Ivan Kalita, the prince of Moscow, engineered his murder by the Mongols in 1326. On hearing the news of this crime, the city revolted against the Mongol Horde. The Horde joined its forces with the Muscovites and brutally repressed the rebellion. Many citizens were killed, enslaved or deported. This was the fatal blow to Tver&#x27;s aspirations for supremacy in Russia.

In the second half of the 14th century, Tver was further weakened by dynastic struggles between its princes. Two senior branches of the ruling house, those of Kashin and Kholmsky, asserted their claims to the grand princely throne. The claimers were backed up by Moscow and eventually settled at the Moscow Kremlin court.

During the Great Feudal War in the Grand Duchy of Moscow, Tver again rose to prominence and concluded defensive alliances with Lithuania, Novgorod, Byzantium, and the Golden Horde. Boris of Tver sent one of his men, Afanasy Nikitin, to search for gold and diamonds as far as India. Nikitin&#x27;s travelogue, describing his journey from 1466 to 1472, is one of the first ever firsthand accounts of India by a European. A monument to Nikitin was opened on the Volga embankment in 1955.

===Later history===
On 12 September 1485, the forces of Ivan III seized the city, leading to it to be formally annexed by Moscow. The principality was given as an appanage to Ivan&#x27;s son, Ivan the Young, only to be abolished several decades later. The last scions of the ruling dynasty were executed by Ivan the Terrible during the &quot;oprichnina&quot;. During that turbulent time, Tver was ruled by Simeon Bekbulatovich, a former khan of Kasimov. The only remnant of his ephemeral reign is a graceful tent-like church in the village of Kushalino, northeast of Tver.

===18th century===

The city&#x27;s decline was not irrevocable, however. With the foundation of St. Petersburg, Tver gained importance as a principal station on the highway (and later railway) en route from Moscow. It was much visited by Russian royalty and nobility traveling from the old capital to the new one and back.

In the course of the administrative reform carried out in 1708 by Peter the Great, Tver was included into Ingermanlandia Governorate (since 1710 known as Saint Petersburg Governorate). In 1727 it was transferred to the newly established Novgorod Governorate. In 1775, Tver Viceroyalty was formed from the lands which previously belonged to Moscow and Novgorod Governorates, and the whole area was transferred to Tver Viceroyalty, which in 1796 was transformed to Tver Governorate. Tver was the center of Tverskoy Uyezd.

Following a devastating fire of 1763, the city was rebuilt in a Neoclassical style. Under Catherine the Great, the central part was thoroughly reconstructed. Crumbling medieval buildings were razed and replaced with imposing Neoclassical buildings. The most important of these are the Travel Palace of the Empress (designed by the celebrated Matvei Kazakov), and the Ascension church (designed by Nikolay Lvov and consecrated in 1813).

===19th century===
In 1809, a committee was established to improve the city. An architect designed the Cathedral of Christ and houses on the waterfront and in the city center (30 buildings), and rebuilt the summer palace. Catherine Pavlovna (a sister of Alexander I) was married to the governor of Tver, and the palace was a social center and literary salon for Tver and visitors from Moscow and St. Petersburg. Writer and historian Nikolay Karamzin read excerpts from his &quot;History of the Russian State&quot; to Alexander. Napoleon was near Tver in 1812.

===20th century===

On 12 July 1929, the governorates and uyezds were abolished. Tverskoy District, with the administrative centre in Tver, was established within Tver Okrug of Moscow Oblast. On 23 July 1930, the okrugs were abolished, and the districts were directly subordinated to the oblast.

On 20 November 1931, the city was renamed &quot;Kalinin&quot; after the nominal head of state (1919–1946) and affiliate of Joseph Stalin, Mikhail Kalinin, who had been born nearby. Simultaneously, Tverskoy District was renamed Kalininsky District. On 29 January 1935, Kalinin Oblast was established, and Kalininsky District was transferred to Kalinin Oblast.

The last vestige of the pre-Petrine epoch, the Saviour Cathedral, was blown up in 1936. In 1940, the NKVD executed more than 6,200 Polish policemen and prisoners of war from Ostashkov camp.

The Wehrmacht entered Kalinin on Monday 13 October 1941 according to MI9 photographs, occupied Kalinin for two months from Monday 13 October 1941/Tuesday, 14 October to 19 December 1941, leaving the city in ashes. Kalinin was the first major city in Europe to be retaken from the Wehrmacht.

During the Cold War, Kalinin was home to the Kryuchkovo air base, which is no longer in service. The city&#x27;s historic name of Tver was restored on 17 July 1990.

Apart from the suburban White Trinity Church (1564) (, the Temple of the Lifegiving Trinity), there are no ancient monuments left in Tver. The central part is graced with Catharinian and Soviet edifices, bridges, and embankments. Tver&#x27;s most notable industries are rolling stock manufacturer Tver Carriage Works, opened in 1898, an excavator factory, and a glass factory. Tver is home to Migalovo, which is one of Russia&#x27;s biggest military airlift facilities.

==Administrative and municipal status==
Tver is the administrative centre of the oblast and, within the framework of administrative divisions, it also serves as the administrative centre of Kalininsky District, even though it is not a part of it. As an administrative division, it is incorporated separately as Tver Okrug, an administrative unit with a status equal to that of the districts. As a municipal division, Tver Okrug is incorporated as Tver Urban Okrug.

== City division ==

The city was divided into districts in 1936. The districts were updated several times in 1965 and 1976. The final city division, currently in use, divides the city into four districts:
# Zavolzhsky City District – part of the city, on the left bank of Volga River
# Moskovsky City District – east of the city, on the right bank of Volga River oriented towards Moscow
# Proletarsky City District – west part of the city, named after the Proletarka plant.
# Tsentralny City District – central part of the city including historical downtown and neighbourhood in a near proximity.

==Politics==
The Tver City Duma, the local parliament, is composed of 33 deputies. The executive branch is the Administration of Tver. The structure consists of the mayor (since 2017 – Alexey Ogonkov), his deputies, industry bodies (departments of architecture and construction, housing and communal services, health and social policy, property management and land resources; economy, investment and industrial policy, a number of departments and divisions), as well as the administration of the four districts: Zavolzhsky, Moskovsky, Proletarsky and Tsentralny. A considerable part of the government buildings of the city of Tver and the Tver Oblast lay along Sovetskaya Street: the building on the square of St. Michael (Sovetskaya, 44) is the residence of the Governor of the Oblast, and a former Regional Party Committee (Sovetskaya, 33) is The Legislative Assembly of Tver Oblast.

Tver City Duma as a representative body of the city existed from 1785 to 1918, was reconstituted after the dissolution of councils and adoption of the new Constitution of Russia in 1993. On 20 March 1994, elections were held in the House of Representatives, which on 26 May was renamed Tver City Duma. On 7 June deputies were able to hold the first meeting, and on 14 June Valery Matitsyn was elected a speaker (later this post was held by Valery Pavlov, Victor Pochtaryov, Dmitry Bazhenov, Igor Serdyuk, Andrei Borisenko, Lyudmila Polosina, Vladimir Babichev). In 1996, deputies adopted the founding document of the city – the Charter of the city of Tver, putting in it the principle of rotation in the Duma elections. Second election based on it was held on 27 October 1996 . In the future years elections held every two years in the &quot;even&quot; and &quot;odd&quot; electoral districts. In 2007, 12 former deputies (including the former chairman of the Duma Victor Pochtaryov) were convicted of taking bribes for decisions in favor of Rosvodokanal and other utilities. In October 2008, the elections of some deputies have already passed on party lists, and in March 2009 the entire City Duma has been transferred to this system, while discontinued the practice of rotation of deputies. In the elections of 2009, the best result (49 % of the vote) was shown by local communists.

On 27 October 1996 simultaneously with elections to the City Duma passed the first general elections of the head of the city, won by Alexander Belousov, who led the municipal administration since 1991 and received more than 50 % of the vote. On 30 October 2000 he was reelected to a second term, and on 9 April 2003 he died of a heart attack. On 26 July 2001 in early Mayoral elections opposition candidate Oleg Lebedev won. On 2 December 2007 when he was supported by the pro-government party United Russia, he was re-elected for a second term, receiving more than 70 % of the vote. On 11 April 2008 he was suspended by the Tsentralny District Court in connection with a criminal case opened in 2005, closed in 2006 and renewed by the Prosecutor General of Russia in March 2008 (Lebedev was accused of hindering the work of the investigation against his deputy Oleg Kudryashov). On 2 May Oleg Lebedev was reinstated, and on 3 June, again dismissed, and on 25 June he was taken into custody and transported to Kashin, where he was convicted by visiting college of Tver Regional Court jury to eighteen years’ imprisonment, which automatically meant the termination of his powers. In 2009, he was released on parole, but the position was not restored.

In late 2008, Tver City Duma adopted amendments to the charter of the city, under which direct elections of the Mayor were abolished and a new position of head of the city administration introduced. This amendment to the charter of the city was met with a mixed public reaction and local attempts to bring the issue by the Communists to citywide referendum were not supported by City Duma. In March 2009, City Duma elected Vladimir Babichev as the new mayor (now ceremonial post), and in May the same year, Vasily Toloko was appointed as the head of the city administration. He had previously been the first deputy governor of the Tver Oblast. The mayor and the head of the local administration were elected with a thin majority of seventeen votes (United Russia, Fair Russia and the Liberal Democratic Party) against sixteen (Communist Party). On 27 December 2011 by a majority vote (22 for, six against) City Council voted in favor of early termination of Vasily Toloko. On 29 March 2012 the Tver City Duma (25 for, 4 against) appointed Valery Pavlov to the post of Head of the Administration. He had previously held the post of the first deputy head of Cuty Administration.

On 2 November 2012 Alexander Korzin was appointed as mayor of the city. In 2014, he left his post, and on May 28, 2014, by the decision of the Tver City Duma, Yury Timofeev was appointed to this post, previously working for 10 years as the head of the Zapadnodvinsky District. On 22 September 2016, immediately after Igor Rudenya assumed the post of governor, Timofeev resigned and Alexey Ogonkov, who claimed this position in 2014, became acting Mayor.

In August 2017, the Tver City Duma adopted amendments to the Charter of the city, according to which the Mayor also heads the administration. Thus, the &quot;two-headed management&quot; system introduced in 2008 was abolished. The amendments entered into force on November 2, 2017, after Alexander Korzin&#x27;s term as Mayor has expired. Thus, from 2 November 2017 Alexey Ogonykov became the Mayor.

The Oktyabrskaya Railway linking Moscow and St. Petersburg crosses the city. Since 1850, there has been a railway connection between Tver and Moscow. The primary Tver Railway Station has a locomotive and car shed, allowing it to service both passenger and cargo trains. In addition to the Tver Central Station, there are four minor stations within the city perimeter: Lazurnaya, Proletarskaya, Doroshikha and PPGT. The suburban railway service links Tver to Moscow, Bologoye, Torzhok. Most trains passing from Moscow to the north-west regions make a short stop in Tver. The high-speed train Sapsan, which connects Moscow with St. Petersburg, also makes stops in Tver, as well as the Tolstoy train connecting Moscow to Helsinki, Finland.

The newly designed high-speed railway line between Moscow and St Petersburg is expected to have a &quot;New Tver&#x27;&quot; station several kilometres southward of the city border.

Tver is notable for a high number of private cars: there are 288 cars per thousand residents, which is well above average among the other regions of Russia.

===Public transit===
There is a local bus station that interconnects Tver with minor towns of Tver Oblast, neighbouring oblasts, and Moscow.

Local public transit consists of trolleybuses, buses, and &quot;marshrutkas&quot; (routed taxis). The latter two have taken priority during recent years. 

In the past, trams carried passengers in Tver, however, in November 2018, the tram traffic in Tver was completely stopped. On August 7, 2019, all car drivers, as well as track fitters and support staff of the trams, left by &quot;mutual agreement&quot;. At the same time, the dismantling of the contact network and the tracks along the last existing route began. The city administration said that it was necessary to completely repair the roadbed.

In recent years, there has been a tendency to reduce the route network of trolley buses. During the first quarter of 2020, local authorities plan to introduce a new transport model, which implies the elimination of trolleybus traffic and the duplication of its routes with buses. From April 14, 2020, the last of the existing trolleybus routes (No. 2) was replaced by a bus route 42 on which diesel buses now operate.

<text>The Ford Telstar is an automobile that was sold by Ford in Asia, Australasia and Africa, comparable in size to the European Ford Sierra and the North American Ford Tempo. It was progressively replaced by the Ford Mondeo. The car was named after the Telstar satellite.

Like the smaller Ford Laser, the Telstar was based on a model produced by Mazda in Japan. It shared its platform with the Mazda Capella/626, the differences being confined to some styling, engine sizes, and specification. The first model was launched in Japan in 1982. The Australian launch occurred in 1983, replacing the Ford Cortina. Unlike the Cortina, the Telstar was usually only available as a sedan or five-door hatchback (known as the TX5). However, after 1988, a Telstar version of the 626 wagon was sold in Japan and New Zealand.

In Taiwan, it was assembled using complete knock-down kits from 1983 via the local joint venture Ford Lio Ho in left-hand drive. It remained in production in Malaysia until early 2001. It was also sold in Hong Kong, Singapore, Indonesia, Cyprus and the Philippines.

== First generation (AR, AS; 1982–1987) ==
Ford introduced the AR series Telstar sedan and hatchback to the Japanese market in October 1982—a rebadged and lightly restyled version of the then new front-wheel drive, Mazda 626 (GC)—both manufactured at Mazda&#x27;s Hōfu production line. The updated styling relative to the Mazda was performed by Ford Australia. This restyling effort made up part of the Ford Australia spent on the Telstar, including setting up local production facilities. A drag coefficient of was achieved for the AR hatchback.

The Telstar filled the gap in Ford Australia&#x27;s product line-up left by the TF Cortina in 1981. The Ford Meteor sedan had been positioned as a stop-gap replacement, despite occupying the segment below.

The AR Telstar was introduced to Australia in May 1983, with GL, S and Ghia sedans, plus the TX5 and TX5 Ghia hatchbacks. For the local market, assembly occurred at Ford&#x27;s Broadmeadows plant using complete knock-down (CKD) kits.&lt;ref name=&quot;Unique Cars and Parts AT/AV&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; To free up plant capacity for the Ford Falcon (XF), production of the Telstar TX5 switched to Japan, with dealerships receiving the first shipments in February 1985.

At launch, features unique to the AR series TX5 Ghia included an electric drivers&#x27; seat with adjustable side bolsters and electronic dashboard with LED tachometer and digital speedometer. Fluorescent vertical bars record the fuel level and engine temperature. Air conditioning was optional on all models, as was power steering on all except GL, S, and TX5 manuals. The S model added a height adjustable driver&#x27;s seat and featured different upholstery over the GL.

The AR series offered four- and five-speed manuals and three-speed automatic transmissions. The four-speed was standard on Telstar GL, with the five-speed standard on the remaining models, and the automatic optional on all models. There was only one engine on offer—a and , 2.0-litre with carburettor.&lt;ref name=&quot;Used car review Ford Telstar/Mazda 626 1983–1987&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; After initially importing engines, Ford commenced manufacture at its Norlane, Geelong facility in late 1983, taking the place of the former V8 powerplant at the facility.

Local changes for the Australian model included front seat modifications which improved headroom, and suspension tuning. The suspension was fully independent, with a coil/strut system fitted, incorporating anti-dive and negative offset geometry to aid stability in slippery conditions and under heavy braking. Anti-roll bars were fitted front and rear. The TX5 suspension also featured electronic variable shock absorbers—adjustable via a dashboard buttons for normal, automatic or sport. Along with the 626, the Telstar was &quot;Wheels&quot; magazine&#x27;s Car of the Year for 1983.


A facelifted model (the AS) arrived to Australia in September 1985. This comprised minor restyling to the front and rear, a comprehensively updated interior, improved suspension, revised trim and more features. Front turn signals were relocated from the headlamps to the bumper, with side repeaters added to the wrap-around sections of the front bumper. Taillamps for the sedan were restyled, and all models received new hubcaps or alloys. GL was now fitted with a left-hand side wing mirror, with Ghia models gaining electric mirror operation. The AS update also benefited from tinted side and rear glass for the GL sedan. Analogue instrumentation was now standard across the range, dispensing with the digital setup used previously by the TX5 Ghia. The new centre console housed audio equipment, a storage tray, gear lever and, on Ghia models, power window switches. Telstar GL and the base TX5 offered a more basic hand brake console integrating an ashtray for rear passengers. Ghia models featured an armrest console with acrylic &quot;smoked glass&quot; lid to provide extra storage. Compared to the AR series, console storage space for Ghia models was increased, as was glove compartment capacity across all trims. The seats were also revised—the work of Ford Australia—and a modification that only applied to the Ford-badged cars. Other interior changes included those made to the stalk-mounted switchgear, and a new digital clock in the centre of the dashboard benefitting from a glare-prevention hood. The clock was previously located awkwardly ahead of the gear lever.

Suspension changes for the AS series included uprated rear springs and reduction in rear anti-roll bar diameter. Improvements were also made to the TX5 Ghia&#x27;s adjustable suspension. In terms of braking, Ghias were now fitted with four-wheel disc brakes; Telstar GL and TX5 retained front discs and rear drums. Ventilated front disc brakes and semi-metallic pads were now fitted across the range to provide, in conjunction with the brake cooling ducts in the front valance, increased brake cooling capacity and reduced brake fade and squeal.

In 1985, Ford sold 20,982 Telstars in Australia—the eighth best selling nameplate.

In March 1986, the TX5 Turbo flagship launched in Australia, with an and engine tied to a five-speed manual. Standard equipment over the Ghia trim included two-tone paint, alloy wheels, rear spoiler, three-spoke steering wheel, air conditioning, power steering, and Pioneer sound system. Also in 1986, all Telstars were updated to run on unleaded petrol.

In New Zealand, the Telstar, like the Laser, was assembled locally from 1983 (replacing the highly successful Cortina range) at Ford&#x27;s original Seaview plant near Lower Hutt and later at the Ford/Mazda joint venture plant in Wiri, Auckland, called Vehicle Assemblers of New Zealand (VANZ). The mechanically identical European specification Mazda 626 and Mazda 323 were initially assembled separately by Motor Holdings in Otahuhu but later joined the Telstar and Laser at VANZ. It was launched in July, 1983. The first generation Telstar was available in New Zealand in both sedan and TX5 hatchback forms, using Mazda 1.6- and 2.0-litre four cylinder engines. However, the absence of a station wagon version, in a market where there was strong demand for such vehicles, prompted Ford New Zealand to introduce a locally assembled Sierra wagon in 1984.
== Second generation (AT, AV; 1987–1992) ==
The original generation Telstar was replaced in Australia in October 1987 with a refreshed version, called the AT series. Ford rebadged and lightly restyled the Mazda 626 (GD) for the AT series sedan and TX5 hatchback. A station wagon was also available, built on the GD-based GV platform, which was unique to Japan and New Zealand. The facelifted AV model was released in Australia in January 1990, distinguished by a new grille, trim and wheels.

In the Australian market, the range was now imported from Japan to make room for the Capri convertible on the Broadmeadows line. The switch from local assembly was made possible by the accumulation of import credits obtained from the export of the Capri to the United States. The base GL sedan and hatchback carried over the AS&#x27;s 2.0-litre inline-four engine producing , while Ghia models featured a 2.2-litre 12-valve inline-four with . The flagship TX5 Turbo used a variation of the 2.2-litre engine, rated at on premium fuel and gaining anti-lock brakes. Power output for the Turbo dropped to when running on regular fuel.
Telstar sedans in Australia were discontinued in October 1989 due to the expense of importing them from Japan, solved by switching to the locally assembled Ford Corsair—a rebadged and facelifted Nissan Pintara (U12). Under the Button plan, Ford and Nissan were to share models. 

The two were instead sold side-by-side in the Ford range until the third generation Telstar was introduced in 1992. Between 1990 and 1992, the Telstar (AV series) was only available as the Japanese-built, high-performance TX5 hatchback in Australia. However, the Corsair proved less popular than the Telstar had been, losing sales dramatically during 1991. 

In New Zealand, by contrast, the range remained unchanged, although it was later complemented by the Sierra, this time imported from Belgium in small volumes as premium models, rather than assembled locally. Neither the Corsair nor the Pintara were sold in New Zealand, but a similar model, the Nissan Bluebird, was offered in the local market.

In Malaysia, the Telstar continued to be assembled by Amim Holdings after a brief hiatus, reaching the market in March 1988. It was offered as a 1.8-litre five-speed manual Ghia sedan or 2.0-litre automatic TX5 hatchback. In early 1990, a facelifted model was shown, with a new, smaller grille, modified taillights and a new 12-valve engine replacing the previous 2.0-litre. The 1.8-litre continued with while the new 2.0-litre engine offered . There were three models on offer; the 1.8 sedan, 2.0 Ghia sedan, and 2.0 Ghia TX5.

In Indonesia, this generation was marketed as the &quot;Ford Telstar Grand&quot; (four-door sedan) and &quot;Ford Telstar Thunder&quot; (five-door liftback). The only engine was the carburetted, 12-valve, 2.0-liter four as per Malaysia; claimed power was at 5,300 rpm while maximum torque was at 3,300 rpm. A five-speed manual transmission was standard, with a four-speed automatic an available option on the Telstar Grand.

In Japan, this generation was sold from May 1987 until October 1991; the station wagon, however, was introduced in September 1990 (two years after its Capella Cargo sister) and continued to be built until October 1997. In Japan, the Telstar received 1.8- or 2.0-litre petrol fours with power from or a 2-litre Comprex diesel with . In June 1989, a twin-cam 1.8-liter engine with was added, while the 2-liter DOHC engine received a 10-horsepower increase and now required higher-octane gasoline. After the sedans and liftbacks had been discontinued, the remaining station wagon lineup wa continuously updated and adjusted, with a 4WD diesel model added in August 1992 and the offroad-inspired Telstar Canoa Wagon arriving in November 1994 to capitalize on Japan&#x27;s so-called &quot;RV Boom&quot;. The Canoa corresponds to the similar Capella Wagon FX.
== Third generation (AX, AY; 1991–1997) ==
Following the introduction of the GE platform Mazda 626, Ford introduced its Telstar version to Japan in October 1991 at Japanese Ford dealerships called &quot;Autorama&quot;. In Japan the GE-based Telstar was available in a range of sedan models with all four cylinder and V6 engine options and a TX5 hatchback range featuring only the V6 engines. The GV platform Telstar wagon also continued alongside the sedan and hatchback. All variants were available in a large variety of trim levels, with many offering high levels of equipment in comparison to other markets. All were replaced by the GF platform based Telstar in 1997.

The AX series came to Australia in December 1992. Then followed the decision by Nissan to end Nissan Pintara manufacturing in Australia during 1992, whereby Ford&#x27;s rebadged version, the Corsair was also discontinued. This left the Telstar as the Ford&#x27;s sole offering in the mid-size segment of the market.

This model was voted as &quot;Wheels&quot; magazine&#x27;s Car of the Year for 1992. Trim levels were GLX, Ghia and Ghia 4WS. Four-wheel steering was offered in the top-of-the-range Telstar TX5. A facelifted AY model appeared in August 1994. The Telstar was replaced in Australia by the Mondeo in 1995.

New Zealand, like Australia received the AX Telstar in 1992, followed by the AY in late 1994. NZ versions were offered in GLi, GLEi, Ghia sedan and TX5i, TX5 XRi hatchback forms, using 1.8 &amp; 2.0-litre four cylinder and 2.5-litre V6 engines. The wagon version of the previous generation Telstar continued in local production along with the previous generation sedan offered as an entry-level model called the Telstar Orion. Both models retained the earlier 2.0-litre SOHC four-cylinder engine. All Telstar models were assembled alongside a similar lineup of Mazda 626 models (except for the Ford-only Orion) at the Ford-Mazda joint venture Vehicle Assemblers of New Zealand (VANZ) plant in Wiri, South Auckland.

When the first Mondeos were offered abroad, Ford New Zealand offered the four cylinder AY sedan in two trim levels: Telstar Contour and Telstar Mystique (named after the respective US Ford and Mercury versions of the Mondeo) as a replacement for the GLi and GLEi respectively. Also in the AY lineup was a Telstar Eurosport V6 sedan (replacing the V6 GLEi) and upgraded TX5i and TX5 XRi hatchback models.

A limited edition V6 sedan with tuned suspension and unique trim, known as the Telstar Radisich after the New Zealand racing driver Paul Radisich was also sold locally. This was released in two runs of 100 cars each, firstly in 1994 (based on the AX GLEi) and again in 1996 (based closely on the AY Eurosport). Notable features of the model are 16-inch ROH Astron alloy wheels, the &#x27;aero&#x27; body kit (similar to the TX5 XRi) and Radisich insignia decals.

Local assembly of the Telstar ceased along with all other Ford and Mazda models in 1997 when the VANZ Auckland plant closed. It was replaced in all forms by the Belgian-built Mondeo range. The Telstar was always a popular seller for Ford New Zealand.

In South Africa, the Telstar replaced the Sierra in 1993, being assembled by Samcor alongside the Mazda 626. As in New Zealand, a Telstar Contour and Telstar Mystique were offered. In 1998, the Telstar was replaced by the Mondeo, which was later fully imported.

In Malaysia, the third generation Telstar arrived in August 1992. It was initially available as a four-cylinder 2.0-litre sedan or as a better-equipped hatchback (designated &quot;TX-5&quot;) which came with a V6 engine, also of 2.0-litre displacement. The four-cylinder model was paired with a five-speed manual transmission, while the V6 received a four-speed automatic. Later, the V6 was also installed in the sedan and became available coupled to a manual transmission in the TX-5. In 1997, the Telstar in Malaysia received a new grille insert and the automatic transmission eventually found its way into the 4-cylinder 16-valve 2.0-litre engine variant. Production ended in early 2001. However, unsold stock lasted until 2003.

In Indonesia, this generation was offered with the 2-liter inline-four or the 2.5-liter V6, and was sold as the Telstar Brilliant (four-door sedan) and the Telstar Challenge (five-door liftback).
== Fourth generation (1994–1997) == 

Between 1994 and 1997, a model known as the Telstar II was produced alongside the Mazda Capella on the CG platform. Both the Telstar II and this generation of the Capella were only sold on the Japanese market.

== Fifth generation (1997–1999) ==

The last Telstar, based on the GF platform, was released in 1997 but was again only available in Japan as Ford was now marketing the Mondeo in the Asian-Pacific region. It was only available as a sedan and wagon, with no liftback version available.

The Telstar was dropped by Ford of Japan in 1999 as the company sought to differentiate itself from Mazda by concentrating on European and American Ford models. Telstars were briefly available with Mazda&#x27;s four-wheel steering.

<text>Kolomna (, ) is a historic city in Moscow Oblast, Russia, situated at the confluence of the Moskva and Oka Rivers, (by rail) southeast of Moscow. Population: 

==History==
Mentioned for the first time in 1177, Kolomna was founded in 1140–1160 according to the latest archaeological surveys. Kolomna&#x27;s name may originate from the Old Russian term for &quot;on the bend (in the river)&quot;, especially as the old city is located on a sharp bend in the Moscow River. In January 1238, Kolomna was destroyed by a Mongol invasion. In 1301, Kolomna became the first town to be incorporated into the Moscow Principality.

Like some other ancient Russian cities, it has a kremlin, which is a citadel similar to the more famous one in Moscow and also built of red brick. The stone Kolomna Kremlin was built from 1525–1531 under the Russian Tsar Vasily III. The Kolomna citadel was a part of the Great Abatis Border and, although much of the surrounding wall was removed in the eighteenth century and materials used to construct other public buildings, the remaining stretch of wall, several towers, and some interior buildings have been preserved and held in good shape with a museum located inside. In front of the façade stands a statue of Dmitry Donskoy, celebrating the gathering of his troops in Kolomna prior to the Battle of Kulikovo in 1380.

The civic arms of Kolomna were granted by Empress Catherine II, who was influenced by the similar-sounding name of the famous Colonna family of Rome. Hence, the similar appearance of the arms, despite there being no connection between the Roman family and the city of Kolomna.

Due to sensitive military production of missile components, Kolomna was a closed city until 1994. It is not listed as a city of the Golden Ring, despite its kremlin and the large number of well-preserved churches and monasteries.

==Administrative and municipal status==
Within the framework of administrative divisions, Kolomna serves as the administrative center of Kolomensky District, even though it is not a part of it. As an administrative division, it is incorporated separately as Kolomna City Under Oblast Jurisdiction—an administrative unit with the status equal to that of the districts. As a municipal division, Kolomna City Under Oblast Jurisdiction is incorporated as Kolomna Urban Okrug.

==Transportation==

Kolomna is located on the Ryazan line of the Moscow railroad, from Moscow. In Kolomna, there are five railway stations (Kolomna, Shchurovo, Bochmanovo, 6 km, and Sychevo) and one terminal (Golutvin).

Two bus terminals are located in the city. Public transport in the city is represented by tram and city bus lines.

Kolomna is situated on three rivers, and has passenger and transport berths, with the most well-known being Bochmanovo berth.

==Sports==

The Kolomna Speed Skating Center is an indoor ice speed skating oval used for Russian and international championships. It hosted the 2008 European Speed Skating Championships and the 2016 World Single Distance Speed Skating Championships. The Kolomna Speed Skating Center is considered one of the most modern ice speed skating ovals in the world.

==Geography==
The city is situated at the confluence of the Moskva and Oka Rivers, 114 kilometers (71 mi) (by rail) southeast of Moscow.

<doc id="372329" wikidata="Q681877" url="?curid=372329" title="David Pelletier">
<text>David Jacques Pelletier (born November 22, 1974) is a Canadian pairs figure skater. With his former wife Jamie Salé, he was the co-gold medal winner at the 2002 Olympic Winter Games. They shared the gold medal with the Russian pair Elena Berezhnaya and Anton Sikharulidze after the 2002 Olympic Winter Games figure skating scandal.

==Early life and career==
Pelletier was born in Sayabec, Quebec, and grew up near the hockey rink. His mother said if he wanted to play hockey, he also had to take figure-skating lessons. He achieved early success as a pair skater with Julie Laporte. They won both the novice and junior titles at the Canadian Figure Skating Championships and placed 7th at the World Junior Figure Skating Championships in 1992. Despite these accomplishments, Pelletier felt his career needed a &quot;shake up&quot; and paired up with Allison Gaylor. They trained in part with Isabelle Brasseur and Lloyd Eisler, and had their biggest success in 1995 when they captured the 1995 Canadian silver medal and represented Canada at the World Figure Skating Championships in Birmingham, England, where they placed 15th. That same year, as a single skater, Pelletier placed second in the short program of the men&#x27;s event at the Canadian championships. He struggled in the long program, falling to fourth overall.

After failing to reach the podium the next two years, Pelletier and Gaylor split and Pelletier paired up with young singles skater Caroline Roy. Just before the 1998 Canadian championships, Pelletier&#x27;s former partner Julie Laporte was killed in a car accident. Pelletier and Roy had a strong skate, but placed 6th and split soon after the event.

==Partnership with Jamie Salé==

Pelletier asked coach Richard Gauthier to help him find another partner, and he suggested Salé. They traveled to Edmonton in February 1998 to try out with Salé again. &quot;The first time we grabbed hands, it was just great,&quot; said Pelletier, and by the next month Salé had moved to Montreal to skate with him.

The Canadian Figure Skating Association invited the pair to compete at Skate Canada, where they immediately made a statement by placing second in the short program, ahead of reigning Canadian Champions Kristy Sargeant and Kris Wirtz, and third in the long program to win the bronze medal. Because of their success, they were invited to the NHK Trophy in Japan and brought home another bronze medal.

Their fall successes made them favorites for the Canadian title, but they struggled technically and finished second. The silver medal earned them a spot on the Four Continents and World teams, but Pelletier&#x27;s back pain forced the pair to withdraw from both competitions. They would ultimately spend two months off the ice recuperating.

===1999–2000===
In the summer of 1999, Gauthier enlisted the help of Lori Nichol, a Canadian choreographer, to choreograph Salé &amp; Pelletier&#x27;s programs for the upcoming season. Nichol created a tango piece for their short program, and, after a suggestion from coach Marijane Stong, set their long program to music from the movie &quot;Love Story&quot;. The programs got off to a good start. At the 1999 Skate America, Salé &amp; Pelletier won both the short and the long programs, defeating the two-time and reigning world champions, Yelena Berezhnaya and Anton Sikharulidze. At the Nations Cup, their second Grand Prix event, they finished second. However, at the Grand Prix Final, they made several errors in both programs and finished fifth.

They competed at the 2000 Canadian Figure Skating Championships in Calgary, Salé&#x27;s hometown. The two skated a strong short program and a nearly flawless long program, earning five 6.0 marks in presentation—the first for a pair at the championships. Sale &amp; Pelletier captured another 6.0 and the gold medal at the Four Continents Championships in Osaka, Japan. In the 2000 World Figure Skating Championships in Nice, France, they were third after the short program due to an error in a spin. They dropped in the long program, finishing fourth overall.

===2000–2001===
Salé and Pelletier returned to Lori Nichol for their 2000–01 programs. She choreographed a jazzy short to &quot;Come Rain or Come Shine&quot; and a dramatic, mature long to Wagner&#x27;s opera &quot;Tristan und Isolde.&quot; They returned to Skate America and Skate Canada that fall, winning both over Shen/Zhao and Berezhnaya/Sikharulidze, respectively. Berezhnaia/Sikharulidze then narrowly defeated them at Trophée Lalique.

The pair was again a great hit at the 2001 Canadian Championships in Winnipeg, but did not earn the string of 6.0s that &quot;Love Story&quot; had brought them the previous year. They went on to win again at Four Continents in Salt Lake City, the site for the 2002 Olympics, and dusted off &quot;Love Story&quot; to win the Grand Prix Final – despite Sale missing the side-by-side triple toe loop in all three phases of the competition.

The 2001 World Championships were held in Vancouver, and Salé and Pelletier entered as heavy favorites. Trouble on the side-by-side jumps landed them in third place in the short program, but the team was placed first in the long program despite Salé singling a side-by-side double axel. They were the first Canadian pair to win Worlds since Isabelle Brasseur and Lloyd Eisler in 1993, and the first pair to win at a Worlds held in Canada since Barbara Underhill and Paul Martini in 1984. They would later win the Lou Marsh Trophy as outstanding Canadian athlete in 2001.

===2002 Winter Olympics===
Salé and Pelletier again demonstrated early success in the 2001–02 season, winning both Skate America and Skate Canada with their new long program to &quot;Adagio Sostenuto&quot; by Rachmaninoff, nicknamed &quot;Orchid&quot; for its flower theme. Perhaps more importantly, they demonstrated technical consistency in both competitions.

The Grand Prix Final, held in Kitchener, Ontario, was important because it was the only chance to test their programs against the top contenders before the Olympics. Despite a rough performance of &quot;Orchid&quot; in the first long program, Salé and Pelletier once again won skating a flawless performance of &quot;Love Story&quot; for their second long program. They headed into the 2002 Canadian Championships in Hamilton, Ontario, with confidence, having defeated Berezhnaya and Sikharulidze, their biggest rivals. They were able to win the title despite a badly flawed long program.

The pressure for the Olympics was intense. Despite several silvers and bronzes, Canada had only won two gold medals in figure skating, in 1948 and 1960. All eyes were on Salé and Pelletier to break the streak and win, overcoming the Russian pairs dominance that had lasted for 40 years. They skated their short program well, only to trip and fall on their closing pose. Because the fall was not on an element, it did not receive a deduction. They placed second behind Berezhnaya and Sikharulidze. In the long program, Salé and Pelletier had no obvious mistakes. Berezhnaya and Sikharludize, meanwhile, skated a more difficult program in which Sikharulidze had a minor step out on a jump element before quickly regaining unison with his partner. The minor error from the Russians had many convinced that the Canadians had won the gold but when the judges&#x27; scores came up, Salé and Pelletier were placed second in the long program. Four judges placed Salé and Pelletier first, while five had Berezhnaya and Sikharulidze as the winners, with the Canadians receiving higher technical scores and the Russians higher presentation scores. This result spurred an outcry from the North American media who emphasized Sikharulidze&#x27;s stepout, although there was no media criticism a year earlier when Salé and Pelletier were awarded gold at the 2001 World Championships, while ignoring that Salé and Pelletier had fallen in the short program and not received a deduction. The commentators received criticism for failing to mention Berezhnaya and Sikharulidze&#x27;s strengths, with some observers stating that the Russians had performed a more challenging program with greater speed, more interweaving moves and transitions, and less distance between the partners. After the competition, the French judge Marie-Reine Le Gougne admitted she had been pressured by the head of her federation, Didier Gailhaguet, into awarding the long program to the Russians and a judging controversy quickly blew up. The scandal ultimately resulted in the suspension of several judges and officials, and Le Gougne&#x27;s vote was discarded. Salé and Pelletier were awarded gold medals in a special ceremony later in the week.

The controversy resulted in several changes to the judging system after Salt Lake City. First anonymous judging was incorporated to &quot;relieve outside pressure&quot; from judges by separating their names from their marks so pressurers could not assert whether the judge had acted as they wished or not. The ISU Judging System, based on a Code of Points rather than a 6.0 scale, was adopted for use in the Grand Prix season of 2003–04, and for all 2004–05 competitions and thereafter.

===Post-Olympic career===
After the Olympics, having settled in Edmonton, Alberta, the pair turned professional and toured North America with Stars on Ice, a popular figure skating show.

Salé and Pelletier were inducted into the Skate Canada Hall of Fame in 2008. They were inducted into the Canadian Olympic Hall of Fame on March 26, 2009.

==&quot;Battle of the Blades&quot;==
On August 22, 2011, CBC television announced that Pelletier would compete in Season 3 of their figure skating competition TV program &quot;Battle of the Blades&quot;. He was paired with hockey player Tessa Bonhomme, and on November 14, 2011, the pair won the $100,000 first prize for the charities of their choice, Ronald McDonald House Southern Alberta (Pelletier) and Canadian Breast Cancer Foundation ‘CIBC Run for the Cure’ – Sudbury Run Site (Bonhomme).

==Hockey coach==
After retiring from competition, Pelletier became an ice hockey power skating coach, working with professional and high level amateur players, including players from the Canadian women&#x27;s hockey team.

In September 2014, Pelletier was hired as a skating coach for the Edmonton Oilers of the National Hockey League, a role he still holds as of the 2024-25 season.

==Personal life==
Pelletier was married to ice dancer Marie-Josee Fortin for a year before he began skating with Salé and ended his marriage. Pelletier proposed to Salé on Christmas Day of 2004 in front of his parents and Salé&#x27;s mother. The couple was married on December 30, 2005, at the Fairmont Banff Springs hotel in Alberta. In 2006, they served as commentators on the television program &quot;Olympic Ice&quot; which aired on USA Network during the Winter Olympics in Torino Italy. Their son was born on September 30, 2007, at the Sturgeon Community Hospital and Health Centre in St. Albert, Alberta.

In June 2010, Salé and Pelletier announced plans to divorce following an 18-month separation, sharing custody of their son. They continued to skate together until retiring in 2012. Pelletier married Russian figure skater Ekaterina Gordeeva on July 25, 2020. They live in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada.

<text>Dasharatha (, IAST: Daśaratha; born Nemi) was the king of Kosala, with its capital at Ayodhya, in the Hindu epic &quot;Ramayana&quot;. Dasharatha married Kausalya, Sumitra and Kaikeyi. He was the father of Rama, the protagonist of the epic Ramayana, Bharata, Lakshmana, and Shatrughna. Dasharatha also finds mention in the &quot;Vishnu Purana&quot;.

==Legend==

=== Early life and marriage ===
King Dasharatha was believed to be an incarnation of Svayambhuva Manu, the son of the Hindu creator god, Brahma.

Dasharatha was born as the son of King Aja of Kosala and Indumati of Vidarbha. He was originally named Nemi, but he acquired the moniker &quot;Dasharatha&quot; (&#x27;ten chariots&#x27;) as his chariot could move in all ten directions, fly, and return to earth, and he could fight with ease in all of these directions.

Dasharatha became the ruler of Kosala after the death of his father. He was a great warrior who subjugated many of the neighbouring kingdoms with his prowess and slew many asuras in battle.

According to the &quot;Ayodhyā Kāṇḍa&quot; of the &quot;Ramayana&quot; (in chapter 34, verses 10–13), King Dasharatha had around 350 wives, three of whom were his favourite queens: Kausalya was his chief queen, Sumitra was his second queen Kaikeyi was his third queen. Kausalya hailed from the kingdom of Dakshina Kosala, Sumitra from Kashi, and Kaikeyi from the Kekeya Kingdom.

=== Yajñas to beget sons ===
Dasharatha ruled over Ayodhyā, but he lacked a son to carry on his dynasty. He decided to perform an Puthrakamesti yagnam in order to beget a son. His counsellor and charioteer, Sumantra, told him of a prophecy that by bringing the sage Rishyasringa to Ayodhyā, he would beget sons. To fulfil the prophecy, Dasharatha traveled to Anga, where king Romapada&#x27;s daughter Shanta was married to Rishyasringa. Bringing Rishyasringa to Kosala, he instructed the Brahmins to perform the Puthrakamesti yagnam. After the Puthrakamesti yagnam was properly performed, a Putrīyā Iṣṭi was performed for the attainment of sons.

During its performance, a figure emerged from the fire carrying a vessel of celestial porridge. Dasharatha offers half of this divine food to Kausalya, a quarter to Sumitra (i.e., literally &#x27;half of that which remained&#x27;), an eighth to Kaikeyi (i.e., again, &#x27;half of that which remained&#x27;), and then, upon reflection, gives the final eighth to Sumitra again. Kausalya gives birth to the prince Rama and Kaikeyi to Bharata. and Sumitra became the mother of Lakshmana and Shatrughna
=== Kaikeyi&#x27;s boons and Rama&#x27;s exile ===

In a battle between the devas and the asuras, Dasharatha rode to Devaloka, accompanied by Kaikeyi, to help Indra fight against the asuras. The devas were at a disadvantage due to the sorcery employed by Shambara and his army of asuras. Dasharatha, riding a chariot, faced the asuras in ten directions at the same time. In this battle, his chariot had to be turned to every direction in a swift manner. During the battle, the bolt of one of the wheels slipped out, and the wheel was about to disengage when Kaikeyi inserted her thumb in the hole of the bolt, and kept the chariot steady. When the king learnt of this, he was pleased, and offered her two boons. The queen said that she would ask for those two boons in the future, as she wished for nothing right then and there.

Manthara, Kaikeyi&#x27;s maid, feared that Kaikeyi would lose her status as chief queen at court if Rama ascended the throne, as Kausalya would thus become queen mother. Manthara later convinced Kaikeyi to demand two boons granted to her years earlier by Dasharatha. King Dasharatha will be obliged to fulfill them. As her two boons, Kaikeyi demanded that Bharata be crowned king, and Rama be sent to the forest for a period of fourteen years.

=== Killing of Shravana Kumara and death ===
After Rama&#x27;s departure to the forest, Dasharatha lay in his bed with a wailing Kaushalya. He suddenly remembered an incident which had occurred in his past. He narrated to Kausalya and Sumitra about how, by accident, he had killed a young man named Shravana, mistaking him to be a deer.

Dasharatha, who was then the crown prince, had gone hunting on the banks of River Sarayu. He was an expert in hunting by determining the direction of sound and heard the gurgle of an animal drinking water. Mistaking it to be deer, Dasharatha shot an arrow. He became mortified when he heard a human cry as the arrow found its target. Dasharatha hurried there to find a boy lying sprawled on the banks of the river with an arrow lodged in his chest. Dasharatha was aghast and profusely apologised to the young Shravana trying to revive and help him. The boy forgave Dasharatha for his unintentional, unrighteous act, and demanded that Dasharatha pull the arrow out of his chest. He also told him to take the pitcher of water to his blind parents, who must be waiting for him since they were thirsty because of all the travel. The boy died from his injury. Dasharatha approached the blind couple and told them about their son&#x27;s unfortunate death. The parents, grief-stricken, cursed Prince Dasharatha: &quot;Just as we are suffering and dying due to the separation from our beloved son, you too shall have the same fate.&quot;

Dasharatha concluded the chapter by saying that his end was near and the curse of Shravana&#x27;s parents had taken effect.

<text>Fuet (, lit. &quot;whip&quot;) is a Catalan thin, dry-cured, sausage of pork meat in a pork gut, covered with white, edible mold—similar to salami. The most famous is made in the &quot;comarca&quot; (county) of Osona and is also known as &quot;Vic fuet&quot; (&quot;fuet de Vic&quot;, after the city of Vic, capital of Osona). Other places that have long tradition of making it are the city of Olot and the surrounding areas.

Fuet is a long, thin shape measuring between 30 and 50 cm long and up to 4 cm in diameter, with a usual weight between 150 and 300 g. It is made of about 60% lean meat to 40% finely minced fat and is dry-cured.

== Flavour ==
Fuet is flavored with black pepper and garlic, and sometimes aniseed, but unlike chorizo contains no paprika.

== History ==
In Europe, natural fermented sausages have a long tradition originating in Mediterranean countries during Ancient times. The Celts were famous for their cured meat, including hams and sausages. In the Roman documentation there is evidence that the Iberians already made sausages with names still in use today. There are several Roman documents that praise the Cerdanya hams made by the Iberians as some of the best in the world. The importance of sausages in European culture led to the establishment of routes to obtain the ingredients to prepare sausages, such as the &quot;Via Salaria&quot; salt route in Italy.

<text>Dilīpa, also known as Khaṭvāṅga or Khash , was a king of the Ikshvaku dynasty featured in Ramayana and Hinduism. Dilipa is the son of krishakarma , the husband of Sudakshina, and the father of Raghu. Dilipa is also the name of a serpent born into the Kashyapa family. he succeeded his father mulaka.

==Legend==

=== Meeting with Vasishtha ===
One day, Dilipa met the sage Vasishtha on the banks of the Ganga river (Ganges). Vasishtha taught Dilipa about all the sacred waters and explained to him how each were great. This legend is found in the &quot;Padma Purāṇa&quot;.

=== Killing of Virasena ===
The &quot;Yuddha Kandam&quot; of the &quot;Ramavataram&quot; mentions the killing of Virasena, in which Dilipa is involved. Once an asura named Virasena attacked Kubera; however, the gods Shiva and Vishnu were unable to defeat him. Vishnu told Kubera to seek the help of the king Dilipa, who came to Kubera&#x27;s mythical city of Alaka. Dilipa fired arrow after arrow at Virasena, but every drop of blood spilled caused the formation of a new Virasena. To finish the unending battle, Dilipa prayed to the goddess Rakteshwari, who came and drank all the blood of Virasena, allowing for his death.

=== Birth of Raghu ===
The &quot;Padma Purāṇa&quot; and &quot;Uttarā Kāṇḍa&quot; of the &quot;Rāmāyaṇa&quot; mention the tale of the birth of Raghu. Dilipa was a noble, popular ruler who was married to Sudakshina, the princess of Magadha; however, he had no progeny. He and Sudakshina decided to go to the sage Vasishta in order to receive advice on how to obtain a child. At Vasishta&#x27;s &quot;ashrama&quot;, he told the couple that the reason they had no children was because they had slighted the divine cow Kamadhenu. He stated that once when Dilipa was visiting the god Indra, he had passed Kamadhenu but paid no attention to her. Kamadhenu took this as a personal insult, and cursed Dilipa so that he would not have any children until he served and propitiated Kamadhenu&#x27;s daughter, Nandini. Vasishta told Dilipa and Sudakshina that Nandani had gone to &quot;Patala&quot; to attend a sacrifice of the god Varuna. For the next twenty-one days, Dilipa and Sudakshina followed and attended on Nandini as she traversed &quot;Patala&quot;. One morning Nandini went to graze in a forest, and as usual Dilipa followed her. However, when Dilipa was focused on the beautiful wooden scenery, a lion jumped out and attacked Nandini. Dilipa aimed his bow and arrow at the lion to fire, but he was paralysed. The lion told Dilipa that he was a servant of the god Shiva, and that he had been ordained to protect a divine deodar cedar tree that had been planted by Shiva&#x27;s wife, Parvati. The lion stated that he was allowed to eat any animals that came near the deodar cedar tree, and so was justified in eating Nandini. Dilipa fell to his knees and bowed to the lion, and begged the lion to eat him rather than Nandini. Suddenly, the lion disappeared and Nandini revealed that she had done this to test Dilipa. After successfully propitiating Nandini, Dilipa and Sudakshina returned to the earthly realm and had a son named Raghu.

=== Life as a Royal Hermit ===
One day, Dilipa pleased God so much that he realized how long he had to live. He then left his royal duties to his ministers and spend the rest of his life in devotion and meditation. He performed 105 sacrifices, in which he made golden roads and was even visited by the god Indra. This description is found in the &quot;Bhāgavata Purāṇa&quot; and the &quot;Droṇa Parva&quot; of the &quot;Mahābhārata&quot;, where he is referred to as Khaṭvāṅga.

<text>The McDonnell Douglas CF-18 Hornet (official military designation CF-188) is a Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF) variant of the American McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornet fighter aircraft. In 1980, the F/A-18 was selected as the winner of the New Fighter Aircraft Project competition to replace CF-104 Starfighter, CF-101 Voodoo and the CF-116 Freedom Fighter. Deliveries of the CF-18 to the Canadian Armed Forces began in 1982. CF-18s have supported North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) air sovereignty patrols and participated in combat during the Gulf War in 1991, the Kosovo War in the late 1990s, and as part of the Canadian contribution to the international Libyan no-fly zone in 2011. CF-18s were also part of the Canadian contribution to the military intervention against ISIL, Operation Impact. A procurement process to replace the CF-18 with the Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II has been ongoing since 1997.

==Development==

===New Fighter Aircraft program===

In 1977, the Canadian government identified the need to replace the NATO-assigned CF-104 Starfighter, the NORAD-assigned CF-101 Voodoo and the CF-116 Freedom Fighter (although the decision was later made to keep the CF-116). Subsequently, the government proceeded with the New Fighter Aircraft (NFA) competition, with a purchase budget of around to purchase 130–150 of the winner of the competition. Candidates included the Grumman F-14 Tomcat, McDonnell Douglas F-15 Eagle, Panavia Tornado, Dassault Mirage F1 (later replaced by the Mirage 2000), plus the products of the American Lightweight Fighter (LWF) competition, the General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon, the F/A-18 Hornet, and a de-navalized version of the Hornet, the Northrop F-18L. The government stressed that the winner of the competition be a proven off-the-shelf design and provide substantial industrial benefits as part of the order.

By 1978, the New Fighter Aircraft competitors were short-listed to just three aircraft types: the F-16 and the two F-18 offerings. The F-14, F-15, and the Tornado were rejected due to their high purchase price, while Dassault dropped out of the competition. The F-18L combined the systems and twin-engine layout of the F-18 that Air Command favored with a lighter land-based equipment setup that significantly improved performance. Northrop, the primary contractor for the F-18L version, had not built the aircraft by the time of the NFA program, waiting on successful contracts before doing so. While Northrop offered the best industrial offset package, it would only &quot;pay off&quot; if other F-18L orders were forthcoming, something the Department of National Defence (DND) was not willing to bet on.
The F-14 almost entered Canadian service through the backdoor due to the Iranian Revolution. In the aftermath of the revolution, the United States cut off all military supplies to Iran, which meant that the Iranians&#x27; new fleet of F-14s would potentially be rendered unflyable due to a lack of spares. The Canadians offered to purchase them at a steeply discounted price. Negotiations ended before a deal was reached as it was revealed that Canadian involvement was crucial in the smuggling of American embassy personnel out of the new Islamic Republic.

In 1980, the McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornet was declared the winner of the New Fighter Aircraft competition. The order included 98 single-seat variants and 40 dual-seat variants, for a total of 138 purchased, plus 20 options (which were not exercised). The F/A-18 Hornet was then dubbed the CF-188. Outside official military documents, the aircraft are referred to as CF-18 Hornets. Reasons for the selection listed by the Canadian Forces were many of its requested features were included for the U.S. Navy; two engines for reliability (considered essential for conducting Arctic sovereignty and over-the-water patrols), an excellent radar set, while being considerably more affordable than the F-14 and the F-15. The CF-18 was procured from 1982 to 1988, at a total capital cost of $4 billion in 1982 dollars.

===CF-18 design changes===

The original CF-18 as delivered is largely identical to the F/A-18A and B models. A total of 138 CF-18s, consisting of 98 single-seat and 40 dual-seat models, were delivered. Many features that made the F/A-18 suitable for naval carrier operations were retained by the Canadian Forces, such as the robust landing gear, the arrestor hook, and wing folding mechanisms.

The most visible difference between a CF-18 and a U.S. F-18 is the 0.6-megacandela night identification light. This spotlight is mounted in the gun loading door on the port side of the aircraft. Some CF-18s have the light temporarily removed, but the window is always in place. Also, the underside of the CF-18 features a painted &quot;false canopy&quot;.

===Upgrades===
In 1994, engineers worked on a system that collected biomedical data from the passenger in the back seat of the aircraft. The need to upgrade the CF-18 was demonstrated during the Gulf War deployment and during the 1998-1999 Kosovo conflict as advances in technology had rendered some of the avionics on board the CF-18 obsolete and incompatible with NATO allies. In 2000, CF-18 upgrades became possible when the government increased the defence budget.

In 2001, the Incremental Modernization Project (IMP) was initiated. The project was broken into two phases over a period of eight years and was designed to improve air-to-air and air-to-ground combat capabilities, upgrade sensors and the defensive suite, and replace the datalinks and communications systems on board the CF-18 from the old F/A-18A and F/A-18B standard to the current F/A-18C and D standard. Boeing (merged with McDonnell Douglas) the primary contractor and L-3 Communications the primary subcontractor, was issued a contract for the modernization project starting in 2002. A total of 80 CF-18s, consisting of 62 single-seat and 18 dual-seat models were selected from the fleet for the upgrade program. The project is supposed to extend the life of the CF-18 until around 2017 to 2020.

====Incremental Modernization Project Phase I====
* Replacement of the AN/APG-65 radar with the new AN/APG-73 radar, which has triple the processing speed and memory capacity, while also incorporating Terrain Following and Terrain Avoidance modes for low level ground attack missions. Furthermore, the new AN/APG-73 radar is also capable of guiding the modern AIM-120 AMRAAM medium range missile.
* Addition of the AN/APX-111 Combined Interrogator and Transponder, otherwise known as an IFF (Identification Friend or Foe). The new IFF brings the CF-18 up to current NATO standards for combat identification.
* Replacement of the radios with the new AN/ARC-210, RT-1556/ARC VHF/UHF Radio. This radio, capable of line-of-sight communications on VHF/UHF frequencies as well as HAVE QUICK, HAVE QUICK II, and SINCGARS waveforms resolved the issues of compatibility with allied forces, and are more resistant to jamming.
* Replacement of the mission computers with the General Dynamics Advanced Information Systems AN/AYK-14 XN-8 mission computer with increased memory and processing capabilities.
* Replacement of the Stores Management System with the Smiths Aerospace AN/AYQ-9 Stores Management System. This makes the CF-18 more compatible with the latest of precision guided munitions (PGMs) and furthermore adds the MIL-STD-1760 interface for use of the AIM-120 AMRAAM missile and the JDAM family of GPS-guided bombs.
* Installation of a Global Positioning System/Inertial Navigation System (GPS/INS) capability, enhancing the CF-18&#x27;s navigational capabilities.

Within the same time frame, other non-IMP upgrades include:
* Installation of a new infrared sensor pod.
* Replacement of the old cathode-ray tube cockpit instrument panels with new flat paneled, full colour LCD displays from Litton Systems Canada (now L-3 Es Canada).
* Addition of a new night vision imaging system.
* Purchase of the AIM-120 AMRAAM medium-range missiles and other advanced air-to-air and air-to-ground munitions.
* Application of a landing gear &quot;get well&quot; program to reduce corrosion and improve gear retraction.
* Replacement of the existing CF-18 flight simulators with the Advanced Distributed Combat Training System.

The first completed &quot;Phase I&quot; CF-18 was delivered to the Canadian Forces on time in May 2003. Final delivery of all &quot;Phase I&quot; CF-18s was done at a ceremony on 31 August 2006 at L-3 Communications in Mirabel, Quebec.

====Incremental Modernization Project Phase II====
Phase II of the CF-18 Incremental Modernization Project was awarded to Boeing on 22 February 2005. It consists of the following upgrades:
* Addition of a Link 16 data net system to the aircraft, enhancing interoperability with major NATO allies.
* Integration of the Joint Helmet Mounted Cueing System from Boeing, BAE Systems, DRDC and L-3 Communications MAS.
* Addition of a crash survivable flight data recorder.
* Upgrade of the electronic warfare suite.

Within the same time frame, other upgrades unrelated to the IMP phases include the following.
* A fuselage Centre Barrel Replacement Project (for 40 of the upgraded aircraft)
* An Air Combat Manoeuvring Instrumentation System
* An Integrated Electronic Warfare Support Station
* An Electronic Warfare Test Equipment Project

The first completed &quot;Phase II&quot; CF-18 was delivered to the Canadian Forces on 20 August 2007, at a ceremony in Montreal. The total cost of the entire CF-18 Incremental Modernization Project and concurrent Hornet upgrades was expected to be around C$2.6 billion. The final upgraded aircraft was delivered in March 2010.

====Hornet Extension Program====
Phase I of the Hornet Extension Project (HEP) applies to entire fleet of 94 CF-188A/Bs and started in 2020 with completion expected in 2023. This will prolong the fighter&#x27;s parity and interoperability with NATO and civil aviation standards to 2032. The package further expands compatibility support with the longer ranged AIM-120D AMRAAM air-to-air missiles initially acquired in 2017. It includes the following upgrades: 
* Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) to replace the obsolescent transponders.
* New Honeywell GPS/INS systems
* Upgraded Collins Aerospace AN/ARC-210 RT-2036 (Gen 6) radios
* Airborne Joint Tactical Radios
* Upgrades to the Lockheed Martin Sniper
* Enhanced mission computers and data transfer units, and software updates for the Advanced Distributed Combat Training System (ADCTS) for networked flight simulation exercises.
Phase Il of the HEP applies to a fleet of 36 x CF-188A/B airframes with the estimated longest remaining life. Officially, &quot;Phase 2 is focused on additional combat capability upgrades for 36 CF-188 aircraft, to ensure that sufficient, operationally relevant, mission-ready CF-188 fighters are available to meet air power capability requirements in the current battle space until the future fighter fleet reaches full operational capability&quot;. Initial delivery is expected in 2023 with full operational capability expected by June 2025. These upgrades were part of a package which include the delivery of:
* 50 x AIM-9X Sidewinder Block II tactical missiles;
* 38 x CA/APG-79(V)4 active electronically scanned array (AESA) radars; 
* 38 x CA/APG-79(V)4 AESA radar A1 kits; 
* 46 x F/A-18A wide-band RADOMEs; 
* Upgrades to the Advanced Distributed Combat Training System; 
* On-going Technical assistance to support the upgraded jets

The total cost of the HEP Phase II package was estimated by US Congressional Budget Office at US$862.3 Million.

The total program cost for the CF-18 purchase and upgrade programs up until 2011 was approximately $11.5 billion (in 2011 dollars) including upgrades. Additionally, the cost of maintenance for any 20-year period has been approximately $5 billion, or $250 million per year.

On 8 March 2024, Arcfield Canada was awarded a CA$211.6 million (US$157.3 million) sustainment contract to support and maintain the CF-18&#x27;s avionics weapons systems, supply parts and provide end-to-end supply chain services with the contract being effective on 1 April 2024.

As of 5 February 2025, the Royal Canadian Air Force has officially begun equipping the AIM-9X Block II Sidewinder missile on its fleet of HEP Phase II upgraded CF-18s.

==Operational history==

===Entering service===
The first two CF-18s were formally handed over to 410 (Operational Training Unit) Squadron at CFB Cold Lake, Alberta on 25 October 1982. Further deliveries equipped 409, 439, and 421 Squadrons at Baden-Soellingen in then West Germany, the 410 Operation Training Unit, No. 416, and No. 441 Squadrons at Cold Lake, and 425 and 433 Escadrons (Squadrons) at CFB Bagotville, Quebec. Introduction into Canadian service was initially problematic due to early issues with structural fatigue which delayed initial deployment. As the initial bugs were worked out, the CF-18 started filling the NORAD interception and NATO roles as intended.

===Combat===

In 1991, Canada committed 26 CF-18s to the Gulf War on Operation Friction. The CF-18s were based in Doha, Qatar. During the Gulf War, Canadian pilots flew more than 5,700 hours, including 2,700 combat air patrol missions. These aircraft were taken from Canada&#x27;s airbase in Germany, CFB Baden-Soellingen. In the beginning the CF-18s began sweep-and-escort combat missions to support ground-attack strikes by Allied air forces. During the 100-hour Allied ground invasion in late February, CF-18s also flew 56 bombing sorties, mainly dropping non-guided (&quot;dumb&quot;) bombs on Iraqi artillery positions, supply dumps, and marshaling areas behind the lines. At the time the Canadian Hornets were unable to deploy precision guided munitions. This was the first time since the Korean War that the Canadian military had participated in combat operations.

Continuing violence in the former Yugoslavia brought CF-18s into theatre twice: first for a deployment (Operation Mirador) during August–November 1997 for air patrols supporting NATO peacekeepers in Bosnia and Herzegovina, and again from late June 1998 until late December 2000 (Operation Echo).

From March to June 1999, with 18 CF-18s already deployed to Aviano, Italy, Canada participated in both the air-to-ground and air-to-air roles. Canadian aircraft conducted 10 percent of the NATO strike sorties despite deploying a much smaller percentage of the overall forces. Canadian pilots flew 678 combat sorties: 120 defensive counter-air escorts for Allied strike packages and 558 bombing strikes during 2,577 combat flying hours. CF-18s dropped a total of 397 PGMs and 171 non-guided bombs on a wide variety of targets including surface-to-air missile sites, airfields, bridges and fuel storage areas.
Since 2001, CF-18s have responded to nearly 3,000 possible threats to Canada and the United States. A task group of CF-18s and CH-146 Griffons were deployed during &quot;Operation Grizzly&quot; to Kananaskis, Alberta in June 2002 where they were deployed to secure the airspace during the 28th G8 summit. In 2007, an unknown number of CF-18s were deployed to Alaska. They were deployed during two weeks to defend United States airspace as a result of the primary USAF F-15 fighter jet fleet being grounded due to structural defects. They were also deployed during &quot;Operation Podium&quot; to secure the 2010 Winter Olympics and 2010 Winter Paralympics games.

After a United Nations Security Council resolution was adopted to enforce a Libyan no-fly zone, the Government of Canada on 18 March 2011, authorized the deployment of six CF-18 Hornets with one Hornet in reserve as part of Operation Mobile. The Hornets were based at Trapani-Birgi Italian Air Force base in western Sicily. CF-18s were first put into combat on 23 March 2011 when four aircraft bombed Libyan government targets. The seven Hornets returned to CFB Bagotville, Canada, on 4 November 2011 after the end of the UN-approved NATO mission. In total, the Hornets conducted 946 sorties, making up 10% of NATO strike sorties. Over the course of their sorties, 696 bombs were dropped including Laser-guided bombs and Joint Direct Attack Munitions (JDAM). The RCAF has dropped 495 of the 227 kg versions (500 lbs) and 188 of the 910 kg versions (2,000 lbs) Paveway II bombs. The RCAF also dropped 11 Joint Direct Attack Munitions of the 227 kg versions and two 910 kg versions.
Canada sent six CF-18s to Iraq as part of Operation Impact on 21 October 2014. Air strikes on ISIS/ISIL positions began on 2 November 2014. The CF-18s flew air strike missions until 15 February 2016.

===Replacement===

Various fighter aircraft have been considered by the Canadian Forces as CF-18 replacements, with the Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II, Eurofighter Typhoon, Saab JAS 39 Gripen, Dassault Rafale, and the Boeing F/A-18E/F Super Hornet having been promoted as contenders by their manufacturers. According to &quot;Le Devoir&quot;, project costs without considering maintenance, training and spare parts, were estimated at $4 to $8 billion. Boeing indicated that the Super Hornet, a derivative of the Hornet, was a less expensive alternative at an estimated total cost of $4 billion. One of the manufacturers in contention, Boeing, BAE Systems or Saab Aerospace—the name was not disclosed—had promised to assemble the entire aircraft in Canada. Boeing said that it was contemplating closing the F/A-18 production line due to lack of orders.

In July 2010, Canada announced that the F-35 would replace the CF-18. Canada has been a partner in the Joint Strike Fighter program since 1997, and a Tier 3 partner since 2002. The Canadian Forces planned to buy 65 F-35s with deliveries starting in 2016; the contract was estimated to be worth C$9 billion, including aircraft and associated weapons, infrastructure, initial spares, training simulators, contingency funds and project operating costs. Media reports indicated that the lifetime cost of the aircraft might be as high as C$40 billion. In December 2012, it was announced that the government had abandoned the F-35 deal due to escalating cost, and was beginning a new procurement process, with the F-35 still being considered.

On 20 September 2015, Canadian Liberal Party leader Justin Trudeau promised to cancel the country&#x27;s F-35 procurement if he were elected, instead replacing the CF-18 fleet with a less costly alternative, and argued that the F-35 was not needed. He was sworn in as Prime Minister on 4 November 2015. In May 2017, Defence Minister Harjit Sajjan announced that Canada would purchase more than the 65 jets proposed by the previous government. He stated that if Canada is to meet its NATO and NORAD commitments while also maintaining its own national air defence, &quot;then 65 jets would not be a full fleet. It would only be a fleet for risk managing our requirements, not meeting them.&quot; On 2 June 2017, it was announced that Canada would be acquiring 88 advanced multi-role fighters.

As an interim measure pending replacement, Canada decided in December 2017 to purchase 18 F/A-18A/B Hornets (a mix of flyable airframes and spares) from the Royal Australian Air Force for approximately C$90 million. It was later announced in an Australian Senate hearing that Canada planned to purchase another seven Hornets to be disassembled for spare parts. The first two fighters arrived in February 2019, with the rest to be delivered over the next three years. &quot;Total cost of the interim aircraft including modifications, inspections and changes to infrastructure and program costs was estimated to be C$360 million.&quot; In 2021 the last RAAF fighter was delivered.

On 28 March 2022, Canada announced that advanced negotiations with Lockheed Martin for 88 F-35s would begin. The F-35 is the top bid for the Future Fighter Capability Project while Saab&#x27;s proposal for the Gripen came in second. The Canadian government noted that the Gripen may be chosen if negotiations with Lockheed Martin stall. This decision was to ensure a reasonable price for the aircraft. If negotiations succeed and Canada agrees a contract with Lockheed Martin, deliveries should begin in 2026, with final delivery in 2032. The complete program cost, including sustainment and maintenance, is estimated to be up to C$19 billion. In December 2022, the Canadian government approved $7 billion to procure a first batch of 16 F-35As and related equipment and support.

The CF-18 is used as a primary element of the new logo for the Winnipeg Jets NHL hockey team, as an homage to the city&#x27;s connection to the RCAF/CF as well as an earlier Olympic gold medal-winning team, the Ottawa RCAF Flyers. The official unveiling described the origin of the design involving the cooperation of the Department of National Defence and was inspired by the logo of the Royal Canadian Air Force. Team spokesman Dorian Morphy, Senior Director, Marketing &amp; Brand Management of True North Sports &amp; Entertainment indicated, &quot;We are thrilled to be able to continue this relationship in a significant way. The design cues for the plane were inspired by the military jets flown by the Air Force over the years.&quot;

<text>The Ford Mondeo is a car manufactured by Ford since 1993. The first Ford model declared as a &quot;world car&quot;, the Mondeo was intended to consolidate several Ford model lines worldwide (the European Sierra, the Telstar in Asia and Australia, and the Tempo/Mercury Topaz in North America). The Mondeo nameplate is derived from the Latin word &quot;mundus&quot;, meaning &quot;world&quot;. For its first two generations, the Mondeo was produced using the CDW27 platform, with the third-generation model shifting to the EUCD platform. The fourth-generation models use the CD4 platform, and the fifth-generation use the C2 platform.

Due to declining sales and a growing trend towards crossover SUVs over saloons and estates, Ford announced in March 2021 that it will discontinue the production of the Mondeo in Europe and Argentina with no direct successor. Production of the Mondeo ended in Europe in March 2022.

== First generation (1992) ==
The first-generation Mondeo was introduced in November 1992, with sales beginning in March 1993. Intended as a world car, the first-generation Mondeo was significant as its design and marketing were shared between Ford USA in Dearborn and Ford of Europe. It replaced the Ford Sierra in Europe, the Ford Telstar in a large portion of Asia and other markets, while it is also sold as the Ford Contour and Mercury Mystique in North America to replace the Ford Tempo and Mercury Topaz. Unlike the Sierra, the Mondeo is front-wheel drive in its most common form, with a rarer four-wheel drive version available on the Mk I car only. Despite being billed as a world car, the only external items the Mondeo shared initially with the Contour built in Kansas City Assembly in Claycomo, Missouri, and Cuautitlán Assembly were the windscreen, front windows, front mirrors and door handles. Three body styles were available, which are saloon, liftback, and estate.

The mid-cycle facelift was launched in October 1996 leaving only the doors, the roof, and the rear quarter panels on the estate the same as the original model. The extensive redesign in 1996 was known as the Mondeo Mk II.

== Second generation (2000) ==

The second-generation Mondeo was introduced in October 2000. This Mondeo was considerably larger than its predecessor, while the basic chassis and suspension design was carried over from the previous generation along with the CDW27 platform. Following the standard setting interior of the Volkswagen Passat (B5) in 1996, Ford paid a great deal of attention to the second generation Mondeo&#x27;s interior and was the first major American manufacturer to react to the new standard set by Volkswagen. Ford abandoned its New Edge design theme for the second generation, opting to take the Prodigy concept car as a design reference. Ford dispensed with the rounded American style interior of the first generation, and developed a more sober &#x27;Germanic&#x27; design. Saloon, liftback, and estate body styles were available.

This Mondeo came to Mexico, replacing the North American built Ford Contour, and was sold from 2001 to 2007, when the Ford Fusion replaced it. The second generation Mondeo was never sold in Australia, as Ford Australia argued that the segment of the market was in decline.

== Third generation (2006) ==

The third-generation Mondeo was introduced in late 2006. Based on the EUCD platform developed with Volvo, the platform was the same as that used in the new large MPVs Galaxy and S-MAX. Its design theme was first shown as the Ford Iosis concept at the 2005 Frankfurt Motor Show, which gave an indication to the look of the Mk IV Mondeo. The new car, in estate bodystyle, was pre-launched in &#x27;concept&#x27; form at the Paris Motor Show in September 2006.

As with the previous model, the Mk IV Mondeo was not marketed in the United States or Canada because Ford sold the same-class Fusion, which was launched in 2005. The 2007 Mondeo marked the return to the Australian market after a six-year absence, due to a resurgence in popularity of medium-sized cars in the last few years.

In September 2010, a mid-cycle facelifted Mk IV Mondeo was introduced with some changes, such as the new EcoBoost engines and LED daytime running lights. The front and rear of the car had minor changes, the biggest being the new design theme dubbed as the Kinetic Design. The interior was improved, with a use of better materials.

== Fourth generation (2012) ==

The fourth-generation Mondeo was unveiled by Ford at the 2012 North American International Auto Show in Detroit, Michigan. Due to the merge of both models, the vehicle is sold as the Fusion in the Americas. With a design team based in Detroit for the planning and global launch phase, the new model takes many styling cues from the previous generation Ford Mondeo, and previous generation American Ford Fusion. Like the newest redesigns of the Focus and Fiesta before it, the new Mondeo is set on a global platform shared with the now-identical Fusion sold in North America.

The range does not include five- or six-cylinder engines, and on launch had a complete range of Ford EcoBoost engines.

Ford ceased production of the Mondeo at their Valencia Plant in March 2022 as Mondeo sales dwindled with buyers preferring crossovers and SUVs. 

== Fifth generation (2022) ==

The fifth-generation Mondeo saloon was released in China in January 2022. Ford confirmed that the model would not be marketed in Europe and North America. It is marketed in the Middle East as the Ford Taurus.

== Motorsport ==

The Mondeo competed in the British Touring Car Championship (BTCC) between 1993 and 2000. The cars, prepared by former series champion Andy Rouse, did not enter the 1993 season until the eighth round, at Pembrey, in Wales. Rouse and Paul Radisich were the drivers in the Mondeo&#x27;s first season. Radisich went on to win the FIA World Touring Car Cup in both 1993 and 1994 driving a Mondeo.

Ford ran a factory-sponsored team, called Ford Team Mondeo, for eight seasons. Andy Rouse Engineering ran the cars from 1993 to 1995, when West Surrey Racing ran the works team from 1996 to 1998, with Prodrive taking over beginning 1999.

In 2000, the team expanded from two cars to three when drivers Alain Menu and Anthony Reid were joined by 1998 series champion Rickard Rydell, recruited from the disbanded Volvo team. The team dominated the season of 2000, finishing 1–2–3 (Menu–Reid–Rydell) in the drivers&#x27; standings and winning the manufacturers&#x27; championship by 104 points.

A complete overhaul of the BTCC following the season of 2000 had the Super Touring regulations scrapped as the series moved towards less expensive, but slower race cars. Ford withdrew from BTCC competition prior to 2001.

The touring cars, after their withdrawal, went on sale to the public and are now in the hands of other drivers. Two of the 2000 series Mondeos have been spotted in the BRSCC series of LMA Euro saloons; drivers known to own them at present are Bernard Hogarth and Alvin Powell.

The Mk I and Mk II Mondeo have followed many other previous Ford models into the world of banger racing in the United Kingdom, and with plenty of older cars being available for very little money, the Mondeo is now a popular and relatively easy car to race. The Zetec engines are converted to run off a carb set up and the Mondeo bodyshell is fairly tough, but they are proving rather rigid, with many drivers getting injured in high-speed impacts. Mondeos are proving more popular than the Sierra and Mk III Granada.

In Argentina, the Mondeo is one of several cars to compete in the local Top Race racing category; its body is handcrafted in reinforced fiberglass. The Mondeo is so far the most successful car in the category, with three championship titles in the TRV6 class and two championship titles in the Top Race series (formerly Top Race Junior).

The winning drivers in the TRV6 class were Omar Martínez (2006), José María López (2009), and Guido Falaschi (Copa América 2010) with the Mondeo II (based on the MkIII Mondeo), and in the TR Junior category, the championship was won by Gonzalo Perlo in 2008 and Humberto Krujoski in 2010. In 2009, the Mondeo III (based on the MkIV Mondeo) bodystyle was approved and presented as an option within the category; however, the Mondeo II bodywork is still being used.

Similarly, in the United States, the Fusion/Mondeo Mk 5 bodywork began use for the sixth-generation body in the NASCAR Sprint Cup Series starting in 2013, replacing the current Mazda6-based Fusion.

<text>Darrell Lee Waltrip (born February 5, 1947) is an American motorsports analyst, author as well as a former national television broadcaster and stock car driver. He raced from 1972 to 2000 in the NASCAR Cup Series (known as the NASCAR Winston Cup Series during his time as a driver), most notably driving the No. 11 Chevrolet for Junior Johnson. Waltrip is a three-time Cup Series champion (1981, 1982, 1985).

Widely regarded as one of the greatest drivers in NASCAR history, Waltrip won 84 NASCAR Cup Series races throughout his career, including the 1989 Daytona 500, a record five in the Coca-Cola 600 (formerly the World 600) (1978, 1979, 1985, 1988, 1989), and a track and Series record for any driver at Bristol Motor Speedway with 12 (seven consecutive from 1981 to 1984). He is fifth on NASCAR&#x27;s all-time wins list in the Cup Series, one behind Bobby Allison and place him second to Jeff Gordon for the most wins in NASCAR&#x27;s modern era. He is ranked fifth for all-time pole positions with 59, including all-time modern era highs with 35 on short tracks and eight on road courses. Competing in 809 Cup starts over four decades and 29 years (1972–2000), he has scored 271 Top 5s and 390 Top 10s, and posted a modern NASCAR series record of 22 top five finishes in 1983 and 21 top five finishes both in 1981 and 1986. Winning nearly $19.9 million in posted earnings, he became the first NASCAR driver to be awarded over $10 million in career race winnings.

Waltrip has additionally won 13 NASCAR Busch Grand National Series races, seven American Speed Association (ASA) races, three IROC races, two Automobile Racing Club of America (ARCA) races, two NASCAR All-American Challenge Series events, two All Pro Racing Association races, and a USAC race. He competed in the 24 Hours of Daytona. He also holds the all-time track record 67 wins at the Fairgrounds Speedway in Nashville, Tennessee, including NASCAR, USAC, ASA, and local &quot;Late Model Sportsman&quot; NASCAR sanctioned series races. He still holds many NASCAR records, more than two decades after his retirement as an active driver.

He has also won many awards in NASCAR. That includes two for NASCAR&#x27;s Most Popular Driver Award (1989, 1990), three for &quot;American Driver of the Year&quot; (1979, 1981, 1982), and &quot;NASCAR&#x27;s Driver of the Decade&quot; for the 1980s, as well as three for &quot;National Motorsports Press Association Driver of the Year&quot; (1977, 1981, and 1982), two for &quot;Auto Racing Digest Driver of the Year&quot; (1981 and 1982), the first &quot;Tennessee Professional Athlete of the Year&quot; (1979), one of NASCAR&#x27;s 50 Greatest Drivers in 1998, and the Bill France &quot;Award of Excellence&quot; in 2000. He has been inducted into numerous halls of fame, including the Motorsports Hall of Fame of America for 2003 the International Motorsports Hall of Fame for 2005. After being nominated for the inaugural 2010 and 2011 classes, he was inducted into the NASCAR Hall of Fame&#x27;s 2012 class.

Waltrip served as a color analyst for Fox Sports alongside Mike Joy, Larry McReynolds, and Jeff Gordon, a columnist at Foxsports.com, and an author. He is the older brother of former NASCAR driver and the now defunct MWR team owner Michael Waltrip. Waltrip retired from the commentary box at the conclusion of Fox&#x27;s broadcast schedule for the 2019 NASCAR season in June 2019.

==Early years==

Waltrip was born on February 5, 1947, in Owensboro, Kentucky. Starting his driving career in Go-karts at age 12, Waltrip entered his first stock car race just four years later. Waltrip and his father built a 1936 Chevrolet coupe and headed to a local dirt track near their Owensboro home. The first night out was far from a success as the youngster, barely old enough to drive on the street, slammed the wall and heavily damaged the coupe. Waltrip soon left the dirt and found his niche on asphalt where the smoothness he learned in the karts proved a valuable asset. Waltrip was a 1965 graduate of Daviess County High School in Owensboro.

He was an early racer at the Kentucky Motor Speedway (an asphalt track in Whitesville) and Ellis Raceway, a dirt track on US Highway 60 west in Daviess County (Ellis Raceway is now closed), driving a car called &quot;Big 100&quot; built by Harry Pedley, owner of Pedley&#x27;s Garage, on West Second Street, in Owensboro and sponsored by R.C. Bratcher Radiator and Welding Co. His success gained the attention of Nashville owner/driver P. B. Crowell, who urged Waltrip to move to the area to race at the Fairgrounds Speedway, at the Tennessee State Fairgrounds in Nashville, where he would win two track championships, in 1970, and 1973.

Waltrip drove the No. 48 P. B. Crowell owned Ford sponsored by American Home, in Nashville, where he aggressively promoted the week&#x27;s race when he appeared on a local television program promoting the speedway&#x27;s races, and was not afraid to embrace the local media when other competitors were reluctant to do so. Some of the notorious &quot;on air&quot; trash-talking included making fun of some of the other local drivers such as Coo Coo Marlin (whose son Sterling later raced at the circuit and is a two-time Daytona 500 winner) and James &quot;Flookie&quot; Buford, whose nickname he would mock on air. It pleased track management that he was helping sell tickets, leading to packed grandstands and extra paychecks from track operators for his promotional skills.

He became friends with WSM radio host Ralph Emery in his early years, forming a bond which would be influential throughout his career, as Waltrip would appear frequently on Emery&#x27;s early morning television show on local Nashville television station, WSMV, and later substitute for Emery in the 1980s on Emery&#x27;s television show, &quot;Nashville Now&quot; on the former TNN cable network (now the Paramount Network). Waltrip would use the success he enjoyed at the Music City Motorplex, and his notoriety and public speaking skills that he acquired from television appearances in Nashville, as a springboard into NASCAR&#x27;s big leagues.

He became a Christian in 1983 but states it was years later before God came first in his life. One of the charities he supports is the Motor Racing Outreach (MRO) providing spiritual support to racers and their families.

==NASCAR career==

===Early years in NASCAR: 1972–1975===
Waltrip started in NASCAR Winston Cup Series (Winston Cup), NASCAR&#x27;s top racing series at age 25, (25 years, 3 months, 2 days), on May 7, 1972, at the 1972 Winston 500, at Talladega, Alabama, the series&#x27; fastest and longest track at 2.66 miles, (4.281 kilometers), driving a 1969 Mercury Cyclone he purchased from Holman-Moody, originally the Ford Fairlane driven by Mario Andretti to victory in the 1967 Daytona 500. Waltrip finished 38th in his first Winston Cup race after retiring on lap 69 due to engine failure. Waltrip paid $12,500 for the car, a spare engine and some spare parts and drove it in 5 cup series events until mid-1973. The car was converted from the Ford Fairlane Andretti drove, to a 1969 Mercury Cyclone as driven by Waltrip, and later converted to a 1971 Mercury Cyclone. The car was sponsored by Terminal Transport of Owensboro, Kentucky, Waltrip&#x27;s first major sponsor. Waltrip still owns the car today as part of a collection of cars he has raced and is one of his favorites.

The early years found Waltrip competing against legendary stock car racers such as Richard Petty, David Pearson, Cale Yarborough, and Bobby Allison, among others. Waltrip soon earned the respect of his more experienced peers. He was given the No. 95 as a number but Waltrip preferred car No. 17 because his hero, David Pearson, had success with the number in earlier years. As an owner/driver, Waltrip ran 5 races in 1972, 14 races in 1973, 16 races in 1974, with 7 top-five finishes, and 17 races as an owner/driver in 1975, with his first Winston Cup victory coming at his home track, May 10, 1975, at age 28, (28 years, 3 months, 5 days), in the Music City 420, outpacing the field by two laps at the track where he had won 2 track championships in Nashville, Tennessee, in the No. 17 Terminal Transport Chevrolet, a car Waltrip owned.

During the 1973 season, Waltrip drove 5 Winston Cup races for Bud Moore Engineering.

===DiGard years: 1975–1980===
Except for five races in 1973, driving for Bud Moore Engineering, Waltrip primarily drove his own cars from the beginning of his NASCAR career until the middle of the 1975 NASCAR Winston Cup Series (Winston Cup) season, when he was signed to a multi-year contract and replaced driver Donnie Allison to drive the No. 88 DiGard Chevrolet, Waltrip&#x27;s long-awaited jump into the big leagues of United States stock car auto racing. The DiGard racing team was founded in part by Mike DiProspero and Bill Gardner, who were brothers-in-law, with the legendary Robert Yates as engine builder.

Waltrip&#x27;s first race with DiGard came on August 17, 1975, at the Talladega 500, Talladega Superspeedway, in Talladega, Alabama, finishing 42nd after experiencing engine failure. Waltrip would compete in ten more races in the 1975 season for DiGard, sponsored by Terminal Transport, and get his second career Winston Cup victory October 12, 1975, in the Capital City 500, in Richmond, Virginia. He would post three top-five and four top-ten finishes in the 11 races he ran for DiGard in 1975.

During the late 1970s, Waltrip would begin his domination of NASCAR&#x27;s short track venues, especially at the Bristol International Speedway (Bristol, Tennessee), Martinsville Speedway (Martinsville, Virginia) and the Music City Motorplex (Nashville). He holds the track record at Bristol International Speedway, for wins with 12 victories, and for pole positions at Martinsville Speedway, with 8 pole position awards.

In 1976, Gatorade became Waltrip&#x27;s primary sponsor as he started his first full race season at age 29, driving the DiGard Gatorade Chevrolet. Waltrip won only one Winston Cup race in 1976, the Virginia 500, at Martinsville Speedway in Ridgeway, Virginia, but in 1977 and 1978, working with legendary NASCAR crew chief Buddy Parrott, he won six times each year, including his first of four career victories at the Talladega Superspeedway, in Talladega, AL, on May 1, 1977, and his first of a five career victories in the series&#x27; longest race, a grueling 600 mile race, the Coca-Cola 600 (formerly the World 600), May 28, 1978. Waltrip, and Parrott, would win 21 NASCAR races together from 1977 through 1980.

In perhaps the most famous and most well known NASCAR race, the 1979 Daytona 500, held February 18, 1979, a race that Richard Petty won, Waltrip was a pre-race favorite to win the race. As the first NASCAR race covered &quot;flag to flag&quot; on national television, Cale Yarborough, and Donnie Allison, while battling for the lead on the last lap, came together and crashed hard, taking each other out in the third turn. While the Allison and Yarborough cars were spinning and coming to rest in the grassy infield, attention turned quickly to the new leaders, Richard Petty running third, and Waltrip, running closely behind in fourth, as a fist fight ensued between Yarborough, Donnie Allison, and his brother and racer, Bobby Allison, in the turn three grass. Earlier in the race, Waltrip&#x27;s DiGard Gatorade Oldsmobile, dropped a cylinder and while able to hang onto the slipstream of the Petty car on the final lap, was not able to draft past the Petty car in the fourth turn on the final lap due to the reduction in horsepower. Still, Waltrip finished runner-up in perhaps the most famous race in NASCAR history, and was an early turning point in Waltrip&#x27;s career.

The 1979 Daytona 500 would be an early season precursor for the remaining nine months of the racing season. Waltrip and Petty would engage in a bitter battle, race after race, for the 1979 NASCAR championship. In that 1979 season, Waltrip won seven Winston Cup races and was a serious contender for what would have been his first championship despite numerous engine failures, mechanical problems, and differences with DiGard management. On September 23, 1979, after winning pole position and leading 184 laps at the Old Dominion 500, at Martinsville, Virginia, Waltrip again experienced engine failure. The DiGard team pitted the car and made a rare mid-race engine change in a record 11 minutes. Waltrip lost 29 laps in the pits but was able to finish 11th, as Petty finished 2nd.

At the start of the final race of the season, the Los Angeles Times 500, at Ontario Motor Speedway, Ontario, California, Waltrip led Richard Petty by a scant 2 points in the year-long championship battle after finishing the race 5th ahead of Petty&#x27;s 6th-place finish in the previous race, the Dixie 500, Atlanta Motor Speedway, November 4, 1979. However, Petty won an unprecedented seventh, and his final, NASCAR Cup Series championship by finishing the final race of the season in 5th position, as Waltrip finished 8th. The final margin of Petty&#x27;s championship victory over Waltrip was only 11 points, the third-closest points race in NASCAR Cup Series history.

Waltrip closed out the 1970s driving the No. 88 DiGard Chevrolet, sponsored by Gatorade, ranked NASCAR&#x27;s No. 2 driver, having won 22 Winston Cup races in just 149 race starts. His aggressive driving style and outspoken demeanor earned him the nickname &quot;Jaws&quot;, a reference to the 1975 film about a killer shark. The nickname was given to Waltrip by rival Cale Yarborough in an interview after Waltrip crashed Yarborough and D.K. Ulrich out of the 1977 Southern 500. Ulrich assumed that Yarborough had caused the wreck and questioned him after the race, to which Yarborough famously responded, &quot;That Jaws ran into you.&quot; Waltrip himself preferred the nicknames &quot;D.W.&quot; or &quot;D-Dubya&quot; but he acknowledged Yarborough by displaying an inflatable toy shark in his pit at the next race.

At the height of his NASCAR Cup Series success in the early 1980s, fans often booed Waltrip, in large part because of his success on the track defeating more established drivers with large fan followings, but also because of his open criticism of NASCAR, his admitting to condoning cheating, and his aggressive &quot;take no prisoners&quot;, &quot;win at all costs&quot; approach to driving. Doing him no favors was his widely publicized falling-out with DiGard leadership, where he publicly admitted that he would not have won a championship as long as he drove for them. He attempted several times to be released from his driving contract with DiGard in 1980, a year in which Waltrip won five Winston Cup races. Still, Waltrip had a huge and devoted fan following. It was often said by race commentators and sports columnists that &quot;you either hate him or love him&quot;.

It was Waltrip&#x27;s rival Cale Yarborough, driver for legendary owner Junior Johnson, that privately told Waltrip that he intended to cut back on his racing appearances and leave Junior Johnson &amp; Associates team at the end of the 1980 season, opening the position for Waltrip, but only if Waltrip could successfully negotiate an early termination of his contract with DiGard. Waltrip successfully negotiated his exit from DiGard, and would take over the No. 11 for 1981.

===Junior Johnson years: 1981–1986===

Waltrip&#x27;s success driving the Junior Johnson prepared cars came immediately and even surpassed the highly successful years he had with DiGard. In his first two years as driver for the Mountain Dew sponsored Buick Regal, Waltrip won 12 races each year, and his first two NASCAR Winston Cup Series (Winston Cup) championships, in 1981 and 1982. Waltrip&#x27;s success and driving prowess helped to bring the Buick Grand National into prominence. The company later honored the Waltrip years with throwback paint schemes, once in 2006 and again in 2008.

It was during the early 1980s, with Junior Johnson, that Waltrip first worked with Jeff Hammond, a pit crewman for Johnson. Hammond was at first skeptical of Waltrip&#x27;s driving style since it differed so much from the former driver for whom he worked, Cale Yarborough. Yarborough made adjustments to his driving based on the handling of the car in a particular race whereas Waltrip wanted the car adjusted around his driving style. Hammond eventually came to appreciate Waltrip&#x27;s &quot;finesse&quot;, and smooth driving style which proved highly successful. Waltrip and Hammond would benefit from each other&#x27;s knowledge and abilities and would work together for most of their careers in the sport. Waltrip and Hammond work together, even today, as broadcaster and analyst at Fox Sports, and Speed TV.

Waltrip&#x27;s first season with Junior Johnson was a huge success. He won 12 races including big races such as the Rebel 500, the Food City 500, and the Riverside 400 event. He almost swept Talladega for his 1981 season by nearly winning the Talladega 500. On the final lap rookie Ron Bouchard dove under Waltrip and Terry Labonte to take the lead. Bouchard beat Waltrip by a foot in a 3-wide drag race in what has been called the biggest upset in NASCAR history. Waltrip reportedly said &quot;Where the hell did he come from?&quot; in an interview. Waltrip also stated in a post-race conference that part of the reason he lost the race was because he thought Bouchard was a lap down and therefore did not block Bouchard.

He ended 1981 with 11 poles, 12 wins, 21 top fives, and 25 top tens. Not only did Waltrip win 12 races, he also won the Winston Cup championship over nemesis Bobby Allison, rallying from a nearly 300-point deficit in midsummer and taking the points lead for keeps with a second-place finish at Dover in September. Waltrip then strung together four consecutive victories and ran well in the final two races of the season to win by 53 points.

In 1982, Waltrip again won 12 races and basically repeated his 1981 season. He claimed his second championship in a row that year, again scratching and clawing his way past Bobby Allison with a late-season charge, taking the lead at Martinsville in October, and winning the title by 72 points.

At the 1983 Daytona 500 on February 20, 1983, Waltrip, a pre-race favorite to win the race, drove the Chevrolet Monte Carlo SS Pepsi Challenger. He was involved in an accident when his car spun on lap 64, at exit of turn 4, at nearly , as he was making an evasive maneuver to avoid rear-ending a much slower car ahead of him. Waltrip locked his brakes but the car slid for several hundred feet, then struck an earthen embankment near the entrance to pit road. The force of the impact was so violent that Waltrip&#x27;s car was thrown back onto the track, in front of oncoming traffic. Waltrip then made hard contact with the outside concrete retaining wall once again into oncoming traffic. Cale Yarborough, the eventual winner of the race, barely avoided hitting the demolished Pepsi Challenger. Waltrip was taken by ambulance to the Halifax Medical Center for observation and medical treatment. The crash was a wake-up call and a life-changing event for Waltrip. When he heard drivers and fans joking that the crash would &quot;knock him conscious&quot; or &quot;finally shut him up&quot;, he realized for the first time how unpopular he was and resolved to clean up his image. The years following that crash would see a different Darrell Waltrip, one who worked hard to repair and rebuild his relationship with fans and fellow drivers. Years later, Waltrip would be voted (by NASCAR fans) &quot;Most Popular Driver&quot;, two years in a row, (1989, 1990).

Waltrip would continue his unprecedented success driving for Junior Johnson through the 1986 season, winning his third and final Winston Cup championship, in 1985, winning the inaugural All-Star race, The Winston, in 1985, and compiling 43 total wins with the team.

Waltrip was quick to recognize the new and rapid expansion of the sport&#x27;s popularity among teens and young adults and others never before considered NASCAR fans. The growth was primarily due to increasing national network and cable subscription television which televised almost every NASCAR event live, and the growing interest of new family oriented sponsors never before associated with motorsports. NASCAR was becoming a multi-regional sport enjoyed by men, women and children alike. In addition to the huge influx of money from new sponsors and television, the more astute NASCAR team owners immediately embraced new resources such as computers, telemetry, research and development, multi-car teams for information sharing, wind-tunnel testing, and engineering. Waltrip, now one of two drivers for Johnson, was quick to envision the future of NASCAR and sought to take advantage of the coming changes something his car owner, Junior Johnson a pioneer of the sport, was somewhat reluctant to embrace. Johnson and his team had enjoyed success for decades and won numerous races and championships spanning decades using his own formulas for success.

Well aware of Junior Johnson&#x27;s long-standing steadfast rule of never discussing an adjustment to a driver&#x27;s contractual salary, and never really comfortable with the allocation of resources that Johnson&#x27;s two car team required, Waltrip approached Johnson about an increase in his contract salary. Although the story as told by Waltrip is most likely folklore, Waltrip drove his final race for Junior Johnson on November 16, 1986, in a Chevrolet sponsored by Budweiser finishing 4th at that year&#x27;s Winston Western 500 at Riverside International Raceway, completing one of the most successful owner/driver partnerships in all of motorsports history. Waltrip and Johnson remained close friends and respected each other as pioneers and champions of the sport.

===Hendrick Motorsports years: 1987–1990===

Waltrip&#x27;s partnership with car owner Junior Johnson led to huge success with three NASCAR Winston Cup Series (Winston Cup) championships and 43 Winston Cup wins. The connection between fast cars and alcohol consumption became a concern for him. He began to seek other opportunities after a conversation with his friend and pastor Cortez Cooper. Johnson had signed Budweiser to be his team&#x27;s primary sponsor in 1984, which unintentionally made Waltrip one of the faces of the connection he was so concerned about.

Years before, Waltrip had opened a Honda dealership in his home town of Franklin, Tennessee, with the help of his friend, Rick Hendrick, owner of Hendrick Motorsports. During the 1986 season, Waltrip and Hendrick discussed the possibility of Waltrip joining the Hendrick organization, which fielded cars for Geoff Bodine and Tim Richmond and the two discussed the potential of Waltrip moving to a new team. Waltrip was still under contract with Johnson for the 1986 season, but following the year he was able to break the contract in a unique way. As he recounted in an interview for the Fox Sports Net series &quot;Beyond the Glory&quot; in 2001, Waltrip gained his release by purposely breaking one of Johnson&#x27;s cardinal rules: asking for a raise (Johnson forbade his drivers from discussing money matters, including raises, with him). After signing, Hendrick formed a third team for Waltrip, carrying the No. 17 and sponsored by Tide.

In 1987, his first year with Hendrick Motorsports, Waltrip had limited success, compared to his previous years with Johnson. He won only one race (at the Goody&#x27;s 500) and had six Top 5 finishes. In 1988, he won two races, including his fourth Coca-Cola 600 win.

In the first race of 1989, the Daytona 500, Waltrip won the race for the first time in his 17th attempt with a fuel conservation strategy along with his long-time crew chief Jeff Hammond, making his final pit stop for fuel a distant 53 laps (132 miles) from the finish. Most of the other cars could run no more than 45 or 46 laps on a tank of fuel, so that meant Waltrip would need to feather the throttle and draft off other cars in order to save enough fuel to make it to the finish without an additional pit stop. Hammond, interviewed by television pit reporters during the final laps of the race, said that his strategy was for Waltrip to &quot;draft off anybody, and everybody&quot;, to save fuel. Even though Waltrip&#x27;s car ran much slower than other cars in the last 53 laps, he was able to avoid making the additional pit stop for fuel that the other cars had to make. The strategy provided Waltrip with the track position needed to win the race. His post-race interview with CBS pit reporter Mike Joy, became famous, with Waltrip shouting &quot;I won the Daytona 500! I won the Daytona 500! Wait, this is the Daytona 500 ain&#x27;t it? ...Thank God!&quot;, accompanied by the &quot;Ickey Shuffle&quot; dance in Victory Lane. Later, after the Daytona 500 win, Waltrip visited president George H. W. Bush at the white House in Washington, D.C.

Waltrip&#x27;s popularity as a driver would come full circle on the evening of The Winston, an all-star racing event held May 21, 1989, (an event that did not award points toward the NASCAR national championship), at Charlotte Motor Speedway. With two laps to go, Waltrip was leading the race and poised to win when Rusty Wallace hit his car exiting the 4th turn, sending him into the infield and costing him the victory and the $200,000 purse. Not only was Waltrip and his crew upset at being knocked out of the victory, the 150,000 fans watching the race issued boos to Wallace, the winner. The two crews scuffled in the pits and harsh words were said after the race. Waltrip was quoted after the race as saying &quot;I hope he chokes on it&quot;, referring to the $200,000 that Wallace collected for the victory. Waltrip&#x27;s car was clearly superior to that of Wallace and, had it not been for the contact initiated by Wallace on the final lap, Waltrip would have won the all-star event. During the 1989, and 1990 seasons, Waltrip was voted NASCAR&#x27;s Most Popular Driver by fans.

Waltrip would win six races in 1989, his best year with Hendrick Motorsports, and helped develop NASCAR&#x27;s version of the new Chevrolet Lumina in 1989, and delivered its first victory by winning a historic and unprecedented fifth Coca-Cola 600 that May. Besides establishing a race record for victories, the win prepared him for a chance to win the one remaining &quot;major race&quot; which had eluded him since his first race at the Heinz Southern 500 at Darlington. A Darlington victory would award him a one million dollar bonus for winning three of the sport&#x27;s four majors in the same season, the Daytona 500, the Winston 500, Coca-Cola 600, and the Mountain Dew Southern 500. The pressure of both the million dollar bonus and Career Grand Slam adversely affected Waltrip. He made contact with the wall early in the 1989 Southern 500 and was never a contender for winning the race, and the million dollar bonus.

For many reasons, Waltrip was unable to carry his success of the previous year into 1990. Waltrip failed to visit victory lane all season although he finished 2nd in a controversial finish in the season&#x27;s 7th race, the First Union 400, at North Wilkesboro Speedway. Brett Bodine had led 63 laps in the middle of the race and then re-took the lead on lap 318 after short pitting on a round of green flag pit stops. When the caution came out on lap 321, the pace car mistakenly picked up Dale Earnhardt as the race leader, putting Brett almost a full lap in front of the entire field. During the ensuing confusion of a 17 lap caution flag (NASCAR did not have electronic scoring at the time) Bodine was able to make a pit stop for fresh tires without losing any positions. When NASCAR reset the lineup with Bodine as the leader, he led the final 83 laps of the race (a race-high 146 laps overall) to take the victory.  

&quot;We messed up,&quot; said Chip Williams, NASCAR&#x27;s public relations director. &quot;By throwing the caution on the second-place car, it kept Bodine in the lead. He slipped into the pits and came out without losing the lead because the pace car was keeping the second-place car back. We messed up by picking up the wrong car. It was a judgment call.&quot; Waltrip filed a protest post-race, only to be denied on the grounds that judgment calls were not subject to protest/appeal. 1990 was the first year since 1974, that Waltrip did not win a race and Waltrip still remains irked to this very day over the result. Waltrip only visited victory lane five more times and never won again after 1992.

While practicing for his 500th career NASCAR start in the Pepsi 400, at Daytona, Waltrip&#x27;s car spun in oil laid down by another car experiencing engine failure, and was hit by an oncoming car driven by Dave Marcis. Waltrip suffered a broken arm, a broken leg, and a concussion. He missed the Pepsi 400, but came back to run one lap at Pocono, before giving way to Jimmy Horton as a relief driver. (A driver who starts, and completes one lap, is credited the NASCAR points regardless of who is driving the car at the finish). Despite missing the next five races due to his injuries, Waltrip finished 20th in driver points and the team finished 5th in owner points with substitute drivers taking turns in the car. 

===Owner-driver years: 1991–mid-1998===

After his fourth season as a driver for Hendrick Motorsports, Waltrip formed his own team to field cars in the 1991 NASCAR Winston Cup Series (Winston Cup) season. Driving his own cars had been his passion since he successfully drove his own cars in his early NASCAR career in the early and mid-1970s. He would continue his relationship with Chevrolet and drive a Chevrolet Lumina with Western Auto as the primary team sponsor. Waltrip purchased team assets, including the racing facilities, from his former owner Rick Hendrick in Charlotte, North Carolina, and hired long-time friend and crew chief, Jeff Hammond, to oversee the building of race cars and to continue as crew chief. Waltrip and Hammond enjoyed much success together as Hammond had been with Waltrip during the championship-winning years with Junior Johnson, and most of the Hendrick Motorsports years, and was Waltrip&#x27;s crew chief for his 1989 Daytona 500 win and 3 of his 5 Coca-Cola 600 wins.

In the 1991 season, Waltrip visited victory lane twice, his first win in his second stint as owner-driver coming in only the 7th race of the season on April 21, 1991, in the First Union 400, at North Wilkesboro Speedway in North Wilkesboro, North Carolina. His second win of the year came in the 13th race of the season on June 16, 1991, in the Champion Spark Plug 500, at Pocono Raceway, in Long Pond, Pennsylvania.

Just two races after celebrating his second win of 1991, Waltrip would again be involved in another serious crash, again at the Daytona International Speedway, in Daytona Beach, Florida. It came after completing the 119th of 160 laps on the 2.5-mile superspeedway. Waltrip and driver Alan Kulwicki were racing side by side, leading a large grouping of cars, battling for 5th position. The car drafting Alan Kulwicki bumped the Kulwicki car, causing his car to hit Waltrip&#x27;s Western Auto Chevrolet at speeds approaching 200 mph on the long backstretch. Waltrip&#x27;s car slowed and was collected by driver Joe Ruttman&#x27;s car, both cars sliding sideways several hundred feet on the grassy infield. The tires of Waltrip&#x27;s car clipped the edge of an access road causing it to become airborne and tumbling end over end several times before coming to a stop, upside-down, in a grassy area near turn 3. Waltrip was extricated and only suffered minor injuries but many feared that he could have re-injured his shattered leg from the crash at the same track the previous year. (Slow-motion video and still photography showed that Waltrip&#x27;s left arm was outside the car as the car tumbled, and came to rest.) Waltrip still had a plate in his left leg from the compound fractures he suffered in the earlier crash at the Pepsi 400, at the Daytona International Speedway, (Waltrip commented on January 10, 2013, SPEED Television broadcast of the Daytona NASCAR winter testing, that he had spent more time in the hospital from injuries suffered at the Daytona Speedway, than at any other track he had raced). Waltrip would compete in the following race, the summer race at the Pocono Raceway, in Long Pond, Pennsylvania, but was crashed again when driver Ernie Irvan spun driver Hut Stricklin, in front of almost the entire field. Waltrip won the year&#x27;s spring race at the track just 5 weeks before.

Waltrip finished the first year of his second stint as owner-driver 8th in the overall Winston Cup points championship, after being as high as 3rd place after 14 races. His first year was generally viewed as a successful first year outing. However, Waltrip was now 44 years old, had children, and had many pressures as owner/driver that he did not concern himself with driving for multimillion-dollar, highly financed race teams, such as Hendrick Motorsports.

In 1992, Waltrip collected three more wins, including the Mountain Dew Southern 500, a race held at Darlington Raceway in Darlington, South Carolina, United States, September 6, 1992, (the last major race which had eluded his 20-year career), and finished 9th in points, after being as high as 6th after 22 races. That would be Waltrip&#x27;s 84th, and final NASCAR career victory, tying him with Bobby Allison for what was then third on the all-time list, behind Richard Petty, with 200 wins, and David Pearson, with 105 wins. Both he and Allison have since been passed by Jeff Gordon, who has 93 wins by the time he retired at the end of the 2015 season.

In 1993, Waltrip signed former Richard Childress Racing engine builder Lou LaRosa, to build engines, and Barry Dodson, a former championship-winning crew chief. He posted four top-ten finishes but did not finish higher than third. 1994 saw him make his final appearance in the top ten in championship points by finishing 9th. He had a then-unprecedented streak over two seasons, of 40 races, without a DNF, all with in-house engines. His only engine failure in the season was after the car crossed the finish line. Waltrip finished 19th in points in 1995 when he crashed at The Winston and was forced to let relief drivers take over for several weeks. His second half of the season was highlighted by his final career pole position at the NAPA 500.

In 1996, Waltrip posted two top-ten finishes. Western Auto remained the sponsor as part of Waltrip&#x27;s 25th-anniversary celebration. While the year was one of Waltrip&#x27;s most profitable, his results continued to fall off.

At the 1997 UAW-GM Quality 500, Waltrip failed to qualify for the first time in over 20 years as Terry Labonte also failed to make the race. Because Labonte was a more recent Cup champion (in fact, he was the defending Cup champion that season), he was able to take the past champion&#x27;s provisional. Waltrip, who was 20th in owner points, was too low in the owner points position to make the race (only the top four in owner points of cars not in the field, excluding the most recent former champion not in the field, were added after qualifying under 1997 rules). After the season, Waltrip and his team were struggling to find sponsors but were able to put together a last-minute deal with the Ohio-based company Speedblock for 1998. Speedblock only paid portions of what was promised, and the deal was canceled. Waltrip&#x27;s team at this point was nearly insolvent, and he sold the team to Tim Beverly. Waltrip&#x27;s final race as an owner-driver was at the TranSouth Financial 400, and was originally post-drive a sponsorless car, but instead decided to drive a &quot;Tim Flock Special&quot; as the former 2-time Grand National Series champion was fighting liver and throat cancer and was without medical insurance, and Waltrip wanted to help raise money for Flock and his family by having a trust fund with NASCAR&#x27;s 50th Anniversary. Flock died at age 73 just nine days after the race. In 2008, Waltrip admitted the reason that he failed as a driver-owner team was because he thought like a driver, not as an owner.

===1998 mid season with DEI===

Beverly chose not to race the team immediately, instead choosing to rebuild the team (now part of Tyler Jet Motorsports after two sales and a merger). During this time, Waltrip signed with Dale Earnhardt, Inc. to drive the No. 1 Pennzoil Chevy, filling in for injured rookie Steve Park. During his tenure with DEI, Waltrip posted a fifth-place finish at the California 500, and led in the final stages of the Pocono 500, and finished sixth.

===Final years of racing: 1998–2000===

At the 1998 Brickyard 400, Beverly returned Waltrip&#x27;s former team, now as the No. 35 Tyler Jet Motorsports Chevrolet Monte Carlo with Tabasco sponsorship with Waltrip driving. A sponsorship conflict with Tabasco would switch the team to the Pontiac Grand Prix. Waltrip resigned at the end of the season, citing performance issues. After a brief flirtation with retirement, Waltrip signed to drive the No. 66 Big K Ford Taurus for Haas-Carter Motorsports, with teammate Jimmy Spencer. Waltrip failed to qualify seven times during that season with a new qualifying rule for the Past Champion&#x27;s Provisional. On August 5, 1999, Waltrip announced during the practice session for the Brickyard 400 that he would retire from NASCAR at the end of the 2000 season following a farewell tour.

During his retirement year of 2000, Waltrip&#x27;s best run came at the Brickyard 400, where he qualified on the outside pole and finished eleventh. His final race came on November 20, 2000, in the NAPA 500, at Atlanta Motor Speedway, where he posted a 34th-place finish in the Haas-Carter Motorsports owned No. 66 Route 66 Big K Ford Taurus. He finished 36th in points that season and failed to qualify six times.

==Craftsman Truck Series==

In 1995, Waltrip built a Craftsman Truck Series team, and found success by 1997, when Rich Bickle finished second in overall season standings, winning three races, and made Waltrip one of the few car owners to have won races in NASCAR&#x27;s three national series. When Sears ceased sponsorship of the team in 1997, Waltrip suspended his truck team, not returning until 2004, when he re-entered the series as an owner and part of Toyota NASCAR development program.

==Broadcast career: 2001–2019==
Prior to retiring from racing, Waltrip provided commentary on several IROC broadcasts for ABC. Also, from 1994 to 1998, on weekends that Winston Cup was not competing, had provided commentary on many NASCAR Busch Series (one level below Winston Cup) races broadcasts on TNN, teaming with Mike Joy. In 2001, after his final 2000 season as a NASCAR driver, Waltrip signed with Fox, to be lead NASCAR Winston Cup Series (Winston Cup) analyst and race commentator on the network&#x27;s NASCAR telecasts, teaming with Mike Joy and Larry McReynolds.

===Inaugural broadcasts and safety advocate===
Waltrip began his career with Fox at the 2001 Daytona 500. His younger brother, Michael Waltrip, won the race, but Michael&#x27;s victory was overshadowed by the death of Dale Earnhardt. On the final scheduled lap, Earnhardt&#x27;s car made contact with Sterling Marlin, as the black No. 3 drifted low on the track, probably attempting a blocking maneuver so that either Michael Waltrip or Dale Earnhardt Jr.driving for Dale Sr.&#x27;s DEI, although he himself drove for RCRwould win the race. After contacting the Marlin car, Earnhardt&#x27;s car suddenly veered right and slammed hard head-on into the retaining wall in turn four. Earnhardt&#x27;s car came to rest in the infield as Michael Waltrip won the race, with Darrell Waltrip shouting for joy as he called the final run to the checkered flag. His joy at his brother&#x27;s victory soon gave way to concern for Earnhardt as he watched replays of the crash.

Waltrip and Earnhardt had been bitter rivals on the track in the 1980s but as the years passed, the rivalry and bitterness had given way to a deep respect and close friendship. After the race, Waltrip was taken from the Fox Broadcast booth to the Halifax Medical Center to meet with the Earnhardt family and his brother Michael. Waltrip later gave the invocation at the Earnhardt funeral. and gave the invocation at the following week&#x27;s race praying for Earnhardt and the promise of moving on from the tragedy.

At the following week&#x27;s race, Waltrip interviewed NASCAR President Mike Helton for a pre-race segment during the broadcast. This was before NASCAR mandated the use of the HANS device to reduce the risk of catastrophic head and neck injuries, and the &quot;SAFER&quot; (Steel and Foam Energy Reduction) barriers used at all NASCAR tracks today. Waltrip believed that four deaths in the previous ten months, all caused by basilar skull fractures incurred in accidents, were too many, and was not shy about asking Helton for an explanation. Helton&#x27;s responses irritated Waltrip, who was noted by one magazine for &quot;acting a lot more like the next Mike Wallace (of &quot;60 Minutes&quot;) than the next John Madden&quot;. Waltrip delivered the pre-race invocation for the race in honor of Earnhardt.

As a long-time advocate for motorsports safety, Waltrip then pushed for mandatory head-and-neck restraints, and two weeks later, demonstrated the device during the broadcast at Atlanta Motor Speedway, explaining the benefits and how the device worked. Seven months later, NASCAR mandated the devices after a crash during an ARCA Re/Max Series race, held after qualifying for the UAW-GM Quality 500, killed driver Blaise Alexander.

===Broadcast style===
As the cars take the green flag to start each race, Waltrip shouts &quot;Boogity, boogity, boogity, let&#x27;s go racing boys and girls!&quot; This somewhat nonsensical phrase has become Waltrip&#x27;s trademark in recent years. (The phrase &quot;boogity, boogity, boogity&quot; also appears in the 1960 doo wop parody &quot;Who Put the Bomp (in the Bomp, Bomp, Bomp)&quot; by Barry Mann.) Humble Pie used the shorter phrase &quot;boogity-boogity&quot; in their 1970 song &quot;Red Light Mama, Red Hot&quot;. Ray Stevens used the phrase throughout his 1974 hit, &quot;The Streak&quot;. Jerry Reed also said this phrase in the 1977 movie &quot;Smokey and the Bandit.&quot; Waltrip was featured on a 1992 home video from Ray Stevens entitled the &quot;Amazing Rolling Revue&quot;. In this home video Waltrip played the part of the out of control driver of the tour bus/rolling venue. Waltrip explained that the catchphrase arose because, as a driver, he grew tired of hearing his spotter or crew chief say &quot;green, green, green&quot; at the start of every race and wanted to hear something more original. The catchphrase had always been preceded by fellow analyst and former crew chief Larry McReynolds telling Waltrip to &quot;reach up there and pull those belts tight one more time!&quot; until recent years, when McReynolds used the phrase less and less and eventually phased it out altogether.

In 2011, Waltrip stated that his favorite race to have broadcast thus far was the 2010 Aaron&#x27;s 499. The race lead was exchanged many times among many different drivers rather than the lead being dominated by a single driver. The race ended with driver Kevin Harvick beating driver Jamie McMurray for the win by only the length of a bumper.

Waltrip also lends his unique verbiage to his commentary, speaking of &quot;coop-petetion&quot; when racers work together, but keep each other under a watchful eye, &quot;s&#x27;perince&quot; when talking about driving skills of a veteran driver, and &quot;using the chrome horn&quot;, when a driver somewhat purposefully bumps a car that&#x27;s in the way (bumpers on cars used to be made of metal and coated in chrome). In early 2007, Waltrip was nominated for an Emmy in the category &quot;Outstanding Event Analyst&quot;.

In March 2011, FOX awarded Waltrip a 2-year contract extension, taking him through 2014, the same year the network&#x27;s NASCAR contract ends (although the broadcast contract has been extended to 2024).

In October 2011, Waltrip, Joy, Calvin Fish and Australian Leigh Diffey traveled to Australia to host Speed&#x27;s coverage of the Supercheap Auto Bathurst 1000 race held at the famous Mount Panorama Circuit. Since Waltrip had not hosted in Australia before, he counted on Australian NASCAR driver Marcos Ambrose to help him learn about the country. During the trip, in regards to hosting, Waltrip and Joy are most famous for helping Ambrose reconcile with a former Bathurst rival Greg Murphy, known for an infamous Lap 145 dustup at the 2005 event following a restart that led to a famous squabble. The interview took place during a safety car session after Murphy had exited the car during a driver change. In the days leading up to the race, Waltrip was taken on a few laps of the track by Supercars Championship driver Jason Bright in Bright&#x27;s Brad Jones Racing Holden VE Commodore, describing the 6.213 km (3.861 mi) long mountain circuit as a &quot;Geological oddity&quot;.

Waltrip announced his retirement from broadcasting on April 4, 2019, at Bristol Motor Speedway citing his desire to spend more time with his wife and grandchildren. His final race in the broadcast booth was the 2019 Toyota/Save Mart 350 at Sonoma Raceway. He has also announced the 2022 Food City Dirt Race.

==Post-Cup Series retirement==
Waltrip fielded a Toyota sponsored by Japanese industrial giant NTN for his Craftsman Truck Series team in 2004. David Reutimann drove the truck for the team and earned Rookie of the Year honors that year. Waltrip&#x27;s team expanded to two trucks in 2005. In August 2005, the revived Darrell Waltrip Motorsports won its first race, the Toyota Tundra 200 at Nashville Superspeedway with Reutimann driving. During the 2007 season, A.J. Allmendinger drove the No. 00 Red Bull Toyota but with minimal success. By years end the team was sold to The Racer&#x27;s Group, a road racing operation.

Waltrip has made occasional starts (three or less each year) in the Craftsman Truck Series and Busch Series since his &quot;retirement&quot; in 2000. Each of these races have been either at Martinsville Speedway or Indianapolis Raceway Park.

Waltrip was the honorary starter at the 2007 Food City 500 and was also the honorary starter for the 2008 Gatorade Duel as Gatorade was one of Waltrip&#x27;s former sponsors. He also started/completed a Busch Series race at Martinsville in his brother&#x27;s &quot;Aaron&#x27;s Dream Machine&quot; after appearing in ads in 2003–2005 begging his brother to let him drive the Aaron&#x27;s Dream Machine.

In 2009, he appeared in commercials for Rejuvenate Auto with his No. 11 Mountain Dew Chevrolet. Waltrip also appeared in Fox public service announcements for breast cancer awareness.

In 2010 and 2011, Waltrip voiced his support for saving the old Nashville Fairgrounds Speedway, now known as simply the Fairgrounds Speedway, in Nashville. The speedway was first opened in 1904, and hosted a weekly racing series for decades. It is the track where Waltrip first had success at weekly racing events in the 1960s and 70s, winning two track championships and where his first NASCAR victory came May 10, 1975. The speedway and adjacent Tennessee State Fairgrounds is located in an urban area of south Nashville, roughly from its downtown business district. Some residents living close to the speedway have complained of noise and many local politicians have proposed closing the speedway and developing the property.

Waltrip retired as a race commentator for Fox at the end of the 2019 racing season. In March 2011, FOX announced that Waltrip would continue as their lead NASCAR analyst and race commentator through 2014. In May 2015, FOX announced that Jeff Gordon would join him and Mike Joy starting in 2016, replacing their long-time broadcast partner Larry McReynolds.

In 2017, Waltrip announced on his Twitter page that he had undergone a knee replacement from an injury that occurred during the 1991 Pepsi 400. This was also mentioned in his Facebook account.

Waltrip currently owns Honda, Volvo, Subaru, and Buick/GMC automobile dealerships in Franklin, Tennessee, in partnership with his former team owner Rick Hendrick.

==Legacy==
Waltrip is considered by most in the racing community as a true ambassador to the sport of motor racing. He is a passionate promoter of all forms of racing, especially American stock car auto racing.

Waltrip is recognized by many who closely follow motorsports as NASCAR&#x27;s first &quot;total package&quot; driver. He was media savvy, articulate, attractive and possessed the driving skills that would take him to the pinnacle of the sport. His style attracted big-budget sponsors that are necessary to fund the multimillion-dollar NASCAR teams. Today, it is customary for the team&#x27;s sponsor to have considerable input into who the team&#x27;s driver will be that represents their brand or product on the track. Today&#x27;s NASCAR driver fits the mold that Waltrip first ushered into NASCAR in the 1970s.

As a Fox Sports analyst and broadcaster, Waltrip&#x27;s opinions, views and comments carry considerable weight with drivers, team owners, fans and NASCAR heads. Waltrip has never been shy about expressing his views, even if controversial.

Waltrip has been a design consultant on some of the newer tracks including the Kentucky Motor Speedway, and the Nashville Superspeedway.

Waltrip has a building which holds many of the race cars he drove throughout his career.

He was inducted into the Motorsports Hall of Fame of America in 2003.

On June 14, 2011, he was selected to the NASCAR Hall of Fame Class of 2012.

Waltrip officially won 84 NASCAR cup races, but yet another, additional, and uncounted &quot;win&quot; was as relief driver for Donnie Allison, at the 1977 Talladega 500. (Allison received credit for the win because he was driving the car when the race started). In that race, Waltrip retired after 106, of 188, laps. Allison sought a relief driver for his No. 1 Hawaiian Tropic sponsored Chevrolet, due to the excess heat of the day, and Waltrip was asked to complete the race in Allison&#x27;s car. The irony was that Waltrip replaced Allison at the DiGard No. 88 race team just two years previously, which was part of the long lore of the &quot;Allisons vs Waltrip&quot; battle that lasted for more than 16 years.

His 84 wins in the Cup series place him 5th in NASCAR history, one win behind Bobby Allison. In 2011, Jeff Gordon scored his 85th career victory surpassing Waltrip for most wins in the &quot;modern era&quot; of NASCAR. (NASCAR&#x27;s &quot;modern era&quot; takes into account current scheduling, and the elimination of dirt tracks from scoring statistics; several of Allison&#x27;s wins came before the start of the &quot;modern era&quot;).

==Media appearances==

===Film and television===
Waltrip&#x27;s entertainment appearances were influenced by his early 1970s work with Ralph Emery in Nashville radio and television, and that led to his work as a fill-in for Emery.

In the 1980s and 1990s, he would substitute for Emery on The Nashville Network&#x27;s &quot;Nashville Now&quot; and later hosted himself the network&#x27;s two successor variety shows, &quot;Music City Tonight&quot; and &quot;Prime Time Country&quot;.

Waltrip worked on &quot;Days of Thunder&quot; as Hendrick Motorsports was a major provider of cars and drivers (he helped hire Bobby Hamilton for the project), and one of his injury substitutes was lead stunt driver Greg Sacks.

Waltrip has twice been a presenter at the &quot;GMA (Gospel Music Association) Music Awards&quot;, partnering with Kathy Troccoli both times. In 1999, they presented the &quot;Song of the Year&quot; award to Mitch McVicker and Rich Mullins for &quot;My Deliverer&quot;. Rich Mullins and Mitch McVicker were thrown from their truck after not wearing seat belts, and Mullins was killed in the accident.

In 2006, Waltrip and Nicole C. Mullen hosted a DirecTV special, &quot;Songs of Faith&quot;. He provided the voice of Darrell Cartrip, an anthropomorphic car version of himself in all 3 movies of Pixar&#x27;s &quot;Cars&quot; franchise. He also appeared in the broadcast booth in the films &quot;Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby&quot;, where his phrase was &quot;You know, Larry, there&#x27;s good days in racing and there&#x27;s bad days, Ricky Bobby just had himself a bad day&quot;. On December 15, 2006, Waltrip played the role of Mother Ginger in the Nashville Ballet&#x27;s production of &quot;The Nutcracker&quot;.

He appeared in advertisements for Toyota and Aaron&#x27;s alongside his brother, Michael, where his gimmick was constantly asking Michael&#x27;s permission to drive the Aaron&#x27;s Dream Machine (a nickname for the No. 99 Nationwide Series car). Waltrip has also made a number of appearances in &quot;comedic&quot; segments appearing during his actual Fox broadcasts.

He was featured in two NASCAR Series videos &quot;Darrell Waltrip: Quicksilver&quot; which explained Waltrip&#x27;s career and future and he appeared in the NASCAR Video series where he teaches helpful driving tips for driving on the freeway and long-distance drives.

In February, 2011, Waltrip appeared in &quot;The Day&quot; which was a one-hour documentary about the tragic death of Dale Earnhardt at the 2001 Daytona 500.

Waltrip initially believed accidents would happen to him. He was featured in a video testimonial on IamSecond.com talking about his Christian faith in Jesus Christ in which he discussed the meaninglessness of the rest of his career, compared to that relationship.

Waltrip, along with fellow commentators Mike Joy and Jeff Gordon, made a cameo appearance as themselves in the 2017 heist comedy film &quot;Logan Lucky&quot;.

===Books and magazines===
Waltrip has also been successful in the publishing field. In September 1994, he was featured as the cover story in &quot;Guideposts&quot;.

His autobiography, &quot;DW: A Lifetime Going Around in Circles&quot;, was a New York Times best-seller when it was released around the 2004 Daytona 500. The book was co-written with Jade Gurss.

In May 2004, Waltrip became the second sports figure to be featured in former NBA player and basketball coach Jay Carty&#x27;s One-on-One series of devotional books. &quot;Darrell Waltrip One-on-One: The Faith that Took Him to the Finish Line&quot; is a sixty-day devotional book featuring Waltrip&#x27;s stories and how they can relate to Christian faith, and Carty&#x27;s devotionals.

<text>Raghu () is a ruler of the Suryavansha dynasty in Hinduism. According to the &quot;Raghuvamsha&quot;, he is the son of King Dilīpa and Queen Sudakshina. His successors styled themselves as belonging to the eponymous Raghuvamsha dynasty, or the &quot;Raghukula,&quot; after him. The history of his dynasty is elaborated upon by the poet Kalidasa in his &quot;Raghuvamsha&quot;. He is the great-grandfather of Rama, an avatar of Vishnu.

== Legend ==

=== Raghuvamsha ===
The life and glories of Raghu are described in the poem Raghuvamsha, written by Kalidasa. In the third canto, his birth, education, and marriage are described. He participates in the hundredth ashvamedha sacrifice of his father, fighting Indra, who steals the sacrificial horse. His victory against the deity is followed by his ascension to the throne, after Dilipa retires to the forest. In the fourth canto, Raghu expands his domains, subjugating the kings of Vanga, Utkala, Kalinga, the Pandya king, Huns, Persians, and Pragjyotisha.

On the instruction of his guru, Vashistha, he performs the Viśvajit yajna, giving away all his wealth as dāna. After being impoverished, Sage Kautsa, a disciple of Vartantu, comes to Raghu, seeking 14 koti (million) gold coins as a gurudakshina. Expressing his inability to offer the sum, Raghu plans to plunder Kubera&#x27;s treasury for wealth. When the deity catches wind of this, he willingly fills the king&#x27;s coffers with a rain of gold coins, which Raghu promptly offers to Kautsa. Pleased, the sage blesses Raghu to bear a son, and soon, Aja is born. After he comes of age, Raghu sends his son to attend the svayamvara of Princess Indumati of Vidharba, whom he successfully weds. The story of Raghu ends in the eighth canto, where he retires to the forest after nominating Aja as the king.

==Lineage==
A number of Puranas, which include the Vishnu Purana, the Vayu Purana, the Linga Purana, mention Dirghabahu as the son of Dilīpa and Raghu as the son of Dirghabahu. But the Harivamsha, the Brahma Purana and the Shiva Purana mention Raghu as son of Dilīpa and Dirghavahu as his epithet.

<doc id="372347" wikidata="Q1040924" url="?curid=372347" title="Jacksonian democracy">
<text>Jacksonian democracy was a 19th-century political philosophy in the United States that restructured a number of federal institutions. Originating with the seventh U.S. president, Andrew Jackson and his supporters, it became the nation&#x27;s dominant political worldview for a generation. The term itself was in active use by the 1830s.

This era, called the Jacksonian Era or Second Party System by historians and political scientists, lasted roughly from Jackson&#x27;s 1828 presidential election until the practice of slavery became the dominant issue with the passage of the Kansas–Nebraska Act in 1854 and the political repercussions of the American Civil War dramatically reshaped American politics. It emerged when the long-dominant Democratic-Republican Party became factionalized around the 1824 presidential election. Jackson&#x27;s supporters began to form the modern Democratic Party. His political rivals John Quincy Adams and Henry Clay created the National Republican Party, which would afterward combine with other anti-Jackson political groups to form the Whig Party.

Broadly speaking, the era was characterized by a democratic spirit. It built upon Jackson&#x27;s equal political policy, subsequent to ending what he termed a monopoly of government by elites. Even before the Jacksonian era began, suffrage had been extended to a majority of white male adult citizens, a result which the Jacksonians celebrated. Jacksonian democracy also promoted the strength of the presidency and the executive branch at the expense of Congress, while also seeking to broaden the public&#x27;s participation in government. The Jacksonians demanded elected, not appointed, judges and rewrote many state constitutions to reflect the new values. In national terms, they favored geographical expansionism, justifying it in terms of manifest destiny. 

Jackson&#x27;s expansion of democracy was exclusively limited to White men, as well as voting rights in the nation were extended to adult white males only, and &quot;it is a myth that most obstacles to the suffrage were removed only after the emergence of Andrew Jackson and his party. Well before Jackson&#x27;s election most states had lifted most restrictions on the suffrage or white male citizens or taxpayers.&quot; There was also little to no improvement, and in many cases a reduction of the rights of non-white U.S citizens, during the extensive period of Jacksonian democracy, spanning from 1829 to 1860.

== Etymology ==
In its earliest usage, the phrase &quot;Jacksonian democracy&quot; had a narrower meaning referring to the Democratic Party, particularly as led by Andrew Jackson, who was president of the United States from 1829 to 1837. American historian James Schouler called Jackson&#x27;s political alliance &quot;the Jackson Democracy&quot; in his 1889 &quot;History of the United States Under the Constitution&quot;, and in 1890 future president Theodore Roosevelt called the antebellum Democratic Party &quot;the Jacksonian Democracy&quot;. Later historians, including Frederick Jackson Turner and William MacDonald, generalized the phrase &quot;Jacksonian democracy&quot; to describe democracy writ large in the United States and what they saw as the influence of the American frontier on the character of American political culture. In the 1945 book &quot;The Age of Jackson&quot;, Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr. influentially reinterpreted &quot;Jacksonian Democracy&quot; as a phenomenon of labor struggle against business power rather than of frontier regional influence.

==Philosophy==

===General principles===
Historian Robert V. Remini, in 1999, stated that Jacksonian Democracy involved the belief that the people are sovereign, that their will is absolute and that the majority rules.

William S. Belko, in 2015, summarized &quot;the core concepts underlying Jacksonian Democracy&quot; as:
Historian and social critic Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr. argued in 1945 that Jacksonian democracy was built on the following:

* Expanded suffrage – The Jacksonians believed that voting rights should be extended to all white men. By the end of the 1820s, attitudes and state laws had shifted in favor of universal white male suffrage and by 1856 all requirements to own property and nearly all requirements to pay taxes had been dropped.
* Manifest destiny – This was the belief that Americans had a destiny to settle the American West and to expand control from the Atlantic Ocean to the Pacific, and that the West should be settled by yeoman farmers. However, the Free Soil movement, originally a offshoot of Jacksonianism, argued for limitations on slavery in the new areas to enable the poor white man to flourish — they split with the main party briefly in 1848 when nominated former President Martin Van Buren . The Whigs generally opposed Manifest Destiny and expansion, saying the nation should build up its cities.
* Patronage – Also known as the spoils system, patronage was the policy of placing political supporters into appointed offices. Many Jacksonians held the view that rotating political appointees in and out of office was not only the right, but also the duty of winners in political contests. Patronage was theorized to be good because it would encourage political participation by the common man and because it would make a politician more accountable for poor government service by his appointees. Jacksonians also held that long tenure in the civil service was corrupting, so civil servants should be rotated out of office at regular intervals. However, patronage often led to the hiring of incompetent and sometimes corrupt officials due to the emphasis on party loyalty above any other qualifications.
* Strict constructionism – Like the Jeffersonians who strongly believed in the Kentucky and Virginia Resolutions, Jacksonians initially favored a federal government of limited powers. Jackson said that he would guard against &quot;all encroachments upon the legitimate sphere of State sovereignty&quot;. However, he was not a states&#x27; rights extremist—indeed, the nullification crisis would find Jackson fighting against what he perceived as state encroachments on the proper sphere of federal influence. This position was one basis for the Jacksonians&#x27; opposition to the Second Bank of the United States. As the Jacksonians consolidated power, they more often advocated expanding federal power, presidential power in particular.
* &quot;Laissez-faire&quot; – Complementing a strict construction of the Constitution, the Jacksonians generally favored a hands-off approach to the economy as opposed to the Whig program sponsoring modernization, railroads, banking, and economic growth. The chief spokesman amongst &quot;laissez-faire&quot; advocates was William Leggett of the Locofocos in New York City. Jackson &quot;placed most of the American economy off limits to government regulation. Only paper money bankers faced whatever (slim) interference his bias against governmental regulation allowed. No inequality of wages, prices, profits, inheritanceof the basic structure of American capitalismhad to fear Jackson&#x27;s egalitarian scorn.&quot;
* Opposition to banking – In particular, the Jacksonians opposed government-granted monopolies to banks, especially the national bank, a central bank known as the Second Bank of the United States. Jackson said: &quot;The bank is trying to kill me, but I will kill it!&quot; and he did so. The Whigs, who strongly supported the Bank, were led by Henry Clay, Daniel Webster, and Nicholas Biddle, the bank chairman. Jackson himself was opposed to all banks because he believed they were devices to cheat common people&quot;—&quot;he and many followers believed that only gold and silver should be used to back currency, rather than the integrity of a bank.

===Election by the &quot;common man&quot;===

An important movement in the period from 1800 to 1830the era immediately before the election of Jacksonwas the gradual expansion of the right to vote from only property owning men to include all white men over 21. Older states with property restrictions dropped them, namely all but Rhode Island, Virginia, and North Carolina by the mid-1820s. No new states had property qualifications although three had adopted tax-paying qualifications—Ohio, Louisiana, and Mississippi, of which only in Louisiana were these significant and long lasting. The process was peaceful and widely supported, except in the state of Rhode Island. In Rhode Island, the Dorr Rebellion of the 1840s demonstrated that the demand for equal suffrage was broad and strong, although the subsequent reform included a significant property requirement for any resident born outside of the United States. However, free black men lost voting rights in several states during this period.

The fact that any man was now legally allowed to vote did not necessarily mean he routinely voted. He had to be pulled to the polls, which became the most important role of the local parties. They systematically sought out potential voters and brought them to the polls. Voter turnout soared during the 1830s, reaching about 80% of adult white male population in the 1840 presidential election. Tax-paying qualifications remained in only five states by 1860—Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Pennsylvania, Delaware and North Carolina.

One innovative strategy for increasing voter participation and input was developed outside the Jacksonian camp. Prior to the presidential election of 1832, the Anti-Masonic Party conducted the nation&#x27;s first presidential nominating convention. Held in Baltimore, Maryland, September 26–28, 1831, it transformed the process by which political parties select their presidential and vice-presidential candidates.

===Factions===
The period from 1824 to 1832 was politically chaotic. The Federalist Party and the First Party System were dead and with no effective opposition, the old Democratic-Republican Party withered away. Every state had numerous political factions, but they did not cross state lines. Political coalitions formed and dissolved and politicians moved in and out of alliances.

More former Democratic-Republicans supported Jackson, while others such as Henry Clay opposed him. More former Federalists, such as Daniel Webster, opposed Jackson, although some like James Buchanan supported him. In 1828, John Quincy Adams pulled together a network of factions called the National Republicans, but he was defeated by Jackson. By the late 1830s, the Jacksonian Democrats and the Whigs—a fusion of the National Republicans and other anti-Jackson parties—politically battled it out nationally and in every state.

=== Red, white, and black: Race and power in the formation of Jacksonian-era political alliances ===
According to historian Daniel Walker Howe in &quot;What Hath God Wrought: The Transformation of America, 1815–1848&quot;, Jacksonianism began with allegiance to Jackson the man. (As one history put it, &quot;While the Whigs denied it, their party really had its origin in Tennessee in opposition to Jackson.&quot;) As Thomas P. Abernethy wrote in 1927, &quot;No historian has ever accused Jackson, the great Democrat, of having had a political philosophy. It is hard to see that he even had any political principles. He was a man of action, and the man of action is likely to be an opportunist.&quot; Thus, Jacksonianism began without any given roster of principles other than &quot;the extension of white supremacy across the North American continent.&quot; Jackson promoted political equality for white men, but his vision of &quot;social&quot; egalitarianism beyond that core constituency was essentially nonexistent; anyone who suggested otherwise was despised as a conniving schemer who was disrupting the natural social order for personal advantage and, surely, financial gain. 

The removal of Indians from their ancestral lands, so they could be more profitably replaced by Whites and their Black slaves in what became the Cotton Kingdom, &quot;fixed the character of his political party&quot; such that during the Second Party System &quot;voting on Indian affairs proved to be the most consistent predictor of partisan affiliation.&quot; According to political historian Joshua A. Lynn, &quot;Democrats painted the political landscape as a Boschian triptych in which fiendish abolitionists, nativists, and temperance crusaders flayed men of their autonomy, manhood, and whiteness.&quot; Per Lynn, the core principles of Jacksonism were white supremacy, the perpetuation of slavery, the ethnic cleansing of unceded Indigenous land claims within the territory of the United States, and mass politics, all guided by the worldview that &quot;white men surrendered their sovereignty in proportion to its exercise by people of color.&quot; Thus, argue some historians, the color line was &quot;the&quot; core value of the Jacksonian Democratic Party, in that whether the voters were &quot;urban workingmen, southern planters and yeomen, or frontier settlers&quot; they were unified by a &quot;racial essentialism&quot; that established whiteness as the basis for a voting bloc that might otherwise share few common interests. Thus, Jackson&#x27;s great innovation was to popularize a cultural norm wherein by &quot;superintending inequality at home...patriarchs mingled in public as equals.&quot; As historian William Freehling put it, Jackson&#x27;s beliefs &quot;took white men&#x27;s egalitarian government to its (racial) limits and far beyond the (class) limits of the Founding Fathers&#x27; aristocratic republicanism...But his constricted definition...excluded almost all of American social inequality from governmental assault. His limited banking reforms left Northern manufacturers and Southern slaveholders untouched. His racial agenda sanctioned governmental consolidation of reds&#x27; and blacks&#x27; natural inferiority...This monument to American individualism had slaughtered the Bank, crushed the nullifiers, and impeded the secessionists. But that unacknowledged monster, his unimpeded racist capitalism, would haunt egalitarians for generations.&quot;

For his part, Jackson was acutely cognizant of the pro-slavery bent of his followers and saw that as a seat of power for the party. In 1840 he wrote to his nephew and political protégé Andrew Donelson about a campaign event in Madison County, Tennessee: &quot;We had a large meeting to day. Polk and Grundy both spoke, to an attentive audience, and all things look well in this District. I have no fears of the result; the abolition question begins to draw the attention, I may say, the serious attention of the people here.&quot;

==Founding of the Democratic Party==
===Jacksonian democracy===

The spirit of Jacksonian democracy animated the party that formed around him, from the early 1830s to the 1850s, shaping the era, with the Whig Party the main opposition. The new Democratic Party became a coalition of poor farmers, city-dwelling laborers and Irish Catholics.

The new party was pulled together by Martin Van Buren in 1828 as Jackson crusaded on claims of corruption by President John Quincy Adams. The new party (which did not get the name Democrats until 1834) swept to a landslide. As Mary Beth Norton explains regarding 1828:

The platforms, speeches and editorials were founded upon a broad consensus among Democrats. As Norton et al. explain:

Jackson vetoed more legislation than all previous presidents combined. The long-term effect was to create the modern, strong presidency. Jackson and his supporters also opposed progressive reformation as a movement. Progressive reformers eager to turn their programs into legislation called for a more active government. However, Democrats tended to oppose programs like educational reform and the establishment of a public education system. For instance, they believed that public schools restricted individual liberty by interfering with parental responsibility and undermined freedom of religion by replacing church schools.

According to Francis Paul Prucha in 1969, Jackson looked at the Indian question in terms of military and legal policy, not as a problem due to their race. In 1813, Jackson adopted and treated as his own son Lyncoya Jackson, who had been orphaned by Jackson&#x27;s orders to John Coffee at the Battle of Tallusahatchee during the Creek War—seeing in him a fellow orphan that was &quot;so much like myself I feel an unusual sympathy for him&quot;. Lyncoya was one of three indigenous members of Andrew Jackson&#x27;s household. Lyncoya&#x27;s biography was used as a defense against charges that Jackson&#x27;s Indian policies were inhumane as early as 1815, continuing and accelerating through the 1824 and 1828 presidential elections. Lyncoya died of tuberculosis during the course of the 1828 campaign, allowing his obituary to serve as a platform for such messages.

In legal terms, when it became a matter of state sovereignty versus tribal sovereignty he went with the states and forced the Indians to fresh lands with no white rivals in what became known as the Trail of Tears.

Among the leading followers was Stephen A. Douglas, senator from Illinois, who was the key player in the passage of the Compromise of 1850, and was a leading contender for the 1852 Democratic presidential nomination. According to his biographer Robert W. Johanssen:

===Reforms===
Jackson fulfilled his promise of broadening the influence of the citizenry in government, although not without vehement controversy over his methods.

Jacksonian policies included ending the bank of the United States, expanding westward and removing American Indians from the Southeast. Jackson was denounced as a tyrant by opponents on both ends of the political spectrum such as Henry Clay and John C. Calhoun. This led to the rise of the Whig Party.

Jackson created a spoils system to clear out elected officials in government of an opposing party and replace them with his supporters as a reward for their electioneering. With Congress controlled by his enemies, Jackson relied heavily on the power of the veto to block their moves.
One of the most important of these was the Maysville Road veto in 1830. A part of Clay&#x27;s American System, the bill would have allowed for federal funding of a project to construct a road linking Lexington and the Ohio River, the entirety of which would be in the state of Kentucky, Clay&#x27;s home state. His primary objection was based on the local nature of the project. He argued it was not the federal government&#x27;s job to fund projects of such a local nature and/or those lacking a connection to the nation as a whole. The debates in Congress reflected two competing visions of federalism. The Jacksonians saw the union strictly as the cooperative aggregation of the individual states, while the Whigs saw the entire nation as a distinct entity.

Carl Lane argues &quot;securing national debt freedom was a core element of Jacksonian democracy&quot;. Paying off the national debt was a high priority which would make a reality of the Jeffersonian vision of America truly free from rich bankers, self-sufficient in world affairs, virtuous at home, and administered by a small government not prone to financial corruption or payoffs.

What became of Jacksonian Democracy, according to Sean Wilentz was diffusion. Many ex-Jacksonians turned their crusade against the Money Power into one against the Slave Power and became Republicans. He points to the struggle over the Wilmot Proviso of 1846, the Free Soil Party revolt of 1848, and the mass defections from the Democrats in 1854 over the Kansas–Nebraska Act. Other Jacksonian leaders such as Chief Justice Roger B. Taney endorsed slaveholding rights through the 1857 Dred Scott ruling. Southern Jacksonians overwhelmingly endorsed secession in 1861, apart from a few opponents led by Andrew Johnson. In the North, Jacksonians Martin Van Buren, Stephen A. Douglas and the War Democrats fiercely opposed secession, while Franklin Pierce, James Buchanan and the Copperheads did not.

==Jacksonian presidents==
In addition to Jackson, his second Vice President and one of the key organizational leaders of the Jacksonian Democratic Party, Martin Van Buren, handily won the election of 1836. He helped shape modern presidential campaign organizations and methods.

Van Buren was defeated in 1840 by Whig William Henry Harrison in a landslide. Harrison died just 30 days into his term and his Vice President John Tyler quickly reached accommodation with the Jacksonians. Tyler was then succeeded by James K. Polk, a Jacksonian who won the election of 1844 with Jackson&#x27;s endorsement. Franklin Pierce had been a supporter of Jackson as well. James Buchanan served in Jackson&#x27;s administration as Minister to Russia and as Polk&#x27;s Secretary of State, but he did not pursue Jacksonian policies. Finally, Andrew Johnson, who had been a strong supporter of Jackson, became president following the assassination of Abraham Lincoln in 1865, but by then Jacksonian democracy had been pushed off the stage of American politics.

== Jackson as partisan symbol ==
Jackson himself was used variously as a signifier of partisan allegiances. It was said that in Mississippi, a overwhelming Democratic state, &quot;Jackson&#x27;s word was &#x27;considered as binding as the Koran, his will a rule of actionhis name too sacred to be uttered without a blessing.&#x27;&quot;

<doc id="372349" wikidata="Q3519217" url="?curid=372349" title="Harishchandra">
<text>Harishchandra () is a legendary king of the Solar dynasty, who appears in several legends in texts such as the &quot;Aitareya Brahmana&quot;, &quot;Mahabharata&quot;, the &quot;Markandeya Purana&quot;, and the &quot;Devi Bhagavata Purana&quot;. The most famous of these stories is the one mentioned in the &quot;Markandeya Purana&quot;. According to this legend, Harishchandra gave away his kingdom, sold his family, and agreed to be a slave – all to fulfill a promise he had made to the sage Vishvamitra.

== Legend ==

=== Aitareya Brahmana ===
According to a legend mentioned in &quot;Aitareya Brahamana&quot;, Harishchandra had one hundred wives, but no son. On advice of the sage Narada, he prayed to the deity Varuna for a son. Varuna granted the boon, in exchange for an assurance that Harishchandra would make a sacrifice to Varuna in the future. As a result of this boon, a son named Rohita (or Rohitashva) was born to the king. After his birth, Varuna came to Harishchandra and demanded that the child be sacrificed to him. The king postponed the sacrifice multiple times citing various reasons, but finally agreed to it when Rohita became an adult. Rohita refused to be sacrificed and escaped to the forest. An angry Varuna afflicted Harishchandra with a stomach illness. Rohita intermittently visited his father, but on the advice of Indra, never agreed to the sacrifice. Later, Rohita managed to substitute himself with Sunahshepa in the human sacrifice. Sunahshepa prayed to the Rigvedic deities, and was saved from the sacrifice. Harishchandra&#x27;s illness was also cured because of Sunahshepa&#x27;s prayers; Sunahshepa was adopted by the sage Vishvamitra.

A similar story is narrated in the &quot;Ramayana&quot;, but the king&#x27;s name is Ambarisha instead of Harishchandra.

=== Puranic legends ===

In the Puranas, Harishchandra is the son of Trishanku. The &quot;Vishnu Purana&quot; mentions him, but does not describe his life in detail. The &quot;Markandeya Purana&quot; contains a detailed legend about his life, narrated by wise birds to the sage Jaimini. The &quot;Bhagavata Purana&quot; mentions him as the father of Sagara and grandfather of Badaka, and contains a legend about his descendants.

==== &quot;Markandeya Purana&quot; ====
The &quot;Markandeya Purana&quot; legend is as follows:

King Harishchandra lived in the Treta Yuga. He was an honest, noble king. His subjects enjoyed prosperity and peace. He had a queen named Shaivya (also called Taramati) and a son named Rohitashva. Once, while on a hunting expedition, he heard the cries of a woman asking for help. Armed with a bow and arrow, he went in the direction of the sound. The sound was an illusion created by Vighnaraja, the lord of the obstacles. Vighnaraja was trying to disturb the &quot;tapasya&quot; (meditation) of the sage Vishvamitra. When he saw Harishchandra, he entered the king&#x27;s body and started abusing Vishvamitra. This disturbed Vishwamitra&#x27;s &quot;tapasya&quot;, and destroyed all the knowledge that the sage had acquired during this &quot;tapasya&quot;.

When Harishchandra came to his senses, he realized that the sage was extremely angry with him, and apologized. He promised to fulfill any of the sage&#x27;s desires to get rid of his guilt. Vishvamitra demanded &quot;dakshina&quot; (donation) for his rajasuya yajna. The king asked him what he wanted in payment. In response, Vishvamitra said &quot;Give me all that you have except yourself, your wife and your child.&quot; Harishchandra agreed to the demand. He let go of all his possessions – even his clothes. As he readied to leave his palace with his family, Vishvamitra demanded another donation. Harishchandra said that he did not have any possession left, but promised to make another donation within a month.

Harishchandra started living in penury with his wife and his family. His loyal subjects followed him. When Vishvamitra saw the king with his subjects, he started cursing Harishchandra for taking along his subjects (who were a part of the kingdom donated to the sage). The king then decided to leave the kingdom with his family. To make them go away sooner, Vishvamitra started beating the queen with a stick. When the five guardians of the directions saw this, they condemned Vishvamitra. The sage cursed them to be born as human beings. These guardian deities were born as the sons of the Pandavas and Draupadi.

Nearly a month after leaving his kingdom, Harishchandra arrived in the holy city of Kashi, only to see Vishvamitra already present there. The sage demanded the donation that the king had promised him. Harishchandra pointed out that there was still some time left in completion of one month. The sage agreed to come back at the next sunset and departed. As his hungry son cried for food, Harishchandra worried how would he be able to make a donation to the sage. His wife Shaivya suggested that he sell her to get some money. After some hesitation, Harishchandra accepted the proposal and sold her to an elderly man. Their child would not let go of his mother, so it was decided that he would accompany his mother (and an extra payment was made for him).

Soon after, Vishvamitra appeared again and demanded the donation. Harishchandra gave him all the money he had received from the sale of his wife and son. However, Vishvamitra was unhappy with the donation, and demanded more. Harishchandra then decided to sell himself. An outcaste &quot;chandala&quot; (actually Yama in disguise) offered to buy him, but Harishchandra&#x27;s self-respect as a high-caste Kshatriya would not allow this. He instead offered to be Vishwamitra&#x27;s slave. Vishvamitra agreed, but then declared &quot;Since you are my slave, you must obey me. I sell you to this &quot;chandala&quot; in exchange of gold coins.&quot; The &quot;chandala&quot; paid the sage, and took along Harishchandra as a slave.

The &quot;chandala&quot; employed Harishchandra as a worker at his cremation ground. He directed Harishchandra to collect fees for every body cremated there: a part of the fee would go to the &quot;chandala&quot;, a part would be given to the local king, and the rest would be Harishchandra&#x27;s remuneration. Harishchandra started living and working at the cremation ground. One day, he dreamed about his past lives, and realized that his current condition was a result of his past sins. During this nightmare, he also saw his queen crying before him. When he woke up, he saw his queen actually crying before him. She held the dead body of their son, who had died of a snake bite. Thinking of his misfortune, Harishchandra contemplated suicide, but realized that he would continue to pay for his sins in his next life.

Meanwhile, the queen readied to cremate their son&#x27;s cadaver. But, Harishchandra told her that he would not let her do so without paying the fee. Meanwhile, all the deities appeared led by Yama and accompanied by Vishvamitra. They praised Harishchandra for his good qualities, and invited him to heaven.

But Harishchandra refused to go to heaven without his public who have lamented over his departure from his kingdom. He believes that they are the equal sharer in his merits and that he will only go heaven when his people also accompany him. He requested the king of devas, Indra to allow his people to go to heaven at least for a single day. Indra accepts his request, and he along with his people ascend to the heaven.

After his ascension to heaven, Vashistha – the sage of Harishchandra&#x27;s royal dynasty – ended his &quot;tapasya&quot; of twelve years. He learned of what had happened to Harishchandra during these years. He quarreled with Vishvamitra, but was ultimately pacified by Brahma. Brahma explained to him that Vishvamitra was only testing the king, and had actually helped him ascend to heaven.

==== Devi Bhagavata Purana ====
The &quot;Devi Bhagavata Purana&quot; contains a story similar to the one mentioned in the &quot;Markandeya Purana&quot;, but also contains a reference to the &quot;Aitareya Brahamana&quot; legend. This legend is narrated by Vyasa to Janamejaya. It starts with Vashistha – the sage of Harishchandra&#x27;s royal dynasty – praising the king&#x27;s honesty and noble character. Vishvamitra objects to this, pointing out that Harishchandra was ready to sacrifice Sunahshepa, a human. He promises to prove that Harishchandra is not of noble character, and tricks the king into breaking his &quot;tapasya&quot;. The rest of the story is similar to the &quot;Markandeya Purana&quot; version, with minor variations.

=== Mahabharata ===
In &quot;Mahabharata&quot;, Narada tells Yudhishthira that Harishchandra is a &quot;rajarshi&quot; (king-sage), and the only earthly king who finds a place in the assembly of gods. According to Narada, Harishchandra was a powerful emperor, and all the kings on earth accepted his suzerainty. He performed the rajasuya yajna. After completing the rituals, he gratified the Brahmins with delicacies, gave them what they wanted and gifted them jewels. For this reason, he finds a place alongside Indra (the king of the gods).

==In popular culture==
Poet Raghavanka&#x27;s &quot;Harishchandra Literature&quot; from 12th century in Kannada language is a very popular and acclaimed epic on the life of Harishchandra.

Harishchandra has been the subject of many films in India. The earliest is &quot;Raja Harishchandra&quot; from 1913, written and directed by Dhundiraj Govind Phalke; it is the first full-length Indian feature film. The first &quot;talkie&quot; of Marathi cinema, &quot;Ayodhyecha Raja&quot; (1932) directed by V. Shantaram, was also based on his life, starring Govindrao Tembe and Durga Khote as the lead roles. The film was later remade under the name &quot;Ayodhya Ka Raja&quot; (1932) in Hindi, making it the first double-language talkie of Indian cinema. 

Telugu cinema has produced few films on this hindu mythological subject, in 1935 with the title of Harishchandra was directed by P. Pullaiah starred by Addanki Srirama Murthy and P. Kannamba, in 1960 again with the same title of Harishchandra film was directed by Jampana Chandrashekara Rao and starred by S. V. Ranga Rao and C. Lakshmi Rajyam. The famously acclaimed Satya Harishchandra (1965 Telugu film) produced and directed by K. V. Reddy under the Vijaya Productions banner. It stars N. T. Rama Rao and S. Varalakshmi. K. V. Reddy produced the film simultaneously in Kannada with the same title, starring Dr. Rajkumar.

In Tamil K. B. Nagabhushanam directed Harischandra (1944 film) starred by P. U. Chinnappa and P. Kannamba, in the later years it was remade again in Tamil with the title of Harichandra (1968 film) directed by K. S. Prakash Rao starred by Sivaji Ganesan and G. Varalakshmi which was a popularly acclaimed movie for acting and dialogues. Also, in Tamil popular colloquial usage, Raja Harishchandra is synonymous with absolute adherence to the truth. A person is often chided as being &quot;a Raja Harishchandra&quot;, if he tries to cling to truth even to the detriment of those related to him. 

The Kannada epic Satya Harishchandra (1965 Kannada film) was based on 12th century Hoysala poet Raghavanka&#x27;s work, &quot;Harishchandra Kavya&quot; starring Rajkumar. At the 13th National Film Awards, the film was awarded the President&#x27;s silver medal for the Best Feature Film in Kannada. The film was hugely successful at the time of its release and is seen as a milestone in Kannada cinema. &quot;Satya Harishchandra&quot; was the third Indian and first South Indian film to be digitally coloured. The coloured version, released in April 2008, was a commercial success. 

In 1985, a Bengali language film &quot;Harishchandra Shaibya&quot; was released based on the life of King Harishchandra. This film was directed by Ardhendu Chatterjee. It is also said that Harishchandra was a truthful man, who never lied in his life and is therefore also called &quot;Satyavadi&quot; (one who always speaks the truth). The king and the god tale was based on him.

<text>Philippe Édouard Poulletier de Verneuil (; 13 February 180529 May 1873) was a French paleontologist.

==Life==
He was born in Paris and educated in law, but being of independent means he was free to follow his own inclinations, and having attended lectures on geology by Jean-Baptiste Elie de Beaumont he was so attracted to the subject that he devoted himself assiduously to the study of science. He spent several years in travel through various parts of Europe, specially examining the geology of the Crimea, on which he published an essay (Mem. Soc. Geol. France, 1837). He next investigated the Devonian rocks and fossils of the Bas-Boulonnais; and in 1839 accompanied Sedgwick and Murchison in a study of the older Palaeozoic rocks of the Rhenish provinces and Belgium, the palaeontological results being communicated to the Geological Society of London in conjunction with the Vicomte d&#x27;Archiac.

When Murchison commenced his geological examination of the Russian empire, he requested de Verneuil to accompany him, and the researches of the latter were incorporated in the second volume of &quot;The Geology of Russia in Europe and the Ural Mountains&quot; (1845). Subsequently, de Verneuil paid a visit to the United States to study the history of the palaeozoic rocks in that country, and the results were published in 1847 (Bull. Soc. Geol. France). In later years he made numerous expeditions into Spain, and his observations were embodied in &quot;Carte geologique de l&#x27;Espagne et du Portugal&quot; (1864), prepared in association with Edouard Collomb. In 1853 the Wollaston medal of the Geological Society of London was awarded to him, and in 1860 he was elected a foreign member of the Royal Society. He died in Paris.

De Verneuil was President of the Geological Society of France in 1840, 1853, and 1867.

The deformed brachiopod fossil &quot;Cyrtospirifer verneuili&quot;, known to quarrymen as the Delabole Butterfly, was found in the upper Devonian beds of North Cornwall.
It was named after de Verneuil.

<text>In mathematics, a magic cube is the 3-dimensional equivalent of a magic square, that is, a collection of integers arranged in an &quot;n&quot; × &quot;n&quot; × &quot;n&quot; pattern such that the sums of the numbers on each row, on each column, on each pillar and on each of the four main space diagonals are equal, the so-called magic constant of the cube, denoted &quot;M&quot;3(&quot;n&quot;). If a magic cube consists of the numbers 1, 2, ..., &quot;n&quot;3, then it has magic constant 

:formula_1

If, in addition, the numbers on every cross section diagonal also sum up to the cube&#x27;s magic number, the cube is called a perfect magic cube; otherwise, it is called a semiperfect magic cube. The number &quot;n&quot; is called the order of the magic cube. If the sums of numbers on a magic cube&#x27;s broken space diagonals also equal the cube&#x27;s magic number, the cube is called a pandiagonal magic cube.

==Alternative definition==
In recent years, an alternative definition for the perfect magic cube has gradually come into use. It is based on the fact that a pandiagonal magic square has traditionally been called &quot;perfect&quot;, because all possible lines sum correctly. That is not the case with the above definition for the cube.

==Multimagic cubes==

As in the case of magic squares, a bimagic cube has the additional property of remaining a magic cube when all of the entries are squared, a trimagic cube remains a magic cube under both the operations of squaring the entries and of cubing the entries (Only two of these are known, as of 2005.) A tetramagic cube remains a magic cube when the entries are squared, cubed, or raised to the fourth power.

John R. Hendricks of Canada (1929-2007) has listed four bimagic cubes, two trimagic cubes, and two tetramagic cubes. Two more bimagic cubes (of the same order as those of Hendricks, but differently arranged) were found by Zhong Ming, a mathematics teacher in China. Several of these are perfect magic cubes, and remain perfect after taking powers.

==Magic cubes based on Dürer&#x27;s and Gaudi Magic squares==
A magic cube can be built with the constraint of a given magic square appearing on one of its faces Magic cube with the magic square of Dürer, and Magic cube with the magic square of Gaudi

<text>In mathematics, a perfect magic cube is a magic cube in which not only the columns, rows, pillars, and main space diagonals, but also the cross section diagonals sum up to the cube&#x27;s magic constant.

Perfect magic cubes of order one are trivial; cubes of orders two to four can be proven not to exist, and cubes of orders five and six were first discovered by Walter Trump and Christian Boyer on November 13 and September 1, 2003, respectively. A perfect magic cube of order seven was given by A. H. Frost in 1866, and on March 11, 1875, an article was published in the Cincinnati Commercial newspaper on the discovery of a perfect magic cube of order 8 by Gustavus Frankenstein. Perfect magic cubes of orders nine and eleven have also been constructed.
The first perfect cube of order 10 was constructed in 1988 (Li Wen, China).

==An alternative definition==

In recent years, an alternative definition for the perfect magic cube was proposed by John R. Hendricks. By this definition, a perfect magic cube is one in which all possible lines through each cell sum to the magic constant. The name Nasik magic hypercube is another, unambiguous, name for such a cube. This definition is based on the fact that a pandiagonal magic square has traditionally been called &#x27;perfect&#x27;, because all possible lines sum correctly.

This same reasoning may be applied to hypercubes of any dimension. Simply stated; in an order &quot;m&quot; magic hypercube, if all possible lines of &quot;m&quot; cells sum to the magic constant, the hypercube is perfect. All lower dimension hypercubes contained in this hypercube will then also be perfect. This is not the case with the original definition, which does not require that the planar and diagonal squares be a pandiagonal magic cube. For example, a magic cube of order 8 has 244 correct lines by the &quot;old&quot; definition of &quot;perfect&quot;, but 832 correct lines by this &quot;new&quot; definition.

The smallest perfect magic cube has order 8, and none can exist for double odd orders.

Gabriel Arnoux constructed an order 17 perfect magic cube in 1887. F.A.P.Barnard published order 8 and order 11 perfect cubes in 1888.

By the modern (given by J.R. Hendricks) definition, there are actually six classes of magic cube; simple magic cubes, pantriagonal magic cubes, diagonal magic cubes, pantriagonal diagonal magic cubes, pandiagonal magic cubes, and perfect magic cubes.

==Examples==
1. Order 4 cube by Thomas Krijgsman, 1982; magic constant 130.


2. Order 5 cube by Walter Trump and Christian Boyer, 2003-11-13; magic constant 315.

<text>A mandoline (US, ) or mandolin (British, /ˌmandəˈlɪn/, /ˈmandəlɪn/, /ˈmandl̩ɪn/), is a culinary utensil used for slicing and for cutting juliennes; with suitable attachments, it can make crinkle-cuts.

== Design ==

A mandoline consists of two parallel working surfaces, one of which can be adjusted in height. A food item is slid along the adjustable surface until it reaches a blade mounted on the fixed surface, slicing it and letting it fall.

Other blades perpendicular to the main blade are often mounted so that the slice is cut into strips. The mandoline juliennes in several widths and thicknesses. It also makes slices, waffle cuts and crinkle cuts, and dices firm vegetables and fruits.

With a mandoline, slices are uniform in thickness, which is important with foods that are deep-fried or baked (e.g. potato chips), as well as for presentation. Slices can be very thin, and be made very quickly, with significantly less skill and effort than would be required if cutting with a knife or other blade.

== Operation ==

A mandoline is used by running a piece of food (with some protection for fingers) along an adjustable inclined plane into one or more blades. On some models vertical blades cut to produce julienne, or a wavy blade is used that produces crinkle cuts. In these models a quarter turn to the food between passes produces dice and waffle cuts.

A mandoline can cause serious injury if not used correctly.

<text>Crewe railway station serves the railway town of Crewe, in Cheshire, England. It opened in 1837 and is one of the most historically significant railway stations in the world.

Crewe station is a major junction on the West Coast Main Line and serves as a rail gateway for North West England. It is 158 miles north of London Euston and 243 miles south of . It is located at the point where the lines to Manchester Piccadilly and North Wales diverge from this route, and is the last major station before the branch to diverges. It is also served by lines to and .

Crewe railway station has twelve platforms and a modern passenger entrance containing a bookshop and ticket office. Passengers access the platforms via a footbridge, stairs and lifts. The platform buildings, which date from the 19th century, contain two bookshops, bars, buffets and waiting rooms. The last major expenditure on the station took place in 1984-1985 when the track layout was remodelled and the station facilities were updated.

==History==

===Early years===
Crewe&#x27;s location was chosen after Winsford, seven miles to the north, had rejected an earlier proposal, as had local landowners in neighbouring Nantwich, four miles away.

Crewe station was the first station to have its own adjacent railway hotel: the Crewe Arms Hotel, built in 1838, and still in use. It was the first to be completely rebuilt owing to the need for expansion. It was also the first to have completely independent rail lines built around it to ease traffic congestion.

The station opened on 4 July 1837 on the Grand Junction Railway. The purpose was to link the four largest cities of England by joining the existing Liverpool and Manchester Railway with the projected London &amp; Birmingham Railway. The first long-distance railway in the world, it ran from Curzon Street railway station in Birmingham to Dallam in Warrington, Cheshire, where it made an end-on junction with the Warrington and Newton Railway, a branch of the L&amp;M.
 
The station was built in the township of Crewe, which formed part of the ancient parish of Barthomley. The township later became a civil parish in its own right, and, later still, was renamed &quot;Crewe Green&quot; to avoid confusion with the town of Crewe, which was adjacent to it. The station was at the point where the line crossed the turnpike road linking the Trent and Mersey and the Shropshire Union Canals. Since the land was bought from the Earl of Crewe, whose mansion stood nearby, and it was located in the township of Crewe, the station was called Crewe. The railway station gave its name to the town of Crewe that was actually situated in the ancient parish of Coppenhall. In 1936, the railway station was transferred from the civil parish of Crewe to the then municipal borough of Crewe.

As soon as the station opened the Chester and Crewe Railway was formed to build a branch line to Chester and this company was absorbed by the GJR shortly before it opened to traffic in 1840. A locomotive depot was built to serve the Chester line, and to provide banking engines to assist trains southwards from Crewe up the Madeley Incline, a modest gradient which was a challenge to the small engines of the day.

By 1841, the Chester line was seen as a starting point for a new trunk line to the port of Holyhead, to provide the fastest route to Ireland, and the importance of Crewe as a junction station began to be established. This was given further endorsement when the Manchester and Birmingham Railway, a separate undertaking which had hoped to build a wholly independent line linking the two cities, shorter than the GJR, decided that it would be uneconomical to compete with that line over the greater part of its length, and decided to divert its own line to meet the GJR at Crewe. Teething squabbles between the companies delayed the running of through services for a while, and the M&amp;B had to build a temporary station of their own, part of which survives today as an isolated platform next to the North Junction, at the start of the line to Manchester.

In 1842 the GJR decided to move its locomotive works from Edge Hill in Liverpool to Crewe, siting the works to the north of the junction between the Warrington and Chester lines. To house the workforce and company management the town of Crewe was built by the company to the north of the works.

===London &amp; North Western Railway===
In 1846 the GJR merged with the London and Birmingham to form the London and North Western Railway Company, which until its demise in 1923 was the largest company in the world. The new company extended the existing lines to Holyhead, the Warrington line to Lancaster and Carlisle, the Manchester line to Leeds, and built the new Crewe and Shrewsbury Railway to Shrewsbury to join the joint GWR owned Shrewsbury and Hereford Railway, which provided connections to South Wales. The North Staffordshire Railway built a line from Stoke-on-Trent, joining the LNWR from the South East. Crewe was the centre of a wide-ranging railway network, and freight-handling facilities grew up to the south of the station.

To cope with the increase of traffic, the station was rebuilt in 1867 (according to WH Chaloner), the buildings facing each other on the present platforms 5 and 6 dating from this time, and built under the supervision of William Baker. The listing by English Heritage describes them as: mirrored design with bowed projections for the platform inspectors&#x27; offices, the &#x27;greybeard&#x27; keystones and vivid polychromy ... one of the best pieces of mid-C19 platform architecture designed anywhere on the LNWR network, and as rare surviving examples nationally of buildings of a major junction station of this period.

At the same time the works was redeveloped and enlarged and the town also enlarged under the leadership of John Ramsbottom, a Todmorden man who had become Locomotive Superintendent. Locomotive construction, hitherto divided with Wolverton (on the London and Birmingham Railway) was concentrated at Crewe. Ramsbottom also built a steelworks, the first in the world to make large-scale use of the Bessemer process, as only the LNWR required enough steel to keep a Bessemer plant continuously occupied. He also introduced mass-production techniques, whereby as many parts as possible were identical between one engine and another.
Ramsbottom retired in 1871 and was succeeded by the legendary Frank Webb, a colourful and controversial figure who was known as &#x27;The Uncrowned King of Crewe&#x27;.

By the 1890s a survey revealed 1,000 trains passing within a 24-hour period. Half of these were freight trains which did not need to call at the station, so the company decided to build a separate four-track railway line passing to the west of the station, joining the existing lines beyond the north and south junctions, burrowing beneath them and avoiding them completely. Plans for the &quot;independent lines&quot; were approved in 1895 and construction lasted from 1896 to 1901. Over 1,000 labourers were employed on what was known as the &quot;big dig&quot; at a cost about £500,000 (). This undertaking also included a marshalling yard to the south of the station at Basford Hall, a revolutionary &#x27;tranship shed&#x27; which allowed fast transfer of freight from wagons to road vehicles under cover. The station was enlarged between 1903 and 1907, by providing eight through platforms each a quarter of a mile long. The cost of the improvements was £1,000,000 ().

===London, Midland and Scottish Railway===
In 1923 the LNWR became part of the London, Midland &amp; Scottish Railway group. Crewe remained the major centre for locomotive construction. In 1938-39 the signal boxes at North and South Junctions were completely reconstructed as massive concrete structures to withstand air raids, and remained in use until the resignalling project in 1985. The North Junction signal box can now be visited as part of the Crewe Heritage Centre. Although the railway station is virtually synonymous with the town of Crewe, it was not actually incorporated within the borders of the borough of Crewe until the late 1930s, as it lies about 1 mile to the south east of the actual town centre.

With the exception of two new signal boxes and associated greatly improved colour light signalling, track circuiting and electrically operated track points, train operation at Crewe changed little in over fifty years. The trains did become longer and heavier and were hauled by larger engines, which required increased supplies of water to be taken on board before departure, but the number of passenger trains using Crewe Station and the method of operation did not vary greatly despite the passage of two world wars. Trains continued to divide at Crewe with the front portion for Manchester and the rear for Liverpool. The station pilot engine always had a pair of restaurant cars in a bay platform ready to attach to a morning service to London. Always there were extra coaches waiting to be attached to overcrowded trains. In addition to passengers there were vast quantities of mail, parcels and even live animals and birds of all descriptions transported in specially designed transit crates. When necessary the station staff had to feed and water these special passengers, which travelled in copious luggage vans.

===British Railways===

In 1948 the LMS was nationalised as British Railways, London Midland Region. Nationalisation greatly facilitated the modernisation of British Railways and, after a false start developing new improved steam engines, electrification came, along with diesel power and fixed-formation air-braked trains. These changes had a significant effect on Crewe station. Notably, the variation in station use caused firstly by the electrification in stages of the West Coast Main Line between 1959 and 1974 and secondly by the general end of steam traction on Britain&#x27;s railways. Following the completion of electrification in 1974, trains did not need to change locomotives at Crewe, except for the London to Chester and Holyhead service. Many locomotive hauled trains were replaced by electric or diesel multiple unit trains, with much faster turn-round times. Additionally, two local branch lines had closed, which resulted in fewer trains terminating at Crewe. However, compensating for the decline of local passenger traffic, the reduction in mail and parcels traffic and the total elimination of livestock carriage, came the great increase in inter-city passenger traffic and the need for even faster, smoother and more efficient handling of passenger trains.

In 1963 the architects to the London Midland Region of British Railways provided a Porte-cochère at the passenger entrance on Nantwich Road. It was constructed of eight laminated wood Hyperbolic paraboloid shells. This was replaced between 1983 and 1985 with the current steel structure.

In 1985 in a £14.3 million scheme, the track layout was modernised and simplified, eliminating many points and crossings and allowing running over the North Junction. At the same time all but one of the six 1902 extension platforms were taken out of use. Four Class 40 locomotives were reallocated to this work in 1985, and were renumbered as 97405–97408 for the engineering duties.

===Present day===

In 2007 Network Rail published a proposal to replace the existing Crewe station with a new station located approximately 1 mile to the south. A &quot;Crewe Town&quot; station was also proposed nearer the town centre on the Chester line, with a shuttle service to the new main station. In 2009 the station was identified as one of the ten worst category B interchange stations for mystery shopper assessment of fabric and environment.

The proposal to move the station was abandoned in 2010 and instead the current building was renovated. Cheshire East Council implemented a regeneration master plan for Crewe, which included the station.

In 2011 Cheshire East Council purchased the former Royal Mail depot and Weston House for £2.75 million. The council demolished the two buildings and created a new entrance to the station, as well as a 244 space car park and a secure bike parking structure, at a cost of £7 million. The construction work was undertaken by Balfour Beatty. The new entrance has step-free access &amp; connects passengers to the station through an underground walkway. There is a ticket vending machine at this entrance, as well as unmanned ticket barriers.

In August 2016 the station buildings of 1867 were added to the National Heritage List for England as a Grade II listed building. The structures included in the listing comprise two station buildings on separate platforms, and two screen walls, one to the east and the other to the west of the station.

With seven train companies calling, Crewe is tied with Doncaster for the highest number of companies calling at a UK station.

===Accidents and incidents===
On 7 November 1980 two freight trains collided at Crewe railway station.

==Future==

In January 2013, it was announced that the existing Crewe station would be a stop on the western branch of the planned HS2 high-speed rail route.
A new platform will be built on the Manchester independent lines to the west of the station, meaning that services will not have to cross the West Coast Main Line from Manchester Piccadilly or the Marches Line to South Wales.

Following the Crewe Hub consultation, which ran from July to October 2017, it is planned that up to 5 to 7 trains per hour will stop at Crewe; plans for a new service to Manchester via Stafford, Stoke-on-Trent and Macclesfield are also proposed. This will be made possible by extending the existing platform 5 to 400 metres, allowing services to split and serve these additional destinations. It is also planned that a new transfer deck will be built; this will allow passengers to change between the proposed new Manchester independent lines platform and the existing Crewe station.

However, on 4 October 2023, Prime Minister Rishi Sunak announced the cancellation of this Phase 2a of the HS2 development at the Conservative Party Conference.

<doc id="372379" wikidata="Q454443" url="?curid=372379" title="Ostflucht">
<text>The Ostflucht (; &quot;flight from the East&quot;) was the migration of Germans, in the later 19th century and early 20th century, from areas which were then eastern parts of Germany to more industrialized regions in central and western Germany. The migrants originated in East Prussia, West Prussia, Silesia, Pomerania and Posen; they moved to provinces along the Rhine and Ruhr rivers. Most of the migrants were ethnic Germans, but many migrants to the Ruhr were of Polish ethnicity, later known as &quot;Ruhrpolen&quot;.

== Causes ==
The United States, which had been the major destination of emigrants from the German East, lost much of its attraction with the closing of the American frontier and the end of large-scale land runs in the 1890s. At the same time, the Ruhr area prospered, leading to high demand for labor, especially in coal mining and heavy industries. This led to an East-to-West migration within the Kingdom of Prussia. Through 1907, 2,300,000 people emigrated from Prussia&#x27;s eastern provinces (Pomerania, West Prussia, East Prussia, Posen, and Silesia), while only 358,000 migrated into these provinces. Among the emigrants were 600,000 Poles. This loss of workforce hit farms, which made up for this by calling in seasonal workers from further east. Berlin and Brandenburg in the same time gained 1,200,000 inhabitants, while the Ruhr area and surrounding provinces (Westphalia and Palatinate) gained 640,000 people.

At the same time, increased immigration into the eastern German regions by Poles from western Russia caused imbalances and upheavals there, especially in Upper Silesia.

== Reactions ==
The emigration of Germans, and the higher Polish birth rate in the eastern provinces caused concern among German nationalists. This led to some special measures:
* limiting sale of estates to Germans only,
* encouraging Germans to immigrate to the Prussian state,
* creating an &quot;Ansiedlungskommission&quot; (&quot;Settlement Commission&quot;) funded by the state, that aimed at buying land from ethnic Poles and selling it to Germans,
* instituting rules which required an ethnic Pole to apply for approval (rarely given) to build a new house on a newly acquired farm.

The sociologist Max Weber first came to public attention in Germany as a result of his study of the &quot;Ostflucht&quot; and of methods of combatting it, carried out on behalf of the &quot;Verein für Socialpolitik&quot;.

<doc id="372381" wikidata="Q1390705" url="?curid=372381" title="Data degradation">
<text>Data degradation is the gradual corruption of computer data due to an accumulation of non-critical failures in a data storage device. It is also referred to as data decay, data rot or bit rot. This results in a decline in data quality over time, even when the data is not being utilized. The concept of data degradation involves progressively minimizing data in interconnected processes, where data is used for multiple purposes at different levels of detail. At specific points in the process chain, data is irreversibly reduced to a level that remains sufficient for the successful completion of the following steps

==Manifestations==

===Primary storages===
Data degradation in dynamic random-access memory (DRAM) can occur when the electric charge of a bit in DRAM disperses, possibly altering program code or stored data. DRAM may be altered by cosmic rays or other high-energy particles. Such data degradation is known as a soft error. ECC memory can be used to mitigate this type of data degradation.

===Secondary storages===
Data degradation results from the gradual decay of storage media over the course of years or longer. Causes vary by medium.

====Solid-state media====
EPROMs, flash memory and other solid-state drive store data using electrical charges, which can slowly leak away due to imperfect insulation. Modern flash controller chips account for this leak by trying several lower threshold voltages (until ECC passes), prolonging the age of data. Multi-level cells with much lower distance between voltage levels cannot be considered stable without this functionality.

The chip itself is not affected by this, so reprogramming it approximately once per decade prevents decay. An undamaged copy of the master data is required for the reprogramming. A checksum can be used to assure that the on-chip data is not yet damaged and ready for reprogramming.

The typical SD card, USB stick and M.2 NVMe all have a limited endurance. Power on can usually recover data but error rates will eventually degrade the media to illegibility. Writing zeros to a degraded NAND device can revive the storage to close to new condition for further use. Refresh cycles should be no longer than 6 months to be sure the device is legible.

====Magnetic media====
Magnetic media, such as hard disk drives, floppy disks and magnetic tapes, may experience data decay as bits lose their magnetic orientation. Higher temperature speeds up the rate of magnetic loss. As with solid-state media, re-writing is useful as long as the medium itself is not damaged (see below). Modern hard drives use Giant magnetoresistance and have a higher magnetic lifespan on the order of decades. They also automatically correct any errors detected by ECC through rewriting. The reliance on a factory servo track can complicate data recovery if it becomes unrecoverable, however.

Floppy disks and tapes are poorly protected against ambient air. In warm/humid conditions, they are prone to the physical decomposition of the storage medium.

====Optical media====
Optical media such as CD-R, DVD-R and BD-R, may experience data decay from the breakdown of the storage medium. This can be mitigated by storing discs in a dark, cool, low humidity location. &quot;Archival quality&quot; discs are available with an extended lifetime, but are still not permanent. However, data integrity scanning that measures the rates of various types of errors is able to predict data decay on optical media well ahead of uncorrectable data loss occurring.

Both the disc dye and the disc backing layer are potentially susceptible to breakdown. Early cyanine-based dyes used in CD-R were notorious for their lack of UV stability. Early CDs also suffered from CD bronzing, and is related to a combination of bad lacquer material and failure of the aluminum reflection layer. Later discs use more stable dyes or forgo them for an inorganic mixture. The aluminum layer is also commonly swapped out for gold or silver alloy.

====Paper media====
Paper media, such as punched cards and punched tape, may literally rot. Mylar punched tape is another approach that does not rely on electromagnetic stability. Degradation of books and printing paper is primarily driven by acid hydrolysis of glycosidic bonds within the cellulose molecule as well as by oxidation; degradation of paper is accelerated by high relative humidity, high temperature, as well as by exposure to acids, oxygen, light, and various pollutants, including various volatile organic compounds and nitrogen dioxide.

====Streaming media====
Data degradation in streaming media acquisition modules, as addressed by the repair algorithms, reflects real-time data quality issues caused by device limitations. However, a more general form of data degradation refers to the gradual decay of storage media over extended periods, influenced by factors like physical wear, environmental conditions, or technological obsolescence. Causes of such degradation can vary depending on the medium, such as magnetic fields in hard drives, moisture or temperature for tape storage, or electronic failure over time.

===Example===
One manifestation of data degradation is when one or a few bits are randomly flipped over a long period of time. This is illustrated by several digital images below, all consisting of 326,272 bits. The original photo is displayed first. In the next image, a single bit was changed from 0 to 1. In the next two images, two and three bits were flipped. On Linux systems, the binary difference between files can be revealed using the command (e.g. ).

==Causes==
This deterioration can be caused by a variety of factors that impact the reliability and integrity of digital information, including physical factors, software errors, security breaches, human error, obsolete technology, and unauthorized access incidents.

Most disk, disk controller and higher-level systems are subject to a slight chance of unrecoverable failure. With ever-growing disk capacities, file sizes, and increases in the amount of data stored on a disk, the likelihood of the occurrence of data decay and other forms of uncorrected and undetected data corruption increases.

Low-level disk controllers typically employ error correction codes (ECC) to correct erroneous data.

Higher-level software systems may be employed to mitigate the risk of such underlying failures by increasing redundancy and implementing integrity checking, error correction codes and self-repairing algorithms. The ZFS file system was designed to address many of these data corruption issues. The Btrfs file system also includes data protection and recovery mechanisms, as does ReFS.

==Mitigation==
There is no solution that completely eliminates the threat of data degradation, but various measures exist that can stave it off. One of these is to replicate the data as backups. Both the original and backed data are then audited for any faults due to storage media errors by checksumming the data or comparing it with that of other copies. This is the only way to detect &quot;latent&quot; faults proactively, which might otherwise go unnoticed until the data is actually accessed. Current storage systems such as those based on RAID already employ such measures internally. Ideally, and especially for data that must be preserved digitally, the replicas should be distributed across multiple administrative sites that function autonomously and deploy various hardware and software, increasing resistance to failure, as well as human error and cyberattacks.

<doc id="372395" wikidata="Q7700713" url="?curid=372395" title="Tensor product of algebras">
<text>In mathematics, the tensor product of two algebras over a commutative ring &quot;R&quot; is also an &quot;R&quot;-algebra. This gives the tensor product of algebras. When the ring is a field, the most common application of such products is to describe the product of algebra representations.

==Definition==
Let &quot;R&quot; be a commutative ring and let &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; be &quot;R&quot;-algebras. Since &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; may both be regarded as &quot;R&quot;-modules, their tensor product
:formula_1
is also an &quot;R&quot;-module. The tensor product can be given the structure of a ring by defining the product on elements of the form by
:formula_2
and then extending by linearity to all of . This ring is an &quot;R&quot;-algebra, associative and unital with the identity element given by . where 1&quot;A&quot; and 1&quot;B&quot; are the identity elements of &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot;. If &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; are commutative, then the tensor product is commutative as well.

The tensor product turns the category of &quot;R&quot;-algebras into a symmetric monoidal category.

==Further properties==
There are natural homomorphisms from &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; to given by
:formula_3
:formula_4
These maps make the tensor product the coproduct in the category of commutative &quot;R&quot;-algebras. The tensor product is &quot;not&quot; the coproduct in the category of all &quot;R&quot;-algebras. There the coproduct is given by a more general free product of algebras. Nevertheless, the tensor product of non-commutative algebras can be described by a universal property similar to that of the coproduct:
:formula_5
where [-, -] denotes the commutator.
The natural isomorphism is given by identifying a morphism formula_6 on the left hand side with the pair of morphisms formula_7 on the right hand side where formula_8 and similarly formula_9.

==Applications==
The tensor product of commutative algebras is of frequent use in algebraic geometry. For affine schemes &quot;X&quot;, &quot;Y&quot;, &quot;Z&quot; with morphisms from &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Z&quot; to &quot;Y&quot;, so &quot;X&quot; = Spec(&quot;A&quot;), &quot;Y&quot; = Spec(&quot;R&quot;), and &quot;Z&quot; = Spec(&quot;B&quot;) for some commutative rings &quot;A&quot;, &quot;R&quot;, &quot;B&quot;, the fiber product scheme is the affine scheme corresponding to the tensor product of algebras:
:formula_10
More generally, the fiber product of schemes is defined by gluing together affine fiber products of this form.

==Examples==

* The tensor product can be used as a means of taking intersections of two subschemes in a scheme: consider the formula_11-algebras formula_12, formula_13, then their tensor product is formula_14, which describes the intersection of the algebraic curves &quot;f&quot; = 0 and &quot;g&quot; = 0 in the affine plane over C.
*More generally, if formula_15 is a commutative ring and formula_16 are ideals, then formula_17, with a unique isomorphism sending formula_18 to formula_19.
* Tensor products can be used as a means of changing coefficients. For example, formula_20 and formula_21.
* Tensor products also can be used for taking products of affine schemes over a field. For example, formula_22 is isomorphic to the algebra formula_23 which corresponds to an affine surface in formula_24 if &quot;f&quot; and &quot;g&quot; are not zero.
* Given formula_25-algebras formula_15 and formula_27 whose underlying rings are graded-commutative rings, the tensor product formula_28 becomes a graded commutative ring by defining formula_29 for homogeneous formula_30, formula_31, formula_32, and formula_33.

<text>In mathematics, a &quot;P&quot;-multimagic cube is a magic cube that remains magic even if all its numbers are replaced by their &quot;k&quot;&amp;hairsp;th powers for 1 ≤ &quot;k&quot; ≤ &quot;P&quot;. cubes are called bimagic, cubes are called trimagic, and cubes tetramagic. A cube is said to be semi-perfect if the &quot;k&quot;&amp;hairsp;th power cubes are perfect for 1 ≤ &quot;k&quot; &lt; &quot;P&quot;, and the &quot;P&quot;&amp;hairsp;th power cube is semiperfect. If all &quot;P&quot; of the power cubes are perfect, the cube is said to be perfect. 

The first known example of a bimagic cube was given by John Hendricks in 2000; it is a semiperfect cube of order 25 and magic constant 195325. In 2003, C. Bower discovered two semi-perfect bimagic cubes of order 16, and a perfect bimagic cube of order 32. 

MathWorld reports that only two trimagic cubes are known, discovered by C. Bower in 2003; a semiperfect cube of order 64 and a perfect cube of order 256. It also reports that he discovered the only two known tetramagic cubes, a semiperfect cube of order 1024, and perfect cube of order 8192.

<doc id="372399" wikidata="Q7098616" url="?curid=372399" title="Opposite category">
<text>In category theory, a branch of mathematics, the opposite category or dual category &quot;C&quot;op of a given category &quot;C&quot; is formed by reversing the morphisms, i.e. interchanging the source and target of each morphism. Doing the reversal twice yields the original category, so the opposite of an opposite category is the original category itself. In symbols, formula_1.

==Examples==
* An example comes from reversing the direction of inequalities in a partial order. So if &quot;X&quot; is a set and ≤ a partial order relation, we can define a new partial order relation ≤op by

:: &quot;x&quot; ≤op &quot;y&quot; if and only if &quot;y&quot; ≤ &quot;x&quot;.

: The new order is commonly called dual order of ≤, and is mostly denoted by ≥. Therefore, duality plays an important role in order theory and every purely order theoretic concept has a dual. For example, there are opposite pairs child/parent, descendant/ancestor, infimum/supremum, down-set/up-set, ideal/filter etc. This order theoretic duality is in turn a special case of the construction of opposite categories as every ordered set can be understood as a category.
* Given a semigroup (&quot;S&quot;, ·), one usually defines the opposite semigroup as (&quot;S&quot;, ·)op = (&quot;S&quot;, *) where &quot;x&quot;*&quot;y&quot; ≔ &quot;y&quot;·&quot;x&quot; for all &quot;x&quot;,&quot;y&quot; in &quot;S&quot;. So also for semigroups there is a strong duality principle. Clearly, the same construction works for groups, as well, and is known in ring theory, too, where it is applied to the multiplicative semigroup of the ring to give the opposite ring. Again this process can be described by completing a semigroup to a monoid, taking the corresponding opposite category, and then possibly removing the unit from that monoid.
* The category of Boolean algebras and Boolean homomorphisms is equivalent to the opposite of the category of Stone spaces and continuous functions.
* The category of affine schemes is equivalent to the opposite of the category of commutative rings.
* The Pontryagin duality restricts to an equivalence between the category of compact Hausdorff abelian topological groups and the opposite of the category of (discrete) abelian groups.
* By the Gelfand–Naimark theorem, the category of localizable measurable spaces (with measurable maps) is equivalent to the category of commutative Von Neumann algebras (with normal unital homomorphisms of *-algebras).

==Properties==
Opposite preserves products:
:formula_2 (see product category)

Opposite preserves functors:
:formula_3 (see functor category, opposite functor)

Opposite preserves slices:
:formula_4 (see comma category)

She has received awards for her work, including the Thomas Merton Award in 2004, a Right Livelihood Award in 2008, and an Izzy Award in 2009 for &quot;special achievement in independent media&quot;.

In 2012, Goodman received the Gandhi Peace Award for a &quot;significant contribution to the promotion of an enduring international peace&quot;. She is the author of six books, including the 2012 &quot;The Silenced Majority: Stories of Uprisings, Occupations, Resistance, and Hope,&quot; and the 2016 &quot;Democracy Now!: Twenty Years Covering the Movements Changing America.&quot; In 2016, she was criminally charged with a riot in connection with her coverage of protests of the Dakota Access pipeline. This action was condemned by the Committee to Protect Journalists. The charges were dismissed by the North Dakota district judge on October 17, 2016.

In 2014 she was awarded the I.F. Stone Medal for Journalistic Independence by Harvard University&#x27;s Nieman Foundation.

==Early life==
Amy Goodman was born in Bay Shore, New York on Long Island to secular Jewish parents who were active in social action groups. Her father, George Goodman, was an ophthalmologist. Her mother, Dorothy Goodman, was a literature teacher and later a social worker. She has two brothers, David Goodman and Steven N. Goodman. Goodman&#x27;s maternal grandfather was an Orthodox rabbi. Her maternal grandmother was born in Rivne, present day Ukraine.

She graduated from Bay Shore High School in 1975. Goodman studied for a year at the College of the Atlantic in Bar Harbor, Maine, and graduated in 1984 from Radcliffe College of Harvard University with a degree in anthropology.

==Investigative journalism career==

In 1991, covering the East Timor independence movement, Goodman and fellow journalist Allan Nairn reported that they were badly beaten by Indonesian soldiers after witnessing a mass killing of Timorese demonstrators in what became known as the Santa Cruz massacre.

In 1998, Goodman and journalist Jeremy Scahill documented Chevron Corporation&#x27;s role in a confrontation between the Nigerian Army and villagers who had seized oil rigs and other equipment belonging to oil corporations. Two villagers were shot and killed during the standoff. On May 28, 1998, the company provided helicopter transport to the Nigerian Navy and Mobile Police (MOPOL) to their Parabe oil platform, which had been occupied by villagers who accused the company of contaminating their land. Soon after landing, the Nigerian military shot and killed two of the protesters, Jola Ogungbeje and Aroleka Irowaninu, and wounded 11 others. Chevron spokesperson Sola Omole acknowledged that the company transported the troops. Omole said that Chevron management had requested troops from the government to protect their facility. The documentary made by Goodman and her colleagues, &quot;Drilling and Killing: Chevron and Nigeria&#x27;s Oil Dictatorship&quot;, won the George Polk Award in 1998.

Michael Delli Carpini, dean of the Annenberg School for Communication, said of Goodman: &quot;She&#x27;s not an editorialist. She sticks to the facts... She provides points of view that make you think, and she comes at it by saying: &#x27;Who are we not hearing from in the traditional media?&#x27;&quot;

===&quot;Democracy Now!&quot;===
Goodman had been news director of Pacifica Radio station WBAI in New York City for more than a decade when she co-founded &quot;Democracy Now! The War and Peace Report&quot; in 1996. Since then, &quot;Democracy Now!&quot; has been described as &quot;probably the most significant progressive news institution that has come around in some time&quot; by professor and media critic Robert McChesney.

In 2001, the show was temporarily pulled off the air, as a result of a conflict between some Pacifica Radio board members and staff members and listeners over the direction of the station. During that time, it moved to a converted firehouse, from which it broadcast from January 2002 for nearly eight years, until November 13, 2009. &quot;Democracy Now!&quot; subsequently moved to a studio located in the Chelsea neighborhood of Manhattan.

Goodman credits the program&#x27;s success to the &quot;huge niche&quot; left by coverage of mainstream media organizations.

===Interview with President Clinton ===
When President Bill Clinton called WBAI on Election Day 2000 for a quick get-out-the-vote message, Goodman and WBAI&#x27;s Gonzalo Aburto challenged him for 28 minutes with human rights questions about AIM activist Leonard Peltier, racial profiling, the Iraq sanctions, Ralph Nader, the death penalty, the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), the normalization of relations with Cuba, and the Israeli–Palestinian conflict. Clinton defended his administration&#x27;s policies and said that Goodman was &quot;hostile and combative&quot;.

===Arrest at 2008 Republican Convention===
During the 2008 Republican National Convention in Saint Paul, Minnesota, several of Goodman&#x27;s colleagues from &quot;Democracy Now!&quot; were arrested and detained by police while reporting on an anti-war protest outside the RNC. While trying to ascertain the status of her colleagues, Goodman was also arrested and held, accused of obstructing a legal process and interfering with a police officer. Fellow &quot;Democracy Now!&quot; producers, including reporter Sharif Abdel Kouddous, were held on charges of probable cause for riot. The arrests of the producers were videotaped. Goodman and her colleagues were later released, City Attorney John Choi indicated that the charges would be dropped. Goodman (&quot;et al.&quot;) filed a federal civil lawsuit against the St. Paul and Minneapolis police departments and the US Secret Service for the illegal arrests. The agencies reached a $100,000 settlement and agreed to educate officers about the First Amendment rights of members of the press and public.

===British Columbia border crossing incident===
On November 25, 2009, Goodman and her two colleagues, Denis Moynihan and Chuck Scurich, were detained for approximately 90 minutes by Canadian agents at the Douglas, British Columbia border crossing into Canada while en route to a scheduled meeting at the Vancouver Public Library. Immigration officials asked questions pertaining to the intended topics of discussion at the meeting. They wanted to know whether she would be speaking about the 2010 Olympic Games to be held in Canada.

She and her colleagues were eventually permitted to enter Canada after the customs authorities took four photographs of her, inspected Scurich&#x27;s computer, and stapled a &quot;control document&quot; into her passport; it required that she leave Canada within 48 hours.

===2016 North Dakota access pipeline protests===

In September 2016, Goodman covered the Dakota Access Pipeline protests in Morton County, North Dakota; footage from her reporting &quot;showed security personnel pepper-spraying and siccing attack dogs on demonstrators.&quot; After &quot;Democracy Now!&quot; aired the footage, she was charged by state prosecutor Ladd Erickson with criminal trespass. After the court dismissed that charge, Erickson charged her with riot, gaining a warrant for her arrest. Erickson said that Goodman acted as &quot;a protester&quot; rather than a journalist, because &quot;Everything she reported on was from the position of justifying the protest actions.&quot;

Goodman turned herself in to the Morton County sheriff on October 17, saying that she would be fighting the charges against her as a &quot;clear violation&quot; of the First Amendment, which guarantees freedom of the press. She was supported by the Committee to Protect Journalists, which issued a statement saying: &quot;This arrest warrant is a transparent attempt to intimidate reporters from covering protests of significant public interest. [...] Authorities in North Dakota should stop embarrassing themselves, drop the charges against Amy Goodman, and ensure that all reporters are free to do their jobs.&quot; Steve Andrist, executive director of the North Dakota Newspaper Association, also expressed concern that a journalist was one of only two people covered by an arrest warrant from the day in question. Authorities said that Goodman was charged because she was identified from the video footage.

On October 17, 2016, the case was dismissed by District Judge John Grinsteiner, of the South Central Judicial District, who found no probable cause to support a riot charge. The charges against Goodman reportedly increased the public awareness of the Dakota Access Pipeline protests. Goodman had presented that day&#x27;s &quot;Democracy Now!&quot; broadcast from in front of the Morton County Courthouse. Reporter Deia Schlosberg was arrested in similar circumstances while reporting on pipeline-related protests.

==Awards and honors==
Goodman has received awards for her work, including the Robert F. Kennedy Prize for International Reporting (1993, with Allan Nairn) and the George Polk Award (1998, with Jeremy Scahill). In 1999, she declined to accept the Overseas Press Club Award, in protest at the group&#x27;s pledge not to ask questions of keynote speaker Ambassador Richard Holbrooke and because the OPC was honoring Indonesia for its improved treatment of journalists despite the fact that its forces had recently beaten and killed reporters in occupied East Timor.

She received the 2001 Joe A. Callaway Award for Civic Courage.

On October 2, 2004, she was presented the Islamic Community Award for Journalism by the Council on American-Islamic Relations. On November 18, 2004, she was presented the Thomas Merton Award. In 2006, she received the Puffin/Nation Prize for Creative Citizenship.

Goodman was a recipient of the 2008 Right Livelihood Award. The Right Livelihood Award Foundation cited her work in &quot;developing an innovative model of truly independent grassroots political journalism that brings to millions of people the alternative voices that are often excluded by the mainstream media&quot;.

On March 31, 2009, Goodman, with Glenn Greenwald, received the first Izzy Award (named after journalist I. F. &quot;Izzy&quot; Stone) for &quot;special achievement in independent media&quot;. The award is presented by Ithaca College&#x27;s Park Center for Independent Media.

In May 2012, she received an honorary Doctor of Letters degree from DePauw University in recognition of her journalistic work. She also received the Gandhi Peace Award from Promoting Enduring Peace, for a &quot;significant contribution to the promotion of an enduring international peace&quot;.

On May 16, 2014, she received an honorary Doctor of Letters degree from Purchase College, SUNY in recognition of her progressive journalism.

In February 2015, she (and Laura Poitras) received the 2014 I.F. Stone Lifetime Achievement Award from the Nieman Foundation for Journalism at Harvard.

In 2016, Goodman and &quot;Democracy Now!&quot; (along with Laura Gottesdiener, John Hamilton and Denis Moynihan) received a Sigma Delta Chi Award for excellence in journalism from the Society of Professional Journalists in the category of Breaking News Coverage (Network/Syndication Service/Program Service) for their piece, “Standoff at Standing Rock: Epic Native resistance to Dakota Access Pipeline.”

On February 14, 2019, she, and others, received the Frederick Douglass 200 award and was honored at the Library of Congress in Washington, D.C. The Frederick Douglass 200 award is a project of the Frederick Douglass Family Initiatives and the Antiracist Research and Policy Center at American University in Washington D.C. In October 2023, the NY Peace Action Network recognized her with the William Sloane Coffin &quot;Peacemaker Award&quot;.

==Personal life==
In September 2007, Goodman suffered a bout of Bell&#x27;s palsy. She practices yoga.

<text>Skyclad is a British heavy metal band heavily influenced by folk. They are considered pioneers of folk metal. The term &quot;skyclad&quot; originates from a pagan/wiccan concept referring to ritual nudity, where rituals are performed with participants metaphorically clothed only by the sky, symbolising equality. The name reflects both the band&#x27;s religious inclinations and their social beliefs, as expressed in the song &quot;Skyclad&quot; on their debut album.

== History ==
The band was founded in 1990 by former Sabbat vocalist Martin Walkyier and Satan/Pariah guitarist Steve Ramsey, following Walkyier&#x27;s departure from Sabbat due to a disagreement with guitarist Andy Sneap regarding the band&#x27;s musical direction. Their goal was to form the &quot;ultimate pagan metal band,&quot; initially envisioning ideas like traditional Robin Hood costumes, though these concepts were soon abandoned. They completed the lineup with another ex-Pariah member, bassist Graeme English, and drummer Keith Baxter. The band signed with the German record label Noise International and released their debut album, &quot;The Wayward Sons of Mother Earth&quot; in 1991. The album cover was designed by Garry Sharpe-Young.

Following a tour with Overkill, they added Fritha Jenkins on violin and keyboards, along with a second guitarist, Dave Pugh, a friend of Baxter’s. This expanded lineup allowed for a more folk-influenced sound on their 1992 follow-up album, &quot;A Burnt Offering for the Bone Idol&quot;. Their early work continued with the release of &quot;Jonah&#x27;s Ark&quot; in 1993. In 1994, the band released &quot;Prince of the Poverty Line&quot;, during which Cath Howell replaced Fritha Jenkins, who had left to have a baby. Howell had filled in during the &quot;Jonah&#x27;s Ark&quot; tour, as Jenkins had initially planned to return but later decided not to, making Howell a permanent member.

Howell later resumed her studies and was replaced by Georgina Biddle for the 1995 album &quot;The Silent Whales of Lunar Sea&quot;. Afterward, both Baxter and Pugh left the band, leaving them short of members and generally unable to tour. However, they did replace Tiamat on the Black Sabbath &quot;Forbidden&quot; UK tour in 1995, while recording &quot;Irrational Anthems&quot;, which was released early the following year.

&quot;Oui Avant-Garde á Chance&quot; was recorded over the course of a year and, like &quot;Irrational Anthems&quot;, featured studio/session drummer Paul AT Kinson. &quot;The Answer Machine?&quot; followed in 1997 with Kinson on drums, but the band still lacked a permanent drummer. In 1998, Jay Graham and guitarist Kevin &quot;Riddler the Fiddler&quot; Ridley—who had previously served as the band&#x27;s producer, background vocalist, and singer/guitarist in the punk band Forgodsake—joined the lineup, just in time to record &quot;Vintage Whine&quot;, released in 1999. 
The lineup remained stable during the recording of 2000&#x27;s &quot;Folkémon&quot;, but founding member Walkyier departed from the band in 2001, citing various reasons, including financial difficulties and the band&#x27;s reluctance to tour in South America due to security concerns as the final straw. Other band members noted that Walkyier&#x27;s somewhat acerbic personality contributed significantly to the group&#x27;s lineup instability. After leaving, Walkyier went on to form The Clan Destined. For many fans, Walkyier&#x27;s lyrics and delivery style were central attractions, leading to fears that his departure might spell the end for the band. 

After replacing drummer Jay Graham—who left shortly after Walkyier—with drummer Arron Walton, and moving Kevin Ridley to vocals, the group aimed to alleviate these fears with 2002&#x27;s &quot;No Daylights... Nor Heel Taps&quot;, which featured studio recordings of &quot;Irish Pub versions&quot; of Skyclad classics by the new lineup. This release was preceded by the single &quot;Swords of a Thousand Men&quot; in 2001. The single&#x27;s title track, originally recorded by Tenpole Tudor, also appeared on &quot;Folkémon&quot; as a bonus track, albeit in a different version. The single included two recordings of the title track: one featuring Ridley on vocals and another with Ridley sharing vocals with Tenpole Tudor&#x27;s frontman Edward Tudor-Pole. The single and album releases were accompanied by &quot;The Same...But Different&quot; tour, the largest Skyclad had undertaken in many years. Additionally, in 2001, the band&#x27;s former record label released &quot;Another Fine Mess&quot;, which included live recordings from 1995 and the contents of the &quot;Outrageous Fourtunes&quot; EP.

After some disagreements between Walkyier and the other band members regarding copyrights and royalties for his lyrics, as well as the release of tracks featuring him, 2004&#x27;s &quot;A Semblance of Normality&quot; marked the band&#x27;s first new material following Walkyier&#x27;s departure. The album&#x27;s style closely resembled that of previous releases, with Ridley&#x27;s lyrics making a concerted effort to maintain similar themes and styles to Walkyier&#x27;s while also establishing an individual identity.

In 2006, Skyclad self-released an EP titled &quot;Jig-a-Jig&quot;. A new album was planned for the same year, but Black Lotus Records went out of business just a few months after Skyclad had signed with them.

The band&#x27;s twelfth studio album, &quot;In The... All Together&quot;, was released in spring 2009 via Scarlet Records.

In June 2012, Walkyier announced that a band called &quot;Martin Walkyier&#x27;s Skyclad&quot; would be headlining a festival in Nottingham, England, in September of that year.

Skyclad&#x27;s 13th studio album, &quot;Forward Into The Past&quot;, was released on 28 April 2017 via Listenable Records. This album is notable for being the first since 1995&#x27;s &quot;Silent Whales of Lunar Sea&quot; to feature second guitarist Dave Pugh, who returned to Skyclad as a full member in 2014.

<doc id="372416" wikidata="Q4849464" url="?curid=372416" title="Bakkah">
<text>Bakkah ( ), is a place mentioned in &quot;surah&quot; 3 (&#x27;Āl &#x27;Imrān), &quot;ayah&quot; 96 of the Qur&#x27;an, a verse sometimes translated as: &quot;Indeed, the first House [of worship] established for mankind was that at Bakkah [i.e., Makkah] - blessed and a guidance for the worlds.&quot; ()

According to Muslim scholars Bakkah is an ancient name for Mecca, the most holy city of Islam. (The word Mecca is only used once in the Quran in verse (&quot;And it is He who withheld their hands from you and your hands from them within [the area of] Makkah after He caused you to overcome them. And ever is Allāh, of what you do, Seeing.&quot;))

Most Muslims believe Mecca and Bakkah are synonyms, but to Muslim scholars there is a distinction: Bakkah refers to the Kaaba and the sacred site immediately surrounding it, while Mecca is the name of the city in which they are both located.

According to Lisān al-&#x27;Arab of Ibn Manẓūr, the site of the Kaaba and its surroundings was named Bakkah due to crowding and congestion of people in the area. The Arabic verb bakka (بَكَّ), with double &quot;k&quot;, means to crowd like in a bazaar. This is not to be confused with another unrelated Arabic verb bakā (بَكَىٰ) (single k) which is the past tense of yabkī (يَبْكِي), to cry.

== Islamic tradition ==
Islamic tradition identifies Bakkah as the ancient name for the site of Mecca. An Arabic word, its etymology, like that of Mecca, is obscure.

One meaning ascribed to it is &quot;narrow&quot;, seen as descriptive of the area in which the valley of the holy places and the city of Mecca are located, pressed in upon as they are by mountains. Widely believed to be a synonym for Mecca, it is said to be more specifically the early name for the valley located therein, while Muslim scholars generally use it to refer to the sacred area of the city that immediately surrounds and includes the Kaaba.

The form Bakkah is used for the name Mecca in the Quran in , while the form Mecca is used in . In South Arabic, the language in use in the southern portion of the Arabian Peninsula at the time of Muhammad, the &quot;b&quot; and &quot;m&quot; were interchangeable. The Quranic passage using the form Bakkah says: &quot;Surely the first House ˹of worship˺ established for humanity is the one at Bakkah—a blessed sanctuary and a guide for ˹all˺ people.&quot; Other references to Mecca in the Quran (, ) call it &quot;Umm al-Qura&quot;, meaning &quot;mother of all settlements&quot;.

In Islamic tradition, Bakkah is where Hagar (Hājar) and Ishmael (Ismā&#x27;īl) settled after being taken by Abraham (Ibrāhīm) to the wilderness, a story comparable to the Book of Genesis (21:14-21). Genesis tells that Abraham gave Hagar food and a skin of water, but that Hagar and Ishmael ran out of water to drink in the outskirts of Beersheba. In Arab tradition, Hagar runs back and forth between Safa and Marwa—two elevated points—seven times to search for help before sitting down in despair, at which point an angel appeared and hit the ground with his heel (or his wing) and caused a miraculous well to spring out of the ground.&lt;br&gt; However, the account in Genesis focuses more about the outcasting of Hagar, the mother of Ishmael and an Egyptian slave to Sarah (Abraham&#x27;s wife and half sister in Genesis), from Abraham (who remains in Beersheba) due to Ismael provoking Sarah on the day of Isaac&#x27;s weaning, and she travels alone with Ismael, who she later gets an Egyptian wife for during their stay at the Desert of Paran. Unlike Arab tradition, Genesis accounts that Hagar set a dying Ismael underneath a bush and then sat down a bowshot distance&#x27;s away as to not watch him die, and when he began to cry, God called from Heaven to Hagar to take Ismael and continue traveling, where then he opened her eyes, revealing a well.

The Islamic tradition holds that a spring gushed forth from the spot where Hagar had laid Ishmael, and this spring came to be known as the Well of Zamzam. When Muslims on hajj run between the hills of Safa and Marwah seven times, it is to commemorate Hagar&#x27;s search for help and the resulting revelation of the well of Zamzam.

In addition to the Islamic tradition that Hagar and Ishmael settled in Bakkah, the Quran relates that Abraham came to Mecca to help his son Ishmael build the Kaaba adjacent to the well of Zamzam. 

Ibn Ishaq, the 8th-century Arab Muslim historian, relates that during the renovation of Kaaba undertaken by the Quraysh before Islam, found an inscription in one of the corners of the foundation of the building that mentions Bakkah. Composed in Syriac, it was incomprehensible to the Quraysh until a Jew translated it for them as follows: &quot;I am Allah, the Lord of Bakka. I created it on the day I created heaven and earth and formed the sun and the moon, and I surrounded it with seven pious angels. It will stand while its two mountains stand, a blessing to its people with milk and water.&quot;

The name Bakkah is woven into the kiswa, the cloth covering the Kaaba that is replaced each year before the Hajj.

== Valley of the Bakha ==
The Valley of the Bakha ( &quot;Emeq haBakha&quot;, ), or the Valley of Bakha, also transliterated as &quot;Baka&quot; or &quot;Baca&quot;, is mentioned in , in the following passage: 
The composition of the psalm is credited to the Sons of Korah, a Levite clan which regularly performed musical compositions for David and in the First Temple.&lt;br&gt;
The same Hebrew word בכא (&quot;bakha&quot;) is associated with a battle accounted in and in which took place on the Valley of Rephaim, about 4–7 kilometers southwest of the present-day Old City of Jerusalem. In the accounts, David is advised to engage the Philistines in battle when he hears the sound of marching in the tops of the bakha trees.

Muslims see the mention of a pilgrimage to the Valley of Bakha in the passage as a reference to Mecca, similar to the Quran in 3:96. Some also draw connections of the passage &quot;they make it a place of springs&quot; to the Book of Genesis&#x27; account of how Hagar the Egyptian has a well revealed to by God in the outskirts of Beersheba, presumably on the way to Bakkah.&lt;br&gt;
In Judaism and in Christianity, there are other interpretations of the psalm.&lt;br&gt;
One Jewish interpretation is based on how the psalm is composed by Levites, a tribe of Israel which are not given inherited land amongst the other tribes, but rather travel—particularly as shepherds—between the lands of the other tribes (&quot;They go from strength to strength&quot;) and have priesthood responsibilities as their inheritance (&quot;every one of them in Zion appeareth before God&quot;), and as they travel, they bring pasture to desolated lands, such as a valley of bakha trees which served as a battlefield between Israel and Philistia. In this interpretation, the psalm gives glory to the Tribe of Levi and praises their inheritance of priesthood (&quot;whose strength is in thee&quot;) over an inheritance of land.

Another Jewish interpretation states that the psalm is a celebration of pilgrimage to the Temple (at this time, the First Temple), and that the psalmist desires to be in the Temple—the Presence of God—and details steps of the way to Jerusalem, where it is located. On the way, the pilgrims may pass through the Valley of Bakha, which could be synonymous with the Valley of Rephaim, as it is a valley where bakha trees grow according to . Here, the phrase &quot;also blessing the first rain will give&quot; refers to the beginning of winter in the region of Israel—the first rains—suggesting that the pilgrimage is for the festival of Sukkot, when prayers of rain are offered.
If this is the case, the psalm may be based on , which is also traditionally a psalm about a pilgrimage to Jerusalem for Sukkot, which is credited to David.&lt;br&gt;

Another interpretation, which is used by Jews and Christians, links the psalm as a successor to , which are also credited to the Sons of Korah. In the earlier psalms, they are seen as lamentations from being away from Zion and in the presence of enemies, who give taunts about the psalmist being away from Zion and being rejected by God, and cries about the weakness of the soul deficient in faith are given. Linking with Psalms 84, the same psalmist would praise the presence of God which is at Zion, and yearns to be there as well. As the psalmist is away, he writes about the pilgrimage back to Jerusalem, where dry and desolate places like the Valley of Bakha may be encountered, but it will be enlightened by the pilgrims, and treated it as if they were places of springs; finding refuge through hardship—the rains are the responses by God through faith during the troubling times. After the pilgrimage, the pilgrims are congregated in the presence of God, where prayers are offered.

Still, many Jews and Christians utilize the alternative translation of &quot;bakha&quot; into &quot;tears&quot;, which has been practiced since Greek translations and continued throughout Latin and English translations. In this—unlike בכה (&quot;bakhah&quot;), which is translated to &quot;cry&quot;—בכא (&quot;bakha&quot;) would translate to &quot;tears&quot;, as a Biblical Hebrew counterpart to the common Modern Hebrew word for &quot;tears&quot;, דמעות (&quot;dema&#x27;oth&quot;). This still exists with modern translations which strongly reference the Masoretic Text of the psalm, including ones outside of English. The name עמק הבכא (&quot;Emek haBakha&quot;) is also used for the loosely-related Valley of Tears, located in the Golan Heights which received its name during the Yom Kippur War.

The word &quot;Bakha&quot; (Biblical Hebrew: *𐤁𐤊𐤀 ) is pronounced in terminal stress, unlike &quot;Bakkah&quot;, which is penultimately stressed. Although both &quot;Bakha&quot; and &quot;Bakkah&quot; are of Semitic origin, they are composed of different abjad letters: b-kh-&#x27; (Bet-Kaph-Aleph) for Hebrew, and b-k-h (Bet-Kaph-He) for Arabic. &quot;Bakha&quot; is commonly recorded to have only been used twice throughout all of Biblical Hebrew; both instances, one of which is plural (הַבְּכָאִים , &quot;habekha&#x27;im&quot;), are dated to the same era and associate considerably with the land of Israel, while &quot;Bakkah&quot; is a &quot;hapax legomenon&quot; of the Quran that directly associates with a Bronze Age location, which is traditionally located in the southern region of the Hejaz.&lt;br&gt;

A literal translation is &quot;Valley of the Bakha&quot;, although the translations into Biblical Greek assumed it to be the similar-sounding word בכה (&quot;bakhah&quot;), &quot;crying&quot;, and translates it as ἐν τῇ κοιλάδι τοῦ κλαυθμῶνος (&quot;Valley of Mourning&quot;, &quot;Valley of Weeping&quot;).

== Revisionist and source critical views ==
Tom Holland and Patricia Crone, both revisionist scholars of early Islamic history, postulate that Mecca and Bakkah might not be different spelling variations of the same area, a view commonly held by historical and modern Islamic authors, but rather Bakkah existed in another place.

Holland, in his 2012 book &quot;In the Shadow of the Sword&quot;, states that Bakkah must have been located somewhere near Byzantine Empire&#x27;s southern frontier, citing Mecca before Islam being absent in Byzantine records of Hejaz, Quran mentioning Byzantine military expeditions and Quranic imagery (such as &quot;Mušrikūn&quot; having cattle and gardens of vines, olives, and pomegranates) being vastly different from desert regions of Mecca and being more in line with wetter Syria-Levant region.

Although he asserts that it&#x27;s not possible to ascertain where Bakkah had exactly stood during the early Islamic history, he later postulates the region of Mamre as a possible location, currently located in the West Bank. He identifies Mamre as an ancient Arabic pilgrimage site, citing a mid-7th century account by a Nestorian chronicler that parallels the Quranic description. He also proposes “Maqam Ibrahim,” two words mentioned in the Quran along with Bakkah, which can be translated as &quot;the place where Abraham stood,&quot; not being a stone as it has been identified in the Islamic tradition, but rather he interprets the sentence hinting at the possible Levantine location of Bakkah.

Another theory, coined as the Mecca–Petra Theory—or simply the Petra Theory—by the development of it from Dan Gibson, suggests that the original location of Bakkah is Petra, a historical city which was located in Arabia Petraea, which is also situated in the Levant instead of the modern location of Mecca. The major point of the theory is that the qibla of early mosques face Petra more accurately than Mecca. Others have challenged the notion of comparing modern readings of qibla directions to early mosques’ qiblas as they claim early Muslims could not accurately calculate the direction of the qibla to Mecca and so the apparent pinpointing of Petra by some early mosques may well be coincidental.

<text>The 1960 Valdivia earthquake and tsunami () or the Great Chilean earthquake (&quot;Gran terremoto de Chile&quot;) occurred on 22 May 1960. Most studies have placed it at 9.4–9.6 on the moment magnitude scale, while some studies have placed the magnitude lower than 9.4, making it the most powerful earthquake ever recorded. It occurred in the afternoon (19:11:14 GMT, 15:11:14 local time), and lasted 10 minutes. The resulting tsunamis affected southern Chile, Hawaii, Japan, the Philippines, eastern New Zealand, southeast Australia, and the Aleutian Islands.

The epicenter of this megathrust earthquake was near Lumaco, approximately south of Santiago, with Valdivia being the most affected city. The tremor caused localised tsunamis that severely battered the Chilean coast, with waves up to . The main tsunami traveled across the Pacific Ocean and devastated Hilo, Hawaii, where waves as high as were recorded over from the epicenter.

The death toll and monetary losses arising from this widespread disaster are not certain.
Various estimates of the total number of fatalities from the earthquake and tsunamis have surfaced, ranging between 1,000 and 6,000 killed. Different sources have estimated the monetary cost ranged from 400million to $800million (or billion to $billion in , adjusted for inflation).

== Geologic context ==

Chile is located along the Pacific Ring of Fire, a known zone of high seismicity. The earthquake was a megathrust earthquake resulting from the release of mechanical stress between the subducting Nazca plate and South American plate on the Peru–Chile Trench, off the coast of southern Chile. Because of its geography, Chile remains one of the most seismically active countries in the world. 
=== Tectonic interpretation ===

The focus of the earthquake was relatively shallow at , considering that earthquakes in northern Chile and Argentina may reach depths of .

A 2019 research paper postulates that the Liquiñe-Ofqui fault had a 9.07 strike-slip subevent along with the 9.37 main thrust sub-event which could help account for how the plate boundary event seemingly &quot;overspent&quot; its tectonic budget. In other words, the previous and current more widely accepted explanation for the earthquake involves the Peru-Chile Trench slipping further than its accumulated slip deficit (the amount of slip available for an earthquake) should allow. The alternative explanation, with two faults slipping nearly simultaneously, could help explain the true mechanism of the earthquake.

Subduction zones are known to produce the strongest earthquakes on Earth, as their particular structure allows more stress to build up before energy is released. Geophysicists consider it a matter of time before this earthquake will be surpassed in magnitude by another. The earthquake&#x27;s rupture zone was long, stretching from Arauco (37° S) to below the Chiloé Archipelago (44° S). Rupture velocity, the speed at which a rupture front expands across the surface of the fault, has been estimated as per second. The average slip across all 27 Nazca subfaults was estimated to be , with of slip south of the epicenter on offshore subfaults.

While the Valdivia earthquake was extraordinarily large, the 2016 Chiloé earthquake hints that it did not release all the potential slip in that segment of the plate interface.

==Earthquake sequence==
===Concepción earthquakes===

The 1960 Chilean earthquakes were a sequence of strong earthquakes that affected Chile between 21 May and 6 June 1960, centered in the Araucanía, Aysén, and Bío Bío regions of the country. The first three quakes, all registering in the planet&#x27;s top 10 by magnitude for 1960, are grouped together as the 1960 Concepción earthquakes. The first of these was the 8.1 Mw Concepción earthquake at on 21 May 1960. Its epicenter was near Curanilahue. Telecommunications to southern Chile were cut off and President Jorge Alessandri cancelled the traditional ceremony of the Battle of Iquique memorial holiday to oversee the emergency assistance efforts. The second and third Concepción earthquakes occurred the next day at (7.1 Mw) and (7.8 Mw) on 22 May. These earthquakes formed a southward migrating foreshock sequence to the main Valdivia shock, which occurred just 15 minutes after the third event.

The earthquake interrupted and effectively ended a protest by coal miners from Lota, who were attempting to march to Concepción to demand higher salaries.

=== Valdivia earthquake ===
The Valdivia earthquake occurred at 15:11 UTC-4 on 22 May, and affected all of Chile between Talca and Chiloé Island, more than . Coastal villages, such as Toltén, were struck. At Corral, the main port of Valdivia, the water level rose before it began to recede. At 16:20 UTC-4, a wave of struck the Chilean coast, mainly between Concepción and Chiloé. Another wave measuring was reported ten minutes later.

Hundreds of people were already reported dead by the time the tsunami struck. One ship, &quot;Canelo&quot;, starting at the mouth of the Valdivia River, sank after being moved backward and forward in the river; as of 2005, its mast was still visible from the road to Niebla.

Soil subsidence also destroyed buildings, deepened local rivers and created wetlands in such places as the Río Cruces and Chorocomayo, a new aquatic park north of the city. Extensive areas of the city were flooded. The electricity and water systems of Valdivia were totally destroyed. Witnesses reported underground water flowing up through the soil. Despite the heavy rains of 21 May, the city was without a water supply. The river turned brown with sediment from landslides and was full of floating debris, including entire houses. The lack of potable water became a serious problem in one of Chile&#x27;s rainiest regions.

The earthquake did not strike all the territory with the same strength; measured with the Mercalli scale, tectonically depressed areas suffered heavier damage. The two most affected areas were Valdivia and Puerto Octay, near the northwest corner of Llanquihue Lake. Puerto Octay was the center of a north–south elliptical area in the Central Valley, where the intensity was at the highest outside the Valdivia Basin. East of Puerto Octay, in a hotel in Todos los Santos Lake, stacked dishes were reported to have remained in place. With the exception of poor building sites, the zone of Mercalli scales intensities of VII or more all lay west of the Andes in a strip running from Lota (37° S) southwards. The area of intensities of VII or more did not penetrate into the Central Valley north of Lleulleu Lake (38° S) and south of Castro (42.5° S). Two days after the earthquake Cordón Caulle, a volcanic vent close to Puyehue volcano, erupted. Other volcanoes may also have erupted, but none were recorded because of the lack of communication in Chile at the time. The relatively low death toll in Chile (5,700) is explained in part by the low population density in the region, and by building practices that took into account the area&#x27;s high geological activity.

Earthquake lights were reported in Purén.

=== Aftershocks ===
One of the main aftershocks occurred on 6 June in Aysén Region. This magnitude 7.7 earthquake probably occurred along the Liquiñe-Ofqui Fault, meaning that the fault would have moved as a consequence of the 22 May Valdivia earthquake.

==Natural disasters==
===Tsunamis===

Earthquake-induced tsunamis affected southern Chile, Hawaii, Japan, the Philippines, China, eastern New Zealand, southeast Australia, and the Aleutian Islands. Some localized tsunamis severely battered the Chilean coast, with waves up to . The main tsunami crossed the Pacific Ocean at a speed of several hundred km/h and devastated Hilo, Hawaii, killing 61 people. Most of the tsunami-related deaths in Japan occurred in the northeast Sanriku region of Honshu.

The Chilean coast was devastated by a tsunami from Mocha Island (38° S) to Aysén Region (45° S). Across southern Chile, the tsunami caused huge loss of life, damage to port infrastructure, and the loss of many small boats. Further north, the port of Talcahuano did not suffer any major damage, only some flooding. Some tugboats and small sailboats were stranded on Rocuant Island near Talcahuano.

In Valdivia the tsunami swell penetrated along Calle-Calle River as far as Huellelhue putting afloat piles of firewood that lay in the fields.

After the 21 May Concepción earthquake, people in Ancud sought refuge in boats. A carabinero (police) boat, &quot;Gloria&quot;, was towing a few of these boats when the second earthquake struck on 22 May. As the sea regressed &quot;Gloria&quot; became stranded between Cerro Guaiguén and Cochinos Island. The stranded boat was wrecked when a tsunami wave engulfed it.

All the new infrastructure of the small port of Bahía Mansa was destroyed by the tsunami, which reached heights of up to 10 metres above sea level there. The boat &quot;Isabella&quot; in Bahía Mansa quickly left the port but lost its anchors.
In the Valdivia River and Corral Bay, several vessels were wrecked by the earthquake, among them &quot;Argentina&quot;, &quot;Canelo&quot;, &quot;Carlos Haverbeck&quot;, &quot;Melita&quot;, and the salvaged remnants of &quot;Penco&quot;. &quot;Canelo&quot; was anchored at Corral when the quake struck, filling a cargo of wood and other products destined for northern Chile. The engine of &quot;Canelo&quot; was warmed up after the earthquake. After hours of drifting around in Corral Bay and Valdivia River, the ship was wrecked and subsequently abandoned by its crew at 1800 local time. Two men on board &quot;Canelo&quot; died in the incident. As of 2000, the remnants of &quot;Canelo&quot; were still visible.

&quot;Santiago&quot;, another ship anchored at Corral at the time of the quake, managed to leave Corral in a bad state but was wrecked off the coast of Mocha Island on 24 May. The schooner &quot;La Milagrosa&quot; departed from Queule on 22 May to load a cargo of &quot;Fitzroya&quot; wood shingles in a small port south of Corral. &quot;La Milagrosa&quot; was battered by the currents and waves of the tsunami for four days while moving south. Outside Corral the crew rescued six nearly unconscious and dehydrated children on board two boats. The boats found were used to navigate in Valdivia River and Corral Bay but had drifted into the high sea.
The coastal localities of Mississippi and Mehuín were struck by the tsunami causing the loss of fishing boats. 150 boats, most of them used for fishing are reported to have &quot;disappeared&quot; in Mehuín. Some kilometres north of Mahuín at the coastal town of Queule, a carabinero reported hundreds of people dead or missing some days after the tsunami. Historians Yoselin Jaramillo and Ismael Basso report that people in Queule decades later know about 50 people to have died because of the earthquake and tsunami.

===Landslides===

The earthquake triggered numerous landslides, mainly in the steep glacial valleys of the southern Andes. Within the Andes, most landslides occurred on forested mountain slopes around the Liquiñe-Ofqui Fault. Some of these areas remain sparsely vegetated while others have naturally developed more or less pure stands of &quot;Nothofagus dombeyi&quot;. These landslides did not cause many fatalities nor significant economic losses because most of the areas were uninhabited, with only minor roads.

One landslide caused destruction and alarm following its blockage of the outflow of Riñihue Lake (see below). About south of Riñihue Lake, landslides in the mountains around Golgol River caused the river to dam up; when it burst through the earthen dam, it created a flood down to Puyehue Lake. The Golgol landslides destroyed parts of international Route 215-CH, which connects to Bariloche in Argentina through Cardenal Antonio Samoré Pass.

While most landslides clustered around north–south strips in the Andes, other areas that were affected by large numbers of landslides were the coast, mainly the foot of the Chilean Coast Range, and the shores of Llanquihue Lake.

===Seiches===
A seiche (type of standing wave) of more than 1 meter was observed on Panguipulli Lake following the earthquake. On 22 May, a seiche occurred also in Nahuel Huapi Lake, on the Argentine side of the Andes, more than 200 km away from Valdivia. The wave, most likely produced by an earthquake-triggered sediment slide at the lake bottom, killed two people and destroyed a pier in San Carlos de Bariloche city.

===Riñihue Lake&#x27;s flood===

During the Great Chilean earthquake, several landslides west of Tralcán Mountain blocked the outflow of Riñihue Lake. Riñihue Lake is the lowest of the Seven Lakes chain and receives a constant inflow from the Enco River. The blocked San Pedro River, which drains the lake, passes through several towns before reaching the city of Valdivia near the coast.

As the San Pedro River was blocked, the water level of Riñihue Lake started to rise quickly. Each meter the water level rose was equivalent to 20 million cubic meters, which meant that 480 million cubic meters of water would release into the San Pedro River (easily overpowering its flow capacity of per second if it rose above the final, 24-meter-high dam. This potential disaster would have violently flooded all the settlements along the course of the river in less than five hours, with more dire consequences if the dam suddenly broke.

About 100,000 people lived in the affected zone. Plans were made to evacuate Valdivia, and many people left. To avoid the destruction of the city, several military units and hundreds of workers from ENDESA, CORFO, and MOP started an effort to control the lake. Twenty-seven bulldozers were put into service, but they had severe difficulties moving in the mud near the dams, so dykes had to be constructed with shovels from June onwards. The work was not restricted to the lake; drainages from other parts of the Seven Lakes were dammed to minimize additional flow into Riñihue Lake. These dams were removed later, with the exception of Calafquén Lake, which still retains its dam.

By 23 June, the main dam had been lowered from , allowing 3 billion cubic metres of water to leave the lake gradually, but still with considerable destructive power. The team was led by ENDESA engineer Raúl Sáez.

===Cordón Caulle eruption===
On 24 May, 38 hours after the main shock of the 1960 Valdivia earthquake, the Cordón Caulle volcano erupted. The eruption was believed to have been triggered by the earthquake. Between two sparsely populated and isolated Andean valleys, the eruption had few eyewitnesses and received little attention by local media, which was preoccupied with the severe and widespread damage and losses caused by the earthquake. The eruption was first noticed and reported as an explosion by the crew of a United States Air Force plane that was heading to Santiago from Puerto Montt.

The eruption fed a 5.5 km-long fissure on 135° heading where 21 individual vents have been found. These vents produced an output of about 0.25 km3 DRE both in form of lava flows and tephra. The eruption ended on 22 July, 59 days later.

As a result of an evacuation plan, there were no reported human deaths associated with the eruption.

==Consequences and response==
===Urban impact===

The levels of material damage were relatively low despite the high magnitude of the earthquake. Part of the reason behind this was the limited infrastructure development of the region next to the rupture zone. Structures that had been designed to resist earthquakes performed well during the earthquake, chiefly suffering damage when affected by soil subsidence or small fault movements. Houses built by their owners fared badly. In the regions of Maule and Bío Bío, houses built from adobe and masonry proved weak, while from Araucanía to the south weak houses were mainly those built with inappropriate wood that had decayed over time.

It has been estimated that about 40 percent of the houses in Valdivia were destroyed, leaving 20,000 people homeless. The most affected structures were those built of concrete, which in some cases collapsed completely, because they were not built using modern earthquake engineering. Traditional wooden houses fared better; although many were uninhabitable if they did not collapse. Houses built upon elevated areas suffered considerably less damage compared to those on the lowlands, which absorbed great amounts of energy. Many city blocks with destroyed buildings in the city center remained empty until the 1990s and 2000s, with some of them still used as parking lots. Before the earthquake, some of these blocks had modern concrete buildings built after the Great Valdivia fire of 1909. Around the main city square most buildings collapsed except for Edificio Prales and a few others.

The hospital of Valdivia, built in 1939, suffered major damage and patients had to be evacuated. The United States quickly set up a field hospital following the earthquake. Aided by the United States, a geological survey of Valdivia was done following the earthquake and resulted in the city&#x27;s first geological map. Mexico built and donated the public school &quot;Escuela México&quot; after the earthquake.

Valdivia&#x27;s bridges suffered only minor damage. The damage caused to Calle-Calle Bridge led to its temporary closure after the earthquake, with traffic redirected to Teja Island through Caucau River where people crossed it on boats and, reportedly, also a rudimentary and temporary wooden bridge.

Land subsidence in Corral Bay improved navigability as shoal banks, produced earlier by sediments from Madre de Dios and other nearby gold mines, sank and were compacted. As the earthquake destroyed Valdivia&#x27;s flood barriers, general land subsidence exposed new areas to flooding. Parts of the botanical garden of the Austral University of Chile that were next to Cau-Cau River and the city&#x27;s southern outskirts along Route 206 were permanently flooded.

The earthquakes damaged an area that had suffered a long period of economic decline, which began with shifts in trade routes due to the expansion of railroads in southern Chile and the opening of the Panama Canal in 1914.

Unlike Valdivia, Osorno was saved from major destruction. In Osorno only about 20 houses were totally destroyed, although many firewalls and chimneys collapsed.

Puerto Montt, a major city today, had in the early 1960s about 49,500 inhabitants. The bulk of the damage in Puerto Montt was located in the neighborhood of Barrio Modelo and the northern part of Bahía Angelmó, where artificial fills subsided. Angelmó and other coastal areas of Puerto Montt were among the few urban areas that suffered &quot;total destruction&quot; by the earthquake.

After the earthquake a myth related the unusually warm and clear weather conditions prior to the earthquake to its triggering. When compared with the years that followed in the 1960s the autumn of 1960 in southern Chile was not particularly dry nor warm.

===Impact in the countryside===

The tsunami that struck the coast of southern Chile destroyed seaside farms, killing numerous livestock and people. Barns and industrial structures were destroyed by the quake. The dairy industry was among the few industries of the affected zone that received subsidies and investment after the earthquake. It received state support through a long-term policy after the earthquake.

As a result of the earthquake, an international technological cooperation programme was established in the dairy sector. More specifically, the German and Danish governments helped to create the &quot;Centro Tecnológico de la Leche&quot; (the Milk Technological Centre) in the Southern University of Chile. The scholar Erik Dahmén believes that the earthquake resulted in a &quot;creative destruction&quot; for farmers of Southern Chile.

A large area of former pastures and cultivated fields around the lower course of Cruces River was permanently flooded as a result of c. 2 m of subsidence caused by the earthquake. Over the years the new wetlands were colonized chiefly by &quot;Egeria densa&quot; (). &quot;Egeria densa&quot; and other plants created a rich aquatic ecosystem that attracted a permanent bird fauna, notably black-necked swans. The protected area of Carlos Anwandter Nature Sanctuary was created in 1981 to protect the ecosystem.

A whole neighbourhood of Corral, Corral Bajo was wiped by the tsunami, while the nearby upper area, Corral Alto, suffered the loss of about 20 to 30% of its houses. Among the material loses were a series stilt houses between Corral Bajo and Amargos. After the earthquake many families in Corral relocated to the neighbourhood of La Aguada.

The economy of the coastal town of Queule had during the 1950s developed significantly. Its economy based on fishing, agriculture and industry had grown. Queule was connected by road in 1957 to the rest of the country and the town had developed into a balneario (resort town). This era of prosperity ended with the 1960 earthquake.

Further north the earthquake destroyed numerous houses in the coal-mining town of Lebu.

The coal mine of Pupunahue suffered severe damage which led to coal production recovering to &quot;acceptable levels&quot; only by 1963.

===Creation of a national emergency management agency===
After the earthquake, the Chilean Ministry of Economics began to develop a comprehensive reconstruction plan. The efforts of President Alessandri led to the creation of a new institutionality in order to facilitate future emergency preparation and to tackle the country&#x27;s recovery after the earthquake. The then-newly named Ministry of Economics and Reconstruction was given the task of coordinating rebuilding efforts in joint venture with CORFO, an existing Chilean agency for the promotion of economic growth. Concomitantly, a ministerial-level committee, COPERE (&quot;Comisión de Planificación de la Economía y de Reconstrucción&quot;), was officially named as the government&#x27;s Planning and Reconstruction Committee. CORFO acted the secretariat of the committee and was entrusted with the preparation of the reconstruction plan and its detailed execution. COPERE had also been entrusted with coordinating provincial activities while CORFO remained the technical secretariat of those provincial committees. A comprehensive national plan for emergencies that helped Chile better prepare for future disasters was enacted, in conjunction with legislation that increased the powers of the President in times of national emergency. CORFO also created the National Company of Telecommunications (ENTEL) out of a pressing need to improve and modernize communication efforts in times of disaster.

In 1974, after the 1971 eruption of Villarrica volcano, COPERE was officially succeeded by ONEMI (Ministry of Interior National Emergency Office)—Chile&#x27;s modern-day emergency management agency—when it was authorized by law as an independent governmental office by President Salvador Allende.

===Human sacrifice===
In the coastal village Collileufu (La Araucanía Region), native Lafkenches carried out a human sacrifice during the days following the main earthquake. Collileufu is located in the Budi Lake area, south of Puerto Saavedra, which was highly isolated in 1960. The Mapuche spoke primarily Mapudungun. The community had gathered in Cerro La Mesa, while the lowlands were struck by successive tsunamis. Juana Namuncura Añen, a local machi, demanded the sacrifice of the grandson of Juan Painecur, a neighbor, in order to calm the earth and the ocean. The victim was 5-year-old José Luis Painecur, an &quot;orphan&quot; (&quot;huacho&quot;) whose mother had gone to work as a domestic worker in Santiago and left her son under the care of his father.

The sacrifice was learned about by authorities after a boy in the commune of Nueva Imperial denounced to local leaders the theft of two horses; these were allegedly eaten during the sacrifice ritual. Two men were charged with the crime of murder and confessed, but later recanted. They were released from prison after two years. A judge ruled that those involved had &quot;acted without free will, driven by an irresistible natural force of ancestral tradition&quot;. The story was mentioned in a &quot;Time&quot; magazine article, although with little detail.

== Previous and subsequent earthquakes ==
An earthquake of similar magnitude occurred in this area around 1800 BC, as has been determined by dating charcoal and shells washed into the Atacama Desert by the tsunami. This apparently caused the hunter-gatherers of the area to stop living near the coast for the next thousand years or so.

There is evidence that a similar earthquake and landslide occurred in 1575 in Valdivia. This earthquake was of similar strength and also caused a Riñihuazo. According to the chronicle of Mariño de Lobera, corregidor of Valdivia in 1575, a landslide blocked the outflow of the lagoon of Renigua. Several months later in April, it caused a flood. He said that the Spanish settlers had evacuated and waited on high ground until after the dam burst, but many aboriginals died in the flood waters. While the 1575 earthquake is considered the one most similar to that of 1960, it differed in not having caused any tsunami in Japan.

Other lesser earthquakes that preceded the 1960 event occurred in 1737 and 1837.

On 27 February 2010 at 03:34 local time, an 8.8 magnitude earthquake occurred just to the north (off the coast of the Maule region of Chile, between Concepción and Santiago). This quake was reported to be centered approximately deep and several miles off shore. It may have been related or consequential to the 1960 Valdivia quake, the strongest as recorded using modern technology. This 2010 earthquake was the largest to affect Valdivia since the 1960 event. Thirty five houses were severely damaged and some 44 other suffered reparable damage. A survey showed that 434 persons in Valdivia had their homes damaged by the earthquake. The damages were to areas of poor soil quality, chiefly former wetlands and artificial fills. Some sidewalks near the river shore in Valdivia cracked and collapsed much like in the 1960 earthquake. Overall the 2010 damages in Valdivia were few and highly localized.

<text>Chang Chen (born 14 October 1976) is a Taiwanese actor. He is best known for his roles in &quot;A Brighter Summer Day&quot; (1991), &quot;Happy Together&quot; (1997), &quot;Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon&quot; (2000), &quot;Three Times&quot; (2005), &quot;Brotherhood of Blades&quot; (2014), &quot;The Assassin&quot; (2015) and &quot;The Soul&quot; (2021). For his performance in &quot;The Soul&quot;, he won Best Leading Actor prize at the 58th Golden Horse Awards.

==Career==
Chang started his film career at a young age. He was selected by a Taiwanese film director Edward Yang to be the protagonist of a four-hour-long critically acclaimed film &quot;A Brighter Summer Day&quot;, which won the Special Jury Prize at the Tokyo International Film Festival. After the first film, he took a part-time job at a film company and worked there for two years until he graduated from high school.

One of the earliest films Chang acted in was Wong Kar-wai&#x27;s &quot;Happy Together&quot; (1997). He rose to fame for his role as &quot;Dark Cloud&quot; in the 2000 film &quot;Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon&quot;, directed by Ang Lee. He also featured in Wong Kar-wai&#x27;s &quot;2046&quot; (2004).

Chang then co-starred with Shu Qi in Hou Hsiao-hsien&#x27;s &quot;Three Times&quot; (2005), which competed for the Palme d&#x27;Or at the 2005 Cannes Film Festival and won Golden Horse accolades for Outstanding Taiwanese Film of the Year, among other awards. For his performance in that film, Chang was also nominated for Best Leading Actor at the 42nd Golden Horse Awards.

In 2006, Chang was nominated for the Golden Horse Award for Best Leading Actor for his role in &quot;The Go Master&quot;, a dramatisation of the life of the Go master Wu Qingyuan. The following year, Chang made his Korean debut in Kim Ki-duk&#x27;s &quot;Breath&quot;, which competed for the Palme d&#x27;Or at the 2007 Cannes Film Festival.

Chang then starred in the historical war epic &quot;Red Cliff&quot; (2008-2009), portraying the warlord Sun Quan. He was nominated at the Hong Kong Film Awards for Best Supporting Actor. He next starred in the 2012 historical epic &quot;The Last Supper&quot; directed by Lu Chuan and the 2013 kungfu epic &quot;The Grandmaster&quot; by Wong Kar-wai.

In 2014, Chang headlined the wuxia film &quot;Brotherhood of Blades&quot;, which won commercial success and critical acclaim. He earned his third nomination for Best Actor in the Golden Horse Awards.

Chang reunited with &quot;Three Times&quot; director Hou Hsiao-hsien and co-star Shu Qi in the 2015 wuxia film &quot;The Assassin&quot;, which competed for the Palme d&#x27;Or at the Cannes Film Festival.

In 2017, Chang played the title character in the action film &quot;Mr. Long&quot;, which was selected to compete for the Golden Bear in the main competition section of the 67th Berlin International Film Festival. The same year, he returned for the second installment of &quot;Brotherhood of Blades&quot; film.

Chang served as a jury member at the 2018 Cannes Film Festival.

In 2021, Chang played Dr. Wellington Yueh in Denis Villeneuve&#x27;s epic science fiction film &quot;Dune&quot;. which premiered at the 78th Venice International Film Festival. In the same year, he won Best Leading Actor at the 58th Golden Horse Awards for his performance in the mystery film &quot;The Soul&quot;, marking his first Golden Horse Award after three previous nominations without a win.

Chang served as a jury member at the 59th Golden Horse Awards in 2022.

In June 2023, Chang was invited to become a member of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.

<text>Production equipment control involves production equipment that resides in the shop floor of a manufacturing company and its purpose is to produce goods of a wanted quality when provided with production resources of a required quality. In modern production lines the production equipment is fully automated using industrial control methods and involves limited unskilled labour participation. Modern production equipment consists of mechatronic modules that are integrated according to a control architecture. The most widely known architectures involve hierarchy, polyarchy, hetaerarchy and hybrid. The methods for achieving a technical effect are described by control algorithms, which may or may not utilize formal methods in their design.</text><links>

<text>Epping Forest is a area of ancient woodland, and other established habitats, which straddles the border between Greater London and Essex. The main body of the forest stretches from Epping in the north, to Chingford on the edge of the London built-up area. South of Chingford the forest narrows, and forms a green corridor that extends deep into east London, as far as Forest Gate; the forest&#x27;s position gives rise to its nickname, the &quot;Cockney Paradise&quot;. It is the largest forest in London.

It lies on a ridge between the valleys of the rivers Lea and Roding. It contains areas of woodland, grassland, heath, streams, bogs and ponds, and its elevation and thin gravelly soil (the result of glaciation) historically made it less suitable for agriculture. The forest was historically managed as a common; the land was held by a number of local landowners who exercised economic rights over aspects such as timber, while local commoners had grazing and other rights. It was designated a royal forest meaning that only the monarch had the right to hunt deer.

The extensive urban areas on the forest&#x27;s doorstep bring many visitors to the forest, and cause a strain on the forest&#x27;s ecology; however local recreational users of the forest were crucial in saving the forest when it was threatened with enclosure and destruction in the late 19th century. The huge public outcry led the City of London Corporation to buy and so save the site in what was the first major success of the environmental movement in Europe – the Corporation still owns the forest. This environmental milestone came at a cost, as the City of London&#x27;s early conservators did not understand the human processes that shaped the forest and its ecosystems, and discontinued the practice of pollarding trees while allowing grazing to decline. This changed the character of the forest and has led to reduced biodiversity. The modern Conservators are mindful of these historic errors but it is probably not possible to reverse the effects of this long interruption of historic management methods. 

The forest gives its name to the Epping Forest local government district, which covers part of it, and to Forest School, a private school in Walthamstow towards the south of it.

==The history of Epping Forest==
===Early history===

The area that became Epping Forest has been continuously wooded since Neolithic times. Embankments of two Iron Age hill forts – Loughton Camp and Ambresbury Banks – can be found in the woodland, but pollen profiles show that Iron Age occupation had no significant effect on woodland cover. The former small leaved lime (also known as pry or linden) dominated woodland permanently changed during the Anglo-Saxon period, possibly as a result of the selective cutting of trees. Today&#x27;s beech-birch and oak-hornbeam-dominated forest may be the result of partial forest clearance in Saxon times.

===Management of the forest===
The area is thought to have been given legal status as a royal forest by Henry II in the 12th century. At the time it was part of the much larger Forest of Essex, which covered nearly all of the county. The term Forest was a legal term, meaning that Forest Law applied, meaning that only the king had the right to hunt deer. The term did not mean the land was well wooded: the large majority of the &quot;Forest of Essex&quot; was agricultural land.

The &quot;Forest of Essex&quot; gradually shrank in size as land was removed from Forest Law and it was replaced by a number of much smaller forests including Waltham Forest (which gives its name to the modern London Borough of Waltham Forest. &quot;Waltham Forest&quot; was a legally defined area which included the areas later known as Epping Forest and Hainault Forest; the rest of the &quot;Waltham Forest&quot; area was only lightly wooded.

In physical terms (rather than legal terms), the Forest is thought to have declined to something like its modern extent in the early fourteenth century (possibly long before), the Black Death reached England in 1348, leading to a huge decline in population, perhaps between a third and a half, which took away the pressure on woods and commons, leading to a very long period of stability in the area of these land uses in England. At that time the forest extended slightly further south to the &quot;Romford Road&quot; in the Forest Gate area of West Ham; this is the originally Roman A118 road from Aldgate on the City of London wall to Stratford, Romford and Colchester (and also known as the &quot;Great Essex Road&quot;). There was a coppice woodland on the &quot;Romford Road&quot; called &quot;Hamfrith Wood&quot; (meaning the woodland belonging to the Ham area) until around 1700, and an area of plain called &quot;Hamfrith Waste&quot; which lasted into the mid-1800s.

Most of &quot;Waltham Forest&quot; was later legally deforested (removed form Forest Law) leaving two smaller forests, Epping Forest and Hainault Forest, both of which continued to be very heavily wooded - there was not a reduction in the physical area of woods and commons. The name &quot;Epping Forest&quot; was first recorded in the 17th century.

Although the monarch held hunting and associated rights, the land was owned by a number of local landowners. It was managed as a common where landowners benefitted from certain rights, while local commoners benefitted from common rights allowing them to gather firewood and foodstuffs, to graze livestock and turn out pigs for mast.

The landscape was primarily a mixture of wood-pasture and open plains, rather than thick woodland, and both of these land use types were grazed by cattle.
===Queen Elizabeth&#x27;s Hunting Lodge===
In Tudor times, Henry VIII and Queen Elizabeth I may have hunted in the forest, though no documentary evidence has survived to prove it. In 1543, Henry commissioned a building, known as Great Standing, from which to view the chase at Chingford. The building was renovated in 1589 for Queen Elizabeth I and can still be seen today in Chingford. The building is now known as Queen Elizabeth&#x27;s Hunting Lodge, and is open to the public. There is another hunt standing, which now forms the core of the forest HQ at The Warren, Loughton.

===17th to 19th centuries===

Following the Restoration of the Monarchy in 1660, although the deer herd was restocked, royal hunting in the forest never recommenced. The forest was principally used as a source of shipbuilding timber for the Royal Navy, which was taken overland to Barking Creek and then floated in rafts to the Royal Dockyards at Woolwich and Deptford. This exploitation continued until about 1725, when all the suitable oak trees had been felled.

The City of London maintained the ancient tradition of an Easter Monday stag hunt in the forest, but official participation ended in 1807 when the office of Master of the City Hounds was abolished. In 1827, the huntsman of Sir William Pole-Tylney-Long-Wellesley chased a forest stag as far as West Ham. The customary Easter Monday hunt was repeated annually by a large and rowdy crowd of ordinary London tradesmen and working people, who gathered at Fairmead Oak to chase a previously captured stag, which was released from a cart and usually escaped unharmed. The last of these hunts was in 1882 when it descended into a riot and had to be dispersed by the police.

In the 1830s, the forest took its first significant harm in centuries when a new road, the &quot;Epping New Road&quot; was built through the forest, to supplement pre-existing ancient roads. In 1830, civil engineer James Nicoll McAdam, the son of John Loudon McAdam, was engaged by a turnpike trust, the Epping and Ongar Highway Trust, to construct a road from Woodford Green to Epping through the heart of the forest, to avoid Goldings Hill on the old road through Loughton and shorten the distance by one mile. The &quot;Epping New Road&quot;, once part of the A11 and now part of the A104 was completed in 1834.

With the arrival of railway stations in towns close to the forest from the 1850s, the working class people of East London began to use the forest for recreation on Sundays and public holidays, in ever increasing numbers. Others arrived by horsebus which could drive directly to popular spots like High Beach. On Whit Monday 1880, a parliamentary committee estimated that up to 400,000 people had visited Epping Forest on that day.

===Fighting enclosure===
In the first decades of the 19th century, the Lord Warden of Epping Forest, William Long-Wellesley, acquiesced to the enclosure of of forest land, about a third of the remaining total, by the lords of the manors who held freeholds in the forest. The government was keen to enclose land for farming and building development and allowed the Commissioners of Woods, Forests and Land Revenues to sell off further freeholds in the forest.

In 1851 nearby Hainault Forest, where the Crown owned most of the land, was privatised (enclosed) and nearly all of the trees grubbed out in order to turn the area into poor quality farmland. The modern conservation movement grew out of public disgust at the destruction of Hainault Forest and the need to protect its &quot;sister forest&quot;, Epping Forest. Epping Forest had fragmented ownership which made it harder to enclose in the same way, though individual landowners began to make encroachments. The urbanisation of nearby areas increased the forest&#x27;s importance as an area of public recreation helped lead to the establishment of the Open Spaces Society in 1865, whose aim was to protect commons in and around London. The Mile End branch, founded in the February of that year, was particularly important in mobilising East End environmentalism.

By 1870, the unenclosed forest had shrunk to only . One landowner, Reverend John Whitaker Maitland, who had enclosed in his manor of Loughton, was engaged in a long running dispute with a commoner called Thomas Willingale and his family, who insisted on maintaining his right to lop trees in the forest, despite inducements offered for him to stop. The matter came to the public attention in 1866, when Willingale&#x27;s son and two nephews were fined for damaging Maitland&#x27;s trees, and were sent to prison for seven days when they refused to pay. Willingale was encouraged to continue the dispute by Edward Buxton and other members of the Commons Preservation Society, however a court action against Maitland lapsed in 1870 when Willingale died.

In July 1871, around 30,000 East Londoners gathered on Wanstead Flats to protest about fences which had been erected there by Earl Cowley to enclose forest land. Despite clashes with police, including a mounted element, the crowd were able to break down and smash the enclosing fences. The action attracted nationwide attention, much of it critical of the government. At this stage the City of London Corporation became involved, since in 1853, the city had purchased a farm at Manor Park for the construction of the City of London Cemetery; this made the City Corporation a forest commoner with the right to graze cattle in the forest. In 1871, the City brought a suit against 16 of the lords of the forest manors, claiming that the enclosures impinged on their ancient grazing rights. Following an appeal in 1874, a judgment by the Master of the Rolls, Sir George Jessel, ruled that all enclosures made since 1851 were illegal. Subsequently, two acts of Parliament in 1871 (34 &amp; 35 Vict. c. 93) and 1872 (35 &amp; 36 Vict. c. 95) allowed the city to purchase the 19 forest manors. The consequence of this victory was that only 10% of Epping Forest had been lost to enclosure (mainly in the south), compared to 92% of Hainault Forest.

Under the terms of the Epping Forest Act 1878, the forest ceased to be a royal forest and was purchased by the City of London Corporation whose Epping Forest Committee act as Conservators. The committee is composed of twelve members of the Court of Common Council and four Verderers who are residents of the forest and are elected by the Commoners. A Superintendent is responsible for operational management, supported by twelve Epping Forest Keepers. In addition, the Crown&#x27;s right to venison was terminated, and pollarding was no longer allowed, although grazing rights continued. This act laid down a stipulation that the Conservators &quot;shall at all times keep Epping Forest unenclosed and unbuilt on as an open space for the recreation and enjoyment of the people&quot;. In compensation for the loss of lopping rights, Lopping Hall in Loughton was built as a community building. This was the first major victory, in Europe, for the modern conservation movement.

===&quot;The People&#x27;s Forest&quot;===
When Queen Victoria visited Chingford on 6 May 1882 she declared &quot;It gives me the greatest satisfaction to dedicate this beautiful forest to the use and enjoyment of my people for all time&quot; and it thus became &quot;The People&#x27;s Forest&quot;. The City of London Corporation still manages Epping Forest in strict conformity with the Epping Forest Act. This care is funded from &#x27;City&#x27;s Cash&#x27;, the private funds of the Corporation rather than any money for its upkeep coming from local rates or taxes. The Conservators administer the forest from The Warren, modern offices built in the grounds of Grade II* listed Warren House, Loughton. Warren House, formerly known as the Reindeer Inn, was built around a smaller hunt standing, known as the Little Standing. Its grounds were redesigned by Humphry Repton in the early 19th century.

Until the outbreak of BSE in 1996 commoners still exercised their right to graze cattle and every summer herds of cattle would roam freely in the southern part of the forest. Cattle were reintroduced in 2001 but their movements are now more restricted to reduce conflict with traffic. Commoners, who are people who live in a Forest parish and own of land, can still register and graze cattle during the summer months.

The right to collect wood still exists but is rarely practised and is limited to &quot;one faggot of dead or driftwood&quot; per day per adult resident.

Originally a barn built in the mid-19th century the Grade II listed building Butler&#x27;s Retreat is one of the few remaining Victorian retreats within the forest. The building, which is adjacent to the Queen Elizabeth Hunting Lodge, takes its name from the 1891 occupier John Butler. Retreats originally served non-alcoholic refreshments as part of the Temperance movement. After closing in 2009 the building was refurbished by the City of London Corporation and re-opened as a café in 2012.

On 12 July 2012 The Duke of Gloucester—the official Epping Forest Ranger—opened the View interpretation centre at Chingford. The building, a former Victorian coach house and stables, together with Queen Elizabeth&#x27;s Hunting Lodge and Butler&#x27;s Retreat form the Epping Forest Gateway.

==Geography==

The forest is approximately long in the north–south direction, but no more than from east to west at its widest point, and in most places considerably narrower. The main body of the forest stretches from Epping in the north, to Chingford on the edge of the London built-up area. South of Chingford the forest narrows, and forms a green corridor that extends deep into East London, as far as Forest Gate. The southern part of the forest was always narrower but enclosure and other destruction in the 19th and 20th centuries mean that this is now more pronounced. The southernmost point of the Forest is now Wanstead Flats but it formerly extended slightly further south, to the Romford Road.

The forest occupies a ridge of higher ground, the Epping Forest Ridge, set between the valleys of the Rivers Lea and Roding. These valleys were formed by arms of the Scandinavian ice sheet during the last glacial period, around 18,000 BC. The ridge consists of boulder clay topped with loam, while towards its southern end it is overlain with glacial gravel. The highest points are near Ambresbury Banks to the south of Epping, which is 111 metres (384 feet) above sea level, while Pole Hill near Chingford reaches 91 metres (299 feet). On the western edge of the ridge, High Beach at a similar height, is an expanse of gravel and Bagshot sand, thought to have been deposited by an unknown river which flowed northwards from the Weald of Kent before the creation of the Thames Valley.

The following is a simplified list of the various parts of Epping Forest, starting from the north:

*Lower Forest; a triangular expanse of oak and hornbeam wood just north of the town of Epping which separates it from the main body of the forest.
*Bell Common and Epping Thicks; the forest area directly to the south of Epping. Bell Common includes a cricket pitch, the M25 motorway passes underneath enclosed in a tunnel. Epping Thicks is the location of Ambresbury Banks Iron Age fort.
*Genesis Slade; an area of unpollarded beech, oak and hornbeam on the eastern edge of the forest towards Theydon Bois.
*Great Monk Wood; a large area of pollarded beech and hornbeam astride the Epping New Road, reaching the outskirts of Loughton in the east.
*High Beech; an open sandy ridge to the west of the forest, with views to Waltham Abbey and across the Lea Valley.
*Bury Wood and Chingford Plain; the southwestern part of the main forest extending to Chingford, where the plain includes a golf course.
*Knighton Wood and Lords Bushes; an isolated area of forest at Buckhurst Hill, the former being previously landscaped parkland which was added to the forest in 1930.
*Hatch Forest and Highams Park; a strip of forest extending south from Chingford along the River Ching. Highams Park Lake was designed by Humphry Repton in 1794 and was added to the forest in 1891.
*Woodford Green; an area of grassland lined by trees, including a cricket pitch.
*Walthamstow Forest and Gilbert&#x27;s Slade a continuation of the forest southwards from Woodford Green, straddling the North Circular Road and extending towards Whipps Cross.
*Leyton Flats; stretch between Snaresbrook, Whipps Cross and the Green Man at Leytonstone. Largely open grassland with the Eagle and Hollow Ponds.
*Bush Wood and Wanstead Flats; extend east from Leytonstone towards Forest Gate and Manor Park. Mostly open grassland featuring football pitches and several ponds.
*Wanstead Park; an enclosed area of the forest with restricted opening; formerly the landscaped parkland of Wanstead House demolished in 1825, the park was added to the forest in 1880.
==Ecology and habitats==
The age of the forest and the range of habitats it contains make it a valuable area for wildlife, and it is designated as a Site of Special Scientific Interest. Its former status a common, with wood-pasture and plains has had a great effect on its ecology. Although the Epping Forest Act almost certainly saved the forest from total destruction, it has to some extent had a deleterious effect on the area&#x27;s biodiversity.

===Wood pasture===
The areas historic land use has had an enormous impact on the areas character and ecology, this is particularly evident with the pollarded trees, which were cut back to the &quot;bolling&quot;, the permanent base of the pollard, every 13 years or so. The bolling was cut just above the browse line of wild and domestic grazing animals. However, the Forests pollards have not been cut since the passing of the Epping Forest Act, have now grown massive crowns of thick, trunk-like branches with correspondingly large boles. This gives the trees an unusual appearance, uncommon in other forests. Often the weight of the branches cannot be supported by the parent tree, and the large amount of dead wood in the forest supports numerous rare species of fungi and invertebrates. Epping Forest has 55,000 ancient trees, more than any other single site in the United Kingdom.

Predominant tree species are Pedunculate oak (&quot;Quercus robur&quot;), European beech (&quot;Fagus sylvatica&quot;), European hornbeam (&quot;Carpinus betuloides&quot;), silver birch (&quot;Betula pendula&quot;) and European holly (&quot;Ilex aquifolium&quot;). Indicator species of long-uninterrupted woodland include service-tree (&quot;Sorbus torminalis&quot;) butcher&#x27;s-broom (&quot;Ruscus aculeatus&quot;) and drooping sedge (&quot;Carex pendula&quot;).

The pollarded trees allowed light through to the woodland floor, increasing the numbers of low-growing plants. Since the Act, the vast crowns of the pollards cut out most of the light to the underbrush.

===Plains===
The plains were located in wet or low-lying areas. The area surrounding the forest is now to a great extent urbanised; the corresponding reduction in grazing has led to some former areas of grassland and heathland being overcome by secondary woodland.

===Restoration work===
In recent years, the Conservators have experimented with pollarding in selected areas of the forest, lopping some old pollards back to the bolling (with mixed results) or creating new bollings. A herd of English Longhorn cattle has been reintroduced to graze the heathland and grassland.

===Lakes and ponds===

Over 100 lakes and ponds can be found within the forest varying in size and age. They all provide important habitats for numerous species of fauna and flora. Many of them are man-made with the majority of them created through gravel extraction. Several were formed as part of a landscape design and a few were the result of Second World War bombs and V-2 rockets. Activities allowed on the waters include angling which is permitted in 24 of the lakes and ponds. A wide range of freshwater fish can be caught. All of the lakes and ponds are accessible to the public and are located on or close to forest paths.

===Fauna===
A wide range of animals are found, including fallow deer (&quot;Dama dama&quot;), muntjac (&quot;Muntiacus reevesi&quot;) and European adder (&quot;Vipera berus&quot;).

====Deer====
The fallow deer found in Epping Forest are of an unusual black colouration, perhaps descended from some black deer presented by King Christian IV of Denmark to James I in 1612, although there are earlier records of black deer in England before this date. By 1878 when the Epping Forest Act gave the deer firm legal protection, poaching had reduced the herd to twelve does and one buck; however, numbers had recovered to around 200 by the start of the 20th century. In 1954, it was noted that common lighter-brown fallow deer had begun to interbreed in the forest and some black examples were sent to Whipsnade Zoo to preserve this variety. Subsequently, losses to traffic and dogs prompted the establishment of an enclosed deer sanctuary of near Debden, to maintain a stock of deer which can be released back into the forest when the population levels become too low.

Red deer were once found in Epping Forest, but the last survivors were rounded-up and taken to Windsor Great Park at the end of the 19th century. The last recorded sighting of roe deer in the forest was in 1920. In recent decades, Reeves&#x27;s muntjac have been reported in the southern part of the forest. The announcement of licensed culling of fallow deer and muntjac in forest &quot;buffer land&quot; in 2016 was criticised by local residents but defended by environmentalists as necessary to prevent over-grazing of woodland undergrowth.

==Planning designations==
* Most of the forest, an area of is a Site of Special Scientific Interest 
* The forest is a Special Area of Conservation.
* Most of the Forest is part of the Metropolitan Green Belt.
* Much of the Forest is designated as Metropolitan Open Land.

==Leisure activities==
A wide variety of leisure activities associated with the forest, most notably rambling, cycling and horse riding.
Epping Forest attracts large numbers of mountain bikers. Mountain biking is generally permitted except around the Iron Age camps, Loughton Brook and other ecologically or geomorphologically sensitive areas. Despite clear signposting, a minority of mountain bikers and horse riders continue to cause damage in these areas, and the Conservators of Epping Forest have expressed their concern. A number of clubs organise rides, particularly on Sunday mornings. The forest is also used as a training area for many national level mountain-bike racers as it is highly regarded for its fast and tight flowing single track trails. This type of terrain is known within the mountain bike fraternity as cross country (or XC). Epping Forest was considered as a venue for the mountain-biking event of the 2012 Summer Olympics, though the final choice was near Hadleigh Castle. Stage 3 of the 2014 Tour de France passed through the forest from Epping to Buckhurst Hill along the Epping New Road.

Horse riding is popular in Epping Forest. Riders need to be registered with the Epping Forest conservators before they are allowed to ride in the forest. Running as a form of recreation in Epping Forest goes back almost to the birth of the sport in the 1870s, including hosting the inaugural English Championships in 1876. Orienteering and rambling are also popular. There are numerous guidebooks offering shorter walks for the casual visitor. The most important event in the ramblers&#x27; calendar in the area is the traditional Epping Forest Centenary Walk, an all-day event commemorating the saving of Epping Forest as a public space, which takes place annually on the third Sunday in September.

High Beach in Epping Forest was the first British venue for motorcycle speedway and opened on 19 February 1928. The track was behind The King&#x27;s Oak public house, and drew large crowds in its early days. The track was closed when a swimming pool was added to the pub&#x27;s grounds after the Second World War, though enthusiasts and veterans still gather at the site every year on the nearest Sunday to 19 February. The remains of the track are still visible, in the grounds of the Epping Forest Field Centre behind the King&#x27;s Oak. The field centre in the forest, run by Field Studies Council provides a variety of courses.

There are 60 pitches for football with changing facilities on forest land at Wanstead Flats, which are used by amateur and youth teams. There is a public 18-hole golf course at Chingford Plain, which is also used by the Royal Epping Forest Golf Club, Chingford Golf Club and Chingford Ladies&#x27; Golf Club. The course was established in the forest in 1888. Cricket is played on forest land at Woodford Green, Bell Common (Epping), Buckhurst Hill, and High Beach. One historic match is recorded in the forest in 1732 between London Cricket Club and an Essex &amp; Hertfordshire side. The result is unknown. The match is the earliest known reference to both Essex and Hertfordshire as county teams.

==Visitor centres==

The forest has three visitor centres:
*Epping Forest Visitor Centre at Paul’s Nursery Road, High Beach, managed by the Epping Forest Heritage Trust 
*Epping Forest Gateway at Ranger&#x27;s Road, Chingford
*The Temple in Wanstead Park

== Public transport ==
Public transport serves most locations in and around the forest. The forest is accessible from most London Underground Central Line stations between Leytonstone and Epping and London Overground between Wood Street and Chingford and at the very southern end by the Elizabeth line at Manor Park.

In the 1980s, the name &quot;Forest&quot; was given to one of the districts in which London&#x27;s buses was divided, covering east London, and including the south part of the forest. Its logo was a squirrel above the London Transport roundel. Later, from 1989 until its collapse in 1991, London Forest part of London Buses Limited, was the name of an arms length bus operating unit of London Regional Transport in the area, with an oak tree as its logo.

==Cultural associations==
Epping Forest has frequently been the setting for novels, and has attracted poets, artists and musicians for centuries. Many of these artists lived at Loughton. Loughton is also home to the East 15 Acting School and its Corbett Theatre.

===Fine art===
Sculptor Jacob Epstein lived on the very edge of the forest for a quarter of a century at Baldwins Hill, Loughton. Epstein in his Autobiography (1955) says that he wanted his sculpture &quot;Visitation&quot;, now in the Tate Collection, to be sited overlooking the forest. In 1933, he exhibited 100 paintings of the forest, and continued to paint during the war. His gouache, an essay in green tints and textures, &quot;Pool – Epping Forest&quot;, of Baldwins Hill Pond, was exhibited in 1945. Many of his forest painting are in the Garman Ryan Collection at the New Art Gallery, Walsall

===Literature===
Elizabethan poets such as George Gascoigne and Thomas Lodge lived in and around the forest. The writer Lady Mary Wroth lived at Loughton Hall. Ben Jonson, best known for his satirical play &quot;The Alchemist&quot;, was a frequent visitor to the forest with George Chapman.

In Daniel Defoe&#x27;s novel A Journal of the Plague Year (1722), a group of Londoners try to escape the plague by settling in and around Epping Forest.

In the 18th century, Mary Wollstonecraft, writer, philosopher and feminist, spent the first five years of her life growing up in the forest.

In the 19th century, the poet and humorist Thomas Hood published &quot;The Epping Hunt&quot; in 1829, about the rowdy annual Easter Monday deer hunt for Londoners which started at Buckhurst Hill. In 1832, Hood and his wife moved to the Lake House in Wanstead Park, which was later incorporated into the forest, and his 1838 novel &quot;Tylny Hall&quot; is set there. Charles Dickens&#x27; novel &quot;Barnaby Rudge&quot; begins with a description of the forest in 1775. Alfred, Lord Tennyson lived at Beech Hill House, High Beach, from 1837 to 1840, where he wrote parts of &quot;In Memoriam A.H.H.&quot;. Suffering from depression, he stayed as a guest at Dr. Martin Allen&#x27;s asylum, where he would have encountered poet John Clare, whose behaviour became so erratic that he was removed to the asylum in 1837. William Morris, artist, writer and socialist, was born in Walthamstow in 1834, and spent his early years in what was then rural Essex, close to the outlying sections of the forest. Arthur Morrison, &quot;the English Zola&quot;, lived successively at Chingford, Loughton, and High Beach in the forest, and – particularly in &quot;To London Town&quot; – the forest is used as a contrast to the East London deprivation he wrote about. Horace Newte, his contemporary and friend, lived at Loughton and Theydon Bois. Rudyard Kipling and Stanley Baldwin spent a seminal long holiday as boys in Loughton adjacent to the Forest, which they loved. This has been documented in detail by Janice Lingley in her &quot;Loughton Idyll&quot; (Alderton Press 2020).

The poet Edward Thomas was posted to a temporary army camp at High Beach when he enlisted in the Artists&#x27; Rifles in 1915. Although the conditions in the camp were squalid, Thomas enjoyed the forest and the following year moved with his wife to a cottage at Paul&#x27;s Nursery, close to High Beach. One of his last poems, &quot;Out in the dark&quot;, was written at High Beach at Christmas 1916, shortly before he was killed in France.

During the 20th century, several writers used the forest as a setting for their novels, including R. Austin Freeman&#x27;s &quot;The Jacob Street Mystery&quot; (1940), partly set at Loughton Camp. Dorothy L. Sayers&#x27; 1928 mystery &quot;Unnatural Death&quot; includes the discovery, in Epping Forest, of the body of a young woman possessing knowledge that could incriminate a murderer. The horror writer James Herbert used Epping Forest as the setting for his novel &quot;Lair&quot; (1979). In the book, a horde of Giant Black Rats establish a colony in the forest and embark on a murderous campaign against humans. Herbert mentions a now obscure legend attached to the forest – the legend of the white stag. Supposedly, the sighting of this animal is an omen of trouble and death. Natural historian and author Fred J Speakman lived at the Epping Forest Field Studies Centre, High Beach. He wrote several books about the area, including &quot;A Poacher&#x27;s Tale&quot; with Alfred T Curtis, a Waltham Abbey-born poacher, and &quot;A Keeper&#x27;s Tale&quot;, describing the life of forest keeper Sidney Butt.

T. E. Lawrence owned an estate at Pole Hill, Chingford; this was added to the Forest in 1929 and Lawrence&#x27;s hut re-erected in the Forest Headquarters at the Warren, Loughton, where it remains, largely forgotten, today.

Actor and playwright Ken Campbell (1941–2008) lived in Loughton, adjacent to Epping Forest; his funeral took the form of a woodland burial in the forest.

===Music===
The song &quot;The White Buck of Epping&quot; by Sydney Carter (1957) refers to a sighting of (and subsequent hunt for) a white buck in the forest.

A track on Genesis&#x27; 1973 album &quot;Selling England by the Pound&quot; is entitled &quot;The Battle of Epping Forest&quot;, and refers to a real-life East End gang-fight.

The interior of the gatefold sleeve of the progressive rock band Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer&#x27;s third studio album Trilogy features a photomontage showing multiple images of the band in the forest carpeted with autumn leaves.

The Wings album &quot;London Town&quot; includes the song &quot;Famous Groupies&quot; (written by Paul McCartney) with the lyrics, &quot;There was a lead guitarist / Who lived in Epping Forest / And all he ever wanted was to blow&quot;.

Damon Albarn&#x27;s song &quot;Hollow Ponds&quot; (2014) is based on his memories of locals swimming at Hollow Ponds in Epping Forest in the heat wave of 1976, and other childhood memories of the area.

===Television===
The forest featured heavily in an episode of Living TV&#x27;s &quot;Most Haunted Live&quot; over New Year 2003/2004 as the team, made up of Yvette Fielding and Derek Acorah, investigated the forest in the hope of discovering the spirit of Dick Turpin. The team got lost in the forest live on air, and a ranger was required to find them.

In the British BBC soap opera screened in February 1999, &quot;EastEnders&quot;, fictional character Steve Owen (Martin Kemp) accidentally killed his stalker Saskia Duncan (Deborah-Sheridin Taylor). He later panicked and buried her body in the forest. It was discovered 10 months later.

An episode of the BBC series &quot;New Tricks&quot; which was set in the forest was broadcast on 3 September 2013.

In the episode &quot;Day Trippers&quot; of the Thames Television sitcom &quot;Robin&#x27;s Nest&quot;, first broadcast on 27 November 1978, the main characters picnic in the forest.

The forest was featured in the BBC programme &quot;Countryfile&quot; broadcast on 21 June 2020 presented by Anita Rani.

===Cinema===
As of 2013, Epping Forest has been used as a location in fourteen films including the Black Knight sequence in the 1975 film &quot;Monty Python and the Holy Grail&quot;.

==Crime==

The forest has long standing criminal associations. In the 18th century, Epping Forest became notorious as the haunt of highwaymen, who preyed on the coaches of wealthy racegoers on the road from London to Newmarket. Dick Turpin and Tom King used the forest as a hideaway, and Jack Rann, known as &quot;Sixteen String Jack&quot;, had a pub named after him in Theydon Bois. Turpin had a hideout there. The tree cover and the forest&#x27;s location close to London have made it notorious as a burial area for murder victims. Triple policeman murderer Harry Roberts hid out in the forest for a short time before his arrest in 1966.

===Murders===

* 1966 – Marian Hartley, a 15-year-old schoolgirl, was killed by Joseph Kiely, 20. Kiely dragged Hartley into the forest late at night, in the Chingford area, where he sexually assaulted her and strangled her, after she had been to a school dance.
* 1970 – The bodies of Susan Blatchford (eleven years old) and Gary Hanlon (twelve years old) were discovered in a copse on Lippitts Hill, after they went missing from their homes in Enfield, north London, in March 1970. The case was to be known as the &#x27;Babes in the Wood&#x27; murders. Thirty years later, Ronald Jebson, already serving a life sentence for the 1974 murder of eight-year-old Rosemary Papper, confessed to the murders.
* 1981 – The thin decomposed 6 ft body of a white European man aged 30–40 was found in the undergrowth in the forest. He had a money belt containing English and Spanish money and wore a watch, costing approximately £40. The body remains unidentified.
* 1989 – Terence Gooderham, an accountant, and his girlfriend, Maxine Arnold, were both killed in a hit-man-style slaying whereby they were both shot with a double-barrelled shotgun. Although unsolved, it has been reported in the press that James Moody, described as &quot;Britain&#x27;s most notorious hitman&quot;, may have been responsible for the killings, although he was also murdered a few years later. It has been further suggested in the press that Gooderham was targeted because he creamed off £250,000 in drugs money that he was involved in laundering and that the hit was ordered by the Adams Family criminal organisation, which is also known as the Clerkenwell crime syndicate.
* 1990 – Patricia Parsons, who ran a massage parlour, was found dead in her car having been shot in the head with a cross-bow. It was suggested that she had a &#x27;black book&#x27; of clients and was subject to a contract killing following the possibility that she was going to sell details to a newspaper. The murder remains unsolved.
* 2000 – Wendy Woodhouse, 31, was taken to forest in Essex, stripped, tortured and beaten to death with a snooker cue by two men who thought she had cheated them in a drugs deal. Courtney Peters, 28, an illegal immigrant from Jamaica, and Ewing Thomas, 25, of Stoke Newington, north London, were jailed for life for her murder at the Old Bailey.
* 2004 – The remains of Ivor Willis, who had been missing for two years, were found on Wanstead Flats.
* 2003 – The body of a person aged 40 years or more was found in the forest. Experts could not identify the person&#x27;s sex as the body was believed to have been there for up to 20 years. The body remains unidentified.
* 2005 – Shah Afruj Ali, 40, was lured to the forest and stabbed, before his body was burnt by his younger lover Joygun Nessa, 27, and her brother Azhor Khan, 18, in 2005.
* 2005 – Rafal Czapczyk was found, after passers-by heard gunshots, with ballistic wounds to his head at Wake Arms. He died later in hospital. The body remained unidentified for several months until his family in Poland recognised mortuary pictures that had been released by police. It is not believed that his killers have been found.
* 2015 – Scotland Yard launched a murder inquiry after the body of Hidir Aksakal was found close to Hollow Ponds, Leytonstone, on 9 September 2015.

<text>In organic chemistry, thioesters are organosulfur compounds with the molecular structure . They are analogous to carboxylate esters () with the sulfur in the thioester replacing oxygen in the carboxylate ester, as implied by the thio- prefix. They are the product of esterification of a carboxylic acid () with a thiol (). In biochemistry, the best-known thioesters are derivatives of coenzyme A, e.g., acetyl-CoA. The R and R&#x27; represent organyl groups, or H in the case of R.

==Synthesis==
One route to thioesters involves the reaction of an acid chloride with an alkali metal salt of a thiol:
Another common route entails the displacement of halides by the alkali metal salt of a thiocarboxylic acid. For example, thioacetate esters are commonly prepared by alkylation of potassium thioacetate:
The analogous alkylation of an acetate salt is rarely practiced. The alkylation can be conducted using Mannich bases and the thiocarboxylic acid:

Thioesters can be prepared by condensation of thiols and carboxylic acids in the presence of dehydrating agents:
A typical dehydration agent is DCC. Efforts to improve the sustainability of thioester synthesis have also been reported utilising safer coupling reagent T3P and greener solvent cyclopentanone. Acid anhydrides and some lactones also give thioesters upon treatment with thiols in the presence of a base.

Thioesters can be conveniently prepared from alcohols by the Mitsunobu reaction, using thioacetic acid.

They also arise via carbonylation of alkynes and alkenes in the presence of thiols.

==Reactions==
Thioesters hydrolyze to thiols and the carboxylic acid:
The carbonyl center in thioesters is more reactive toward amine than oxygen nucleophiles, giving amides:

This reaction is exploited in native chemical ligation, a protocol for peptide synthesis.

In a related reaction, thioesters can be converted into esters. Thioacetate esters can also be cleaved with methanethiol in the presence of stoichiometric base, as illustrated in the preparation of pent-4-yne-1-thiol:
:

A reaction unique to thioesters is the Fukuyama coupling, in which the thioester is coupled with an organozinc halide by a palladium catalyst to give a ketone.

==Biochemistry==
Thioesters are common intermediates in many biosynthetic reactions, including the formation and degradation of fatty acids and mevalonate, precursor to steroids. Examples include malonyl-CoA, acetoacetyl-CoA, propionyl-CoA, cinnamoyl-CoA, and acyl carrier protein (ACP) thioesters. Acetogenesis proceeds via the formation of acetyl-CoA. The biosynthesis of lignin, which comprises a large fraction of the Earth&#x27;s land biomass, proceeds via a thioester derivative of caffeic acid. These thioesters arise analogously to those prepared synthetically, the difference being that the dehydration agent is ATP. In addition, thioesters play an important role in the tagging of proteins with ubiquitin, which tags the protein for degradation.

Oxidation of the sulfur atom in thioesters (thiolactones) is postulated in the bioactivation of the antithrombotic prodrugs ticlopidine, clopidogrel, and prasugrel.

===Thioesters and the origin of life===
As posited in a &quot;Thioester World&quot;, thioesters are possible precursors to life. As Christian de Duve explains:
It is revealing that thioesters are obligatory intermediates in several key processes in which ATP is either used or regenerated. Thioesters are involved in the synthesis of all esters, including those found in complex lipids. They also participate in the synthesis of a number of other cellular components, including peptides, fatty acids, sterols, terpenes, porphyrins, and others. In addition, thioesters are formed as key intermediates in several particularly ancient processes that result in the assembly of ATP. In both these instances, the thioester is closer than ATP to the process that uses or yields energy. In other words, thioesters could have actually played the role of ATP in a &quot;thioester world&quot; initially devoid of ATP. Eventually, [these] thioesters could have served to usher in ATP through its ability to support the formation of bonds between phosphate groups.

However, due to the high free energy change of thioester&#x27;s hydrolysis and correspondingly their low equilibrium constants, it is unlikely that these compounds could have accumulated abiotically to any significant extent especially in hydrothermal vent conditions.

==Thionoesters==
Thionoesters are isomeric with thioesters. In a thionoester, sulfur replaces the carbonyl oxygen in an ester. Methyl thionobenzoate is C6H5C(S)OCH3. Such compounds are typically prepared by the reaction of the thioacyl chloride with an alcohol.

They can also be made by the reaction of Lawesson&#x27;s reagent with esters or by treating pinner salts with hydrogen sulfide.

Various thionoesters may be prepared through the transesterification of an existing methyl thionoester with an alcohol under base-catalyzed conditions.

Xanthates and thioamides can be transformed to thionoesters under metal-catalyzed cross-coupling conditions.

<text>Schokland () is a former island in the Dutch Zuiderzee, in the municipality of Noordoostpolder. Schokland was an elongated strip of peat land which ceased to be an island when the Noordoostpolder was reclaimed from the sea in 1942. It is now just a slightly elevated part of the polder, with a still partly intact retaining wall of the waterfront of Middelbuurt. On 1 April 2014, it had 8 inhabitants, but according to Statistics Netherlands there are five people living on the former island.

==History==

Schokland was an attractive settlement area in the Middle Ages when it was much larger. By the 19th century, it was under continuous threat of flooding due to the rise in sea level. By then the Schoklanders had retreated to the three most elevated parts: Emmeloord, Molenbuurt, and Middelbuurt. A major flood in 1825 brought massive destruction, and in 1859 the government decided to end permanent settlement on Schokland. The former municipality of Schokland was joined to Kampen on the mainland.

Today Schokland is a popular archeological site and host to the . Schokland was the first UNESCO World Heritage Site in the Netherlands.

==Public transportation==

The nearest railway stations are in Kampen and Dronten.

Bus service 682 operates from Kampen and serves Schokland.

<text>Raja (; from , IAST &quot;&quot;) is a noble or royal Sanskrit title historically used by some Indian rulers and monarchs and highest-ranking nobles. The title was historically used in the Indian subcontinent and Southeast Asia.

The title has a long history in South Asia and Southeast Asia, being attested from the &quot;Rigveda&quot;, where a &#x27; is a [[Rigvedic tribes|ruler]], see for example the [[Battle of the Ten Kings|]]&#x27;, the &quot;Battle of Ten Kings&quot;. 

The title has equivalent cognates in other Indo-European languages, notably the Latin Rex and the Celtic Rix.

== Rajadharma ==
Rajadharma is the dharma that applies to the king, or the raja. Dharma is that which upholds, supports, or maintains the order of the universe and is based on truth. It is of central importance in achieving order and balance within the world and does this by demanding certain necessary behaviors from people.

The king served two main functions as the raja: secular and religious. The religious functions involved certain acts for propitiating gods, removing dangers, and guarding dharma, among other things. The secular functions involved helping prosperity (such as during times of famine), dealing out even-handed justice, and protecting people and their property. Once he helped the Vibhore to reach his goal by giving the devotion of his power in order to reduce the poverty from his kingdom.

Protection of his subjects was seen as the first and foremost duty of the king. This was achieved by punishing internal aggression, such as thieves among his people, and meeting external aggression, such as attacks by foreign entities. Moreover, the king possessed executive, judicial, and legislative dharmas, which he was responsible for carrying out. If he did so wisely, the king believed that he would be rewarded by reaching the pinnacle of the abode of the Sun, or heaven. However, if the king carried out his office poorly, he feared that he would suffer hell or be struck down by a deity. As scholar Charles Drekmeier notes, &quot;dharma stood above the king, and his failure to preserve it must accordingly have disastrous consequences&quot;. Because the king&#x27;s power had to be employed subject to the requirements of the various ashramas and varnas&#x27; dharma, failure to &quot;enforce the code&quot; transferred guilt on to the ruler, and according to Drekmeier some texts went so far as to justify revolt against a ruler who abused his power or inadequately performed his dharma. In other words, dharma as both the king&#x27;s tool of coercion and power, yet also his potential downfall, &quot;was a two-edged sword&quot;.

The executive duty of the king was primarily to carry out punishment, or &quot;daṇḍa&quot;. For instance, a judge who would give an incorrect verdict out of passion, ignorance, or greed is not worthy of the office, and the king should punish him harshly. Another executive dharma of the king is correcting the behavior of brahmins that have strayed from their dharma, or duties, through the use of strict punishment. These two examples demonstrated how the king was responsible for enforcing the dharmas of his subjects, but also was in charge of enforcing rulings in more civil disputes. Such as if a man is able to repay a creditor but does not do so out of mean-spiritedness, the king should make him pay the money and take five percent for himself.

The judicial duty of the king was deciding any disputes that arose in his kingdom and any conflicts that arose between dharmashastra and practices at the time or between dharmashastra and any secular transactions. When he took the judgment seat, the king was to abandon all selfishness and be neutral to all things. The king would hear cases such as thefts, and would use dharma to come to a decision. He was also responsible for making sure that the witnesses were honest and truthful by way of testing them. If the king conducted these trials according to dharma, he would be rewarded with wealth, fame, respect, and an eternal place in heaven, among other things. However, not all cases fell upon the shoulders of the king. It was also the king&#x27;s duty to appoint judges that would decide cases with the same integrity as the king.

The king also had a legislative duty, which was utilized when he would enact different decrees, such as announcing a festival or a day of rest for the kingdom.

Rajadharma largely portrayed the king as an administrator above all else. The main purpose for the king executing punishment, or danda, was to ensure that all of his subjects were carrying out their own particular dharmas. For this reason, rajadharma was often seen as the root of all dharma and was the highest goal. The whole purpose of the king was to make everything and everyone prosper. If they were not prospering, the king was not fulfilling his dharma. He had to carry out his duties as laid down in the science of government and &quot;not act at his sweet will.&quot; Indeed, in the major writings on dharma (i.e. dharmasastra, etc.), the dharma of the king was regarded as the &quot;capstone&quot; of the other varnas&#x27; dharma both due to the king&#x27;s goal of securing the happiness and prosperity of his people as well as his ability to act as the &quot;guarantor&quot; of the whole social structure through the enforcement of &quot;daṇḍa&quot;.

In contemporary India, an idea pervades various levels of Hindu society: the &quot;Ramarajya&quot;, or a kind of Hindu Golden Age in which through his strict adherence to rajadharma as outline in the Hindu epics and elsewhere, Rama serves as the ideal model of the perfect Hindu king. As Derrett put it, &quot;everyone lives at peace&quot; because &quot;everyone knows his place&quot; and could easily be forced into that place if necessary.

<text>Fakir, faqeer, or faqīr (; (noun of faqr)), derived from &quot;faqr&quot; (, &#x27;poverty&#x27;), is an Islamic term traditionally used for Sufi Muslim ascetics who renounce their worldly possessions and dedicate their lives to the worship of God. They do not necessarily renounce all relationships, or take vows of poverty, but the adornments of the temporal worldly life are kept in perspective. The connotations of poverty associated with the term relate to their spiritual neediness, not necessarily their physical neediness.

They are characterized by their reverence for &quot;dhikr&quot; (a devotional practice which consists of repeating the names of God with various formulas, often performed after the daily prayers). Sufism in the Muslim world emerged during the early Umayyad Caliphate (661–750 CE) and grew as a mystic tradition in the mainstream Sunni and Shia denominations of Islam, which according to Eric Hanson and Karen Armstrong was likely in reaction to &quot;the growing worldliness of Umayyad and Abassid societies&quot;. Sufi Muslim ascetics (fakirs and dervishes) were highly influential and greatly successful in spreading Islam between the 10th and 19th centuries, particularly to the furthest outposts of the Muslim world in the Middle East and North Africa, the Balkans and Caucasus, the Indian subcontinent, and finally Central, Eastern, and Southeast Asia. Sufi Muslims have spread throughout several continents and cultures over a millennium, originally expressing their beliefs in Arabic, before spreading into Persian, Turkish, Indian languages, and a dozen other languages.

The term &quot;fakir&quot; has taken on a more recent and colloquial usage for an ascetic who renounces worldly possessions, and has even been applied to non-Muslims. &quot;Fakirs&quot; are prevalent in the Middle East and South Asia; they are thought to be self-sufficient and possess only the spiritual need for God. The term is also frequently applied to Hindu ascetics (e.g., sadhus, gurus, swamis, and yogis). These usages developed primarily in the Mughal era in the Indian subcontinent. There is also a distinct clan of &quot;faqeers&quot; found in North India, descended from communities of &quot;fakirs&quot; who took up residence at Sufi shrines.

== History ==

Ḥusayn ibn ʿAlī, who was the son of ʿAlī ibn Abī Ṭālib and grandson of Muhammad, is believed to have written a book, &quot;Mirat ul-Arfeen&quot;, on the topic of &quot;tasawwuf&quot;, which is said to be the first book on Sufism. However, under Umayyad rule, this book was not allowed to be published and openly discussing &quot;tasawwuf&quot;, Sufism, or &quot;faqr&quot; was not allowed. For a long time after Ḥusayn ibn ʿAlī, information and teachings about &quot;faqr&quot;, &quot;tasawwuf&quot;, and Sufism was transferred from person to person.

In English, &quot;faqir&quot; or &quot;fakir&quot; originally meant a mendicant dervish. In its mystical usage, the word &quot;fakir&quot; refers to man&#x27;s spiritual need for God, who alone is regarded as self-sufficient in the Islamic religion. Although of Muslim origin, the term has come to be applied in the Indian subcontinent to Hindu ascetics and mystics as well, alongside Indian terms such as &quot;gosvamin&quot;, &quot;sadhu&quot;, &quot;bhikku&quot;, and other designations. Fakirs are generally regarded as holy men who possess supernatural or miraculous powers. Among Muslims, the leading Sufi orders (&quot;tariqa&quot;) of fakirs are the Shadhiliyyah, Chishtiyah, Qadiriyah, Naqshbandiyah, and Suhrawardiyah. The &quot;Cambridge English Dictionary&quot; defines the term &quot;fakir&quot; as &quot;a member of an Islamic religious group, or a holy man&quot;.

== Attributes ==
The attributes of a fakir have been defined by many Muslim scholars.

The early Muslim scholar, Abdul-Qadir Gilani, defined Sufism, tasawwuf and faqr in a conclusive manner. Explaining the attributes of a fakir, he says, &quot;faqir is not who can not do anything and is nothing in his self-being. But faqir has all the commanding powers (gifted from Allah) and his orders can not be revoked.&quot;

Ibn Arabi explained Sufism, including faqr, in more detail. He wrote more than 500 books on the topic. He was the first Muslim scholar to openly introduce the idea of Wahdat al-wujud. His writings are considered a solid source that has defied time.

Another well-known Muslim saint, Sultan Bahoo, describes a fakir as one &quot;who has been entrusted with full authority from Allah (God)&quot;. In the same book, Sultan Bahoo says, &quot;Faqir attains eternity by dissolving himself in oneness of Allah. He, when, eliminates himself from other than Allah, his soul reaches to divinity.&quot; He says in another book, &quot;faqir has three steps (stages). First step he takes from eternity (without beginning) to this mortal world, second step from this finite world to hereafter and last step he takes from hereafter to manifestation of Allah.&quot;

== Gurdjieff ==
In the Fourth Way teaching of G. I. Gurdjieff, the word &quot;fakir&quot; is used to denote the specifically physical path of development, as opposed to the words &quot;yogi&quot; (which Gurdjieff used for a path of mental development) and &quot;monk&quot; (which he used for the path of emotional development).

<text>In mathematics, a &quot;P&quot;-multimagic square (also known as a satanic square) is a magic square that remains magic even if all its numbers are replaced by their &quot;k&quot;th powers for 1 ≤ &quot;k&quot; ≤ &quot;P&quot;. squares are called bimagic, squares are called trimagic, squares tetramagic, and squares pentamagic.

== Constants for normal squares ==
If the squares are normal, the constant for the power-squares can be determined as follows:

Bimagic series totals for bimagic squares are also linked to the square-pyramidal number sequence is as follows :-
Squares 0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, ... 
Sum of Squares 0, 1, 5, 14, 30, 55, 91, 140, 204, 285, ... )number of units in a square-based pyramid) 
The bimagic series is the 1st, 4th, 9th in this series (divided by 1, 2, 3, &quot;n&quot;) etc. so values for the rows and columns in order-1, order-2, order-3 Bimagic squares would be 1, 15, 95, 374, 1105, 2701, 5775, 11180, ... 

The trimagic series would be related in the same way to the hyper-pyramidal sequence of nested cubes. 
Cubes 0, 1, 8, 27, 64, 125, 216, ... 
Sum of Cubes 0, 1, 9, 36, 100, ... 
Value for Trimagic squares 1, 50, 675, 4624, ... 

Similarly the tetramagic sequence 
4-Power 0, 1, 16, 81, 256, 625, 1296, ... 
Sum of 4-Power 0, 1, 17, 98, 354, 979, 2275, ... 
Sums for Tetramagic squares 0, 1, 177, ... 

==Bimagic square==
A bimagic square is a magic square that remains magic when all of its numbers are replaced by their squares.

The first known bimagic square has order 8 and magic constant 260 and a bimagic constant of 11180.

It has been conjectured by Bensen and Jacoby that no nontrivial bimagic squares of order less than 8 exist. This was shown for magic squares containing the elements 1 to &quot;n&quot;2 by Boyer and Trump.

However, J. R. Hendricks was able to show in 1998 that no bimagic square of order 3 exists, save for the trivial bimagic square containing the same number nine times. The proof is fairly simple: let the following be our bimagic square.

It is well known that a property of magic squares is that formula_1. Similarly, formula_2. Therefore,
formula_3. It follows that formula_4. The same holds for all lines going through the center.

For 4 × 4 squares, Luke Pebody was able to show by similar methods that the only 4 × 4 bimagic squares (up to symmetry) are of the form

or
An 8 × 8 bimagic square.

Nontrivial bimagic squares are now (2010) known for any order from eight to 64. Li Wen of China created the first known bimagic squares of orders 34, 37, 38, 41, 43, 46, 47, 53, 58, 59, 61, 62 filling the gaps of the last unknown orders.

In 2006 Jaroslaw Wroblewski built a non-normal bimagic square of order 6. Non-normal means that it uses non-consecutive integers.

Also in 2006 Lee Morgenstern built several non-normal bimagic squares of order 7.

==Trimagic square==
A trimagic square is a magic square that remains magic when all of its numbers are replaced by their cubes.

Trimagic squares of orders 12, 32, 64, 81 and 128 have been discovered so far; the only known trimagic square of order 12, given below, was found in June 2002 by German mathematician Walter Trump.

==Higher order==
The first 4-magic square was constructed by Charles Devimeux in 1983 and was a 256-order square.

A 4-magic square of order 512 was constructed in May 2001 by André Viricel and Christian Boyer.

The first 5-magic square, of order 1024 arrived about one month later, in June 2001 again by Viricel and Boyer. They also presented a smaller 4-magic square of order 256 in January 2003. Another 5-magic square, of order 729, was constructed in June 2003 by Li Wen.

<text>Elinor M. Brent-Dyer (6 April 1894 – 20 September 1969) was an English writer of children&#x27;s literature who wrote more than one hundred books during her lifetime, the most famous being the &quot;Chalet School&quot; series.

==Early life and education==
Brent-Dyer was born Gladys Eleanor May Dyer on 6 April 1894 in South Shields. She was the only daughter of Charles Morris Brent Dyer, a surveyor, and Eleanor Watson Rutherford. Her father left the family when she was three years old and her mother remarried in 1913. In 1912, her younger brother Henzell died of meningitis.

Brent-Dyer was educated privately at a small school in South Shields until 1912 and shortly afterward trained to teach at City of Leeds Training College. She taught a variety of subjects at both state and private schools and ran a Girl Guide group. In the 1920s, she briefly studied music under Edgar Bainton at the Newcastle Conservatoire.

==Career==
Brent-Dyer&#x27;s first book, &quot;Gerry Goes to School&quot;, was published in 1922 and became the first of the &quot;La Rochelle&quot; series.

She was inspired to start the &quot;Chalet School&quot; series after holidaying in the Austrian Tyrol at Pertisau-am-Achensee. The first book in the series, &quot;The School at the Chalet&quot;, was published in 1925. 

Although she was raised as an Anglican, she converted to Roman Catholicism in 1930.

In 1933, Brent-Dyer and her mother moved to Hereford, where Brent-Dyer was employed as a governess in Peterchurch. In 1938, she opened her own school, the Margaret Roper School, which closed in 1948. She then dedicated all of her time to writing.

Brent-Dyer&#x27;s mother died in 1957. In 1964, her long-time friend Phyllis Matthewman persuaded her to leave the unmanageably large Victorian villa at which she had previously run her school to live with Phyllis and her literary agent husband, Sydney. After first living together as tenants in half of a house called Albury Edge, at Redhill, Surrey, they bought a house together, Gryphons, also at Redhill, in 1965. Phyllis&#x27;s aunt, who knew the Dyer family, had introduced them to one another in childhood. Sydney Matthewman served as Brent-Dyer&#x27;s agent. Brent-Dyer died at Redhill in 1969 and her final book was published posthumously the following year.

The Valley is host to the biggest outdoor bonspiel in Canada every January. The spiel is held on the frozen Windermere Lake. The curling club is also host to many leagues and bonspiels throughout the season.

;Hot springs
Hot springs are numerous in the area, with the major developed ones being Fairmont and Radium Hot Springs; the latter is located inside Kootenay National Park.

Less developed &#x27;wilderness&#x27; hot springs can be found in the southern Columbia Valley, in Whiteswan Lake Provincial Park. Lussier Hot Springs is located south of Invermere and can be accessed from the Whiteswan Forestry Road. Ram Creek Warm Springs, a less visited and cooler natural spring, can also be accessed along the same route.

==Media==

Invermere is home to one newspaper, the &quot;Columbia Valley Pioneer&quot;. On July 1, 2017, the &quot;Pioneer&quot; (founded in 2004) and the &quot;Invermere Valley Echo&quot; (founded in 1956) merged to one paper retaining the &quot;Columbia Valley Pioneer&quot; designation. The &quot;Pioneer&quot; serves the Columbia Valley region, from Spillimacheen in the north to Canal Flats in the south and is published once a week, every Thursday.

<doc id="372464" wikidata="Q1424257" url="?curid=372464" title="Wire loop game">
<text>A wire loop game, or buzz wire, is a game which involves guiding a metal loop (a &#x27;probe&#x27;) along a serpentine length of wire without touching the loop to the wire. The loop and wire are connected to a power source in such a way that, if they touch, they form a closed electric circuit. The circuit is connected to a light or sound-emitting device of some sort, so that when the loop and the wire touch, the light-emitting device will light up, and the sound-emitting device will make a sound, traditionally a buzzing noise. In commercial implementations of the game the wire is usually bent along a single axis.

This game is also called a steady-hand game or an electronic loop game.

== History ==
The electric buzz wire game was invented by Robert (Bob) Scrimshaw in Yorkshire in 1953. Bob was an electrician for RAF ground crew during WWII repairing planes, and was known as a very skilled electronic engineer. In 1953 Bob’s close friend John Waddington asked Bob if he could make a game for his garden party, and Bob created and brought along the ‘electronic loop game’. The game was a huge hit at the party, and John Waddington went on to parent Bob’s design before producing the first commercial ‘electronic loop game’ for sale from the mid 1950’s, through his Waddingtons Game Co.

== Types of buzz wire games ==
Desktop buzz wires are widely available for purchase. A giant version of the game also exists and it is typically used outdoors or as a garden game. 
More sophisticated buzz wires have also been developed, to incorporate digital technology to add features like automated scorekeeping and player ranking.

Virtual versions of this game exist, in which the pointer takes the place of the wire loop and must be guided down a narrow, twisting path without touching the sides. Both versions require well-developed hand–eye coordination. The difficulty of any particular game depends in part on the shape of the twisted wire and the size of the loop.

<text>The Norwegian Confederation of Trade Unions (, LO) is a national trade union center, decidedly the largest and probably the most influential umbrella organization of labour unions in Norway. The 21 national unions affiliated to the LO have almost 1,000,000 members of a Norwegian population of 5 million. The majority of affiliated unions organizes traditional blue collar workers, but the largest affiliate is the Norwegian Union of Municipal and General Employees which makes up more than a third of all members. LO is affiliated to the ITUC and the ETUC.

It was named the Workers&#x27; National Trade Union (, AFL) from 1899 to 1957. Affiliated with the Labour Party throughout its history, several of LO&#x27;s member unions have concurrently been member bodies in the Labour Party. 
The organization owns the Norwegian Labour Movement Archives and Library.

<doc id="372467" wikidata="Q13645891" url="?curid=372467" title="Magic hypercube">
<text>In mathematics, a magic hypercube is the &quot;k&quot;-dimensional generalization of magic squares and magic cubes, that is, an &quot;n&quot; × &quot;n&quot; × &quot;n&quot; × ... × &quot;n&quot; array of integers such that the sums of the numbers on each pillar (along any axis) as well as on the main space diagonals are all the same. The common sum is called the magic constant of the hypercube, and is sometimes denoted &quot;M&quot;&quot;k&quot;(&quot;n&quot;). If a magic hypercube consists of the numbers 1, 2, ..., &quot;n&quot;&quot;k&quot;, then it has magic number

:formula_1.

For &quot;k&quot; = 4, a magic hypercube may be called a magic tesseract, with sequence of magic numbers given by .

The side-length &quot;n&quot; of the magic hypercube is called its &quot;order&quot;. Four-, five-, six-, seven- and eight-dimensional magic hypercubes of order three have been constructed by J. R. Hendricks.

Marian Trenkler proved the following theorem:
A &quot;p&quot;-dimensional magic hypercube of order &quot;n&quot; exists if and only if
&quot;p&quot; &gt; 1 and &quot;n&quot; is different from 2 or &quot;p&quot; = 1. A construction of a magic hypercube follows from the proof.

The R programming language includes a module, codice_1, that will create magic hypercubes of any dimension with &quot;n&quot; a multiple of 4.

==Perfect magic hypercubes==

If, in addition, the numbers on every cross section diagonal also sum up to the hypercube&#x27;s magic number, the hypercube is called a perfect magic hypercube; otherwise, it is called a semiperfect magic hypercube. The number &quot;n&quot; is called the order of the magic hypercube.

This definition of &quot;perfect&quot; assumes that one of the older definitions for perfect magic cubes is used. The Universal Classification System for Hypercubes (John R. Hendricks) requires that for any dimension hypercube, &quot;all&quot; possible lines sum correctly for the hypercube to be considered &quot;perfect&quot; magic. Because of the confusion with the term &quot;perfect&quot;, nasik is now the preferred term for &quot;any&quot; magic hypercube where all possible lines sum to &quot;S&quot;. Nasik was defined in this manner by C. Planck in 1905. A nasik magic hypercube has (3&quot;n&quot; − 1) lines of &quot;m&quot; numbers passing through each of the &quot;m&quot;&quot;n&quot; cells.

==Nasik magic hypercubes==
A Nasik magic hypercube is a magic hypercube with the added restriction that all possible lines through each cell sum correctly to &quot;S&quot; = where &quot;S&quot; is the magic constant, &quot;m&quot; the order and &quot;n&quot; the dimension of the hypercube.

Or, to put it more concisely, all pan-&quot;r&quot;-agonals sum correctly for &quot;r&quot; = 1...&quot;n&quot;. This definition is the same as the Hendricks definition of perfect, but different from the Boyer/Trump definition.

The term &quot;nasik&quot; would apply to all dimensions of magic hypercubes in which the number of correctly summing paths (lines) through any cell of the hypercube is &quot;P&quot; = .

A pandiagonal magic square then would be a &quot;nasik&quot; square because 4 magic line pass through each of the &quot;m&quot;2 cells. This was A.H. Frost’s original definition of nasik. A &quot;nasik&quot; magic cube would have 13 magic lines passing through each of its &quot;m&quot;3 cells. (This cube also contains 9&quot;m&quot; pandiagonal magic squares of order &quot;m&quot;.) A &quot;nasik&quot; magic tesseract would have 40 lines passing through each of its &quot;m&quot;4 cells, and so on.

===History===
In 1866 and 1878, Rev. A. H. Frost coined the term &quot;Nasik&quot; for the type of magic square we commonly call &quot;pandiagonal&quot; and often call &quot;perfect&quot;. He then demonstrated the concept with an order-7 cube we now class as &quot;pandiagonal&quot;, and an order-8 cube we class as &quot;pantriagonal&quot;. In another 1878 paper he showed another &quot;pandiagonal&quot; magic cube and a cube where all 13&quot;m&quot; lines sum correctly i.e. Hendricks &quot;perfect&quot;.
He referred to all of these cubes as nasik as a respect to the great Indian Mathematician D R Kaprekar who hails from Deolali in Nasik District in Maharashtra, India.
In 1905 Dr. Planck expanded on the nasik idea in his Theory of Paths Nasik. In the introductory to his paper, he wrote;
In 1917, Dr. Planck wrote again on this subject.
In 1939, B. Rosser and R. J. Walker published a series of papers on diabolic (perfect) magic squares and cubes. They specifically mentioned that these cubes contained 13&quot;m&quot;2 correctly summing lines. They also had 3&quot;m&quot; pandiagonal magic squares parallel to the faces of the cube, and 6&quot;m&quot; pandiagonal magic squares parallel to the space-diagonal planes.

==Notations==

in order to keep things in hand a special notation was developed:
*formula_2: positions within the hypercube
*formula_3: vector through the hypercube

Note: The notation for position can also be used for the value on that position. Then, where it is appropriate, dimension and order can be added to it, thus forming: &quot;n&quot;[&quot;k&quot;&quot;i&quot;]&quot;m&quot;

As is indicated &quot;k&quot; runs through the dimensions, while the coordinate &quot;i&quot; runs through all possible values, when values &quot;i&quot; are outside the range it is simply moved back into the range by adding or subtracting appropriate multiples of &quot;m&quot;, as the magic hypercube resides in n-dimensional modular space.

There can be multiple &quot;k&quot; between brackets, these cannot have the same value, though in undetermined order, which explains the equality of:

formula_4

Of course given &quot;k&quot; also one value &quot;i&quot; is referred to.

When a specific coordinate value is mentioned the other values can be taken as 0, which is especially the case when the amount of &#x27;k&#x27;s are limited using pe. #&quot;k&quot; = 1 as in:

formula_5
(&quot;axial&quot;-neighbor of formula_6 )

(#j=n-1 can be left unspecified) j now runs through all the values in [0..k-1,k+1..n-1].

Further: without restrictions specified &#x27;k&#x27; as well as &#x27;i&#x27; run through all possible values, in combinations same letters assume same values. Thus makes it possible to specify a particular line within the hypercube (see r-agonal in pathfinder section)

Note: as far as I know this notation is not in general use yet(?), Hypercubes are not generally analyzed in this particular manner.

Further: &quot;perm(0..n-1)&quot; specifies a permutation of the n numbers 0..n-1.

==Construction==

Besides more specific constructions two more general construction method are noticeable:

===KnightJump construction===
This construction generalizes the movement of the chessboard horses (vectors formula_7) to more general movements (vectors formula_8). The method starts at the position P0 and further numbers are sequentially placed at positions formula_9 further until (after m steps) a position is reached that is already occupied, a further vector is needed to find the next free position. Thus the method is specified by the n by n+1 matrix:
:formula_10
This positions the number &#x27;k&#x27; at position:
:formula_11
C. Planck gives in his 1905 article &quot;The theory of Path Nasiks&quot; conditions to create with this method &quot;Path Nasik&quot; (or modern {perfect}) hypercubes.

===Latin prescription construction===
(modular equations).
This method is also specified by an n by n+1 matrix. However this time it multiplies the n+1 vector [x0..,xn-1,1], After this multiplication the result is taken modulus m to achieve the n (Latin) hypercubes:
 LPk = ( l=0Σn-1 LPk,l xl + LPk,n ) % m
of radix m numbers (also called &quot;digits&quot;). On these LPk&#x27;s &quot;digit changing&quot; (?i.e. Basic manipulation) are generally applied before these LPk&#x27;s are combined into the hypercube:
 nHm = k=0Σn-1 LPk mk

J.R.Hendricks often uses modular equation, conditions to make hypercubes of various quality can be found on http://www.magichypercubes.com/Encyclopedia at several places (especially p-section)

Both methods fill the hypercube with numbers, the knight-jump guarantees (given appropriate vectors) that every number is present. The Latin prescription only if the components are orthogonal (no two digits occupying the same position)

===Multiplication===
Amongst the various ways of compounding, the multiplication can be considered as the most basic of these methods. The basic multiplication is given by:
 nHm1 * nHm2 : n[ki]m1m2 = n[ [[ki \ m2]m1m1n]m2 + [ki % m2]m2]m1m2

Most compounding methods can be viewed as variations of the above, As most qualifiers are invariant under multiplication one can for example place any aspectual variant of nHm2 in the above equation, besides that on the result one can apply a manipulation to improve quality. Thus one can specify pe the J. R. Hendricks / M. Trenklar doubling. These things go beyond the scope of this article.

==Aspects==
A hypercube knows n! 2n Aspectial variants, which are obtained by coordinate reflection ([ki] --&gt; [k(-i)]) and coordinate permutations ([ki] --&gt; [perm[k]i]) effectively giving the Aspectial variant:
 nHm~R perm(0..n-1); R = k=0Σn-1 ((reflect(k)) ? 2k : 0) ; perm(0..n-1) a permutation of 0..n-1
Where reflect(k) true iff coordinate k is being reflected, only then 2k is added to R.
As is easy to see, only n coordinates can be reflected explaining 2n, the n! permutation of n coordinates explains the other factor to the total amount of &quot;Aspectial variants&quot;!

Aspectial variants are generally seen as being equal. Thus any hypercube can be represented shown in &quot;normal position&quot; by:
 [k0] = min([kθ ; θ ε {-1,0}]) (by reflection)
 [k1 ; #k=1] &lt; [k+11 ; #k=1] ; k = 0..n-2 (by coordinate permutation)
(explicitly stated here: [k0] the minimum of all corner points. The axial neighbour sequentially based on axial number)

==Basic manipulations==

Besides more specific manipulations, the following are of more general nature

*#[perm(0..n-1)] : component permutation
*^[perm(0..n-1)] : coordinate permutation (n == 2: transpose)
*_2axis[perm(0..m-1)] : monagonal permutation (axis ε [0..n-1])
*=[perm(0..m-1)] : digit change

Note: &#x27;#&#x27;, &#x27;^&#x27;, &#x27;_&#x27; and &#x27;=&#x27; are essential part of the notation and used as manipulation selectors.

===Component permutation===
Defined as the exchange of components, thus varying the factor mk in mperm(k), because there are n component hypercubes the permutation is over these n components

===Coordinate permutation===
The exchange of coordinate [ki] into [perm(k)i], because of n coordinates a permutation over these n directions is required. The term transpose (usually denoted by t) is used with two dimensional matrices, in general though perhaps &quot;coordinate permutation&quot; might be preferable.

===Monagonal permutation===
Defined as the change of [ki] into [kperm(i)] alongside the given &quot;axial&quot;-direction. Equal permutation along various axes can be combined by adding the factors 2axis. Thus defining all kinds of r-agonal permutations for any r. Easy to see that all possibilities are given by the corresponding permutation of m numbers.

Noted be that reflection is the special case:
 ~R = _R[n-1..,0]
Further when all the axes undergo the same permutation (R = 2n-1) an n-agonal permutation is achieved, In this special case the &#x27;R&#x27; is usually omitted so:
 _[perm(0..n-1)] = _(2n-1)[perm(0..n-1)]

===Digitchanging===
Usually being applied at component level and can be seen as given by [ki] in perm([ki]) since a component is filled with radix m digits, a permutation over m numbers is an appropriate manner to denote these.

==Pathfinders==
J. R. Hendricks called the directions within a hypercubes &quot;pathfinders&quot;, these directions are simplest denoted in a ternary number system as:
 Pfp where: p = k=0Σn-1 (ki + 1) 3k &lt;==&gt; &lt;ki&gt; ; i ε {-1,0,1}

This gives 3n directions. since every direction is traversed both ways one can limit to the upper half [(3n-1)/2..,3n-1)] of the full range.

With these pathfinders any line to be summed over (or r-agonal) can be specified:
 [ j0 kp lq ; #j=1 #k=r-1 ; k &gt; j ] &lt; j1 kθ l0 ; θ ε {-1,1} &gt; ; p,q ε [0..,m-1]

which specifies all (broken) r-agonals, p and q ranges could be omitted from this description. The main (unbroken) r-agonals are thus given by the slight modification of the above:
 [ j0 k0 l-1 sp ; #j=1 #k+#l=r-1 ; k,l &gt; j ] &lt; j1 k1 l-1 s0 &gt;

==Qualifications==

A hypercube nHm with numbers in the analytical numberrange [0..mn-1] has the magic sum:
 nSm = m (mn - 1) / 2.

Besides more specific qualifications the following are the most important, &quot;summing&quot; of course stands for &quot;summing correctly to the magic sum&quot;

*{r-agonal} : all main (unbroken) r-agonals are summing.
*{pan r-agonal} : all (unbroken and broken) r-agonals are summing.
*{magic} : {1-agonal n-agonal}
*{perfect} : {pan r-agonal; r = 1..n}

Note: This series doesn&#x27;t start with 0 since a nill-agonal doesn&#x27;t exist, the numbers correspond with the usual name-calling: 1-agonal = monagonal, 2-agonal = diagonal, 3-agonal = triagonal etc.. Aside from this the number correspond to the amount of &quot;-1&quot; and &quot;1&quot; in the corresponding pathfinder.

In case the hypercube also sum when all the numbers are raised to the power p one gets p-multimagic hypercubes. The above qualifiers are simply prepended onto the p-multimagic qualifier. This defines qualifications as {r-agonal 2-magic}. Here also &quot;2-&quot; is usually replaced by &quot;bi&quot;, &quot;3-&quot; by &quot;tri&quot; etc. (&quot;1-magic&quot; would be &quot;monomagic&quot; but &quot;mono&quot; is usually omitted). The sum for p-Multimagic hypercubes can be found by using [[Faulhaber&#x27;s formula]] and divide it by mn-1.

Also &quot;magic&quot; (i.e. {1-agonal n-agonal}) is usually assumed, the [[perfect magic cube|Trump/Boyer {diagonal} cube]] is technically seen {1-agonal 2-agonal 3-agonal}.

[[Nasik magic hypercube]] gives arguments for using {nasik} as synonymous to {perfect}. The strange generalization of square &#x27;perfect&#x27; to using it synonymous to {diagonal} in cubes is however also resolve by putting curly brackets around qualifiers, so {perfect} means {pan r-agonal; r = 1..n} (as mentioned above).

some minor qualifications are:
*{ncompact} : {all order 2 subhyper cubes sum to 2n nSm / m}
*{ncomplete} : {all pairs halve an n-agonal apart sum equal (to (mn - 1)}

{ncompact} might be put in notation as : (k)Σ [ji + k1] = 2n nSm / m. {ncomplete} can simply be written as: [ji] + [ji + k(m/2) ; #k=n ] = mn - 1 where:
:(k)Σ is symbolic for summing all possible k&#x27;s, there are 2n possibilities for k1.
:[ji + k1] expresses [ji] and all its r-agonal neighbors.
for {complete} the complement of [ji] is at position [ji + k(m/2) ; #k=n ].

for squares: {2compact 2complete} is the &quot;modern/alternative qualification&quot; of what Dame [[Kathleen Ollerenshaw]] called [[most-perfect magic square]], {ncompact ncomplete} is the qualifier for the feature in more than 2 dimensions.

Caution: some people seems to equate {compact} with {2compact} instead of {ncompact}. Since this introductory article is not the place to discuss these kind of issues I put in the dimensional pre-superscript n to both these qualifiers (which are defined as shown) consequences of {ncompact} is that several figures also sum since they can be formed by adding/subtracting order 2 sub-hyper cubes. Issues like these go beyond this articles scope.

==Magic hyperbeam==
A magic hyperbeam (n-dimensional magic rectangle) is a variation on a magic hypercube where the orders along each direction may be different. As such a magic hyperbeam generalises the two dimensional magic rectangle and the three dimensional magic beam, a series that mimics the series [[magic square]], [[magic cube]] and magic hypercube. This article will mimic the [[magic hypercubes]] article in close detail, and just as that article serves merely as an introduction to the topic.

===Conventions===
It is customary to denote the [[dimension]] with the letter &#x27;n&#x27; and the [[cardinality|orders]] of a hyperbeam with the letter &#x27;m&#x27; (appended with the subscripted number of the direction it applies to).
* (&quot;n&quot;) Dimension : the amount of directions within a hyperbeam.
* (&quot;m&quot;&quot;k&quot;) Order : the amount of numbers along &quot;k&quot;th monagonal &quot;k&quot; = 0, ..., &quot;n&quot; − 1.

Further: In this article the analytical number range [0..k=0Πn-1mk-1] is being used.

===Notations===
in order to keep things in hand a special notation was developed:
* [ ki; k=[0..n-1]; i=[0..mk-1] ]: positions within the hyperbeam
* : vectors through the hyperbeam

Note: The notation for position can also be used for the value on that position. There where it is appropriate dimension and orders can be added to it thus forming: n[ki]m0..,mn-1

===Construction===

====Basic====
Description of more general methods might be put here, I don&#x27;t often create hyperbeams, so I don&#x27;t know whether Knightjump or Latin Prescription work here.
Other more adhoc methods suffice on occasion I need a hyperbeam.

====Multiplication====
Amongst the various ways of compounding, the multiplication can be considered as the most basic of these methods. The basic multiplication is given by:
:nB(m..)1 * nB(m..)2 : n[ki](m..)1(m..)2 = n[ [[ki \ mk2]](m..)1k=0Πn-1mk1](m..)2 + [ki % mk2](m..)2](m..)1(m..)2

(m..) abbreviates: m0..,mn-1. (m..)1(m..)2 abbreviates: m01m02..,mn-11mn-12.

===Curiosities===

====all orders are either even or odd====
A fact that can be easily seen since the magic sums are:
:Sk = mk (j=0Πn-1mj - 1) / 2

When any of the orders mk is even, the product is even and thus the only way Sk turns out integer is when all mk are even. Thus suffices: all mk are either even or odd.

This is with the exception of mk=1 of course, which allows for general identities like:
* Nmt = Nm,1 * N1,m
* Nm = N1,m * Nm,1
Which goes beyond the scope of this introductory article

====Only one direction with order = 2====
since any number has but one complement only one of the directions can have mk = 2.

===Aspects===
A hyperbeam knows 2n Aspectial variants, which are obtained by coördinate reflection ([ki] → [k(-i)]) effectively giving the Aspectial variant:
 nB(m0..mn-1)~R ; R = k=0Σn-1 ((reflect(k)) ? 2k : 0) ;
Where reflect(k) true if and only if coordinate k is being reflected, only then 2k is added to R.

In case one views different orientations of the beam as equal one could view the number of aspects n! 2n just as with the [[magic hypercubes]], directions with equal orders contribute factors depending on the hyperbeam&#x27;s orders. This goes beyond the scope of this article.

===Basic manipulations===
Besides more specific manipulations, the following are of more general nature
* ^[perm(0..n-1)] : coördinate permutation (n == 2: transpose)
* _2axis[perm(0..m-1)] : monagonal permutation (axis ε [0..n-1])

Note: &#x27;^&#x27; and &#x27;_&#x27; are essential part of the notation and used as manipulation selectors.

====Coördinate permutation====
The exchange of coördinaat [ki] into [perm(k)i], because of n coördinates a permutation over these n directions is required. The term transpose (usually denoted by t) is used with two dimensional matrices, in general though perhaps &quot;coördinaatpermutation&quot; might be preferable.

====Monagonal permutation====
Defined as the change of [ki] into [kperm(i)] alongside the given &quot;axial&quot;-direction. Equal permutation along various axes with equal orders can be combined by adding the factors 2axis. Thus defining all kinds of r-agonal permutations for any r. Easy to see that all possibilities are given by the corresponding permutation of m numbers.

====normal position====
In case no restrictions are considered on the n-agonals a magic hyperbeam can be represented shown in &quot;normal position&quot; by:
:[ki] &lt; [k(i+1)] ; i = 0..mk-2 (by monagonal permutation)

===Qualification===
Qualifying the hyperbeam is less developed then it is on the [[magic hypercubes]] in fact only the k&#x27;th monagonal direction need to sum to:
:Sk = mk (j=0Πn-1mj - 1) / 2
for all k = 0..n-1 for the hyperbeam to be qualified {magic}

When the orders are not relatively prime the n-agonal sum can be restricted to:
:S = lcm(mi ; i = 0..n-1) (j=0Πn-1mj - 1) / 2
with all orders relatively prime this reaches its maximum:
:Smax = j=0Πn-1mj (j=0Πn-1mj - 1) / 2

===Special hyperbeams===
The following hyperbeams serve special purposes:

====The &quot;normal hyperbeam&quot;====
:nNm0..,mn-1 : [ki] = k=0Σn-1 ki mkk

This hyperbeam can be seen as the source of all numbers. A procedure called &quot;Dynamic numbering&quot; makes use of the [[isomorphism]] of every hyperbeam with this normal, changing the source, changes the hyperbeam. Basic multiplications of normal hyperbeams play a special role with the &quot;Dynamic numbering&quot; of [[magic hypercubes]] of order k=0Πn-1 mk.

====The &quot;constant 1&quot;====
:n1m0..,mn-1 : [ki] = 1
The hyperbeam that is usually added to change the here used &quot;analytic&quot; number range into the &quot;regular&quot; number range. Other constant hyperbeams are of course multiples of this one.

<doc id="372470" wikidata="Q5610719" url="?curid=372470" title="Grothendieck's Galois theory">
<text>In mathematics, Grothendieck&#x27;s Galois theory is an abstract approach to the Galois theory of fields, developed around 1960 to provide a way to study the fundamental group of algebraic topology in the setting of algebraic geometry. It provides, in the classical setting of field theory, an alternative perspective to that of Emil Artin based on linear algebra, which became standard from about the 1930s.

The approach of Alexander Grothendieck is concerned with the category-theoretic properties that characterise the categories of finite &quot;G&quot;-sets for a fixed profinite group &quot;G&quot;. For example, &quot;G&quot; might be the group denoted formula_1 (see profinite integer), which is the inverse limit of the cyclic additive groups formula_2 — or equivalently the completion of the infinite cyclic group formula_3 for the topology of subgroups of finite index. A finite &quot;G&quot;-set is then a finite set &quot;X&quot; on which &quot;G&quot; acts through a quotient finite cyclic group, so that it is specified by giving some permutation of &quot;X&quot;.

In the above example, a connection with classical Galois theory can be seen by regarding formula_1 as the profinite Galois group Gal(&quot;F&quot;/&quot;F&quot;) of the algebraic closure &quot;F&quot; of any finite field &quot;F&quot;, over &quot;F&quot;. That is, the automorphisms of &quot;F&quot; fixing &quot;F&quot; are described by the inverse limit, as we take larger and larger finite splitting fields over &quot;F&quot;. The connection with geometry can be seen when we look at covering spaces of the unit disk in the complex plane with the origin removed: the finite covering realised by the &quot;z&quot;&quot;n&quot; map of the disk, thought of by means of a complex number variable &quot;z&quot;, corresponds to the subgroup formula_5 of the fundamental group of the punctured disk.

The theory of Grothendieck, published in SGA1, shows how to reconstruct the category of &quot;G&quot;-sets from a &quot;fibre functor&quot; formula_6, which in the geometric setting takes the fibre of a covering above a fixed base point (as a set). In fact there is an isomorphism proved of the type

:formula_7,

the latter being the group of automorphisms (self-natural equivalences) of formula_6. An abstract classification of categories with a functor to the category of sets is given, by means of which one can recognise categories of &quot;G&quot;-sets for &quot;G&quot; profinite.

To see how this applies to the case of fields, one has to study the tensor product of fields. In topos theory this is a part of the study of &quot;atomic toposes&quot;.

<text>The New River is an artificial waterway in England, opened in 1613 to supply London with fresh drinking water taken from Chadwell and Amwell Springs near Ware in Hertfordshire, and later the River Lea and other sources. 

Originally conceived by Edmund Colthurst and completed by Hugh Myddelton, it was operated by the New River Company for nearly 300 years until London&#x27;s water supply was taken over by the Metropolitan Water Board in 1904.

Although it was once threatened with closure, a large section of the New River remains part of London&#x27;s water supply infrastructure, today operated by Thames Water, more than 400 years after it was first constructed.

The New River originally followed the land contours but certain parts have been straightened over the centuries. There is a designated walking route along the canal called the New River Path. It is a 28-mile (45 km) long-distance footpath which follows the course of the New River as closely as possible from its source in Hertfordshire to its original end in Islington, London.

==Route==
It starts between Ware and Hertford in Hertfordshire and today runs down to Stoke Newington. Among the districts it flows through are (from north to south):
*Great Amwell
*Hoddesdon
*Broxbourne
*Cheshunt
*Enfield
*Palmers Green
*Bowes Park
*Wood Green (passing close to Alexandra Palace)
*Hornsey
*Harringay
*Finsbury Park

Its original termination, near Clerkenwell, Islington, became known as the New River Head where the water filled a large cistern – the Round Pond – next to the current location of Sadler&#x27;s Wells theatre — where water from the river was used to flood a large tank to stage an &quot;Aquatic Theatre&quot; at the beginning of the nineteenth century. 

In 1946, the water supply to New River Head was truncated at Stoke Newington with the New River ending at the East Reservoir. The reservoir is managed as the Woodberry Wetlands – a nature reserve and designated Site of Metropolitan Importance.

==Construction==

The design and construction of the New River is often attributed solely to Sir Hugh Myddelton. In 1602, Edmund Colthurst first proposed the idea of digging an artificial waterway to supply London from Chadwell and Amwell springs near Ware in Hertfordshire, and obtained a charter from King James I in 1604 to carry it out. However, much of the water was obtained from streams tapped along its route, including the Hackney Brook.

After surveying the route and digging the first stretch, Colthurst encountered financial difficulties and it fell to Myddelton to complete the work between 1609 and its official opening on 29 September 1613. The project was also rescued by the King personally, whose house and lands at Theobalds Park were crossed by the river. James took half of the shares in 1612 for a half of the profits.

The expense and engineering challenges of the project—it relied on gravity to allow the water to flow, carefully following the contours of the terrain from Ware into London, and dropping around just five inches per mile (8 cm/km)—were not Myddelton&#x27;s only worries. He also faced considerable opposition from landowners who feared that the New River would reduce the value of their farmland (they argued that floods or overflowing might create quagmires that could trap livestock); others were concerned at the possible disruption to road transport networks between Hertfordshire and the capital. The project nearly foundered when a few landowners flatly refused to agree to allow the river across their land.

When it was originally constructed, long sections, for example around Forty Hall and in Hornsey, wound around the heads of small tributary valleys of the Lea. Other sections of the river, including the one in Harringay, were carried across valleys in wooden aqueducts lined with lead and supported by strong timbers and brick piers. In at least one section, locals referred to the river as the &quot;boarded river&quot;. Improvements in canal construction in the eighteenth century led to these sections being replaced by clay-banked canals.

In 1620, the New River Company found that the springs were not sufficient to supply their customers, and dug a half-mile extension to feed the New River from the nearby River Lea to supplement the water from the springs. A mechanical gauge regulates the amount taken.

On 9 January 1622 King James rode from Theobalds after dinner to see the ice on the New River and fell in head first so that his companions could only see his boots. He was rescued by Sir Richard Young and returned to a warm bed at Theobalds.

==Later alterations==
Originally the New River&#x27;s course was above ground throughout, but in the second half of the 19th century some sections were put underground, enabling the course to be straightened. 

A winding original section of the channel that used to run through the town centre of Enfield has been cut off from the main flow, but is still maintained as an important local civic amenity called the New River Loop. The New River was returned to its original course along the Enfield Loop for a period between 1940 and 1952 after a bomb hit the pipes run to divert it.

Another large loop originally ran around the Devonshire Hill area in north Wood Green and southern Enfield. This loop was cut off when the Wood Green tunnel, which starts at Bowes Park, was completed in 1852. The loop existed for some decades, but was completely filled in and lost by the early 1900s. Now entirely covered by residential development dating mostly back to the 1930s, its former course is visible on numerous maps drawn in the 1800s and early 1900s.

In March 1946, the last filter beds at New River Head were decommissioned to make way for the Metropolitan Water Board&#x27;s new offices, and the section of the New River south of Stoke Newington was abandoned. In 1950, the pipes used to carry the water in this section were excavated, and some were reused elsewhere in the water supply network.

The New River Aqueduct (51°40&#x27;58.6&quot;N 0°03&#x27;16.0&quot;W) was built in 1985 to carry the New River, then running on an embankment, over the London Orbital Motorway (M25) which was then being constructed. The aqueduct carries the river in two parallel concrete boxes each 90 m long, 4.25 m wide and 2 m deep. The double box design allowed the temporary diversion of the river during construction and also enables maintenance to be undertaken on either side without stopping the flow.

== Present day ==

The New River is still in use today, transferring around 220 million litres of water per day — 8% of London&#x27;s total use.

Near Turkey Brook in Enfield, water is taken from the New River via the Northern Transfer Tunnel, which feeds King George V Reservoir at the top of the Lee Valley Reservoir Chain. Further south, adjacent to Alexandra Park, water is taken from the New River for treatment at Hornsey Water Treatment Works. The New River now terminates at the East Reservoir in Stoke Newington, into which its flow is entirely diverted. Water from Stoke Newington is transferred to the lower end of the Lee Valley reservoirs via the Amhurst Main, which has a capacity of 90 million litres per day, for treatment at the Coppermills Water Treatment Works.

During times of low water flow, the New River can be supplemented with water pumped from a series of boreholes along its route, with this water being treated at Hornsey or Coppermills. When a surplus of water is available, treated water from Coppermills is injected back into the aquifer for storage as part of the North London Artificial Recharge Scheme.

The former route of the New River between Stoke Newington and its terminus at New River Head can be seen in gaps in the urban fabric along Petherton Road (Petherton Green), through Canonbury and along Astey&#x27;s Row (New River Walk) and along Colebrooke Row/Duncan Terrace (Colebrooke Row Gardens and Duncan Terrace Gardens).

==Dame Alice Owen&#x27;s School bombing==
On 15 October 1940, approximately 150 people were sheltering in the basement of Dame Alice Owen&#x27;s School, then situated on Goswell Road. A large parachute mine hit the building directly, causing the structure to collapse and blocking access to the basement. The blast wave from the bomb caused the pipeline carrying the New River to rupture, flooding the shelter and killing the majority of the people taking cover.

A memorial to the victims of the bombing stands in Owen&#x27;s Fields at the northern end of Goswell Road.

==Drownings and accidents==
Charles Lamb wrote an essay about a friend he calls G. D. (probably the blind poet George Dyer) who walked into the New River by accident but was rescued. From &quot;Amicus Redivivus&quot; in &quot;Essays of Elia&quot;:
Rochemont Barbauld, minister of the nearby Newington Green Unitarian Church and husband of Anna Laetitia Barbauld, went violently insane, attacked his wife, and committed suicide by drowning himself in the New River in 1811.

<text>The trumpeter finch (Bucanetes githagineus) is a small passerine bird in the finch family Fringillidae. It is mainly a desert species which is found in North Africa and Spain through to southern Asia. It has occurred as a vagrant in areas north of its breeding range.

==Taxonomy==
The trumpeter finch was formerly described in 1823 by the German naturalist Hinrich Lichtenstein under the binomial name &quot;Fringilla githaginea&quot; based on a specimen collected in Upper Egypt. The species is now placed together with Mongolian finch in the genus &quot;Bucanetes&quot; that was introduced in 1851 by Jean Cabanis. The genus name &quot;Bucanetes&quot; is from Ancient Greek βυκανητής : &quot;bukanētēs&quot; (variant transliteration of &quot;bykanētēs&quot;), &quot;trumpeter&quot;; from βυκάνη : &quot;bukánē&quot; : &quot;spiral trumpet, horn&quot;. The specific name &quot;githagineus&quot; is Latin from &quot; Githago&quot;, the corn cockle (from &quot;gith&quot;, &quot;coriander&quot;, and &quot;-ago&quot; &quot;resembling&quot;). Temminck believed that the bird&#x27;s name was derived from that of the plant.

The genus name &quot;Bucanetes&quot; is from Ancient Greek βυκανητής : &quot;bukanētēs&quot; (variant transliteration of &quot;bykanētēs&quot;), &quot;trumpeter&quot;; from βυκάνη : &quot;bukánē&quot; : &quot;spiral trumpet, horn&quot;. The specific name &quot;githagineus&quot; is Latin from &quot; Githago&quot;, the corn cockle (from &quot;gith&quot;, &quot;coriander&quot;, and &quot;-ago&quot; &quot;resembling&quot;). Temminck believed that the bird&#x27;s name was derived from that of the plant.

There are four recognised subspecies:
* &quot;B. g. amantum&quot; - - the Canary Islands
* &quot;B. g. zedlitzi&quot; - - North Africa and southeastern Spain
* &quot;B. g. githagineus&quot; - Egypt and Sudan
* &quot;B. g. crassirostris&quot; (Blyth, 1847) - from Turkey and the Sinai Peninsula in the west east through the Middle East and Central Asia to Rajasthan and Haryana in India.
It has been recorded as a vagrant in Great Britain with the first records there both occurring in 1971 in Suffolk and in Sutherland, Channel Island, Denmark, Sweden Germany and Austria. It is possibly a regular migrant in southern Europe away from Spain with records of flocks from Italy and Malta. There was a population in the Algarve in Portugal which originated from escaped cage birds.

==Description==
The trumpeter finch is a small, long-winged bird. It has a large head and short, very thick bill. The summer male has a red bill, grey head and neck, and pale brown upper parts. The breast, rump and tail are pink, the last having dark terminal feathers. Winter males, females and young birds are a very washed-out version of the breeding male. The song of this bird is a buzzing nasal trill, like a tin trumpet.

==Distribution and habitat==
The trumpeter finch breeds from the Canary Islands eastwards across North Africa, as far south as Mauritania, Mali and Chad, with isolated populations in Sudan and Ethiopia and Djibouti. In the Middle East, it is found in Egypt east to Iraq and south in the Arabian Peninsula to Yemen and Oman and north into Turkey and Armenia. In central Asia it ranges from Iran north to Kazakhstan and east to India. It has colonised southern Spain where breeding was first proved in 1971.

They are found in desert, semi-desert and the margins of deserts. They can also be found in vast open steppe areas where there are dry desolate hills with sparse low scrubby vegetation, edges of fields, on mountain slopes, in stony plains where there are no trees, cliffs, ravines, gorges and wadis. In the desert regions of northern Africa it can also occur in villages and gardens and in regions of open sandy desert it frequents oases. The European breeding population is found in habitats where there is no tree cover but there is sparse scrub less than a metre in height, while the birds in the Canary Islands nest on sandy plains with halophytic and xerophytic scrub, as well as in more typical habitats.

In the summer of 2005, there was a notable irruption of this species into northwestern Europe, with several birds reaching as far as England.

==Behaviour==
Trumpeter finches breed from February to June in monogamous pairs. The female builds a simple nest made of a loose collection of twigs, plat stems, down and fibres such as animal hair, grass fibres and sometimes feathers. It is placed in a shallow depression in the ground, in the shade of a rock, bush or a tussock of grass. It may also be situated as high as to above ground in a pipe or wall. The clutch is normally 4–6 eggs. They are mainly vegetarian and their diet consists of small seeds, shoots and buds of grasses and low ground-loving plants. They will eat some insects as well, mainly grasshoppers. Trumpeter finches can be resident, dispersive or nomadic. They can occur in pairs or they form flocks of up to 20 individuals; larger flocks can form outside the breeding season, frequently made up of largely juvenile birds, rarely reaching 1,000 birds. In then Canary Islands they form mixed flocks with common linnets and Spanish sparrows. They will fly quite long distances in the late afternoons and in the evenings to find drinking water. The population in Spain is supported by birds dispersing from North Africa joining its population.

<doc id="372477" wikidata="Q298845" url="?curid=372477" title="Saint Florian">
<text>Florian (; AD 250 – 304) was a Christian holy man and the patron saint of chimney sweeps; soapmakers, and firefighters. His feast day is 4 May. Florian is also the patron saint of Poland, the city of Linz, Austria, and Upper Austria, jointly with Leopold III, Margrave of Austria.

==Life==
Florian was born around AD 250 in the ancient Roman city of Aelium Cetium, present-day Sankt Pölten, Austria. He joined the Roman Army and advanced in the ranks, rising to commander of the imperial army in the Roman province of Noricum. In addition to his military duties, he was also responsible for organizing and leading firefighting brigades. Florian organized and trained an elite group of soldiers whose sole duty was to fight fires.

During the Diocletianic Persecution of Christians, reports reached Rome that Florian was not enforcing the proscriptions against Christians in his territory. Aquilinus was sent to investigate these reports. When Aquilinus ordered Florian to offer sacrifice to the Roman gods in accordance with Roman religion, Florian refused. Florian was sentenced to be burned at the stake. Standing on the funeral pyre, Florian is reputed to have challenged the Roman soldiers to light the fire, saying &quot;If you wish to know that I am not afraid of your torture, light the fire, and in the name of the Lord I will climb onto it.&quot; Apprehensive of his words, the soldiers did not burn Florian, but executed him by drowning him in the Enns River with a millstone tied around his neck instead.

His body was later retrieved by Christians and buried at an Augustinian monastery near Lorch. Later a woman named Valeria had a vision in which she saw him; Florian, in this vision, declared his intent to be buried in a more appropriate location.

==Veneration==
Florian is very widely venerated in Central Europe. His feast day is 4 May. The Austrian town of Sankt Florian is named after him. According to legend, his body was interred at St. Florian Monastery, around which the town grew up.

Florian was adopted as patron saint of Poland in 1184, when Pope Lucius III consented to the request of Prince Casimir II to send relics of Florian to that country. Kraków thus claims some of his relics.

A statue of Florian by Josef Josephu was unveiled in Vienna in 1935. It stood at the main firehouse of Vienna, in the city&#x27;s main square, Am Hof. After the firehouse was bombed in 1945 during World War II the statue was moved on to the Fire Brigade Museum (&quot;Wiener Feuerwehrmuseum&quot;).

Seeking the sponsorship of a helpful saint was and still is a part of the namegiving practice in Catholic areas. In the southern, Catholic, parts of the German Empire (mainly present Bavaria and Austria), peasants regularly have used the name, Florian, as one of the given names for at least one of their male children: to secure the saint&#x27;s patronage against fire. Hence the given name is still widespread in these areas.

St Florian was also celebrated in Hungary.

Two statues celebrating Saint Vendel and Saint Florian are in a small square in Zalavar village.  They sit on separate similar plinths next to each other. (This arrangement and the style of the statues appears to be in the period 1900-1930. 

The statues are not outside the village churches. (Many villages in west Hungary have two christian churches - catholic and protestant.) 

Before 1920 german was the dominant language in hundreds of villages in Hungary, although Zalavar appears to be not in the main german speaking areas. 

A Zalavar monument listing people who died in World Wars 1 &amp; 2 has two or three names of german origin. Zalavar cemetery has very few graves displaying names of german origin. I

In oldest section of the cemetery furthest from the road most graves have no headstone.)

===Patronage===
Florian is a patron saint of Upper Austria and Poland; also firefighters, chimneysweeps, and brewers. Florian is associated with brewers because of a legendary incident in which he miraculously stopped a fire with a single pitcher of water. That is why he is often depicted holding a pitcher. Florian is also the patron of chimney sweeps, Austria, Poland and soap boilers.

Florian is invoked against fires, floods, lightning, and the pains of Purgatory.

A famous St. Florian&#x27;s Church is located in Kraków, Poland. His veneration has been particularly intense since 1528, when a fire burned the neighborhood without destroying the church.

The &quot;Florian Principle&quot; (known in German language areas as &quot;Sankt-Florians-Prinzip&quot;) is named after a somewhat ironic prayer to Saint Florian: &quot;&quot;O heiliger Sankt Florian, verschon&#x27; mein Haus, zünd&#x27; and&#x27;re an&quot;,&quot; equivalent to &quot;O Holy St. Florian, please spare my house, set fire to another one&quot;. This saying is used in German much like the English &quot;not in my back yard&quot;, when the speaker wants to point out that some person tries to get out of an unpleasant situation by an action that will put others in that very same situation.

In Austria and Germany, &quot;Florian&quot; is the call sign for fire engines. 

The protagonist in Felix Salten&#x27;s novel &quot;&quot; was named after Florian, as the animal was born on 4 May 1901 in Lipizza, Austria.

Alfred Schnittke&#x27;s Symphony No. 2, is subtitled &quot;St. Florian&quot;.

In multiple cities across Slovakia, streets are named after Saint Florian, often in correlation with local fire departments. Florian Street (&quot;Floriánska ulica&quot;) occurs in historic boroughs of major cities: currently in Košice (Staré Mesto) and also formerly in Bratislava (Staré Mesto).

<text>The video game industry is the tertiary and quaternary sectors of the entertainment industry that specialize in the development, marketing, distribution, monetization, and consumer feedback of video games. The industry encompasses dozens of job disciplines and thousands of jobs worldwide.

The video game industry has grown from niche to mainstream. , video games generated annually in global sales. In the US, the industry earned about in 2007, in 2008, and 2010, according to the ESA annual report. Research from Ampere Analysis indicated three points: the sector has consistently grown since at least 2015 and expanded 26% from 2019 to 2021, to a record ; the global games and services market is forecast to shrink 1.2% annually to in 2022.

The industry has influenced the technological advancement of personal computers through sound cards, graphics cards and 3D graphic accelerators, CPUs, and co-processors like PhysX. Sound cards, for example, were originally developed for games and then improved for adoptation by the music industry.

== Industry overview ==
=== Size ===
In 2017 in the United States, which represented about a third of the global video game market, the Entertainment Software Association estimated that there were over 2,300 development companies and over 525 publishing companies, including in hardware and software manufacturing, service providers, and distributors. These companies in total have nearly 66,000 direct employees. When including indirect employment, such as a developer using the services of a graphics design package from a different firm, the total number of employees involved in the video game industry rises above 220,000.

=== Value chain ===
Traditionally, the video game industry has had six connected layers in its value chain based on the retail distribution of games:
# Game development, representing programmers, designers, and artists, and their leadership, with support of middleware and other development tools.
# Publishing, which typically includes both the source of funding the development of a video game, as well as providing the marketing and advertising for a game.
# Distribution, whether through retail or digital channels. Distribution typically includes manufacturing and duplication of game media and packaging for retail games.
# Retailer, storefront where the game is sold.
# Consumers, the purchasers and players of video games
# Hardware platform manufacturers, which can own and place limitations for content on the platform they have made, charging license fees to developers or publishers.

As games have transitioned from the retail to more digital market, parts of this value chain have become redundant. For example, the distributor may be redundant as a function of either the publisher or the retailer, or even in some cases as the case of indie games, the function of the developer themselves.

=== Roles ===
Ben Sawyer of Digitalmill observes that the development side of the industry is made up of six connected and distinctive layers:
# Capital and publishing layer: involved in paying for development of new games and seeking returns through licensing of the properties.
# Product and talent layer: includes developers, designers and artists, who may be working under individual contracts or as part of in-house development teams.
# Production and tools layer: generates content production tools, game development middleware, customizable game engines, and production management tools.
# Distribution layer: or the &quot;publishing&quot; industry, involved in generating and marketing catalogs of games for retail and online distribution.
# Hardware (or Virtual Machine or Software Platform) layer: or the providers of the underlying platform, which may be console-based, accessed through online media, or accessed through mobile devices such as smartphones. This layer includes network infrastructure and non-hardware platforms such as virtual machines (such as Java or Flash), or software platforms such as browsers or Facebook.
# End-users layer: or the players of the games.

The game industry employs those experienced in other traditional businesses, but some have experience tailored to the game industry. Some of the disciplines specific to the game industry include: game programmer, game designer, level designer, game producer, game artist, and game tester. Most of these professionals are employed by video game developers or video game publishers. However, many hobbyists also produce computer games and sell them commercially. Game developers and publishers sometimes employ those with extensive or long-term experience within the modding communities.

== History ==

=== 1940s–1960s ===

Prior to the 1970s, there was no significant commercial aspect of the video game industry, but many advances in computing would set the stage for the birth of the industry.

Many early publicly available interactive computer-based game machines used or other mechanisms to mimic a display; while technically not &quot;video games&quot;, they had elements of interactivity between the player and the machine. Some examples of these included the 1940 &quot;Nimatron&quot;, an electromagnetic relay-based Nim-playing device designed by Edward Condon and built by Westinghouse Electric for the New York World&#x27;s Fair, &quot;Bertie the Brain&quot;, an arcade game of tic-tac-toe, built by Josef Kates for the 1950 Canadian National Exhibition, and Nimrod created by engineering firm Ferranti for the 1951 Festival of Britain.

The development of cathode-ray tube, the core technology inside televisions, created several of the first true video games. In 1947, Thomas T. Goldsmith Jr. and Estle Ray Mann filed a patent for a &quot;cathode ray tube amusement device&quot;. Their game, which uses a cathode-ray tube hooked to an oscilloscope display, challenges players to fire a gun at target.

Between the 1950s and 1960s, with mainframe computers becoming available to campus colleges, students and others started to develop games that could be played at terminals that accessed the mainframe. One of the first known examples is &quot;Spacewar!&quot;, developed by Harvard and MIT employees Martin Graetz, Steve Russell, and Wayne Wiitanen. The introduction of easy-to-program languages like BASIC for mainframes allowed for more simplistic games to be developed.

The arcade video game industry grew out of the pre-existing arcade game industry, which was previously dominated by electro-mechanical games (EM games). Following the arrival of Sega&#x27;s EM game &quot;Periscope&quot; (1966), the arcade industry was experiencing a &quot;technological renaissance&quot; driven by &quot;audio-visual&quot; EM novelty games, establishing the arcades as a healthy environment for the introduction of commercial video games in the early 1970s. In the late 1960s, a college student named Nolan Bushnell had a part-time job at an arcade where he became familiar with EM games such as Chicago Coin&#x27;s racing game &quot;Speedway&quot; (1969), watching customers play and helping to maintain the machinery, while learning how it worked and developing his understanding of how the game business operates.

=== 1970s ===
In 1971, the first commercial arcade video game, &quot;Computer Space&quot;, was released. The following year, Atari, Inc. released the first commercially successful video game, &quot;Pong&quot;, and 19,000 arcade cabinets of the original arcade version were sold. In that year, video games were introduced to the home market with the release of the early video game console, the Magnavox Odyssey. However, both the arcade and home markets would be dominated by &quot;Pong&quot; clones, which flooded the market and led to the video game crash of 1977. The crash eventually came to an end with the success of Taito&#x27;s &quot;Space Invaders&quot;, released in 1978, inspiring the golden age of video arcade games. The game&#x27;s success prompted the prevalence of arcade machines in mainstream locations such as shopping malls, traditional storefronts, restaurants, and convenience stores during the golden age. More than 360,000 &quot;Space Invaders&quot; arcade cabinets were sold worldwide, and by 1982, generated a revenue of (equivalent to $ in ) in quarters.

&quot;Space Invaders&quot; was soon licensed for the Atari VCS (later known as Atari 2600), becoming the first &quot;killer app&quot; and quadrupling the console&#x27;s sales. The success of the Atari 2600 in turn revived the home video game market during the second generation of consoles, until the video game crash of 1983. By the end of the 1970s, the personal computer game industry began forming from a hobby culture.

=== 1980s ===
In the early 1980s, the golden age of video arcade games reached its zenith. The total sales of arcade video game machines in North America increased significantly during this period, from $50 million in 1978 to $900 million by 1981, with the arcade video game industry&#x27;s revenue in North America tripling to $2.8 billion in 1980. By 1981, the arcade video game industry was generating an annual North American revenue of (equivalent to $ in ). In 1982, the arcade video game industry reached its peak, generating $8 billion in quarters, surpassing the annual gross revenue of both pop music ($4 billion) and Hollywood films ($3 billion) combined. This was also nearly twice as much as the $3.8 billion generated by the home video game industry that year; both the arcade and home video game markets combined in 1982 total of (equivalent to $ in ). The arcade video game industry would continue to generate an annual revenue of $5 billion in quarters through to 1985. The most successful game of this era was Namco&#x27;s &quot;Pac-Man&quot;, released in 1980, of which more than 350,000 cabinets were eventually sold, and within a year, collected more than $1 billion in quarters; in total, &quot;Pac-Man&quot; is estimated to have grossed over 10 billion quarters ($2.5 billion) during the 20th century.

In the early 1980s, 8-bit home computing and home-made games boomed. This was especially in Europe (with the ZX Spectrum and Commodore 64) and in Asia (with the NEC PC-88 and MSX). Video game journalism arose at that time, which was later expanded to include covermounted cassettes and CDs. In 1983, the North American industry crashed due to the production of too many badly developed games (quantity over quality), resulting in the fall of the North American industry. The industry would eventually be revitalized by the release of the Nintendo Entertainment System, which resulted in the home console market being dominated by Japanese companies such as Nintendo, while a professional European video game industry also began taking shape with companies such as Ocean Software and Gremlin Interactive. In 1987, Nintendo lost a legal challenge against Blockbuster Entertainment, which continued game rentals in the same way as movies. In 1989, the Game Boy handheld system was launched.

Video games transitioned from having been showcased at general trade shows like Consumer Electronics Show, to dedicated shows like Nintendo Space World and Electronic Entertainment Expo.

=== 1990s ===

Game related technology advances of the 1990s include these:

* The &quot;3D Revolution&quot; where 3D polygon graphics became the &quot;de facto&quot; standard for video game visual presentation, initially in the arcades during the early 1990s, and then on home systems with 3D consoles and PC graphics cards in the mid-1990s.
* The widespread adoption of CD-based storage and software distribution
* Continuing advancement of CPU speed and sophistication
* Widespread adoption of GUI-based operating systems, such as the series of Amiga OS, Microsoft Windows and Mac OS
* Shrinking of hardware, with handheld game consoles and mobile phones, which enabled mobile gaming
* The emergence of the Internet, which in the late 1990s enabled online cooperative play and competitive gaming

Aside from technology, in the early part of the decade, licensed games became more popular, as did video game sequels.

The arcades experienced a renaissance in the early 1990s following the release of &quot;Street Fighter II&quot; (1991), which led to a number of other popular fighting games such as &quot;Fatal Fury&quot; (1991) and &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; (1992). The arcade resurgence was further driven by increasing realism, with the &quot;3D Revolution&quot; from 2D and pseudo-3D graphics to true real-time 3D polygon graphics, following the release of games such as &quot;Virtua Racing&quot; (1992) and &quot;Virtua Fighter&quot; (1993). In the late 1990s, there was a transition away from arcades to home systems. Until about 1996-1997, arcade video games represented the largest sector of the global video game industry, before arcades declined and the console market surpassed arcade video games for the first time around 1997-1998. Arcade systems such as the Sega Model 3 remained more technologically advanced than home systems in the late 1990s, but the gap between arcade and home systems began narrowing in the late 1990s.

The video game industry generated worldwide sales of in 1993 (equivalent to $ in ), in 1994 (equivalent to $ in ), and an estimated in 1998 (equivalent to $ in ). In the United States alone, in 1994, arcades generated in quarters while home console game sales generated Combined, this was nearly two and a half times the revenue generated by movies in the United States at the time.

=== 2000s ===
In 2000s, the video game industry was in heavy development; profit still drove technological advancement used by other industry sectors. Technologies such as Smartphones, virtual reality, and augmented reality were major drivers for game hardware and gameplay development. Though maturing, the video game industry was still very volatile, with third-party video game developers quickly cropping up, and just as quickly, going out of business. Nevertheless, many casual games and indie games became successful, such as &quot;Braid&quot; and &quot;Limbo&quot;. Game development for mobile phones (such as iOS and Android devices) and social networking sites emerged. For example, a Facebook game developer, Zynga, raised more than $300 million.

=== 2010s ===

Indie games are not the main driver but significantly impact the industry, such as &quot;Spelunky&quot;, &quot;Fez&quot;, &quot;Don&#x27;t Starve&quot;, &quot;Castle Crashers&quot;, and &quot;Minecraft&quot;, with millions of dollars and users. In the 2010s, the shift increased to casual and mobile gaming, and in 2016, the mobile video game market was estimated at $38 billion in revenues, compared to $6 billion for the console market and $33 billion for personal computing gaming. Virtual reality and augmented reality games arose during this decade. As of 2014, newer game companies arose that vertically integrate live operations and publishing such as crowdfunding and other direct-to-consumer efforts, rather than relying on a traditional publishers, and some of these grew substantially. Spurred by some initial events in the late 2000s, eSports centered around professional players in organized competitions and leagues for prize money, grew greatly over this decade, drawing hundreds of millions of viewers and reaching nearly $500 million in revenue by 2016 and expected to break $1 billion by 2019.

=== 2020s ===

The next generations of Xbox Series X/S and PlayStation 5 were planned for 2020, but the video game industry was affected by the COVID-19 pandemic that had a worldwide impact starting in March 2020 due to forced stay-at-home orders by governmental regulations. There were similar impacts to the video game industry as with other industries, such as cancellation of in-person trade shows, conventions and esports events, and the delay of many games into late 2020, 2021, or beyond, and the industry was one of the few to actually thrive from a home-bound population using video games to cope. The market had a 20% year-to-year growth from 2019, reaching over in global revenue in both hardware and software for 2020. Easily learned games with high social interactions were popular, including &quot;Animal Crossing: New Horizons&quot;, &quot;Fall Guys&quot;, and &quot;Among Us&quot;.

As the pandemic wore on from 2020 into 2021, a secondary effect was the impact of the global semiconductor chip shortage on hardware manufacturing. The three major console vendors, Nintendo, Microsoft, and Sony, were impacted by availability of supply of core components, and for the latter two, limited the launch of their new consoles. The chip supply shortage also affected personal computer gamers, coupled with demand for computer parts to be used in cryptocurrency mining, which artificially raised prices and made it difficult to purchase newer components. However, after cryptocurrency mining started paying out less during and following the 2021–2022 cryptocurrency crash, computer parts such as GPUs have become more affordable as of August 2022.

== Economics ==

Early development costs were minimal, and video games could be quite profitable. Games developed by a single programmer, or by a small team of programmers and artists, could sell hundreds of thousands of copies each. Many of these games only took a few months to create, so developers could release multiple games per year. Thus, publishers could often be generous with benefits, such as royalties on the games sold. Many early game publishers started from this economic climate, such as Origin Systems, Sierra Entertainment, Capcom, Activision and Electronic Arts.

As computing and graphics power increased, so too did the size of development teams, as larger staffs were needed to address the ever-increasing technical and design complexities. The larger teams consist of programmers, artists, game designers, and producers. Their salaries can range anywhere from $50,000 to $120,000 generating large labor costs for firms producing video games which can often take between one and three years to develop. Modern budgets typically reach millions of dollars and use middleware and pre-built game engines. In addition to growing development costs, marketing budgets have grown dramatically, sometimes two to three times of the cost of development.

Traditionally, the video game monetization method is to sell hard copies in retail store. Cheaper production and distribution methods include online distribution.

In the 2010s, the video game industry had a major impact on the economy through the sales of major systems and games such as &quot;Call of Duty: Black Ops&quot;, which had over $650 million of sales in the game&#x27;s first five days and which set a five-day global record for a movie, book or video game. The game&#x27;s income was more than the opening weekend of &quot;Spider-Man 3&quot; and the previous title holder for a video game &quot;Halo 3&quot;. Many individuals have also benefited from the economic success of video games including the former chairman of Nintendo and Japan&#x27;s third richest man: Hiroshi Yamauchi. By 2014, the global video game market was valued at over $93 billion.

The industry wide adoption of high-definition graphics during the seventh generation of consoles greatly increased development teams&#x27; sizes and reduced the number of high-budget, high-quality games under development. In 2013 Richard Hilleman of Electronic Arts estimated that only 25 developers were working on such games for the eighth console generation, compared to 125 at the same point in the seventh generation-console cycle seven or eight years earlier.

By 2018, the United States video game industry had matched that of the United States film industry on basis of revenue, with both having made around that year.

Since 2000, the video game industry was considered recession-proof, having thrived compared to other industries during the 2008 Great Recession, and as one of the more profitable industries during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 and 2021. Video games are seen as a low-cost vice and entertainment for consumers when approaching recession. However, in 2022, atop pandemic economic fallout including chip shortages, supply chain disruption, and consumers preferring outdoor activities, the industry started to indicate recession with global revenues falling for the first time in twenty years.

=== Retail ===

The industry&#x27;s shift from brick and mortar retail to digital downloads led to a severe sales decline at video game retailers such as GameStop, following other media retailers superseded by Internet delivery, such as Blockbuster, Tower Records, and Virgin Megastores. GameStop diversified its services by purchasing chains that repair wireless devices and expanding its trade-in program through which customers trade used games for credit towards new games. The company began to produce its own merchandise and games. In Britain, the games retailer Game revamped its stores so customers would spend time playing games there. It built a gaming arena for events and tournaments. The shift to digital marketplaces, especially for smartphones, led to an influx of inexpensive and disposable games, and lower engagement among gamers who otherwise purchased new games from retail. Customers also shifted away from the tradition of buying games on their first day of release.

Publishers often funded trade-in deals to encourage consumers to purchase new games. Trade-in customers at the Australian retailer Game would purchase twice the games per year as non-trade-in customers. The sale of pre-owned games kept retailers in business, and composed about a third of Game&#x27;s revenue. Retailers also saved on the UK&#x27;s value-added tax, which only taxed the retailer&#x27;s profit on pre-owned games, rather than the full sale on regular games. The former trade-in retail executives behind the trade-in price comparison site Trade In Detectives estimated that the United Kingdom&#x27;s trade-in industry was about a third of the size of its new games business. They figured that sites such as eBay, which convert used games into cash, compose about a quarter of the UK&#x27;s trade-in market, but do not keep the credit within the industry. While consumers might appear to receive better offers on these sites, they also take about 15 percent of the selling price in fees. Alternatively, some retailers will match the trade-in values offered by their competitors. Microsoft&#x27;s original plan for the Xbox One attempted to translate trade-in deals for the digital marketplace, with a database of product licenses that shops would be able to resell with publisher permission, though the plan was poorly received or poorly sold.

== Practices ==
Video game industry practices are similar to those of other entertainment industries (e.g., the music recording industry), but the video game industry in particular has been accused of treating its development talent poorly. This promotes independent development, as developers leave to form new companies and projects. In some notable cases, these new companies grow large and impersonal, having adopted the business practices of their forebears, and ultimately perpetuate the cycle.

However, unlike the music industry, where modern technology has allowed a fully professional product to be created extremely inexpensively by an independent musician, modern games require increasing amounts of manpower and equipment. This dynamic makes publishers, who fund the developers, much more important than in the music industry.

=== Breakaways ===
In the video game industry, it is common for developers to leave their current studio and start their own. A particularly famous case is the &quot;original&quot; independent developer Activision, founded by former Atari developers. Activision grew to become the world&#x27;s second largest game publisher. In the meantime, many of the original developers left to work on other projects. For example, founder Alan Miller left Activision to start another video game development company, Accolade (now Atari née Infogrames).

Activision was popular among developers for giving them credit in the packaging and title screens for their games, while Atari disallowed this practice. As the video game industry took off in the mid-1980s, many developers faced the more distressing problem of working with fly-by-night or unscrupulous publishers that would either fold unexpectedly or run off with the game profits.

=== Piracy ===
The industry claims software piracy to be a big problem, and takes measures to counter this.
Digital rights management have proved to be the most unpopular with gamers, as a measure to counter piracy.
The most popular and effective strategy to counter piracy is to change the business model to freemium, where gamers pay for their in-game needs or service. Strong server-side security is required for this, to properly distinguish authentic transactions from hacked transactions.

=== Creative control ===
On various Internet forums, some gamers have expressed disapproval of publishers having creative control since publishers are more apt to follow short-term market trends rather than invest in risky but potentially lucrative ideas. On the other hand, publishers may know better than developers what consumers want. The relationship between video game developers and publishers parallels the relationship between recording artists and record labels in many ways. But unlike the music industry, which has seen flat or declining sales in the early 2000s, the video game industry continues to grow.

In the computer games industry, it is easier to create a startup, resulting in many successful companies. The console industry is more closed, and a game developer must have up to three licenses from the console manufacturer:
# A license to develop games for the console
# The publisher must have a license to publish games for the console
# A separate license for each game

In addition, the developer must usually buy development systems from the console manufacturer in order to develop a game for consideration, as well as obtain concept approval for the game from the console manufacturer. Therefore, the developer normally has to have a publishing deal in place before starting development on a game project, but in order to secure a publishing deal, the developer must have a track record of console development, something which few startups will have.

=== Alternatives ===
An alternative method for publishing video games is to self-publish using the shareware or open source model over the Internet.

=== Gaming conventions ===

Gaming conventions are an important showcase of the industry. The major annual video game conventions include Gamescom in Cologne (Germany), E3 in Los Angeles (US), Penny Arcade Expo, Summer Games Fest, Tokyo Game Show(TGS), Brazil Game Show(BGS), etc. 

=== Regional distribution ===
As with other forms of media, video games have often been released in different world regions at different times. The practice has been used where localization is not done in parallel with the rest of development or where the game must be encoded differently, as in PAL vs. NTSC. It has also been used to provide price discrimination in different markets or to focus limited marketing resources. Developers may also stagger digital releases so as not to overwhelm the servers hosting the game.

== International practices ==
The video game industry had its primary roots in the United States following the introduction of arcade games and console systems, with Japan soon following. With the introduction of the personal computer, Western Europe also became a major center for video game development. Since then, the industry is primarily led by companies in North America, Europe, and Japan, but other regions, including Australia/New Zealand, and other East Asian countries including China and South Korea, have become significant sectors for the industry.

=== World trends ===
International video game revenue was over $142B in 2022. This is almost double the revenue of the international film industry in 2023.

The largest nations by estimated video game revenues in 2016 are the United States ($46.4B), China ($44B), and Japan ($19.1B). 

The gaming industry saw strong growth in 2020, the first year of the pandemic, and this trend continued into 2021.

=== Largest markets ===
According to market research firm Newzoo, the following countries are the largest video game markets by annual revenue, :

According to market research firm Newzoo, the following countries are the largest video game markets by number of players in the top 10 richest video game markets, :

In general, spending on gaming tends to increase with increase in nominal GDP. However, gaming is relatively more popular in East Asia, and relatively less popular in India.


=== North America ===

==== Canada ====
Canada has the third largest video game industry in terms of employment numbers. The video game industry has also been booming in Montreal since 1997, coinciding with the opening of Ubisoft Montreal. Recently, the city has attracted world leading game developers and publishers studios such as Ubisoft, EA, Eidos Interactive, Artificial Mind and Movement, BioWare, Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment, and Strategy First, mainly because video games jobs have been heavily subsidized by the provincial government. Every year, this industry generates billions of dollars and thousands of jobs in the Montreal area. Vancouver has also developed a particularly large cluster of video game developers, the largest of which, Electronic Arts, employs over two thousand people. The &quot;Assassin&#x27;s Creed&quot; series, along with the &quot;Tom Clancy&quot; series have all been produced in Canada and have achieved worldwide success. For consumers, the largest video games convention in Canada is the Enthusiast Gaming Live Expo (EGLX).

==== United States ====
The video game industry got its start in the United States in the late 1970s and early 1980s with the creation of arcade games like &quot;Pong&quot; and the first home console, the Magnavox Odyssey. Several factors, including loss of publishing control, a flooded market, and competition from personal computers, led to the 1983 video game crash in the U.S., affecting both arcades and home game systems. Nintendo&#x27;s introduction of the Nintendo Entertainment System helped to revitalize the industry, but until Microsoft&#x27;s introduction of the Xbox in the early 2000s, the hardware side was dominated by mostly Japanese-developed systems. Instead, much of the industry&#x27;s growth in the U.S. was on game development, implementing new game technologies and gameplay concepts, as well as creating the large-scale publisher model used by companies like Electronic Arts to support marketing and distribution of games.

The United States has the largest video games presence in the world in terms of total industry employees. In 2017, the U.S. game industry as a whole was worth US$18.4 billion and consisted of roughly 2457 companies that had a rough total of 220,000 people employed. U.S. video game revenue is forecast to reach $230 billion by 2022, making it the largest video game market in the world. Over 150 million Americans play video games, with an average age of 35 and a gender breakdown of 59 percent male and 41 percent female. American gamers are more likely to vote than non-gamers, feel that the economy is the most important political issue, and lean conservative, however party demographics are split evenly with 38% identifying as Democrats, 38% identifying as Republicans, and 24% identifying as Independents.

===Europe===
==== Germany ====
Germany has the largest video games market in Europe, with revenues of $4.1 billion forecast for 2017. The annual Gamescom in Cologne is Europe&#x27;s largest video game expo.

One of the earliest internationally successful video game companies was Gütersloh-based Rainbow Arts (founded in 1984) who were responsible for publishing the popular &quot;Turrican&quot; series of games. The Anno series and The Settlers series are globally popular strategy game franchises since the 1990s. The Gothic series, and Risen are established RPG franchises. The X series by Egosoft is the best-selling space simulation. The FIFA Manager series was also developed in Germany. The German action game Spec Ops: The Line (2012) was successful in the markets and received largely positive reviews. One of the most famed game from Germany is &quot;Far Cry&quot; (2004) by Frankfurt-based Crytek, who also produced the topseller &quot;Crysis&quot; and its sequels later.

Other well-known current and former developers from Germany include Ascaron, Blue Byte, Deck13, EA Phenomic, Piranha Bytes, Radon Labs, Related Designs, Spellbound Entertainment and Yager Development. Publishers include Deep Silver (Plaion), dtp entertainment, Kalypso Media and Nintendo Europe. Bigpoint Games, Gameforge, Goodgame Studios and Wooga are among the world&#x27;s leading browser game and social network game developers/distributors.

==== United Kingdom ====

The United Kingdom&#x27;s video game industry is the third largest in the world in terms of developer success and sales of hardware and software by country alone but fourth behind Canada in terms of people employed. The size of the UK game industry is comparable to its film or music industries.

Like most European countries, the UK entered the video game industry through personal computers rather than video game consoles. Low-cost computers like the ZX Spectrum and Amiga 500 led to numerous &quot;bedroom coders&quot; that would make and sell games through mail-order or to distributors that helped to mass-produce them. Coupled with quirky british humour, the &quot;Britsoft&quot; wave of popular games led to a number of influential people and studios in the 1990s. As game programming became more complex and costly in the early 2000s, more traditional studio structures arose to support both personal computers and consoles, with several studios that, in some form or another, remain highly regarded and influential in the present.

Some of the studios have become defunct or been purchased by larger companies such as &quot;LittleBigPlanet&quot; developer Media Molecule, and Codemasters. The country is home to some of the world&#x27;s most successful video game franchises, such as &quot;Tomb Raider&quot;, &quot;Grand Theft Auto&quot;, &quot;Fable&quot;, &quot;Colin McRae Dirt&quot;, and &quot;Total War&quot;.

The country also went without tax relief until March 21, 2012 when the British government changed its mind on tax relief for UK developers, which without, meant most of the talented development within the UK may move overseas for more profit, along with parents of certain video game developers which would pay for having games developed in the UK. The industry trade body TIGA estimates that it will increase the games development sector&#x27;s contribution to UK GDP by £283 million, generate £172 million in new and protected tax receipts to HM Treasury, and could cost just £96 million over five years. Before the tax relief was introduced there was a fear that the UK game industry could fall behind other leading game industries around the world such as France and Canada, of which Canada overtook the UK in terms of job numbers in the industry in 2010.

=== Africa ===
The video game industry is still in its infancy throughout the African continent, but due to the continent&#x27;s young population and increasing technological literacy, the sector is growing rapidly. African countries such as South Africa, Nigeria, and Kenya have been making rapid advances in mobile game development, both within their country and internationally, but due to limited funding and a market overcrowded with Western games, success has thus far been minimal.

===Asia===
====Bangladesh====
Video gaming is a relatively new sector in Bangladesh. Games have been developed since 2002, mostly independently. However, from 2014, some IT companies have started to develop video games commercially. Some research has been carried out at various universities to improve the video game development sector. In 2020, Zero Hour was released on Steam in Early Access with the version 1.0 being released on September 9, 2024 and has received positive reviews from gamers. It&#x27;s a first-person shooter. It is the first game from Bangladesh to be released on the platform.
==== China ====

China had not been a major factor in the global video game market early on due to economic factors, governmental oversight, and a black market for foreign products. The government initiated a ban on video game consoles in 2000 that lasted through 2014, during which China&#x27;s video game market grew for personal computer games, particularly subscription-based and microtransaction-based ones that were amenable to use in PC cafes, and later into mobile games. Media publishers like Tencent and NetEase focused on these types of games, growing successfully during the 2010s to become leading international companies. As of 2015, China&#x27;s video game market revenue exceeds that of the United States, and is the largest country by both revenue and number of players. China is also the largest contributor towards esports in both revenue and in the number of professional players from the country. The industry, like most media in China, is tightly controlled by the government, with strong restrictions on what content may be in games, and incorporation of anti-addiction measures to limit playtime. It is home to Asia Game Show, the largest game convention in the world by attendance.

==== Japan ====

The Japanese video game industry is markedly different from the industry in North America, Europe and Australia. Japan initially trailed the United States in entering the video game sector as its companies followed trends set by their American partners, but started to pioneer their own ideas soon after. Several Japanese-developed arcade games, such as &quot;Space Invaders&quot;, helped to usher in the golden age of arcade video games from 1978 to 1982. The 1983 video game crash that affected the North American market did have small but short-term effects in Japan, as most companies involved in the business were well-established and could weather the disruption. Nintendo took the opportunity to push the Nintendo Entertainment System, a rebranding of its Famicom system, into the Western markets after the crash, implementing technical and business practices to avoid the factors that created the 1983 crash but also secured its control on what games were published for the system. Japan became the dominant home for consoles and console games through the early 2000s, challenged only by the incorporation of large publishers in the West and the Xbox line of consoles from Microsoft. Nintendo along with companies like Sega, Sony Interactive Entertainment, and Capcom are dominant leaders in the Japanese video game industry.
Nintendo themselves are recognized for having created some of the most positively-reviewed and best-selling video game series such as &quot;Mario&quot;, &quot;Donkey Kong&quot;, &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot;, &quot;Metroid&quot; and &quot;Pokémon&quot;.
In recent years, consoles and arcade games have both been overtaken by downloadable free-to-play games on the PC and mobile platforms.

====India====
Video gaming in India is an emerging market since India is experiencing strong growth in online gaming, making it one of the top gaming markets in the world. Over the past few decades, the Indian gaming industry has gone from close to nonexistent in the 1990s to one of the top markets globally in the late 2010s. In 2019, the online gaming market in India was estimated at with an estimated 300 million gamers, a 41.6% increase from 2018. As of 2021, it is one of the top five mobile gaming markets in the world. The industry is projected to reach 510 million gamers by 2022.

====South Korea====
The video game industry in South Korea generally followed the same early trends as the Japanese market, but players started focusing on massively-multiplayer online games (MMO) and other games that could be played at PC bangs (Internet cafes). South Korea was one of the first major regions involved in esports in the 1990s and 2000s, and today a large number of professional esports players originate from South Korea.

=== Oceania ===

====Australia and New Zealand====
Australia and New Zealand have an active video game industry, with several standalone developers as well as additional studios from other major developers across the globe.

== Conventions, trade shows, and conferences ==
Gaming conventions are an important showcase of the industry. These typically provide the means for developers and publishers to demonstrate their games directly to video game players and consumers and obtain feedback. New games are frequently introduced during these events. Some examples of each conventions include the annual Gamescom in Cologne, and numerous PAX events. Some publishers, developers and technology producers also have their own regular conventions, with BlizzCon, QuakeCon, Nvision and the X shows being prominent examples.

National trade groups that support their local video game industry often will hold trade shows aimed for developers and publishers to interact more directly with the video game media, and with retailers and distributors for planning future sales of products. The largest such trade show was E3 in Los Angeles, California is held by the Entertainment Software Association. Other similar trade shows include Tokyo Game Show (Japan), Brasil Game Show (Brazil), EB Games Expo (Australia), KRI (Russia), ChinaJoy (China) and the annual Game Developers Conference.

The development of video games is also a topic of academic and professional interest, leading to a number of conferences for developers to share their knowledge with others. Two of the major professional conferences include the Game Developers Conference (GDC), which holds multiple events through the year but with its main annual conference held in March in San Francisco, and the D.I.C.E. Summit run by the Academy of Interactive Arts &amp; Sciences in February of each year in Las Vegas, Nevada.

==Media coverage and archiving==

The coverage of the video game industry started off with several magazines covering the topic, but as the Internet became widely available to support new media, much of the dedicated coverage of the video game industry has transitioned to detected websites, including &quot;Gamasutra&quot;, &quot;IGN&quot;, &quot;Eurogamer&quot;, &quot;Polygon&quot; and &quot;GameSpot&quot;. More recently, the effect of social media influencers, video game players that create online videos or stream themselves playing games through services like Twitch, have also become a significant source for coverage of video game news from the consumer point of view.

Another facet of tracking the history of the video game industry is video game preservation, a process that is complicated due to game hardware technology that can become obsolete, dependencies on decommissioned online servers, and issues over intellectual property that legally restricts preservation efforts. Much of the industry&#x27;s history prior to the 1983 crash has been lost, as companies affected by the crash simply threw material away, leaving little to recover today. There is better awareness of video game preservation into the 21st century, and several groups and museums have been established to collect and preserve hardware and software for the industry.

==Recognition within the industry==

The video game industry has a number of annual award ceremonies, commonly associated with the above conventions, trade shows, and conferences, as well as standalone award shows. Many of the dedicated video game journalism websites also have their own set of awards. Most commonly, these ceremonies are capped by the top prize, the &quot;Game of the Year&quot;.

== Trends ==

Players become fourth-party developers, allowing for more open source models of game design, development and engineering. Players also create modifications (mods), which in some cases become just as popular as the original game for which they were created. An example of this is the game &quot;Counter-Strike&quot;, which began as a mod of the video game &quot;Half-Life&quot; and eventually became a very successful, published game in its own right.

While this &quot;community of modifiers&quot; may only add up to approximately 1% of a particular game&#x27;s user base, the number of those involved will grow as more games offer modifying opportunities (such as, by releasing source code) and the video user base swells. According to Ben Sawyer, as many as 600,000 established online game community developers existed as of 2012. This effectively added a new component to the game industry value chain and if it continues to mature, it will integrate itself into the overall industry.

The industry has seen a shift towards games with multiplayer facilities. A larger percentage of games on all types of platforms include some type of competitive online multiplayer capability.

In addition, the industry is experiencing further significant change driven by convergence, with technology and player comfort being the two primary reasons for this wave of industry convergence. Video games and related content can now be accessed and played on a variety of media, including: cable television, dedicated consoles, handheld devices and smartphones, through social networking sites or through an ISP, through a game developer&#x27;s website, and online through a game console and/or home or office personal computer. In fact, 12% of U.S. households already make regular use of game consoles for accessing video content provided by online services such as Hulu and Netflix. In 2012, for the first time, entertainment usage passed multiplayer game usage on Xbox, meaning that users spent more time with online video and music services and applications than playing multiplayer games. This rapid type of industry convergence has caused the distinction between video game console and personal computers to disappear. A game console with high-speed microprocessors attached to a television set is, for all intents and purposes, a computer and monitor.

As this distinction has been diminished, players&#x27; willingness to play and access content on different platforms has increased. The growing video gamer demographic accounts for this trend, as former president of the Entertainment Software Association Douglas Lowenstein explained at the 10th E3 expo, &quot;Looking ahead, a child born in 1995, E3&#x27;s inaugural year, will be 19 years old in 2014. And according to Census Bureau data, by the year 2020, there will be 174 million Americans between the ages of 5 and 44. That&#x27;s 174 million Americans who will have grown up with PlayStations, Xboxes, and GameCubes from their early childhood and teenage years...What this means is that the average gamer will be both older and, given their lifetime familiarity with playing interactive games, more sophisticated and discriminating about the games they play.&quot;

Evidence of the increasing player willingness to play video games across a variety of media and different platforms can be seen in the rise of casual gaming on smartphones, tablets, and social networking sites as 92% of all smartphone and tablet owners play games at least once a week, 45% play daily, and industry estimates predict that, by 2016, one-third of all global mobile video game revenue will come from tablets alone. Apple&#x27;s App Store alone has more than 90,000 game apps, a growth of 1,400% since it went online. In addition, game revenues for iOS and Android mobile devices now exceed those of both Nintendo and Sony handheld video game systems combined.

<text>Sankt Florian (also &quot;Florian&quot; or &quot;St. Florian&quot;) is a town in the Austrian state of Upper Austria. It is 10 miles (16 km) from Linz.

Sankt Florian is the home of St. Florian Monastery, a community of Canons Regular named after Saint Florian and one of the oldest operational monasteries in the world following the Rule of St. Augustine. Composer Anton Bruckner (1824–96), who was a choirboy and later organist in the town, is buried beneath the organ inside the monastic church, which was elevated to the rank of basilica minor in 1999.

== The St. Florianer Sängerknaben ==
The town is also known for its boys&#x27; choir (&quot;St. Florianer Sängerknaben&quot;), founded in 1071. The choir has been a traditional part of the monastery&#x27;s worship from its beginning and has contributed significantly to the identity of the town. It has particular responsibility for sacred music for the religious community, but also undertakes successful international concert tours and television appearances.

<doc id="372481" wikidata="Q665850" url="?curid=372481" title="John S. McCain Jr.">
<text>John Sidney McCain Jr. (January 17, 1911 – March 22, 1981) was a United States Navy admiral who served in conflicts from the 1940s through the 1970s, including as the Commander, United States Pacific Command.

The son and namesake of a naval officer, McCain grew up in Washington, D.C., and graduated from the U.S. Naval Academy in 1931, after which he entered the submarine service. During World War II, he commanded submarines in several theaters of operation and was responsible for sinking several Japanese ships, eventually being decorated with both the Silver Star and Bronze Star. After the war, he held a variety of commands, specializing in amphibious warfare. He led the U.S. invasion of the Dominican Republic in 1965. He also served in several posts in Washington, including the Legislative Affairs Office and as Chief of Naval Information, where he became influential in political affairs. He was a staunch anti-Communist, and his advocacy of a strong naval presence earned him the nickname of &quot;Mr. Seapower&quot;.

During the Vietnam War, McCain was Commander-in-Chief, Pacific Command (CINCPAC), commanding all U.S. forces in the Vietnam theater from 1968 to 1972. He was a stalwart supporter of President Richard Nixon&#x27;s policy of Vietnamization. McCain played a significant role in the militarization of U.S. policy towards Cambodia, helping to convince Nixon to launch the 1970 Cambodian Incursion and establishing a personal relationship with Cambodian leader Lon Nol. McCain was also a proponent of the 1971 incursion into Laos. He retired from the Navy in 1972.

His father, Admiral John S. McCain Sr., was a naval aviator and Task Force commander during World War II. They were the first father-son pair to achieve a four-star rank. His son, John S. McCain III, was also a naval aviator who was a prisoner of war in North Vietnam during McCain&#x27;s time as CINCPAC, and later became a United States Senator and presidential candidate.

==Early years, education, and family==
McCain was born in Council Bluffs, Iowa, on January 17, 1911. His father, John S. McCain Sr., was a junior officer on the armored cruiser and was away at sea at the time and his mother, the former Catherine Davey Vaulx, was traveling cross-country to visit with her sister. He was called &quot;Jack&quot; by his family, although he would also be called &quot;Junior&quot; by others, which he liked less. His family&#x27;s history of military service extended beyond his father—his paternal uncle was U.S. Army Brigadier General William Alexander McCain. His family tree also contained other people engaged in military service, which extended back through many wars.

McCain grew up at various naval stations where his father was posted and then in Northwest, Washington, D.C., going to local schools and working as a paperboy. His father was away on duty for much of his childhood, and his mother did much of the parenting. He graduated from Central High School in the district.

McCain entered the United States Naval Academy in 1927, aged 16. He disliked the hazing tradition and behavioral restrictions of Annapolis and accumulated many and earned mediocre grades during his years at the Academy. As one biographer wrote, McCain &quot;was given to taking unauthorized midnight leave and spent much of his four ... years in contention with authority and working off massive doses of extra duty.&quot; McCain later stated: &quot;I was known as a &#x27;ratey&#x27; plebe, and that&#x27;s the plebe who does not conform always to the specific rules and regulations of the upperclassmen. Some of these upperclassmen would ... require you to do such things which only incited rebellion and mutiny in me, see.&quot; At one point, McCain had so many demerits he was at risk of not graduating; his partying and drinking was especially dangerous as it was taking place during Prohibition. During much of his final year there he was banished from Bancroft Hall, the normal residence for midshipmen, and forced instead to live on the barracks ship . He graduated in 1931, finishing 423rd out of 441 in class rank, nineteenth from the bottom.

Upon graduation, he was commissioned an ensign and assigned to duty aboard the battleship in the Pacific. He applied to flight school to become a naval aviator, but was turned down due to a heart murmur, and was accepted at Submarine School at Naval Submarine Base New London in Connecticut instead. There, he placed 28th out of 29 in his class.

While stationed on &quot;Oklahoma&quot; in Long Beach, California, McCain met Roberta Wright, a freshman at the University of Southern California whose father was a successful wildcatter. After Roberta&#x27;s mother objected to her daughter associating with a sailor, the couple eloped to Tijuana, Baja California, Mexico, marrying in Caesar&#x27;s Bar on January 21, 1933. McCain was suspended five days for leaving ship without permission. The couple would have three children: Jean Alexandra &quot;Sandy&quot; McCain (1934−2019, born at Coco Solo Naval Air Station in the Panama Canal Zone); John Sidney McCain III (1936−2018, also born at Coco Solo Naval Air Station); and Joseph Pinckney McCain II (born 1942 at Naval Submarine Base New London).

The family was frequently uprooted as they followed McCain from New London to Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, and other stations in the Pacific Ocean; Roberta took on the lead role in raising the children. In 1934, McCain was praised for loyalty and for performing his duties very well, but his fitness report said he suffered from nervousness, and he was treated for weight loss at Pearl Harbor Naval Hospital. He served in the old, World War I-era submarines and . From 1938 to 1940, he returned to the Naval Academy for a stint of teaching electrical engineering to midshipmen. He later said of this position, &quot;The lads learned soon enough never to try to hoodwink an old hoodwinker.&quot; In 1940 and early 1941, he sailed in the more modern submarine (SS-184) as part of the Pacific Fleet&#x27;s SubDiv 15. In April 1941, McCain was detached to his first command, the antique (SS-69), recommissioned as a training boat at the Submarine School in New London.

==World War II==
After the 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor, McCain would not see his family for long stretches. By then a lieutenant commander, McCain was assigned to command the submarine , joining her in May 1942 for trials and seeing the boat commissioned in August 1942.

&quot;Gunnel&quot; was deployed as part of the November 1942 invasion of French North Africa. Operating conditions for the five submarines sent there were not favorable, due to overcrowded waters, poor weather, and mixed-up signals, and the deployment had no accomplishments. Like many other U.S. submarines, &quot;Gunnel&quot; was attacked in error by friendly aircraft. The Hooven-Owens-Rentschler (H.O.R.) diesels (known as &quot;whores&quot;) which powered &quot;Gunnel&quot; were troublesome; at one point while returning home, drive gears of all four of the main engines were out of commission, and McCain&#x27;s crew had to rely on their tiny auxiliary engine for the last . &quot;Gunnel&quot; went into the navy yard for an extensive refit and was replaced on patrol station off North Africa by &quot;Pilly&quot; Lent&#x27;s .

After the refit, &quot;Gunnel&quot; was ordered to the Pacific Fleet, and in June 1943, went on patrol in the East China and Yellow Seas. On June 15, McCain torpedoed and sank the freighter &quot;Koyo Maru&quot; (6400 tons) in the Tsushima Strait. Early on June 19, he engaged a Japanese convoy that was headed for Shanghai. He torpedoed and sank the freighter &quot;Tokiwa Maru&quot; (7000 tons) and hit a smaller vessel. The convoy&#x27;s escorts then staged a prolonged counter-attack on &quot;Gunnel&quot;, dropping depth charges that shook and damaged the boat and grappling hooks that rattled along its hull.

Underwater for hours, sometimes near the seabottom, McCain surfaced; Japanese escorts fired shells at him as he stood on the bridge, while he fired torpedoes back, striking and sinking one (originally thought to be a destroyer, it was the coastal minesweeper &quot;Tsubame&quot;). He dove again and the Japanese ships continued in sonar-based pursuit. After a total of 36 hours, nearly all spent underwater, &quot;Gunnel&quot;″s batteries were about to fail and the air was very hot and virtually unbreathable. McCain surfaced in battle stations position, ready to engage in a disadvantageous gun battle with the Japanese pursuers, but they were heading in the opposite direction and he was able to escape.

Persistent trouble from the submarine&#x27;s diesel engines then cut short the patrol after only eleven days, after which McCain returned to Pearl Harbor. Despite the reduced time, the freighter tonnage &quot;Gunnel&quot; sunk was the second-largest total for any of the sixteen U.S. submarines deployed into operational areas in the Pacific that month.

McCain was awarded the Silver Star for this patrol, for &quot;conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity in action, as Commanding Officer of a submarine in enemy Japanese-controlled waters ... [and] bravery under fire and aggressive fighting spirit.&quot; McCain&#x27;s personality was a good fit for wartime submarine duty. Many of the U.S. submarine commanders trained in peacetime had focused excessively on conformance to regulations and adherence to official tactical doctrine; they lacked the aggressiveness and ability to improvise that the conflict in the Pacific demanded, and by the end of the first year of the war, almost a third of them had been relieved as inadequate.

&quot;Gunnel&quot; was the first Pearl Harbor boat to have her H.O.R. diesels replaced, and she returned to action off Iwo Jima in December 1943. Alerted by Station HYPO intelligence to the presence of aircraft carriers, on the night of December 2–3, McCain fired four torpedoes at Japanese carrier at a very long range of , only to miss as &quot;Zuihō&quot; zigged. Although he did not hit it, McCain was one of only a handful of U.S. submarine commanders to actually attack an enemy carrier. &quot;Gunnel&quot; did sink one ship of 4000 tons during this patrol.
On March 18, 1944, on patrol off Tawi Tawi, the main Japanese fleet anchorage in the Philippines, McCain got another shot at a carrier. He fired from extremely long range , missed the target, and sustained a counterattack of sixteen depth charges. He tried to attack the same carrier over the next four days, but could place his boat no closer than .

During the May 1944 joint American and British Operation Transom air strike on Surabaya, &quot;Gunnel&quot; lay off Tawi Tawi in company with Robert I. Olsen&#x27;s , but McCain managed no attacks on Japanese ships. He shifted his operations to the coast of Indochina, where, on June 8, he picked up a convoy, escorted by yet another aircraft carrier. He was unable to approach closer than . In July 1944, he was detached for a brief return to New London.

On his return to Pearl Harbor, the Navy ordered him to command the new starting October 1944, with commissioning two months later. Now a commander, during his one patrol with that submarine he damaged a large freighter and sank two guard boat-style patrol craft in the East China Sea and the Taiwan Straits. For this action, McCain was awarded the Bronze Star Medal with Combat V.

At the conclusion of the war, McCain sailed &quot;Dentuda&quot; into Tokyo Bay and had one last meeting with his father, who had been commanding the Fast Carrier Task Force during the latter stages of the war. Slew McCain died four days after the Japanese surrender ceremony in Tokyo Bay.

In addition to his Silver and Bronze Stars, McCain&#x27;s actions in the war earned him two letters of commendation. A superior wrote that: &quot;His zeal in the investigation and development of new submarine tactics and weapons has been outstanding.&quot;

==&quot;Mr. Seapower&quot;==
After the end of the war, McCain remained in the Navy and his family settled in Northern Virginia. He was assigned as Director of Records to the Bureau of Naval Personnel until early 1949. McCain published a January 1949 article in United States Naval Institute &quot;Proceedings&quot; examining the training challenges the Navy faced in the nuclear era. He assumed command of Submarine Division 71 in the Pacific that year, with his flag in , which took him to a variety of naval stations and two exploratory cruises to extreme northern waters, adding to the knowledge of an increasingly important strategic area for submarine operations.

From February through November 1950, McCain was executive officer of the heavy cruiser , and from June 1950 was involved in the early stages of the Korean War, joining Task Force 77 to patrol the Formosa Strait.

Now a captain, McCain was assigned to a series of posts at the Pentagon in alternation with various commands. He was director of Undersea Warfare Research and Development from 1950 to 1953, commander of Submarine Squadron 6 aboard flagship in the Atlantic from 1953 to 1954, commander of the attack transport from 1954 to 1955 in the Mediterranean, Director of the Progress Analysis Group from 1955 to 1957, and commander of the heavy cruiser from 1957 to 1958. During these years, McCain went to the Naval Academy a number of times to admonish his son John on his performance there, which was at least as troublesome as his own had been. As one biographical profile stated, &quot;Few fathers and sons could have been more alike as adolescents than Jack McCain and John Sidney III: Youthful rebellion seemed encoded in their DNA.&quot;

McCain was promoted to rear admiral in November 1958. From 1958 to 1960, he was assigned to the Office of the Secretary of the Navy, where he joined the Legislative Affairs Office as Chief Legislative Liaison. There he formed many useful political connections, as senators, representatives, admirals, and generals were all frequent social visitors to his centrally-located D.C. house, which would later become the Capitol Hill Club. McCain was also a member of the Cosmos Club, Army and Navy Club, and the Chevy Chase Club, all in the D.C. area, and was a 33rd degree mason. His wife Roberta, viewed as &quot;charming&quot; and &quot;wonderful&quot; by McCain&#x27;s superiors, also aided the social success, which featured as house guests powerful Congressional figures such as Carl Vinson, Richard Russell Jr., and Everett Dirksen. (His son John would witness some of these and earlier interactions and two decades later assume the same role, on way to the start of his political career.) During this stint, Rear Admiral McCain became an effective advocate for the Navy in congressional hearings and behind-the-scenes dealmaking, and helped persuade Congress to restore budget allocations it had earlier cut from construction programs for aircraft carriers.
From 1960 to 1962, McCain held commands in the Atlantic, including Amphibious Group 2 and Amphibious Training, and served on and . He was Chief of Naval Information from 1962 to 1963, initiating the post and garnering influence with the Washington press that would aid his career. Following the April 1963 loss of the nuclear submarine , he explained to the public why the search for the wreckage would be lengthy and difficult, and defended the Navy against charges that it had been tardy in disclosing details of the disaster. McCain was promoted to vice admiral in July 1963, and was made commander of the entire Amphibious Forces, Atlantic Fleet (COMPHIBLANT). He came up with the idea for Operation Sea Orbit, the voyage around the world without refuelling of three nuclear-powered Navy ships; it was reminiscent of the Great White Fleet circumnavigation that his father had been part of over half a century earlier. Later in 1964, McCain commanded the Operation Steel Pike exercise off the coast of Spain, which was the largest amphibious landing ever in peacetime; he was awarded by a gold star in lieu of a Legion of Merit for this operation. After the operation he defended the performance of the United States Merchant Marine before the House Committee on Merchant Marine and Fisheries, and became a prominent public advocate for the geostrategic importance of the merchant marine.

In 1964 McCain was elected as an hereditary member of the Virginia Society of the Cincinnati by right of his descent from his great(4) grandfather Captain John Young who served with the Virginia State Troops during the American Revolution.

In April 1965, McCain led the United States invasion of the Dominican Republic as commander of Task Force 124, which maintained a military occupation until civil unrest had ended. McCain later said, &quot;Some people condemned this as an &#x27;unwarranted intervention,&#x27; but the Communists were all set to move in and take over. People may not love you for being strong when you have to be, but they respect you for it and learn to behave themselves when you are.&quot; He also worked closely with U.S. Ambassador to the Organization of American States Ellsworth Bunker, who was handling negotiations between local factions. For this operation, McCain was awarded the Legion of Merit.

McCain then served three roles simultaneously: vice chairman of delegation to the United Nations Military Staff Committee, Commander Eastern Sea Frontier, and Commander Atlantic Reserve Fleet. The U.N. post was considered to be a career dead-end, but McCain looked to his political contacts to keep his career going.

Throughout much of his career, McCain was known for his short and thin stature, salty character, and trademark cigar. One superior wrote that: &quot;There is only one Jack McCain! Vice Admiral McCain, by his enthusiasm, honesty and delightful personality makes many friends, not only officially but socially... The &#x27;little man with the big cigar&#x27; is known to everyone.&quot; McCain liked to confer with enlisted men and get their opinions. He swore so much he earned the sobriquet &quot;Good Goddamn McCain&quot;; his regular greeting to begin the day was &quot;Good goddamn morning.&quot; He was often asked how he told his wife Roberta and her identical twin sister Rowena apart, to which he famously responded by puffing his cigar, flashing a grin, and saying, &quot;That&#x27;s their problem.&quot; He jumped rope 200 times a day as part of keeping fit. He developed a problem with alcoholism during his career, and cut back on his drinking so that it did not interfere with his ability to command or show up on fitness reports, although he occasionally suffered lapses.

McCain was a staunch promoter of the importance of a strong naval presence, and indeed became known in military-congressional circles, sometimes not approvingly, as &quot;Mr. Seapower&quot;. He gave regular speeches on the subject with an increasing fervor, and worked with his large number of political contacts in what some saw as an effort to get a final promotion. During the Cold War, McCain stressed the importance of maintaining naval superiority over the Soviet Union. He was especially concerned in light of the growing number of submarines deployed by the Soviet Navy, calling them &quot;a direct threat to our free use of the oceans of the world.&quot; During a long U.S. policy debate regarding the merchant marine force, he continued to stress the importance of that fleet, giving an illustrated talk entitled &quot;Total Wet War&quot; that said the Soviets would soon overtake the fleet in numbers and concluding that &quot;our free use of the seas will play an ever increasing role in the world situation of the future.&quot;

Beginning in 1965, Senate Minority Leader Dirksen had been championing McCain&#x27;s case for four-star admiral promotion to President Lyndon Johnson. McCain had both supporters and detractors within the Navy, but the top commanders had sidetracked him with the U.N. appointment, and U.S. Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara had been given the impression that McCain was not a strong commander. Johnson was in debt to Dirksen for having broken the filibuster of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and so in 1966, Johnson requested that McNamara find a four-star path for McCain.

==Vietnam War==
In February 1967, McCain received his sought-after promotion to full admiral (which became effective in May), and became Commander-in-Chief, U.S. Naval Forces, Europe (CINCUSNAVEUR), stationed in London. At the change of command ceremony for the Eastern Sea Frontier post, held on his father&#x27;s old flagship , McCain was awarded a gold star in lieu of a third Legion of Merit for his work during the U.N. assignment. As the Vietnam War escalated, McCain was a strong advocate for bringing s out of the United States Navy reserve fleets in order to support shore bombardment missions. He ordered a Naval Court of Inquiry to be convened following the June 1967 USS &quot;Liberty&quot; incident, and chose his colleague, Admiral Isaac C. Kidd Jr., to head it. McCain limited the scope of the Inquiry and gave Kidd only a week to investigate and come up with a report on the matter, factors that led to doubts persisting for decades about what actually took place in the &quot;Liberty&quot; attack.

McCain&#x27;s son, naval aviator Lieutenant Commander John S. McCain III, became a prisoner of war in North Vietnam in October 1967, after being shot down and badly injured during a bombing raid over Hanoi. McCain&#x27;s prominence made the downing of his son front-page news. McCain and his wife Roberta treated the news stoically, attending a dinner party in London without indicating anything was wrong, even though initial word indicated their son was unlikely to have survived the shoot-down. McCain would later say little about his son&#x27;s captivity in public, other than that they had indications he was alive and &quot;that is something to live for.&quot;
McCain continued to expand on his vision of the Soviet threat, saying that the Soviets&#x27; maritime goal &quot;encompasses not only the military uses of the sea, but also those relating to world politics, economics, commerce and technology&quot;, and likened its propaganda value to the Space Race. In April 1968, at the height of the Vietnam War, McCain was named by President Johnson as Commander-in-Chief, Pacific Command (CINCPAC), effective in July 1968, stationed in Honolulu and commander of all U.S. forces in the Vietnam theater. In an unprecedented move, Johnson had considered candidates from outside the Navy, including U.S. Army General William Westmoreland, who was leaving as commander of Military Assistance Command, Vietnam (MACV). However, the strong recommendation of Ellsworth Bunker, who had since become U.S. Ambassador to South Vietnam, was key in Johnson&#x27;s decision. At the change-of-command ceremony for the Europe post, McCain was awarded the Navy Distinguished Service Medal.

McCain was a strong believer in the domino theory, and as CINCPAC, emphasized what he saw as the grave threat of Communist Chinese expansion of influence. He became well known within the Pentagon and to the press for his fervent briefings on the &quot;Chicom&quot; menace, showing maps with bright-red claws or arrows extending from a bright-red China into much of the area he was responsible for. To some, McCain was the Navy&#x27;s most persuasive and energetic briefer, while to others, he was over-the-top and spoke longer than necessary. McCain believed the Pacific Command&#x27;s role was both to confront the major Communist powers with superior and mobile force, and to provide a deterrent force to protect smaller countries from &quot;aggression, whether this be overtly military or by subversion and infiltration.&quot;

When the Nixon Administration took office in January 1969, the secret National Security Study Memorandum 1 collected views of top officials on the prospects for President Richard Nixon&#x27;s policy of Vietnamization. There was a division of thought among those contributing, but McCain was one of those who were relatively optimistic, believing the North Vietnamese had entered peace talks due to military weakness, South Vietnamese pacification progress was real, and the tide of the war was favorably turning. McCain suffered a mild stroke around this time, but was back at work a month later. Following an inspection tour of South Vietnam in December 1969, McCain remained very optimistic about the course of the war and the ability of South Vietnamese forces to carry greater burdens. McCain did not give much credence to the anti-Vietnam War movement; in reaction to the popular slogan &quot;Make love, not war&quot;, he told a 1970 Naval Academy class that they were part of a fraternity &quot;whose members are men enough to do both.&quot;

McCain played an important part in the expansion of U.S. involvement in Cambodia. In April 1970, McCain gave personal briefings to Nixon in Honolulu, and to Nixon and National Security Advisor Henry Kissinger in San Clemente, where he highlighted the threat from North Vietnamese operations in Cambodia and Laos. In particular, he said that Lon Nol&#x27;s government in Cambodia would soon collapse unless North Vietnamese operations there were stopped, and that with a secure base there, North Vietnam could then launch attacks on South Vietnam which would cause the failure of Vietnamization. McCain additionally said that the schedule for the ongoing withdrawal of U.S. ground forces from Vietnam had to be flexible. McCain&#x27;s views, which had the support of his subordinate, MACV commander General Creighton Abrams, helped persuade Nixon to go ahead with the Cambodian Incursion later that month. Kissinger subsequently told another admiral, &quot;We have to be careful about having McCain around the president too much, because he fires up the president.&quot;
By late 1970, McCain worried that Kissinger&#x27;s plan for extensive commitment of South Vietnamese troops to preserve the Cambodian regime would endanger the progress of Vietnamization. Nevertheless, McCain was involved in the intense U.S. effort to prop up Cambodian leader Lon Nol, paying visits to Phnom Penh to give him assurances and assess the state of the Cambodians. When Lon Nol suffered a stroke in early 1971, he recuperated at McCain&#x27;s guesthouse in Honolulu. At the same time, a Military Equipment Delivery Team program was organized to supply military assistance to the Cambodian government. McCain gained control of this effort (instead of Military Assistance Command, Vietnam), and to support a conflict that he proprietarily spoke of as &quot;my war&quot;, made constant requests to the Pentagon for more arms and staff. He forced an Americanization of many logistics procedures within the Cambodian military. He sided with Kissinger and the Joint Chiefs of Staff as they prevailed over the U.S. Embassy in Cambodia and U.S. Defense Secretary Melvin Laird in adopting a militarization of American policy with regard to that country. Lon Nol&#x27;s gratitude towards McCain continued, including the gift of an elephant (soon named &quot;Cincpachyderm&quot;) too large to transport on McCain&#x27;s DC-6.

McCain was also very concerned about the North Vietnamese presence in Laos. He was a proponent of Operation Lam Son 719, the February–March 1971 U.S.-assisted incursion into southeastern Laos by the South Vietnamese Army. He told Admiral Thomas Moorer, chairman of the Joint Chiefs, that an offensive against the Ho Chi Minh Trail might compel Prince Souvanna Phouma, prime minister of Laos, &quot;to abandon the guise of neutrality and enter the war openly.&quot; The operation ended in failure.

Each year while Jack McCain was CINCPAC, he paid a Christmastime visit to the American troops in South Vietnam serving closest to the DMZ; he would stand alone and look north, to be as close to his son as he could get. During Operation Linebacker, the resumed bombing of the north starting in April 1972, the targets included the Hanoi area. The daily orders were issued by McCain, knowing his imprisoned son was in the vicinity.

In March 1972, the Nixon administration announced Admiral Noel Gayler as McCain&#x27;s successor as CINCPAC, despite McCain&#x27;s unheeded request to Nixon to have his tour extended so that he could see the war to its conclusion. McCain&#x27;s time as CINCPAC ended on September 1, 1972; at the transfer of command ceremony in Honolulu that day, Nixon focused on the contributions of the three generations of McCains – saying, &quot;In the story of the McCains we see the greatness of America&quot; – and awarded McCain a gold star in lieu of his second Navy Distinguished Service Medal. For the next two months, McCain served as special assistant to Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Elmo R. Zumwalt Jr. Kissinger would later characterize McCain&#x27;s approach to the Vietnam War by saying, &quot;He fought for the victory that his instinct and upbringing demanded and that political reality forbade.&quot;

==Retirement and death==
McCain retired on November 1, 1972. There was no ceremony, as it would have been redundant after the one that took place two months earlier in Hawaii; as one associate said, &quot;He just didn&#x27;t come to work today.&quot;

In early 1973, with the conclusion of the Paris Peace Accords, his son was released from confinement as a prisoner of war in North Vietnam and repatriated to the United States.

McCain visited the White House in 1975 and discussed naval preparedness issues with President Gerald Ford. During the late 1970s, McCain sometimes acted as an advisor on military matters to Ronald Reagan, who was preparing for his second presidential candidacy. McCain also participated in a January 1978 traveling &quot;Panama Canal Truth Squad&quot;, led by Senator Paul Laxalt, that sought Senate rejection of the Panama Canal Treaty; McCain felt that the eventual ceding of the canal to Panamanian control would endanger U.S. security and provide an opening to the Soviets in the region.

However, McCain felt despair over his reluctant retirement from the United States Navy, and fell into prolonged poor health. His son John felt his father&#x27;s &quot;long years of binge drinking&quot; had caught up with him, despite a mostly successful later recovery in Alcoholics Anonymous.

McCain died of a heart attack on a military aircraft en route from Europe on March 22, 1981, with his wife at his side. He was buried at Arlington National Cemetery on March 27, 1981.

==Namesakes==
 was named for both Admirals McCain. The Navy rededicated the ship to also honor Senator John S. McCain III in 2018.

McCain was written about extensively in his son John&#x27;s 1999 memoir &quot;Faith of My Fathers&quot;. McCain was portrayed by actor Scott Glenn in the 2005 television movie adaptation.

Grandson John S. &quot;Jack&quot; McCain IV attended and graduated from the United States Naval Academy in 2009, the fourth-generation John S. McCain to do so. He became a naval aviator, like his father and great-grandfather, including flying helicopters during the War in Afghanistan. John S. McCain IV has a son John S. &quot;Mac&quot; McCain V.

==Awards==
By the end of his career, Admiral John S. McCain Jr. had received the following medals and decorations:

<text>Sir Frederic Charles Bartlett FRS (20 October 1886 – 30 September 1969) was a British psychologist and the first professor of experimental psychology at the University of Cambridge. He was one of the forerunners of cognitive psychology as well as cultural psychology. Bartlett considered most of his own work on cognitive psychology to be a study in social psychology, but he was also interested in anthropology, moral science, philosophy, and sociology. Bartlett proudly referred to himself as &quot;a Cambridge psychologist&quot; because while he was at the University of Cambridge, settling for one type of psychology was not an option.

==Biography==

Frederic Bartlett was born on 20 October 1886 into a middle-class family and raised in Gloucestershire, England. He suffered from pleurisy at a young age, causing him to be homeschooled during his secondary years of education. Despite this, he partook in sports such as golf, tennis, and cricket.

In 1909, Bartlett graduated First Class Honours with a Bachelor of Arts degree in philosophy at The University Correspondence College. He continued his education at London University where he achieved his master&#x27;s degree with a distinction in both ethics and sociology. Continuing his education at St John&#x27;s College, Cambridge, Barlett received a distinction in moral science. Here, he also met Charles Samuel Myers, the Director of the Cambridge Psychology Laboratory. The effects of Bartlett&#x27;s childhood illnesses kept him from participating in World War I. He became deputy head of the Cambridge Psychology Laboratory in 1914 when Myers was drafted into the war as a medical doctor.

Bartlett&#x27;s experimental work at this time focused on perception and imaging which contributed to his appointment as a Fellow in 1917. Soon after the war ended, Myers left his Cambridge position, leaving a large donation to finance department lectureships. Bartlett became the Director of the Laboratory and Lecturer of Experimental Psychology. Bartlett later attained the title of Senior Lecturer of Psychology, a post which he held until his death in 1969 at the age of 82.

==&quot;Psychology and Primitive Culture&quot; (1923)==

Bartlett&#x27;s first book in psychology developed a framework to understand human action in cultural context. In contrast to his most famous experimental work (see below) he here develops his argument through his readings of ethnographic sources. In fact, Bartlett had originally wanted to go into anthropology but was encouraged by his mentor W.H.R. Rivers to train as a psychologist first. In Psychology and Primitive Culture, he explores in particular what happens when groups come into contact with each other and what factors condition the exchange and adoption of culture between the groups. The book is also noteworthy in its argument against Lucien Lévy-Bruhl&#x27;s notion of the &#x27;primitive mind&#x27;.

==&quot;Remembering&quot; (1932)==

Bartlett was the Chair of Experimental Psychology at Cambridge when he published the book he is most famously recognised for: &quot;Remembering&quot; (1932). The book explored Bartlett&#x27;s concept of conventionalization in psychology. It was an assemblage of his past works, including experiments testing the ability to remember using figures, photographs, and stories. Specifically, &quot;Remembering&quot; consisted of experimental studies on remembering, imaging, and perceiving, and &quot;remembering as a study in social psychology.&quot; His Theory of Remembering involved social conditions that were influential to remembering, along with comparisons such as &quot;free remembering&quot; to special circumstances of remembering. The book provided an in depth analysis of Bartlett&#x27;s schema theory, which has continued to inspire scientists studying schema theories today.

Bartlett is also credited for the transmission chain method. Studies based on the method are described in the book. 

===&quot;War of the Ghosts&quot;===

The &quot;War of the Ghosts&quot; experiment from &quot;Remembering&quot; (1932) was Bartlett&#x27;s most famous study and demonstrated the reconstructive nature of memory, and how it can be influenced by the subject&#x27;s own schema. A memory is constructive when a person gives their opinion about what had happened in the memory, along with additional influences such as their experiences, knowledge, and expectations.

In the experiment, Bartlett assigned his Edwardian English participants to read the Native American Folklore titled &quot;War of the Ghosts&quot;. Participants were told to remember the story at extended intervals numerous times. Bartlett found that at longer intervals between reading the story and remembering it, participants were less accurate and forgot much of the information from the story. Most importantly, where the elements of the story failed to fit into the schemata of the listener, these elements were omitted from the recollection, or transformed into more familiar forms. Each participant&#x27;s report of the story mirrored his or her own culture, Edwardian English culture in this case. An example of this can be demonstrated by some of these participants remembering &quot;canoes&quot; from the story as &quot;boats&quot;.

==Applied experimental psychology and war efforts==

After the publication of &quot;Remembering&quot; (1932), Bartlett&#x27;s concerns centred on determining stronger methodologies for social psychology by combining psychology and anthropology. Bartlett, along with colleagues from subjects of psychology, anthropology, and sociology, met twice a year from 1935 to 1938 to collaborate. Bartlett&#x27;s interest in Applied Experimental Psychology expanded, specifically in regard to the subject of the militia when the Applied Psychology Unit was established at the Cambridge Laboratory of Industrial Research. He and Kenneth Craik were responsible for setting up the Medical Research Council&#x27;s Applied Psychology Research Unit (APU) at Cambridge in 1944, where they worked with experimental psychologist Magdalen Dorothea Vernon. Together their applied research focused on issues directed from government agencies, including training and experimental designs. Bartlett became the Director of the Unit after Craik&#x27;s early death in 1945. Bartlett successfully took charge of this lectureship aimed towards military efforts. Expanding upon Craik&#x27;s past work on &quot;bodily skills&quot; appealed to Bartlett possibly because of his passion for sports during his childhood years. At this time, institutions in England and the United States bestowed numerous awards to Bartlett for his explanations of the adaptive synthesis of movements that humans create given any new situation.

==&quot;Thinking&quot; (1958)==

In 1958, Bartlett published &quot;Thinking: An Experimental and Social Study&quot;. He recognised various thinking processes that humans use, relating back to the methods he exercised in &quot;Remembering&quot; (1932) such as story recollection. Experiments on completion were done, where participants were shown open ended stories and told to finish them realistically. What he found was that &quot;completion appears even unconsciously, and sheds light on how schemas, as a way of organizing past experiences, lead one towards constructive and predictive processes&quot;.

==Honours==

In 1922, Bartlett was chosen as Director of Psychological Laboratory in Cambridge and awarded a chair in experimental psychology in 1931. The same year he published &quot;Remembering&quot; (1932), Bartlett became a Fellow of the Royal Society. In 1944, Bartlett became the Director of the Unit for Research in Applied Psychology. Bartlett&#x27;s contributions during World War II granted him C.B.E in 1941 and awarded him medals from The Royal Society in 1943. He was elected to the American Philosophical Society in 1945 and the United States National Academy of Sciences in 1947. He was appointed &quot;honoris causa&quot; by the University of Athens in 1937, Princeton in 1947, and the University of London and the University of Louvain in 1949. In 1948, Bartlett delivered the Royal Institution Christmas Lectures on &quot;The Mind at Work and Play&quot;. This also marked the year Bartlett was knighted for services to the Royal Air Force, on the basis of his wartime work in applied psychology. In 1950, Bartlett was awarded Presidency at the British Psychological Society. He was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1958.

After his retirement in 1951, Bartlett continued receiving &quot;honoris causa&quot; from various universities. In 1952, he was awarded the Royal Medal and the Longacre Award of the Aeromedical Association. Between 1952 and 1963, National Psychological Societies of Spain, Sweden, Italy, Turkey, and Switzerland elected him as an honorary member. He was recognised by the International Experimental Psychology Society in 1958 and was selected by The North American National Academy of Science and the North American Academy of Arts to be a foreign associate member in 1959. Today, the UK Ergonomics Society awards a Bartlett medal in his honour, and the Experimental Psychology Society holds an annual Bartlett Lecture.

<text>Enid Strict, better known as The Church Lady, is a fictional character portrayed by Dana Carvey on American sketch comedy television show &quot;Saturday Night Live.&quot; The character appeared on the show from 1986 to 1990, and again in 1996, 2000, 2011, 2016, and 2024. She also appeared on &quot;The Dana Carvey Show&quot; in March 1996, reading a Top Ten List, &quot;New Titles for Princess Diana.&quot;

==Development==
Dana Carvey developed the character in his stand-up comedy act prior to joining &quot;SNL.&quot; He said, &quot;At one point it was a schoolteacher being very condescending to kids as they made sailboats.&quot; Carvey decided to make the character a religious figure when his mother said his impersonation reminded her of women from their churchgoing days who would keep track of people&#x27;s attendance. &quot;Mom would bring a casserole to potluck dinners, and then feel inferior. I remember walking into church after our family had missed a few Sundays, and their turns of the heads, that &#x27;Well! Good to see they finally made it!&#x27; attitude.&quot; 

Writer Rosie Shuster helped Carvey develop the concept of the &quot;Church Chat&quot; talk show. Carvey recalled that he was prompted by executive producer Lorne Michaels to introduce the character (when it was still in &quot;SNL&quot; rehearsals) at a Neil Young concert at Madison Square Garden, which Church Lady interrupted, fussing and fuming: &quot;What are we &quot;doing&quot; here? What&#x27;s all this noise?&quot;

The Church Lady made numerous appearances on &quot;SNL&quot;, and Nora Dunn recalled that &quot;everybody loved that character.&quot;

== Character ==
The Church Lady is a mature woman named Enid Strict who is the uptight, smug, and pious host of her talk show &quot;Church Chat.&quot; Her show includes guests, usually celebrities whom she interviews, played by other cast members of &quot;SNL&quot; or by the celebrities themselves. However, the interviews are only a guise for her to call out the guests on their various alleged sins, which are often publicly known news events of the day. They initially receive sarcastic praise from her, until the interview degrades into a tirade against their apparent lack of piety and their secular lifestyles, culminating with her judgmental admonishments and condemnation. She often takes others to task for following the desires of their &quot;tingling&quot; and/or &quot;engorged&quot; &quot;naughty parts.&quot;

Sometimes the Church Lady was accompanied by a character known as &quot;Minister Bob,&quot; played by Chevy Chase. He seemed to be the only person the Church Lady admired. During a church picnic an inebriated woman interrupted the gathering, shocking all the old ladies present, and saying how the Church Lady acts so high and mighty but is out of touch with the problems of people in everyday life. Minister Bob then acts more down to Earth than the Church Lady, saying it is the responsibility of a pastor to deal with people with problems. When he seems to be leading the woman into why problem drinking is a bad idea, he ends with saying &quot;...because of SATAN!&quot;, and joins the Church Lady in her Superior Dance.

The Church Lady made her first appearance on the season premiere of season 12. It was not until the twelfth episode of that season, where Willie Nelson performs a duet of &quot;You Don&#x27;t Bring Me Flowers&quot; with the Church Lady, that the character became more popular. The Jim Bakker and Tammy Faye Bakker scandal was parodied multiple times in sketches and helped make the Church Lady one of &quot;SNL&quot;″s signature characters.

==Notable appearances==
== Appearances outside &quot;SNL&quot; ==
In a teaser trailer for the 1990 film &quot;Opportunity Knocks&quot; (available on that film&#x27;s DVD), the Church Lady interrupts, warning viewers not to see the film and is punched in the face and knocked to the floor by Dana Carvey who introduces himself. The Church Lady retaliates and the fight continues off-screen as the trailer ends.

The Church Lady appeared on ABC&#x27;s &quot;The Dana Carvey Show&quot; as part of a larger sketch where a viewer letter asked whether Dana Carvey&#x27;s &quot;SNL&quot; characters were to appear on the show. The sketch responded by claiming that ABC used Disney&#x27;s high-profile lawyers to engage NBC in a hostile takeover, gaining the rights to Carvey&#x27;s &quot;SNL&quot; characters, as well as some of the IPs of David Letterman&#x27;s show on CBS. It then cuts to the Church Lady reading David Letterman&#x27;s Top Ten List.

== Popular catchphrases ==
* &quot;Well, isn&#x27;t that &quot;special&quot;?&quot;
* &quot;How con-VEEN-ient!&quot;
* &quot;Now, &quot;who&quot; could it be? Could it be ...&quot;Satan&quot;?&quot; (during a Christmas-themed December broadcast, using a magnetic spelling board, she rearranged letters spelling &quot;Santa&quot; to instead spell &quot;Satan&quot;)
* &quot;We like ourselves, don&#x27;t we?&quot; (usually directed at a guest on her show)
* &quot;Ah yes, from the Chippewa word meaning drop your shorts, we don&#x27;t have much time.&quot; (usually directed towards a guest)
