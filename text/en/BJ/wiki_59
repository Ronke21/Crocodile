<text>Fred Wallace Haise Jr. ( ; born November 14, 1933) is an American former NASA astronaut, engineer, fighter pilot with the U.S. Marine Corps and U.S. Air Force, and a test pilot. He is one of 24 people known to have flown to the Moon, having flown as Lunar Module pilot on Apollo 13. He was slated to become the 6th person to walk on the Moon, but the Apollo 13 landing mission was aborted en route. 

Haise went on to fly five Space Shuttle Approach and Landing Tests in 1977, before retiring from NASA in 1979.

== Early life ==

Fred Wallace Haise, Jr. was born on November 14, 1933, and raised in Biloxi, Mississippi, to Fred Wallace Haise (1903–1960) and Lucille ( Blacksher) Haise (1913–2005). He has a younger sister who was born in 1941. After the attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, his father enlisted in the U.S. Navy at the age of 38, and the Haise family moved to Chicago. The family then moved to Key West, Florida, until his father&#x27;s ship, YMS-84, deployed to the South Pacific, when the family moved back to Biloxi. He graduated from Biloxi High School in 1950. He attended Perkinston Junior College with a scholarship for journalism, and played on the baseball team. He graduated in 1952, and joined the Naval Aviation Cadet Program. He went to ground school at NAS Pensacola, and then moved to NAS Whiting Field in 1952. He trained in the SNJ and F6F Hellcat, and completed his flight training in 1954. He served as a U.S. Marine Corps fighter pilot, with VMF-533, then VMF-114 on the F2H-4 Banshee and F9F-8 Cougar at MCAS Cherry Point, North Carolina, from March 1954 to September 1956. Haise also served as a tactics and all-weather flight instructor in the U.S. Navy Advanced Training Command at NAS Kingsville, Texas.

Haise has accumulated 9,300 hours flying time, including 6,200 hours in jets.

After his military service, Haise returned to school and graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree with honors in aeronautical engineering from the University of Oklahoma in 1959, concurrently serving for two years in the Oklahoma Air National Guard, as a fighter interceptor pilot with the 185th Fighter Interceptor Squadron, flying the F-86D. He then worked for the newly created National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), first as a research pilot at the Lewis Research Center near Cleveland. His Air National Guard unit was called up during the Berlin Crisis of 1961 and he served ten months as a fighter pilot in the United States Air Force. He was a tactical fighter pilot and chief of the 164th Standardization-Evaluation Flight of the 164th Tactical Fighter Squadron at Mansfield Lahm Air National Guard Base, Ohio, flying the F-84F.

Haise completed post-graduate courses at the U.S. Air Force Aerospace Research Pilot School (Class 64A) at Edwards Air Force Base, California in 1964, and attended the six-week Harvard Business School&#x27;s Advanced Management Program in 1972.

== NASA career ==
In 1966, Haise was one of 19 astronauts selected for NASA Astronaut Group 5. He had already worked with NASA for several years as a civilian research pilot. He was the first astronaut in his group to be assigned to a mission, serving as backup Lunar Module Pilot for both Apollo 8 and Apollo 11.

=== Apollo 13 ===


According to the rotation of crews during Apollo, Haise was originally assigned as Lunar Module Pilot for Apollo 14, but his crew was switched to Apollo 13 so that Alan Shepard could have more training time. He flew as Lunar Module Pilot on the aborted Apollo 13 lunar mission in 1970. Due to the distance between the Earth and Moon during the mission, Haise, Jim Lovell, and Jack Swigert hold the record for the farthest distance from the Earth ever traveled by human beings. Haise and Jack Swigert were the first people from Group 5 to fly in space. During this flight Haise developed a urinary tract infection and later kidney infections. These caused him to be in pain for most of the trip.

Haise was slated to become the 6th human to walk on the Moon during Apollo 13 behind Lovell, who was to be 5th. Alan Shepard and Edgar Mitchell eventually became the fifth and sixth, respectively, on Apollo 14, which completed Apollo 13&#x27;s mission to the Fra Mauro formation.

Haise later served as backup commander for Apollo 16. Though there was no formal selection, Haise was prospectively slated to command Apollo 19 with William R. Pogue as Command Module Pilot and Gerald P. Carr as Lunar Module Pilot. However, the mission was canceled in 1970 due to budget cuts.

=== Space Shuttle approach and landing tests ===
After completing his backup assignment on Apollo 16, Haise moved to the Space Shuttle program. In 1977, he participated in the program&#x27;s Approach and Landing Tests (ALT) at Edwards Air Force Base. Along with C. Gordon Fullerton as pilot, Haise as commander piloted the Space Shuttle &quot;Enterprise&quot; in free flight to three landings after being released from the Shuttle Carrier Aircraft. The tests verified the shuttle&#x27;s flight characteristics, an important step toward the success of the program.

Haise was assigned to command STS-2A, with Jack R. Lousma as pilot, the second Space Shuttle mission, which would have delivered the Teleoperator Retrieval System that would have boosted Skylab to a higher orbit, preserving it for future use. Delays in the Shuttle program development as well as an unexpected increase in Skylab&#x27;s orbital decay led to the mission being canceled. Skylab was destroyed upon entering the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere in July 1979, while the Space Shuttle did not launch until April 1981.

In June 1979, Haise left NASA to become a test pilot and executive with Grumman Aerospace Corporation, where he remained until retiring in 1996. He was the only one of the four astronauts who conducted the &quot;Enterprise&quot; landing tests not to fly in space on the Shuttle.

== Personal life ==
Haise has four children with his first wife Mary Griffin Grant, whom he married on June 4, 1954, and divorced on July 21, 1978. He married Frances Patt Price, on January 9, 1979. On February 7, 2022, Frances died.

On August 22, 1973, Haise was piloting a Convair BT-13 belonging to the Commemorative Air Force that had been converted to look like an Aichi D3A &quot;Val&quot; torpedo bomber for the 1970 film &quot;Tora! Tora! Tora!&quot;. While attempting a landing go around at Scholes Field in Galveston, Texas, an undetermined power plant failure led to a crash landing. Haise suffered second‐degree burns over 50 percent of his body in the post crash fire.

Haise published his autobiography, &quot;Never Panic Early&quot;, about his life and experiences in the Apollo program in 2022. 

== Organizations ==
Haise is a fellow of the American Astronautical Society (AAS) and the Society of Experimental Test Pilots (SETP); member, Tau Beta Pi, Sigma Gamma Tau, and Phi Theta Kappa; and honorary member, National WWII Glider Pilots Association.

== Awards and honors ==
Haise&#x27;s other awards include the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics (AIAA) Haley Astronautics Award for 1971; the American Astronautical Society Flight Achievement Awards for 1970 and 1977; the City of New York Gold Medal in 1970; the City of Houston Medal for Valor in 1970; the Jeff Davis Award (1970); the Mississippi Distinguished Civilian Service Medal (1970); the American Defense Ribbon; the SETP&#x27;s Ray E. Tenhoff Award for 1966; the A. B. Honts Trophy as the outstanding graduate of Class 64A from the Aerospace Research Pilot School in 1964; an honorary doctor of science degree from Western Michigan University (1970); the JSC Special Achievement Award (1978); the Soaring Society of America&#x27;s Certificate of Achievement Award (1978); the General Thomas D. White USAF Space Trophy for 1977; the SETP&#x27;s Iven C. Kincheloe Award (1978); and the Air Force Association&#x27;s David C. Schilling Award (1978).

He received the Presidential Medal of Freedom, NASA Distinguished Service Medal, and NASA Exceptional Service Medal.

He was inducted into the International Space Hall of Fame in 1983 and the Aerospace Walk of Honor in 1995. He was also one of 24 Apollo astronauts inducted into the U.S. Astronaut Hall of Fame on October 4, 1997.

On February 13, 2022, the City of Biloxi unveiled a statue of Haise in the parking lot of the historic Biloxi Lighthouse. Haise was present at the ceremony and had his handprints set in concrete at the statue&#x27;s base prior to its unveiling. The statue was created by Mississippi artist Mary Ott Tremel Davidson.

In September 2023, Haise was inducted into the National Aviation Hall of Fame in Dayton, Ohio.

== In popular culture ==
In the 1995 motion picture &quot;Apollo 13&quot;, Haise was played by Bill Paxton.

<doc id="366165" wikidata="Q269863" url="?curid=366165" title="Christabel Pankhurst">
<text>Dame Christabel Harriette Pankhurst (; 22 September 1880 – 13 February 1958) was a British suffragette born in Manchester, England. A co-founder of the Women&#x27;s Social and Political Union (WSPU), she directed its militant actions from exile in France from 1912 to 1913. In 1914, she supported the war against Germany. After the war, she moved to the United States, where she worked as an evangelist for the Second Adventist movement.

==Early life==
Christabel Pankhurst was the daughter of women&#x27;s suffrage movement leader Emmeline Pankhurst and radical socialist Richard Pankhurst and sister to Sylvia and Adela Pankhurst. Her father was a barrister and her mother owned a small shop. Christabel assisted her mother, who worked as the Registrar of Births and Deaths in Manchester. Despite financial struggles, her family had always been encouraged by their firm belief in their devotion to causes rather than comforts.

Nancy Ellen Rupprecht wrote, &quot;She was almost a textbook illustration of the first child born to a middle-class family. In childhood as well as adulthood, she was beautiful, intelligent, graceful, confident, charming, and charismatic.&quot; Christabel enjoyed a special relationship with both her mother and father, who had named her after &quot;Christabel&quot;, the poem by Samuel Taylor Coleridge (&quot;The lovely lady Christabel / Whom her father loves so well&quot;). Her mother&#x27;s death in 1928 had a devastating impact on Christabel.

==Education==
Pankhurst learned to read at her home on her own before she went to school. She and her two sisters attended Manchester High School for Girls. She obtained a law degree from the University of Manchester, and received honours on her LL.B. exam but, as a woman, was not allowed to practise law. Later Pankhurst moved to Geneva to live with a family friend, but, when her father died in 1898, returned home to help her mother raise the rest of the children.

==Activism==

===Suffrage===

In 1905 Christabel Pankhurst interrupted a Liberal Party meeting by shouting demands for voting rights for women. She was arrested and, along with fellow suffragette Annie Kenney, went to prison rather than pay a fine as punishment for their outburst. Their case gained much media interest and the ranks of the WSPU swelled following their trial. Emmeline Pankhurst began to take more militant action for the women&#x27;s suffrage cause after her daughter&#x27;s arrest and was herself imprisoned on many occasions for her principles.
After obtaining her law degree in 1906, Christabel moved to the London headquarters of the WSPU, where she was appointed its organising secretary. Nicknamed &quot;Queen of the Mob&quot;, she was jailed again in 1907 in Parliament Square and in 1909 after the &quot;Rush Trial&quot; at Bow Street Magistrates&#x27; Court. Between 1913 and 1914 she lived in Paris to escape imprisonment under the terms of the Prisoner&#x27;s (Temporary Discharge for Ill-Health) Act, better known as the &quot;Cat and Mouse Act&quot; but continued to provided editorial lead to &quot;The Suffragette&quot; through visitors such as Annie Kenney and Ida Wylie who crossed the Channel for her advice. Other campaigners visited Paris to have Christmas dinner with her in 1912; these included Irene Dallas, Hilda Dallas, Blanche Edwards and Alice Morgan Wright.

The start of World War I compelled her to return to England in 1914, where she was again arrested. Pankhurst engaged in a hunger strike, ultimately serving only 30 days of a three-year sentence.

She was influential in the WSPU&#x27;s &quot;anti-male&quot; phase after the failure of the Conciliation Bills. She wrote a book called &quot;The Great Scourge and How to End It&quot; on the subject of sexually transmitted diseases and how sexual equality (votes for women) would help the fight against these diseases.

She and her sister Sylvia did not get along. Sylvia was against turning the WSPU towards solely upper- and middle-class women and using militant tactics, while Christabel thought it was essential. Christabel felt that suffrage was a cause that should not be tied to any causes trying to help working-class women with their other issues. She felt that it would only drag the suffrage movement down and that all of the other issues could be solved once women had the right to vote.

===Wartime activities===
On 8 September 1914, Pankhurst re-appeared at London&#x27;s Royal Opera House after her long exile, to utter a declaration on &quot;The German Peril&quot;, a campaign led by the former General Secretary of the WSPU, Norah Dacre Fox in conjunction with the British Empire Union and the National Party. Along with Norah Dacre Fox (later known as Norah Elam), Pankhurst toured the country making recruiting speeches. Her sister Sylvia&#x27;s memoir included a reference to some of Christabel&#x27;s supporters handing the white feather to every young man they encountered wearing civilian dress. 

&quot;The Suffragette&quot; appeared again on 16 April 1915 as a war paper and on 15 October changed its name to &quot;Britannia.&quot; In its pages, week by week, Pankhurst called for the military conscription of men and the industrial conscription of women into national service. She called also for the internment of all people of enemy nationality, men and women, young and old, found on these shores. Her supporters attended Hyde Park meetings with placards: &quot;Intern Them All&quot;. She also championed a more complete and thorough enforcement of the blockade of enemy and neutral nations, arguing that this must be &quot;a war of attrition&quot;. She demanded the resignation of Sir Edward Grey, Lord Robert Cecil, General William Robertson and Sir Eyre Crowe, whom she considered too mild and dilatory in method. &quot;Britannia&quot; was many times raided by the police and experienced greater difficulty in appearing than had befallen &quot;The Suffragette.&quot; Indeed, although occasionally Norah Dacre Fox&#x27;s father, John Doherty, who owned a printing firm, was drafted in to print campaign posters, &quot;Britannia&quot; was compelled at last to set up its own printing press. Emmeline Pankhurst proposed to set up Women&#x27;s Social and Political Union Homes for illegitimate girl &quot;war babies&quot;, but only five children were adopted. David Lloyd George, whom Pankhurst had regarded as the most bitter and dangerous enemy of women, was now the one politician in whom she and Emmeline Pankhurst placed confidence.

===1918 General Election campaign in Smethwick===

After some British women were granted the right to vote at the end of World War I, Pankhurst announced that she would stand in the 1918 general election. At first she said she would contest Westbury in Wiltshire but at the last minute stood as a Women&#x27;s Party candidate, in the Smethwick constituency in alliance with the Lloyd George/Conservative Coalition. She was not issued with the &quot;Coalition Coupon&quot; letter signed by both Liberal and Unionist leaders. Her campaign focussed on a &quot;Victorious Peace&quot;, &quot;the Germans must pay for the War&quot; and &quot;Britain for the British&quot;. She was narrowly defeated, by only 775 votes, by the Labour Party candidate, local trade union leader John Davison.

===Move to California===
Leaving England in 1921, Pankhurst moved to the United States where she eventually became an evangelist with Plymouth Brethren links and became a prominent member of Second Adventist movement.

====Prophetic interests====
Marshall, Morgan, and Scott published Pankhurst&#x27;s works on subjects related to her prophetic outlook, which took its character from John Nelson Darby&#x27;s perspectives. Pankhurst lectured and wrote books on the Second Coming. She was a frequent guest on TV shows in the 1950s and had a reputation for being an odd combination of &quot;former suffragist revolutionary, evangelical Christian, and almost stereotypically proper &#x27;English Lady&#x27; who always was in demand as a lecturer&quot;. While in California, she adopted her daughter Betty, finally having recovered from her mother&#x27;s death.

===Damehood===
Pankhurst returned to Britain for a period in the 1930s and was appointed a Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire &quot;for public and social services&quot; in the 1936 New Year Honours. At the onset of World War II she again left for the United States, to live in Los Angeles, California.

==Death==
Christabel died 13 February 1958, at the age of 77. She died of a heart attack sitting in a straight-backed chair. She was buried in the Woodlawn Memorial Cemetery in Santa Monica, California.

==In popular culture==
She was played by Patricia Quinn in the TV series &quot;Shoulder to Shoulder&quot;.

==Posthumous recognition==
A profile bust of Christabel Pankhurst(left picture) on the right pylon of the Emmeline and Christabel Pankhurst Memorial in Victoria Tower Gardens was added to the memorial in 1959; it was unveiled on 13 July 1959 by Viscount Kilmuir. Her name and image (and those of 58 other women&#x27;s suffrage supporters) are etched on the plinth of the statue of Millicent Fawcett in Parliament Square, London, that was unveiled in 2018.

In 2006, a blue plaque(right picture) for Christabel and her mother was placed by English Heritage at 50, Clarendon Road, Notting Hill, London W11 3AD, where they had lived. Another blue plaque was erected on 19 October 2018 by the Marchmont Association at 8 Russell Square, London, WC1B 5BE.

<text>Mesoplodont whales are 16 species of toothed whale in the genus Mesoplodon, making it the largest genus in the cetacean order. Two species were described as recently as 1991 (pygmy beaked whale) and 2002 (Perrin&#x27;s beaked whale), and marine biologists predict the discovery of more species in the future. A new species was described in 2021. They are the most poorly known group of large mammals. The generic name &quot;mesoplodon&quot; comes from the Greek &quot;meso&quot;- (middle) - &quot;hopla&quot; (arms) - &quot;odon&quot; (teeth), and may be translated as &#x27;armed with a tooth in the centre of the jaw&#x27;.

==Physical description==

Mesoplodont beaked whales are small whales, (pygmy beaked whale) to (strap-toothed whale) in length, even compared with closely related whales such as the bottlenose whales and giant beaked whales.
The spindle-shaped body has a small dorsal fin and short and narrow flippers. The head is small and tapered and has a semicircular blow hole that is sometimes asymmetric. The beak, which vary in length between species, blends with the small melon without a crease.

Sexual dimorphism is poorly known, but the females tend to be the same size or larger than males at least in some species. The males typically have a bolder coloration and a unique dentition.
The males of most species are covered in scars from the teeth of other males.

The lower jaw often forms a huge arch in some species, sometimes extending above the rostrum in a shape comparable to a playground slide. Every species has large (sometimes tusk-like) teeth of variable size, shape, and position.

Both sexes often have bites from cookie-cutter sharks. The dorsal fin is rather small and located between two-thirds and three-quarters down the back of the animal. Information on longevity and lactation is non-existent, and information on gestation is nearly so.

==Behavior==
Most species are very rarely observed, and little is known about their behavior. They are typically found in groups, possibly segregated between sexes. Some species are so uncommon, they have yet to be observed alive. On the surface, they are typically very slow swimmers and do not make obvious blows. They have never been observed raising their flukes above the water. They are all very deep divers, and many feed entirely on squid.

==Conservation==
The mesoplodonts are completely unknown as far as population estimates are concerned. They have been hunted occasionally by the Japanese, but never directly. They are also accidentally captured in drift nets. It is not known what effect this has on the population.

Longman&#x27;s beaked whale (&quot;Indopacetus pacificus&quot;, also known as the Indo-Pacific beaked whale or the tropical bottlenose whale) was originally assigned to &quot;Mesoplodon&quot;, but Joseph Curtis Moore placed it in its own genus, &quot;Indopacetus&quot;, a taxonomic assignment which has been followed by all researchers.

Four extinct species of &quot;Mesoplodon&quot; are known, &quot;M. longirostris&quot; &quot;M. posti&quot;, &quot;M. slangkopi&quot;. and &quot;M. tumidirostris&quot;.

<doc id="366183" wikidata="Q2190250" url="?curid=366183" title="Filipinos (snack food)">
<text>Filipinos is the brand name for a series of biscuit doughnut snacks made by Mondelez International. In France, the Netherlands, Spain, Portugal and most Nordic countries they are produced and sold under the &#x27;Artiach&#x27; brand name. They have drawn controversy for having the same name as the people of the Philippines.

== Variations ==
The standard Filipinos snack is ring shaped and come in several varieties coated in either milk chocolate, dark chocolate, or white chocolate. Milk or dark chocolate versions feature a light colored biscuit. White chocolate versions feature a dark brown biscuit. These can be purchased in large rolls. The dark and white chocolate versions are also available in the &quot;Filipinos GoPack&quot; or &quot;Mini Filipinos&quot;, a smaller loose packet of four biscuits.

&quot;Filipinos Agujeros&quot; (holes) are crisp doughnut hole sized balls coated in either dark or white chocolate. &quot;Filipinos Bigsticks&quot; are crispy 20 cm (8 in) stick shaped snacks covered with puffed rice. These are coated in either dark or white chocolate.

== Controversy ==
The government of the Philippines filed a diplomatic protest with the government of Spain, the European Commission and the then manufacturer Nabisco Iberia in 1999. The protest objected to the use of the name &quot;Filipinos&quot;, a term which can refer to the people of the Philippines, to market cookie and pretzel snacks and demanded that Nabisco stop selling the product until the brand name was changed.

The resolution&#x27;s author, former Philippine Congressman and Senator Heherson Alvarez, claimed that the name of the cookie was offensive due to the apparent reference to their color, &quot;dark outside and white inside&quot;. His resolution stated &quot;These food items could be appropriately called by any other label, but the manufacturers have chosen our racial identity, and they are now making money out of these food items.&quot; On August 26, 1999, the Philippine president Joseph Estrada called the brand &quot;an insult&quot;.

The protest was filed despite Foreign Secretary Domingo Siazon&#x27;s initial reluctance on the matter. Siazon had reportedly said he saw nothing wrong with the use of &#x27;Filipinos&#x27; as a brand name, noting Austrians do not complain that small sausages are called &quot;Vienna sausages&quot;.

The controversial snack has been sold on the market for over 40 years. There were statements however, that the chocolate-covered snack was named &quot;Filipinos&quot; due to its brown outer layer and white inside before the snack was bought by Nabisco.

<doc id="366190" wikidata="Q152115" url="?curid=366190" title="Duchy of Warsaw">
<text>The Duchy of Warsaw (; ; ), also known as the Grand Duchy of Warsaw and Napoleonic Poland, was a French client state established by Napoleon Bonaparte in 1807, during the Napoleonic Wars. It initially comprised the ethnically Polish lands ceded to France by Prussia under the terms of the Treaties of Tilsit, and was augmented in 1809 with territory ceded by Austria in the Treaty of Schönbrunn. It was the first attempt to re-establish Poland as a sovereign state after the 18th-century partitions and covered the central and southeastern parts of present-day Poland.

The duchy was held in personal union by Napoleon&#x27;s ally, Frederick Augustus I of Saxony, who became the duke of Warsaw and remained a legitimate candidate for the Polish throne. Following Napoleon&#x27;s failed invasion of Russia, Napoleon seemingly abandoned the duchy, and it was left to be occupied by Prussian and Russian troops until 1815, when it was formally divided between the two countries at the Congress of Vienna. The east-central territory of the duchy acquired by the Russian Empire was subsequently transformed into a polity called Congress Poland, and Prussia formed the Grand Duchy of Posen in the west. The city of Kraków, Poland&#x27;s cultural centre, was granted &quot;free city&quot; status until its incorporation into Austria in 1846.

==History==
The area of the duchy had already been liberated by a popular uprising that had escalated from anti-conscription rioting in 1806. One of the first tasks for the new government included providing food to the French army fighting the Russians in East Prussia.

The Duchy of Warsaw was created by French Emperor Napoleon I, as part of the Treaty of Tilsit with Prussia. Its creation met the support of both local republicans in partitioned Poland, and the large Polish diaspora in France, who openly supported Napoleon as the only man capable of restoring Polish sovereignty after the Partitions of Poland of the late 18th century. However, it was created as a satellite state (and was only a duchy, rather than a kingdom). The Duchy has also been described as a puppet state or a client state of Napoleon&#x27;s France.

The newly recreated state was formally an independent duchy, allied to France, and in a personal union with the Kingdom of Saxony. King Frederick Augustus I of Saxony was compelled by Napoleon to make his new realm a constitutional monarchy, with a parliament (the Sejm of the Duchy of Warsaw).

The Varsovian duchy was never allowed to develop as a truly independent state; Frederick Augustus&#x27; rule was subordinated to the requirements of the French &quot;raison d&#x27;état&quot;, who largely treated the state as a source of resources. The most important person in the duchy was, in fact, the French ambassador, based in the duchy&#x27;s capital, Warsaw. Significantly, the duchy lacked its own diplomatic representation abroad.

In 1809, a short war with Austria started. Although the Duchy of Warsaw won the Battle of Raszyn, Austrian troops entered Warsaw, but Varsovian and French forces then outflanked their enemy and captured Kraków, Lwów and some of the areas annexed by Austria in the Partitions of Poland. During the war, the German colonists settled by Prussia during Partitions openly rose up against the Varsovian government. After the Battle of Wagram, the ensuing Treaty of Schönbrunn allowed for a significant expansion of the duchy&#x27;s territory southwards with the regaining of once-Polish and Lithuanian lands.

===Peninsular War===


===Napoleon&#x27;s campaign against Russia===

As a result of Napoleon&#x27;s campaign in 1812 against Russia, the Poles expected that the duchy would be upgraded to the status of a kingdom and that during Napoleon&#x27;s invasion of Russia, they would be joined by the liberated territories of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, Poland&#x27;s historic partner in the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. On 28 June, the Sejm formed the General Confederation of the Kingdom of Poland, establishing a system of government similar to the former commonwealth with the hope of reclaiming the partitioned territories. However, Napoleon did not want to make a permanent decision that would tie his hands before his anticipated peace settlement with Russia, and did not recognize the confederation of 28 June. Nevertheless, he proclaimed the attack on Russia as a &quot;second Polish war&quot; and allowed the Lithuanian Provisional Governing Commission to fall under Polish influence.

Any peace settlement or restoration of Poland-Lithuania were not to be, however. Napoleon&#x27;s &quot;Grande Armée&quot;, including a substantial contingent of Polish troops, set out with the purpose of bringing the Russian Empire to its knees, but his military ambitions were frustrated by his failure to supply the army in Russia and Russia&#x27;s refusal to surrender after the capture of Moscow; few returned from the march back. The failed campaign against Russia proved to be a major turning point in Napoleon&#x27;s fortunes.

After Napoleon&#x27;s defeat in the east, most of the territory of the Duchy of Warsaw was occupied by Russia in January 1813 during their advance on France and its allies. The rest of the duchy was restored to Prussia. Although several isolated fortresses held out for more than a year, the existence of the Varsovian state in anything but the name came to an end. Alexander I of Russia created a Provisional Highest Council of the Duchy of Warsaw to govern the area through his generals.

===The Congress of Vienna and the Fourth Partition===
Although many European states and ex-rulers were represented at the Congress of Vienna in 1815, the decision-making was largely in the hands of the major powers. It was perhaps inevitable, therefore, that both Prussia and Russia would effectively partition Poland between them; Austria was to more-or-less retain its gains of the First Partition of 1772.

Russia sought all territories of the Duchy of Warsaw. It kept all its gains from the three previous partitions, together with Białystok and the surrounding territory that it had obtained in 1807. Its demands for the whole Duchy of Warsaw were denied by other European powers.

Prussia regained some of the territory it had lost to the Duchy of Warsaw in 1807: a portion of what it had conquered in the Second Partition. The Kulmerland and Gdańsk (Danzig) became part of the Province of West Prussia; the remaining territories (i.e., Greater Poland/Poznań), which covered an area of approximately , were reconstituted into the Grand Duchy of Posen. The Grand Duchy and its populace had some nominal autonomy (although it was &quot;de facto&quot; subordinate to Prussia) but following the 1848 Greater Poland Uprising was fully integrated into Prussia as the Province of Posen.

The city of Kraków and some surrounding territory, previously part of the Duchy of Warsaw, were established as the semi-independent Free City of Cracow, under the &quot;protection&quot; of its three powerful neighbors. The city&#x27;s territory measured some , and had a population of about 88,000 people. The city was eventually annexed by Austria in 1846, becoming the Grand Duchy of Kraków.

Finally, the bulk of the former Duchy of Warsaw, measuring some , was re-established as what is commonly referred to as the &quot;Congress Kingdom&quot; of Poland, in a personal union with the Russian Empire. This broadly corresponded to the Prussian and Austrian portions of the Third Partition (apart from the area around Białystok) plus around half of Prussia&#x27;s Second Partition conquests and a small part of Austria&#x27;s First Partition gains. &quot;De facto&quot; a Russian puppet state, it maintained its separate status only until 1831 when it was effectively annexed to the Russian Empire. Its constituent territories became the Vistula Land in 1867.

== Government and politics ==

===Constitution===

The Constitution of the Duchy of Warsaw could be considered liberal for its time. It provided for a bicameral Sejm consisting of a Senate and a Chamber of Deputies. A Council of Ministers functioned as the executive body of the duchy. Serfdom was partially abolished, as the serfs were granted personal freedom without gaining any economic liberties or privileges. All classes were to be equal before the law, although the nobility was still greatly favoured as members of the Sejm. While Roman Catholicism was the state religion, and religious tolerance was also guaranteed by the constitution.

===Administrative divisions===

The administrative divisions of Duchy of Warsaw were based on departments, each headed by a prefect. This organization was based on the French model, as the entire duchy was in fact created by Napoleon and based on French ideas, although departments were divided into Polish powiats (counties).

There were 6 initial departments, after 1809 (after Napoleon&#x27;s defeat of the Austrians and the Treaty of Schönbrunn) increased to 10 (as the duchy territory increased). Each department was named after its capital city.

In January 1807:
*Warsaw Department ()
*Poznań Department ()
*Kalisz Department ()
*Bydgoszcz Department ()
*Płock Department ()
*Łomża Department () – for the first few months known as Białystok Department ()

The above 6 departments were divided into 60 powiats.

Added in 1809:
*Kraków Department ()
*Lublin Department ()
*Radom Department ()
*Siedlce Department ()
===Military===
The duchy&#x27;s armed forces were completely under French control via its war minister, Prince Józef Poniatowski, who was also a Marshal of France. In fact, the duchy was heavily militarized, bordered as it was by Prussia, the Austrian Empire, and Russia, and it was to be a significant source for troops in various campaigns of Napoleon.

The duchy&#x27;s army was of considerable size when compared to the duchy&#x27;s number of inhabitants. Initially consisting of 30,000 of regular soldiers (made up of both cavalry and infantry), its numbers were to rise to over 60,000 in 1810, and by the time of Napoleon&#x27;s campaign in Russia in 1812, its army totaled almost 120,000 troops out of a total population of just 4.3 million people – a similar number of troops in total available to Napoleon at Austerlitz, from a country of more than 25 million people.

===Economy===
The heavy drain on its resources by forced military recruitment, combined with a drop in exports of grain, caused significant problems for the duchy&#x27;s economy. To make matters worse, in 1808 the French Empire imposed on the duchy an agreement at Bayonne to buy from France the debts owed to it by Prussia. The debt, amounting to more than 43 million francs in gold, was bought at a discounted rate of 21 million francs.

Although the duchy made its payments in installments to France over a four-year period, Prussia was unable to pay it (due to a very large indemnity it owed to France), causing the Polish economy to suffer heavily. Indeed, to this day the phrase &quot;sum of Bayonne&quot; is a synonym in Polish for a huge amount of money. All these problems resulted in both inflation and over-taxation.

To counter the threat of bankruptcy, the authorities intensified the development and modernization of agriculture. Also, a protectionist policy was introduced to protect industry.

==Geography and demographics==
According to the Treaties of Tilsit, the area of the duchy covered roughly the areas of the 2nd and 3rd Prussian partitions, with the exception of Danzig (Gdańsk), which became the Free City of Danzig under joint French and Saxon &quot;protection&quot;, and of the district around Białystok, which became part of Russia. The Prussian territory was made up of territory from the former Prussian provinces of New East Prussia, Southern Prussia, New Silesia, and West Prussia. In addition, the new state was given the area along the Noteć river and the Land of Chełmno.

Altogether, the duchy had an initial area of around , with a population of approximately 2,600,000. The bulk of its inhabitants were Poles.

In 1809 the Duchy annexed West Galicia, the area of the 1795 Austrian partition, and the district of Zamość (): The duchy&#x27;s area increased significantly, to around , and the population also substantially increased, to roughly 4,300,000.

According to the 1810 census, the duchy had a population of 4,334,000, of whom a clear majority were ethnic Poles. Jews constituted 7% of the inhabitants (perhaps an underestimation), Germans – 6%, Lithuanians and Ruthenians – 4%.

== Legacy ==

Superficially, the Duchy of Warsaw was just one of the various states set up during Napoleon&#x27;s dominance over Eastern and Central Europe, lasting only a few years and passing with his fall. However, its establishment a little over a decade after the Second and Third Partitions, that had appeared to wipe Poland off the map, meant that Poles had their hopes rekindled of a resurrected Polish state. Even with Napoleon&#x27;s defeat, a Polish state continued in some form until the increasingly autocratic Russian state eliminated Poland once again as a separate entity. Altogether, this meant that an identifiable Polish state was in existence for at least a quarter of a century.

At the 200th anniversary of the creation of this iteration of the Polish state, numerous commemorative events dedicated to that event were held in the Polish capital of Warsaw. In addition, the Polish Ministry of Defense asked for the honor of holding a joint parade of Polish and French soldiers to which President Nicolas Sarkozy agreed.

<text>Sowerby&#x27;s beaked whale (Mesoplodon bidens), also known as the North Atlantic or North Sea beaked whale, is a species of toothed whale. It was the first mesoplodont whale to be described. James Sowerby, an English naturalist and artist, first described the species in 1804 from a skull obtained from a male that had stranded in the Moray Firth, Scotland, in 1800. He named it &quot;bidens&quot;, which derives from the two teeth present in the jaw, now known to be a very common feature among the genus.

==Physical description==

Sowerby&#x27;s beaked whale has a typical body shape for the genus, and is mainly distinguished by the male&#x27;s dual teeth positioned far back in the mouth. The whale&#x27;s beak is moderately long, and the melon is slightly convex. The colouration pattern is a grey with light countershading on the bottom, and frequently has cookiecutter shark bites and scars from teeth (in males). The whale reaches 5 metres (16 ft) in females and 5.5 metres (18 ft) in males, with a weight of 1000-1300 kilograms (2200-2900 lb). The gestation period lasts for 12 months and the young are born at a length of 2.4 to 2.7 metres (8 to 9 ft) with a weight of around 185 kilograms (400 lb).

==Diet==
The diet of Sowerby&#x27;s beaked whales consists primarily of small mesopelagic and benthopelagic fish, with cephalopods accounting for a much smaller proportion of the diet.

==Population and distribution==
Sowerby&#x27;s beaked whale ranges from Nantucket to Labrador in the western North Atlantic and from Madeira to the Norwegian Sea in the eastern North Atlantic. They typically range in waters 200 to 1,500 metres (650 to 5,000 ft) deep. No population estimates have been made. In 1991, there were about 90 records of the species, 80 from the eastern North Atlantic and less than ten from the western North Atlantic; the majority of the records are from around the British Isles.

On 10 January 2009, a female Sowerby&#x27;s beaked whale was found at the port of Fethiye on the Aegean coast of Turkey, far away from her natural habitat. The whale was successfully saved and released back to the open sea.

On 25 July 2015, biologists with the New England Aquarium investigated the death of a beaked whale in Massachusetts. The carcass of the long female, which weighed almost , was found on Plymouth Long Beach in Plymouth, Massachusetts. Biologists from the aquarium and the International Fund for Animal Welfare said they would perform a necropsy at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution. The whale was initially identified as a Sowerby&#x27;s beaked whale, but the aquarium said a more thorough examination and consultation with additional experts was needed as staff had not seen a beaked whale since 2006.

On 26 October 2018, a whale was found beached near the town of Saltdean, on the UK coast. The carcass was subsequently taken to the Natural History Museum, London for post-mortem. On 29 August 2019, a stranded whale was rescued from Dungarvan Bay, in southeast Ireland. On 4 July 2020, a whale became disorientated and strayed into Wicklow, harbour on the east coast of Ireland but was later discovered dead on Wicklow, beach.

On 21 August 2020, a long female Sowerby&#x27;s beaked whale washed up on the shore of a beach in Caister-on-Sea, Norfolk. Emergency services assisted the whale out to sea in an attempt to encourage the animal to live. Unfortunately the next morning a report was received to suggest the whale was stranded and deceased at Lowestoft, on the UK coast, following reported sights of 2 whales in the nearby towns of Brancaster and Blakeney in Norfolk earlier in the month.

On successive days in October 2020, two Sowerby&#x27;s beaked whales were washed up on separate beaches in East Lothian. Both animals died. The necropsy revealed that one of the whales had an unusually high density of small gas bubbles in the lung tissue, and both whales showed signs of gas emboli in the mesenteric arteries. These symptoms are often associated with decompression sickness, however it was not clear if this was the cause in this case. The MOD later revealed that, one day before the first whale stranded, airborne ASW sonar exercises had been carried out within of the stranding sites. There was not enough evidence from the necropsy to confirm decompression sickness as the cause of death, so the Scottish Marine Animal Stranding Scheme still consider these as live strandings. However, given the otherwise good physical health of the beaked whales combined with the unusual proximity in both time and location of their strandings, the use of sonar in the surrounding area should still be considered a possible factor in the stranding.

On 28 September 2024, the bodies of two Sowerby&#x27;s beaked whales, initially thought to be large dolphins, were sighted on a beach of near Eculleville, France on the Cotentin Peninsula. Before their bodies could be examined, they were pulled off the beach by the tide and washed up 50 km further down the coast off Biville, three days later. The whales were identified as an adult female and her young daughter. The local coast guard hypothesized that the adult became disoriented during a recent storm and ended up lost and unable to return to her usual swimming grounds and the daughter followed her to end up later beached, where both perished.

==Behaviour==

Sowerby&#x27;s beaked whales are reclusive creatures that stay away from ships and are rarely sighted. The whales are occasionally seen in groups of up to 10 individuals (males, females, and calves) and have been known to strand in groups as well. They hunt at depths greater than 500m, and dive to more than 1000m while foraging. Their swimming and diving behaviours are more similar to deep-diving delphinids such as Risso&#x27;s dolphins and pilot whales than to other mesoplodonts. Compared to Blainville&#x27;s beaked whales, a mesoplodont of similar body size, Sowerby&#x27;s beaked whales swim faster while descending and while actively foraging. Their dives are also relatively short and generally last between 30 and 40 minutes. Sowerby&#x27;s beaked whales cover long distances between dives by swimming at speed just below the surface of the water, as opposed to the typical beaked whale strategy, where time near the surface is minimised by travelling on shallow dives at depths between 100 and 200m.

==Conservation==

The species has been hunted infrequently by Norwegians, but such practices have long since been abandoned. There are some deaths due to entanglement in fishing gear, but it is unlikely to be very damaging to the species. Sowerby&#x27;s beaked whale is covered by the Agreement on the Conservation of Small Cetaceans of the Baltic, North East Atlantic, Irish and North Seas (ASCOBANS) and the Agreement on the Conservation of Cetaceans in the Black Sea, Mediterranean Sea and Contiguous Atlantic Area (ACCOBAMS). The species is further included in the Memorandum of Understanding Concerning the Conservation of the Manatee and Small Cetaceans of Western Africa and Macaronesia (Western African Aquatic Mammals MoU).

<text>Hubbs&#x27; beaked whale (Mesoplodon carlhubbsi) was initially thought to be an Andrews&#x27; beaked whale when discovered by ichthyologist Carl Hubbs; however, it was named in his honor when it was discovered to be a new species. This species has the typical dentition found in the genus, but its main outstanding features are a white &quot;cap&quot; on the head and very extensive scarring. The species is known from 31 strandings, a few at-sea sightings, and observations of two stranded whales that were kept in captivity for 16–25 days.

==Taxonomy==

Carl Leavitt Hubbs, a noted American ichthyologist, published a description of a whale found alive in the surf near his office at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in La Jolla, California, in 1945. He believed it to be Andrews&#x27; beaked whale (a very similar species found only in the Southern Hemisphere), but Joseph Curtis Moore, an expert on beaked whales at Chicago&#x27;s Field Museum, reassigned it to a new species, &quot;Mesoplodon carlhubbsi&quot;, in 1963, naming it in his honor.

==Description==
Hubbs’ beaked whale &quot;M. carlhubbsi&quot; has a light ventral surface and a midventral portion grading from white to medium gray dorsally. The dorsal surface of the flipper is slightly darker than the adjacent thorax in adult females, with a faint light patch on the distal posterior edge. However, the light patch is more noticeable in adult males. The head of adult male &quot;M. carlhubbsi&quot; is the most striking feature- black with naturally white areas on the tip of the rostrum and anterior to the blowhole. For females, the tip of the rostrum is distinctly lighter than the rest of the head. Males also have a strong pair of teeth protruding from the mandibular symphysis.

==Population and distribution==
It is estimated &quot;M. carlhubbsi&quot; are along the coast of Japan and Pacific coast of North America. The distribution along North America extends from San Diego to Prince Rupert. Southern limit is unknown but the northern limit is Vancouver Island. Distribution is probably not directly related to the character of the water mass but rather follows the distribution of the prey species it feeds on. &quot;M. carlhubbsi&quot; follows prey items in intermediate and deep-water masses, rather than surface water masses.

==Behavior==
Stomach contents of stranded &quot;M. carlhubbsi&quot; contained squid beaks, fish otoliths, and fish bones. Prey species included &quot;Gonatus&quot; sp., &quot;Chauliodus macouni&quot;, &quot;Icichthys lockingtoni&quot;, and &quot;Poromitra crassiceps&quot;. Researchers assume calving takes place in the summer based on lengths of neonatal specimens, gestational period, and fetal growth in most cetaceans. On October 3 they found a 90 cm fetus which had about 160 cm of growth before birth which gives an estimated time of birth of about mid-May. A few acoustic and other behavioral observations were made of stranded &quot;M. carlhubbsi&quot; when they were held briefly in captivity. A stereotyped beaked whale echolocation pulse type (termed BW37V) is thought to be made by this species but has not been linked to a sighting, so this attribution is considered provisional.

==Conservation==
The species has been occasionally killed by Japanese whalers and has been caught in driftnets off California. Recent strandings in Hawaii have occurred, supporting the theory of open ocean habitation by this species. Threats include fishing and harvesting of aquatic resources, pollution, and climate change. &quot;M. carlhubbsi&quot; are occasionally taken by Japanese whalers and small cetacean fisheries. Incidental catches in drift gillnets occur sporadically off the coast of California. Climate change and severe weather may cause &quot;M. carlhubbsi&quot; to shift habitat. Also, as with most beaked whales, they may be vulnerable to loud anthropogenic sounds, especially those generated by navy sonar and seismic exploration.

<doc id="366196" wikidata="Q4113790" url="?curid=366196" title="Mainland Japan">
<text>is a term used to distinguish Japan&#x27;s core land area from its outlying territories. &quot;Mainland Japan&quot; was an official term in the pre-war period, distinguishing Japan proper from its overseas territories (外地, &quot;gaichi&quot;, lit. &quot;outer lands&quot;) in the Far East, such as Japanese Taiwan, Japanese Korea, Karafuto, the South Seas Mandate, and the Kwantung Leased Territory. After the end of World War II, its usage became less common and lost its previous legal significance.

The term&#x27;s literal Japanese meaning might best be translated as &quot;inner Japan&quot; or &quot;inner lands&quot;. The term &quot;mainland&quot; is somewhat inaccurate since it usually refers to all or part of a continental landmass, rather than islands.

Today, the term is sometimes colloquially used to distinguish the country&#x27;s four largest islands (Hokkaidō, Honshū, Kyūshū, and Shikokū) from smaller islands such as the Bonin Islands and the Ryukyu Islands, although these islands were considered part of Mainland Japan in the pre-war period. However, depending on the context, the term &quot;Mainland Japan&quot; may refer only to Honshū, the largest island.

==Historical usage==
In the Japanese Empire of the pre-war period, &quot;naichi&quot; referred to the mainland of the empire. The other territories of the empire was called &quot;gaichi&quot; (外地, lit. &quot;outer lands&quot;).

The Meiji Constitution&#x27;s Article 1 of the Common Law (共通法) enumerates the territories with legal jurisdictions namely:

===Naichi===
&quot;Naichi&quot; (内地, lit. &quot;inner lands&quot;) referred to the territories under direct control of the government. They consisted of the following:

*Karafuto (since 1943)
*Chishima Islands (since 1875)
*Hokkaidō
*Honshū
*Shikoku
*Kyūshū
*Izu Islands
*Ryukyu Islands (since 1879)
*Nanpō Islands (since 1891)
**Ogasawara Islands
**Iwo Islands
**Okinotorishima
**Minamitorishima
*Minor outlying islands around them

===Gaichi===

These territories were called &quot;gaichi&quot; (外地, lit. &quot;outer lands&quot;). They were part of the Empire of Japan, but not under direct control by the central government.

* Hokkaido (until 1947)
* Ryukyu Islands (until 1879)
* Taiwan
** Shinnan Islands (since 1938)
** Seisa Islands (since 1938)
* Karafuto (until 1943)
* Chōsen
* Kwantung Province
* South Manchuria Railway Zone
* South Seas Mandate
* Kiautschou Bay Leased Territory
* Tianjin
* Hankou
* Chongqing
* Suzhou
* Hangzhou
* Shashi

Although it has never been abolished, the Common Law lost effect from enforcement after Japan lost all the former colonies, or &quot;gaichi&quot; as a result of World War II.

==Modern usage==
Residents of places like Hokkaidō, Okinawa and Amami occasionally use &quot;naichi&quot; to refer to the &quot;mainland&quot;, excluding these areas. The colloquial usage is officially &quot;incorrect&quot;, as both areas are legally within &quot;naichi&quot;. In Hokkaidō, the official term that refers to Japan except Hokkaidō is &quot;dōgai&quot; (lit. outside of Hokkaidō). With &quot;dōgai&quot; becoming common even in colloquial use, &quot;naichi&quot; ceased to be used. Residents of Okinawa also use the term &quot;hondo&quot; (lit. mainland) to refer to parts of Japan outside of Okinawa. In Japanese law, the meaning of &quot;hondo&quot; is used to make a distinction between the &quot;main islands&quot; of Hokkaidō, Honshū, Shikoku, and Kyūshū and &quot;outlying islands&quot; referred to as &quot;ritō&quot;. 

The term &quot;main islands&quot; (本島 &quot;hontō&quot;) is used for Hokkaido, Honshu, Kyushu, Shikoku and Okinawa. The other estimated 6,847 smaller islands are called &#x27;remote islands&#x27; (離島 &quot;ritō&quot;).

<doc id="366199" wikidata="Q636590" url="?curid=366199" title="Blainville's beaked whale">
<text>Blainville&#x27;s beaked whale (Mesoplodon densirostris), or the dense-beaked whale, is believed to be the widest ranging mesoplodont whale. The French zoologist Henri de Blainville first described the species in 1817 from a small piece of jaw — the heaviest bone he had ever come across — which resulted in the name &quot;densirostris&quot; (Latin for &quot;dense beak&quot;). Off the northeastern Bahamas, the animals are particularly well documented, and a photo identification project started sometime after 2002.

==Taxonomy==

In 1817, Blainville named the species Delphinus densirostris, based on the description of a nine-inch piece of rostrum of unknown origin housed in the Paris Museum. It became one of the first beaked whales to be identified. The second specimen, a complete skull sent from the Seychelles by a M. Leduc in 1839, was named Ziphius seychellensis by the English zoologist John Edward Gray in 1846; the French scientist Paul Gervais later placed this specimen in the genus Dioplodon (&quot;two-toothed&quot;). Sometimes called dense-beaked whale as the current Latin name (Mesoplodon densirostris) derives from densus for ‘dense’ and rostrum for ‘beak’ . For management purposes, Blainville&#x27;s beaked whales inhabiting U.S. waters have been divided into the Hawaiian, northern Gulf of Mexico, and western North Atlantic stocks.

==Description==
The body of Blainville&#x27;s beaked whale is robust, but also somewhat compressed laterally compared with other mesoplodonts. The males have a highly distinctive appearance, the jaws overarch the rostrum, like a handful of other species, but does it towards the beginning of the mandible and then sloped down into a moderately long beak. In adult males the crown of a tooth erupts from each side of the lower jaw as they reach maturity. Barnacles are often attached to the exposed tooth. One of the more remarkable features of the whale is the extremely dense bones in the rostrum, which have a higher density and mechanical stiffness than any other bone yet measured. At present, the function of these bones is unknown, as the surrounding fat and the brittleness of the bone make it unlikely to be used for fighting. It has been suggested that it may play a role in echolocation or as ballast, but without sufficient behavioral observation, this cannot be confirmed. The melon of the whale is flat and comparatively small. Coloration is dark bluish grey on top and lighter gray on the bottom, and the head can be brownish shading to light grey around the lip and the jaw. Skin discoloration might be caused by diatoms. They might have white oval scars possibly caused by cookie-cutter sharks. Adult males can also have long white ‘scratch’ scars. Males reach at least 4.4 m (14 ft 5 in) and 800 kg (1,800 lb), whereas females reach at least 4.6 m (15&#x27;) and 1 tonne (2200 pounds). Juveniles are 1.9 m (6 ft 3 in) long when born and weigh 60 kg (130 lb). No data on lifespan is available.

==Geographic range and distribution==

This species of beaked whale is found in tropical and warm waters in all oceans, and is considered to be the most extensively distributed member of Mesoplodon genus. Sightings occur in higher latitudes probably in relation to warm water currents such as Gulf Stream and the Agulhas Current. Groups are regularly seen in at least three locations: Waianae coast, Hawaii; Society Islands of the South Pacific; northeastern Bahamas.

The mean group size is 4.1 individuals. There is no evidence of seasonal migration. It inhabits deep, offshore water (656 to 3281 feet deep) and is associated with steep underwater geological structures. Sub-adult males are found further offshore and in deeper water than adult males due to dominance hierarchy. Blainville’s beaked whales have a long-term site fidelity meaning they return to the same area repeatedly or stay in the area for extended periods of time. Resight rate is higher for females than males as they are more likely to base their distribution based on prey abundance when males follow females to increase mating opportunity 

==Behavior==
=== Foraging ===
This species feeds primarily on squid and small fish and cephalopods.

Blainville&#x27;s beaked whales do not capture prey by biting. They use suction feeding to capture prey. They create low pressure in the mouth by retracting tongue, and using throat grooves to expand throat volume. This creates a lower pressure in the mouth than the surrounding waters, allowing the whale to suck in water and whole prey.

Blainville’s beaked whale shows similar foraging behaviour during the day and night, however the time spent on surface is greater during the night.

=== Social behaviour===

Blainville&#x27;s beaked whales can live in small cohesive groups of 3 to 7 individuals. Groups consist of both sexes and combination of ages or might be segregated. Harems of several females and a single mature male have been observed in productive continental shelf areas (eg. Bahamas). Males compete for females which probably causes scarring on individuals. The function of the group formation is protection (for females with small calves) and mating opportunity (for adult males).

Two signals were identified with possible communicative function: fast series of ultrasonic frequencies modulated by clicks and harmonical rich short whistles with mean fundamental frequency of 12 kHz. Because Blainville&#x27;s beaked whales almost exclusively vocalize while on their dives, most believe that they are using sound to help their foraging. However, while on their dives they will produce whistles which are most commonly known for communication among odontocetes rather than echolocation for foraging.

Blainville’s beaked whales remain silent for up to 80% of the time, especially in depth shallower than 170m and during silent ascent from vocal dives. This behaviour might be a protection mechanism against shallow-diving predators such as killer whales.

=== Migration and Movement ===
There is no evidence of seasonal migration.

Beaked whales are among the longest and deepest divers of any cetaceans. Mean diving depth for Blainville’s beaked whale is 922m with maximum 1408 m. The species dives primarily to forage for food in the deep ocean, usually diving &gt;800 m when foraging and can stay underwater for 48-68 min. For longer dives ascent rates are slower than descent rates. After a dive they spend an extensive period of time (66-155min) in the upper 50 m of the water column.

In a study published in 2008, diving statistics of beaked whales were analyzed and no significant difference was found in diving behavior between day and night. For example, mean and max duration, number of deep dives, max depth, and ascent and descent rates were all calculated as equal during the day and night. However, the number of mid-depth dives was recorded to be six times higher during the day than at night. These results suggest that Blainville&#x27;s beaked whales forage the same amount during the day and night, but switch to deeper-water prey at night.

===Reproduction===
Lifespan estimate is unknown. Sexual maturity might be reached at 9 years old. Calving interval and gestation period are unknown.

==Population status ==
NOAA Fisheries presents estimates of population size of U.S. stocks (Hawaiian, northern Gulf of Mexico, western North Atlantic) in stock assessment reports .

== Threats ==
=== Protection status ===

Blainville’s Beaked Whale is protected throughout its range by CITES Appendix II and MMPA Protected. The Blainville&#x27;s beaked whale is covered by the Agreement on the Conservation of Small Cetaceans of the Baltic Sea, North East Atlantic, Irish and North Seas (ASCOBANS)  and the Agreement on the Conservation of Cetaceans in the Black Sea, Mediterranean Sea and Contiguous Atlantic Area (ACCOBAMS). The species is further included in the Memorandum of Understanding Concerning the Conservation of the Manatee and Small Cetaceans of Western Africa and Macaronesia (Western African Aquatic Mammals MoU) and the Memorandum of Understanding for the Conservation of Cetaceans and Their Habitats in the Pacific Islands Region (Pacific Cetaceans MoU).

=== Whaling ===
The beaked whale has occasionally been hunted, but has never been a specific target.

=== Noise pollution ===
Beaked whales are susceptible to detrimental effects of anthropogenic noise pollution because they use sound for hunting, communication and navigation. The broadband ship noise can cause a change in beaked whale behaviour up to 5.2 km from the boat. Whales have been reported to move away from the noise source and decrease their activity level. Sonar use during naval military activities have been associated with multiple strandings throughout their range. Infrequent and unpredictable noise is perceived as a threat and influences whale behaviour. Response is especially strong in noise-free areas where whales show avoidance of the noise which might be associated with life-threatening increased energetic costs.

=== Entanglement ===
Blainville’s beaked whales are occasionally reported as a bycatch throughout its range.

=== Marine debris ===
Marine debris has been identified in the stomach of stranded Blainville’s Beaked Whale. Marine debris ingestion was reported as a cause of death of beaked whales.

<text>Gervais&#x27;s beaked whale (Mesoplodon europaeus), sometimes known as the Antillean beaked whale, Gulf Stream beaked whale, or European beaked whale (from which its scientific name is derived) is the most frequently stranding type of mesoplodont whale off the coast of North America. It has also stranded off South America and Africa.

==History of discovery==

Sometime between 1836 and 1841, a captain of one of the ships of the French merchant and armorer Abel Vautier came across a large animal floating at the entrance to the English Channel, its body covered by swarming gulls. He cut the head off and transported it to Caen, where he presented it to Vautier. Vautier in turn offered it to the anatomist Deslongchamps. The specimen somehow made its way to the French scientist Paul Gervais, who described it as a new species in 1855. 

For several decades this remained as the only known specimen of this species, with many disregarding its specific status and claiming it merely represented an aberrant adult Sowerby&#x27;s beaked whale. 

The species’ identity was confirmed by the discovery of two specimens from New Jersey, an immature male captured near Atlantic City in 1889 and an adult female found stranded at North Long Branch in 1905.

==Description==

This species is the largest of the mesoplodonts and rather gracile, elongated, and laterally compressed compared with the others. The mouthline is remarkably straight, even in males, and the two teeth of the male erupt towards the tip of the beak, and are hardly noticeable. The head is overall small and tapering in outline. The melon only bulges very slightly. The coloration is dark gray on top and lighter gray on bottom. Females sometimes have lighter spots near the genitals and face, with a dark circle remaining around the eyes. Juveniles start off with a lighter coloration, but soon darken. Males are in length and females are at least and probably weigh more than . Calves are believed to be in length. One beached specimen may have been 48 years old.

==Behavior==

Judging by strandings, the whales occur in small groups. They probably feed on squid.

A sighting made in 1998, west of the island of Tenerife, involved three whales swimming over waters 1500 meters deep. Another small group was seen south of the island of Gran Canaria. 

Although timid, the whales allowed close photos. They surfaced for a short time, and their dives lasted for around an hour.

In September 2008, northeast of the island of Lanzarote, some Gervais&#x27; beaked whales were photographed breaching out of the water.

On May 5, 2011, one juvenile female specimen was found dead and beached at &quot;Playa Larga&quot; in Maunabo in southeastern Puerto Rico. The juvenile had her stomach filled with (10 pounds) of plastic bags. 

On July 10 of the same year, one specimen was found dead in the Yucatán Peninsula, Mexico. Further investigation is being performed to confirm the species in this case.

==Population and distribution==

The species is believed to be naturally rare, and no population estimates have been attempted.

Since the discovery of the type specimen, it has been found off the eastern coast of the United States, Ireland, the Canary Islands, western Africa, and Ascension Island. 

In August 2001, a specimen was found off São Paulo, Brazil, the southernmost specimen found to date. 

Although this species frequently strands, until 1998 no one had made a confirmed sighting of the species. Sightings remain rare.

There had been a possible stranding of this species in Israel.

==Conservation==
The species has not been hunted and only very infrequently gets tangled in fishing nets. Gervais&#x27;s beaked whale is covered by the Agreement on the Conservation of Small Cetaceans of the Baltic, North East Atlantic, Irish and North Seas (ASCOBANS) and the Agreement on the Conservation of Cetaceans in the Black Sea, Mediterranean Sea and Contiguous Atlantic Area (ACCOBAMS). The species is further included in the Memorandum of Understanding Concerning the Conservation of the Manatee and Small Cetaceans of Western Africa and Macaronesia.

<doc id="366207" wikidata="Q2273147" url="?curid=366207" title="Villanella">
<text>In music, a villanella (; plural villanelle) is a form of light Neapolitan secular vocal music which originated in the Kingdom of Naples just before the middle of the 16th century. It first appeared in Naples, and influenced the later canzonetta, and from there also influenced the madrigal.

The subject matter is generally rustic, comic, and often satirical; frequently the mannerisms of art music, such as the madrigal, are a subject of parody. The rhyme scheme of the verse in the earlier Neapolitan forms of the villanelle is usually , where &quot;R&quot; is a refrain repeated exactly. The villanelle became one of the most popular forms of song in Italy around mid-century.

The music of the early villanella (known as the canzone villanesca) is invariably for three unaccompanied voices. The first composers of villanelle were the Neapolitans Giovanni Domenico da Nola and Giovan Tomaso di Maio; later composers, no longer from Naples, included Adrian Willaert, Luca Marenzio, Adriano Banchieri, Orlande de Lassus, and others.

<doc id="366208" wikidata="Q2607208" url="?curid=366208" title="Typed lambda calculus">
<text>A typed [[lambda calculus]] is a typed formalism that uses the lambda symbol (formula_1) to denote anonymous function abstraction. In this context, types are usually objects of a syntactic nature that are assigned to lambda terms; the exact nature of a type depends on the calculus considered (see kinds below). From a certain point of view, typed lambda calculi can be seen as refinements of the untyped lambda calculus, but from another point of view, they can also be considered the more fundamental theory and &quot;untyped lambda calculus&quot; a special case with only one type.

Typed lambda calculi are foundational programming languages and are the base of typed functional programming languages such as ML and Haskell and, more indirectly, typed imperative programming languages. Typed lambda calculi play an important role in the design of type systems for programming languages; here, typability usually captures desirable properties of the program (e.g., the program will not cause a memory access violation).

Typed lambda calculi are closely related to mathematical logic and proof theory via the Curry–Howard isomorphism and they can be considered as the internal language of certain classes of categories. For example, the simply typed lambda calculus is the language of Cartesian closed categories (CCCs).

== Kinds of typed lambda calculi ==
Various typed lambda calculi have been studied. The simply typed lambda calculus has only one type constructor, the arrow formula_2, and its only types are basic types and function types formula_3. System T extends the simply typed lambda calculus with a type of natural numbers and higher-order primitive recursion; in this system all functions provably recursive in Peano arithmetic are definable. System F allows polymorphism by using universal quantification over all types; from a logical perspective it can describe all functions that are provably total in second-order logic. Lambda calculi with dependent types are the base of intuitionistic type theory, the calculus of constructions and the logical framework (LF), a pure lambda calculus with dependent types. Based on work by Berardi on pure type systems, Henk Barendregt proposed the Lambda cube to systematize the relations of pure typed lambda calculi (including simply typed lambda calculus, System F, LF and the calculus of constructions).

Some typed lambda calculi introduce a notion of &quot;subtyping&quot;, i.e. if formula_4 is a subtype of formula_5, then all terms of type formula_4 also have type formula_5. Typed lambda calculi with subtyping are the simply typed lambda calculus with conjunctive types and System F&lt;:.

All the systems mentioned so far, with the exception of the untyped lambda calculus, are &quot;strongly normalizing&quot;: all computations terminate. Therefore, they cannot describe all Turing-computable functions. As another consequence they are consistent as a logic, i.e. there are uninhabited types. There exist, however, typed lambda calculi that are not strongly normalizing. For example the dependently typed lambda calculus with a type of all types (Type : Type) is not normalizing due to Girard&#x27;s paradox. This system is also the simplest pure type system, a formalism which generalizes the Lambda cube. Systems with explicit recursion combinators, such as Plotkin&#x27;s &quot;Programming language for Computable Functions&quot; (PCF), are not normalizing, but they are not intended to be interpreted as a logic. Indeed, PCF is a prototypical, typed functional programming language, where types are used to ensure that programs are well-behaved but not necessarily that they are terminating.

== Applications to programming languages ==
In computer programming, the routines (functions, procedures, methods) of strongly typed programming languages closely correspond to typed lambda expressions.

<text>Charles Reznikoff (August 31, 1894 – January 22, 1976) was an American poet best known for his long work, &quot;Testimony: The United States (1885–1915), Recitative&quot; (1934–1979). The term Objectivist was coined for him. The multi-volume &quot;Testimony&quot; was based on court records and explored the experiences of immigrants, black people and the urban and rural poor in the United States in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. He followed this with &quot;Holocaust&quot; (1975), based on court testimony about Nazi death camps during World War II.

In 1930 Reznikoff married Marie Syrkin, a prominent Zionist and friend and biographer of Golda Meir. Although they did not live together at all times during the marriage, it lasted until Reznikoff&#x27;s death.

When Louis Zukofsky was asked by Harriet Monroe to provide an introduction to what became known as the Objectivist issue of &quot;Poetry&quot;, he contributed his essay, &quot;Sincerity and Objectification: With Special Reference to the Work of Charles Reznikoff&quot;. This established the name of the loose-knit group of second-generation modernist poets and the two characteristics of their poetry: sincerity and objectification.

==Early years==
Charles Reznikoff was born in 1894 in a Jewish neighborhood in Brooklyn, New York, the son of immigrants Sarah Yetta (Wolvovsky) Reznikoff and Nathan Reznikoff, who fled the Russian Empire and its pogroms. His Hebrew name was Ezekial, after his maternal grandfather. His father established a family business of manufacturing hats, and Reznikoff briefly worked there as a salesman in his 20s. He was young when he graduated from high school and had already started writing poetry. He spent a year studying journalism in graduate school at the University of Missouri, where Reznikoff realized he was interested in writing more than reporting news. He entered the law school of New York University in 1912 and graduated in 1916. He practiced law during the period 1916-1918. In 1918 as the United States had entered the Great War, he entered officer training school. He did not see active service before the end of the war.

Reznikoff worked for a time for his family&#x27;s business as a hat salesman. He worked for a legal publishing house, where he wrote summaries of court records for legal reference books. This experience was to prove integral to his later writing.

From his teens, Reznikoff had been writing poetry, much of it influenced by the Imagists. He published his own work, using a second-hand press for which he set the type himself. Throughout his writing life, Reznikoff was always concerned to ensure that his work was published, even at his own expense. This appears to have been inspired by a family story of his grandfather, an unpublished Hebrew poet whose manuscripts were destroyed after his death, for fear of their falling into Russian hands.

==Objectivist poet==
Around the time the Objectivist issue of &quot;Poetry&quot; appeared, Reznikoff, Zukofsky and George Oppen set up &quot;To Publishers&quot; and later the Objectivist Press, essentially to publish their own work. Reznikoff had had some success with his 1930 novel &quot;By the Waters of Manhattan&quot;, and the new press published three titles by him, two that gathered together previously self-published work and the third a first installment of a long work called &quot;Testimony&quot;.

==Court poetry==
In early drafts, &quot;Testimony&quot; was a prose retelling of stories that Reznikoff had discovered while working on court records. Reznikoff found these accounts to give him insight into the story of America between 1885 and 1915, both in its diversity and its violence. Tellingly, he chose to omit the judgements, focusing on the twists and turns of the stories.

Over the following forty years, Reznikoff worked on refashioning these stories into an extended found poem, which finally ran to some 500 pages over two volumes. He tried to express the stories in as near as possible the words of the participants. As a result, his poetry was almost entirely stripped of metaphor and of authorial personality and emotion. In this sense, &quot;Testimony&quot; can be read as the great monument of Objectivist poetry.

The poetic mode which Reznikof developed in writing this work was invaluable to his work on &quot;Holocaust.&quot; It was based on testimony in court cases related to the Nazi concentration camps and death camps. He also adopted this style for his poetry that reworked stories from the Torah or Old Testament.

==Late recognition==
Reznikoff lived and wrote in relative obscurity for most of his life, with his work being either self-published or issued by small independent presses. In the 1960s, at the behest of friend and fellow poet George Oppen, and Oppen&#x27;s sister June Oppen Degnan, New Directions published two books of his poetry: &quot;By the Waters of Manhattan&quot; (1962, New Directions/San Francisco Review NDP121), which had an Introduction by C. P. Snow; and &quot;Testimony: The United States 1885–1890&quot; (1965, New Directions/San Francisco Review NDP200). But, despite acclaim from fellow poets such as Hayden Carruth, May Swenson, and Denise Levertov, critical reaction was generally negative. Reznikoff had to return to self-publishing to see his work in print.

In 1971, he was awarded the Morton Dauwen Zabel Prize of $2,500 by The National Institute of Arts and Letters. Around this time, he found a new publisher, Black Sparrow Press. They published &quot;By the Well of Living and Seeing: New and Selected Poems, 1918-1973&quot; in 1974. At the time of his death, Reznikoff was correcting proofs of the first volume of the Black Sparrow &quot;Collected Poems&quot;. In the years immediately following his death, Black Sparrow reprinted all his major poetry and prose works. In addition, it published for the first time his completed novel, &quot;The Manner “Music”&quot; (1977), found among his papers.

==Representation in other media==
In 2013, the band Joan of Arc, with the help of the experimental performance group, Every House Has a Door, created a musical/theater piece based on Reznikoff&#x27;s &quot;Testimony&quot;. The album inspired by his work was called &quot;Testimonium Songs&quot; and released on Polyvinyl Record Co. and Joyful Noise Recordings.

The song &quot;Texas Reznikoff&quot; by the singer-songwriter Mitski, from her album &quot;Bury Me at Makeout Creek&quot; (2014), refers to Reznikoff&#x27;s work. In a 2016 interview Mitski cited Reznikoff as an influence on her music, and praised his poetic precision and ability to &quot;create a striking image in people’s brains&quot;.

Reznikoff is mentioned in Yannick Haenel&#x27;s novel &quot;Tiens ferme ta couronne&quot; (2017), published in English as &quot;Hold Fast the Crown&quot;. One of the novel&#x27;s chapters is named after him.

<doc id="366211" wikidata="Q1216129" url="?curid=366211" title="Neelix">
<text>Neelix () is a character in the science fiction television series &quot;Star Trek: Voyager&quot;, played by actor Ethan Phillips since the series&#x27; inception. Neelix is an alien native to the far side of the galaxy, who joins the crew of the United Federation of Planets starship USS &quot;Voyager&quot; after it is captured and flung to the Delta Quadrant by a mysterious shockwave. He serves as a cook, morale officer, and eventual ambassador for the crew.

== Casting ==
Neelix was played by actor Ethan Phillips. Phillips has a master&#x27;s degree in fine arts from Cornell University, and had his start in acting performing on Broadway shows.

==Biography==
The character of Neelix is from Rinax, a moon of the planet Talax, located in the Delta Quadrant of the show&#x27;s fictional representation of the Milky Way galaxy. His entire family was killed in a conflict with the Haakonian race.

Neelix was introduced in &quot;Caretaker&quot;, the two-part pilot episode of the series, where he was rescued along with his Ocampan lover Kes by the &quot;Voyager&quot; crew. Previously a space trader, Neelix states his familiarity with the Delta Quadrant and appoints himself the ship&#x27;s cook. He later earns the titles of Morale Officer and Chief Ambassador. When Naomi Wildman becomes the first baby born aboard &quot;Voyager&quot;, her mother Samantha names Neelix as her daughter&#x27;s godfather.

Neelix departs the show in the seventh season&#x27;s 23rd episode &quot;Homestead&quot;. The ship encounters a colony of Talaxians, the last of his species that he is likely to see as the ship travels further from his home, and he chooses to stay with them. The character returns for a cameo in the series finale, &quot;Endgame&quot;.

==&quot;The Star Trek Cookbook&quot;==

The persona of Neelix is also the central character in &quot;The Star Trek Cookbook&quot;, published by Pocket Books/Star Trek; 1st edition (January 1, 1999; ) by Ethan Phillips and William J. Birnes. The cookbook includes contributions by &quot;Star Trek&quot; actors from across several series and movies, as the cook of the USS &quot;Voyager&quot; accounts for the eclectic task of feeding its 140 diverse crew members. The recipe book also features a fictional guide for whipping up the drinks served at Quark&#x27;s.

The cookbook has real recipes often named after Alien meals from the Star Trek universe, but prepared with traditional real-life ingredients. There is also a section that discusses how food props were made for the television show by Alan Simms.

==Reception==
In 2018, &quot;The Wrap&quot; ranked Neelix as the fourth-worst character of &quot;Star Trek&quot; overall (out of 39 main characters), but noted his optimism and humour. In 2016, the character was ranked as the 62nd most important character in service to Starfleet within the &quot;Star Trek&quot; science fiction universe (out of 100 characters) by &quot;Wired&quot; magazine.

In 2019, &quot;TMZ&quot; remembered Neelix as the &quot;super-friendly chef, navigator and ambassador&quot; of &quot;Star Trek: Voyager&quot;.

In 2020, &quot;SyFy&quot; felt that Neelix had a hard time getting good storylines compared to the other characters, with an exception being &quot;Mortal Coil&quot;, which they ranked the 12th best episode of &quot;Star Trek: Voyager&quot;.

In 2021, &quot;The Digital Fix&quot; felt &quot;Fair Trade&quot; was an attempt to develop the character of Neelix, who they said has a &quot;crisis of purpose&quot; in this episode.

Some commentators felt Kes was too young to be dating Neelix. According to &quot;Den of Geek&quot;″s Juliette Harrisson, the age gap was frequently criticized online. Science fiction author Sylvia Spruck Wrigley interpreted Kes as undergoing puberty in &quot;Elogium&quot;, noting that it raises questions about Neelix starting a relationship with a prepubescent girl. Harrisson and &quot;The Philadelphia Inquirer&quot;″s Jonathan Storm wrote that the age difference could be rationalized since Kes and Neelix are aliens with different biology than humans.

<doc id="366213" wikidata="Q1062580" url="?curid=366213" title="Irish Republican Brotherhood">
<text>The Irish Republican Brotherhood (IRB; ) was a secret oath-bound fraternal organisation dedicated to the establishment of an &quot;independent democratic republic&quot; in Ireland between 1858 and 1924. Its counterpart in the United States of America was initially the Fenian Brotherhood, but from the 1870s it was Clan na Gael. The members of both wings of the movement are often referred to as &quot;Fenians&quot;. The IRB played an important role in the history of Ireland, as the chief advocate of republicanism during the campaign for Ireland&#x27;s independence from the United Kingdom, successor to movements such as the United Irishmen of the 1790s and the Young Irelanders of the 1840s.

As part of the New Departure of the 1870s–80s, IRB members attempted to democratise the Home Rule League and its successor, the Irish Parliamentary Party, as well as taking part in the Land War. The IRB staged the Easter Rising in 1916, which led to the establishment of the first Dáil Éireann in 1919. The suppression of Dáil Éireann precipitated the Irish War of Independence and the signing of the Anglo-Irish Treaty in 1921, ultimately leading to the establishment of the Irish Free State, which excluded the territory of Northern Ireland.

==Background==

In 1798 the United Irishmen, which had initially been an open political organisation, but which was later suppressed by the British establishment in Ireland and so became a secret revolutionary organisation, rose in rebellion, seeking an end to British rule in Ireland and the establishment of an Irish Republic. The rebellion was suppressed, but the principles of the United Irishmen were to have a powerful influence on the course of Irish history.

Following the collapse of the rebellion, the British prime minister William Pitt introduced a bill to abolish the Irish parliament and manufactured a Union between Ireland and Britain. Opposition from the Protestant oligarchy that controlled the parliament was countered by the widespread and open use of bribery. The Act of Union was passed, and became law on 1 January 1801. The Catholics, who had been excluded from the Irish parliament, were promised emancipation under the Union. This promise was never kept, and caused a protracted and bitter struggle for civil liberties. It was not until 1829 that the British government reluctantly conceded Catholic emancipation. Though leading to general emancipation, this process simultaneously disenfranchised the small tenants, known as &#x27;forty shilling freeholders&#x27;, who were mainly Catholics. This resulted in the Irish Catholic electorate going from 216,000 voters to 37,000. A massive reduction in the number of Catholics being able to vote.

Daniel O’Connell, who had led the emancipation campaign, then attempted the same methods in his campaign, to have the Act of Union with Britain repealed. Despite the use of petitions and public meetings which attracted vast popular support, the government thought the Union was more important than Irish public opinion.

During the early 1840s, the younger members of the repeal movement became impatient with O’Connell&#x27;s over-cautious policies, and began to question his intentions. Later they were what came to be known as the Young Ireland movement. In 1842 three of the Young Ireland leaders, Thomas Davis, Charles Gavan Duffy and John Blake Dillon, launched the &quot;Nation&quot; newspaper. In the paper they set out to create a spirit of pride and an identity based on nationality rather than on social status or religion. Following the collapse of the Repeal Association and with the arrival of famine, the Young Irelanders broke away completely from O’Connell in 1846.
The blight that destroyed the potato harvest between 1845 and 1850 caused a massive human tragedy. An entire social class of small farmers and labourers were to be virtually wiped out by hunger, disease and emigration. The &quot;laissez-faire&quot; economic thinking of the government ensured that help was slow, hesitant and insufficient. Between 1845 and 1851 the population fell by almost two million, or about a third of the total.

That the people starved while livestock and grain continued to be exported, quite often under military escort, left a legacy of bitterness and resentment among the survivors. The waves of emigration because of the famine and in the years following, also ensured that such feelings were not confined to Ireland, but spread to England, the United States, Australia, and every country where Irish emigrants gathered.

Shocked by the scenes of starvation and greatly influenced by the revolutions then sweeping Europe, the Young Irelanders moved from agitation to armed rebellion in 1848. The attempted rebellion failed after a small skirmish in Ballingary, County Tipperary, coupled with a few minor incidents elsewhere. The reasons for the failure were obvious, the people were totally despondent after three years of famine, having been prompted to rise early resulted in an inadequacy of military preparations, which caused disunity among the leaders.

The government quickly rounded up many of the instigators. Those who could fled across the seas, and their followers dispersed. A last flicker of revolt in 1849, led by among others James Fintan Lalor, was equally unsuccessful.

John Mitchel, the most committed advocate of revolution, had been arrested early in 1848 and transported to Australia on the purposefully created charge of Treason-felony. He was to be joined by other leaders, such as William Smith O&#x27;Brien and Thomas Francis Meagher who had both been arrested after Ballingary. John Blake Dillon escaped to France, as did three of the younger members, James Stephens, John O&#x27;Mahony and Michael Doheny.

==Founding of the IRB==

After the collapse of the 1848 rebellion James Stephens and John O&#x27;Mahony went to Europe to avoid arrest. In Paris they supported themselves through teaching and translation work and planned the next stage of &quot;the fight to overthrow British rule in Ireland.&quot; Stephens set himself three tasks during his seven years of exile in Paris. These were: to keep alive, to pursue knowledge, and to master the technique of conspiracy. At this time Paris was interwoven with a network of secret political societies. Stephens and O&#x27;Mahony became members of one of the most powerful of these societies and acquired the secrets of some of the ablest and &quot;most profound masters of revolutionary science&quot; which the 19th century had produced, as to the means of inviting and combining people for the purposes of successful revolution.

In 1853, O&#x27;Mahony went to America and founded the Emmet Monument Association. In early 1856, Stephens began making his way back to Ireland, stopping first in London. On arriving in Dublin, Stephens began what he described as his three thousand mile walk through Ireland, meeting some of those who had taken part in the 1848/49 revolutionary movements, including Philip Gray, Thomas Clarke Luby and Peter Langan.
In the autumn of 1857, a messenger, Owen Considine arrived from New York with a message for Stephens from members of the Emmet Monument Association, calling on him to set up an organisation in Ireland. Considine also carried a private letter from O’Mahony to Stephens which was a warning as to the condition of the organisation in New York, which was overseen by Luby and Stephens at the time. Both had believed that there was a strong organisation behind the letter, only later to find it was a number of loosely linked groups.

On 23 December Stephens dispatched Joseph Denieffe to America with his reply which was disguised as a business letter, and dated and addressed from Paris. In his reply Stephens outlined his conditions and his requirements from the organisation in America. Stephens demanded uncontrolled power and £100 a month for the first three months. Denieffe returned on 17 March 1858 with the acceptance of Stephens terms and £80. Denieffe also reported that there was no actual organised body of sympathisers in New York but merely a loose knot of associates. This disturbed Stephens but he went ahead regardless and that evening, St. Patrick&#x27;s Day, the Irish Republican Brotherhood commenced.

The original oath, with its clauses of secrecy was drawn up by Luby under Stephens&#x27; direction in Stephens&#x27; room in Donnelly&#x27;s which was situated behind Lombard Street. Luby then swore Stephens in and he did likewise.

Those present in Langan&#x27;s, lathe-maker and timber merchant, 16 Lombard Street for that first meeting apart from Stephens and Luby were Peter Langan, Charles Kickham, Joseph Denieffe and Garrett O&#x27;Shaughnessy. Later it would include members of the &quot;Phoenix National and Literary Society&quot;, which was formed in 1856 by Jeremiah O&#x27;Donovan Rossa in Skibbereen.

===Organisational structure===
The IRB was organised into circles, a &quot;circle&quot; was analogous to a regiment, that the &quot;centre&quot; or A, who might be considered equivalent to a colonel, who chose nine B&#x27;s, or captains, who in their turn chose nine C&#x27;s, or sergeants, who in their turn chose nine D&#x27;s, who constituted the rank and file. In theory an A should only be known to the B&#x27;s; a B, to his C&#x27;s: and a C, to his D&#x27;s; but this rule was often violated.

===Objectives===

Dublin Castle was the seat of government administration in Ireland and was appointed by the British cabinet and was accountable only to the cabinet, not to the House of Commons and not to the Irish people or their political representatives. Irish MPs could speak at Westminster in protest about the actions of the administration, but its privileges were unchallengeable as Irish representation in the House of Commons was only one sixth of the total and far too small.

Fenianism therefore, according to O&#x27;Mahony was symbolised by two principles: Firstly, that Ireland had a natural right to independence, and secondly, that that right could be won only by an armed revolution. Because of their belief in republicanism, that is, the &quot;common people are the rightful rulers of their own destiny&quot;, the founding members saw themselves as &quot;furious democrats in theory&quot; and declared their movement to be &quot;wholly and unequivocally democratic&quot;. Being a democrat and egalitarian in the mid 19th century was tantamount to being a revolutionary, and was something to be feared by political establishments.

It was Stephens &quot;firm resolution to establish a democratic republic in Ireland; that is, a republic for the weal of the toiler&quot;, and that this would require a complete social revolution before the people could possibly become republicans.
In propagating republican principles, they felt, the organisation would create this virtual democracy within the country, which would form the basis of an independence movement.

The Fenians soon established themselves in Australia, South America, Canada and, above all, in the United States, as well as in the large cities of England, such as London, Manchester, Liverpool, and Glasgow, in Scotland.

=== The oath ===

The original IRB oath, as quoted by Thomas Clarke Luby and John O&#x27;Leary, and which is among several versions in James Stephens&#x27;s own papers, ran:

This oath was significantly revised by Stephens in Paris in the summer of 1859. He asked Luby to draw up a new text, omitting the secrecy clause. The omitting of the secrecy clause was outlined in a letter from Stephens to John O&#x27;Mahony on 6 April 1859 and the reasons for it. &#x27;Henceforth,’ wrote Luby to O’Leary &quot;we denied that we were technically a secret body. We called ourselves a military organisation; with, so to speak, a legionary oath like all soldiers.&quot;

The revised oath ran:

In yet a later version it read:
===Supreme Council===
The IRB was re-organised at a convention in Manchester in July 1867. An 11-man Supreme Council was elected to govern the movement. They would eventually be representatives from the seven districts in which the organisation was organised: the Irish provinces of Ulster, Munster, Leinster and Connacht, as well as Scotland, North England, and South England. The remaining four members were co-opted. The Supreme Council elected three of its members to the executive, which consisted of a president, secretary, and a treasurer. The Council met twice a year, usually in the spring and the summer. In Manchester August 1867 Thomas Kelly was declared Chief Organiser of the Irish Republic (COIR), in succession to Stephens. The arrest and subsequent rescue of Kelly with Timothy Deasy in September 1867 resulted in the execution of the Manchester Martyrs. Kelly escaped to USA and remained associated with the IRB.

===United States organisation===
Late in 1858 Stephens travelled to the United States to secure support and financial backing. He was unsuccessful, however, in winning the support of former Young Irelanders such as John Mitchel and Thomas Francis Meagher. Eventually, he joined with John O&#x27;Mahoney and Michael Doheny to form the Fenian Brotherhood, intended as the American sister organisation of the IRB, with O&#x27;Mahoney as its president. The precise relationship between the two organisations was never properly set out. In the early 1870s the Fenian Brotherhood was superseded as the main American support organisation by Clan na Gael, of which John Devoy was a leading member. The IRB and Clan na Gael reached a &quot;compact of agreement&quot; in 1875, and in 1877 the two organisations established a joint &quot;revolutionary directory&quot;. This effectively gave Devoy control over the Supreme Council in Ireland, which was reliant on Clan na Gael for funds.

==Nineteenth century==

===Establishment reaction===

The movement was denounced by the British establishment, the press, the Catholic Church and Irish political elite, as had been all Irish Republican movements at that point.

The Tories, disturbed by the increase in republican propaganda, particularly in America, launched a propaganda campaign in the Irish press to discredit the American Fenians. They presented them as enemies of Catholicism quoting negative comments by some American Catholic bishops. As in Irish-America, likewise Ireland and England, the Catholic hierarchy felt the growth of nationalist politics among Irishmen was essentially dangerous. Therefore, during the 1860s and succeeding decades, the upper or middle classes who controlled the Irish press were very apprehensive in the growth of democratic politics in Ireland, which represented to them a threat of anarchy and revolution.

It was feared that if Britain was given any reason to renew coercion, Catholic interests in both Ireland and England would be undermined. In addition, the small class of Irish Catholic merchants, lawyers and gentry who had prospered under the Union felt anxious for the same reasons. By 1864, the Tories had coined the phrase &#x27;Fenianism&#x27; to describe all that was considered potentially bothersome among Irishmen on both sides of the Atlantic.

Fenianism as a term was then used by the British political establishment to depict any form of mobilisation among the lower classes and, sometimes, those who expressed any Irish nationalist sentiments. They warned people about this threat to turn decent civilised society on its head such as that posed by trade unionism to the existing social order in England. The same term was taken up by members of the Irish Catholic hierarchy, who also began denouncing &quot;Fenianism&quot; in the name of the Catholic religion. One Irish Bishop, David Moriarty of Kerry, declared that &quot;when we look down into the fathomless depth of this infamy of the heads of the Fenian conspiracy, we must acknowledge that eternity is not long enough, nor hell hot enough to punish such miscreants.&quot;

===&quot;Irish People&quot;===

In mid-1863 Stephens informed his colleagues he wished to start a newspaper, with financial aid from O’Mahony and the Fenian Brotherhood in America. The offices were established at 12 Parliament Street, almost at the gates of Dublin Castle. The first edition of the &quot;Irish People&quot; appeared on 28 November 1863. The staff of the paper along with Kickham were Luby and Denis Dowling Mulcahy as the editorial staff. O’Donovan Rossa and James O’Connor were in charge of the business office, with John Haltigan being the printer. John O&#x27;Leary was brought from London to take charge in the role of Editor. Shortly after the establishment of the paper, Stephens departed on an American tour, and to attend to organisational matters.

American Fenians made plans for a rising in Ireland, but the plans were discovered on 15 July 1865 when an emissary lost them at Kingstown railway station. They found their way to Dublin Castle and to Superintendent Daniel Ryan head of G Division. Ryan had an informer within the offices of the &quot;Irish People&quot; named Pierce Nagle, he supplied Ryan with an &quot;action this year&quot; message on its way to the IRB unit in Tipperary. With this information, Ryan raided the offices of the &quot;Irish People&quot; on Thursday 15 September, followed by the arrests of O’Leary, Luby and O’Donovan Rossa. The last edition of the paper is dated 16 September 1865.

===Arrests and escapes===

Before leaving, Stephens entrusted to Luby a document containing secret resolutions on the Committee of Organization or Executive of the IRB. Though Luby intimated its existence to O’Leary, he did not inform Kickham as there seemed no necessity. This document would later form the basis of the prosecution against the staff of the Irish People. The document read:
Kickham was caught after a month on the run. Stephens would also be caught, but with the support of Fenian prison warders, John J. Breslin and Daniel Byrne was less than a fortnight in Richmond Bridewell when he vanished and escaped to France. David Bell evaded arrest, escaping first to Paris and then to New York

===Fenian Rising===

During the latter part of 1866, Stephens endeavoured to raise funds in America for a fresh rising planned for the following year. He issued a bombastic proclamation in America announcing an imminent general rising in Ireland; but he was himself soon afterwards deposed by his confederates, among whom dissension had broken out.

The Fenian Rising proved to be a &quot;doomed rebellion&quot;, poorly organised and with minimal public support. Most of the Irish-American officers who landed at Cork, in the expectation of commanding an army against England, were imprisoned; sporadic disturbances around the country were easily suppressed by the police, army and local militias.

===Manchester Martyrs and Clerkenwell explosion===
On 22 November 1867 three Fenians, William Philip Allen, Michael O&#x27;Brien, and Michael Larkin known as the Manchester Martyrs, were executed in Salford for their attack on a police van to release Fenians held captive earlier that year.

On 13 December 1867 the Fenians exploded a bomb in attempt to free one of their members being held on remand at Clerkenwell Prison in London. The explosion damaged nearby houses, killed 12 people and caused 120 injuries. None of the prisoners escaped. The bombing was later described as the most infamous action carried out by the Fenians in Great Britain in the 19th century. It enraged the public, causing a backlash of hostility in Britain which undermined efforts to establish home rule or independence for Ireland.

===Irish National Invincibles===
In 1882, a breakaway IRB faction calling itself the Irish National Invincibles assassinated the British Chief Secretary for Ireland Lord Frederick Cavendish and his secretary, in an incident known as the Phoenix Park Murders.

===Special Irish Branch===
In March 1883 the Metropolitan Police&#x27;s Special Irish Branch was formed, initially as a small section of the Criminal Investigation Department, to monitor IRB activity.

==Twentieth century==

By the start of the 20th century, the IRB was a stagnating organisation, concerned more with Dublin municipal politics than the establishment of a republic, according to F. S. L. Lyons. A younger generation of Ulster republicans aimed to change this, and in 1905 Denis McCullough and Bulmer Hobson founded the Dungannon Clubs. Inspired by the Volunteers of 1782, the purpose of these clubs was to discourage enlistment into the British Army, and encourage enlistment into the IRB, with the overall goal of complete independence from Britain in the form of an Irish Republic. They were joined by Seán Mac Diarmada, and in 1908 he and Hobson relocated to Dublin, where they teamed up with veteran Fenian Tom Clarke. Clarke had been released from Portland Prison in October 1898 after serving fifteen and a half years, and had recently returned to Ireland after living in the United States. Sent by John Devoy and the Clan na Gael to reorganise the IRB, Clarke set about to do just that. In 1909 the young Michael Collins was introduced to the brotherhood by Sam Maguire. By 1914 the Supreme Council was largely purged of its older, tired leadership, and was dominated by enthusiastic men such as Hobson, McCullough, Patrick McCartan, John MacBride, Seán Mac Diarmada, and Tom Clarke. The latter two were to be the primary instigators of the Easter Rising in 1916.
===Easter Rising===

Following the establishment of the Ulster Volunteers in 1912, whose purpose was to resist Home Rule, by force if necessary, the IRB were behind the initiative which eventually led to the inauguration of the Irish Volunteers in November 1913. Though the Volunteers&#x27; stated purpose was not the establishment of a republic, the IRB intended to use the organisation to do just that, recruiting high-ranking members into the IRB, notably Joseph Plunkett, Thomas MacDonagh, and Patrick Pearse, who was co-opted to the Supreme Council in 1915. These men, together with Clarke, MacDermott, Éamonn Ceannt and eventually James Connolly of the Irish Citizen Army, constituted the Military Committee, the sole planners of the Rising. In January 1916 the Supreme Council decided that the rising should start on Easter Sunday, 23 April 1916.

===War of Independence, Civil War and dissolution===
Following the Rising some republicans—notably Éamon de Valera and Cathal Brugha—left the organisation, which they viewed as no longer necessary, since the Irish Volunteers now performed its function. The IRB, during the 1919–21 War of Independence, was under the control of Michael Collins, who was secretary, and subsequently president, of the Supreme Council. Volunteers such as Séumas Robinson said afterwards that the IRB by then was &quot;moribund where not already dead&quot;, but there is evidence that it was an important force during the war.

When the Anglo-Irish Treaty was signed on 6 December 1921, it was debated by the Supreme Council, which voted to accept it by eleven votes to four. Those on the Supreme Council who opposed the Treaty included former leader Harry Boland, Austin Stack and Liam Lynch. Anti-Treaty republicans like Ernie O&#x27;Malley, who fought during the Civil War against the Treaty, saw the IRB as being used to undermine the Irish Republic. The IRB became quiescent during the Civil War, which ended in May 1923, but it emerged again later that year as a faction within the National Army that supported Minister for Defence Richard Mulcahy against the &quot;Old IRA&quot;, which fought against the recruitment of ex-British Army personnel and the demobilization of old IRA men. This came to a head with the Army Mutiny of 1924, in the wake of which Mulcahy resigned and other IRB members of the army were dismissed by acting President of the Executive Council Kevin O&#x27;Higgins. The IRB subsequently dissolved itself, although it is not known whether a formal decision was taken, or it simply ceased to function.

<text>Mechanics&#x27; institutes, also known as mechanics&#x27; institutions, sometimes simply known as institutes, and also called schools of arts (especially in the Australian colonies), were educational establishments originally formed to provide adult education, particularly in technical subjects, to working men in Victorian-era Britain and its colonies. They were often funded by local industrialists on the grounds that they would ultimately benefit from having more knowledgeable and skilled employees. The mechanics&#x27; institutes often included libraries for the adult working class, and were said to provide them with an alternative pastime to gambling and drinking in pubs.

Many of the original institutes included lending libraries, and the buildings of some continue to be used as libraries. Others have evolved into parts of universities, adult education facilities, theatres, cinemas, museums, recreational facilities, or community halls. Few are still referred to as mechanics&#x27; institutes, but some retain the name and focus as centre of intellectual and cultural advancement. A 21st-century movement, originating in Victoria, Australia, has organised a series of conferences known as Mechanics&#x27; Institutes Worldwide Conferences, at which information and ideas for the future of mechanics&#x27; institutes are discussed.

==Origins and history==
The foundations of the movement which created mechanics&#x27; institutes were in lectures given by George Birkbeck at the Andersonian Institute in Glasgow. His fourth annual lecture attracted a crowd of 500, and became an annual occurrence after his departure for London in 1804, leading to the eventual formation on 16 October 1821 of the first mechanics&#x27; institute in Edinburgh, the Edinburgh School of Arts (later Heriot-Watt University). Its first lecture was on chemistry, and within a month it was subscribed to by 452 men who each paid a quarterly subscription fee. This new model of technical educational institution gave classes for working men, and included libraries as well as apparatus to be used for experiments and technical education. Its purpose was to &quot;address societal needs by incorporating fundamental scientific thinking and research into engineering solutions&quot;. The school revolutionised access to education in science and technology for ordinary people.

The first mechanics&#x27; institute in England was opened at Liverpool in July 1823.

The second institute in Scotland was incorporated in Glasgow in November 1823, built on the foundations of a group started by Birkbeck. Under the auspices of the Andersonian Institute, where Birkbeck had been chair of natural philosophy from 1799 to 1804 and instituted free lectures on arts, science and technical subjects from 1800. This mechanics&#x27; class continued to meet after he moved to London in 1804, and in 1823 they decided to formalise their organisation by incorporating themselves as the Mechanics&#x27; Institute. He was appointed director of the institute, which he had originally endowed with the sum of £3700, and held the office till his death in 1841.
The London Mechanics&#x27; Institute (later Birkbeck College) was opened in December 1823, and the mechanics&#x27; institutes in Ipswich and Manchester (later to become UMIST) in 1824. By the mid-19th century, there were over 700 institutes in towns and cities across the UK and overseas, some of which became the early roots of other colleges and universities. For example, the University of Gloucestershire, has the Cheltenham Mechanics&#x27; Institute (1834) and Gloucester Mechanics&#x27; Institute (1840) within its history timeline. It was as a result of delivering a lecture series at the Cheltenham Mechanics&#x27; Institute that the radical George Holyoake was arrested and then convicted on a charge of blasphemy.

In Australia, the first mechanics&#x27; institute was established in Hobart in 1827, followed by the Sydney Mechanics&#x27; School of Arts in 1833, Newcastle School of Arts in 1835, then the Melbourne Mechanics&#x27; Institute established in 1839 (renamed the Melbourne Athenaeum in 1872). From the 1850s, mechanics&#x27; institutes quickly spread throughout Victoria wherever a hall, library or school was needed. Over 1200 mechanics&#x27; institutes were built in Victoria and just over 500 remain today, and only six still operate their lending library services.

The Industrial Revolution created a new class of reader in Britain by the end of the 18th century, &quot;mechanics&quot;, who were civil and mechanical engineers in reality. The Birmingham Brotherly Society was founded in 1796 by local mechanics to fill this need, and was the forerunner of mechanics&#x27; institutes, which grew in England to over seven hundred in number by 1850.

Small tradesmen and workers could not afford subscription libraries, so for their benefit, benevolent groups and individuals created mechanics&#x27; institutes that contained inspirational and vocational reading matter, for a small rental fee. Later popular non-fiction and fiction books were added to these collections. The first known library of this type was the Birmingham Artisans&#x27; Library, formed in 1823.

Some mechanics&#x27; libraries lasted only a decade or two, and many eventually became public libraries or (in the United States) were given to local public libraries after the Public Libraries Act 1850 passed. Though use of the mechanics&#x27; libraries was limited, the majority of the users were favourable towards the idea of free public libraries. However, by 1900 there were over 9,000 mechanics institutes around the world.

Beyond a lending library, mechanics&#x27; institutes also provided lecture courses, laboratories, and in some cases contained a museum for the members&#x27; entertainment and education. The Glasgow Institute, founded in 1823, not only had all three, it was also provided free light on two evenings a week from the local gas light company. The London Mechanics&#x27; Institute installed gas illumination by 1825, revealing the demand and need for members to use the books. Some mechanics&#x27; institutes also offered a programme from the arts; Wisbech Mechanics&#x27; institute booked Mrs Butler to give readings from Shakespeare&#x27;s plays and Milton&#x27;s &quot;Paradise Lost&quot; to audiences of nearly a thousand.

G. Jefferson explains:
The first phase, the Mechanics Institute movement, grew in an atmosphere of interest by a greater proportion of the population in scientific matters revealed in the public lectures of famous scientists such as Faraday. More precisely, as a consequence of the introduction of machinery a class workmen emerged to build, maintain and repair, the machines on which the blessing of progress depended, at a time when population shifts and the dissolving influences of industrialization in the new urban areas, where these were concentrated, destroyed the inadequate old apprentice system and threw into relief the connection between material advancement and the necessity of education to take part in its advantages. 

==21st century revival==
Across the world, there is a move to sustain and revive mechanics&#x27; institutes and related institutions as subscription libraries, sometimes incorporating or expanding their earlier functions. There have been several worldwide conferences, known as the Mechanics&#x27; Worldwide Conference, of representatives of, or people who have an interest in, mechanics&#x27; institutes. As of 2021, there have been five such conferences:
*2004: &quot;Buildings, Books and Beyond: Mechanics&#x27; Worldwide&quot;, at Swinburne University, Prahran, Victoria, and the Prahran Mechanics&#x27; Institute, Australia
*2009: &quot;Self Help: Mechanics&#x27; Worldwide&quot;, at the Bath Royal Literary and Scientific Institution, Bath, Somerset, England
*2012: &quot;Buildings, Books and Blackboards – Intersecting Narratives: Mechanics&#x27; Worldwide&quot;. RMIT University, Melbourne, Australia.
*2016: &quot;Reinvention: Thriving in the 21st Century Mechanics&#x27; Worldwide&quot;, Mechanics&#x27; Institute, San Francisco, California, U.S.
*2021: &quot;Mechanics&#x27; Institutes: Past, Present and Future – Mechanics&#x27; Institutes Worldwide&quot;. Heriot-Watt University, Edinburgh, Scotland, and online (due to the COVID-19 pandemic)

==By country==
Thousands of mechanics&#x27; institutes buildings still operate throughout the world, mostly now used as libraries, parts of universities, adult education facilities, and a few still use their original names and function as a society or other type of organisation.

===Australia===
In the Australian colonies, Mechanics&#x27; Institutes were often called Schools of Arts, and they were more likely to be run by the middle-classes. The provision of reading rooms, museums, lectures and classes were still important, but the Australian schools were also more likely to include a social programme in their calendar of events.

The earliest and most prominent institute in Tasmania was Van Diemen&#x27;s Land Mechanics&#x27; Institution, also known as Hobart Town Mechanics&#x27; Institute, Hobart (1827–1871), co-founded by George Augustus Robinson.

The Sydney Mechanics&#x27; School of Arts (1833), in Sydney, New South Wales, is the oldest school of arts still operating and the largest institute in Australia. Others in NSW include the Moruya Mechanics&#x27; Institute and the Scone School of Arts.

In South Australia, the South Australian Institute (1838, then 1847–), was the forerunner of the State Library of South Australia, the South Australian Museum, and the Art Gallery of South Australia.

The first institute in the colony of Victoria was the Melbourne Mechanics&#x27; Institute, created in 1839. It was renamed The Melbourne Athenaeum in 1872, and continues to operate a library, theatres and shops in the original building. Many mechanics&#x27; institutes, athenaeums, schools of arts and related institutions in the state of Victoria are well documented by the Mechanics&#x27; Institutes of Victoria, Inc., whose members range from the well-resourced Melbourne Athenaeum to the tiny Moonambel Mechanics&#x27; Institute in Moonambel. In the following decades, almost every town in Victoria had a mechanics&#x27; institute, usually including a hall, library and reading rooms, games facilities, and both educational programs and entertainment.

The first Western Australian institute was the Swan River Mechanics&#x27; Institute, established in 1851, later renamed the Perth Literary Institute.

In Queensland, the Brisbane School of Arts was created in 1873, in a former servants&#x27; home. The building was added to the Queensland Heritage Register in 1992.

Over time, as local and state governments started providing libraries, community centres and other types of educational facilities, mechanics&#x27; institutes became less important in communities.

<doc id="366220" wikidata="Q1975444" url="?curid=366220" title="Adjunct (grammar)">
<text>In linguistics, an adjunct is an optional, or &quot;structurally dispensable&quot;, part of a sentence, clause, or phrase that, if removed or discarded, will not structurally affect the remainder of the sentence. Example: In the sentence &quot;John helped Bill in Central Park&quot;, the phrase &quot;in Central Park&quot; is an adjunct. 

A more detailed definition of the adjunct emphasizes its attribute as a modifying form, word, or phrase that depends on another form, word, or phrase, being an element of clause structure with adverbial function. An adjunct is not an argument (nor is it a predicative expression), and an argument is not an adjunct. The argument–adjunct distinction is central in most theories of syntax and semantics. The terminology used to denote arguments and adjuncts can vary depending on the theory at hand. Some dependency grammars, for instance, employ the term &quot;circonstant&quot; (instead of &quot;adjunct&quot;), following Tesnière (1959).

The area of grammar that explores the nature of predicates, their arguments, and adjuncts is called valency theory. Predicates have valency; they determine the number and type of arguments that can or must appear in their environment. The valency of predicates is also investigated in terms of subcategorization.

==Examples==
Take the sentence &quot;John helped Bill in Central Park on Sunday&quot; as an example:

:# &quot;John&quot; is the subject argument.
:# &quot;helped&quot; is the predicator.
:# &quot;Bill&quot; is the object argument.
:# &quot;in Central Park&quot; is the first adjunct.
:# &quot;on Sunday&quot; is the second adjunct.

An &quot;adverbial adjunct&quot; is a sentence element that often establishes the circumstances in which the action or state expressed by the verb takes place. The following sentence uses adjuncts of time and place:

::Yesterday, Lorna saw the dog in the garden.

Notice that this example is ambiguous between whether the adjunct &quot;in the garden&quot; modifies the verb &quot;saw&quot; (in which case it is Lorna who saw the dog while she was in the garden) or the noun phrase &quot;the dog&quot; (in which case it is the dog who is in the garden). The definition can be extended to include adjuncts that modify nouns or other parts of speech (see noun adjunct).

==Forms and domains==
An adjunct can be a single word, a phrase, or an entire clause.

::Single word
::She will leave tomorrow.

::Phrase
::She will leave in the morning.

::Clause
::She will leave after she has had breakfast.

Most discussions of adjuncts focus on adverbial adjuncts, that is, on adjuncts that modify verbs, verb phrases, or entire clauses like the adjuncts in the three examples just given. Adjuncts can appear in other domains, however; that is, they can modify most categories. An adnominal adjunct is one that modifies a noun: for a list of possible types of these, see Components of noun phrases. Adjuncts that modify adjectives and adverbs are occasionally called &quot;adadjectival&quot; and &quot;adadverbial&quot;.

::the discussion before the game – &quot;before the game&quot; is an adnominal adjunct.
::very happy – &quot;very&quot; is an &quot;adadjectival&quot; adjunct.
::too loudly – &quot;too&quot; is an &quot;adadverbial&quot; adjunct.

Adjuncts are always constituents. Each of the adjuncts in the examples throughout this article is a constituent.

==Semantic function==
Adjuncts can be categorized in terms of the functional meaning that they contribute to the phrase, clause, or sentence in which they appear. The following list of the semantic functions is by no means exhaustive, but it does include most of the semantic functions of adjuncts identified in the literature on adjuncts:

::Causal – Causal adjuncts establish the reason for, or purpose of, an action or state.
::*The ladder collapsed because it was old. (reason)

::Concessive – Concessive adjuncts establish contrary circumstances.
::*Lorna went out although it was raining.

::Conditional – Conditional adjuncts establish the condition in which an action occurs or state holds.
::*I would go to Paris, if I had the money.

::Consecutive – Consecutive adjuncts establish an effect or result.
::*It rained so hard that the streets flooded.

::Final – Final adjuncts establish the goal of an action (what one wants to accomplish).
::*He works a lot to earn money for school.

::Instrumental – Instrumental adjuncts establish the instrument used to accomplish an action.
::*Mr. Bibby wrote the letter with a pencil.

::Locative – Locative adjuncts establish where, to where, or from where a state or action happened or existed.
::*She sat on the table.

::Measure – Measure adjuncts establish the measure of the action, state, or quality that they modify
::*I am completely finished.
::*That is mostly true.
::*We want to stay in part.

::Modal – Modal adjuncts establish the extent to which the speaker views the action or state as (im)probable.
::*They probably left.
::*In any case, we didn&#x27;t do it.
::*That is perhaps possible.
::*I&#x27;m definitely going to the party.

::Modificative – Modificative adjuncts establish how the action happened or the state existed.
::*He ran with difficulty. (manner)
::*He stood in silence. (state)
::*He helped me with my homework. (limiting)

::Temporal – Temporal adjuncts establish when, how long, or how frequent the action or state happened or existed.
::*He arrived yesterday. (time point)
::*He stayed for two weeks. (duration)
::*She drinks in that bar every day. (frequency)

==Distinguishing between predicative expressions, arguments, and adjuncts==

===Omission diagnostic===
The distinction between arguments and adjuncts and predicates is central to most theories of syntax and grammar. Predicates take arguments and they permit (certain) adjuncts. The arguments of a predicate are necessary to complete the meaning of the predicate. The adjuncts of a predicate, in contrast, provide auxiliary information about the core predicate-argument meaning, which means they are not necessary to complete the meaning of the predicate. Adjuncts and arguments can be identified using various diagnostics. The omission diagnostic, for instance, helps identify many arguments and thus many possible adjuncts as well. If a given constituent cannot be omitted from a sentence, clause, or phrase without resulting in an unacceptable expression, that constituent is not an adjunct. In contrast, if a given constituent can be omitted without affecting grammaticality or core meaning, that constituent is an adjunct.
E.g.:

::a. Fred certainly knows.
::b. Fred knows. – &quot;certainly&quot; may be an adjunct (and it is).

::a. He stayed after class.
::b. He stayed. – &quot;after class&quot; may be an adjunct (and it is).

::a. I know her.
::b. I know. - the sentence is acceptable, but its meaning is changed entirely. Therefore &quot;her&quot; is not an adjunct.

::a. She trimmed the bushes.
::b. *She trimmed. – &quot;the bushes&quot; is not an adjunct.

::a. Jim stopped.
::b. *Stopped. – &quot;Jim&quot; is not an adjunct.

===Other diagnostics===
Further diagnostics used to distinguish between arguments and adjuncts include multiplicity, distance from head, and the ability to coordinate. A head can have multiple adjuncts but only one object argument (=complement):

::a. Bob ate the pizza. – &quot;the pizza&quot; is an object argument (=complement).
::b. Bob ate the pizza and the hamburger. &quot;the pizza and the hamburger&quot; is a noun phrase that functions as object argument.
::c. Bob ate the pizza with a fork. – &quot;with a fork&quot; is an adjunct.
::d. Bob ate the pizza with a fork on Tuesday. – &quot;with a fork&quot; and &quot;on Tuesday&quot; are both adjuncts.

Object arguments are typically closer to their head than adjuncts:

::a. the collection of figurines (complement) in the dining room (adjunct)
::b. *the collection in the dining room (adjunct) of figurines (complement)

Adjuncts can be coordinated with other adjuncts, but not with arguments:

::a. *Bob ate the pizza and with a fork.
::b. Bob ate with a fork and with a spoon.

===Optional arguments vs. adjuncts===
The distinction between arguments and adjuncts is much less clear than the simple omission diagnostic (and the other diagnostics) suggests. Most accounts of the argument vs. adjunct distinction acknowledge a further division. One distinguishes between obligatory and optional arguments. Optional arguments pattern like adjuncts when just the omission diagnostic is employed, e.g.

::a. Fred ate a hamburger.
::b. Fred ate. – &quot;a hamburger&quot; is not an obligatory argument, but it could be (and it is) an optional argument.

::a. Sam helped us.
::b. Sam helped – &quot;us&quot; is not an obligatory argument, but it could be (and it is) an optional argument.

The existence of optional arguments blurs the line between arguments and adjuncts considerably. Further diagnostics (beyond the omission diagnostic and the others mentioned above) must be employed to distinguish between adjuncts and optional arguments. One such diagnostic is the relative clause test. The test constituent is moved from the matrix clause to a subordinate relative clause containing &quot;which occurred/happened&quot;. If the result is unacceptable, the test constituent is probably not an adjunct:

::a. Fred ate a hamburger.
::b. Fred ate. – &quot;a hamburger&quot; is not an obligatory argument.
::c. *Fred ate, which occurred a hamburger. – &quot;a hamburger&quot; is not an adjunct, which means it must be an optional argument.

::a. Sam helped us.
::b. Sam helped. – &quot;us&quot; is not an obligatory argument.
::c. *Sam helped, which occurred us. – &quot;us&quot; is not an adjunct, which means it must be an optional argument.

The particular merit of the relative clause test is its ability to distinguish between many argument and adjunct PPs, e.g.

::a. We are working on the problem.
::b. We are working.
::c. *We are working, which is occurring on the problem. – &quot;on the problem&quot; is an optional argument.

::a. They spoke to the class.
::b. They spoke.
::c. *They spoke, which occurred to the class. – &quot;to the class&quot; is an optional argument.

The reliability of the relative clause diagnostic is actually limited. For instance, it incorrectly suggests that many modal and manner adjuncts are arguments. This fact bears witness to the difficulty of providing an absolute diagnostic for the distinctions currently being examined. Despite the difficulties, most theories of syntax and grammar distinguish on the one hand between arguments and adjuncts and on the other hand between optional arguments and adjuncts, and they grant a central position to these divisions in the overarching theory.

==Predicates vs. adjuncts==
Many phrases have the outward appearance of an adjunct but are in fact (part of) a predicate instead. The confusion occurs often with copular verbs, in particular with a form of &quot;be&quot;, e.g.

::It is under the bush.
::The party is at seven o&#x27;clock.

The PPs in these sentences neither adjuncts nor arguments. The preposition in each case is, rather, part of the main predicate. The matrix predicate in the first sentence is &quot;is under&quot;; this predicate takes the two arguments &quot;It&quot; and &quot;the bush&quot;. Similarly, the matrix predicate in the second sentence is &quot;is at&quot;; this predicate takes the two arguments &quot;The party&quot; and &quot;seven o&#x27;clock&quot;. Distinguishing between predicates, arguments, and adjuncts becomes particularly difficult when secondary predicates are involved, for instance with resultative predicates, e.g.

::That made him tired.

The resultative adjective &quot;tired&quot; can be viewed as an argument of the matrix predicate &quot;made&quot;. But it is also definitely a predicate over &quot;him&quot;. Such examples illustrate that distinguishing predicates, arguments, and adjuncts can become difficult and there are many cases where a given expression functions in more ways than one.

===Overview===
The following overview is a breakdown of the current divisions:

This overview acknowledges three types of entities: predicates, arguments, and adjuncts, whereby arguments are further divided into obligatory and optional ones.

==Representing adjuncts==
Many theories of syntax and grammar employ trees to represent the structure of sentences. Various conventions are used to distinguish between arguments and adjuncts in these trees. In phrase structure grammars, many adjuncts are distinguished from arguments insofar as the adjuncts of a head predicate will appear higher in the structure than the object argument(s) of that predicate. The adjunct is adjoined to a projection of the head predicate above and to the right of the object argument, e.g.

The object argument each time is identified insofar as it is a sister of V that appears to the right of V, and the adjunct status of the adverb &quot;early&quot; and the PP &quot;before class&quot; is seen in the higher position to the right of and above the object argument. Other adjuncts, in contrast, are assumed to adjoin to a position that is between the subject argument and the head predicate or above and to the left of the subject argument, e.g.

The subject is identified as an argument insofar as it appears as a sister and to the left of V(P). The modal adverb &quot;certainly&quot; is shown as an adjunct insofar as it adjoins to an intermediate projection of V or to a projection of S.
In X-bar theory, adjuncts are represented as elements that are sisters to X&#x27; levels and daughters of X&#x27; level [X&#x27; adjunct [X&#x27;...]].

Theories that assume sentence structure to be less layered than the analyses just given sometimes employ a special convention to distinguish adjuncts from arguments. Some dependency grammars, for instance, use an arrow dependency edge to mark adjuncts, e.g.

The arrow dependency edge points away from the adjunct toward the governor of the adjunct. The arrows identify six adjuncts: &quot;Yesterday&quot;, &quot;probably&quot;, &quot;many times&quot;, &quot;very&quot;, &quot;very long&quot;, and &quot;that you like&quot;. The standard, non-arrow dependency edges identify &quot;Sam&quot;, &quot;Susan&quot;, &quot;that very long story that you like&quot;, etc. as arguments (of one of the predicates in the sentence).

<doc id="366221" wikidata="Q1937043" url="?curid=366221" title="Pomeranians (tribe)">
<text>The Pomeranians (; ; ), first mentioned as such in the 10th century, were a West Slavic tribe, which from the 5th to the 6th centuries had settled at the shore of the Baltic Sea between the mouths of the Oder and Vistula Rivers (the latter Farther Pomerania and Pomerelia). They spoke the Pomeranian language that belonged to the Lechitic languages, a branch of the West Slavic language family.

The name &quot;Pomerania&quot; has its origin in the Old Polish &quot;po more&quot;, which means &quot;Land at the Sea&quot;.

== Prehistory ==
Following the exit of the Hamburgian hunters, the area was inhabited successively by Celts and the Wielbark Culture (Germanic tribes similar to the Goths and the Rugians). Groups of Slavs populated the area as a result of the Slavic migration. The Pomeranian tribes formed around the 6th century. There was also a Pomeranian culture, which was replaced by the Jastorf culture. 

From around the 6th century, West Slavic tribes migrated via the Vistula and Oder Rivers into the southern Baltics, where sizable settlements of Vikings and Danes and large trading centers thrived, such as Jomsburg at the mouth of the Oder and Danzig at the mouth of the Vistula and possibly Baltic settlement centres between the Parsęta and the Vistula. According to the 12th-century &quot;Nestor Chronicle&quot;, the Pomeranians, as well as Poles, Masovians and Lusitanians originated from the tribe of the Lechites.

=== 10th to 12th centuries ===
By 967, Duke Mieszko I had after a decisive battle against the Wolinians, led by Wichmann the Younger, and gained full control over the lands between the Vistula and the mouth of the Oder. The earliest known documented use of the term Pomorie dates to 997 in reference to the Duke of Pomorie.

The Piast dukes of Poland began to incorporate the Pomeranians into their realm and succeeded initially. In 1005, Polish Duke Bolesław I the Brave loses control over the area. In the Annales Altahenses, a &quot;Zemuzil Bomerianorum&quot; is mentioned as the first duke known by name in 1064.

During the 12th century, the pagan Pomeranians faced continuous incursions by their expanding Christian neighbours of Denmark, Poland and the Saxon dukes of the Holy Roman Empire. In 1121, they were eventually subdued by Polish Duke Bolesław III Wrymouth, who established a diocese with its seat at Kołobrzeg, where Reinbern became the first bishop. Pomerania was Christianized with the help of the German missionary Otto of Bamberg.

At the same time the Pomeranian Prince Wartislaw I conquered the former Lutici lands west of the Oder. After his successors from the House of Griffins were defeated by the Saxons at the 1164 Battle of Verchen, they accepted the overlordship of Duke Henry the Lion. The Pomeranian lands were eventually divided, with the Western parts entering the Holy Roman Empire as the Duchy of Pomerania in 1181, and the Eastern part consisting of Pomerelia under the Samborides coming under the influence of Poland and, from 1309 onwards, the Teutonic Order.

The influx of settlers from the Holy Roman Empire during the Ostsiedlung caused the Germanization of Pomerania, as many native Pomeranians were slowly and gradually assimilated and discontinued the use of their Slavic language and culture. 

The direct descendants of the Pomeranians include:

* Kashubians, who speak the Kashubian language
* Slovincians
* Kociewiacy
* Borowiacy
* Western Pomeranians, who speak Low German or Standard German
* Eastern Pomeranians, who were expelled from Pomerania in 1945 and settled in various parts of Germany and now speak either local dialects or Standard German.

<text>Anchor Exchange is an underground telephone switching system and former hardened telephone exchange built in Birmingham, England.

==History==
Construction commenced in 1953 under the guise of building an underground railway. It opened in September 1957 at a cost of £4 million. It was located nominally on Newhall Street. However its network of tunnels extended from at least the Jewellery Quarter to Southside.

It originally formed one of a network of 18 zone switching centres within the UK telephone system that provided trunk switching facilities within its own charge group and to group switching centres (GSC) within an area broadly comprising the West Midlands and central Wales. The exchange formed part of the trunk mechanisation plan commenced in 1939 to permit operators from originating GSCs to dial through to a distant UK subscriber without requiring further operator intervention. Later, it was additionally used to switch subscriber dialled trunk calls after its introduction at Bristol in 1958.

It was subsequently augmented and superseded by a transit switching centre (TSC) equipped with a crossbar switching system (TXK4) which formed part of the transit network. It parented two of the first three GSCs at Worcester and Wolverhampton to go live when the transit network was inaugurated in 1971 which eventually provided universal UK automatic subscriber dialling and was completed in 1979.

The Anchor telephone exchange tunnels are still used to house communication cables. They have been updated with firebreak compartments and hazardous asbestos has been removed. They are continually pumped out because of the city&#x27;s rising water table.

The exchange took its name from the hallmark of Birmingham Assay Office, which depicts an anchor.

==Nuclear bunker==
The exchange was one of three, along with the Kingsway Exchange in London and the Guardian Exchange in Manchester, which provided hardened facilities in order to protect communications in the event of a nuclear attack during the Cold War in the UK (a fourth one was rumoured to exist in Glasgow, but no evidence of this has been found).
In common with most civil defence structures of the time it was designed to withstand an attack by an atomic bomb short of a direct hit. By the time of its completion in 1957, the development of thermonuclear weapons with their significantly increased explosive power, would have reduced the ability to resist an attack.

The public was told that the project was to provide the city with a new underground rail network, but that by 1956 the project was no longer needed due to costs. There was an entrance at the rear of Telephone House, between Lionel Street and Fleet Street, where there was a strict security check upon entering; this entrance had a heavy blast door weighing about two tonnes. Another entrance was on Newhall Street.

<doc id="366227" wikidata="Q1454851" url="?curid=366227" title="Gloriosa (plant)">
<text>Gloriosa is a genus of 12 species in the plant family Colchicaceae, and includes the formerly recognised genus &quot;Littonia&quot;. They are native in tropical and southern Africa to Asia, and naturalised in Australia and the Pacific as well as being widely cultivated. The most common English names are flame lily, fire lily, gloriosa lily, glory lily, superb lily, climbing lily, and creeping lily.

They are tender, tuberous rooted deciduous perennials, adapted to monsoon rainfall with a dormant dry season. All parts of the plant contain colchicine and related alkaloids and are therefore dangerously toxic if ingested, and contact with the stems and leaves can cause skin irritation. Various preparations of the plant are used in traditional medicines for a variety of complaints in both Africa and India. Plants have leaf tip tendrils.

== Description ==
&quot;Gloriosa&quot; are herbaceous perennials that climb or scramble over other plants with the aid of tendrils at the ends of their leaves and can reach 3 meters in height. They have showy flowers, many with distinctive and pronouncedly reflexed petals, like a Turk&#x27;s cap lily, ranging in colour from a greenish-yellow through yellow, orange, red and sometimes even a deep pinkish-red.

&quot;Scandent herbs, the rootstock a horizontal rhizome, the stem leafy, the leaves spirally arranged or subopposite, the upper ones with cirrhose tips; flowers solitary, large, borne on long, spreading pedicels, actinomorphic, hermaphrodite; perianth segments 6, free, lanceolate, keeled within at base, long-persistent; stamens 6, hypogynous, the anthers extrorse, medifixed and versatile, opening by longitudinal slits; ovary superior, 3-celled, the carpels cohering only by their inner margins, the ovules numerous, the style deflected at base and projecting from the flower more or less horizontally; fruit a loculicidal capsule with many seeds&quot;

== Species ==
, the World Checklist of Selected Plant Families accepted 11 species of &quot;Gloriosa&quot;, ignoring hybrids, varieties and cultivars. Many other names are currently rejected as synonyms or unresolved for lack of sufficient data.


== Distribution ==
The genus is widely distributed in Africa, the Arabian Peninsula, and from the Indian subcontinent to Malesia. &quot;Gloriosa superba&quot; in particular is widely naturalized. In Australia, &quot;scattered naturalized populations exist in the understorey of coastal dry sclerophyll forest and sand dune vegetation throughout south-east Queensland and New South Wales&quot;. It is considered a rampant and dangerous invasive weed in Australia, dominating the coastal dunes at the expense of native species and leading to deaths of native animals and birds when ingested.

In India, &quot;Gloriosa&quot; is distributed in the Western Ghats but the density is rapidly decreasing due to excessive uprooting by herbal medicine producers.

== Propagation ==
&quot;Propagation generally occurs from seeds, although mature plants can be divided and grown from tubers. The hard seeds can remain dormant for 6-9 months.&quot; Growth stops if temperatures are of the order of and the plant dies when subjected to during this time. La Gloriosa is an extremely fragile and delicate flower, tough to cultivate.

== Toxicology ==
All parts of &quot;Gloriosa&quot; contain colchicine, the roots and seeds are especially rich. The lethal dose of colchicine is about 6 mg/kg, and &quot;Gloriosa superba&quot; has been used as a means of committing suicide.

==Symbolism==

&quot;Gloriosa superba&quot; is the national flower of Zimbabwe (where it is a protected plant). A diamond brooch in the shape of the flame lily was a gift from Southern Rhodesia (modern day Zimbabwe) to Queen Elizabeth II on a visit in 1947 while she was still the crown princess. The flame lily was used on the regimental colours of the Rhodesian Light Infantry, this was unique to the Rhodesian Light Infantry as it was the only regiment in the British Empire to not have a wreath of thistles or roses.

It is also the state flower of Tamil Nadu state in India.
It is also considered the national flower of Tamil Eelam, a former de facto inside Republic of Sri Lanka.

<doc id="366228" wikidata="Q335254" url="?curid=366228" title="John Jervis, 1st Earl of St Vincent">
<text>Admiral of the Fleet John Jervis, 1st Earl of St Vincent (9 January 1735 – 13 March 1823) was a Royal Navy officer and politician. Jervis served throughout the latter half of the 18th century and into the 19th, and was an active commander during the Seven Years&#x27; War, American War of Independence and the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars. He is best known for his victory at the 1797 Battle of Cape St. Vincent, from which he earned his titles, and as a patron of Horatio Nelson.

Jervis was also recognised by both political and military contemporaries as a fine administrator and naval reformer. As Commander-in-chief of the Mediterranean, between 1795 and 1799 he introduced a series of severe standing orders to avert mutiny. He applied those orders to both seamen and officers alike, a policy that made him a controversial figure. He took his disciplinarian system of command with him when he took command of the Channel Fleet in 1799. In 1801, as First Lord of the Admiralty, he introduced a number of reforms that, though unpopular at the time, made the Navy more efficient and more self-sufficient. He introduced innovations, including block making machinery at Portsmouth Royal Dockyard. St Vincent was known for his generosity to officers he considered worthy of reward, and his swift and often harsh punishment of those he felt deserved it.

Jervis&#x27; entry in the &quot;Oxford Dictionary of National Biography&quot; by P. K. Crimmin describes his contribution to history: &quot;His importance lies in his being the organiser of victories; the creator of well-equipped, highly efficient fleets; and in training a school of officers as professional, energetic, and devoted to the service as himself.&quot;

==Early life==
John Jervis was born in Meaford Hall, Staffordshire, on 9 January 1735, the second son of Swynfen and Elizabeth Jervis. His father was a barrister, counsellor to the Admiralty Board and auditor of Greenwich Hospital.&lt;ref name=&quot;NC02/1&quot;&gt;&quot;The Naval Chronicle&quot; Vol. 4, pp. 2–3.&lt;/ref&gt; Swynfen Jervis intended that his son should follow him to the bar. The young Jervis was educated at Burton Grammar School and subsequently at Reverend Swinden&#x27;s Academy in Greenwich, London.

Their family name Jervis is pronounced .

==Early naval career==
At the age of thirteen, Jervis ran away and joined the navy at Woolwich, London. After a short time he returned home as he had heard his family were very upset at his disappearance. Lady Jane Hamilton (mother of Sir William Hamilton) and Lady Burlington became aware of Jervis&#x27; desire to join the navy and lobbied his family on his behalf. Eventually, they introduced the Jervis family to Admiral George Townshend, who agreed to take the boy aboard one of his ships.

On 4 January 1749, Jervis entered the navy as an able seaman aboard the 50-gun on her way to Jamaica. On arrival in the West Indies, Jervis was assigned to the sloop on the Mosquito Coast, where he saw constant service against Spanish guarda-costas and privateers.

When Townshend quit the West Indies, he discharged Jervis into the under Admiral Thomas Cotes. Cotes&#x27; flag captain Henry Dennis rated Jervis as a midshipman. On 31 July 1754, Jervis was transferred to the 24-gun . Jervis commented in a letter to his sister: &quot;my chief employ when from my duty is reading studying navigation and perusing my old letters, of which I have almost enough to make an octavo volume.&quot;

While in Jamaica, the young Jervis drew funds against his father&#x27;s account with a local banker. When the reply came from England that the withdrawal could not be honoured, the midshipman found himself in debt. Jervis was forced to quit his officer&#x27;s mess and live as a common sailor until enough money was collected to pay off the loan. The event deeply affected the young Jervis, who swore never to &quot;draw another bill without the certainty of it being paid&quot;.

&quot;Sphinx&quot; was paid off at Spithead on 7 November 1754. Jervis was assigned to the 20-gun HMS &quot;Seaford&quot; in December of the same year, and then from the end of December until February 1755 underwent further instruction onboard HM Yacht &quot;William and Mary&quot; under the navigational expert Captain John Campbell.

Jervis passed his lieutenant&#x27;s examination on 2 January 1755 and was assigned as sixth lieutenant to the first-rate of 100 guns. By March, he had moved to third lieutenant of the 60-gun . While serving on &quot;Nottingham&quot;, he participated in an attempt by the fleet of Admiral Edward Boscawen to prevent French reinforcements from reaching New France.

On 31 March 1756, Jervis moved to the 74-gun HMS and on 22 June he was promoted to be fourth lieutenant of the 90-gun &quot;Prince&quot; under Captain Charles Saunders in the Mediterranean. When the captain was promoted to admiral, Jervis was assigned as one of his officers aboard the 74-gun in November 1756. By that time the Seven Years&#x27; War between Great Britain and France had begun.

In January 1757 Jervis was promoted to temporary command of HMS &quot;Experiment&quot; after her captain was incapacitated by sickness. As commander, he fought a larger French privateer in an indecisive action off Cape Gata. When the captain of the &quot;Experiment&quot; regained his health, Jervis moved back to &quot;Culloden&quot;.

In June 1757, he followed Saunders to the 90-gun HMS &quot;St George&quot;. Jervis returned to England in temporary command of the 80-gun , a ship that had been captured by Henry Osborn&#x27;s fleet at the Battle of Cartagena. He followed Saunders once more when the admiral was promoted to command the North American station; Jervis was promoted to first lieutenant of HMS &quot;Prince&quot;.

===Quebec and promotion to captain===
The fleet, part of an expedition to capture the French possessions in North America, left England in February 1759. They stopped first at Louisbourg, which had been captured from the French the previous year. By June, the ice along the Saint Lawrence River had broken up and the fleet along with the military transports headed up river to the assault of Quebec City.

On 15 May 1759, Jervis had been promoted acting commander of the sloop . In this command Jervis impressed General James Wolfe in the preparations that led to the Battle of the Plains of Abraham. &quot;Porcupine&quot; and the frigate led the armed transports past Quebec to land up river. One biographer, Jedediah Tucker, notes that as the approach was so critical, both Wolfe and the subsequently famous James Cook boarded &quot;Porcupine&quot; to ensure the success of the mission.

For his efforts Jervis was promoted commander and took command of . Jervis returned to England in September but immediately returned to North America in command of the &quot;Albany&quot;. In May 1760 Jervis was attached to Admiral Sir George Rodney&#x27;s Channel squadron.

In October 1760 he was made post-captain in command of the 44-gun . &quot;Gosport&quot; had on board a young midshipman, George Elphinstone, later Viscount Keith, who took over Jervis&#x27; command in the Mediterranean after Jervis&#x27; departure in 1799. In 1762, HMS &quot;Gosport&quot;, and under Captain Joshua Rowley, convoyed the East and West Indian trade to the westward, and successfully protected it from the squadron of Commodore de Ternay.

By the end of 1763, with the end of the Seven Years&#x27; War, &quot;Gosport&quot; had been paid off and Jervis remained unemployed until February 1769, when he was appointed to the 32-gun , the first coppered warship in the Royal Navy. He was tasked with delivering bullion to British merchants in Genoa. During his time in Genoa, two Ottoman galley slaves escaped from a Genoese navy galley and hid aboard one of &quot;Alarm&quot; boats. They were forcibly removed by Genoese authorities, to which Jervis made an official protest and promised retaliation if they were not handed over. Both were produced and Jervis took custody of them.

On 30 March 1770 &quot;Alarm&quot; was driven ashore off Marseilles, but with the efforts of Jervis, the crew and the local French authorities under the governor of Marseilles, Georges René Le Peley de Pléville she was brought off and repaired. Jervis personally returned to Marseilles with a letter of thanks from the Board of the Admiralty to the governor for his assistance.

In 1771 &quot;Alarm&quot; returned to England to collect the Duke of Gloucester, King George III&#x27;s brother, in order that he could winter in Italy. He lived aboard with his entourage until May 1772, when &quot;Alarm&quot; returned to England and was paid off.

===Touring Europe and Russia===
Between October 1772 and June 1775, Jervis travelled extensively. He began in France, where he studied the language and made observations about French life. He accompanied Captain Samuel Barrington to Russia where they spent time in Saint Petersburg and inspected the arsenal and dockyards at Kronstadt and took a tour of the yacht designed by Sir Charles Knowles for Catherine of Russia.

The pair continued on to Sweden, Denmark and northern Germany. All the while Jervis made notes on defences, harbour charts and safe anchorages. They came home via the Netherlands, Jervis once again making extensive studies of the area and taking copious notes describing any useful information. He and Barrington then took a private cruise along the Channel coast, calling at various harbours, including Brest, making and improving their charts as they went. When Jervis later became the Commander-in-Chief of the Channel Fleet he was aided significantly in his blockade of Brest by these charts. In later years, he commented: &quot;Had the young Captain Jervis not performed such a complete survey of this port then the Earl St Vincent would not have been able to effect such a thorough blockade of it.&quot;

==American War of Independence==

===First Battle of Ushant===

At the outbreak of the American War of Independence in 1775 Jervis was given the command of ; however, she was surveyed by the dockyard and found unfit for service. He was therefore appointed instead to command of HMS &quot;Foudroyant&quot;, the ship he had brought to England as a prize seventeen years earlier.

For the first few years of the war, the French supplied arms, funding, and military advice on an informal and limited basis to the newly emerging nation of America. With the signing of the Treaty of Alliance in 1778 and the creation of the Franco-American alliance, the war widened.

Jervis spent the first few years of the war patrolling the Channel in &quot;Foudroyant&quot; without seeing any significant action, but as the war reached Europe Jervis was placed under the command of Admiral Augustus Keppel. The Channel fleet, under Keppel, sighted the French fleet intending to enter Brest on 23 July. The British fleet of 30 ships of the line chased the French fleet of 29 ships and engaged them on 27 July in what became known as the First Battle of Ushant. The battle was indecisive and in the political aftermath Jervis provided a stalwart defence of Admiral Keppel at the latter&#x27;s court-martial, helping to secure Keppel&#x27;s acquittal.

===Relieving Gibraltar and capture of &quot;Pégase&quot;===

Jervis remained in &quot;Foudroyant&quot; attached to the Channel Fleet and for a short time acted as flag captain to Admiral Molyneux Shuldham. In 1780 Jervis was with Admiral Rodney when the British fleet relieved Gibraltar. In 1781 he was with Admiral George Darby at the second relief of Gibraltar.

On 19 April 1782 Jervis was with his old friend and travelling companion when a ship in Admiral Barrington&#x27;s squadron sighted a French convoy leaving Brest. The squadron gave chase and &quot;Foudroyant&quot; caught and engaged the French 74-gun . After an engagement of more than an hour &quot;Pégase&quot; struck. Jervis himself was wounded in the attack. For his services he was invested as a Knight of the Bath on 19 May 1782.

He was again at the relief of Gibraltar with Earl Howe&#x27;s fleet in 1782 and took part in the indecisive Battle of Cape Spartel. Jervis was promoted commodore and hoisted his broad pennant in the 50-gun in December 1782, with orders to proceed to the West Indies. Due to the peace negotiations his orders were rescinded and he struck his pennant on 14 January 1783.

==Marriage and political office==
During the peace Jervis married his cousin Martha, daughter of Lord Chief Baron Sir Thomas Parker. Jervis was also returned as MP for Launceston in 1783. Jervis began his political career in earnest and voted for Pitt&#x27;s parliamentary reforms and against Charles James Fox and his East India Bill.

During the elections of 1784 Jervis stood for election in the independent borough of Great Yarmouth, where he was returned as MP alongside Henry Beaufoy. Jervis then voted against Pitt&#x27;s further bills for reform but supported him once more during the 1788–1789 Regency Crisis.

On 24 September 1787 Jervis was promoted rear-admiral of the blue and hoisted his flag in the 74-gun &quot;Carnatic&quot; for several months during the tensions arising from the Prussian invasion of the Netherlands.

In 1790 Jervis was recalled to service once more and moved his flag to the second-rate &quot;Prince&quot; during the Nootka Sound crisis that threatened war between England and Spain. Also in 1790 Jervis was promoted rear-admiral of the white and stood down as MP for Great Yarmouth and stood instead for the Chipping Wycombe seat, to which he was returned as MP alongside the Earl Wycombe.

With his interest in politics wavering he spoke rarely and then almost exclusively on naval matters. In 1792 Jervis proposed a scheme to alleviate the financial hardship of seamen. He later withdrew the proposal as Viscount Melville promised that the matter would be addressed by the Admiralty Board. In 1794 he resigned his seat and did not stand again for political office.

==French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars==
Jervis was promoted Vice-Admiral of the Blue and was appointed as Commander-in-Chief, Leeward Islands. Jervis took with him an army that, combined with the navy, formed a joint military expedition. The goal of the expedition was to capture French colonies and thereby weaken France&#x27;s international trade. The army commander was Sir Charles Grey, a friend and political ally.

Jervis hoisted his flag in . He took Grey&#x27;s son, Captain George Grey, as his flag-captain. The combined forces captured the French colonies of Martinique, Guadeloupe and Saint Lucia and restored monarchist rule.

The French counter-attacked and recaptured Guadeloupe on 2 June 1794. Jervis and Grey landed a force to recapture the island but were repulsed by the reinforced French garrison and the British expedition withdrew.

In November 1794 Admiral Benjamin Caldwell replaced Jervis. Disputes over prize money were widely held as the reason that Jervis and Grey were not awarded peerages for their service. The prize money for the capture of the three islands, when finally calculated, amounted to £70,000 that was due to the officers and men of the navy. If adjusted for inflation this would equal approximately £ as of .

Grey and Jervis&#x27; enemies proposed a vote of censure against the general and admiral. The vote itself was negative. Jervis and Grey were however awarded the thanks of both Houses of Parliament for their services. On 12 April 1794 Jervis was promoted vice-admiral of the white.

===Command of the Mediterranean Fleet===

Jervis was promoted admiral of the blue on 1 June 1795 and appointed to command the Mediterranean Fleet. &quot;Boyne&quot; had caught fire on 1 May 1795 and had blown up in Spithead, the result of an accident, and Jervis lost almost all of his possessions.

Jervis went to take command of the Mediterranean fleet in the frigate and once more took Charles Grey&#x27;s son, Captain George Grey, as his flag-captain. Jervis also took Robert Calder as his captain of the fleet.

On arrival at Gibraltar Jervis took as his flagship. Among Jervis&#x27; subordinates were Captains Horatio Nelson, Cuthbert Collingwood, and Thomas Troubridge.

Jervis began a close blockade of Toulon and Nelson was assigned the task of aiding the Austrian army along the Italian coast. By September 1796 the British presence in the Mediterranean had become untenable. Napoleon had beaten Britain&#x27;s Austrian allies, who were in disarray, and in October, Spain surrendered and allied themselves to the French.

Jervis recalled Admiral Robert Mann to aid in the blockade of Cadiz. Mann took his ships instead to Spithead. Jervis abandoned Corsica between September and November 1796 and withdrew his forces to Gibraltar.

====Battle of Cape St. Vincent====

A Spanish fleet made up of twenty-four line-of-battle ships and seven frigates sailed from Toulon on 1 February 1797. Jervis&#x27; fleet of ten ships-of-the-line was patrolling off Cape Saint Vincent and was subsequently joined by five more under Sir William Parker. The Spanish admiral, José de Córdoba, had taken his ships into the Atlantic to weather a storm and was making his way to Cadiz when the two fleets caught sight of each other at dawn on 14 February 1797.

The British fleet had fifteen line-of-battle ships against the twenty-four Spanish ships. On the quarterdeck of &quot;Victory&quot;, Jervis and his flag captain, Robert Calder, counted the ships. It was at this point Jervis discovered that he was outnumbered nearly two-to-one:
&quot;There are eight sail of the line, Sir John&quot;
&quot;Very well, sir&quot;
&quot;There are twenty sail of the line, Sir John&quot;
&quot;Very well, sir&quot;
&quot;There are twenty five sail of the line, Sir John&quot;
&quot;Very well, sir&quot;
&quot;There are twenty seven sail of the line, Sir John&quot;
&quot;Enough, sir, no more of that; the die is cast, and if there are fifty sail I will go through them.&quot; A passenger aboard &quot;Victory&quot;, Captain Benjamin Hallowell, achieved a brief notoriety for slapping the admiral on the back and calling out &quot;That&#x27;s right Sir John, that&#x27;s right. By God, we shall give them a damned good licking!&quot; 

During the battle Nelson, in command of , wore out of line and performed a stunning feat by capturing two of the enemy vessels within moments. Nelson and his crew boarded and captured one and crossed her deck and boarded and captured the second, which had collided in the smoke and general melee of the battle. The move was later feted by the public and press and dubbed &quot;&quot;Nelson&#x27;s patent bridge for boarding first-rates&quot;.&quot;

When the Spanish retreated Jervis did not press his advantage but consolidated his victory and began the lengthy job of repairing his ships and restoring their crews. The British had suffered casualties of 73 killed and 227 wounded.

Sir John did not mention Nelson&#x27;s achievement in his initial despatch to the Admiralty despite Nelson&#x27;s obvious contribution to the success of the battle. In later despatches Jervis did mention Nelson. In one anecdote, when discussing the battle with his flag-captain, Sir Robert, who had been mentioned in the despatch and had been awarded a knighthood for his services, brought up the issue of Nelson&#x27;s disobedience of the admiral&#x27;s orders for having worn out of the line of battle in order to engage the enemy. Jervis silenced him by saying: &quot;It certainly was so, and if you ever commit such a breach of your orders, I will forgive you also.&quot;

Despite the capture of only four vessels, the Battle of Cape Saint Vincent became celebrated as an outstanding victory and the awards and recognition far outweighed the achievement. The bad news of the evacuation of the Mediterranean, the capitulation of the Spanish and the Italian city-states and the defeat of the Austrian army, alongside the increasing threat of a French invasion of Britain, had depressed the politicians and general public. A victory, such as that of Cape Saint Vincent, was more important for the morale of the country as a whole than its military ramifications.

Both Jervis and Nelson were hailed as heroes and Jervis was made Baron Jervis of Meaford and Earl St Vincent. Songs were written about Jervis and the battle, and there was a general feeling of relief in both the government and people of Britain. Nelson for his services was invested as a Knight of the Bath. The now Earl St Vincent was granted a pension for life of £3,000 per year. The City of London had already presented him with the Freedom of the City in a gold box valued at 100 guineas for his success in the West Indies and for this battle awarded him a presentation sword. The presentation box and sword are both currently held at the National Maritime Museum, Greenwich.

Nelson was also awarded his freedom of the City of London for the Battle of Cape St. Vincent, and was later to get a presentation sword for the Nile. The sword awarded to Jervis was the first of its kind that the City of London issued. St Vincent was awarded the thanks of both Houses of Parliament and given a gold medal by the King.

The &quot;London Gazette&quot; published an advertisement in 1798 regarding the prize money that was due to the officers and men who had fought at the battle. The sum quoted was £140,000, in inflationary terms this would be approximately £ million as of , of which, as admiral, Jervis was entitled to a sizeable share. Jervis resumed his blockade of the Spanish fleet in Cadiz.

====Mutiny and discipline====
During 1797 there was considerable discontent among the seamen of the Royal Navy. This discontent manifested itself at the Nore and at Spithead when the greater part of the Channel Fleet rose up against their officers.

These mutinies were not overly violent and the officers were put ashore and the heads of the mutinies established their own order and kept the ships under &quot;committee&quot; control until their collective demands were met. The mutineers&#x27; demands ranged from discontent at cruel officers to poor pay and long sea service without shore leave.

There were other mutinies throughout the Navy that year, most notably and , both on the Jamaica station. These mutinies resulted in the crews killing their officers and taking their ships into enemy-held ports.

Jervis had the reputation as a disciplinarian and put in place a new system that would ensure that the men in the Mediterranean fleet did not mutiny. To begin with the admiral wrote a new set of standing orders. For example, Jervis divided the seamen and marines and berthed the two separately, putting the marines between the officers aft and the men forward. Thus he created an effective barrier between officers and potentially unruly crews.

Jervis discouraged conversation in Irish, though he did not ban it. He ordered the marine detachments to be paraded every morning and, if there was a band available, for &quot;God Save the King&quot; to be played. The marine detachment was then to remain armed at all times. Marines and soldiers were also excused from duties in regard to the general running of the ship.

In order to keep his crews active and to ensure that the Spanish did not perceive that there might be discontent in the fleet, Jervis ordered the nightly bombardment of Cadiz in his own words to &quot;Divert the animal.&quot;

The admiral isolated the ships from one another to minimise collusion and the opportunities the men might have to band together in mutiny. St Vincent did ensure, however, that the men under his command were cared for. When the stock of tobacco ran low the Admiral ensured that the supply was renewed from his own funds. When the postmaster in Lisbon detained the letters and packets arriving from England for the men for fear that they would carry seditious communications, Jervis set up a post office aboard his flagship to receive and distribute all the letters that arrived for both seamen, marines and officers.

Jervis strictly adhered to the Articles of War and individual regulations that he had written for his fleet. Any infraction was dealt with harshly and he was renowned for treating both officers and seamen with the same harsh discipline. As an example, one officer who allowed his boats crew to plunder a fishing boat was placed before a court martial and it was ordered that he be &quot;degraded from the rank of Midshipman in the most ignominious manner by having his uniform stripped from his back on the quarter deck of the (ship unknown)&quot;[sic]&quot;. before the whole ship&#x27;s company and to be further disposed of as the Commander-in-chief shall direct. To be mulcted of his pay now due to him for his services on board any ship of his Majesty&#x27;s service and to be rendered incapable of ever serving as an Officer or a Petty Officer in any of His Majesty&#x27;s ships.&quot; Jervis later personally directed that the midshipman should have his head shaved, a notice hung around his neck describing his crime and that he should be solely responsible for the cleaning of the head (naval term for the communal toilets situated at the bow of the ship) until further notice.

In another incident, St Vincent instructed that two men aboard who were tried for mutiny on a Saturday were executed on Sunday. The men were duly executed but Admiral Charles Thompson raised an objection to formal executions on the Sabbath and Jervis wrote to the Board of Admiralty demanding Thompson&#x27;s removal or that they accept his own resignation. The Board relieved Thompson. On 9 July 1797 Nelson wrote to Jervis congratulating him in his resolve and wholeheartedly supporting his decision to execute the men on a Sunday.

Jervis could also be exceptionally kind when he felt that the situation warranted it. On one occasion, while the fleet was becalmed the men of the flagship were ordered to bathe. The men leapt over the side to swim in a sail that had been lowered over the side. One of the men, a senior able seaman, jumped in wearing his trousers. In one of the pockets he had his prize money and back pay that he had been saving for several years. The bank notes were destroyed by the water and when the man came aboard and discovered what had happened he began to weep. The Admiral saw the man and asked the problem. One of his officers told him and St Vincent went to his cabin. When he returned he had the crew mustered and called the man forward. &quot;Roger Odell you are convicted, Sir, by your own appearance of tarnishing the British oak with tears. What have you to say in your defence why you should not receive what you deserve?&quot; The man told him what had happened and St Vincent replied &quot;Roger Odell you are one of the best men in this ship you are moreover a captain of a top and in my life I never saw a man behave himself better in battle than you did in the Victory in the action with the Spanish fleet. To show therefore that your Commander-in-chief will never pass over merit wheresoever he may find it. There is your money Sir!&quot; The Earl produced £70 of his own money and presented it to the surprised sailor &quot;but no more tears mind, no more tears Sir&quot;.

When Nelson returned to the Mediterranean St Vincent wrote to Earl Spencer, First Lord of the Admiralty: &quot;I do assure your Lordship that the arrival of Admiral Nelson has given me new life; you could not have gratified me more than in sending him. His presence in the Mediterranean is so very essential.&quot; St Vincent detached Nelson to pursue Napoleon in his invasion of Egypt

Rear-Admiral Sir John Orde, who was senior to Nelson, complained publicly and bitterly about what he considered a personal slight. Jervis ordered Orde home. Orde requested that he be court-martialled in order that he might have the opportunity to clear his name. The Board refused. Orde then requested that St Vincent be brought before a court-martial. Again, the Board refused. The Board censured Jervis for not having supported his subordinates.

Orde later challenged the ageing admiral to a duel. The challenge became public knowledge and the king ordered Jervis to decline. Before the challenge was formally declined, Orde wrote to the Board to inform them that he had withdrawn it.

When the men aboard the refused to execute a man for mutinous behaviour and their captain did nothing, the Earl threatened the captain with replacement and had boats from the rest of the fleet armed with carronades surround the &quot;Marlborough&quot;; he then threatened to sink the ship if his orders were not carried out. The man was duly executed. St Vincent turned to an officer beside him watching the mutineer hanging from the yard arm and said &quot;Discipline is preserved, Sir!&quot;

Between 1797 and 1799, alongside the suppression of mutiny, Jervis set himself the task of improving the dockyards and defences of Gibraltar. Having had great difficulty supplying the fleet with fresh water, the Admiral arranged for large water tanks to be built in Gibraltar. In addition St Vincent planned the building of a new Victualling Yard to replenish his ships, and the upgrading of the dockyards. After the Battle of the Nile the dockyards, under Jervis&#x27; watchful eye, managed to successfully repair most of the fleet.

Lady Lavinia Bingham, wife of Earl Spencer, wrote to St Vincent to congratulate him for having provided the necessary tools for Nelson to have achieved the victory he did at the Nile. &quot;Never did disinterested zeal and friendship meet with a brighter reward than yours has reaped in this victory of your gallant friend.&quot; Nelson commented that he had &quot;never beheld a fleet equal to Sir John Jervis&#x27;&quot;.

On 14 February 1799 St Vincent was created admiral of the white. Constant service and approaching old age meant that the admiral became increasingly unwell. Despite his failing health, St Vincent was reluctant to relinquish command and the Board reluctant to supersede him. By 17 June 1799 he had no choice but to resign his command and return to England. During his time ashore the Earl lived in Rochetts, in South Weald, Essex, with his wife.

===Command of the Channel Fleet===
As his health had improved he was given command of the Channel Fleet. St Vincent was to comment &quot;The King and the government require it and the discipline of the British Navy demands it. It is of no consequence to me whether I die afloat or ashore. The die is cast.&quot;

He took command of the Channel fleet in on 26 April 1800 and took up a close blockade of Brest. Once at Brest he transferred to &quot;Ville de Paris&quot; of 110 guns and took Sir Thomas Troubridge as his captain of the fleet. He was also accompanied by his personal physician, Doctor Andrew Baird. Baird was later to become instrumental in the plans of the commander-in-chief and the health and well being of the Channel fleet.

St Vincent&#x27;s appointment was not popular among the officers of the Channel fleet. His reputation as a strict disciplinarian had followed him from the Mediterranean and he immediately issued orders banning officers and captains from sleeping ashore and forbade them from travelling more than three miles from their ship. The wife of one of his captains is said to have toasted the news of his appointment with the line &quot;May his next glass of wine choke the wretch.&quot;

Among other strict regulations introduced were orders that ships were to be repaired where possible at sea and that Ushant was to be the official rendezvous for the Channel fleet rather than the traditional Torbay. Ships were forbidden to go to Spithead without specific written orders from the Admiral or Admiralty. During his command he remained with the fleet and became respected by the officers and men for suffering their hardships with them.

With the charts that he had made with Barrington in 1775 the inshore squadron at Brest was able to keep a much tighter blockade. In one incident, the inshore squadron sighted several French ships leaving Brest. Sir Edward Pellew, captain of HMS &quot;Impétueux&quot;, gave chase. The rear admiral in charge of the inshore squadron recalled him, worried that &quot;Impétueux&quot; would run aground. The French escaped.

After several letters went back and forth between the two admirals, St Vincent, tired of his subordinate&#x27;s excuses, took the entire offshore squadron and sailed them between the inshore squadron and the shore, thus proving that the ships had a shallow enough draught to have given chase and captured the French. St Vincent then wrote to the rear admiral and suggested that he strike his flag and return to shore for some needed rest.

St Vincent was as generous in the Channel as he had been in the Mediterranean. A particular letter from England made the admiral host a dinner aboard the flagship for fifty of the officers whom he felt closest to. At the dinner he revealed that the letter was from an orphanage near Paddington in London. The orphanage had run out of money to support the children of sailors who had died in the service of their country. St Vincent solicited from each captain and lieutenant a sum of money and then added his own donation. The cutter sailed back to England the same evening. St Vincent gave the orphanage £1,000

St Vincent&#x27;s skills as an administrator and logistician came into play, particularly regarding the health and well being of the fleet. St Vincent wrote to Earl Spencer, commenting &quot;I have ever considered the care of the sick and wounded as one of the first duties of a Commander-in-chief, by sea or land.&quot; Based on Doctor Baird&#x27;s advice on cleanliness and hygiene the admiral brought in as many fresh vegetables as he could, along with vast quantities of fresh lemon juice to minimise illness, particularly scurvy.

The effect was dramatic. The hospital ship that accompanied the fleet was sent home unneeded and in November 1800 when the fleet came to anchor in Torbay there were as few as sixteen hospital cases among the estimated twenty three thousand men. In a letter to Sir Evan Nepean, first secretary to the Admiralty, St Vincent described Baird as &quot;the most valuable man in the Navy not excepting the Board itself,&quot;

The oncoming winter of 1800–1801 forced the admiral to live ashore at Torre Abbey overlooking Torbay. Vice-Admiral Sir Henry Harvey took over operational command of the fleet in St Vincent&#x27;s absence.

In 1801 in a letter to the Board of Admiralty, St Vincent made the now famous remark: &quot;I do not say, my Lords, that the French will not come. I say only they will not come by sea.&quot; In 1801 St Vincent was replaced by Admiral William Cornwallis and the new Prime Minister Henry Addington promoted St Vincent to First Lord of the Admiralty.

==First Lord of the Admiralty==
 In January 1801 St Vincent had written a short letter to the then First Lord Earl Spencer stating: &quot;Nothing short of a radical sweep in the dockyards can cure the enormous evils and corruptions in them; and this cannot be attempted till we have peace.&quot; As First Lord St Vincent intended to investigate, discover and remove all of the corruption that he considered plagued the Navy, the Royal Dockyards and their civilian administration. Consequently, he clashed with the various Navy Boards, the civil administration of the Royal Navy that administered among other things the navy yards and stores. St Vincent saw these boards and individuals as hindering the efforts of the Navy.

===Commission of Inquiry===
During the peace with France, after the Treaty of Amiens was signed on 27 March 1802, St Vincent ordered the Navy Board to begin an investigation for fraud and corruption in the Royal Dockyards. He swiftly found that the investigations were not being conducted effectively and ordered the commissioners to retrieve all logs and accounts and inventories and put them under their &quot;personal seal&quot; in anticipation of the Admiralty Board travelling to the various yards itself and conducting their own inspection.

The investigation began in earnest in 1802. St Vincent swiftly uncovered casual and obvious abuses of the system. Some men were listed as having done work, then over-time and then acted as night watchmen for years without a break of any kind. Others were listed as workmen ashore but also as sailors receiving pay in the Receiving Ship. Work was done and then the identical work was charged for over various periods, often by different departments or sections. In another yard, &quot;The men of an entire department were found to be incapables, as old, infirm boys, cripples, or idiots, and the department itself to have the appearance of an asylum for every rogue and vagabond that could not obtain a meal by any other means.&quot;

St Vincent found that minor dockyard officials were the tip of a far bigger pattern of corruption. He lobbied the government to create a special commission of inquiry that would have the power to question suspects under oath. The cabinet determined that the outcome of such an inquiry might be damaging politically (and possibly, in some cases, personally) and gave the board of inquiry permission to question suspects under oath but gave the suspects the right to refuse to answer questions that might incriminate themselves. This addendum prevented the inquiry from acting effectively.

The Commission of Inquiry produced twelve reports:

# Foreign Yards;
# the Chatham Chest (the pension fund for seamen);
# supply of Blocks and Naval Cooperage;
# prize money and prize causes;
# the Collection of the sixpence from Merchant Seamen;
# the Economy of the Naval Yards;
# the Naval Hospitals and the Hospital ships for French prisoners at Plymouth;
# the Victualling and Cooperage at Plymouth;
# the receipt and expenditure of stores at Plymouth;
# Office of Treasurer of the Navy;
# the issue of Money Bills;
# the purchase Stores for the Naval Service more particularly Masts, Spars, Fir and Hemp

One of St Vincent&#x27;s biographers put the findings of the commission succinctly &quot;The valuable British oak rotted in the forests for want of the axe; the frames building rotted on the stocks for want of timber; the ships at sea rotted before their day because constructed of such worthless perishable materials.&quot;

===Reform===
 One reform St Vincent did achieve was the introduction of block making machinery at the navy yard in Portsmouth. The machinery was designed by Marc Isambard Brunel and Samuel Bentham. By 1808 forty-five machines were turning out 130,000 pulley blocks per year. The innovation meant that only ten to thirty unskilled men were able to equal the output of 100 skilled blockmakers and the capital cost of the project was recovered in three years. The revolution of machinery enabled the Navy to become self-sufficient in regard to the production of the essential blocks.

This self-sufficiency removed a great deal of corruption, from external contractors producing inferior goods that jeopardised sailors&#x27; lives, to the corruption that arose from poorly paid officials responsible for awarding contracts and the bribes that might ensue. The buildings that housed the Block Machinery remain to this day and make up part of the Historic Portsmouth Dockyard.

As First Lord, St Vincent also determined to build a breakwater in Plymouth. The First Lord commissioned a civil engineer, John Rennie, and Joseph Whidbey, the former Master-Attendant at Woolwich dockyard, to design the breakwater. Work did not begin until 1811 but the earl is widely credited as the force behind its construction.

St Vincent spoke with the King regarding the contribution made by marines to the general service of the Navy and recommended to the King that the prefix &quot;Royal&quot; be added. These were the first official discussions into the retitling of the corps to Royal Marines.

During his tenure, the workers in the Royal dockyards demanded an increase in pay due to an increase in living costs. St Vincent reacted by dismissing the ringleaders and every man who had taken an active role in the strike. He eventually agreed to a small temporary allowance for the purchase of bread while the price of bread remained high.

St Vincent&#x27;s gaze passed over every aspect of the Navy from the Sea Fencibles, civilian militias made up of merchant seamen using their own private or commercial vessels, but operating under letters of marque that authorised them to capture enemy ships should opportunity arise, to the Navy Hospitals. The earl attempted to disband the Sea Fencibles, claiming that they were needed only to quiet the fears of little old ladies and that good men passed their whole careers without hearing a shot fired. Doctor Baird, St Vincent&#x27;s personal physician, was appointed to the Sick and Hurt Board as Inspector of all hospitals.

===Powers to promote===
Another burden of his promotion to First Lord of the Admiralty was that St Vincent was inundated with letters from aspiring officers and their relatives and friends. Soliciting employment from those in positions of influence in the navy had become common practice and was a generally accepted method of securing a good posting. The more influence that an officer could draw upon, the better and often more lucrative the position.

Also, due to the peace with France the navy had been reduced and employment was scarce. The First Lord could not, therefore, provide every officer of influence a position and was obliged to reject many of the letters that he received. Despite St Vincent having declared both publicly and privately that officers would be promoted or given position commensurate with their achievements and not based on their political or social influence, the letters continued to flow to the Admiralty.

The ways in which St Vincent chose to communicate the rejections often depended on the number of letters, the individual concerned, or the demands made by their respective well wishers. To the Earl of Portsmouth he wrote: &quot;I cannot possibly agree in opinion with your Lordship, that a person sitting quietly by his fireside, and enjoying very nearly a sinecure, during such a war as we have been engaged in, has the same pretensions to promotion with the man who has exposed his person, and hazarded his constitution in every clime.&quot; A harsh rebuff to a peer of the realm. Yet to a lady of no discernible rank or influence he wrote: &quot;Although I cannot admit the force of your argument in favour of Captain (name unknown) &quot;[sic.]&quot;, there is something so amiable and laudable in a sister contending for the promotion of her brother that no apology was necessary for your letter of the 24th, which I lose no time in acknowledging.&quot;

Famously, when Commander Lord Cochrane captured the 32-gun Spanish frigate &quot;El Gamo&quot; in the 14-gun sloop a promotion was the usual reward for such a feat of skill and seamanship. It would be fair to argue that it would have been expected by both the commander and his friends and family. Unfortunately for Cochrane, the ship carrying the letter of that victory was intercepted and it was only received after he had himself been captured by the French and was facing a court-martial over the loss of his ship. A court-martial for losing one&#x27;s ship was common practice at the time and in many cases, including Cochrane&#x27;s, it was only a formality. It was only when Cochrane was cleared by the court that he could be promoted.

Unfortunately the commander thought that the First Lord had deliberately withheld the promotion due to an unforeseen grudge; he held this opinion for the rest of his life. Cochrane had many powerful friends and relatives who lobbied continuously on his behalf. These solicitations may have had a negative effect on Cochrane&#x27;s career as it is possible that Jervis became irritated by them.

===Resignation as First Lord===
The detailed investigation into corruption that St Vincent began caused him to become extremely unpopular, as many influential men were involved in the various money-making schemes perpetrated. The board of inquiry set up by St Vincent was responsible for the impeachment of Henry Dundas, 1st Viscount Melville, the trusted lieutenant of British Prime Minister William Pitt and the most powerful politician in Scotland in the late 18th century, and his trial for misappropriation of public funds; Melville resigned. The House of Lords found Melville not guilty and he was acquitted of all charges.

St Vincent had thereby made an enemy of Pitt, who used the naval reform and its unpopularity to attack the First Lord and the Addington administration. St Vincent left the office on 14 May 1804 when Addington was replaced as prime minister by Pitt. Lord Howick, second son of St Vincent&#x27;s friend Sir Charles Grey, came to his defence and, with the assistance of Charles James Fox, moved for a vote of thanks in the Commons for St Vincent&#x27;s tireless efforts in naval reform in 1806.

On 14 May 1806, John Jeffery, one of the Members of Parliament for Poole, opened a parliamentary debate condemning St Vincent for &quot;unprecedented neglect in building and repairing of ships while his Lordship presided at the Board of Admiralty and with delivering up the navy to his successor in a far less efficient state than that in which he received it&quot;.
This motion was rejected and instead the Foreign Secretary, Charles James Fox, proposed a vote of thanks to Earl St Vincent, &quot;That it appears to this house, that the conduct of the Earl of St. Vincent, in his late naval administration, has added an additional lustre to his exalted character, and is entitled to the approbation of this house.&quot;

Fox had said of St Vincent&#x27;s appointment in 1801 &quot;allow me to say, that I do not think it would be easy, if possible, to find a man in the whole community better suited, or more capable of the high office he fills, than the distinguished person at the head of the Admiralty – I mean the Earl of St Vincent.&quot; and had continued his support of the Earl throughout his time as first lord.

==Resumption of command==
On 9 November 1805 St Vincent was promoted admiral of the red. He took command of the Channel Fleet once more in the 110-gun first-rate . During his tenure in command he spent much of his time at a house that he rented in the village of Rame. Once again he issued the orders that had become so effective in the Mediterranean and his previous Channel command. Once again these orders proved unpopular.

For a short time in 1806 he gave command of the Channel Fleet to his second-in-command Sir Charles Cotton in order that he might travel to Portugal on a particular mission. Portugal was under threat of invasion and St Vincent had been ordered, if necessary, to take the Portuguese court to its colony in Brazil. The invasion was delayed and St Vincent was recalled to the Channel Fleet. It was Sir Sidney Smith and Graham Moore who led the Royal family to safety in Brazil.

The Earl had always attempted to promote on merit rather than patronage and had become increasingly frustrated with the system of preferment by social rank and not competence. At his retirement in 1807 he had an audience with the King. The King asked if the navy were a better institution now than it had been on St Vincent&#x27;s entrance into it. St Vincent replied that it was not. He stated: &quot;Sire, I have always thought that a sprinkling of nobility was very desirable in the Navy, as it gives some sort of consequence to the service; but at present the Navy is so overrun by the younger branches of nobility, and the sons of Members of Parliament and they so swallow up all the patronage and so choke the channel to promotion, that the son of an old officer, however meritorious both their services may have been, has little or no chance of getting on.&quot; He continued on &quot;I would rather promote the son of an old deserving Officer than of any noble in the land.&quot;

In a letter dated 18 October 1806 to Viscount Howick, then the First Lord, St Vincent wrote &quot;If you will, my good Lord, bring a bill into Parliament to disqualify any Officer under the rank of Rear-Admiral to sit in the House of Commons, the Navy may be preserved; but while a little, drunken, worthless jackanapes is permitted to hold the seditious language he has done, in the presence of Flag-officers of rank, you will require a man of greater health and vigour than I possess to command your fleets.&quot; Presumably St Vincent was referring to a particular member of Parliament, although his feelings on the subject remain clear.

St Vincent had long suffered from poor health and a change in government led to his resignation on 24 April 1807.

==Final years==

In his retirement he seldom took his seat in the House of Lords and made his last appearance in either 1810 or 1811. During these final years St Vincent gave generously to various charities, organisations and individuals. He donated £500 to the wounded and survivors of the Battle of Waterloo and £300 to relieve starvation in Ireland. St Vincent also donated £100 to the building of a Jewish chapel in Whitechapel, London.

In 1807, St Vincent, as a member of the House of Lords, opposed the proposed Slave Trade Act 1807, which would abolish British involvement in the Atlantic slave trade. He argued that if Britain were to abolish the slave trade, it would merely result in a transfer of British capital to other nations, and countered humanitarian criticisms of the trade by arguing the West Indies was a better place to live in comparison to Africa. St Vincent also argued that the vacuum left by the abolition of the trade would filled by France, potentially threatening Britain&#x27;s naval supremacy. Despite this, the bill was successfully passed into law.

St Vincent also spoke in opposition to the Convention of Sintra and the Walcheren Campaign and then condemned its failure, although he conspicuously excluded the failure of its officers and men. St Vincent spoke in defence of Lieutenant-General Sir John Moore&#x27;s retreat through Spain and Portugal and condemned the government and army commanders for failure to support him thoroughly.

In 1816 his wife Martha died at Rochetts in Essex. The couple had no children. In the winter of 1818–1819 St Vincent went to recover his health in France. When he arrived at Toulon he was greeted by Admiral Édouard Missiessy, who said of St Vincent that he was &quot;as much the father of the French as of the English Navy&quot;.

===Further honours===
In 1800 St Vincent was made an honorary lieutenant-general of Marines and in 1814 was promoted to general. These positions were little more than a sinecure and carried no official duties.

In 1801 St Vincent had been created Viscount St Vincent of Meaford, Staffordshire. a title that because he had no children passed to his nephew, Edward Jervis Ricketts. In 1806 he was appointed as one of the thirty one elder brothers of Trinity House. The elder brothers, along with the master, form the court of Trinity House.

In 1809 St Vincent was honoured by John VI of Portugal who awarded him the Royal Portuguese Military Order of the Tower and Sword in order to commemorate the safe arrival of the Royal Family in Brazil, after Napoleon had invaded Portugal.

In May 1814 he was promoted acting admiral of the fleet and commander-in-chief of the Channel squadron. He was confirmed Admiral of the fleet on 19 July 1821 and George IV sent him a gold topped baton as a symbol of the office. The baton is currently held in the collections of the National Maritime Museum, Greenwich.

On 2 January 1815 he was made Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath when the order was rearranged by the Prince Regent. Knight Grand Cross is the highest rank in the order.

===Death and memorial===

St Vincent died on 13 March 1823 and, because he had no children, the Barony of Jervis and the Earldom of St Vincent became extinct. His nephew, Edward Jervis Ricketts, became the 2nd Viscount St Vincent and changed his surname to Jervis, becoming Edward Jervis Jervis in honour of his uncle. St Vincent was buried at Stone, Staffordshire, in the family mausoleum, at his own request, and a monument was erected in the crypt of St. Paul&#x27;s Cathedral.

===Legacy===

At least three ships and two stone frigates (or shore establishments) have been named , either in honour of the Earl or after that battle that he won. , commissioned in 1910, was the first of her class and therefore the class of battleship was named after her. The s included and . , a J-class destroyer, launched just prior to the Second World War, was named after the admiral. HMS &quot;Jervis&quot; served throughout the war. She was known as a lucky ship as, despite taking part in several actions, she never lost a man to enemy fire. , an armed merchant cruiser that was sunk in heroic circumstances by the German pocket battleship in 1940, was indirectly named after him.

Jervis has also been remembered in schools in England. He has a boarding house (Saint Vincent) named in his honour at the Royal Hospital School in Holbrook, Suffolk. St Vincent College in Gosport, England is named after the admiral&#x27;s most famous battle.

As with many other officers during the great age of discovery there are several areas of the world named in the earl&#x27;s honour. Cape Jervis and Gulf St Vincent, South Australia, and Jervis Bay, New South Wales, Australia were named for him as was the town of Vincentia and Jervis Bay National Park. The County of St Vincent, New South Wales was also named in his honour. Jervis Inlet, in British Columbia, Canada, was also named for him.

Jervis appears as a fictional character in two Horatio Hornblower novels, &quot;Hornblower and the Atropos&quot; and &quot;Lord Hornblower&quot;.

==Historiography==
Though Jervis clearly had a strong impact during the Napoleonic Wars and afterwards on the development of the Navy, surprisingly few contemporary biographies of Jervis are available, and those are seriously lacking in breadth and thoroughness. The most recent work related to Jervis is &quot;The Remaking of the English Navy by Admiral St. Vincent: The Great Unclaimed Naval Revolution&quot; by Charles Arthur, 1986, but this focused more on Jervis&#x27;s reforms to the docks, and less to other parts of his life. Evelyn Berkman&#x27;s &quot;Nelson&#x27;s Dear Lord: Portrait of St. Vincent&quot; (1962), as the bibliographer Eugene Rasor points out, is merely an &quot;effort&quot; to create a biography. The same bibliographer says much the same about William Milbourne James&#x27;s &quot;&quot;Old Oak&quot;: The Life of John Jervis, Earl St. Vincent&quot; (1950) and Owen Sherrard&#x27;s &quot;A life of Lord St. Vincent&quot; (1933), pointing to both as mediocre. Ruddock Mackay published an article which documented the early life of Jervis.

<doc id="366237" wikidata="Q5614090" url="?curid=366237" title="Guardian telephone exchange">
<text>Guardian Exchange was an underground telephone exchange built in Manchester from 1954 to 1957. It was built together with the Anchor exchange in Birmingham and the Kingsway exchange in London – all believed to provide hardened communications in the event of nuclear war; as well as linking the UK government in London to the US Government in Washington, D.C. by means of a secure and hardened transatlantic telephone cable making landfall near Oban and running through Glasgow, Manchester and Birmingham. Today, the underground site is used for telephone cabling. Constructed at a depth of below 35 metres (115 ft), the tunnels are about 2 metres (80 in) in diameter. The exchange cost around £4 million (approximately £126 million in 2015 prices), part of which was funded by the United Kingdom&#x27;s NATO partners.

==History==
Construction began following the clearance of the land between York Street and Piccadilly Bus Station, for the building of The Piccadilly Plaza complex. The site was surrounded by high, wooden fencing and it was hoped that no-one would suspect that the &#x27;foundation works&#x27; were taking an inordinately long time. Huge amounts of construction materials entered the site, over a long period of time, before any above-ground works could be sighted.

The Guardian exchange equipment was housed in two levels of tunnels beginning under the lower levels of the Piccadilly Plaza and extending south-west under the old &#x27;Central&#x27; telephone exchange, on (New) York Street, and following the line of George Street into Manchester&#x27;s China Town. A pedestrian staircase led down from the former telephone exchange, which has now been sold off as an office block. A large diameter, vertical shaft descends from an anonymous-looking yard on George Street, (See above photo). This contains a large goods lift and crane, by which all the equipment was installed and, subsequently, removed. In the event of hostilities, the shaft could be sealed by a huge, swinging blast cover. Two long cable tunnels lead east and west away from the main complex. The eastern tunnel terminates in the cable chamber of Ardwick Telephone Exchange, with a maintenance and ventilation shaft near to the junction of the Mancunian Way and London Road. The western tunnel runs under the River Irwell and terminates in the lower cable chamber of Dial House in Salford (the main central Manchester telephone exchange). This tunnel also has small, maintenance and ventilation shafts.

As well as the Trunk Telephone Exchange, the main complex also housed large diesel power generators, air scrubbers, sleeping quarters, kitchen, food storage and dining area and even a well furnished bar with Formica tables, banquette and stool seating, piano and pool table. Just as at the GPO Club, under the old Central Post Office in Spring Gardens, there were fake windows, with murals of outdoor scenes, to make it less claustrophobic.

With all the equipment now removed, the main tunnels are empty and bare. The main, pedestrian entrance shaft, from the old telephone exchange, has been filled in and no evidence now remains within the present office building. The main equipment lift-shaft, with its huge, swinging blast door, in the yard on George Street, still remains.
The complex now serves only as a cross-city cable route, between Ardwick and Dial House Telephone exchanges.

Guardian is excavated within coal measures having a high water content; so that the tunnels are constantly filling with ground-water, and must be continually pumped out through an outflow pipe that can be seen discharging into the river Irwell alongside Blackfriars Bridge. The former main entrance on George Street is no longer used but the lift is maintained. All access is now via Dial House and Ardwick telephone exchanges. There is also a service riser, within the Piccadilly Plaza, providing radio-communications cabling to the roof of the City Tower (ex Bernard Sunley Building) for emergency radio services, and microwave link antennas.

===Use as a nuclear bunker===
The Guardian Bunker has been called the &quot;Best kept secret in Manchester&quot; and its existence was only publicly acknowledged in 1968, 14 years after initial construction.

===Use as a telephone exchange===
The tunnels are known to be used for British Telecom cables. The exchange rose to prominence in March 2004 when a fire in one of the tunnels caused 130,000 telephone lines in Manchester to be cut off. Ambulance and fire service calls around the North West region were also severely affected.

<doc id="366243" wikidata="Q1604323" url="?curid=366243" title="Poser (software)">
<text>Poser (and Poser Pro) is a figure posing and rendering 3D computer graphics program distributed by Bondware. Poser is optimized for the 3D modeling of human figures. It enables beginners to produce basic animations and digital images, along with the extensive availability of third-party digital 3D models.

==Overview==
Poser is a single-threaded 3D rendering software package for the posing, animating, and rendering of 3D poly-mesh human and animal figures. it is published by Bondware and supported by Renderosity, a graphic 3D art content store. Poser allows the user to load figures, props, lighting, and cameras for both still and animated renderings.

Using a subset of the Alias object (OBJ) file format and a text-based markup for content files, Poser comes with a library of pre-rigged human, animal, robotic, and cartoon figures. The package also includes poses, hairpieces, props, textures, hand gestures, and facial expressions. As Poser itself does not allow for original modeling of objects, a large community market of artists has emerged, in which Poser content is created and sold through various third party channels.

Poser is available in multiple languages including English, Japanese, German, and French. Poser is available for both Microsoft Windows and Mac OS X operating systems. While Poser&#x27;s interface has evolved since the product&#x27;s introduction in 1995, the current Poser Pro 13 preserves many of the application&#x27;s original interface elements in order to not alienate the legacy users from the newer versions.

==Features==
Renderosity offers a selection of ready-to-use content to add to Poser&#x27;s included runtime library of base content, including body and hand poses, materials, props, facial expressions, hairpieces, lights, cameras, and a Reyes-based render engine called Firefly, which supports nodes for the creation of complex materials. Furthermore, it provides import of sound, image, and video files, motion capture data and 3D content for the creation of scenes or the addition of new library items. Poser exports content in many 3D formats. Poser is capable of material editing, facial photo matching, dynamic hair, dynamic cloth and new figure rigging. Online content is also available. Python enables third-party developers to create additional features ranging from custom libraries, rendering engine control panels, metadata editors and utility scripts.

==Usage==
Poser is used to create original images ranging from human figures, human renderings of medical and industrial design illustrations, editorial illustrations, informational graphics, graphic novel illustrations, comics, and more.

Poser contains many animation capabilities and is regularly employed by broadcast professionals including animation staff at &quot;Fox Bones&quot;, &quot;Colbert Report&quot; and &quot;Jimmy Kimmel Live!&quot;, as well as in industry applications, such as in the animated instructions for automated checkout machines at Albertsons, Save-On stores and Wal-Mart, films including Star Trek fan-film, &quot;Star Trek: Aurora&quot;,&quot;The Misty Green Sky&quot;, and &quot;The Exigency&quot;. Poser characters and animations were used for early computer games from &#x27;buddies&#x27; game creators (&quot;Desert Rifle&quot; games and &quot;Cake shop&quot; from Qi and ELEFUN(TM) game developers). The software was also used in the eighth, ninth, and tenth seasons of &quot;Red vs. Blue&quot;, as well as the first three seasons of &quot;RWBY&quot;.

Standard Poser characters have been extensively used by European and US-based documentary production teams to graphically render the human body or virtual actors in digital scenes. Humanoids printed in several science and technology magazines around the US are often Poser-rendered and post-worked models.

A film animated entirely on Poser, titled &quot;The Exigency&quot;, took thirteen years to produce and was released on December 14, 2019.

==Library==
Poser is packaged with ready-to-use 3D content that allows new users to get started without needing to purchase additional content. Items are stored in Poser&#x27;s drag-and-drop-enabled Library and are organized by type and name, e.g. People/Ryan2. Users can save customized figures or objects into the Library in order to reuse those items at a later point in time. The Library also supports adding in additional &quot;Runtimes&quot; which are collections of content that legacy users have assembled from third party providers.

The Library includes a configurable, keyword-based Search function that locates content in the Library or connected Runtimes. Content can also be added to the Library&#x27;s Favorites for quick access.

The Library is set up with categories that each include collections of similar content items:

;Character
: Pre-rigged figures including anatomically accurate humans, mannikins, animals, insects, dinosaurs, cartoon characters, human anatomies such as skeletons, and musculature and mechanical figures such as vehicles.
;Pose
: Animated and static poses for human and animals covering day-to-day activities, dancing, walking, standing, and sitting, as well as action and sport poses.
;Face
: Includes full and partial facial expressions.
;Hair
: Includes prop-based transparency-mapped hairpieces, dynamic hairpieces, and hair props such as mustaches or sideburns.
;Hand
: Hand poses of various types such as action poses and gestures, signals, counting, and American Sign Language.
;Props
: Includes primitives such as spheres and cylinders, clothing items grouped by character, scene props, furniture, rooms, vehicles, plants, and cartoon elements.
;Lights
: Includes animated or static pre-set lights consisting of spotlights, infinite lights, point lights, diffuse IBL lights.
;Cameras
: Includes animated or static cameras.
;Materials
: Includes simple and complex node-based materials.
;Scenes
: Full Poser scenes including a Factory, Crime Scene Lab, and a modern Apartment.

==History==
Poser was created by artist and programmer Larry Weinberg as a digital replacement for artist&#x27;s mannequins. Versions 1.0 and 2.0 were published by Fractal Design. In 1997, Fractal Design was acquired by MetaCreations, and Poser&#x27;s interface was redesigned by MetaCreations&#x27; Phil Clevenger for release as Poser 3 in 1998. This interface has remained as the basis for all subsequent versions. In 1999, MetaCreations sold Poser to egi.sys AG, which established the subsidiary &quot;Curious Labs&quot;, with Larry Weinberg as CEO to handle Poser development and publication. Curious Labs and Poser were sold to e-frontier, in 2003. In November 2007, Smith Micro Software acquired Poser as well as Anime Studio (now called Moho). Smith Micro Software also acquired the English language distribution rights to Manga Studio (now called Clip Studio Paint), from e-Frontier. The latest &quot;stable&quot; versions of Poser were released in September 2019, as Poser 12 is currently in open beta. Poser 11 introduced many new features, including better rigging capabilities.

Early versions of Poser were bundled with fully clothed humanoid figures specifically designed for Poser. As the program evolved, add-on packages of human figures were sold by the manufacturer of Poser, and eventually, third-party companies began creating figures which work with Poser. As clothing became separate from the humanoid figure, collections of 3D garments were created for specific models which conform to the shape and pose of the Poser figure. &#x27;Poses&#x27; for figures were packaged and sold by the software vendor and by third parties. &#x27;Morphs&#x27;, allowing customization of body or face shape or other features, were also sold. Different skin textures, frequently combined with settings for morph technology, are marketed to allow one base model to be customized into many different &#x27;characters&#x27;. Similarly &#x27;texture&#x27; packages allow one garment to take on many different appearances, an animal to represent different breeds of the same species or a vehicle to show many different color schemes.

On July 2, 2009, Smith Micro Software announced the creation of a new platform for distribution of assets for use in Poser called Content Paradise.

On November 9, 2018, Smith Micro Software announced the closure of Content Paradise on December 3, 2018, the content moved to Renderosity.

On June 20, 2019, Smith Micro Software announced they sold the product line of its Poser software to Bondware, Inc., owner of the popular online marketplace, Renderosity.com, and longtime Smith Micro resale partner.

==Poser figures==
Poser&#x27;s specially designed figures are commonly known as Poser Figures, Poser Models, Poser Content, Digital Actors, or Digital Puppets. Early versions of Poser were bundled with fully clothed humanoid figures specifically designed for the then-current version of Poser. Next, add-on packages of human figures were sold by the manufacturer of Poser. Soon, third party companies began creating figures which work with Poser. As clothing became separate from the humanoid figure, collections of 3D garments were created for specific models which conform to the shape and pose of the Poser figure. &#x27;Poses&#x27; for figures were packaged and sold by the software vendor and by third parties. &#x27;Morphs&#x27; allowing customization of body or face shape or other features are also for sale. Skin textures, frequently combined with settings for morph technology, are marketed to allow one base model to be customized into many &#x27;characters&#x27;; similar &#x27;texture&#x27; packages allow one garment to take on many appearances, an animal to represent different breeds of the same species, or a vehicle to show many colour schemes.

===Development of figures===
Each major release of Poser has come with a new generation of figures for use with the tool, however separate figures rapidly became available as the content market developed. Notably Zygote (later Daz 3D) made a Poser model of a young woman, higher-resolution than Posette, and called her &quot;the Millennium Girl&quot;. Poser users often colloquially shortened this name to &quot;Millie&quot;. Zygote, disliking this name, officially named her Victoria, which is often colloquially shortened to Vicky. Victoria then became the initial member of a large family of figures which has developed across multiple generations of technology. After they merged with Gizmoz in late 2009, Daz 3D released all their Poser figures as free downloads, but withdrew the free versions of their pre-Genesis figures when Genesis was released.

===Content market===
Because Poser figures are very inexpensive and useful for commercial illustrators, an entire cottage industry has developed to create and market Poser figures and other content. The market is a combination of several large distributors, who often also develop products, and of individual artists who often use one or more of the larger distributors to handle the sale of their products. Both the distributors and individual artists are involved in the creation of Poser figures, clothing, poses, morphs, textures and characters.

===Figure families===

Rather than unconnected single figures, Poser figures are now generally produced as families of models linked by technology generation and creator. Certain add-on products, most often poses and skin textures, but including some clothing models, may be usable across more than one model within a family, but in general are not usable across different generations of the same model. Examples of notable families of models are:

<text>The Trojan Room coffee pot was a coffee machine located in the Computer Laboratory of the University of Cambridge, England. It was the subject of the world&#x27;s first webcam, created by Quentin Stafford-Fraser and Paul Jardetzky in 1991.

To save people working in the building the disappointment of finding the coffee machine empty after making the trip to the room, a camera was set up providing a live picture of the coffee pot to all desktop computers on the office network. After the camera was connected to the Internet a few years later, the coffee pot gained international renown as a feature of the fledgling World Wide Web, until being retired in 2001.

== Development ==
The 128×128 px greyscale camera was connected to the laboratory&#x27;s local network through a video capture card fitted on an Acorn Archimedes computer. Researcher Quentin Stafford-Fraser wrote the client software, dubbed XCoffee and employing the X Window System protocol, while his colleague Paul Jardetzky wrote the server program.

In 1993, web browsers gained the ability to display images; it soon became clear that this would be an easier way to make the picture available to users. The camera was connected to the Internet and the live picture became available via HTTP in November of the same year, by computer scientists Daniel Gordon and Martyn Johnson. It therefore became visible worldwide and grew into a popular landmark of the early web.

== Retirement ==

Following the laboratory&#x27;s move to its current premises, the camera was eventually switched off, at 09:54 UTC on 22 August 2001. Coverage of the shutdown included front-page mentions in &quot;The Times&quot; and &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, as well as articles in &quot;The Guardian&quot; and &quot;Wired&quot;.

The last of the four or five coffee machines seen online, a Krups, was auctioned on eBay for to the German news website &quot;Der Spiegel&quot;. The pot was later refurbished pro bono by Krups employees, and was switched on again in the magazine&#x27;s editorial office. Since the summer of 2016, the coffee maker is on permanent loan to the Heinz Nixdorf MuseumsForum in Paderborn.

== Legacy and cultural references ==
Spoofs of the Trojan Room coffee machine ranged from the Hyper Text Coffee Pot Control Protocol, a 1998 April Fools&#x27; Day specification for a communication protocol, to the 2002 video game &quot;Hitman 2: Silent Assassin&quot;, in which the player can destroy a &quot;coffee camera&quot; in a kitchen as a distraction. The coffee pot was also mentioned in the BBC Radio 4 drama &quot;The Archers&quot; on 24 February 2005.

<doc id="366246" wikidata="Q5536992" url="?curid=366246" title="George Birkbeck">
<text>George Birkbeck FRS (; 10 January 1776 – 1 December 1841) was an English physician, academic, philanthropist, pioneer in adult education and a professor of natural philosophy at the Andersonian Institute. He is the founder of Birkbeck, University of London and was head of the Chemical Society. He is one of the creators of the earliest chemistry laboratory for undergraduates at University College London, and is also known for the creation of mechanics&#x27; institutes in Scotland and London. He was President of the Medical and Chirurgical Society of London in 1825.

==Early life and education==
Birkbeck was born on 10 January 1776 to a Quaker family in Settle, West Riding of Yorkshire. His mother was Sarah and his father, William, was a merchant and banker.

Birkbeck went to Sedbergh School and then studied medicine at Leeds and London before completing his training as a doctor at the University of Edinburgh Medical School in 1799 with an MD degree.

==Career==
Before practising as a physician, he embarked on an academic career, being appointed professor of natural philosophy at the Andersonian Institute in Glasgow, which later became the University of Strathclyde. After mechanics started asking questions about the apparatus he used in his lectures, he had the idea of holding free, public lectures on the &quot;mechanical arts&quot; (). These Saturday evening events proved very popular and continued after his departure to London. His fourth annual lecture attracted a crowd of 500, and became an annual occurrence,leading to the formation in 1821 of the first mechanics&#x27; institute in Edinburgh (the Edinburgh School of Arts). These new institutions gave classes, and included libraries, and apparatus to be used for experiments and technical education.

In 1804 he set up in practice in the City of London and became acquainted with George Grote, Henry Brougham, and &quot;many other men of liberal ideas&quot;. In 1809 he assisted in founding the London Institution.

Working as a doctor in London in 1823, Birkbeck, along with Brougham, Jeremy Bentham and John Hobhouse came together to discuss the education for the working men of London. To achieve this they established the London Mechanics Institute in November 1823, of which Birkbeck was the first president in 1824. He also laid the foundation stone of the building in 1825.

==Death and legacy==

He died on 1 December 1841 at his home in Finsbury Square and was buried in Kensal Green Cemetery, London. 

There is a monument in St Akelda&#x27;s Church in Giggleswick, near his birthplace in Settle.

Birkbeck&#x27;s association with the ground-breaking London Institution was marked by it being renamed the Birkbeck Literary and Scientific Institution in 1866 (now, as Birkbeck College, part of the University of London). The College moved to its present buildings (Malet Street, London WC1) in 1951, but the original foundation stone as well as a memorial tablet have been retained and are in the entrance hall.

The mechanics&#x27; institute concept was quickly adopted in numerous other cities and towns across the UK and overseas, and Birkbeck is remembered for having been a co-founder of this model of education and philanthropy.

==Family==
He married Catherine Lloyd in 1806 but she died in childbirth in 1807, leaving a son, William Lloyd Birkbeck. He remarried Anna Gardner in 1817, and they had three sons and three daughters.

He is of the same Birkbeck family as early 19th-century Illinois pioneer and social reformer Morris Birkbeck.

<doc id="366248" wikidata="Q326163" url="?curid=366248" title="Breaststroke">
<text>Breaststroke is a swimming style in which the swimmer is on their chest and the torso does not rotate. It is the most popular recreational style due to the swimmer&#x27;s head being out of the water a large portion of the time, and that it can be swum comfortably at slow speeds. In most swimming classes, beginners learn either the breaststroke or the freestyle (front crawl) first. However, at the competitive level, swimming breaststroke at speed requires endurance and strength comparable to other strokes. Some people refer to breaststroke as the &quot;frog&quot; stroke, as the arms and legs move somewhat like a frog swimming in the water. The stroke itself is the slowest of any competitive strokes and is thought to be the oldest of all swimming strokes.

==Speed and ergonomics==
Breaststroke is the slowest of the four official styles in competitive swimming. The fastest breaststrokers can swim about 1.70 meters (~5.6 feet) per second. It is sometimes the hardest to teach to rising swimmers after butterfly due to the importance of timing and the coordination required to move the legs properly.

In the breaststroke, the swimmer leans on the chest, arms breaking the surface of the water slightly, legs always underwater and the head underwater for the second half of the stroke. The kick is sometimes referred to as a &quot;frog kick&quot; because of the resemblance to the movement of a frog&#x27;s hind legs; however, when done correctly it is more of a &quot;whip kick&quot; due to the whip-like motion that moves starting at the core down through the legs.

The body is often at a steep angle to the forward movement, which slows down the swimmer more than any other style. Professional breaststrokers use abdominal muscles and hips to add extra power to the kick, although most do not perfect this technique until they are more experienced. This much faster form of breaststroke is referred to as &quot;wave-action&quot; breaststroke and fully incorporates the whip-kick.

A special feature of competitive breaststroke is the underwater pullout. From the streamline position, one uses the arms to pull all the way down past the hips. As the arms are pulling down, one downward dolphin kick is allowed (as of the 2024 season), though still optional; more than one dolphin kick will result in disqualification. This is followed by the recovery of the arms to the streamline position once more with a breaststroke kick. The pullout is also called the &quot;pull down&quot;. The pullout at the start and after the turns contributes significantly to the swimming times. Open turns can be easily performed at the walls, but both hands must make contact with the wall. Therefore, one way to improve swimming times is to focus on the start and the turns.

Breaststroke, specifically the kick, allows you to glide underwater for much more time than any other stroke, as the kick has a lot of power and force when swimming in a pool. A competitive swimmer swimming this stroke will be underwater for a lot of the stroke due to the gliding and kicking.

==History==
The history of breaststroke could go back to the Stone Age, as possibly indicated by images in the Cave of the Swimmers near Wadi Sora in the southwestern part of Egypt near Libya. The leg action of the breaststroke may have originated by imitating the swimming action of frogs. Depictions of a variant of breaststroke are found in Babylonian bas-relief and Assyrian wall drawings.

In 1538, Nicolas Wynman, a German professor of languages and poetry, wrote the first swimming book, &quot;Colymbetes&quot;. His goal was not to promote exercise, but rather to reduce the dangers of drowning. Nevertheless, the book contained a good, methodical approach to learning breaststroke.

In 1696, the French author and poet Melchisédech Thévenot wrote &quot;The Art of Swimming&quot;, describing a breaststroke very similar to the modern breaststroke. The book (Benjamin Franklin became one of its readers) popularized this technique.

In 1774, following a series of drownings, English physician John Zehr of the Society for the Recovery of Persons Apparently Drowned began giving public speeches and demonstrations to teach proper swimming technique. He is said to have helped to popularize breaststroke, noting the ease with which it could be learned and swum.

In the pre-Olympic era, competitive swimming in Europe started around 1800, mostly using breaststroke. A watershed event was a swimming competition in 1844 in London, notable for the participation of some Native Americans. While the British raced using breaststroke, the Native Americans swam a variant of the front crawl. The British continued to swim only breaststroke until 1873.

Captain Matthew Webb was the first man to swim the English Channel (between England and France), in 1875. He used breaststroke, swimming 21.26 miles (34.21 km) in 21 hours and 45 minutes.

The 1904 Summer Olympics in St. Louis, Missouri, were the first Olympics to feature a separate breaststroke competition, over a distance of 440 yards (402 m). These games differentiated breaststroke, backstroke, and freestyle.

1928 was the start of the scientific study of swimming by David Armbruster, coach at the University of Iowa, who filmed swimmers from underwater. One breaststroke problem Armbruster researched was that the swimmer was slowed down significantly while bringing the arms forward underwater. In 1934 Armbruster refined a method to bring the arms forward over water in breaststroke. While this &quot;butterfly&quot; technique was difficult, it brought a great improvement in speed. A year later, in 1935, Jack Sieg, a swimmer also from the University of Iowa, developed a technique involving swimming on his side and beating his legs in unison similar to a fish tail, and modified the technique afterward to swim it face down. Armbruster and Sieg combined these techniques into a variant of the breaststroke called butterfly, with the two kicks per cycle being called dolphin fishtail kick. Using this technique, Sieg swam 100 yards (91 m) in 1:00.2. However, even though this technique was much faster than regular breaststroke, the dolphin fishtail kick violated the rules. Butterfly arms with a breaststroke kick were used by a few swimmers in the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin for the breaststroke competitions. In 1938, almost every breaststroke swimmer was using this butterfly style, yet this stroke was considered a variant of the breaststroke until 1952, when it was accepted as a separate style with its own set of rules.

In the early 1950s, another modification was developed for breaststroke. Breaking the water surface increases drag, reducing speed; swimming underwater increases speed. This led to a controversy at the 1956 Summer Olympics in Melbourne, when six swimmers were disqualified, as they repeatedly swam long distances underwater. However, a Japanese swimmer, Masaru Furukawa, circumvented the rule by not surfacing at all after the start, but swimming as much of the length underwater as possible before breaking the surface. He swam all but 5 m underwater for the first three 50 m lengths, and also swam half underwater for the last length, winning the gold medal. The adoption of this technique led to many swimmers suffering from oxygen starvation and even to some swimmers passing out during the race, so a new rule was introduced by the FINA, limiting the distance that can be swum underwater after the start and after every turn, and requiring the head to break the surface every cycle.

Since then, the development of breaststroke has gone hand-in-hand with the FINA rules. In about the mid-1960s, the rules changed to prevent the arm stroke from going beyond the hip line, except during the first stroke after the start and after each turn. Before 1987, the head had to be kept above the water surface during the entire stroke. Later on, swimmers were also allowed to break the water with parts of the body other than the head. This led to a variant of the stroke in which the arms are brought together as usual under the body after the pull but then are thrown forward over the water from under the chin until the arms are completely extended. There was a controversy at the 2004 Summer Olympics at Athens after Japan&#x27;s Kosuke Kitajima won the gold medal in the 100 m breaststroke race over American Brendan Hansen, the world-record-holder. Video from underwater cameras showed Kitajima using a dolphin kick at the start and at some of the turns. Officials claimed that these kicks were not visible from above the surface of the water, so the result stood. In July 2005, FINA announced a change of rules to allow one dolphin kick at the start and at each turn, the new rule took effect on 21 September 2005.

The breaststroke starts with the fly high butterfly lying in the water face down, arms extended straight forward and legs extended straight to the back.

===Arm movement===
There are three steps to the arm movement: outsweep, insweep, and recovery. The movement starts with the outsweep. From the streamline position, the palms turn out and the hands separate to slightly past shoulder width. The outsweep is followed by the insweep, where the hands point down and push the water backwards. The elbows stay in the horizontal plane through the shoulders. The hands push back until approximately the vertical plane through the shoulders. At the end of the insweep the hands come together with facing palms in front of the chest and the elbows are at the side at the body. In the recovery phase, the hands are moved forward again into the initial position under water. The entire arm stroke starts slowly, increases speed to the peak arm movement speed in the insweep phase, and slows down again during recovery. The goal is to produce maximum thrust during the insweep phase, and minimum drag during the recovery phase. Another variant is the underwater pull-down, similar to the push phase of a butterfly stroke. This stroke continues the insweep phase and pushes the hands all the way to the back to the sides of the hip. This greatly increases the push from one stroke, but also makes recovery more difficult. This style is well suited for underwater swimming. However, FINA allows this stroke only for the first stroke after the start and each turn. In late 2005, FINA has also introduced a new rule which permits a single downward kick after the push off the wall.

As a variant, it is possible to recover the arms over water. This reduces drag, but requires more power. Almost all competitive swimmers use this variant in competition.

===Leg movement===

The leg movement, colloquially known as the &quot;frog kick&quot; or &quot;whip kick&quot;, consists of two phases: bringing the feet into position for the thrust phase and the insweep phase. From the initial position with the legs stretched out backward, the feet are moved together towards the posterior, while the knees stay together. The knees should not sink too low, as this increases the drag. Then the feet point outward in preparation for the thrust phase. In the thrust phase, the legs are moved elliptically back to the initial position. During this movement, the knees are kept together. The legs move slower while bringing the legs into position for the thrust phase, and move very fast during the thrust phase. Again, the goal is to produce maximum thrust during the insweep phase, and minimise drag during the recovery phase. In the recovery phase the lower leg and the feet are in the wake of the upper leg, and the feet are pointed to the rear. In the thrust phase all three parts create their own wake, and the flat end of the feet acts like a hydrofoil aligned to give maximum forward thrust. The resulting drag coefficient (or more precisely the frontal area) is thus doubled in the thrust phase.

A fit adult creates a wake. Drag due to a wake is Newtonian drag, increasing with the square of the velocity. For example, if the relative speed between the water and the leg is twice as high on the thrust phase than on the recovery phase, the thrust is four times as high as the drag. Assuming the legs are recovered with a relative speed between leg and body which amounts to the same as the relative speed between water and body, the legs must be kicked back with five times the mean velocity of the swimmer. This limits the top speed, with both effects combined together, velocity and frontal area, yield a thrust-to-drag ratio of 8 for the legs.

As a variant, some swimmers move the knees apart during the preparation phase and keep them apart until almost the end of the thrust phase. Moving both knee and foot outwards like a real frog avoids the extreme rotation in the lower leg.

All other variants fail to increase the frontal area, yet swimmers using them still generate some thrust by the velocity variation and do not drown. Another variant of the breaststroke kick is the scissor kick, however, this kick violates the rules of the FINA as it is no longer symmetrical. Swimming teachers put a great effort into steering the students away from the scissor kick. In the scissor kick, one leg moves as described above, but the other leg does not form an elliptical movement but merely an up-down movement similar to the flutter kick of front crawl. Some swimming teachers believe that learning the front crawl first gives a higher risk of an incorrect scissor kick when learning breaststroke afterwards.

Breaststroke can also be swum with the dolphin kick in butterfly, but this also violates the FINA rules. One kick is allowed, however, at the start and at the turn, providing that it is part of the body&#x27;s natural movement.

Humans have strong muscles in the legs and would need swim fins (like a frog) to bring all their power into the water and stand with the sole of the feet on the water. Rather the leg grabs almost as much water as the foot and a small amount of water is accelerated to high kinetic energy, but not much impulse is transferred. The toes are bent, the feet point 45° outwards, the sole points backwards, to mimic a hydrofoil. While closing in a V shape to the rear a small &quot;lifting&quot; force can be felt. Unlike in the other kicks, the joints are moved into extrema. Before the kick the knee is maximally bent and the upper leg is rotating along its axis to its extreme outer position and the lower leg is twisted to extreme, at the end of the kick the ankles are maximally turned to the inside so that the soles clap together to achieve a nozzle effect like in a jelly fish. Therefore, training involves getting flexible in addition to fitness and precision. The sudden sideways stress on the knees at the kick can lead to uncomfortable noise and feeling for the beginner and to wear for the senior.

===Breathing===
The easiest way to breathe during breaststroke is to let the head follow the spine. When the swimmer&#x27;s elbows have reached the line of his eye and have begun to rise, his or her head starts to lift. If they use their high elbows as a hinge for the inward sweep of their hands and forearms, they will create the leverage they need to use their abdominal muscles to bring their hips forward. When their hips move forward, their chest, shoulders and upper back will automatically lift up. Breathing is usually done during the beginning of the insweep phase of the arms, and the swimmer breathes in ideally through the mouth. The swimmer breathes out through mouth and nose during the recovery and gliding phase. Breaststroke can be swum faster if submerged completely, but FINA requires the head to break the surface once per cycle except for the first cycle after the start and each turn. Thus, competitive swimmers usually make one underwater pull-out, pushing the hands all the way to the back after the start and each turn.

Recreational swimmers often keep their head above water at all times when they swim breaststroke.

===Body movement===
The movement starts in the initial position with the body completely straight. Body movement is coordinated such that the legs are ready for the thrust phase while the arms are halfway through the insweep, and the head is out of the water for breathing. In this position the body has also the largest angle to the horizontal. The arms are recovered during the thrust phase of the legs. After the stroke the body is kept in the initial position for some time to utilize the gliding phase. Depending on the distance and fitness the duration of this gliding phase varies. Usually the gliding phase is shorter during sprints than during long-distance swimming. The gliding phase is also longer during the underwater stroke after the start and each turn. However, the gliding phase is usually the longest phase in one entire cycle of breaststroke.

===Start===

Breaststroke uses the regular start for swimming. Some swimmers use a variant called the frog start, where the legs are pulled forward sharply before being extended again quickly during the airborne phase of the start. After the start a gliding phase follows under water, followed by one underwater pulldown and dolphin kick, then one whip kick as the hands are recovered back to a streamline. This is known as the pull-out. The head must break the surface before the arms reach their widest point on the first stroke after the pull-out. The downward butterfly kick was legalized by FINA, WWF and the NCAA in 2005, and remains optional. The downward fly kick is now allowed in MCSL.

===Turn and finish===
For competitive swimming it is important that the wall at the end of the lane is always touched by both hands (known as a &quot;Two-Hand Touch&quot;) at the same time due to FINA regulations.

The turn is initiated by touching the wall during the gliding or during the recovery phase of the arms, depending on how the wall can be touched faster. After touching the wall, the legs are pulled underneath the body. The body turns sideways while one hand is moved forward (i.e. towards the head) along the side of the body. When the body is almost completely turned, the other hand will be swung straight up through the air such that both hands meet at the front at the same time. At that time the body should also be almost in the horizontal and partially or totally submerged. After the body is completely submerged, the body is pushed off the wall with both legs. Doing this under water will reduce the drag. After a gliding phase, an underwater pull-out is done, followed by another gliding phase and then regular swimming. The head must break the surface during the second stroke.

As a variant, some swimmers experiment with a flip over turn similar to front crawl.

The finish is similar to the touching of the wall during a turn.

===Current styles===
The three main styles of breaststroke seen today are the conventional (flat), undulating, and wave-style. The undulating style is usually swum by extremely flexible swimmers, (e.g. Amanda Beard), and few people have the flexibility to accomplish it. The wave-style breaststroke was pioneered by Hungarian Swimming Coach Joseph Nagy. The wave-style was swum and made famous by Mike Barrowman when he set a world record using it, and is now commonly swum by Olympians, though Australian swimmers, most prominently Leisel Jones, generally seem to shun it. Olympian Ed Moses still swims a flatter style, despite the rapidly increasing popularity of the wave-style.

The wave-style breaststroke starts in a streamlined position, with shoulders shrugged to decrease drag in the water. While the conventional style is strongest at the outsweep, the wave-style puts much emphasis on the insweep, thus making the head rise later than in the conventional style. The wave-style pull is a circular motion with the hands accelerating to maximum speed and recovering in front of the chin, elbows staying at the surface and in front of the shoulders at all times. The high elbows creates the leverage for the powerful torso and abdominal muscles to assist in the stroke. During the insweep, the swimmer accelerates their hands and hollows their back and lifts themself out of the water to breathe. To visualize, some say that the hands anchor themselves in the water while the hips thrust forward.

The hollowed back and accelerating hands would lift the head out of the water. The head stays in a neutral position, looking down and forward, and the swimmer inhales at this point. The feet retract to the bottom without moving the thigh, thus reducing resistance. The swimmer is at their highest at this point.

Then the swimmer shrugs their shoulders and throws their arms and shoulders forward, lunging cat-like back into the water (though the emphasis is to go &quot;forward&quot;, not down). As the swimmer sinks, they arch their back, and kick. Timing is very important in order for the kick to transfer all of its force via the arched back, but the optimum time is when the arms are 3/4 extended. Then the swimmer kicks and presses on their chest, undulating a little underwater, and squeezing the gluteus maximus to prevent the legs and feet from rising out of the water. The swimmer has now returned to the streamlined position, and the cycle starts again.

Incidentally, the wave motion should not be overly emphasized and the swimmer should only rise until the water reaches his biceps, instead of pushing his entire torso out of the water, wasting a great deal of energy.

==Competitions==
There are eight common distances swum in competitive breaststroke swimming, four in yards and four in meters. Twenty-five-yard pools are common in the United States and are routinely used in age group, high school and college competitions during the winter months.

*25 yd Breaststroke (age group and club swimming for children 8 and under)
*50 yd Breaststroke (age group swimming for children 12 and under)
*100 yd Breaststroke
*200 yd Breaststroke

Twenty-five meter or 50 meter pool distances
*25 m Breaststroke (age group and club swimming for children 8 and under, 25 meter pool only, and not swum in year-around swimming)
*50 m Breaststroke (age group and club swimming for children 12 and under)
*100 m Breaststroke
*200 m Breaststroke

Breaststroke is also part of the medley over the following distances:
*100 yd Individual Medley
*200 yd Individual Medley
*400 yd Individual Medley
*4 × 50 yd Medley Relay
*4 × 100 yd Medley Relay
*100 m Individual Medley (short 25 m pool only)
*200 m Individual Medley
*400 m Individual Medley
*4 × 50 m Medley Relay
*4 × 100 m Medley Relay 
Occasionally other distances are swum on an ad hoc, unofficial basis (such as 400 yd breaststroke in some college dual meets).

==FINA rules==
These are the official FINA rules. They apply to swimmers during official swimming competitions.

SW 7.1 After the start and after each turn, the swimmer may take one arm stroke completely back to the legs during which the swimmer may be submerged. At any time prior to the first Breaststroke kick after the start and after each turn a single butterfly kick is permitted.

SW 7.2 From the beginning of the first arm stroke after the start and after each turn, the body shall be on the breast. It is not permitted to roll onto the back at any time. From the start and throughout the race the stroke cycle must be one arm stroke and one leg kick in that order. All movements of the arms shall be simultaneous and on the same horizontal plane without alternating movement.

SW 7.3 The hands shall be pushed forward together from the breast on, under, or over the water. The elbows shall be under water except for the final stroke before the turn, during the turn and for the final stroke at the finish. The hands shall be brought back on or under the surface of the water. The hands shall not be brought back beyond the hip line, except during the first stroke after the start and each turn.

SW 7.4 During each complete cycle, some part of the swimmer&#x27;s head must break the surface of the water. The head must break the surface of the water before the hands turn inward at the widest part of the second stroke. All movements of the legs shall be simultaneous and on the same horizontal plane without alternating movement.

SW 7.5 The feet must be turned outwards during the propulsive part of the kick. A scissors, flutter or downward butterfly kick is not permitted except as in SW 7.1. Breaking the surface of the water with the feet is allowed unless followed by a downward butterfly kick.

SW 7.6 At each turn and at the finish of the race, the touch shall be made with both hands simultaneously at, above, or below the water level. The head may be submerged after the last arm pull prior to the touch, provided it breaks the surface of the water at some point during the last complete or incomplete cycle preceding the touch.

<doc id="366253" wikidata="Q741979" url="?curid=366253" title="Extremely low frequency">
<text>Extremely low frequency (ELF) is the ITU designation for electromagnetic radiation (radio waves) with frequencies from 3 to 30 Hz, and corresponding wavelengths of 100,000 to 10,000 kilometers, respectively. In atmospheric science, an alternative definition is usually given, from 3 Hz to 3 kHz. In the related magnetosphere science, the lower-frequency electromagnetic oscillations (pulsations occurring below ~3 Hz) are considered to lie in the ULF range, which is thus also defined differently from the ITU radio bands.

ELF radio waves are generated by lightning and natural disturbances in Earth&#x27;s magnetic field, so they are a subject of research by atmospheric scientists. Because of the difficulty of building antennas that can radiate such long waves, ELF have been used in only a very few human-made communication systems. ELF waves can penetrate seawater, which makes them useful in communication with submarines, and a few nations have built military ELF transmitters to transmit signals to their submerged submarines, consisting of huge grounded wire antennas (ground dipoles) long driven by transmitters producing megawatts of power. The United States, Russia, India, and China are the only countries known to have constructed these ELF communication facilities. The U.S. facilities were used between 1985 and 2004 but are now decommissioned.

==Alternative definitions==
ELF is a &quot;subradio frequency&quot;. Some medical peer reviewed journal articles refer to ELF in the context of &quot;extremely low frequency (ELF) magnetic fields (MF)&quot; with frequencies of 50 Hz and 50–80 Hz. United States
Government agencies, such as NASA, describe ELF as non-ionizing radiation with frequencies between 0 and 300 Hz. The World Health Organization (WHO) have used ELF to refer to the concept of &quot;extremely low frequency (ELF) electric and magnetic fields (EMF)&quot;. The WHO also stated that at frequencies between 0 and 300 Hz, &quot;the wavelengths in air are very long ( at 50 Hz and at 60 Hz), and, in practical situations, the electric and magnetic fields act independently of one another and are measured separately&quot;.

==Propagation==
Due to their extremely long wavelength, ELF waves can diffract around large obstacles, are not blocked by mountain ranges or the horizon, and can travel around the curvature of the Earth. ELF and VLF waves propagate long distances by an Earth–ionosphere waveguide mechanism. 
The Earth is surrounded by a layer of charged particles (ions and electrons) in the atmosphere at an altitude of about at the bottom of the ionosphere, called the D layer, which reflects ELF waves. The space between the conductive Earth&#x27;s surface and the conductive D layer acts as a parallel-plate waveguide which confines ELF waves, allowing them to propagate long distances without escaping into space. In contrast to VLF waves, the height of the layer is much less than one wavelength at ELF frequencies, so the only mode that can propagate at ELF frequencies is the TEM mode in vertical polarization, with the electric field vertical and the magnetic field horizontal. ELF waves have extremely low attenuation of 1–2 dB per , giving a single transmitter the potential to communicate worldwide.

ELF waves can also travel considerable distances through &quot;lossy&quot; media like earth and seawater, which would absorb or reflect higher-frequency radio waves.

===Schumann resonances===

The attenuation of ELF waves is so low that they can travel completely around the Earth several times before decaying to negligible amplitude, and thus waves radiated from a source in opposite directions circumnavigating the Earth on a great circle path interfere with each other. At certain frequencies these oppositely directed waves are in phase and add (reinforce), causing standing waves. In other words, the closed spherical Earth–ionosphere cavity acts as a huge cavity resonator, enhancing ELF radiation at its resonant frequencies. These are called Schumann resonances after German physicist Winfried Otto Schumann, who predicted them in 1952, and were detected in the 1950s. Modeling the Earth–ionosphere cavity with perfectly conducting walls, Schumann calculated the resonances should occur at frequencies of
: formula_1

The actual frequencies differ slightly from this due to the conduction properties of the ionosphere. The fundamental Schumann resonance is at approximately 7.83 Hz, the frequency at which the wavelength equals the circumference of the Earth, and higher harmonics occur at 14.1, 20.3, 26.4, and 32.4 Hz, etc. Lightning strikes excite these resonances, causing the Earth–ionosphere cavity to &quot;ring&quot; like a bell, resulting in a peak in the noise spectrum at these frequencies, so the Schumann resonances can be used to monitor global thunderstorm activity.

Interest in Schumann resonances was renewed in 1993 when E. R. Williams showed a correlation between the resonance frequency and tropical air temperatures, suggesting that the resonance could be used to monitor global warming.

==Submarine communications==
Since ELF radio waves can penetrate seawater deeply, to the operating depths of submarines, a few nations have built naval ELF transmitters to communicate with their submarines while submerged. It was reported in 2018 that China had constructed the world&#x27;s largest ELF facility roughly the size of New York City in order to communicate with its submarine forces without requiring them to surface. The United States Navy in 1982 built the first ELF submarine communications facility, two coupled ELF transmitters at Clam Lake, Wisconsin, and Republic, Michigan. They were shut down in 2004. The Russian Navy operates an ELF transmitter called ZEVS (Zeus) at Murmansk on the Kola Peninsula. The Indian Navy has an ELF communication facility at the INS Kattabomman naval base to communicate with its Arihant-class and Akula-class submarines.

===Explanation===
Because of its electrical conductivity, seawater shields submarines from most higher-frequency radio waves, making radio communication with submerged submarines at ordinary frequencies impossible. Signals in the ELF frequency range, however, can penetrate much deeper. Two factors limit the usefulness of ELF communications channels: the low data transmission rate of a few characters per minute and, to a lesser extent, the one-way nature due to the impracticality of installing an antenna of the required size on a submarine (the antenna needs to be of an exceptional size in order to achieve successful communication). Generally, ELF signals have been used to order a submarine to rise to a shallow depth where it could receive some other form of communication.

===Difficulties of ELF communication===
One of the difficulties posed when broadcasting in the ELF frequency range is antenna size, because the length of the antenna must be at least a substantial fraction of the length of the waves. For example, a 3 Hz signal has a wavelength equal to the distance electromagnetic waves travel through a given medium in one third of a second. When the refractive index of the medium is greater than one, ELF waves propagate slower than the speed of light in vacuum. As used in military applications, the wavelength is per second divided by 50–85 Hz, which equals around long. This is comparable to the Earth&#x27;s diameter of around . Because of this huge size requirement, to transmit internationally using ELF frequencies, the Earth itself forms a significant part of the antenna, and extremely long leads into the ground are necessary. Various means, such as electrical lengthening, are used to construct practical radio stations with smaller sizes.

The United States maintained two sites: in the Chequamegon-Nicolet National Forest, Wisconsin, and in the Escanaba River State Forest, Michigan (originally named Project Sanguine, then downsized and renamed Project ELF prior to construction), until they were dismantled, beginning in late September 2004. Both sites used long power lines, so-called ground dipoles, as leads. These leads were in multiple strands ranging from long. Because of the inefficiency of this method, considerable amounts of electrical power were required to operate the system.

==Other uses==
Transmitters in the 22 Hz range are also used in pipeline maintenance, or pigging. The signal is generated as an alternating magnetic field, and the transmitter is mounted to, or to part of, the &quot;pig&quot;, the cleaning device inserted into the pipe. The pig is pushed through a mostly metal pipeline. The ELF signal can be detected through the metal, allowing its location to be detected by receivers located outside of the pipe. It is used to check whether a pig has passed a certain location or to locate a stuck pig.

Some radio hobbyists record ELF signals using antennas ranging in size from 18-inch active antennas up to several thousand feet in length taking advantage of fences, highway guard rails, and even decommissioned railroad tracks. They then replay them at higher speeds to more easily observe natural low-frequency fluctuations in the Earth&#x27;s electromagnetic field. Increasing the playback speed increases the pitch, bringing the tone into the audio frequency range.

Since the 2000s, very low frequencies have been used successfully at sea for oil geophysical prospecting.

==Natural sources==
Naturally occurring ELF waves are present on Earth, resonating in the region between ionosphere and surface seen in lightning strikes that make electrons in the atmosphere oscillate. Although signals generated from lightning discharges were predominantly VLF, it was found that an observable ELF component (slow tail) followed the VLF component in almost all cases. Also, the fundamental mode of the Earth–ionosphere cavity has the wavelength equal to the circumference of the Earth, which gives a resonance frequency of 7.8 Hz. This frequency, and higher resonance modes of 14, 20, 26, and 32 Hz, appear as peaks in the ELF spectrum and are called Schumann resonance.

ELF waves have also been tentatively identified on Saturn&#x27;s moon Titan. Titan&#x27;s surface is thought to be a poor reflector of ELF waves, so the waves may instead be reflecting from the liquid–ice boundary of a subsurface ocean of water and ammonia, the existence of which is predicted by some theoretical models. Titan&#x27;s ionosphere is also more complex than Earth&#x27;s, with the main ionosphere at an altitude of but with an additional layer of charged particles at . This splits Titan&#x27;s atmosphere into two separate resonating chambers. The source of natural ELF waves on Titan is unclear, as there does not appear to be extensive lightning activity.

Huge ELF radiation power outputs of 100,000 times the Sun&#x27;s output in visible light may be radiated by magnetars. The pulsar in the Crab nebula radiates powers of this order at 30 Hz. Radiation of this frequency is below the plasma frequency of the interstellar medium, thus this medium is opaque to it, and it cannot be observed from Earth.

==Exposure==
In electromagnetic therapy and electromagnetic radiation and health research, electromagnetic spectrum frequencies between 0 and 100 hertz are considered extremely low-frequency fields. A common source of exposure of the public to ELF fields is 50 or 60 Hz electric and magnetic fields from high-voltage electric power transmission lines and secondary distribution lines, such as those supplying electricity to residential neighborhoods.

==Conspiracy theories==
Since the late 1970s, various conspiracy theories have risen around exposure to ELF electric and magnetic fields (EMF). External ELF magnetic fields induce electric fields and currents in the body, which, at very high field strengths, may cause nerve and muscle stimulation and changes in nerve cell excitability in the central nervous system.

ELF at human-perceivable kV/m levels was said to create an annoying tingling sensation in the areas of the body in contact with clothing, particularly the arms, due to the induction of a surface charge by the ELF. Of the volunteers, 7% described the spark discharges as painful when the subject was well-insulated and touched a grounded object within a 5 kV/m field, whereas 50% described a similar spark discharge as painful in a 10 kV/m field.

===Leukemia===
There is high uncertainty regarding correlations between long-term, low-level exposure to ELF fields and a number of health effects, including leukemia in children. In October 2005, WHO convened a task group of scientific experts to assess any risks to health that might exist from &quot;exposure to ELF electric and magnetic fields in the frequency range &gt;0 to 100,000 Hz (100 kHz) in regards to childhood leukemia&quot;. The long-term, low-level exposure is evaluated as average exposure to residential power-frequency magnetic field above 0.3–0.4 μT, and it is estimated that only between 1% and 4% of children live in such conditions. Subsequently, in 2010, a pooled analysis of epidemiological evidence supported the hypothesis that exposure to power-frequency magnetic fields is related to childhood leukemia.

No other study has found any evidence to support the hypothesis that ELF exposure is a contributing factor to leukemia in children.

A 2014 study estimated the cases of childhood leukemia attributable to exposure to ELF magnetic fields in the European Union (EU27), assuming that correlations seen in epidemiological studies were causal. It reported that around 50–60 cases of childhood leukemia might be attributable to ELF magnetic fields annually, corresponding to between ~1.5% and ~2.0% of all incident cases of childhood leukemia occurring in the EU27 each year. At present, however, ICNIRP and IEEE consider the scientific evidence related to possible health effects from long-term, low-level exposure to ELF fields insufficient to justify lowering these quantitative exposure limits. In summary, when all of the studies are evaluated together, the evidence suggesting that EMFs may contribute to an increased risk of cancer is non-existent. Epidemiological studies suggest a possible association between long-term occupational exposure to ELF and Alzheimer&#x27;s disease.

===Ecological impact===
There have been some concerns over the possible ecological impact of ELF signals. In 1984 a federal judge halted construction, requiring more environmental and health studies. This judgment was overruled by a federal appeals court on the basis that the US Navy claimed to have spent over $25 million studying the effects of the electromagnetic fields, with results indicating that they were similar to the effect produced by standard power-distribution lines. However, during the time that ELF was in use, some Wisconsin politicians, such as Democratic Senators Herb Kohl, Russ Feingold and Congressman Dave Obey, continued to call for its closure.

Extremely low frequency (ELF) electromagnetic fields (EMFs), typically ranging from 0.3 Hz to 300 Hz, have various ecological impacts on both flora and fauna.

<text>Thomas Edward Bosley (October 1, 1927 – October 19, 2010) was an American actor, television personality and entertainer. Bosley is best known for portraying Howard Cunningham on the ABC sitcom &quot;Happy Days&quot; (1974–1984) for which he received a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series nomination. Bosley also did a variety of voiceover work such as playing the lead character in the animated series &quot;Wait Till Your Father Gets Home&quot;, and the narrator of the syndicated film history documentary series &quot;That&#x27;s Hollywood&quot;. He was also known for his role as Sheriff Amos Tupper in the Angela Lansbury lead CBS mystery series &quot;Murder, She Wrote&quot; (1984–1988), and as the title character in the NBC/ABC series &quot;Father Dowling Mysteries&quot; (1989–1991).

Known for his work on stage, he originated the role of Fiorello La Guardia in the Broadway musical &quot;Fiorello!&quot;, earning the 1960 Tony Award for Best Performance by a Featured Actor in a Musical. He&#x27;s also known for his film appearances in &quot;Love with the Proper Stranger&quot; (1963), &quot;The World of Henry Orient&quot; (1964), &quot;Divorce American Style&quot; (1967), &quot;Yours, Mine and Ours&quot;, &quot;The Secret War of Harry Frigg&quot; (both 1968), &quot;Gus&quot; (1976), and &quot;The Back-up Plan&quot; (2010).

Bosley made his television debut as the Knave of Hearts in the NBC adaptation of &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot; in 1955. He gained attention as a character actor performing various roles in shows such as &quot;Naked City&quot;, &quot;Profiles in Courage&quot;, &quot;The Defenders&quot;, &quot;Night Gallery&quot;, &quot;Get Smart&quot;, &quot;Bewitched&quot;, and &quot;&quot;.

==Early life==
Born and raised in Chicago, Bosley was the son of Dora (née Heyman) and Benjamin Bosley. Although well known for playing a Catholic priest and Protestant patriarchs, Bosley was actually Jewish.

==Career==
===Early roles and stage roles===
Bosley played the Knave of Hearts in a &quot;Hallmark Hall of Fame&quot; telecast of Eva Le Gallienne&#x27;s production of &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot; in 1955. But his breakthrough stage role was New York mayor Fiorello H. La Guardia in the long-running Broadway musical &quot;Fiorello!&quot; (1959), for which he won a Tony Award.

Among his early television appearances was in 1960 on the CBS summer replacement series, &quot;&quot;, with Patrick O&#x27;Neal. In 1962, he portrayed Assistant District Attorney Ryan in the episode &quot;The Man Who Wanted to Die&quot; on James Whitmore&#x27;s ABC legal drama &quot;The Law and Mr. Jones&quot;. Also in 1962, Bosley played Teddy opposite Tony Randall and Boris Karloff in &quot;Arsenic &amp; Old Lace&quot; for the &quot;Hallmark Hall of Fame&quot;. About this time, he was a guest star on the NBC police sitcom, &quot;Car 54, Where Are You?&quot;. In June 1964, he appeared on the satirical television comedy revue, &quot;That Was the Week That Was&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;youtube/NBC/TWTWTW&quot;&gt;
*
&lt;/ref&gt;

He also appeared on episodes of &quot;Bonanza&quot;, &quot;Bewitched&quot;, &quot;Get Smart&quot;, &quot;The Silent Force&quot;, &quot;The Streets of San Francisco&quot;, &quot;Night Gallery&quot;, &quot;A Touch of Grace&quot;, and &quot;The Love Boat&quot;. In 1969, Bosley appeared in a comical episode of &quot;The Virginian&quot;, titled &quot;Crime Wave in Buffalo Springs,&quot; appearing alongside fellow guest-stars James Brolin, Yvonne De Carlo, Carrie Snodgress, Gary Vinson, with &quot;Virginian&quot; regulars David Hartman and Doug McClure.

Bosley&#x27;s first motion picture role was in 1963, as the would-be suitor of Natalie Wood in &quot;Love with the Proper Stranger.&quot; Other films include &quot;The World of Henry Orient&quot;; &quot;Divorce American Style&quot;; &quot;Yours, Mine and Ours&quot;; &quot;Gus&quot; and the made-for-television &quot;The Triangle Factory Fire Scandal&quot;. Bosley shared a heartfelt story about his own experience with the Holocaust in the documentary film &quot;Paper Clips&quot;.

In 1994, he originated the role of Maurice in the Broadway version of Disney&#x27;s &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot;. Bosley toured as Cap&#x27;n Andy in Harold Prince&#x27;s 1994 revival of &quot;Show Boat&quot;.

===&quot;Happy Days&quot; and other film and television roles===
Bosley&#x27;s best-known role was the character Howard Cunningham in the sitcom &quot;Happy Days&quot;. He portrayed Sheriff Amos Tupper on &quot;Murder, She Wrote&quot; and the eponymous Father Frank Dowling on &quot;Father Dowling Mysteries&quot;. Among myriad television appearances, one notable early performance was in the &quot;Eyes&quot; segment of the 1969 pilot of Rod Serling&#x27;s &quot;Night Gallery&quot;, directed by Steven Spielberg and starring Joan Crawford. In 1977, he appeared in the miniseries &quot;Testimony of Two Men&quot; and, in 1978, he played the role of Benjamin Franklin in the television mini-series &quot;The Bastard&quot;, a role he replayed the following year in the sequel &quot;The Rebels&quot;.

His film appearances included roles in &quot;Love with the Proper Stranger&quot; (1963), &quot;The World of Henry Orient&quot; (1964), &quot;Divorce American Style&quot; (1967), &quot;Bang Bang Kid&quot; (1967), &quot;The Secret War of Harry Frigg&quot; (1968), &quot;Yours, Mine and Ours&quot; (1968), &quot;To Find a Man&quot; (1972), &quot;Mixed Company&quot; (1974), &quot;The Night That Panicked America&quot; (1975), &quot;Gus&quot; (1976), &quot;The Triangle Factory Fire Scandal&quot; (1979), &quot;O&#x27;Hara&#x27;s Wife&quot; (1982), &quot;Million Dollar Mystery&quot; (1987), and &quot;Wicked Stepmother&quot; (1989).

Bosley starred in the 2008 Hallmark Channel television movie &quot;Charlie &amp; Me&quot;. In 2010, he appeared in &quot;The Back-up Plan&quot; and &quot;Santa Buddies&quot;, which were his final films. In 1984, he guest-hosted the Macy&#x27;s Fourth of July Fireworks Spectacular with local newscaster Pat Harper.

===Voice-over roles===
Bosley was known for his unique gravelly voice, leading to a number of voice acting roles. He narrated the syndicated television documentary &quot;That&#x27;s Hollywood&quot; (1976–82). He hosted &quot;The General Mills Radio Adventure Theater&quot;, a 1977 radio drama series for children. He voiced many cartoon characters, including Harry Boyle in the animated series &quot;Wait Till Your Father Gets Home&quot;. Bosley was the voice of B.A.H. Humbug in the 1978 Rankin &amp; Bass holiday special &quot;The Stingiest Man in Town&quot;. He provided the voice of the title character in the 1980s cartoon &quot;The World of David the Gnome&quot; and the shop owner Mr. Winkle in the children&#x27;s Christmas special &quot;The Tangerine Bear&quot;.

===Endorsements===

From the 1950s through the 1990s, Bosley appeared in numerous television commercials including Studebaker automobiles (1956), and Glad sandwich and garbage bags. He appeared in radio commercials for the new Saturn car company, a &quot;different kind of car company,&quot; in 1990. Later in life, he was the television spokesman for SMC (Specialty Merchandise Corporation), a national wholesaler and drop shipper.

Bosley was a spokesman for YES Entertainment Network, Inc., a fraudulent internet firm scheme that defrauded $13 million from investors around the country in the late 1990s.
==Death==
Bosley died from complications of a staph infection on October 19, 2010, at a hospital in Rancho Mirage, California, near his home in Palm Springs, California. His agent, Sheryl Abrams, said Bosley had been battling lung cancer. He was survived by his wife, former actress Patricia Carr, and daughter Amy Bosley Baer, who married Matthew Baer, son of Richard Baer.

==&quot;Happy Days&quot; lawsuit==
On April 19, 2011, Bosley&#x27;s estate and four of his &quot;Happy Days&quot; co-stars, Erin Moran, Don Most, Marion Ross, and Anson Williams, filed a $10 million breach-of-contract lawsuit against CBS, which owns the show, claiming they had not been paid for merchandising revenues owed under their contracts. The cast members claimed they had not received revenues from show-related items, including comic books, T-shirts, scrapbooks, trading cards, games, lunchboxes, dolls, toy cars, magnets, greeting cards, and DVDs where their images appear on the box covers. Under their contracts, they were supposed to be paid five percent from the net proceeds of merchandising if their sole image were used, and half that amount if they were in a group. CBS said it owed the actors $8,500 and $9,000 each, most of it from slot machine revenues, but the group said they were owed millions. The lawsuit was initiated after Ross was informed by a friend playing slots at a casino of a &quot;Happy Days&quot; machine on which players win the jackpot when five Marion Cunninghams (Ross&#x27;s character on &quot;Happy Days&quot;) are rolled.

In October 2011, a judge rejected the group&#x27;s fraud claim, which if proved could have garnered them millions of dollars in punitive damages, above and beyond any actual damages proven. On June 5, 2012, a judge denied a motion filed by CBS to have the case thrown out, which meant it would go to trial on July 17 if the matter was not settled by then. In July 2012, the actors settled their lawsuit with CBS. Each received a payment of $65,000 and a promise by CBS to continue honoring the terms of their contracts.

<doc id="366267" wikidata="Q444164" url="?curid=366267" title="William Swainson">
<text>William Swainson FLS, FRS (8 October 1789 – 6 December 1855), was an English ornithologist, malacologist, conchologist, entomologist, and artist. A prolific collector of natural history specimens he produced an influential illustrated classification of birds based on the quinarian system that was then in fashion. He settled in New Zealand in later life.

==Life==
Swainson was born in Dover Place, St Mary Newington, London, the eldest son of John Timothy Swainson (1756–1824), an original fellow of the Linnean Society. He was cousin of the amateur botanist Isaac Swainson. His father&#x27;s family originated in Lancashire, and both grandfather and father held high posts in Her Majesty&#x27;s Customs, the father becoming Collector at Liverpool.

William, whose formal education was curtailed because of an impediment in his speech, joined the Liverpool Customs as a junior clerk at the age of 14. He joined the Army Commissariat and toured Malta and Sicily He studied the ichthyology of western Sicily and in 1815, was forced by ill health to return to England where he subsequently retired on half pay. William followed in his father&#x27;s footsteps to become a fellow of the Linnean Society in 1815.

In 1816, he accompanied the English explorer Henry Koster to Brazil. Koster had lived in Brazil for some years and had become famous for his book &quot;Travels in Brazil&quot; (1816). There he met Dr Grigori Ivanovitch Langsdorff, also an explorer of Brazil, and Russian Consul General. They did not spend a long time on shore because of a revolution, but Swainson returned to England in 1818 in his words &quot;a bee loaded with honey&quot;, with a collection of over 20,000 insects, 1,200 species of plants, drawings of 120 species of fish, and about 760 bird skins.

Swainson was a member of learned societies, including the Wernerian Society of Edinburgh. He was elected a fellow of the Royal Society after his return from Brazil on 14 December 1820, and married his first wife Mary Parkes in 1823, with whom he had four sons (William John, George Frederick, Henry Gabriel and Edwin Newcombe) and a daughter (Mary Frederica). His wife Mary died in 1835.

Swainson remarried in 1840 to Anne Grasby, and emigrated to New Zealand in 1841. Two of their daughters were married in 1863: Edith Stanway Swainson married Arthur Halcombe, and Lucelle Frances Swainson married Richmond Beetham. Swainson was involved in property management and natural history-related publications from 1841 to 1855, and forestry-related investigations in Tasmania, New South Wales, and Victoria from 1851 to 1853. Swainson died at Fern Grove, Lower Hutt, New Zealand, on 6 December 1855.

==Works on natural history==

Swainson was at times quite critical of the works of others and, later in life, others in turn became quite critical of him.

Apart from the common and scientific names of many species, it is for the quality of his illustrations that he is best remembered. His friend William Elford Leach, head of zoology at the British Museum, encouraged him to experiment with lithography for his book &quot;Zoological Illustrations&quot; (1820–23). Swainson became the first illustrator and naturalist to use lithography, which was a relatively cheap means of reproduction and did not require an engraver. He began publishing many illustrated works, mostly serially. Subscribers received and paid for fascicles, small sections of the books, as they came out, so that the cash flow was constant and could be reinvested in the preparation of subsequent parts. As book orders arrived, the monochrome lithographs were hand-coloured, according to colour reference images, known as &#x27;pattern plates&#x27;, which were produced by Swainson himself. It was his early adoption of this new technology and his natural skill of illustration that in large part led to his fame.

When in March 1822 Leach was forced to resign from the British Museum due to ill health, Swainson applied to replace him, but the post was given to John George Children. Soon after his first marriage in 1823, Swainson visited Paris and formed friendships with Georges Cuvier, Étienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire, and other eminent French naturalists. Upon his return to London, he was employed by Messrs. Longman as editor for the natural history departments of Lardner&#x27;s &quot;Cabinet Cyclopedia&quot;. Swainson continued with his writing, the most influential of which was the second volume of &quot;Fauna Boreali-Americana&quot; (1831), which he wrote with John Richardson. This series (1829–1837) was the first illustrated zoological study funded in part by the British government. He also produced a second series of &quot;Zoological Illustrations&quot; (1832–33), three volumes of William Jardine&#x27;s &quot;Naturalist&#x27;s Library&quot;, and eleven volumes of Lardner&#x27;s &quot;Cabinet Cyclopedia&quot;; he had signed a contract with the London publishers Longman to produce fourteen illustrated volumes of 300 pages in this series, one to be produced quarterly.
=== Classification ===
In 1819, William Sharp Macleay had published his ideas of the Quinarian system of biological classification, and Swainson soon became a noted and outspoken proponent. The Quinarian System fell out of favour, giving way to the rising popularity of the geographical theory of Hugh Edwin Strickland. Swainson was overworked by Dionysius Lardner, the publisher of the &quot;Cabinet Cyclopaedia&quot; and both Swainson and Macleay were derided for their support of the Quinarian system. Both proponents left Britain; Swainson emigrated to New Zealand and Macleay to Australia. An American visiting Australasia in the 1850s heard to his surprise that both Macleay and Swainson were living there, and imagined that they had been exiled to the Antipodes. &#x27;for the great crime of burdening zoology with a false though much laboured theory which has thrown so much confusion into the subject of its classification and philosophical study&#x27;.

==New Zealand estate==
In 1839, he became a member of the committee of the New Zealand Company and of the Church of England committee for the appointment of a bishop to New Zealand, bought land in Wellington, and gave up scientific literary work. He married his second wife, Anne Grasby, in 1840. He was apparently the first Fellow of the Royal Society to move to New Zealand. He was later made an honorary Fellow of the Royal Society of Tasmania.

Together with most of his children from his first marriage, they sailed for New Zealand in the &quot;Jane&quot;, reaching Wellington, in the summer of 1841. The trip was not without incident, as the boat suffered damage en route and was in such a poor state that there was legal action on arrival. He purchased in the Hutt Valley from the New Zealand Company, and established his estate of &quot;Hawkshead&quot;. Not coincidentally, this name was shared by an ancestral home in Hawkshead, Lancashire, of the Swainson family, which was the birthplace of Isaac Swainson. After a few months, this estate was claimed by a Māori chief, Taringakuri, which led to years of uncertainty and threat. He was an officer in a militia against in the Māoris in 1846. During these times he was largely dependent on his half pay.

==Botanical studies in Australia==
In 1851, Swainson sailed to Sydney and he took the post of Botanical Surveyor in 1852 with the Victoria Government, after being invited by the Lieutenant-Governor Charles La Trobe to study local trees. He finished his report in 1853 in which he claimed a grand total of 1520 species and varieties of Eucalyptidae. He identified so many species of Casuarina that he ran out of names for them.

While having quite some expertise in zoology, his untrained foray into botany was not well received. William Jackson Hooker wrote to Ferdinand von Mueller: In my life I think I never read such a series of trash and nonsense. There is a man who left this country with the character of a first rate naturalist (though with many eccentricities) and of a very first-rate Natural History artist and he goes to Australia and takes up the subject of Botany, of which he is as ignorant as a goose.
 Joseph Maiden described Swainson&#x27;s efforts as an exhibition of reckless species-making that, as far as I know stands unparalleled in the annals of botanical literature.

He had studied the flora of New South Wales, Victoria and Tasmania before his return to New Zealand in 1854 to live at Fern Grove in the Hutt, where he died the following year.

In 1856, a poem was written by the New Zealand poet William Golder in his memory. His standard botanical abbreviation is .

==Eponymous taxa==
Many birds retain a common name after Swainson, several of which were named by famous naturalists of the period. Many species or subspecies retain his name, although many of his own species were later discredited or merged with others. The genus &quot;Swainsona&quot; is named after his cousin Isaac Swainson (1746–1812).
*John James Audubon named Swainson&#x27;s warbler &quot;Limnothlypis swainsonii&quot;
*Charles Lucien Bonaparte named Swainson&#x27;s hawk &quot;Buteo swainsoni&quot;

<doc id="366270" wikidata="Q489768" url="?curid=366270" title="Corniche">
<text>A corniche is a road on the side of a cliff or mountain, with the ground rising up on one side of the roadway and falling away on the other. The English language has adopted the word from the French term &#x27; or &quot;road on a ledge&quot;, itself derived from the [[Italian language|Italian]]&#x27;, for &quot;ledge&quot;.

==Europe==
===France===
Three famed corniche roads of the Côte d&#x27;Azur in the French Riviera run between the sea and mountains from Nice eastward toward Menton. They are known as the &#x27; (or &#x27;) along the coast, the &quot; slightly inland, and the
&quot; along the upper cliffs.

The &#x27; passes through the principality of Monaco. The &#x27; featured prominently in the Alfred Hitchcock film &quot;To Catch a Thief&quot;.

===Italy===
The Amalfi Drive, along the Amalfi Coast south of Naples, is a road carved into the cliffs along the Tyrrhenian Sea, and can be classified as a corniche. It runs between Sorrento and Amalfi and was originally built by the Romans.

==Africa==
===Senegal===
The coastal road facing the Atlantic Ocean in the capital city of Dakar is called the &quot;Corniche Ouest&quot; and runs along a cliff above the beaches and rocky shores.

===South Africa===
Many of the roads running around the Cape Peninsular, south of Cape Town, have been constructed in the form of corniches. A good example is part of Victoria Road running through the suburbs of Clifton and Bantry Bay.

===Libya===
The Tripoli Corniche, also known as Al-Fatah Street, runs along the Mediterranean from the Waddan Bridge to the roundabout at Tripoli&#x27;s sea port entrance.

===Egypt===
Any waterfront passage along a body of water is classed as a corniche in Egypt. Most Nile valley and Delta cities overlooking the 1000km river course and two branches in the country have one or two corniche streets (east and/or west banks). For example &quot;Corniche Giza&quot; and &quot;Corniche Cairo&quot;, the longest Egyptian corniche. Other cities such as Mansoura, Damietta and Luxor also have corniches.

* The 18km Corniche al-Nil Street (Arabic: شارع كورنيش النيل) promenade in Cairo (east bank of the Nile) runs from the Maadi district in the south, to the mouth of the Ismailia Canal in al-Sahel district in the north. Building numbers take on one to two digits in Maadi where numbering starts, where for example the Holiday Inn hotel is 29 A Corniche al-Nile, and up to four digits in the northern half due to it length, where the Ramses Hilton hotel&#x27;s address in Bulaq is 1115 Corniche al-Nil. The street colloquially takes on the names of some of the districts and neighbourhoods it passes through such as the Maadi Corniche, and Corniche Masr al-Qadima (Old Cairo).
* The promenade that runs from the Giza Zoo to the balloon theater in Agouza is colloquially known as the Giza Corniche.
* The promenade running from Montazah Palace walls to the Qaitbay Citadel in Alexandria is known as Corniche (Alexandria)
Though the word itself comes from French, the Egyptian usage has led neighboring Arab countries, which are not francophone and have no French influence, to adopt the word. These include Sudan, Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Qatar.
==Middle East==

===Qatar===
This is a waterfront promenade extending for seven kilometres (4.3 mi) along Doha Bay in Qatar&#x27;s capital city, Doha. Annual celebrations of national holidays such as Qatar National Day and National Sports Day are centered on the Doha Corniche. It is a popular tourist and leisure attraction within Qatar.

===Lebanon===
The avenue that runs along the western and northern coast of the Beirut peninsula is colloquially called Corniche Beirut.

===Oman===
The promenade along the waterfront in Muttrah, Muscat, is known as The Corniche.

===United Arab Emirates===

* The promenade that runs from the Emirates Palace hotel to the fish market in Abu Dhabi is colloquially called the Corniche.
*in Ajman, the corniche is the road that runs from Ajman Beach to ajman marina, with the beautiful skyline of the city and the tall skyscrapers thar stand along the road.
* In Sharjah, the road surrounding Khalid Lagoon is known as Buheira Corniche, though not a true corniche as it is near sea level and not following a cliff line. 
* Several other waterfront roads and promenades in the Emirates are also referred to as Corniche, including the Deira Corniche, Fujairah Corniche, and the Jumeirah Corniche.

<text>Brickwork is masonry produced by a bricklayer, using bricks and mortar. Typically, rows of bricks called &quot;courses&quot; are laid on top of one another to build up a structure such as a brick wall.

Bricks may be differentiated from blocks by size. For example, in the UK a brick is defined as a unit having dimensions less than and a block is defined as a unit having one or more dimensions greater than the largest possible brick.

Brick is a popular medium for constructing buildings, and examples of brickwork are found through history as far back as the Bronze Age. The fired-brick faces of the ziggurat of ancient Dur-Kurigalzu in Iraq date from around 1400 BC, and the brick buildings of ancient Mohenjo-daro in modern day Pakistan were built around 2600 BC. Much older examples of brickwork made with dried (but not fired) bricks may be found in such ancient locations as Jericho in Palestine, Çatal Höyük in Anatolia, and Mehrgarh in Pakistan. These structures have survived from the Stone Age to the modern day.
Brick dimensions are expressed in construction or technical documents in two ways as co-ordinating dimensions and working dimensions.
* Coordination dimensions are the actual physical dimensions of the brick with the mortar required on one header face, one stretcher face and one bed.
* Working dimensions is the size of a manufactured brick. It is also called the nominal size of a brick.
Brick size may be slightly different due to shrinkage or distortion due to firing, etc.

An example of a co-ordinating metric commonly used for bricks in the UK is as follows:
* Bricks of dimensions 215 mm × 102.5 mm × 65 mm;
* Mortar beds (horizontal) and perpends (vertical) of a uniform 10 mm.

In this case the co-ordinating metric works because the length of a single brick (215 mm) is equal to the total of the width of a brick (102.5 mm) plus a perpend (10 mm) plus the width of a second brick (102.5 mm).

There are many other brick sizes worldwide, and many of them use this same co-ordinating principle.

==Terminology==

As the most common bricks are rectangular prisms, six surfaces are named as follows:
* Top and bottom surfaces are called &quot;beds&quot;
* Ends or narrow surfaces are called &quot;headers&quot; or &quot;header faces&quot;
* Sides or wider surfaces are called &quot;stretchers&quot; or &quot;stretcher faces&quot;
Mortar placed between bricks is also given separate names with respect to their position. Mortar placed horizontally below or top of a brick is called a &quot;bed&quot;, and mortar placed vertically between bricks is called a &quot;perpend&quot;.

A brick made with just rectilinear dimensions is called a &quot;solid brick&quot;. Bricks might have a depression on both beds or on a single bed. The depression is called a &quot;frog&quot;, and the bricks are known as &quot;frogged bricks&quot;. Frogs can be deep or shallow but should never exceed 20% of the total volume of the brick. Cellular bricks have depressions exceeding 20% of the volume of the brick. Perforated bricks have holes through the brick from bed to bed, cutting it all the way. Most of the building standards and good construction practices recommend the volume of holes should not exceed 20% of the total volume of the brick.

Parts of brickwork include &quot;bricks&quot;, &quot;beds&quot; and &quot;perpends&quot;. The bed is the mortar upon which a brick is laid. A perpend is a vertical joint between any two bricks and is usually—but not always—filled with mortar.

A &quot;face brick&quot; is a higher-quality brick, designed for use in visible external surfaces in face-work, as opposed to a &quot;filler brick&quot; for internal parts of the wall, or where the surface is to be covered with stucco or a similar coating, or where the filler bricks will be concealed by other bricks (in structures more than two bricks thick).

==Orientation==

A brick is given a classification based on how it is laid, and how the exposed face is oriented relative to the face of the finished wall.

; Stretcher or stretching brick: A brick laid flat with its long narrow side exposed.
; Header or heading brick: A brick laid flat with its width exposed.
; Soldier: A brick laid vertically with its long narrow side exposed.
; Sailor: A brick laid vertically with the broad face of the brick exposed.
; Rowlock: A brick laid on the long narrow side with the short end of the brick exposed.
; Shiner or rowlock stretcher: A brick laid on the long narrow side with the broad face of the brick exposed.

==Cut==
The practice of laying uncut full-sized bricks wherever possible gives brickwork its maximum possible strength. In the diagrams below, such uncut full-sized bricks are coloured as follows:
; 

Occasionally though a brick must be cut to fit a given space, or to be the right shape for fulfilling some particular purpose such as generating an offset—called a &quot;lap&quot;—at the beginning of a course. In some cases these special shapes or sizes are manufactured. In the diagrams below, some of the cuts most commonly used for generating a lap are coloured as follows:

; : A brick cut to three-quarters of its length, and laid flat with its long, narrow side exposed.
; : A brick cut to three-quarters of its length, and laid flat with its short side exposed.
; : A brick cut in half across its length, and laid flat.
; : A brick cut in half down its width, and laid with its smallest face exposed and standing vertically. A queen closer is often used for the purpose of creating a lap.

Less frequently used cuts are all coloured as follows:

; : A brick cut to a quarter of its length.
; : A queen closer cut to three-quarters of its length.
; : A brick with one corner cut away, leaving one header face at half its standard width.

==Bonding==
A nearly universal rule in brickwork is that perpends should not be contiguous across courses.

Walls, running linearly and extending upwards, can be of varying depth or thickness. Typically, the bricks are laid also running linearly and extending upwards, forming &quot;wythes&quot; or &quot;leafs&quot;. It is as important as with the perpends to bond these leaves together. Historically, the dominant method for consolidating the leaves together was to lay bricks across them, rather than running linearly.

Brickwork observing either or both of these two conventions is described as being laid in one or another &quot;bond&quot;.

==Thickness (and leaves)==
A leaf is as thick as the width of one brick, but a wall is said to be one brick thick if it as wide as the length of a brick. Accordingly, a single-leaf wall is a half brick thickness; a wall with the simplest possible masonry transverse bond is said to be one brick thick, and so on.

The thickness specified for a wall is determined by such factors as damp proofing considerations, whether or not the wall has a cavity, load-bearing requirements, expense, and the era during which the architect was or is working. Wall thickness specification has varied considerably, and while some non-load-bearing brick walls may be as little as half a brick thick, or even less when shiners are laid stretcher bond in partition walls, other brick walls are much thicker. The Monadnock Building in Chicago, for example, is a very tall masonry building, and has load-bearing brick walls nearly two metres thick at the base. The majority of brick walls are however usually between one and three bricks thick. At these more modest wall thicknesses, distinct patterns have emerged allowing for a structurally sound layout of bricks internal to each particular specified thickness of wall.

===Cavity walls and ties===
The advent during the mid twentieth century of the cavity wall saw the popularisation and development of another method of strengthening brickwork—the wall tie. A cavity wall comprises two totally discrete walls, separated by an air gap, which serves both as barrier to moisture and heat. Typically the main loads taken by the foundations are carried there by the inner leaf, and the major functions of the external leaf are to protect the whole from weather, and to provide a fitting aesthetic finish.

Despite there being no masonry connection between the leaves, their transverse rigidity still needs to be guaranteed. The device used to satisfy this need is the insertion at regular intervals of wall ties into the cavity wall&#x27;s mortar beds.

==Load-bearing bonds==

===Courses of mixed headers and stretchers===
====Flemish bond====
Flemish bond has stretcher between headers, with the headers centred over the stretchers in the courses below.

Where a course begins with a quoin stretcher, the course will ordinarily terminate with a quoin stretcher at the other end. The next course up will begin with a quoin header. For the course&#x27;s second brick, a queen closer is laid, generating the lap of the bond. The third brick along is a stretcher, and is—on account of the lap—centred above the header below. This second course then resumes its paired run of stretcher and header, until the final pair is reached, whereupon a second and final queen closer is inserted as the penultimate brick, mirroring the arrangement at the beginning of the course, and duly closing the bond.

Some examples of Flemish bond incorporate stretchers of one colour and headers of another. This effect is commonly a product of treating the header face of the heading bricks while the bricks are being baked as part of the manufacturing process. Some of the header faces are exposed to wood smoke, generating a grey-blue colour, while other simply vitrified until they reach a deeper blue colour. Some headers have a glazed face, caused by using salt in the firing. Sometimes Staffordshire Blue bricks are used for the heading bricks.

Brickwork that appears as Flemish bond from both the front and the rear is &quot;double Flemish bond&quot;, so called on account of the front and rear duplication of the pattern. If the wall is arranged such that the bricks at the rear do not have this pattern, then the brickwork is said to be &quot;single Flemish bond&quot;.

Flemish bond brickwork with a thickness of one brick is the repeating pattern of a stretcher laid immediately to the rear of the face stretcher, and then next along the course, a header. A lap (correct overlap) is generated by a queen closer on every alternate course:

The colour-coded plans highlight facing bricks in the east–west wall. An elevation for this east–west wall is shown to the right.
A simple way to add some width to the wall would be to add stretching bricks at the rear, making a Single Flemish bond one and a half bricks thick:
Overhead sections of alternate (odd and even) courses of single Flemish bond of one and a half bricks&#x27; thickness

The colour-coded plans highlight facing bricks in the east–west wall. An elevation for this east–west wall is shown to the right.
For a double Flemish bond of one and a half bricks&#x27; thickness, facing bricks and the bricks behind the facing bricks may be laid in groups of four bricks and a half-bat. The half-bat sits at the centre of the group and the four bricks are placed about the half-bat, in a square formation. These groups are laid next to each other for the length of a course, making brickwork one and a half bricks thick.

To preserve the bond, it is necessary to lay a three-quarter bat instead of a header following a quoin stretcher at the corner of the wall. This fact has no bearing on the appearance of the wall; the choice of brick appears to the spectator like any ordinary header:

The colour-coded plans highlight facing bricks in the east–west wall. An elevation for this east–west wall is shown to the right.

For a more substantial wall, a header may be laid directly behind the face header, a further two headers laid at 90° behind the face stretcher, and then finally a stretcher laid to the rear of these two headers. This pattern generates brickwork a full two bricks thick:
Overhead sections of alternate (odd and even) courses of double Flemish bond of two bricks&#x27; thickness

Overhead sections of alternate (odd and even) courses of double Flemish bond of two and a half bricks&#x27; thickness

The colour-coded plans highlight facing bricks in the east–west wall. An elevation for this east–west wall is shown to the right.
For a still more substantial wall, &quot;two&quot; headers may be laid directly behind the face header, a further two &quot;pairs&quot; of headers laid at 90° behind the face stretcher, and then finally a stretcher laid to the rear of these four headers. This pattern generates brickwork a full three bricks thick:
Overhead sections of alternate (odd and even) courses of double Flemish bond of three bricks&#x27; thickness

The colour-coded plans highlight facing bricks in the east–west wall. An elevation for this east–west wall is shown to the right.
====Monk bond====
This bond has stretchers between every header with the headers centred over the perpend between the two stretchers in the course below in the bond&#x27;s most symmetric form.

The great variety of monk bond patterns allow for many possible layouts at the quoins, and many possible arrangements for generating a lap. A quoin brick may be a stretcher, a three-quarter bat, or a header. Queen closers may be used next to the quoins, but the practice is not mandatory.

=====Raking monk bonds=====
Monk bond may however take any of a number of arrangements for course staggering. The disposal of bricks in these often highly irregular raking patterns can be a challenging task for the bricklayer to correctly maintain while constructing a wall whose courses are partially obscured by scaffold, and interrupted by door or window openings, or other bond-disrupting obstacles. If the bricklayer frequently stops to check that bricks are correctly arranged, then masonry in a raking monk bond can be expensive to build.

Occasionally, brickwork in such a raking monk bond may contain minor errors of header and stretcher alignment some of which may have been silently corrected by incorporating a compensating irregularity into the brickwork in a course further up the wall. In spite of these complexities and their associated costs, the bond has proven a common choice for constructing brickwork in the north of Europe.

Raking courses in monk bond may—for instance—be staggered in such a way as to generate the appearance of diagonal lines of stretchers. One method of achieving this effect relies on the use of a repeating sequence of courses with back-and-forth header staggering. In this grouping, a header appears at a given point in the group&#x27;s first course. In the next course up, a header is offset one and a half stretcher lengths to the left of the header in the course below, and then in the third course, a header is offset one stretcher length to the right of the header in the middle course. This accented swing of headers, one and a half to the left, and one to the right, generates the appearance of lines of stretchers running from the upper left hand side of the wall down to the lower right. Such an example of a raking monk bond layout is shown in the New Malden Library, Kingston upon Thames, Greater London.

Elsewhere, raking courses in monk bond may be staggered in such a way as to generate a subtle appearance of indented pyramid-like diagonals. Such an arrangement appears in the picture here from the building in Solna, Sweden.

Many other particular adjustments of course alignment exist in monk bond, generating a variety of visual effects which differ in detail, but often having the effect of directing a viewing eye diagonally down the wall.

====Sussex bond====
This bond has stretchers between every header, with the headers centred above the midpoint of three stretchers in the course below.

The bond&#x27;s horizontally extended proportion suits long stretches of masonry such as garden walls or the run of brickwork over a ribbon window; conversely, the bond is less suitable for a surface occupied by many features, such as a Georgian façade. The relatively infrequent use of headers serves to make Sussex bond one of the less expensive bonds in which to build a wall, as it allows for the bricklayer to proceed rapidly with run after run of three stretchers at a time.

===One stretching course per heading course===
One of the two kinds of course in this family of bonds is called a &quot;stretching course&quot;, and this typically comprises nothing but stretchers at the face from quoin to quoin. The other kind of course is the &quot;heading course&quot;, and this usually consists of headers, with two queen closers—one by the quoin header at either end—to generate the bond.

====English bond====
This bond has alternating stretching and heading courses, with the headers centred over the midpoint of the stretchers, and perpends in each alternate course aligned. Queen closers appear as the second brick, and the penultimate brick in heading courses. A muted colour scheme for occasional headers is sometimes used in English bond to lend a subtle texture to the brickwork. Examples of such schemes include blue-grey headers among otherwise red bricks—seen in the south of England—and light brown headers in a dark brown wall, more often found in parts of the north of England.

====English cross bond====

This bond also has alternating stretching and heading courses. However, whilst the heading courses are identical with those found in the standard English bond, the stretching courses alternate between a course composed entirely of stretchers, and a course composed of stretchers half off-set relative to the stretchers two courses above or below, by reason of a header placed just before the quoins at either end. The bond is widely found in Northern France, Belgium and the Netherlands.

Large areas of English cross bond can appear to have a twill like characteristic, an effect caused by the unbroken series of perpends moving diagonally down the bond.

====Dutch bond====
This bond is exactly like English cross bond except in the generating of the lap at the quoins. In Dutch bond, all quoins are three-quarter bats—placed in alternately stretching and heading orientation with successive courses—and no use whatever is made of queen closers. To the Dutch this is simply a variant of what they call a cross bond.
===Two or more stretching course per heading course===
====English garden wall bond====
This bond has three courses of stretchers between every course of headers.

For the standard English garden wall bond, headers are used as quoins for the middle stretching course in order to generate the lap, with queen closers as the penultimate brick at either end of the heading courses. A more complex set of quoins and queen closers is necessary to achieve the lap for a raking English garden wall bond.

The heading course in English garden wall bond sometimes features bricks of a different colour to its surrounding stretchers. In English chalk districts, flint is substituted for the stretchers, and the headers constitute a lacing course.

====Scottish bond====
This bond has five courses of stretchers between every course of headers.

The lap is generated by the use of headers as quoins for the even-numbered stretching courses, counting up from the previous heading course, with queen closers as the penultimate brick at either end of the heading courses.

====American, or common bond====
This bond may have between three and nine courses of stretchers between each course of headers. Six is the most common number of courses of stretchers.

Headers are used as quoins for the even-numbered stretching courses, counting up from the previous heading course, in order to achieve the necessary off-set in a standard American bond, with queen closers as the penultimate brick at either end of the heading courses.

The brick Clarke-Palmore House in Henrico County, Virginia, has a lower level built in 1819 described as being American bond of three to five stretching courses between each heading course, and an upper level built in 1855 with American bond of six to seven stretching courses between each heading course.

===Only stretching or heading courses===
====Header bond====
All bricks in this bond are headers, but for the lap-generating quoin three-quarter bat which offsets each successive courses by half a header.

Header bond is often used on curving walls with a small radius of curvature. In Lewes, Sussex, England UK many small buildings are constructed in this bond, using blue coloured bricks and vitrified surfaces.

====Stretcher, or running bond====
All bricks in this bond are stretchers, with the bricks in each successive course staggered by half a stretcher. Headers are used as quoins on alternating stretching courses in order to achieve the necessary off-set.

It is the simplest repeating pattern, and will create a wall one header thick.

====Raking stretcher bond====
Also consists entirely of courses of stretchers, but with the bricks in each successive course staggered in some pattern other than that of standard stretcher bond.

===One or more stretching courses per alternating course===

====Flemish stretcher bond====
Flemish stretcher bond separates courses of alternately laid stretchers and headers, with a number of courses of stretchers alone. Brickwork in this bond may have between one and four courses of stretchers to one course after the Flemish manner. The courses of stretchers are often but not always staggered in a raking pattern.

===Courses of mixed rowlocks and shiners===
====Rat-trap bond====
Rat-trap bond (also Chinese bond) substantially observes the same pattern as Flemish bond, but consists of rowlocks and shiners instead of headers and stretchers. This gives a wall with an internal cavity bridged by the rowlocks, hence the reference to rat-traps.

===One shiner course per heading course===

====Dearne&#x27;s bond====
Dearne&#x27;s bond substantially observes the same pattern as English bond, but uses shiners in place of stretchers.
==Non-load-bearing bonds==
===Courses of mixed shiners and sailors===
====Single basket weave bond====

A row of single basket weave bond comprises pairs of sailors laid side-by-side, capped with a shiner, alternating with pairs of sailors laid side-by-side sat atop a shiner. Subsequent rows are identical and aligned with those above.

====Double basket weave bond====
A row of double basket weave bond comprises pairs of shiners laid atop one another, alternating with pairs of sailors laid side by side. The following row is off-set so the pair of shiners sits below the pair of sailors in the row above. This results in bricks arranged in pairs in a square grid so that the join between each pair is perpendicular to the join of the four pairs around it.

====Herringbone bond====

The herringbone pattern (opus spicatum) made by placing soldiers next to stretchers or vice versa (i.e. headers perpendicular) making &#x27;L&#x27; shapes, nesting each L in the same order of laying. Thin bricks are more common. The pattern is usually rotated by 45° to create a completely vertical (plumb) succession of &#x27;V&#x27; shapes. It follows either the left or right brick forms the tip of the v in any wall. Herringbone is sometimes used as infill in timber-framed buildings.

===Brickwork built around square fractional-sized bricks===
====Pinwheel bond====
Pinwheel bond is made of four bricks surrounding a square half-brick, repeated in a square grid.

====Della Robbia bond====
A pattern made of four bricks surrounding a square brick, one-quarter the size of a half-brick. It is designed to resemble woven cloth. Another, similar pattern is called the interlacing bond.

==Diapering==

Brickwork formed into a diamond pattern is called diapering.
===Flemish diagonal bond===
Flemish diagonal bond comprises a complex pattern of stretcher courses alternating with courses of one or two stretchers between headers, at various offsets, such that over ten courses, a diamond-shaped pattern appears.

==Damp-proof courses==

Moisture may ascend into a building from the foundation of a wall or gain ingress into a building from a wet patch of ground, where it meets a solid wall. The manifest result of this process is called damp. One of many methods of resisting such ingresses of water is to construct the wall with several low courses of dense engineering bricks such as Staffordshire blue bricks. This method of damp proofing appears as a distinctive navy blue band running around the circumference of a building. It is only partially effective, as in spite of the lower courses of brick being more moisture resistant the mortar bedding and perpends joining the bricks remain permeable.

<text>Barbara Feldon (born Barbara Anne Hall; March 12, 1933) is an American actress primarily known for her roles on television. Her most prominent role was that of Agent 99 in the 1965–1970 sitcom &quot;Get Smart&quot;.

==Early life==
Feldon was born Barbara Anne Hall in Butler, Pennsylvania, part of the Pittsburgh metropolitan area. Feldon and her older sister Patricia were the daughters of Raymond D. and Julia Stewart Hall. She graduated from Bethel Park High School and trained at Pittsburgh Playhouse. In 1955, she graduated from Carnegie Institute of Technology with a Bachelor of Arts in drama. She was initiated into the Delta Xi chapter of Kappa Kappa Gamma. In 1957, she won the grand prize on &quot;The $64,000 Question&quot; in the category of William Shakespeare.

==Career==
Feldon studied acting at HB Studio. Following working as a model, Feldon&#x27;s break came in the form of a popular and much-parodied television commercial for &quot;Top Brass,&quot; a hair pomade for men by Revlon. Lounging languidly on an animal-print rug, she purred at the camera, addressing the male viewers who use it as &quot;tigers.&quot;

This led to small roles in television series. In the 1960s, she made appearances on &quot;Twelve O&#x27;Clock High&quot; (season one episode &quot;End of the Line&quot;), &quot;Flipper&quot; (season one two-parter episode &quot;The Lady and the Dolphin&quot;) and &quot;The Man from U.N.C.L.E.&quot; (in &quot;The Never-Never Affair&quot;, which aired spring 1965). In 1964, she appeared with Simon Oakland in the episode &quot;Try to Find a Spy&quot; of CBS&#x27;s short-lived drama &quot;Mr. Broadway.&quot;

One substantial guest-starring role was opposite George C. Scott in the television drama &quot;East Side/West Side&quot; (season one). It was produced by Talent Associates which was also developing a TV comedy called &quot;Get Smart&quot; with two prominent writers, Mel Brooks and Buck Henry.

Feldon was cast in this new show as &quot;Agent 99&quot;. She starred opposite comedian Don Adams, who portrayed Maxwell Smart, &quot;Secret Agent 86&quot;. She played the role for the duration of the show&#x27;s production from 1965 until 1970 and was nominated for an Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series in 1968 and 1969.

The character was unusual for the era, showing a capable woman succeeding in a stressful career. Feldon noted, &quot;A lot of women said 99 was a role model for them because she was smart and always got the right answer.&quot; Feldon almost lost her role as 99 because the sponsor of &quot;Get Smart&quot; was a deodorant soap, and she had done a deodorant commercial for Revlon. Feldon was also noticeably taller than Adams, her male co-star, another rarity for the time.

Feldon made guest appearances five times on &quot;The Dean Martin Show&quot; from 1968 to 1972, singing and dancing and performing in comedy skits. She also appeared on &quot;Rowan &amp; Martin&#x27;s Laugh-In.&quot; After her starring TV role, she guest-starred in several 1970s television series, including &quot;The Carol Burnett Show&quot; (season 3, episode 17 (1970)), &quot;Thriller&quot; (season 1, episode 1 (1973)), &quot;The Name of the Game&quot;, &quot;McMillan &amp; Wife&quot; and Lorne Greene&#x27;s &quot;Griff&quot;.

Her TV movies include &quot;Getting Away from It All&quot; (1972) with Larry Hagman, &quot;Let&#x27;s Switch!&quot; (1975) with Barbara Eden, and the cult-classic thriller &quot;A Vacation in Hell&quot; (1979) with Maureen McCormick and Priscilla Barnes. She voiced the character Patti Bear in the 1973 animated television special &quot;The Bear Who Slept Through Christmas&quot;.

Feldon&#x27;s feature films included &quot;Fitzwilly&quot; (1967), &quot;Smile&quot; (1975), and &quot;No Deposit, No Return&quot; (1976). Her last film to date is 2006&#x27;s &quot;Last Request&quot;, a comedy with T. R. Knight, Danny Aiello, and Joe Piscopo.

In 1978 she was Bob Eubanks&#x27;s first co-host of the annual January 1 Tournament of Roses Parade in Pasadena. In 1982, Feldon appeared at Denver&#x27;s Elitch Theatre in &quot;What I Did Last Summer&quot;.

Feldon reprised her role as &quot;Agent 99&quot; in the made-for-television film &quot;Get Smart, Again!&quot; (1989) and in a short-lived revival of &quot;Get Smart&quot; in 1995. She wrote and provided audio commentaries and introductions for the DVD release of the original &quot;Get Smart&quot; series in 2006, but did not take part in the 2008 film adaptation that starred Steve Carell as Maxwell Smart. Feldon guest-starred as a former TV spy star on a 1993 season one episode of &quot;Mad About You&quot; as Diane &quot;Spy Girl&quot; Caldwell.

She played Lauren Hudson, Sam Malone&#x27;s annual Valentine&#x27;s Day love interest, in the 1991 &quot;Cheers&quot; episode &quot;Sam Time Next Year&quot;.

Feldon&#x27;s distinctive voice has been heard in numerous TV and radio commercials and film and TV documentaries. She has occasionally acted in off-Broadway plays but said she is &quot;no longer interested in performing&quot;. 

Feldon is an accomplished writer and is still actively writing. In 2015, she had two editorial pieces featured in &quot;Metropolitan Magazine&quot;. She wrote a book, &quot;Living Alone and Loving It,&quot; in 2003.

==Personal life==
&quot;Feldon&quot; has been the actress&#x27;s last name since she married Lucien Verdoux-Feldon in 1958. They divorced in 1967 due to Lucien&#x27;s growing drug addiction. In 1968, while living in Los Angeles, she began a 12-year relationship with &quot;Get Smart&quot; producer Burt Nodella. Upon ending her relationship, she moved back to New York City, and was still living there as of 2024.

<text>The Australian National Kennel Council, currently known as Dogs Australia, is the coordinating kennel club and main canine association of Australia. It is a member of the Fédération Cynologique Internationale.

==Role==
The Australian National Kennel Council is the peak body for Australia&#x27;s state-based kennel clubs, which are:
* Australian Capital Territory Canine Association Inc (Dogs ACT)
* Canine Association of Western Australia Inc (Dogs West)
* Canine Control Council (Queensland) (Dogs Qld)
* North Australian Canine Association Inc (Dogs NT)
* Royal New South Wales Canine Council Ltd (Dogs NSW)
* South Australia Canine Association Inc (Dogs SA)
* Tasmanian Canine Association Inc (Dogs Tas)
* Victorian Canine Association Inc (Dogs Vic)

It maintains stud books for recognised dog breeds, and provides governance for dog shows, dog trials and canine events. It is a member of the Fédération Cynologique Internationale, and the international representative of the kennel clubs of Australia.

==History==
The first meeting to consider forming the Australian National Kennel Council occurred in April 1949 during that year&#x27;s Sydney Royal Easter Show. It was not until April 1958 that a constitution was drafted and presented at the Royal Easter Show, with it being approved and the council forming in September that year at the Royal Melbourne Show.

<doc id="366288" wikidata="Q2499714" url="?curid=366288" title="Upper Clyde Shipbuilders">
<text>Upper Clyde Shipbuilders (UCS) was a Scottish shipbuilding consortium, created in 1968 as a result of the amalgamation of five major shipbuilders of the River Clyde. It entered liquidation, with much controversy, in 1971. That led to a &quot;work-in&quot; campaign at the company&#x27;s shipyards, involving shop stewards Jimmy Airlie and Jimmy Reid, among others.

==Formation==
The Company was formed in February 1968 from the amalgamation of five Upper Clyde Shipbuilding firms: Fairfield in Govan (Govan Division), Alexander Stephen and Sons in Linthouse (Linthouse Division), Charles Connell and Company in Scotstoun (Scotstoun Division) and John Brown and Company at Clydebank (Clydebank Division), as well as an associate subsidiary, Yarrow Shipbuilders Ltd, in which UCS held a controlling stake of 51%.

The consolidation was a result of the &quot;Geddes Report&quot;, published in 1966, and the subsequent Shipbuilding Industry Act 1967 (sponsored by the Minister of Technology, then Anthony Wedgwood Benn) which recommended rationalisation and horizontal integration of shipbuilding in the United Kingdom into large regional groups, aided with grants from the state Shipbuilding Industry Board, in order to achieve economies of scale and better compete in the market for increasingly large merchant vessels like VLCCs. The creation of these groupings included Scott Lithgow on the Lower Clyde, Swan Hunter on Tyneside and Robb Caledon on the east coast of Scotland. The government had a 48.4% minority holding in the consortium and provided a £5.5m interest-free government loan over the first three years. UCS had a combined order book at the time worth £87m.

==Collapse of UCS==
In June 1971, the loss-making Upper Clyde Shipbuilders went into receivership (only one yard of the five, Yarrow Shipbuilders Ltd, remained profitable but had left the joint venture in April 1970). In February 1971, in the wake of the emergency nationalisation of Rolls-Royce Limited, the then Conservative government under Edward Heath and the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry, John Davies, announced a policy that refused further state-support for &quot;lame duck&quot; industries, which led to a crisis of confidence amongst UCS creditors and resulted in severe cash flow problems for the company. After the government refused UCS a £6m working capital loan as a lender of last resort, the company was forced to enter liquidation although the yards had a full order book and a forecasted profit in 1972.

==Work-in==
After the company&#x27;s collapse, rather than striking, unions representing the shipyard&#x27;s workers decided to conduct a &quot;work-in&quot; to complete orders already in place. The work-in was led by a group of young shop stewards, including Jimmy Reid, Jimmy Airlie, Sammy Barr and Sammy Gilmore. Reid wanted to ensure the workers projected the best image of the yard workers he possibly could, and he insisted on tight discipline. He addressed the workers at the yards, where he instructed them that there should be &quot;no hooliganism, no vandalism and no bevvying [drinking]&quot;.

===Work-in support===
The shipbuilders&#x27; tactics worked, and public sympathy in the Glasgow area and beyond was on the side of the workers who took part. That was backed up with demonstrations in Glasgow, one of which was attended by around 80,000 marchers. At one demonstration, on Glasgow Green, Tony Benn addressed those in attendance, and Matt McGinn and Billy Connolly (both former shipyard workers) offered entertainment to the gathered crowd. The campaign was also well-backed financially, and at one meeting for the campaign, Jimmy Reid was able to announce that the campaign had received a £5,000 contribution from John Lennon, to which an attendee replied &quot;but Lenin&#x27;s deid!&quot; (dead).

===Analysis of the work-in===
The Thatcher Conservative government would be more far-reaching in its attempts to remove state involvement in industrial affairs.

==Restructuring and aftermath==
In February 1972, the Conservative government relented to the demands of the workers and restructured the yards around two new companies: Govan Shipbuilders was established (formerly Fairfields), along with its subsidiary Scotstoun Marine Ltd (formerly Connells). Yarrow Shipbuilders had already withdrawn from UCS in April 1970 and regained its status as an independent company (until 1977, when it was nationalised as part of British Shipbuilders, along with Govan Shipbuilders). A fourth yard, at Clydebank (formerly John Brown), was sold to Marathon Oil as an oil-rig fabrication yard; which eventually closed in 2001.

In 1999, two major shipyards on the Upper Clyde (the former Yarrow and Fairfields yards) were acquired by the defence contractor BAE Systems and became part of BAE Systems Surface Ships.

<text>Cache Creek is a historic transportation junction and incorporated village northeast of Vancouver in British Columbia, Canada. It is on the Trans-Canada Highway in the province of British Columbia at a junction with Highway 97. The same intersection and the town that grew around it was at the point on the Cariboo Wagon Road where a branch road, and previously only a trail, led east to Savona&#x27;s Ferry on Kamloops Lake. This community is also the point at which a small stream, once known as Riviere de la Cache, joins the Bonaparte River.

The name is derived, apparently, from a &quot;cache&quot; or buried and hidden supply and trade goods depot used by the fur traders of either the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company or its rival the North West Company. Although it was first incorporated as a Local District municipality with the name Cache Creek in 1959, the name has been associated with this community since long before incorporation. The Cache Creek post office was established in 1868.

Although still very active with traffic, Cache Creek was extremely busy for a few decades before the Trans-Canada Highway was superseded by the newer and shorter Coquihalla Highway, which bypasses the Fraser and Thompson Canyons between Hope and Kamloops via Merritt, about southeast.

The nearby fossil locality, the McAbee fossil beds, is noted for the wide diversity of Eocene plants and animals preserved in the shale, including the extinct plants &quot;Dillhoffia&quot; and &quot;Trochodendron drachukii&quot;. The town lends its name to significant geological features, dating back to the Carboniferous, whose rocks are exposed in the area, Cache Creek terrane and Cache Creek Ocean.

The village of Cache Creek is also served by a community television station (run by the Ash-Creek Television Society), CH4472 in the neighbouring town of Ashcroft on VHF channel 4 (with an effective radiated power of 74 watts at above ground level), with a repeater (CH4473 on VHF 8, with an effective radiated power of 49 watts at ) in Cache Creek, British Columbia. The town is also served by CFMA-FM 105.9, a community radio station run by the Ash-Creek Television Society.

== Demographics ==
In the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, Cache Creek had a population of 969 living in 471 of its 522 total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of 963. With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.

<doc id="366294" wikidata="Q828329" url="?curid=366294" title="Tepui">
<text>A tepui , or tepuy (), is a table-top mountain or mesa found in South America, especially in Venezuela and western Guyana. The word tepui means &quot;house of the gods&quot; in the native tongue of the Pemon, the indigenous people who inhabit the Gran Sabana.

Tepuis tend to be found as isolated entities rather than in connected ranges, which makes them the host of a unique array of endemic plant and animal species. Notable tepuis include Auyantepui, Autana, Neblina, and Mount Roraima. They are typically composed of sheer blocks of Precambrian quartz arenite sandstone that rise abruptly from the jungle. Auyantepui is the source of Angel Falls, the world&#x27;s tallest waterfall.

== Morphology ==


These table-top mountains are the remains of a large sandstone plateau that once covered the granite basement complex between the north border of the Amazon Basin and the Orinoco, between the Atlantic coast and the Rio Negro. This area is part of the remnants of the supercontinent Gondwana. Throughout the course of the history of Earth, the plateau began to erode and fragment about 300 million years ago, and about 70 million years ago the tepuis were formed from the remaining monadnocks.

There are 115 such mesas in the Gran Sabana in the south-east of Venezuela on the border with Guyana and Brazil, where the highest concentration of tepuis is found. The precipitous mountains tower over the surrounding area by up to .

Tepuis range in elevation from . The total surface area of all 115 tepuis is approximately .
Because of their great age, some tepuis exhibit surface features and caves typical of karst topography, formed in more water-soluble rocks such as limestone. Caves here include the Abismo Guy Collet, the deepest quartzite cave in the world. Some of the mesas are pocked with giant sinkholes up to in diameter and with sheer walls up to deep. These sinkholes are formed when the roofs of tunnels carved by underground rivers collapse.

== Flora and fauna ==

The plateaus of the tepuis are completely isolated from the ground forest, making them ecological islands. The altitude causes them to have a different climate from the ground forest. The top presents cool temperatures with frequent rainfall, while the bases of the mountains have a tropical, warm and humid climate. The isolation has led to the presence of endemic flora and fauna through evolution over millennia of a different world of animals and plants, cut off from the rest of the world by the imposing rock walls. Some tepui sinkholes contain species that have evolved in these &quot;islands within islands&quot; that are unique to that sinkhole. 

The tepuis are often referred to as the Galápagos Islands of the mainland, having a large number of unique plants and animals not found anywhere else in the world. The floors of the mesas are poor in nutrients, which has led to a rich variety of carnivorous plants, such as &quot;Drosera&quot; and most species of &quot;Heliamphora&quot;, as well as a wide variety of orchids and bromeliads. The weathered, craggy nature of the rocky ground means no layers of humus are formed.

It has been hypothesized that endemics on tepuis represent relict fauna and flora that underwent vicariant speciation when the plateau became fragmented over geological time. However, recent studies suggest that tepuis are not as isolated as originally believed. For example, an endemic group of treefrogs, &quot;Tepuihyla&quot;, have diverged after the tepuis were formed; that is, speciation followed colonization from the lowlands.

The tepuis, also known as &#x27;islands above the rainforest&#x27;, are a challenge for researchers, as they are home to a high number of new species that have yet to be described. A few of these mountains are cloaked by thick clouds for nearly the entire year. Their surfaces could previously only be photographed by helicopter radar equipment.

Many tepuis are in the Canaima National Park in Venezuela, which has been classified as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO.

== Selected tepuis ==

A few of the most notable of the 60 tepuis:

* Auyantepui is the largest of the tepuis with a surface area of . Angel Falls, the highest waterfall in the world, drops from a cleft in the summit.
* Mount Roraima, also known as Roraima Tepui. A report by the noted South American researcher Robert Schomburgk inspired the Scottish author Arthur Conan Doyle to write his novel &quot;The Lost World&quot; about the discovery of a living prehistoric world full of dinosaurs and other primordial creatures. The borders of Venezuela, Brazil, and Guyana meet on the top.
* Matawi Tepui, also known as Kukenán, because it is the source of the Kukenán River, is considered the &quot;place of the dead&quot; by the local Pemon Peoples. Located next to Mount Roraima in Venezuela.
* Autana Tepui stands above the forest floor. A unique cave runs from one side of the mountain to the other.
* Sarisariñama Tepui, famous for its almost perfectly circular sinkholes that go straight down from the mountain top – the largest such sinkhole is in diameter and depth (purportedly created by groundwater erosion). They harbour an ecosystem composed of unique plant and animal species at the bottom.
* Ilú-Tramen Massif is the most northerly mountain in the chain that stretches along the Venezuelan-Guyana border from Roraima in the south.

== Popular culture ==
The hypothesis that endemic fauna and flora of tepuis represent remnants of ancient species was an inspiration to Arthur Conan Doyle&#x27;s novel &quot;The Lost World&quot; (1912), which was set on a tepui.

In the 1990 film &quot;Arachnophobia&quot;, a new species of spider with a highly potent, deadly venom that lives in social colonies and is the implied apex predator of its environment is discovered in a sinkhole enclosed by a tepui in the Venezuelan rainforest, also alluding to the unique ecological conditions of tepuis.

Much of the story of 2009 Pixar–Disney film &quot;Up&quot; takes place among the tepuis. The film also includes depictions of the numerous rock formations and an Angel Falls-like waterfall called &quot;Paradise Falls&quot;.

Steve Backshall was part of the first expedition to successfully climb Mount Upuigma. The expedition was part of the program &quot;Lost Land of the Jaguar&quot; on BBC One in 2008. On the summit they discovered an endemic species of frog and mouse, and also footprints of an unidentified mammal.

In the novel &quot;The 6th Extinction&quot; (2014) by James Rollins, a tepui in the north of Brazil was featured as a secret lair for the villain Dr. Cutter Elwes.

The sinkholes Sima Martel and Sima Humboldt located on Sarisariñama, were mentioned in the viral marketing for the film &quot;Godzilla (2014 film)&quot;. Entering the name of either sinkhole into the marketing website would produce the readout &quot;twin signatures detected&quot;. Due to the sinkholes being discovered in 1961, the readout is assumed to be a joke referring to &quot;Mothra (1961 film)&quot;.

<text>Tunisair () is the national airline of Tunisia. Formed in 1948, it operates scheduled international services to four continents. Its main base is Tunis–Carthage International Airport. The airline&#x27;s head office is in Tunis, near Tunis Airport.

== History ==
The carrier was formed by the government of Tunisia as &quot;Société Tunisienne de l&#x27;Air&quot; in late 1948. The initial investment was FRF 60 million, with shareholding split between the government (35%), Air France (35%) and another interests (30%). Air France transferred some of its DC-3s and routes (which included Tunis–Bone–Algiers, Tunis–Ajaccio–Nice, Tunis–Bastia–Nice, Tunis–Rome and a cargo flight between Tunis and Marseilles) to the new airline for it to start operations; these commenced on 1 April 1949. The first managing director of the company was Rene Lefevre.

The route network was expanded along the coast during the early 1950s. In 1951, Casablanca, Ghudamis and Tripoli were incorporated as destinations. In that year, a Tunis–Tripoli–Sabhah service was launched; it was routed via Sfax and Djerba in . The Ghudamis route was terminated in 1952, and the Casablanca run was taken over by Air France the same year. In 1953, the service to Marseilles was extended to Paris. In 1954, a Douglas DC-4 was leased from Air France and used on the route to Paris. At March 1955, the fleet comprised three Douglas DC-3s, one Douglas DC-4 and a SNCASE Languedoc. During 1955, the carrier transported 92,344 passengers. At year end, the number of employees was 140. The airline had a revenue of £620,000 for 1955, and costs totalled to £550,000. In 1957 the Tunisian government became the largest shareholder (51%) and the stake held by Air France was reduced to 15%.

The carrier took delivery of its first jet-powered aircraft, a Sud Caravelle III, on 31 August 1961. A new service to Frankfurt was inaugurated in October but it was terminated in March the following year due to poor economical performance. A second Caravelle was ordered in 1963 and entered service in March 1964. In cooperation with Lufthansa, flights to Frankfurt were restarted in April 1966 using Caravelle equipment. The Nord 262 was first put into service in 1969. The introduction of this aircraft into the fleet along with the airline already having two Caravelles in operation allowed the carrier to phase out a DC-3 and two DC-4s.

The number of employees had grown to 888 by March 1970. At this time, they had four Caravelles, two Cessna 402s, a DC-3 and a Nord 262, which were used on domestic services and international routes to Algeria, Belgium, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Italy, Libya, Morocco and Switzerland. Tunis Air took delivery of its first Boeing aircraft, a Boeing 727-200, on 12 March 1972; it was put on service on the Tunis–Paris run. On 1 April 1972, a Boeing 707 that was leased from Sabena inaugurated the Tunis–London link. The same day, new services to Luxembourg and Jeddah were launched. Late in the year, a second Boeing 727s was ordered for delivery in July 1973. In 1973, a third Boeing 727 was ordered for handover in that year. A fourth and fifth 727 were ordered in 1974 and 1975. The gradual incorporation of the Boeing 727s permitted Tunisair to replace the Caravelles and to retire the remaining DC-3s.

For the first time in its history, in 1995 the carrier started trading its shares at the Tunis stock exchange when 20% of the stake was floated. Ahmed Smaoui took over as president and director general of the company in March 1997. In January 1999, Abdelmalek Larif became the new president. Also in 1999, flights to Amman and Beirut were launched. By April 2000 the airline had employees. At this time the fleet comprised one Airbus A300B4-200, two Airbus A319-100s, ten Airbus A320-200s, four Boeing 727-200 Advanced, three Boeing 737-200 Advanced, four Boeing 737-500s and three Boeing 737-600s that served the following destinations: Abu Dhabi, Algiers, Amman, Amsterdam, Athens, Barcelona, Beirut, Berlin, Bilbao, Bordeaux, Bratislava, Brussels, Budapest, Cairo, Casablanca, Copenhagen, Dakar, Damascus, Djerba, Düsseldorf, Frankfurt, Gafsa, Geneva, Graz, Hamburg, Istanbul, Jeddah, Lille, Linz, Lisbon, London, Luxembourg, Lyon, Madrid, Malta, Marseille, Milan, Monastir, Munich, Nice, Nouakchott, Palermo, Paris, Prague, Rome, Salzburg, Sfax, Stockholm, Strasbourg, Tabarka, Toulouse, Tozeur, Tunis, Vienna, Warsaw and Zürich.

In 2007, Nabil Chettaoui was appointed as chief executive officer (CEO). In June 2011, Hamadi Thamri replaced Chettaoui as president and CEO of the company. In July the same year, Moscow was first served by the carrier with flights to Domodedovo Airport. The airline&#x27;s first transatlantic service, Tunis–Montreal, was launched in July 2016.

== Corporate affairs ==

=== Ownership and management ===
, Tunisair is owned 64,86% by the Tunisian state, 9.56% by three state-owned national funds (CNSS, CNRPS, CNAM) , and 5,58% by Air France. The remaining 20% of the stake is floated under the ticker TAIR. The position of CEO was replaced by a head of general management, and a chairman of the board of directors. Montassar Bnouni and Habib Mekki were appointed respectively. Habib Mekki also holds the position of Secretary General of the Ministry of Transport

=== Business trends ===
Annual reports for Tunisair do not appear to be regularly published; figures can also appear to be inconsistent in industry and press reports. Figures for the Airline (as opposed to the Group) seem to be as shown below (as at year ending 31 December):

=== Head office ===
Tunisair&#x27;s head office is located on Route X near Tunis–Carthage International Airport in Tunis.

== Destinations ==
Tunisair flies to destinations across Africa, Asia, Europe and North America. Its main base is Tunis–Carthage International Airport.

As of November 2023, the airline serves 24 countries on 68 routes.

== Fleet ==

=== Current fleet ===
The Tunisair fleet consists of the following aircraft, :

=== Historical fleet ===
* Airbus A300-600
* Boeing 737-500
* Boeing 747

=== Recent developments ===
Tunisair became the first Airbus A319 customer in both the Arab World and Africa when it ordered three aircraft in October 1997, along with four Airbus A320s. Another order followed the same year when the carrier acquired four Boeing 737-600s that were initially slated for delivery starting in May 1999. The airline took options on three more aircraft but the specific variants were not informed at that time. The aircraft included in both orders were aimed at replacing the ageing Boeing 727s and 737s in the airline fleet. The company took delivery of its first A319 in August 1998. Tunisair subsequently added three more Boeing 737-600s, taking delivery of the seventh one in April 2001.

Two second-hand General Electric CF6-powered Airbus A300-600R were purchased in 2000; A third aircraft of the type joined the fleet in 2001. An extended range A319 was ordered in 2006. In July 2008, Tunisair ordered three Airbus A350 XWBs, along with three Airbus A330-200s and ten Airbus A320s. The order was partially amended in mid-2013, when the airline cancelled the order for the A350. The airline took delivery of its first Airbus A330-200 in June 2015. The Airbus order was amended again in 2016, removing an A330 and four A320s and including four Airbus A320neos.

== Incidents and accidents ==
Tunisair has never experienced a fatal accident since its founding in 1948, but has experienced three hull losses:

* On 12 January 1979, a Boeing 727 was hijacked and diverted to Libya after the hijackers demanded the release of Tunisian trade unionist Habib Achour. In Tripoli, the hijackers surrendered. There were no fatalities.
* On 11 February 1992, a Boeing 727 rolled out of its hangar at Tunis–Carthage International Airport during an engine test due to technicians forgetting to set the aircraft&#x27;s brakes. The aircraft was damaged beyond repair.
* On 6 February 2013, an Airbus A320 operating as Flight 712 excursed from the runway while landing at Tunis–Carthage International Airport. All 83 people on board survived, but the aircraft was declared a hull loss.

<text>Auyán-tepui (), also spelled Ayan, is a tepui in Bolívar state, Venezuela. It is the most visited and one of the largest (but not the highest) tepuis in the Guiana Highlands, with a summit area of and an estimated slope area of . 

The unevenly heart-shaped summit plateau of Auyán-tepui is heavily inclined, rising from around in the northwest to a maximum of in the southeast. It is incised from the north by a vast valley, the Cañón del Diablo (Devil&#x27;s Canyon), formed by the Churún River. The larger western portion of the plateau is partially forested, whereas the eastern part comprises mostly bare rock with only patchy vegetation cover. The mountain hosts a number of extensive cave systems.

Auyán-tepui gives its name to the Auyán Massif, which also includes the tiny peaks of Cerro El Sol and Cerro La Luna to the north and the satellite mountain of Uaipán-tepui to the south. The massif has a total summit area of roughly and an estimated slope area of . It is situated entirely within the bounds of Canaima National Park. Auyán-tepui means &quot;Devil&#x27;s House&quot; in the local Pemón language.

Angel Falls, the tallest waterfall in the world, drops from a cleft near the summit. The falls are high, with an uninterrupted descent of — a drop nineteen times higher than that of Niagara Falls.

Auyán-tepui achieved international fame in 1933 when Angel Falls was accidentally discovered by Jimmie Angel, a bush pilot searching for gold ore. Attempting to land on the heart-shaped mesa in 1937, Angel crashed his small Flamingo plane on top of Auyán-tepui and was forced to hike down the gradually sloping backside, a trip that took him and his crew 11 days to complete; he was immortalised when the waterfall was named after him.

Around 25 species of amphibians and reptiles are known from the summit plateau of Auyán-tepui, as well as numerous birds. Like many tepuis, the mountain hosts a rich assemblage of flora.

<text>Landshut is a &quot;Landkreis&quot; (district) in Bavaria, Germany. It is bounded by (from the north and clockwise) the districts of Kelheim, Straubing-Bogen, Dingolfing-Landau, Rottal-Inn, Mühldorf, Erding and Freising. The city of Landshut is enclosed by, but does not belong to the district. It is nonetheless its administrative seat.

==History==
The city of Landshut was founded in 1204 by the ruling Wittelsbach family of Bavaria. Since then the region has always been a part of Bavaria.
Heinrich Himmler attended Landshut Grammar School, He would go on to become Reichsführer-SS of the Schutzstaffel in Nazi Germany and one of the organizers of the Holocaust.
The present district was established in 1972 by merging the former districts of Landshut, Rottenburg and Vilsbiburg and adding some municipalities of surrounding districts.

==Geography==
The district comprises plain countryside on both banks of the Isar river.

==Economy==
Many residents work at the Dingolfing BMW (formerly Glas) car plant which expanded massively during the 1970s. Others commute daily to Munich, which is about 46 miles (74 km) to the southwest.

The first research nuclear power plant at Niederaichbach was torn down and returned to greenfield status in 1995. Two other nuclear reactors, known as Isar I and Isar II, in the Essenbach district remain operational: nuclear power generation remains a significant local employer.

==Coat of arms==
The coat of arms displays:
* the blue and white checked pattern of Bavaria
* the arms of the county of Preysing, which ruled the territory in medieval times

<text>A central school was a selective secondary education school with a focus on technical and commercial skills in the English education system. It was positioned between the more academic grammar schools and the ordinary elementary schools where most pupils prior to 1944 were educated to 14 years of age.

Central schools were established in England and Wales following the Education Act 1918, although London County Council had already introduced them in 1910 and ran fifty by 1918.

Following the introduction of the tripartite system of selective education and the changes introduced by the Education Act 1944, many central schools became Secondary Modern schools or the premises otherwise absorbed in the post-WWII education system.

<doc id="366312" wikidata="Q455752" url="?curid=366312" title="Town meeting">
<text>Town meeting, also known as an &quot;open town meeting&quot;, is a form of local government in which eligible town residents can directly participate in an assembly which determines the governance of their town. Unlike representative town meeting where only elected representatives can participate in the governing assembly, any town voter may participate in an open town meeting. This form is distinct from town hall meetings held by elected officials to communicate with their constituents, which have no decision-making power.

At a town meeting, attendees determine the ordinances or rules of the town, its boards and commissions, elected and appointed positions, capital investments, expenditures, budgets, and local taxation, as well as the manner and frequency of future town meetings. Because towns self-govern and maintain their autonomy, town meetings vary from state to state, as well as from town to town. 

Since town residents directly participate in their own governance and represent themselves without any intermediary, town meeting is an example of direct democracy,
and examined as a case study in democratic theory. 

The town meeting form is used in portions of the United States, principally in New England, where it has been the primary form of town government since the 17th century. 

== History ==
Town meetings have been practiced in the U.S. region of New England since colonial times and in some western states since at least the late 19th century. Town meeting can also refer to meetings of other governmental bodies such as regional water or school districts. While the uses and laws vary by town and state, the general form is for residents of the town to periodically gather and serve as the legislative body, voting on finances, ordinances, and other matters of governance.

Records of early New England governance are sparse, leading to debate about the origin of town meeting. One interpretation is that it was adapted from local vestry meetings held in 17th century England that were responsible for financial decisions of the parish church. Another is that it stemmed from New England colonists aboard the Mayflower who, upon landing in Plymouth, Massachusetts, gathered to adopt their own rules of governance, the Mayflower Compact. In colonial New England there was very little separation between church and town governance, but town meeting continued to play a secular role after the disestablishment of the state churches, forming the core of government for most New England towns today.

== Democratic theory ==
Since the turn of the nineteenth century, political scientists have characterized New England&#x27;s town meetings as notable examples of direct democracy. In 1831, political philosopher Alexis de Tocqueville visited several townships in Massachusetts, remarking in the first volume of &quot;Democracy in America&quot; (1835) that town governments in New England appeared to show greater political independence than French &quot;communes&quot; or other municipal bodies in Europe. Tocqueville believed that town meetings, with direct power given to attending residents, trained citizens for participation in broader democratic society. Town meetings also influenced American republican thought particularly for Thomas Jefferson, who believed they were &quot;the perfect exercise of self-government and for its preservation&quot;.

Town meetings represent some of the only modern institutions, apart from some townships in Minnesota and the cantons of Switzerland, in which everyday citizens can regularly participate in &quot;face-to-face&quot; assemblies that deliberate binding collective action decisions in the form of laws. Proponents of communitarianism and civic republicanism in political thought, notably Frank M. Bryan of the University of Vermont, have advocated town meetings as forms of direct democracy based upon unitary values. 

Deliberative democrats, such as James Fishkin, have presented the town meeting as a setting of &quot;empowered participation&quot; in which thoughtful deliberation between all participating individuals can coexist with a sense of engaged citizenship and responsibility for solving local problems. Both camps, however, note the difficulties of maintaining the benefits of town meetings when the format is scaled to larger groups.

Other political scientists have expressed more skepticism toward town meetings on the basis of their poor attendance and lack of representativeness. Jane Mansbridge and Donald L. Robinson have argued that town meetings in Vermont and Massachusetts feature extremely low turnout in part because they last for a full working day, leading to disproportionate representation of seniors and non-working residents in the meetings. As participation is still voluntary for attendees of the meeting, Mansbridge also notes differences in participation on the basis of education and class when conflicts arise, writing that &quot;the face-to-face assembly lets those who have no trouble speaking defend their interests; it does not give the average citizen comparable protection.&quot; Feminist critics have also identified mixed results in town meetings. While women&#x27;s rates of attendance at town meetings was nearly equal relative to men&#x27;s, their participation in discussion relative to men declined as the size of the town increased.

== Connecticut ==
Connecticut town meetings are usually bound to a published agenda; meeting participants can not alter proposed items or add new business. Each town determines the method, frequency, and range of governance for its town meeting and codifies these in its ordinances or town charter. 

A moderator is chosen at the start of each meeting, which is typically held in a public venue, either in the town itself or nearby. Votes are taken by voice, and if close by show of hands. 

In towns with an open town meeting form, all registered voters of the town are eligible to participate in and vote at town meetings. Representative town meeting is used by some larger towns, where voters elect representatives to participate in town meetings, similar to a town council. Some towns use a financial town meeting form where an open town meeting exists with limited jurisdiction to vote solely on financial affairs while the town&#x27;s legislative powers have been vested in a town council.

Town meetings may have binding votes for some items in which the meeting participants vote to approve or deny the measure. Some towns require a referendum for items such as annual budgets and changes to the town&#x27;s ordinances. For those items, the town meeting votes to whether or not to send the issue to a referendum, which is held at a later date pursuant to the schedule laid out in that town&#x27;s ordinances.

== Maine ==
In Maine, the town meeting system originated during the period when the District of Maine was part of Massachusetts. Most cities and towns operate under the town meeting form of government or a modified version of it. Maine annual town meetings traditionally are held in March. Special town meetings also may be called from time to time.

The executive agency of town government is an elected, part-time board, known as the Board of Selectmen, having three, five, or seven members. Between sessions, the board of selectmen interprets the policy set at Town Meeting and is assigned numerous duties including: approving all town non-school expenditures, authorizing highway construction and repair, serving as town purchasing agent for non-school items, issuing licenses, and overseeing the conduct of all town activities. Often the part-time selectmen also serve as town assessors, overseers of the poor, and road commissioners. Generally, there are other elected town officers whose duties are specified by law. These may include clerks, assessors, tax collectors, treasurers, school committee members, constables, and others.

In 1927 the town of Camden adopted a special charter and became the first Maine town to apply the manager concept to the town meeting-selectmen framework. Under this system, the manager is administrative head of town government, responsible to the select board for the administration of all departments under its control. The manager&#x27;s duties include acting as purchasing agent, seeing that laws and ordinances are enforced, making appointments and removals, and fixing the compensation of appointees. (See also: Council–manager government.)

From 1927 to 1939, eleven other Maine towns adopted special act charters similar to the Camden charter. Today, 135 Maine towns have the town meeting-selectmen-manager system, while 209 use the town meeting-selectmen system.

== Massachusetts ==
=== History ===
The town meeting &quot;was the original and protean vessel of local authority.&quot; The early meetings were informal, with all men in town likely participating. Even when it did not fully exercise it, &quot;the power of the town meeting knew no limit.&quot; Town meeting
created principles to regulate taxation and land distribution; it bought land for town use and forbade the use of it forever to those who could not pay their share within a month; it decided the number of pines each family could cut from the swamp and which families could cover their house with clapboard. The men who went to that town meeting hammered out the abstract principles under which they would live and regulated the most minute details of their lives. The decisions they made then affected the lives of their children and grandchildren.
Town meeting often had a reputation for being &quot;active, suspicious, contradictory, and cantankerous&quot;, but it was well regarded by others.

In 1692, the Great and General Court declared that final authority on bylaws rested with town meetings and not selectmen. Two years later, in 1694, the General Court took authority to appoint assessors from selectmen and gave it to town meetings. An act of the colonial legislature gave town meeting the right to elect its own moderators in 1715, but this had already been in practice for several years in towns such as Dedham.

A colony law required all voters to be church members until 1647, though it may not have been enforced. The law changed in 1647, requiring voters to be above 24 years of age. The colony added a new requirement that a man must own taxable property with a value of at least 20 pounds in 1658 and increased that sum to 80 pounds in 1670. The 1670 law had a grandfather clause allowing all those who previously were qualified to keep the franchise. In 1691, the property requirement was lowered back to 20 pounds.

In provincial elections, only church members could vote. The number continued to fall from there. While in many respects Massachusetts society resembled England, the franchise was more widespread in the colony than it was in the mother country, as were the powers of local elected officials.

=== Forms ===
Open town meeting is the form of town meeting in which all registered voters of a town are eligible to vote, together acting as the town&#x27;s legislature. Town Meeting is typically held annually in the spring, often over the course of several evenings, but there is also provision to call additional special meetings. Open town meeting is direct democracy, while its alternatives, representative town meeting and town council, are representative democracy.

It is a form of government typical of smaller municipalities in the New England region of the United States. In Massachusetts, towns with fewer than 6,000 residents must adopt the &quot;open town meeting&quot; form of government. Massachusetts towns with 6,000 or more residents may adopt either open town meeting or the &quot;representative town meeting&quot; form of government.

The select board summons the town meeting into existence by issuing the warrant, which is the list of items—known as articles—to be voted on, with descriptions of each article.

The Moderator presides over the meeting, making sure that the town&#x27;s chosen rules of parliamentary procedure are followed, judging the results of voice votes or shows of hands and counting votes that are too close to be judged by eye or ear. The Finance Committee, often called the Advisory Committee, makes recommendations on articles dealing with money and often drafts the proposed budget. The Town Clerk serves as the clerk of the meeting by recording its results. Town Counsel may make legal recommendations on any articles of the warrant, to ensure town meeting is acting lawfully.

Massachusetts towns having at least 6,000 residents may adopt a representative town meeting system through the normal charter change process in the State Legislature. Representative Town Meetings function largely the same as an Open Town Meeting except that not all registered voters can vote. The townspeople instead elect Town Meeting Members by precinct to represent them and to vote on the issues for them. Before it became a city in 2018, Framingham, which at the time was the largest town in the Commonwealth by population, had 216 representatives in Town Meeting, twelve from each precinct.

=== Scheduling ===
An annual town meeting is held in the spring and may also be known as the annual budget meeting. Towns were once required to hold their annual town meetings between February 1 and May 31, but Chapter 85 of the Acts of 2008 extended this window of time to June 30. (Town fiscal years start on July 1.) At this meeting, the town budgets for the new fiscal year and takes care of any outstanding housekeeping items from the current fiscal year. It may also vote on non-budgetary warrant articles, including the town&#x27;s general and zoning bylaws.

An article may be placed on the warrant by the Selectmen, sometimes at the request of town departments, or by a petition signed by at least ten registered voters of the town.

Special town meetings&#x27; may be held whenever necessary, usually to deal with financial or other pertinent issues that develop between annual town meetings. They function the same as an annual town meeting, only the number of signatures required on a petition rises to 100. While the Selectmen generally call such a meeting, voters may call one through petition, and the number of signatures required on a petition to call a special town meeting is 200 or 20% of the registered voters, whichever number is lower. The selectmen have 45 days from the date of receiving such a petition to hold a special town meeting.

== New Hampshire ==
In New Hampshire, towns, village districts (which can deal with various government activities but usually concern public water supplies) and school districts have the option of choosing one of two types of annual meeting: Traditional meetings, and ballot-vote meetings that are known informally as &quot;SB 2&quot; or &quot;Senate Bill 2&quot;. A variation of SB 2 and representative town meeting are also allowed under state law but as of 2015 are not in use by any community.

=== Traditional town meetings ===
Traditional town meeting is held annually on the second Tuesday of March to choose town officers, approve a town budget, and approve large contracts. Town selectmen can call special town meetings throughout the year as needed, although these must be approved by a judge if they affect the budget. State law prohibits town meetings from being held on the election day in November.

State law lets the town moderator adjourn a long-running meeting and reconvene it at a later date to finish the town&#x27;s business.

Any town meeting or adjournment thereof must have its time and place published with three days&#x27; notice, along with the warrant specifying each issue to be decided. Town meeting can amend the warrant articles before voting on them, and can conduct non-binding discussions of other issues, but cannot make other binding votes without this notice to town voters.

Attendance wanes over the course of a town meeting, and a traditional tactic was to re-vote after many on the opposite side had gone home. In 1991, the state enacted RSA 40:10, giving town meeting members the right to bar reconsideration of a specified vote (or any &quot;action...which involves the same subject matter&quot;). If a town meeting does not bar reconsideration and later does vote to reconsider a decision, the issue can be taken up only at an adjourned session at least one week later.

=== Official ballot referenda (SB 2) ===
Official ballot referenda, or the SB 2 format, provides that town voters make binding decisions not at town meeting but by secret ballot in the municipal election. To adopt SB 2, or to revert to traditional town meetings, a question to that effect on the municipal ballot must win a three-fifths majority. This format was instituted by the state legislature in 1995 because of concerns that modern lifestyles had made it difficult for people to attend traditional town meetings. In 2019, however, the law was changed so that the three-fifths majority would have to occur at town meeting itself: The town meeting would have to vote to remove its own final decisions to the municipal ballot.

Under SB 2, a first session, called a &quot;Deliberative Session&quot;, is held about a month prior to the town election. This session is similar in many ways to the traditional town meeting. However, unlike the town meeting, while the wording and dollar amounts of proposed ballot measures may be amended, no actual voting on the merits of the proposals takes place.

Deliberative sessions are less well attended, in bodies that have adopted SB 2, than are plenary town meetings in bodies that have not adopted SB 2, as their decisions are not final. However, the final vote by secret ballot attracts more voters than town meetings do because of the shorter time requirement, and absentees can vote.

Deliberative sessions have been charged with &quot;sabotaging&quot; the intent of a ballot question; for example, changing a warrant article, &quot;To see if the Town will raise and appropriate (amount) for (purpose)&quot; to merely read, &quot;To see.&quot; A 2011 law barred deliberative sessions from deleting the subject matter of a warrant article. In 2016, petitioners in Exeter submitted an article to place on the ballot an advisory &quot;vote of no confidence&quot; in a school official, and the deliberative session removed the word &quot;no&quot;.

The second session, held on a set election day, is when issues such as the town&#x27;s budget and other measures, known as warrant articles, are voted upon. When adopting SB 2, towns or school districts may hold elections on the second Tuesday in March, the second Tuesday in April, or the second Tuesday in May. The election dates may be changed by majority vote. If a vote is taken to approve the change of the local elections, the date becomes effective the following year.

In 2002, according to the University of New Hampshire Center for Public Policy studies, 171 towns in New Hampshire had traditional town meeting, while 48 had SB 2. Another 15 municipalities, most of them incorporated cities, had no annual meeting. The study found that 102 school districts had traditional town meeting, 64 had SB 2 meeting and 10 had no annual meeting.

Because traditional-meeting communities tend to be smaller, only one third of the state&#x27;s population was governed by traditional town meetings in 2002 and only 22 percent by traditional school-district meetings.

=== Official ballot town council ===
The Official Ballot Town Council is a variant form of the Town Council, in which certain items are to be placed on the ballot to be voted on by the registered voters. This process mimics the SB 2 process, except that the Town Council makes the determination of what items will go on the ballot.

=== Budgetary town meeting ===
The Budgetary Town Meeting is a variation of the Open Meeting, but only the annual town operating budget as presented by the governing body can be voted on by the registered voters. When a town charter provides for a Budgetary Town Meeting it also must establish the procedures for the transfer of funds among various departments, funds, accounts and agencies as may be necessary during the year.

=== Representative town meeting ===
State law (RSA 49-D:3 (paragraph III)) gives the alternative of a representative town meeting, similar to that of a town council, in which voters elect a small number of residents to act as the legislative body in their stead. Representative town meeting follows the same procedure as traditional town meetings, except they cannot decide matters that state law requires to be placed on the official town ballot. Representative town meeting is selected by a town charter, which may require additional matters to go onto the town ballot.

As of 2006, this form of government is not used in any town or school district in New Hampshire.

=== Moderator ===
Moderators are elected to two-year terms on even years in towns and are elected in city wards at every other city election. The moderator presides over town meetings, regulates their business, prescribes rules of procedure, decides questions of order, and declares the outcome of each vote. Town meeting voters can override the moderator&#x27;s procedural rulings.

The moderator also has the authority to postpone and reschedule the town meeting (or deliberative session, if SB 2 is in effect) to another reasonable date, place, and time certain in the case of a weather emergency in which the moderator reasonably believes the roads to be hazardous or unsafe.

The 2017 municipal election was preceded by a large snowstorm, and the Secretary of State clarified that this statutory authority does not extend to postponing elections, but moderators in several towns did so anyway. In 2019, the NH General Court passed, and the Governor signed, SB 104, which created a procedure to postpone elections. It empowers the Town moderator, based on National Weather Service reports and after consultations with other officials and the Secretary of State, to postpone elections. As stated in at the beginning of the bill, it &quot;provides for the postponement of town, city, village, and school district elections in the event of a winter storm warning, blizzard warning, or ice storm warning. The bill also allows any person to vote absentee in the event of such a warning if he or she has concerns for his or her safety.&quot;

== New York ==
Town meetings were the rule in New York from the colonial period into the 20th century. They were typically held between February 1 and May 1 of each year primarily for the election of town officials but were also empowered to set &quot;rules for fences and for impounding animals&quot;, supporting the poor, raising taxes, and to &quot;determine any other question lawfully submitted to them&quot;. In the late 1890s the state legislature shifted the meetings – by this time no more than town elections – to biennial to conform to the pattern of federal, state, and municipal elections in the state&#x27;s cities. It also permitted, and later directed, town meetings to be held in November. That process was not complete until the 1920s. Laws adopted in 1932 for the first time refer to &quot;Biennial town elections&quot;, stating that these were &quot;a substitute for a town meeting...and a reference in any law to a town meeting or special town meeting shall be construed as reference to a town election&quot;. The state&#x27;s school districts (independent units with taxing powers) voted on budgets and capital levies and elected school board members in town-meeting style until the late 1950s.

== Rhode Island ==
Due to a change in the state&#x27;s constitution, Rhode Island municipalities have a greater degree of home rule compared to the other New England states. Like Connecticut, a few towns utilize a so-called Financial Town Meeting in which an Open Town Meeting exists with limited jurisdiction to vote only on financial affairs and the town&#x27;s legislative powers have been vested in a Town Council. The direct democracy tradition is now uncommon in Rhode Island. Ten towns have town meeting governments: Barrington, Exeter, Foster, Glocester, Hopkinton, Little Compton, Richmond, Scituate, Tiverton, and West Greenwich.

== Vermont ==
Vermont towns are normally required to hold an annual town meeting on the first Tuesday in March at a place designated by the select board. The date of the annual Town meeting may be changed by a vote of the citizens at a Town meeting duly warned for that purpose. The purpose of town meeting is to elect municipal officers, approve annual budgets and conduct any other business. All cities and some towns in Vermont operate under charters instead of general legislation (see special legislation). The cities and chartered towns, except for South Burlington, are required by the terms of their charters to hold an annual town meeting, on Town Meeting Day. Many towns vote on matters of substance (e.g., budgets, elected officials, etc.) by secret ballot (also known as Australian ballot). However, there is no state law that requires towns to vote by Australian ballot; several towns still conduct all business &quot;from the floor&quot;.

Cities and towns are governed by either a city council or a select board. They are fully empowered to act on most issues and are generally referred to as the municipality&#x27;s legislative body. But all town budgets (and those of other independent taxing authorities) must be approved by plebiscite; explaining the local government&#x27;s budget request to the voters is the principal business of Town Meeting. Voters at Town Meeting may also vote on non-binding resolutions, and may place items on the ballot for the following year&#x27;s meeting.

There is no general requirement for chartered municipalities to observe town meeting or to put their budgets to plebiscite. When the Town of South Burlington was re-chartered as the City of South Burlington in 1971, the new charter provided for city elections in April and required only budget increases of 10% or more per annum to be placed before voters. No other municipality has been granted such a charter by the legislature, and there is strong sentiment against making future exceptions.

According to the Vermont Secretary of State&#x27;s Citizen&#x27;s Guide to Town Meeting, Vermont gives state employees the day off on town meeting day. Vermont &quot;law also gives a private employee the right to take unpaid leave from work to attend his or her annual town meeting, subject to the essential operation of the business or government. Employees must provide at least seven days notice to their employer to take advantage of this right to attend town meeting. Students who are over 18 also have the right to attend town meeting&quot; and not be declared truant.

=== Moderator ===
Moderators are elected to one-year terms. The moderator&#x27;s duties include reviewing the warrant (published agenda) for town meeting, presiding over town meeting, deciding questions of order, making public declarations of each vote passed, and prescribing rules of the proceeding.

== Other states ==
Towns in several western states and counties also practice town meeting, though generally with more limited powers. Michigan was the first western state to adopt the town meeting system, but it was initially very restricted in its function.

Minnesota has had town meetings as the policy-setting bodies of townships. They were required once the voting population of a township reached 25 persons. Townships still hold town meetings.

== Other countries ==

=== Spain ===
Some small municipalities of Spain operate under a town meeting system called a Concejo abierto (&quot;open council&quot;) that dates from the middle ages. The Spanish constitution allows municipalities with fewer than 100 people, as well as municipalities that have traditionally used the system, to operate under an open council.

==== Basque Country ====
The best-known example of the Spanish town meeting system of government was found in the Middle Ages in the Basque Country of northern Spain. Known as the anteiglesia (literally &quot;in front of the church&quot; from the Latin - and not &quot;anti&quot;) all the residents of a town would meet outside the door of the largest church and vote on local matters. They would also elect a &quot;sindico&quot; to represent them in the regional assembly. The village or town was divided into &quot;cofradías&quot;, which dealt with day-to-day administration in each of the town&#x27;s parishes.

The system was revived in the municipality of Iurreta, Biscay, in 1990.

=== Switzerland ===
Town meetings are the usual legislative body of the smaller municipalities of Switzerland, that is of approximately 90% of all Swiss municipalities. The meetings are usually held twice a year. At the cantonal level, some regions also hold Landsgemeinde, annual meetings for deciding on legislative referendums. In the 17th century this was common across the region, but in the 21st century the meetings continue to exist only in the cantons of Appenzell Innerrhoden and Glarus.

<text>Thomas Hawksley ( – ) was an English civil engineer of the 19th century, particularly associated with early water supply and coal gas engineering projects. Hawksley was, with John Frederick Bateman, the leading British water engineer of the nineteenth century and was personally responsible for upwards of 150 water-supply schemes, in the British Isles and overseas.

==Biography==
The son of John Hawksley and Sarah Thompson and born in Arnot Hill House, Arnold, near Nottingham on , Hawksley was largely self-taught from the age of 15 onwards—despite his education at Nottingham High School—having at that point become articled to a local firm of architects under the supervision of Edward Staveley that also undertook a variety of water-related engineering projects.

Locally, he remains particularly associated with schemes in his home county. He was engineer to the Nottingham Gas Light and Coke Company and Nottingham Waterworks Company for more than half a century, having, early in his career, completed the Trent Bridge waterworks (1831). This scheme delivered Britain&#x27;s first high pressure &#x27;constant supply&#x27;, preventing contamination entering the supply of clean water mains.

Hawksley first rose to national prominence at the time of the health of towns inquiry in 1844. His advocacy of a constant supply of water to consumers brought him immediate acclaim. Edwin Chadwick adopted Hawksley as an ally for a time, but Hawksley adopted a more pragmatic approach and was prepared to act for others&#x27; undertakings. This approach led him to be appointed to many major water supply projects across England, including schemes for Liverpool, Sheffield, Leicester, Lincoln, Leeds, Derby, Darlington, Oxford, Cambridge, Sunderland, Wakefield and Northampton. He also undertook drainage projects, including schemes for Birmingham, Worcester and Windsor.

In 1852, Hawksley set up his own engineering practice in Westminster, London. He was the first president of the Institution of Gas Engineers and Managers (serving for three years from 1863), a Fellow of the Royal Society, and was elected President of the Institution of Civil Engineers in 1871 (a post his son Charles later occupied in 1901).

Between 1869 and 1879, Hawksley acted as consultant to the construction of Lindley Wood, Swinsty and Fewston reservoirs for the Leeds Waterworks Company. At Tunstall Reservoir in 1876, and at Cowm Reservoir in 1877–78, he is credited with the first two uses of pressure grouting to control water leakage under an embankment dam. Glossop comments, &quot;This procedure of rock grouting, which is now standard practice in dam construction, was an invention of the greatest importance to engineering practice, but its adoption by civil engineers was slow.&quot;

Hawksley died in Kensington, London in 1893 and is buried in his family plot at Brookwood Cemetery, Surrey. In December 2007 a granite memorial was placed over his previously unmarked grave.

Thomas Hawksley was the first of four generations of eminent water engineers, having been followed into the profession by his son, Charles Hawksley, grandson Kenneth Phipson Hawksley, and great grandson, Thomas Edwin Hawksley (died 1972). The Institution of Mechanical Engineers still holds an annual lecture in his memory. 

A memorial to him was placed in a stone wall at Rivington in 2023, the memorial reads &#x27;In memory of Thomas Hawksley FRS, Civil Engineer and Architect, of the Rivington Reservoir System build 1850 to 1857&#x27; the memorial features masonic symbols.

<text>Milica &quot;Mila&quot; Mulroney (Serbian Cyrillic: Милица &quot;Мила&quot; Пивнички; née Pivnički; born July 13, 1953) is the widow of the 18th Prime Minister of Canada, Brian Mulroney. She was notable for taking on a greater role during her husband&#x27;s tenure than previous spouses of Canadian prime ministers and for her work for children&#x27;s charities; she was also criticized for her lavish spending habits. She is the chancellor of St. Francis Xavier University in Nova Scotia, where her late husband attended.

==Early life==
Mulroney was born Milica Pivnički to Serbian Orthodox parents and Bogdanka (née Ilić) in Sarajevo, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Yugoslavia. Her first years were spent in the city of Sarajevo where her father practised medicine. In 1956, Dr. Pivnički took a research fellowship position at the Royal Victoria Hospital&#x27;s Allan Memorial Institute of Psychiatry in Montreal. While his pregnant wife Bogdanka waited to join him, she moved with young Milica back to their hometown of Novi Bečej, Serbia. Finally, two years later, in 1958, she and their two children (five-year-old Milica and one-year-old Jovan) emigrated to Canada and joined Dimitrije in Montreal. Mila, the elder child, studied engineering at Concordia University, but did not graduate.

At age 19, she married Brian Mulroney, then a 34-year-old lawyer, on May 26, 1973. Both were involved with the Progressive Conservatives (PC) in Westmount. They have one daughter, Caroline, and three sons, Ben, Mark, and Nicolas. Their youngest child, Nicolas, was born while the family was living in 24 Sussex Drive.

== During Brian Mulroney tenure ==
Mila was a radical change from the wives of recent prime ministers—the feminist Maureen McTeer and Margaret Trudeau. Being a housewife, she greatly appealed to that demographic, especially in her responses to criticism from prominent feminists (including, in 1987, remarks from Sheila Copps).
Many PC campaign buttons featured both Mulroney&#x27;s face and hers, and Ontario Premier Bill Davis commented to Brian, &quot;Mila will get you more votes for you than you will for yourself.&quot;

She assumed a greater role than many Prime Ministers&#x27; wives while Mulroney was in office by campaigning for several children&#x27;s charities. Her role, which some claimed was trying to become a &quot;First Lady&quot;, was criticized (especially when she hired a personal office and staff and for her redecoration of the Prime Minister&#x27;s residence). Her shopping became tabloid fodder, with some in the press dubbing her &quot;Imelda&quot; for her love of shoes (she had over 100 pairs). In her book &quot;On the Take&quot;, Stevie Cameron accused Mila of trying to sell her old furniture to the government for much more than its value.

== After Brian Mulroney tenure ==
Mila Mulroney is former celebrity patron of the Canadian Cystic Fibrosis Foundation and was a director of Astral. In 2019, she was knighted in Serbia by Ivica Dačić (Knight of the St. Sava Order of Diplomatic Pacifism). She was announced as the next chancellor of St. Francis Xavier University in 2024.

<doc id="366317" wikidata="Q161242" url="?curid=366317" title="List of rivers of Germany">
<text>This article lists rivers that are located in Germany, either entirely or partially, or that form the country&#x27;s international borders. The rivers of Germany flow into either the Baltic Sea (), the Black Sea or the North Sea (). 

The main rivers of Germany include:
* flowing into the Baltic Sea: Oder
* flowing into the Black Sea: Danube (and its main tributaries Inn, Isar, and Lech)
* flowing into the North Sea: Rhine (and its main tributaries Moselle, Main and Neckar), Weser and Elbe (and its main tributaries Havel and Saale)

An alphabetical list of all German rivers that have an article in Wikipedia appears at the end of the article.

==Sorted by drainage basin==
Rivers that flow into the sea are sorted geographically, along the coast. Rivers that flow into other rivers are sorted by the proximity of their points of confluence to the sea (the lower in the list, the more upstream).

Some rivers (the Meuse, for example) do not flow through Germany themselves, but they are mentioned for having German tributaries. They appear in &quot;italics&quot;.

For clarity, only rivers that are longer than (or have longer tributaries) are included below (see alphabetical list for a more comprehensive list).

<text>The United Malays National Organisation (UMNO; ), is a nationalist right-wing political party in Malaysia. As the oldest national political party within Malaysia (since its inception in 1946), UMNO has been known as Malaysia&#x27;s &quot;Grand Old Party&quot;. 

UMNO is a founding and the principal dominant member of the Barisan Nasional (BN) coalition, which taken along with its predecessor Alliance, had been the main governing party of Malaysia from the independence of Malaya in 1957 until its defeat in the 2018 general election. From 1957 to 2018, every Prime Minister of Malaysia was also the President of UMNO. It has since returned to power twice as a result of the 2020-2022 Malaysian political crisis, firstly as a partner in a Perikatan Nasional-led government and subsequently as the leading party in a BN-led government with UMNO Vice President Ismail Sabri Yaakob serving as Prime Minister. 

A race-focused party, UMNO&#x27;s goals are to uphold the aspirations of Malay nationalism, the racial concept of &quot;Ketuanan Melayu&quot; (lit. Malay Supremacy), the dignity of the Malay race, the religion of Islam, as well as of the country itself. The party also aspires to protect the Malay culture as the national culture and to uphold, defend and expand Islam across Malaysia.

In the 2018 UMNO leadership election, which was considered by many as crucial to the party&#x27;s progression, former Deputy Prime Minister Ahmad Zahid Hamidi was elected as UMNO President in a three-way contest, defeating former UMNO Youth Chief Khairy Jamaluddin, and UMNO veteran Tengku Razaleigh Hamzah.

== History ==
After the British returned to Malaya in the aftermath of World War II, the Malayan Union was formed. However, the Union was met with much opposition due to its constitutional framework, which allegedly threatened Malay sovereignty over Malaya.

The first phase of the journey of the UMNO party was the result of a combination of 41 Malay associations in the Malay Peninsula at that time led by Ahmad Boestamam who presented a memorandum to Sultan Ismail ibni Sultan Ibrahim who became the Sultan of Johor at that time to reject the Malayan Union proposal brought by the British.

In the second phase, a series of Malay congresses were held, culminating in the formation of the nationalist party, UMNO on 10 May 1946 at the Third Malay Congress in Johor Bahru, with Onn Jaafar as its leader. UMNO strongly opposed the Malayan Union, but originally did not seek political power. UMNO had no choice but continue playing a supporting role to the British colonial administration. The British cooperated with UMNO leaders and helped to defeat the communist insurgency.

In 1949, after the Malayan Union had been replaced by the semi-autonomous Federation of Malaya, UMNO shifted its focus to politics and governance. According to at least one official school textbook published during UMNO&#x27;s time in government, the party fought for other races once they were at the helm of the country.

In 1951, Onn Jaafar left UMNO after failing to open its membership to non-Malay Malayans to form the Independence of Malaya Party. Tunku Abdul Rahman replaced Onn as UMNO President. In the following year, the Kuala Lumpur branch of UMNO formed an &quot;ad hoc&quot; and temporary electoral pact with the Selangor branch of Malayan Chinese Association to avoid contesting the same seats in the Kuala Lumpur municipal council elections. UMNO and MCA eventually carried nine out of the twelve seats, dealing a crushing blow to the IMP. After several other successes in local council elections, the coalition was formalised as an &quot;Alliance&quot; in 1954.

In 1954, state elections were held. In these elections, the Alliance won 226 of the 268 seats nationwide. In the same year, a Federal Legislative Council was formed, comprising 100 seats. 52 would be elected, and the rest would be appointed by the British High Commissioner. The Alliance demanded that 60 of the seats be elected, but despite the Tunku flying out to London to negotiate, the British held firm. Elections for the council were held in 1955, and the Alliance, which had now expanded to include the Malayan Indian Congress, issued a manifesto stating its goals of achieving independence by 1959, requiring a minimum of primary school education for all children, protecting the rights of the Malay rulers as constitutional monarchs, ending the Communist emergency, and reforming the civil service through the hiring of more Malayans as opposed to foreigners.

When the results were released, it emerged that the Alliance had won 51 of the 52 seats contested, with the other seat going to PAS (the Pan-Malayan Islamic Party, a group of Islamists that split from UMNO). The Tunku became the first Chief Minister of Malaya.

Throughout this period, the Malayan Emergency had been on-going. The Malayan National Liberation Army (MNLA), the armed wing of the Malayan Communist Party (MCP), committed sabotage campaigns against the British by disrupting transportation and communication networks, attacking police stations, burning down factories, with the goal of gaining independence for Malaya by making British rule in Malaya too expensive to maintain. The colonial government declared the MCP, along with several left-wing political groups, illegal in 1948. In 1955, the Alliance government together with the British High Commissioner declared an amnesty for the communist insurgents who surrendered. Representatives from the Alliance government also met with leaders of the MCP in an attempt to resolve the conflict peacefully, as their manifesto in the election stated. Chin Peng, the MCP Secretary-General, insisted that the MCP be allowed to contest elections and be declared a legal political party as a pre-condition to laying down arms. However, the Tunku rejected this, leading to an impasse.

In 1956, the Tunku led a group of negotiators, comprising Alliance politicians and representatives of the Malay rulers, to London. There, they brokered a deal with the British government for independence. The date of independence was set as 31 August 1957 on the condition that an independent commission is set up to draft a constitution for the country. The Alliance government was also required to avoid seizing British and other foreign assets in Malaya. A defence treaty would also be signed.

The Reid Commission, led by Lord Reid, was formed to draft the constitution. Although enshrining concepts such as federalism and a constitutional monarchy, the proposed constitution also contained provisions protecting special rights for the Malays, such as quotas in admission to higher education and the civil service, and making Islam the official religion of the federation. It also made Malay the official language of the nation, although the right to vernacular education in Chinese and Tamil would be protected. Although the Tunku and the Malay rulers had asked the Reid Commission to ensure that &quot;&quot;in an independent Malaya all nationals should be accorded equal rights, privileges and opportunities and there must not be discrimination on grounds of race and creed&quot;,&quot; the Malay privileges, which many in UMNO backed, were cited as necessary by the Reid Commission as a form of affirmative action that would eventually be phased out. These measures were included as Articles 3, 152 and 153 of the Constitution.

Independence was declared by the Tunku in Merdeka Stadium on 31 August 1957, marking a transition into a new era of Malayan and Malaysian politics.

=== Independence ===

In Malaya&#x27;s first general elections in 1959, the Alliance coalition led by UMNO won 51.8% of the votes and captured 74 out of 104 seats, enough for a two-thirds majority in parliament, which would not only allow them to form the government again but amend the constitution at will. However, for the Alliance, the election was marred by internal strife when MCA leader Lim Chong Eu demanded his party be allowed to contest 40 of the 104 seats available. When the Tunku rejected this, many of Lim&#x27;s supporters resigned, and ran in the election as independents, which cost the Alliance some seats.

In 1961, the Tunku mooted the idea of forming a federation named &quot;Malaysia&quot;, which would consist of the British colonies of Singapore, Sabah, Sarawak, and also the British Protectorate of Brunei. The reasoning behind this was that this would allow the federal government to control and combat communist activities, especially in Singapore. It was also feared that if Singapore achieved independence, it would become a base for Chinese chauvinists to threaten Malayan sovereignty. To balance out the ethnic composition of the new nation, the other states, whose Malay and indigenous populations would balance out the Singaporean Chinese majority, were also included.

After much negotiation, a constitution was hammered out with some minor changes. For instance, the Malay privileges were now made available to all &quot;Bumiputra&quot;, a group comprising the Malays and other indigenous peoples of Malaysia. However, the new states were also granted some autonomy unavailable to the original nine states of Malaya. After negotiations in July 1963, it was agreed that Malaysia would come into being on 31 August 1963, consisting of Malaya, Singapore, Sabah and Sarawak. Brunei ultimately decided to opt out of the federation due in part to an armed revolt by the People&#x27;s Party (&quot;Parti Rakyat Brunei&quot;) which objected to the formation of Malaysia, and the Sultan of Brunei Omar Ali Saifuddien III&#x27;s demand that he be recognised as the most senior Malay ruler—a demand that was rejected.

The Philippines and Indonesia strenuously objected to this development, with Indonesia claiming Malaysia represented a form of neocolonialism and the Philippines claiming Sabah as its territory. The United Nations sent a commission to the region which approved the merger after having delayed the date of Malaysia&#x27;s formation to investigate. Despite further protests from the Indonesian President, Sukarno, the formation of Malaysia was proclaimed on 16 September 1963. Indonesia then declared a &quot;confrontation&quot; with Malaysia, sending commandos to perform guerilla attacks in East Malaysia (Sabah and Sarawak). The confrontation was ended when Suharto replaced Sukarno as president. The Philippines, which had withdrawn diplomatic recognition from Malaysia, also recognised Malaysia around the same time.

To reflect the change of name to Malaysia, UMNO&#x27;s coalition partners promptly altered their names to the Malaysian Chinese Association and the Malaysian Indian Congress. Several political parties in East Malaysia, especially Sarawak, also joined the Alliance to allow it to contest elections there.

In the 1963 Singapore state elections, the Alliance decided to challenge Lee Kuan Yew&#x27;s governing People&#x27;s Action Party through the Singapore Alliance Party. UMNO politicians actively campaigned in Singapore for the Singapore Alliance, contending that the Singapore Malays were being treated as second-class citizens under the Chinese-dominated PAP government. All of the UMNO-backed Malay candidates lost to PAP candidates. UMNO Secretary-General Syed Jaafar Albar travelled to Singapore to address the Malay populace. At one rally, he called the PAP Malay politicians un-Islamic and traitors to the Malay race, greatly straining PAP-UMNO relations. The PAP politicians, who saw this as a betrayal of an earlier agreement with the Alliance not to contest elections in Malaysia and Singapore respectively, decided on running on the mainland in the 1964 general election. Although the PAP contested nine Parliamentary seats and attracted large crowds at its rallies, it won only one seat. The strain in race relations caused by the communal lines along which the political factions had been drawn led to the 1964 Race Riots in Singapore.

Alliance leaders also were alarmed at Lee&#x27;s behaviour, which they considered unseemly for the Chief Minister of a state. They thought he was acting as if he were the Prime Minister of a sovereign nation. Finance Minister Tan Siew Sin of the MCA labelled Lee as the &quot;greatest, disruptive force in the entire history of Malaysia and Malaya.&quot; Lee now seemed determined to press forward politically and continue contesting elections nationwide, with the formation of the Malaysian Solidarity Council—a coalition of political parties which called for a &quot;Malaysian Malaysia&quot;, duplicating the effort introduced earlier by Dato&#x27; Onn Ja&#x27;afar.

On 7 August 1965, Prime Minister Tunku Abdul Rahman, seeing no alternative to avoid further bloodshed, advised the Parliament of Malaysia that it should vote to expel Singapore from Malaysia. Despite last-ditch attempts by PAP leaders, including Lee Kuan Yew, to keep Singapore as a state in the union, the Parliament on 9 August 1965 voted 126–0 in favour of the expulsion of Singapore.

Tunku opened his speech in Parliament with the words, &quot;In all the 10 years of my leadership of this House I have never had a duty so unpleasant as this to perform. The announcement which I am making concerns the separation of Singapore from the rest of the Federation.&quot; On that day, Lee Kuan Yew announced that Singapore was a sovereign independent nation and assumed the role of prime minister. After the separation and independence of Singapore in 1965, the Singapore branch of UMNO was renamed the Singapore Malay National Organisation (&quot;Pertubuhan Kebangsaan Melayu Singapura&quot;).

=== Post-separation ===
After the separation of Singapore from the Federation, the Alliance leaders focused on continuing its policies. One involved the Malay language, which was the official language of Malaysia. UMNO sought to reduce the reliance on English in government affairs. In this, it was aided by PAS, the Pan-Malaysian Islamic Party, which backed special rights for the Bumiputra, and the strengthening of Islam&#x27;s position in public affairs. However, the PAP&#x27;s Malaysian branch, which had now become Democratic Action Party (DAP), took a very strong stance against this, and continued the expelled PAP&#x27;s call for a &quot;Malaysian Malaysia&quot;. In 1968, the newly formed Parti Gerakan Rakyat Malaysia or Gerakan, led by Lim Chong Eu, also adopted the DAP&#x27;s stance.

Matters came to a head in the 1969 general election. When polling closed on the mainland peninsula (West Malaysia) on 10 May, it emerged the Alliance had won less than half of the popular vote, although it was assured of 66 out of 104 Parliamentary seats available. Much of the losses came from the MCA, thus straining relations between the two parties. However, the Alliance was dealt an even larger blow on the state level, losing control of Kelantan, Perak, and Penang.

A major riot broke out in the aftermath of the election on 13 May 1969. The Yang di-Pertuan Agong (King) declared a national emergency after being advised by the national government to do so. Parliament was suspended, with a National Operations Council (NOC) led by Deputy Prime Minister Abdul Razak Hussein of UMNO, taking over the government. Further polling in East Malaysia as a continuation of the general election was also postponed indefinitely. Although the Cabinet still met under the Tunku as Prime Minister, his role was largely symbolic, with Abdul Razak taking over the role of chief executive.

UMNO backbencher Mahathir Mohamad, who had lost his Parliamentary seat in the election, wrote a letter to the Tunku criticising his leadership. Mahathir organised a campaign with University of Malaya lecturer Raja Muktaruddin Daim, circulating his letter among the student bodies of local universities. Mass demonstrations broke out calling for &quot;Malay sovereignty&quot; and the Tunku&#x27;s ousting. After the riot, Home Affairs Minister Ismail Abdul Rahman and Abdul Razak agreed to expel Mahathir and former Executive Secretary of UMNO Musa Hitam from the party for breaching party discipline.

The suspended elections in East Malaysia were held in 1970, and restored the Alliance government&#x27;s two-thirds majority in parliament. On 31 August that year, the Tunku announced the national ideology of Rukun Negara and his planned retirement as Prime Minister in favour of Abdul Razak. He also stated Parliament would be restored the following year.

=== The New Economic Policy ===
After Abdul Razak succeeded the Tunku in 1970, he began asserting UMNO&#x27;s leadership in the Alliance more strongly. When the Tunku led the coalition, he had always consulted Alliance leaders regarding policy—if an Alliance leader objected, the policy was not passed. Under Abdul Razak, UMNO was the base of the Alliance and thus the government. The NOC which he led until Parliament reconvened consisted of 7 Malays, one Chinese and one Indian.

In Abdul Razak&#x27;s cabinet, the two most powerful men other than him were Ismail Abdul Rahman and Ghazali Shafie, who had declared the Westminster-style Parliamentary system inappropriate for Malaysia. Abdul Razak also readmitted to the party &quot;ultras&quot; who had been expelled, like Mahathir and Musa Hitam. Mahathir gained notoriety after his expulsion from UMNO by authoring &quot;The Malay Dilemma&quot;, a book promptly banned from Malaysia, which posited that the Malays are the definitive people of Malaysia, and thus deserved special rights as the sovereign people of the nation. It also controversially argued that the Malays needed affirmative action to overcome deficiencies in their genetic stock.

The Abdul Razak government announced the New Economic Policy in 1971. Its stated goal was to &quot;eventually eradicate poverty... irrespective of race&quot; through a &quot;rapidly expanding economy&quot; which emphasised to increase the Malays&#x27; share in the national economy to a reasonable portion between all the races. The NEP targeted a 30 per cent Malay share of the economy by 1990. The government contended that this would lead to a &quot;just society&quot; (&quot;Masyarakat Adil&quot;), the latter slogan being used to promote acceptance of the policy. Quotas in education and the civil service that the Constitution had explicitly provided for were expanded by the NEP, which also mandated government interference in the private sector. For instance, 30% of all shares in initial public offerings would be disbursed by the government to selective Bumiputeras. The old civil service hiring quota of 4 Malays for every non-Malay&#x27;s was effectively disregarded in practice; between 1969 and 1973, 98% of all new government employees were Malay. Five new universities were opened under the NEP, two of which were targeted to focus on the poor Malays and Muslim citizens.

Abdul Razak also began shoring up the government by bringing in several former opposition parties into the fold of the Alliance. Gerakan, PPP, PAS, and several former opposition parties in East Malaysia joined the coalition, which was renamed as Barisan Nasional. Barisan was formally registered as an organisation in 1974, the same year in which a general election was held.

There had been much internal conflict in the National Front regarding the election; in 1973, Lim Keng Yaik and several supporters of his aggressive pro-Chinese stance left the MCA for Gerakan. This contributed to internal strife, as the MCA was no longer the sole representative of Chinese interests in the National Front.

Discontent among student organisations in Malaysian universities soon posed a new problem for the UMNO-led government. After stories that children of rubber tappers had died after consuming poisonous wild yam due to poverty, university students reacted by staging the 1974 Baling demonstrations. The demonstrations resulted in the arrest of over 1,000 students, including Anwar Ibrahim who was detained under the Internal Security Act. In 1975, parliament passed amendments to the Universities and University Colleges Act which banned students from expressing support of or holding positions in any political party or trade union without written consent from the university&#x27;s Vice-Chancellor. The act also banned political demonstrations from being held on university campuses. In 1976, however, mass demonstrations were held at the MARA Institute of Technology, protesting the UUCA.

BN was also challenged in Sarawak after the 1974 election, which saw the Sarawak National Party led by James Wong become tied with the DAP as the largest opposition party in Parliament, both of them holding nine seats each. SNAP had campaigned against BN on a platform of opposing Chief Minister Abdul Rahman Ya&#x27;kub&#x27;s pro-Malay policies, charging them with alienating the rural indigenous natives of Sarawak, such as the Ibans. SNAP had been expelled from the Alliance in 1965 for supporting increased autonomy for Sarawak. In the aftermath of the election, Abdul Rahman ordered the detention of James Wong under the Sedition Act. SNAP elected a new leader, Leo Moggie Irok, who secured the release of Wong and the entry of SNAP into BN in 1976.

In Sabah, BN controlled the state government through the United Sabah National Organisation (USNO), which strongly backed UMNO&#x27;s pro-Malay and pro-Islam policies. In 1973, Islam was made the official Sabah state religion (the official religion of Sabah was originally Christianity, as permitted by the agreement signed before the merger), and usage of indigenous languages such as those of the Kadazan people was discontinued in favour of the Malay language. The USNO Chief Minister, Mustapha Harun, was also known for favouring political patronage as a means of allocating valuable timber contracts, and living an extravagant lifestyle, being ferried to his A$1 million Queensland home by jets provided with Sabahan public funds.

In 1978, UMNO planned for a new headquarters on a site at Jalan Tun Dr Ismail, initially as a twin tower with one of the towers being 40 stories high, costing a total of RM200 million.

===Mahathir era===

On 24 April 1987, UMNO held its Annual General Assembly and triennial Party election. The then Prime Minister and party President, Mahathir Mohamad, faced his first party election in 12 years, having been elected unopposed since the 1975 UMNO election.

The politics of the Malays, particularly UMNO politics, had undergone a sea change in the first few years of the Mahathir stewardship, and the party presidency was challenged for the second time in 41 years. In fact, in the early 1950s, Tunku Abdul Rahman&#x27;s presidency had also been challenged by C. M. Yusof, who later became the Speaker of the Dewan Rakyat, but Tunku was not properly considered an incumbent then, being only a care-taker president.

The 1987 contest was a vastly different matter. Mahathir was opposed by his very popular former Finance Minister, Tengku Razaleigh Hamzah. The press took to referring to Mahathir and his supporters as Team A, and Razaleigh&#x27;s camp as Team B. Team B included then Deputy Prime Minister Musa Hitam, who was also the incumbent Deputy President of UMNO seeking re-election, as well as Suhaimi Kamaruddin, the former head of UMNO Youth and president of the Belia 4B youth organisation.

Team B was critical of Mahathir&#x27;s policies, arguing that the Malaysian New Economic Policy had failed to benefit the poor Malays. It also criticised Mahathir&#x27;s leadership style, alleging he acted unilaterally without consulting other leaders in UMNO and the Barisan Nasional. Team B was also perceived as less Islamist than Mahathir&#x27;s faction.

Mahathir claimed that the charges against him were groundless, and suggested that his opponents were fracturing Malay unity and were only motivated by greed.

Eventually, Mahathir was returned to office. However, he was elected with such a small majority of 43 (761 against 718 votes) that questions were immediately raised about his mandate. Team B supporters, many of whom had been anticipating a victory of similar margins, suspected that the election had been fixed. The Team B candidate for Deputy President, Musa Hitam, had also been defeated by Abdul Ghafar Baba of Team A, while two of the three Vice Presidents were Team A candidates. The Supreme Council comprised 16 Team A candidates and 9 Team B candidates.

Allegations were made that several delegates who had voted were drawn from UMNO branches not properly registered. There were also several unproved allegations being bandied about that the balloting process had not been above board.

Nevertheless, Razaleigh pledged to support Mahathir, provided that a &quot;witch hunt&quot; was not launched. However, Mahathir promptly purged the government cabinet of all Team B members, and launched similar reshuffles in state and local governments.

On 25 June 1987, an appeal was filed by 12 of the UMNO delegates to have the assembly and the election of April 1987 declared null. After one of the delegates, Hussain bin Manap, withdrew unexpectedly in August from filing the appeal, the remaining litigants have since become famous as the &quot;UMNO 11.&quot; Although Razaleigh and Musa Hitam were not among the plaintiffs, it was widely believed that Razaleigh was funding the appeal.

After a series of interlocutory hearings over the discovery of documents that took more than seven months, the matter finally came before Justice Harun Hashim in the Kuala Lumpur High Court on 4 February 1988. The judge ruled that under the existing law he had no option but to find the party, UMNO, to be an unlawful society due to the existence of several unregistered branches—an illegal act under the Societies Act of 1966. The question of the Assembly itself being illegal therefore became academic.

&quot;&#x27;It is a very hard decision to declare UMNO unlawful,&#x27; said Justice Harun Hashim in his February 4 judgement. &#x27;But the law was made by our Parliament and certainly UMNO was aware [of the Societies Act] because they were in the majority [in Parliament] at all times [when the law was made].&#x27; Under the 1966 Act, amended five times over the years, and most recently by Mahathir&#x27;s government, each of the society&#x27;s branches has to register separately with the Registrar...&quot;

Then, Razaleigh set up a new party called Semangat 46, which claimed to be the successor to the old UMNO. UMNO Malaysia was supported mainly by members of the Team B faction from UMNO, but Mahathir was also invited to join the party leadership. However, the party collapsed after the Registrar of Societies refused to register it as a society without providing an explanation.

Mahathir showed no interest in reviving UMNO, and instead he set in motion the machinery to form a new surrogate party, and in due course, registered a party formally called Pertubuhan Kebangsaan Melayu Bersatu (Baru) or UMNO (New) a week after UMNO Malaysia&#x27;s registration was rejected. Eventually the suffix &quot;(New)&quot; was dropped, and UMNO (Baru) became both the &quot;de facto&quot; and &quot;de jure&quot; successor of original UMNO, dropping the &#x27;Baru&#x27; suffix with the old UMNO&#x27;s assets handed over. Most of its leaders, however, were selected from Team A of the old UMNO, with Team B ignored.

In 10th general election in 1999, rocked by the arrest and trial of former UMNO Deputy President Anwar Ibrahim and the subsequent formation of the Barisan Alternatif opposition coalition, UMNO&#x27;s share dipped to 54% of the vote and 102 out of 144 seats.

=== Post-Mahathir ===
After Mahathir stepped down as President of UMNO in 2003, he was replaced by his designated successor, Abdullah Ahmad Badawi, who became the 5th Prime Minister of Malaysia. Najib Razak, the son of Abdul Razak Hussein, took over as the Deputy Prime Minister of Malaysia.

In the 11th general election in 2004, Barisan Nasional, under Abdullah&#x27;s leadership, enjoyed a landslide victory. However, in the 12th general election in 2008, the coalition for the first time fell short of a two-thirds majority in the Parliament. UMNO Chief Ministers were ousted in the states of Selangor, Perak, Penang and Kedah. As a result, Abdullah resigned as President of UMNO and Prime Minister in 2009. He was succeeded by Najib.

Under Najib&#x27;s leadership, UMNO gained a total of 9 seats in the 13th general election and retook the state of Kedah. Mahathir&#x27;s son Mukhriz Mahathir became Kedah Menteri Besar. However, in 2015, the 1MDB scandal emerged, implicating Najib and leading to widespread controversy. The scandal severely affected UMNO&#x27;s reputation, causing internal divisions and public backlash.

In 2018, UMNO was required to hold an leadership election 19 April by the requirements of the Registry of Societies (RoS), to hold a leadership election within five years of the last leadership election, as the last leadership election was in 2013. In April, some UMNO members filed a suit to declare UMNO illegal but was dismissed by the High Court. UMNO announced in May that the RoS had in 2017 allowed UMNO to postpone the election until 19 April 2019.

On 9 May 2018, Mahathir and the Pakatan Harapan (PH) coalition won the 14th General Election ending UMNO&#x27;s 61 year long rule as part of the Alliance and later Barisan Nasional coalition. UMNO experienced a mass exodus of rank-and-file members, state chiefs, as well as Members of Parliament in favour of Mahathir&#x27;s BERSATU and regionalist parties such as Parti Warisan Sabah in the months after the election.

After the general election defeat, UMNO held the UMNO leadership election in June 2018 instead of 2019. Ahmad Zahid Hamidi won the election and became the 8th President of UMNO.

In September 2019, UMNO decided to form a pact with the Malaysian Islamic Party called Muafakat Nasional. Its main purpose is to unite the Malay Muslim communities for electoral purposes. There is however no formal agreement with the other parties of Barisan Nasional, although there are calls for Barisan Nasional to migrate to Muafakat Nasional. Barisan Nasional continued to function as a coalition of four parties comprising UMNO, MCA, MIC and PBRS, but aligned themselves with Perikatan Nasional (PN) to form a new government in March 2020 after the collapse of the Pakatan Harapan government.

In February 2020, in the leadup to the 2020–2022 Malaysian political crisis, UMNO leaders Ahmad Zahid Hamidi and Ismail Sabri Yaakob, along with BERSATU President Muhyiddin Yassin, PAS President Abdul Hadi Awang and PKR defector members led by Mohamed Azmin Ali, collectively convened at the Sheraton Petaling Jaya hotel to initiate a change in government, thus causing political instability by depriving the elected Pakatan Harapan government of a majority within the Members of the Dewan Rakyat in the 14th Malaysian Parliament. As a result, Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad (along with the Seventh Mahathir cabinet) tendered their resignation. In March 2020, after the Yang di-Pertuan Agong Al-Sultan Abdullah consulted all members of the Dewan Rakyat. Muhyiddin Yassin, with the support of UMNO and other non-PH &amp; Warisan parties, was deemed to have the greatest support within Parliament and was selected as the 8th Prime Minister of Malaysia.

In Muhyiddin&#x27;s cabinet, which formed on 10 March 2020, six UMNO MPs became Ministers &amp; eight UMNO MPs became Deputy Ministers, but excluded UMNO&#x27;s top 2 positions. President Ahmad Zahid had court cases and Deputy President Mohamad Hasan was not a member of Dewan Rakyat (but could have been appointed as a member of Dewan Negara).

In July 2021, further political instability ensued when UMNO, at the direction of its President Ahmad Zahid, withdrew support for the government led by Muhyiddin along with his cabinet. Zahid claimed that as Muhyiddin failed to spearhead economic recovery and effectively handle the Covid-19 pandemic, therefore Zahid claimed Muhyiddin failed to fulfil the conditions underlined by UMNO when it backed Muhyiddin to become prime minister in March 2020. In August 2021, after the Yang di-Pertuan Agong required all members of the Dewan Rakyat to submit a statutory declaration (SD) indicating their preference of Prime Minister. Vice President Ismail Sabri Yaakob possessed the greatest support within Parliament (with 114 affirmative SDs out of a possible 222) and was selected as the 9th Prime Minister of Malaysia, thus created history by the being the only non-coalition party leader to be elected as Prime Minister. Additionally, history was also made as three Prime Ministers took office in a single parliamentary term.

In the 2022 election, UMNO, as a part of BN, faced the worst-ever result in Malaysian history, with only winning 26 out of 222 seats. Several key figures including Tengku Razaleigh Hamzah, Mahdzir Khalid, Azeez Rahim, Tengku Zafrul Aziz, Khairy Jamaluddin, lost to either PN or PH candidates. UMNO was also defeated at several state elections held in Pahang and Perak, and lost all seats in Perlis. President Ahmad Zahid was re-elected with a slim majority.

== Ideology ==
UMNO overtly represents the Malays of Malaysia, although any Bumiputera (indigenous Malaysian, a category which includes people such as the non-Malay and usually non-Muslim Kadazan, Iban, Dayak, etc. of East Malaysia) may join the party. The party propagates Ketuanan Melayu, the concept that the Bumiputera, including ethnic Malays, enjoy a special status within the country by virtue of their earlier settlement of the lands that now form Malaysia and as a result of the recognition of Malays in Article 153 of the Constitution of Malaysia.

=== &quot;Bumiputera&quot; policies ===
In 2018, Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad announced the cabinet&#x27;s decision for the government to &quot;ratify all remaining core UN instruments related to the protection of human rights&quot;, including International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (ICERD) and other five previously unratified conventions at a United Nations General Assembly, UMNO, PAS along with various non-governmental organisations, staged an anti-ICERD rally that was held at the Dataran Merdeka, Kuala Lumpur, to protest against the ratifications of the relevant international conventions, due to their perception that these human rights instruments contravene with the special position of the Malays, Bumiputera and Islam within the country; all of which are enshrined within the Malaysian Constitution.

On 23 November 2018, the Prime Minister&#x27;s Office announced they would not ratify the convention and would continue defending the Federal Constitution, which they said represents a social contract that was agreed upon by all races during the formation of the country.

In 2021, a new equity policy for &quot;Bumiputeras&quot; in the Twelfth Malaysia Plan (12MP) attracted controversy which were announced by Ismail Sabri Yaakob. It is said to ensure sustainable equity holdings by Bumiputeras, an equity safety net would be launched to guarantee that the sale of shares or Bumiputera-owned firms would only be sold solely to Bumiputera-owned companies, consortium or individuals. Syed Saddiq said that the new rulings were unfair as they would be tantamount to taking equity from the non-Bumiputeras and giving them to Bumiputeras. Former Health Minister, Dzulkefly Ahmad had also described the policy as &quot;suicidal&quot; and claimed that the new policy would only kill the Bumiputera companies economically if that is their intention. He also said that based on the feedback from Malay businessmen, most were against the idea of the new Bumiputera-only policy being implemented. Ismail Sabri announced it after revealing that the government’s target to raise Bumiputera equity ownership to 30% had yet to be achieved. He also announced funding to improve Bumiputera businesses’ sustainability to hit 15% contribution in gross domestic product (GDP) by Bumiputera micro, small and medium enterprises by 2025.

<text>A random act of kindness is a nonpremeditated, inconsistent action designed to offer kindness towards the outside world. The phrase &quot;random kindness and senseless acts of beauty&quot; was written by Anne Herbert on a placemat in Sausalito, California in 1982. It was based on the phrase &quot;random acts of violence and senseless acts of cruelty&quot;. Herbert&#x27;s book &quot;Random Kindness and Senseless Acts of Beauty&quot; was published in February 1993 speaking about true stories of acts of kindness. 

The phrase is commonly expressed as the suggestion to &quot;Practice random acts of kindness.&quot; There are groups around the world who are sharing acts of spontaneous kindness.

==Examples of events or groups that have received publicity==
* On 14 November 2012 an NYPD officer, Lawrence DePrimo, was photographed giving socks and a pair of boots he had purchased for a bare-footed homeless man. The photograph later went viral.
* Started in February 2014, the Feed the Deed campaign has inspired over 10,000 random acts of kindness around the world.
* A Chicago man, Ryan Garcia, gained a significant following after doing a different random act of kindness each day of the year in 2012. His 366 random acts have spun off into State of Kind, a mission to do an act of kindness in all 50 states in order to raise awareness for 22q11.2 deletion syndrome.

==In film and literature==
* 1993: &quot;Random Kindness and Senseless Acts of Beauty&quot;, a 1993 children&#x27;s book published by Volcano Press and authored by Anne Herbert, Margaret Paloma Pavel, and illustrated by Mayumi Oda, with a 20th-anniversary edition published in 2014 with a foreword by Archbishop Desmond Tutu, and a 30th-anniversary edition published in 2024, both by New Village Press. 
*1993: A wordplay of the phrase is evident in the dystopian novel Random Acts of Senseless Violence, by Jack Womack. The novel depicts a society in which the opposite phenomenon occurs, as the title suggests.
* In 1984, Dobbs Ferry Police officer Robert Cunningham split a winning lottery ticket with Sal&#x27;s Pizzeria waitress Phyllis Penzo, netting Phyllis approx. $3M. A 1994 romantic comedy, &quot;It Could Happen to You&quot; starring Nicolas Cage and Bridget Fonda was made based on this event but moving the movie&#x27;s location to New York City. 
* 2002: &quot;Join Me&quot; is a book written by humorist Danny Wallace; in which he tells of the cult he started by accident, the group&#x27;s purpose is to encourage members (called Joinees and collectively known as the KarmaArmy) to perform random acts of kindness, particularly on Fridays which are termed &quot;Good Fridays&quot;. Wallace has also published a book called &quot;Random Acts of Kindness: 365 Ways to Make the World a Nicer Place&quot;.
* 2007: The film &quot;Evan Almighty&quot; ends with God telling the main character, Evan, that the way to change the world is by doing one Act of Random Kindness (&quot;ARK&quot;) at a time.
* 2009: Karen McCombie&#x27;s book &quot;The Seventeen Secrets of the Karma Club&quot; revolves around two girls who (inspired by their favourite film &quot;Amélie&quot;) start up their &#x27;Karma Club&#x27;, the intention of which, is to do random acts of kindness anonymously.
* An Australian TV show named &quot;Random Acts of Kindness&quot;, on Channel 9, shows hosts Karl Stefanovic, Scott Cam and Simmone Jade Mackinnon giving gifts to people they identify as heroes.
* 2020: The Rotary Club of Makati Central of District 3830 launches a social media challenge for members of Rotaract to join the &quot;Random Act of Kindness Award&quot; or RAK Award, for short.

<text>Lydia Maria Child ( Francis; February 11, 1802October 20, 1880) was an American abolitionist, women&#x27;s rights activist, Native American rights activist, novelist, journalist, and opponent of American expansionism. Her journals, both fiction and domestic manuals, reached wide audiences from the 1820s through the 1850s. At times she shocked her audience as she tried to take on issues of both male dominance and white supremacy in some of her stories.

Despite these challenges, Child may be most remembered for her poem &quot;Over the River and Through the Wood.&quot; Her grandparents&#x27; house, which she wrote about visiting, was restored by Tufts University in 1976 and stands near the Mystic River on South Street, in Medford, Massachusetts.

==Early life and education==
Lydia Maria Francis was born in Medford, Massachusetts, on February 11, 1802, to Susannah (née Rand) and Convers Francis. She went by her middle name, and pronounced it Ma-RYE-a. Her older brother, Convers Francis, was educated at Harvard College and Seminary, and became a Unitarian minister. Child received her education at a local dame school and later at a women&#x27;s seminary. Upon the death of her mother, she went to live with her older sister in Maine, where she studied to be a teacher. During this time, her brother Convers, by then a Unitarian minister, saw to his younger sister&#x27;s education in literary masters such as Homer and Milton. In her early 20s, Francis lived with her brother and met many of the top writers and thinkers of the day through him. She also converted to Unitarianism.

Francis chanced to read an article in the &quot;North American Review&quot; discussing the field offered to the novelist by early New England history. Although she had never thought of becoming an author, she immediately wrote the first chapter of her novel &quot;Hobomok&quot;. Encouraged by her brother&#x27;s commendation, she finished it in six weeks and had it published. From this time until her death, she wrote continually.

Francis taught for one year in a seminary in Medford, and in 1824 started a private school in Watertown, Massachusetts. In 1826, she founded the &quot;Juvenile Miscellany&quot;, the first monthly periodical for children published in the United States, and supervised its publication for eight years. After publishing other works voicing her opposition to slavery, much of her audience turned against her, especially in the South. &quot;The&quot; &quot;Juvenile Miscellany&quot; closed down after book sales and subscriptions dropped.

In 1828, she married David Lee Child and moved to Boston.

==Career==
===Early writings===
Following the success of &quot;Hobomok&quot;, Child wrote several novels, poetry, and an instruction manual for mothers, &quot;The Mothers Book&quot;; but her most successful work was &quot;The Frugal Housewife. Dedicated to those who are not ashamed of Economy&quot;. This book contained mostly recipes, but also contained this advice for young housewives, &quot;If you are about to furnish a house, do not spend all your money... Begin humbly.&quot; First published in 1829, the book was expanded and went through 33 printings in 25 years. Child wrote that her book had been &quot;written for the poor ... those who can afford to be will find the best of information in the &quot;Seventy-five Receipts&quot;&quot; by Eliza Leslie.

Child changed the title to &quot;The American Frugal Housewife&quot; in 1832 to end the confusion with the British author Susannah Carter&#x27;s &quot;The Frugal Housewife&quot; first published in 1765, and then printed in America from 1772. Child wrote that Carter&#x27;s book was not suited &quot;to the wants of this country&quot;. To add further confusion, from 1832 to 1834 Child&#x27;s version was printed in London and Glasgow. Around this time she also published in &quot;The Token&quot; annual gift book.

===Abolitionism and women&#x27;s rights movements===

In 1831, William Lloyd Garrison began publication of his influential abolitionist newspaper,&quot; The Liberator.&quot; Lydia Child and her husband read it from the beginning and began to identify themselves with the anti-slavery cause. Personal contact with Garrison was another factor. Child was a women&#x27;s rights activist, but did not believe significant progress for women could be made until after the abolition of slavery. She believed that white women and enslaved people were similar in that white men held both groups in subjugation and treated them as property, instead of individual human beings. As she worked towards equality for women, Child publicly said that she did not care for all-female communities. She believed that women would be able to achieve more by working alongside men. Child, along with many other female abolitionists, began campaigning for equal female membership and participation in the American Anti-Slavery Society, provoking a controversy that later split the movement.
In 1833, she published her book &quot;An Appeal in Favor of that Class of Americans Called Africans&quot;. It argued, as did Garrison, in favor of the immediate emancipation of the enslaved people without compensation to their legal owners. She is sometimes said to have been the first white woman to have written a book in support of this policy. She &quot;surveyed slavery from a variety of angles—historical, political, economic, legal, and moral&quot; to show that &quot;emancipation was practicable and that Africans were intellectually equal to Europeans.&quot; In this book, she wrote that &quot;the intellectual inferiority of the negroes is a common, though most absurd apology, for personal prejudice.&quot; The book was the first anti-slavery work printed in America in book form. She followed it with several smaller works on the same subject. Her &quot;Appeal&quot; attracted much attention, and William Ellery Channing, who attributed to it part of his interest in the slavery question, walked from Boston to Roxbury to thank Child for the book. She had to endure social ostracism, but from this time was considered a conspicuous champion of anti-slavery.
Child, a strong supporter and organizer in anti-slavery societies, helped with fundraising efforts to finance the first anti-slavery fair, which abolitionists held in Boston in 1834. It was both an educational and a major fundraising event, and was held annually for decades, organized under Maria Weston Chapman. In 1839, Child was elected to the executive committee of the American Anti-Slavery Society (AASS), and became editor of the society&#x27;s &quot;National Anti-Slavery Standard&quot; in 1840. While she was editor of the &quot;National Anti-Slavery Standard&quot;, Child wrote a weekly column for the paper called &quot;Letters from New-York&quot;, which she later compiled and published in book form. Child&#x27;s management as editor and the popularity of her &quot;Letters from New-York&quot; column both helped to establish the &quot;National Anti-Slavery Standard&quot; as one of the most popular abolitionist newspapers in the US. She edited the &quot;Standard&quot; until 1843, when her husband took her place as editor-in-chief. She acted as his assistant until May 1844. During their stay in New York, the Childs were close friends of Isaac T. Hopper, a Quaker abolitionist and prison reformer. After leaving New York, the Childs settled in Wayland, Massachusetts, where they spent the rest of their lives. Here, they provided shelter for runaway slaves trying to escape the Fugitive Slave Law. Child also served as a member of the executive board of the American Anti-Slavery Society during the 1840s and 1850s, alongside Lucretia Mott and Maria Weston Chapman.

During this period, she also wrote short stories, exploring, through fiction, the complex issues of slavery. Examples include &quot;The Quadroons&quot; (1842) and &quot;Slavery&#x27;s Pleasant Homes: A Faithful Sketch&quot; (1843). She wrote anti-slavery fiction to reach people beyond what she could do in tracts. She also used it to address issues of sexual exploitation, which affected both the enslaved persons and the slaveholder family. In both cases she found women suffered from the power of men. The more closely Child addressed some of the abuses, the more negative the reaction she received from her readers. She published an anti-slavery tract, &quot;The Duty of Disobedience to the Fugitive Slave Act: An Appeal to the Legislators of Massachusetts&quot;, in 1860.

Eventually Child left the &quot;National Anti-Slavery Standard&quot;, because she refused to promote violence as an acceptable weapon for battling slavery. 

She did continue to write for many newspapers and periodicals during the 1840s, and she promoted greater equality for women. However, because of her negative experience with the AASS, she never worked again in organized movements or societies for women&#x27;s rights or suffrage. In 1844, Child published the poem &quot;The New-England Boy&#x27;s Song about Thanksgiving Day&quot; in &quot;Flowers for Children&quot;, Volume 2, that became famous as the song &quot;Over the River and Through the Wood&quot;.

In the 1850s, Child responded to the near-fatal beating on the Senate floor of her good friend Charles Sumner, an abolitionist Senator from Massachusetts, by a South Carolina congressman, by writing her poem entitled &quot;The Kansas Emigrants&quot;. The outbreak of violence in Kansas between anti- and pro-slavery settlers, prior to voting on whether the territory should be admitted as a free or slave state, resulted in Child changing her opinion about the use of violence. Along with Angelina Grimké Weld, another proponent for peace, she acknowledged the need for the use of violence to protect anti-slavery emigrants in Kansas. Child also sympathized with the radical abolitionist John Brown. While she did not condone his violence, she deeply admired his courage and conviction in the raid on Harper&#x27;s Ferry. She wrote to Virginia Governor Henry A. Wise asking for permission to travel to Charles Town to nurse Brown, but although Wise had no objection, Brown did not accept her offer.

In 1860, Child was invited to write a preface to Harriet Jacobs&#x27;s slave narrative, &quot;Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl.&quot; She met Jacobs and agreed not only to write the preface but also became the editor of the book.

===Native American rights work===

Child published her first novel, the historical romance &quot;Hobomok, A Tale of Early Times&quot;, anonymously under the gender-neutral pseudonym &quot;an American&quot;. The plot centers on the interracial marriage between a white woman and a Native American man, who have a son together. The heroine later remarries, reintegrating herself and her child into Puritan society. The issue of miscegenation caused a scandal in the literary community and the book was not a critical success.

During the 1860s, Child wrote pamphlets on Native American rights. The most prominent, &quot;An Appeal for the Indians&quot; (1868), called upon government officials, as well as religious leaders, to bring justice to American Indians. Her presentation sparked Peter Cooper&#x27;s interest in Indian issues. It contributed to the founding of the U.S. Board of Indian Commissioners and the subsequent Peace Policy in the administration of Ulysses S. Grant.

===Freethought beliefs===
Born to a strict Calvinist father, Child slept with a bible under her pillow when she was young. However, although she joined the Unitarians in 1820, as an adult she was not active in that, or any other, church. In 1855 she published the 3-volume &quot;The Progress of Religious Ideas Through Successive Ages&quot;, within which she rejected traditional theology, dogma, and doctrines and repudiated the concept of revelation and creeds as the basis for moral action, arguing instead &quot;It is impossible to exaggerate the evil work that theology has done in the world&quot; and, in commenting on the efforts of theologians, &quot;What a blooming paradise would the whole earth be if the same amount of intellect, labor, and zeal had been expended on science, agriculture, and the arts!&quot;

Child&#x27;s &quot;An Appeal in Favor of that Class of Americans Called Africans&quot; pushed for emancipation by highlighting the life of an enslaved Muslim man named Ben Solomon. In underscoring Ben Solomon&#x27;s excellence and intelligence as an Arabic teacher and a man of Muslim faith, Child not only drove racial acceptance but religious acceptance as well.

==Personal life==
Lydia Francis taught school until 1828, when she married Boston lawyer David Lee Child. His political activism and involvement in reform introduced her to the social reforms of Indian rights and Garrisonian abolitionism. She was a long-time friend of activist Margaret Fuller and frequent participant in Fuller&#x27;s &quot;conversations&quot; held at Elizabeth Palmer Peabody&#x27;s North Street bookstore in Boston.

Child died in Wayland, Massachusetts, aged 78, on October 20, 1880, at her home at 91 Old Sudbury Road. She was buried at North Cemetery in Wayland. At her funeral, abolitionist Wendell Phillips shared the opinion of many within the abolition movement who knew her, &quot;We felt that neither fame, nor gain, nor danger, nor calumny had any weight with her.&quot;

<text>Harriet Jacobs (1813 or 1815 – March 7, 1897) was an African-American abolitionist and writer whose autobiography, &quot;Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl&quot;, published in 1861 under the pseudonym Linda Brent, is now considered an &quot;American classic&quot;.

Born into slavery in Edenton, North Carolina, she was sexually harassed by her enslaver. When he threatened to sell her children if she did not submit to his desire, she hid in a tiny crawl space under the roof of her grandmother&#x27;s house, so low she could not stand up in it. After staying there for seven years, she finally managed to escape to the free North, where she was reunited with her children Joseph and Louisa Matilda and her brother John S. Jacobs. She found work as a nanny and got into contact with abolitionist and feminist reformers. Even in New York City, her freedom was in danger until her employer was able to pay off her legal owner.

During and immediately after the American Civil War, she travelled to Union-occupied parts of the Confederate South together with her daughter, organizing help and founding two schools for fugitive and freed slaves.

==Biography==
=== Family and name ===

Harriet Jacobs was born in 1813 in Edenton, North Carolina, to Delilah Horniblow, enslaved by the Horniblow family who owned a local tavern. Under the principle of &quot;partus sequitur ventrem&quot;, both Harriet and her brother John were enslaved at birth by the tavern keeper&#x27;s family, as a mother&#x27;s status was passed to her children. Still, according to the same principle, mother and children should have been free, because Molly Horniblow, Delilah&#x27;s mother, had been freed by her white father, who also was her owner. But she had been kidnapped, and had no chance for legal protection because of her dark skin. Harriet and John&#x27;s father was Elijah Knox, also enslaved, but enjoying some privileges due to his skill as an expert carpenter. He died in 1826.

While Harriet&#x27;s mother and grandmother were known by their owner&#x27;s family name of Horniblow, Harriet used the opportunity of the baptism of her children to register Jacobs as their family name. She and her brother John also used that name after having escaped from slavery. The baptism was conducted without the knowledge of Harriet&#x27;s master, Norcom. Harriet was convinced that her father should have been called Jacobs because his father was Henry Jacobs, a free white man. After Harriet&#x27;s mother died, her father married a free African American. The only child from that marriage, Harriet&#x27;s half brother, was called Elijah after his father and always used Knox as his family name, which was the name of his father&#x27;s enslaver.

=== Early life in slavery ===

When Jacobs was six years old, her mother died. She then lived with her owner, a daughter of the deceased tavern keeper, who taught her not only to sew, but also to read and write. Very few slaves were literate, although it was only in 1830 that North Carolina explicitly outlawed teaching slaves to read or write. Although Harriet&#x27;s brother John succeeded in teaching himself to read, he still was not able to write when he escaped from slavery as a young adult.

In 1825, the owner of Harriet and John Jacobs died. She willed Harriet to her three-year-old niece Mary Matilda Norcom. Mary Matilda&#x27;s father, the physician Dr. James Norcom (son-in-law of the deceased tavern keeper), became her &quot;de facto&quot; master. Most of the property, including her brother John, was inherited by the tavern keeper&#x27;s widow. Dr. Norcom hired John, and the Jacobs siblings lived together in his household.
Following the death of the widow, her slaves were sold at the New Year&#x27;s Day auction, 1828. Among them were Harriet&#x27;s brother John, her grandmother Molly Horniblow and Molly&#x27;s son Mark. Being sold at public auction was a traumatic experience for twelve-year old John. Friends of hers bought Molly Horniblow and Mark with money Molly had been working hard to save over the many years of her servitude at the tavern. Afterwards Molly Horniblow was set free, and her own son Mark became her slave. Because of legal restrictions on manumission, Mark had to remain his mother&#x27;s slave until in 1847 or 1848 she finally succeeded in freeing him. John Jacobs was bought by Dr. Norcom, thus he and his sister stayed together.

The same year, 1828, Molly Horniblow&#x27;s youngest son, Joseph, tried to escape. He was caught, paraded in chains through Edenton, put into jail, and finally sold to New Orleans. The family later learned that he escaped again and reached New York. After that he was lost to the family. The Jacobs siblings, who, even as children, were talking about escaping to freedom, saw him as a hero. Both of them would later name their sons for him.
=== Coping with sexual harassment ===
Norcom soon started harassing Jacobs sexually, causing the jealousy of his wife. When Jacobs fell in love with a free black man who wanted to buy her freedom and marry her, Norcom intervened and forbade her to continue with the relationship. Hoping for protection from Norcom&#x27;s harassment, Jacobs started a relationship with Samuel Sawyer, a white lawyer and member of North Carolina&#x27;s white elite, who would some years later be elected to the House of Representatives. Sawyer became the father of Jacobs&#x27;s only children, Joseph (born 1829/30) and Louisa Matilda (born 1832/33). When she learned of Jacobs&#x27;s pregnancy, Mrs. Norcom forbade her to return to her house, which enabled Jacobs to live with her grandmother. Still, Norcom continued his harassment during his numerous visits there; the distance &quot;as the crow flies&quot; between the two houses was only .

=== Seven years concealed ===
In April 1835, Norcom finally moved Jacobs from her grandmother&#x27;s to the plantation of his son, some away. He also threatened to expose her children to the hard life of the plantation slaves and to sell them, separately and without the mother, after some time. In June 1835, Harriet Jacobs decided to escape. A white woman, who was a slaveholder herself, hid her at great personal risk in her house. After a short time, Jacobs had to hide in a swamp near the town, and at last she found refuge in a &quot;tiny crawlspace&quot; under the roof of her grandmother&#x27;s house. The &quot;garret&quot; was only by and at its highest point. The impossibility of bodily exercise caused health problems which she still felt while writing her autobiography many years later. She bored a series of small holes into the wall, thus creating an opening approximately an inch square that allowed fresh air and some light to enter and that allowed her to see out. The light was barely sufficient to sew and to read the Bible and newspapers.
Norcom reacted by selling Jacobs&#x27;s children and her brother John to a slave trader demanding that they should be sold in a different state, thus expecting to separate them forever from their mother and sister. However, the trader was secretly in league with Sawyer, to whom he sold all three of them, thus frustrating Norcom&#x27;s plan for revenge. In her autobiography, Jacobs accuses Sawyer of not having kept his promise to legally manumit their children. Still, Sawyer allowed his enslaved children to live with their great-grandmother Molly Horniblow. After Sawyer married in 1838, Jacobs asked her grandmother to remind him of his promise. He asked and obtained Jacobs&#x27;s approval to send their daughter to live with his cousin in Brooklyn, New York, where slavery had already been abolished. He also suggested sending their son to the Free States. While locked in her cell, Jacobs could often observe her unsuspecting children.

=== Escape and freedom ===
In 1842, Jacobs finally got a chance to escape by boat to Philadelphia, where she was aided by anti-slavery activists of the Philadelphia Vigilant Committee. After a short stay, she continued to New York City. Although she had no references, Mary Stace Willis, the wife of the then extremely popular author Nathaniel Parker Willis, accepted to hire Jacobs as the nanny of her baby daughter Imogen. The two women agreed on a trial period of one week, not suspecting that the relationship between the two families would last into the next generation, until the death of Louisa Matilda Jacobs at the home of Edith Willis Grinnell, the daughter of Nathaniel Willis and his second wife, in 1917.
In 1843 Jacobs heard that Norcom was on his way to New York to force her back into slavery, which was legal for him to do everywhere inside the United States. She asked Mary Willis for a leave of two weeks and went to her brother John in Boston. John Jacobs, in his capacity as personal servant, had accompanied his owner Sawyer on his marriage trip through the North in 1838. He had gained his freedom by leaving his master in New York. After that he had gone whaling and had been absent for more than three years. From Boston, Harriet Jacobs wrote to her grandmother asking her to send Joseph there, so that he could live there with his uncle John. After Joseph&#x27;s arrival, she returned to her work as Imogen Willis&#x27;s nanny.
Her work with the Willis family came to an abrupt end in October 1843, when Jacobs learned that her whereabouts had been betrayed to Norcom. Again, she had to flee to Boston, where the strength of the abolitionist movement guaranteed a certain level of security. Moving to Boston also gave her the opportunity to take her daughter Louisa Matilda from the house of Sawyer&#x27;s cousin in Brooklyn, where she had been treated not much better than a slave.

In Boston Jacobs took on odd jobs. Her stay there was interrupted by the death of Mary Stace Willis in March 1845. Nathaniel Willis took his daughter Imogen on a ten-month visit to the family of his deceased wife in England. For the journey, Jacobs resumed her job as nanny. For several months, she stayed together with Imogen in the vicarage at Steventon, the home of Mary Stace Willis&#x27;s sister and her husband Reverend William Vincent, while Willis went to London and to the Continent. In her autobiography, she reflects on the experiences made during the journey: She did not notice any sign of racism, which often embittered her life in the US. In consequence of this, she gained a new access to her Christian faith. At home, Christian ministers treating blacks with contempt or even buying and selling slaves had been an obstacle to her spiritual life.

=== The autobiography ===
==== Background: Abolitionism and early feminism ====
John S. Jacobs got more and more involved with abolitionism, i. e. the anti-slavery movement led by William Lloyd Garrison. He undertook several lecture tours, either alone or with fellow abolitionists, among them Frederick Douglass, three years his junior. In 1849, John S. Jacobs took responsibility for the &quot;Anti-Slavery Office and Reading Room&quot; in Rochester, New York. His sister Harriet supported him, having been relieved of the daily care for her children (Joseph had left the Boston print shop where his mother had apprenticed him after suffering from racist abuse and had gone on a whaling voyage while his mother had been in England, and Louisa had been sent to a boarding school).

The former &quot;slave girl&quot; who had never been to school, and whose life had mostly been confined by the struggle for her own survival in dignity and that of her children, now found herself in circles that were about to change America through their - by the standards of the time - radical set of ideas. The &quot;Reading Room&quot; was in the same building as the newspaper &quot;The North Star&quot;, run by Frederick Douglass, who today is considered the most influential African American of his century. Jacobs lived at the house of the white couple Amy and Isaac Post. Douglass and the Posts were staunch enemies of slavery and racism, and supporters of women&#x27;s suffrage. The year before, Douglass and Amy Post had attended the Seneca Falls Convention, the world&#x27;s first convention on women&#x27;s rights, and had signed the Declaration of Sentiments, which demanded equal rights for women.

==== Obtaining legal freedom ====

In 1850, Jacobs paid a visit to Nathaniel Parker Willis in New York, wanting to see the now eight-years old Imogen again. Willis&#x27;s second wife, Cornelia Grinnell Willis, who had not recovered well after the birth of her second child, prevailed upon Jacobs once again to become the nanny of the Willis children. Knowing that this involved a considerable risk for Jacobs, especially since the Fugitive Slave Law of 1850 had made it much easier for slaveholders to reclaim their fugitive &quot;chattels&quot;, she gave her word to John S. Jacobs that she would not let his sister fall into the hands of her persecutors.

In the spring of 1851, Jacobs was again informed that she was in danger of being recaptured. Cornelia Willis sent Jacobs together with her (Willis&#x27;s) one-year-old daughter Lilian to Massachusetts which was comparatively safe. Jacobs, in whose autobiography the constant danger for herself and other enslaved mothers of being separated from their children is an important theme, spoke to her employer of the sacrifice that letting go of her baby daughter meant to her. Cornelia Willis answered by explaining that the slave catchers would have to return the baby to the mother, if Jacobs should be caught. She would then try to rescue Jacobs.

In February 1852, Jacobs read in the newspaper that her legal owner, the daughter of the recently deceased Norcom, had arrived at a New York Hotel together with her husband, obviously intending to re-claim their fugitive slave. Again, Cornelia Willis sent Jacobs to Massachusetts together with Lilian. Some days later, she wrote a letter to Jacobs informing her of her intention to buy Jacobs&#x27;s freedom. Jacobs replied that she preferred to join her brother who had gone to California. Regardless, Cornelia Willis bought her freedom for $300. In her autobiography, Jacobs describes her mixed feelings: Bitterness at the thought that &quot;a human being [was] &quot;sold&quot; in the free city of New York&quot;, happiness at the thought that her freedom was secured, and &quot;love&quot; and &quot;gratitude&quot; for Cornelia Willis.

==== Obstacles: Trauma and shame ====

When Jacobs came to know the Posts in Rochester, they were the first white people she met since her return from England, who did not look down on her color. Soon, she developed enough trust in Amy Post to be able to tell her her story which she had kept secret for so long. Post later described how difficult it was for Jacobs to tell of her traumatic experiences: &quot;Though impelled by a natural craving for human sympathy, she passed through a baptism of suffering, even in recounting her trials to me. ... The burden of these memories lay heavily on her spirit&quot;.

In late 1852 or early 1853, Amy Post suggested that Jacobs should write her life story. Jacobs&#x27;s brother had for some time been urging her to do so, and she felt a moral obligation to tell her story to help build public support for the antislavery cause and thus save others from suffering a similar fate.

Still, Jacobs had acted against moral ideas commonly shared in her time, including by herself, by consenting to a sexual relationship with Sawyer. The shame caused by this memory and the resulting fear of having to tell her story had been the reason for her initially avoiding contact with the abolitionist movement her brother John had joined in the 1840s. Finally, Jacobs overcame her trauma and feeling of shame, and she consented to publish her story. Her reply to Post describing her internal struggle has survived.

==== Writing of the manuscript ====
At first, Jacobs did not feel that she was up to writing a book. She wrote a short outline of her story and asked Amy Post to send it to Harriet Beecher Stowe, proposing to tell her story to Stowe so that Stowe could transform it into a book. Before Stowe&#x27;s answer arrived, Jacobs read in the papers that the famous author, whose novel &quot;Uncle Tom&#x27;s Cabin&quot;, published in 1852, had become an instant bestseller, was going to England. Jacobs then asked Cornelia Willis to propose to Stowe that Jacobs&#x27;s daughter Louisa accompany her to England and tell the story during the journey. In reply, Stowe forwarded the story outline to Willis and declined to let Louisa join her, citing the possibility of Louisa being spoiled by too much sympathy shown to her in England. Jacobs felt betrayed because her employer thus came to know about the parentage of her children, which was the cause for Jacobs feeling ashamed. In a letter to Post, she analyzed the racist thinking behind Stowe&#x27;s remark on Louisa with bitter irony: &quot;what a pity we poor blacks can[&#x27;]t have the firmness and stability of character that you white people have.&quot; In consequence, Jacobs gave up the idea of enlisting Stowe&#x27;s help.
In June 1853, Jacobs chanced to read a defense of slavery entitled &quot;The Women of England vs. the Women of America&quot; in an old newspaper. Written by Julia Tyler, wife of former president John Tyler, the text claimed that the household slaves were &quot;well clothed and happy&quot;. Jacobs spent the whole night writing a reply, which she sent to the &quot;New York Tribune&quot;. Her letter, signed &quot;A Fugitive Slave&quot;, published on June 21, was her first text to be printed. Her biographer, Jean Fagan Yellin, comments, &quot;When the letter was printed ..., an author was born.&quot;

In October 1853, she wrote to Amy Post that she had decided to become the author of her own story. In the same letter, only a few lines earlier, she had informed Post of her grandmother&#x27;s death. Yellin concludes that the &quot;death of her revered grandmother&quot; made it possible for Jacobs to &quot;reveal her troubled sexual history&quot; which she could never have done &quot;while her proud, judgmental grandmother lived.&quot;

While using the little spare time a children&#x27;s nurse had to write her story, Jacobs lived with the Willis family at Idlewild, their new country residence. With N.P.Willis being largely forgotten today, Yellin comments on the irony of the situation: &quot;Idlewild had been conceived as a famous writer&#x27;s retreat, but its owner never imagined that it was his children&#x27;s nurse who would create an American classic there&quot;.

Louisa copied the manuscript, standardizing orthography and punctuation. Yellin observes that both style and content are &quot;completely consistent&quot; with the rest of Jacobs&#x27;s writing and states, &quot;there is no evidence to suggest that Louisa Matilda had any significant impact on either the subject matter or the style of the book.&quot;

When, by mid-1857, her work was finally nearing completion, she asked Amy Post for a preface. Even in this letter she mentions the shame that made writing her story difficult for herself: &quot;as much pleasure as it would afford me and as great an honor as I would deem it to have your name associated with my Book –Yet believe me dear friend[,] there are many painful things in it – that make me shrink from asking the sacrifice from one so good and pure as your self–.&quot;

==== Searching for a publisher ====

In May 1858, Harriet Jacobs sailed to England, hoping to find a publisher there. She carried good letters of introduction, but was not able to get her manuscript into print. The reasons for her failure are not clear. Yellin supposes that her contacts among the British abolitionists feared that the story of her liaison with Sawyer would be too much for Victorian Britain&#x27;s prudery. Disheartened, Jacobs returned to her work at Idlewild and made no further efforts to publish her book until the fall of 1859.

On October 16, 1859, the anti-slavery activist John Brown tried to incite a slave rebellion at Harper&#x27;s Ferry. Brown, who was executed in December, was considered a martyr and hero by many abolitionists, among them Harriet Jacobs, who added a tribute to Brown as the final chapter to her manuscript. She then sent the manuscript to publishers Phillips and Samson in Boston. They were ready to publish it under the condition that either Nathaniel Parker Willis or Harriet Beecher Stowe would supply a preface. Jacobs was unwilling to ask Willis, who held pro-slavery views, but she asked Stowe, who declined. Soon after, the publishers failed, thus frustrating Jacobs&#x27;s second attempt to get her story printed.

==== Lydia Maria Child as the book&#x27;s editor ====
Jacobs now contacted Thayer and Eldridge, who had recently published a sympathizing biography of John Brown. Thayer and Eldridge demanded a preface by Lydia Maria Child. Jacobs confessed to Amy Post, that after suffering another rejection from Stowe, she could hardly bring herself to asking another famous writer, but she &quot;resolved to make my last effort&quot;.

Jacobs met Child in Boston, and Child not only agreed to write a preface, but also to become the editor of the book. Child then re-arranged the material according to a more chronological order. She also suggested dropping the final chapter on Brown and adding more information on the anti-black violence which occurred in Edenton after Nat Turner&#x27;s 1831 rebellion. She kept contact with Jacobs via mail, but the two women failed to meet a second time during the editing process, because with Cornelia Willis passing through a dangerous pregnancy and premature birth Jacobs was not able to leave Idlewild.

After the book had been stereotyped, Thayer and Eldridge, too, failed. Jacobs succeeded in buying the stereotype plates and to get the book printed and bound.

In January 1861, nearly four years after she had finished the manuscript, Jacobs&#x27;s &quot;Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl&quot; finally appeared before the public. The next month, an abridged and censored version of her brother John S. Jacob&#x27;s own memoir, entitled &quot;A True Tale of Slavery&quot;, was published in London (in 1855 the original version had been published in full by a progressive newspaper in Sydney, Australia, as &quot;The United States Governed by Six Hundred Thousand Despots: A True Story of Slavery&quot;). Both siblings relate in their respective narratives their own experiences, experiences made together, and episodes in the life of the other sibling.

In her book, Harriet Jacobs does not mention the town or even the state, where she was held as a slave, and changes all personal names, given names as well as family names, with the only exception of the Post couple, whose names are given correctly. However, John Jacobs (called &quot;William&quot; in his sister&#x27;s book) mentions Edenton as his birthplace and uses the correct given names, but abbreviates most family names. So Dr. Norcom is &quot;Dr. Flint&quot; in Harriet&#x27;s book, but &quot;Dr. N-&quot; in John&#x27;s. An author&#x27;s name is not given on the title page, but the &quot;Preface by the author&quot; is signed &quot;Linda Brent&quot; and the narrator is called by that name throughout the story.

==== Reception of the book ====
The book was promoted via the abolitionist networks and was well received by the critics. Jacobs arranged for a publication in Great Britain, which was published in the first months of 1862, soon followed by a pirated edition.

The publication did not cause contempt as Jacobs had feared. On the contrary, Jacobs gained respect. Although she had used a pseudonym, in abolitionist circles she was regularly introduced with words like &quot;Mrs. Jacobs, the author of Linda&quot;, thereby conceding her the honorific &quot;Mrs.&quot; which normally was reserved for married women. The &quot;London Daily News&quot; wrote in 1862, that Linda Brent was a true &quot;heroine&quot;, giving an example &quot;of endurance and persistency in the struggle for liberty&quot; and &quot;moral rectitude&quot;.

=== Civil War and Reconstruction ===
==== Relief work and politics ====
After the election of president Lincoln in November 1860, the slavery question caused first the secession of most slave states and then the Civil War. Thousands of African Americans, having escaped from slavery in the South, gathered just north of the front. Since Lincoln&#x27;s administration continued to regard them as their masters&#x27; property, these refugees were in most cases declared &quot;contraband of war&quot; and simply called &quot;Contrabands&quot;. Many of them found refuge in makeshift camps, suffering and dying from want of the most basic necessities. Originally, Jacobs had planned to follow the example her brother John S. had set nearly two decades ago and become an abolitionist speaker, but now she saw that helping the &quot;Contrabands&quot; would mean rendering her race a service more urgently needed.

In the spring of 1862, Harriet Jacobs went to Washington, D.C. and neighboring Alexandria, Virginia. She summarized her experiences during the first months in a report entitled &quot;Life among the Contrabands&quot;, published in September in Garrison&#x27;s &quot;The Liberator&quot;. The author was featured as &quot;Mrs. Jacobs, the author of &#x27;Linda&#x27;&quot;. This report is a description of the fugitives&#x27; misery designed to appeal to donors, but it is also a political denunciation of slavery. Jacobs emphasizes her conviction that the freedmen will be able to build self-determined lives, if they get the necessary support.

During the fall of 1862, she traveled through the North using her popularity as author of &quot;Incidents&quot; to build up a network to support her relief work. The &quot;New York Friends&quot; (i.e. the Quakers) gave her credentials as a relief agent.

From January 1863, she made Alexandria the center of her activity. Together with Quaker Julia Wilbur, the teacher, feminist and abolitionist, whom she had already known in Rochester, she was distributing clothes and blankets and at the same time struggling with incompetent, corrupt, or openly racist authorities.

While doing relief work in Alexandria, Jacobs was also involved in the political world. In May 1863 she attended the yearly conference of the New England Anti-Slavery Society in Boston. Together with the other participants she watched the parade of the newly created 54th Massachusetts Infantry Regiment, consisting of black soldiers led by white officers. Since the Lincoln administration had declined to use African American soldiers only a few months past, this was a highly symbolic event. Jacobs expressed her joy and pride in a letter to Lydia Maria Child: &quot;How my heart swelled with the thought that my poor oppressed race were to strike a blow for freedom !&quot; 

==== The Jacobs School ====

In most slave states, teaching slaves to read and write had been forbidden. Virginia had even prohibited teaching these skills to free blacks. After Union troops occupied Alexandria in 1861, some schools for blacks emerged, but there was not a single free school under African American control. Jacobs supported a project conceived by the black community in 1863 to found a new school. In the fall of 1863 her daughter Louisa Matilda who had been trained as a teacher, came to Alexandria in the company of Virginia Lawton, a black friend of the Jacobs family. After some struggle with white missionaries from the North who wanted to take control of the school, the &quot;Jacobs School&quot; opened in January 1864 under Louisa Matilda&#x27;s leadership. In the &quot;National Anti-Slavery Standard&quot;, Harriet Jacobs explained that it was not disapproval of white teachers that made her fight for the school being controlled by the black community. But she wanted to help the former slaves, who had been raised &quot;to look upon the white race as their natural superiors and masters&quot;, to develop &quot;respect for their race&quot;.

Jacobs&#x27;s work in Alexandria was recognized on the local as well as on the national level, especially in abolitionist circles. In the spring of 1864 she was elected to the executive committee of the Women&#x27;s Loyal National League, a women&#x27;s organization founded in 1863 in response to an appeal by Susan B. Anthony which aimed at collecting signatures for a constitutional amendment to abolish slavery. On August 1, 1864, she delivered the speech on occasion of the celebration of the British West Indian Emancipation in front of the African American soldiers of a military hospital in Alexandria. Many abolitionists, among them Frederick Douglass, stopped over in Alexandria while touring the South in order to see Jacobs and her work. On a personal level, she found her labors highly rewarding. Already in December 1862 she had written to Amy Post that the preceding six months had been the happiest in her whole life.

==== Relief work with freedmen in Savannah ====
Mother and daughter Jacobs continued their relief work in Alexandria until after the victory of the Union. Convinced that the freedmen in Alexandria were able to care for themselves, they followed the call of the &quot;New England Freedmen&#x27;s Aid Society&quot; for teachers to help instruct the freedmen in Georgia. They arrived in Savannah, Georgia in November 1865, only 11 months after the slaves there had been freed by Sherman&#x27;s March to the Sea. During the following months they distributed clothes, opened a school and were planning to start an orphanage and an asylum for old people.

But the political situation had changed: Lincoln had been assassinated and his successor Andrew Johnson was a Southerner and former slaveholder. He ordered the removal of many freedmen from the land which had been allotted to them by the army just one year before. The land question together with the unjust labor contracts forced on the former slaves by their former enslavers with the help of the army, are an important subject in Jacobs&#x27;s reports from Georgia.

Already in July 1866, mother and daughter Jacobs left Savannah which was more and more suffering from anti-black violence. Once again, Harriet Jacobs went to Idlewild, to assist Cornelia Willis in caring for her dying husband until his death in January 1867.

In the spring of 1867, she visited the widow of her uncle Mark who was the only survivor of the family still living in Edenton. At the end of the year she undertook her last journey to Great Britain in order to collect money for the projected orphanage and asylum in Savannah. But after her return she had to realize that the anti-black terror in Georgia by the Ku-Klux-Klan and other groups rendered these projects impossible. The money collected was given to the asylum fund of the &quot;New York Friends&quot;.

In the 1860s a personal tragedy occurred: In the early 1850s, her son Joseph had gone to California to search for gold together with his uncle John. Later the two had continued on to Australia. John S. Jacobs later went to England, while Joseph stayed in Australia. Some time later, no more letters reached Jacobs from Australia. Using her connections to Australian clergymen, Child had an appeal on behalf of her friend read in Australian churches, but to no avail. Jacobs never again heard of her son.

===Later years and death===

After her return from England, Jacobs retired to private life. In Cambridge, Massachusetts, she kept a boarding house together with her daughter. Among her boarders were faculty members of nearby Harvard University. In 1873, her brother John S. returned to the U.S. together with his English wife, their son Joseph and two stepchildren to live close to his sister in Cambridge. He died in December of the same year, 1873. In 1877 Harriet and Louisa Jacobs moved to Washington, D.C., where Louisa hoped to get work as a teacher. However, she found work only for short periods. Mother and daughter again took to keeping a boarding house, until in 1887/88 Harriet Jacobs became too sick to continue with the boarding house. Mother and daughter took on odd jobs and were supported by friends, among them Cornelia Willis. Harriet Jacobs died on March 7, 1897, in Washington, D.C., and was buried at Mount Auburn Cemetery in Cambridge next to her brother. Her tombstone reads, &quot;Patient in tribulation, fervent in spirit serving the Lord&quot;. (Cf. Epistle to the Romans, 12:11–12)

=== Legacy ===
Prior to Jean Fagan Yellin&#x27;s research in the 1980s, the accepted academic opinion, voiced by such historians as John Blassingame, was that &quot;Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl&quot; was a fictional novel written by Lydia Maria Child. However, Yellin found and used a variety of historical documents, including from the Amy Post papers at the University of Rochester, state and local historical societies, and the Horniblow and Norcom papers at the North Carolina state archives, to establish both that Harriet Jacobs was the true author of &quot;Incidents,&quot; and that the narrative was her autobiography, not a work of fiction. Her edition of &quot;Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl&quot; was published in 1987 with the endorsement of Professor John Blassingame.

In 2004, Yellin published an exhaustive biography (394 pages) entitled &quot;Harriet Jacobs: A Life&quot;. Yellin also conceived of the idea of the Harriet Jacobs Papers Project. In 2000, an advisory board for the project was established, and after funding was awarded, the project began on a full-time basis in September 2002. Of the approximately 900 documents by, to, and about Harriet Jacobs, her brother John S. Jacobs, and her daughter Louisa Matilda Jacobs amassed by the Project, over 300 were published in 2008 in a two volume edition entitled &quot;The Harriet Jacobs Family Papers&quot;.

Today, Jacobs is seen as an &quot;icon of female resistance&quot;. David S. Reynolds&#x27; review of Yellin&#x27;s 2004 biography in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, states that &quot;Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl&quot; &quot;and &quot;Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, an American Slave&quot; are commonly viewed as the two most important slave narratives.&quot;

In an interview, Colson Whitehead, author of the best selling novel, &quot;The Underground Railroad&quot;, published in 2016, said: &quot;Harriet Jacobs is a big referent for the character of Cora&quot;, the heroine of the novel. Cora has to hide in a place in the attic of a house in Jacobs&#x27;s native North Carolina, where like Jacobs she is not able to stand, but like her can observe the outside life through a hole that &quot;had been carved from the inside, the work of a previous occupant&quot; (p. 185).

In 2017 Jacobs was the subject of an episode of the Futility Closet Podcast, where her experience living in a crawl space was compared with the wartime experience of Patrick Fowler.

According to a 2017 article in &quot;Forbes&quot; magazine, a 2013 translation of &quot;Incidents&quot; by Yuki Horikoshi became a bestseller in Japan.

In 2022, French artist Elizabeth Colomba painted a portrait of Jacobs. The title of the portrait, &quot;Tricked Out in a Gay and Fashionable Finery&quot;, was taken from the Norcom&#x27;s notice advertising Jacobs as a runaway.

At the end of her preface to the 2000 edition of &quot;Incidents&quot;, Yellin writes,

<text>John Ruskin College is a further education college in South Croydon offering full-time vocational courses and apprenticeships as well as part-time courses for adults.

In 2019, following a merger with &quot;East Surrey College&quot; incorporating &quot;Reigate School of Art,&quot; John Ruskin College became part of Orbital South Colleges.

John Ruskin College is located on Selsdon Park Road (A2022), close to the A212 roundabout. The College is accessible by tram via Gravel Hill tram stop, as well as various local bus services.

==History==
===Early years===
John Ruskin College was a former school in the London Borough of Croydon, which started life in 1920 as the John Ruskin Boys&#x27; Central School. Its location was &quot;Scarbrook Road&quot;, Croydon. Named after John Ruskin, it opened on 12 January 1920. The Lady Edridge School, its sister school for girls (later to become a grammar school in 1951) opened the same day. Lady Edridge was wife of a Mayor of Croydon and the first &quot;Lady Freeman&quot; of the Borough. It closed in 1980 and was demolished.

===Grammar and comprehensive school===
In 1935 the school moved to Tamworth Road, and in April 1945 it was granted grammar school status as the John Ruskin Grammar School for Boys (JRGS). It had been previously the John Ruskin Selective Central School. It moved to &quot;Upper Shirley Road&quot;, Shirley, in 1955, and was retitled the John Ruskin High School in 1971 before later becoming a 14-18 Co-Educational Comprehensive School. It was demolished in 1991. The Upper Shirley Road site surrounded the Shirley Windmill, a 19th-century tower mill. The upper forms transferred to Selsdon to form the present John Ruskin College, utilising the premises previously known as John Newnham Secondary Selective School, named after a 20th-century town clerk of the old County Borough of Croydon.

===The current College===
The current College was established in 1988 following re-organisation of post-16 studies in Croydon. It merged with East Surrey College in February 2019, creating Orbital South Colleges group.

<text>Lecturer is an academic rank within many universities, though the meaning of the term varies somewhat from country to country. It generally denotes an academic expert who is hired to teach on a full- or part-time basis. They may also conduct research.

==Comparison==
The table presents a broad overview of the traditional main systems, but there are universities which use a combinatio

==Uses around the world==

===Australia===
In Australia, the term lecturer may be used informally to refer to anyone who conducts lectures at a university or elsewhere, but formally refers to a specific academic rank. The academic ranks in Australia are similar to those in the UK, with the rank of associate professor roughly equivalent to reader in UK universities. The academic levels in Australia are (in ascending academic level): (A) associate lecturer, (B) lecturer, (C) senior lecturer, (D) associate professor, and (E) professor.

===India===
In India, one can appear for interviews for a post of a lecturer after passing the combility Test conducted by the University Grants Commission.

The position is equivalent to assistant professor in the US system. The term is not universally applied, with some universities preferring the lecturer/reader/professor titles, while others work with the assistant professor/associate professor/professor title.

As such, most lecturers&#x27; position can be considered tenure track.

In many states of India, the term lecturer or Post Graduate Teacher (PGT) is also used for the intermediate college teachers. The intermediate colleges or Junior Colleges are equivalent to higher secondary schools. Such lecturers are subject experts specifically engaged to teach a particular subject in higher classes.

===United Kingdom===
In the UK, the term lecturer is ambiguous and covers several academic ranks. The key distinction is between permanent/open-ended or temporary/fixed-term lectureships.

A permanent lecturer in UK universities usually holds an open-ended position that covers teaching, research, and administrative responsibilities. Permanent lectureships are tenure-track or tenured positions that are equivalent to an assistant or associate professorship in North America. After a number of years, a lecturer may be promoted based on their research record to become a senior lecturer. This position is below reader (principal lecturer in post-1992 universities) and professor.

In contrast, fixed-term or temporary lecturers are appointed for specific short-term teaching needs. These positions are often non-renewable and are common post-doctoral appointments. In North American terms, a fixed-term lecturer can hold an equivalent rank to non tenure-track (visiting) assistant professor. Typically, longer contracts denote greater seniority or higher rank. Teaching fellows may also sometimes be referred to as lecturers—for example, Exeter named some of that group as education and scholarship lecturers (E &amp; S) to recognise the contribution of teaching, and elevate the titles of teaching fellows to lecturers. Some universities also refer to graduate students or others, who undertake ad-hoc teaching for a department sessional lecturers. Like adjunct professors and sessional lecturers in North America, these non-permanent teaching staff are often very poorly paid (as little as £6000 p.a. in 2011–12). These differing uses of the term &quot;lecturer&quot; cause confusion for non-UK academics.

As a proportion of UK academic staff, the proportion of permanent lectureships has fallen considerably. This is one reason why permanent lectureships are usually secured only after several years of post-doctoral experience. Data from the Higher Education Statistics Agency show that in 2013–14, 36% of full- and part-time academic staff were on fixed-term contracts, down from 45% a decade earlier. Over the same period, the proportion of academic staff on permanent contracts rose from 55% to 64%. Others were on contracts classed as &quot;atypical&quot;.&#x27;

====Historical use====
Historically in the UK, promotion to a senior lectureship reflected prowess in teaching or administration rather than research, and the position was much less likely to lead directly to promotion to professor.

In contrast, promotion to senior lecturer nowadays is based on research achievements (for research-intensive universities), and is an integral part of the promotion path to a full chair. Promotion to reader (or principal lecturer in post-1992 universities) is sometimes still necessary before promotion to a full chair; however, some universities no longer make appointments at the level of reader (for instance, the University of Leeds and the University of Oxford). Senior lecturers and readers are sometimes paid on the same salary scale, although readers are recognized as more senior.

Many open-ended lecturers in the UK have a doctorate (50.1% in 2009–2010) and often have postdoctoral research experience. In almost all fields, a doctorate is a prerequisite, although historically this was not the case. Some academic positions could have been held on the basis of research merit alone, without a higher degree.

====Current uses====
The new universities (that is universities that were until 1992 termed polytechnics) have a slightly different ranking naming scheme from the older universities. Many pre-1992 universities use the grades: lecturer (A), lecturer (B), senior lecturer, reader, professor. Meanwhile, post-1992 grades are normally: lecturer, senior lecturer, principal lecturer (management-focused) or reader (research-focused), professor. Much confusion surrounds the differing use of the &quot;senior lecturer&quot; title. A senior lecturer in a post-1992 university is equivalent to a lecturer (B) in a pre-1992 university, whereas a senior lecturer in a pre-1992 university is most often equivalent to a principal lecturer in a post-1992 university.

According to the &quot;Times Higher Education&quot;, the University of Warwick decided in 2006 &quot;to break away from hundreds of years of academic tradition, renaming lecturers &#x27;assistant professors&#x27;, senior lecturers and readers &#x27;associate professors&#x27; while still calling professors &#x27;professors&#x27;. The radical move will horrify those who believe the &quot;professor&quot; title should be reserved for an academic elite.&quot; Nottingham has a mixture of the standard UK system, and the system at Warwick, with both lecturers and assistant professors. At Reading, job advertisements and academic staff web pages use the title associate professor, but the ordinances of the university make no reference to these titles. They address only procedures for conferring the traditional UK academic ranks.

====Tenure and permanent lectureships====
Since the Conservatives&#x27; 1988 Education Reform Act, the ironclad tenure that used to exist in the UK has given way to a less-secure form of tenure. Technically, university vice-chancellors can make individual faculty members redundant for poor performance or institute departmental redundancies, but in practice, this is rare. The most noted use of this policy happened in 2012 at Queen Mary University of London where lecturers on permanent contracts were fired. The institution now has a stated policy of firing and replacing under-performing &quot;teaching&quot; staff members. This policy is complicated by the 2008 &quot;Ball v Aberdeen&quot; tribunal decision, the distinction between teaching and research faculty is blurring—with implications for who can and cannot be made redundant at UK universities, and under what conditions.

Despite this recent erosion of tenure in the UK, it is still practised in most universities. Permanent contracts use the word &quot;tenure&quot; for lecturers who are &quot;reappointed to the retiring age&quot;. This is equivalent to a US tenure decision—references are sought from world-leading academics and tenure and promotions committees meet to decide &quot;tenure&quot; cases. There is normally no title elevation in such instances—tenure and title are independent.

===United States===

As different US academic institutions use the term lecturer in various ways, there is sometimes confusion. On a generic level, the term broadly denotes &quot;college-level faculty who are not eligible for tenure and have no research obligations&quot;. At non-research colleges, the latter distinction is less meaningful, making the absence of tenure the main difference between lecturers and other academic faculty. Unlike the adjective &quot;adjunct&quot; (which can modify most academic titles, and generally refers to part-time status), the title of lecturer at most schools does &quot;not&quot; address the issue of full-time vs. part-time status.

Lecturers are almost always required to have at least a master&#x27;s degree and quite often have earned doctorates. (For example, at Columbia University in New York, the title of lecturer actually requires a doctorate or its professional equivalent; they also use the term for &quot;instructors in specialized programs.&quot;) Sometimes the title is used as an equivalent alternative to instructor, but schools that use both titles tend to provide relatively more advancement potential (e.g. multiple ranks of progression, at least some of which entail faculty voting privileges or faculty committee service) to their lecturers. The term &quot;instructor&quot; can be broad enough to cover certain non-faculty teaching roles, such as when graduate students teach undergraduates.

Major research universities are more frequently hiring full-time lecturers, whose responsibilities tend to focus primarily in undergraduate education, especially for introductory/survey courses. In addition to the reason of higher-ranking faculty tending to prefer higher-level courses, part of the reason is also cost savings, as non-tenure-track faculty tend to have lower salaries. When a lecturer is part-time, there is little practical distinction in the position from an adjunct professor/instructor/etc., since all non-tenure-track faculty by definition are not on the tenure track. However, for full-time lecturers (or those regularly salaried above some stated level, such as half-time), many institutions now incorporate the role quite formally—managing it with performance reviews, promotional tracks, administrative service responsibilities, and many faculty privileges (e.g. voting, use of resources, etc.).

An emerging alternative to using full-time lecturers at research institutions is to create a parallel professorship track that is focused on teaching. It may offer tenure, and typically has a title series such as teaching professor. (This is analogous to the &quot;research-only&quot; faculty tracks at some universities, which typically have title series such as research professor/scientist/scholar.) A related concept—at least in professional fields—is the clinical professor or professor of practice, which in addition to a teaching focus (vs. research), also tend to have a practical/professional/skills oriented focus (vs. theory and scholarship, etc.).

In some institutions, the position of lecturer, especially &quot;distinguished lecturer&quot;, may also refer to a position somewhat similar to &quot;emeritus professor&quot; or a temporary post used for visiting academics of considerable prominence—e.g. a famous writer may serve for a term or a year, for instance. When confusion arose about President Barack Obama&#x27;s status on the faculty at the University of Chicago Law School, the institution stated that although his title was &quot;senior lecturer&quot;, the university considered him to be a &quot;professor&quot; and further noted that it uses that title for notable people, such as federal judges and politicians, who are deemed of high prestige but lack the time to commit to a traditional tenure-track position. Other universities instead use the term &quot;senior&quot; in that context as simply a matter of rank or promotion. In any case, references to lecturers of any rank as &quot;professors&quot; are consistent with the normal U.S. practice of using &quot;lower-case p&quot; &quot;professor&quot; as a common noun for anyone who teaches college, as well as a &quot;pre-nominal&quot; title of address (e.g. &quot;Professor Smith&quot;) without necessarily referring to &quot;job&quot; title or position &quot;rank&quot; (e.g. &quot;John Smith, Assistant/Associate/Full Professor of X&quot;).

===Other countries===
In other countries, usage varies. 

In Israel, the term has a meaning in academia similar to that in the UK.

In France, the title &quot;maître de conférences&quot; (&quot;lecture master&quot;) is a permanent position that covers research and teaching (and usually administrative responsibilities). It is the lower of the two permanent faculty ranks (the other being &quot;professeur des universités&quot; or &quot;university professor&quot;). The title of &quot;lecteur&quot; is used for teachers of foreign languages with no research responsibilities.

In German-speaking countries, the term &quot;lektor&quot; historically denoted a teaching position below a professor, primarily responsible for delivering and organizing lectures. The contemporary equivalent is &quot;dozent&quot;. Nowadays, the German term &quot;lektor&quot; exists only in philology or modern-language departments at German-speaking universities for positions that primarily involve teaching a foreign language. The equivalent rank within the German university system is something like &quot;Juniorprofessor&quot;, &quot;Dozent&quot;, &quot;Hochschuldozent&quot;, &quot;Juniordozent&quot;, &quot;Akademischer Rat&quot; or &quot;-Oberrat&quot;, &quot;Lehrkraft für besondere Aufgaben&quot;, and the like. The ranks &quot;Lecturer&quot; and &quot;Senior Lecturer&quot; are also increasingly being adopted by universities in Germany and the German-speaking part of Switzerland. It is used for some members of academic staff with permanent positions.

In Poland, the related term &quot;wykładowca&quot;, is used for a teaching-only position, and as profession, academic teacher (&quot;nauczyciel akademicki&quot;), also with doctoral degrees or title of professor.

In Russia, a &quot;lektor&quot; is not an academic rank or a position name, but simply a description of an educator who delivers a set of lectures on a specific course. The title doesn&#x27;t carry any particular teaching or research obligations and is simply a technical description. While lektors tend to be senior educators (such as professors or associate professors), any member of the faculty from an associate up can deliver lectures.

In Norway, a &quot;lektor&quot;, University Lektor and University College Lektor are academic ranks at universities and university colleges in Norway. The requirements for such position is a combination of relevant degree on master level (five years master or bachelor plus two years master) or higher, research experience, teaching experience and pedagogic education and training. The rank is similar to lecturer in Great Britain.
The rank is also an academic rank which enables a teacher to lecture at Ungdomsskole (secondary school) on specialized fields and Videregående skole (high school) level. All teacher students in Norway are now required to reach a master&#x27;s degree in order to be able to teach at all levels up to universities and university colleges. 
In Sweden and Denmark, a &quot;lektor&quot; or &quot;universitetslektor&quot; is an academic rank similar to that of senior lecturer in Great Britain and associate professor in USA. The &quot;lektor&quot; holds the position below professor in rank.

In Estonia, lektor (lecturer) is an academic rank equivalent to associate professor in the US and senior lecturer in Great Britain. Lecturers in Estonia usually hold PhD degree and are engaged in lecturing and research.

In Singapore, a lecturer at the National University of Singapore is a full-time and renewable position that includes both the opportunities for research funding and for promotion to associate professor on the Educator Track. It is equivalent to assistant professor at a US university.

In South Korea, the term &quot;gangsa&quot; (강사) is the literal translation of &quot;part-time lecturer&quot;. A gangsa is usually part-time, paid by the number of hours of teaching. No research or administrative obligation is attached. In many disciplines, gangsa is regarded as a first step in one&#x27;s academic career. In Korea, the tenure position started from &quot;full-time lecturer&quot;. The tenure track positions in South Korea are &quot;full-time lecturer (JunImGangSa, 전임강사)&quot;, &quot;assistant professor (JoKyoSu, 조교수)&quot;, &quot;associate professor (BuKyosu, 부교수)&quot;, and &quot;professor (KyoSu or JungKyosu, 교수 or 정교수, respectively)&quot;. Therefore, &quot;full-time lecturer&quot; is the same position as &quot;assistant professor&quot; in other countries, including the US.

In the Netherlands, a &quot;lector&quot; used to be equivalent to the rank of associate professor at universities. Nowadays, it is the highest academic rank at universities of applied sciences. At regular universities, this rank does not exist anymore.

<text>The ackee (Blighia sapida), also known as acki, akee, or ackee apple, is a fruit of the Sapindaceae (soapberry) family, as are the lychee and the longan. It is native to tropical West Africa. The scientific name honours Captain William Bligh who took the fruit from Jamaica to the Royal Botanic Gardens in Kew, England, in 1793. The English common name is derived from the West African Akan-language name .

Although having a long-held reputation as being poisonous with potential fatalities, the fruit arils are renowned as delicious when ripe, prepared properly, and cooked and are a feature of various Caribbean cuisines. Ackee is the national fruit of Jamaica and is considered a delicacy.

==Botany==
Ackee is an evergreen tree that grows about 10 metres tall, with a short trunk and a dense crown. The leaves are paripinnately, compound long, with 6–10 elliptical to oblong leathery leaflets. Each leaflet is long and wide. The inflorescences are fragrant, up to 20 cm long, with unisexual flowers that bloom during warm months. Each flower has five greenish-white petals, which are fragrant.

The fruit is pear-shaped and has three lobes (two to four lobes are common). When it ripens it turns from green to a bright red to yellow-orange and splits open to reveal three large, shiny black seeds, each partly surrounded by soft, creamy or spongy, white to yellow flesh — the aril having a nut-like flavor and texture of scrambled eggs. The fruit typically weighs . The tree can produce fruit throughout the year, although January–March and October–November are typically periods of fruit production.

==Cultivars==
There are up to as many as forty-eight cultivars of ackee, which are grouped into either &quot;butter&quot; or &quot;cheese&quot; types. The cheese type is pale yellow in color and is more robust and finds use in the canning industry. The butter type is deeper yellow in color, and is more delicate and better suited for certain cuisine.

==History and culinary use==

Imported to Jamaica from West Africa before 1773, the use of ackee in Jamaican cuisine is prominent. Ackee is the national fruit of Jamaica, whilst ackee and saltfish is the official national dish of Jamaica.

The ackee is allowed to open fully before picking in order to eliminate toxicity. When it has &quot;yawned&quot; or &quot;smiled&quot;, the seeds are discarded and the fresh, firm arils are parboiled in salted water or milk, and may be fried in butter to create a dish. In Caribbean cooking, they may be cooked with codfish and vegetables, or may be added to stew, curry, soup or rice with seasonings.

== Nutrition ==
Ackee contains a moderate amount of carbohydrates, protein, and fat, providing 51–58% of the dry weight of the arils as composed of fatty acids – linoleic, palmitic, and stearic acids. The raw fruit is a rich source of vitamin C.

== Society and culture ==
The ackee is prominently featured in the Jamaican mento style folksong &quot;Linstead Market&quot;. In the song, a market seller laments, &quot;Carry mi ackee go a Linstead market. Not a quattie worth sell&quot;.
The Beat&#x27;s 1982 album &quot;Special Beat Service&quot; includes the song &quot;Ackee 1-2-3&quot;.

==Toxicity==
The unripened aril and the inedible portions of the fruit contain hypoglycin toxins including hypoglycin A and hypoglycin B, known as &quot;soapberry toxins&quot;. Hypoglycin A is found in both the seeds and the arils, while hypoglycin B is found only in the seeds. Minimal quantities of the toxin are found in the ripe arils. In the unripe fruit, depending on the season and exposure to the sun, the concentrations may be up to 10 to 100 times greater.

These two molecules are converted in the body to methylenecyclopropylacetic acid (MCPA), and are toxic with potential lethality. MCPA and hypoglycin A inhibit several enzymes involved in the breakdown of acyl CoA compounds, often binding irreversibly to coenzyme A, carnitine and carnitine acyltransferase I and II, reducing their bioavailability and consequently inhibiting beta oxidation of fatty acids. Glucose stores are consequently depleted leading to hypoglycemia, and to a condition called Jamaican vomiting sickness. These effects occur only when the unripe aril (or an inedible part of the fruit) is consumed.

Though ackee is used widely in traditional dishes, research on its potential hypoglycin toxicity has been sparse and preliminary, requiring evaluation in well-designed clinical research to better understand its pharmacology, food uses, and methods for detoxification.

In 2011, it was found that as the fruit ripens, the seeds act as a sink whereby the hypoglycin A in the arils convert to hypoglycin B in the seeds. In other words, the seeds help in detoxifying the arils, bringing the concentration of hypoglycin A to a level which is generally safe for consumption.

==Commercial use==
Ackee canned in brine is a commodity item and is used for export by Jamaica, Haiti and Belize. If propagated by seed, trees will begin to fruit in 3–4 years. Cuttings may yield fruit in 1–2 years.

==Other uses==
The fruit has various uses in West Africa and in rural areas of the Caribbean Islands, including use of its &quot;soap&quot; properties as a laundering agent or fish poison. The fragrant flowers may be used as decoration or cologne, and the durable heartwood used for construction, pilings, oars, paddles and casks. In African traditional medicine, the ripe arils, leaves or bark were used to treat minor ailments.

The seeds were formerly used as standardized weights for weighing gold dust, leading to the currency issued by Great Britain in the former colony of Gold Coast to be named the &quot;Gold Coast ackey&quot;.

<doc id="366351" wikidata="Q6971091" url="?curid=366351" title="National Book Critics Circle">
<text>The National Book Critics Circle (NBCC) is an American nonprofit organization (501(c)(3)) with more than 700 members. It is the professional association of American book review editors and critics, known primarily for the National Book Critics Circle Awards, a set of literary awards presented every March. These are for Criticism, 
Fiction, Autobiography, Biography, Nonfiction, Poetry and the Gregg Barrios Book in Translation Prize.

The organization was founded in April 1974 in New York City by &quot;John Leonard, Nona Balakian, and Ivan Sandrof intending to extend the Algonquin round table to a national conversation&quot;.

It was formally chartered in October 1974 as a New York state non-profit corporation, and the Advisory Board voted in November to establish annual literary awards.

In the first newsletter three months later, President Ivan Sandrof proclaimed the primary purpose &quot;to improve and maintain the standards of literary criticism in an era of diminishing and deteriorating values&quot;. At that time there were 140 members, with outreach to freelance critics planned for that year.

NBCC first presented its Awards in January 1976 to books published during 1975 in four categories.

Only active review editors and reviewers may be voting members; they elect the 24 Directors who formally make nominations and alone make final selections each year.

A fifth award category for books (Autobiography/Biography) was added for 1983 and divided in two for 2005. Since 2005, there have been eight awards. Six National Book Critics Circle Awards recognize &quot;best books&quot; published in the United States during the preceding year in six categories: fiction, nonfiction, autobiography, biography, criticism, and poetry.
Annually &quot;the most accomplished reviewer&quot; among its members is recognized by the Nona Balakian Citation for Excellence in Reviewing (from 1991).

The NBCC also recognizes no more than one person or organization for &quot;exceptional contributions to books&quot; with the Ivan Sandrof Lifetime Achievement Award (from 1981 under more than one name).All eight awards are officially dated in the preceding year.

As a professional association, NBCC also works to improve the quality of reviews and provides services to its members.

== Controversies ==
In 2020, more than half of the 24 board members resigned over conflicting views on how to address perceived racial disparities both on the board, and within the industry they represent. This demonstrative revolt has also been attributed to breaches in confidentiality stemming from leaked emails, and the dismissive, antagonistic communication style of a long-standing board member, Carlin Romano, whom half the board members describe as a bully. Overall, the mass resignations amount to a controversy seen as part of an industry-wide reckoning concerning the lack of diversity in publishing and literary awards.

<text>The National Book Critics Circle Awards are a set of annual American literary awards by the National Book Critics Circle (NBCC) to promote &quot;the finest books and reviews published in English&quot;. The first NBCC awards were announced and presented January 16, 1976.

Six awards are presented annually to books published in the U.S. during the preceding calendar year, in six categories: Fiction, Nonfiction, Poetry, Memoir/Autobiography, Biography, and Criticism. Four of them span the entire NBCC award history; Memoir/Autobiography and Biography were recognized by one &quot;Autobiography/Biography&quot; award for publication years 1983 to 2004, then replaced by two awards. Beginning in 2014, the NBCC also presents a special &quot;first book&quot; award across all six categories, named the John Leonard Award in honor of literary critic and NBCC founding member John Leonard, who died in 2008.

Books previously published in English are not eligible, such as re-issues and paperback editions. Nor does the NBC Circle consider &quot;cookbooks, self help books (including inspirational literature), reference books, picture books or children&#x27;s books&quot;. They do consider &quot;translations, short story and essay collections, self published books, and any titles that fall under the general categories&quot;.

The judges are the volunteer directors of the NBCC who are 24 members serving rotating three-year terms, with eight elected annually by the voting members, namely &quot;professional book review editors and book reviewers&quot;.

Winners of the awards are announced each year at the NBCC awards ceremony in conjunction with the yearly membership meeting, which takes place in March.
