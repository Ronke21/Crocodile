<text>Monmouthshire ( ; ) is a county in the south east of Wales. It borders Powys to the north; the English counties of Herefordshire and Gloucestershire to the north and east; the Severn Estuary to the south, and Torfaen, Newport and Blaenau Gwent to the west. The largest town is Abergavenny, and the administrative centre is Usk. The county is administered by Monmouthshire County Council. It sends two directly-elected members to the Senedd at Cardiff and one elected member to the UK parliament at Westminster. The county name is identical to that of the historic county, of which the current local authority covers the eastern three-fifths. Between 1974 and 1996, the county was known as Gwent, recalling the medieval kingdom which covered a similar area. The present county was formed under the Local Government (Wales) Act 1994, which came into effect in 1996. In his essay &#x27;Changes in local government&#x27;, in the fifth and final volume of the Gwent County History, Robert McCloy writes, &quot;the local government of no county in the United Kingdom in the twentieth century was so transformed as that of Monmouthshire&quot;.

The lowlands in the centre of Monmouthshire are gently undulating, and shaped by the River Usk and its tributaries. The west of the county is hilly, and the Black Mountains in the northwest are part of the Brecon Beacons National Park (&quot;Bannau Brycheiniog&quot;). The border with England in the east largely follows the course of the River Wye and its tributary, the River Monnow. In the south east is the Wye Valley AONB, a hilly region which stretches into England. The county has a shoreline on the Severn Estuary, with crossings into England by the Severn Bridge and Prince of Wales Bridge.

The county is rural, although adjacent to the city of Newport and the urbanised South Wales Valleys; it has an area of and a population of 93,000. After Abergavenny (population, 12,515), the largest towns are Chepstow (12,350), Monmouth (10,508), and Caldicot (9,813). The county has one of the lowest percentages of Welsh speakers in Wales, at 8.2% of the population in 2021. The county is among the more economically prosperous of the Welsh principal areas, with a predominantly service economy giving annual incomes of around £41,000 in 2020, some £9,000 above the Welsh average. Agriculture and tourism are other important economic sectors. Transport infrastructure is provided by the M4 and M48 motorways in the south of the county, linking Monmouthshire and Wales with England; and by rail links in the south and the north. Public services are mainly organised on a south east Wales region basis, including the South Wales Fire and Rescue Service, Gwent Police and the Aneurin Bevan University Health Board. 

The Gwent Levels have signs of human occupation dating back eight millennia. At the time of the Roman invasion, the Silures, the dominant tribe in south-east Wales, carried out a thirty-year opposition to Roman occupation, but were eventually subdued, the Romans asserting their control through the establishment of fortified settlements such as Venta Silurum, modern-day Caerwent. The sub-Roman history of the county is poorly documented but saw the founding of petty kingdoms including that of Gwent. Monmouthshire&#x27;s turbulent medieval history on the Welsh Marches is reflected in its &quot;fine collection&quot; of castles, including that at Chepstow, &quot;one of the great strongholds of Europe&quot;. Henry V was born at Monmouth Castle in 1386. War in the county continued into the 17th century, Raglan Castle was among the last Royalist strongholds to fall to Parliamentarian forces in the English Civil War. Military disruption was followed by civil unrest: in the 17th century, the county was a recusant stronghold and saw widespread persecution of Catholics; in the 19th century, John Frost and other Chartist leaders were tried and sentenced to death at the Shire Hall, Monmouth after the &quot;first mass movement of the working class&quot; in Britain. The advent of a more stable society in the early 19th century saw the county develop as a centre for tourism; the Wye Tour down the river valley in the east of the county culminated for visitors with the ruins of Tintern Abbey. In the 20th and 21st centuries tourism and leisure continue as important foci for the county&#x27;s population; Wales&#x27;s richest horse race runs at Chepstow Racecourse; the Savoy Theatre, Monmouth has claims to be Wales&#x27;s oldest; and Rockfield Studios has been used for recording sessions by some of the UK&#x27;s biggest bands.

==History==
===Pre-History===
Evidence of human activity in the Mesolithic period has been found across Monmouthshire; examples include remains on the Caldicot and Wentloog Levels and at Monmouth. A major hoard of Bronze Age axes was discovered at St Arvans. The county has a number of hillfort sites, such as those at Bulwark and Llanmelin Wood. The latter has been suggested as the capital of the Silures, a Celtic tribe who occupied south-east Wales in the Iron Age. The Silures proved among the most intractable of Rome&#x27;s opponents; Tacitus described them as &quot;exceptionally stubborn&quot; and Raymond Howell, in his county history published in 1988, notes that while it took the Romans five years to subdue south-east England, it took thirty-five before complete subjugation of the Silurian territories was achieved.

===Roman period===
The Roman conquest of Britain began in AD 43, and within five years the Roman Empire&#x27;s legions had reached the borders of what is now Wales. In south east Wales they encountered strong resistance from the Silures, led by Caratacus (Caradog), who had fled west after the defeat of his own tribe, the Catuvellauni. His final defeat in AD 50 saw his transportation to Rome, but Silurian resistance continued, and the subjugation of the entirety of south east Wales was not achieved until around AD 75, under the governor of Britain, Sextus Julius Frontinus. 

Monmouthshire&#x27;s most important Roman remains are found at the town of Venta Silurum (&quot;Market of the Silures&quot;), present-day Caerwent in the south of the county. The town was established in AD 75, laid out in the traditional rectangular Roman pattern of twenty insulae with a basilica and a temple flanking a forum. Other Roman settlements in the area included Blestium (Monmouth). The Romanisation of Monmouthshire was not without continuing civil unrest; the defences at Caerwent, and at Caerleon, underwent considerable strengthening in the late 2nd century in response to disturbances. The Silurian identity was not extinguished: the establishment of a &quot;Respublica Civitatis Silurium&quot; (an early town council) at the beginning of the 3rd century testifies to the longevity of the indigenous tribal culture.

===Sub-Roman period===

The Roman abandonment of Britain from AD 383 saw the division of Wales into a number of petty kingdoms. In the south east (the present county of Monmouthshire) the Kingdom of Gwent was established, traditionally by Caradoc, in the 5th or 6th centuries. Its capital, Caerwent, gave the name to the kingdom. The subsequent history of the area prior to the Norman Conquest is poorly documented and complex. The Kingdom of Gwent frequently fought with the neighbouring Welsh kingdoms, and sometimes joined in alliance with them in, generally successful, attempts to repel the Anglo-Saxons, their common enemy. The Book of Llandaff records such a victory over the Saxon invaders achieved by Tewdrig at a battle near Tintern in the late 6th century. An example of the alliances formed by neighbouring petty kings was the Kingdom of Morgannwg, a union between Gwent and its western neighbour, the Kingdom of Glywysing, which formed and reformed between the 8th and the 10th centuries. The common threat they faced is shown in Offa&#x27;s Dyke, the physical delineation of a border with Wales created by the Mercian king. For a brief period in the 11th century, Monmouthshire, as Gwent, became part of a united Wales under  Gruffydd ap Llywelyn, but his death in 1063 was soon followed by that of his opponent Harold Godwinson at the Battle of Hastings, and the re-established unity of the country was to come from Norman dominance.

===Norman period and Middle Ages===
The Norman invasion of South Wales from the late 1060s saw the destruction of the Kingdom of Gwent, and its replacement by five Marcher lordships based at Striguil (Chepstow), Monmouth, Abergavenny, Usk and Caerleon. The Marcher Lord of Abergavenny, Gilbert de Clare, 7th Earl of Gloucester, described the rule of the lords as &quot;sicut regale&quot; (&quot;like unto a king&quot;). The lords established castles, first earth and wood motte-and-bailey constructions, and later substantial structures in stone. Among the first were Chepstow Castle, begun by William FitzOsbern, 1st Earl of Hereford as early as 1067, and that at Tregrug, near Llangybi, by de Clare&#x27;s son, Gilbert. The historian John Kenyon describes Chepstow as &quot;one of the great strongholds of Europe&quot;. In the early Norman period, the cleric and chronicler, Geoffrey of Monmouth (c. 1095 – c. 1155), who may have been born at Monmouth, wrote his &quot;The History of the Kings of Britain&quot;, with a focus on King Arthur and on his capital, Camelot, which Geoffrey located at Caerleon (now in Newport), and which remained highly influential for centuries, although modern scholars consider it little more than a literary forgery.

Christmas 1175 saw an outbreak of particular violence in the gradual extension of Norman control over South Wales. The Marcher lord William de Braose invited Seisyll ap Dyfnwal, lord of Upper Gwent, and an array of other Welsh notables to a feast at Abergavenny Castle. De Braose proceeded to have his men massacre the Welsh, before sending them to burn Seisyll&#x27;s home at Castell Arnallt and to murder his son, intending the obliteration of the indigenous Gwent aristocracy. A wave of Welsh retaliation followed, described in detail by the contemporary chronicler, Gerald of Wales. 

Monmouthshire&#x27;s Norman castles later became favoured residences of the Plantagenet nobility. Henry of Grosmont, Duke of Lancaster (c. 1310–1361), was reputedly born at Grosmont Castle, home of his father Henry, 3rd Earl of Lancaster, grandson of Henry III. Becoming the richest and among the most powerful lords in England, Grosmont developed the castle as a sumptuous residence, while the village became an important medieval settlement. Henry V (1386–1422) was born at his father&#x27;s castle at Monmouth in 1386, and his birth, and his most famous military victory, are commemorated in Agincourt Square in the town, and by a statue on the frontage of the Shire Hall which forms the square&#x27;s centrepiece. In Henry V&#x27;s wars in France, he received strong military support from the archers of Gwent, who were famed for their skill with the Welsh bow. Gerald recorded, &quot;the men of Gwent are more skilled with the bow and arrow than those who come from other parts of Wales&quot;.

There was a brief reassertion of Welsh autonomy in Monmouthshire during the Glyndŵr rebellion of 1400 to 1415. Seeking to re-establish Welsh independence, the revolt began in the north, but by 1403 Owain Glyndŵr&#x27;s army was in Monmouthshire, sacking Usk and securing a victory over the English at Craig-y-dorth, near Cwmcarvan. According to the &quot;Annals of Owain Glyn Dwr&quot;, &quot;there the English were killed for the most part and they were pursued up to the gates of the town&quot; (of Monmouth). This was the high water mark of the revolt; heavy defeats in the county followed in 1405, at the Battle of Grosmont, and at the Battle of Pwll Melyn, traditionally located near Usk Castle, where Glyndŵr&#x27;s brother was killed and his eldest son captured. The chronicler Adam of Usk, a contemporary observer, noted that &quot;from this time onward, Owain&#x27;s fortunes began to wane in that region.&quot;

===Monmouthshire 1535–1974===

====Tudor reforms====

The first Tudor king, Henry VII, was born at Pembroke Castle in the west of Wales, and spent some of his childhood in Monmouthshire, at Raglan Castle as a ward of William Herbert, 1st Earl of Pembroke. His son and heir Henry VIII was to bring the rule of the Marcher lords to an end. The historic county of Monmouthshire was formed from the Welsh Marches by the Laws in Wales Act 1535. The Laws in Wales Act 1542 enumerated the counties of Wales and omitted Monmouthshire, implying that the county was no longer to be treated as part of Wales. Though for all purposes Wales had become part of the Kingdom of England, and the difference had little practical effect, it did begin a centuries-long dispute as to Monmouthshire&#x27;s status as a &quot;Welsh&quot; or as an &quot;English&quot; county, a debate only finally brought to an end in 1972.

The laws establishing the 13 counties (shires), the historic counties of Wales, assigned four for the five new counties created from the Marcher Lordships along the Welsh/English border, Brecknockshire, Denbighshire, Montgomeryshire and Radnorshire, to the legal system operated in Wales, administered by the Court of Great Sessions. Monmouthshire was assigned to the Oxford circuit of the English Assizes. This began a legal separation which continued until 1972; for example, the administrative county of Monmouthshire and the boroughs of Newport, Abergavenny and Monmouth were explicitly listed as being in England rather than Wales in first schedule of the Local Government Act 1933. For several centuries, acts of the Parliament of England (in which Wales was represented) often referred to &quot;Wales and Monmouthshire&quot;, such as the Welsh Church Act 1914.

====Civil war and religious strife====
Monmouthshire in the 1600s experienced to a high degree the political and religious convulsions arising from the English Reformation and culminating in the English Civil War. Following Henry VII&#x27;s religious reforms, the county had a reputation for recusancy, with the strongly Catholic Marquesses of Worcester (later Dukes of Beaufort) at its apex, from their powerbase at Raglan Castle. The outbreak of war saw the county predominantly Royalist in its sympathies; Henry Somerset, 1st Marquess of Worcester expended a fortune in support of Charles I and twice entertained him at Raglan. His generosity was unavailing; the castle fell after a siege in 1646; the marquess died in captivity and his son spent time in prison and in exile abroad. 

John Arnold, member of parliament for Monmouth Boroughs in the late 17th century, was a virulent opponent of Catholics and pursued a policy of harassment from the 1670s. Monmouthshire’s only dukedom was created in 1663 for James Scott, 1st Duke of Monmouth, but became forfeit following Scott’s execution after the failed Monmouth Rebellion in 1685. In the 18th and much of the 19th centuries county politics was dominated by the Beauforts and the Morgans, &quot;an everlasting friendship between the houses of Raglan and Tredegar&quot;, and by the end of the 19th century, these two families, along with the Hanburys of Pontypool, held between them over a fifth of the total land in the county.

====Industrialisation====

Industrialisation came early to Monmouthshire; the first brass in Britain was produced at a foundry at Tintern in 1568, and the lower Wye Valley and the Forest of Dean became important centres for metalworking and mining. But the most dramatic impact was in the west of the county during the Industrial Revolution, in the South Wales Coalfield, where some of the largest pits in Wales were dug, and a major iron industry developed. The societal transformation was accompanied by great inequality and unrest. Chartism was firmly embedded in Wales, and in 1840 the Chartist leaders John Frost, Zephaniah Williams and William Jones were tried for sedition and treason at the Shire Hall, Monmouth, after a failed insurrection at Newport, which the writer Clive Aslet called &quot;the first mass movement of the working class&quot;. Their death sentences were subsequently commuted to transportation to Australia.

Industrialisation also drove improvements in transportation; in the 18th century, the poor state of Monmouthshire&#x27;s roads approached a national scandal. During a debate in parliament on the establishment of a turnpike trust for the county, the local landowner Valentine Morris asserted that the inhabitants of the county travelled &quot;in ditches&quot;. By the mid-century, commercial demands saw the first timetabled stagecoach between London and Monmouth arrive in Agincourt Square on 4 November 1763, the journey having taken four days. By the end of the century, the need for access to exploit the South Wales Coalfields saw the development of trams and canals.

====Society, art and science====
Tourism became prominent in Monmouthshire at the end of the 18th century, when the French Revolution and the subsequent Napoleonic Wars precluded travel to Continental Europe. The focus of activity was the Wye Tour, first popularised by the Rev. William Gilpin, in his &quot;Observations on the River Wye and Several Parts of South Wales, etc. Relative Chiefly to Picturesque Beauty&quot;, published in 1782. Although his efforts were sometimes satirised, Gilpin established what became the conventional route down the &quot;mazy course&quot; of the River Wye, with visitors embarking at Ross-on-Wye, and sailing past Symonds Yat, and Monmouth, before the highlight of the tour, Tintern Abbey. Voyages concluded at Chepstow. The abbey at Tintern inspired artists and writers; J. M. W. Turner painted it; William Wordsworth committed it to verse; and Samuel Taylor Coleridge almost died there. Another object of interest to artists undertaking the Wye Tour was the Monnow Bridge at Monmouth. A late 18th-century watercolour by Michael Angelo Rooker is now in the Monmouth Museum. The noted architectural watercolourist Samuel Prout painted the bridge in a study dated &quot;before 1814&quot;, now held at the Yale Center for British Art in Connecticut. In 1795, J. M. W. Turner sketched the bridge and gatehouse during one of his annual summer sketching tours.

Alfred Russel Wallace, a naturalist whose independent work on natural selection saw Charles Darwin bring forward the publication of &quot;On the Origin of Species&quot;, was born at Llanbadoc, outside Usk, in 1823. He is commemorated in a statue raised in the town&#x27;s Twyn Square in 2021. Bertrand Russell, the philosopher and the only Nobel laureate from the county, was born at Cleddon Hall, outside Trellech in 1872. Charles Rolls grew up at his family seat, The Hendre, just north of Monmouth and, in partnership with Henry Royce, co-founded Rolls-Royce Limited. An aviation pioneer, as well as an automobile innovator, he died in a plane crash in 1910, and is commemorated by a statue in Agincourt Square in Monmouth.

====War====

The Royal Monmouthshire Royal Engineers was founded in 1539, making it the second-oldest regiment in the British Army. Originally a county militia, it was amalgamated into the Royal Engineers in 1877. It is based at Monmouth Castle. Fitzroy Somerset, a younger son of the 5th Duke of Beaufort, enjoyed a long military career, serving on the staff of the Duke of Wellington at the Battle of Waterloo, and as commander-in-chief of the British forces during the Crimean War. Created Baron Raglan in 1852, he died in 1855. His son was gifted Cefntilla Court, near Llandenny in his memory. William Wilson Allen, who fought with the South Wales Borderers at the Battle of Rorke&#x27;s Drift in 1879, is buried in Monmouth Cemetery, the only grave in the county of a holder of the Victoria Cross. The Monmouthshire Regiment was established in 1907. Men from the regiment fought in both the First and Second World Wars, until its disbandment in 1967. HMS &quot;Monmouth&quot; was sunk at the Battle of Coronel in November 1914, with the loss of all 734 crew.

===Gwent 1974–1996===

The Local Government Act 1972, which came into effect in April 1974, created the county of Gwent, confirmed it as part of Wales, and abolished the historic administrative county of Monmouthshire and its associated lieutenancy. It also subsumed Newport County Borough Council, creating a two-tier system of local government across the county. The entire county was administered by Gwent County Council, based at County Hall, Cwmbran, with five district councils below it: Blaenau Gwent, Islwyn, Monmouth, Newport and Torfaen. The largest five towns in the new county were Newport, Cwmbran, Pontypool, Ebbw Vale and Abergavenny. In the 1979 Welsh devolution referendum Gwent voted heavily against the proposal for a Welsh Assembly with limited powers, with a &quot;No Vote&quot; of 87.9 per cent, with the national &quot;No Vote&quot; standing at 79.7 per cent.

===Late 20th and 21st centuries===
The Local Government (Wales) Act 1994 created the present local government structure in Wales of 22 unitary authority areas, the principal areas, and abolished the previous two-tier structure of counties and districts. It came into effect on 1 April 1996. It brought to an end the 22-year existence of Gwent, and re-created the county of Monmouthshire, although only with the eastern three-fifths of its historic area, and with a substantially reduced population. The western two-fifths of the county were included in other principal areas: Caerphilly County Borough, part of which came from Mid Glamorgan, including the towns of Newbridge, Blackwood, New Tredegar and Rhymney; Blaenau Gwent County Borough, including Abertillery, Brynmawr, Ebbw Vale and Tredegar; Torfaen, including Blaenavon, Abersychan, Pontypool, and Cwmbran; and the City of Newport, including Caerleon as it had since 1974. The new Monmouthshire, covering the less populated eastern 60% of the historic county, included the towns of Abergavenny, Caldicot, Chepstow, Monmouth and Usk. In his essay on local government in the fifth and final volume of the Gwent County History, Robert McCloy suggests that the governance of &quot;no county in the United Kingdom in the twentieth century was so transformed as that of Monmouthshire&quot;.

The title of Gwent continues as a preserved county, one of eight such counties in Wales, which have mainly ceremonial functions such as the lord lieutenancy and high shrievality. In 2024 the lord lieutenant is Brigadier Robert Aitken, appointed in 2016, and the high sheriff is Professor Simon J. Gibson. The preserved county is also retained for a limited number of public service bodies which operate across principal areas, for example Gwent Police. In the 1997 Welsh devolution referendum for the establishment of a National Assembly for Wales, which resulted in a narrow &quot;Yes&quot; vote, 50.30 per cent in favour v. 49.70 per cent against, Monmouthshire recorded the highest &quot;No&quot; vote of any principal area, its population voting 67.9 per cent against to 32.1 per cent in favour.

==Geography==

Monmouthshire is broadly rectangular in shape, and borders the county of Powys to the north and the county boroughs of Newport, Torfaen and Blaenau Gwent to the west, with its southern border on the Severn Estuary giving the county its only coastline. To the east, it borders the English counties of Herefordshire and Gloucestershire. The centre of the county is the plain of Gwent, formed from the basin of the River Usk, while the River Wye forms part of its eastern border, running through the Wye Valley, one of the five Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty in Wales and the only one in the county. 

The north and west of the county is mountainous, particularly the western area adjoining the industrial South Wales Valleys and the Black Mountains which form part of the Brecon Beacons National Park. Two major river valleys dominate the lowlands: the scenic gorge of the Wye Valley along the border with Gloucestershire adjoining the Forest of Dean, and the valley of the River Usk between Abergavenny and Newport. Both rivers flow south to the Severn Estuary. The River Monnow is a tributary of the River Wye and forms part of the border with Herefordshire and England, passing through the town of Monmouth. The highest point of the county is Chwarel y Fan in the Black Mountains, with a height of . The Sugar Loaf (Welsh: &quot;Mynydd Pen-y-fâl or Y Fâl&quot;), located northwest of Abergavenny, offers far-reaching views; although its height is only , its isolation and distinctive peak shape make it a prominent landmark.

Wentwood, now partly in Monmouthshire and partly in Newport, is the remnant of a once much larger forest, but remains the largest ancient woodland in Wales and the ninth largest in Britain. Originally a woodland, it formed the hunting ground for Chepstow Castle, and gave its name to a traditional north-south, division of the county between the &quot;cantrefi&quot; (hundreds) of &quot;Gwent Uwchcoed&quot; (above the wood) and &quot;Gwent Iscoed&quot; (below the wood).

===Geology===
The centre of the principal area is dominated by the Usk Inlier, a large outcrop of Silurian rock. The inlier is surrounded by younger, Devonian, rock, including areas of Old Red Sandstone which forms a very common building material in the county. The Wye Gorge, in the extreme east of the county, has a bed of Carboniferous Limestone.

===Coastline and landscape===

Monmouth&#x27;s coastline forms its southern border, running the length of the Severn Estuary from Chepstow in the east to the shore south of Magor in the west. The distance, roughly , can be walked via the Wales Coast Path. The coastline includes the eastern part of the Caldicot and Wentloog Levels, also known as the Monmouthshire or Gwent Levels, an almost entirely man-made environment that has seen land reclamation since Roman times. The coastal area is low-lying with few cliffs, making it historically vulnerable to flooding. An extreme example were the 1607 Bristol Channel floods which saw some 2,000 people drowned, with many victims located on Monmouthshire&#x27;s coastline.

Denny Island, a outcrop of rock in the Severn Estuary, the southern foreshore of which is the boundary between England and Wales, is Monmouthshire&#x27;s only offshore island.

===Biodiversity===

The battle to save Magor Marsh, the last remaining area of natural fenland on the Gwent Levels, led to the foundation of the Gwent Wildlife Trust. The county contains a range of nature reserves and areas of special scientific interest, including Graig Wood SSSI, Pentwyn Farm Grasslands SSSI and Lady Park Wood National Nature Reserve (). Llandegfedd Reservoir, developed in the 1960s to provide a water supply to Cardiff, is an SSSI providing overwintering for wildfowl. The Wye Valley, the county&#x27;s only National Landscape, has its largest population of deer and the UK&#x27;s largest population of lesser horseshoe bats. The Wye itself was once one of the country&#x27;s major centres of salmon fishing, but this has suffered very rapid decline in the 21st century due to river pollution.

==Governance, politics and public services==

===Local governance===

The current unitary authority of Monmouthshire was created on 1 April 1996 as a successor to the district of Monmouth along with the Llanelly community from Blaenau Gwent, both of which were districts of Gwent. It is a principal area of Wales. Monmouthshire is styled as a county, and includes: the former boroughs of Abergavenny and Monmouth; the former urban districts of Chepstow and Usk; the former rural districts of Abergavenny, Chepstow and Monmouth; the former rural district of Pontypool, except the community of Llanfrechfa Lower; and the parish of Llanelly from the former Crickhowell Rural District in Brecknockshire. 

The county is administered by Monmouthshire County Council, with its head office at Rhadyr, outside Usk, opened in 2013. In the 2022 Monmouthshire County Council election, no party gained overall control, with the Welsh Labour party forming a minority administration, its 22 councillors allying with five Independents and one Green Party councillor. The council leader is Mary Ann Brocklesby.

===National representation===
Monmouthshire elects one member to the UK parliament at Westminster, until 2024 representing the Monmouth constituency. Under the 2023 Periodic Review of Westminster constituencies, a new constituency, Monmouthshire, came into effect at the 2024 general election, comprising 88.9% of the previous constituency. The seat was won by the Labour Party candidate Catherine Fookes who defeated the incumbent, David T. C. Davies, a Conservative Party politician who had held the previous seat since 2005 and who served as the Secretary of State for Wales in the prior government. 

Monmouthshire directly elects two members to the Senedd, the Welsh parliament. The Monmouth constituency covers most of the county and since May 2021 the directly elected member is Peter Fox, a Conservative Party politician who previously served as the chair of Monmouthshire County Council. The western edge of the county, bordering Newport and including the settlements of Magor, Undy, Rogiet and Caldicot, forms part of the Newport East constituency which has John Griffiths of Labour as its member.

Monmouth is also one of eight constituencies in the South Wales East electoral region, which elects four additional members, under a partial proportional representation system.

===Public services===
Fire and rescue services are provided by South Wales Fire and Rescue Service, which has fire stations in the county at Abergavenny, Caldicot, Chepstow, Monmouth and Usk. Policing services are provided by Gwent Police, whose officers cover Monmouthshire, as well as Blaenau Gwent, Caerphilly, Newport and Torfaen. Civilian oversight is provided by the Gwent Police and Crime Commissioner. Monmouthshire&#x27;s prisons are HM Prison Prescoed, a Category D open prison at Coed-y-paen and HM Prison Usk, a Category C prison, both in the west of the county.

==Demography==
===Population===
Monmouthshire&#x27;s population was 93,000 at the 2021 census, increasing marginally from 91,300 at the 2011 census. 54,100 (58.2 per cent) of residents were born in Wales, while 32,300 (34.7 per cent) were born in England. Just over 20 per cent of the county&#x27;s population is over the age of 65. It remains one of the least densely-populated of Wales&#x27;s principal areas.

===Language, ethnicity and identity===
The 2021 census recorded that Welsh is spoken by 8.7 per cent of the population of the county, a decrease from 9.9 per cent in 2011. The number of non-Welsh speakers increased by 3,000 over the decade. In 2021, 96.9 per cent of Monmouthshire residents identified as &quot;white European&quot;, marginally lower than in 2011, compared with 98 per cent for the whole of Wales. 41.9 per cent of the population identified as &quot;Welsh&quot;, down from 44.0% in 2011. The percentage of residents in Monmouthshire that identified as &quot;British only&quot; increased from 23.5% to 27.0%.

===Religion===
In the 2021 census 43.4 per cent of Monmouthshire residents reported having &quot;No religion&quot;, an increase of nearly 15 per cent from the 28.5 per cent in the 2011 census. 48.7 per cent described themselves as &quot;Christian&quot; with the remainder reporting themselves as Buddhist (0.4 percent); Hindu (0.2 per cent); Jewish (0.1 per cent); Muslim (0.5 per cent); Sikh (0.1 per cent) or Other (0.6 per cent). The Diocese of Monmouth, within the Church in Wales, serves the area covered by the historic county, and its bishop, from 2019 Cherry Vann, is based at Newport.

==Economy==
===Employment===

Monmouthshire is now primarily a service economy, with professional, scientific and technical businesses, financial services, IT and business administration, retail, hospitality and arts and entertainment businesses accounting for just over 50 per cent of the total number of enterprises in the county. Firms are generally small, with 91 per cent of businesses employing fewer than 10 people. It is a relatively prosperous county in comparison with the average in Wales; 80.0 per cent of people of working age are in employment compared with the Welsh average of 72.8 per cent; just under 3,000 people were in receipt of the main unemployment benefit, a substantially lower number than in all of the adjoining principal areas; average annual earnings in 2020 were just over £41,000 compared to just over £32,000 in Wales as a whole. Total income tax payments from the county in 2013 were second only to the City of Cardiff, and the average individual payment exceeded that paid in the capital city. Agriculture continues to be an important employer, accounting for 15.3 per cent of businesses, the second largest single sector after professional, scientific and technical enterprises. The Monmouthshire Show, an annual agricultural show, is one of the largest such events in Wales and has operated since 1790. The third largest individual employment sector is construction.

===Transport===
====Road====

The only motorways are in the south of the county: the M4 which connects Wales with England via the Prince of Wales Bridge with its Welsh end near Sudbrook; and the M48, originally part of the M4, which links Wales with England via the Severn Bridge at Chepstow. In the east of the county, the A449 and the A40 link with the M50 near Goodrich, Herefordshire, connecting Monmouthshire and South Wales with the English Midlands. The conversion of the A465 road from Abergavenny to Dowlais into a dual carriageway was completed in the mid-2020s, after being proposed in the 1990s. Despite major cost overruns, it is considered to have brought benefits to the area. The Department for Transport recorded traffic in Monmouthshire at 0.9 billion vehicle miles in 2022. This represented a lower level of road usage than in 2016.

====Rail====
Monmouthshire is served by four railway stations: in the south are the Severn Tunnel Junction railway station at Rogiet on the South Wales Main Line, which connects South Wales to London; and Chepstow railway station and Caldicot railway station on the Gloucester–Newport line; and in the north, Abergavenny railway station on the Welsh Marches line.

====Bus services====
The county&#x27;s main centres of population are served by a bus network, connecting Abergavenny, Monmouth, Chepstow, Raglan and Usk, with stopping points at smaller settlements on route. National coach services have stopping points at Monmouth and Chepstow.

====Waterways====

In its industrial heyday in the 18th and 19th centuries, the eastern periphery of the South Wales Coalfield was served by the Monmouthshire and Brecon Canal which connected the coalfield with the port at Newport. Today, the canal is a popular route for leisure cruising but most of its length lies within the principal areas of Torfaen, Blaenau Gwent and Newport. The Monmouthshire villages of Gilwern, Govilon and Goetre, on the western extremity of the county, remain adjacent to the canal.

===Tourism===
Tourism remains an important element of the county&#x27;s economy. It generated just under £245 million in income in 2019, from 2.28 million visitors. The sector also provides employment for over 3,000 inhabitants of the county, approximately 10 per cent of the total working population.

==Education and health==

===Higher, further, secondary, primary and special education===

The county has neither a university nor any satellite campus. The former University of Wales, Newport operated a campus at Caerleon which closed in 2016, following the 2013 merger which created the University of South Wales. Higher education courses in the county are provided through the campus of Coleg Gwent at Rhadyr, near Usk.

There are four maintained secondary schools in the county, Caldicot School, serving the south of the county; Monmouth Comprehensive School serving the east; Chepstow School, serving the town of Chepstow and the surrounding villages; and King Henry VIII 3–19 School in Abergavenny, serving the town and the north of the county. All have sixth-forms. There was one special school, Mounton House School, based at Mounton House near Chepstow, but that closed in 2020 and, as at 2024, there is no specific special school provision. There are 30 primary schools of which two are Welsh language medium. There are no full Welsh language medium secondary schools, although all offer the option of studying Welsh. The only independent secondary provision in the county is Haberdashers&#x27; Monmouth School, formed in 2024 from an amalgamation of Monmouth School for Boys and Monmouth School for Girls, and operated by the Haberdashers&#x27; Company.

===Health services===
The Aneurin Bevan University Health Board is the Local health board for Gwent within NHS Wales and has responsibility for health care within the county. The largest hospital in the county is the Nevill Hall Hospital at Abergavenny. Its range of services has reduced following the opening of the specialist critical care centre at the Grange University Hospital in Torfaen in 2020. The Grange is also the designated trauma centre for Gwent, which covers Monmouthshire. The Well-being of Future Generations (Wales) Act 2015 established Public Services Boards throughout Wales to oversee health and well-being, and following reorganisation in 2021 a Gwent public services board was created to have oversight for Monmouthshire, Blaenau Gwent, Caerphilly, Newport and Torfaen.

==Culture==

===Flag===
The flag of Monmouthshire was officially adopted in 2011. It features three gold fleur-de-lis on a black/blue background.

===Built and landscape heritage===

Monmouthshire has 2,428 listed buildings, including 54 at Grade I, the highest grade, and 246 at Grade II*, the next highest grade. These include churches, a priory and an abbey, and several castles. The journalist Simon Jenkins notes the county&#x27;s &quot;fine collection&quot; of these, mostly dating from the Norman invasion of Wales, and describes Chepstow as &quot;the glory of medieval south Wales&quot;. The castle at Raglan is later, dating from the mid-fifteenth century. The fortified bridge over the River Monnow at Monmouth is the only remaining fortified river bridge in the country with its gate tower standing on the bridge, and has been described as &quot;arguably the finest surviving medieval bridge in Britain&quot;. Monmouthshire has a more &quot;modest&quot; range of churches, although that at Bettws Newydd has &quot;perhaps the most complete rood arrangement remaining in any church in England and Wales&quot;. The county&#x27;s Grade I listed abbey, at Tintern, became a focal point of the Wye Tour in the late-eighteenth century. The county has 48 registered historic landscapes including five at Grade I and nine at Grade II*.

===Sport and leisure===

Monmouthshire has rugby union clubs at Abergavenny and Monmouth, and an invitational county team, Monmouthshire County RFC. It has football clubs at Abergavenny, Caldicot, Chepstow and Monmouth. The football clubs play in the Ardal Leagues and the Gwent County League. Monmouthshire County Cricket Club was established in the 19th century and achieved a notable victory in 1858 when a Monmouthshire XXII beat an All-England XI at a match on Newport Marshes. The club suffered financial difficulties in the 1930s and merged with Glamorgan County Cricket Club in 1934. Monmouthshire has a rowing tradition on the River Wye, with the Monmouth Rowing Club, founded in 1928, and all three of the town&#x27;s secondary schools having their own rowing clubs. 

Chepstow Racecourse hosts the Coral Welsh Grand National, the richest thoroughbred horse racing event in Wales. The Rolls of Monmouth Golf Club at Rockfield is ranked in the 50 top courses in Wales, while the St Pierre course in the south of the county hosted the Epson Grand Prix of Europe and the British Masters in the late 20th century.

Monmouthshire has some major caving sites. Ogof Draenen, at Pwll Du in the north west of the county, is the longest cave system in Wales, and the second-longest in Great Britain. Its full extent was identified by members of the Morgannwg Caving Club in 1994. In the south of the county, underneath Chepstow Racecourse, Otter Hole is considered one of the best decorated caves in the country.

Several long-distance footpaths pass through the county, including the Marches Way, the Three Castles Walk, Offa&#x27;s Dyke Path, the Usk Valley Walk, the Monnow Valley Walk and the Wye Valley Walk. Chepstow is a terminus for two long-distance cycle routes which form part of the National Cycle Network: National Cycle Route 8 which runs from either Chepstow or Cardiff in the south to Holyhead in the north, and the Celtic Trail cycle route which runs east to west, from Chepstow to Fishguard.

===Cuisine===
The cuisine of Monmouthshire traditionally focused on its local produce, including lamb and mutton from sheep farming in the hillier north of the county, poultry and game. Lady Llanover, (bardic name &quot;Gwenynen Gwent&quot; — &quot;the bee of Gwent&quot;), was an early champion of Welsh culture and cuisine; her &quot;First Principles of Good Cookery&quot;, published in 1867, was one of the first Welsh cookery books. The contemporary writer, Gilli Davies, in her study of Welsh food, &quot;Tastes of Wales&quot;, writes of the &quot;rare and appealing quality to the food in Monmouthshire&quot;. The county has a small viniculture industry, with vineyards at Ancre Hill Estates, north of Monmouth; White Castle vineyard near Abergavenny, and the Tintern Parva vineyard in the Wye Valley. There are two Michelin starred restaurants in Monmouthshire, The Walnut Tree at Llanddewi Skirrid, in the north of the county and The Whitebrook at Whitebrook in the east. Abergavenny Food Festival is held annually each September. Established in 1991, it has been described as one of Britain&#x27;s best food and produce events.

===Media, the arts and local history===

Monmouthshire has three local newspapers, the &quot;Abergavenny Chronicle&quot;, the &quot;Forest of Dean and Wye Valley Review&quot; and the &quot;Monmouthshire Beacon&quot;. All are published by Tindle, a regional media group. Digital reporting is provided by the Monmouthshire Free Press Series. Sunshine Radio (Herefordshire and Monmouthshire) is the only local radio station, although it is based in Hereford. Rockfield Studios is a major residential recording studio which has seen bands and artists such as Coldplay, Oasis and the Manic Street Preachers record material. Queen recorded most of &quot;Bohemian Rhapsody&quot; at Rockfield in 1975.

There are two theatres in Monmouthshire, the Borough Theatre in Abergavenny, and the Savoy Theatre, Monmouth. Operated by a charitable trust, the Savoy claims to be the oldest theatre in Wales. Museums of local life are located at Abergavenny, Chepstow, Usk and Monmouth. During the closure of the Monmouth museum in 2020-2021 in the COVID-19 pandemic, the council announced that the museum would not re-open and that its collections, including an important assemblage of memorabilia related to Horatio Nelson, 1st Viscount Nelson donated to the town by Georgiana, Lady Llangattock, would be relocated to the Shire Hall. The museum&#x27;s Market Hall site would be redeveloped for commercial use. The council intends to complete the transfer by 2027. The Monmouth Regimental Museum, located at Great Castle House in Monmouth, contains material related to the Royal Monmouthshire Royal Engineers.

In 2012, the launch of Monmouthpedia, a project to use QRpedia QR codes to provide multilingual smart phone access to Wikipedia articles on notable subjects in the area, saw Monmouth described as the &quot;world&#x27;s first Wikipedia town&quot;.

==Historiography==

The development of tourism in the late 18th century saw the writing of a number of histories of the area, which frequently combined the features of a guidebook with a more formal historical approach. Among the first was William Gilpin&#x27;s &quot;Observations&quot;, published in 1782. Among the most notable was William Coxe&#x27;s two-volume &quot;An Historical Tour in Monmouthshire&quot;, published in 1801. Coxe&#x27;s preface explains the tour&#x27;s genesis: &quot;The present work owes its origin to an accidental excursion in Monmouthshire, in company with my friend Sir Richard Hoare, during the autumn of 1798.&quot; A detailed county history was undertaken by Sir Joseph Bradney, in his &quot;A History of Monmouthshire from the Coming of the Normans into Wales down to the Present Time&quot;, published over a period of 30 years in the early 20th century. 

Studies of the architecture of the county include John Newman&#x27;s &quot;Gwent/Monmouthshire&quot; volume of the Pevsner Buildings of Wales series; and, most exhaustively, Sir Cyril Fox and Lord Raglan&#x27;s three-volume study, &quot;Monmouthshire Houses&quot;. This was described by the architectural historian Peter Smith, author of the magisterial &quot;Houses of the Welsh Countryside&quot;, as &quot;one of the most remarkable studies of vernacular architecture yet made in the British Isles, a landmark, in its own field, as significant as Darwin&#x27;s &quot;Origin of Species&quot;&quot;.

The 20th century saw the publication of two lesser histories: Hugo Tyerman and Sydney Warner&#x27;s &quot;Monmouthshire&quot; volume of Arthur Mee&#x27;s &quot;The King&#x27;s England&quot; series in 1951; and Arthur Clark&#x27;s two-volume &quot;The Story of Monmouthshire&quot;, published in 1979–1980. The history of the county was covered in more anecdotal form by the Monmouthshire writer and artist Fred Hando, who chronicled the highways and byways of the county in some 800 newspaper articles written from the 1920s until his death in 1970 and published in the South Wales Argus, focusing on &quot;the little places of a shy county&quot;. The 21st century saw the publication of the county&#x27;s most important history, the five-volume &quot;Gwent County History&quot;. The series, modelled on the Victoria County History and with Ralph A. Griffiths as editor-in-chief, was published by the University of Wales Press between 2004 and 2013 and covered the history of the county from prehistoric times to the 21st century.

<text>Celina González Zamora (16 March 1929 – 4 February 2015) was a Cuban singer-songwriter, who specialized in &quot;música campesina&quot;, traditional music of the Cuban countryside. She is best known for co-authoring &quot;A Santa Bárbara&quot; with her partner Reutilio Domínguez. Her recording of it was a hit, as was Celia Cruz&#x27;s version. González and Domínguez wrote &quot;Yo soy el punto cubano&quot;: the recording was a hit in many countries throughout the world.

González was born in Jovellanos, Matanzas. At age 16, she met Reutilio Domínguez in Santiago de Cuba. He became her singing partner and husband, resulting in a collaboration that lasted until his death in Guantanamo in 1971. In 1948 they began working with the famous guitarist and singer Ñico Saquito and gained increasing popularity on radio, film and television. They performed in New York with Beny Moré and Barbarito Diez. In 1964 the duo stopped performing together and González continued as a soloist. In later years she sang with her son Lázaro, and was usually accompanied by the conjunto &quot;Campo Alegre&quot;. 

Initially, her music was mainly that of the European countryside guajiro (peasant), with lyrics based on the poetics of décima. The musical form was often that of the punto cubano. The relationship with Ñico Saquito taught her a great deal about the son and the guaracha, and her later work made frequent use of those forms.

In 1980 she won Egrem&#x27;s &quot;Disco de Plata&quot; award for the album &quot;Celina&quot;. This was the first of many awards. In 1984 she was awarded the &quot;Vanguardia Nacional&quot; for her artistic work and won a trip to the Soviet Union and Bulgaria with her son. In 1984 she won the award for Best Singer at the 27th International Music Festival in Cali, Colombia, and after a successful tour in Europe in 1988 she recorded a session for the BBC. 

Albums &quot;La rica cosecha&quot; and &quot;Desde La Habana te traigo&quot; were well received, and she was nominated, unsuccessfully, for a Grammy in 2001 in the &#x27;Best Traditional Tropical Latin Album&#x27; category, for her CD &quot;Cincuenta años... como una reina&quot;. The album won instead the &quot;Cubadisco&quot; award for the same year. She died on 4 February 2015, aged 85 in her homeland Cuba.

<text>The Apache ( ) are several Southern Athabaskan language–speaking peoples of the Southwest, the Southern Plains and Northern Mexico. They are linguistically related to the Navajo. They migrated from the Athabascan homelands in the north into the Southwest between 1000 and 1500 CE.

Apache bands include the Chiricahua, Jicarilla, Lipan, Mescalero, Mimbreño, Salinero, Plains, and Western Apache (Aravaipa, Pinaleño, Coyotero, and Tonto). Today, Apache tribes and reservations are headquartered in Arizona, New Mexico, Texas, and Oklahoma, while in Mexico the Apache are settled in Sonora, Chihuahua, Coahuila and areas of Tamaulipas. Each tribe is politically autonomous.

Historically, the Apache homelands have consisted of high mountains, sheltered and watered valleys, deep canyons, deserts, and the southern Great Plains, including areas in what is now Eastern Arizona, Northern Mexico (Sonora and Chihuahua) and New Mexico, West Texas, and Southern Colorado. These areas are collectively known as Apacheria.

The Apache tribes fought the invading Spanish and Mexican peoples for centuries. The first Apache raids on Sonora appear to have taken place during the late 17th century. In 19th-century confrontations during the American Indian Wars, the U.S. Army found the Apache to be fierce warriors and skillful strategists.

==Contemporary tribes==

Federally recognized Apache tribes are:

# Apache Tribe of Oklahoma
# Fort Sill Apache Tribe of Oklahoma, Oklahoma
# Fort McDowell Yavapai Nation, Arizona 
# Jicarilla Apache Nation, New Mexico
# Mescalero Apache Tribe of the Mescalero Reservation, New Mexico
# San Carlos Apache Tribe of the San Carlos Reservation, Arizona
# Tonto Apache Tribe of Arizona
# White Mountain Apache Tribe of the Fort Apache Reservation, Arizona
# Yavapai-Apache Nation of the Camp Verde Indian Reservation, Arizona

The Jicarilla are headquartered in Dulce, New Mexico, while the Mescalero are headquartered in Mescalero, New Mexico. The Western Apache, located in Arizona, is divided into several reservations, which crosscut cultural divisions. The Western Apache reservations include the Fort Apache Indian Reservation, San Carlos Apache Indian Reservation, Camp Verde Indian Reservation, and Tonto-Apache Reservation.

The Chiricahua were divided into two groups after they were released from being prisoners of war. The majority moved to the Mescalero Reservation and formed, with the larger Mescalero political group, the Mescalero Apache Tribe of the Mescalero Reservation, along with the Lipan Apache. The other Chiricahua are enrolled in the Fort Sill Apache Tribe of Oklahoma, headquartered in Apache, Oklahoma.

The Plains Apache are located in Oklahoma, headquartered around Anadarko, and are federally recognized as the Apache Tribe of Oklahoma.

The nine Apache tribes formed a nonprofit organization, the Apache Alliance. Tribal leaders convene at the Apache Alliance Summits, meetings hosted by a different Apache tribe each time. The member tribes are the Apache Tribe of Oklahoma, Fort McDowell Yavapai Nation, Fort Sill Apache Tribe, Jicarilla Apache Tribe, Mescalero Apache Tribe, San Carlos Apache Tribe, Tonto Apache Tribe, White Mountain Apache Tribe, Yavapai-Apache Nation, In 2021, &quot;Lipan Apaches were present&quot; at the summit.

== Name ==
Apaches first encountered European and African people, when they met conquistadors from the Spanish Empire, and thus the term &quot;Apache&quot; has its roots in the Spanish language. The Spanish first used the term (Navajo) in the 1620s, referring to people in the Chama region east of the San Juan River. By the 1640s, they applied the term to Southern Athabaskan peoples from the Chama on the east to the San Juan on the west. The ultimate origin is uncertain and lost to Spanish history.

The first known written record in Spanish is by in 1598. The most widely accepted origin theory suggests &quot;Apache&quot; was borrowed and transliterated from the Zuni word meaning &quot;Navajos&quot; (the plural of &quot;Navajo&quot;). J. P. Harrington reports that can also be used to refer to the Apache in general.

Another theory suggests the term comes from Yavapai meaning &quot;enemy&quot;. The Zuni and Yavapai sources are less certain because Oñate used the term before he had encountered any Zuni or Yavapai. A less likely origin may be from Spanish , meaning &quot;raccoon&quot;.

Modern Apache people use the Spanish term to refer to themselves and tribal functions, and so does the US government. However, Apache language speakers also refer to themselves and their people in the Apache term meaning &quot;person&quot; or &quot;people&quot;. A related Southern Athabascan–speaking tribe, the Navajo, refer to themselves as the .

The fame of the tribes&#x27; tenacity and fighting skills, probably bolstered by dime novels, was widely known among Europeans. In early 20th century Parisian society, the word &quot;Apache&quot; was adopted into French, essentially meaning an outlaw.

The term &quot;Apachean&quot; includes the related Navajo people.

=== Difficulties in naming ===

Many of the historical names of Apache groups that were recorded by non-Apache are difficult to match to modern-day tribes or their subgroups. Over the centuries, many Spanish, French and English-speaking authors did not differentiate between Apache and other semi-nomadic non-Apache peoples who might pass through the same area. Most commonly, Europeans learned to identify the tribes by translating their exonym, what another group whom the Europeans encountered first called the Apache peoples. Europeans often did not learn what the peoples called themselves, their s.

While anthropologists agree on some traditional major subgrouping of Apaches, they have often used different criteria to name finer divisions, and these do not always match modern Apache groupings. Some scholars do not consider groups residing in what is now Mexico to be Apache. In addition, an Apache individual has different ways of identification with a group, such as a band or clan, as well as the larger tribe or language grouping, which can add to the difficulties in an outsider comprehending the distinctions.

In 1900, the US government classified the members of the Apache tribe in the United States as Pinal Coyotero, Jicarilla, Mescalero, San Carlos, Tonto, and White Mountain Apache. The different groups were located in Arizona, New Mexico, and Oklahoma.

In the 1930s, the anthropologist Greenville Goodwin classified the Western Apache into five groups (based on his informants&#x27; views of dialect and cultural differences): White Mountain, Cibecue, San Carlos, North Tonto, and South Tonto. Since then, other anthropologists (e.g. Albert Schroeder) consider Goodwin&#x27;s classification inconsistent with pre-reservation cultural divisions. Willem de Reuse finds linguistic evidence supporting only three major groupings: White Mountain, San Carlos, and Dilzhe&#x27;e (Tonto). He believes San Carlos is the most divergent dialect, and that Dilzhe&#x27;e is a remnant, intermediate member of a dialect continuum that previously spanned from the Western Apache language to the Navajo.

John Upton Terrell classifies the Apache into western and eastern groups. In the western group, he includes Toboso, Cholome, Jocome, Sibolo or Cibola, Pelone, Manso, and Kiva or Kofa. He includes Chicame (the earlier term for Hispanized Chicano or New Mexicans of Spanish/Hispanic and Apache descent) among them as having definite Apache connections or names which the Spanish associated with the Apache.

In a detailed study of New Mexico Catholic Church records, David M. Brugge identifies 15 tribal names that the Spanish used to refer to the Apache. These were drawn from records of about 1,000 baptisms from 1704 to 1862.

== Tribes and bands ==
The list below is based on Foster and McCollough (2001), Opler (1983b, 1983c, 2001), and de Reuse (1983).

The term &quot;Apache&quot; refers to six major Apache-speaking groups: Chiricahua, Jicarilla, Lipan, Mescalero, Plains, and Western Apache. Historically, the term has also been applied to the Comanches, Mojaves, Hualapais, and Yavapais, none of whom speak Apache languages.

===Chiricahua – Mimbreño – Ndendahe===
* Chiricahua historically lived in Southeastern Arizona and Northern Sonora and Chihuahua. Chíshí (also Tchishi) is a Navajo word meaning &quot;Chiricahua, southern Apaches in general&quot;.
**Ch&#x27;úúkʾanén, true Chiricahua (Tsokanende, also Č&#x27;ók&#x27;ánéń, Č&#x27;ó·k&#x27;anén, Chokonni, Cho-kon-nen, Cho Kŭnĕ́, Chokonen) is the Eastern Chiricahua band identified by Morris Opler. The name is an autonym from the Chiricahua language.
**Gileño (also Apaches de Gila, Apaches de Xila, Apaches de la Sierra de Gila, Xileños, Gilenas, Gilans, Gilanians, Gila Apache, Gilleños) referred to several different Apache and non-Apache groups at different times. &quot;Gila&quot; refers to either the Gila River or the Gila Mountains. Some of the Gila Apaches were probably later known as the Mogollon Apaches, a Central Apache sub-band, while others probably coalesced into the Chiricahua proper. But, since the term was used indiscriminately for all Apachean groups west of the Rio Grande (i.e. in southeast Arizona and western New Mexico), the reference in historical documents is often unclear. After 1722, Spanish documents start to distinguish between these different groups, in which case &quot;Apaches de Gila&quot; refers to the Western Apache living along the Gila River (synonymous with &quot;Coyotero&quot;). American writers first used the term to refer to the Mimbres (another Central Apache subdivision).
*Mimbreño are the Tchihende, not a &quot;Chiricahua&quot; band but a central Apache division sharing the same language with the Chiricahua and the Mescalero divisions, the name being referred to a central Apache division improperly considered as a section of Opler&#x27;s &quot;&quot;Eastern Chiricahua&quot; band&quot;, and to Albert Schroeder&#x27;s &quot;Mimbres&quot;, or &quot;Warm Springs&quot; and &quot;Copper Mines&quot; &quot;Chiricahua&quot; bands in southwestern New Mexico.
** Copper Mines Mimbreño (also Coppermine) were located on upper reaches of Gila River, New Mexico, having their center in the Pinos Altos area. (See also &quot;Gileño&quot; and &quot;Mimbreño&quot;.)
** Warm Springs Mimbreño (also Warmspring) were located on upper reaches of Gila River, New Mexico, having their center in the Ojo Caliente area. (See also &quot;Gileño&quot; and &quot;Mimbreño&quot;.)
*Ndendahe were a division comprising the Bedonkohe (Mogollon) group and the Nedhni (Carrizaleño and Janero) group, incorrectly called, sometimes, &quot;Southern Chirichua&quot;.
**Mogollon was considered by Schroeder to be a separate pre-reservation Chiricahua band, while Opler considered the Mogollon to be part of his &quot;Eastern Chiricahua&quot; band in New Mexico. This is not be confused with the precontact Mogollon culture.
**Nedhni were the most southern group of the Central Apache, having their center in the Carrizal (Carrizaleño) and Janos (Janero) areas, in the Mexican state of Chihuahua.

===Jicarilla ===
The Jicarilla primarily live in Northern New Mexico and Southern Colorado. The term &quot;jicarilla&quot; comes from the Spanish word for &quot;little gourd.&quot;

* Carlana (also Sierra Blanca) is Raton Mesa in Southeastern Colorado. In 1726, they joined the Cuartelejo and Paloma, and by the 1730s, they lived with the Jicarilla. The Llanero band of the Jicarilla or the Dáchizh-ó-zhn Jicarilla (defined by James Mooney) might be descendants of the Carlana, Cuartelejo, and Paloma. Parts of the group were called Lipiyanes or Llaneros. In 1812, the term &quot;Carlana&quot; was used to mean Jicarilla. The Flechas de Palo might have been a part of or absorbed by the Carlana (or Cuartelejo).

=== Lipan ===
Lipan (Ypandes) primarily live in New Mexico today on the Mescalero Apache Reservation. Other Lipan Apache descendants merged with the Tonkawa tribe in Oklahoma. Historically, they moved from what is now the Southwest into the Southern Plains before 1650. In 1719, French explorer Jean Baptiste Bénard de La Harpe encountered the Lipan Apache near what is now Latimer County, Oklahoma. Some Lipan people were moved further east, into present day Louisiana, largely through enslavement of women &amp; children by Caddo tribes and French Settlers. Upon gaining their freedom, they settled in the same area, present day St. Martin (Prairie Marron) &amp; Lafayette Parishes (Bayou Tortue), along the Vermilion (aka &quot;Red&quot;) River. Two groups, &quot;Tcic n’ti óané&quot; (Trees Tall Standing People) &amp; &quot;Gocłic Łit’xuné&quot; (People of the Red Mud) merged to form the Canneci Tinné, who continue to occupy this territory.

They were mentioned in 1718 records as being near the newly established town of San Antonio, Texas. They expanded into Texas and south the Gulf of Mexico and Rio Grande. In the mid-18th century, some Lipan settled in and near Spanish missions in Texas. Clashes with Comanche forced them into southern Texas and northern Mexico.

Briefly in the late 1830s, the Lipan allied with the Republic of Texas; however, after Texas gained statehood in 1846, the Americans waged a brutal campaign against the Lipan, destroying Lipan villages and trying to force them from Texas. Most were forced onto the Mescalero Reservation and some went to Oklahoma.

* Pelones (&quot;Bald Ones&quot;) lived far from San Antonio and far to the northeast of the Ypandes near the Red River of the South of North-Central Texas, although able to field 800 warriors, more than the &quot;Ypandes&quot; and &quot;Natagés&quot; together, they were described as less warlike because they had fewer horses than the Plains Lipan, their population were estimated between 1,600 and 2,400 persons, were the &quot;Forest Lipan&quot; division (&quot;Chishį́į́hį́į́&quot;, &quot;Tcici&quot;, &quot;Tcicihi&quot; – &quot;People of the Forest&quot;, after 1760 the name Pelones was never used by the Spanish for any Texas Apache group, the Pelones had fled for the Comanche south and southwest, but never mixed up with the Plains Lipan division – retaining their distinct identity, so that Morris Opler was told by his Lipan informants in 1935 that their tribal name was &quot;People of the Forest&quot;)

=== Mescalero ===
Mescaleros primarily live in Eastern New Mexico.

*Faraones (also Fahanos, Apaches Faraone, Paraonez, Pharaones, Taraones, or Taracones) is derived from Spanish &quot;Faraón&quot; meaning &quot;Pharaoh.&quot; Before 1700, the name was vague. Between 1720 and 1726, it referred to Apache between the Rio Grande, the Pecos River, the area around Santa Fe, and the Conchos River. After 1726, &quot;Faraones&quot; only referred to the groups of the north and central parts of this region. The Faraones like were part of the modern-day Mescalero or merged with them. After 1814, the term &quot;Faraones&quot; disappeared and was replaced by &quot;Mescalero&quot;.
*Sierra Blanca Mescaleros were a northern Mescalero group from the Sierra Blanca Mountains, who roamed in what is now eastern New Mexico and western Texas.
*Sacramento Mescaleros were a northern Mescalero group from the Sacramento and Organ Mountains, who roamed in what is now eastern New Mexico and western Texas.
*Guadalupe Mescaleros. were a northern Mescalero group from the Guadalupe Mountains, who roamed in what is now eastern New Mexico and western Texas.
*Limpia Mescaleros were a southern Mescalero group from the Limpia Mountains (later named as Davis Mountains) and roamed in what is now eastern New Mexico and western Texas.
*Natagés (also &quot;Natagees&quot;, &quot;Apaches del Natafé&quot;, &quot;Natagêes&quot;, &quot;Yabipais Natagé&quot;, &quot;Natageses&quot;, &quot;Natajes&quot;) is a term used from 1726 to 1820 to refer to the Faraón, Sierra Blanca, and Siete Ríos Apaches of southeastern New Mexico. In 1745, the Natagé are reported to have consisted of the Mescalero (around El Paso and the Organ Mountains) and the Salinero (around Rio Salado), but these were probably the same group, were oft called by the Spanish and Apaches themselves &quot;true Apaches&quot;, had had a considerable influence on the decision making of some bands of the Western Lipan in the 18th century. After 1749, the term became synonymous with Mescalero, which eventually replaced it.

=== Plains Apache ===
Plains Apache (Kiowa-Apache, Naisha, Naʼishandine) are headquartered in Southwest Oklahoma. Historically, they followed the Kiowa. Other names for them include Ná&#x27;įįsha, Ná&#x27;ęsha, Na&#x27;isha, Na&#x27;ishandine, Na-i-shan-dina, Na-ishi, Na-e-ca, Ną&#x27;ishą́, Nadeicha, Nardichia, Nadíisha-déna, Na&#x27;dí&#x27;į́shą́ʼ, Nądí&#x27;įįshąą, and Naisha.

* Querechos referred to by Coronado in 1541, possibly Plains Apaches, at times maybe Navajo. Other early Spanish might have also called them Vaquereo or Llanero.

=== Western Apache ===
Western Apache include Northern Tonto, Southern Tonto, Cibecue, White Mountain, and San Carlos groups. While these subgroups spoke the same language and had kinship ties, Western Apaches considered themselves as separate from each other, according to Goodwin. Other writers have used this term to refer to all non-Navajo Apachean peoples living west of the Rio Grande (thus failing to distinguish the Chiricahua from the other Apacheans). Goodwin&#x27;s formulation: &quot;all those Apache peoples who have lived within the present boundaries of the state of Arizona during historic times with the exception of the Chiricahua, Warm Springs, and allied Apache, and a small band of Apaches known as the Apache Mansos, who lived in the vicinity of Tucson.&quot;

*Cibecue is a Western Apache group, according to Goodwin, from north of the Salt River between the Tonto and White Mountain Apache, consisting of Ceder Creek, Carrizo, and Cibecue (proper) bands.
* San Carlos. A Western Apache group that ranged closest to Tucson according to Goodwin. This group consisted of the Apache Peaks, Arivaipa, Pinal, San Carlos (proper) bands.
**Arivaipa (also Aravaipa) is a band of the San Carlos Apache. Schroeder believes the Arivaipa were a separate people in pre-reservation times. &quot;Arivaipa&quot; is a Hispanized word from the O&#x27;odham language. The Arivaipa are known as &quot;Tsézhiné&quot; (&quot;Black Rock&quot;) in the Western Apache language.
** Pinal (also &quot;Pinaleño&quot;). One of the bands of the San Carlos group of Western Apache, described by Goodwin. Also used along with &quot;Coyotero&quot; to refer more generally to one of two major Western Apache divisions. Some Pinaleño were referred to as the &quot;Gila Apache&quot;.
* Tonto. Goodwin divided into Northern Tonto and Southern Tonto groups, living in the north and west areas of the Western Apache groups according to Goodwin. This is north of Phoenix, north of the Verde River. Schroeder has suggested that the Tonto are originally Yavapais who assimilated Western Apache culture. Tonto is one of the major dialects of the Western Apache language. Tonto Apache speakers are traditionally bilingual in Western Apache and Yavapai. Goodwin&#x27;s Northern Tonto consisted of Bald Mountain, Fossil Creek, Mormon Lake, and Oak Creek bands; Southern Tonto consisted of the Mazatzal band and unidentified &quot;semi-bands&quot;.
* White Mountain are the easternmost group of the Western Apache, according to Goodwin, who included the Eastern White Mountain and Western White Mountain Apache.
**Coyotero refers to a southern pre-reservation White Mountain group of the Western Apache, but has also been used more widely to refer to the Apache in general, Western Apache, or an Apache band in the high plains of Southern Colorado to Kansas.

===Other terms===
*Llanero is a Spanish-language borrowing meaning &quot;plains dweller&quot;. The name referred to several different groups who hunted buffalo on the Great Plains. (See also &quot;Carlanas&quot;.)
* Lipiyánes (also Lipiyán, Lipillanes). A coalition of splinter groups of Nadahéndé (Natagés), Guhlkahéndé, and Lipan of the 18th century under the leadership of Picax-Ande-Ins-Tinsle (&quot;Strong Arm&quot;), who fought the Comanche on the Plains. This term is not to be confused with &quot;Lipan&quot;.

==History==

===Entry into the Southwest===
The Apache and Navajo speak related languages of the Athabaskan language family. Other Athabaskan-speaking people in North America continue to reside in Alaska, western Canada, and the Northwest Pacific Coast. Anthropological evidence suggests that the Apache and Navajo peoples lived in these same northern locales before migrating to the Southwest sometime between AD 1200 and 1500.

The Apaches&#x27; nomadic way of life complicates accurate dating, primarily because they constructed less substantial dwellings than other Southwestern groups. Since the early 21st century, substantial progress has been made in dating and distinguishing their dwellings and other forms of material culture. They left behind a more austere set of tools and material goods than other Southwestern cultures.

The Athabaskan-speaking group probably moved into areas that were concurrently occupied or recently abandoned by other cultures. Other Athabaskan speakers, perhaps including the Southern Athabaskan, adapted many of their neighbors&#x27; technology and practices into their own cultures. Thus sites where early Southern Athabaskans may have lived are difficult to locate and even more difficult to firmly identify as culturally Southern Athabaskan. Recent advances have been made in the regard in the far southern portion of the American Southwest.

There are several hypotheses about Apache migrations. One posits that they moved into the Southwest from the Great Plains. In the mid-16th century, these mobile groups lived in tents, hunted bison and other game, and used dogs to pull travois loaded with their possessions. Substantial numbers of the people and a wide range were recorded by the Spanish in the 16th century.

In April 1541, while traveling on the plains east of the Pueblo region, Francisco Coronado referred to the people as &quot;dog nomads.&quot; He wrote:


The Spanish described Plains dogs as very white, with black spots, and &quot;not much larger than water spaniels.&quot; Plains dogs were slightly smaller than those used for hauling loads by modern Inuit and northern First Nations people in Canada. Recent experiments show these dogs may have pulled loads up to 50 pounds (20 kg) on long trips, at rates as high as two or three miles per hour (3 to 5 km/h). The Plains migration theory associates the Apache peoples with the Dismal River culture, an archaeological culture known primarily from ceramics and house remains, dated 1675–1725, which has been excavated in Nebraska, eastern Colorado, and western Kansas.

Although the first documentary sources mention the Apache, and historians have suggested some passages indicate a 16th-century entry from the north, archaeological data indicate they were present on the plains long before this first reported contact.

A competing theory posits their migration south, through the Rocky Mountains, ultimately reaching the American Southwest by the 14th century or perhaps earlier. An archaeological material culture assemblage identified in this mountainous zone as ancestral Apache has been referred to as the &quot;Cerro Rojo complex&quot;. This theory does not preclude arrival via a plains route as well, perhaps concurrently, but to date the earliest evidence has been found in the mountainous Southwest. The Plains Apache have a significant Southern Plains cultural influence.

When the Spanish arrived in the area, trade between the long-established Pueblo peoples and the Southern Athabaskan was well established. They reported the Pueblo exchanged maize and woven cotton goods for bison meat, and hides and materials for stone tools. Coronado observed the Plains people wintering near the Pueblo in established camps. Later Spanish sovereignty over the area disrupted trade between the Pueblo and the diverging Apache and Navajo groups. The Apache quickly acquired horses, improving their mobility for quick raids on settlements. In addition, the Pueblo were forced to work Spanish mission lands and care for mission flocks; they had fewer surplus goods to trade with their neighbors.

In 1540, Coronado reported that the modern Western Apache area was uninhabited, although some scholars have argued that he simply did not see the American Indians. Other Spanish explorers first mention &quot;Querechos&quot; living west of the Rio Grande in the 1580s. To some historians, this implies the Apaches moved into their current Southwestern homelands in the late 16th and early 17th centuries. Other historians note that Coronado reported that Pueblo women and children had often been evacuated by the time his party attacked their dwellings, and that he saw some dwellings had been recently abandoned as he moved up the Rio Grande. This might indicate the semi-nomadic Southern Athabaskan had advance warning about his hostile approach and evaded encounter with the Spanish. Archaeologists are finding ample evidence of an early proto-Apache presence in the Southwestern mountain zone in the 15th century and perhaps earlier. The Apache presence on both the Plains and in the mountainous Southwest indicate that the people took multiple early migration routes.

===Conflict with Mexico and the United States===

In general, the recently arrived Spanish colonists, who settled in villages, and Apache bands developed a pattern of interaction over a few centuries. Both raided and traded with each other. Records of the period seem to indicate that relationships depended on the specific villages and bands: a band might be friends with one village and raid another. When war occurred, the Spanish would send troops; after a battle both sides would &quot;sign a treaty&quot; and go home.

The traditional and sometimes treacherous relationships continued after the independence of Mexico in 1821. By 1835 Mexico had placed a bounty on Apache scalps (see scalping), but certain villages still traded with some bands. When Juan José Compà, the leader of the Copper Mines Mimbreño Apaches, was killed for bounty money in 1837, &quot;Mangas Coloradas&quot; (Red Sleeves) or &quot;Dasoda-hae&quot; (He just sits there) became the principal chief and war leader; also in 1837 Soldado Fiero (a.k.a. Fuerte), leader of the Warm Springs Mimbreño Apaches, was killed by Mexican soldiers near Janos, and his son &quot;Cuchillo Negro&quot; (Black Knife) became the principal chief and war leader. They (being now Mangas Coloradas the first chief and Cuchillo Negro the second chief of the whole Tchihende or Mimbreño people) conducted a series of retaliatory raids against the Mexicans. By 1856, authorities in horse-rich Durango would claim that Indian raids (mostly Comanche and Apache) in their state had taken nearly 6,000 lives, abducted 748 people, and forced the abandonment of 358 settlements over the previous 20 years.

When the United States went to war against Mexico in 1846, many Apache bands promised U.S. soldiers safe passage through their lands. When the U.S. claimed former territories of Mexico in 1846, &quot;Mangas Coloradas&quot; signed a peace treaty with the nation, respecting them as conquerors of the Mexicans&#x27; land. An uneasy peace with U.S. citizens held until the 1850s. An influx of gold miners into the Santa Rita Mountains led to conflict with the Apache. This period is sometimes called the Apache Wars.

The United States&#x27; concept of a reservation had not been used by the Spanish, Mexicans or other Apache neighbors before. Reservations were often badly managed, and bands that had no kinship relationships were forced to live together. No fences existed to keep people in or out. It was common for a band to be allowed to leave for a short period of time. Other times a band would leave without permission, to raid, return to their homeland to forage, or to simply get away. The U.S. military usually had forts nearby to keep the bands on the reservations by finding and returning those who left. The reservation policies of the U.S. caused conflict and war with the various Apache bands who left the reservations for almost another quarter century.

War between the Apaches and Euro-Americans has led to a stereotypical focus on certain aspects of Apache cultures. These have often been distorted through misunderstanding of their cultures, as noted by anthropologist Keith Basso:

===Forced removal===
In 1875, United States military forced the removal of an estimated 1,500 Yavapai and Dilzhe&#x27;e Apache (better known as &quot;Tonto Apache&quot;) from the Rio Verde Indian Reserve and its several thousand acres of treaty lands promised to them by the United States government. At the orders of Indian Commissioner L. E. Dudley, U.S. Army troops made the people, young and old, walk through winter-flooded rivers, mountain passes and narrow canyon trails to get to the Indian Agency at San Carlos, away. The trek killed several hundred people. The people were interned there for 25 years while white settlers took over their land. Only a few hundred ever returned to their lands. At the San Carlos reservation, the Buffalo soldiers of the 9th Cavalry Regiment—replacing the 8th Cavalry who were being stationed to Texas—guarded the Apaches from 1875 to 1881.

Beginning in 1879, an Apache uprising against the reservation system led to Victorio&#x27;s War between Chief Victorio&#x27;s band of Apaches and the 9th Cavalry.

===Defeat===
Most United States&#x27; histories of this era report that the final defeat of an Apache band took place when 5,000 US troops forced Geronimo&#x27;s group of 30 to 50 men, women and children to surrender on September 4, 1886, at Skeleton Canyon, Arizona. The Army sent this band and the Chiricahua scouts who had tracked them to military confinement in Florida at Fort Pickens and, subsequently, Ft. Sill, Oklahoma.

Many books were written on the stories of hunting and trapping during the late 19th century. Many of these stories involve Apache raids and the failure of agreements with Americans and Mexicans. In the post-war era, the US government arranged for Apache children to be taken from their families for adoption by white Americans in assimilation programs.

==Pre-reservation culture==

===Social organization===
All Apache peoples lived in extended family units (or &quot;family clusters&quot;); they usually lived close together, with each nuclear family in separate dwellings. An extended family generally consisted of a husband and wife, their unmarried children, their married daughters, their married daughters&#x27; husbands, and their married daughters&#x27; children. Thus, the extended family is connected through a lineage of women who live together (that is, matrilocal residence), into which men may enter upon marriage (leaving behind his parents&#x27; family).

When a daughter married, a new dwelling was built nearby for her and her husband. Among the Navajo, residence rights are ultimately derived from a head mother. Although the Western Apache usually practiced matrilocal residence, sometimes the eldest son chose to bring his wife to live with his parents after marriage. All tribes practiced sororate and levirate marriages.

Apache men practiced varying degrees of &quot;avoidance&quot; of his wife&#x27;s close relatives, a practice often most strictly observed by distance between mother-in-law and son-in-law. The degree of avoidance differed by Apache group. The most elaborate system was among the Chiricahua, where men had to use indirect polite speech toward and were not allowed to be within visual sight of the wife&#x27;s female relatives, whom he had to avoid. His female Chiricahua relatives through marriage also avoided him.

Several extended families worked together as a &quot;local group&quot;, which carried out certain ceremonies, and economic and military activities. Political control was mostly present at the local group level. Local groups were headed by a chief, an influential man with an impressive reputation. The position was not hereditary, and was often filled by members of different extended families. The chief&#x27;s influence was as strong as he was evaluated to be—no group member was obliged to follow the chief. Western Apache criteria for a good chief included: industriousness, generosity, impartiality, forbearance, conscientiousness, and eloquence in language.

Many Apache peoples joined several local groups into &quot;bands&quot;. Banding was strongest among the Chiricahua and Western Apache, and weak among the Lipan and Mescalero. The Navajo did not organize into bands, perhaps because of the requirements of the sheepherding economy. However, the Navajo did have &quot;the outfit&quot;, a group of relatives that was larger than the extended family, but smaller than a local group community or a band.

On a larger level, Western Apache bands organized into what Grenville Goodwin called &quot;groups&quot;. He reported five groups for the Western Apache: Northern Tonto, Southern Tonto, Cibecue, San Carlos, and White Mountain. The Jicarilla grouped their bands into &quot;moieties&quot;, perhaps influenced by the northeastern Pueblo. The Western Apache and Navajo also had a system of matrilineal &quot;clans&quot; organized further into &quot;phratries&quot; (perhaps influenced by the western Pueblo).

The notion of a tribe within Apache cultures is very weakly developed; essentially it was only a recognition &quot;that one owed a modicum of hospitality to those of the same speech, dress, and customs.&quot; The six Apache tribes had political independence from each other and even fought against each other. For example, the Lipan once fought against the Mescalero.

====Kinship systems====
The Apache tribes have two distinctly different kinship term systems: a &quot;Chiricahua type&quot; and a &quot;Jicarilla type&quot;. The Chiricahua-type system is used by the Chiricahua, Mescalero, and Western Apache. The Western Apache kinship system differs slightly from the other two but shares similarities with the Navajo system.

The Jicarilla type, which is similar to the Dakota–Iroquois kinship systems, is used by the Jicarilla, Navajo, Lipan, and Plains Apache. The Navajo system is more divergent among the four, having similarities with the Chiricahua-type system. The Lipan and Plains Apache systems are very similar.

=====Chiricahua=====
The Chiricahua language has four words for grandparent: &quot;-chú&quot; &quot;maternal grandmother&quot;, &quot;-tsúyé&quot; &quot;maternal grandfather&quot;, &quot;-chʼiné&quot; &quot;paternal grandmother&quot;, &quot;-nálé&quot; &quot;paternal grandfather&quot;. Additionally, a grandparent&#x27;s siblings are identified by the same word; thus, one&#x27;s maternal grandmother, one&#x27;s maternal grandmother&#x27;s sisters, and one&#x27;s maternal grandmother&#x27;s brothers are all called &quot;-chú&quot;. Furthermore, the grandchild terms are reciprocal, that is, one uses the same term to refer to their grandchild. For example, a person&#x27;s maternal grandmother is called &quot;-chú&quot; and that grandmother also calls that granddaughter &quot;-chú&quot; (i.e. &quot;-chú&quot; can mean the child of either your own daughter or your sibling&#x27;s daughter.)

Chiricahua cousins are not distinguished from siblings through kinship terms. Thus, the same word refers to either a sibling or a cousin (there are not separate terms for parallel-cousin and cross-cousin). The terms depend on the sex of the speaker (unlike the English terms &quot;brother&quot; and &quot;sister&quot;): &quot;-kʼis&quot; &quot;same-sex sibling or same-sex cousin&quot;, &quot;-´-ląh&quot; &quot;opposite-sex sibling or opposite-sex cousin&quot;. This means if one is a male, then one&#x27;s brother is called &quot;-kʼis&quot; and one&#x27;s sister is called &quot;-´-ląh&quot;. If one is a female, then one&#x27;s brother is called &quot;-´-ląh&quot; and one&#x27;s sister is called &quot;-kʼis&quot;. Chiricahuas in a &quot;-´-ląh&quot; relationship observed great restraint and respect toward that relative; cousins (but not siblings) in a &quot;-´-ląh&quot; relationship may practice total &quot;avoidance&quot;.

Two different words are used for each parent according to sex: &quot;-mááʼ&quot; &quot;mother&quot;, &quot;-taa&quot; &quot;father&quot;. Likewise, there are two words for a parent&#x27;s child according to sex: &quot;-yáchʼeʼ&quot; &quot;daughter&quot;, &quot;-gheʼ&quot; &quot;son&quot;.

A parent&#x27;s siblings are classified together regardless of sex: &quot;-ghúyé&quot; &quot;maternal aunt or uncle (mother&#x27;s brother or sister)&quot;, &quot;-deedééʼ&quot; &quot;paternal aunt or uncle (father&#x27;s brother or sister)&quot;. These two terms are reciprocal like the grandparent/grandchild terms. Thus, &quot;-ghúyé&quot; also refers to one&#x27;s opposite-sex sibling&#x27;s son or daughter (that is, a person will call their maternal aunt &quot;-ghúyé&quot; and that aunt will call them &quot;-ghúyé&quot; in return).

=====Jicarilla=====
Unlike the Chiricahua system, the Jicarilla have only two terms for grandparents according to sex: &quot;-chóó&quot; &quot;grandmother&quot;, &quot;-tsóyéé&quot; &quot;grandfather&quot;. They do not have separate terms for maternal or paternal grandparents. The terms are also used of a grandparent&#x27;s siblings according to sex. Thus, &quot;-chóó&quot; refers to one&#x27;s grandmother or one&#x27;s grand-aunt (either maternal or paternal); &quot;-tsóyéé&quot; refers to one&#x27;s grandfather or one&#x27;s grand-uncle. These terms are not reciprocal. There is a single word for grandchild (regardless of sex): &quot;-tsóyí̱í̱&quot;.

There are two terms for each parent. These terms also refer to that parent&#x27;s same-sex sibling: &quot;-ʼnííh&quot; &quot;mother or maternal aunt (mother&#x27;s sister)&quot;, &quot;-kaʼéé&quot; &quot;father or paternal uncle (father&#x27;s brother)&quot;. Additionally, there are two terms for a parent&#x27;s opposite-sex sibling depending on sex: &quot;-daʼá̱á̱&quot; &quot;maternal uncle (mother&#x27;s brother)&quot;, &quot;-béjéé&quot; &quot;paternal aunt (father&#x27;s sister).

Two terms are used for same-sex and opposite-sex siblings. These terms are also used for parallel-cousins: &quot;-kʼisé&quot; &quot;same-sex sibling or same-sex parallel cousin (i.e. same-sex father&#x27;s brother&#x27;s child or mother&#x27;s sister&#x27;s child)&quot;, &quot;-´-láh&quot; &quot;opposite-sex sibling or opposite parallel cousin (i.e. opposite-sex father&#x27;s brother&#x27;s child or mother&#x27;s sister&#x27;s child)&quot;. These two terms can also be used for cross-cousins. There are also three sibling terms based on the age relative to the speaker: &quot;-ndádéé&quot; &quot;older sister&quot;, &quot;-´-naʼá̱á̱&quot; &quot;older brother&quot;, &quot;-shdá̱zha&quot; &quot;younger sibling (i.e. younger sister or brother)&quot;. Additionally, there are separate words for cross-cousins: &quot;-zeedń&quot; &quot;cross-cousin (either same-sex or opposite-sex of speaker)&quot;, &quot;-iłnaaʼaash&quot; &quot;male cross-cousin&quot; (only used by male speakers).

A parent&#x27;s child is classified with their same-sex sibling&#x27;s or same-sex cousin&#x27;s child: &quot;-zhácheʼe&quot; &quot;daughter, same-sex sibling&#x27;s daughter, same-sex cousin&#x27;s daughter&quot;, &quot;-gheʼ&quot; &quot;son, same-sex sibling&#x27;s son, same-sex cousin&#x27;s son&quot;. There are different words for an opposite-sex sibling&#x27;s child: &quot;-daʼá̱á̱&quot; &quot;opposite-sex sibling&#x27;s daughter&quot;, &quot;-daʼ&quot; &quot;opposite-sex sibling&#x27;s son&quot;.

===Housing===
Apache lived in three types of houses. Tipis were common in the plains. Wickiups were common in the highlands; these were framed of wood held together with yucca fibers and covered in brush. If a family member died, the wickiup would be burned. Apache of the desert of northern Mexico lived in hogans, an earthen structure for keeping cool.

Below is a description of Chiricahua wickiups recorded by anthropologist Morris Opler:

Recent research has documented the archaeological remains of Chiricahua Apache wickiups as found on protohistoric and at historical sites, such as Canon de los Embudos where C. S. Fly photographed Geronimo, his people, and dwellings during surrender negotiations in 1886, demonstrating their unobtrusive and improvised nature.&quot;

===Food===
Apache people obtained food from hunting, gathering wild plants, cultivating domestic plants, trade, or raiding neighboring groups for livestock and agricultural projects.

Particular types of foods eaten by a group depending upon their respective environment.

====Hunting====
Hunting was done primarily by men, although there were sometimes exceptions depending on animal and culture (e.g. Lipan women could help in hunting rabbits and Chiricahua boys were also allowed to hunt rabbits).

Hunting often had elaborate preparations, such as fasting and religious rituals performed by medicine men before and after the hunt. In Lipan culture, since deer were protected by Mountain Spirits, great care was taken in Mountain Spirit rituals to ensure smooth hunting. Slaughter follows religious guidelines (many of which are recorded in religious stories) prescribing cutting, prayers, and bone disposal. Southern Athabascan hunters often distributed successfully slaughtered game. For example, among the Mescalero a hunter was expected to share as much as half of his kill with a fellow hunter and needy people at the camp. Feelings of individuals about this practice spoke of social obligation and spontaneous generosity.

The most common hunting weapon before the introduction of European guns was the bow and arrow. Various hunting techniques were used. Some involved wearing animal head masks as a disguise. Whistles were sometimes used to lure animals closer. Another technique was the relay method where hunters positioned at various points would chase the prey in turns in order to tire the animal. A similar method involved chasing the prey down a steep cliff.

Eating certain animals was taboo. Although different cultures had different taboos, common examples included bears, peccaries, turkeys, fish, snakes, insects, owls, and coyotes. An example of taboo differences: the black bear was a part of the Lipan diet (although less common as buffalo, deer, or antelope), but the Jicarilla never ate bear because it was considered an evil animal. Some taboos were a regional phenomenon, such as fish, which was taboo throughout the southwest (e.g. in certain Pueblo cultures like the Hopi and Zuni) and considered to resemble a snake (an evil animal) in physical appearance.

Western Apache hunted deer and pronghorns mostly in the ideal late fall. After the meat was smoked into jerky around November, they migrated from the farm sites in the mountains along stream banks to winter camps in the Salt, Black, Gila river and even the Colorado River valleys.

The Chiricahua mostly hunted deer followed by pronghorn. Lesser game included cottontail rabbits, opossums, squirrels, surplus horses, surplus mules, &quot;wapiti&quot; (elk), wild cattle and wood rats.

The Mescalero primarily hunted deer. Other game includes bighorn sheep, buffalo (for those living closer to the plains), cottontail rabbits, elk, horses, mules, opossums, pronghorn, wild steers, and wood rats. Beavers, minks, muskrats, and weasels were hunted for their hides but were not eaten.

The Jicarilla primarily hunted bighorn sheep, buffalo, deer, elk, and pronghorn. Other game included beaver, bighorn sheep, chief hares, chipmunks, doves, groundhogs, grouse, peccaries, porcupines, prairie dogs, quail, rabbits, skunks, snow birds, squirrels, turkeys and wood rats. Burros and horses were only eaten in emergencies. Minks, weasels, wildcats and wolves were not eaten but hunted for their body parts.

The Lipan ate mostly buffalo with a three-week hunt during the fall and smaller hunts until the spring. The second most utilized animal was deer. Fresh deer blood was drunk for health. Other animals included beavers, bighorns, black bears, burros, ducks, elk, fish, horses, mountain lions, mourning doves, mules, prairie dogs, pronghorns, quail, rabbits, squirrels, turkeys, turtles, and wood rats. Skunks were eaten only in emergencies.

Plains Apache hunters hunted primarily buffalo and deer. Other game included badgers, bears, beavers, fowl (including geese), opossums, otters, rabbits, and tortoises.

=== Clothing ===
Influenced by the Plains Indians, Western Apaches wore clothing sewn from animal hides decorated with seed beads for clothing. These beaded designs historically resembled that of the Great Basin Paiute and is characterized by linear patterning. Apache beaded clothing was bordered with narrow bands of glass seed beads in diagonal stripes of alternating colors. They made buckskin shirts, ponchos, skirts, and moccasins and decorated them with colorful beadwork.

===Undomesticated plants and other food sources===
The gathering of plants and other food was primarily done by women. The men&#x27;s job was usually to hunt animals such as deer, buffalo, and small game. However, men helped in certain gathering activities, such as of heavy agave crowns. Numerous plants were used as both food and medicine and in religious ceremonies. Other plants were used for only their religious or medicinal value.

In May, the Western Apache baked and dried agave crowns pounded into pulp and formed into rectangular cakes. At the end of June and beginning of July, saguaro, prickly pear, and cholla fruits were gathered. In July and August, mesquite beans, Spanish bayonet fruit, and Emory oak acorns were gathered. In late September, gathering was stopped as attention moved to harvesting cultivated crops. In late fall, juniper berries and pinyon nuts were gathered.

The most important plant food for the Chiricahua was the Century plant (also known as mescal or agave). The crowns (the tuberous base portion) were baked in large underground ovens and sun-dried. The shoots were also eaten. Other plants used by the Chiricahua include: agarita (or algerita) berries, alligator juniper berries, anglepod seeds, banana yucca (or datil, broadleaf yucca) fruit, chili peppers, chokecherries, cota (used for tea), currants, dropseed grass seeds, Gambel oak acorns, Gambel oak bark (used for tea), grass seeds (of various varieties), greens (of various varieties), hawthorne fruit, Lamb&#x27;s-quarters leaves, lip ferns (used for tea), live oak acorns, locust blossoms, locust pods, maize kernels (used for tiswin), and mesquite beans.

Also eaten were mulberries, narrowleaf yucca blossoms, narrowleaf yucca stalks, nipple cactus fruit, one-seed juniper berries, onions, pigweed seeds, pinyon nuts, pitahaya fruit, prickly pear fruit, prickly pear juice, raspberries, screwbean (or tornillo) fruit, saguaro fruit, spurge seeds, strawberries, sumac (&quot;Rhus trilobata&quot;) berries, sunflower seeds, tule rootstocks, tule shoots, pigweed tumbleweed seeds, unicorn plant seeds, walnuts, western yellow pine inner bark (used as a sweetener), western yellow pine nuts, whitestar potatoes (&quot;Ipomoea lacunosa&quot;), wild grapes, wild potatoes (&quot;Solanum jamesii&quot;), wood sorrel leaves, and yucca buds (unknown species). Other items include: honey from ground hives and hives found within agave, sotol, and narrowleaf yucca plants.

The abundant agave (mescal) was also important to the Mescalero, who gathered the crowns in late spring after reddish flower stalks appeared. The smaller sotol crowns were also important. The crowns of both plants were baked and dried. Other plants include: acorns, agarita berries, amole stalks (roasted and peeled), aspen inner bark (used as a sweetener), bear grass stalks (roasted and peeled), box elder inner bark (used as a sweetener), banana yucca fruit, banana yucca flowers, box elder sap (used as a sweetener), cactus fruits (of various varieties), cattail rootstocks, chokecherries, currants, dropseed grass seeds (used for flatbread), elderberries, gooseberries (&quot;Ribes leptanthum&quot; and &quot;R. pinetorum&quot;), grapes, hackberries, hawthorne fruit, and hops (used as condiment).

They also used horsemint (as a condiment), juniper berries, Lamb&#x27;s-quarters leaves, locust flowers, locust pods, mesquite pods, mint (as a condiment), mulberries, pennyroyal (as a condiment), pigweed seeds (for flatbread), pine inner bark (as a sweetener), pinyon pine nuts, prickly pear fruit (dethorned and roasted), purslane leaves, raspberries, sage (as a condiment), screwbeans, sedge tubers, shepherd&#x27;s purse leaves, strawberries, sunflower seeds, tumbleweed seeds (for flatbread), vetch pods, walnuts, western white pine nuts, western yellow pine nuts, white evening primrose fruit, wild celery (as a condiment), wild onion (as a condiment), wild pea pods, wild potatoes, and wood sorrel leaves.

The Jicarilla used acorns, chokecherries, juniper berries, mesquite beans, pinyon nuts, prickly pear fruit, yucca fruit, and many other kinds of fruits, acorns, greens, nuts, and seed grasses.

The Lipan heavily used agave (mescal) and sotol. Other plants include agarita, blackberries, cattails, devil&#x27;s claw, elderberries, gooseberries, hackberries, hawthorn, juniper, Lamb&#x27;s-quarters, locust, mesquite, mulberries, oak, palmetto, pecan, pinyon, prickly pears, raspberries, screwbeans, seed grasses, strawberries, sumac, sunflowers, Texas persimmons, walnuts, western yellow pine, wild cherries, wild grapes, wild onions, wild plums, wild potatoes, wild roses, yucca flowers, and yucca fruit. Other gathered food includes salt obtained from caves and honey.

The Plains Apache gathered chokecherries, blackberries, grapes, prairie turnips, wild onions, and wild plums, and many other fruits, vegetables, and tuberous roots.

====Ethnobotany====
A list of 198 ethnobotany plant uses for the Chiricahua can be found at http://naeb.brit.org/uses/tribes/11/, which also includes the Mescalero.

A list of 54 ethnobotany plant uses for the uncategorized Apache can also be found here. http://naeb.brit.org/uses/tribes/10/.

===Crop cultivation===
The Navajo practiced the most crop cultivation, the Western Apache, Jicarilla, and Lipan less. The one Chiricahua band (of Opler&#x27;s) and the Mescalero practiced very little cultivation. The other two Chiricahua bands and the Plains Apache did not grow any crops.

===Trade, raids, and war===
Interchanges between the Apache and European-descended explorers and settlers included trading. The Apache found they could use European and American goods.

Apaches distinguished raiding from war. Raiding was done in small parties with a specific economic purpose. War was waged in large parties (often clan members), usually to achieve retribution. Raiding was traditional for the Apache, but Mexican settlers objected to their stock being stolen. As tensions grew between the Apache and settlers, the Mexican government passed laws offering cash rewards for Apache scalps.

=== Religion ===

Apache religious stories relate to two culture heroes (one of the Sun/fire:&quot;Killer-Of-Enemies/Monster Slayer&quot;, and one of Water/Moon/thunder: &quot;Child-Of-The-Water/Born For Water&quot;) who destroy several creatures harmful to humankind.

Another story is of a hidden ball game, where good and evil animals decide whether or not the world should be forever dark. Coyote, the trickster, is an important being that often has inappropriate behavior (such as marrying his own daughter, etc.) in which he overturns social convention. The Navajo, Western Apache, Jicarilla, and Lipan have an emergence or Creation Story, while this is lacking in the Chiricahua and Mescalero.

Most Southern Athabascan gods are personified natural forces that run through the universe. They may be used for human purposes through ritual ceremonies. The following is a formulation by the anthropologist Keith Basso of the Western Apache&#x27;s concept of &quot;diyí&quot;&#x27;:

The term &quot;diyí&quot;&#x27; refers to one or all of a set of abstract and invisible forces that are said to derive from certain classes of animals, plants, minerals, meteorological phenomena, and mythological figures within the Western Apache universe. Any of the various powers may be acquired by man and, if properly handled, used for a variety of purposes.

Medicine men learn the ceremonies, which can also be acquired by direct revelation to the individual. Different Apache cultures had different views of ceremonial practice. Most Chiricahua and Mescalero ceremonies were learned through the transmission of personal religious visions, while the Jicarilla and Western Apache used standardized rituals as the more central ceremonial practice. Important standardized ceremonies include the puberty ceremony (Sunrise Dance) of young women, Navajo chants, Jicarilla &quot;long-life&quot; ceremonies, and Plains Apache &quot;sacred-bundle&quot; ceremonies.

Certain animals—owls, snakes, bears, and coyotes—are considered spiritually evil and prone to cause sickness to humans.

Many Apache ceremonies use masked representations of religious spirits. Sandpainting is an important ceremony in the Navajo, Western Apache, and Jicarilla traditions, in which healers create temporary, sacred art from colored sands. Anthropologists believe the use of masks and sandpainting are examples of cultural diffusion from neighboring Pueblo cultures.

The Apaches participate in many religious dances, including the rain dance, dances for the crop and harvest, and a spirit dance. These dances were mostly for influencing the weather and enriching their food resources.

== Population history ==
José de Urrutia estimated the Apache population in year 1700 at up to 60,000 people (or 12,000 warriors). Indian Affairs 1837 estimated the Apache population in 1837 at 20,280 people, this estimate was later repeated by official reports of Indian Affairs 1841 and 1844. In Indian Affairs 1857 &quot;every possible estimate&quot; has been gathered - from 18,000 warriors (which would indicate a total population of 90,000) down to 300. Many estimates did not include the whole body of the tribe and referred only to some bands or to a part of the area they roved over. In 1875 there were already on the reservations 9,248 Apaches (Indian Affairs 1875), this number does not include those who were still not on the reservations. The census of 1890 returned at least 7,218 (including 4,041 in Arizona) and the census of 1910 returned at least 6,119.

During the 20th and 21st centuries Apache population has rebounded, reaching 148,936 in the USA according to the 2020 census.

==Languages==

The five Apache languages are Apachean languages, which in turn belong to the Athabaskan branch of the Eyak-Athabaskan language family. All Apache languages are endangered. Lipan is reported extinct.

The Southern Athabascan branch was defined by Harry Hoijer primarily according to its merger of stem-initial consonants of the Proto-Athabascan series &#x27; and &#x27; into &#x27; (in addition to the widespread merger of &#x27; and &#x27; into &#x27; also found in many Northern Athabascan languages).

Hoijer (1938) divided the Apache sub-family into an eastern branch consisting of Jicarilla, Lipan, and Plains Apache and a Western branch consisting of Navajo, Western Apache (San Carlos), Chiricahua, and Mescalero based on the merger of Proto-Apachean &#x27; and &#x27; to &quot;k&quot; in the Eastern branch. Thus, as can be seen in the example below, when the Western languages have noun or verb stems that start with &quot;t&quot;, the related forms in the Eastern languages will start with a &quot;k&quot;:

He later revised his proposal in 1971 when he found that Plains Apache did not participate in the &quot;&quot; merger to consider Plains Apache as a language equidistant from the other languages, now called Southwestern Apachean. Thus, some stems that originally started with &quot;*k̯&quot; in Proto-Athabascan start with &quot;ch&quot; in Plains Apache while the other languages start with &quot;ts&quot;.

Morris Opler (1975) has noted cultural similarities of Jicarilla and Lipan with Eastern Apache language speakers and differences from Western Apache speakers, supporting Hojier&#x27;s initial classification. Other linguists, particularly Michael Krauss (1973), have noted that a classification based only on the initial consonants of noun and verb stems is arbitrary and when other sound correspondences are considered the relationships between the languages appear more complex.

Apache languages are tonal. Regarding tonal development, all Apache languages are &quot;low-marked&quot;, which means that stems with a &quot;constricted&quot; syllable rime in the proto-language developed low tone while all other rimes developed high tone. Other Northern Athabascan languages are &quot;high-marked&quot;: their tonal development is the reverse. In the example below, if low-marked Navajo and Chiricahua have a low tone, then the high-marked Northern Athabascan languages, Slavey and Chilcotin, have a high tone, and if Navajo and Chiricahua have a high tone, then Slavey and Chilcotin have a low tone.

<doc id="358590" wikidata="Q115652" url="?curid=358590" title="Antoine-Henri Jomini">
<text>Antoine-Henri Jomini (; 6 March 177922 March 1869) was a Swiss military officer who served as a general in French and later in Russian service, and one of the most celebrated writers on the Napoleonic art of war. Jomini was largely self-taught in military strategy, and his ideas are a staple at military academies, the United States Military Academy at West Point being a prominent example; his theories were thought to have affected many officers who later served in the American Civil War. He may have coined the term &quot;logistics&quot; in his &quot;Summary of the Art of War&quot; (1838).

==Early life and business career==
Jomini was born on 6 March 1779 in Payerne, Vaud, Switzerland, to Benjamin Jomini and Jeanne Marcuard. The Jominis were an old Swiss family, and both his father and paternal grandfather served as mayor of Payerne. In his youth, Jomini &quot;was fascinated by soldiers and the art of war,&quot; and hoped to join the military, but his parents pushed him towards a career in business. As a result, Jomini entered a business school in Aarau at the age of 14.

In April 1795, Jomini left school and went to work at the banking house of Monsieurs Preiswerk in Basel. In 1796, he moved to Paris, where he worked first at the Mosselmann banking house and then as a stockbroker. After a short time in banking, however, &quot;Jomini convinced himself that the tedious life of a banker was not to be compared with the life afforded in the French Army&quot; and decided to become a military officer as soon as he found an opportunity.

==Swiss Army==
In 1798, at time of the establishment of the Helvetic Republic, Jomini was an eager revolutionary and an associate of Frédéric-César de La Harpe. He soon found a position in the new Swiss government as a secretary for the Minister of War with the rank of captain. In 1799, after being promoted to the rank of major, Jomini took responsibility for reorganizing the operations of the ministry. In that capacity, he standardized many procedures, and used his position &quot;to experiment with organizational systems and strategies&quot;.

After the Peace of Lunéville in 1801, Jomini returned to Paris, where he worked for a military equipment manufacturer. He found the job uninteresting and spent most of his time preparing his first book on military theory: &quot;Traité des grandes operations militaires&quot; (Treatise on Major Military Operations). Michel Ney, one of Napoleon&#x27;s top generals, read the book in 1803 and subsidized its publication. The book appeared in several volumes from 1804 to 1810 and was &quot;quickly translated and widely discussed&quot; throughout Europe.

==Service in the Napoleonic Wars==

===French Army===
Jomini served in the 1805 campaign by serving on Ney&#x27;s staff. Jomini fought with Ney at the Battle of Ulm and in December of that year, he was offered a commission as a colonel in the French Army.

In 1806, Jomini published his views as to the conduct of the impending war with Prussia. That, along with his knowledge of Frederick the Great&#x27;s campaigns, which Jomini had described in the &quot;Traité&quot;, led Napoleon to attach him to his own headquarters. Jomini was present with Napoleon at the Battle of Jena and at the Battle of Eylau, where he won the cross of the Legion of Honour.

After the Peace of Tilsit, Jomini was made chief of the staff to Ney and as well as a baron. In the Spanish campaign of 1808, his advice was often of the highest value to the marshal, but Jomini quarreled with his chief, and he was left almost at the mercy of his numerous enemies, especially Louis Alexandre Berthier, the emperor&#x27;s chief of staff.

===Russian Army===
Overtures had been made to him, as early as 1807, to enter the Russian service, but Napoleon, hearing of his intention to leave the French army, compelled him to remain in the service with the rank of general of brigade. For some years thereafter, Jomini held both a French and a Russian commission, with the consent of both sovereigns. However, when war between France and Russia broke out, he was in a difficult position, which he dealt with by taking a noncombat command on the line of communication.

Jomini was thus engaged when the retreat from Moscow and the uprising of Prussia transferred the seat of war to central Germany. He promptly rejoined Ney and took part in the Battle of Lützen. As chief of the staff of Ney&#x27;s group of corps, he rendered distinguished services before and at the Battle of Bautzen. For this he was recommended for the rank of general of division. Berthier, however, not only erased Jomini&#x27;s name from the list but also put him under arrest and censured him in army orders for failing to supply certain staff reports that had been called for. How far Jomini was responsible for certain misunderstandings that prevented the attainment of all the results hoped for from Ney&#x27;s attack at Bautzen is unknown. However, the pretext for censure was in Jomini&#x27;s own view trivial and baseless, and during the armistice Jomini did as he had intended to do in 1809–1810 and went into the Russian service.

That move was seen as tantamount to deserting to the enemy, and was regarded as such by many in the French army and by some of his new comrades. This was despite Jomini&#x27;s holding for years a dormant commission in the Russian army, and that he had declined to take part in the invasion of Russia in 1812. More importantly, a point that Napoleon commented upon, was the fact that he was a Swiss citizen, not a Frenchman.

His Swiss patriotism was indeed strong, and he withdrew from the Allied Army in 1814 when he found that he could not prevent the Allies&#x27; violation of Swiss neutrality. Apart from love of his own country, the desire to study, to teach and to practice the art of war were his ruling motives. At the critical moment of the battle of Eylau, he had exclaimed, &quot;If I were the Russian commander for two hours!&quot; On joining the allies, he received the rank of lieutenant-general and the appointment of &quot;aide-de-camp&quot; from the tsar and rendered important assistance during the German campaign: an accusation that he had betrayed the numbers, positions and intentions of the French to the enemy was later acknowledged by Napoleon to be without foundation. As a Swiss patriot and as a French officer, he declined to take part in the passage of the Rhine at Basel and the subsequent invasion of France.

In 1815, he was with Tsar Alexander in Paris and attempted to save the life of his old commander Ney. The defense of Ney almost cost Jomini his position in the Russian service. He succeeded, however, in overcoming the resistance of his enemies and took part in the Congress of Vienna.

==Postwar service and retirement==
After several years of retirement and literary work, Jomini resumed his post in the Russian army, and in about 1823, he was made a full general. Until his retirement in 1829 he was principally employed in the military education of the Tsarevich Nicholas (afterwards Emperor) and in the organization of the Russian staff college, which was established in 1832 and bore its original name of the Nicholas Academy up to the October Revolution of 1917. In 1828 he was employed in the field in the Russo-Turkish War, and at the Siege of Varna he was awarded the Grand Cordon of the Alexander Order.

That was his last active service. In 1829, he settled in Brussels, which served as his main place of residence for the next thirty years. In 1853, after trying without success to bring about a political understanding between France and Russia, Jomini was called to St Petersburg to act as a military adviser to the Tsar during the Crimean War. He returned to Brussels upon the conclusion of peace in 1856. Later, he settled at Passy near Paris. He was busily employed up to the end of his life in writing treatises, pamphlets and open letters on subjects of military art and history. In 1859, he was asked by Napoleon III to furnish a plan of campaign for the Franco-Austrian War. One of his last essays dealt with the Austro-Prussian War of 1866 and the influence of the breech-loading rifle. He died at Passy only a year before the Franco-Prussian War of 1870–71.

==Writings and influence==

Jomini&#x27;s military writings are frequently analyzed: he took a didactic, prescriptive approach, reflected in a detailed vocabulary of geometric terms such as bases, strategic lines, and key points. His operational prescription was fundamentally simple: put superior combat power at the decisive point. In the famous theoretical Chapter 25 of the &quot;Traité de grande tactique&quot;, he stressed the exclusive superiority of interior lines.

As one writer rather partial to Carl von Clausewitz, Jomini&#x27;s great competitor in the field of military theory, put it:

Jomini was no fool, however. His intelligence, facile pen, and actual experience of war made his writings a great deal more credible and useful than so brief a description can imply. Once he left Napoleon&#x27;s service, he maintained himself and his reputation primarily through prose. His writing style—unlike Clausewitz&#x27;s—reflected his constant search for an audience. He dealt at length with a number of practical subjects (logistics, seapower) that Clausewitz had largely ignored. Elements of his discussion (his remarks on Great Britain and seapower, for instance, and his sycophantic treatment of Austria&#x27;s Archduke Charles) are clearly aimed at protecting his political position or expanding his readership. And, one might add, at minimizing Clausewitz&#x27;s, for he clearly perceived the Prussian writer as his chief competitor. For Jomini, Clausewitz&#x27;s death thirty-eight years prior to his own came as a piece of rare good fortune.

Jomini took the view that the amount of force deployed should be kept to the minimum in order to lower casualties and that war was not an exact science. Specifically, Jomini stated in his book:

War in its ensemble is NOT a science, but an art. Strategy, particularly, may indeed be regulated by fixed laws resembling those of the positive sciences, but this is not true of war viewed as a whole. Among other things, combats may be mentioned as often being quite independent of scientific combinations, and they may become essentially dramatic, personal qualities and inspirations and a thousand other things frequently being the controlling elements. The passions which agitate the masses that are brought into collision, the warlike qualities of these masses, the energy and talent of their commanders, the spirit, more or less martial, of nations and epochs,—in a word, every thing that can be called the poetry and metaphysics of war,—will have a permanent influence on its results.

While in Russian service, Jomini tried hard to promote a more scientific approach at the general staff academy he helped to found.

Prior to the American Civil War, the translated writings of Jomini were the only works on military strategy that were taught at the United States Military Academy at West Point. His ideas, as taught by Professor Dennis Hart Mahan permeated the Academy and shaped the basic military thinking of its graduates.

The regular army officers who became the general officers for both the Union and the Confederacy in the Civil War began by following Jominian principles. However, the British historian John Keegan argues, in &quot;The American Civil War&quot;, that the peculiarities of American geography, particularly as pursued by Ulysses S. Grant and William T. Sherman in the Western Theater of the American Civil War, forced them to move beyond his geometric conventions and find other strategic solutions to the problems that confronted them.

<doc id="358597" wikidata="Q1501262" url="?curid=358597" title="Ommatidium">
<text>The compound eyes of arthropods like insects, crustaceans and millipedes are composed of units called ommatidia (: ommatidium). An ommatidium contains a cluster of photoreceptor cells surrounded by support cells and pigment cells. The outer part of the ommatidium is overlaid with a transparent cornea. Each ommatidium is innervated by one axon bundle (usually consisting of 6–9 axons, depending on the number of rhabdomeres) and provides the brain with one picture element. The brain forms an image from these independent picture elements. The number of ommatidia in the eye depends upon the type of arthropod and range from as low as 5 as in the Antarctic isopod &quot;Glyptonotus antarcticus&quot;, or a handful in the primitive Zygentoma, to around 30,000 in larger Anisoptera dragonflies and some Sphingidae moths.

==Description==
Ommatidia are typically hexagonal in cross-section and approximately ten times longer than wide. The diameter is largest at the surface, tapering toward the inner end. At the outer surface, there is a cornea, below which is a pseudocone that further focuses the light. The cornea and pseudocone form the outer ten percent of the length of the ommatidium.

The specific organ of ommatidia, or eye units, vary between different organisms. The butterfly compound eye consists of multiple ommatidia, each of which consist of nine photoreceptor cells (numbered from R1–R9), and primary and secondary pigment cells. Nymphalid butterflies have the simplest eye ommatidium structure, consisting of eight photoreceptor cells (R1–R8) and a tiny R9 cell organized into a different tier. These &quot;R cells&quot; tightly pack the ommatidium. The portion of the R cells at the central axis of the ommatidium collectively form a light guide, a transparent tube, called the rhabdom.

Although composed of over 16,000 cells, the &quot;Drosophila&quot; compound eye is a simple repetitive pattern of 700 to 750 ommatidia, initiated in the larval eye imaginal disc. Each ommatidium consists of 14 neighboring cells: 8 photoreceptor neurons in the core, 4 non-neuronal cone cells and 2 primary pigment cells. A hexagonal lattice of pigment cells insulates the ommatidial core from neighboring ommatidia to optimize coverage of the visual field, which therefore affects the acuity of &quot;Drosophila&quot; vision.

==Rhabdomeres==
In true flies, the rhabdom has separated into seven independent rhabdomeres (there are actually eight, but the two central rhabdomeres responsible for color vision sit one atop the other), such that a small inverted 7-pixel image is formed in each ommatidium. The angle between adjacent rhabdomeres within a single ommatidium (the &quot;acceptance angle&quot;) is similar to the angle between adjacent ommatidia (the &quot;inter-ommatidial angle&quot;), giving the eye a continuous field of view with areas of overlap between neighboring ommatidia; the advantage of this arrangement is that the same visual axis is sampled from a larger area of the eye, increasing overall sensitivity by a factor of seven, without increasing the size of the eye or reducing its acuity. Achieving this has also required the rewiring of the eye such that the axon bundles are twisted through 180 degrees (re-inverted), and each rhabdomere is united with those from the six adjacent ommatidia that share the same visual axis. Thus, at the level of the lamina – the first optical processing center of the insect brain – the signals are input in exactly the same manner as in the case of a normal apposition compound eye, but the image is enhanced. This visual arrangement is known as &quot;neural superposition&quot;.

Since an image from the compound eye is created from the independent picture elements produced by ommatidia, it is important for the ommatidia to react only to that part of the scene directly in front of them. To prevent light entering at an angle from being detected by the ommatidium it entered, or by any of the neighboring ommatidia, six pigment cells are present. The pigment cells line the outside of each ommatidium. Pigment cells are located at an ommatidium&#x27;s vertices, thus each pigment cell lines the outside of three mutually-adjacent ommatidia. Light entering at an angle passes through the thin cross-section of the photoreceptor cell, with only a tiny chance of exciting it, and is absorbed by the pigment cell, before it can enter a neighboring ommatidium. In many species, in low-light situations, the pigment is withdrawn, so that light entering the eye might be detected by any of several ommatidia. This enhances light detection but lowers resolution.

The size of the ommatidia varies according to species, but ranges from 5 to 50 micrometres. The rhabdoms within them may cross-section at least as small as 1.x micrometres, the category of &quot;small&quot; being assigned in some cross-species studies to those under 2 micrometers. A microlens array can be seen as an elementary, biomimetic analogy of ommatidia.

== Mechanism of eye determination ==
Retinal cell fate determination relies on positional cell–cell signaling that activates signal transduction pathways, rather than cell lineage. Cell–cell signal that is released from R8 photoreceptors (already differentiated retinal cells) of each ommatidium is received by neighboring progenitor retinal cells, stimulating their incorporation into developing ommatidia. The undifferentiated retinal cells select their appropriate cell fates based on their position with their differentiated neighbors. The local signal, Growth Factor Spitz, activates the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signal transduction pathway, and initiates a cascade of events that will result in transcription of genes involved in cell fate determination. This process leads to the induction of cell fates, starting from the R8 photoreceptor neurons and progresses to the sequential recruitment of neighboring undifferentiated cells. The first seven neighboring cells receive R8 signaling to differentiate as photoreceptor neurons, followed by the recruitment of the four non-neuronal cone cells.

<text>Polar Trappers is a 1938 Donald Duck and Goofy cartoon set in the South Pole, where the duo are trapping polar animals (or at least, attempting to). This is the first of the six short films of the &quot;Donald &amp; Goofy&quot; series, as well as the first cartoon where Donald Duck and Goofy appear without Mickey Mouse.

==Plot==
Goofy is setting up an animal trap while Donald is in an igloo preparing a meal. Donald explains how sick he is of eating beans all the time, and, while noticing a penguin outside, he hatches a plan while thinking of the penguin as roast chicken. The rest of the cartoon deals with him trying to lure a large group of penguins into his pot while Goofy is stuck trying desperately to catch a walrus.

The name of Donald&#x27;s and Goofy&#x27;s trapping business is &quot;Donald &amp; Goofy Trapping Co&quot;. Their slogan is &quot;We Bring &#x27;Em Back Alive&quot;. This is Donald&#x27;s first time encountering penguins, but it is not his last. The music played while Donald leads the penguins is the instrumental piece &quot;March of the Toys&quot;, from the operetta &quot;Babes in Toyland&quot;, also known as &quot;Parade Of The Tin Soldiers&quot;.

When a baby penguin&#x27;s tear turned into a snowball, after being kicked out of the march angrily by Donald after the small penguin kept on getting in front of him and the fact that Donald doesn&#x27;t want to cook the small penguin due to its size, the other penguins notice the snowball coming and quickly dived into the snow for safety, but Donald runs for his life. When he gets into a collision with Goofy, they both run for their lives until they get caught in the snowball, and fall on their workplace, completely destroying it. Donald and Goofy are then seen in the cages they brought for the animals they plan to catch, and a can of beans falls into Donald&#x27;s mouth, making him grumble in anger when the short ends.

<text>Science studies is an interdisciplinary research area that seeks to situate scientific expertise in broad social, historical, and philosophical contexts. It uses various methods to analyze the production, representation and reception of scientific knowledge and its epistemic and semiotic role.

Similarly to cultural studies, science studies are defined by the subject of their research and encompass a large range of different theoretical and methodological perspectives and practices. The interdisciplinary approach may include and borrow methods from the humanities, natural and formal sciences, from scientometrics to ethnomethodology or cognitive science. 

Science studies have a certain importance for evaluation and science policy. Overlapping with the field of science, technology and society, practitioners study the relationship between science and technology, and the interaction of expert and lay knowledge in the public realm.

== Scope ==
The field started with a tendency toward navel-gazing: it was extremely self-conscious in its genesis and applications. From early concerns with scientific discourse, practitioners soon started to deal with the relation of scientific expertise to politics and lay people. Practical examples include bioethics, bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), pollution, global warming, biomedical sciences, physical sciences, natural hazard predictions, the (alleged) impact of the Chernobyl disaster in the UK, generation and review of science policy and risk governance and its historical and geographic contexts. While staying a discipline with multiple metanarratives, the fundamental concern is about the role of the perceived expert in providing governments and local authorities with information from which they can make decisions.

The approach poses various important questions about what makes an expert and how experts and their authority are to be distinguished from the lay population and interacts with the values and policy making process in liberal democratic societies.

Practitioners examine the forces within and through which scientists investigate specific phenomena such as
* technological milieus, epistemic instruments and cultures and laboratory life (compare Karin Knorr-Cetina, Bruno Latour, Hans-Jörg Rheinberger)
* science and technology (e.g. Wiebe Bijker, Trevor Pinch, Thomas P. Hughes)
* science, technology and society (e.g. Peter Weingart, Ulrike Felt, Helga Nowotny and Reiner Grundmann)
* language and rhetoric of science (e.g. Charles Bazerman, Alan G. Gross, Greg Myers)
* aesthetics of science and visual culture in science (u.a. Peter Geimer), the role of aesthetic criteria in scientific practice (compare mathematical beauty) and the relation between emotion, cognition and rationality in the development of science.
* semiotic studies of creative processes, as in the discovery, conceptualization, and realization of new ideas. or the interaction and management of different forms of knowledge in cooperative research. 
* large-scale research and research institutions, e.g. particle colliders (Sharon Traweek)
* research ethics, science policy, and the role of the university.

== History of the field ==
In 1935, in a celebrated paper, the Polish sociologist couple Maria Ossowska and Stanisław Ossowski proposed the founding of a &quot;science of science&quot; to study the scientific enterprise, its practitioners, and the factors influencing their work. Earlier, in 1923, the Polish sociologist Florian Znaniecki had made a similar proposal. 

Fifty years before Znaniecki, in 1873, Aleksander Głowacki, better known in Poland by his pen name &quot;Bolesław Prus&quot;, had delivered a public lecture – later published as a booklet – &quot;On Discoveries and Inventions&quot;, in which he said:

It is striking that, while early 20th-century sociologist proponents of a discipline to study science and its practitioners wrote in general theoretical terms, Prus had already half a century earlier described, with many specific examples, the scope and methods of such a discipline.

Thomas Kuhn&#x27;s &quot;Structure of Scientific Revolutions&quot; (1962) increased interest both in the history of science and in science&#x27;s philosophical underpinnings. Kuhn posited that the history of science was less a linear succession of discoveries than a succession of paradigms within the philosophy of science. Paradigms are broader, socio-intellectual constructs that determine which types of truth claims are permissible. 

Science studies seeks to identify key dichotomies – such as those between science and technology, nature and culture, theory and experiment, and science and fine art – leading to the differentiation of scientific fields and practices. 

The sociology of scientific knowledge arose at the University of Edinburgh, where David Bloor and his colleagues developed what has been termed &quot;the strong programme&quot;. It proposed that both &quot;true&quot; and &quot;false&quot; scientific theories should be treated the same way. Both are informed by social factors such as cultural context and self-interest. 

Human knowledge, abiding as it does within human cognition, is ineluctably influenced by social factors.

It proved difficult, however, to address natural-science topics with sociological methods, as was abundantly evidenced by the US science wars. Use of a deconstructive approach (as in relation to works on arts or religion) to the natural sciences risked endangering not only the &quot;hard facts&quot; of the natural sciences, but the objectivity and positivist tradition of sociology itself. The view on scientific knowledge production as a (at least partial) social construct was not easily accepted. Latour and others identified a dichotomy crucial for modernity, the division between nature (things, objects) as being transcendent, allowing to detect them, and society (the subject, the state) as immanent as being artificial, constructed. The dichotomy allowed for mass production of things (technical-natural hybrids) and large-scale global issues that endangered the distinction as such. E.g. &quot;We Have Never Been Modern&quot; asks to reconnect the social and natural worlds, returning to the pre-modern use of &quot;thing&quot;—addressing objects as hybrids made and scrutinized by the public interaction of people, things, and concepts.

Science studies scholars such as Trevor Pinch and Steve Woolgar started already in the 1980s to involve &quot;technology&quot;, and called their field &quot;science, technology and society&quot;. This &quot;turn to technology&quot; brought science studies into communication with academics in science, technology, and society programs.

More recently, a novel approach known as mapping controversies has been gaining momentum among science studies practitioners, and was introduced as a course for students in engineering, and architecture schools. In 2002 Harry Collins and Robert Evans asked for a third wave of science studies (a pun on &quot;The Third Wave&quot;), namely studies of &quot;expertise&quot; and &quot;experience&quot; answering to recent tendencies to dissolve the boundary between experts and the public.

== Application to natural and man-made hazards ==

=== Sheepfarming after Chernobyl ===
A showcase of the rather complex problems of scientific information and its interaction with lay persons is Brian Wynne&#x27;s study of Sheepfarming in Cumbria after the Chernobyl disaster. He elaborated on the responses of sheep farmers in Cumbria, who had been subjected to administrative restrictions because of radioactive contamination, allegedly caused by the nuclear accident at Chernobyl in 1986. The sheep farmers suffered economic losses, and their resistance against the imposed regulation was being deemed irrational and inadequate. It turned out that the source of radioactivity was actually the Sellafield nuclear reprocessing complex; thus, the experts who were responsible for the duration of the restrictions were completely mistaken. The example led to attempts to better involve local knowledge and lay-persons&#x27; experience and to assess its often highly geographically and historically defined background.

=== Science studies on volcanology ===
Donovan et al. (2012) used social studies of volcanology to investigate the generation of knowledge and expert advice on various active volcanoes. It contains a survey of volcanologists carried out during 2008 and 2009 and interviews with scientists in the UK, Montserrat, Italy and Iceland during fieldwork seasons. Donovan et al. (2012) asked the experts about the felt purpose of volcanology and what they considered the most important eruptions in historical time. The survey tries to identify eruptions that had an influence on volcanology as a science and to assess the role of scientists in policymaking.

A main focus was on the impact of the Montserrat eruption 1997. The eruption, a classical example of the black swan theory directly killed (only) 19 persons. However the outbreak had major impacts on the local society and destroyed important infrastructure, as the island&#x27;s airport. About 7,000 people, or two-thirds of the population, left Montserrat; 4,000 to the United Kingdom.

The Montserrat case put immense pressure on volcanologists, as their expertise suddenly became the primary driver of various public policy approaches. The science studies approach provided valuable insights in that situation. There were various miscommunications among scientists. Matching scientific uncertainty (typical of volcanic unrest) and the request for a single unified voice for political advice was a challenge. The Montserrat Volcanologists began to use statistical elicitation models to estimate the probabilities of particular events, a rather subjective method, but allowing to synthesizing consensus and experience-based expertise step by step. It involved as well local knowledge and experience.

Volcanology as a science currently faces a shift of its epistemological foundations of volcanology. The science started to involve more research into risk assessment and risk management. It requires new, integrated methodologies for knowledge collection that transcend scientific disciplinary boundaries but combine qualitative and quantitative outcomes in a structured whole.

== Experts and democracy ==
Science has become a major force in Western democratic societies, which depend on innovation and technology (compare Risk society) to address its risks. Beliefs about science can be very different from those of the scientists themselves, for reasons of e.g. moral values, epistemology or political motivations. The designation of expertise as authoritative in the interaction with lay people and decision makers of all kind is nevertheless challenged in contemporary risk societies, as suggested by scholars who follow Ulrich Beck&#x27;s theorisation. The role of expertise in contemporary democracies is an important theme for debate among science studies scholars. Some argue for a more widely distributed, pluralist understanding of expertise (Sheila Jasanoff and Brian Wynne, for example), while others argue for a more nuanced understanding of the idea of expertise and its social functions (Collins and Evans, for example).

<text>Indian peace medals refer to ovular or circular medals awarded to tribal leaders throughout colonial America and early United States history, primarily made of silver or brass and ranging in diameter from about one to six inches. Medals were often perforated and worn suspended around the neck of the recipient. Controversy remains surrounding the use and impact of peace medals in furthering diplomatic relationships between Native Americans and the federal government. Many Indian peace medals today are archived in museums, libraries, and cultural centers.

== Early peace medals ==
During the colonization of America, European nations issued the earliest peace medals to build alliances and negotiate with tribes, dating as far back as the seventeenth century. Medals were given to North American Indians by the British, French, and Spanish in the eighteenth century as sentiments of peace, often in conjunction with national flags and other gifts. A number of silver medals issued under Kings George the First and Second have been excavated in Pennsylvania, the reverse of which show an American Indian figure offering a peace pipe to a Quaker. Medals were also used by European nations to curry favor and secure military alliances with tribes during wartime. For Native Americans, the early medals represented a pledge to supply and trade commodities such as kettles, beads, ornaments, clothes, and weapons. In return, they would supply much of the raw materials that Europeans&#x27; overseas trade depended on, including animal hides, furs, and feathers.Like many European medals, early US medals incorporated Indian figures on their design. What are thought to be the earliest peace medals issued by the US government carry the date 1789, the year of President Washington&#x27;s inauguration, along with the inscription G. WASHINGTON. PRESIDENT above. The medals show an Indian man wearing a headdress, draped in a blanket. With his right hand he drops his tomahawk while simultaneously receiving a pipe of peace with his left from a figure of Minerva, symbolizing the young America. On the reverse is an eagle with wings extended and thirteen stars above its head, the arms of the United States. US medals issued from 1792 to 1795 are similar in design, but replace the figure of Minerva with George Washington himself.

Medals were an expression of promise: that the United States was invested in furthering peace and diplomacy with the Indians who called this land home. Consequently, the awarding of peace medals often accompanied a formal treaty or negotiation. One of the first known uses of peace medals by the US government dates back to the Treaty of Hopewell, the culmination of Colonel Joseph Martin&#x27;s mission to the Cherokee nation in 1785. While the medals were issued in accordance with the treaty, the records do not confirm whether or not they were actually distributed to Cherokee leaders.

The ultimate origin of Indian peace medals is not known. Thomas Jefferson himself noted that the usage of the medals is &quot;an ancient custom from time immemorial.&quot;

==Presidential medals ==
While early peace medals issued by European nations and the US government frequently incorporate images of European and tribal figures in cultural exchange, peace medals issued during and after the presidency of Thomas Jefferson (1801 – 1809) are almost exclusively presidential medals, displaying the bust of the President in office at the time they were issued. Jefferson medals were the first of their kind, and inspired a long series of presidential medals that continued until the presidency of Benjamin Harrison (1889 – 1893). Presidential medals were minted in mass using engraved dies, replacing the practice of engraving individual medals.

Jefferson medals, first issued in 1801, display on one side a bust of Thomas Jefferson and on the other, the clasped hands of an Indian and a US soldier. The one to the right bears a metal wristband worn by Native American chiefs, and the one to the left wears the braided cuff of a US military officer. Above the hands is an overlaying tomahawk and pipe, with the legend &quot;Peace and Friendship.&quot; Above Jefferson&#x27;s profile is his name, title, and date he took office, 1801. Jefferson medals consist of two thin silver discs joined by a silver rim and a wooden core. The medals were issued in three standard sizes: 55mm, 75mm, to 105mm in diameter.

=== US government use of presidential medals ===
The distribution of presidential medals accompanied nearly every formal interaction between Native Americans and the US federal government. So established was the practice that Thomas L. McKenney, the Commissioner of Indian Affairs, wrote in 1829, &quot;Without medals, any plan of operating among the Indians, be it what it may, is essentially enfeebled.&quot; In a short string of correspondence between the US House of Representatives Committee of Ways and Means and the Department of the Interior in 1865, an appropriation was requested &quot;to provide for the usual distribution of medals to leading and influential chiefs,&quot; as the funds provided in 1861 for the same purpose had been exhausted.

The growing popularity of peace medals compelled regulation, and as a result, presidential medals, in comparison to early peace medals given alongside treaties, were increasingly awarded to select individuals. A report issued in 1908 by the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs, for example, recommended the passage of a bill that awards medals to a group of Indian policemen who arrested Sitting Bull, the Sioux chief, near Fort Yates in 1890. Additionally, Meriwether Lewis and William Clark famously distributed about eighty-seven peace medals, many of which were issued under Jefferson, to Indian leaders during their 1803-1806 expedition across the United States as demonstrations of goodwill from the government. In the 1960s, one of the five surviving Jefferson peace medals distributed by Lewis and Clark was found associated with human remains discovered at the Marmes Rockshelter in southeastern Washington state.

In 1829, Lewis Cass, the Governor of Michigan Territory and William Clark, Superintendent of Indian Affairs at St. Louis, issued a proposal to the US government: &quot;Regulations for the Government of the Indian Department.&quot; The regulations they set forth were never formally adopted, but do represent the established norms of presidential medal distribution. Among other rules, the medals were to &quot;be given to influential persons only.&quot; The largest medals were reserved for the chiefs, while the mid-sized medals would be given to war chiefs. The smallest medals were given to less distinguished chiefs and warriors. The awarding of the peace medals required &quot;proper formalities,&quot; and any foreign medal previously worn would be replaced by an American medal if the recipient is deserving of a medal.
== Native American acceptance of peace medals ==
Great value was prescribed by the peace medals, which were to be buried with the owner or passed down from generation to generation. A considerable amount of portraiture made of Native American figures accentuating the medals worn around their neck serves as a testament to their importance.

Peace medals assumed a role within many Native ethea akin to earlier worn shell gorgets, associating the wearer of the medal with the individual engraved on its surface. The imagery presented on the medals, of both royal and political figures, was understood as a symbol of access into the world of the White man. This world brought with it new trade goods and technologies of Europe and later the United States, notably the rifle. The medals became a physical representation of a spiritual dimension that linked the medal wearer to a source of power, for example, the &quot;Great Father&quot; as President Washington was referred to by medal recipients. The distribution of peace medals both reinforced and furthered a political order within the tribes.

== Criticisms of peace medals ==
Black Hawk, a Sauk chief, represents a number of tribal leaders who were critical of US peace medals and their actual use in advancing relations between the federal government and Native Americans. Black Hawk wrote in his autobiography, &quot;Life of Ma-Ka-Tai-Me-She-Kia-Kiak&quot; (1833), that he never accepts or wears a US peace medal, though he openly wore those given to him by the British, particularly during the War of 1812. Black Hawk writes, &quot;Whilst the British made but few [promises]- we could always rely upon their word.&quot; Towards the end of his narrative, Black Hawk reflects on his tour of the federal mint in Philadelphia, the source of the United States&#x27; &quot;medals and money.&quot; He relates the coins to the US peace medals; both are &quot;very hand-some,&quot; and both are unreliable.

Other contemporary criticisms of Indian peace medals demand a reconsideration of what peacekeeping implies and who the kept peace belongs to. In his analysis of the peace medals issued by the United States government between 1789 and 1889, art historian Klaus Lubbers describes the changing composition of the medal engravings, and how those changes reflect the government&#x27;s increasingly assimilationist Indian policy. In comparison to the first peace medals that display full Indian figures and little in the background, Lubbers notes that subsequent peace medals incorporate typical agricultural backdrops with a house, oxen, and farm land. Over time, the Indian figures take up less space in the compositions, which Lubbers attributes to a receding equality in rank between the White man and the Indian. The issuing of the Rutherford B. Hayes medal in 1877 coincided with the final efforts endorsed by the Indian Removal Act, and unsurprising to Lubbers, the Hayes medal affords little space to the Native American figure. Its backdrop displays the world of the White man, who stands in the center of the composition leaning on an ax with a chopped tree at his feet. Behind the figures appears a log cabin, and there sits a woman and infant while a man plows.

== Indian peace medals today ==
By the 1840s, Indian peace medals had come to be known as a &quot;presidential series&quot; for which there was growing interest. The federal mint in Philadelphia started collecting dies for the previously issued medals. This began the practice of striking bronze replicas of medals for presentation to government officials or historical societies. Production of the bronze medals began in 1842 with the Jefferson medal. The dies of the Washington and John Adams medals were missing during initial production, however. The John Adams die was not collected until 1878, and the George Washington die was ultimately reproduced in 1903, completing the series.

The American Numismatic Society in New York has the most extensive collection of Indian peace medals, containing an example of nearly every medal issued. The Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C. has a similarly large collection. Significant medal collections may be found in the Denver Museum of Nature and Science, the Gilcrease Institute of American History and Art, the Henry Ford Museum, and the Massachusetts Historical Society. Other locations, including the Arizona Pioneer&#x27;s Historical Society, Boston Museum of Fine Arts, Brooklyn Museum, and the Chicago Historical Society, have smaller collections. A number of peace medals also belong to private collectors.

<doc id="358612" wikidata="Q1744546" url="?curid=358612" title="Classes of United States senators">
<text>The 100 seats in the United States Senate are divided into three classes for the purpose of determining which seats will be up for election in any two-year cycle, with only one class being up for election at a time. With senators being elected to fixed terms of six years, the classes allow about a third of the seats to be up for election in any presidential or midterm election year instead of having all 100 be up for election at the same time every six years. The seats are also divided in such a way that any given state&#x27;s two senators are in different classes so that each seat&#x27;s term ends in different years. Class 1and class 2 consist of 33 seats each, while class3 consists of 34 seats. Elections for class1 seats took place in 2024, and elections for classes2 and 3 will take place in 2026 and 2028, respectively.

The three classes were established by ArticleI, Section 3, Clause2 of the U.S. Constitution. The actual division was originally performed by the Senate of the 1st Congress in May 1789 by lot. Whenever a new state subsequently joined the union, its two Senate seats were assigned to two different classes by a random draw, while keeping the three classes as close to the same number as possible.

The classes only apply to the regular fixed-term elections of the Senate. A special election to fill a vacancy, usually either due to the incumbent resigning or dying while in office, may happen in any given year regardless of the seat&#x27;s class.

A senator&#x27;s description as junior or senior senator is also not related to their class. Rather, a state&#x27;s senior U.S. senator is the one with the greater seniority in the Senate, which is mostly based on length of service.

==History==
===Constitutional footing===
The U.S. Constitution sets the fixed term of senators to six years and staggers their elections into three cycles, so that a third of the Senate was up for election every two years. This allows at least some Senate elections to be held during any presidential or midterm election year, as the U.S. President is elected to a fixed term of four years and members of the U.S. House of Representatives are elected to fixed terms of two years. The objective is to promote stability in the Senate, and encourage senators to deliberate measures over time, rather than risk a rapid turnover of the entire chamber every six years. At the same time, it provided for more frequent elections as opposed to waiting every six years, to prevent senators from permanently combining for &quot;sinister purposes&quot;.

The three classes of the Senate are specified by ArticleI, Section3 of the U.S. Constitution:

The allocation took place in May 1789, several weeks after the first Senate assembled. Only twenty senators from ten states were present; North Carolina and Rhode Island had not yet ratified the U.S. Constitution, and New York, because of its late ratification, had not yet selected its senators. To decide on how to implement the division into classes, on May 11 the Senate appointed a committee consisting of Senators Ellsworth, Carroll, and Few. In accordance with their recommendation, on May 14 the Senate divided the members into three classes:
On the next day, May 15, the term expiration of each class was determined by drawing lots. Lot 1 was drawn by Dalton, 2by Wingate, and 3by Langdon.

Upon the expiration of a senator&#x27;s term of any length, someone starts a new six-year term as senator (based on election by the state legislatures until the Seventeenth Amendment required direct popular election of senators).

===Addition of new states to the Union===
When a new state is admitted to the Union, its two senators are placed into separate classes. Which two classes are determined by a scheme that keeps the three classes as close to the same size as possible, so that the largest class never differs by more than one senator from the smallest class. A random draw determined which new senator enters which of the classes selected to be expanded. This means at least one of any new state&#x27;s first pair of senators had a term of more than 2 and up to 6 years and the other had a term that was 2 or 4 years shorter.

New York, which held its first Senate elections in July 1789, was the first state to undergo this process after the original May 1789 draw by the Senate of the 1st Congress. Among the new senators, Philip Schuyler drew the lot for class1 (whose term would end in 1791) while Rufus King drew class3 (whose term would end in 1795). This made class1 have 8 senators while classes 2and 3 had 7 senators each. North Carolina was then assigned classes 2and 3 after holding its first Senate elections in November 1789, making all three classes have 8 seats each.

When the newest state, Hawaii, was admitted in 1959, its first Senate elections had candidates run either for &quot;seat A&quot; or &quot;B&quot;. The new senators, Hiram Fong and Oren E. Long, in a process managed by the Secretary of the Senate, drew lots to determine which of the two would join class1 (whose term would end in five-and-a-half years), and which would join class3 (whose term would end in three-and-a-half years). If a 51st state is admitted, it will receive senators in classes 1and 2, at which point all three classes would have 34 senators.

Because each state is represented by 2 senators, regardless of population, each class varies in electorate and populace. Since the early 19th century, it so happens class2 senators cumulatively co-represent 50–60% of the population; senators from each of the other 2 classes: 70–75% of the U.S. population. Because each state has 2 senators, the sum of these figures is 200%, not 100%. Several of the most populous states, such as California, Florida, New York, Pennsylvania, and Ohio, have their senators in classes 1and 3, provoking this imbalance.

The only times when both of a state&#x27;s Senate seats are up for election in the same year are either when a new state joins the union (as mentioned above), or when there is a special election to fill a vacant seat. Special elections have no bearing on when the term for that seat ends, and a senator elected in a special election will serve the remainder of the term, until the next regularly scheduled election, not affecting which class that seat falls within.

<text>Papiamento () or Papiamentu (; ) is a Portuguese-based creole language spoken in the Dutch Caribbean. It is the most widely spoken language on the ABC islands (Aruba, Bonaire, and Curaçao).

The language, spelled in Aruba and in Bonaire and Curaçao, is largely based on Portuguese as spoken in the 15th and 16th centuries, and has been influenced considerably by Dutch and Venezuelan Spanish. Due to lexical similarities between Portuguese and Spanish, it is difficult to pinpoint the exact origin of some words. Though there are different theories about its origins, most linguists now believe that Papiamento emerged from the Portuguese-based creole languages of the West African coasts, as it has many similarities with Cape Verdean Creole and Guinea-Bissau Creole.

== History ==

There are various theories about the origin and development of the Papiamento language, and precise history has not been established. Its parent language is surely West Iberian Romance, but scholars dispute whether Papiamento was derived from Portuguese and its derived Portuguese-based creole languages or from Spanish. Historical constraints, core vocabulary, and grammatical features that Papiamento shares with Cape Verdean Creole and Guinea-Bissau Creole are far less than those shared with Spanish, even though the Spanish and Dutch influences occurred later, from the 17th century onwards. In 1978, Jacoba Bouscholte conducted a study on the various Dutch influences in Papiamento. An example of a hybrid word is , which is a combination of a Dutch root (meaning &#x27;paint&#x27;) and the Portuguese and Spanish suffix &quot;-dor&quot; (used for a person who performs an action, like &#x27;painter&#x27;). The transformation from to involved changing the &quot;-dor&quot; to &quot;-dó&quot; due to a linguistic process called apocopation.

The name of the language itself originates from , from Portuguese and Cape Verdean Creole (&quot;to chat, say, speak, talk&quot;), added by the noun-forming suffix .

Spain claimed dominion over the islands in the 15th century but made little use of them. Portuguese merchants had been trading extensively in the West Indies and with the Iberian Union between Portugal and Spain during 1580–1640 period, their trade extended to the Spanish West Indies. In 1634, the Dutch West India Company (WIC) took possession of the islands, deporting most of the small remaining Arawak and Spanish population to the continent (mostly to the Venezuelan west coast and the Venezuelan plains, as well as all the way east to the Venezuela Orinoco basin and Trinidad), and turned them into the hub of the Dutch slave trade between Africa and the Caribbean.

The first evidence of widespread use of Papiamento in Aruba and Curaçao can be seen in official documents in the early 18th century. In the 19th century, most materials in the islands were written in Papiamento including Roman Catholic school books and hymnals. In 1837, the &quot;Catecismo Corticu pa uso di catolicanan di Curaçao&quot; (Brief Catechism for use by Catholics) was printed, the first printed book in Papiamento. In 2009 the Catecismo Corticu was added to the UNESCO Memory of the World register. The first Papiamento newspaper was published in 1871 and was called &quot;Civilisadó&quot; (The Civilizer).

=== Local development theory ===
One local development theory proposes that Papiamento developed in the Caribbean from an original Portuguese-African pidgin, with later Dutch and Spanish (and even some Arawak) influences.

Another theory is that Papiamento first evolved from the use in the region since 1499 of &#x27;lenguas&#x27; and the first repopulation of the ABC Islands by the Spanish by the Cédula real decreed in November 1525 in which Juan Martinez de Ampués, factor of Española, had been granted the right to repopulate the depopulated Islas inútiles of Oroba, Islas de los Gigantes, and Buon Aire.

The evolution of Papiamento continued under the Dutch colonisation under the influence of 16th-century Dutch, Portuguese (Brazilian) and Native American languages (Arawak and Taíno), with the second repopulation of the ABC islands with immigrants who arrived from the ex-Dutch Brazilian colonies.

The Judaeo-Portuguese population of the ABC islands increased substantially after 1654, when the Portuguese recovered the Dutch-held territories in Northeast Brazil, causing most Portuguese-speaking Jews and their Portuguese-speaking Dutch allies and Dutch-speaking Portuguese Brazilian allies in those lands to flee from religious persecution. The precise role of Sephardic Jews in the early development is unclear, but Jews certainly played a prominent role in the later development of Papiamento. Many early residents of Curaçao were Sephardic Jews from Portugal, Spain, Cape Verde or Portuguese Brazil. Also, after the Eighty Years&#x27; War, a group of Sephardic Jews immigrated from Amsterdam. Therefore, it can be assumed that Judaeo-Portuguese was brought to the island of Curaçao, where it gradually spread to other parts of the community. The Jewish community became the prime merchants and traders in the area and so business and everyday trading was conducted in Papiamento. While various nations owned the island, and official languages changed with ownership, Papiamento became the constant language of the residents.

When the Netherlands opened economic ties with Spanish colonies in what are now Venezuela and Colombia in the 18th century,
students on Curaçao, Aruba, and Bonaire were taught predominantly in Spanish, and Spanish began to influence the creole language.
Since there was a continuous Latinisation process (Hoetink, 1987), even the elite Dutch-Protestant settlers eventually communicated better in Spanish than in Dutch, as a wealth of local Spanish-language publications in the 19th century testify.

=== European and African origin theory ===
According to the European and African origin theory the origins of Papiamento lie in the Afro-Portuguese creoles that arose in the 16th century in the west coast of Africa and in the Portuguese Cape Verde islands. From the 16th to the late 17th centuries, most of the slaves taken to the Caribbean came from Portuguese trading posts (, ) in those regions. Around those ports, several Portuguese-African pidgin and creole languages developed, such as Cape Verdean Creole, Guinea-Bissau Creole, Angolar, and Forro (from São Tomé). The sister languages bear strong resemblance with Papiamento. According to this theory, Papiamento was derived from one or more of these older creoles or their predecessors, which were brought to the ABC islands by slaves and traders from Cape Verde and West Africa.

The similarity between Papiamento and the other Afro-Portuguese creoles can be seen in the same pronouns used, , , , , , being Portuguese-based.
Afro-Portuguese creoles often have a shift from &quot;v&quot; to &quot;b&quot; and from &quot;o&quot; to &quot;u&quot;: (), instead of . In creole and also in Spanish, and are pronounced the same. In creole, it is also written as a . Just as in Portuguese, an unaccented final is pronounced as .

Guene (the name comes from &quot;Guinea&quot;) was a secret language that was used by slaves on the plantations of the landhouses of West Curaçao. There were about a hundred Guene songs that were sung to make the work lighter. However, because of the secret character of Guene, it never had much influence on Papiamento.

=== Linguistic and historical ties with Upper Guinea Portuguese Creole ===
Since the late 1990s, research has been done that shines light on the ties between Papiamento and Upper Guinea Portuguese Creole. focus specifically on the linguistic and historical relationships with the Upper Guinea Portuguese Creole, as spoken on the Santiago island of Cape Verde and in Guinea-Bissau and Casamance.

In Bart Jacob&#x27;s study &quot;The Upper Guinea Origins of Papiamento&quot; he defends the hypothesis that Papiamento is a relexified offshoot of an early Upper Guinea Portuguese Creole variety that was transferred from Senegambia to Curaçao in the second half of the 17th century, when the Dutch controlled the island of Gorée, a slave trading stronghold off the coast of Senegal. The Creole was used for communication among slaves and between slaves and slave holders.

On Curaçao, this variety underwent internal changes as well as contact-induced changes at all levels of the grammar, but particularly in the lexicon, due to contact with Spanish and, to a lesser extent, Dutch. Despite the changes, the morphosyntactic framework of Papiamento is still remarkably close to that of the Upper Guinea Creoles of Cape Verde and Guinea-Bissau. Parallels have also been identified between the development of Papiamento and Catholicism.

=== Present status ===
Papiamento is spoken in all aspects of society throughout Aruba, Curaçao and Bonaire.

Papiamento has been an official language of Aruba since May 2003. In the former Netherlands Antilles, Papiamento was made an official language on 7 March 2007. After the dissolution of the Netherlands Antilles on 10 October 2010, Papiamento&#x27;s official status was confirmed in the newly formed Caribbean Netherlands. Also, 150,000 Antillians (mostly from Curaçao) live in the Netherlands and speak their mother language, Papiamento, fluently. Some Papiamento is also spoken on Sint Maarten and the Paraguaná Peninsula of Venezuela.

Venezuelan Spanish and American English are constant influences today. Code-switching and lexical borrowing from Spanish, Dutch and English among native speakers is common. This is considered as a threat to the development of the language because of the loss of the authentic and Creole &quot;feel&quot; of Papiamento.

Many immigrants from Latin America and the Caribbean choose to learn Papiamento because it is more practical in daily life on the islands. For Spanish-speakers, it is easier to learn than Dutch, because Papiamento uses many Spanish and Portuguese words.

The first opera in Papiamento, adapted by from his novel &quot;Katibu di Shon&quot;, was performed at the Stadsschouwburg in Amsterdam on 1 July 2013, commemorating the 150th anniversary of the ending of slavery in the Dutch Caribbean.

=== Old Papiamento texts ===

The Papiamento language originates from about 1650. The oldest Papiamento texts that have been preserved are written letters. In the following three letters it can be seen that the words changed and the spelling became closer to the Dutch spelling. Although some words are no longer in use, the basis of Papiamento did not change much.

==== Piter May letter 1775 ====

The oldest letter dates from 1775. It was sent by the Sephardic Jew Abraham Andrade to his mistress Sarah Vaz Parro, about a family meeting in the centre of Curaçao.

====Boo Jantje letter 1783====

The next letter dates from 1783 and was recently discovered in an English archive. It was sent by Anna Charje in the name of her baby Jantje Boufet to her husband Dirk Schermer in Rotterdam. (The final sentence is standard Dutch.)


====Quant Court affidavit 1803====

The third text dates from 1803. It is an affidavit (written testimony for use in a court of law as evidence) signed by 26 Aruban farm workers to support their supervisor Pieter Specht against false accusations by landowner B.G. Quant.

==Orthography and spelling==
Papiamento is written using the Latin script.

Since the 1970s, two different orthographies have been developed and adopted. In 1976, Curaçao and Bonaire officially adopted the Römer-Maduro-Jonis version, a phonetic spelling. In 1977, Aruba approved a more etymology-based spelling, presented by the Comision di Ortografia (Orthography Commission), presided by Jossy Mansur.

== Distribution and dialects ==
Papiamento is primarily spoken on the ABC Islands and to a lesser extent by the Dutch Caribbean diaspora, namely in the Netherlands. Papiamento is also spoken by a smaller number of speakers in Sint Maarten, Saba and Sint Eustatius. An earlier, now-extinct form of Papiamento was formerly spoken on the Paraguana peninsula of Venezuela.

There are two main dialects of Papiamento, the dialect of Aruba (Papiamento) and the dialect of Curaçao and Bonaire (Papiamentu), with lexical and intonational differences. There are also minor differences between Curaçao and Bonaire.

The most apparent difference between the two dialects is given away in the name difference. Whereas Bonaire and Curaçao opted for a phonology-based spelling, Aruba uses an etymology-based spelling. Many words in Aruba end with &quot;o&quot; while the same word ends with &quot;u&quot; in Bonaire and Curaçao. And even in Curaçao, the use of the u-ending is still more pronounced among the Sephardic Jewish population. Similarly, the use of &quot;k&quot; in Bonaire and Curaçao replaces &quot;c&quot; in Aruba.

For example:

In the past, certain rural areas of Aruba and Curaçao featured the guttural R (a feature common in French) or omitted the letter S at the end of words (a feature common in Caribbean Spanish). However it is likely many of these rural features have either disappeared over time or are used by few speakers today.

== Phonology ==
=== Vowels and diphthongs ===
Papiamento vowels are based on Ibero-Romance and Dutch vowels. Papiamento has the following nine vowels:

Papiamento has diphthongs, two vowels in a single syllable that form one sound.
Papiamento diphthongs are based on Ibero-Romance and Dutch diphthongs. It has the following diphthongs:

=== Stress and accent ===
Stress is very important in Papiamento. Many words have a very different meaning when a different stress is used:

* When both syllables are equally stressed, , it means &quot;to eat&quot;.
* When the first syllable is stressed, , it means &quot;eat!&quot; (imperative).
* However, (short for ) means &quot;eat it!&quot;

There are general rules for the stress and accent but also a great many exceptions.
When a word deviates from the rules, the stressed vowel is indicated by an acute accent ( ´ ), but it is often omitted in casual writing.

The main rules are:
* When a noun ends in a vowel (a, e, i, o, u), the stress is placed upon the penultimate (before last) syllable: (&quot;donkey&quot;).
* When a noun ends in a consonant, the stress is placed upon the last syllable: .
* When a verb has two syllables, the syllables are about equally stressed: (&quot;to care&quot;), (&quot;to lack&quot;).
* When a verb has more than two syllables, the stress is laid upon the last syllable: (&quot;to answer&quot;), (&quot;to promise&quot;).

== Lexicon ==
=== Vocabulary ===
Most of the vocabulary is derived from Portuguese and
derived Portuguese-based creoles and (Early Modern) Spanish. The real origin is usually difficult to tell because the two Iberian languages are very similar, and adaptations were made in Papiamento. A can be found in the standard Swadesh list, with etymological reference to the language of origin. There is a remarkable similarity between words in Papiamento, Cape Verdean Creole, and Guinea-Bissau Creole, which all belong to the same language family of the Upper Guinea Creoles. Most of the words can be connected with their Portuguese origin.

Linguistic studies have shown that roughly 80% of the words in Papiamento&#x27;s present vocabulary are of Iberian origin, 20% are of Dutch origin, and some of Native American or African origin. A study by Van Buurt and Joubert inventoried the words of Taíno and Caquetío Arawak origin, mostly words for plants and animals. Arawak is an extinct language that was spoken by Indigenous people throughout the Caribbean. The Arawak words were re-introduced in Papiamento by borrowing from the Spanish dialect of Venezuela

Many words are of Iberian origin, and it is impossible to label them as either Portuguese or Spanish:
* (&quot;please&quot;) – Portuguese: – Spanish: 
* (&quot;madam&quot;) – Portuguese: – Spanish: 
* (&quot;which&quot;) – Portuguese: – Spanish: 
* (&quot;how much&quot;) – Portuguese: – Spanish: 

While the presence of word-final can easily be traced to Portuguese, the diphthongisation of some vowels is characteristic of Spanish. The use of , rather than , descends from its pronunciation in the dialects of northern Portugal as well as of Spanish. Also, a sound shift may have occurred in the direction of Spanish, whose influence on Papiamento came later than that of Portuguese: (&quot;nephew&quot;): in Portuguese, in Spanish. The pronunciation of as is certainly Portuguese, but the use of instead of () in the ending is from Spanish.

Few Portuguese words come directly from Portuguese, but most come via the Portuguese-based creole; in the examples below, the Cape Verdean Creole equivalents are , , and .

Portuguese-origin words:
* (&quot;butterfly&quot;) – Portuguese: 
* (&quot;dog&quot;) – Portuguese: 
* (&quot;black&quot;) – Portuguese: 
* (&quot;power&quot;) – Portuguese: 

Spanish-origin words:
* (&quot;city&quot;) – Spanish: 
* (&quot;hat&quot;) – Spanish: 
* (&quot;trousers&quot;) – Spanish:

Dutch-origin words:
* (&quot;apple&quot;) – Dutch: 
* (&quot;book&quot;) – Dutch: 
* (&quot;to read&quot;) – Dutch: 
* (&quot;March&quot;) – Dutch: 

English-origin words:
* – English: back
* – English: bottle
* - English: baseball
* – English: bicycle

African-origin words:
* (&quot;peanut&quot;) – Kongo: 
* (&quot;Dutch person&quot;) – Bantu: 
* (&quot;to kneel&quot;) – Wolof: 
* (&quot;wasp&quot;) – Bantu: 

Native American-origin words:
* (&quot;hurricane&quot;) – Taíno: 
* (&quot;corn&quot;) – Taíno: 
* (&quot;farm&quot;) – Taíno: 
* (&quot;ugly&quot;) – Arawak: 

==Literature and culture==
Aruba and Bonaire&#x27;s national anthems are in Papiamento, &quot;Aruba Dushi Tera&quot; and &quot;Tera di Solo y suave biento&quot; respectively. The newspaper &quot;Diario&quot; is also in the language.

The 2013 films &quot;Abo So&quot; (Aruba) and &quot;Sensei Redenshon&quot; (Curaçao) were the first feature films in Papiamento; the comedy &quot;Bon Bini Holland&quot; (Curaçao and Netherlands) also contains some Papiamento.

<text>Vladimir Antonovich Ivashko (; , &quot;Volodymyr Antonovych Ivashko&quot;; 28 October 1932 – 13 November 1994) was a Soviet Ukrainian politician, briefly acting as General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU) during the period from 24 to 29 August 1991. On 24 August Mikhail Gorbachev resigned from the post, and on 29 August the CPSU was suspended by the Supreme Soviet. Before becoming General Secretary he had been voted Gorbachev&#x27;s Deputy General Secretary within the Party on 12 July 1990, a newly created position as a result of the 28th Congress of the Communist Party.

==Biography==
The Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU) during the time between Mikhail Gorbachev&#x27;s resignation and its suspension was politically impotent. By the time of the 28th Congress in July 1990, the party was largely regarded as being unable to lead the country and had, across the fifteen republics of the Soviet Union, split into opposing factions favouring either independent republics or the continuation of the Soviet state. Stripped of its leading role in society, the party lost its authority to lead the nation or the cohesion that kept the party united. Actual political power lay in the positions of President of the Soviet Union (held by Gorbachev) and President of the Russian SFSR (held by Boris Yeltsin). During the August Coup he did not make public statements but on behalf of the Secretariat distributed letters to local party organizations calling on them to uphold the CPSU.

Gorbachev brought in his ally Ivashko in to replace the long-serving Volodymyr Shcherbytsky as First Secretary of the Communist Party of Ukraine on 28 September 1989. Ivashko led the Communists to victory in the first relatively free parliamentary election held in the Ukrainian SSR, which took place from 4 March to 18 March 1990, the Communists winning 331 seats to the Democratic Bloc&#x27;s 111 seats. Ivashko was elected by the communist majority to the post of the Chairman of the Verkhovna Rada of the Ukrainian SSR on 4 June 1990. Since the abandonment by the Communists of their &quot;leading role&quot; in early 1990 this position now superseded that of First Secretary of the Communist Party as the most powerful position in Ukraine.

He resigned his position as First Secretary on 22 June 1990 following opposition demonstrations against his simultaneous occupation of both the posts of First Secretary of the ruling party and Chairman of the legislature. However, on 9 July 1990 he too resigned as Chairman of the Verkhovna Rada of the Ukrainian SSR after declining to be recalled to Kyiv during the 28th Congress of the Communist Party in Moscow, and a few days later successfully secured the position of Deputy General Secretary of the CPSU.

On August 23, 1990, a secret memorandum from Ivashko outlined strategies to hide the Communist Party&#x27;s assets through Russian and international joint ventures because Boris Yeltsin, who was the new president of the Russian Republic in the Soviet Union, wanted to levy taxes on the Communist Party&#x27;s vast administrative property holdings and on the party itself. The memorandum was to organize the transfer of CPSU funds, CPSU financing and support of its operations through associations, ventures, foundations, etc. which are to act as invisible economics. In November 1990, the offshore structure Fimaco was formed by the Gosbank to hide these funds. According to Sergei Tretyakov, KGB chief Vladimir Kryuchkov sent US$50 billion worth of funds of the Communist Party to an unknown location in the lead-up to the collapse of the USSR.

Following the failed August 1991 Soviet coup d&#x27;état attempt, Gorbachev resigned from his post of General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and Ivashko became acting General Secretary. On 29 August 1991 the activity of the CPSU was suspended throughout the country, on 6 November Yeltsin banned the activities of the party in Russia and Gorbachev resigned from the presidency on 25 December; the following day the Soviet of Republics dissolved the Soviet Union.

Ivashko retired in 1992 and died on 13 November 1994, at the age of 62, after an undetermined long illness.

<text>A caravan, travel trailer, camper, tourer or camper trailer is a trailer towed behind a road vehicle to provide a place to sleep which is more comfortable and protected than a tent (although there are fold-down trailer tents). It provides the means for people to have their own home on a journey or a vacation, without relying on a motel or hotel, and enables them to stay in places where none is available. However, in some countries campers are restricted to designated sites for which fees are payable.

Caravans vary from basic models which may be little more than a tent on wheels to those containing several rooms with all the furniture and furnishings and equipment of a home. Construction of the solid-wall trailers can be made of metal or fiberglass. Travel trailers are used principally in North America, Europe, Australia and New Zealand.

The word &quot;caravan&quot; (sometimes &quot;trailer caravan&quot; in distinction to &quot;motor caravan&quot;) is regional to Great Britain, while in North America they are called &quot;travel trailers&quot; or &quot;camper trailer&quot;; different parts of the anglosphere may use further variations on either of these. This has led to further variations, such as in New Zealand a &quot;motor caravan&quot; is typically called a &quot;motorhome&quot; in North America. In North America, caravans are included under the umbrella term recreational vehicle, or &quot;RV&quot; for short - though they do not have to be for recreation, and the term includes travel trailers and many other types. Types of &quot;travel trailers&quot; in the US include teardrop trailer, fifth-wheel, hybrid, and pop-up. To further clarify, in North America mobile home and trailer parks are generally not caravans or caravan park, those are actually pre-constructed homes fixed in place, though sometimes they can be. In general, a caravan park there is more like an RV park, which might have temporary hookups for sewage, power, and/water for a caravan (RV home) but usually allows other types such as motorhomes or campervans. Australian English calls both RV parks and trailer parks, caravan parks. Tiny homes that are mobile can have much in common with a caravan; however, going RVing and the tiny home movement are different trends. One is more about living mobile and/or vacationing, and the other is more about living in a small house mostly in one location. In North America a &quot;fifth-wheel&quot; is like a bigger caravan that mounts into the bed of a truck rather than a trailer hitch.

A caravan fits in the range of vehicles in that has more fixed structures then a camper trailer, but lack an engine like a campervan or motorhome. In the United States and Canada, most caravans would be called an &quot;RV&quot; of the subtype, &quot;travel trailer.&quot;

==History==
In Europe, the origins of travel trailers and caravanning can be traced back to the travelling Romani people, and showmen who spent most of their lives in horse-drawn caravans.
Samuel White Baker purchased an actual Gypsy caravan in Britain and shipped it to Cyprus for his tour in 1879. The world&#x27;s first leisure trailer was built by the Bristol Wagon &amp; Carriage Works in 1880 for William Gordon Stables, a popular author of teenage adventure fiction, who ordered a &quot;gentleman&#x27;s caravan&quot;. It was an design, based upon their Bible Wagons, used by travelling preachers in America&#x27;s Wild West. Stables named it &quot;Wanderer&quot;. He travelled around the British countryside in it and later wrote a book documenting his travels in 1885 called &quot;The Gentleman Gypsy&quot;. This moved the Duke of Newcastle to commission his own caravan, &quot;The Bohemian&quot;.

By the turn of the century, caravanning for leisure had become an increasingly popular activity. In 1901, the first dedicated caravanning club was established. The Camping and Caravanning Club (originally the Association of Cycle Campers) was founded by Thomas Hiram Holding, the father of modern camping. The Caravan Club was founded in 1907 with Stables as its vice president. Its stated aim was to &quot;... bring together those interested in van life as a pastime... to improve and supply suitable vans and other appliances... and to arrange camping grounds&quot;. Caravanning gained popularity in North America in the 1920s.

Modern travel trailers come in a range of sizes, from very small two-berth trailers with no toilet and only basic kitchen facilities, to large, triple-axle, six-berth types.

===Romani caravan===
Caravans, particularly the vardo, have served both as a significant cultural icon and symbol of the nomadic Romani people. Until the early 19th century, Romani caravans served primarily as a means of transport and not as a domicile. At the beginning of the 19th century, more Romani people began to live in their caravans instead of sleeping in tents. The caravan offered greater protection from weather conditions and could be outfitted with modern amenities such as wood-burning stoves. Often, caravans were commissioned to be built at the request of newlywed couples and their families. The small-scale, pre-industrial methods of the builders and the labour-intensive nature of the building process meant that a family&#x27;s caravan could take up to a year to build.

== Standards ==
Trailer caravan is defined in ISO Standard 3833:1977, Road vehicles – Types – Terms and definitions, term No 3.2.1.3.

==North America==
In North America, the term &quot;caravan&quot; is obscure. A caravan is an RV, and going RVing would be caravanning. Most caravan designs would probably be called a travel trailer, or in some cases a fifth wheel or camper trailer. Caravans can go to &quot;RV parks&quot; or some camp sites not trailer parks, which usually communities of semi-permanent structures called &quot;mobile homes&quot;. However, sometimes they can be actual collections of trailers with wheels that are very mobile.

===Travel trailer===

In the United States and Canada, the history of travel trailers can be traced back to the early 1920s, when those who enjoyed their use were often referred to as &#x27;tin can tourists&#x27;. As time progressed, trailers became more liveable and earned a new name in the 1930s and 1940s, which was the house trailer. In the 1950s and 1960s, the industry seemed to split, creating the two types that are seen today, that of the recreational vehicle (RV) industry and mobile home industry. Travel trailers are classified as a type of RV along with motorhomes, fifth-wheel trailers, pop-up trailers, and truck campers.

Smaller travel trailers and pop-ups are still made with touring in mind. These generally are less than long and contain simple amenities. By design, they are lightweight and quick to set up or prepare for travel. Most weigh less than and can be towed with a large car or small truck depending upon its towing capacity. Lightweight pop-up trailers weighing less than , such as the Combi-camper and Kamparoo can be towed even by small economy cars. Some exceptionally-light travel trailers can be pulled by a motorcycle or even bicycle. Fiberglass body construction entered the U.S. scene in 1971 with the introduction of the first U.S.-produced mini travel trailer, called the Playpac. Since then, moulded fiberglass trailers have gained more popularity due to many factors including durability, lightweight design, modern features and a modern nod to retro chic design.

The Playpac, invented by Steven Whysel, was the answer to the needs of the growing horde of VW &quot;Bug&quot; and other small-car owners who wanted a hard-shelled camper, light enough to be pulled by a small car. It came with a private water closet, shower, and the ability to sleep six. Its ultramodern aerodynamic styling and domed skylight by the modernist industrial designer Toshihiko Sakow made it an instant hit. It was short-lived, however (1971–1973), as the first Arab Oil Embargo and the ensuing major slow-down of RV sales caused it to cease operations. The Boler travel trailer was developed in Canada in 1968, soon joining the Playpac in the U.S. fiberglass light-weight class. The Hunter and Amerigo travel trailers were also available at that time. As moulded fiberglass technology advanced, more companies entered into the market. Key moulded fiberglass innovations made the travel trailers more durable but also lighter which allowed for more luxury amenities.

Mid-range travel trailers are long, can weigh or more, and are generally towed with compact pickup trucks and SUVs. They have most of the amenities of the larger travel trailers, but sleep fewer people.

Larger travel trailers are made with seasonal or full-time users in mind. These generally range from long and contain all the comforts of a luxury condominium. These amenity-laden models can reach or more, requiring a purpose-built tow vehicle, highway tractor or large truck or SUV. While trailers may weigh in even above that, most long-bed pickups have a maximum tow-weight of . Multiple televisions and air conditioners are common in units of this size. Slide-out rooms and screen porches add to livability. By law, travel trailers are limited to of living area, and many models offer exactly that plus any optional slide-outs.

With all of the disincentives inherent in local government zoning regulations and building codes to affordable, ecological (off-grid) and compact housing solutions, travel-trailers offer a possibility for those considering an ecological full-time home or seasonal cottage. Travel-trailers are often acceptable on flood-plains, areas outside of urban growth limits, et cetera, where regular buildings are not allowed. Among the virtues of a trailer park are its light infrastructure, low ecological footprint, minimal land disturbance, abundant permeable surfaces (for stormwater drainage), and ease of site restoration.

Some specialized brands of the trailer, such as the hi-lo trailer, have an upper half (slightly larger than the lower half) that can be folded down over the lower half to a total height of about five feet for reduced wind resistance during travel; these otherwise contain everything other travel trailers have (except for a full-height closet).

Innovation in travel trailers is the hybrid travel trailer, combining the features of a pop-up and a hard-sided trailer. In its camping configuration, one or more bunks fold down from the side with canvas tent covers. When travelling, the bunks fold up, leaving four hard sides. Larger models allow the hybrid travel trailer to be used while &quot;turtled&quot;meaning with the sides up. The primary advantage of a hybrid travel trailer is it offers a greater space-to-weight ratio. A disadvantage is the tent ends are not insulated and are subject to heat loss and condensation.

In the United States, it is generally illegal for passengers to ride in a travel trailer, while in motion, unlike horse-drawn trailers and coaches. Triple towing (towing two trailers) is not allowed in some U.S. states, such as California, Alabama, Florida, or New York; however, triple towing is permitted in Texas if the combined length does not exceed .

===Fifth-wheel trailer===
A fifth-wheel is a travel trailer supported by a hitch in the centre of the bed of a pickup truck instead of a hitch at the back of a vehicle. The special hitch used for fifth-wheels is a smaller version of the one used on 18-wheeler trucks and can be connected by simply driving (backing) the tow vehicle under the trailer. Fifth-wheel trailers are popular with full-time recreational vehicle enthusiasts, who often live in them for several months in one place, using their pickup truck tow vehicle for local errands. A fifth-wheel trailer tows more securely than a traditional travel trailer because the hitch weight sits directly over the pickup truck&#x27;s rear axle or tires. Since part of a fifth wheel sits in the bed of the pickup, it reduces the overall length of the vehicle-and-trailer combination while allowing the same room as a comparable-length travel trailer. Additionally, the hitch&#x27;s location in the pickup&#x27;s bed reduces the risk of jackknifing and allows for more maneuverability when backing. Because of the greater room available on the roads in North America, these vehicles are more popular in the United States and Canada than in Europe or other parts of the world. For uneven terrain, a gooseneck hitch is an option for fifth-wheel trailers.

The downside is that the hitch takes up room in the pickup truck&#x27;s cargo bed regardless of whether the trailer is hitched or not. The hitch can be unbolted from the bed but this takes a lot more time and effort than the unhitch operation.

===Off-road trailer===
Off-road travel trailers, also called 4x4 trailers, tentrax, and jeep trailers, are built specifically for exploring the extreme backcountry without having the restriction of paved highways or gravel roads. These travel trailers are designed to handle rough terrain. Many off-road travel trailers are equipped with tents, beds, skid plates, large tires and long stroke independent suspensions, lift kits, and articulation systems.

===Toy hauler===
Innovation in the travel trailer types is the &quot;toy hauler&quot; or &quot;toy box&quot;. Half living area and a half garage, these trailers allow other, smaller vehicles to be brought to the countryside. A folding rear ramp gives access for motorcycles, all-terrain vehicles, personal watercraft or racecars. A generator provides power for the equipment.

===Double-decker trailer===
A double-decker trailer is a two-level travel trailer. When travelling the trailer is only as high as a regular trailer, but when set up it can be increased in height to two full levels. They are often used in motion picture production as portable dressing rooms.

==United Kingdom==
The National Caravan Council estimates that the caravan industry, which includes motorhomes, touring caravans (caravans designed to be hitched to a car and towed to a site), and static caravans and mobile homes (caravans designed to be transported to a permanent site, where they are anchored to the ground), is now worth over (/) to the British economy alone, with the manufacture of caravans worth in excess of (/). The growth in popularity of caravanning has been enhanced by improvements in caravan quality and caravan site facilities, making caravan holidays possible at any time of the year.

There are two main organisations that many caravanners join in the United Kingdom: the Caravan and Motorhome Club, established in 1907, and the Camping and Caravanning Club (&#x27;The Caravan Club Limited&#x27;), established in 1901. Both clubs offer a range of services, including exclusive club sites, preferential rates, advice, insurance, and community activities including regional and national rallies.

In the UK, caravan insurance is not compulsory but is recommended due to the high value of touring caravans.

Under tax regulations, caravans are considered wasting chattel and are exempt from capital gains tax.

==Australia==
In Australia, camper trailers are common alongside the traditional caravan. Camper trailers differentiate themselves from similar products due to their ability to go off-road. They feature large water holding tanks, batteries for electricity and off-road suspension.

==New Zealand==
In New Zealand the term caravan is used, but campervans or motorhomes may be called motor caravans. New Zealand has hundreds of free camping sites and campervans and motorhomes are popular ways to access the sites. However, at the end of 2023 they enacted tighter regulations – especially in regards to the toilet facilities. The New Zealand Motor Caravan Association notes RVs must have certain minimum standards for certification.

==Amenities==
A mid-range, modern travel trailer may contain the following features:
* Beds, some of which convert to daytime seating
* Electricity supplied by battery or external hookup
* Gas- or electric-powered refrigerator
* Gas- or electric-powered stove, oven and grill
* Gas- or electric-powered water heater
* Microwave
* Powered wheel mover system (integrated or clip-on) to enable parking once unhitched
* Audio player or video player (such as a radio, CD player, DVD player, digital audio player)
* Shower
* Television (with an aerial, satellite dish, or both)
* Toilet with removable blackwater (sewage) disposal tank and flush-water tank
* Heater
* Slide-outs, which extend the width of a room or space, such as a dinette or bedroom extension
Travel trailers (especially North American ones) may also contain the following:
* Air conditioning
* Awning or screen room
* Washing machine and clothes dryer
* External barbecue points 
* Tow hitch stabilizers
* Separate wastewater tanks for greywater (wash water) and blackwater (sewage)
==Reception==
Due to the maximum speed limit on single carriageways for caravans on the United Kingdom&#x27;s crowded and often narrow roads, caravans are seen as a nuisance by some motorists. The motoring journalist and presenter Jeremy Clarkson is well known for his gleeful hatred of caravans, and has physically destroyed several of them on the BBC television programme &quot;Top Gear&quot; since the show&#x27;s relaunch in 2002, leading to complaints from the caravan community.

<text>Surya Bahadur Thapa (; March 21, 1928 – April 15, 2015) was a Nepali politician and a five-time Prime Minister of Nepal. He served under three different kings in a political career lasting more than 50 years.

Thapa was selected as a member of advisory council in 1958 and was elected as the chairperson. Later he was appointed to the Upper house in 1959 and appointed chair of the Council of Ministers from 1963 to 1964. He went on to serve four further terms: 1965–69, 1979–83, 1997–98, and again in 2003 before leaving Rastriya Prajatantra Party (RPP) in November 2004.

Surya Thapa was the first prime minister under the Panchayat System of Nepal. In his later years, he was a leader of RPP. He died on 15 April 2015 from respiratory failure while undergoing surgery.

== Biography ==

Thapa was born on March 21, 1928, in the village of Muga in Dhankuta district. He began his political career in the underground student movement in 1950. In November 1958, he was selected to the national assembly as an independent, and became Chairman of the Advisory Council. In 1959, Thapa was elected to the Upper House. He was appointed Minister of Agriculture, Forest and Industry under the newly formed Panchayat system. Subsequently, he served as Member of National Legislature and Minister of Finance and Economic Affairs.

=== First term ===
Despite not even standing for election in 1963, Thapa was nominated to the National Panchyat by King Mahendra and was appointed chair of the Council of Ministers and Minister of Finance, Law, Justice and General Administration. During this period he was instrumental in abolishing &quot;Land-Birta-System&quot; and set strategies to promote land reform by consolidating tenancy rights of the tenants. Thapa was responsible for &quot;Muluki-Ain&quot;, through which he attempted to eradicate the practice of an untouchable caste and promote women&#x27;s suffrage, among other social activism.

=== Second term ===
In 1966, Thapa was again appointed prime minister under the modified Constitution of Nepal. He was responsible for expanding the coverage of the constitution of 1962, and promulgated its second amendment to make it &quot;people oriented&quot;. In 1967, Thapa tendered his resignation, saying that the long tenure of one prime minister was undemocratic in the development of the country.

=== Third term ===
In October 1972, Thapa was arrested and imprisoned in Nakhhu Jail when he demanded political reform in his Itum-Bahal public address. The speech promoted a 13-point resolution, which included democratic changes in the Constitution and restoring rights to the people with democratic elections. He went on a 21-day hunger strike in March 1974, demanding major political reform in the country.

After pro-democracy demonstrations in 1979, Nepali voters chose to uphold the Panchayat system in a referendum in 1980, and King Birendra appointed Thapa Prime Minister on June 1, 1980. The referendum was accompanied by a general amnesty for political prisoners.

Thapa maintained the position through a parliamentary election in 1981. After serving a further two years, he resigned in 1983 when his government lost a no confidence vote.

Between 1983 and 1990, Thapa often spoke on politics, criticizing those who were against democratic reform and urging the strengthening of political and economic development processes in the country. Thapa&#x27;s statements were quoted in many leading national newspapers. There was an attempt to assassinate one of the editors (Padam Thakurathi) who published Thapa&#x27;s views. An attempt was made to assassinate Thapa himself while he was traveling through Jhallari, West Nepal.

=== Fourth term ===
In 1990, the People&#x27;s Movement led to the institution of a constitutional democracy system of government with multiple political parties. Thapa started the Rastriya Prajantra Party (RPP) and was elected chairman of the party four years later. The party did not win the 1991 or 1994 elections, but after two successive governments suffered no-confidence motions within a year, King Birendra asked Thapa to form a new coalition government on October 7, 1997. The next February, Thapa&#x27;s government survived a no-confidence vote, ending the year-long constitutional crisis. Thapa then conceded the prime ministership to his coalition partner, Girija Prasad Koirala of the Nepali Congress.

=== Fifth and Final term ===
In 2002, Thapa presided over the Third National Convention of RPP in Pokhara which paved the way for new leadership within the RPP Party. In June 2003, he was appointed Prime Minister of Nepal for the sixth time. During this tenure as prime Minister, he also held the Defense Minister position. Under Thapa, the government offered women special reservations and quotas in government for the first time, via the Public Service Commission. Special quotas were also provided to the under-privileged Dalits and Janajatis for higher education.

Under Thapa&#x27;s tenure, the government offered the Maoists a 75-point socio-economic and political reform package during peace talks. However, the peace talks failed. To counter the persistent bloody attacks on the police, army, and civilians, Thapa set up the Unified Command. Under the program, the police, army, and armed security functioned as a cohesive team to combat terrorism in the country. Thapa secured arms, military hardware, and aircraft for the army from donor countries (India, USA, and Great Britain) as military aid. When the country was reeling under civil war, he remained adamant that no commissions should be made on arms, unlike his predecessors. All arms procured during this period were under grant aid.

In November 2003, Thapa as the Chairman of the SAARC, urged the Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee and Pakistani President Zafarullah Khan Jamali to participate in the SAARC Summit in Islamabad. His active participation and persuasion as the SAARC Chairman brought both these nuclear countries to table at the summit. Thapa also became the first Nepali Prime Minister to make an official visit to the Druk Kingdom of Bhutan. Several bilateral agreements were initiated with the SAARC countries during this historic visit.

=== Resignation ===
On May 7, 2004, Thapa resigned after to a street protest staged by the five party alliance. In his resignation speech to the nation, he insisted that he would continue to play an active role to forge national consensus. Thapa lead a caretaker government for 25 days as the parties failed to nominate a consensual individual to the post of the prime minister. He officially stepped down on June 2.

In August 2004, Thapa made his first public statement after his resignation, asking the party leadership to call for a Special General Convention. The Special General Convention was never called, however. Thapa then proposed the Broader National Political Conference amongst all democratic political parties in order to create an alternative democratic force in the country against the new Maoist government.

Rastriya Janshakti Party emerged from a split in the Rastriya Prajatantra Party, as Thapa left RPP on November 4, 2004. On November 19, 2004, Thapa and his followers opened a contact office in Balutwar, Kathmandu, to organise a &quot;broad political conference&quot; and coordinate the construction of a new party. The RJP was founded on March 13, 2005. The political conference was, however, postponed due to the imposition of emergency rule by King Gyanendra on February 1, 2005.

RJP had expressed differences with King Gyanendra after the February 1, 2005, coup on political appointments in the local administrations. RJP accused the King of eliminating the forces working for constitutional monarchy, through his political actions. At the time, RJP tried to profile itself as a centrist party, in between positions advocating direct monarchical rule and republic. During the Loktantra Andolan, the RJP suggested that the King Gyanendra would initiate talks with constitutional forces. When the King was stripped of his political powers by the interim parliament, RJP did not object, and in November 2006, the Prajatantrik Nepal Party led by Keshar Bahadur Bista merged into RJP.

Ahead of the Constituent Assembly election, RJP proposed having a mixed election system, with 75 district representatives and 230 members elected through proportional representation. The party also proposed creating an &quot;Ethnic Assembly&quot; as the upper house of parliament.

== Later years and death ==

On February 6, 2008, Thapa initiated unity talks with the leader of RPP, Pashupati Shamsher Jang Bahadur Rana. In a joint press conference, both Thapa and Rana agreed to unite RJP-RPP as one single party. On March 6, he declared that his party was not monarchist, but would accept the verdict of the voters. RJP MPs had previously boycotted a vote in the interim parliament on making Nepal a republic. Thapa had dubbed the vote &quot;an attack on the fundamental norms of democracy&quot;.

Thapa died on April 15, 2015, aged 87 in Delhi, India, from respiratory failure while undergoing surgery. He is survived by three daughters and a son, Sunil Bahadur Thapa, a former minister of commerce and supply.

<text>Julius Kambarage Nyerere (; 13 April 1922 – 14 October 1999) was a Tanzanian politician, anti-colonial activist, and political theorist. He governed Tanganyika as prime minister from 1961 to 1962 and then as president from 1962 to 1964, after which he led its successor state, Tanzania, as president from 1964 to 1985. He was a founding member and chair of the Tanganyika African National Union (TANU) party and of its successor, Chama Cha Mapinduzi, from 1954 to 1990. Ideologically an African nationalist and African socialist, he promoted a political philosophy known as Ujamaa.

Born in Butiama, Mara, then in the British colony of Tanganyika, Nyerere was the son of a Zanaki chief. After completing his schooling, he studied at Makerere College in Uganda and then Edinburgh University in Scotland. In 1952 he returned to Tanganyika, married, and worked as a school teacher. In 1954, he helped form TANU, through which he campaigned for Tanganyikan independence from the British Empire. Influenced by the Indian independence leader Mahatma Gandhi, Nyerere preached non-violent protest to achieve this aim. Elected to the Legislative Council in the 1958–1959 elections, Nyerere then led TANU to victory at the 1960 general election, becoming prime minister. Negotiations with the British authorities resulted in Tanganyikan independence in 1961. In 1962, Tanganyika became a republic, with Nyerere elected as its first president. His administration pursued decolonisation and the &quot;Africanisation&quot; of the civil service while promoting unity between indigenous Africans and the country&#x27;s Asian and European minorities. He encouraged the formation of a one-party state and unsuccessfully pursued the Pan-Africanist formation of an East African Federation with Uganda and Kenya. A 1963 mutiny within the army was suppressed with British assistance.

Following the Zanzibar Revolution of 1964, the island of Zanzibar was unified with Tanganyika to form Tanzania. After this, Nyerere placed a growing emphasis on national self-reliance and socialism. Although his socialism differed from that promoted by Marxism–Leninism, Tanzania developed close links with Mao Zedong&#x27;s China. In 1967, Nyerere issued the Arusha Declaration which outlined his vision of ujamaa. Banks and other major industries and companies were nationalized; education and healthcare were significantly expanded. Renewed emphasis was placed on agricultural development through the formation of communal farms, although these reforms hampered food production and left areas dependent on food aid. His government provided training and aid to anti-colonialist groups fighting white-minority rule throughout southern Africa and oversaw Tanzania&#x27;s 1978–1979 war with Uganda which resulted in the overthrow of Ugandan President Idi Amin. In 1985, Nyerere stood down and was succeeded by Ali Hassan Mwinyi, who reversed many of Nyerere&#x27;s policies. He remained chair of Chama Cha Mapinduzi until 1990, supporting a transition to a multi-party system, and later served as mediator in attempts to end the Burundian Civil War.

Nyerere was a controversial figure. Across Africa he gained widespread respect as an anti-colonialist and in power received praise for ensuring that, unlike many of its neighbours, Tanzania remained stable and unified in the decades following independence. His construction of the one-party state and use of detention without trial led to accusations of dictatorial governance, while he has also been blamed for economic mismanagement. He is held in deep respect within Tanzania, where he is often referred to by the Swahili honorific (&quot;teacher&quot;) and described as the &quot;Father of the Nation&quot;.

== Early life ==

===Childhood: 1922–1934===

Julius Kambarage Nyerere was born on 13 April 1922 in Mwitongo, an area of the village of Butiama in Tanganyika&#x27;s Mara Region. He was one of 25 surviving children of Nyerere Burito, the chief of the Zanaki people. Burito had been born in 1860 and given the name &quot;Nyerere&quot; (&quot;caterpillar&quot; in Zanaki) after a plague of worm caterpillars infested the local area at the time of his birth. Burito had been appointed chief in 1915, installed in that position by the German imperial administrators of what was then German East Africa; his position was also endorsed by the incoming British imperial administration. Burito had 22 wives, of whom Julius&#x27; mother, Mugaya Nyang&#x27;ombe, was the fifth. She had been born in 1892 and had married the chief in 1907, when she was fifteen. Mugaya bore Burito four sons and four daughters, of which Nyerere was the second child; two of his siblings died in infancy.

These wives lived in various huts around Burito&#x27;s cattle corral, in the centre of which was his roundhouse. The Zanaki were one of the smallest of the 120 tribes in the British colony and were then sub-divided among eight chiefdoms; they would only be united under the kingship of Chief Wanzagi Nyerere, Burito&#x27;s half-brother, in the 1960s. Nyerere&#x27;s clan were the Abhakibhweege. At birth, Nyerere was given the personal name &quot;Mugendi&quot; (&quot;Walker&quot; in Zanaki) but this was soon changed to &quot;Kambarage&quot;, the name of a female rain spirit, at the advice of a &quot;omugabhu&quot; diviner. Nyerere was raised into the polytheistic belief system of the Zanaki, and lived at his mother&#x27;s house, assisting in the farming of the millet, maize and cassava. With other local boys he also took part in the herding of goats and cattle. At some point he underwent the Zanaki&#x27;s traditional circumcision ritual at Gabizuryo. As the son of a chief he was exposed to African-administered power and authority, and living in the compound gave him an appreciation for communal living that would influence his later political ideas.

===Schooling: 1934–1942===

The British colonial administration encouraged the education of chiefs&#x27; sons, believing that this would help to perpetuate the chieftain system and prevent the development of a separate educated indigenous elite who might challenge colonial governance. At his father&#x27;s prompting, Nyerere began his education at the Native Administration School in Mwisenge, Musoma in February 1934, about 35 km from his home. This placed him in a privileged position; most of his contemporaries at Butiama could not afford a primary education. His education was in Swahili, a language he had to learn while there. Nyerere excelled at the school, and after six months his exam results were such that he was allowed to skip a grade. He avoided sporting activities and preferred to read in his dormitory during free time.

While at the school he also underwent the Zanaki tooth filing ritual to have his upper-front teeth sharpened into triangular points. It may have been at this point that he took up smoking, a habit he retained for several decades. He also began to take an interest in Roman Catholicism, although was initially concerned about abandoning the veneration of his people&#x27;s traditional gods. With school friend Mang&#x27;ombe Marwa, Nyerere trekked 14 miles to the Nyegina Mission Centre, run by the White Fathers, to learn more about the Christian religion; although Marwa eventually stopped, Nyerere continued. His elementary schooling ended in 1936; his final exam results were the highest of any pupil in the Lake Province and Western Province region.

His academic excellence allowed him to gain a government scholarship to attend the elite Tabora Government School, a secondary school in Tabora. There, he again avoided sporting activities but helped to set up a Boy Scout&#x27;s brigade after reading &quot;Scouting for Boys&quot;. Fellow pupils later remembered him as being ambitious and competitive, eager to come top of the class in examinations. He used books in the school library to advance his knowledge of the English language to a high standard. He was heavily involved in the school&#x27;s debating society, and teachers recommended him as head prefect, but this was vetoed by the headmaster, who described Nyerere as being &quot;too kind&quot; for the position. In keeping with Zanaki custom, Nyerere entered into an arranged marriage with a girl named Magori Watiha, who was then only three or four years old but had been selected for him by his father. At the time they continued to live apart. In March 1942, during Nyerere&#x27;s final year at Tabora, his father died; the school refused his request to return home for the funeral. Nyerere&#x27;s brother, Edward Wanzagi Nyerere, was appointed as their father&#x27;s successor. Nyerere then decided to be baptised as a Roman Catholic; at his baptism, he took on the name &quot;Julius&quot;, although later stated that it was &quot;silly&quot; that Catholics should &quot;take a name other than a tribal name&quot; on baptism.

===Makerere College, Uganda: 1943–1947===

In October 1941, Nyerere completed his secondary education and decided to study at Makerere College in the Ugandan city of Kampala. He secured a bursary to fund a teacher training course there, arriving in Uganda in January 1943. At Makerere, he studied alongside many of East Africa&#x27;s most talented students, although spent little time socialising with others, instead focusing on his reading. He took courses in chemistry, biology, Latin, and Greek. Deepening his Catholicism, he studied the Papal Encyclicals and read the work of Catholic philosophers like Jacques Maritain; most influential however were the writings of the liberal British philosopher John Stuart Mill. He won a literary competition with an essay on the subjugation of women, for which he had applied Mill&#x27;s ideas to Zanaki society. Nyerere was also an active member of the Makere Debating Society, and established a branch of Catholic Action at the university.

In July 1943, he wrote a letter to the &quot;Tanganyika Standard&quot; in which he discussed the ongoing Second World War and argued that capitalism was alien to Africa and that the continent should turn to &quot;African socialism&quot;. His letter went on to state that &quot;the educated African should take the lead&quot; in moving the population towards a more explicitly socialist model. Molony thought that the letter &quot;serves to mark the beginnings of Nyerere&#x27;s political maturation, chiefly in absorbing and developing the views of leading black thinkers of the time.&quot; In 1943, Nyerere, Andrew Tibandebage, and Hamza Kibwana Bakari Mwapachu founded the Tanganyika African Welfare Association (TAWA) to assist the small number of Tanganyikan students at Makerere. TAWA was allowed to die off, and in its place Nyerere revived the largely moribund Makerere chapter of the Tanganyika African Association (TAA), although this too had ceased functioning by 1947. Although aware of racial prejudice from the white colonial minority, he insisted on treating people as individuals, recognising that many white individuals were not bigoted towards indigenous Africans. After three years, Nyerere graduated from Makerere with a diploma in education.

===Early teaching: 1947–1949===

On leaving Makerere, Nyerere returned home to Zanaki territory to build a house for his widowed mother, before spending his time reading and farming in Butiama. He was offered teaching positions at both the state-run Tabora Boys&#x27; School and the mission-run St Mary&#x27;s, but chose the latter despite it offering a lower wage. He took part in a public debate with two teachers from the Tabora Boys&#x27; School, in which he argued against the statement that &quot;The African has benefitted more than the European since the partition of Africa&quot;; after winning the debate, he was subsequently banned from returning to the school. Outside school hours, he gave free lessons in English to older locals, and also gave talks on political issues. He also worked briefly as a price inspector for the government, going into stores to check what they were charging, although quit the position after the authorities ignored his reports about false pricing. While in Tabora, the woman whom Nyerere was arranged to marry, Magori Watiha, was sent to live with him to pursue her primary education there, although he forwarded her to live with his mother. Instead, he began courting Maria Gabriel, a teacher at Nyegina Primary School in Musoma; although from the Simbiti tribe, she shared with Nyerere a devout Catholicism. He proposed marriage to her and they became informally engaged at Christmas 1948.

In Tabora, he intensified his political activities, joining the local branch of the TAA and becoming its treasurer. The branch opened a co-operative shop selling basic goods like sugar, flour, and soap. In April 1946 he attended the organisation&#x27;s conference in Dar es Salaam, where the TAA officially declared itself committed to supporting independence for Tanganyika. With Tibandebage he worked on rewriting the TAA&#x27;s constitution and used the group to mobilise opposition to Colonial Paper 210 in the district, believing that the electoral reform was designed to further privilege the white minority. At St Mary&#x27;s, Father Richard Walsh—an Irish priest who was director of the school—encouraged Nyerere to consider additional education in the United Kingdom. Walsh convinced Nyerere to take the University of London&#x27;s matriculation examination, which he passed with second division in January 1948. He applied for funding from the Colonial Development and Welfare Scheme and was initially unsuccessful, although succeeded on his second attempt, in 1949. He agreed to study abroad, although expressed some reluctance because it meant that he would no longer be able to provide for his mother and siblings.

===Edinburgh University: 1949–1952===
In April 1949, Nyerere flew from Dar es Salaam to Southampton, England. He then travelled, by train, from London to Edinburgh. In the city, Nyerere took lodgings in a building for &quot;colonial persons&quot; in The Grange suburb. Starting his studies at the University of Edinburgh, he began with a short course in chemistry and physics and also passed Higher English in the Scottish Universities Preliminary Examination. In October 1949 he was accepted for entry to study for a Master of Arts degree at the University of Edinburgh&#x27;s Faculty of Arts; his was an Ordinary Degree of Master of Arts, which was considered an undergraduate degree, the equivalent of a Bachelor of Arts in most English universities.

In 1949, Nyerere was one of only two black students from the British East African territories studying in Scotland. In the first year of his MA studies, he took courses in English literature, political economy, and social anthropology; in the latter, he was tutored by Ralph Piddington. In the second, he selected courses in economic history and British history, the latter taught by Richard Pares, whom Nyerere later described as &quot;a wise man who taught me very much about what makes these British tick&quot;. In the third year, he took the constitutional law course run by Lawrence Saunders and moral philosophy. Although his grades were not outstanding, they enabled him to pass all of his courses. His tutor in moral philosophy described him as &quot;a bright and lively member of the class and of the parties&quot;.

Nyerere gained many friends in Edinburgh, and socialised with Nigerians and West Indians living in the city. There are no reports of Nyerere experiencing racial prejudice while in Scotland; although it is possible he did encounter it, many black students in Britain at the time reported that white British students were generally less prejudiced than other sectors of the population. In classes, he was generally treated as the equal of his white fellows, which gave him additional confidence, and may have help mould his belief in multi-racialism. During his time in Edinburgh, he may have engaged in part-time work to support himself and family in Tanganyika; he and other students went on a working holiday to a Welsh farm where they engaged in potato picking. In 1951, he travelled down to London to meet with other Tanganyikan students and attend the Festival of Britain. That same year, he co-wrote an article for &quot;The Student&quot; magazine in which he criticised plans to incorporate Tanganyika into the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland, which he and co-author John Keto noted was designed to further white minority control in the region. In February 1952, he attended a meeting on the issue of the Federation that was organised by the World Church Group; among those speaking at the meeting was the medical student—and future Malawian leader—Hastings Banda. In July 1952, Nyerere graduated from the university with an Ordinary Degree of Master of Arts. Leaving Edinburgh that week, he was granted a short British Council Visitorship to study educational institutions in England, basing himself in London.

==Political activism==
===Founding the Tanganyika African National Union: 1952–1955===

Having sailed aboard the SS &quot;Kenya Castle&quot;, Nyerere arrived back in Dar es Salaam in October 1952. He took the train to Mwanza and then a lake steamer to Musoma before reaching Zanaki lands. There, he built a mud-brick house for himself and his fiancé, Maria; they were married at Musoma mission on 24 January 1953. They soon moved to Pugu, closer to Dar es Salaam, when Nyerere was hired to teach history at St Francis&#x27; College, one of the leading schools for indigenous Africans in Tanganyika. In 1953 the couple had their first child, 
Andrew. Nyerere became increasingly involved in politics; in April 1953, he was elected president of the Tanganyika African Association (TAA). His ability to take on the position was influenced by his good oratorical skills and by the fact that he was Zanaki; had he been from one of the larger ethnic groups he may have faced greater opposition from members of rival tribes. Under Nyerere, the TAA gained an increasingly political dimension, devoted to the pursuit of Tanganyikan independence from the British Empire. Nyerere himself was, according to Bjerk, &quot;catapulted to prominence&quot; as &quot;a standard-bearer of the burgeoning independence movement&quot;.

On 7 July 1954 Nyerere, assisted by Oscar Kambona, transformed the TAA into a new political party, the Tanganyika African National Union (TANU). Among the early TANU members were the three sons of Kleist Sykes, Dossa Aziz, and John Rupia, the latter an entrepreneur who had established himself as one of the wealthiest indigenous Africans in the country. Rupia served as the group&#x27;s first treasurer and largely funded the organisation in its early years. The colony&#x27;s governor appointed Nyerere to fill a temporary vacancy on its legislative council generated after David Makwaia was sent to London to serve on the Royal Commission for Land and Population Problems. His first speech at the legislative council dealt with the need for more schools in the country. When he said that he would oppose proposed government regulations to raise salaries for civil servants, the government recalled Makwaia from London to ensure Nyerere&#x27;s removal.

At TANU meetings, Nyerere insisted on the need for Tanganyikan independence, but maintained that the country&#x27;s European and Asian minorities would not be ejected by an African-led independent government. He greatly admired the Indian independence leader Mahatma Gandhi and endorsed Gandhi&#x27;s approach to attaining independence through non-violent protest. The colonial government closely monitored his activities; they had concerns that Nyerere would instigate a violent anti-colonial rebellion akin to the Mau Mau Uprising in neighbouring Kenya.

In August 1954, the United Nations had sent a mission to Tanganyika which subsequently published a report recommending a twenty to twenty-five year timetable for the colony&#x27;s independence. The UN was set to discuss the issue further at a trusteeship council in New York City, with TANU sending Nyerere to be its representative there. At the British government&#x27;s request, the United States agreed to prevent Nyerere staying for more than 24 hours before the meeting or moving outside an eight-block radius of the UN headquarters. Nyerere arrived in the city in March 1955, as part of a trip funded largely by Rupia. To the trusteeship council he said that: &quot;with your help and with the help of the [British] Administering Authority we would be governing ourselves long before twenty to twenty-five years.&quot; This seemed highly ambitious to everyone at the time.

The government pressured Nyerere&#x27;s employer to sack him because of his pro-independence activities. On his return from New York, Nyerere resigned from the school, in part because he did not wish his ongoing employment to cause trouble for the missionaries. In April 1955 he and his wife returned to his Zanaki homestead. He turned down offers of employment from a newspaper and an oil company, instead accepting a job as a translator and tutor for the Maryknoll Fathers, who were preparing a mission amongst the Zanaki.
By the late 1950s, TANU had extended its influence throughout the country and gained considerable support. TANU had 100,000 members in 1955, which had grown to 500,000 by 1957.

===Touring Tanganyika: 1955–1959===

Nyerere returned to Dar es Salaam in October 1955. From then until Tanzania secured independence, he toured the country almost continuously, often in TANU&#x27;s Land Rover. The British colonial Governor of Tanganyika, Edward Twining, disliked Nyerere, regarding him as a racialist who wanted to impose indigenous domination over the European and South Asian minorities. In December 1955, Twining established the &quot;multi-racial&quot; United Tanganyika Party (UTP) to combat TANU&#x27;s African nationalist message. Nyerere nevertheless stipulated that &quot;we are fighting against colonialism, not against the whites&quot;. He befriended members of the white minority, such as Lady Marion Chesham, a U.S.-born widow of a British farmer, who served as a liaison between TANU and Twining&#x27;s government. A 1958 editorial in the TANU newsletter &quot;Sauti ya Tanu&quot; (Voice of TANU) that had been written by Nyerere called on the party&#x27;s members to avoid participating in violence. It also criticised two of the country&#x27;s district commissioners, accusing one of trying to undermine TANU and another of putting a chief on trial for &quot;cooked-up reasons&quot;. In response, the government filed three counts of criminal libel. The trial took almost three months. Nyerere was found guilty, with the judge stipulating that he could either pay a £150 fine or go to prison for six months; he chose the former.

Twining announced that elections for a new legislative council would take place in early 1958. These would be organised around ten constituencies, each electing three members of the council: one indigenous African, one European, and one South Asian. This would end the concentration of political representation entirely with the European minority, but still meant that the three ethnic blocs would receive equal representation despite the fact that indigenous Africans made up over 98% of the country&#x27;s population. For this reason, most of TANU&#x27;s leadership believed that it should boycott the election. Nyerere disagreed. In his view, TANU should participate and seek to secure the majority of the indigenous African representatives to advance their political leverage. If they abstained, he argued, the UTP would win the elections, TANU would be forced to operate entirely outside of government, and it would delay the process of attaining independence. At a January 1958 conference in Tabora, Nyerere convinced TANU to take part. In these elections, which took place over the course of 1958 and 1959, TANU won every seat it contested. Nyerere stood as TANU&#x27;s candidate in the Eastern Province seat against an independent candidate, Patrick Kunambi, securing 2600 votes to Kunambi&#x27;s 800. Some of the European and Asian candidates elected were TANU sympathisers, ensuring that the council was dominated by the party.

===TANU in government: 1959–1961===
In March 1959, the new British Governor of Tanganyika, Richard Turnbull, gave TANU five of the twelve ministerial posts available in the colony&#x27;s government. Turnbull was prepared to work for a peaceful transition to independence. In 1959, Nyerere visited Edinburgh. In 1960, he attended a conference of independent African states in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, at which he presented a paper calling for the formation of an East African Federation. He suggested that Tanganyika could delay its attainment of independence from the British Empire until neighbouring Kenya and Uganda were able to do the same. In his view, it would be much easier for the three countries to unite at the same point as independence than after it, for beyond that point their respective governments might feel that they were losing sovereignty through unification. Many senior TANU members opposed the idea of delaying Tanganyikan independence; the party had been growing, and as of 1960 had over a million members.

In the August 1960 general election, TANU won 70 of the 71 available seats. As TANU&#x27;s leader, Nyerere was called to form a new government; he became its chief minister. That year, British Prime Minister Harold Macmillan gave his &quot;Wind of Change&quot; speech, indicating British willingness to dismantle the empire in Africa. In March 1961, a constitutional conference was held in Dar es Salaam to determine the nature of an independent constitution; both anti-colonial campaigners and British officials attended. As a concession to the UK&#x27;s colonial secretary Iain Macleod, Nyerere agreed that after independence, Tanganyika would retain the British Queen Elizabeth II as its head of state for a year before becoming a republic. In May, Tanganyika achieved self-governance. One of Nyerere&#x27;s first acts as prime minister was to stop the supply of Tanganyikan labourers to South African gold mines. Although this resulted in a loss of around £500,000 a year for Tanganyika, Nyerere regarded it as a necessary act in expressing opposition to the apartheid system of white-minority rule and racial segregation implemented in South Africa.

==Premiership and Presidency of Tanganyika==

===Premiership of Tanganyika: 1961–1962===
On 9 December 1961, Tanganyika gained independence, an event marked by a ceremony at National Stadium. A law was soon presented to the Assembly that would restrict citizenship to indigenous Africans; Nyerere spoke out against the bill, comparing its racialism to the ideas of Adolf Hitler and Hendrik Verwoerd, and threatened to resign if it passed. Six weeks after independence, in January 1962 Nyerere resigned as prime minister, intent on focusing on restructuring TANU and trying to &quot;work out our own pattern of democracy&quot;. Retreating to become a parliamentary back bencher, he appointed close political ally Rashidi Kawawa as the new prime minister. He toured the country, giving speeches in towns and villages in which he emphasised the need for self-reliance and hard work. In 1962, his &quot;alma mater&quot; at Edinburgh awarded Nyerere with a Honorary Degree of Doctor of Laws.

During Tanganyika&#x27;s first year of independence, its government focused largely on domestic problems. Under a government self-help programme, villagers were encouraged to devote a day&#x27;s work a week to a community project, such as constructing roads, wells, schools, and clinics. A national youth service called Jeshi la Kujenga Taifa (JKT – &quot;army to build the country&quot;) was created to encourage young people to engage in public works and paramilitary training. In February 1962, the government announced its desire to convert the pervasive system of freehold land ownership into a leasehold system, the latter of which was deemed to be a better reflection of traditional indigenous ideas about communal land ownership. Nyerere wrote an article, &quot;Ujamaa&quot; (&quot;Familyhood&quot;) in which he explained and praised this policy; in this article he expressed many of his ideas about African socialism. For Nyerere, ujamaa could provide a &quot;national ethic&quot; that was distinct from the colonial era and would help to cement Tanganyika&#x27;s independent course amid the Cold War.

Six months after independence, the government abolished the jobs and salaries of hereditary chiefs, whose positions conflicted with government officials and who were often regarded as too close to the colonial authorities. The government also pursued the &quot;Africanization&quot; of the civil service, giving severance pay to several hundred white British civil servants and appointing indigenous Africans in their place, many of whom were insufficiently trained. Nyerere acknowledged that such affirmative action was discriminatory towards white and Asian citizens, but argued that it was temporarily necessary to redress the imbalance caused by colonialism. By the end of 1963, about half of senior and middle-grade posts in the civil service were held by indigenous Africans.

Over the following year, several Britons accused of racism were deported; concerns were raised about the lack of due process. Nyerere defended the deportations, stating: &quot;for many years we Africans have suffered humiliations in our own country. We are not going to suffer them now.&quot; After the Safari Hotel in Arusha was accused of insulting Guinean President Ahmed Sékou Touré on the latter&#x27;s June 1963 state visit, the government closed it. When the white-dominated Dar es Salaam Club refused admission to 69 TANU members, the government dissolved the club and appropriated its assets. Nyerere avoided becoming personally embroiled in these controversies, which brought accusations of government hypersensitivity from some foreign media.

Opposition to TANU&#x27;s rule formalised into two small political parties: the senior trade unionist Christopher S. K. Tumbo founded the People&#x27;s Democratic Party, while Zuberi Mtemvu formed the African National Congress, which wanted a more racialist anti-colonial stance. The government thought itself vulnerable and in 1962 introduced a law banning workers&#x27; strikes and the Preventative Detention Law, through which it could detain without trial individuals deemed a threat to national security. Nyerere defended this measure, pointing to similar laws in the United Kingdom and India, and stating that the government needed it as a safeguard given the weak state of both the police and army. He expressed the hope that the government would never have to use it, and noted that they were aware how it &quot;could be a convenient tool in the hands of an unscrupulous government&quot;.

The government drew up plans to create a new constitution which would convert Tanganyika from a monarchy with the Queen of Tanganyika as its head of state into a republic with an elected president as head of state. This president would be elected by the population, and they would then appoint a vice president, who would preside over the National Assembly, Tanganyika&#x27;s parliament. Biographer William Edgett Smith later noted that it was &quot;a foregone conclusion&quot; that Nyerere would be selected as TANU&#x27;s candidate for president. In the November presidential election, he secured 98.1% of the vote, defeating Mtemvu. After the election, Nyerere announced that TANU&#x27;s National Executive Committee had voted to ask the party&#x27;s national conference to widen membership to all Tanganyikans. During the anti-colonial struggle, only indigenous Africans had been permitted to join, but Nyerere now stated that it should welcome white and Asian members. He also stipulated that &quot;complete political amnesty&quot; should be granted to anyone expelled from the party since 1954, allowing them to rejoin. In early 1963, Amir Jamal, an Asian Tanganyikan, became the party&#x27;s first non-indigenous member; the white Derek Bryceson became its second. Nyerere welcomed Asians and Europeans into the cabinet to counter potential racial resentment from these minorities. Nyerere saw it as importance to build a &quot;national consciousness&quot; that transcended ethnic and religious lines.

===Presidency of Tanganyika: 1962–1964===
On 9 December 1962, a year after independence, Tanganyika became a republic. Nyerere moved into the State House in Dar es Salaam, the former official residence of British governors. Nyerere disliked life in the building, but remained there until 1966. Nyerere appointed Kawawa his vice president. In 1963, he put his name forward to be Rector of Edinburgh University, vowing to travel to Scotland whenever needed; the position instead went to the actor James Robertson Justice. He made official visits to West Germany, the United States, Canada, Algeria, Scandinavia, Guinea, and Nigeria. In the U.S. he met President John F. Kennedy and although they personally liked each other, he failed to convince Kennedy to toughen his stance on apartheid South Africa.

The early years of Nyerere&#x27;s presidency were preoccupied largely by African affairs. In February 1963, he attended the Afro-Asian Solidarity conference in Moshi, where he cited the recent Congolese situation as an example of the neo-colonialism, describing it as part of a &quot;second&quot; Scramble for Africa. In May, he attended the founding session of the Organisation for African Unity (OAU) at Addis Ababa in Ethiopia, there echoing his previous message, stating that &quot;the real humiliating truth is that Africa is not free; and therefore it is Africa which should take the necessary collective measures to free Africa.&quot; He hosted the OAU&#x27;s Liberation Committee in Dar es Salaam and provided weapons and support to anti-colonial movements active in southern Africa.

Nyerere endorsed the Pan-Africanist idea of unifying Africa as a single state, although he disagreed with the Ghanaian President Kwame Nkrumah&#x27;s view that this could be achieved quickly. Instead, Nyerere stressed the idea of forming regional confederations as short-term steps towards the eventual unification of the continent. Pursuing these ideals, in June 1963 Nyerere met with Kenyan President Jomo Kenyatta and Ugandan President Milton Obote in Nairobi, where they agreed to unite their respective countries into a single East African Federation by the end of the year. This, however, never materialised. In December 1963, Nyerere lamented that this failure was the major disappointment of the year. Instead, the East African Community was launched in 1967, to facilitate some cooperation between the three countries. Later, Nyerere saw his inability to establish an East African Federation as the biggest failure of his career.

Nyerere was concerned by developments in Zanzibar, a pair of islands off of Tanganyika&#x27;s coast. He noted that it was &quot;very vulnerable to outside influences&quot;, which could in turn impact Tanganyika. Nyerere was keen to keep Cold War conflicts between the U.S. and Soviet Union out of eastern Africa. Zanzibar secured independence from the British Empire in 1963, and in January 1964 the Zanzibar Revolution took place, in which the Arab Sultan Jamshid bin Abdullah was overthrown and replaced by a government consisting largely of indigenous Africans. Nyerere was taken by surprise by the revolution. Like Kenya and Uganda, he quickly recognised the new government, although allowed the deposed Sultan to land in Tanganyika and from there fly to London. At the request of the new Zanzibar government, he sent 300 policemen to the island to help restore order.

====Facing mutiny====

In January 1964, Nyerere ended affirmative action hiring for the civil service. Believing the colonial imbalance to have been redressed, he stated: &quot;it would be wrong for us to continue to distinguish between Tanganyikan citizens on any grounds other than those of character and ability to do specific tasks&quot;. Many trade unionists denounced the discontinuation of the policy and it proved the catalyst for an army mutiny. On 20 January, a small group of soldiers in the First Battalion calling themselves the Army Night Freedom Fighters launched an uprising, demanding the dismissal of their white officers and a pay rise. The mutineers left the Colito Barracks and entered Dar es Salaam, where they seized the State House. Nyerere narrowly escaped, hiding in a Roman Catholic mission for two days. The mutineers captured senior government figure Oscar Kambona, forcing him to dismiss all white officers and appoint the indigenous Elisha Kavana as head of the Tanganyika Rifles. The Second Battalion, based in Tabora, also mutineed, with Kambona acceding to their demands to appoint the indigenous Mrisho Sarakikya as their battalion leader. Having agreed to many of their demands, Kambona convinced the First Battalion mutineers to return to their barracks. Similar yet smaller mutinies broke out in Kenya and Uganda, with the governments of both calling for British military assistance in suppressing the uprisings.

On 22 January, Nyerere came out of hiding; the next day he gave a press conference stating that Tanganyika&#x27;s reputation had been damaged by the mutiny and that he would not call for military assistance from the UK. Two days later, he requested British military assistance, which was granted. On 25 January, 60 British Royal Marines were helicoptered into the city, where they landed next to the Colito Barracks; the mutineers soon surrendered. In the wake of the mutiny, Nyerere disbanded the First Battalion and dismissed hundreds of soldiers from the Second Battalion. Concerned about dissent more broadly, he discharged about ten percent of the 5000-strong police force, and oversaw the arrest of around 550 people under the Preventative Detention Act, although most were swiftly released. He denounced the ringleaders of the mutiny for trying to &quot;intimidate our nation at the point of a gun&quot;, and fourteen of them were given sentences of between five and fifteen years imprisonment.

As the British marines left, he brought in the Nigerian Army&#x27;s Third Battalion to keep order. Nyerere attributed the mutiny to the fact that his government had failed to do enough to change the army since colonial times: &quot;We changed the uniforms a bit, we commissioned a few Africans, but at the top they were still solidly British... You could never consider it an army of the people.&quot; Acknowledging some of the mutineers&#x27; demands, he appointed Sarakikya as the new commander of the army and raised troop wages. After the mutiny, Nyerere&#x27;s government became increasingly focused on security, placing TANU personnel into the army as well as state-owned industry to entrench party control throughout the country.

==Presidency of Tanzania==

===Unification with Zanzibar: 1964===

Following the Zanzibari Revolution, Abeid Karume declared himself president of a one-party state and began redistributing Arab-owned land among black African peasants. Hundreds of Arabs and Indians left, as did most of the island&#x27;s British community. Western powers were reluctant to recognise Karume&#x27;s government, whereas the Soviet Union, Eastern Bloc, and People&#x27;s Republic of China quickly did so and offered the country aid. Nyerere was angry at this Western response as well as the wider Western failure to appreciate why black Zanzibaris had revolted in the first place.

In April he visited Karume; the following day they announced the political unification of Tanganyika and Zanzibar. Nyerere dismissed suggestions that this had anything to do with Cold War power struggles, presenting it as a response to Pan-Africanist ideology: &quot;Unity in our continent does not have to come via Moscow or Washington.&quot; Later biographer William Edgett Smith however suggested that a key reason for Nyerere&#x27;s desire for unification was to prevent Zanzibar falling into a Cold War proxy conflict akin to those then raging in Congo and Vietnam.

An interim constitution for the &quot;United Republic of Tanganyika and Zanzibar&quot; presented Nyerere as the country&#x27;s president, with Karume as its first vice president and Rashidi Kawawa as its second vice president. In August, the government launched a competition to find a new name for the country; two months later it announced that the winning proposal was &quot;United Republic of Tanzania&quot;. There was no immediate change to the structure of the Zanzibari government; Karume and his Revolutionary Council remained in charge, and there was no merging of TANU and the Afro-Shirazi Party. There would be no local or parliamentary elections on the island for many years. Zanzibaris made up only 350,000 out of Tanzania&#x27;s total population of 13 million, although from 1967 they were given seven of the 22 cabinet positions and directly appointed 40 of the country&#x27;s 183 members of parliament. Nyerere explained this disproportionately high representation by stressing the need for sensitivity to the islanders&#x27; national pride; in 1965, he stated that &quot;The Zanzibaris are a proud people. No one has ever intended that they should become simply the Republic&#x27;s eighteenth region.&quot;

Karume was erratic and unpredictable. He was a source of repeated embarrassment to Nyerere, who tolerated him for the sake of Tanzanian unity. In one instance in August 1969, Zanzibari authorities arrested 14 men whom they accused of plotting a coup. Mainland authorities had assisted in the arrests, but—contrary to Nyerere&#x27;s intentions—the arrested men were tried in secret and four of them secretly executed. Nyerere was further embarrassed by the habit of Karume and other Zanzibari Revolutionary Council members for pressuring Arab girls into marriage and then arresting their relatives to ensure compliance. As a result of rising international prices in cloves, Karume amassed £30 million in foreign exchange reserves, which he kept from the central Tanzanian government. In April 1972, Karume was assassinated by four gunmen.

===Domestic and foreign affairs: 1964–1966===

In the September 1965 general election, a presidential vote took place across Tanzania, although parliamentary elections occurred only on the mainland and not on Zanzibar. Although the one-party state meant that only TANU candidates could stand, the party&#x27;s national executive selected multiple candidates for all but six seats, providing some democratic choice for voters. Two ministers, six junior ministers, and nine backbenchers lost their seats and were replaced. Both Derek Bryceson and Amur Jamal, the two non-indigenous cabinet members, were re-elected over black opponents. Nyerere stood unopposed in the presidential election, although the ballot allowed space to vote against his candidacy; ultimately he secured nearly 97% support.

Tanzania experienced rapid population growth; the December 1967 census revealed a 35% population increase since 1957. This rising number of children made the government&#x27;s desire for universal primary education more difficult to achieve. Observing that a small sector of the population were able to attain a high level of education, he grew concerned that they would form an elitist group apart from the rest of the people. In 1964 he stated that &quot;some of our citizens still have large amounts of money spent on their education, while others have none. Those who receive that privilege therefore have a duty to repay the sacrifice which others have made.&quot; In 1965, it was made mandatory for all secondary school graduates to perform two years of service in the JKT. In October 1966, around 400 university students marched to State House to protest this. Nyerere spoke to the crowd in defence of the measure, and agreed to reduce government salaries, including his own. That year, Nyerere ceased using State House as his permanent residence, moving into a newly built private home on the seafront at Msasani.

====Foreign affairs====
Although Western powers urged Nyerere not to accept support from China, then governed by Mao Zedong, in August 1964 Nyerere allowed seven Chinese instructors and four interpreters to work with his army for six months. Responding to Western disapproval, he noted that most of Tanzania&#x27;s military officers were British trained and that he had recently signed an agreement with West Germany to train an air wing. Over the following years, China became the main beneficiary of Tanzania&#x27;s foreign relations. In February 1965, Nyerere made an eight-day state visit to China, opining that their socio-economic projects in moving an agrarian country towards socialism had much relevance for Tanzania. Nyerere was fascinated by Mao&#x27;s China because it espoused the egalitarian values he shared; he was also inspired by the government&#x27;s emphasis on frugality and economy. In June, Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai visited Dar es Salaam. China provided Tanzania with millions of pounds in loans and grants, and invested in a range of projects including a textile mill near Dar es Salaam, a farm implement factory, an experimental farm, and a radio transmitter. Seeking financial support to build a railway that would connect Zambia to the coast and through Tanzania, he secured Chinese backing in 1970 after Western countries refused to finance the operation.

In the early 1960s, Nyerere had private telephone lines installed linking him to Kenyatta and Obote, although these were later eliminated in a cost-saving exercise. 
Although the East African Federation that Nyerere desired failed to develop, he still pursued greater integration between Tanzania, Uganda, and Kenya, in 1967 co-founding the East African Community, a common market and administrative union, which was headquartered in Arusha. Nyerere wrote an introduction for &quot;Not Yet Uhuru&quot;, the 1967 autobiography of Kenyan leftist politician Jaramogi Oginga Odinga.
Nyerere&#x27;s Tanzania welcomed various liberation groups from southern Africa, such as FRELIMO, to set up operations in the country to work towards overthrowing the colonial and white-minority governments of these countries. Nyerere&#x27;s government had warm relations with the neighbouring Zambian government of Kenneth Kaunda. Conversely, it had poor relations with another neighbour, Malawi, whose leader Hastings Banda accused the Tanzanians of supporting government ministers who he claimed opposed him. Nyerere strongly disapproved of Banda&#x27;s co-operation with the Portuguese colonial governments in Angola and Mozambique and the white minority governments of Rhodesia and South Africa.
In 1967, Nyerere&#x27;s government was the first to grant recognition of the newly declared Republic of Biafra, which had seceded from Nigeria. Though three other African states followed, it put Nyerere at odds with most other African nationalists.

At independence, Tanganyika had joined the British Commonwealth. In September 1965, Nyerere threatened to withdraw from the Commonwealth if Britain&#x27;s government negotiated for the independence of Rhodesia with Ian Smith&#x27;s white minority government rather than with representatives of the country&#x27;s black majority. When Smith&#x27;s government unilaterally declared independence in November, Nyerere demanded the British take immediate action to stop them. When the UK did not, in December Tanzania broke off diplomatic relations with them. This resulted in the loss of British aid, but Nyerere thought it necessary to demonstrate that Africans would stand by their word. He stressed that British Tanzanians remained welcome in the country and that violence towards them would not be tolerated. Despite the cessation of diplomatic contact, Tanzania cooperated with the UK in airlifting emergency oil supplies to landlocked Zambia, whose normal oil supply had been cut off by Smith&#x27;s Rhodesian government. In 1970, Tanzania, Uganda, and Zambia all threatened to leave the Commonwealth after British Prime Minister Edward Heath appeared to resume arms sales to South Africa.

Relations were also strained with the United States. In November 1964, Kambona publicly announced the discovery of evidence of a U.S.-Portuguese plot to invade Tanzania. The evidence—which consisted of three photostat documents—was labelled a forgery by the U.S. Embassy and after Nyerere returned from a week at Lake Manyara he acknowledged that this was a possibility. After the U.S. launched Operation Dragon Rouge to retrieve white hostages held by rebels in Stanleyville, Congo, Nyerere condemned them, expressing anger that they would go to such efforts to save 1000 white lives while doing nothing to prevent the subjugation of millions of black people in southern Africa. He believed that the operation was designed to bolster the Congolese government of Moise Tshombe, which Nyerere—like many African nationalists—despised. Explaining this antipathy to Tshombe, he said: &quot;try to imagine a Jew who recruits ex-Nazis to go to Israel and assist him in his power struggle. How would the Jews take it?&quot; Relations with the U.S. reached their worst point in January 1965, when Nyerere expelled two members of the U.S. embassy for subversive activities; evidence was not publicly produced to demonstrate their guilt. The U.S. responded by expelling a councillor from the Tanzanian embassy in Washington D.C.; in turn, Tanzania recalled its ambassador, Othman Shariff. After 1965, Tanzanian-U.S. relations gradually improved.

===The Arusha Declaration: 1967–1970===
In January 1967, Nyerere attended a TANU National Executive meeting at Arusha. There, he presented its committee with a new statement of party principles: the Arusha Declaration. This declaration affirmed the government&#x27;s commitment to building a democratic socialist state and stressed the development of an ethos of self-reliance. In Nyerere&#x27;s view, true independence was not possible while the country remained dependent on gifts and loans from other nations. It stipulated that renewed emphasis should be placed on developing the peasant agricultural economy to ensure greater self-sufficiency, even if this meant slower economic growth. After this point, the concept of socialism became central to the government&#x27;s policy formation. To promote the Arusha Declaration, groups of TANU supporters marched through the countryside to raise awareness; in October, Nyerere accompanied one such eight-day march which covered 138 miles in his native Mara district.

The day after the declaration, the government announced the nationalisation of all Tanzanian banks, with compensation provided to their owners. Over the following days, it announced plans to nationalise various insurance companies, import-export firms, mills, and sisal estates, as well as the purchase of majority interest in seven other firms, including those producing cement, cigarettes, beer, and shoes. Some foreign specialists were employed to run these nationalised industries until sufficient numbers of Tanzanians had been trained to take over; the country&#x27;s civil service nevertheless had little experience with economic planning, and eventually foreign companies had to be brought in to administer several nationalised industries. A year after these initial nationalisations, Nyerere praised the Tanzanian Asians for their role in ensuring the successful running of the nationalised banks, stating: &quot;these people deserve the gratitude of our country&quot;.

Nyerere followed his declaration with a series of additional policy papers covering such areas as foreign policy and rural development. &quot;Education for Self-Reliance&quot; stressed that schools should place a new emphasis on teaching agricultural skills. Another, &quot;Socialism and Rural Development&quot;, outlined a three step process for creating &quot;ujamaa&quot; co-operative villages. The first step was to convince farmers to move into a single village, with their crops planted nearby. The second was to establish communal plots where these farmers would experiment working collectively. The third was to establish a communal farm. Nyerere had been inspired by the example of the Ruvuma Development Association (RDA), an agricultural commune formed in 1962, and believed its example could be followed throughout Tanzania. By the end of 1970, there were reportedly a thousand villages in Tanzania referring to themselves as ujamaa. The peasants brought into these new villages often lacked the self-reliant enthusiasm of the RDA members; despite Nyerere&#x27;s hopes, villagization rarely improved agricultural production.

The Arusha Declaration announced the introduction of a code of conduct for TANU and government leaders to adhere to. This forbade them from owning shares or holding directorates in private companies, receiving more than one salary, or owning any houses that they rented to others. Nyerere saw this as necessary to stem the growth of corruption in Tanzania; he was aware of how this problem had become endemic in some African countries like Nigeria and Ghana and regarded it as a threat to his vision of African freedom. To ensure his own compliance with these measures, Nyerere sold his house in Magomeni and his wife donated her poultry farm in Mji Mwema to the local co-operative village. In 1969, Nyerere sponsored a bill to provide gratuities for ministers and regional and area commissioners which could be used as a retirement income for them. The Tanzanian Parliament did not pass the bill into law, the first time that it had rejected legislation backed by Nyerere. The majority of parliamentarians argued that its granting of additional funds to said officials broke the spirit of the Arusha Declaration. Nyerere decided not to push the issue, conceding that parliament had valid concerns.

Although the Arusha Declaration was domestically popular, some politicians spoke against it. In October 1969 a group of army officers and former politicians, including former head of the National Women&#x27;s Organisation Bibi Titi Mohammad and former Labour Minister Michael Kamaliza, were arrested, accused of plotting to kill Nyerere and overthrow the government, convicted, and imprisoned. In 1969, Nyerere made a state visit to Canada. In 1969, Nyerere informed a journalist that he was contemplating retirement from the presidency, hoping to encourage new leadership, although at the same time had a desire to remain in place to oversee the implementation of his ideas. In the 1970 election, Nyerere again stood unopposed, securing 97% support for him to serve another five-year term. Again, parliamentary elections took place on the mainland but not in Zanzibar.

===Economic crises and war with Uganda: 1971–1979===

In the early 1970s, Nyerere&#x27;s government accelerated the &quot;villagization&quot; process. They hoped that doing so would improve agricultural productivity, allowing the country to export more and thus funding the development of light industry so that Tanzania would be able to produce more consumer goods and rely less on imports. Increasingly, farmers who refused to join the communal villages were regarded as opponents of TANU. Police began to round up farmers and forced them to move into the villages. 13 million people were eventually registered to 7000 villages. As a result, rural production was severely disrupted. According to a 1978 government survey, none of the villages had achieved the official targets for agricultural productivity. Many villages were left reliant on famine relief. In contrast to the government&#x27;s intentions, food imports rose dramatically and inflation accelerated. Overall import levels tripled during the 1970s, while exports only doubled. The entire process also damaged Nyerere&#x27;s reputation with the rural population.

The villagization process had greater success in ensuring wider public access to social services. Nyerere&#x27;s government pursued the rapid expansion of healthcare. During the 1970s, the number of health centres more than doubled, reaching 239, while the number of rural dispensaries nearby doubled, reaching 2,600. Education was also expanded, and by 1978 80% of Tanzania&#x27;s children were in school. By 1980, Tanzania was one of the few African countries that had almost eliminated illiteracy. Throughout the 1970s, bribery and embezzlement also became increasingly common in Tanzania; a parliamentary enquiry found that government losses from theft and corruption rose from 10 million shillings in 1975 to nearly 70 million shillings in 1977.

In early 1971, the National Assembly passed a measure authorising the nationalisation of all commercial buildings, apartments, and houses worth more than 100,000 Tanzanian shillings unless the owner resided in them. This measure was designed to stop the real estate profiteering that had grown across much of post-independence Africa. The measure further depleted the wealth of the Tanzanian Asian community, which had invested much in property accumulation; in ensuing months, nearly 15,000 Asians left the country. Various media outlets began complaining increasingly of &quot;kulaks&quot; and &quot;parasites&quot;, fuelling racial tensions around Asian shopkeepers. Many Roman Catholics were angered when the government nationalised Catholic schools and made them non-denominational.

Nyerere&#x27;s government established a Ministry of National Culture and Youth through which to encourage the growth of a distinctly Tanzanian culture. Through organisations it established, such as Radio Tanzania Dar es Salaam and the Baraza la Muzikila Taifa music council, the government exerted considerable control over the development of popular culture in the country. Juxtaposing idealised rural lifestyles against urban lifestyles which were labelled &quot;decadent&quot;, Nyerere&#x27;s government launched its Operation Vijana in October 1968. This targeted forms of culture considered &quot;decadent&quot;, including soul music, beauty contests, and films and magazines considered to be of an inappropriate nature. In 1973, the government banned most foreign music from being played on national radio programmes. Nyerere believed that homosexuality was alien to Africa and thus Tanzania did not need to legislate against the discrimination of homosexuals.

Freedom of speech was such that government policy was criticised within TANU, in parliament, and in the press. However, those regarded as political subversives were still detained without trial, often in poor conditions. Nyerere rarely initiated such detentions personally, although had the final say on all such arrests. Amnesty International estimated that in 1977, there were a thousand people detained under the Preventative Detention Act, although this had declined to under 100 by 1981. In June 1976, Kambona resigned from the government, ostensibly for health reasons, and relocated to London. He then claimed to have been the victim of a plot to overthrow Nyerere orchestrated by a group opposed to the Arusha Declaration. Nyerere was angered by these statements and asked Kambona to return. It was revealed that Kambona had taken at least $100,000 of public funds with him to Britain; &quot;in absentia&quot; he was charged with treason. By 1977, Kambona had turned against Nyerere, accusing the latter of being a dictator. Over the following years, various MPs were expelled for corruption and other crimes—they claimed, however, that they were being expelled for dissenting from Nyerere&#x27;s positions.

By the mid-1970s, there was much speculation that Nyerere would resign. TANU again nominated him for the presidency in 1975, but in his speech he warned against repeatedly electing the same person. He spoke of the Zanaki concept of &quot;kung&#x27;atuka&quot;, which meant the leaders passing on control to a younger generation. He also proposed that having TANU govern the mainland and ASP govern Zanzibar contravened the concept of a one-party state and called for their merger. This took place in 1977, when they formed Chama Cha Mapinduzi (CCM; &quot;Party of the Revolution&quot;). The new constitution ensured the &quot;de jure&quot; nature of the Tanzanian one-party state. Nyerere began promoting Jumbe as his potential successor.

In 1972, Karume was assassinated; his removal from power in Zanzibar was a relief for Nyerere. Karume was succeeded by Aboud Jumbe, who had a better relationship with Nyerere.
In early 1978, ministers decided to increase their strategies. Students accusing them of abandoning socialist principles and launched protests. After these clashed with police, CCM officials ordered the university to expel 350 protesters, including one of Nyerere&#x27;s sons. In the late 1970s, several members of the military began organising a coup although this was exposed before it could occur and the suspects were imprisoned.

In 1977, Nyerere made his second state visit to the U.S., where President Jimmy Carter hailed him as &quot;a senior statesman whose integrity is unquestioned&quot;. In Atlanta, Nyerere met with African-American civil rights activist Coretta Scott King and accompanied her to the grave of her husband, Martin Luther King Jr. Nyerere remained committed to backing anti-colonialist groups throughout southern Africa, including those fighting the white minority governments in Southern Rhodesia and South Africa and the Portuguese colonial administrations in Mozambique and Angola. In 1980 an election took place in Zimbabwe, resulting in the transition from the white minority government to Robert Mugabe&#x27;s ZANU-PF administration; Tanzania had been supporting ZANU for many years, and Bjerk termed this &quot;a great foreign policy victory for Nyerere&quot;.

====Conflicts with Uganda====
In January 1971, President Obote of Uganda was overthrown by a military coup led by Idi Amin. Nyerere refused to recognise the legitimacy of Amin&#x27;s administration and offered Obote refuge in Tanzania. Shortly after the coup, Nyerere announced the formation of a &quot;people&#x27;s militia&quot;, a type of home guard to improve Tanzania&#x27;s national security. He also allowed exiled Ugandans to set up rebel bases in Tanzania. In 1971, Uganda bombed the Kagera Saw Mill in Tanzania in response to Nyerere&#x27;s support for Obote. When Amin expelled all 50,000 Ugandan Asians from his country in 1972, Nyerere denounced the act as racist. One boatload of Ugandan Asian refugees attempted to land in Tanzania, although Nyerere&#x27;s government refused to permit them, concerned that it would stoke domestic racial tensions. Having been informed of an alleged plot by Amin to overthrow him, Nyerere decided to allow Obote&#x27;s followers to launch an operation to overthrow the Ugandan government. In September 1972, Obote loyalists invaded Uganda from Tanzania, but were routed by Amin&#x27;s security forces. Ugandan forces retaliated by bombing the Tanzanian border towns of Bukoba and Mwanza. Nyerere rejected his generals&#x27; urges to respond with force and agreed to Somali mediation, which resulted in the signing of a peace agreement between Uganda and Tanzania. Nevertheless, relations between Nyerere and Amin remained tense. The Tanzanian President allowed Ugandan rebels to continue to operate in Tanzania, though he urged them to keep a low profile. In 1977, the East African Community that Tanzania had formed with Kenya and Uganda formally collapsed.

In October 1978, Uganda invaded Tanzania, annexing the Kagera Salient. Nyerere decided that Tanzania&#x27;s response should be not only to push the Uganda Army back into Uganda, but to invade the latter and overthrow Amin. To achieve this, he mobilized tens of thousands of civilian-soldiers to aid the regular army. In January 1979, three Tanzanian battalions pushed into Uganda and levelled Mutukula, slaughtering many of the civilians living there. Nyerere was appalled and ordered measures to ensure the Tanzanians would not attack civilian targets in future. Nyerere also lobbied foreign ambassadors to cut off supplies of oil and weapons to Uganda. Over following months, the Tanzanian army pushed further into Uganda. After they took control of Kampala, Amin and many of his followers fled into exile.

During the war, Nyerere had been planning for how to establish a post-Amin government in Uganda. Although Obote retained a level of popularity in Uganda, many other exiles warned him not to restore Obote to the presidency, noting that he had alienated too many sectors of society. Nyerere accepted this advice, and when organising a March 1979 conference for exile groups in Moshi convinced Obote not to attend. The conference decided that it would back Yusuf Lule as an interim replacement. After Amin&#x27;s ouster, Lule was declared president, but was soon removed from office and replaced by Godfrey Binaisa. Binaisa too was only in power for a brief time, and the 1980 general election resulted in Obote once again becoming leader. Nyerere withdrew most of the Tanzanian army, leaving only a small training contingent, although Uganda entered a cycle of civil wars until 1986.

The war cost Tanzania approximately US$500 million, further damaging its fragile economy. There were widespread shortages of consumer goods that encouraged a growth of hoarding and smuggling, while many returning soldiers resorted to criminality. Tanzania&#x27;s Finance Minister Edwin Mtei entered negotiations with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and in early 1979 came to an agreement that the country would receive debt relief in exchange for a program of austerity measures including parastatal restricting, wage freezes, raising interest rates, and relaxing import controls. When Mtei brought the deal to Nyerere, the latter rejected it, seeing it as a rejection of his socialist message. Mtei then resigned. Nyerere viewed the IMF as a neocolonial tool which imposed policies on poorer countries that benefitted their wealthier counterparts.

===Final term in office: 1980–1985===

In the 1980 Tanzanian general election, Nyerere again stood as CCM&#x27;s candidate for the presidency. He took an active role in trying to find a successor. One of his favourites was the Zanzibari Seif Sharif Hamad, whom Nyerere brought into the CCM&#x27;s Central Committee. His relationship with Jumbe became strained, and he encouraged the latter to resign.

By 1985, Ali Hassan Mwinyi, a Zanzibari Muslim, had arisen as the most prominent candidate as Nyerere&#x27;s successor, and Nyerere ultimately agreed to support his candidature. Nyerere stood down as president, with Mwinyi replacing him at the 1985 general election. In doing so, Nyerere—according to A. B. Assensoh—was &quot;one of the few African leaders to have voluntarily, gracefully, and honourably bowed out&quot; of governance. This brought him much respect internationally. Nyerere remained chair of CCM until 1990 and from this position became a vocal critic of Mwinyi&#x27;s policies. Mwinyi wanted to pursue economic liberalisation, removing some of Nyerere&#x27;s favourites from the cabinets who opposed his reforms. These reforms led to inflation and devaluation of currency, destroying the savings of many Tanzanians. Nyerere saw these reforms as an abandonment of his socialist ideals.

==Post-presidential activity==

In July 1987, Nyerere returned to the University of Edinburgh to attend a conference on &quot;The Making of Constitutions and the Development of National Identity&quot;, where he gave the opening address on post-independence Africa.
He was invited to chair an international committee on the economic problems facing the &quot;Global South&quot;, where he worked alongside the future Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh.

In August 1990 Nyerere stepped down as the chair of CCM.
Before stepping down as CCM chair, he advocated Tanzania&#x27;s transition into a multi-party democracy. He believed that the CCM had become too hidebound and corrupt and that competition with other parties would force it to improve. His belief in reform was influenced by his observation of what had occurred in other socialist states: the Eastern Bloc had collapsed, Mikhail Gorbachev had pursued &quot;perestroika&quot; and &quot;glasnost&quot; in the Soviet Union, and Deng Xiaoping had overseen economic reform in China. Nyerere stated: &quot;we cannot remain an island. We must manage our own change – don&#x27;t wait to be pushed&quot;. Mwinyi then established the Nyalali Commission to examine the question of a transition to a multi-party system. It concluded that although most Tanzanians wanted to retain the one-party system, Tanzania would benefit from competing parties. Rival parties like Chadema, the Civic United Front, and NCCR–Mageuzi appeared, although CCM remained dominant. Freedom of speech was also expanded with a range of new newspapers appearing.

The Nyalali Commission had also recommended a transition to a &quot;three-government&quot; federation, with independent state governments for both Zanzibar and the mainland in addition to the unified federal government. This was designed to placate calls for Zanzibari autonomy, although Nyerere opposed it. He argued that there was no evidence it would improve government and that it would waste tax-payer&#x27;s money. In 1992, the Zanzibari government joined the Organisation of the Islamic Conference, something Nyerere criticised, arguing that foreign affairs was a federal issue and should not be delegated to the Zanzibari state. In 1993, 55 mainland parliamentarians called for the establishment of a mainland regional government, which Nyerere attacked in a pamphlet the following year. In 1995, he gave the &quot;nyufa&quot; speech in which he warned of &quot;cracks&quot; in the Tanzanian state caused by corruption, separatism, and tribalism. He expressed concerns about growing mainland chauvinism as a response to Zanzibari separatism and argued that it would develop into tribal resentments and rivalries. These concerns were influenced by the recent events of the Rwandan genocide, during which members of Rwanda&#x27;s Hutu majority had turned on its Tutsi minority.

Privately, he remained involved in CCM politics and lobbied to ensure that Benjamin Mkapa succeeded Mwinyi as its leader. He campaigned in support of the CCM candidates in Tanzania&#x27;s 1995 presidential election. Mkapa won the election, but there were charges of electoral fraud in coastal regions.In a speech at the CCM general assembly, Nyerere indicated that he intended to pull out from politics altogether.

===Final years: 1994–1999===
Nyerere remained active in international affairs, attending the 1994 Pan-African Congress, held in the Ugandan city of Kampala. In 1997, he gave a speech marking the fortieth anniversary of Ghanaian independence in which he expressed renewed support for Pan-African ideals and warning against a &quot;return to the tribe&quot; across the continent. He pointed to the example of growing European unity within the European Union as a model for African states to imitate. In the late 1990s he also reflected on his presidency, noting that although he made mistakes, particularly in prematurely pursuing nationalisation, he stood by the principles of the Arusha Declaration.

After the 1995 elections, the United Nations asked Nyerere to step in as a mediator to help end the Burundian Civil War. In 1996 the Mwalimu Nyerere Foundation was established though which the negotiations could take place; it was modelled on the U.S. Carter Center. That year, he oversaw two negotiation sessions between competing factions in Mwanza, with additional sessions in Arusha in 1998 and 1999. Nyerere was adamant that a resolution for peace should arise from a regional initiative rather than one brought forth by the Western powers. He insisted on a process of inclusivity, with even the smallest political groups being invited to take part in the negotiation process, and also emphasised the construction of civilian political institutions as key to a lasting peace in Burundi. The negotiations would continue until Nyerere&#x27;s death, at which his role was taken on by former President of South Africa Nelson Mandela. In 1997, he made his final visit to Edinburgh, delivering the Lothian European Lecture and teaching seminars at the university&#x27;s Centre of African Studies. The government and army contributed funds to build Nyerere a house in his home village; it was finished in 1999, although he only spent two weeks there prior to his death.

By 1998, Nyerere was aware that he had terminal leukaemia but kept this from the public. In September 1999 he travelled to England for medical care, being hospitalised in St Thomas&#x27; Hospital, London. There, in early October he had a major stroke and was placed in intensive care. He died on 14 October 1999, with his wife and six of his children at his bedside. Benjamin Mkapa, Tanzanian president at the time, announced Nyerere&#x27;s death on national television, and also proclaimed a 30-day mourning period. Nyerere was honoured by Tanzanian state radio playing funeral music while video footage of him were broadcast on television. A requiem mass was then held at Westminster Cathedral on 16 October. His body was then flown back to Tanzania, where it was carried past crowds in Dar es Salaam and taken to his coastal home. There, another requiem mass was held at St Joseph&#x27;s Cathedral. A funeral was then held at the National Stadium, in which hundreds passed by the body as it lay in state. Finally, the body was flown to Butiama and buried.

==Political ideology==

Nyerere&#x27;s ideology, a form of African socialism, is known as Ujamaa. Although attaining some of his early ideas from African Association contemporaries in Tanganyika, many of Nyerere&#x27;s political beliefs were developed while he was studying in Edinburgh; he noted that he &quot;evolved the whole of my political philosophy while I was there&quot;. In the city, he was influenced by texts produced within the traditions of classical liberalism and Fabian socialism, as well as by his reading of Adam Smith and John Stuart Mill, both of whom he had studied as a student.
For much of his life he was a prolific writer and speaker, leaving much material behind espousing his ideology. The political economist Issa G. Shivji noted that although Nyerere was &quot;a great man of principle&quot; but that when in power, &quot;at times pragmatism, even Machiavellism, overshadowed his avowed principles&quot;. As a result, Shivji argued, Nyerere exhibited &quot;a great ability and talent to rationalise his political actions with an astute exposition of principles&quot;.

===Anti-colonialism, non-racialism, and Pan-Africanism===

Nyerere was an African nationalist. He despised colonialism, and felt duty bound to oppose the colonial state in Tanganyika. In campaigning against colonialism, Nyerere acknowledged that he was inspired by the principles behind both the American Revolution and the French Revolution. He was also influenced by the Indian independence movement, which successfully resulted in the creation of an Indian republic in 1947, just before Nyerere studied in Britain. Nyerere insisted that the situation in Tanganyika was such that non-violent protest was possible and should be pursued, stating: &quot;I&#x27;m non-violent in the sense of Mohandas Gandhi... I feel violence is an evil with which one cannot become associated unless it is absolutely necessary&quot;. After becoming leader of his county, he became a prominent supporter of anti-colonial movements in southern Africa, providing said groups with material, diplomatic, and moral support.

Although opposing European colonialism, Nyerere was not antagonistic towards white Europeans; from his experiences he was aware that they were not all colonialists and racists. Prior to independence he insisted on a non-racialist front against colonialism, challenging those African nationalists who wanted to deny equal rights to East Africa&#x27;s European and Asian minorities. In a 1951 essay written in Edinburgh, he proposed that &quot;We must build up a society in which we shall belong to east Africa and not to our racial groups ... We appeal to all thinking Europeans and Indians to regard themselves as ordinary citizens of Tanganyika... We are all Tanganyikans and we are all east Africans.&quot; He argued that racial equality should be upheld on an individual basis, with individuals being legally protected against racial discrimination, rather than being enshrined in government with certain parliamentary seats reserved for different racial groups. This involvement in multi-racial politics differed from the approaches adopted by many other African nationalists in Tanganyika. When in power, Nyerere ensured that his government and close associates reflected a cross-section of East African society, including black Africans, Indians, Arabs, and Europeans, as well as practitioners of Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, and African traditional religion.

Nyerere was also a Pan-Africanist. He nevertheless saw a tension between his governance of a nation-state and his Pan-Africanist values, referring to this as &quot;dilemma of the pan-Africanist&quot; in a 1964 address.

===Democracy and the one-party state===
Nyerere emphasised the idea of democracy as a principle. He described democracy as &quot;government by the people... Ideally, it is a form of government whereby the people – all the people – settle their affairs through free discussion.&quot; This is a definition close to that generated by the clergyman Theodore Parker, whose influence he acknowledged. It was also influenced by forms of localised decision making found in various indigenous African societies, with Nyerere stating that discussing an issue till everyone agreed was &quot;the very essence of traditional African democracy&quot;. He absorbed the values of liberal democracy but focused attention on how to &quot;Africanize&quot; democracy. He emphasized that post-colonial African states were in a very different situation to Western countries and thus required a different governance structure; specifically, he favoured a representative democratic system within a one-party state. He opposed the formation of different parties and other political organisations with differing objectives in Tanzania, deeming them disruptive to his idea of the harmonious society and fearing their ability to further destabilise the fragile state.

He criticised the &quot;de facto&quot; two-party system he had observed in Britain, describing it as &quot;foot-ball politics&quot;. In his words, &quot;where there is &quot;one&quot; party, and that party is identified with the &quot;nation as a whole&quot;, the foundations of democracy are firmer than they can ever be when you have two or more parties, each representing only a section of the community!&quot; He repeatedly wrote arguments on these ideas, often aimed at Western liberals. Following the 1965 parliamentary election, in which different candidates from the same party competed for most seats, Nyerere noted: &quot;I don&#x27;t blame Westerners for being sceptical. The only democracies they have known have been multi-party systems, and the only one-party systems they have seen have been non-democratic. But: a multiplicity of parties does not guarantee democracy&quot;. For Nyerere, it was the preservation of political and civil liberties, rather than the presence of multiple parties, that ensured democracy; he believed that freedom of speech was possible in a one-party state. However, his opposition to the formation of competing political groups led critics to argue that there were anti-democratic implications to his thought.

Nyerere was keen to associate himself with the idea of freedom, titling his three major compilations of speeches and writings &quot;Freedom and Unity&quot;, &quot;Freedom and Socialism&quot;, and &quot;Freedom and Development&quot;. His conception of freedom was strongly influenced by the ideas of German philosopher Immanuel Kant. Like Kant, Nyerere believed that the purpose of the state was to promote liberty and the freedom of the individual.

He was one of the signatories of the agreement to convene a convention for drafting a world constitution. As a result, for the first time in human history, a World Constituent Assembly convened to draft and adopt the Constitution for the Federation of Earth.

===African socialism===

Nyerere was a socialist, with his views on socialism intertwined with his ideas on democracy. He promoted &quot;African socialism&quot; from at least July 1943, when he wrote an article referring to the concept in the &quot;Tanganyika Standard&quot; newspaper. Where he learned the term is not clear, for it would not become widely used until the 1960s. Nyerere saw socialism not as an alien idea to Africa but as something that reflected traditional African lifestyles. In his view, a &quot;socialist attitude of mind&quot; was already present in traditional African society. In his words from 1962, &quot;We, in Africa, have no more need of being &quot;converted&quot; to socialism than we have of being &quot;taught&quot; democracy. Both are rooted in our past – in the traditional society which produced us.&quot; He presented the traditional African village—as well as the ancient Greek city state—as the model for the idealised society. Molony described Nyerere as having produced &quot;romanticised accounts of idyllic village life in &#x27;traditional society&#x27;&quot;, describing his as &quot;a misty-eyed view&quot; of this African past.

Nyerere&#x27;s ideas about socialism owed little to either European social democracy or Marxism; he detested the Marxist idea of class struggle. Although he quoted from Karl Marx&#x27;s &quot;&quot; when speaking to certain audiences, he was critical of the idea of &quot;scientific socialism&quot; promoted by Marxists like Marx and Vladimir Lenin. He expressed the view that Marxist ideas about the construction of a socialist society from a capitalist one through the efforts of a revolutionary urban proletariat class were not applicable to post-colonial Africa, where there was little or no capitalism or proletariat and where—in Nyerere&#x27;s view—traditional society was not stratified into competing economic classes. In most of Africa, Nyerere said, &quot;we have to begin our socialism from tribal communalism and a colonial legacy which did not build much capitalism&quot;. He was also critical of the &quot;utopian socialism&quot; promoted by figures like Henri de Saint-Simon and Robert Owen, seeing their ideas as largely irrelevant to the Tanzanian situation. In his view, these European socialist writers had not produced ideas suited to the African context because they had not considered the history of &quot;colonial domination&quot; which Africa had experienced.

Nyerere firmly believed in egalitarianism and in creating a society of equals, referring to his desire for a &quot;classless society&quot;. In his view, the equality of &quot;ujamaa&quot; must come from the individual&#x27;s commitment to a just society in which all talents and abilities were used to the full. He desired a society in which the interests of the individual and society were identical and thought this could be achieved because individuals ultimately wanted to promote the common good. He believed it important to balance the rights of the individual with their duty to society, expressing the view that Western countries placed too much of an emphasis on individual rights; he regarded what he saw as the ensuing self-centred materialism as repulsive. To determine what balance to strike between the freedom of the individual and their responsibilities to society, he turned to the ideas of Genevan philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau. His ideas on societal collectivity may also have been influenced by the work of the social anthropologist Ralph Piddington, under whom Nyerere studied at Edinburgh. It was Nyerere&#x27;s belief that Africa would resolve the tension between the individual and society, a balance which other continents had failed to achieve.

Nyerere detested elitism and sought to reflect that attitude in the manner in which he conducted himself as president. He was cautious to prevent the replacement of the colonial elite with an indigenous elite, and to this end insisted that the most educated sectors of the Tanzanian population should remain fully integrated with society as a whole. He criticised the existence of aristocracy and the British monarchy. He endorsed the equality of the sexes, stating that &quot;it is essential that our women live on terms of full equality with their fellow citizens who are men&quot;.

He remained dedicated to a belief in the rule of law. He stressed the need for hard work. Nyerere appealed to the idea of tradition when trying to convince Tanzanians of his ideas. He stated that Tanzania could only be developed &quot;through the religion of socialism and self-reliance&quot;. He reiterated the ideas of freedom, equality, and unity as being central to his concept of African socialism.

====Socialism and Christianity====

Nyerere&#x27;s belief in socialism was retained after his socialist reforms failed to generate economic growth. He stated that &quot;They keep saying you&#x27;ve failed. But what is wrong with urging people to pull together? Did Christianity fail because the world is not all Christian?&quot;
Much of Nyerere&#x27;s political ideology was inspired by his Christian belief, although he stipulated the view that one did not have to be a Christian to be a socialist: There is not the slightest necessity for people to study metaphysics and decide whether there is one God, many Gods, or no God, before they can be socialist... What matters in socialism and to socialists is that you should care about a particular kind of social relationship on this earth. Why you care is your own affair. Elsewhere, he declared that &quot;socialism is secular&quot;.

Trevor Huddleston thought that Nyerere could be considered both a Christian humanist, and a Christian socialist. In his speeches and writings, Nyerere frequently quoted from the Bible, and in a 1970 address to the headquarters of the Maryknoll Mission, he argued that the Roman Catholic Church must involve itself in &quot;the rebellion against those social structures and economic organizations which condemn men to poverty, humiliation and degradation&quot;, warning that if it failed to do so then it would lose relevance and &quot;the Christian religion will degenerate into a series of superstitions accepted by the fearful&quot;. Despite his personal religious commitments, he espoused freedom of religion and the right for individuals to change their religious adherence.

==Personality and personal life==

Smith described Nyerere as &quot;a slight, wiry man with a high forehead and a toothbrush moustache&quot;. He was described as an eloquent speaker, and a skilled debater, with Bjerk describing him as having &quot;a scholar&#x27;s mind&quot;. According to Molony, &quot;articulated his sometimes complex ideas in a simple and logical style of speechwriting.&quot;
Nyerere was a modest man who was shy regarding the personality cult that followers established around him. In rejecting the personality cult, he for instance rejected ideas that statues be built to him. In a 1963 memorandum, he called on colleagues to help him in &quot;stamping out the disease of pomposity&quot; in Tanzanian society. As president, he for instance did not like to be referred to as either &quot;Your Excellency&quot; or &quot;Dr Nyerere&quot;. Most staff members referred to him as &quot;Mzee&quot;, a Swahili word meaning &quot;old man&quot;. Smith noted that Nyerere had a &quot;respect for spartan living&quot; and an &quot;abhorrence of luxury&quot;; in his later years he always travelled by economy class. Bjerk described to Nyerere as giving &quot;meandering speeches spiced with barbed humor.&quot;

Assessing his early life, Molony described Nyerere as &quot;down-to-earth, principled, and had a strong sense of fairness. He was modest and unpretentious. In contrast to a good number of his contemporaries at Tabora Boys, he was neither arrogant nor conceited.&quot; In focusing heavily on his studies, some regarded him as &quot;a touch precocious&quot;, or even as a or a bore; in addition, Molony noted, Nyerere could be &quot;manipulative at times, increasingly shrewd with experience, and always tenacious&quot;. Bjerk noted that Nyerere &quot;delighted in wry irony&quot;, and &quot;wore his emotions on his sleeve. His joy, anger, and sadness often poured out into public view&quot;.

Huddleston recalled conversations with Nyerere as being &quot;exciting and stimulating&quot;, with the Tanzanian leader focusing on world issues rather than talking about himself. In Huddleston&#x27;s view, Nyerere was &quot;a great human being who has always treasured his human-ness (his humanity if you like) more deeply than his office&quot;. For Huddleston, Nyerere displayed much humility, a trait that was &quot;rare indeed&quot; among politicians and statesmen. Molony noted that, in Edinburgh, Nyerere was &quot;quiet and fairly unremarkable, and therefore forgettable&quot;, &quot;an unobtrusive and quietly competitive young man who kept his ambitions to himself.&quot;

Nyerere&#x27;s secretary, Joseph Namata, said that the leader &quot;jokes about everything&quot; and &quot;can shout if he is angry&quot;.
When planners suggested infrastructure developments for his home area, Nyerere rejected the proposals, not wanting to present the appearance of giving favours to it.
Nyerere ensured that his parents&#x27; resting places were maintained. Smith referred to Nyerere as &quot;a scholar at heart&quot;.
In later life, Twining described Nyerere as &quot;a very shrewd politician, an emotionalist... he is not greedy, not corrupt; I think he is a good man.&quot;
Molony suggested that there was &quot;a very shrewd side to his character&quot;, in that he was capable of playing to his audience by portraying himself as &quot;the betrayed righteous figure, employing melodrama and even extortion to get what he wanted&quot;.

The style of suit that Nyerere wore was widely imitated in Tanzania, which led to it being known as a &quot;Tanzanian suit&quot;. Many European and American observers believed it similar to a Mao suit and interpreted it as evidence for Nyerere&#x27;s perceived desire for greater links with the Marxist–Leninist government in China. Nyerere objected to the tendency in Western countries to view Africa through the prism of Cold War politics.
After the formation of Tanzania, Nyerere took to wearing a style of Zanzibaran hat called a &quot;kofia&quot;. In later life, he carried a small ebony stick known as a &quot;fimbo&quot; which served as a symbol of his authority.

Nyerere published widely over the course of his life. He wrote poetry, and translated William Shakespeare&#x27;s plays &quot;Julius Caesar&quot; and &quot;The Merchant of Venice&quot; into Swahili, publishing these in 1961 and 1972 respectively. In later life, he—like many other Anglophone African statesmen—was known to be an avid listener of the BBC World Service broadcasts. According to Smith, Nyerere had &quot;a great fondness for British character and eccentricity&quot;.

Raised as a practitioner of Zanaki traditional religion, Nyerere converted to Catholicism at the age of 20 and remained a practitioner throughout his life. Christianity strongly influenced Nyerere&#x27;s life and his political beliefs. Nyerere described Christianity as &quot;a revolutionary creed&quot; but believed that its message had often been corrupted by churches. He liked to attend Mass in the early mornings, and while in Edinburgh enjoyed spending time sitting quietly in church. There is some evidence that while in Scotland, he considered ordination as a Catholic priest. He avoided Christian sectarianism and was friends with Christians of other denominations. Into his later life, he regularly attended Mass.

With his wife Maria Gabriel, Nyerere had seven children. When Nyerere was president, he insisted that his children go to state school and receive no special privileges. Two of his children suffered from mental illness. During the 1970s, Nyerere&#x27;s relationship with his wife became strained and she moved to live with her sister, near to the Kenyan border, for a while. He had 26 grandchildren.

==Cause for canonization==
In January 2005, the Diocese of Musoma opened the cause for the canonization of Nyerere, who was a devout Catholic and a man of recognized integrity. He is afforded the title Servant of God. The postulator for Nyerere is Dr. Waldery Hilgeman.

== Reception and legacy ==
Within Tanzania, Nyerere has been termed the &quot;Father of the Nation&quot;, and was also known as &quot;Mwalimu&quot; (teacher). He gained recognition for the successful merger between Tanganyika and Zanzibar, and for leaving Tanzania as a united and stable state. Molony noted that Nyrere was &quot;often depicted as Tanganyika&#x27;s &quot;wunderkind&quot;&quot;, and is &quot;remembered as one of Africa&#x27;s most respected statesmen&quot;. A Tanzanian African studies scholar named Godfrey Mwakikagile stated that it was Nyerere&#x27;s ideals of &quot;equality and social justice&quot; which &quot;sustained Tanzania and earned it a reputation as one of the most stable and peaceful countries in Africa, and one of the most united; a rare feat on this turbulent continent.&quot; For Mwakikagile, Nyerere was &quot;one of the world&#x27;s most influential leaders of the twentieth century&quot;.

Nyerere was remembered &quot;in African nationalist history as an uncompromising socialist&quot;; Molony stated that &quot;Nyerere&#x27;s contribution to socialism was to make it African; and, in his eyes at least, to bring &#x27;traditional&#x27; communal societies into the modern world.&quot; According to the historian W. O. Maloba, through his writing Nyerere became &quot;one of the most respected contributors to the expanding literature on African Socialism&quot;. Smith noted that through his regular tours of Tanzania, Nyerere &quot;has probably spoken directly to as large a percentage of his countrymen as any head of state on earth&quot;. In Pratt&#x27;s view, Nyerere had been &quot;a leader of unquestionable integrity who whatever his policy errors, was profoundly committed&quot; to the welfare of his people. Bjerk characterised him as being &quot;neither saint nor tyrant, Nyerere was a politician who kept his integrity and vision in a harsh and changing world.&quot; Bjerk added that Nyerere was &quot;a brilliant intellectual, but some of his policies seem disastrously misguided to us today [2017].&quot; Bjerk noted that &quot;Nyerere stabilized his government and kept the country at peace&quot;, something not achieved by most of Tanzania&#x27;s neighbours.

Richard Turnbull, the last British governor of Tanganyika, described Nyerere as having &quot;a tremendous adherence to principle&quot; and exhibiting &quot;rather a Gandhian streak&quot;. The scholar of education J. Roger Carter noted that Nyerere&#x27;s peaceful withdrawal from the leadership &quot;suggests a leader of unusual quality and a national spirit, largely of his own creation, of some maturity&quot;. The Russian historian Nikolai Kosukhin described Nyerere as a leader of a &quot;charismatic type, symbolizing the ideals and expectations of the people&quot;, in this manner comparing him to Gandhi, Nkrumah, Sun Yat Sen, and Senghor. For Kosukhin, Nyerere was &quot;a recognized standard bearer of the struggle for African liberation and a tireless champion of the idea of equitable economic relations between the rich North and the developing South&quot;. In this way, Kosukhin thought, Nyerere &quot;belongs not only to Tanzania and Africa, but also to all mankind&quot;. In Mwakikagile&#x27;s view, Nyerere &quot;epitomized the best&quot; among &quot;the founding fathers&quot; of independence African states, citing him alongside such &quot;Big Men&quot; as Kenyatta, Nkrumah, Sekou Toure, Patrice Lumumba, and Modibo Keita.


Bureaucrats from TANU subsequently established a cult of personality around Nyerere. By the time he died, he was increasingly viewed as a symbol of the nation. A museum and mausoleum devoted to him were built in Butiama. Posthumously, the Catholic Church in Tanzania began the processing of beatifying Nyerere, hoping to have him recognised as a saint. A delegation from the Vatican arrived in Tanzania to investigate these calls in January 2005. Although his ujamaa ideals were largely abandoned by the governments that succeeded him, the historian Sidney J. Lemelle argued that these values could be identified in the later Tanzanian hip hop and rap scene.

At his death, Western commentators repeatedly claimed that Nyerere had served his people poorly as president. Many Western governments and economists used Nyerere&#x27;s Tanzania as an example of why, to ensure economic growth, post-colonial African states should embrace limited state regulation and a market economy linked in with the international capitalist economy. Bjerk noted that although Nyerere was &quot;an advocate for democracy&quot;, his pursuit of a democracy adapted to East African society led to him forming &quot;a one-party state that regularly violated democratic values&quot;. He thought that &quot;few would deny&quot; that Nyerere &quot;became a dictator&quot;, although noted that &quot;he maintained his authority without mass violence&quot;, unlike many other dictatorial leaders in Africa. In 2007, the politician Ismail Jussa said of Nyerere: &quot;He wanted to preserve power. Maybe he did not kill people as other dictators, but by suppressing dissent he was not different to any other dictator.&quot; Shivji disagreed, stating that &quot;to be sure, Nyerere was not a dictator&quot;, although described the policies which Nyerere enacted as being authoritarian.

It is said that Nyerere was great master of a Masonic lodge. Besides, his support to Frelimo when the latter processed and imprisoned Mozambican politicians who were in opposition to it (and who were later killed), arises criticism in Mozambique today.

After his death, Nyerere received far less attention than other, contemporary African leaders like Kenyatta, Nkrumah, and Mandela. Much of the literature published about him has been un-critical and hagiographic, ignoring elements of his life that might not be considered flattering. Also often omitted from accounts of his life are the more ruthless elements of his rule, especially the imprisonment of some political dissenters. In 2009, his life was portrayed in a South African production by Imruh Bakari for M-Net titled &quot;The Legacy of Julius Kambarage Nyerere&quot;. The University of Edinburgh, Nyerere&#x27;s &quot;alma mater&quot;, also honours him in various ways. Ten years after his death, it put up a plaque in his name on the external wall of its School of Social and Political Science, and provides three Julius Nyerere Masters Scholarships each year.

<text>The Westland Wessex is a British-built turbine-powered development of the Sikorsky H-34. It was developed and produced under licence by Westland Aircraft (later Westland Helicopters). One of the main changes from Sikorsky&#x27;s H-34 was the replacement of the piston-engine powerplant with a turboshaft engine. Early models were powered by a single Napier Gazelle engine, while later builds used a pair of de Havilland Gnome engines.

The Wessex was initially produced for the Royal Navy (RN) and later for the Royal Air Force (RAF); a limited number of civilian aircraft were also produced, as well as some export sales. The Wessex operated as an anti-submarine warfare and utility helicopter; it is perhaps best recognised for its use as a search and rescue (SAR) helicopter. The type entered operational service in 1961, and had a service life in excess of 40 years before being retired in the UK in 2003. 

==Design and development==
===Background===
In the early 1950s Sikorsky developed the S-58, an improved version of the S-55, which had entered service as the H-19 with the United States. The United States Navy issued a contract in 1952 for the S-58, entering service as the HUS-1, the Army placing a contract in 1955 as the H-34, and the Marine Corp in 1957 (as the HUS-1). In 1962 these names were standardized to using the H-34, with additional prefixes and letters according to that U.S. designation system. Westland had already made a version of the predecessor of the S-56, the S-55 as the Westland Whirlwind. 

In 1956, an American-built S-58 was shipped to Britain for Westland to use as a pattern aircraft. Initially assembled with its Wright Cyclone, it was demonstrated to the British armed services leading to a preliminary order for the Royal Navy. For British production, it was re-engined with a single Napier Gazelle turboshaft engine, first flying in that configuration on 17 May 1957. The lighter (by ) Gazelle engine required some redistribution of weight. The first Westland-built Wessex serial &quot;XL727&quot;, designated a &quot;Wessex HAS.1&quot;, first flew on 20 June 1958. The first production Wessex HAS1 were delivered to Royal Navy&#x27;s Fleet Air Arm (FAA) in early 1960; the Wessex was the first helicopter operated by the FAA to be purpose-designed from scratch as an anti-submarine platform.

In service, the Wessex was found to be a major improvement over the older Westland Whirlwind. The decision made by Westland to install a modern gas-turbine powerplant gave the Wessex a greater load capacity, was quieter and generated less vibration, the latter quality being highly beneficial when treating casualties during flight. The Gazelle engine allowed for rapid starting and thus faster response times. The Wessex could also operate in a wide range of weather conditions as well as at night, partly due to its use of an automatic pilot. These same qualities that made the Wessex well-suited to the anti-submarine role also lent themselves to the search and rescue (SAR) mission, which the type would become heavily used for.

===Further development===
An improved variant, the Wessex HAS.3, succeeded the HAS.1 in the anti-submarine role; it had a more capable radar and better avionics, greater engine power, improved navigational features and a more advanced weapon system; the original HAS.1 were re-tasked for SAR duties. A commando assault variant, the Wessex HU.5, was also developed as a battlefield transportation helicopter; it was deployed on the navy&#x27;s amphibious assault ships, such as the commando carrier , and used to transport Royal Marines. The Wessex HU.5 was powered by coupled de Havilland Gnome engines, which provided nearly double the power of the original HAS.1 model and significantly extended its range. This enabled it to operate in a wider range of conditions; during the 1970s, the HU.5 also started to be used for the SAR mission.

As an anti-submarine helicopter, the Wessex could be either equipped with a dipping sonar to detect and track submarines or be armed with either depth charges or torpedoes; a single Wessex could not search for and attack submarines as this was beyond its carrying capability. It was this limitation that soon led the Royal Navy to search for a more capable helicopter that could provide this capability. This ultimately resulted in Westland proceeding with the adaptation and production of another Sikorsky-designed helicopter in the form of the Westland Sea King.

The Wessex was also used as a general-purpose helicopter for the RAF, for troop-carrying, air ambulance and ground support roles. The Wessex was the first of the RAF&#x27;s helicopters in which instrument flying, and thus night operations, were possible. Unlike the Navy&#x27;s Wessex fleet, which was largely composed of early single-engine models, the RAF mandated that its Wessex helicopters should be all twin-engined; this was a major factor in the RAF&#x27;s decision to reject the adoption of ex-FAA Wessex helicopters as the Navy migrated to the newer Sea King.

==Operational history==
===United Kingdom===

====Overview====

The Wessex was first used by the Royal Navy, which introduced the Wessex &quot;HAS.1&quot; to operational service in 1961. Having been satisfied by the favourable initial performance of the Wessex but seeking to improve its avionics and equipment, the Navy soon pressed for the development of the improved &quot;HAS.3&quot;, which came into service in 1967. Operationally, younger models would be assigned to perform the key anti-submarine warfare and commando transport missions, while older and less capable models would be typically be assigned to land bases for search and rescue (SAR).

The RAF became an operator of the Wessex in 1962; those helicopters used for air-sea or mountain rescue duties helped make the Wessex a particularly well known aircraft of the service and contributed to the saving of many lives during its time in service. As one of the RAF&#x27;s standing duties, multiple Wessex helicopters were permanently kept on standby to respond to an emergency located anywhere within 40 miles of the British coastline within 15 minutes during daytime. At night, this response time was increased to 60 minutes. SAR-tasked Wessex helicopters were also stationed abroad, such as at Cyprus. The qualities of the Wessex were described as being &quot;ideal for mountain flying&quot;.

The Wessex often found itself being used on the battlefield as a utility transport; as well as delivering supplies and equipment, the Wessex could also transport small groups of troops. Operationally, the Wessex could lift less than the RAF&#x27;s Bristol Belvedere helicopters, but was more robust and required less maintenance; thus, when the Belvedere was retired at the end of the 1960s, Wessex squadrons were often tasked with their former duties in support of the British Army on an ad-hoc basis. In large-scale helicopter assault operations, the type could be escorted by the RAF&#x27;s Hawker Siddeley Harriers. The HC.4 variant of the Westland Sea King began to replace the Wessex in this capacity from the late 1970s onwards, although troop-carrying missions would continue into the late 1990s.

The Wessex&#x27;s service career featured long-term deployments to both Hong Kong and Northern Ireland to support internal security operations, performing transport and surveillance missions. In Northern Ireland, the use of helicopters for supply missions proved a viable alternative to vulnerable road convoys; operations in this theatre led to the employment of various defensive equipment and countermeasures against the threat posed by small arms and shoulder-launched anti-air missiles.

===Queen&#x27;s Flight===

Wessex helicopters were also used by the Queen&#x27;s Flight of the RAF to transport VIPs including members of the British Royal Family; in this role, the helicopters were designated &quot;HCC.4&quot; and were essentially similar to the &quot;HC.2&quot;, differences included an upgraded interior, additional navigation equipment and enhanced maintenance programmes. Both Prince Philip and Prince Charles were trained Wessex pilots; occasionally they would perform as flying crew members in addition to being passengers on board the VIP services. The Wessex was replaced in this role by a privately leased Sikorsky S-76 in 1998.

====Wartime operations====

In 1962, an international crisis arose as Indonesia threatened confrontation over the issue of Brunei, which was not in the newly formed Federation of Malaya. By February 1964, a large number of RAF and RN helicopters, including Westland Wessex, were operating from bases in Sarawak and Sabah to assist Army and Marine detachments fighting guerilla forces infiltrated by Indonesia over its one thousand mile frontier with Malaysia. Having removed much of the anti-submarine equipment to lighten the aircraft, during the campaign in Borneo the Wessex was typically operated as a transport helicopter, capable of ferrying up to 16 troops or a 4,000-pound payload of supplies directly to the front lines. Alongside the Westland Scout, the Wessex emerged as one of the main workhorses of the campaign, roughly half were operated directly from land bases and would regularly rotate with those stationed on RN vessels stationed off shore. From these operations the Commando Helicopter Force gets its nickname of the &quot;Junglies&quot;.

Around 55 Westland Wessex HU.5s participated in the Falklands War, fighting in the South Atlantic in 1982. On 21 May 1982, 845 Squadron&#x27;s Wessex HU.5s supported British landings on East Falkland. The type was heavily used throughout the conflict for the transportation and insertion of British special forces, including members of the Special Air Service (SAS) and the Special Boat Service (SBS). A total of nine Wessex (eight HU.5s and one HAS.3) were lost during the Falklands campaign. Two HU.5s of 845 Squadron crashed on the Fortuna Glacier in South Georgia during an attempt to extract members of the SAS during a snow storm, six of 848 Squadron&#x27;s Wessex HU.5s were lost when the container ship &quot;Atlantic Conveyor&quot; was sunk and the HAS.3 aboard HMS &quot;Glamorgan&quot; was destroyed when the ship was struck by an Exocet missile.

=== Retirement ===
The last in UK service were retired in 2003, these were HC2 models used by the RAF.

====Civilian operations====
A civilian version of the helicopter, the Wessex 60, was also manufactured and supplied to a number of civilian operators, including Bristow Helicopters, one of the biggest rotary-wing operators in the world. Bristow flew them from various UK airfields and helicopter pads to support the growing North Sea Oil industry until they were withdrawn in 1982.

===Australia===
In April 1961, the Royal Australian Navy (RAN) announced that they had selected the Westland Wessex to become the standard service helicopter from their ships and its intention to purchase roughly 30 for anti-submarine patrols, casualty evacuations, and fleet communications duties. The RAN formally accepted the first two of 27 Wessex helicopters in September 1963; 817 Squadron was the first to operate the type; the Wessex and its dunking sonar array quickly proved to be the most effective anti-submarine platform as yet seen in the RAN.

The Wessex was a major operational shift for the Fleet Air Arm, enabling the RAN to proceed with the conversion of the aircraft carrier HMAS &quot;Melbourne&quot; as an anti-submarine platform. In typical carrier operations, a Wessex would be deployed during the launch and recovery of fixed-wing aircraft as a guard helicopter; during anti-submarine patrols, routine procedure was to have one Wessex airborne to actively screen the ship while a second would be fully armed and prepared for operations, such an arrangement was used during troop transport deployments by HMAS &quot;Sydney&quot; to Vietnam during the 1960s. Performing search and rescue sorties became another valued role of the type; in 1974, multiple Wessex helicopters participated in the relief effort in Darwin in the aftermath of Cyclone Tracy.

While the Wessex proved to be too large to reasonably operate from most of the RAN&#x27;s destroyers, it was found to be well suited as a troop-transport helicopter from heavy landing ships and larger vessels. By 1980, the Wessex was no longer being used for anti-submarine operations, having been replaced by the more advanced and capable Westland Sea King in this capacity. Instead, remaining Wessex helicopters were retained to perform its secondary roles as a plane guard, search and rescue platform, and as a utility transport helicopter.

==Specifications (Wessex HC.2)==
== Notable appearances in film ==
Wessexes portrayed the visually similar CH-34 Choctaws in Stanley Kubrick&#x27;s 1987 film &quot;Full Metal Jacket&quot;. The helicopters used were Wessex 60s, a civilian version of the Wessex HC.2. These are powered by the coupled-twin de Havilland Gnome with a distinctive long nose and single large turbine exhaust on each side, distinguishing them from the CH-34. XT761 was featured in season 4 of &quot;The Crown&quot; depicting Tom Byrne as Prince Andrew visiting the Queen.

<doc id="358659" wikidata="Q287262" url="?curid=358659" title="De-Loused in the Comatorium">
<text>De-Loused in the Comatorium is the debut studio album by American progressive rock band The Mars Volta, released on June 24, 2003, on Gold Standard Laboratories and Universal Records. Based on a short story written by lead singer Cedric Bixler-Zavala and sound manipulation artist Jeremy Ward, the concept album is an hour-long tale of Cerpin Taxt, a man who enters a week-long coma after overdosing on a mixture of morphine and rat poison. The story of Cerpin Taxt alludes to the death of El Paso, Texas artist—and Bixler-Zavala&#x27;s friend—Julio Venegas (1972–1996).

Co-produced by Rick Rubin and guitarist Omar Rodríguez-López, it is the only studio album to feature founding member Jeremy Ward, who was found dead in an apparent heroin overdose one month before the album was released. Following the departure of Eva Gardner who had appeared on the band&#x27;s early demos and EP, Red Hot Chili Peppers bassist Flea performed on &quot;De-Loused&quot;.

The music contained in &quot;De-Loused&quot; is distinguished by its enigmatic lyrics, Latin and jazz rhythms, and Rodríguez-López&#x27;s frenetic guitar riffs, which are often strongly dissonant. The title of the album is taken from the lyrics of the song &quot;Eunuch Provocateur&quot; on the band&#x27;s previous release, &quot;Tremulant&quot; (meanwhile, &quot;Take the Veil Cerpin Taxt&quot; contains the title of &quot;Tremulant&quot;). The cover artwork is by Storm Thorgerson.

==Background and recording==
Two songs from the album, &quot;Roulette Dares (The Haunt Of)&quot; and &quot;Cicatriz ESP&quot;, first appeared in 2001 as the band&#x27;s very first demo recordings with bassist Eva Gardner and drummer Blake Fleming; notably, the early version of &quot;Cicatriz ESP&quot; (then known as &quot;Cicatrix&quot;) was slower and much shorter (4 minutes) than the album one (at 12 minutes being the longest track on the album).

The album is a progressive rock and art rock album that also incorporates influences from psychedelia, Latin jazz, heavy metal, punk rock and blues rock.

== Reception ==

&quot;De-Loused&quot; became, both critically and commercially, the band&#x27;s biggest hit, eventually selling in excess of 500,000 copies despite limited promotion, and was featured on several critics&#x27; &quot;Best of the Year&quot; lists. The album was ranked number 55 on the October 2006 issue of &quot;Guitar World&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of the 100 greatest guitar albums of all time. &quot;Drunkship of Lanterns&quot; was named the 91st best guitar song of all-time by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;.

As of February 2007 it had sold 434,000 copies in the United States.

As of June 2016, the album had a score of 82 out of 100 from Metacritic based on &quot;universal acclaim&quot;. &quot;Alternative Press&quot; gave the album a perfect score of all five stars and said it &quot;takes multiple listens to absorb, and, even then, you&#x27;re probably not going to have a clue to what Bixler&#x27;s raving about.&quot; Yahoo! Music UK gave it a score of eight stars out of ten and said it was &quot;not an album to listen to casually. It insists on taking over your life for an hour, demands a level of concentration rare in rock, amply repays multiple plays.&quot; &quot;Under the Radar&quot; gave the album eight stars out of ten and said that the band &quot;has created the antithesis of ATDI, leaving behind any formula or typicality. What they kept was the fire, the fury, and the passion.&quot; &quot;Drowned in Sound&quot; gave it a score of eight out of ten and called it &quot;truly exquisite and well worth the wait.&quot; Playlouder gave it a score of four stars out of five and said, &quot;There are moments of prog rock, jazz fusion and freakydelia in this rush of ideas and if that sounds awful then don&#x27;t be put off. Instead of the shambolic mess that this kinda influence normally entails Mars Volta have come strictly disciplined.&quot; &quot;Uncut&quot; gave it four stars out of five and said: &quot;Imagine a jam session between King Crimson, Fugazi and &#x27;70s Miles. Now imagine it working. That&#x27;s the Mars Volta.&quot; &quot;Blender&quot; also gave it four stars and said it &quot;Roars like Led Zeppelin, churns like King Crimson and throbs like early Santana.&quot; &quot;Tiny Mix Tapes&quot; likewise gave it a score of four out of five and called it &quot;a very strong debut album for the Mars Volta.&quot; &quot;Ink 19&quot; Magazine also gave it a favorable review and said it was &quot;definitely worth checking out, but make sure to keep an open mind and check any preconceived notions at the door.&quot;

In 2014, readers of &quot;Rhythm&quot; voted it the ninth-greatest drumming album in the history of progressive rock. The album was also included in the book &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;. The album was included as number 25 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s list of &quot;50 Greatest Prog Rock Albums of All Time&quot;.

<text>Joseph Kabila Kabange ( , ; born 4 June 1971) is a Congolese politician and military officer who was the fourth President of the Democratic Republic of the Congo from 2001 to 2019. He took office ten days after the assassination of his father, President Laurent-Désiré Kabila in the context of the Second Congo War. He was allowed to remain in power after the 2003 Pretoria Accord ended the war as the president of the country&#x27;s new transitional government. He was elected as president in 2006 and re-elected in 2011 for a second term. Since stepping down after the 2018 election, Kabila, as a former president, serves as a senator for life. Kabila was the country&#x27;s second-longest serving president.

Kabila is credited with ending the Second Congo War and restoring relative stability to most of the country, though conflict continued in eastern DR Congo against rebel forces supported by neighboring Rwanda and Uganda. He encouraged foreign investment in the mining industry and improved the infrastructure. The size of the country&#x27;s economy increased by five times during his presidency. But economic growth slowed down in the later years, and it had been very unequal. The majority of DR Congo&#x27;s population still lived below the international poverty line by the time he left office. He helped organize electoral institutions and in 2006 presided over the DRC&#x27;s first multi-party election in decades, though both that and his victory in 2011 faced accusations of electoral fraud and saw protests. He led an authoritarian government that was known for embezzlement, corruption, and human rights violations, including security forces killing protestors. The United States has sanctioned associates of Kabila for corruption and undermining democracy.

Kabila&#x27;s term was due to expire on 20 December 2016, according to the terms of the constitution adopted in 2006. Officials suggested that elections would be held in November 2016, but on 29 September 2016, the nation&#x27;s electoral authority announced that the election would not be held until early 2018. Talk focused on the need for a census before holding elections. Kabila&#x27;s popularity declined and he also faced growing pressure from the international community to give up power. An agreement was reached with the influential Catholic Church hierarchy to appoint a new government and prepare to hold elections. In August 2018, Kabila announced that he would step down and not seek a third term in the December 2018 general election. Kabila was succeeded by Félix Tshisekedi in the country&#x27;s first peaceful transition of power since independence. Independent observers concluded that Tshisikedi lost heavily to another candidate, Martin Fayulu, and that Kabila had fixed the official result for the candidate most likely to be most helpful to him in the latter&#x27;s post-presidency period.

==Early life and education (1971–1996)==
Joseph Kabila Kabange and his twin sister Jaynet Kabila were born on 4 June 1971. According to official accounts, the twins were born at Hewabora, a small village in the Fizi Territory of the South Kivu Province, in eastern DRC. Rumors have abounded that Kabila was actually born in Tanzania, which would make him a citizen of that country. He is the son of long time rebel, former AFDL leader and president of the DRC Laurent-Désiré Kabila and Sifa Mahanya.

Kabila&#x27;s childhood coincided with the low point of his father&#x27;s political and military career. He was raised in relative remoteness, with few records of his early days. Kabila attended a primary school organized by his father&#x27;s rebel forces, before moving to Tanzania where he completed primary and secondary school. Due to his father&#x27;s status as an enemy of Zairean strongman Mobutu Sese Seko, Kabila posed as a Tanzanian in his school years to avoid detection by Zairean intelligence agents.

==Guerrilla and army years (1996–2001)==
Following high school, Kabila followed a military curriculum in Tanzania, then at Makerere University in Uganda. In October 1996, Laurent-Désiré Kabila launched the campaign in Zaire to oust the Mobutu regime with his newly formed army, the Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo-Zaire (AFDL). Joseph Kabila became the commander of an AFDL unit that included &quot;kadogos&quot; (child soldiers) and likely played a key role in major battles on the road to Kinshasa, but his exact whereabouts during the war have been difficult to establish. Joseph Kabila appears to have been present at the liberation of Kisangani where media reports identified him as commander of the rebel force that took the city after four days of intense fighting.

Following the AFDL&#x27;s victory, and Laurent-Désiré Kabila&#x27;s rise to the presidency, Joseph Kabila went on to get further training at the PLA National Defense University, in Beijing, China.

When he returned from China, Kabila was awarded the rank of major-general, and appointed Deputy Chief of Staff of the Congolese Armed Forces (FAC), in 1998. He was later, in 2000, appointed Chief of Staff of the Land Forces, a position he held until the elder President Kabila&#x27;s assassination in January 2001. As chief of staff, he was one of the main military leaders in charge of government troops during the time of the Second Congo War (1998–2003).

==Peace talks and transitional government (2001–2006)==

Joseph Kabila rose to the presidency on 26 January 2001 after the assassination of Laurent-Désiré Kabila, becoming the world&#x27;s first head of government born in the 1970s. Aged 29, he was considered young and inexperienced, and reportedly did not want to become the president, but was the only candidate that his father&#x27;s advisers could agree on. In his inauguration speech, Joseph Kabila spoke about the need to &quot;restore peace and national communion,&quot; restart the negotiations that stalled under his predecessor, return to democracy, and to liberalize the economy.

He subsequently attempted to end the ongoing civil war by negotiating peace agreements with rebel groups backed by Rwanda and Uganda, the same regional armies who had brought Laurent-Désiré Kabila&#x27;s rebel group to power three years before. The process began in 2001 and continued despite difficulties during the talks, including the resumption of fighting. Under international pressure from South African president Thabo Mbeki and UN special envoy Moustapha Niasse, the final peace settlement was based on the 2002 agreement signed at the Inter-Congolese Dialogue in Sun City, South Africa, which nominally ended the Second Congo War. It maintained Joseph Kabila as the president and head of state of the DRC. A transitional government was set up under him, including the leaders of the country&#x27;s two main rebel groups, the MLC and RCD–Goma, as vice-presidents. The two other vice-presidents were representatives of the civilian opposition and the government respectively. It also set up the basis for the legislature and the armed forces, and elections were to be held within two years, which could be extended by six months.

The implementation of the peace agreement took place with international monitoring, including with the presence of the largest United Nations peacekeeping mission in its history. The first cabinet was set up in June 2003, followed by the National Assembly and the Senate in the next month. The Independent Electoral Commission (CEI) was created in 2004, and also that year the Nationality Act was passed to address previous disputes regarding the issue. The parliament began working on the constitution in February 2005, and passed a draft in May 2005, in the presence of both Kabila and Thabo Mbeki. It created an independent judiciary and a semi-presidential system where a prime minister is appointed by the president but must have the support of the parliamentary majority.

When the slow process of passing an electoral law led to talks of elections being postponed by six months in early 2005, there was a brief split within the government with the MLC, which also involved delays in appointments to government offices, though it was remedied after Kabila spoke to Vice President Jean-Pierre Bemba. Meanwhile, the historic opposition party UPDS called for protests, and some newspapers in Kinshasa spoke of a &quot;Ukrainian scenario,&quot; but planned demonstrations by UPDS were blocked by police. Between June and December 2005, the electoral commission was able to register 25 million voters across the DRC despite the poor state of the infrastructure. This was in preparation for the country&#x27;s first free electoral expression since 1965, the constitutional referendum, held at the end of the year. The constitution was approved with 84 percent of the vote, and 62 percent voter turnout, with the highest support being in the eastern DRC. This was despite a boycott by over 40 political parties. Kabila promulgated the constitution in February 2006.

The creation of the Armed Forces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (FARDC) by integrating government troops and rebel groups proceeded more slowly. Kabila established a separate &quot;military household&quot; outside of the FARDC general staff, which had been founded in 2003, and his own presidential guard that received better pay and equipment than the regular army. The former rebel leaders likewise continued to command their own forces outside of the FARDC chain of command and in practice controlled their original territory. In May 2005 a plan was adopted to disarm, retrain, and reorganize former rebel groups into a number of integrated brigades, but its implementation was not completed before 2006 and the army remained in a state of disorder. 

On 28 March 2004, an apparent coup attempt or mutiny around the capital Kinshasa, allegedly by members of the former guard of former president Mobutu Sese Seko (who had been ousted by Kabila&#x27;s father in 1997 and died in the same year), failed. On 11 June 2004, coup plotters led by Major Eric Lenge allegedly attempted to take power and announced on state radio that the transitional government was suspended, but were defeated by loyalist troops.

In October 2004 Kabila visited the eastern part of the DRC for the first time since the end of the war. The president&#x27;s visit to Kisangani, which had been occupied by rebel and foreign troops, was portrayed as a demonstration of the restoration of stability and unity to the country. However, the presidential guard disarmed the former rebels there, who were awaiting integration into the FARDC, and moved them into camps outside of the city. Western observers also saw this trip as signalling the start of his election campaign. Kabila&#x27;s campaign platform included a reconstruction plan known as &quot;Cinq Chantiers&quot; (Five Construction Sites), consisting of infrastructure, job creation, education, water and electricity, and health.

==First presidential term (2006–2011)==
Kabila ran for the presidency as an independent, though the Alliance of the Presidential Majority was formed to support his campaign, which included his People&#x27;s Party for Reconstruction and Democracy (PPRD) and about 30 other parties. During the election campaign Kabila was attacked by his opposition with the claim of him being Rwandan instead of Congolese, in a country where many had a negative view of Rwanda, and being described as the candidate that represented foreign powers. Kabila was still seen as the frontrunner in the election by Western observers, due to the political opposition being divided and lacking resources, while the former rebel leaders were widely hated.

A presidential election was held on 30 July 2006, having been delayed from an earlier date in June. The new constitution lowered the minimum age of presidential candidates from 35 to 30; Kabila turned 35 shortly before the election. In March 2006, he registered as a candidate. Although the new constitution stipulates that a debate be held between the two remaining candidates for the presidency, no debates took place and many declared this unconstitutional.

According to widely disputed provisional results announced on 20 August, Kabila won 45% of the vote; his main opponent, vice-president and former rebel leader Jean-Pierre Bemba, won 20%. The irregularities surrounding the elections results prompted a run-off vote between Kabila and Bemba which was held on 29 October. On 15 November, the electoral commission announced the official results and Kabila was declared the winner, with 58.05% of the vote. These results were confirmed by the Supreme Court on 27 November 2006, and Kabila was inaugurated on 6 December 2006 as the country&#x27;s newly elected president. Both international and national observers stated that the election had been generally free and fair, while noting some irregularities. He named Antoine Gizenga, who placed third in the first round of the presidential election (and then backed Kabila in the second round) as prime minister on 30 December. 

In 2006, Kabila responded to evidence of widespread sex crimes committed by the Congolese military by describing the acts as &quot;simply unforgivable&quot;. He pointed out that 300 soldiers had been convicted of sex crimes, although he added that this was not enough.

One of the major economic projects of his first presidency, continuing into the second, was the Sicomines (&quot;Sino-Congolais des Mines&quot;) &quot;resources-for-infrastructure&quot; agreement with China. The deal was reportedly negotiated after Kabila&#x27;s government was unable to secure funding for his &quot;Cinq Chantiers&quot; program from Western countries. The DRC signed a memorandum of understanding in September 2007 that granted a consortium owned by the China Railway Engineering Corporation the majority of shares in a joint venture called Sicomines, while the DRC&#x27;s Gécamines owned the rest. Sicomines would be given mining licenses in the Katanga Province, with CREC agreeing to build of infrastructure in exchange, and to secure US$6.5 billion from Chinese banks to finance it. The agreement marked the first time that China became a major partner of the DRC and was the largest deal of its kind in the Congo&#x27;s history.

It was considered controversial because the DRC government guaranteed the loans, assuming the risk instead of the Chinese signatories. After the IMF and civil society groups became concerned about the DRC&#x27;s ability to repay the loans, negotiations continued and the final deal was signed in 2009. They removed the DRC&#x27;s garauntee for the mining investment but kept it for the infrastructure investment, which was reduced to US$3 billion. Sicomines was exempt from paying taxes in the DRC until the loans had been repaid. Kabila was criticized by the Congolese opposition and civil society groups for the deal, including for the lack of transparency during negotiations, which were done mostly by one of Kabila&#x27;s advisors, and for the terms disproportionately favoring China. His cabinet members argued that the DRC, while being in a weaker position, still benefited from the investments, and said that the government was pressured to bring about quick results for its infrastructure development promises. Supporters of the Sicomines agreement described it as a &quot;win-win&quot; deal for China and the DRC.

==Second presidential term (2011–2016)==

In December 2011, Kabila was re-elected for a second term as president. After the results were announced on 9 December, there was violent unrest in Kinshasa and Mbuji-Mayi, where official tallies showed that a strong majority had voted for the opposition candidate Étienne Tshisekedi. Official observers from the Carter Center reported that returns from almost 2,000 polling stations in areas where support for Tshisekedi was strong had been lost and not included in the official results. They described the election as lacking credibility. On 20 December, Kabila was sworn in for a second term, promising to invest in infrastructure and public services. However, Tshisekedi maintained that the result of the election was illegitimate and said that he intended also to &quot;swear himself in&quot; as president.

In January 2012, Catholic bishops in DR Congo also condemned the elections, complaining of &quot;treachery, lies and terror&quot;, and calling on the election commission to correct &quot;serious errors&quot;.

On 17 January 2015, Congo&#x27;s parliament passed an electoral law requiring a census before the next elections. On 19 January protests led by students at the University of Kinshasa broke out. The protests began following the announcement of a proposed law that would allow Kabila to remain in power until a national census could be conducted (elections had been planned for 2016). By Wednesday 21 January clashes between police and protesters had claimed at least 42 lives, although the government claimed only 15 people had been killed.

The Senate responded to protests by striking the census requirement from its law. Moïse Katumbi announced in October 2015 that he would leave the ruling party due to disagreements over the scheduled election.
Jaynet Kabila, the sister of Kabila, was named in the Panama Papers. Document leaks in 2016 revealed that she is a part-owner of a major Congolese television company, , through offshore subsidiaries.

Kabila is vastly unpopular, partly because of the conflicts in the Congo, but also because of the widespread belief that he has enriched himself and his family while ignoring millions of poor Congolese. There have been protests against his attempts to change term limits and extend his rule. Harsh demonstrations erupted on 20 April 2016 in Lubumbashi, one of Congo&#x27;s biggest cities.

When Moise Katumbi, the former governor of Katanga Province in the Democratic Republic of Congo and now an opposition figure, announced that he was running for president in an election that was supposed to be held by the end of 2016, his house was surrounded by security forces wanting to arrest him.

Although Kabila&#x27;s forces have scored an important victory against one large rebel group, the M23, in 2013, many other armed groups have splintered into dangerous movements. And by 2016 new ones had risen, like militias in the Nyunzu area that have killed hundreds of people.

==Delayed election and extended presidency (2016–2019)==

According to the Constitution of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, President Kabila should not be allowed to serve more than two terms. On 19 September 2016, massive protests rocked Kinshasa calling for him to step down as legally mandated. Seventeen people were killed. Elections to determine a successor to Kabila were originally scheduled to be held on 27 November 2016. On 29 September 2016, the nation&#x27;s electoral authority announced that the election would not be held until early 2018. According to the electoral commission&#x27;s vice president, the commission &quot;hasn&#x27;t called elections in 2016 because the number of voters isn&#x27;t known.&quot; However, the opposition alleges that Kabila had intentionally delayed the election to remain in power.

Partially in response to the delayed election, the United States issued sanctions against two members of Kabila&#x27;s inner circle, John Numbi and Gabriel Amisi Kumba, on 28 September. These actions were seen as a warning to President Kabila to respect his country&#x27;s constitution.

More demonstrations were planned to mark the passing of the end of the presidential mandate. Opposition groups claim that the outcome of late elections would be civil war.

Maman Sidikou, the Secretary-General&#x27;s Special Representative for DR Congo and head of MONUSCO, said that a tipping point into uncontrollable violence could come about very quickly if the political situation is not normalised.

Kabila&#x27;s second term as president of the Democratic Republic of Congo was due to end on 20 December 2016. A statement issued by his spokesperson on 19 December 2016, stated that Joseph Kabila would remain in post until a new president is in place following elections which will not be held until at least April 2018. Kabila subsequently installed a new cabinet led by prime minister Samy Badibanga, resulting in protests in which at least 40 people were killed. Under articles 75 and 76 of the Constitution of the Democratic Republic of Congo, should the office of the president become vacant, the Chairman of the Senate, presently Léon Kengo would assume the presidency in an acting capacity.
On 23 December, an agreement was proposed between the main opposition group and the Kabila government under which the latter agreed not to alter the constitution and to leave office before the end of 2017. Under the agreement opposition leader Étienne Tshisekedi will oversee that the deal is implemented and the country&#x27;s Prime Minister will be appointed by the opposition.

In late February 2018 the ministry of international affairs of Botswana told Kabila that it was time to go and said the &quot;worsening humanitarian situation&quot; in DRC is compounded by the fact that &quot;its leader has persistently delayed holding elections, and has lost control over the security of his country&quot;.

On December 30, 2018 the presidential election to determine the successor to Kabila was held. Kabila endorsed Emmanuel Ramazani Shadary, his former interior minister. On January 10, 2019, the electoral commission announced opposition candidate Félix Tshisekedi as the winner of the vote.

== Post-presidency (2019–present) ==

Since leaving the presidency, Kabila has made Kingakati farm his main residence. The estate, located 50 km east of Kinshasa, was his second home while he was still in power.

In April 2021, President Felix Tshisekedi succeeded in ousting the last remaining elements of his government who were loyal to former leader Kabila.

In May 2021, Tshisekedi called for a review of mining contracts signed with China by Kabila, especially the Sicomines multibillion &#x27;minerals-for-infrastructure&#x27; deal.

In November 2021, a judicial investigation targeting Kabila and his associates was opened in Kinshasa after revelations of alleged embezzlement of $138 million. A &quot;Bloomberg News&quot; investigation based on leaked bank records alleged that Kabila&#x27;s family members received tens of millions of dollars in bribes from Chinese companies involved in the Sicomines deal.

In February 2025, Kabila criticised President Tshisekedi for mishandling the M23 campaign (2022–present) through poor governance and accused him of seeking to become &quot;absolute ruler of the country&quot; by suppressing political opposition.

==Personal life==
Kabila married Olive Lembe di Sita, on 1 June 2006. The wedding ceremonies took place on 17 June 2006. Kabila and his wife have a daughter, born in 2001, named Sifa, after Kabila&#x27;s mother, and a son born in 2008 named Laurent-Désiré Jr. He owns property outside of Kinshasa, including 71,000 hectares of farmland, and his family fully or partially owns 80 companies across almost every industry in the DRC, including in mining. Kabila&#x27;s hobbies include watching the NBA, reading, playing PlayStation 4, and driving his motorcycles.

Kabila, having been raised outside the country, only spoke English and Swahili fluently when he became president, and was not fluent in either French, the DRC&#x27;s official language, or Lingala, a common language in the capital Kinshasa.

As Kabila is an Anglican Protestant and Lembe di Sita is Catholic, the wedding ceremonies were ecumenical; they were officiated by both the Catholic Archbishop of Kinshasa, Cardinal Frederic Etsou Bamungwabi, and Pierre Marini Bodho – presiding bishop of the Church of Christ in Congo, the umbrella church for most denominations in the Congo, known within the country simply as &quot;The Protestant Church&quot;.

In July 2021, Joseph Kabila finished his master&#x27;s degree, getting the certification from the University of Johannesburg in South Africa. He completed Master&#x27;s programme in Political Science and International Relations through distance learning.

<doc id="358669" wikidata="Q841812" url="?curid=358669" title="Marsupilami">
<text>Marsupilami is a comic book character and fictional animal species created by André Franquin. Its first appearance was in the 31 January 1952 issue of the Franco-Belgian comics magazine &quot;Spirou&quot;. Since then it appeared regularly in the popular Belgian comics series &quot;Spirou &amp; Fantasio&quot;, as a pet of the main characters, until Franquin stopped working on the series; the character&#x27;s final appearance in the series during Franquin&#x27;s lifetime was in 1970.

In the late 1980s, another character of the same species, distinct from the pet Marsupilami owned by Spirou and Fantasio, got its own successful spin-off series of comic albums entitled &quot;Marsupilami&quot;, written by Greg, Yann, and Dugomier, and drawn by Batem. The 1987 release of the first &quot;Marsupilami&quot; album marked the debut publication of the publishing house Marsu Productions, which was named after the character.

&quot;Marsupilami&quot; has since become a multimedia franchise, with multiple animated series, a feature film, a &quot;Marsupilami&quot; Sega Genesis video game and a variety of other merchandise. The asteroid 98494 Marsupilami is .

Marsupilami&#x27;s adventures had been translated to several languages, like Dutch, German, Greek, Catalan, Spanish, Portuguese, English, Italian and several Scandinavian languages. The most recent English translations are published by the British publishing house Cinebook. More than three million albums of the &quot;Marsupilami&quot; series are claimed to have been sold by Marsu Productions.

In 2013, Dupuis bought Marsu Productions and its characters, thereby allowing a new production of &quot;Spirou &amp; Fantasio&quot; adventures including the Marsupilami. The Marsupilami returned to the &quot;Spirou &amp; Fantasio&quot; series in the album &quot;La Colère du Marsupilami&quot;, released in 2016.

==Naming==
The name is a portmanteau of the words &quot;marsupial&quot;, &quot;Pilou-Pilou&quot; (the French name for Eugene the Jeep, a character Franquin loved as a child) and &quot;ami&quot; (French for friend).

The species&#x27; binomial name is given in Franquin&#x27;s &quot;Spirou et les héritiers&quot; as &quot;Marsupilamus fantasii&quot;. Its specific epithet refers to the character Fantasio, who was tasked with finding a specimen by his late uncle. He successfully found one on his expedition to South America with Spirou and subsequently brought it to Europe, where it later became the pair&#x27;s pet.

In &quot;Houba Banana&quot;, a 1997 album from the &quot;Marsupilami&quot; spin-off comic series written by Xavier Fauche and Eric Adam, its binomial name is given as &quot;Marsupilami franquini&quot;, referring to the real-life creator of the species, Franquin.

==Appearance and behavior==
The marsupilami is a black-spotted yellow leopard-like creature with dog-like ears. Male marsupilamis have an incredibly long, strong, flexible, prehensile tail, used for almost any task. Female marsupilamis have a much shorter tail, but still long compared to real animals. Both the male and female are able to use their tail as a weapon, by tightening the end into a fist and the remainder of the tail into a springlike spiral for maximal force. This attack was responsible for the Danish and Norwegian translators choosing words similar to &quot;spiral&quot; over &quot;marsupial&quot; as the creature&#x27;s name. Unlike the males, the females also walk on the tips of their toes. When the animal rebounds, he makes the noise: &quot;Boing&quot;. Males are also drawn with their eyes not completely separated, as if the sclerae of both eyes have merged, while females are often drawn with two completely separate eyes. Female marsupilamis also have a different voice compared to the males. Males say &quot;houba&quot; most of the time, while females say &quot;houbi&quot;. According to the &quot;L&#x27;Encyclopédie du Marsupilami&quot;, they are monotremes like the platypus and echidna, which explains why they lay eggs while having mammalian features. Like parrots and some corvid birds, the Marsupilami can also mimic human speech, and like an amphibian is able to breathe underwater as well as on land.

== Specimens ==
The appellation &quot;The Marsupilami&quot; originally referred to the individual captured and then adopted by Spirou and Fantasio, which they never bothered to name because he was the only known specimen. The &quot;Spirou &amp; Fantasio&quot; album &quot;Le nid des Marsupilamis&quot; introduces more marsupilami characters, none of whom are in captivity; the album is mostly concerned with a documentary-within-the-comic about the life of a family of marsupilamis living in the wild in Palombia. The later spin-off series &quot;Marsupilami&quot;, drawn by Batem, stars this family, and the title of the series, &quot;Marsupilami&quot;, refers to the father in this family, who is also unnamed, and not to the pet Marsupilami owned by Spirou and Fantasio.

In these series, Marsupilami&#x27;s wife is referred to as Marsupilamie (a female version of the name) but their three young are named, respectively, Bibi, Bibu and Bobo. Mars the Black is another specimen, which first appears in the album &quot;Mars the Black&quot;. A former captive marsupilami, he first finds it hard to live again in the forest. After failing to seduce Marsupilamie, he becomes jealous of Marsupilami and nearly gets into a fight with him. Later, he meets a black female marsupilami, named Venus, who becomes his mate. In &quot;Baby Prinz&quot;, another specimen, an elderly male who lives in a zoo, is featured. Altogether, that comes to eight specimens in Palombia, plus Spirou and Fantasio&#x27;s pet.

Marsupilamis have been shown with multiple different fur colourations – yellow, yellow with black spots, black, white, white with black spots, and black with yellow spots. The most frequently seen fur colours are yellow with black spots, yellow with no spots, and black all over, as these are the variations seen within the main Marsupilami family in the &quot;Marsupilami&quot; comic series; these are also the fur colours that are regularly seen in the French animated series featuring the same family.

===&quot;Marsupilami&quot;===
By the late 1960s, Franquin decided to retire from drawing the &quot;Spirou &amp; Fantasio&quot; series, which was passed to a new artist, Jean-Claude Fournier. Franquin did not give permission for the character to continue appearing in the series after the first Fournier story, &quot;Le faiseur d&#x27;or&quot; (&quot;The Gold Maker&quot;), in which Franquin drew the Marsupilami himself. Spirou&#x27;s Marsupilami ceased to feature in the comics after that, and was absent from &quot;Spirou &amp; Fantasio&quot; until 2016.

In 1987, Franquin launched a new series centering around the Marsupilami with the new publishing house, Marsu Productions. This series featured the Marsupilami family which had appeared in &quot;Le nid des Marsupilamis&quot;.

The first four volumes were illustrated by both Franquin and Batem. From the fifth volume onwards, Batem is the sole illustrator of the series.

The stories in the first two volumes were written by Greg. Afterwards, Greg stopped working on the series, and the next seven volumes were written by Yann. Various others have written for the series since; the most recent writer is Colman, who has received writing credits in the twelve most recent volumes.

The first published album of the series is &quot;La Queue du Marsupilami&quot;. In 2002, an album #0 was published, consisting of short stories featuring the Marsupilami, drawn by Franquin before 1987.

====Other====

* Marsupilami makes an appearance in Asterix and the Big Fight (1964), as a side-show attraction among the many that spring up in anticipation of the titular contest. The stall presenting the Marsupilami is run by Menagerix, who has an image of it as an advertisement of his tent.
* &quot;L&#x27;Encyclopédie du Marsupilami&quot;, published in 1991, is an &quot;Encyclopedia&quot; about the natural history of the Marsupilami, not a comic book. Text is by Cambier and Verhoest, art by Batem and Franquin.
* &quot;Gaston et le Marsupilami&quot; was published by Dupuis in 1978. This album groups all the short stories featuring both Gaston Lagaffe and Marsupilami, previously published in &quot;Spirou&quot; magazine. All these strips were then published in the album &quot;Capturez un Marsupilami&quot;.
* In December 2006, an illustrated book series featuring the Marsupilami as the main character was created in the Bibliothèque Rose Collection, published by Hachette. Scenarios are taken from the animated series &quot;Mon ami Marsupilami&quot;.
* A short-lived series produced in connection to the TV series was published from 1993 to 1994 in the American &quot;Disney Adventures&quot; magazine. Some stories were also reprinted in the German magazine &quot;Limit&quot;.
* Several Marsupilami cameos and tributes have been produced in Franco-Belgian comics; among the earliest was in Jijé&#x27;s series &quot;Blondin et Cirage&quot;, which was another series published in &quot;Spirou&quot; magazine during Franquin&#x27;s tenure on &quot;Spirou &amp; Fantasio&quot;. In the volume &quot;Les soucoupes volantes&quot; (1956), the characters Blondin and Cirage find an African Marsupilami, &quot;Marsupilamus africanus&quot;, which is a slightly different species than the South American species &quot;Marsupilamus fantasii&quot;. The African Marsupilami species is tailless and has a stockier build.

==English-language publication of comics==
An early example of an English-language translation of &quot;Spirou &amp; Fantasio&quot; was published in 1960, when the Franquin story &quot;Le nid des Marsupilamis&quot; was printed in the weekly British boys&#x27; magazine &quot;Knockout&quot;, under the title &quot;Dickie and Birdbath Watch the Woggle.&quot; In that early localization, Spirou was called &quot;Dickie&quot;, Fantasio was &quot;Birdbath&quot;, Seccotine was &quot;Cousin Constance&quot;, the Marsupilami was &quot;the Woggle&quot;, and the female Marsupilami was &quot;the Wiggle.&quot;

One album of &quot;Spirou &amp; Fantasio&quot; featuring Marsupilami, number 15, was translated to English by Fantasy Flight Publishing in 1995. Plans on releasing number 16 ended halfway through the translation process, due to bad sales.

In 2007, Egmont&#x27;s subsidiary Euro Books translated the &quot;Spirou &amp; Fantasio&quot; albums numbered 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 and 14 into English for the Indian market.
The Marsupilami was renamed &quot;Beastie&quot; in these translations.

The British publishing company Cinebook have published English-language translations of &quot;Spirou &amp; Fantasio&quot;, including some of Franquin&#x27;s albums featuring the Marsupilami. The first of Franquin&#x27;s albums that they translated was &quot;The Marsupilami Thieves&quot;, which they released in 2013. In 2017, Cinebook began to release English translations of the spin-off series &quot;Marsupilami&quot;.

==Animation==

===Disney animation===

Disney&#x27;s version of the Marsupilami first appeared on television in his short series of the program &quot;Raw Toonage&quot; in 1992, and was then spun off into his own &quot;eponymous show&quot; on the CBS network and Syndication in 1993. Marsupilami&#x27;s supporting characters included among others Maurice the gorilla, Stewart the elephant, Eduardo the jaguar, Leonardo the lion, and Norman the poacher. The original Marsupilami stories by Franquin never featured a gorilla or elephant in the Marsupilami&#x27;s wild habitat, since those species are native to Africa, whereas the Marsupilami species in the comics was said to come from South America. Another change is that Marsupilami can speak; his comic counterpart can only mimic sound like a parrot. In this version, Marsupilami is voiced by Steve Mackall. Shnookums and Meat was a secondary segment on this show.

There were thirteen episodes in the series, and the series lasted one season. Reruns of the show were aired on The Disney Channel (from October 1994 to June 1995), and later on Toon Disney. 

Animators Tony Bancroft and Michael Surrey are in the character design ending credits.

====Lawsuit====
===Marathon/Samka animation===
====Season 1 – Marsupilami (2000)====
A second animated series, this time produced in France, premiered in March 2000 and ran for 26 episodes on the French television channel Canal J. Produced by Marathon Productions and Marsu Productions, this series more closely followed the character in the original comic.

In this first season, there&#x27;s a more comedic side. Marsupilami went on adventures alone or with his family (his wife Marsupilamie and their three young, Bibi, Bibu and Bobo). For example, in one episode he saved a group of circus animals, got them back to the city and saved the circus from closing. In another, he had to go to the city again to save one of his young, captured by their constant enemy, the hunter Bring M. Backalive.

====Season 2 – My Friend Marsupilami (2003)====
In the 26-episode Marsupilami and his family become best friends with a human family, The Newmans, that comes to live near them. Amanda is a Marsupilami researcher, while her husband David is a computer technician that works from home and they have two children, Leo and toddler Zoe. Leo and Marsupilami become best friends and they have many adventures, with both new friends and old enemies, like Backalive.

====Seasons 3–4 – Marsupilami Hoobah Hoobah Hop! (2009–2010)====
The third series, which premiered in 2009, features a preteen boy named Hector Forster and his aunt Diane Forster, who are going to live in the jungle for one year to study its fauna and flora. They become best friends with the Marsupilami family. Their main enemies are megalomaniac industrialist and jungle-hater Felicia Devort, who plans to level out the Palombian jungle and build the Devort City megalopolis in its place, and her two henchmen, and Blouprint. Their old enemy, hunter Bring M. Backalive, also appears.

Samka Productions replaces Marathon beginning with this series.

====Season 5 – Our Neighbors the Marsupilamis (2012)====
The fourth series featured the Marsupilami family living with veterinarian Bernard Vanderstadt and his four children Sarah, Iris, Isidore and Zoe. Their mother, Caroline, frequently contacts them by phone, but appears in the last three episodes. Once again Backalive makes an appearance.

Marathon&#x27;s Marsupilami series has been broadcast in 37 countries. Among the countries to have received at least one season are Germany (Super RTL), Algeria (Programme National), Belgium (RTL TVI), Canada (Télé-Quebec and Unis TV), Estonia (ETV), Bulgaria (Super7), United Kingdom (Channel 4), Spain (Antena 3, Disney Channel, Toon Disney and TV3), Finland (MTV3), Cyprus (CyBC), Greece (Alter Channel), Ireland (RTÉ), Italy (Italia 1), Portugal (Prisvideo), Switzerland (TSR), Russia (THT Network), Hungary (Minimax), Slovenia (RTV), Serbia (Happy TV and Minimax), Montenegro (Happy TV and Minimax), Bosnia and Herzegovina (Minimax), North Macedonia (Minimax), Morocco (2M TV), Turkey (Yumurcak TV), Sri Lanka (Rupavahini), Mexico (Canal 22), Brazil (Rede Globo and SBT), Venezuela (RCTV), Indonesia (Rajawali Televisi and RCTI), Malaysia (TV3 and TV9), the Africa Pansat (CFI), Latin America (ZAZ), the Near East and Middle East (TV5 and E-Junior), Vietnam (HTV7), Thailand (United Broadcasting Corporation), South Korea (EBS), Iceland (Sjónvarpið), and South Africa (SABC).

===Belvision animation===
In 2019, it was announced that a new animated series &quot;The Marsupilamis&quot; was in development from Belgian studio Belvision. The new series focuses on three marsupilamis named Hope, Twister and Punch. It will set to air in 2025.

==Movies==
&quot;Houba! On the Trail of the Marsupilami&quot; is a live-action, animated, comedy adventure film directed by Alain Chabat and released in 2012. Chabat himself stars in the movie alongside Jamel Debbouze, Frédéric Testot, Géraldine Nakache, Lambert Wilson, Patrick Timsit, Liya Kebede, Aïssa Maïga and The Great Khali. Though Marsupilami and his family are featured prominently, the movie features new characters rather than any of the established cast from the comics or television shows. The central focus is on French reporter Dan Geraldo (Chabat) and Palombian vet Pablito Camaron (Debbouze), whose name humorously translates to &quot;Little Pablo Shrimp&quot;, as they go searching for the indigenous Paya people led by Queen Paya (Kebede). The duo end up in a complicated plot involving the Marsupilami, an evil botanist (Testot) who discovers the elixir of youth, and a major, (Timsit) whom the botanist teams up with to overthrow the Palombian president (Wilson) and said president&#x27;s love for Celine Dion.

<text>Raw Toonage is an American animated cartoon program that premiered on CBS on September 19, and ended on December 5, 1992, after 12 episodes or 39 shorts and segments had been broadcast. The program was preceded by a &quot;He&#x27;s Bonkers&quot; theatrical short titled &quot;Petal to the Metal&quot; that aired in August 7, 1992.

&quot;Bonkers&quot; was spun off from the &quot;He&#x27;s Bonkers&quot; short series and &quot;Marsupilami&quot; was spun off from &quot;Marsupilami&quot; short series of the program in 1993. &quot;The Shnookums &amp; Meat Funny Cartoon Show&quot; then was spun off from &quot;Marsupilami&quot; in 1995.

* Red = Totally Tasteless Video — 11 shorts that don&#x27;t have any logical or chronological connection.

==History and production==
The idea for the show had an unusual genesis. Walt Disney Television Animation was developing a 65-episode half-hour series for their Disney Afternoon block entitled &quot;He&#x27;s Bonkers D. Bobcat&quot;. The premise was similar to &quot;Who Framed Roger Rabbit&quot;, as the series dealt with the lead character&#x27;s adventures post-stardom. The actual production of this series was troubled. At some point, someone had the post-modern idea to actually make the cartoons that Bonkers had starred in before becoming a policeman, and &quot;Disney&#x27;s Raw Toonage&quot; was born. At the same time, Michael Eisner had purchased the rights to the popular Belgian comic strip Marsupilami created by André Franquin. &quot;Totally Tasteless Video&quot; was intended as a satire of popular culture. A host segment was added to give the program the familiar feel of the &quot;World of Disney&quot; show.

Due to the shorter production schedule, &quot;Disney&#x27;s Raw Toonage&quot; was on the air before the above-mentioned half-hour program, thus adding some credibility to the back story. The program typically opens with an introduction by a famous character from Disney (such as Goofy with his style from &quot;Disney&#x27;s Goof Troop&quot;), who attempts to share some of their expertise with the audience; then the show has a few of the above-mentioned shorts chained in a row, rounding out the half hour.

===He&#x27;s Bonkers===

The premise of the &quot; He&#x27;s Bonkers&quot; shorts is that Bonkers is a delivery person or a proto-hero, usually assisted by Jitters A. Dog. Conflict is provided by Bonkers&#x27; love for Fawn Deer, who mainly reciprocates his love for her. Bonkers also has a strict boss or an arch enemy, called Grumbles the Grizzly. Jitters, Fawn and Grumbles also appear in the series &quot;Bonkers&quot;. Each of the &quot;He&#x27;s Bonkers&quot; shorts were eventually included in 4 special extra compilation episodes of the half-hour series. &quot;He&#x27;s Bonkers&quot; series has 12 shorts overall.

===Marsupilami===

The &quot;Marsupilami&quot; shorts took the look of the character from the Belgian comic, but the characterization differs significantly; Marsupilami is more anthropomorphized, and speaks the language of the human characters fluently, Marsupilami in the comics can only say variations of &quot;houba&quot; and mimic sounds like a parrot. The secondary characters in Disney&#x27;s Marsupilami series are completely different from those of the comics; in the Disney cartoons, Marsupilami is most often opposed by Norman, who appears in various different roles. Every one but three (&quot;Wannabe Ruler?&quot;, &quot;The Young and the Nestless&quot;, and &quot;Hot Spots&quot;) of the &quot;Marsupilami&quot; shorts were not included in the half-hour &quot;Marsupilami&quot; series. Marsupilami short series has 16 shorts overall.

===Totally Tasteless Video===

&quot;Totally Tasteless Video&quot; did each show in a different style. They were stories edited by Tom Minton, who would later write &quot;Pinky and the Brain&quot; at Warner Bros. The first &quot;Totally Tasteless Video&quot; short is a parody of movie coming attraction trailers, followed by a spoof on &quot;Doogie Howser, M.D.&quot; Other notable shorts involve a badly animated superhero, a prehistoric spoof of &quot;Magnum, P.I.&quot;, an exorchicken fighting chicken ghosts that haunt a family, and a Robin Hood twist in the Jay Ward style of cartoons. &quot;Totally Tasteless Video&quot; series has 11 shorts overall and it didn&#x27;t have its spin-off tv series.

Larry Latham produced and directed the &quot;He&#x27;s Bonkers&quot;, &quot;Totally Tasteless Video&quot;, and host segments; Ed Wexler produced and directed &quot;Marsupilami&quot;. At least one of the &quot;Marsupilami&quot; cartoons was produced with the idea of a theatrical run in mind.

Reruns of the program were aired on Disney Channel, and Toon Disney. &quot;Disney&#x27;s Raw Toonage&quot; was nominated for a Daytime Emmy in the category of outstanding writing in an animated program and Outstanding Music Direction and Composition in 1993. Music was composed by Stephen James Taylor (character themes and underscore), Mark Watters, Eric Schmidt, Jerry Grant, Walter Murphy, and Craig Stuart Garfinkle. As of 2002, this program is no longer shown following a lawsuit filed against Disney for the breach of contract with use of the character Marsupilami in 1997 as the rights were handed back to Marsu Productions few years later.

<doc id="358677" wikidata="Q1456974" url="?curid=358677" title="Obedience">
<text>Obedience, in human behavior, is a form of &quot;social influence in which a person yields to explicit instructions or orders from an authority figure&quot;. Obedience is generally distinguished from compliance, which some authors define as behavior influenced by peers while others use it as a more general term for positive responses to another individual&#x27;s request, and from conformity, which is behavior intended to match that of the majority. Depending on context, obedience can be seen as moral, immoral, or amoral. For example, in psychological research, individuals are usually confronted with immoral demands designed to elicit an internal conflict. If individuals still choose to submit to the demand, they are acting obediently.

Humans have been shown to be obedient in the presence of perceived legitimate authority figures, as shown by the Milgram experiment in the 1960s, which was carried out by Stanley Milgram to find out how the Nazis managed to get ordinary people to take part in the mass murders of the Holocaust. The experiment showed that obedience to authority was the norm, not the exception. Regarding obedience, Milgram said that &quot;Obedience is as basic an element in the structure of social life as one can point to. Some system of authority is a requirement of all communal living, and it is only the man dwelling in isolation who is not forced to respond, through defiance or submission, to the commands of others.&quot; A similar conclusion was reached in the Stanford prison experiment.

Although other fields have studied obedience, social psychology has been primarily responsible for the advancement of research on obedience. It has been studied experimentally in several different ways.

====Milgram&#x27;s experiment====
In one classical study, Stanley Milgram (as part of the Milgram experiment) created a highly controversial yet often replicated study. Like many other experiments in psychology, Milgram&#x27;s setup involved deception of the participants. In the experiment, subjects were told they were going to take part in a study of the effects of punishment on learning. In reality, the experiment focuses on people&#x27;s willingness to obey malevolent authority. Each subject served as a teacher of associations between arbitrary pairs of words. After meeting the &quot;teacher&quot; at the beginning of the experiment, the &quot;learner&quot; (an accomplice of the experimenter) sat in another room and could be heard, but not seen. Teachers were told to give the &quot;learner&quot; electric shocks of increasing severity for each wrong answer. If subjects questioned the procedure, the &quot;researcher&quot; (again, an accomplice of Milgram) would encourage them to continue. Subjects were told to ignore the agonized screams of the learner, his desire to be untied and stop the experiment, and his pleas that his life was at risk and that he suffered from a heart condition. The experiment, the &quot;researcher&quot; insisted, had to go on. The dependent variable in this experiment was the voltage amount of shocks administered.

====Zimbardo&#x27;s experiment====
The other classical study on obedience was conducted at Stanford University during the 1970s. Phillip Zimbardo was the main psychologist responsible for the experiment. In the Stanford Prison Experiment, college age students were put into a pseudo prison environment in order to study the impacts of &quot;social forces&quot; on participants behavior. Unlike the Milgram study in which each participant underwent the same experimental conditions, here using random assignment half the participants were prison guards and the other half were prisoners. The experimental setting was made to physically resemble a prison while simultaneously inducing &quot;a psychological state of imprisonment&quot;.

====Results====
The Milgram study found that most participants would obey orders even when obedience posed severe harm to others. With encouragement from a perceived authority figure, about two-thirds of the participants were willing to administer the highest level of shock to the learner. This result was surprising to Milgram because he thought that &quot;subjects have learned from childhood that it is a fundamental breach of moral conduct to hurt another person against his will&quot;. Milgram attempted to explain how ordinary people were capable of performing potentially lethal acts against other human beings by suggesting that participants may have entered into an agentic state, where they allowed the authority figure to take responsibility for their own actions. Another unanticipated discovery was the tension that the procedure caused. Subjects expressed signs of tension and emotional strain especially after administering the powerful shocks. 3 of the subjects had full-blown uncontrollable seizures, and on one occasion the experiment was stopped.

Zimbardo obtained similar results as the guards in the study obeyed orders and turned aggressive. Prisoners likewise were hostile to and resented their guards. The cruelty of the &quot;guards&quot; and the consequent stress of the &quot;prisoners,&quot; forced Zimbardo to terminate the experiment prematurely, after 6 days.

=== Modern methods and results ===
The previous two studies greatly influenced how modern psychologists think about obedience. Milgram&#x27;s study in particular generated a large response from the psychology community. In a modern study, Jerry Burger replicated Milgram&#x27;s method with a few alterations. Burger&#x27;s method was identical to Milgram&#x27;s except when the shocks reached 150 volts, participants decided whether or not they wanted to continue and then the experiment ended (base condition). To ensure the safety of the participants, Burger added a two-step screening process; this was to rule out any participants that may react negatively to the experiment. In the modeled refusal condition, two confederates were used, where one confederate acted as the learner and the other was the teacher. The teacher stopped after going up to 90 volts, and the participant was asked to continue where the confederate left off. This methodology was considered more ethical because many of the adverse psychological effects seen in previous studies&#x27; participants occurred after moving past 150 volts. Additionally, since Milgram&#x27;s study only used men, Burger tried to determine if there were differences between genders in his study and randomly assigned equal numbers of men and women to the experimental conditions.

Using data from his previous study, Burger probed participant&#x27;s thoughts about obedience. Participants&#x27; comments from the previous study were coded for the number of times they mentioned &quot;personal responsibility and the learner&#x27;s well being&quot;. The number of prods the participants used in the first experiment were also measured.

Another study that used a partial replication of Milgram&#x27;s work changed the experimental setting. In one of the Utrecht University studies on obedience, participants were instructed to make a confederate who was taking an employment test feel uncomfortable. Participants were told to make all of the instructed stress remarks to the confederate that ultimately made him fail in the experimental condition, but in the control condition they were not told to make stressful remarks. The dependent measurements were whether or not the participant made all of the stress remarks (measuring absolute obedience) and the number of stress remarks (relative obedience).

Following the Utrecht studies, another study used the stress remarks method to see how long participants would obey authority. The dependent measures for this experiment were the number of stress remarks made and a separate measure of personality designed to measure individual differences.

Neuroscience has only recently begun to approach the question of obedience, bringing novel but complementary perspectives on how obeying or issuing commands impacts brain functioning, fostering conditions for moral transgressions. The experimental protocol, inspired by Milgram, does not rely on deception and involves real behaviors. A participant assigned the role of agent must either freely decide or receive orders from the experimenter to deliver or withhold a mildly painful electric shock to another participant (the &quot;victim&quot;) in exchange for €0.05. In a study conducted in 2020, fMRI results indicated that seeing the shock delivered to the victim triggered activations in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and the anterior insula (AI), key brain regions associated with empathy. However, such activations were lower in the coerced condition compared to the free-choice condition, consistent with participants&#x27; subjective perception of the victim’s pain. Activity in brain regions associated with the interpersonal feeling of guilt was also reduced when participants obeyed orders compared to acting freely. Other studies showed that the sense of agency, as measured through the implicit task of time perception, was reduced in the coerced compared to the free-choice condition, suggesting that the sense of agency diminishes when individuals obey orders compared to acting freely. These neuroscience studies highlight how obeying orders alters our natural aversion to hurting others.

====Results====
Burger&#x27;s first study had results similar to the ones found in Milgram&#x27;s previous study. The rates of obedience were very similar to those found in the Milgram study, showing that participants&#x27; tendency to obey has not declined over time. Additionally, Burger found that both genders exhibited similar behavior, suggesting that obedience will occur in participants independent of gender.
In Burger&#x27;s follow-up study, he found that participants that worried about the well-being of the learner were more hesitant to continue the study. He also found that the more the experimenter prodded the participant to continue, the more likely they were to stop the experiment.
The Utrecht University study also replicated Milgram&#x27;s results. They found that although participants indicated they did not enjoy the task, over 90% of them completed the experiment.
The Bocchiaro and Zimbardo study had similar levels of obedience compared to the Milgram and Utrecht studies. They also found that participants would either stop the experiment at the first sign of the learner&#x27;s pleas or would continue until the end of the experiment (called &quot;the foot in the door scenario&quot;).

In addition to the above studies, additional research using participants from different cultures (including Spain, Australia, and Jordan) also found participants to be obedient.
===Implications===
One of the major assumptions of obedience research is that the effect is caused only by the experimental conditions, and Thomas Blass&#x27; research contests this point, as in some cases participant factors involving personality could potentially influence the results.
In one of Blass&#x27; reviews on obedience, he found that participant&#x27;s personalities can impact how they respond to authority, as people that were high in authoritarian submission were more likely to obey. He replicated this finding in his own research, as in one of his experiments, he found that when watching portions of the original Milgram studies on film, participants placed less responsibility on those punishing the learner when they scored high on measures of authoritarianism.

In addition to personality factors, participants who are resistant to obeying authority had high levels of social intelligence.

==Other research==
Obedience can also be studied outside of the Milgram paradigm in fields such as economics or political science. One economics study that compared obedience to a tax authority in the lab versus at home found that participants were much more likely to pay participation tax when confronted in the lab. This finding implies that even outside of experimental settings, people will forgo potential financial gain to obey authority.

Another study involving political science measured public opinion before and after a Supreme Court case debating whether or not states can legalize physician assisted suicide. They found that participants&#x27; tendency to obey authorities was not as important to public opinion polling numbers as religious and moral beliefs. Although prior research has demonstrated that the tendency to obey persists across settings, this finding suggests that at personal factors like religion and morality can limit how much people obey authority.

==Other experiments==

===The Hofling hospital experiment===

Both the Milgram and Stanford experiments were conducted in research settings. In 1966, psychiatrist Charles K. Hofling published the results of a field experiment on obedience in the nurse–physician relationship in its natural hospital setting. Nurses, unaware they were taking part in an experiment, were ordered by unknown doctors to administer dangerous doses of a (fictional) drug to their patients. Although several hospital rules disallowed administering the drug under the circumstances, 21 out of the 22 nurses would have given the patient an overdose.

==Cultural attitudes==


Many traditional cultures regard obedience as a virtue; historically, societies have expected children to obey their elders (compare patriarchy or matriarchy), slaves their owners, serfs their lords in feudal society, lords their king, and everyone God. Even long after slavery ended in the United States, the Black codes required black people to obey and submit to whites, on pain of lynching. Compare the religious ideal of surrender and its importance in Islam (the word &quot;Islam&quot; can literally mean &quot;surrender&quot;).

In some Christian weddings, obedience was formally included along with honor and love as part of the bride&#x27;s (but not the bridegroom&#x27;s) marriage vow. This came under attack with women&#x27;s suffrage and the feminist movement. the inclusion of this promise to obey has become optional in some denominations.

In the Catholic Church, obedience is seen as one of the evangelical counsels, &quot;undertaken in a spirit of faith and love in the following of Christ&quot;.

Learning to obey adult rules is a major part of the socialization process in childhood, and many techniques are used by adults to modify the behavior of children. Additionally, extensive training is given in armies to make soldiers capable of obeying orders in situations where an untrained person would not be willing to follow orders. Soldiers are initially ordered to do seemingly trivial things, such as picking up the sergeant&#x27;s hat off the floor, marching in just the right position, or marching and standing in formation. The orders gradually become more demanding, until an order to the soldiers to place themselves into the midst of gunfire gets an instinctively obedient response.

==Factors affecting obedience==

===Embodiment of prestige or power===

When the Milgram experimenters were interviewing potential volunteers, the participant selection process itself revealed several factors that affected obedience, outside of the actual experiment.

Interviews for eligibility were conducted in an abandoned complex in Bridgeport, Connecticut. Despite the dilapidated state of the building, the researchers found that the presence of a Yale professor as stipulated in the advertisement affected the number of people who obeyed. This was not further researched to test obedience without a Yale professor because Milgram had not intentionally staged the interviews to discover factors that affected obedience. A similar conclusion was reached in the Stanford prison experiment.

In the actual experiment, prestige or the appearance of power was a direct factor in obedience—particularly the presence of men dressed in gray laboratory coats, which gave the impression of scholarship and achievement and was thought to be the main reason why people complied with administering what they thought was a painful or dangerous shock. A similar conclusion was reached in the Stanford prison experiment.

Raj Persaud, in an article in the BMJ, comments on Milgram&#x27;s attention to detail in his experiment:
Despite the fact that prestige is often thought of as a separate factor, it is, in fact, merely a subset of power as a factor. Thus, the prestige conveyed by a Yale professor in a laboratory coat is only a manifestation of the experience and status associated with it and/or the social status afforded by such an image.

=== Agentic state and other factors ===
According to Milgram, &quot;the essence of obedience consists in the fact that a person comes to view himself as the instrument for carrying out another person&#x27;s wishes, and he therefore no longer sees himself as responsible for his actions. Once this critical shift of viewpoint has occurred in the person, all of the essential features of obedience follow.&quot; Thus, &quot;the major problem for the subject is to recapture control of his own regnant processes once he has committed them to the purposes of the experimenter.&quot; Besides this hypothetical agentic state, Milgram proposed the existence of other factors accounting for the subject&#x27;s obedience: politeness, awkwardness of withdrawal, absorption in the technical aspects of the task, the tendency to attribute impersonal quality to forces that are essentially human, a belief that the experiment served a desirable end, the sequential nature of the action, and anxiety.

=== Belief perseverance ===
Another explanation of Milgram&#x27;s results invokes belief perseverance as the underlying cause. What &quot;people cannot be counted on is to realize that a seemingly benevolent authority is in fact malevolent, even when they are faced with overwhelming evidence which suggests that this authority is indeed malevolent. Hence, the underlying cause for the subjects&#x27; striking conduct could well be conceptual, and not the alleged &#x27;capacity of man to abandon his humanity ... as he merges his unique personality into larger institutional structures.&quot;&#x27;

<doc id="358681" wikidata="Q709440" url="?curid=358681" title="Yevgeny Svetlanov">
<text>Yevgeny Fyodorovich Svetlanov (; 6 September 1928 – 3 May 2002) was a Soviet and Russian conductor, composer, and pianist.

==Life and work==
Svetlanov was born in Moscow and studied conducting with Alexander Gauk at the Moscow Conservatory. From 1955 he conducted at the Bolshoi Theatre, being appointed principal conductor there in 1962. From 1965 he was principal conductor of the USSR State Symphony Orchestra (now the Russian State Symphony Orchestra). In 1979 he was appointed principal guest conductor of the London Symphony Orchestra. Svetlanov was also music director of the Residentie Orchestra (The Hague) from 1992 to 2000 and the Swedish Radio Symphony Orchestra from 1997 to 1999.

In 2000 Svetlanov was fired from his post with the Russian State Symphony Orchestra by the minister of culture of Russia, Mikhail Shvydkoy. The reason given was that Svetlanov was spending too much time conducting abroad and not enough time in Moscow.

Svetlanov was particularly noted for his interpretations of Russian works – he covered the whole range of Russian music, from Mikhail Glinka to the present day. He was also one of the few Russian conductors to conduct the entire symphonic output of Gustav Mahler.

His own compositions included a String Quartet (1948), Daugava, Symphonic Poem (1952), Siberian Fantasy for Orchestra, Op. 9 (1953), &quot;Images d&#x27;Espagne&quot;, Rhapsody for orchestra (1954), Symphony (1956), Festive Poem (1966), &quot;Russian Variations&quot; for harp and orchestra (1975), Piano Concerto in c minor (1976) and Poem for Violin and Orchestra &quot;To the Memory of David Oistrakh&quot; (1975). He composed &quot;Siberian Fantasy&quot; in 1953/54, in collaboration with Igor Yakushenko [1932-1999].

Svetlanov was also an extremely competent pianist, three notable recordings being Sergei Rachmaninoff&#x27;s Piano Trio No. 2 in D minor and Cello Sonata op. 19, and a disc of Nikolai Medtner&#x27;s piano music.

Warner Music France has issued an &quot;Édition officielle Yevgeny Svetlanov&quot; featuring Svetlanov&#x27;s legacy of recordings as conductor and pianist, which by July 2008 had run to 35 volumes of CDs, often multiple-CD boxed sets. The biggest of these is the 16-CD box of the complete symphonies of Nikolai Myaskovsky, to whose music Svetlanov was devoted.

==Legacy==
The first Airbus A330 for Aeroflot and the asteroid 4135 Svetlanov were named after him. The State Academic Symphony Orchestra of the Russian Federation and an international conducting competition also carry his name.

<text>Mu&#x27;awiya Ould Sid&#x27;Ahmed al-Taya (born 28 November 1941) is a Mauritanian military officer and politician who served as the President of Mauritania from 1984 to 2005. He also served as the fifth Prime minister of Mauritania from 1981 to 1992 except for a brief period in 1984. 

Born in Atar, French Mauritania, al-Taya studied at Franco-Arab school and then French military school. He participated in the Western Sahara War against the Polisario Front. Al-Taya was appointed Chief of the Army staff in July 1980 and then as Prime minister in April 1981 after an unsuccessful coup attempt against Mohamed Haidalla. 

Having come to power through a bloodless military coup, he won the 2003 elections and was ousted by a military coup in 2005. During his presidency, he pursued policies of Arab nationalism and deepening ties with the United States. He established close relations with Saddam Hussein of Iraq and had a pro-Iraqi stance on the Gulf War. Mu&#x27;awiya al-Taya himself is sometimes termed &quot;Saddam Hussein of Africa&quot;. 

==Early life and education==
Mu&#x27;awiya Ould Sidi Ahmed al-Taya was born on 28 November 1941 in Atar, then part of French Mauritania. Al-Taya attended a Franco-Arabic Primary School from 1949 to 1955. He then attended Rosso High School in southern Mauritania. After graduation, he attended a French military school in 1960 and graduated as an officer the next year. In 1975, he received strategic training at the French war academy.

In 1978, the Mauritanian Army overthrew Moktar Ould Daddah, the first President of Mauritania, in an attempt to forestall government collapse in the war over Western Sahara against the Polisario Front. Al-Taya was among the conspirators, and quickly gained influence within the government. 

==Presidency (1984–2005)==
After holding various positions in the military, al-Taya was appointed Chief of Staff of the Army in July 1980, during the rule of military head of state Mohamed Haidalla. 

In the aftermath of a failed coup against Haidalla in March 1981, al-Taya was appointed Prime minister on 25 April 1981, replacing civilian Prime minister Sid&#x27;Ahmed Ould Bneijara. He held this office until 8 March 1984, when Haidalla, who was still head of state, took over the post. 

On 12 December 1984, while Haidalla was out of the country, al-Taya seized power and declared himself Chairman of the Military Committee for National Salvation (CMSN). 

In October 1987, al-Taya&#x27;s military government allegedly uncovered a tentative coup d&#x27;état by a group of black army officers, backed, according to the authorities, by Senegal. Several officers were arrested, interrogated, and possibly tortured, leading to the acquittal of only seven. 

=== Mauritania–Senegal border conflict ===
The discord between conflicting visions of Mauritanian society as either black or Arab again rose to the surface during the intercommunal violence that broke out in April 1989. This tension grew when the Mauritania–Senegal border dispute escalated into violence between the two nations.

Even before the war, al-Taya and Abdou Diouf, president of Senegal at the time, had been engaged in a dispute after the completion of dams on the Senegal River. Al-Taya argued that Senegalese representatives in the OMVS had refused to create river harbors during construction, diminishing Mauritania&#x27;s ability to exploit phosphate deposits.

Heightened ethnic tensions created an additional catalyst for the Mauritania–Senegal border conflict, which started as a result of a conflict in Diawara between Moorish Mauritanian herders and Senegalese farmers over grazing rights. The border between Senegal and Mauritania was then closed, and the two nations ended diplomatic ties with each other. 

As the war continued, some Fula and Soninke people were arrested and executed. Al-Taya&#x27;s government initiated a military investigation before implementing a law of amnesty. 

In July 1991, presidents Diouf and al-Taya reached an agreement to end hostilities. On 18 July, Senegal and Mauritania signed a Peace treaty, ending the Mauritania–Senegal border conflict, and on 2 May 1992, the borders reopened to all civilians. 

===Arab nationalism and foreign policy===
the late 1980s, al-Taya had established close co-operation with Iraq, and pursued a strongly Arab nationalist line. Mauritania grew increasingly isolated internationally, and tensions with Western countries grew dramatically after it took a pro-Iraqi position during the Gulf War, although he had received French support and aid in 1984-1987. 

=== Transition to democracy and multi-party system ===
Al-Taya&#x27;s regime began a transition to civilian, multiparty government in 1991; a new Constitution was approved by referendum in July. 

The first multiparty presidential elections were held in January 1992. Al-Taya, as candidate of the newly formed Democratic and Social Republican Party (PRDS), received nearly 63% of the vote, amid opposition claims of serious irregularities and fraud. He won slightly more than 90% of the vote in the following 12 December 1997 presidential election, which was boycotted by major opposition political parties; anticipating fraud, they said that this would make their participation &quot;futile&quot;. 

=== Last years in office ===
The last years of al-Taya&#x27;s rule were marred by unrest within the military and hostility between the regime and the country&#x27;s Islamists. Al-Taya moved away from his initial support of the Iraqi regime of Saddam Hussein at the time of the Gulf War, and moved towards the West. 

On 28 October 1999, Mauritania joined Egypt, Palestine, and Jordan as the fourth member of the Arab League to officially recognize Israel. By doing so, al-Taya formally ended a declared war on Israel that dated from the Six-Day War of June 1967. 

During his administration, al-Taya also began co-operating with the United States in anti-terrorism activities, a policy that was criticized by some human rights organizations. Increasing ties with Israel and the United States served to deepen the opposition to his rule. 

In June 2003, al-Taya&#x27;s government survived a coup attempt, defeating rebel soldiers after two days of heavy fighting in the capital, Nouakchott; the coup leader, Saleh Ould Hanenna, initially escaped capture. Ould Hanenna announced the formation of a rebel group called &quot;the Knights of Change&quot; but was eventually captured in October 2004 and sentenced to life in prison along with other alleged plotters in early 2005. On 7 November 2003 a presidential election was held, which was won by al-Taya with over 67% of the popular vote. The opposition again denounced the result as fraudulent; the second-place candidate, former ruler Ould Haidalla, was arrested both immediately before and after the election, and was accused of plotting a coup. In August 2004, the government arrested more alleged coup plotters, who it said had planned to overthrow al-Taya when he took a planned trip to France; some, however, doubted the existence of this plot and suspected that it was a pretext for a crackdown. In late September, the government claimed to have thwarted yet another plot to oust al-Taya. 

Anticipating an increase in government revenue through the exploitation of natural resources, particularly offshore oil deposits, al-Taya announced an increase in pay for the civil service and pensions in November 2004. 

==Overthrow and exile==
While al-Taya was out of the country for the funeral of King Fahd of Saudi Arabia in early August 2005, soldiers seized government buildings and the state media. The group, which identified itself as the Military Council for Justice and Democracy (CMJD), announced a coup d&#x27;état in a statement run by the state news agency on 3 August: &quot;The armed forces and security forces have unanimously decided to put an end to the totalitarian practices of the deposed regime under which our people have suffered much over the last several years.&quot;

The new military dictatorship said it would remain in power for a maximum of two years to allow time for democratic institutions to be implemented. The Military Council for Justice and Democracy named Col. Ely Ould Mohamed Vall, a top associate of al-Taya for many years, as its head. Al-Taya, on his way back from Fahd&#x27;s funeral, landed in Niamey, the capital of Niger. He met Niger&#x27;s president Mamadou Tandja before going to a villa in Niamey. Speaking to Radio France Internationale on 5 August, al-Taya condemned the coup, saying that there had &quot;never been a more senseless coup in Africa&quot; and that it reminded him of the adage &quot;God save me from my friends, I&#x27;ll take care of my enemies&quot;. 

On 8 August, he unsuccessfully attempted to order the Armed forces to restore him to power. Broad support for the coup appeared to exist across the country; al-Taya&#x27;s own party, PRDS, abandoned him a few days after the coup by endorsing the new regime&#x27;s transitional plan. International reaction to al-Taya&#x27;s overthrow was initially strongly hostile, including the suspension of Mauritania from the African Union, but after several days the new rulers were apparently diplomatically successful in winning tacit international acceptance of their transitional regime. The United States in particular at first called for al-Taya to be restored to power but subsequently backed away from this. 

=== After presidency ===
He left Niger for Banjul, Gambia, on 9 August 2005. After nearly two weeks there, he and his family flew to Qatar, where they arrived on 22 August. 

In April 2006, Vall said that al-Taya could return home as a free citizen, but would not be allowed to take part in the elections that were to mark the end of the transition because, Vall said, his participation could disrupt the transitional process; however, Vall said that he would be able to return to politics after the completion of the transition.

In the March 2007 presidential election, al-Taya is said to have favored former Central Bank Governor Zeine Ould Zeidane. 

In late 2013, al-Taya was appointed a teacher at the Ahmed Bin Mohammad Military School, a military academy in Qatar.

<doc id="358684" wikidata="Q817261" url="?curid=358684" title="The Return of Jafar">
<text>The Return of Jafar (sometimes marketed as Aladdin: The Return of Jafar on re-release) is a 1994 American direct-to-video animated musical fantasy film produced by Walt Disney Pictures and Television. It is the first sequel to Disney&#x27;s 1992 animated feature film, &quot;Aladdin&quot;, made by combining the planned first five episodes of the &quot;Aladdin&quot; animated television series into a feature-length film.

Released on May 20, 1994, in North America, it was the second Disney animated feature film sequel, after &quot;The Rescuers Down Under&quot; (1990), and the first Disney direct-to-video animated feature film. It also marked the first American direct-to-video animated feature film. Gilbert Gottfried, Jonathan Freeman, Scott Weinger, Frank Welker, Brad Kane and Linda Larkin reprise their roles from the first film, with Jason Alexander, Val Bettin, Liz Callaway, and Dan Castellaneta joining the cast.

Although the film serves as the pilot of the television series and received mixed-to-negative reviews, it sold 15million VHS tapes, grossing more than () on a budget of approximately $5 million (), making it one of the best-selling films on home video.

==Plot==

Almost a year after Jafar&#x27;s defeat, Aladdin and Abu have settled into the Palace of Agrabah with Princess Jasmine and her father, the Sultan. Still yearning for adventures, Aladdin foils a criminal group led by the dimwitted Abis Mal and returns their stolen loot to the citizens of Agrabah. Meanwhile, in the desert, Iago escapes from Jafar&#x27;s lamp. Tired of Jafar&#x27;s abuse, Iago refuses Jafar&#x27;s demands to free him, and drops the lamp into a well.

Iago flies to Agrabah, planning to return to the Palace by befriending Aladdin. During his first interaction with Aladdin and Abu, the three are attacked by Abis Mal and his henchmen, and Iago inadvertently saves Aladdin&#x27;s life. In gratitude, Aladdin keeps Iago on the palace grounds, promising to speak with the Sultan on Iago&#x27;s behalf. Abis Mal later finds Jafar&#x27;s lamp in the well and frees him. Hindered by his incompetent new master, Jafar tricks Abis Mal into wasting his first two wishes, then enlists his help in taking revenge on Aladdin. Abis Mal agrees, also desiring revenge on Aladdin.

Meanwhile, the Genie returns to the palace after traveling the world for one year, although his powers are diminished since he was freed from the lamp. At the evening banquet, the Sultan announces Aladdin as the new Royal Vizier. Rajah discovers Iago in the garden and chases him into the banquet. Aladdin asks the Sultan to pardon Iago, but Jasmine is dismayed that Aladdin never confided in her. The Genie and Iago help them reconcile, but the Sultan, though remaining suspicious, temporarily pardons Iago and instructs Aladdin to watch over him. However, Jafar infiltrates the palace and forces Iago to take Aladdin and the Sultan into going on a trip to the waterfall.

During the trip, the Sultan finally forgives Aladdin and Iago, but Jafar, having transformed into a gang of sorcerer horsemen riding dragon-winged horses, ambushes them, sending Aladdin into the waterfall while taking the Sultan, Jasmine, the Genie and Abu as prisoners. Aladdin eventually returns to Agrabah to warn Razoul but Jafar, posing as Jasmine, frames Aladdin for murdering the Sultan, and sentences him to death. Feeling guilty for setting up Aladdin, Iago frees the Genie, who saves Aladdin. Jafar now controls Agrabah, but Aladdin is determined to stop him, and the Genie reveals that the only way to kill Jafar is to destroy his lamp. Iago chooses to leave, but not before Aladdin thanks him for his help.

Jafar demands that Abis Mal free him from the lamp with his third wish, just as Aladdin and his friends confront them to obtain the lamp. Jafar, in his Genie form, ambushes the group, knocks the Genie unconscious and shatters the Carpet. He splits open the Palace gardens, creating a pool of lava, and traps Aladdin on a sinking rock. Iago, having a change of heart, returns and grabs the lamp but is burned and critically injured. With his remaining strength, Iago kicks the lamp into the lava, killing Jafar. With his death, Jafar&#x27;s magic is undone, restoring the Palace gardens and the Carpet. Iago is assumed dead, though he regains consciousness and is forgiven, being allowed back into the Palace. Aladdin ultimately rejects the Sultan&#x27;s offer to become his vizier, having decided he wants to see the world with Jasmine instead.

In a post-credits scene, Abis Mal realizes that he will never get his third wish.

==Production==
Following the success of &quot;The Little Mermaid&quot;, Walt Disney Television Animation subsequently produced an animated television series of the same name that aired on CBS. At the same time, The Disney Afternoon had become a success with television series, such as &quot;DuckTales&quot; and &quot;Chip &#x27;n Dale: Rescue Rangers&quot; airing in a syndicated two-hour time slot. Before the theatrical release of &quot;Aladdin&quot;, Disney commissioned Tad Stones and Alan Zaslove to produce a direct-to-television project that would shepherd its transition from the film into a television series.

While conceiving the sequel, Stones became fascinated with the character Iago, stating, &quot;I said, &#x27;I want the parrot in there,&#x27; but he was trapped in the lamp [at the end of the &quot;Aladdin&quot; movie], so we came up with a story of how he got out and ended up with Aladdin.&quot; As was common with half-hour animated television series at the time, Disney planned to begin the series with an hourlong television special, but Stones suggested that the film should instead be released on home video. The idea was initially met with some resistance from Disney Feature Animation president Peter Schneider and Disney CEO Michael Eisner, who felt it would cheapen Disney&#x27;s brand. Ultimately, layout designer Paul Felix conceived the film&#x27;s opening with the gang of thieves entering a cave, which was later animated at Disney Animation Australia. Impressed with the animation dailies, Disney chairman Jeffrey Katzenberg allowed for the first half to be animated in Australia, while the climax was animated in Japan.

Due to a bitter and highly-publicized falling out over the unauthorised use of his voice in the marketing campaign for &quot;Aladdin&quot;, Robin Williams refused to reprise the role of the Genie. He was replaced by Dan Castellaneta. Stones also claimed that Williams participated in selecting Castellaneta to voice the Genie. It was also the first &quot;Aladdin&quot; full-length production without the original voice of the Sultan, Douglas Seale. He was replaced by Val Bettin, who had previously worked with Disney on &quot;The Great Mouse Detective&quot;, and who would reprise his role in the franchise&#x27;s animated series and &quot;Aladdin and the King of Thieves&quot;.

==Songs==
Songs in the film include:
*&quot;Arabian Nights&quot; by Brian Hannan
*&quot;I&#x27;m Looking Out for Me&quot; by Gilbert Gottfried
*&quot;Nothing in the World (Quite Like a Friend)&quot; by Dan Castellaneta, Brad Kane &amp; Liz Callaway
*&quot;Forget About Love&quot; by Gilbert Gottfried, Brad Kane &amp; Liz Callaway
*&quot;You&#x27;re Only Second Rate&quot; by Jonathan Freeman

==Release==
Instead of the film receiving a theatrical release, Steve Feldstein, director of public relations for Disney&#x27;s home video division, stated that the decision to release &quot;The Return of Jafar&quot; on home video was due to time constraints, claiming that &quot;to put the film in the theatrical pipeline would have taken up to five years&quot;, but releasing it on home video would take &quot;less than two years&quot;. In addition, Feldstein confirmed that financing was also a consideration because producing a direct-to-video feature would be &quot;less costly to make than &quot;Aladdin&quot;&quot;. Likewise, due to an expanding video market, Disney claimed that demand from theatrical and video audiences for Aladdin and other characters was another reason for a speedy follow-up.

==Home media==
&quot;The Return of Jafar&quot; was first released on VHS and LaserDisc in the United States and Canada on May 20, 1994, being the first installment of the direct-to-video sequels. In its first two days, it sold more than 1.5 million VHS copies; more than 4.6 million VHS copies were sold in less than a week. In the United States, more than ten million copies were sold, ranking among the top 15 top-selling videos of all time (at the time), earning $150 million in profits. The film eventually sold 15million units, and grossed approximately $300million worldwide. The sequel&#x27;s success removed what the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; described as &quot;the low-quality stigma&quot; from direct-to-video, and caused Disney, Universal Pictures, and other studios to release more direct-to-video films. For its original direct-to-video release, &quot;The Return of Jafar&quot; was accompanied with a promotional campaign including trailers and inserts in over a million VHS copies of &quot;The Fox and the Hound&quot; (1981), and mail-in rebate coupons for Mattel toys and products from Pillsbury (in the United States only) packaged inside every copy of the VHS cassette of the film.

On July 14, 1998, the film along with &quot;A Goofy Movie&quot; and &quot;The Three Caballeros&quot; was promoted with a $2 instant savings coupon from Walt Disney Home Video, good toward the purchase of &quot;The Spirit of Mickey&quot; (released on that same day) and any one of these three videos.

Originally released on VHS that year, &quot;The Return of Jafar&quot; was reissued on Special Edition DVD and VHS (with &quot;Aladdin:&quot; added to the title) on January 18, 2005, the same day as its direct sequel, &quot;Aladdin and the King of Thieves&quot;, also received a re-release, with a digitally restored picture and remastered sound. The Special Edition DVD, along with the two other films in the series, were placed on moratorium (placed into the Disney Vault) on January 31, 2008, in the United States, and on February 4, 2008, in the United Kingdom. &quot;The Return of Jafar&quot;, along with &quot;Aladdin and the King of Thieves&quot; was released on Blu-ray/DVD/Digital HD Combo Pack on January 5, 2016, as a Disney Movie Club exclusive in North America.

==Reception==
On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an overall approval rating of 33%, based on 12 reviews collected, with a weighted average score of 4.3/10.

David Nusair of Reelfilm.com summed up most of the negative feelings that contributed to this rating:

Despite the mostly negative reception, on the television program &quot;Siskel &amp; Ebert&quot;, the film received a &quot;two thumbs up&quot; from Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert.

Writing for &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;, Steve Daly graded the sequel a &quot;C−&quot;, criticizing it as a &quot;knockoff&quot; that &quot;carries the Disney label and costs about as much as a tape of &quot;Aladdin&quot;, but it&#x27;s clear from the first jerky frame that the same time, care, and creativity didn&#x27;t go into it&quot;.

==Adaptations==
===Comic===
When Disney was publishing its own comics in the mid-90s, it produced a two-issue &quot;Aladdin&quot; comic presenting an alternate version of &quot;The Return of Jafar&quot;. It was titled &quot;The Return of Aladdin&quot;. The comic is introduced by the Peddler from the first film.

The story starts off showing that Aladdin has been particularly bored of palace life. Meanwhile, Jafar has escaped the Cave of Wonders. Iago is given the task of finding the right master for Jafar to manipulate. Their search seems hopeless, for as some people are able to enjoy all three wishes or mess up. They find someone to use the lamp; she is known as Isabella, a master magician. Isabella is similar in appearance to Jafar (although his clothing is green). His first wish is to return to Agrabah Palace (as he performed entertainment for the Sultan in the first film). His second wish is for an army of soldiers to pursue Aladdin and Jasmine when they catch on to Jafar&#x27;s presence. He is persuaded to use his third wish to trap Jafar and Iago in the lamp again, sending them back to the cave. Due to persuasion by the Genie, the Sultan hires Isabella for a permanent entertainment job at the Palace. The end of the story shows the Peddler having a black lamp similar to Jafar&#x27;s, but he claims it to be worthless.

===Video game===
The plot of the film is loosely used in Agrabah, one of the worlds in &quot;Kingdom Hearts II&quot;, and the Peddler appears from the first film. As in the film, Iago escapes from Jafar and does his best to respect Aladdin, Jasmine, Sora, Donald and Goofy, although Jafar cons him into aiding him in his revenge, almost damaging Iago&#x27;s friendship with Aladdin and Sora, but he redeems himself after taking a blow for Aladdin that almost claims his life. The Peddler, at the beginning, comes across Jafar&#x27;s lamp, but sells it to Aladdin, Sora, Donald and Goofy for a rare artifact in the Cave of Wonders. Despite Aladdin sealing the lamp in the Palace dungeon, the greedy Peddler breaks into the dungeon and frees Jafar, unleashing his fury on Agrabah until he is defeated by Sora and company. The Peddler&#x27;s fate is left ambiguous. This was the first Disney sequel to have its plot adapted into a level in the &quot;Kingdom Hearts&quot; series, which was followed by the Grid being an adaptation of &quot;&quot;, and the Caribbean being one of &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean: At World&#x27;s End&quot;.

Furthermore, there is a mild allusion to the Agrabah boss battle in &quot;Kingdom Hearts&quot;. Sora must fight Jafar in Genie form, surrounded by a lava pit with raising and lowering levels, while Iago flies above with Jafar&#x27;s lamp. Only striking the lamp has any effect on Jafar&#x27;s health. This fight also takes place in the second game, &quot;Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories&quot;, and its PlayStation 2 remake. In both versions of &quot;Chain of Memories&quot;, the boss fight is due to the majority of the game being illusions created from Sora&#x27;s memories. A second playable character, Riku, also fights the boss in his mode. The battle is again visited in &quot;Kingdom Hearts Coded&quot; and &quot;Kingdom Hearts Re:coded&quot;.

==Follow-ups==
The film was followed by a television series titled &quot;Aladdin&quot;, which served as the overall third installment, and another direct-to-video sequel, &quot;Aladdin and the King of Thieves&quot;, which was released in 1996. The franchise was later revisited in &quot;Hercules and the Arabian Night&quot;, a crossover episode with the &quot;Hercules&quot; animated series, and in the segment, &quot;More Than a Peacock Princess&quot;, from &quot;Disney Princess Enchanted Tales: Follow Your Dreams&quot;.

<text>Aladdin and the King of Thieves (also known as Aladdin 3: The King of Thieves) is a 1996 American direct-to-video animated musical fantasy adventure film produced by Walt Disney Television Animation. It is the second sequel to Disney&#x27;s 1992 animated feature film &quot;Aladdin&quot;, and it serves as the final chapter and installment of the &quot;Arabian Nights-&quot;inspired Disney franchise beginning with the first film, and continuing with its first direct-to-video sequel &quot;The Return of Jafar&quot; and the animated television series.

The film takes place after the third season of the television series and is inspired by the tale &quot;Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves&quot; from &quot;One Thousand and One Nights&quot;, replacing Ali Baba with Aladdin. For the first time since the original &quot;Aladdin&quot;, the film has a completely new soundtrack instead of the rearranged music from the original film for &quot;The Return of Jafar&quot; and the series. This film also marks the return of Robin Williams, reprising his role as Genie (Dan Castellaneta voices him in the second film, the series and other media).

Although this film serves as the series finale of the television series, the characters also appear in a 1999 crossover episode of the animated series &quot;Hercules&quot;, titled &quot;Hercules and the Arabian Night&quot;, as well as the segment &quot;More Than a Peacock Princess&quot; from the 2007 direct-to-video film &quot;Disney Princess Enchanted Tales: Follow Your Dreams&quot;, both of which occur after this plot. The film received mixed-to-negative reviews, although it was deemed an improvement over &quot;The Return of Jafar&quot;.

== Plot ==

At Agrabah, Aladdin and Princess Jasmine prepare to be married. During the ceremony, the legendary Forty Thieves appear, trying to steal a magical staff. After driving them off, Aladdin and his friends discover the Oracle, a woman within the staff who can answer a single question about absolutely anything to any individual. She hints to Aladdin that all of his questions can be answered by his father, who is still alive, much to everyone&#x27;s surprise. According to her, Aladdin&#x27;s father is with the Forty Thieves, &quot;trapped within their world&quot;.

Aladdin, with Abu, Iago and Carpet, tracks the thieves and stows away into their hideout, Mount Sesame, where he discovers that his father Cassim is actually the King of Thieves, their leader. The two have a heartfelt reunion before Cassim&#x27;s chief subordinate Sa&#x27;luk tries to punish Aladdin for infiltrating their hideout. Cassim, however, suggests that Aladdin instead face the initiation ritual known as &quot;the Challenge&quot;: if he defeats another one of the Forty Thieves, he can take their place. Aladdin defeats Sa&#x27;luk and is welcomed into the band.

Cassim reveals that he left his family in search for the Hand of Midas, an artifact that can transform anything it touches to gold. Cassim believed that, with it, he could return to his family and rescue them from poverty. With the staff, he could question the Oracle for the precise whereabouts of the artifact. Aladdin convinces Cassim to return with him to Agrabah to live an honest life. Initially hesitant, Cassim agrees after realizing that the wedding can be his last chance to get the Oracle.

After spending quality time with Aladdin and his friends, Cassim decides to go forward with his original scheme, with Iago as his new henchman. Meanwhile, Sa&#x27;luk travels to Agrabah and sells out his fellow thieves by telling Razoul, the Captain of Agrabah&#x27;s Royal Guard, the password to their hideout in exchange for immunity from prosecution. After all but seven of the thieves are captured, Razoul learns that Aladdin is one of the forty, and his father Cassim is the King himself. Cassim and Iago try to steal the Oracle but are captured and detained after the Sultan learns of Cassim&#x27;s relationship with the Forty Thieves. Aladdin rescues Cassim and Iago but returns to the palace to take responsibility for his actions. As the Sultan is about to punish Aladdin, the Genie and Jasmine come to his defense, stating that all he wanted was to give his father a second chance. Understanding this, the Sultan accepts Aladdin&#x27;s apology and resumes preparations for the wedding.

Returning to Mount Sesame, Cassim and Iago are captured by Sa&#x27;luk and the remaining seven thieves (Sa&#x27;luk deceived them into believing Cassim had betrayed them to Razoul), who force them to use the Oracle to locate the Hand of Midas. The Oracle directs them to the Vanishing Isle, a marble fortress built on the back of an enormous turtle that periodically dives to the bottom of the ocean, where the Hand is hidden. Iago escapes and goes to lead Aladdin, Jasmine, Abu and Carpet to Cassim.

Aladdin frees and reconciles with his father. Working together, they retrieve the Hand just as the turtle is starting to submerge. However, they are ambushed by Sa&#x27;luk, who takes Aladdin hostage, demanding that Cassim surrender the Hand. Cassim throws the Hand to Sa&#x27;luk, who grabs it by the wrong end and is transformed into a lifeless gold statue. Realizing that his obsession has brought only trouble and that his son is actually his ultimate treasure, Cassim throws the Hand into the ship with the remaining thieves aboard, turning it into gold and sinking it.

That night, Aladdin and Jasmine are married with all their friends and family present. Cassim watches this from afar because he is still a wanted man, and Iago decides to join him on his travels. Aladdin and Cassim wave goodbye to each other as the former kisses Jasmine while the latter rides off into the moonlight with Iago.

== Production ==
Following the success of &quot;The Return of Jafar&quot;, Disney announced in January 1995 that a third film was in production. In June, it was scheduled for a home-video release in 1996. In September 1995, it was confirmed that Robin Williams would reprise the role of the Genie reportedly for a $1 million salary, after he received an apology from Joe Roth for Disney breaching an agreement not to use his voice to merchandise products inspired by &quot;Aladdin&quot;. With Williams on board, all recordings and animation footage of Dan Castellaneta as the Genie was scrapped, and all of the Genie&#x27;s scenes were rewritten to fit Williams&#x27; comedic style.

=== Songs ===

=== Adaptation ===
Two comic adaptations of the movie were on sale in September 1996.
* The first is in Marvel Comics&#x27; &quot;Disney Comic Hits&quot;, #13.
* The second is in &quot;Disney Adventures&quot;, Volume 6, #12.

== Release ==
On its release, the film was accompanied by a marketing campaign at more than $70 million, with commercial tie-ins with McDonald&#x27;s and General Mills.

=== Home media ===
At the time of its release, &quot;The King of Thieves&quot; was reportedly outselling &quot;The Return of Jafar&quot;, but Disney declined to disclose actual sales figures for the release. In 1996, the film sold million units in the United States, generating at least in sales revenue. It was the sixth-best-selling film video release in the United States during 1996.

On January 18, 2005, the film was re-released as a special edition DVD and VHS (the same day as &quot;The Return of Jafar&quot;), with the DVD version receiving a digitally-restored picture, remastered sound, two interactive games, and a behind-the-scenes bonus feature. However, the film is matted into a 1.85:1 widescreen ratio (an aspect ratio that, at the time, Disney had seldom used for television animation). The movie returned to the Disney Vault with the two other films in the series in January 2008. &quot;Aladdin and the King of Thieves&quot; and &quot;The Return of Jafar&quot; were released in North America on a Blu-ray/DVD/Digital HD combo pack on January 5, 2016, as a Disney Movie Club exclusive (with both films matted into a 1.78:1 widescreen ratio).

== Reception ==
Based on 12 reviews collected by Rotten Tomatoes, the film has received a 33% approval rating, with an average score of 4.84/10.

Caryn James of &quot;The New York Times&quot; praised the sequel as &quot;far better than &quot;The Return of Jafar&quot;&quot;, and acknowledged that &quot;the video has some other weak spots, but these hardly matter when &quot;Aladdin and the King of Thieves&quot; is so brimming with comic invention and adventure&quot;.

Scott Blakey of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; wrote that the story grows tedious after an hour, and recommended &quot;The Fool and the Flying Ship&quot; instead.

&quot;The Washington Post&quot; stated that the &quot;art of animation is strictly Saturday morning quality again (jobbed out to Disney&#x27;s overseas JV team), and the score is a long step backward from the original, meaning the movie lacks the lingering resonance and memorable visual moments of Disney&#x27;s big-budget affairs. Essentially, the movie is comparable to other reputable animated titles like &quot;The Swan Princess&quot; and &quot;Balto&quot; – pretty good, but not exactly Disney.&quot;

<text>The great grey owl (Strix nebulosa) (also great gray owl in American English) is a true owl, and is the world&#x27;s largest species of owl by length. It is distributed across the Northern Hemisphere, and it is the only species in the genus &quot;Strix&quot; found in both Eastern and Western Hemispheres. In some areas it is also called the Phantom of the North, cinereous owl (this name is also used for &quot;Strix sartorii&quot;), spectral owl, Lapland owl, spruce owl, bearded owl, and sooty owl.

==Description==

Adults have large rounded heads with grey faces and yellow eyes with darker circles around them. The underparts are light with dark streaks; the upper parts are grey with pale bars. This owl does not have ear tufts and has the largest facial disc of any raptor. There is a white collar or &quot;bow-tie&quot; just below the beak. The long tail tapers to a rounded end.

In terms of length, the great grey owl is believed to exceed the Eurasian eagle-owl and the Blakiston&#x27;s fish owl as the world&#x27;s largest owl. The great grey is outweighed by those two species as well as several others, including most of the genus &quot;Bubo&quot;. Much of its size is deceptive, since this species&#x27; fluffy feathers, large head and the longest tail of any extant owl obscure a body lighter than that of most other large owls. The length ranges from , averaging for females and for males. The wingspan can exceed , but averages for females and for males. The adult weight ranges from , averaging for females and for males. The males are usually smaller than females, as with most owl species.

The call of the adult is a series of very deep, rhythmic &#x27;who&#x27;s, which is usually given in correlation to their territories or in interactions with their offspring. At other times, adults are normally silent. The young may chatter, shriek, or hiss. Tame owls may produce higher-pitched hoots when given food by humans.

==Taxonomy==
There are two recognized subspecies of the great grey owl spread across North America and Eurasia.

* &quot;S. n. nebulosa&quot; : North America from central Alaska eastward across Canada to south-western Quebec, and south to northern California, northern Idaho, western Montana, Wyoming, and north-eastern Minnesota.
* &quot;S. n. lapponica&quot; : Northern Eurasia, from Fennoscandia through Siberia to Sakhalin and Kamchatka Krai to Lithuania, Lake Baikal, Kazakhstan, Mongolia, Manchuria and north-eastern China.

==Habitat==

In northern areas their breeding habitat is often the dense coniferous forests of the taiga, near open areas, such as meadows or bogs. In Oregon and California this owl has been found nesting in mixed oak woodlands. Once believed to require a cold climate, it is now known that this bird survives in a few areas where summer temperatures exceed .

==Range==
They breed in North America from as far east as Quebec to the Pacific coast and Alaska, and from Finland and Estonia across northern Asia. They are permanent residents, although northerly populations may move south and southeast when food is scarce. In Europe they are found breeding in Norway and Sweden and more numerously through Finland and Russia. Even though the species occurs in Europe, the first great grey owl recognized by science was found in Canada in the late 18th century.
There are sedentary populations in the Pacific states of California, Oregon, and Washington. The great grey owl in this region is found in disjunct areas of appropriate habitat. In winter these birds do not move far but may go downslope to escape deep snow as they must capture their prey on the ground.

In Oregon, the great grey owl breeding range is scattered from the Siskiyou Mountains in the southwest to the Blue Mountains in the northeast. Two bird festivals each May feature field trips to try to see the species: The Ladd Marsh Festival in La Grande, OR and the Mountain Bird Festival in Ashland, OR.

A 2015 study in California estimated there were fewer than 300 birds in the state at the time. The species is listed as Endangered under the California Endangered Species Act. The California range for the species includes a small extension of the Oregon population, north of Alturas. In addition breeding has been confirmed in the Tahoe National Forest east of Nevada City; in the Sierra Nevada foothills south of I-80 at around elevation; and for the population clustered around Yosemite. In Yosemite is where the first nest south of Canada was found in 1914. A study of the Yosemite owls shows that this population has been genetically isolated from populations in Oregon and farther north for more than 25,000 years. Biologists working on that study suggest that the Yosemite population should be considered a separate sub-species (&quot;Strix nebulosa yosemitensis&quot;). Nearby populations at lower elevations were not tested.

In Washington state, great grey owls are found in the southeast where mountains extend up from Oregon and in the Colville National Forest. Only a handful of great grey owl nests have ever been found in Washington state.

Farther east in the western United States, great grey owls breed in Idaho, Montana, and Wyoming, as far south as the Grand Teton and Yellowstone National Parks.

In northeastern North America, the owls are found year-round in southern Quebec and Ontario, but individuals will sometimes move further south in winter into New York and New England, apparently in pursuit of more abundant prey. Great grey owls are rarely sighted as far south as Pennsylvania and Long Island, New York. In winter 2017, the birds were recorded in northern New York in Robert Moses State Park and central Maine.

==Breeding==

Great grey owls do not build nests, so they typically use nests previously used by a large bird, such as a raptor. They will also nest in broken-topped trees and cavities in large trees. In southwestern and northeastern Oregon, the great grey owl has been using man-made platforms for nest sites since the 1980s. The erection of nest platforms for great grey owls was pioneered by Robert Nero in central Canada in the 1970s. Nesting may occur from March to May. Unlike, for example, osprey or white storks, the great grey owl does not predictably re-use nest sites over consecutive years. Four eggs are the usual clutch size. Eggs average wide and long. The incubation period is about 30 days, ranging from 28 to 36 days. Brooding lasts 2 to 3 weeks, after which the female starts roosting on a tree near nests. The young jump or fall from the nest at 3 to 4 weeks, and start to fly 1 to 2 weeks after this. Immediately after fledging, the white, fuzzy young must use beak and feet to climb back into trees. The female is on guard at this time and may be aggressive toward potential predators. Most offspring remain near their natal sites for many months after fledging. Normally the male hunts for his mate and the young throughout the nesting period. Once the young begin the fly, the female typically withdraws and the male continues to feed the young until they can hunt on their own in the autumn. The young owls go off on their own by winter.

The abundance of food in the area usually affects the number of eggs a female lays, a feature quite common in northern owl species. In years when small mammal populations are very low the great grey owl may not attempt nesting; thus their reproduction is connected to the sometimes extreme fluctuations of small mammal populations. Also, great grey owls may not nest in years of drought. If food is scarce, they may travel a fair distance to find more prey, with considerable movements by large numbers in some years of particularly scarce prey. Though they do not migrate, many are at least somewhat nomadic.

One alert landowner in northeast Oregon, Andy Huber, helped a female great grey owl raise her four nestlings after a great horned owl killed the male. Huber live-trapped small mammals and then released them at the nest site, and the female took these to the nestlings. As the owlets matured and began flying they came for the prey on their own. Huber and the mother owl raised all four owlets successfully.

==Feeding==

These birds wait, listen, and watch for prey, then swoop down; they also may fly low through open areas in search of prey. They frequently hunt from a low listening post which can be a stump, low tree limb, fence post, or road sign. Their large facial discs, also known as &quot;ruffs&quot;, focus sound, and the asymmetrical placement of their ears assists them in locating prey, because of the lack of light during the late and early hours in which they hunt. On the nesting grounds, they mainly hunt at night and near dawn and dusk; at other times, they are active mostly during the night.

They have excellent hearing, and may locate (and then capture) prey moving beneath of snow in a series of tunnels solely with that sense. They then can crash to a snow depth roughly equal to their own body size to grab their prey. Only this species and, more infrequently, other fairly large owls from the genus &quot;Strix&quot; are known to &quot;snow-plunge&quot; for prey, a habit that is thought to require superb hearing not possessed by all types of owls.

Unlike the more versatile eagle and horned owls, great grey owls rely almost fully upon small rodents. What species they eat depends on which small mammals are most abundant and available. In northern Canada and other parts of Scandinavia, they eat lemmings primarily. In dry parts of California&#x27;s Sierra Nevada they eat mostly pocket gophers. In some areas voles are the predominant prey. Locally, alternative prey animals (usually comprising less than 20% of prey intake) include squirrels, hares, moles, shrews, weasels, thrushes, grouse, Canada jays, mountain quail, small hawks, ducks, frogs and large beetles. This species is not known to scavenge or steal from other predators. In mated pairs, the male is the primary hunter who provides food for the entire family while the female guards and broods the eggs, nestlings, and flightless fledglings.

==Threats==
The harvest of timber from the great grey owl&#x27;s habitat is, perhaps, the greatest threat to this species. Intensified timber management typically reduces live and dead large-diameter trees used for nesting, leaning trees used by juveniles for roosting before they can fly, and dense canopy closures in stands used by juveniles for cover and protection. If perches are not left in clearcuts, great grey owls cannot readily hunt in them. Although human-made structures (made specifically for use by this species) have been utilized by these owls, the species is far more common in areas protected from logging. Livestock grazing in meadows also adversely affects great grey owls, by reducing habitat for preferred prey species.
Other dangers to great grey owls include rodenticides, collisions with vehicles, and the West Nile Virus. The West Nile virus is likely to become more prevalent with climate change. In Ontario and northeastern Oregon there are confirmed great grey owl deaths from the virus. Testing of owls in the Yosemite area since 2005 has found evidence of the virus in that population.

Due to their large size, great grey owls have few natural predators. Great horned owls, various small carnivores, and black bears have been documented preying on young, but such predators rarely threaten adults, and owls have been known to fend off animals as large as black bears when defending their nests. The only known predator of adult great grey owls is the Eurasian eagle-owl (&quot;Bubo bubo&quot;), which occasionally preys on the former in parts of Europe.

==Territorial behavior==
The great grey owl is not as aggressive as most other apex predators. They are less likely to attack each other or potential threats than are other large predatory birds. They do not protect a large nesting territory, nor do they defend hunting territories through aggression. As an exception, the female is aggressive in protecting eggs and owlets. She is especially alert and aggressive when fledglings first leave the nest but cannot yet fly, and thus are extremely vulnerable.

This lack of territorial aggressiveness makes the great grey owl difficult to find in the field. Most owls respond to their own species calls if played back in a nesting territory. Great grey owls will often ignore such calls. They also do not flush every time a human approaches or drives past. The great grey owl often remains still even if a human is nearby and therefore they are often overlooked or unnoticed.

==Provincial bird==
The great grey owl is the provincial bird of Manitoba, Canada.

==Captivity==
As of 2016, there are four great grey owls captive in Oregon and California. Two live at Blue Mountain Wildlife near Pendleton, Oregon, a third lives at Lindsay Museum in Walnut Creek, California, and the fourth lives at CuriOdyssey in San Mateo, California.

A captive wild injured great grey owl, Boris, resides at the Alaska Raptor Center in Sitka, Alaska. Boris was found north of Anchorage with a trauma to his right wrist, leaving him flightless.

Another captive wild injured great grey owl, Errol, lives at the Alaska Zoo in Anchorage, Alaska. Errol came to the zoo from Wild Bird Rescue after injuring himself while colliding with the tire of a parked car.

The Eurasian subspecies of the grey owl is very commonly kept in European zoos.

==In art==
A great grey owl with human hands is depicted on William Schaff&#x27;s album art for &quot;The Magnolia Electric Co.&quot;, a 2003 alt-country album by .

<text>Joan Beverly Kroc ( Mansfield, previously Smith; August 27, 1928 – October 12, 2003), also known as Joni, was an American philanthropist and third wife of McDonald&#x27;s CEO Ray Kroc.

== Early life ==
Joan Beverly Mansfield was born on August 27, 1928, in West St. Paul, Minnesota. Her father, Charles Smart Mansfield, was a store keeper and later a railroad telegraph operator and salesman.

== Marriage and family ==
In 1945, Mansfield married Rawland F. &quot;Rollie&quot; Smith, a Navy veteran who would become a McDonald&#x27;s franchisee, eventually owning three stores in Rapid City, South Dakota. The couple&#x27;s only child, a daughter named Linda, was born the following year.

Mansfield met McDonald&#x27;s Corp. founder Ray Kroc, who was 26 years her senior, while playing the organ at the Criterion Restaurant in St. Paul, Minnesota in 1957. Ray said in his autobiography that he &quot;was stunned by her blonde beauty&quot;. They were both married at the time. They met again at a McDonald&#x27;s conference in 1969 and, within six months, they divorced their spouses and married each other. Following Kroc&#x27;s death in 1984, she inherited his fortune.

== Philanthropy ==
In 2002, Kroc Center, a large Salvation Army community center that she helped fund—to the tune of $87 million—opened to the public. She later bequeathed an additional $1.6 billion to open Salvation Army Kroc Centers across the nation, the largest one-time gift ever recorded. Several institutions in the San Diego area are named after her, including the think tank Joan B. Kroc Institute for Peace and Justice and the Joan B. Kroc School of Peace Studies- the world&#x27;s top peace institution- at the University of San Diego, the St. Vincent de Paul Joan Kroc Center for the Homeless (Part of Father Joe&#x27;s Villages- San Diego&#x27;s largest organization helping the homeless) in downtown and the Kroc–Copley Animal Shelter in the Morena District. Additionally, Joan established and endowed University of Notre Dame&#x27;s Joan B. Kroc Institute for International Peace Studies. Kroc preferred to give donations anonymously, but recipient organizations often insisted on publicizing her gifts, hoping to attract new donors.

As the Padres owner, Kroc started Major League Baseball&#x27;s first employee-assistance program for players and staff with drug problems.

Kroc was also politically active. In 1985, she spent millions of dollars in support of nuclear disarmament, which included reprinting the book &quot;Missile Envy&quot; by Helen Caldicott, as well as publishing ads in major newspapers calling for disarmament. She anonymously gifted a Paul Conrad sculpture depicting a nuclear mushroom cloud, Chain Reaction, to the city of Santa Monica, where it still sits today. Because of her public no-nukes work, Cal Thomas, a conservative syndicated columnist, called her a &quot;McNut&quot;.

Kroc is affectionately known by the citizens of Grand Forks, North Dakota, and East Grand Forks, Minnesota, as the &quot;Angel&quot; because of her anonymous $15 million donation to assist the cities after a devastating flood occurred there in 1997. She was revealed as the source of the funds after reporters tracked down ownership of the jet that she used to fly into the area to survey the damage.

After her death in 2003, it was announced that Kroc had left the majority of her estate to the Salvation Army for the purpose of building recreation centers all across the nation. Another of her major donations was $225 million to National Public Radio (NPR) including $5 million to her local public radio station, San Diego&#x27;s KPBS.

== Death and legacy ==
Kroc died of brain cancer on October 12, 2003, in Rancho Santa Fe, California, at the age of 75. She was cremated and most of her remains were entombed at the El Camino Memorial Park in Sorrento Valley, San Diego.

Her will included significant bequests for a number of organizations:
* $1.5 billion (equivalent to $ billion in ) for the Salvation Army
* $200 million (equivalent to $ million in ) for National Public Radio
* $50 million (equivalent to $ million in ) for the University of San Diego&#x27;s Joan B. Kroc Institute for Peace and Justice
* $50 million (equivalent to $ million in ) for the University of Notre Dame&#x27;s Joan B. Kroc Institute for International Peace Studies
* $20 million (equivalent to $ million in ) for the San Diego Hospice &amp; Palliative Care, which was in addition to the $18.5 million she donated to build the institution during her life.

== In popular culture ==
The biography &quot;Ray &amp; Joan: The Man Who Made The McDonald&#x27;s Fortune and The Woman Who Gave it All Away&quot;, published by Dutton in 2016, and written by Lisa Napoli, examines the Krocs&#x27; relationship.

Kroc is portrayed by actress Linda Cardellini in the 2016 American biographical drama film &quot;The Founder&quot;.

<doc id="358694" wikidata="Q1550193" url="?curid=358694" title="State Opening of Parliament">
<text>The State Opening of Parliament is a ceremonial event which formally marks the beginning of each session of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. At its core is His or Her Majesty&#x27;s &quot;gracious speech from the throne&quot; (also known as the King&#x27;s or Queen&#x27;s Speech), which is read by the monarch but written by HM Government. In the speech the monarch gives notice of forthcoming state visits, before setting out the government&#x27;s legislative programme for the new parliamentary session. No business of either House of Parliament (the House of Lords or the House of Commons) can proceed until the Sovereign’s speech has been delivered.

The State Opening takes place in the House of Lords chamber within the Palace of Westminster on the first day of the new parliamentary session. This traditionally tends to fall in November, but can occur at any time of year (depending on the timing of General Elections and parliamentary session start dates). It takes place in front of a formal gathering of both Houses of Parliament; the monarch customarily wears the Imperial State Crown and a Robe of State, and members of the House of Lords wear their parliament robes (in contrast to the House of Commons, whose members wear day dress). 

State Openings of Parliament are documented from as early as the 14th century, with the first visual depictions dating from the 15th century. The most recent State Opening was held on 17 July 2024, after the 2024 United Kingdom general election. It was the second of Charles III&#x27;s reign, the first of the newly elected Labour government under Sir Keir Starmer, and the first State Opening with a Labour government since 2010.

==Significance==

The State Opening of Parliament is a ceremony filled with historical ritual, constitutional symbolism and practical significance relating to the governance of the United Kingdom. 

Parliament is composed of the Sovereign, the House of Lords and the House of Commons, and a State Opening is the only routine occasion when the three are gathered together in one place. The monarch is seated on the throne, at one end of the chamber in front of the Cloth of Estate (with the consort, if present, seated alongside), flanked by an entourage of Great Officers of State and members of the Royal Household. The Lords are seated on &quot;the floor of the House&quot; (i.e. in the main body of the chamber), while the Commons attend at &quot;the bar of the House&quot; (the boundary rail at the far end, facing the throne).

In addition to the Lords themselves, others are provided with seats on the floor of the House on the occasion of a State Opening, namely:
* such members of the Royal Family as His Majesty may direct
* Judges summoned by writ 
* the officers and attendants of the House
* such Peeresses and members of the Diplomatic Corps as are in possession of an invitation issued by the Lord Great Chamberlain.

==Sequence of events==

The ceremonial surrounding the opening of parliament can be broken down into several parts (the following descriptions refer to the full ceremonial of the event; for occasions when, for various reasons, reduced ceremonial has been used, see below):

===Searching of the cellars===
First, the cellars of the Palace of Westminster are searched by the Yeomen of the Guard. This is derived from the 1605 Gunpowder Plot, an attempted assassination of James VI and I in which Guy Fawkes was caught guarding gunpowder in the cellars hours before the king was to open the second session of the Blessed Parliament. Since that year, the cellars have been searched, now largely, but not only, for ceremonial purposes. This is supervised by the Lord Great Chamberlain, and the Yeomen are paid for their services with a small glass of port wine.

===Assembly of Peers and Commons===
Peers and peeresses assemble in the House of Lords. The Lords Spiritual and the Lords Temporal wear their Parliament robes for the occasion. They are joined by senior representatives of the judiciary, who sit on woolsacks in the centre of the Chamber, and members of the diplomatic corps, who are seated behind the Bishops. The Commons assemble in their own chamber, wearing ordinary day dress, and begin the day, as any other, with prayers. Beforehand the Speaker&#x27;s Procession takes place in the usual way: preceded by a doorkeeper, the Serjeant at Arms, leads the Speaker of the House of Commons from his official residence to the Commons Chamber, followed by his trainbearer, chaplain and secretary. In the Central Lobby, a police inspector makes the traditional cry of &quot;Hats off, strangers!&quot;, instructing those assembled to remove their hats in deference to the highest-ranking commoner in the realm.

===Delivery of parliamentary hostage===
On the morning of the State Opening, the Treasurer, Comptroller and Vice-Chamberlain of the Household (all of whom are government whips) assemble with other senior members of the Royal Household at Buckingham Palace, carrying their ceremonial white staves of office. The Treasurer and Comptroller, along with other senior members of the Royal Household, accompany the monarch in the carriage procession; but the Lord Chamberlain does not join them. Instead, on behalf of the monarch, he remains at Buckingham Palace keeping one MP (the Vice-Chamberlain) &quot;hostage&quot; for the duration of the state opening, by tradition as a surety for the safe return of the monarch. The hostage MP is well entertained until the successful conclusion of the ceremony, when they are released upon the safe return of the monarch. The Vice-Chamberlain&#x27;s imprisonment is now purely ceremonial, though they do remain under guard; originally, it guaranteed the safety of the Sovereign as they entered a possibly hostile Parliament. The tradition is said to stem from the time of Charles I, who had a contentious relationship with Parliament and was eventually beheaded in 1649 during the Civil War between the monarchy and Parliament (a copy of Charles I&#x27;s death warrant is displayed in the robing room used by the monarch as a ceremonial reminder of what can happen to a monarch who attempts to interfere with Parliament); however it has been suggested that the custom in its present form is of much more recent origin (mention of hostage-taking only dating back to the 1960s or 70s). In 1845, by contrast, the Lord Chamberlain&#x27;s routine absence from the State Opening was said to be due to &quot;the department over which his lordship presides not being acknowledged in His Majesty&#x27;s Palace at Westminster&quot; (where the Lord Great Chamberlain instead has the equivalent authority).

Hostage MPs in recent years (all of whom were serving as Vice-Chamberlain of the Household at the time) have included:
* 2014: Desmond Swayne
* 2015–16: Kris Hopkins
* 2017: Chris Heaton-Harris
* 2019: Stuart Andrew
* 2021: Marcus Jones
* 2022: James Morris
* 2023: Jo Churchill
* 2024: Samantha Dixon

===Arrival of royal regalia===

Before the arrival of the sovereign, the Imperial State Crown is brought to the Palace of Westminster, together with the Great Sword of State and the Cap of Maintenance, in their own carriage (usually Queen Alexandra&#x27;s State Coach). The King&#x27;s Bargemaster and Watermen accompany it, acting as footmen (a reminder of past times when the regalia were brought from the Tower of London by river). On arrival at the Sovereign&#x27;s Entrance, under the Victoria Tower, the Crown is passed by the Bargemaster to the Comptroller of the Lord Chamberlain&#x27;s Office, under the watchful eye of the Crown Jeweller. The regalia are then carried to be displayed in the Royal Gallery. Also in the procession, usually in King Edward VII&#x27;s Town Coach, are the two maces (separate from the three used by parliament) which are carried by the Serjeants-at-Arms of the Royal Household who escort the regalia in procession.

=== Arrival of the Sovereign and assembly of Parliament ===

The monarch travels &quot;in State&quot; from Buckingham Palace to the Palace of Westminster, arriving at the Sovereign&#x27;s Entrance under the Victoria Tower. Travelling in a state coach, the monarch is usually accompanied by his or her consort and sometimes by other members of the royal family. Senior members of the Royal Household follow in other carriages. The Household Cavalry Mounted Regiment provides a Sovereign&#x27;s Escort, and other members of the armed forces line the processional route from Buckingham Palace to the Palace of Westminster. 

At the monarch&#x27;s arrival, the national anthem is played, a gun salute is sounded in Green Park and the Royal Standard is hoisted in place of the Union Flag at the top of the Victoria Tower (where it remains until the monarch departs). The monarch is greeted on arrival by the Lord Great Chamberlain (who has oversight of the royal areas of the Palace of Westminster) and the Earl Marshal (who has responsibility for State ceremonial), before proceeding to the Robing Room, where he or she puts on the Parliament Robe of State and the Imperial State Crown. A procession is formed of heralds, Great Officers of State and members of the Royal Household, and when all is ready a fanfare is sounded and the monarch proceeds in State through the Royal Gallery to the House of Lords. Directly ahead of the monarch walk two peers: one (nowadays usually the Leader of the House of Lords) carrying the Cap of Maintenance, and the other (nowadays generally a retired senior military officer) carrying the Great Sword of State. Once seated on the throne, the monarch, wearing the Imperial State Crown, instructs the House by saying, &quot;My Lords, pray be seated&quot;; his or her consort, if present, sits on a throne to the sovereign’s left, and his or her children, if present, may be provided with seats elsewhere on the dais.

The Imperial State Crown has not been worn invariably: for example, on four occasions in the 20th century Parliament was opened by as yet uncrowned monarchs (i.e. after their accession to the throne, but before their coronation); on these occasions the robe of state was worn but the crown was not (instead it was carried on a cushion by one of the Great Officers of State).

===Royal summons of the Commons to the Lords&#x27; chamber===

Motioned by the monarch, the Lord Great Chamberlain raises his white staff of office to signal the official known as Black Rod to summon the House of Commons. Black Rod turns and, under the escort of the Door-keeper of the House of Lords, proceeds to the Members&#x27; Lobby of the House of Commons, and reaches the doors of the Commons.

On Black Rod&#x27;s approach, the Doorkeeper of the Commons orders that the doors are slammed shut against them, symbolising the rights of parliament and its independence from the monarch. The Usher of the Black Rod then strikes with the end of their ceremonial staff (the Black Rod) three times on the closed doors of the Commons Chamber, and is then admitted (there is a mark on the door of the Commons showing the repeated indentations made by Black Rods over the years).
This ritual is strongly associated with the occasion when King Charles I stormed into the House of Commons in 1642 in an unsuccessful attempt to arrest five members of Parliament, including the celebrated English patriot and leading parliamentarian John Hampden. (Since that time, no British monarch has entered the House of Commons when it is sitting.) The door-closing ritual, however, predates the 1640s, and although it has long since come to symbolise the independence of the Commons, its primary purpose (according to &quot;Erskine May&quot;) is for the Commons to establish Black Rod&#x27;s identity. Once this has been achieved, Black Rod cannot be refused admission, and all other business of whatever kind in the Commons chamber must cease.

The doors having been opened, the chief doorkeeper of the House of Commons introduces Black Rod. At the bar, Black Rod bows to the Speaker before proceeding to the table, bowing again, and announcing the command of the monarch for the attendance of the Commons, in the following words:

During the later decades of Elizabeth II&#x27;s reign, a tradition developed for this command to be greeted with a defiant topical comment by republican-leaning Labour MP Dennis Skinner, upon which, with some mirth, the House rose to make its way to the Lords&#x27; Chamber. This customary intervention was omitted by Mr Skinner in 2015, claiming that he had &quot;bigger fish to fry than uttering something&quot;, due to a dispute over seating with the Scottish Nationalists. Skinner resumed the practice in 2016, until he was unseated in 2019.

===Procession of the Commons===

The Speaker proceeds to attend the summons at once. The Serjeant-at-Arms picks up the ceremonial mace and, with the Speaker and Black Rod, leads the Members of the House of Commons as they walk, in pairs, towards the House of Lords. By custom, the members saunter, with much discussion and joking, rather than formally process. The Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition followed by The Deputy Prime Minister, First Secretary of State or another member of the government and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition usually walk side by side, leading the two lines of MPs. The Commons then arrive at the Bar of the House of Lords. The only people required to bow are the House of Commons Speaker, Commons Clerk, senior Lords official Black Rod and the Serjeant-at-Arms. No person who is not a member of the Upper House may pass the Bar unbidden when it is in session; a similar rule applies to the Commons. They remain standing at the Bar during the speech.

=== Delivery of the speech from the throne===
The monarch reads a prepared speech, known as the &quot;Speech from the Throne&quot; or the &quot;King&#x27;s/Queen&#x27;s Speech&quot;, outlining the Government&#x27;s agenda for the coming year. The speech is written by the Prime Minister and their cabinet members, and reflects the legislative agenda for which the Government seeks the agreement of both Houses of Parliament. It is traditionally written on goatskin vellum, and presented on bended knee for the monarch to read by the Lord Chancellor, who produces the scroll from a satchel-like bag. Traditionally, rather than turning their back on the Sovereign, which might appear disrespectful, the Lord Chancellor walks backwards down the steps of the throne, continuing to face the monarch. Lord Irvine of Lairg, the Lord Chancellor at the time, sought to break the custom and applied successfully for permission to turn his back on the sovereign and walk down the steps forwards. The next Lord Chancellor, Jack Straw, continued the former tradition but succeeding Lords Chancellor have mostly chosen to walk forwards.

The whole speech is addressed to &quot;My Lords and Members of the House of Commons&quot;, with one significant exception that the monarch says specifically, &quot;Members of the House of Commons, estimates for the public services will be laid before you&quot;, since the budget is constitutionally reserved to the Commons.

The monarch reads the entire speech in a neutral and formal tone, implying neither approval nor disapproval of the proposals of their Government: the monarch makes constant reference to &quot;My Government&quot; when reading the text. After listing the main bills to be introduced during the session, the monarch states: &quot;Other measures will be laid before you&quot;, thus leaving the government scope to introduce bills not mentioned in the speech. The monarch mentions any state visits they intend to make and also any planned state visits of foreign heads of state to the United Kingdom during the parliamentary session. The monarch concludes the speech in saying: &quot;My Lords and Members of the House of Commons, I pray that the blessing of Almighty God may rest upon your counsels.&quot;

Traditionally, the members of both houses of Parliament listen to the speech respectfully, showing neither approval or dissent towards its contents before it is debated in each house. This silence, however, was broken in 1998, when Queen Elizabeth II announced the government&#x27;s plan of abolishing the right of hereditary peers to automatically sit in the House of Lords. A few Labour members of the House of Commons cried &quot;yes&quot; and &quot;hear&quot;, prompting several of the Lords to shout &quot;no&quot; and &quot;shame&quot;. The Queen continued delivering her speech without any pause, ignoring the intervention. The conduct of those who interrupted the speech was strongly criticised at the time.

===Departure of monarch===
Following the speech, the monarch and his or her retinue leave the chamber. The monarch bows to both sides of the House of Peers and then leaves the chamber, walking in procession back to the Robing Room, before the Commons bow again and return to their Chamber.

===Debate on the speech===
After the departure of the monarch from the palace, each Chamber proceeds to the consideration of an &quot;Address in Reply to His/ Her Majesty&#x27;s Gracious Speech.&quot; But first, each House considers a bill &quot;pro forma&quot; to symbolise their right to deliberate independently of the monarch. In the House of Lords, the bill is called the Select Vestries Bill, while the Commons equivalent is the Outlawries Bill. The bills are considered for the sake of ceremony only, and do not make any actual legislative progress. For the address in reply, a chosen member moves &quot;That a humble Address be presented to His Majesty, as follows&quot;. The following is the form used in the House of Lords and is nearly identical to that used in the House of Commons:
The first speech of the debate in the Commons is, by tradition, a humorous one given by a member selected in advance. The consideration of the address in reply to the Throne Speech is the occasion for a debate on the Government&#x27;s agenda. The debate on the Address in Reply is spread over several days. On each day, a different topic, such as foreign affairs or finance, is considered. The debate provides an indication of the views of Parliament regarding the government&#x27;s agenda.

Following this debate, a vote is taken on the Government Programme. This vote is treated as a vote of no confidence and losing this vote will automatically trigger a general election. When the Fixed-term Parliaments Act was in force, a general election was not automatically triggered if the vote was lost.

==Variations==
===Openings in the absence of the monarch===

Since 1901, the monarch has opened Parliament in person on all but six occasions. In 1929 and 1935 King George V was too ill to attend; in 1951 King George VI was too ill to attend; in 1959 and 1963 Queen Elizabeth II was pregnant and did not attend. In each of these years Lords Commissioners were appointed to preside over the opening, with the speech being read by the Presiding Commissioner (namely the Lord Chancellor). The speech was prefaced with the words:

&quot;My Lords and Members of the House of Commons, We are commanded to deliver to you His/Her Majesty’s Speech in His/Her Majesty&#x27;s own words&quot;. 
In 2022, when the Queen was absent on the day at short notice due to &quot;episodic mobility problems&quot;, the heir-apparent to the throne and his eldest son (the then Prince of Wales, now Charles III, and the Duke of Cambridge, now Prince of Wales) were appointed under the authority of section 6 of the Regency Act 1937 to open Parliament as Counsellors of State, with the then-Prince of Wales reading the speech from the consort&#x27;s throne on this occasion.

===Reduced ceremonial===

On certain other occasions through history, ceremonial aspects of the State Opening have been scaled back for specific reasons (including plague in 1593, threats of assassination in 1679 and wartime restrictions in place from 1917-1919 and 1939-1948).

On three occasions in the reign of Queen Elizabeth II (namely March 1974, June 2017 and December 2019) the State Opening was conducted in a &quot;dressed-down&quot; manner, due to the snap general elections held in those years. On these occasions the Queen attended in day dress, rather than the traditional ceremonial robes of state, and the Imperial State Crown was carried in front of the Queen rather than worn. Inside the Palace, there were reduced numbers in the procession, and outside motor cars were used in place of horse-drawn carriages (and no military escort accompanied them). Otherwise, the ceremony remained largely the same.

In 2021, the ceremony was scaled down due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The Queen wore day dress and arrived by car at Westminster, where seating was restricted: 74 were allowed in the Lords Chamber, whilst 34 further MPs and peers were able to participate from the gallery. To prevent the spread of the virus, mask-wearing and testing was enforced, and the Lord Chancellor did not directly pass the speech to the Queen, but placed it on a table next to the throne. The State Opening in May 2022 was also scheduled to take place with reduced ceremonial, due to the Queen suffering &quot;episodic mobility problems&quot; (which eventually led to her being absent on the day).

===Double and cancelled Openings===
Throughout the twentieth century (including in wartime) the State Opening took place on an annual basis, with the following exceptions:
* There were two State Openings in 1914 (and no State Opening in 1915);
* There were two State Openings in 1921 (and no State Opening in 1923);
:The first State Opening took place on 15 February 1921. Nine months later, on 10 November, Parliament was prorogued to 30 January; in the meantime, negotiations were taking place with regard to an Anglo-Irish Treaty. The treaty was signed on 6 December, and the following day a proclamation was issued summoning Parliament to meet in a week&#x27;s time: a State Opening duly took place on 14 December, the King declaring &#x27;I have summoned you to meet at this unusual time in order that the Articles of Agreement which have been signed by My Ministers and the Irish Delegation may be at once submitted for your approval. No other business will be brought before you in the present Session&#x27;. Parliament was then once again prorogued (to 31st January) on 19 December 1921.
* There were two State Openings in 1924 (and no State Opening in 1925);
* There were two State Openings in 1948 (and no State Opening in 1949). 
:On 24 June, it was announced that in order to secure the passing of the Parliament Bill, there would be a short session from 14 to 24 September, followed by an adjournment, then a new session from 26 October. On 14 September, the King opened Parliament with a very brief speech (just 74 words), announcing that the only business of the session would be the bill to amend the Parliament Act. On 24 September, it adjourned as planned, and the new session was again opened by the King on 26 October. The two weeks in September formed Parliament&#x27;s shortest modern session.
* There were two State Openings in 1974.

In the twenty-first century the State Opening continued on an annual basis, with the following exceptions: 
* There was no State Opening in 2011, as it was cancelled to ease the pressure for the planned introduction of legislation for fixed-term Parliaments;
* There was no State Opening in 2018, as it was cancelled to lengthen the timeframe for the passing of Brexit-related legislation.
* There were two State Openings in 2019 (and no State Opening in 2020).

==History==
===Origins===

The Opening of Parliament began out of practical necessity. By the late 14th century, the manner in which the King gathered his nobles and representatives of the Commons had begun to follow an established pattern. First of all, Peers&#x27; names were checked against the list of those who had been summoned, and representatives of the Commons were checked against the sheriffs&#x27; election returns. The Peers were robed and sat in the Painted Chamber at the Palace of Westminster; the Commons were summoned, and stood at the Bar (threshold) of the Chamber. A speech or sermon was then given (usually by the Lord Chancellor) explaining why Parliament had been summoned, after which the Lords and Commons went separately to discuss the business in hand. The monarch normally presided, not only for the Opening but also for the deliberations which followed (unless prevented by illness or other pressing matters); the Painted Chamber was one of the monarch&#x27;s private apartments.

===The Tudors===
In the Tudor period, the modern structure of Parliament began to emerge, and the monarch no longer attended during normal proceedings. For this reason, the State Opening took on greater symbolic significance as an occasion for the full constitution of the State (Monarch, Lords and Commons) to be seen. In this period, the parliamentary gathering began to be preceded by an open-air State Procession (which often attracted large numbers of onlookers): the Monarch, together with Household retinue, would proceed in State from whichever royal residence was being used, first to Westminster Abbey for a service (usually a Mass of the Holy Ghost, prior to the Reformation), and thence on foot (accompanied by the Lords Spiritual and Temporal in their robes) to the Palace of Westminster for the Opening itself.
The Wriothesley Garter Book, a 1523 illustration by Thomas Wriothesley, depicts King Henry VIII seated in Parliament in that year. It shows a remarkable visual similarity between State Openings of the 16th and 21st centuries. In both cases, the monarch sits on a throne before the Cloth of Estate, crowned and wearing a crimson robe of state; at his right hand sit Cardinal Thomas Wolsey, Archbishop of York and Lord Chancellor, with arms above under a cardinal&#x27;s hat, and William Warham, Archbishop of Canterbury, with arms above. Behind stands Cuthbert Tunstall, Bishop of London and Lord Keeper of the Privy Seal. The Cap of Maintenance and Sword of State are borne by peers standing before the monarch on the left and right respectively; the Lord Great Chamberlain stands alongside, bearing his white wand of office, near the Garter King of Arms in his tabard displaying the royal arms (Thomas Wriothesley himself, the illustrator). Members of the Royal retinue are arrayed behind the King (top right). In the main body of the Chamber, the Bishops are seated on benches to the King&#x27;s right wearing their parliamentary robes, with the Mitred Abbots behind them. The Lords Temporal are seated to the King&#x27;s left and on the cross-bench, the status of peers is indicated by the number of miniver bars (white fur edged with gold oak-leaf lace) on their peerage robes: 4 for a duke, 3½ for a marquess, 3 for an earl, 2½ for a viscount, and 2 for a baron. Thus there are 2 dukes, both wearing ducal coronets, the first holding a Marshal&#x27;s Baton, thus he is the Duke of Norfolk, Earl Marshal of England. William Weston, Prior of the Hospital of St John of Jerusalem, premier baron in the roll of peers, dressed in black, sits at the end of the cross-bench. The judges (red-robed and coifed) are on the woolsacks in the centre (two Chief Justices, eight judges, and four Serjeants-at-Law), and behind them kneel the clerks (with quills and inkpots). At the bottom of the picture members of the House of Commons can be seen behind the Bar of the House, with Thomas More, Speaker of the House of Commons, in the centre, wearing his black and gold robe of state.

The Palace of Westminster ceased to be a royal residence following a fire in 1512. Afterwards another of the King&#x27;s residences was on occasion used (in 1523, for instance, the State Opening took place at Bridewell Palace, and the Mass beforehand at Blackfriars Priory). When (in 1530) the King moved into the Palace at Whitehall, however, the ceremony returned to Westminster. In 1536, the State Opening was held for the first time in the White Chamber of the Palace of Westminster, which is where the House of Lords sat; and so began the custom of the State Opening taking place in the Upper House of Parliament.

===Subsequent developments===

Since that time the ceremonial has evolved, but not dramatically. In 1679 neither the procession nor the Abbey service took place due to the Popish Plot conspiracy theory; although the procession was subsequently restored, the service in the Abbey was not. The monarch&#x27;s role in the proceedings changed over time: early on, the monarch would say some introductory words, before calling upon the Lord Chancellor (or Lord Keeper) to address the assembly. James I, however, was accustomed to speak at greater length himself, and sometimes dispensed with the Chancellor&#x27;s services as spokesman. This varying pattern continued in subsequent reigns (and during the Commonwealth, when Cromwell gave the speech), but from 1679 onwards it became the norm for the monarch alone to speak. Since then, the monarch (if present) has almost invariably given the speech, with the exception of George I (whose command of English was poor) and Victoria (after the death of Prince Albert). During the Regency of 1811-1820, the Prince of Wales attended in full state and gave a Prince Regent&#x27;s Speech. 
A dramatic change was occasioned by the destruction of the old Palace of Westminster by fire in 1834. After that, the Painted Chamber (which had been gutted in the blaze) was roofed over and fitted up to serve as a temporary house of Lords, pending the rebuilding of the palace; the State Opening took place there until 1847, when the new Lords&#x27; chamber was opened. 

The new palace was designed with the ceremony of the State Opening very much in mind; the choreography of the modern ceremony may be said to date from 1852, when the &quot;Victoria Tower entrance&quot; was used for the first time, and likewise &quot;the Royal Staircase, Norman Porch, new Robing Room and Royal Gallery&quot;, establishing the modern processional route. 

Between 1837 and 1861, Queen Victoria missed the State Opening on only four occasions (each time due to pregnancy); but following the death of the Prince Consort she avoided ceremonial events. She attended the State Opening in 1866 wearing a black dress and veil rather than the robe of state (which was instead draped over the throne); on this occasion she delegated the reading of the speech to the Lord Chancellor. Victoria attended the State Opening on six further occasions (in the 1870s-80s), wearing a small diamond crown in place of the Imperial State Crown; but otherwise delegated the opening of Parliament to Lords Commissioners (one of whom was usually the Prince of Wales). It was not until the latter&#x27;s accession as Edward VII in 1901 that the full state ceremonial of the event was restored (with the king being in regular attendance and reading the speech himself). King George V resumed wearing the Imperial State Crown in 1913.
During the two world wars the ceremonial was reduced, and by necessity modified: for example, in 1940 the entire State Opening took place in Church House, Westminster for reasons of security; and then from 1941-1944 it took place in the Robing Room, which was serving as a temporary chamber for the Lords while theirs was in use by the Commons (whose chamber had been destroyed in the Blitz). Full ceremonial was restored for the most part in 1948, with the crown and robes returning two years later (once the Lords had vacated the Robing Room).

Queen Elizabeth II opened every session of Parliament during her reign, except in 1959, 1963, and 2022. In 1959 and 1963, she was pregnant with Prince Andrew and Prince Edward respectively and those two sessions were opened by Lords Commissioners, headed by the Archbishop of Canterbury (Geoffrey Fisher in 1959 and Michael Ramsey in 1963), empowered by the Queen. The Queen also missed the 2022 State Opening on the advice of her doctors. That session was opened by her son Charles, Prince of Wales and her grandson Prince William, Duke of Cambridge who, in their capacity as Counsellors of State, were empowered to do so by Letters Patent issued by the Queen for the occasion, the Prince of Wales reading the Queen&#x27;s Speech (from the consort&#x27;s throne) on behalf of his mother.

In 1958, the entire State Opening of Parliament was filmed and televised for the first time. In 1998, minor adjustments were made to the ceremonial inside Parliament with a view to shortening the proceedings.

In the 1998 Queen&#x27;s Speech, Elizabeth II faced an unprecedented outburst when she outlined the government&#x27;s plan to ban most hereditary peers from sitting in the House of Lords. The Queen&#x27;s Speech was interrupted by shouts of &quot;hear hear&quot; from Labour MPs, and some peers appeared to respond to the interruption with &quot;shame&quot;. This was regarded as a considerable act of discourtesy, and the first time in living memory that the sovereign&#x27;s address, which is normally listened to in total silence, had been interrupted.

==Equivalents in other countries==
 
In addition to the UK, Opening of Parliament ceremonies are held in other Commonwealth realms. The governor-general or, in the case of Australia&#x27;s states and Canada&#x27;s provinces, the relevant governor or lieutenant governor, respectively, usually delivers the speech from the throne. On occasion, the monarch may open these parliaments and deliver the speech him or herself. In both Australia and Canada, the last time this occurred was in 1977. In New Zealand, the monarch last opened parliament personally in February 1990.

In Spain the Solemn Opening of the Parliament of Spain is conducted by the monarch. 

In Malaysia, the Parliament of Malaysia also conducts an annual State Opening, usually in March, presided over by the &quot;Yang di-Pertuan Agong&quot;. However, parliament is opened in the lower house (the &quot;Dewan Rakyat&quot;) rather than the upper house (the &quot;Dewan Negara&quot;), thus the sitting is conducted by its Speaker. Additionally, as there is no equivalent to the Lord Chancellor, the speech is presented to the Monarch by the Prime Minister.
In India, the President of India opens Parliament with an address similar to the Speech from the Throne. This is also the case in Commonwealth Republics with a non-executive Presidency such as Malta, Mauritius and Singapore.
In the Netherlands a similar ceremony is held on the third Tuesday in September, which is called &quot;Prinsjesdag&quot; in the Netherlands. Article 65 of the constitution states that &quot;A statement of the policy to be pursued by the Government is given by or on behalf of the King before a joint session of the two Houses of the States General that is held every year on the third Tuesday in September or on such earlier date as may be prescribed by Act of Parliament.&quot; In Norway, the King is required by Article 74 of the constitution to preside over the opening of the Storting after it had been declared to be legally constituted by the president of the Storting. After he delivers the Speech from the Throne, outlining the government&#x27;s policies for the coming year, a member of the government reads the Report on the State of the Realm, an account of the government&#x27;s achievements of the past year.

In Sweden a similar ceremony as the British was held until 1974, when the constitution was changed. The old opening of state was in Sweden called &quot;Riksdagens högtidliga öppnande&quot; (&quot;The solemn opening of the Riksdag&quot;) and was, as the British, full of symbolism. After the abolition of the old state opening, the opening is now held in the Riksdag but in the presence of the monarch and his family. It is still the King who officially opens the parliament. After the opening of parliament the King gives a speech followed by the Prime Minister&#x27;s declaration of government.

In Israel, a semi-annual ceremony, attended by the President, opens the winter and summer sessions of the Knesset. Though in the past he was a guest sitting in the Knesset&#x27;s upper deck, the President now attends the ceremony from the speaker&#x27;s podium and gives his own written address regarding the upcoming session. In the first session of each legislative period of the Knesset, the President has the duty of opening the first session himself and inaugurating the temporary Knesset speaker, and then conducting the inauguration process of all of the Knesset members.

In some countries with presidential or similar systems in which the roles of head of state and head of government are merged, the chief executive&#x27;s annual speech to the legislative branch is imbued with some of the ceremonial weight of a parliamentary state opening. The most well-known example is the State of the Union Address in the United States. Other examples include the State of the Nation Address in the Philippines, a former American dependency. These speeches differ from a State Opening in at least two respects, however: they do not in fact open the legislative session, and they are delivered by the chief executive on his or her own behalf. In Poland, the President of Poland delivers his speech to the &quot;Sejm&quot; and the Senate at the First Sitting of these Houses, which is similar to Speech from the Throne. It is rather a custom than a law. Most Presidents of Poland delivered the Speech to the Parliament. The exception was in 2007, when President Lech Kaczyński, instead of addressing the &quot;Sejm&quot;, watched the First Sitting of the 6th term &quot;Sejm&quot; from the Presidential box in the Press gallery. The President of Mexico used to be constitutionally obliged to deliver a speech, similar to the American State of the Union, until 2006 when President Vicente Fox was impeded by the opposition parties from entering the Congress building for his sixth and final speech. Since that incident, the Constitution no longer requires the President&#x27;s presence at the opening of Congress.

<text>Operation Jubilee or the Dieppe Raid (19 August 1942) was a disastrous Allied amphibious attack on the German-occupied port of Dieppe in northern France, during the Second World War. Over 6,050 infantry, predominantly Canadian, supported by a regiment of tanks, were put ashore from a naval force operating under the protection of Royal Air Force (RAF) fighters.

The port was to be captured and held for a short period, to test the feasibility of a landing and to gather intelligence. German coastal defences, port structures and important buildings were to be demolished. The raid was intended to boost Allied morale, demonstrate the commitment of the United Kingdom to re-open the Western Front and support the Soviet Union, fighting on the Eastern Front.

The made a maximum effort against the landing as the RAF had expected, and the RAF lost 106 aircraft (at least 32 to anti-aircraft fire or accidents) against 48 German losses. The Royal Navy lost 33 landing craft and a destroyer. Aerial and naval support was insufficient to enable the ground forces to achieve their objectives. The tanks were trapped on the beach and the infantry was largely prevented from entering the town by obstacles and German fire.

After less than six hours, mounting casualties forced a retreat. Within ten hours, 3,623 of the 6,086 men who landed had been killed, wounded, or taken prisoner. 5,000 were Canadians, who suffered a 68% casualty rate, with 3,367 killed, wounded or taken prisoner. The operation was a fiasco in which only one landing force temporarily achieved its objective, and a small amount of military intelligence was gathered.

Both sides learnt important lessons regarding coastal assaults. The Allies learnt lessons that influenced the success of the D-Day landings. Artificial harbours were declared crucial, tanks were adapted specifically for beaches, a new integrated tactical air force strengthened ground support, and capturing a major port at the outset was no longer seen as a priority. Churchill and Mountbatten both claimed that these lessons had outweighed the cost. The Germans also believed that Dieppe was a learning experience and made a considerable effort to improve the way they defended the occupied coastlines of Europe.

==Background==

===Dunkirk to Dieppe===
In the aftermath of the Dunkirk evacuation of the British Expeditionary Force in May 1940, the British started on the development of a substantial raiding force under the umbrella of Combined Operations Headquarters. This was accompanied by the development of techniques and equipment for amphibious warfare. In late 1941, a scheme was put forward for the landing of 12 divisions around Le Havre, assuming a withdrawal of German troops to counter Soviet success in the east. From this came Operation Rutter to test the feasibility of capturing a port by an opposed landing, the investigation of the problems of operating the invasion fleet and testing equipment and techniques of the assault.

After its victory in the Battle of Britain in 1940 and the having switched to night bombing in the autumn of 1940, the day fighters of Royal Air Force Fighter Command were &quot;a force without an immediate mission&quot;. Without anything else to do, the day fighters of RAF Fighter Command were in the spring of 1941 deployed on a series of search-and-destroy missions of flying over France to engage the in combat. In the second half of 1941, the aerial offensive over France was greatly stepped up, leading to the loss of 411 British and Canadian aircraft. In the spring of 1942, the deployed the new Focke-Wulf Fw 190 fighter to its airfields in France.

The Fw 190 was superior to the Supermarine Spitfire Mk V and Hawker Hurricane Mk IIs used by the British and Canadian pilots and losses over France increased. The RAF was convinced it was winning the air war, believing that the loss of 259 Spitfires over France in the first six months of 1942 were justified by the reported destruction of 197 German aircraft in the same period. A major problem for the RAF was that the German fighter pilots declined to engage in combat over the French coast and instead operated inland, forcing the British Spitfires to fly deeper into France, using up their fuel, placing them at a disadvantage when the engaged, and, critically, if RAF pilots had to bail out they would be in enemy occupied territory, i.e. RAF Fighter command was now operating with all the disadvantages the had to contend with in the Battle of Britain. Thanks to intelligence provided by Ultra, the British knew that if any Allied force attempted to seize a port in France, the Germans would assume it to be the beginning of an invasion and thus the was to mount a maximum effort. Fighter Command lobbied in early 1942, for a raid to seize a French port to provoke the into action with the RAF at an advantage.

===Dieppe===
Dieppe, a coastal town in the Seine-Inférieure department of France, is built along a long cliff that overlooks the English Channel. The river Scie is on the western end of the town and the Arques flows through the town and into a medium-sized harbour. In 1942, the Germans had demolished some seafront buildings to aid in coastal defence and had set up two large artillery batteries at Berneval-le-Grand and Varengeville-sur-Mer. One important consideration for the planners was that Dieppe was within range of the RAF&#x27;s fighter aircraft.

There was also intense pressure from the Soviet government to open a second front in Western Europe. By early 1942, the Wehrmacht&#x27;s Operation Barbarossa had clearly failed to destroy the Soviet Union. However, the Germans in a much less ambitious summer offensive launched in June, were deep into southern Soviet territory, pushing toward Stalingrad. Joseph Stalin himself repeatedly demanded that the Allies create a second front in France to force the Germans to move at least 40 divisions away from the Eastern Front to remove some of the pressure put on the Red Army in the Soviet Union.

The proposed Allied invasion of continental Europe in 1943, Operation Roundup, was considered impractical by military planners, and the alternative of landing in 1942, Operation Sledgehammer, even more difficult. The British had been engaged with the Italians and the Germans in the Western Desert campaign since June 1940. At the Second Washington Conference in June 1942, U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt and British Prime Minister Winston Churchill decided to postpone the cross-English Channel invasion and schedule Operation Torch, the Anglo-American invasion of French North Africa, for later that year. In the interim, a large-scale Canadian-led raid on the French coast was intended to take some of the pressure off the Soviet Union.

The objective of the raid was discussed by Winston Churchill in his war memoirs:

=== Role of Louis Mountbatten ===
On the directive of Winston Churchill, Louis Mountbatten was recalled from captaincy of the aircraft carrier while it was under repair in the US in 1941 and instated as adviser on combined operations of the British Army (replacing Admiral Roger Keyes who as director of combined operations had fallen out with the chiefs of staff and Churchill), later to be promoted to the post of chief of combined operations on 4 March 1942. Churchill personally briefed Mountbatten that he wanted raids of increasing intensity, developing equipment and training with a view to the invasion of France; the chiefs of staff directive limited Mountbatten&#x27;s authority to approving only small raids, through using special service troops. He held a dual role as adviser to the chiefs of staff and commodore combined operations, handling the administration of both small raids and larger operations. In 1942 Mountbatten was raised by Churchill as a full member of meetings of the chiefs of staff with acting rank of vice-admiral, air marshal and lieutenant general. In May 1942 it was agreed that Combined Operations HQ would handle detailed planning of the Dieppe raid.

COHQ proposed flanking landings that would take Dieppe in a pincer movement, but Home Forces argued for a frontal attack as, within the 15-hour window of the raid, the flank attacks would not have enough time to achieve success. At meetings Mountbatten argued that it was sufficient for the raid to show that the tactics would have worked, Montgomery countered that if the raid did not take Dieppe it would be seen as a failure. An initial heavy bombardment from the air was approved (despite concerns about civilian casualties) then rescinded due to army opinion that wreckage would block streets for the tanks and RAF belief that most of the bombs would end up in the sea or inland. Mountbatten pressed for the firepower of a battleship for bombardment in lieu of bombing but neither this nor cruisers was permitted. Equally, Combined Operations&#x27; proposed assault force of marines and commandos was passed over in favour of untried Canadian troops.

Mountbatten was well known for his chivalry and charming abilities; however, he lacked experience in terms of actual warfare. Even before taking up this role, Mountbatten had faced a rough patch at sea captaining the British Navy&#x27;s as commander of the 5th Destroyer Flotilla, where his performance was so below par that Denis Healey who was secretary of state for defence when Mountbatten was chief of the defence staff in the 1960s remarked, &quot;but his birth saved him from the court martial any other officer would have faced&quot;.

Despite his shortcomings, Mountbatten played an important role in the planning of the whole operation. The Dieppe raid was intended as an experiment and was initially planned to take place at the end of June 1942. Preparations were in full swing with two rehearsals taking place in Bridport on 13 and 23 June; the second due to the debacle that the first rehearsal had turned into. However, bad weather delayed the operation by three weeks and two vessels that were to be used had been put out of action by bombs. This made the chiefs of staff uneasy thinking that the Germans would have found out about the attack by then as the plan was no longer a secret to the more than 10,000 Allied troops who had been informed of it. On 8 July, General Bernard Montgomery recommended calling off the attack altogether, and the idea would probably have been shelved had it not been for Mountbatten&#x27;s proposal to relaunch the operation six weeks later, still aiming at Dieppe. His argument was that although the enemy must have found out that Dieppe had been the original target, &quot;the very last thing they&#x27;d (Germans) ever imagine is that we would be so stupid as to lay on the same operation again&quot;.

Mountbatten&#x27;s hubristic approach convinced the generals to go ahead with the plan, which ultimately turned out to be catastrophic. Although Churchill, Eisenhower and Mountbatten collectively staved off any blame for the outcome, Mountbatten bore the brunt of it. Mountbatten was reluctant to accept the blame and shifted it to peripheral reasons by passing apologetic and sometimes insensitive remarks.

===Operation Rutter===
Operation Rutter was devised to satisfy several objectives, as a show of support for the Soviet Union, to provide an opportunity for the Canadian forces in Britain to engage the German Army and as a morale booster for the British public, among whom were vociferous supporters of a second front to give tangible support to the Red Army.

At the time, the military thought that when the real invasion of Europe began, it would be important to quickly capture a port before the Germans could demolish the facilities or re-capture it by a counter-attack. The extent of the German fortification of French ports was uncertain and how organised an amphibious attack could be after a Channel crossing and how a surprise element could be achieved was also in doubt. Rutter was devised to provide the experience that would be needed later in the war.

Rutter was a combined operation, involving heavy bombers of RAF Bomber Command and the heavy ships of the Royal Navy to bombard German defences overlooking the beaches; parachute and glider troops would silence German heavy artillery commanding the approaches to the port. The main force of infantry and tanks would land and advance through the port to the outskirts and dig in to resist counter-attacks until it was time to withdraw and re-embark in their landing craft.

The 2nd Canadian Infantry Division was chosen for the operation and given three months&#x27; specialist training in amphibious operations up to July. The Canadians assembled at embarkation ports and went aboard their ships, where the target was revealed. German aircraft spotting and bombing the assembled ships and inclement weather forced a delay in sailing and on 7 July, Rutter was cancelled and the troops disembarked.

==Prelude==

===Operation Jubilee===

The Dieppe landings were planned on six beaches: four in front of the town itself, and two to the eastern and western flanks respectively. From east to west, the beaches were codenamed Yellow, Blue, Red, White, Green and Orange. No. 3 Commando would land on Yellow beach, the Royal Regiment of Canada on Blue. The main landings would take place on Red and White beaches by the Royal Hamilton Light Infantry, the Essex Scottish Regiment, Les Fusiliers Mont-Royal, A Commando Royal Marines and the armour. The South Saskatchewan Regiment and the Queen&#x27;s Own Cameron Highlanders of Canada would land on Green Beach, and No. 4 Commando on Orange.

Armoured support was provided by the 14th Army Tank Regiment (The Calgary Regiment (Tank)) with 58 of the newly introduced Churchill tanks in their first use in combat, to be delivered using the new landing craft tank (LCT). The Churchills, adapted to operate in the shallows near the beach, were a mix of types; some armed with a QF 2-pdr (40 mm) gun in the turret and a close support 3-inch howitzer in the hull, some had the QF 6-pdr (57 mm), and three Churchills were equipped with flame-throwers. Engineers would use explosives to remove obstacles for the tanks.

===Naval support===

The Royal Navy supplied 237 ships and landing craft. However, pre-landing naval gunfire support was limited, consisting of six Hunt-class destroyers each with four or six guns. This was because of the reluctance of First Sea Lord Sir Dudley Pound to risk capital ships in an area he believed vulnerable to attacks by German aircraft. Mountbatten asked Pound to send a battleship in to provide fire support for the Dieppe raid but Pound was mindful that Japanese aircraft had sunk the battlecruiser and the battleship off Malaya in December 1941. Pound would not risk sending capital ships into waters where the Allies did not have air supremacy.

===Air plan===

====Fighter Command====

Over the past eighteen months of inconclusive attritional engagements, Fighter Command had established a measure of air superiority within range of its fighters. Day incursions into British airspace had dwindled to the occasional pair of German fighter bombers racing across the Channel, dropping their bombs and racing back. At 06:15 on 7 July, two ships in the Solent, with troops for Rutter on board, were hit but the bombs failed to explode and passed through their hulls, causing only four casualties. German photographic reconnaissance was much more difficult, because adequate results required the aircraft to fly a set course and height. Repeat sorties once or twice a week were ideal for comparative analysis of photographs but the could manage only one set of pictures a month. A partial reconnaissance was obtained from 28 to 31 July, after Rutter had been cancelled and not again until 24 August, five days after Jubilee. The air plan was to exploit the raid to force the to fight on British terms and suffer a serious defeat; Air Vice-Marshal Trafford Leigh-Mallory, the commander of 11 Group Fighter Command was to command the air effort, for which 56 fighter squadrons, comprising Spitfire fighters, Hurricane fighter-bombers and Typhoon low-level interceptors. Four Mustang Mk I squadrons of Army Cooperation Command were provided for long-range reconnaissance and a contingent of five bomber squadrons were to participate for smoke laying and tactical bombing. The landings could be expected to prompt a maximum effort by the in Northern France, Belgium and the Netherlands, with about 250 fighters and 220 bombers.

Leigh-Mallory controlled the air battle from 11 Group headquarters at RAF Uxbridge; commands flowing through the system as normal to Sector control rooms and from there to the airfields. An RAF officer from Hut 3 at Bletchley Park was seconded to the 11 Group Operations Room to filter material to the Y-stations at RAF Cheadle and RAF Kingsdown which intercepted Wireless telegraphy (W/T) and Radio telephony (R/T) transmissions and used direction finding to pinpoint the origin of the signals. The intention was to reduce the time to pass decryptions of material from German radar, observer posts and fighter control to 11 Group through &quot;the most expert officer in Y on German Fighter Defence and its ramifications&quot;. The Fighter Controllers on the Headquarters ship and could communicate with the raid fighter cover on a shared frequency. The &quot;Close Support&quot; fighters checked in with the headquarters ship as they approached so the Fighter Controller could direct them onto alternative targets as required.

The moving of squadrons within 11 Group and reinforcement with 15 squadrons from outside 11 Group were carried out 14–15 August under the guise of &quot;Exercise Venom&quot;.

====2 Group====
On 29 June, 2 Group, Bomber Command, was ordered to send sixteen Douglas Bostons each from 88 Squadron and 107 Squadron from their East Anglian bases to RAF Ford in West Sussex; 226 Squadron, with its long range Bostons, was to stand by at its base for Operation Rutter. From 4 July, aircraft were to be maintained at thirty minutes readiness to fly Circus operations against German road transport and any tanks that appeared. For speed the crews were briefed in advance and were to have a final briefing at their airfield dispersals just before take-off. The operation was cancelled after two assault ships were bombed by the . On 14 August, 2 Group was notified that the raid on Dieppe was back on as Operation Jubilee. The move to RAF Ford was retained but 226 Squadron was to fly from RAF Thruxton in Hampshire to lay smoke screens to obstruct German gunners on the high ground around Dieppe. No. 226 Squadron, joined by four crews from the other squadrons, began training at Thruxton on smoke munitions, smoke bombs and Smoke Curtain Installations, carried in the bomb bays of some of the Bostons, which were to take off before dawn and operate without fighter escort.

===Intelligence===
Intelligence on the area was sparse: there were dug-in German gun positions on the cliffs, but these had not been detected or spotted by air reconnaissance photographers. The planners had assessed the beach gradient and its suitability for tanks only by scanning holiday snapshots, which led to an underestimation of the German strength and of the terrain. The outline plan for the abortive Operation Rutter (which became the basis for Operation Jubilee) stated that &quot;intelligence reports indicate that Dieppe is not heavily defended and that the beaches in the vicinity are suitable for landing infantry, and armoured fighting vehicles at some&quot;.

===German forces===

====Army====

The Germans were aware that the Allies might launch a large-scale amphibious operation some time in summer 1942. In July, Supreme Commander in the West Field Marshal Gerd von Rundstedt wrote an assessment which concluded that paratroops were to be expected, as well as a large Allied fighter and bomber force. Rundstedt wrote that &quot;at the point of landing, the enemy will win command of the air. He will then use the bulk of his air forces against defences on the ground… The enemy – in order to achieve an attack en masse – will use all the aircraft he has, even slower types&quot;.

In August, German forces at Dieppe were on high alert, having been warned by French double agents that the British were showing interest in the area. They had also detected increased radio traffic and landing craft being concentrated in the southern British coastal ports. Dieppe and the flanking cliffs were well defended; the 1,500-strong garrison from the 302nd Static Infantry Division comprised the Infantry Regiments 570, 571 and 572, each of two battalions, the 302nd Artillery Regiment, the 302nd Reconnaissance Battalion, the 302nd Anti-tank Battalion, the 302nd Engineer Battalion and 302nd Signal Battalion. They were deployed along the beaches of Dieppe and the neighbouring towns, covering all the likely landing places. The city and port were protected by heavy artillery on the main approach (particularly in the myriad cliff caves) and with a reserve at the rear. The defenders were stationed in the towns and in intervening open areas and highlands that overlooked the beaches. Elements of the 571st Infantry Regiment defended the Dieppe radar station near Pourville and the artillery battery over the Scie river at Varengeville. To the east, the Infantry Regiment 570 was deployed near the artillery battery at Berneval-le-Grand.

The fighter force comprised &quot;Jagdgeschwader 2&quot; (JG2) and &quot;Jagdgeschwader 26&quot; (JG26), with about 120 serviceable fighters, mostly Fw 190s to oppose the landings and escort around 100 serviceable bombers of &quot;Kampfgeschwader 2&quot; and the specialist anti-shipping bombers of III./&quot;Kampfgeschwader 53&quot; (KG 53), II./&quot;Kampfgeschwader 40&quot; (KG 40) and I./Kampfgeschwader 77 (KG 77) mostly equipped with Dornier 217s.

==Battle==

On the night of 18/19 August, RAF Coastal Command carried out anti-surface vessel patrols of the coast from Boulogne to Cherbourg; after sunrise the patrols were carried out by fighters. The Allied fleet left the south coast of England during the night, preceded by minesweepers from Newhaven clearing paths through the English Channel, followed by the flotilla of eight destroyers and accompanying Motor Gun Boats escorting the landing craft and Motor Launches.

===Initial landings===
The initial landings began at 04:50 on 19 August, with attacks on the artillery batteries on the flanks of the main landing area. These were Varengeville – Sainte-Marguerite-sur-Mer (known as Orange Beach) by No. 4 Commando, Pourville (Green Beach) by the South Saskatchewan Regiment and the Queen&#x27;s Own Cameron Highlanders of Canada, Puys (Blue Beach) by the Royal Regiment of Canada, and Berneval (Yellow Beach) by No. 3 Commando. On their way in, the landing craft and escorts heading towards Puys and Berneval ran into and exchanged fire with a small German convoy at 03:48. The Allied destroyers and ORP &quot;Ślązak&quot; noticed the engagement, but their commanders incorrectly assumed that the landing craft had come under fire from the shore batteries and did not come to their rescue.
===Yellow beach===


The mission for Lieutenant Colonel John Durnford-Slater and No. 3 Commando was to conduct two landings east of Dieppe to silence the coastal battery &quot;Goebbels&quot; near Berneval. The battery could fire upon the landing at Dieppe to the west. The three and four guns of &quot;2/770 Batterie&quot; had to be out of action by the time the main force approached the main beach.

The craft carrying No. 3 Commando, approaching the coast to the east, were not warned of the approach of a German coastal convoy that had been located by British &quot;Chain Home&quot; radar stations at 21:30. German S-boats escorting a German tanker torpedoed some of the LCP landing craft and disabled the escorting Steam Gun Boat 5. Subsequently, ML 346 (commanded by Lt. A.D. Fear RNVR DSC) and Landing Craft Flak 1 combined to drive off the German boats but the group was dispersed, with some losses. The commandos from six craft who did land on Yellow I were beaten back and, unable to safely retreat or join the main force, had to surrender. Only 18 commandos (commanded by Major Peter Young (historian)) got ashore on Yellow II beach. They reached the perimeter of the battery via Berneval, after it was attacked by Hurricane fighter-bombers, engaging their target with small arms fire. Although unable to destroy the guns, their sniping for a time managed to distract the battery to such good effect that the gunners fired wildly and there was no known instance of this battery sinking any of the assault convoy ships off Dieppe. The commandos were eventually forced to withdraw in the face of superior enemy forces (aboard ML346), and was effected with such haste that Major Young was unable to board the ship: he was towed part of the way to port, in the water, clinging to a line tied to ML 346&#x27;s stern.

===Orange beach===

The mission for Lieutenant Colonel Lord Lovat and No. 4 Commando (including 50 United States Army Rangers) was to conduct two landings west of Dieppe to neutralise the coastal battery at Blancmesnil-Sainte-Marguerite near Varengeville. Landing on the right flank in force at 04:50, they climbed the steep slope and attacked and neutralised their target, the artillery battery of six 150 mm guns. This was the only success of Operation Jubilee. The commando then withdrew at 07:30 as planned. Most of No. 4 safely returned to England. This portion of the raid was considered a model for future amphibious Royal Marine Commando assaults as part of major landing operations. Lord Lovat was awarded the Distinguished Service Order for his part in the raid and Captain Patrick Porteous No. 4 Commando, was awarded the Victoria Cross.
===Blue beach===
The naval engagement between the small German convoy and the craft carrying No. 3 Commando had alerted the German defenders at Blue beach. The landing near Puys by the Royal Regiment of Canada plus three platoons from the Black Watch of Canada and an artillery detachment were tasked to neutralise machine gun and artillery batteries protecting this Dieppe beach.
They were delayed by 20 minutes and the smoke screens that should have hidden their assault had already lifted. The advantages of surprise and darkness were thus lost, while the Germans had manned their defensive positions in preparation for the landings. The well-fortified German forces held the Canadian forces that did land on the beach. As soon as they reached the shore, the Canadians found themselves pinned against the seawall, unable to advance. With a German bunker placed to sweep along the back of the seawall, the Royal Regiment of Canada was annihilated. Of the 556 men in the regiment, 200 were killed and 264 captured.

===Green Beach===

On Green beach at the same time that No. 4 Commando had landed at Orange Beach, the South Saskatchewan Regiment&#x27;s 1st Battalion was headed towards Pourville. They beached at 04:52, without having been detected. The battalion managed to leave their landing craft before the Germans could open fire. However, on the way in, some of the landing craft had drifted off course and most of the battalion found themselves west of the River Scie rather than east of it. Because they had been landed in the wrong place, the battalion, whose objective was the hills east of the village and the Hindenburg Battery artillery, had to enter Pourville to cross the river by the only bridge. Before the Saskatchewans managed to reach the bridge, the Germans had positioned machine guns and anti-tank guns there which stopped their advance. With the battalion&#x27;s dead and wounded piling up on the bridge, Lieutenant Colonel Charles Merritt, the commanding officer, attempted to give the attack impetus by repeatedly and openly crossing the bridge, in order to demonstrate that it was feasible to do so. However, despite the assault resuming, the South Saskatchewans and the Queen&#x27;s Own Cameron Highlanders of Canada, who had landed beside them, were unable to reach their target. While the Camerons did manage to penetrate further inland than any other troops that day, they were also soon forced back as German reinforcements rushed to the scene. Both battalions suffered more losses as they withdrew; only 341 men were able to reach the landing craft and embark, and the rest were left to surrender. For his part in the battle, Lieutenant Colonel Merritt was awarded the Victoria Cross.
====Pourville radar station====

One of the objectives of the Dieppe Raid was to discover the importance and performance of a German radar station on the cliff-top to the east of the town of Pourville. To achieve this, RAF Flight Sergeant Jack Nissenthall, a radar specialist, was attached to the South Saskatchewan Regiment landing at Green Beach. He was to attempt to enter the radar station and learn its secrets, accompanied by a small unit of 11 men of the Saskatchewans as bodyguards. Nissenthall volunteered for the mission fully aware that, due to the highly sensitive nature of his knowledge of Allied radar technology, his Saskatchewan bodyguard unit was under orders to kill him to prevent him from being captured. He also carried a cyanide pill as a last resort.

After the war, Lord Mountbatten said to author James Leasor, when being interviewed during research for the book &quot;Green Beach&quot;, that &quot;If I had been aware of the orders given to the escort to shoot him rather than let him be captured, I would have cancelled them immediately&quot;. Nissenthall and his bodyguards failed to overcome the radar station defences but Nissenthall was able to crawl up to the rear of the station under enemy fire and cut all telephone wires leading to it. The operators inside resorted to radio to talk to their commanders which was intercepted by listening posts on the south coast of England. The Allies were able to learn a great deal about the improved accuracy, location, capacity and density of German radar stations along the Channel coast which helped to convince Allied commanders of the importance of developing radar jamming technology. Only Nissenthall and one South Saskatchewan of the party returned to England.

===Main Canadian landings===
====Red and White Beaches====

Preparing the ground for the main landings, four destroyers were bombarding the coast as landing craft approached. At 05:15, they were joined by five RAF Hurricane squadrons who bombed the coastal defences and set a smokescreen to protect the assault troops. Between 03:30, and 03:40, 30 minutes after the initial landings, the main frontal assault by The Essex Scottish Regiment and the Royal Hamilton Light Infantry started. Their infantry was meant to be supported by Churchill tanks of the 14th Army Tank Regiment landing at the same time, but the tanks arrived on the beach late. As a result, the two infantry battalions had to attack without armour support. They were met with heavy machine-gun fire from emplacements dug into the overlooking cliffs. Unable to clear the obstacles and scale the seawall, they suffered heavy losses. Captain Denis Whitaker of the Royal Hamilton Light Infantry recalled a scene of absolute carnage and confusion, with soldiers being cut down by German fire all along the sea wall while his commanding officer, Colonel Bob Labatt, desperately tried to use a broken radio to contact General Roberts while ignoring his men. When the tanks eventually arrived only 29 were landed. Two of those sank in deep water, and 12 more became bogged down in the soft shingle beach. Only 15 of the tanks made it up to and across the seawall. Once they crossed the seawall, they were confronted by a series of tank obstacles that prevented their entry into the town. Blocked from going further, they were forced to return to the beach where they provided fire support for the now retreating infantry. None of the tanks managed to return to England. All the crews that landed were either killed or captured.
Unaware of the situation on the beaches because of a smoke screen laid by the supporting destroyers, Major General Roberts sent in the two reserve units: the Fusiliers Mont-Royal and the Royal Marines. At 07:00, the Fusiliers under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Dollard Ménard in 26 landing craft sailed towards their beach. They were heavily engaged by the Germans, who hit them with heavy machine gun, mortar and grenade fire, and destroyed them; only a few men managed to reach the town. Those men were then sent in towards the centre of Dieppe and became pinned down under the cliffs and Roberts ordered the Royal Marines to land in order to support them. Not being prepared to support the Fusiliers, the Royal Marines had to transfer from their gunboats and motorboat transports onto landing craft. The Royal Marine landing craft were heavily engaged on their way in with many destroyed or disabled. Those Royal Marines that did reach the shore were either killed or captured. As he became aware of the situation the Royal Marine commanding officer Lieutenant Colonel Phillipps, stood upon the stern of his landing craft and signalled for the rest of his men to turn back. He was killed a few moments later.

During the raid, a mortar platoon from the Calgary Highlanders, commanded by Lieutenant F. J. Reynolds, was attached to the landing force but stayed offshore after the tanks on board (code-named &quot;Bert&quot; and &quot;Bill&quot;) landed. Sergeants Lyster and Pittaway were Mentioned in Despatches for their part in shooting down two German aircraft and one officer of the battalion was killed while ashore with a brigade headquarters.

At 09:40, under heavy fire, the withdrawal from the main landing beaches began and was completed by 14:00.

===Air operations===

At 04:16 six Bostons attacked German coastal artillery in the twilight which led to the results not being observed. Soon afterwards 14 Bostons flew to Dieppe to drop smoke bombs around the German guns on the eastern heights, bombing the batteries between 05:09 and 05:44 with a hundred and fifty smoke bombs at , flying through a storm of anti-aircraft fire. A smoke screen drifted seawards, thickened by the smoke of a burning field of wheat. Six Bristol Blenheim bombers from 13 Squadron and one from 614 Squadron dropped phosphorus bombs south of German sites. Nine of the twelve Bostons were damaged, two crashed on landing and one Blenheim smoke-layer from 614 Squadron was damaged and the pilot wounded, the aircraft crashing on landing and bursting into flames. Just before 08:00 two squadrons of cannon-armed Hurricanes were ordered to attack E-boats coming from Boulogne; they were accompanied by two fighter cover squadrons.

The airfield at Abbeville-Drucat was attacked by 24 Boeing B-17 Flying Fortresses, escorted by four squadrons of USAAF Spitfire IXs at 10:30 putting it out of action for &quot;two vital hours&quot;. After the attack, a wing of Typhoons made a feint towards Ostend The Mustangs reconnoitred outside the main area looking for reinforcements on the roads to Dieppe and from Amiens, Rouen, Yvetot and Le Havre. Flying from RAF Gatwick, they contacted the HQ ship then, having flown a sortie, passed information to the HQ ship before returning to Gatwick and phoning report to the air commander. Reconnaissance sorties were stopped after 12:00 Although taken by surprise, the German fighters soon began to attack the air umbrella. The RAF was moderately successful in protecting the ground and sea forces from aerial bombing but were hampered by operating far from their home bases. Spitfires were at the limit of their range, with some only being able to spend five minutes over the combat area.

As more German aircraft appeared, the number of British aircraft over Dieppe was increased from three to six squadrons and at times up to nine squadrons were present.

Six squadrons (four British, two Canadian) flew the Spitfire Mk IX, the only British fighter equal to the Fw 190, on its operational debut at Dieppe. During the battle, Fighter Command flew 2,500 sorties over Dieppe. The plan to centralise information gleaned from German radar, W/T and R/T and other transmissions failed because the operation against the landing overwhelmed the reporting system and the war room at 11 Group HQ was overwhelmed with reports as the reaction increased. RAF Kingsdown was not informed about developments and failed to identify German fighter reinforcements arriving from all over France and the Low Countries. The new 6IS Fish party, to decrypt high-speed non-Morse transmissions via the German , had no time to prepare and missed important information. Despite the failures of control and intelligence, the air umbrella prevented the from making many attacks on the landing or the evacuation of the Allied force.

==Aftermath==

===Analyses===

====German====

The capture of a copy of the Dieppe plan allowed the Germans to analyse the operation. Rundstedt criticised the plan&#x27;s rigidity, saying that &quot;the plan is in German terms not a plan, it is more a position paper or the intended course of an exercise.&quot; Other senior German officers were equally unimpressed; General Konrad Haase considered it &quot;incomprehensible&quot; that a division was expected to overrun a German regiment that was supported by artillery, &quot;...the strength of naval and air forces was entirely insufficient to suppress the defenders during the landings&quot;. General Adolf-Friedrich Kuntzen could not understand why the Pourville landings were not reinforced with tanks where they might have succeeded in leaving the beach. The Germans were unimpressed by the Churchill tanks left behind; the armament and armour were compared unfavourably with that used in German and Soviet tanks.

The was pleased with how it had performed during the air battle. One report judged the Fw 190, which formed the bulk of the air defence, to be &#x27;in every way suitable as a fighter-bomber&#x27;. It ascribed its good performance despite its marked numerical superiority to the &quot;aggressiveness and better training of the German fighter pilots&quot;. The had been so active during the battle that only 70 of the 230 airframes available at the start of the day were combat ready by day&#x27;s end. The had consumed all its 20mm cannon ammunition available in the West, so much so that there was not enough for routine flight operations in the next couple of days.

The Germans were pleased with their successful defence whilst noting faults in their own communications, transport and location of support forces but recognised that the Allies were certain to learn some lessons from the operation and set about improving the fixed defences. As the overall theatre commander in the West, Rundstedt was adamant that the Germans must learn Dieppe&#x27;s lessons. He was anxious that the Germans were not left behind in learning from Dieppe: &quot;Just as we have gained the most valuable experience from the day of Dieppe, the enemy has learnt as well. Just as we evaluate the experience for the future, so will the enemy. Perhaps he will do this to an even greater extent because he has paid so dearly for it&quot;.

The Dieppe raid also provoked longer-term strategic decisions. In October, Hitler&#x27;s high command produced a &quot;Memorandum Regarding Experiences in Coastal Defence&quot;, which was provoked in large part by Dieppe. This document provided a framework for German commanders to plan coastal defence in the future. It laid down, amongst other principles, that air superiority was the key to a successful coastal defence strategy.

====Allied====
Dieppe became a textbook example of &quot;what not to do&quot; in amphibious operations and laid the framework for the Normandy landings two years later. Dieppe showed the need for
# Preliminary artillery support, including aerial bombardment
# Surprise
# Proper intelligence concerning enemy fortifications
# Avoidance of a frontal attack on a defended port
# Proper re-embarkation craft

While the Canadian contingent fought boldly in the face of a determined enemy, it was ultimately circumstances outside their control which sealed their fate. Despite criticism concerning the inexperience of the Canadian brigades, scholars have noted that even seasoned professionals would have been hard-pressed under the deplorable conditions brought about by their superiors. The commanders who planned the raid on Dieppe had not envisaged such losses. This was one of the first attempts by the Western Allies on a German-held port city. As a consequence, planning from the highest ranks in preparation for the raid was minimal. Basic strategic and tactical errors were made which resulted in a higher than expected Allied (particularly Canadian) death rate.

To help future landings, the British would develop specialist armoured vehicles for engineers to perform tasks protected by armour. Because the tracks of most of the Churchill tanks were caught up in the shingle beach, the Allies began to study beach geology where they intended to land and adapting vehicles for them. The Allies changed their view that capturing a major port was necessary to establish a second front; the damage inflicted on a port to capture it and by the Germans firing demolition charges would make it useless afterwards. Prefabricated Mulberry harbours were to be built and towed to beaches during the invasion.

While the RAF were generally able to keep German aircraft from the land battle and the ships, the operation demonstrated the need for air superiority as well as showing &quot;major deficiencies in RAF ground support techniques&quot; and this led to the creation of an integrated tactical air force for army support.

===Casualties===
Of the nearly 5,000-strong Canadian contingent, 3,367 were killed, wounded or taken prisoner, an exceptional casualty rate of 68 per cent. The 1,000 British Commandos lost 247 men. The Royal Navy lost the destroyer (on the return crossing, it was hit by bombs from a Fw 190 and then scuttled by ) and 33 landing craft, suffering 550 dead and wounded. The RAF lost 106 aircraft. RAF Air Sea Rescue Services picked up around 20 pilots at the loss of three of Dover&#x27;s five High Speed Launches. Among the RAF losses, six RAF aircraft had been shot down by gunners on their own side, one Typhoon was shot down by a Spitfire and two others were lost when their tails broke off (a structural problem with early Typhoons), and two Spitfires collided during the withdrawal across the Channel.

The Germans suffered 591 casualties, 322 fatal and 280 wounded, 48 aircraft and one patrol boat. Of the 50 US Army Rangers serving in Commando units, six were killed, seven wounded and four captured.

The losses at Dieppe were claimed to be a necessary evil. Mountbatten later justified the raid by arguing that lessons learnt at Dieppe in 1942 were put to good use later in the war. He later claimed, &quot;I have no doubt that the Battle of Normandy was won on the beaches of Dieppe. For every man who died in Dieppe, at least 10 more must have been spared in Normandy in 1944.&quot; In direct response to the raid on Dieppe, Churchill remarked that &quot;My Impression of &#x27;Jubilee&#x27; is that the results fully justified the heavy cost&quot; and that it &quot;was a Canadian contribution of the greatest significance to final victory.&quot;

To others, especially Canadians, it was a major disaster. The exception was the success gained by the battle-hardened British commandos against the coast artillery batteries near Varengeville. Of the nearly 5,000 Canadian soldiers, more than 900 were killed (about 18 per cent) and 1,874 taken prisoner (37%).

===German propaganda===

Dieppe was a German propaganda coup in which the Dieppe raid was described as a military joke, noting the amount of time needed to plan such an attack, combined with the losses suffered by the Allies, pointed only to incompetence. German Propaganda Minister Joseph Goebbels and his press chief Otto Dietrich oversaw a propaganda campaign which sought to highlight the raid&#x27;s failure as a sign of German strength and also to reassure the German domestic population that they need not worry about an attack in the West while most German forces were committed in the East. The propaganda value of German news on the raid was enhanced by British foot-dragging, Allied media being forced to carry announcements from German sources. These attempts were made to rally the morale of the German people despite the growing intensity of the Allied strategic bombing campaign on German cities, and large daily casualties on the Eastern Front. Marshal Philippe Pétain of France wrote a letter of congratulation to the German Army for &quot;cleansing French soil of the invader&quot; of this &quot;most recent British aggression&quot;. Pétain suggested that French troops be allowed to serve with German coastal garrisons; this suggestion was not viewed with enthusiasm by the German Army and nothing came of it. The letter was given much publicity in Germany and France as a sign of how the French people allegedly appreciated Germany&#x27;s efforts to defend them from &quot;les Anglo-Saxons&quot;. Pétain&#x27;s letter was later used as an exhibit for the prosecution at his trial for high treason in 1945.

===The air battle===
Fighter Command claimed to have inflicted many losses on the for an RAF loss of 106 aircraft, 88 fighters (including 44 Spitfires), 10 reconnaissance aircraft and eight bombers; 14 other RAF aircraft were struck off charge from other causes such as accidents. Other sources suggest that up to 28 bombers were lost and that the figure for destroyed and damaged Spitfires was 70. The suffered 48 aircraft losses, 28 bombers, half of them Dornier Do 217s from KG 2; JG 2 lost 14 Fw 190s and eight pilots killed, JG 26 lost six Fw 190s with their pilots. The RAF lost 91 aircraft shot down and 64 pilots; 47 killed and 17 taken prisoner, the RCAF lost 14 aircraft and nine pilots and 2 Group lost six bombers. Leigh-Mallory considered the losses &quot;remarkably light in view of the number of Squadrons taking part and the intensity of the fighting&quot; noting that the tactical reconnaissance suffered heaviest with about two casualties per squadron. The in France was back to full strength within days of the raid. Copp wrote that Dieppe failed to inflict the knockout blow against the that the RAF sought. For the rest of 1942, the output of fighters by the United States, Britain, and Canada, combined with better Allied pilot training, led to the gradually losing the war of attrition in the skies above France. Copp concluded that &quot;[t]he battle for air superiority was won on many fronts by continuous effort and Aug. 19, 1942, was part of that achievement.&quot; The Forward Air Controller, Air Commodore Adrian Cole, was injured when &quot;Calpe&quot; was attacked and was awarded the DSO for gallantry.

===Prisoners of war===
Brigadier William Southam brought ashore his copy of the assault plan, classified as a secret document. Southam tried to bury it under the pebbles at the time of his surrender but was spotted and the plan retrieved by the Germans. The plan, later criticised by senior German commanders, including Rundstedt, for its size and needless complexity, contained orders to shackle prisoners. The British Special Service Brigade tied the hands of prisoners taken on raids and the practice had been ordered for the Dieppe Raid &quot;to prevent destruction of their documents&quot;. Roberts objected to this with the chief of combined operations. After capturing the orders for Operation Jubilee, the Germans threatened on 2 September to shackle the prisoners taken at Dieppe. The War Office announced that if an order existed it would be rescinded and the Germans withdrew the threat on 3 September. On 7 October the Germans revived the controversy after more information emerged about the Dieppe operation and that German prisoners taken during the small 4 October raid on Sark were alleged to have been tied. On 8 October British and Canadian prisoners were tied in reprisal, which led to counter reprisals. Supposed violations of the Geneva Convention committed by Allied commandos against German POWs at Dieppe and Sark was one of the reasons Hitler gave for the Commando Order of October 1942 for all Allied commando prisoners to be executed.

===Civilians===
Civilians were handed leaflets by the Canadians telling them it was only a raid and not to get involved; despite this a small number of civilians provided help to the wounded and later passed clothing and food to Canadian prisoners. Civilians also volunteered to help collect and bury the Canadian fallen, including the 475 washed ashore. Hitler decided to reward the town for not helping in the raid by freeing French POWs from Dieppe and Berlin radio announced the release of of Dieppe&quot; imprisoned since 1940. For the town residents&#x27; &quot;perfect discipline and calm&quot;, although the residents had not had much time to furnish the invaders with an instant Fifth Column, Hitler gave the town a gift of Fr 10 million, to repair the damage caused during the raid.

===German preparedness===

The fiasco has led to a discussion of whether the Germans knew of the raid in advance. Since June 1942, the BBC had been broadcasting warnings to French civilians of a &quot;likely&quot; action, urging them to quickly evacuate the Atlantic coastal districts. Indeed, on the day of the raid itself, the BBC announced it, albeit at 08:00, after the landings had taken place.

First-hand accounts and memoirs of many Canadian veterans who documented their experiences on the shores of Dieppe remark about the preparedness of the German defences as if they were warned, on touching down on the Dieppe shore, the landing ships were immediately shelled with the utmost precision as troops disembarked. Commanding officer Lt Colonel Labatt testified to having seen markers on the beach used for mortar practice, which appeared to have been recently placed.

The belief that the Germans were forewarned has been strengthened by accounts of German and Allied POWs. Major C. E. Page, while interrogating a German soldier, found out that four machine-gun battalions were brought in &quot;specifically&quot; in anticipation of a raid. There are numerous accounts of interrogated German prisoners, German captors and French citizens who all conveyed to Canadians that the Germans had been preparing for the landing for weeks. Captain Stephen Roskill, Britain&#x27;s official naval historian, wrote an article for the prestigious Royal United Services Institution arguing the opposite case in 1964. Roskill&#x27;s article relied on German documentary evidence to show that any warnings of an Allied raid on Dieppe were purely coincidental. In his 2023 study of the battle from the German point of view, James Shelley concluded that there was no evidence to support the view that the Germans had any specific intelligence that a raid was planned against Dieppe.

The German convoy that bumped into the Allied ships failed to get messages to shore due to damage to their radio aerials in the fire fight; however, the operator of the long range Freya 28 (Radar) at Pourville correctly identified five columns of stationary ships at 03:45 at a range of 35 km. An alert was given to the Navy command who did not believe the warning, but when the ships started to head to shore a further warning was given at 04:35. Troops along the coast had heard gun fire out to sea and some units went to alert. It was 05:05 before German orders came from Le Havre for artillery to open fire. Within an hour the extent of the attack was being understood by German command and reserves were notified to prepare to move to the coast.

====&quot;Daily Telegraph&quot; crossword controversy====
On 17 August 1942, the clue &quot;French port (6)&quot; appeared in the &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot; crossword (compiled by Leonard Dawe), followed by the solution, &quot;Dieppe&quot;; the raid on Dieppe took place the next day, on 19 August. The War Office suspected that the crossword had been used to pass intelligence to the Germans and called upon Lord Tweedsmuir, a senior intelligence officer attached to the Canadian Army, to investigate. Tweedsmuir later said, &quot;We noticed that the crossword contained the word &#x27;Dieppe&#x27;, and there was an immediate and exhaustive inquiry which also involved MI5. But in the end, it was concluded that it was just a remarkable coincidence – a complete fluke&quot;. A similar crossword coincidence occurred in May 1944, prior to D-Day. Multiple terms associated with Operation Overlord (including the word &quot;Overlord&quot;) appeared in the &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot; crossword (also written by Dawe) and after another investigation by MI5, it was concluded that it was another coincidence. Further to this, a former student identified that Dawe frequently requested words from his students, many of whom were children in the same area as US military personnel.

===The Enigma pinch===
Research undertaken over a 15-year period by military historian David O&#x27;Keefe uncovered 100,000 pages of classified British military archival files that documented a &quot;pinch&quot; mission overseen by Ian Fleming (best known later as author of the James Bond novels), as the main purpose of the Dieppe Raid. O&#x27;Keefe states that No. 30 Commando was sent to Dieppe to capture one of the new German 4-rotor Enigma code machines, plus associated codebooks and rotor setting sheets. The Naval Intelligence Division (NID) planned the &quot;pinch&quot; to pass such items to cryptanalysts at Bletchley Park to assist with Ultra decryption operations. According to O&#x27;Keefe the presence of other troops landing at Dieppe was to provide support and create a distraction for the commando units ordered to reach the German admiralty headquarters and capture the Enigma machine; they were a cover for the Enigma target.

No. 30 Commando was formed, as the Special Intelligence Unit, in September
1942 (a month after the raid), composed of 33 (Royal Marines) Troop, 34 (Army) Troop, 35 (RAF) Troop and 36 (Royal Navy) Troop. It was later renamed 30 RN Commando (Special Engineering Unit). Later research identified the unit in the Dieppe raid as No. 3 Troop of No. 10 (Inter-Allied) Commando, known as the X-Troop.

In August 2017, naval historian Eric Grove described &#x27;Enigma Pinch&#x27; as &quot;more a reflection of the contemporary fascination with secret intelligence rather than the reality of 1942.&quot; Obtaining useful intelligence was among the objectives – including the capture of a four-rotor Enigma cipher machine but it was one of many objectives. Grove concludes that the Dieppe Raid was not, as claimed, cover for a &#x27;snatch&#x27; and also recognises that the decision to form the Intelligence Assault Units to gather intelligence material was not made until after Operation Jubilee had been ordered.

Leah Garret in her 2021 book &quot;X-Troop: The Secret Jewish Commandos of World War Two&quot;, found new evidence to support O&#x27;Keefe&#x27;s conclusion that Dieppe was a cover for a pinch on naval headquarters. A British unit was created made up of anti-Nazi Germans who had fled the Sudetenland; a five-man team from X Troop was to break into the Enigma machine&#x27;s room at Dieppe and take the machine and code books. (German speakers were needed to identify the relevant code documents, and possibly, to interrogate prisoners taken.) Garret found a formerly classified after-action report written by &quot;Maurice Latimer&quot;, the Anglicised name of the one Sudeten German who returned from the mission, who reported that his orders were &quot;to proceed immediately to German General HQ in Dieppe to pick up all documents, etc of value, including, if possible, a new German respirator&quot; (almost certainly a code word referring to the Enigma machine). The mission failed, with one member killed, another seriously wounded, and two taken prisoner.

==Commemoration==
===Dieppe War Cemetery===

Allied dead were initially buried in a mass grave but at the insistence of the German Army Graves Commission the bodies were reburied at a site used by a British hospital in 1939 in Vertus Wood on the edge of the town. The Dieppe Canadian War Cemetery headstones have been placed back-to-back in double rows, the norm for a German war cemetery but unusual for Commonwealth War Graves Commission sites. When the Allies liberated Dieppe as part of Operation Fusilade in 1944, the grave markers were replaced with standard CWGC headstones but the layout was left unchanged to avoid disturbing the remains.

===Honours and awards===
Three Victoria Crosses were awarded for the operation: one to Captain Patrick Porteous, Royal Regiment of Artillery attached to No. 4 Commando, in the British forces; and two to Canadians – the Reverend John Weir Foote, padre to the Royal Hamilton Light Infantry and Merritt of the South Saskatchewan Regiment.

Porteous was severely wounded in the battle but was evacuated at the end of the battle; both Foote and Merritt were captured and became prisoners of war, although in the instance of Foote, he deliberately abandoned his landing craft and chose to be captured so that he could minister to his fellow Canadians who were now POWs.

Marcel Lambert of the 14th Army Tank Regiment (The Calgary Regiment (Tank)), fought aggressively in the battle and was captured. He, along with all the participants in the raid, was awarded a &quot;certificate&quot; from the Government of France. In the 1980s the Government of Canada issued to all raid veterans a &quot;volunteer service medal.&quot;

Despite the failure of the operation, Major General Roberts was awarded the Distinguished Service Order. Among the enlisted personnel, Private William A. Haggard of the South Saskatchewan Regiment was awarded the Distinguished Conduct Medal, and subsequently, field promoted to lieutenant, for his actions during the raid.

A Canadian signalman, Sergeant David Lloyd Hart, was awarded the Military Medal for his efforts during the raid. Hart maintained what became the sole line of radio communications between the men ashore and the commanders out at sea. He is credited with saving the lives of 100 men through his signals work, being able to order their retreat. Hart later became the longest-serving officer in the Canadian Armed Forces, serving in active and honorary roles for 81 years. He died in March 2019, aged 101.

U.S. Army Ranger Corporal Frank Koons became the first American soldier in the Second World War to receive a British award for bravery in action, a Military Medal.

<text>Josef Sudek (17 March 1896 – 15 September 1976) was a Czech photographer, best known for his photographs of Prague.

==Life==

Sudek was born in Kolín, Bohemia. He was originally a bookbinder. During the First World War he was drafted into the Austro-Hungarian Army in 1915 and served on the Italian Front until he was wounded in the right arm in 1916 which led to the limb being amputated at the shoulder. After the war he studied photography for two years in Prague under Jaromír Funke. His army disability pension gave him leeway to make art, and he worked during the 1920s in the romantic Pictorialist style. Always pushing at the boundaries, a local camera club expelled him for arguing about the need to move forwards from &#x27;painterly&#x27; photography. Despite only having one arm, he used large, bulky cameras with the aid of assistants.

Sudek&#x27;s photography is sometimes said to be modernist. But this is only true of a couple of years in the 1930s, during which he undertook commercial photography, including contributions to the illustrated Prague weekly &quot;Pestrý týden&quot; and thus worked &quot;in the style of the times&quot;. Primarily, his personal photography is neo-romantic. 

His early work included many series of light falling in the interior of St. Vitus Cathedral. During and after World War II Sudek created haunting night-scapes and panoramas of Prague, photographed the wooded landscape of Bohemia, and the window-glass that led to his garden (the famous &quot;The Window of My Atelier&quot; series). He went on to photograph the crowded interior of his studio (the &quot;Labyrinths&quot; series).

He first showed his work in &quot;Five Photographers&quot; at the Sheldon Museum of Art at the University of Nebraska/Lincoln in 1968. Then he showed at the
George Eastman House in 1974 and he published 16 books during his life.

Known as the &quot;Poet of Prague&quot;, Sudek never married, and was a shy, retiring person. He never appeared at his exhibit openings and few people appear in his photographs. Despite the privations of the war and Communism, he kept a renowned record collection of classical music.

In recent years, his work has frequently been reproduced in books, making his work some of the most readily accessible to those interested in twentieth-century Czech photography.

In 1984 Sudek was posthumously inducted into the International Photography Hall of Fame and Museum.

== Sudek in literature ==

In addition to conventional biographies of Sudek, John Banville&#x27;s &quot;Prague Pictures: Portraits of a City&quot; introduces the reader to the city through the photographic lens of Joseph Sudek. Banville relates how he became enlisted to smuggle Sudek&#x27;s photographs to the United States and through his tale and the story of Sudek muses on the history of Prague in its gravity and melancholy, torn by war and oppression. He re-creates the anxiety that must have faced the photographer in a city where, under Nazi occupation, landscape photography could be a mortal offense.

Sudek was used as a symbolic presence in Howard Norman&#x27;s novel &quot;Devotion&quot;. The protagonist, David Kozol, was a photographer and mentored under Sudek. David Kozol remarks on the melancholy that pervaded Sudek&#x27;s work and a similar mood persists through the novel. Sudek figures symbolically in the novel; David Kozol&#x27;s mother in law worked as a book binder and it was through apprenticeship to a book binder that Sudek became interested in photography. The characters seem to be symbolically injured or emotionally broken like the one armed Sudek and visual imagery figures prominently.

In 2006 the Dutch poet Hans Tentije published a bundle containing the poem: &quot;Met Josef Sudek op weg door Praag&quot;, &quot;On my way through Prague with Sudek&quot;. In nine parts the poet &quot;helps&quot; Sudek with his photography.

<doc id="358707" wikidata="Q310638" url="?curid=358707" title="George Szell">
<text>George Szell (; June 7, 1897 – July 30, 1970), originally György Széll, György Endre Szél, or Georg Szell, was a Hungarian-born American conductor and composer. Considered one of the twentieth century&#x27;s greatest conductors, he was music director of the Cleveland Orchestra of Cleveland, Ohio, and recorded much of the standard classical repertoire in Cleveland and with other orchestras.

Szell came to Cleveland in 1946 to take over its respected if undersized orchestra, which was struggling to recover from the disruptions of World War II. By the time of his death he was credited, to quote the critic Donal Henahan, with having built it into &quot;what many critics regarded as the world&#x27;s keenest symphonic instrument.&quot;

Through his recordings, Szell has remained a presence in the classical music world long after his death, and his name remains synonymous with that of the Cleveland Orchestra. While on tour with the Orchestra in the late 1980s, then-Music Director Christoph von Dohnányi remarked, &quot;We give a great concert, and George Szell gets a great review.&quot;

==Life and career==

===Early life===
György Endre Szél was born in Budapest but grew up in Vienna. His family was of Jewish origin but converted to Catholicism. As a young boy he was taken regularly to Mass.

===Early career===

Szell began his formal music training as a pianist, studying with Richard Robert. One of Robert&#x27;s other students was Rudolf Serkin; Szell and Serkin became lifelong friends and musical collaborators.

At the age of eleven, he began touring Europe as a pianist and composer, making his London debut at that age. Newspapers declared him &quot;the next Mozart.&quot; Throughout his teenage years he performed with orchestras in this dual role, eventually making appearances as composer, pianist and conductor, as he did with the Berlin Philharmonic at age seventeen.
Szell quickly realized that he was never going to make a career out of being a composer or pianist and that he much preferred the artistic control he could achieve as a conductor. He made an unplanned public conducting debut when he was seventeen, while vacationing with his family at a summer resort. The Vienna Symphony&#x27;s conductor had injured his arm, and Szell was asked to substitute. Szell quickly turned to conducting full-time. Though he abandoned composing, throughout the rest of his life he occasionally played the piano with chamber ensembles and as an accompanist. Despite his rare appearances as a pianist after his teens, he remained in good form. During his Cleveland years he occasionally would demonstrate to guest pianists how he thought they should play a certain passage.

In 1915, at the age of 18, Szell won an appointment with Berlin&#x27;s Royal Court Opera (now known as the Staatsoper). There, he was befriended by its Music Director, Richard Strauss. Strauss instantly recognized Szell&#x27;s talent and was particularly impressed with how well the teenager conducted Strauss&#x27;s music. Strauss once said that he could die a happy man knowing that there was someone who performed his music so perfectly. In fact, Szell ended up conducting part of the world premiere recording of &quot;Don Juan&quot; for Strauss. The composer had arranged for Szell to rehearse the orchestra for him, but having overslept, showed up an hour late to the recording session. Since the recording session was already paid for, and only Szell was there, Szell conducted the first half of the recording (since no more than four minutes of music could fit onto one side of a 78, the music was broken up into four sections). Strauss arrived as Szell was finishing conducting the second part; he exclaimed that what he heard was so good that it could go out under his own name. Strauss went on to record the last two parts, leaving the Szell-conducted half as part of the full world premiere recording of &quot;Don Juan.&quot;

Szell credited Strauss as being a major influence on his conducting style. Much of Szell&#x27;s baton technique, the Cleveland Orchestra&#x27;s lean, transparent sound and Szell&#x27;s willingness to be an orchestra builder, were influenced by Strauss. The two remained friends after Szell left the Royal Court Opera in 1919; even after World War II, when Szell had settled in the United States, Strauss kept track of how his protégé was doing.

In the fifteen years during and after World War 1, Szell worked with opera houses and orchestras in Europe: in Berlin, Strasbourg — where he succeeded Otto Klemperer at the Municipal Theatre — Prague, Darmstadt, and Düsseldorf, before becoming principal conductor, in 1924, of the Berlin Staatsoper, which had replaced the Royal Opera. In 1923 he conducted the premiere of Hans Gál&#x27;s opera &quot;Die heilige Ente&quot; in Düsseldorf.

===Move to the U.S.===
At the outbreak of war in Europe in 1939, Szell was returning via the U.S. from an Australian tour and ended up settling with his family in New York City. From 1940 to 1945 he taught composition, orchestration, and music theory at the Mannes College of Music in Manhattan; his composition students at Mannes included George Rochberg and Ursula Mamlok. In 1946, Szell became a naturalized U. S. citizen.

===The Cleveland Orchestra: 1946 to 1970===
“A new leaf will be turned over with a bang!” said Szell, who was named Music Director and Conductor of The Cleveland Orchestra in January 1946. “People talk about the New York, the Boston, and the Philadelphia. Now they will talk about the New York, the Boston, the Philadelphia, and the Cleveland.” However, Szell&#x27;s time in Cleveland began during a period of unrest and uncertainty. The Orchestra&#x27;s previous music director, Erich Leinsdorf, had temporarily vacated his post after being drafted into the armed forces. During Leinsdorf&#x27;s absence, Szell made his Severance Hall debut — in November 1944 — to glowing reviews. And despite Leinsdorf&#x27;s impending return, public opinion shifted toward Szell. Following intense negotiations that included granting Szell complete artistic control over personnel, programming, scheduling, and recording, the Orchestra&#x27;s Board of Trustees appointed him the ensemble&#x27;s fourth music director.
Shortly after accepting the position, Szell remarked that he would &quot;dedicate all [his] efforts...to make The Cleveland Orchestra second to none in quality of performance.&quot; He devoted much of his energy to exacting his will on his musicians — releasing some and hiring others in an effort to achieve his desired sound. He expected technical perfection and total commitment from musicians during rehearsals and performances. His standards were stringent, his goals lofty: He was singularly focused on elevating the Orchestra to new levels of excellence.

Not long into his tenure, Szell began making guest appearances in other cities, especially New York, and Cleveland steadily gained a reputation as one of the world&#x27;s leading ensembles. By the early 1950s, he&#x27;d grown concerned about &quot;dry&quot; acoustics at Severance Hall — an issue that had preoccupied him since his arrival in Cleveland. &quot;I only wish you had a hall with acoustics worthy of your great art,&quot; said Leopold Stokowski, former conductor of the Philadelphia Orchestra. &quot;In the hall the music was dry and half dead-sounding.&quot; Although plywood was later added to the hall, further changes were still required to achieve Szell&#x27;s desired tone.

As early as the 1955-56 season, Szell recognized the need for an outdoor venue at which the Orchestra would host summer concerts and programs. During the preceding years, summer attendance for Orchestra performances at Cleveland&#x27;s Public Auditorium had waned and, among the adjustments made to provide employment for the musicians, a series of concerts was played before Cleveland Indians baseball games. Around the same time, Szell determined that the Orchestra needed to embark on its first international tour if it hoped to keep pace with other major symphonies. As a result, the Orchestra traveled to Europe in the spring of 1957, with stops in Antwerp, Brussels, and behind the Iron Curtain. The tour was a success, bringing the Orchestra worldwide acclaim and instilling a sense of pride in the citizens of Cleveland.

The next decade or so was a busy and fruitful time for Szell and the Orchestra. By the 1958-59 season, acoustic renovations had been completed on a new stage — the Szell Shell — that surrounded the musicians and projected their tone in a different way, eliminating “dryness” and providing clearer-sounding strings. In July 1968, the Orchestra opened its new summer home, Blossom Music Center, about 25 miles south of Cleveland, providing Szell and his musicians with year-round employment. Two years later, in May 1970, the Orchestra continued to advance its reputation internationally by touring to the Far East, including stops in Japan and Korea.

However, Szell&#x27;s health began to deteriorate. During a concert in Anchorage, Alaska, Szell ceased conducting momentarily and, as cellist Michael Haber recalled, &quot;I felt a chill through my body...I remember thinking something was terribly wrong.&quot; Indeed, something was wrong: This was Szell&#x27;s final performance, and he died on July 30, 1970.

==Conducting style==
Szell&#x27;s manner in rehearsal was that of an autocratic taskmaster. He meticulously prepared for rehearsals and could play the entire score on the piano from memory. Preoccupied with phrasing, transparency, balance and architecture, Szell also insisted upon hitherto unheard-of rhythmic discipline from his players. The result was often a level of precision and ensemble playing normally found only in the best string quartets. For all Szell&#x27;s absolutist methods, many of the orchestra&#x27;s players were proud of the musical integrity to which he aspired. Video footage also shows that Szell took care to explain what he wanted and why, expressed delight when the orchestra produced what he was aiming for, and avoided over-rehearsing parts that were in good shape. His left hand, which he used to shape each sound, was often called the most graceful in music.

As a result of Szell&#x27;s exactitude and very thorough rehearsals, some critics (such as Donald Vroon, editor of &quot;American Record Guide&quot;) have censured Szell&#x27;s music-making as lacking emotion. In response to such criticism, Szell expressed this credo: &quot;The borderline is very thin between clarity and coolness, self-discipline and severity. There exist different nuances of warmth — from the chaste warmth of Mozart to the sensuous warmth of Tchaikovsky, from the noble passion of &quot;Fidelio&quot; to the lascivious passion of &quot;Salome&quot;. I cannot pour chocolate sauce over asparagus.&quot; He further stated: &quot;It is perfectly legitimate to prefer the hectic, the arhythmic, the untidy. But to my mind, great artistry is not disorderliness.&quot;

He has been described as a &quot;literalist&quot;, playing only what is in the score. However, Szell was quite prepared to play music in unconventional ways if he thought the music needed these; and, like most other conductors before and since, he made many small modifications to orchestrations and notes in the works of Beethoven, Schubert and others.

Cloyd Duff, timpanist with the Cleveland Orchestra, once recalled how Szell had insisted that he play the snare drum part in Bartok&#x27;s Concerto for Orchestra, an instrument which he was not supposed to play. A month after having recorded the concerto in Cleveland (October 1959), it was to be performed at Carnegie Hall, as part of an annual two-week tour of the Eastern United States along with Prokofiev&#x27;s Symphony No. 5. Szell had begun getting increasingly irritated about the side drum part in the second movement and by the time they reached New York City, Szell&#x27;s escalation was going off the scale. &quot;Starting with the one who had played on the recording, Szell tried out each of the staff percussionists on the side drum part. He made them so nervous that, one by one, they all stumbled. Finally Szell turned to timpanist Cloyd Duff.&quot;

This is the story as Duff tells it:

Szell&#x27;s reputation as a perfectionist was well-known, and his knowledge of instruments was deep. The Cleveland trumpeter Bernard Adelstein recounted Szell&#x27;s knowledge of the trumpet:

==Repertoire==
Szell primarily conducted works from the core Austro-German classical and romantic repertoire, from Haydn, Mozart and Beethoven, through Mendelssohn, Schumann, and Brahms and on to Wagner, Bruckner, Mahler and Strauss. He said once that as he got older he consciously narrowed his repertoire, feeling it was &quot;actually my task to do those works which I thought I&#x27;m best qualified to do, and for which a certain tradition is disappearing with the disappearance of the great conductors who were my contemporaries and my idols and my unpaid teachers.&quot; He did program contemporary music, however; he gave numerous world premieres in Cleveland, and he was particularly associated with such composers as Dutilleux, Walton, Prokofiev, Hindemith and Bartók. Szell also helped initiate the Cleveland Orchestra&#x27;s long association with the composer-conductor Pierre Boulez.

==Other orchestras==

After World War II Szell became closely associated with the Concertgebouw Orchestra of Amsterdam, where he was a frequent guest conductor and made a number of recordings. He also regularly appeared with the London Symphony Orchestra, Chicago Symphony Orchestra, the Vienna Philharmonic, and at the Salzburg Festival. From 1942 to 1955, he was an annual guest conductor of the New York Philharmonic and served as Musical Advisor and senior guest conductor of that orchestra in the last year of his life. In 1960 he conducted the Columbia Symphony Orchestra with Robert Casadesus in a recording for Columbia Masterworks of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart&#x27;s Piano Concerto No. 22 in E flat, K.482 and Mozart&#x27;s Piano Concerto No. 23 in A major, K. 488 (ML 5594, 1960).

==Personal life==
Szell married twice. The first, in 1920 to Olga Band (1898-1984), another of Richard Robert&#x27;s pupils, ended in divorce in 1926. His second marriage, in 1938 to Helene Schultz Teltsch, originally from Prague, was much happier, and lasted until his death. Szell had homes on Park Avenue in New York City and in Shaker Heights, near Cleveland&#x27;s orchestra hall. When not making music, he was a gourmet cook and an automobile enthusiast. He regularly refused the services of the orchestra&#x27;s chauffeur and drove his own Cadillac to rehearsal until almost the end of his life.

The British government made Szell an honorary Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in 1963.

==Death==
He died from bone-marrow cancer in Cleveland in 1970. His body was cremated, and his ashes were buried, in Sandy Springs, Georgia, along with his wife upon her death in 1991.

==Discography==

Most of Szell&#x27;s recordings were made with the Cleveland Orchestra for Epic/Columbia Masterworks (now Sony Classical). He also made recordings with the New York Philharmonic, the Vienna Philharmonic and the Amsterdam Concertgebouw Orchestra. Many live stereo recordings of repertoire Szell never conducted in the studio exist, both with the Cleveland Orchestra and other orchestras.
