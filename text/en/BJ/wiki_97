<text>The term pro forma (Latin for &quot;as a matter of form&quot; or &quot;for the sake of form&quot;) is most often used to describe a practice or document that is provided as a courtesy or satisfies minimum requirements, conforms to a norm or doctrine, tends to be performed or is considered a formality. The term is used in legal and business fields to refer to various types of documents that are generated as a matter of course.

== Accounting ==
The &quot;pro forma&quot; accounting is a statement of the company&#x27;s financial activities while excluding &quot;unusual and nonrecurring transactions&quot; when stating how much money the company actually made. Examples of expenses often excluded from &quot;pro forma&quot; results are company restructuring costs, a decline in the value of the company&#x27;s investments, or other accounting charges, such as adjusting the current balance sheet to fix faulty accounting practices in previous years.

There was a boom in the reporting of &quot;pro forma&quot; results in the US starting in the late 1990s, with many dot-com companies using the technique to recast their losses as profits, or at least to show smaller losses than the US GAAP accounting showed. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission requires publicly traded companies in the United States to report US GAAP-based financial results, and has cautioned companies that using &quot;pro forma&quot; results to obscure US GAAP results would be considered fraud if used to mislead investors.

== Business ==

===Financial statements===
In business, &quot;pro forma&quot; financial statements are prepared in advance of a planned transaction, such as a merger, an acquisition, a new capital investment, or a change in capital structure such as incurrence of new debt or issuance of stock. 

The &quot;pro forma&quot; models the anticipated results of the transaction, with particular emphasis on the projected cash flows, net revenues and taxes. 
Consequently, &quot;pro forma&quot; statements summarize the projected future status of a company, based on the current financial statements. &quot;Pro forma&quot; figures should be clearly labeled as such and the reason for any deviation from reported past figures clearly explained. 

For example, when a transaction with a material effect on a company&#x27;s financial condition is contemplated, the finance department will prepare, for management and board review, a business plan containing &quot;pro forma&quot; financial statements demonstrating the expected effect of the proposed transaction on the company&#x27;s financial viability. Lenders and investors will require such statements to structure or confirm compliance with debt covenants such as debt service reserve coverage and debt to equity ratios. Similarly, when a new corporation is envisioned, its founders will prepare &quot;pro forma&quot; financial statements for the information of prospective investors. Also, banks will request &quot;pro forma&quot; statements in lieu of tax returns for a start up business in order to verify cash flow before issuing a loan or line of credit.

===Invoices===
In trade transactions, a &quot;pro forma invoice&quot; is a document that states a commitment from the seller to sell goods to the buyer at specified prices and terms. It is used to declare the value of the trade. It is not a true invoice because it is not used to record accounts receivable for the seller and accounts payable for the buyer.

Simply, a &quot;&quot;pro forma&quot; invoice&quot; is a &quot;confirmed purchase order&quot; where buyer and supplier agree on detail and cost of the product to be shipped to the buyer. A &quot;pro forma&quot; invoice is generally raised when the seller is ready for dispatching the material but they want to ensure that the payment is being sent before dispatch. And similarly, the customer also wants to know which components are included in the &quot;pro forma&quot; invoice to avoid disagreements later.

A sales quote is prepared in the form of a &quot;pro forma&quot; invoice, which is different from a commercial invoice. It is used to create a sale and is sent in advance of the commercial invoice. The content of a &quot;pro forma&quot; invoice is almost identical to a commercial invoice and is usually considered a binding agreement, but because a &quot;pro forma&quot; invoice is not a legally-binding document, the price may change in advance of the final sale.

A &quot;pro forma&quot; invoice can also be used for shipments containing items that &quot;are not&quot; being bought or sold, such as gifts, samples and personal belongings, whereas a commercial invoice is used when the commodities shipped &quot;are&quot; being bought or sold. However, it is best to use a customs invoice or declaration as border officials require values for the export declaration. A Customs Invoice or declaration is commonly used in New Zealand for air parcel post shipments.

==== International trade ====
A &quot;pro forma&quot; invoice is the same as a commercial invoice, which, when used in international trade, represents the details of an international sale to customs authorities. A &quot;pro forma&quot; invoice is presented in the place of a commercial invoice when there is no sale between the sender and the importer (for example, in the case of an RMA for replacement goods), or if the terms of the sale between the seller and the buyer are such that a commercial invoice is not yet available at the time of the international shipment. A &quot;pro forma&quot; invoice is required to state the same facts that the commercial invoice would and the content is prescribed by the governments who are a party to the transaction.

In some countries, customs may accept a &quot;pro forma&quot; invoice (generated by the importer and not the exporter) if the required commercial invoice is not available at the time when filing entry documents at the port of entry to get goods released from customs. The U.S. Customs and Border Protection, for example, uses &quot;pro forma&quot; invoices to assess duty and examine goods, but the importer on record is required to post a bond and produce a commercial invoice within 120 days from the date of entry. If the required commercial invoice is needed for statistical purposes, the importer has to produce the commercial invoice within 50 days from the date Customs releases the goods to the importer.

== Law ==
In law, &quot;pro forma&quot; court rulings are intended merely to facilitate the legal process (indeed to move matters along).

== Government ==

===Westminster system===
In certain Commonwealth nations with a Westminster system, such as the United Kingdom, Canada, and Australia, &quot;pro forma&quot; bills are introduced immediately before consideration of the speech from the throne. &quot;Pro forma&quot; bills are incomplete pieces of legislation and undergo only the first reading stage. They symbolize the authority of the parliament to discuss matters other than those specified by the head of state, for which ostensibly parliament was summoned. After first reading, the bill is never considered further. The &quot;pro forma&quot; bill was first introduced in the House of Commons of England in 1558.

In the Parliament of the United Kingdom, the equivalents are the Outlawries Bill in the House of Commons and the Select Vestries Bill in the House of Lords. In the Parliament of Canada, such bills are titled Bill C-1, An Act respecting the Administration of Oaths of Office, and Bill S-1, An Act relating to Railways in the House of Commons of Canada and Senate of Canada, respectively. In the Australian House of Representatives, a new bill (known as the &quot;formal&quot; or &quot;privilege bill&quot;) is drafted at the start of each parliamentary term (e.g. in the 47th Parliament this was the Customs Amendment Bill 2022) and presented by the Prime Minister. The bill is read the first time and is printed (published), but, unlike normal bills, the second reading is not moved and remains on the agenda indefinitely. However, departing from British and Canadian tradition, the contents of the bills do address the matters referred to in its title, and could theoretically be enacted like any other normal bill. This practice does not extend to the Australian Senate; instead other formal business is conducted (such as question time and procedural motions) before consideration of the governor-general&#x27;s speech.

===United States===

In the federal government of the United States, either house of the Congress (the House of Representatives or the Senate) can hold a &quot;pro forma&quot; session at which no formal business is expected to be conducted. This is usually to fulfill the obligation under the Constitution &quot;that neither chamber can adjourn for more than three days without the consent of the other.&quot; &quot;Pro forma&quot; sessions can also be used to prevent the president from pocket-vetoing bills, or calling the Congress into special session. They have also been used to prevent presidents from making recess appointments.

In 2012 President Barack Obama attempted to make four appointments during a &quot;pro forma&quot; session, calling the practice of blocking recess appointments into question. However, in 2014 the Supreme Court of the United States in &quot;NLRB v. Noel Canning&quot; determined that the President had improperly used his presidential power to make these appointments, stating that while the Senate was in recess punctuated by &quot;pro forma&quot; sessions the period of time between the sessions was not long enough to invoke such power.

In April 2020, President Donald Trump claimed that the president&#x27;s constitutional power under Article II, Section 3 empowered him to suspend both houses of Congress (overriding the &quot;pro forma&quot; procedure), thus enabling him to make appointments to vacant government positions while Congress is suspended. Article II, Section 3 enables the president to &quot;convene or adjourn Congress&quot; ... &quot;on extraordinary occasions&quot;, a power that has never been used to adjourn Congress, though it has been used on rare occasions to convene Congress. The suggestion was condemned by former Clinton Press Secretary Joe Lockhart and quickly shot down by the Republican Senate leader Mitch McConnell. In addition, the president&#x27;s constitutional power to adjourn either or both houses of Congress is limited to situations in which the &quot;Time of Adjournment&quot; is disagreed upon between the House and Senate creating a &quot;Case of Disagreement&quot;, which implicates Article I, Section 5 of the Constitution, which prohibits either house of Congress from adjourning for more than three days without the consent of the other house of Congress. However, the system of &quot;pro forma&quot; sessions every three days by both houses of Congress would appear to represent an obstacle to finding a Constitutional &quot;Case of Disagreement&quot; between the houses of Congress regarding an adjournment of more than three days if neither house of Congress ever deems itself adjourned for more than three days and therefore never seeks the consent of the other house of Congress to adjourn and therefore never creates a situation in which a &quot;Case of Disagreement&quot; could arise to authorize the President to exercise this power.

Similar practices exist in the state legislatures, and for similar reasons; for example, in Minnesota, legislative bodies have the same every-three-days meeting requirement that Congress has. &quot;Pro forma&quot; sessions are held to meet this requirement.

<doc id="373991" wikidata="Q3306359" url="?curid=373991" title="Atomicity (database systems)">
<text>In database systems, atomicity (; from ) is one of the ACID (&quot;Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability&quot;) transaction properties. An atomic transaction is an &quot;indivisible&quot; and &quot;irreducible&quot; series of database operations such that either &quot;all&quot; occur, or &quot;none&quot; occur. A guarantee of atomicity prevents partial database updates from occurring, because they can cause greater problems than rejecting the whole series outright. As a consequence, the transaction cannot be observed to be in progress by another database client. At one moment in time, it has not yet happened, and at the next it has already occurred in whole (or nothing happened if the transaction was cancelled in progress).

An example of an atomic transaction is a monetary transfer from bank account A to account B. It consists of two operations, withdrawing the money from account A and saving it to account B. Performing these operations in an atomic transaction ensures that the database remains in a consistent state, that is, money is neither lost nor created if either of those two operations fails.

The same term is also used in the definition of First normal form in database systems, where it instead refers to the concept that the values for fields may not consist of multiple smaller values to be decomposed, such as a string into which multiple names, numbers, dates, or other types may be packed.

==Orthogonality==
Atomicity does not behave completely orthogonally with regard to the other ACID properties of transactions. For example, isolation relies on atomicity to roll back the enclosing transaction in the event of an isolation violation such as a deadlock; consistency also relies on atomicity to roll back the enclosing transaction in the event of a consistency violation by an illegal transaction.

As a result of this, a failure to detect a violation and roll back the enclosing transaction may cause an isolation or consistency failure.

==Implementation==
Typically, systems implement Atomicity by providing some mechanism to indicate which transactions have started and which finished; or by keeping a copy of the data before any changes occurred (read-copy-update). Several filesystems have developed methods for avoiding the need to keep multiple copies of data, using journaling (see journaling file system). Databases usually implement this using some form of logging/journaling to track changes. The system synchronizes the logs (often the metadata) as necessary after changes have successfully taken place. Afterwards, crash recovery ignores incomplete entries. Although implementations vary depending on factors such as concurrency issues, the principle of atomicity – i.e. complete success or complete failure – remain.

Ultimately, any application-level implementation relies on operating-system functionality. At the file-system level, POSIX-compliant systems provide system calls such as codice_1 and codice_2 that allow applications to atomically open or lock a file. At the process level, POSIX Threads provide adequate synchronization primitives.

The hardware level requires atomic operations such as Test-and-set, Fetch-and-add, Compare-and-swap, or Load-Link/Store-Conditional, together with memory barriers. Portable operating systems cannot simply block interrupts to implement synchronization, since hardware that lacks concurrent execution such as hyper-threading or multi-processing is now extremely rare.

<doc id="373996" wikidata="Q371403" url="?curid=373996" title="Kyle Gass">
<text>Kyle Richard Gass (born July 14, 1960) is an American musician, singer, actor, and comedian, best known for being a founding member of Tenacious D, a Grammy-winning comedy band. He is also a member of Trainwreck and the Kyle Gass Band.

==Early life==

Kyle Richard Gass was born in Walnut Creek, California on July 14, 1960, and he has two brothers. At 8 years old, he learned to play guitar and flute. Then at 28, he was working on his first television appearance with 7up. He attended Las Lomas High School alongside notable alumnus Greg Williams, where he played flute in the marching band, graduating in 1978. He studied acting at UCLA School of Theater, Film and Television, where he met Tim Robbins. In 1982, he joined Robbins&#x27; The Actors&#x27; Gang and in the early 1990s met and befriended Jack Black in the group.

==Career==
===Acting===
Gass first appeared on-screen in a 1988 7up Gold commercial, and made his film debut two years later in &quot;Brain Dead&quot;.

He made a cameo appearance in the Bio Dome with Jack Black&quot;Seinfeld&quot; episode &quot;The Abstinence&quot; in 1996, in a 1999 episode of the television show &quot;Fear of a Punk Planet&quot;, and in a 2003 episode of &quot;Friends, &quot;&quot;The One With The Mugging&quot; (S9 E15), as Phoebe&#x27;s street friend Lowell. He appeared in music videos for Good Charlotte&#x27;s 2002 song &quot;Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous&quot;, the Foo Fighters&#x27; 1999 song &quot;Learn to Fly&quot;, and I Prevail&#x27;s 2017 song &quot;Already Dead&quot;.

Gass has played small roles in many of Jack Black&#x27;s films (&quot;Year One&quot;, &quot;Kung Fu Panda&quot;, &quot;Shallow Hal&quot;, &quot;Saving Silverman&quot;, &quot;The Cable Guy&quot;, etc.). He starred with Jack Black in the movie &quot;Tenacious D in the Pick of Destiny&quot;.

Gass appeared in &quot;Jacob&#x27;s Ladder&quot; (1990), appeared as the &quot;couch potato&quot; in &quot;The Cable Guy&quot; (1996), and as an inept author of children&#x27;s books in the comedy &quot;Elf&quot; (2003). He had a cameo role as a singing karaoke cowboy in &quot;Wild Hogs&quot; (2007). In 2008 he played the porn director in &quot;Extreme Movie&quot;, Walrus Boy in &quot;Wieners&quot;, the dirty trucker in the men&#x27;s room in &quot;Sex Drive&quot;, and Decatur Doublewide in &quot;Lower Learning&quot;.

===Music===

In Tenacious D, Gass plays lead guitar and sings backing vocals, and also plays the role of Black&#x27;s comic foil in most of their comedy routines.

While appearing on &quot;Late Night with Conan O&#x27;Brien&quot; on November 15, 2006, Gass claimed to have been the youngest graduate of the Juilliard School of Music with a degree in classical guitar studies at the age of 13. Juilliard did not have a guitar program in 1973, but began its graduate level guitar program in 1989 under Sharon Isbin, and its undergraduate program in 2007. Earlier, in an article in the &quot;Sunday Times&quot; on October 29, 2006, Black stated that Gass was the youngest graduate of Juilliard. On May 13, 2008, Gass was a phone-in guest on the &quot;Adam Carolla Show&quot;. When Adam Carolla asked him &quot;... And did you go to Juilliard?&quot; Kyle replied &quot;I didn&#x27;t. I—you know, I made that up as a joke,&quot; he continued, &quot;and I thought it would be hilarious, and then I&#x27;ve been hearing about it ever since. Apologies to Juilliard.&quot;

In 2017, Gass performed the song &quot;Penelope&quot; for Amazon Music&#x27;s &quot;Love Me Not&quot; compilation album.

In 2021, Gass announced his first solo tour &quot;Kyle Gass Must Save the World&quot;, however it was later cancelled.

On July 16, 2024, Jack Black announced the cancellation of the ongoing Tenacious D Australian tour after Gass said &quot;Don&#x27;t miss Trump next time&quot; on stage two days earlier, referencing the attempted assassination of Donald Trump in Pennsylvania. Gass made the comment after being presented with a birthday cake for his 64th birthday and was asked by Black to &quot;make a wish&quot;. This also put all future creative plans for the band on hold. Gass apologized on social media, calling his comment &quot;highly inappropriate, dangerous and a terrible mistake&quot;, and that he did not condone violence &quot;of any kind, in any form, against anyone&quot;, and described the shooting as a &quot;tragedy&quot;. He was subsequently dropped by his longtime talent agent, Michael Greene. Gass deleted the apology two days later.

=== Other media ===
Gass starred in a web show, &quot;Guitarings&quot;, with John Konesky and currently hosts the &quot;Did We Do It&quot; podcast with Kevin Weisman.
He has appeared as a contestant on the TV game show &quot;Sale of the Century&quot;.

<doc id="373998" wikidata="Q745361" url="?curid=373998" title="Stuffing">
<text>Stuffing, filling, or dressing is an edible mixture, often composed of herbs and a starch such as bread, used to fill a cavity in the preparation of another food item. Many foods may be stuffed, including poultry, seafood, and vegetables. As a cooking technique stuffing helps retain moisture, while the mixture itself serves to augment and absorb flavors during its preparation.

Poultry stuffing often consists of breadcrumbs, onion, celery, spices, and herbs such as sage, combined with the giblets. Additions in the United Kingdom include dried fruits and nuts (such as apricots and flaked almonds), and chestnuts.

==History==

It is not known when stuffings were first used. The earliest documentary evidence is the Roman cookbook, Apicius &quot;De Re Coquinaria&quot;, which contains recipes for stuffed chicken, dormouse, hare, and pig. Most of the stuffings described consist of vegetables, herbs and spices, nuts, and spelt (a cereal), and frequently contain chopped liver, brains, and other organ meat.

Names for stuffing include &quot;farce&quot; (~1390), &quot;stuffing&quot; (1538), &quot;forcemeat&quot; (1688), and more recently in the United States, &quot;dressing&quot; (1850).

==Cavities==


In addition to stuffing the body cavities of animals, including birds, fish, and mammals, various cuts of meat may be stuffed after they have been deboned or a pouch has been cut into them. Recipes include stuffed chicken legs, stuffed pork chops, stuffed breast of veal, as well as the traditional holiday stuffed turkey or goose.

Many types of vegetables are also suitable for stuffing, after their seeds or flesh has been removed. Tomatoes, capsicums (sweet or hot peppers), and vegetable marrows such as zucchini may be prepared in this way. Cabbages and similar vegetables can also be stuffed or wrapped around a filling. They are usually blanched first, in order to make their leaves more pliable. Then the interior may be replaced by stuffing, or small amounts of stuffing may be inserted between the individual leaves.

Purportedly ancient Roman, or else Medieval, cooks developed engastration recipes, stuffing animals with other animals. An anonymous Andalusian cookbook from the 13th century includes a recipe for a ram stuffed with small birds. A similar recipe for a camel stuffed with sheep stuffed with bustards stuffed with carp stuffed with eggs is mentioned in T. C. Boyle&#x27;s book &quot;Water Music&quot;. Multi-bird-stuffed dishes such as the turducken or gooducken are contemporary variations.

==Fillers==
Almost anything can serve as a stuffing. Many American stuffings contain a starchy ingredient like bread or cereals, usually together with vegetables, ground meats, herbs and spices, and eggs. Middle Eastern vegetable stuffings may be based on seasoned rice, on minced meat, or a combination thereof. Other stuffings may contain only vegetables and herbs. Some types of stuffing contain sausage meat, or forcemeat, while vegetarian stuffings sometimes contain tofu. Roast pork is often accompanied by sage and onion stuffing in England; roast poultry in a Christmas dinner may be stuffed with sweet chestnuts. Oysters are used in one traditional stuffing for Thanksgiving. These may also be combined with mashed potatoes, for a heavy stuffing. Fruits and dried fruits can be added to stuffing including apples, apricots, dried prunes, and raisins. In England, a stuffing is sometimes made of minced pork shoulder seasoned with various ingredients, such as sage, onion, bread, chestnuts, dried apricots, and dried cranberries. The stuffing mixture may be cooked separately and served as a side dish. This may still be called stuffing or it may be called dressing.

==Food safety==
The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) states that cooking animals with a body cavity filled with stuffing can present potential food safety hazards. Even when the meat reaches a safe temperature, the stuffing can still harbor bacteria, and if the meat is cooked until the stuffing reaches a safe temperature, the meat may be overcooked. For turkeys, for instance, the USDA recommends cooking stuffing separately from the bird and not buying pre-stuffed birds.

<doc id="374002" wikidata="Q1771501" url="?curid=374002" title="Limit cardinal">
<text>In mathematics, limit cardinals are certain cardinal numbers. A cardinal number &quot;λ&quot; is a weak limit cardinal if &quot;λ&quot; is neither a successor cardinal nor zero. This means that one cannot &quot;reach&quot; &quot;λ&quot; from another cardinal by repeated successor operations. These cardinals are sometimes called simply &quot;limit cardinals&quot; when the context is clear.

A cardinal &quot;λ&quot; is a strong limit cardinal if &quot;λ&quot; cannot be reached by repeated powerset operations. This means that &quot;λ&quot; is nonzero and, for all &quot;κ&quot; &lt; &quot;λ&quot;, 2&quot;κ&quot; &lt; &quot;λ&quot;. Every strong limit cardinal is also a weak limit cardinal, because &quot;κ&quot;+ ≤ 2&quot;κ&quot; for every cardinal &quot;κ&quot;, where &quot;κ&quot;+ denotes the successor cardinal of &quot;κ&quot;.

The first infinite cardinal, formula_1 (aleph-naught), is a strong limit cardinal, and hence also a weak limit cardinal.

== Constructions ==

One way to construct limit cardinals is via the union operation: formula_2 is a weak limit cardinal, defined as the union of all the alephs before it; and in general formula_3 for any limit ordinal &quot;λ&quot; is a weak limit cardinal.

The ב operation can be used to obtain strong limit cardinals. This operation is a map from ordinals to cardinals defined as
:formula_4
:formula_5 (the smallest ordinal equinumerous with the powerset)
:If &quot;λ&quot; is a limit ordinal, formula_6
The cardinal
:formula_7
is a strong limit cardinal of cofinality ω. More generally, given any ordinal &quot;α&quot;, the cardinal
:formula_8
is a strong limit cardinal. Thus there are arbitrarily large strong limit cardinals.

== Relationship with ordinal subscripts ==

If the axiom of choice holds, every cardinal number has an initial ordinal. If that initial ordinal is formula_9 then the cardinal number is of the form formula_10 for the same ordinal subscript &quot;λ&quot;. The ordinal &quot;λ&quot; determines whether formula_10 is a weak limit cardinal. Because formula_12 if &quot;λ&quot; is a successor ordinal then formula_10 is not a weak limit. Conversely, if a cardinal &quot;κ&quot; is a successor cardinal, say formula_14 then formula_15 Thus, in general, formula_10 is a weak limit cardinal if and only if &quot;λ&quot; is zero or a limit ordinal.

Although the ordinal subscript tells us whether a cardinal is a weak limit, it does not tell us whether a cardinal is a strong limit. For example, ZFC proves that formula_17 is a weak limit cardinal, but neither proves nor disproves that formula_17 is a strong limit cardinal (Hrbacek and Jech 1999:168). The generalized continuum hypothesis states that formula_19 for every infinite cardinal &quot;κ&quot;. Under this hypothesis, the notions of weak and strong limit cardinals coincide.

== The notion of inaccessibility and large cardinals ==

The preceding defines a notion of &quot;inaccessibility&quot;: we are dealing with cases where it is no longer enough to do finitely many iterations of the successor and powerset operations; hence the phrase &quot;cannot be reached&quot; in both of the intuitive definitions above. But the &quot;union operation&quot; always provides another way of &quot;accessing&quot; these cardinals (and indeed, such is the case of limit ordinals as well). Stronger notions of inaccessibility can be defined using cofinality. For a weak (respectively strong) limit cardinal &quot;κ&quot; the requirement is that cf(&quot;κ&quot;) = &quot;κ&quot; (i.e. &quot;κ&quot; be regular) so that &quot;κ&quot; cannot be expressed as a sum (union) of fewer than &quot;κ&quot; smaller cardinals. Such a cardinal is called a weakly (respectively strongly) inaccessible cardinal. The preceding examples both are singular cardinals of cofinality ω and hence they are not inaccessible.

formula_1 would be an inaccessible cardinal of both &quot;strengths&quot; except that the definition of inaccessible requires that they be uncountable. Standard Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory with the axiom of choice (ZFC) cannot even prove the consistency of the existence of an inaccessible cardinal of either kind above formula_1, due to Gödel&#x27;s incompleteness theorem. More specifically, if formula_22 is weakly inaccessible then formula_23. These form the first in a hierarchy of large cardinals.

<text>Diversity training is a type of corporate training designed to facilitate positive intergroup interaction, reduce prejudice and discrimination, and teach different individuals how to work together effectively.

Diversity training is often aimed to meet objectives such as attracting and retaining customers and productive workers; maintaining high employee morale; and fostering understanding and harmony between workers.

Despite intended benefits, systematic studies have not proven benefits to diversity training. While some studies show that voluntary diversity training can lead to more diverse management, other studies have found that mandatory diversity training can lead to increased discrimination and prejudice.

As of 2019, more than $8 billion a year is spent on diversity training in the United States.

== History ==

=== 1960s ===
In the 1960s, the concept of promoting diversity in the workplace was prompted as a result of the civil rights movement. The Civil Rights Act of 1964, enacted by the 88th US Congress, made it illegal for employers with more than 15 workers to discriminate against employees and candidates based on race, color, religion, sex, or national origin. Discrimination on the basis of pregnancy, age, and disability was also later outlawed. After the Act was passed, activists protested organizations who refused to hire blacks, planned jobs banks, and filed charges against employers that discriminated against employees.

=== 1970s ===
The United States Supreme Court extended the definition of discrimination in 1971 in &quot;Griggs v. Duke Power Co.&quot;, ruling against employment practices that ostracized black employees without evidence of intent to discriminate. The civil rights movement helped to recreate its momentum for a new round of movements in the 1970s for the rights of women, the disabled, Latinos, and others. With shifts in societal and legal reforms, federal agencies took the first step towards modern day diversity training, and by the end of 1971, the Social Security Administration had enrolled over 50,000 employees through racial bias training. Corporations followed suit and, over the next five years, began offering anti-bias training to their employees. By 1976, 60 percent of large companies offered equal-opportunity training. Many of these corporations implemented such training programs as a way to protect themselves from discrimination lawsuits.

=== 1980s to present ===
In the 1980s, President Ronald Reagan tried to reverse affirmative action regulations put forward by former president John F. Kennedy and appointed Clarence Thomas to run the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. As a result, diversity trainers in the U.S. began calling for diversity training, arguing that women and minorities would soon be the backbone of the workforce and that companies needed to determine how to include them amongst their ranks. By 2005, 65 percent of large corporations offered their employees some form of diversity training.

Promoting respect and appealing to minority employees and customers became significant goals of diversity training starting in the late 1980s. In the early 2000s, an expansion of diversity training was prompted by a series of high-profile discrimination lawsuits in the financial industry.

== Impact ==
Findings on diversity trainings are mixed. According to Harvard University sociologist Frank Dobbin, there is no evidence to indicate that anti-bias training leads to increases in the number of women or people of color in management positions. A 2009 &quot;Annual Review of Psychology&quot; study concluded, &quot;We currently do not know whether a wide range of programs and policies tend to work on average,&quot; with the authors of the study stating in 2020 that as the quality of studies increases, the effect size of anti-bias training dwindles.

According to a 2006 study in the &quot;American Sociological Review&quot;, &quot;diversity training and diversity evaluations are least effective at increasing the share of white women, black women, and black men in management.&quot; A meta-analysis suggests that diversity training could have a relatively large effect on cognitive-based and skill-based training outcomes. An analysis of data from over 800 firms over 30 years shows that diversity training and grievance procedures backfire and lead to reductions in the diversity of the firms&#x27; workforce. A 2013 study found that the presence of a diversity program in a workplace made high-status subjects less likely to take discrimination complaints seriously.

Alexandra Kalev and Frank Dobbin conducted a comprehensive review of cultural diversity training conducted in 830 midsize to large U.S. workplaces over a thirty one-year period. The results showed that diversity training was followed by a decrease of anywhere from 7.5 to 10% in the number of women in management. The percentage of black men in top positions fell by 12 percent. Similar effects were shown for Latinos and Asians. The study did not find that all diversity training is ineffective. Mandatory training programs offered to protect against discrimination lawsuits were called into question. Voluntary diversity training participation to advance organization&#x27;s business goals was associated with increased diversity at the management level; voluntary services resulted in near triple digit increases for black, Hispanic, and Asian men.

A 2021 meta-analysis found a lack of high quality studies on the efficacy of diversity training. The researchers concluded that &quot;while the small number of experimental studies provide encouraging average effects... the effects shrink when the trainings are conducted in real-world workplace settings, when the outcomes are measured at a greater time distance than immediately following the intervention, and, most importantly, when the sample size is large enough to produce reliable results.&quot;

A 2013 study found that white men were less likely to think a complaint of discrimination by an employee was accurate when they were told that the employer used diversity training, even when they were presented with evidence of discrimination. Several studies of the results of discrimination lawsuits in the United States have found that official diversity structures, including diversity training, have increasingly been accepted by judges as evidence of a lack of discrimination regardless of their effectiveness. According to Nakamura &amp; Edelman&#x27;s summary of corporate diversity policies, &quot;[i]n the twenty-first century, diversity commitments and policies are standard and firms that lack such structures look suspect.&quot;

<doc id="374010" wikidata="Q128347" url="?curid=374010" title="Flag of Pakistan">
<text>The national flag of Pakistan, also known as the Flag of the Star and Crescent (), is made up of a green field with a stylized tilted white descending crescent moon and five-pointed star at its centre, and a vertical white stripe at its hoist-end. Though the specific shade of green on the flag is mandated only as &#x27;dark green&#x27;, its official and most consistent representation is in Pakistan green, which is shaded distinctively darker. It was adopted by the Constituent Assembly of Pakistan on 11 August 1947, and it became the official flag of the Dominion of Pakistan on 14 August 1947, following independence from the British Empire. The flag was subsequently retained as that of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan in 1956 and remains in use as the national flag to this day.

Most notably, the flag is referred to in the third verse of Pakistan&#x27;s national anthem, and is widely flown on several important days of the year, including Republic Day, Independence Day and Defence Day. It is also hoisted every morning at schools, offices and government buildings to the playing of the national anthem and lowered again before sunset. A very elaborate flag-raising and lowering ceremony is carried out every evening by the Pakistan Rangers and their Indian Border Security Force counterparts at the Wagah–Attari border crossing between India and Pakistan, which is regularly attended by hundreds of spectators. The Government of Pakistan has formalized rules and regulations related to the flying of the national flag; it is to be displayed all day at full-mast on 23 March annually to commemorate the adoption of the Lahore Resolution in 1940 and the declaration of Pakistan as an independent Islamic republic with a constitution in 1956, both of which occurred on the same day. The same regulations also apply on 14 August annually, in celebration of Pakistan&#x27;s day of independence; when the country was carved out from erstwhile British India as the homeland and nation-state for the Muslims of the Indian subcontinent.

==History==

In 1942, the Pakistan National Movement published a pamphlet, &quot;The Millat of Islam and the menace of &#x27;Indianism&#x27;&quot;, by the founder of the Pakistan Movement, Choudhry Rahmat Ali, depicting on its cover a flag of a proposed Pakistan with a thin white crescent and five white stars on a green field. A graphic illustration of Ali&#x27;s flag in a critical work from 1946 more clearly portrays the stars in a pentagonal arrangement. Each star apparently represented a constituent nation of the proposed state: Punjab, Afghania (NWF), Kashmir, Sindh, and Balochistan. Ali also apparently designed a flag for an envisioned association of independent Muslim states distributed across South Asia, a &#x27;Pak Commonwealth of Nations&#x27;. This flag featured a smaller crescent and ten stars.

The design eventually adopted as the Flag of Pakistan was based on the flag of the Muslim League. In 1937, the Muslim League began using a solid green banner charged with white descending crescent and star. In the early 1920s, during the era of the Khilafat Movement, Muslims had begun using a green banner with crescent and star, but as a religious rather than national symbol. By the 1930s, Muslims in India had become leery of the acceptance of the tricolor flag of the Congress Party as the national flag of India, in significant part because the discourses and rituals of hoisting the flag invoked explicitly Hindu religious themes. In 1940, Muhammad Ali Jinnah, leader of the Muslim League and future founder of the state of Pakistan, declared the League&#x27;s flag the &#x27;national flag of Muslim India&#x27;. By 1944, Muhammad Ali Jinnah was publicly declaring that they intended it to be the flag of Pakistan. This would become the flag of Pakistan, albeit charged with a white heraldic side or flank at the hoist. The resulting flag bears a striking resemblance to the various iterations of the Saudi flag from 1744 to 1937 which featured a white heraldic side or flank at the hoist and a green field charged with white calligraphic text (the &quot;Shahada&quot;).

In 1947, the Viceroy of India, Louis Mountbatten, proposed a national flag for the state of Pakistan which comprised the flag of the All-India Muslim League albeit with a Union Jack in the canton. This proposal was rejected by Muhammad Ali Jinnah on the grounds that a flag featuring both Saint George&#x27;s Christian Cross alongside an Islamic star and crescent would not be accepted by the Pakistani people.

A team led by Syed Amir-uddin Kedwaii created the design that would ultimately be approved as the national flag. It was officially adopted by the Constituent Assembly of Pakistan on August 11, 1947, a few days before Pakistan gained its independence from British rule. Upon independence it became the flag of, first, the Dominion of Pakistan and then from 23 March 1956 that of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan. The design remains unchanged since its initial adoption.

==Symbolism==
The Islamic green of the flag represents the Muslim-majority populace of Pakistan while the white stripe on the hoist-end represents its various religious minorities i.e. Non-Muslims, such as Hindus, Christians, Sikhs, Zoroastrians and others. The combined star and crescent serve as a symbol of Islam, with the crescent representing progress and the five-pointed star representing light and knowledge. The flag symbolizes Pakistan&#x27;s commitment to both Islam as well as the rights of religious minorities.

The Pakistan Flag is based on the original flag of the Muslim League, which itself drew inspiration from the flag of the Ottoman Empire.

==Design==
The official design of the national flag was adopted by the Constituent Assembly together with a definition of the features and proportions.

According to the specifications, it is a dark green rectangular flag in the proportion of length [A] and width [B] as 3:2 with a white vertical bar at the mast, the green portion bearing a white crescent in the centre and a five-pointed white heraldic star. The width of the white portion [C] is one quarter the length of the flag [A], nearest the mast, so the green portion occupies the remaining three quarters [D].
Draw a diagonal L3 from the top right-hand corner to the bottom left corner of the green portion. On this diagonal establish two points P1 and P2. P1 is positioned at the centre of the green portion and P2 at the intersection of the diagonal L3 and an arc C4 created from the top right-hand corner equal to 13/20 the height of the flag [E]. With the centre at point P1 and a radius 3/10 the height of the flag describe the first circle C1 and with the centre at point P2 and a radius 11/40 the height of the flag describe a second circle C2. The enclosures made by these two circles form the crescent. The dimensions of the five-pointed white heraldic star are determined by drawing a circle C3 with a radius 1/10 the height of the flag positioned between P2 and P3 on the diagonal L3. The circle surrounds the five points of the heraldic star and the star lies with one point on the diagonal L3 at point P3 where circle C1 intersects the diagonal L3.
The flag is coloured in Pakistan green having standard RGB values (red = 0, green = 64, blue = 26) or with hex triplet #00401A or the HSV value = (h = 144, s = 100, v = 25). The left strip, the star and the crescent are painted in white. The flag is supported from left white side.

===Dimensions===
The Interior Ministry of Pakistan provides dimensions for flags in different circumstances:
* For ceremonial occasions: 24′ × 16′, 21′ × 14′, 18′ × 12′, 11′ × ′ or 9′ × ′.
* For use over buildings: 6′ × 4′ or 3′ × 2′.
* For cars: 24″ × 16″.
* For tables: ″ × ″.

==Flag flying days==
==Use by public officials==
The use of the national flag is regulated by the Pakistan Flag Rules, which were introduced in 2002 by Prime Minister Zafarullah Khan Jamali. The rules are not available online but there have been instances of misuse such as officials using flags on their vehicles when they are not entitled to do so. The national flag is flown on the official residences and vehicles (cars, boats, planes) of the following public officials:

<text>Mian Muhammad Nawaz Sharif (born 25 December 1949) is a Pakistani politician and businessman who served as the 12th prime minister of Pakistan for three non-consecutive terms, first serving from 1990 to 1993, then from 1997 to 1999 and later from 2013 to 2017. He is the longest-serving prime minister of Pakistan, having served a total of more than 9 years across three tenures. Each term has ended in his ousting.

Born into the upper-middle-class Sharif family in Lahore, Nawaz is the son of Muhammad Sharif, the founder of Ittefaq and Sharif groups. Nawaz studied business at Government College and law at the University of Punjab. Nawaz entered into politics in 1981, when he was appointed by President Zia as the minister of finance for the province of Punjab. Backed by a loose coalition of conservatives, Nawaz was elected as the chief minister of Punjab in 1985 and re-elected after the end of martial law in 1988. 

In 1990, Nawaz led the conservative Islamic Democratic Alliance and became the 12th prime minister of Pakistan. After being ousted in 1993, when President Ghulam Ishaq Khan dissolved the National Assembly, Nawaz served as the leader of the opposition to the government of Benazir Bhutto from 1993 to 1996. He returned to the premiership after the Pakistan Muslim League (N) (PML-N) was elected in 1997, and served until his removal in 1999 by military takeover and was tried in a plane hijacking case. 

After being imprisoned and later exiled for more than a decade, he returned to politics in 2011 and led his party to victory for the third time in 2013. In 2017, Nawaz was again removed from office by the Supreme Court of Pakistan following the Panama Papers case. In 2018, the Pakistani Supreme Court disqualified Nawaz from holding public office, and he was also sentenced to ten years in prison by an accountability court. In 2019, he moved to London for medical treatment on bail. He was also declared an absconder by a Pakistani court, however, the Islamabad High Court later granted him protective bail in the Avenfield and Al-Aziza cases. In 2023, after four years of exile, he returned to Pakistan and was subsequently acquitted in the Avenfield and Al-Azizia Steel Mills cases by the IHC.

==Early life and education==

Nawaz was born in Lahore, Punjab, on 25 December 1949. The Sharif family are Punjabi-speaking Kashmiris. His father, Muhammad Sharif, was an upper-middle-class businessman and industrialist whose family had emigrated from Anantnag in Kashmir for business. They settled in the village of Jati Umra in Amritsar district, Punjab, at the beginning of the twentieth century. His mother&#x27;s family came from Pulwama. After the creation of Pakistan in 1947, Nawaz&#x27;s parents migrated from Amritsar to Lahore. His father followed the teachings of the Ahl-i Hadith. His family owns Ittefaq Group, a multimillion-dollar steel conglomerate, and Sharif Group, a conglomerate with holdings in agriculture, transport and sugar mills. He has two younger brothers: Shehbaz Sharif and the late Abbas Sharif, both politicians by profession.

Nawaz went to Saint Anthony High School. He graduated from the Government College University (GCU) with an art and business degree and then received a law degree from the Law College of Punjab University in Lahore.

Nawaz was a cricketer in his early years, playing as an opening batsman. Peter Oborne noted that he had success at club level and that &quot;he was proud of his first-class record&quot;, having been part of the highly rated Pakistan Railways team in 1973–1974. Years later, when he was a well-known politician, he&#x27;d play in warm-up matches, for Lahore Gymkhana against England and as temporary captain of the national team against the West Indies, both just before the 1987 World Cup. Due to the West Indies match he&#x27;d surprise Imran Khan, then the regular captain, because Nawaz opened the innings with minimal protection against one of the most feared fast bowling attack.

Nawaz Sharif&#x27;s wife Kulsoom had two sisters and a brother. From her maternal side, she was the maternal granddaughter of the wrestler The Great Gama (Ghulam Mohammad Baksh Butt). She married Nawaz Sharif in April 1970. The couple have four children: Maryam, Asma, Hassan and Hussain.

==Provincial politics==
===Early political career===
Nawaz suffered financial losses when his family&#x27;s steel business was appropriated under the nationalisation policies of former prime minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto. Nawaz entered politics as a result, initially focused on regaining control of the steel plants. Nawaz Sharif joined Asghar Khan&#x27;s Tehreek-e-Istiqlal in the late 1970s before he was selected by General Zia-Ul-Haq, one of his admirers, as Finance Minister of Punjab. In 1976, Nawaz joined the Pakistan Muslim League (PML), a conservative front rooted in the Punjab province.

In May 1980, Ghulam Jilani Khan, the recently appointed military governor of Punjab and a former Director-General of the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI), was seeking new urban leaders; he quickly promoted Nawaz, making him finance minister. In 1981, Nawaz joined the Punjab Advisory Council under Khan.

During the 1980s, Nawaz gained influence as a supporter of General Zia-ul-Haq&#x27;s military government. Zia-ul-Haq agreed to return the steel industry to Nawaz, who convinced the general to denationalise and deregulate industries to improve the economy. Within Punjab, Nawaz privatised government-owned industries and presented development-oriented budgets to the military government. These policies raised financial capital and helped increase the standard of living and purchasing power in the province, which in turn improved law and order and extended Khan&#x27;s rule. Punjab was the richest province and received more federal funding than the other provinces of Pakistan, contributing to economical inequality.

Nawaz invested his wealth in Saudi Arabia and other oil-rich Arab countries to rebuild his steel empire. According to personal accounts and his time spent with Nawaz, American historian Stephen P. Cohen states in his 2004 book &quot;Idea of Pakistan&quot;: &quot;Nawaz Sharif never forgave Bhutto after his steel empire was lost [...] even after [Bhutto&#x27;s] terrible end, Nawaz publicly refused to forgive the soul of Bhutto or the Pakistan Peoples Party.&quot;

===Chief Minister of Punjab===
In 1985, Khan nominated Nawaz as Chief Minister of Punjab, against the wishes of Prime Minister Muhammad Khan Junejo. With the backing of the army, Nawaz secured a landslide victory in the 1985 elections. Because of his popularity, he received the nickname &quot;Lion of the Punjab&quot;. Nawaz built ties with the senior army generals who sponsored his government. He maintained an alliance with General Rahimuddin Khan, Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee. Nawaz also had close ties with Lieutenant-General (retired) Hamid Gul, the Director-General of ISI.

As chief minister, Nawaz stressed welfare and development activities and the maintenance of law and order. Khan beautified Lahore, extended military infrastructure, and silenced political opposition, while Nawaz expanded economic infrastructure to benefit the army, his own business interests, and the people of Punjab. In 1988, General Zia dismissed the government of Junejo and called for new elections. However, Zia retained Nawaz as the Chief Minister of Punjab, and until his death, continued to support Nawaz.

===1988 elections===

After General Zia&#x27;s death in August 1988, his political party – Pakistan Muslim League (Pagara Group) – split into two factions. Nawaz led the Zia-loyalist Fida Group against the Prime Minister&#x27;s Junejo&#x27;s Pakistan Muslim League (J). The Fida Group later took on the mantle of the PML while the Junejo Group became known as the JIP. The two parties along with seven other right-wing conservative and religious parties united with encouragement and funding from the ISI to form the Islami Jamhoori Ittehad (IJI). (The IJI received  million from Zia loyalists in the ISI, with a substantial role played by Nawaz&#x27;s ally Gul.) The alliance was led by Nawaz and Ghulam Mustafa Jatoi and opposed Benazir Bhutto&#x27;s Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) in the elections. The IJI gained a majority in Punjab, and Nawaz was re-elected as the chief minister.

In December 1989, Nawaz decided to remain in the provincial Punjab Assembly rather than hold a seat in the National Assembly. In early 1989, the PPP government attempted to unseat Nawaz through a no-confidence motion in the Punjab Assembly, which they lost by a vote of 152 to 106.

== National politics ==

=== First term as prime minister (1990–1993) ===

The conservatives first came to power in a democratic Pakistan under Nawaz&#x27;s leadership. Nawaz Sharif became the 12th prime minister of Pakistan on 1 November 1990, succeeding Benazir Bhutto. He also became head of IJI. Sharif had a majority in the assembly and ruled with considerable confidence, having disputes with three successive army chiefs.

Nawaz had campaigned on a conservative platform and vowed to reduce government corruption. Nawaz introduced an economy based on privatisation and economic liberalisation to reverse the nationalisation by Zulfikar Bhutto, notably for banks and industries. He legalised foreign money exchange to be transacted through private money exchangers. His privatisation policies were continued by both Benazir Bhutto in the mid-1990s and Shaukat Aziz in the 2000s. He also improved the nation&#x27;s infrastructure and spurred the growth of digital telecommunication.

==== Conservative policies ====

Nawaz continued the simultaneous Islamization and conservatism of Pakistan society, a policy begun by Zia. Reforms were made to introduce fiscal conservatism, supply-side economics, bioconservatism and religious conservatism in Pakistan.

Nawaz intensified Zia&#x27;s controversial Islamization policies, and introduced Islamic laws such as the Shariat Ordinance and Bait-ul-Maal (to help poor orphans, widows, etc.) to drive the country on the model of an Islamic welfare state. Moreover, he gave tasks to the Ministry of Religion to prepare reports and recommendations for steps taken toward Islamization. He ensured the establishment of three committees:
* Ittehad-e-bain-ul-Muslemeen ()
* Nifaz-e-Shariat Committee ()
* Islamic Welfare Committee

Nawaz extended membership of the Economic Cooperation Organization (ECO) to all Central Asian countries to unite them into a Muslim bloc. Nawaz included environmentalism in his government platform, and established the Pakistan Environmental Protection Agency in 1997.

==== Conflicts ====

Following the imposition and passing of Resolution 660, 661, and 665, Nawaz sided with the United Nations on the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait. Nawaz&#x27;s government criticised Iraq for invading the fellow Muslim country, which strained Pakistan&#x27;s relationships with Iraq. This continued as Pakistan sought to strengthen its relations with Iran. This policy continued under Benazir Bhutto and Pervez Musharraf until the removal of Saddam Hussein in 2003. Nawaz raised the issue of Kashmir in international forums and worked toward a peaceful transfer of power in Afghanistan to curb the rampant trading of illicit drugs and weapons across the border.

Nawaz challenged former Chief of Army Staff General Mirza Aslam Beg over the 1991 Gulf War. Under the direction of Beg, Pakistan Armed Forces participated in Operation Desert Storm and the Army Special Service Group and the Naval Special Service Group were deployed to Saudi Arabia to provide security for the Saudi royal family.

Nawaz faced difficulty working with the PPP and the Mutahidda Qaumi Movement (MQM), a potent force in Karachi. The MQM and the PPP opposed Nawaz due to his focus on beautifying Punjab and Kashmir while neglecting Sindh, and the MQM also opposed Nawaz&#x27;s conservatism. Although the MQM had formed the government with Nawaz, the political tensions between liberalism and conservatism erupted into conflict by renegade factions in 1992.

To end the fighting between PML-N and MQM, Nawaz&#x27;s party passed a resolution to launch a paramilitary operation under command of Chief of Army Staff General Asif Nawaz Janjua. Violence erupted in Karachi in 1992 and brought the economy to a halt. During this time, Benazir Bhutto and the centre-left PPP remained neutral, but her brother Murtaza Bhutto exerted pressure which suspended the operation. The period of 1992–1994 is considered the bloodiest in the history of the city, with many people missing.

==== Industrialization and privatisation ====
Nawaz had campaigned on a conservative platform and after assuming office announced his economic policy under the National Economic Reconstruction Programme (NERP). This programme introduced an extreme level of the Western-styled capitalist economics.

Unemployment had limited Pakistan&#x27;s economic growth and Nawaz believed that only privatisation could solve this problem. Nawaz introduced an economy based on privatisation and economic liberalisation, notably for banks and industries. According to the US Department of State, this followed a vision of &quot;turning Pakistan into a [South] Korea by encouraging greater private saving and investment to accelerate economic growth.&quot;

The privatisation programme reversed the nationalisation by Zulfikar Ali Bhutto and the PPP in the 1970s. By 1993, around 115 nationalised industries were opened to private ownership, including the National Development Finance Corporation, Pakistan National Shipping Corporation, National Electric Power Regulatory Authority, Pakistan International Airlines (PIA), Pakistan Telecommunication Corporation, and Pakistan State Oil. This boosted the economy but a lack of competition in bidding allowed the rise of business oligarchs and further widened the wealth gap, contributing to political instability. Former science advisor Dr. Mubashir Hassan called Nawaz&#x27;s privatisation &quot;unconstitutional&quot;. The PPP held that nationalisation policy was given constitutional status by parliament, and that privatisation policies were illegal and had taken place without parliamentary approval.

Nawaz initiated several large-scale projects to stimulate the economy, such as the Ghazi-Barotha Hydropower Project. However, unemployment remained a challenge. In an attempt to counter this, Nawaz imported thousands of privatised Yellow-cab taxis for young Pakistanis, but few of the loans were repaid and Nawaz was forced to pay for them through his steel industry. Nawaz&#x27;s projects were not evenly distributed, focusing on Punjab and Kashmir Provinces, the base of his support, with lesser efforts in Khyber and Balochistan provinces, and no benefits from industrialization in Sindh Province. After intense criticism from the PPP and MQM, Nawaz completed the Orangi Cottage Industrial Zone but this did not repair his reputation in Sindh. Opponents accused Nawaz of using political influence to build factories for himself and his business, for expanding the Armed Forces&#x27; secretive industrial conglomerate and bribing generals.

==== Science policy ====

While privatising industry, Nawaz took steps for intense government control of science in Pakistan, and placed projects under his authorisation. In 1991, Nawaz founded and authorised the Pakistan Antarctic Programme under the scientific directions of National Institute of Oceanography (NIO), with the Pakistan Navy&#x27;s Weapons Engineering Division, and first established the Jinnah Antarctic Station and Polar Research Cell. In 1992, Pakistan became an associate member of the Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research.

On 28 July 1997, Nawaz declared 1997 a year of science in Pakistan and personally allotted funds for the 22nd INSC College on Theoretical Physics. In 1999, Nawaz signed the executive decree, declaring 28 May as the National Science Day in Pakistan.

==== Nuclear policy ====
Nawaz made the nuclear weapons and energy programme one of his top priorities. He expanded the nuclear energy program, and continued an atomic programme while following a policy of deliberate nuclear ambiguity.

This resulted in a nuclear crisis with the United States which tightened its embargo on Pakistan in December 1990 and reportedly offered substantial economic aid to halt the country&#x27;s uranium enrichment programme. Responding to US embargo, Nawaz announced that Pakistan had no atomic bomb, and would sign the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty if India did as well. The embargo blocked plans for a French-built nuclear power plant, so Nawaz&#x27;s advisors intensively lobbied the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), which allowed China to establish CHASNUPP-I nuclear power plant and upgrade KANUPP-I.

Nawaz&#x27;s nuclear policy was considered less aggressive towards India with its focus on public usage through nuclear power and medicine, viewed as a continuation of the US Atoms for Peace programme. In 1993, Nawaz established the Institute of Nuclear Engineering (INE) to promote his policy for the peaceful use of nuclear energy.

==== Co-operatives societies scandal ====
Nawaz suffered a major loss of political support from the co-operatives societies scandal. These societies accept deposits from members and can legally make loans only to members for purposes to the benefit of the membership. However, mismanagement led to a collapse affecting millions of Pakistanis in 1992. In Punjab and Kashmir, around 700,000 people lost their savings, and it was discovered that billions of rupees had been granted to the Ittefaq Group of Industries – Nawaz&#x27;s steel mill. Although the loans were hurriedly repaid, Nawaz&#x27;s reputation was severely damaged.

==== Constitutional crisis and resignation ====
Nawaz had developed serious issues of authority with conservative President Ghulam Ishaq Khan, who had raised Nawaz to prominence during the Zia dictatorship. On 18 April, ahead of the 1993 Parliamentary election, Khan used his reserve powers (58-2b) to dissolve the National Assembly, and with the support of the army appointed Mir Balakh Sher as interim prime minister. Nawaz refused to accept this act and raised a challenge at the Supreme Court of Pakistan. On 26 May, the Supreme Court ruled 10–1 that the presidential order was unconstitutional, that the president could dissolve the assembly only if a constitutional breakdown had occurred and that the government&#x27;s incompetence or corruption was irrelevant. (Justice Sajjad Ali Shah was the only dissenting judge; he later became 13th Chief Justice of Pakistan.)

Issues of authority continued. In July 1993, under pressure from the armed forces, Nawaz resigned under an agreement that also removed President Khan from power. Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee General Shamim Allam and the Chief of Army Staff General Abdul Vahied Kakar forced Khan to resign from the presidency and ended the political standoff. Under the close scrutiny of the Pakistan Armed Forces, an interim and transitional government was formed and new parliamentary election was held after three months.

=== Parliamentary opposition (1993–1996) ===

Following 1993 elections, the PPP returned to power under Benazir Bhutto. Nawaz offered his full co-operation as Leader of the Opposition but soon the PPP and PML-N held parliament locked in dispute. Bhutto found it difficult to act effectively in the face of opposition from Nawaz, and also faced problems in her political stronghold of Sindh Province from her younger brother Murtaza Bhutto.

Nawaz and Murtaza Bhutto formed the Nawaz-Bhutto axis and worked to undermine Benazir Bhutto&#x27;s government, tapping an anti-corruption wave in Pakistan. They accused the government of corruption with major state corporations and slowing economic progress. In 1994 and 1995 they made a &quot;train march&quot; from Karachi to Peshawar, making critical speeches to huge crowds. Nawaz organised strikes throughout Pakistan in September and October 1994. The death of Murtaza Bhutto in 1996, which allegedly involved Benazir&#x27;s spouse, led to demonstrations in Sindh and the government lost control of the province. Benazir Bhutto became widely unpopular across the country and was ousted in October 1996.

=== Second term as prime minister (1997–1999) ===

By 1996, continuous large-scale corruption by the government of Benazir Bhutto had deteriorated the country&#x27;s economy, which was nearing failure. In the 1997 parliamentary elections, Nawaz and the PML-N won an overwhelming victory, with an exclusive mandate from across Pakistan. It was hoped that Nawaz would deliver on promises to provide a stable conservative government and improve overall conditions. Nawaz was sworn as prime minister on 17 February.

Nawaz had formed an alliance with Altaf Hussain of the MQM which fell apart following the assassination of Hakim Said. Nawaz then removed the MQM from parliament and assumed control of Karachi while MQM was forced underground. This led Nawaz to claim an exclusive mandate, and for the first time Nawaz and the PML-N had the control of Sindh, Balochistan, Northwest Frontier, Kashmir and Punjab. With a supermajority, Nawaz&#x27;s new government amended the constitution to restrict the powers of the president to dismiss governments. With the passing of the 14th amendment, Nawaz emerged as the most powerful elected prime minister in the country.

Nawaz&#x27;s popularity peaked in May 1998 after conducting the country&#x27;s first nuclear weapons tests in response to tests by India. When Western countries suspended foreign aid, Nawaz froze the country&#x27;s foreign currency reserves and economic conditions worsened. The country became embroiled in conflicts on two borders and Nawaz&#x27;s long-standing relationships with the military establishment fell apart, so that by mid-1999 few approved of his policies.

==== Atomic policy ====
During the 1997 elections, Nawaz promised to follow his policy of nuclear ambiguity while using nuclear energy to stimulate the economy. However, on 7 September, before a state visit to the US, Nawaz acknowledged in a STN News interview that the country had had an atomic bomb since 1978. Nawaz maintained that:

On 1 December, Nawaz told the &quot;Daily Jang&quot; and &quot;The News International&quot; that Pakistan would immediately become a party of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT) if India signed and ratified it first. Under his leadership, the nuclear program had become a vital part of Pakistan&#x27;s economic policy.

==== 1998 nuclear crisis ====
In May 1998, soon after Indian nuclear tests, Nawaz vowed that his country would make a suitable reply. On 14 May, Leader of the Opposition Benazir Bhutto and MQM called for nuclear tests, followed by calls from the public. When India tested its nuclear weapons the second time, it caused a great alarm in Pakistan and pressure mounted on Nawaz. On 15 May, Nawaz put the armed forces on high-alert and called a National Security Council meeting, discussing the financial, diplomatic, military, strategic and national security concerns. Only Treasure Minister Sartaj Aziz opposed the tests, due to the economic recession, low foreign exchange reserves, and economic sanctions.

Nawaz was initially hesitant of the economic impact of nuclear testing,
and observed the international reaction to India&#x27;s tests, where an embargo had no economic effect. Failure to conduct the tests would put the credibility of Pakistan&#x27;s nuclear deterrence in doubt, which was emphasized when Indian Home Minister Lal Kishanchand Advani and Defence Minister George Fernandes gloated and belittled Pakistan, angering Nawaz.

On 18 May, Nawaz ordered the Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission (PAEC) to make preparation for the tests, and put military forces on high alert to provide support. On 21 May, Nawaz authorised nuclear weapon tests in Balochistan.

On 27 May, the day before testing, the ISI detected Israeli F-16 fighters conducting exercises and received intelligence that they had orders to attack Pakistan&#x27;s nuclear facilities on behalf of India. Nawaz scrambled the Pakistan Air Force and had nuclear bombs prepared for deployment. According to political scientist Shafik H. Hashmi, the US and other nations assured Nawaz that Pakistan was safe; the Israeli attack never materialized.

On 28 and 30 May 1998, Pakistan successfully carried out its nuclear tests, codenamed Chagai-I and Chagai-II. Following these test, Nawaz appeared on national television and stated:

Nawaz&#x27;s political prestige reached its peak when the country went nuclear. Despite the intense international criticism and decline in foreign investment and trade, Nawaz&#x27;s domestic popularity increased, as the tests made Pakistan the first Muslim country and seventh nation to become a nuclear power. Editorials were full of praise for the country&#x27;s leadership and advocated the development of nuclear deterrence. Leader of the Opposition Benazir Bhutto congratulated Nawaz for his &quot;bold decision&quot; in spite of the economic outcomes, and felt that the tests erased doubts and fears which troubled the nation since the Indo-Pakistani war of 1971. In India, opposition leaders in parliament blamed the government for starting a nuclear arms race. Nawaz was awarded an Ig Nobel prize for his &quot;aggressively peaceful explosions of atomic bombs&quot;.

==== Economic policy ====
Nawaz built Pakistan&#x27;s first major motorway, the M2 Motorway (3MM), called the Autobahn of South Asia. This public-private project was completed in November 1997 at a cost of US$989.12 million. His critics questioned the layout of the highway, its excessive length, its distance from important cities, and the absence of link roads with important towns. It also appropriated funds designated for the Peshawar–Karachi Indus Highway, benefiting Punjab and Kashmir at the cost of other provinces. There was particular dissatisfaction in Sindh and Balochistan Provinces, and Nawaz faced a lack of capital investment to finance additional projects. Nawaz loosened foreign exchange restrictions and opened Karachi Stock Exchange to foreign capital, but the government remained short of funds for investments.

Due to economic pressures, Nawaz halted the national space programme. This forced the Space Research Commission to delay the launch of its satellite, Badr-II(B), which was completed in 1997. This caused frustration among the scientific community who criticised Nawaz&#x27;s inability to promote science. Senior scientists and engineers attributed this to &quot;Nawaz&#x27;s personal corruption&quot; that affected national security.

By the end of Nawaz&#x27;s second term, the economy was in turmoil. The government faced serious structural issues and financial problems; inflation and foreign debt stood at an all-time high, and unemployment in Pakistan had reached its highest point. Pakistan had debts of US$32bn against reserves of little more than $1bn. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) had suspended aid, demanding the country&#x27;s finances be resolved. Nawaz continued to meddle with the stock exchange markets with devastating effects. By the time he was deposed, the country was heading for financial default.

&quot;The Express Tribune&quot; claimed on 20 April 2015 that Sharif&#x27;s administration misled the International Monetary Fund (IMF) over the tax charged on the issuance of bonus shares, as what should have been the largest source of income tax stood at a mere  billion. The government had told the IMF that it levied a 10% tax, which would generate revenue equal to 0.1% of or  billion.

==== Foreign policy ====
Nawaz strengthened Pakistan&#x27;s relations with the Muslim world and Europe.

In February 1997, Nawaz met with Chinese President Jiang Zemin and Premier Li Peng to discuss economic cooperation. Two conferences were organised in Beijing and Hong Kong to promote Chinese investment in Pakistan.

In 1997, Nawaz signed a trilateral free trade agreement with Malaysia and Singapore, which was followed by collaboration in defence. One of the core issues was Malaysia&#x27;s agreement on sharing its space technology with Pakistan. Both Malaysia and Singapore assured their support for Pakistan to join Asia–Europe Meeting, though Pakistan and India were not parties to the treaty until 2008.
In January 1998, Nawaz signed bilateral economic agreements with South Korean President Kim Young-sam. Nawaz urged North Korea to make peace and improve its ties with South Korea; causing a division in Pakistan–North Korean relations. In April 1998, Nawaz went on to visit Italy, Germany, Poland, and Belgium to promote economic ties. He signed a number of agreements to enlarge economic co-operation with Italy and Belgium, and an agreement with the European Union (EU) for the protection of intellectual, industrial and commercial property rights.

However, Nawaz&#x27;s diplomatic efforts seemed to have gone to waste after conducting nuclear tests in May 1998. Widespread international criticism brought Pakistan&#x27;s reputation to a low since the Indo-Pakistani war of 1971. Pakistan failed to gather any support from its allies at the UN, and trade agreements were repealed by the US, Europe, and Asian bloc. Pakistan was accused of allowing nuclear proliferation. In June 1998, Nawaz authorised a secret meeting between Pakistan and Israel&#x27;s ambassadors to the UN and US, and assured Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that Pakistan would not transfer nuclear technology or materials to Iran or other Middle Eastern countries. Israel responded with concerns that Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi&#x27;s visit to Pakistan shortly after the May 1998 nuclear weapons tests was a sign that Pakistan was preparing to sell nuclear technology to Iran.

In 1998, India and Pakistan made an agreement recognising the principle of building an environment of peace and security and resolving all bilateral conflicts. On 19 February 1999, Indian Premier Atal Bihari Vajpayee paid a historic state visit to Pakistan, travelling on the inaugural Delhi–Lahore Bus connecting the Indian capital with Pakistan&#x27;s major cultural city of Lahore. On 21 February, the prime ministers signed a bilateral agreement with a memorandum of understanding to ensure nuclear-free safety in South Asia, which became known as the Lahore Declaration. The agreement was widely popular in both countries, where it was felt that development of nuclear weapons brought added responsibility and promoted the importance of confidence-building measures to avoid accidental or unauthorised use of nuclear weapons. Some Western observers compared the treaty to the cold war Strategic Arms Limitation Talks.

==== Constitutional amendments ====

In late August 1998, Nawaz proposed a law to establish a legal system based on Islamic principles. His proposal came a week after the 10-year commemorations of the late president Zia ul-Haq. After his cabinet removed some of its controversial aspects, the National Assembly approved and passed the bill on 10 October 1998 by a vote of 151 to 16. With a majority in parliament, Nawaz reverted the semi-presidential system in favour of a more parliamentary system. With these amendments, Nawaz became the country&#x27;s strongest freely elected prime minister. However, these amendments failed to achieve a two-thirds majority in the Senate, which remained under the control of the PPP. Weeks later, parliament was suspended by a military coup and Legal Framework Order, 2002 (2002 LFO) returned the country to a semi-presidential system for another decade.

Nawaz&#x27;s Fourteenth Amendment consolidated his power by preventing legislators and lawmakers from dissenting or voting against their own parties, and prohibited judicial appeal for offenders. Legislators from different parties challenged this with the Supreme Court, infuriating Nawaz. He openly criticised Chief Justice Sajad Alishah, inviting a notice of contempt. At the urging of the military and president, Nawaz agreed the solve the conflict amicably but remained determined to oust Alishah.

===== 1997 Constitutional crisis =====
Nawaz manipulated the ranks of senior judges, deposing two judges close to Alishah. The deposed judges challenged Nawaz&#x27;s orders on procedural grounds by filing a petition at Quetta High Court on 26 November 1997. Alishah was restrained by his fellow judges from adjudicating in the case against the prime minister. On 28 November, Nawaz appeared in the Supreme Court and justified his actions, citing evidence against the two deposed judges. Alishah suspended the decision of Quetta High Court, but soon the Peshawar High Court issued similar orders removing Alishah&#x27;s closest judges. The associate chief justice of Peshawar High Court, Justice Saeeduzzaman Siddiqui, declared himself acting chief justice.

Alishah continued to assert his authority and persisted in hearing Nawaz&#x27;s case. On 30 November, Nawaz&#x27;s cabinet ministers and a large number of supporters entered the Supreme Court building, disrupting the proceedings. The chief justice requested the military police, and subsequently struck down the Thirteenth Amendment, restoring the power of the president. However, the military-backed Nawaz refused to obey the president&#x27;s orders to remove him. Nawaz forced President Farooq Leghari to resign, and appointed Wasim Sajjad as acting president, then ousted Alishah to end the constitutional crisis.

On 29 November 2006, Nawaz and the PML-N issued a formal apology for their actions to Alishah and Leghari. A written apology was presented to Alishah at his residence and later, his party issued a white paper in Parliament formally apologising for their wrongdoing.

==== Policy on anti-terrorism ====
Nawaz passed the controversial Anti-Terrorist Act on 17 August 1997, which established Anti-Terrorism Courts. The Supreme Court later rendered the Act unconstitutional. However, Nawaz made amendments and received the permission of the Supreme Court to establish these courts.

==== Relations with the military ====
From 1981 until 1999, Nawaz enjoyed extremely cordial relations with the Pakistan Armed Forces, and was the only senior civilian leader to have friendly relations with the military establishment during that period. However, when Chief of Army Staff General Jehangir Karamat advocated for a National Security Council, Nawaz interpreted this as a conspiracy to return the military to an active political role.

In October 1998, three months before the end of his term, Karamat was forced to resign. This was controversial even within Nawaz&#x27;s cabinet and was seen as the least-popular moment of Nawaz&#x27;s administration. Military lawyers and civilian law experts saw this as unconstitutional and a violation of military justice code. However, Media Minister Syed Mushahid Hussain felt that Pakistan was &quot;finally becoming a normal democratic society&quot;, not beholden to its military.

Nawaz promoted General Pervez Musharraf to replace Karamat, also making Musharraf Chairman of the Joint Chiefs despite his lack of seniority. Admiral Fasih Bokhari resigned as Chief of Naval Staff in protest. Bokhari lodged a protest against the Kargil debacle and called for the court-martial of Musharraf, who Nawaz said acted alone.

In August, India shot down a Pakistan Navy reconnaissance aircraft in the Atlantique Incident, killing 16 naval officers, the greatest number of combat casualties for the navy since the Indo-Pakistani Naval War of 1971. Nawaz failed to gain foreign support against India for the incident, which newly appointed Chief of Naval Staff Admiral Abdul Aziz Mirza viewed as a lack of support for the navy in wartime. Nawaz further lost the confidence of the Marines for failing to defend the navy at the International Court of Justice (ICJ) in September. Relations with the Air Force likewise deteriorated, when Chief of Air Staff General Parvaiz Mehdi Qureshi accused the prime minister of not consulting the air force in matters critical to national security.

Two months later, after steadily worsening relations with the Armed Forces, Nawaz was deposed by Musharraf and martial law was established throughout the country.

=== Coup, trial, and exile ===
The simultaneous conflicts in the Kargil war with India and Afghanistan&#x27;s civil war, along with economical turmoil, turned public opinion against Nawaz and his policies. On 12 October 1999, Nawaz attempted to remove Musharraf for military failures and replace him with General Ziauddin Butt. Nawaz&#x27;s mindset was to remove the Chairman Joint Chiefs and the Chief of Army Staff first, then depose the other armed forces chiefs who had destroyed his credibility. Musharraf, who was in Sri Lanka, attempted to return on a PIA commercial flight.

Nawaz ordered the Sindh Police Force to arrest Musharraf. Fearing a &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot;, he further ordered the Jinnah Terminal to be sealed to prevent the landing of the airliner. The A300 aircraft was ordered to land at Nawabshah Airport (now Shaheed Benazirabad Airport). There, Musharraf contacted top Pakistan Army generals who took over the country and ousted Nawaz&#x27;s administration. Nawaz was taken to Adiala Jail for trial by a military judge. Musharraf later assumed control of the government as chief executive. A single protest was held by Sardar Mohsin Abbasi in front of the Supreme Court on 17 October on the first hearing of Nawaz.

Raja Zafar-ul-Haq, Sir Anjam Khan, Zafer Ali Shah and Sardar Mohsin Abbasi were the only supporters left after the first six months. Many of Nawaz&#x27;s cabinet ministers and his constituents were divided during the court proceedings and remained neutral. Dissidents such as Chaudhry Shujaat Hussain remained quiet and later formed Pakistan Muslim League (Q) (PML-Q), splitting Nawaz&#x27;s party into small factions. The military police initiated massive arrests of the PML workers and party leaders, who were held in Sindh and Punjab police prisons.

The military placed Nawaz on trial for &quot;kidnapping, attempted murder, hijacking and terrorism and corruption&quot;. In a speedy trial, the military court convicted Nawaz and gave him a life sentence. Reports surfaced that Nawaz had nearly been sentenced to execution. His leading defence lawyer, Iqbal Raad, was gunned down in Karachi in mid-March. Nawaz&#x27;s defence team blamed the military for providing inadequate protection. The military court proceedings were widely accused of being a show trial.

Nawaz was also tried for tax evasion on the purchase of a helicopter worth US$1 million. The Lahore High Court agreed to acquit him if he could prove his innocence, but Nawaz was unable to cite any substantial evidence. He was ordered to pay a fine of US$400,000 on grounds of tax evasion, and he was sentenced to 14 years of imprisonment.

Pakistan and Saudi Arabia, under Nawaz and King Fahd, had enjoyed extremely close business and cultural relations that is sometimes attributed as a special relationship. Saudi Arabia was shocked at the news of the coup. Amid pressure by Fahd and US President Bill Clinton, the military court avoided a death sentence for Sharif. Fahd had expressed concern that the death sentence would provoke intense ethnic violence in Pakistan as had happened in the 1980s following the execution of Zulfikar Ali Bhutto. Under an agreement facilitated by Saudi Arabia, Nawaz was placed in exile for the next 10 years, and agreed not to take part in politics in Pakistan for 21 years. He also forfeited property worth US$8.3 million (£5.7 million) and paid a fine of US$500,000. Musharraf wrote in his memoirs that, without the intervention of Fahd, Sharif would have been executed. Nawaz travelled to Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, where he was taken to a residence managed and controlled by the Saudi government, and provided a Saudi loan to establish a steel mill.

=== Return to Pakistan ===

==== Failed attempt in Islamabad ====
The Supreme Court of Pakistan ruled on 23 August 2007 that Nawaz and his brother, Shehbaz Sharif, were free to return to Pakistan. Both vowed to return soon. On 8 September, Lebanese politician Saad Hariri and Saudi intelligence chief Prince Muqrin bin Abdul-Aziz held an unprecedented joint press conference at Army Combatant Generals Headquarters (GHQ) to discuss how Nawaz&#x27;s return would affect relations. Muqrin expressed hope that Nawaz would continue with the agreement to not return for 10 years, but said &quot;these little things do not affect relations&quot;.

Two days later, Nawaz returned from exile in London to Islamabad. He was prevented from leaving the aeroplane and he was deported to Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, within hours. His political career appeared to be over.

==== Successful return in Lahore ====
Musharraf went to Saudi Arabia on 20 November 2007, the first time he left Pakistan since implementing the emergency rule. He attempted to convince Saudi Arabia to prevent Nawaz from returning until after the January 2008 elections. Nawaz had become more politically relevant after the return to Pakistan of Benazir Bhutto, who had also been exiled. Saudi Arabia suggested that if Pakistan had allowed a democratic-socialist woman leader, Bhutto, to return to the country, then the conservative Nawaz should be permitted to return as well.

Nawaz returned to Pakistan five days later. Thousands of supporters whistled and cheered as they hoisted Nawaz and his brother on their shoulders. After an 11-hour procession from the airport, he reached a mosque where he offered prayers as well as criticism against Musharraf. His return to Pakistan allowed only one day to register for elections, setting the stage for an overnight shift of the political scene.

==== 2008 General elections ====
Nawaz called for the boycott of the January 2008 elections because he believed the poll would not be fair, given a state of emergency imposed by Musharraf. Nawaz and the PML-N decided to participate in the parliamentary elections after 33 opposition groups, including Bhutto&#x27;s PPP, met in Lahore but failed to reach a joint position. He campaigned for the restoration of the independent judges removed by emergency government decree and Musharraf&#x27;s departure.

Bhutto&#x27;s assassination led to the postponement of the elections to 18 February 2008. Nawaz condemned Bhutto&#x27;s assassination and called it the &quot;gloomiest day in Pakistan&#x27;s history&quot;. As the elections approached, the country faced a rise in attacks by militants. Nawaz accused Musharraf of ordering anti-terror operations that had left the country &quot;drowned in blood&quot;. Pakistan&#x27;s government urged opposition leaders to refrain from holding rallies ahead of the elections, citing an escalating terrorist threat. The PML-N rejected this, accusing officials of campaign interference.

On 25 January, Musharraf attempted British mediation to reconcile with the Nawaz brothers but failed. The elections were dominated by the PPP, boosted by the death of Bhutto, and PML-N. In the 342-seat National Assembly, PPP received 86 seats; the PML-N, 66; and the PML-Q, which backed Musharraf, 40.

=== In opposition (2008–2013) ===
Nawaz&#x27;s party had joined a coalition with the PPP, led by its new leader Asif Ali Zardari, but the alliance was strained by differences. Nawaz won much public support for his uncompromising stand, and the coalition successfully forced Musharraf&#x27;s resignation from the presidency. After the coalition&#x27;s collapse, Nawaz pressured Zardari to reinstate the judges Musharraf removed during emergency rule. This led to the courts absolving Nawaz&#x27;s criminal record so that he could re-enter parliament.

==== By-elections ====
In the June 2008 by-elections, Nawaz&#x27;s party won 91 National Assembly seats and 180 provincial assembly seats in the Punjab. Election for the Lahore seat was postponed due to questions of Nawaz&#x27;s eligibility to contest.

==== Musharraf impeachment ====
The coalition government agreed on 7 August 2008 to impeach Musharraf. Zardari and Nawaz sent a formal request for him to step down. A charge sheet had been drafted and was to be presented to parliament. It included Musharraf&#x27;s first seizure of power in 1999 and his second in November 2007, when he declared an emergency as a means of being re-elected president. The charge-sheet also listed some of Musharraf&#x27;s contributions to the &quot;war on terror&quot;.

The National Assembly was summoned four days later to discuss impeachment proceedings. On 18 August, Musharraf resigned as President of Pakistan due to mounting political pressure. On 19 August, Musharraf defended his nine-year rule in an hour-long speech.

Nawaz claimed that Musharraf was responsible for the crisis in the nation. &quot;Musharraf pushed the country&#x27;s economy 20 years back after imposing martial law in the country and ousting the democratic government&quot;.

==== Lawyers movement ====

Musharraf had dismissed 60 judges and Chief Justice Iftikhar Chaudhry under the state of emergency in March 2007, in a failed bid to remain in power. Sharif had championed the cause of the judges since their dismissal, and he and Zardari had supported the reinstatement of judges in their campaigns. However, the new coalition government had failed to restore the judges, leading to its collapse in late 2008. Zardari feared that Chaudhry would undo all edicts instated by Musharraf including an amnesty that Zardari had received from corruption charges.

On 25 February 2009, the Supreme Court disqualified Nawaz Sharif and his brother Shehbaz Sharif, the Chief Minister of Punjab, from holding public office.
Zardari attempted to place Nawaz under house arrest, but the Punjab police left his residence after an angry crowd gathered outside. The police decision to lift his confinement was very likely in response to an army command. Nawaz, with a large contingent of SUVs, began leading a march to Islamabad but ended the march in Gujranwala. In a televised speech on 16 March, Prime Minister Yusuf Raza Gilani promised to reinstate Chaudhry after receiving pressure from Pakistan&#x27;s army, American and British envoys, and internal protests. PPP made a secret agreement to restore the PML government in the Punjab. Nawaz then called off the &quot;long march&quot;.

The PPP-led government continued to survive. A senior PML-N leader said &quot;95% of the members of the PML(N) were against becoming part of the lawyers&#x27; movement, but after the [Supreme Court] verdict, the PML(N) had no other choice&quot;.

==== Removal of bar on third term ====
The 18th Amendment passed in Parliament on 8 April 2010, removing the bar which allowed prime ministers to serve a maximum of two terms in office. This made Nawaz eligible to again become prime minister, which he did in 2013.

=== 2013 Pakistan general election ===
==== Khan–Sharif rivalry ====
Between 2011 and 2013, Nawaz and Imran Khan began to engage each other in a bitter feud. The rivalry between the two leaders grew in late 2011 when Khan addressed a large crowd at Minar-e-Pakistan in Lahore. The two began to blame each other for many political reasons.

From 26 April 2013, in the run up to the 2013 elections, both the PML-N and the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) vehemently criticised each other. Khan was accused of personally attacking Nawaz and was given notice by the Election Commission of Pakistan, though Khan denied it.

==== Policies ====
Nawaz campaigned on a promise to end loadshedding, construct motorways and Peshawar–Karachi high-speed rail. He also promised to construct a third port in Keti Bandar on the southern coast of Thatta District. Just prior to the election, Nawaz confirmed he had a long telephone conversation with Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, suggesting a desire to improve diplomatic relations.

==== Results ====

The Election Commission of Pakistan announced that the PML-N had won 124 seats in Parliament. Needing 13 additional seats to form a majority, Sharif held talks with elected independent candidates to form a coalition. Eight days later, 18 independent candidates joined the party, allowing PML-N to form the government without the agreement of another political party. Nawaz stated that he wanted to take his oath as prime minister on 28 May, the fifteenth anniversary of the Chagai-I nuclear tests.

On 27 June 2014, Khan announced that PTI would march on 14 August in protest of the government, alleging that the 2013 elections had been rigged. On 6 August 2014, Khan demanded the assemblies be dissolved and the resignations of the election commission and prime minister, claiming that the march would be the &quot;biggest political protest in the history of the country.&quot; PTI began their march from Lahore on 14 August and reached Islamabad on 16 August. Khan accused Nawaz of plundering the national wealth, and called on the public to withhold taxes and payment of utility bills to force the government to resign. In protest of alleged election rigging, the PTI&#x27;s lawmakers announced their resignation from the National Assembly, and the Punjab and Sindh assemblies. PML-N attempted to negotiate a settlement with Khan and his party&#x27;s backers to break the political deadlock. On 22 August 2014, Khan and his fellow 33 PTI lawmakers resigned from the National Assembly. He called for a caretaker government to be formed of non-politicians, and for fresh elections.

=== Third term as prime minister (2013–2017) ===

Nawaz was sworn in for an unprecedented third term as prime minister on 7 June 2013.
He faced numerous challenges, including bringing an end to US drone strikes and Taliban attacks while also tackling a crippled economy. Speculation was rife that the new government would need a bailout from the International Monetary Fund to restore economic stability.

==== Social policy ====

Nawaz&#x27;s third term moved from social conservatism to social centrism. In 2016, he called the future of Pakistan as one underpinned as an &quot;educated, progressive, forward looking and an enterprising nation&quot;. In January 2016 he backed the Punjab government policy of banning Tablighi Jamaat from preaching in educational institutions and in February he enacted a law to provide a helpline for women to report domestic abuse, despite the criticism of conservative religious parties.

Nawaz&#x27;s government hanged Mumtaz Qadri on 29 February 2016. Qadri had fatally shot Salman Taseer over his opposition to blasphemy laws. According to BBC News, the move to hang Qadri was an indication of the government&#x27;s growing confidence in taming the street power of religious groups. To the disliking of religious conservatives, Nawaz promised that the perpetrators of honour killings would be &#x27;punished very severely&#x27;. In March 2016, &quot;The Washington Post&quot; reported that Nawaz was defying Pakistan&#x27;s powerful clergy by unblocking access to YouTube, pushing to end child marriage, enacting a landmark domestic violence bill, and overseeing the execution of Qadri. Sunni Tehreek led protests of nearly 2,000 Islamic fundamentist on 28 March 2016, staging a three-day sit-in at the D-Chowk in Islamabad, demanding that Nawaz implement Shariah and declare Qadri a martyr. In response, Nawaz addressed the nation, stating that those &quot;fanning the fire of hatred&quot; would be dealt with under the law.

Nawaz&#x27;s government declared that the Hindu festivals Diwali and Holi, and the Christian festival of Easter, were officially public holidays. &quot;Time Magazine&quot; called this a &quot;significant step for the country&#x27;s beleaguered religious minorities.&quot; On 6 December 2016, Nawaz approved the renaming of Quaid-i-Azam University&#x27;s (QAU) physics centre to the Professor Abdus Salam Center for Physics. Nawaz also established the &quot;Professor Abdus Salam Fellowship&quot; to fully fund five Pakistani doctoral students in physics. In response, the Council of Islamic Ideology criticised Nawaz&#x27;s move claiming that &quot;changing the department&#x27;s name would not set the right precedent.&quot;

Nawaz stressed the need for operation Zarb-e-Qalam to fight societal extremism and intolerance through the power of &quot;writers, poets and intellectuals&quot;. Addressing the Pakistan Academy of Literature, Nawaz said that &quot;in a society where flowers of poetry and literature bloom, the diseases of extremism, intolerance, disunity and sectarianism are not born&quot;. Nawaz also announced a  million endowment fund for the promotion of art and literary activities in Pakistan. On 9 January 2017, the government denied visas for international preachers for the Tablighi Jamaat conference in Lahore. Jamia Binoria criticised the government&#x27;s decisions.

Nawaz, in a March 2017 address at Jamia Naeemia, urged Islamic scholars to spread the true teachings of Islam and take a firm stand against those who are causing disunity among Muslims. Nawaz called for a &quot;progressive and prosperous Muslim world&quot;, and asked the &quot;religious scholars to [...] take the war against these terrorists to its logical end.&quot;

On 7 April 2016, &quot;The Express Tribune&quot; claimed that Nawaz&#x27;s multibillion-rupee health insurance plan seemed to be failing because of poor planning, claiming that the basic health infrastructure doesn&#x27;t allow for such a plan.

==== Economic policy ====


The country&#x27;s economy faced many challenges including energy shortages, hyperinflation, mild economic growth, high debt and a large budget deficit. Shortly after taking power in 2013, Nawaz received a US$6.6 billion loan from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to avoid a balance-of-payments crisis. Lower oil prices, higher remittances and increased consumer spending pushed growth toward a seven-year high of 4.3 percent in 2014–15.

Asian Development Bank attributed gradual growth in economy to the continued low prices for oil and other commodities, the expected pick-up in growth in the advanced economies, and some alleviation of power shortages. However, the sovereign debt of Pakistan increased dramatically, with total debts and liabilities swelled to  trillion (or US$73 billion) by August 2016. Nawaz&#x27;s administration issued a five-year $500-million Eurobond in 2015 at 8.25% interest and in September 2016, it also raised $1 billion by floating Sukuk (Islamic bonds) at 5.5%.

The Sharif administration negotiated free trade agreements (FTAs) to expand trade liberalisation, notably with Turkey, South Korea, Iran, and Thailand, and an expansion of the FTA with Malaysia.
According to the Pakistan Institute of Legislative Development and Transparency (PILDAT), the quality of governance had &#x27;marginally improved&#x27; during Nawaz&#x27;s first year in power within an overall score of 44%. It scored highest in disaster-preparedness, merit-based recruitment, and foreign policy management, while it received the lowest scores on poverty alleviation and transparency.

On 4 July 2013, the IMF and Pakistan reached a provisional agreement on a US$5.3 billion bailout package to bolster Pakistan&#x27;s flagging economy and its perilously low foreign exchange reserves, which was contrary to an election promise not to take any more loans. On 4 September, IMF approved another $6.7 billion loan package over a three-year period. IMF demanded Pakistan conduct economic reforms, including privatising 31 state-owned companies.

Business confidence in Pakistan reached a three-year high in May 2014 backed by increasing foreign reserves which crossed US$15 billion by mid-2014. In May 2014, IMF stated that inflation had dropped to 13% (compared to 25% in 2008), foreign reserves were in a better position and that the current account deficit had come down to 3% of GDP. &quot;Standard &amp; Poor&#x27;s&quot; and &quot;Moody&#x27;s Corporation&quot; changed Pakistan&#x27;s long-term rating to &#x27;stable outlook&#x27;. The World Bank stated on 9 April 2014 that Pakistan&#x27;s economy was at a turning point, with projected GDP growth approaching 4%, driven by manufacturing and service sectors, better energy availability, and early revival of investor confidence.

In FY2015, industrial growth slowed due to power shortages, as Sharif&#x27;s administration failed to make adequate reforms in energy, taxation, and public sector enterprises. On 3 May, &quot;The Economist&quot; gave Sharif&#x27;s administration partial credit for the economy&#x27;s new stability, having upheld its agreements with the IMF. Standard &amp; Poor revised Pakistan&#x27;s credit rating from &#x27;stable&#x27; to &#x27;positive&#x27;, noting the government&#x27;s efforts towards fiscal consolidation, improvement in external financing conditions, and stronger capital inflows.
During a trip to Pakistan on 10 February 2016, World Bank Group&#x27;s president Jim Yong Kim applauded the economic policies of Nawaz&#x27;s government. He claimed that Pakistan&#x27;s economic outlook had become more stable. On 19 March, Nawaz approved tax incentives in an attempt to attract new automotive manufacturing plants to the country. In November 2016, the government announced that Renault was expected to start assembling cars in Pakistan by 2018.

On 8 April 2016, following lobbying by international development groups, the government changed its methodology for measuring poverty. The poverty line was moved from to per adult per month, which increased the poverty ratio from 9.3% to 29.5%. A PILDAT survey claimed that the quality of governance had improved, though it was still weak for transparency. Fred Hochberg, head of the Export–Import Bank of the United States visited Pakistan on 14 April and said that he &quot;sees a lot of opportunities to expand its exposure to Pakistan.&quot;

On 9 May, the World Bank&#x27;s Pakistan Development Report stated that the current account was in a healthy position, but that Pakistan&#x27;s export competitiveness has diminished due to protectionist policies, poor infrastructure, and high transaction costs for trade. Consequently, Pakistan&#x27;s exports-to-GDP ratio had been declining for the last two decades.

On 15 December 2016, Pakistan became a signatory of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development&#x27;s (OECD) Convention on Mutual Administrative Assistance in Tax Matters, aimed at curbing tax evasion. In his 2016 book, &quot;The Rise and Fall of Nations&quot;, Ruchir Sharma stated that Pakistan&#x27;s economy was at a &#x27;take-off&#x27; stage and the future outlook to 2020 was &#x27;very good&#x27;.

On 24 October 2016, months after the Sharif government concluded a US$6.4 billion three-year programmes, IMF managing director Christine Lagarde visited Pakistan, during which she maintained Pakistan was &quot;out of the economic crisis&quot;. She added that continued efforts were needed to bring more people under taxation and to ensure that all paid their fair share. The 2017 Ease of doing business index recognised Pakistan as one of the ten countries making the biggest improvements to business regulations.
Hundreds of Chinese trucks loaded with goods rolled into the Sost dry port in Gilgit-Baltistan on 1 November as the first shipment of the China–Pakistan Economic Corridor.

The government announced plans to restructure PIA, which sought to become more competitive by leasing newer and more efficient aircraft. PIA was split into two companies: a holding group would retain some  billion in debt and excess personnel, and a &quot;new&quot; PIA would hold the lucrative landing rights and new aircraft. The government planned to sell a 26% stake in the new PIA to a strategic partner. In February 2016, Pakistan International Airlines Corporation (PIAC) is to be converted into a public limited company as Pakistan International Airlines Company Limited (PIACL) to make way for privatisation, however, this trigged an eight-day union strike. On 23 December 2016, a Chinese consortium won the bid for a 40% stake in the PSX with an offer of US$85.5 million.

===== Communications and development =====

Upon assuming office, Nawaz launched the Public Sector Development Programme (PSDP) which constructed major projects to stimulate the economy. This included Diamer-Bhasha Dam, Dasu Dam, Faisalabad-Khanewal M-4 Motorway, Rawalpindi-Islamabad Metrobus Service and Lahore–Karachi Motorway. Nawaz also approved feasibility studies for numerous other projects. During FY2014–15, Nawaz&#x27;s government announced additional PSDP funding from to  billion. The government allocated  billion of PSDP funds for the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, including the Lahore-Karachi Motorway.

&quot;The Economist&quot;, writing in January 2017, criticised Nawaz&#x27;s spending on infrastructure, explaining that it sat unused as &quot;the economic boom it was meant to trigger has never arrived.&quot; Regarding the China–Pakistan Economic Corridor, the magazine wrote that &quot;critics fear the country will struggle to pay back the debt, especially if foreign-exchange earnings from exports continue to dwindle&quot; further adding that &quot;It may not concern Mr. Sharif unduly if the next generation of roads is as deserted as the last.&quot;

On 24 April 2014, mobile companies Mobilink, Telenor, Ufone and Zong won auctions for 3G and 4G mobile spectrum licenses, raising US$1.112 billion. Nawaz stated that  billion will be collected in annual revenue from the licenses, while the technology would create millions of jobs in the service sector. Nawaz also launched the Prime Minister&#x27;s Youth Programme, providing a  billion fund for interest-free loans, skills development and provision of laptop computers.

==== Protests ====
Around 2,000 far-right protesters led by Sunni Tehreek staged a sit-in at D-Chowk in front of the parliament in Islamabad on 27 March 2016, causing a partial shutdown of the capital. The protestors demanded the implementation of Sharia in the country and declaring Mumtaz Qadri a martyr. The protestors burned cars and a public transit station and injured journalists and bystanders. The government called in the army to enforce order. By 29 March the crowd had shrunk to 700 protestors, and the protest ended on 30 March after the government promised not to amend the blasphemy laws.

Imran Khan began mobilising workers on 29 October 2016 to lockdown Islamabad, demanding Nawaz&#x27;s resignation and a corruption inquiry. In response, the Sharif government placed a citywide ban on gatherings and arrested hundreds of opposition activists. The government also arrested scores of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf workers and closed the motorway leading from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. On 1 November, Khan ceased protests after the Supreme Court said it would form a judicial commission to probe allegations stemming from the &quot;Panama Papers&quot; leaks about the Sharif family&#x27;s offshore wealth. In the first week of January, four Pakistani activists known on social media for their secular leftist views went missing.

===== Pakistan Vision 2025 =====
In August 2014, the Sharif administration unveiled an ambitious programme to enhance exports to US$150 billion by 2025. According to the &quot;Daily Times&quot;, the Vision 2025 is based on seven pillars: putting people first; developing human and social capital; achieving sustained, indigenous and inclusive growth; governance, institutional reform and modernisation of the public sector; energy, water and food security; private-sector-led growth and entrepreneurship, developing a competitive knowledge economy through value addition and modernisation of transportation infrastructure and greater regional connectivity.
===== Nuclear power policy =====

In November 2013, Nawaz broke ground on a US$9.59 billion nuclear power complex in Karachi, designed to produce 2200 MW of electricity. During the groundbreaking ceremony, Nawaz stated that Pakistan would construct six nuclear power plants during his term in office. He went on to say that Pakistan has plans to construct a total of 32 nuclear power plants by 2050, which will generate more than 40,000 MW. In February 2014, Nawaz confirmed to the IAEA that all future civilian nuclear power plants and research reactors will voluntarily be put under IAEA safeguards.

Nawaz attended the 2014 Nuclear Security Summit, and stated that Pakistan was giving nuclear security the highest importance.

===== FATA reform =====
On 3 March 2017, Nawaz&#x27;s cabinet approved a set of steps to be taken for the proposed merger of the Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA) with Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, along with a 10-year  billion development-reform package. Under the reform project, the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court and the Peshawar High Court will be extended to the FATA region.

==== National security and defence policy ====

On 9 September 2013, Nawaz proposed a civil-military partnership, and immediately reestablished the National Security Council with Sartaj Aziz as his National Security Advisor (NSA). Nawaz also reconstituted the Cabinet Committee on National Security (C2NS), with military representation in the political body. According to political scientist and civic-military relations expert Aqil Shah, Nawaz finally did exactly what former chairman joint chiefs Jehangir Karamat had called for in 1998.

In September 2013, Nawaz announced that Pakistan would open unconditional talks with the Taliban, declaring them stakeholders rather than terrorists. The PML-N&#x27;s conservative hardliners also chose to blame the US and NATO for causing terrorism in Pakistan. However, Pakistani Taliban&#x27;s Supreme Council demanded a cease-fire, to also include the release of all imprisoned militants and the withdrawal of the Pakistani military from all tribal regions. Former and current government officials criticised Nawaz for not providing clear leadership on how to handle the more than 40 militant groups, many of them comprising violent Islamic extremists.

On 15 September, just six days after Nawaz&#x27;s proposal for talks with the Taliban, a roadside bomb killed Major-General Sanaullah Khan, a lieutenant colonel and another soldier in the Upper Dir district near the Afghanistan border. Taliban spokesman Shahidullah Shahid claimed responsibility for the bombing. On the same day, seven more soldiers were killed in four separate attacks. In a press release, Chairman joint chiefs General Khalid Shameem Wynne and chief of army staff General Ashfaq Parvez Kayani, who had earlier warned Nawaz not to adopt a surrender strategy, publicly warned the government that the military would not allow the Taliban to set conditions for peace. General Kayani stated: &quot;No-one should have any misgivings that we would let terrorists coerce us into accepting their terms.&quot;
Seven members of the Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan conducted a terrorist attack on a public school in the city of Peshawar on 16 December, killing over 130 children in Pakistan&#x27;s deadliest terrorist attack. In response to the attack, Nawaz – with consultation from all political parties – devised a 20-point National Action Plan which included continued execution of convicted terrorists, establishment of special military courts for two years and regulation of madrasas.

Based on the National Action Plan, the government made 32,347 arrests in 28,826 operations conducted across the country from 24 December 2014 to 25 March 2015. During the same period, Pakistan deported 18,855 Afghan refugees while the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) registered 64 cases for money transfer through Hawala, arrested 83 people and recovered  million. In total, 351 actionable calls were received on the anti-terror helpline and National Database and Registration Authority verified 59.47 million . On 28 March 2016, a suicide attack by the Jamaat-ul-Ahrar at a park in Lahore killed 70 people on the evening of Easter Sunday. Analysts believed that Nawaz&#x27;s desire to maintain stability in Punjab led him to turn a blind eye towards groups operating there. Following the attack, Pakistan detained more than 5,000 suspects and made 216 arrests.

===== Karachi operation =====
The Sharif government launched a ranger-led operation on 5 September 2013 in Karachi, aimed at removing crime and terrorism from the metropolis. During the first phase, which lasted until 10 August 2015, rangers reported to have conducted 5,795 raids during which they had apprehended 10,353 suspects and recovered 7,312 weapons. Prominent among the raids were the 11 March raid on the Muttahida Qaumi Movement (MQM) headquarters Nine Zero and the offices of Sindh Building Control Authority (SBCA). The first phase also saw a total of 826 terrorists, 334 target killers, and 296 extortionists arrested. The Rangers expanded their mandate to kidnappers, and arrested 82 abductors and secured the release of 49 captives. The report stated that targeted killing in the city had dropped by over 80%. On 23 August 2016, officials claimed that they had arrested 654 target killers affiliated with the Muttahida Qaumi Movement&#x27;s (MQM) armed wing since 4 September 2013.

===== Operation Zarb-e-Azb =====
Negotiations with the Taliban collapsed after the execution of 23 Frontier Corps by the Taliban on 17 February 2014, and relations worsened with the Taliban&#x27;s 2014 Jinnah International Airport attack. Operation Zarb-e-Azb was formally launched on 15 June 2014 after the Sharif administration prepared for a three-front offensive: isolating targeted militant groups, obtaining support from the political parties, and protecting civilians from reprisals. The 2014 Wagah border suicide attack has been the deadliest retaliation against the operation so far.

==== Foreign policy ====

===== Neighbouring countries =====
Nawaz launched &#x27;peaceful neighbourhood&#x27; initiative to improve Pakistan&#x27;s ties with India, Afghanistan, Iran and China. On 12 May 2014, Nawaz met Iranian President Hassan Rouhani amid tensions over the February kidnapping of five Iranian soldiers by extremists who took them into Pakistan.
On 27 October 2016, Nawaz hosted the 15th ministerial meeting of Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation Program (CAREC), and proposed an Open Skies Agreement between the countries.

===== China =====

Chinese Premier Li Keqiang was the first world leader to visit Pakistan and congratulate Nawaz on his 2013 electoral victory. Upon return to Beijing, Li announced investment of US$31.5 billion in Pakistan, mainly in energy, infrastructure and a port expansion for Gwadar, the terminus of the China–Pakistan Economic Corridor. According to &quot;The Express Tribune&quot;, Sharif&#x27;s government had charged the army with providing fool-proof security to Chinese officials in Balochistan to address Beijing&#x27;s concerns regarding investment in the province, which was to receive 38% of the funds.

On 8 November 2014, Nawaz led a delegation to Beijing and signed agreements for Chinese investment reportedly worth about $46 billion. Nawaz also announced Pakistan would aid China it its fight against the East Turkestan Islamic Movement. On 24 June 2015 and again on 1 April 2016 China blocked India&#x27;s move in the UN to ban Jaish-e-Mohammed chief Masood Azhar; the Chinese action was in &quot;consultation&quot; with Pakistan. On 25 June 2016, Pakistan became a full member of Shanghai Cooperation Organisation. On 4 September 2016, Pakistan&#x27;s cabinet was given approval to negotiate a long-term defence agreement with China.

===== India =====
Nawaz launched talks with India to liberalize their trade relationship, and gained and an agreement of Non-Discriminatory Market Access on Reciprocal Basis (NDMARB) status for the two countries on 26 March 2014. However, &quot;The Times of India&quot; reported that Pakistan&#x27;s military pressured Nawaz to stop trade liberalisation with India. Nawaz attended the 26 May 2014 first oath of office ceremony of Narendra Modi as prime minister, the first time that a prime minister from one state attended the inauguration of their counterpart. They agreed to further cooperate on trade.

In October 2014, 20 civilians were killed and thousands forced to flee their homes when Pakistani and Indian security forces began shelling in Kashmir, each side blaming the other for the incident. The following month, Nawaz blamed India for an inflexible approach towards resolving the Kashmir dispute. According to Barkha Dutt during the 2015 SAARC Summit, Nawaz and Modi held a secret meeting.

On 10 December 2015, during the Heart of Asia conference, Pakistan and India announced that they were resuming dialogue on outstanding issues, ending a two-year stalemate. On 1 April 2015, Modi made his first visit to Pakistan in a surprise stopover in Lahore to meet Nawaz on his birthday. Modi and Nawaz held a brief meeting at Raiwind Palace. Modi also attended the wedding ceremony of Nawaz&#x27;s granddaughter.

Balochistan&#x27;s Home Minister Sarfraz Bugti announced on 25 March 2016 that they had arrested an Indian naval intelligence officer working for Research and Analysis Wing (RAW). Kulbushan Yadav was allegedly involved in financially supporting terrorists and also confessed to his involvement in unrest in Karachi. The same day, India&#x27;s Ministry of External Affairs stated that Yadav had had no involvement with the government since his early retirement from the Indian Navy. India also demanded consular access for him. On 29 March 2016, Sharif&#x27;s government released a six-minute video of Jadhav apparently confessing to the RAW&#x27;s involvement in the country. On 1 April, Pakistan confirmed that security agencies had arrested several suspects believed to be working for RAW.
Relations between India and Pakistan escalated with the killing of Burhan Wani by Indian security forces on 8 July 2016. Anti-Indian protests started in all 10 districts of the Kashmir Valley. Protesters defied curfew with attacks on security forces and public properties.[20][21] The unrest led to a standstill in bilateral relations. Indian Home Minister Rajnath Singh accused Pakistan of backing unrest in Kashmir. Tensions reached a boiling point when militants attacked an army base in the Indian-controlled side of Kashmir and killed 18 soldiers. Indian army military operations head Lieutenant-General Ranbir Singh claimed that there was evidence the attackers were members of an Islamist militant group in Pakistan.

Addressing the UN General Assembly on 22 September 2016, Nawaz demanded an independent inquiry and a UN fact-finding mission to investigate extrajudicial killing and human rights abuses in Jammu and Kashmir. India&#x27;s junior foreign minister M. J. Akbar criticised Nawaz for glorifying Wani. Tensions further escalated with reports suggesting moblisation of military equipment by both sides.

===== Afghanistan =====
Nawaz greeted Afghan President Ashraf Ghani on 15 November 2014 and pledged his support to the Afghan president over his attempt to bring the Taliban to the negotiating table. &quot;Al Jazeera&quot; reported that &quot;the leaders also pledged to begin a new era of economic co-operation, with Ghani saying three days of talks had ended 13 years of testy relations&quot;. The two countries also signed a trade deal aimed at doubling trade between the Kabul and Islamabad to US$5 billion by 2017, while also pledging to work together on a power import project and Trans-Afghanistan Pipeline. During the visit Nawaz and Ghani also watched a cricket match between the two countries. During June 2016, cross-border shootings between Afghan and Pakistani forces left three people dead after tensions escalated over Pakistan&#x27;s construction of fences across the Durand Line. On 20 June, Pakistan completed the construction of a trench along the border in Balochistan.

===== United States =====

Nawaz paid an official visit to Washington, D.C. from 20 to 23 October 2013. He and Barack Obama committed to strengthening relations and advancing shared interests for a prosperous Pakistan. &quot;Voice of America&quot; reported that the US released more than US$1.6 billion in military and economic aid that was suspended when relations suffered over the covert raid that killed Osama bin Laden in 2011.

On Pakistan&#x27;s request the United States temporarily stopped drone strikes in north-western Pakistan. In March 2016, as one of his foreign policy successes, the United States Senate blocked a bid to derail the sale of F-16 Falcons to Pakistan by Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Corker, who continued to vow to block the use of US funds to finance the deal.

US Senator John McCain travelled to Pakistan on 26 July 2016 to discuss counterterrorism efforts in the region. In the &quot;Financial Times&quot;, McCain called upon the US and Pakistani leaders not to &quot;allow ambivalence and suspicion to fester&quot;, adding that &quot;common interests in counterterrorism, nuclear security and regional stability are too important and too urgent&quot;. He also called upon the Obama administration to &quot;make clear its enduring commitment to Pakistan&#x27;s stability and economic growth.&quot; McCain also visited Miramshah in North Waziristan.

Republican Congressmen Ted Poe and Dana Rohrabacher moved a bill in the US Congress on 21 September to designate Pakistan as a state sponsor of terrorism. McCain assured former Pakistani President Asif Ali Zardari that the bill would not pass, and that its sponsors represented a small minority.

Nawaz called president-elect Donald Trump on 1 December 2016 to congratulate him. The statement released by Nawaz&#x27;s office quoted Trump calling Nawaz a &quot;terrific guy&quot;, adding that Pakistan is a &quot;fantastic country, fantastic place&quot;. Trump Tower put out a statement saying that they &quot;had a productive conversation about how the United States and Pakistan will have a strong working relationship in the future.&quot; On 3 December, &quot;Dawn&quot; reported that a US National Defence Authorisation Act was set to be approved by the US Congress which would recognise Pakistan as a key strategic partner and pledge more than US$900 million in economic and other assistance to the country; half of that would be dependent on Pakistan&#x27;s commitment to fighting all terrorist groups, including the Haqqani network.

===== Europe =====
Nawaz visited London on 30 April 2014 and met David Cameron and other officials, and delivered a keynote address at the Pakistan Investment Conference. According to Cameron&#x27;s staff, the leaders agreed to work together to support critical economic reforms for Pakistan, particularly to increase the tax-to-GDP ratio towards 15%, and welcomed the developing relationship between the Federal Board of Revenue and HM Revenue and Customs to support this. On 11 November 2014, Nawaz visited Berlin where he met with German Chancellor Angela Merkel. According to Deutsche Welle, during the meeting Nawaz argued for more German investment, particularly in the energy sector, but Merkel expressed wariness over the security situation in Pakistan.

In 2014, during the visit of Russian Defence Minister Sergey Shoygu, Pakistan and Russia signed an agreement on military cooperation. Shoygu held in-depth talks with Nawaz, who promised to promote multi-dimensional relations with Russia. The meeting came months after Russia had lifted an embargo on supplying weapons and military hardware to Pakistan, starting with Mil Mi-24 helicopters. As a sign of improving ties, Russian forces arrived in Pakistan on 23 September 2016 to participate in joint military exercises.

===== Muslim world =====

Nawaz is said to enjoy exceptionally close ties with senior members of the Saudi royal family. &quot;Pakistan Today&quot; reported on 2 April 2014 that Pakistan will sell JF-17 Thunder jets to Saudi Arabia, after the kingdom had given a grant of US$1.5 billion to Pakistan in early 2014.
Saudi Arabia&#x27;s Crown Prince Salman bin Abdulaziz al-Saud arrived in Pakistan on 15 February to meet Nawaz and vowed to enhance work between the two countries. Sharif travelled to Saudi Arabia for the last 10 days of Ramadan. King Abdullah said on 26 July that Saudi Arabia would always stand by Pakistan, its leadership and people, after an hour-long meeting with Nawaz at his Riyadh. Nawaz also met Muqrin bin Abdulaziz Al Saud, while Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud referred to Pakistan as his second home.

&quot;Al-Monitor&quot; reported on 15 March 2015 that the Salman of Saudi Arabia wanted firm assurances from Nawaz that Pakistan would align itself with Saudi Arabia and its Sunni Arab allies against Iran, especially in the proxy war underway in Yemen. Salman specifically wanted a Pakistani military contingent to deploy to the kingdom to defend the borders. Nawaz promised closer counter-terrorism and military co-operation but no troops for the immediate future. On 11 January 2016, &quot;Time&quot; stated that a high-level Iranian delegation including Adel al-Jubeir and Mohammad bin Salman Al Saud had travelled to Islamabad to seek Pakistan&#x27;s inclusion in the 34-country &quot;Islamic military alliance&quot;. However, Nawaz struck a more conciliatory tone, suggesting that Islamabad would mediate between Saudi Arabia and Iran. On 19 January 2016, Nawaz and Chief of Army Staff Raheel Sharif embarked on a peace mission to Riyadh and Tehran to reduce tensions which had escalated with the execution of Sheikh Nimr On 16 March 2016, Zee News claimed that Saudi Arabia was creating a military alliance of Islamic countries along the lines of the NATO, and wished Pakistan to lead it.

Nawaz supported the Saudi-led intervention in Bahrain and in his visit to Saudi Arabia he reassured that he would &quot;help devise a new battle plan for Saudi intervention in the country.&quot;

== Post-premiership ==
=== Avenfield Apartments case ===
The Avenfield case pertains to the ownership of four luxury apartments in London. The case emerged from the Panama Papers leak, which revealed significant overseas assets held by the Sharif family. In 2018, an accountability court convicted Nawaz Sharif, his daughter Maryam Nawaz, and his son-in-law Capt. Safdar. Nawaz was sentenced to 11 years in prison, Maryam to eight years, and Capt. Safdar to one year.

However, the Islamabad High Court (IHC) later suspended their sentences, citing several issues with the conviction. The IHC noted that the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) did not specify Sharif&#x27;s exact income or sources of income in its reference. The evidence provided lacked proper verification, and there was no clear determination of the value of the Avenfield Apartments at the time of their acquisition. Additionally, the IHC found no evidence connecting Maryam Nawaz Sharif to the alleged conspiracy with her father.

=== Al-Azizia Steel Mills Case ===
This case involves allegations that Nawaz Sharif received funds from his son&#x27;s company in Saudi Arabia, Al-Azizia Steel Mills, which were not declared. In December 2018, Nawaz Sharif was sentenced to seven years in prison by an accountability court and fined Rs1.5 billion and US $25 million. He was also disqualified from holding any public office for 10 years following his release from prison.

However, the Islamabad High Court nullified this conviction in a 2023 ruling. Sharif, maintains that the charges were politically motivated.

=== Flagship Investment Case ===
This case was also related to the Panama Papers and involved accusations that Nawaz Sharif owned undisclosed assets through a number of companies including Flagship Investments. However, Nawaz Sharif was acquitted in this case in December 2018, as the accountability court found insufficient evidence to convict him. The National Accountability Bureau (NAB) could not establish Sharif&#x27;s relationship with 16 companies involved in the corruption reference.

=== Hudaibiya Paper Mills money laundering case ===
Finance Minister Ishaq Dar, a close associate and relative of the Sharif family, provided a confessional statement to a magistrate, claiming the Sharif brothers utilized Hudaibiya Paper Mills for money laundering in the late 1990s. Dar subsequently retracted his statement, asserting it was made under duress.

=== Acquittal from cases and moving to London ===
Reports claimed that Nawaz suffered four angina attacks and his family complained that the Imran Khan government was not allowing him time for medical treatment. The Islamabad High Court (IHC) granted him bail on humanitarian grounds in October 2019, and Nawaz went to London for medical treatment. Later in March, he was granted bail for a period of six weeks by the Supreme Court to continue pursuing his health treatment. After failing to return to Pakistan when his bail expired, the IHC declared him an absconder. He currently faces non-bailable arrest warrants for the Al-Azizia corruption case. However, soon after his brother Shehbaz Sharif came to power as prime minister after a vote of no confidence was brought against former premier Imran Khan, there were changes in the senior leadership of the National Accountability Bureau, and Nawaz Sharif was acquitted in some 40-year old cases and declared a &quot;political victim&quot; in others.

=== Allegations of rigging in 2024 election ===

After Nawaz returned to Pakistan from London, he regained leadership over the Pakistan Muslim League (N) and launched an election campaign for a fourth term as Prime Minister in the 2024 Pakistani general election, allegedly using the Pakistan Armed Forces’ support against the rival Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI).

He ran for a seat in the National Assembly from NA-130 Lahore-XIV against jailed PTI senior Yasmin Rashid. She officially gained 104,485 votes and lost her seat to Nawaz, who gained 179,310 according to the ECP, though major allegations of rigging surfaced for the constituency, as Rashid claimed she won the seat against Nawaz by a large margin. Yasmin Rashid stated that Nawaz had officially won the seat due to rigging committed by him, and had added 74,000 votes to his name in a form of major election manipulation. The civil society organization, PATTAN concluded that NA-130 would face the worst rigging prior to the elections and stated that the ECP had rigged the election in ‘historic rigging’ in favor of Nawaz using pre-prepared Form 47s. His party failed to win a simple majority and hence formed a coalition government under Nawaz’s younger brother, Shehbaz Sharif.

==Personal life==
Nawaz married Kulsoom Nawaz in April 1971. They have two sons and two daughters. His eldest daughter, Maryam Nawaz, has served as the chief minister of Punjab since 2024. Maryam is married to politician Muhammad Safdar Awan. His other daughter, Asma Nawaz, is married to Ali Dar, son of Ishaq Dar, the former finance minister of Pakistan. His elder son, Hussain Nawaz, is a businessman based in Saudi Arabia and currently resides in Jeddah. His younger son, Hassan Nawaz, is also a businessman and lives in London.

Nawaz underwent open heart surgery in May 2016 in London. It was his second open-heart operation.

==Wealth==
The growth of Pakistan&#x27;s industry, which occurred under President Ayub Khan during the 1960s, was destroyed by the nationalisation program instituted by Prime Minister Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto, to halt capital flight from the country to Eastern Europe. This program included nationalisation of Ittefaq Group and many other large enterprises.

In 2011, Nawaz&#x27;s assets were worth Rs 166 million, which increased to Rs 1.82 billion by 2013. In 2012 his net income was Rs. 12.4 million ($1.24 million). He was one of five billionaires elected to Pakistan&#x27;s National Assembly in 2013. In 2015, his declared assets slightly decreased to  billion ($17.5 Million). As of 2017 his net worth is over billion.

According to the Election Commission of Pakistan, Nawaz is one of the wealthiest men in Pakistan, with an estimated net worth of at least . Most of his wealth originates from his businesses in steel construction.

The personal residence of the Sharif family, Raiwind Palace, is located in Jati Umra, Raiwind, on the outskirts of Lahore. He also has a residence in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, known as the Sharif Villa, where he lived during his years in exile.

==Public image==
Jon Boone wrote in &quot;The Guardian&quot; in 2013, that following his attempts to enact Sharia Law in the late 1990s, Nawaz had adopted a more centrist position by seeking diplomatic and trade relations with India which encouraged support from left-leaning Pakistanis. In another column, &quot;The Guardian&quot; described Nawaz&#x27;s first two terms in the 1990s as authoritarian and clouded by allegations of corruption, but that &quot;old foes and longstanding friends say Nawaz is a changed man&quot; from when he originally entered politics &quot;to defend family [business] interests&quot;.

Tim Craig, writing in March 2016 for &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, described Nawaz&#x27;s move away from social conservatism as &quot;traced to Sharif&#x27;s ambitious economic agenda, the influence his 42-year-old daughter has over him, and his awareness that Pakistan remains the butt of jokes&quot;. Afrasiab Khattak summarized the shift by stating &quot;[Nawaz] knows extremism is not good for business&quot;. Nawaz&#x27;s advisor Miftah Ismail described him as &quot;a very religious guy&quot;, adding however &quot;he is perfectly okay with other people not being religious&quot;. Writing for &quot;The Express Tribune&quot; in 2016, Fahd Hussain stated that Nawaz will likely will face &quot;blowback from its natural allies among the clergy&quot;, adding that with &quot;the bulk of the Punjab conservative voter[s] [remaining] in the Nawaz camp&quot;, that Nawaz is eyeing the &quot;liberal, progressive, left-of-centre voters&quot;.

Leftist Senator Raza Rabbani claimed that Nawaz &quot;has always had these rightwing leanings&quot;, adding that &quot;the temptation was there in the past to appease his rightwing Islamist constituency&quot;. Mushahid Hussain Syed, a former member of Nawaz&#x27;s cabinet, described Nawaz&#x27;s religious leanings: &quot;he is quite a good Muslim in terms of belief and basic rituals like prayer and going to Mecca&quot; adding however, &quot;in cultural terms he is quite relaxed. He likes music and movies and has a good sense of humour. He is not your average type of serious, sulking fundo.&quot; Mohammed Hanif, writing in 2013, claimed that &quot;if Nawaz weren&#x27;t from the dominant province Punjab, where most of the army elite comes from, if he didn&#x27;t represent the trading and business classes of Punjab, he would still be begging forgiveness for his sins in Saudi&quot;.

Author Edward A. Gargan, writing in November 1991, described Nawaz&#x27;s government as &quot;bedeviled by gossip, barraged by accusations of venality, castigated by the opposition and threatened by a final rupture of cordiality with the United States&quot;. The same year Najam Sethi described Nawaz&#x27;s government as &quot;corrupt, absolutely, astronomically corrupt, including the prime minister&quot;. In 2009, &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote that &quot;Bhutto and her Pakistan Peoples Party were considered more amenable allies for Washington&quot; adding that &quot;more nationalistic and religiously oriented, [Nawaz] and his party, the Pakistan Muslim League-N, have traditionally found common cause with the religious parties&quot;. Pervez Hoodbhoy described Nawaz as &quot;a reflection of Pakistani society&quot; adding that &quot;he is silent on what matters most: the insurgency. What we need is a leader.&quot; Celia W. Dugger, writing in 1999, described Sharif&#x27;s Raiwind Palace as &quot;walls paneled in silken fabrics and rococo chairs laden with so much gold leaf they looked like they belonged in the court of Louis XIV or a bordello&quot;, drawing comparison between Nawaz&#x27;s lifestyle and that of the &quot;Mughals&quot;.

==Controversies==
=== Mehrangate scandal (1990–1994) ===

Also known as the Mehran Bank scandal, this involved accusations that several politicians received funds from the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) agency through Mehran Bank to influence the 1990 elections. The scandal came to light in 1994 when former Army Chief General Mirza Aslam Beg and former ISI chief Lt. Gen. Asad Durrani were implicated in distributing millions of rupees to political opponents of the Pakistan People&#x27;s Party (PPP). Ultimately, IJI, led by Nawaz Sharif, won the 1990 elections.

=== 1997 constitutional crisis ===
Nawaz Sharif&#x27;s government was involved in a constitutional crisis in 1997 when he clashed with the judiciary and President Farooq Leghari. Sharif&#x27;s attempt to curtail the powers of the President and the judiciary led to a confrontation, culminating in the controversial removal of Chief Justice Sajjad Ali Shah.

=== Allegations of rigging in 2013 Election ===

After his return to power in 2013, a protest movement led by Imran Khan, Tahir-ul-Qadri and supported by rival factions of the Muslim League, such as the Pakistan Muslim League-Q (PLM-Q) and Awami Muslim League (AML), mounted pressure on the Sharif government. Khan demanded Nawaz&#x27;s resignation over allegations that the 2013 general election was rigged. Nawaz claimed to have support from the majority of the parties in Parliament. PML-N claimed that the elections had been the most free and fair in the country&#x27;s history. Nawaz was also criticised by his opponents for running a system of patronage in which relatives were appointed to key state positions such as his brother as Chief Minister, and other relatives as cabinet ministers.

=== Plane Hijacking Case ===
On October 12, 1999, then-Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif attempted to prevent a plane carrying General Pervez Musharraf, the Chief of Army Staff, from landing in Pakistan, effectively stranding it mid-air. This action was taken amidst a coup led by Musharraf. Sharif&#x27;s order to divert the flight, PK805, endangered the lives of all passengers on board as the plane had limited fuel. The military swiftly responded, and Musharraf successfully landed in Karachi. Following these events, Musharraf&#x27;s forces overthrew Sharif&#x27;s government.

Sharif was arrested, found guilty of hijacking and terrorism charges, and sentenced to life in prison. He was cleared of attempted murder and kidnapping charges. Sharif and his supporters have maintained that the charges were politically motivated, with Sharif himself claiming that the case was more of a personal vendetta than a fair trial.

He was exiled to Saudi Arabia in 2000 as part of a deal facilitated by international mediation. This incident led to nearly a decade of military rule under Musharraf.

=== Response to terrorism allegation by Indian Prime Minister ===
In September 2013, following Prime Minister Manmohan Singh’s address at the UN General Assembly, where he referred to Pakistan as the &quot;epicenter of terrorism,&quot; Sharif reportedly likened Singh&#x27;s comments to the behaviour of a &quot;dehati aurat&quot; (village woman), according to Pakistani journalist Hamid Mir. Mir clarified that the remarks were made &quot;in jest&quot; during an informal, off-the-record briefing. However, Barkha Dutt, an Indian journalist present at the meeting, denied this interpretation, stating that Sharif&#x27;s words had been &quot;twisted.&quot; In response to the reported comment by Sharif, then Gujarat Chief Minister and Bharatiya Janata Party member Narendra Modi criticised Sharif, stating, &quot;Nawaz Sharif, how dare you address my nation&#x27;s prime minister as a village woman? There cannot be a bigger insult of the Indian prime minister.&quot; News Broadcasters &amp; Digital Association and Indian National Congress leaders, whom Singh represented, criticised Modi for relying on reports from a Pakistani journalist.

=== 2016 Panama Papers leak ===

According to the Panama Papers, documents leaked in 2016 from law firm Mossack Fonseca, Nawaz&#x27;s family holds millions of dollars worth of property and companies in the UK and around the world. Although they do not name Nawaz Sharif or his younger brother Shehbaz Sharif, they link in-laws of Shehbaz Sharif and children of Nawaz Sharif to numerous offshore companies.

On 15 April 2016, the government announced an investigation by an inquiry commission of all Pakistanis named in the documents. Opposition politicians said a judge, not a retired judge, should investigate. Various judges recused themselves. In addition, on 19 April, army chief General Raheel Sharif warned that across-the-board accountability was needed.

The court announced its decision on 28 July 2017 and disqualified Nawaz from holding public office, stating that he had been dishonest in not disclosing his employment in the Dubai-based Capital FZE company in his nomination papers. The court also ordered National Accountability Bureau to file a reference against Nawaz and his family on corruption charges.

In 2018, the Pakistani Supreme Court ruled in &quot;Sami Ullah Baloch v. Abdul Karim Nousherwani&quot; that Nawaz would be disqualified from holding public office for life due to his involvement in the Panama Papers case of 2017. On 6 July 2018, the Federal Judicial Complex of Pakistan sentenced Nawaz to ten years in prison. Nawaz&#x27;s daughter Maryam Nawaz and her husband Safdar Awan were given prison sentences of seven years and one year, respectively. The two were subsequently arrested on their arrival in Lahore on 13 July and imprisoned in the Adiala Jail. Nawaz and Maryam were also fined £2 million and £8 million, respectively.

After Sauvé&#x27;s death, Barrette succeeded him as leader of the Union Nationale and as Premier of Quebec on January 8, 1960. He was the 18th premier of Quebec, but he held office for only six months. At the June 1960 election, he lost to Jean Lesage&#x27;s Quebec Liberal Party.

==Retirement==
He resigned as both Leader of the Union Nationale and member of the National Assembly on September 15, 1960, and later served as Canadian ambassador to Greece from April 4, 1963, to July 12, 1966. He died in 1968 in Montreal.

<text>Roger Guy Short (9 December 1944 – 20 November 2003) was a British diplomat who was killed on 20 November 2003 in a truck bombing in Istanbul while serving as the British Consul-General in Turkey. The bombing killed at least 27 people and may have been targeted directly at Short and his consul staff because they were representatives of the United Kingdom.

Born in Cape Town, South Africa, Short was educated at Malvern College and won a scholarship to read Classics at University College, Oxford. He joined the British Foreign Office in the late 1960s and was widely considered to be an expert in Turkish affairs. While he had been posted in Turkey for most of his career, he also served as commercial consul in Rio de Janeiro from 1978 to 1980, Head of Chancery and consul-general in Oslo from 1986 to 1990, the British ambassador to Bulgaria from 1994 to 1998, and Chief of Staff of the Office of the High Representative in Sarajevo from 1999 to 2000. He was made a Member of the Royal Victorian Order in 1971.

<doc id="374016" wikidata="Q728978" url="?curid=374016" title="Openbox">
<text>Openbox is a free, stacking window manager for the X Window System, licensed under the GNU General Public License. Originally derived from Blackbox 0.65.0 (a C++ project), Openbox has been completely re-written in the C programming language and since version 3.0 is no longer based upon any code from Blackbox. Since at least 2010, it has been considered feature complete, bug free and a completed project. Occasional maintenance is done to keep it working, but only if needed. 

Openbox is designed to be small, fast, and fully compliant with the Inter-Client Communication Conventions Manual (ICCCM) and Extended Window Manager Hints (EWMH). It supports many features such as menus by which the user can control applications or which display various dynamic information.

Openbox is the standard window manager in LXDE, and often set as the default for LXQt. It is used in Linux distributions such as BunsenLabs, ArchBang, Lubuntu, Trisquel and Manjaro.

The creator and primary author of Openbox is Dana Jansens of Carleton University in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada.

== Using Openbox ==
Openbox provides a right-click (or any other key-binding) &quot;root menu&quot; on the desktop, and allows users to configure the way windows are managed. When a window is minimized, it becomes invisible. To bring windows up again, most use or the &quot;Desktop menu&quot;, accessible by right-clicking. Or, sometimes, by middle-button-clicking. Extending Openbox with other small programs that add icons, taskbars, launchers, eyecandy and others is common.

== Configuration ==

There are only two configuration files, both located in . They are named and . These can either be edited manually or with the graphical configuration tools ObConf and obmenu.

All mouse and key-bindings can be configured. For example, a user can set:
* a window to go to desktop 3 when the close button is clicked with the middle mouse button
* when scrolling on an icon to move to the next/previous desktop
* raise or not raise when clicking/moving a window

== Pipe menus ==
Openbox has a dynamic menu system that uses &quot;pipe menus&quot;. A menu item in a piped menu system can accept the standard output of a shell script (or other executable) in order to generate a sub-menu. Because the script runs every time the pointer activates it, and because the script can assess environmental conditions, piped menus enable conditional branching to be built into the menu system. A static menu system as used on most window managers gets its layout once, when the window manager is restarted, and will not have the ability to modify the menu layout depending on environmental factors.

<doc id="374020" wikidata="Q2594246" url="?curid=374020" title="Paul Sauvé">
<text>Joseph-Mignault-Paul Sauvé (; March 24, 1907 – January 2, 1960) was a Canadian lawyer, World War II veteran, and politician. He was the 17th premier of Quebec in 1959 and 1960.

==Life==
Paul Sauvé was born in Saint-Benoit, Quebec, Canada to journalist and parliamentarian Arthur Sauvé and Marie-Louise Lachaîne. By 1923, his family moved to Saint-Eustache and he began his studies at the Séminaire de Ste-Thérèse and transferred to the Collège Sainte-Marie de Montréal where he graduated in 1927. Sauvé would go on to study law at the Université de Montréal, being called to the bar on July 8, 1930. In 1936, he married Luce Pelland, with whom he had three children: Luce-Paule (1937), Pierre (1938) and Ginette (1944).

== Political career ==
Arthur Sauvé, his father, had been leader of the Conservative Party during the Premiership of Liberal Louis-Alexandre Taschereau. He transferred to federal politics in 1930 and became Postmaster General in the R. B. Bennett government. Paul Sauvé then ran as a Conservative for his father&#x27;s former riding of the comté des Deux-Montagnes in the Quebec legislature in 1930, to become to the youngest elected member at the age of 23. He would be defeated in the 1935 election but re-elected in 1936 as a member of the newly formed Union Nationale, formed from a merger of his Conservatives with the bulk of the Action libérale nationale. He was then elected as Speaker to become, at the age of 29, the youngest person elected to that position.

When Canada entered the Second World War in 1939, Paul Sauvé reported to Les Fusiliers Mont-Royal, the regiment to which he belonged as a reserve officer, and served overseas in the Canadian military for the duration of the Second World War, taking part in the Battle of Normandy and in the South Beveland Campaign. In 1945, he returned from Europe and resumed his official duties with the Quebec legislature. In 1946, he became Quebec&#x27;s first Minister of Social Welfare and Youth.

Sauvé is viewed as having upheld his convictions and had not succumbed to fear of demotion by &quot;The Chief&quot; (Duplessis). Some say that he stood alone in a cabinet of &quot;yes men&quot;.

Sauvé succeeded Maurice Duplessis as leader of the Union Nationale and Premier of Quebec following Duplessis&#x27;s death on September 7, 1959; he continued to serve as his own Social Welfare and Youth Minister.

By the time he became Premier, Sauvé was well aware that he had, at most, two years before the next election. Realizing the need to modernize one of the most conservative provincial governments in Canada, he announced radical changes in the ways Quebec would be run. His resolve was conveyed in the motto he adopted: &quot;Désormais&quot; (from now on). During those &quot;100 Days Of Change,&quot; Sauvé undertook a wide-ranging review of issues facing the Quebec government, including many that had been ignored during the Duplessis era. For this reason, he was regarded by many as the actual &#x27;founder&#x27; of the Quiet Revolution.

As educational reform was seen as a means to social change and national development, Sauvé begun negotiations to recover the money Ottawa set aside for higher education, while government grants would increase towards educational institutions, no longer distributed at the government&#x27;s discretion.

Regarding Canadian federalism, the Sauvé provincial government considered that federal grants to universities encroached an area reserved exclusively for the provinces under the &quot;British North America Act, 1867&quot; (since renamed the &quot;Constitution Act, 1867&quot;). Demands were also made in respect that the provincial university education tax be deductible.

The Sauvé government also wanted to undertake an in depth study of the federal legislation regarding the federal hospital insurance system and the means for adapting it for Québec.

However, Sauvé&#x27;s tenure would be short-lived, as he himself would shortly die in office on January 2, 1960, in Saint-Eustache of a heart attack. His 117-day tenure as premier is the shortest non-interim stint in the province&#x27;s history. His death left the Union Nationale government in disarray. Less than a year later, the Union Nationale was defeated under his successor, Antonio Barrette.

==Legacy==
Paul Sauvé Arena in Montreal was named after him, and was used by the Parti Québécois for their election night rally in 1976 where they celebrated victory in the provincial election.

Elementary school Ecole Sauve in the city of Deux-Montagnes was named after him.

<doc id="374022" wikidata="Q330961" url="?curid=374022" title="Tanzimat">
<text>The  (Ottoman Turkish: تنظيمات, Turkish: Tanzimat, lit. &#x27;Reorganization&#x27;) was a period of liberal reforms in the Ottoman Empire that began with the Gülhane Edict of 1839 and ended with the First Constitutional Era in 1876. Driven by reformist statesmen such as Mustafa Reşid Pasha, Mehmed Emin Âli Pasha, and Fuad Pasha, under Sultans Abdülmecid I and Abdülaziz, the Tanzimat sought to reverse the empire&#x27;s decline by modernizing legal, military, and administrative systems while promoting Ottomanism (equality for all subjects). Though it introduced secular courts, modern education, and infrastructure like railways, the reforms faced resistance from conservative clerics, exacerbated ethnic tensions in the Balkans, and saddled the empire with crippling foreign debt. The Tanzimat’s legacy remains contested: some historians credit it with laying the groundwork for Turkish nationalism, while others argue it accelerated imperial fragmentation.

Different functions of government received reform, were completely reorganized, or started from scratch. Among institutions that received significant attention throughout this period included legislative functions, secularization, and codification of the legal system, crackdowns on the slave trade, education, property law, law enforcement, and the military. The end goal was to establish a powerful and centralized national government. Ottoman statesmen also worked with reformers of the many confessional communities of the empire, &quot;millets&quot;, to codify — and in some cases democratize — their confessional governments.

The Tanzimat built on previous reform efforts of Sultan Mahmud II. During its height, the Porte&#x27;s bureaucracy overshadowed the sultans. Leading &quot;Men of the Tanzimat&quot; included Mustafa Reşid Pasha in the period of 1839–1855, and then Mehmed Emin Âli Pasha and Keçecizade Fuad Pasha from the early 1850s to 1871. After Âli Pasha&#x27;s death, the spirit of reorganization turned towards the imperial social contract, in the form of the 1876 Ottoman Constitution, written by Midhat Pasha. The Tanzimat Period is considered to have ended with the accession of Abdul Hamid II during the Great Eastern Crisis (1875–1878). However, reform efforts continued into the Hamidian, Young Turk, and One-Party period.

== Origins and Purpose ==

The Tanzimat emerged in response to three crises: 
1. Military Weakness: Ottoman defeats in the Russo-Turkish Wars and the Greek War of Independence (1821–1830) exposed the empire’s inability to compete with European armies. 
2. Decentralization: Provincial governors (ayans) and local leaders (e.g., Muhammad Ali of Egypt) increasingly defied central authority. 
3. European Pressure: The 1838 Treaty of Balta Liman, imposed by Britain, dismantled Ottoman trade monopolies and flooded markets with European goods. 

Reformists like Mustafa Reşid Pasha, who served as ambassador to London and Paris, argued that adopting European-style institutions could restore imperial power. Their ideas crystallized in the Gülhane Edict (1839), which promised: 
- Security of life, property, and honor for all subjects. 
- Fair taxation and conscription. 
- Public trials and abolition of tax farming.

==Motives==

The ambitious project was launched to combat the slow decline of the empire that had seen its borders shrink and its strength wane in comparison to the European powers. There were both internal and external reasons for the reforms.

An important purpose of the Tanzimat was to reinforce sharia law in the Ottoman legal system. The Gülhane rescript was based on the principles of traditional court philosophy, with Butrus Abu-Manneh arguing that there was no Western influence in the edict; however, historian Stanford Jay Shaw suggests that the Gulhane Edict was directly influenced by the ideals codified by the 1789 French Declaration of the Rights of Man and the Citizen.

The primary purpose of the Tanzimat was to reform the military by modernizing and taking inspiration from European armies. The traditional Ottoman army, the Janissaries, had fallen from grace in terms of military prestige and a European-inspired reconstruction was a necessary change to be made. The Ottoman Empire consisted of a multitude of different cultures and the secondary priorities of the Tanzimat reforms were aimed at balancing the social structure that had previously favoured Muslim subjects. Another vital section of these reforms was the abolition of &quot;İltizam,&quot; or land-tenure agreements.

Internally, the Ottoman Empire hoped that abolishing the millet system would create a more centralized government, as well as increased legitimacy of the Ottoman rule, thus gaining direct control of its citizens. Another major hope was that being more open to various demographics would attract more people into the empire. There was fear of internal strife between Muslims and non-Muslims, and allowing more religious freedom to all was supposed to diminish this threat. Giving more rights to the Christians within the empire was considered likely to reduce the danger of outside intervention on their behalf.

Liberal ministers and intellectuals contributed to reform like Dimitrios Zambakos Pasha, Kabuli Mehmed Pasha, the secret society of the Young Ottomans, and Midhat Pasha. During the Great Eastern Crisis, government ministers lead by Midhat Pasha conspired to overthrow Sultan Abdul Aziz in a coup and introduce a constitution. This began the First Constitutional Era, which many historians agree represents the end of the Tanzimat, even though reform continued uninterrupted at its end in 1878, and then into the Hamidian Era.

==Reforms==
==== Legal Reforms ====
The Tanzimat introduced secular law codes to replace traditional sharia-based jurisprudence: 
- &quot;1858 Ottoman Penal Code&quot;: Modeled on France’s Napoleonic Code, it abolished punishments like limb amputation for theft, replacing them with fines and prison terms. Religious courts retained control over family law. 
- **Commercial Code (1850)**: Standardized trade laws to attract European investors but weakened Ottoman guilds, leading to artisanal protests in cities like Bursa.
=== Reforms ===
On November 3, 1839, Sultan Abdulmejid I issued a hatt-i sharif, or imperial edict, called the Edict of Gülhane. The edict gave guarantees to ensure the Ottoman subjects perfect security for their lives, honour, and property. This was followed by several statutes enacting its policies.

====Edict of of 1839====

The &quot;Hatt-ı Şerif&quot; of Gülhane, was the first major reform in the Tanzimat reforms under the government of sultan Abdulmejid and a crucial event in the movement towards secularization. The decree, named after the rosehouse () on the grounds of the Topkapi Palace, abolished tax farming. It also created a bureaucratic system of taxation with salaried tax collectors. This reflects the centralizing effects of the Tanzimat reforms. Additionally, the Edict of imposed forced military conscription within the administrative districts based on their population size.

However, the most significant clause of the decree was the one enforcing the rule of law for all subjects, including non-Muslims, by guaranteeing the right to life and property for all. This put an end to the system, which allowed the ruler&#x27;s servants to be executed or have their property confiscated at his desire. These reforms sought to establish legal and social equality for all Ottoman citizens. The reforms eliminated the &quot;millet&quot; system in the Ottoman Empire. The millet system created religiously based communities that operated autonomously, so people were organized into societies, some of them often receiving privileges. This clause terminated the privileges of these communities and constructed a society where all followed the same law.

The new reforms called for an almost complete reconstruction of public life in the Ottoman Empire. Under the reconstruction, a system of state schools was established to produce government clerics. Ottomans were encouraged to enroll. Each province was organized so that each governor would have an advisory council and specified duties in order to better serve the territory. The new reforms also called for a modern financial system with a central bank, treasury bonds and a decimal currency. Finally, the reforms implemented the expansion of roads, canals and rail lines for better communication and transportation.
====Reactions====

The reaction to the edict was not entirely positive. Christians in the Balkans refused to support the reforms because they wanted an autonomy that became more difficult to achieve under centralized power. In fact, its adoption spurred some provinces to seek independence by rebelling. It took strong British backing in maintaining Ottoman territory to ensure that the reforms were instated.

====Edict of 1856 and religious freedom====
The Reform Edict of 1856 was intended to carry out the promises of the Tanzimat. The Edict is very specific about the status of non-Muslims, making it possible &quot;to see it as the outcome of a period of religious restlessness that followed the Edict of 1839&quot;. Officially, part of the Tanzimat&#x27;s goal was to make the state intolerant to forced conversion to Islam, also making the execution of apostates from Islam illegal. Despite the official position of the state in the midst of the Tanzimat reforms, this tolerance of non-Muslims seems to have been seriously curtailed, at least until the Reform Edict of 1856. The Ottoman Empire had tried many different ways to reach out to non-Muslims. First it tried to reach out to them by giving all non-Muslims an option to apply for Dhimmi status. Having Dhimmi status gave non-Muslims the ability to live in the Ottoman Empire and own property, but this ability was not without special taxes (&quot;jizya&quot;).

For the &quot;Ottoman ruling elite, &#x27;freedom of religion&#x27; meant &#x27;freedom to defend their religion.

==== Legal Reforms ====
The Tanzimat introduced secular law codes to replace traditional sharia-based jurisprudence: 
- &quot;1858 Ottoman Penal Code&quot;: Modeled on France’s Napoleonic Code, it abolished punishments like limb amputation for theft, replacing them with fines and prison terms. Religious courts retained control over family law. 
- &quot;Commercial Code (1850)&quot;: Standardized trade laws to attract European investors but weakened Ottoman guilds, leading to artisanal protests in cities like Bursa.

== Challenges and Opposition ==
The Tanzimat reforms faced significant resistance from multiple groups and unintended consequences that undermined their goals.

=== Financial Crisis ===
Foreign loans for infrastructure (e.g., £200 million borrowed from British and French banks by 1875) led to bankruptcy in 1875. In 1881, European powers established the Ottoman Public Debt Administration to control revenue streams like tobacco taxes.

=== Ethnic and Religious Tensions ===
- **Balkan Nationalism**: Reforms failed to curb separatist movements. The 1875 Herzegovina Uprising was partly fueled by tax grievances among Christian peasants. 
- **Non-Muslim Conscription**: The 1856 Islahat Edict mandated military service for non-Muslims, but exemptions could be purchased, leading to resentment among poorer Christians.

=== Conservative Backlash ===
- **Ulema Opposition**: Conservative clerics opposed secular courts and schools, fearing erosion of Islamic authority. 
- **Muslim Resentment**: Muslim peasants and artisans resented losing tax exemptions and competing with European goods.

== Principle Men of the Tanzimat ==
==Impacts==
Although the Edict of Gülhane and the Tanzimat provided strong guidelines for society, they were not a constitution and did not replace the authority of the sultan.

Still, the Tanzimat reforms had far-reaching effects overall. Those educated in the schools established during the Tanzimat period included major personalities of the nation states that would develop from the Ottoman Empire. The system was ultimately undone by negotiations with the Great Powers following the Crimean War. As part of the Charter of 1856, European powers demanded a much stronger sovereignty for ethnic communities within the empire, differing from the Ottomans, who envisioned equality meaning identical treatment under the law for all citizens. That served to strengthen the Christian middle class, increasing their economic and political power.

The reforms peaked in 1876 with the implementation of an Ottoman constitution checking the autocratic powers of the Sultan. The details of this period are covered under the First Constitutional Era. Although the new Sultan Abdul Hamid II signed the first constitution, he quickly turned against it.

Historian Hans-Lukas Kieser has argued that the reforms led to &quot;the rhetorical promotion of equality of non-Muslims with Muslims on paper vs. the primacy of Muslims in practice&quot; (see Tanzimat Dualism); other historians have argued that the decreased ability of non-Muslims to assert their legal rights during this period led to the land seizure and emigration. Part of the reform policy was an economic policy based on the Treaty of Balta Liman of 1838. Many changes were made to improve civil liberties, but many Muslims saw them as a foreign influence on the world of Islam. That perception complicated reformist efforts made by the state. During the Tanzimat period, the government&#x27;s series of constitutional reforms led to a fairly modern conscripted army, banking system reforms, the replacement of religious law with secular law and guilds with modern factories.

Some scholars argue that from the Muslim population&#x27;s traditional Islamic view, the Tanzimat&#x27;s fundamental change regarding non-Muslims, from a status of a subjugated population (dhimmi) to that of equal subjects, was in part responsible for the Hamidian massacres and subsequent Armenian genocide. According to this view, the government&#x27;s allocation of more equality to non-Muslims conflicted with the Muslim&#x27;s population&#x27;s traditional values, thereby spurring violent reactions.
By the mid-19th century, approximately 35% of the Ottoman Empire’s population was non-Muslim.

===Effects in different provinces===
In Lebanon, the Tanzimat reforms were intended to return to the tradition of equality for all subjects before the law. However, the Sublime Porte assumed that the underlying hierarchical social order would remain unchanged. Instead, the upheavals of reform would allow for different understandings of the goals of the Tanzimat. The elites in Mount Lebanon, in fact, interpreted the Tanzimat far differently from one another, leading to ethno-religious uprisings among newly emancipated Maronites. As a result, &quot;European and Ottoman officials engaged in a contest to win the loyalty of the local inhabitants — the French by claiming to protect the Maronites; the British, the Druze; and the Ottomans by proclaiming the sultan&#x27;s benevolence toward all his religiously equal subjects.&quot;

In Palestine, land reforms, especially the change in land ownership structure via the Ottoman Land Law of 1858, allowed Russian and Yemeni Jews to buy land, thus enabling them to immigrate there under the first Aliya. In order to boost its tax base, the Ottoman state required Arabs in Palestine, as elsewhere, to register their lands for the first time. As a rule the fellahin didn&#x27;t trust the ailing regime, fearing that registration would only lead to higher taxation and conscription. Prevailing illiteracy among the fellahin meant in the end that many local mukhtars were able to collectively register village lands under their own name. Thus, they were able to later claim ownership and to sell the local peasants&#x27; lands out from under their feet to the new Jewish immigrants, as they themselves relocated permanently to Syria or Turkey. Alternately, rich Christian or Muslim families, the class of the &#x27;Effendis&#x27;, were able to accumulate large amounts of land which they exploited by themselves or sold on.

In 1863 the Armenian National Constitution was approved by the Ottoman government. The &quot;Code of Regulations&quot; consisted of 150 articles drafted by the Armenian intelligentsia and defined the powers of the Armenian Patriarch under the Ottoman millet system and the newly formed Armenian National Assembly.

== Political consequences == 
The Tanzimat reforms, though designed to stabilize and modernize the Ottoman Empire, had profound and often destabilizing political consequences that reshaped the empire’s trajectory in the 19th century. 

=== Centralization and Resistance === 
The reforms sought to centralize power in Istanbul, dismantling the autonomy of provincial elites (ayans) and religious leaders. This provoked rebellions in regions such as: 
* Bosnia Vilayet (1850–1851): Local leaders resisted Istanbul’s authority. 
* Mount Lebanon Mutasarrifate (1860 Druze–Maronite conflict): Religious and local factions rejected Ottoman rule. 

Even efforts to modernize infrastructure, such as railways, were perceived as tools of imperial control, deepening distrust in the provinces. 

=== Fragmentation of Ottoman Identity === 
While the Tanzimat promoted Ottomanism (equality for all subjects regardless of religion), it inadvertently accelerated ethnic and religious separatism. In the Balkans, Christian communities leveraged new legal rights to demand autonomy, culminating in: 
* The 1875 Herzegovina Uprising 
* The 1877–1878 Russo-Turkish War 

Conversely, Muslim elites resented perceived Christian favoritism, fueling pan-Islamic movements under Sultan Abdul Hamid II (r. 1876–1909). 

=== Foreign Exploitation and Territorial Loss === 
European powers exploited the Tanzimat’s rhetoric of minority rights to justify intervention. The Treaty of Berlin (1878), following the Ottoman defeat in the Russo-Turkish War, formalized the loss of: 
* Bulgaria 
* Bosnia 
* Cyprus 

Additionally, France and Britain gained oversight over Ottoman reforms, further undermining imperial sovereignty. 

=== Internal Power Struggles === 
Reformist bureaucrats, such as the Young Ottomans, clashed with conservative clerics and Sultan Abdulaziz (r. 1861–1876), who suspended the 1876 Constitution within two years. This cycle of reform and repression radicalized factions like the Committee of Union and Progress (Young Turks), whose 1908 revolution ended Abdul Hamid II’s autocracy but failed to salvage the empire. 

=== Scholarly Perspectives === 
Zeynep Çelik summarizes the Tanzimat’s paradox: 
&quot;From 1838 to 1908, the Ottoman Empire staged its final but doomed struggle for survival. The Tanzimat’s dual allegiance to Western progress and Islamic tradition left it alienating both reformers and traditionalists, accelerating its disintegration.&quot;

<doc id="374025" wikidata="Q29253" url="?curid=374025" title="Fatalism">
<text>Fatalism is a belief and philosophical doctrine which considers the entire universe as a deterministic system and stresses the subjugation of all events, actions, and behaviors to fate or destiny, which is commonly associated with the consequent attitude of resignation in the face of future events which are thought to be inevitable and outside of human control.

==Definition==
The term &quot;fatalism&quot; can refer to any of the following ideas:
* Broadly, any view according to which human beings are powerless to do anything other than what they actually do. Included in this is the belief that all events are decided by fate and are outside human control, hence humans have no power to influence the future or indeed the outcome of their own thoughts and actions.
More specifically:
* Theological fatalism, according to which free will is incompatible with the existence of an omniscient God who has foreknowledge of all future events. This is very similar to theological determinism.
* Logical fatalism, according to which propositions about the future which we take to currently be either true or false can only be true or false if future events are already determined.
* Causal determinism, which is usually treated as distinct from fatalism, on the grounds that it requires only the determination of each &quot;successive&quot; state in a system by that system&#x27;s prior state, rather than the &quot;final&quot; state of a system being predetermined.
* The view that the appropriate reaction to the inevitability of some future event is acceptance or resignation, rather than resistance. For instance, 19th-century German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche discusses what he calls &quot;Turkish fatalism&quot; (&quot;Türkenfatalismus&quot;) in his essay &quot;The Wanderer and His Shadow&quot; (1880), where he makes no distinction between the terms &quot;fate&quot; and &quot;fatalism&quot;. This view is closer to everyday use of the word &quot;fatalism&quot; and parallels defeatism.

==Religion==
Throughout history, the belief that the entire universe is a deterministic system subject to the will of fate or destiny has been articulated in both Eastern and Western religions, philosophy, music, and literature.

The ancient Arabs that inhabited the Arabian Peninsula before the advent of Islam used to profess a widespread belief in fatalism (&quot;ḳadar&quot;) alongside a fearful consideration for the sky and the stars as divine beings, which they held to be ultimately responsible for every phenomenon that occurs on Earth and for the destiny of humankind. Accordingly, they shaped their entire lives in accordance with their interpretations of astral configurations and phenomena.

In the &quot;I Ching&quot; and philosophical Taoism, the ebb and flow of favorable and unfavorable conditions suggests the path of least resistance is effortless (&quot;see&quot;: Wu wei). In the philosophical schools of the Indian Subcontinent, the concept of &quot;karma&quot; deals with similar philosophical issues to the Western concept of determinism. Karma is understood as a spiritual mechanism which causes the eternal cycle of birth, death, and rebirth (&quot;saṃsāra&quot;). Karma, either positive or negative, accumulates according to an individual&#x27;s actions throughout their life, and at their death determines the nature of their next life in the cycle of Saṃsāra. Most major religions originating in India hold this belief to some degree, most notably Hinduism, Jainism, Sikhism, and Buddhism.

The views on the interaction of karma and free will are numerous, and diverge from each other greatly. For example, in Sikhism, god&#x27;s grace, gained through worship, can erase one&#x27;s karmic debts, a belief which reconciles the principle of karma with a monotheistic god one must freely choose to worship. Jainists believe in a sort of compatibilism, in which the cycle of Saṃsara is a completely mechanistic process, occurring without any divine intervention. The Jains hold an atomic view of reality, in which particles of karma form the fundamental microscopic building material of the universe.

===Ājīvika===
In ancient India, the Ājīvika school of philosophy founded by Makkhali Gosāla (around 500 BCE), otherwise referred to as &quot;Ājīvikism&quot; in Western scholarship, upheld the &quot;Niyati&quot; (&quot;Fate&quot;) doctrine of absolute fatalism or determinism, which negates the existence of free will and &quot;karma&quot;, and is therefore considered one of the &quot;nāstika&quot; or &quot;heterodox&quot; schools of Indian philosophy. The oldest descriptions of the Ājīvika fatalists and their founder Gosāla can be found both in the Buddhist and Jaina scriptures of ancient India. The predetermined fate of all sentient beings and the impossibility to achieve liberation (&quot;mokṣa&quot;) from the eternal cycle of birth, death, and rebirth (&quot;saṃsāra&quot;) was the major distinctive philosophical and metaphysical doctrine of this heterodox school of Indian philosophy, annoverated among the other &quot;Śramaṇa&quot; movements that emerged in India during the Second urbanization (600–200 BCE).

===Buddhism===


Buddhist philosophy contains several concepts which some scholars describe as deterministic to various levels. However, the direct analysis of Buddhist metaphysics through the lens of determinism is difficult, due to the differences between European and Buddhist traditions of thought.

One concept which is argued to support a hard determinism is the doctrine of dependent origination (&quot;pratītyasamutpāda&quot;) in the early Buddhist texts, which states that all phenomena (&quot;dharma&quot;) are necessarily caused by some other phenomenon, which it can be said to be &quot;dependent&quot; on, like links in a massive, never-ending chain; the basic principle is that all things (dharmas, phenomena, principles) arise in dependence upon other things, which means that they are fundamentally &quot;empty&quot; or devoid of any intrinsic, eternal essence and therefore are impermanent. In traditional Buddhist philosophy, this concept is used to explain the functioning of the eternal cycle of birth, death, and rebirth (&quot;saṃsāra&quot;); all thoughts and actions exert a karmic force that attaches to the individual&#x27;s consciousness, which will manifest through reincarnation and results in future lives. In other words, righteous or unrighteous actions in one life will necessarily cause good or bad responses in another future life or more lives. The early Buddhist texts and later Tibetan Buddhist scriptures associate dependent arising with the fundamental Buddhist doctrines of emptiness (&quot;śūnyatā&quot;) and non-self (&quot;anattā&quot;).

Another Buddhist concept which many scholars perceive to be deterministic is the doctrine of non-self (&quot;anattā&quot;). In Buddhism, attaining enlightenment involves one realizing that neither in humans nor any other sentient beings there is a fundamental core of permanent being, identity, or personality which can be called the &quot;soul&quot;, and that all sentient beings (including humans) are instead made of several, constantly changing factors which bind them to the eternal cycle of birth, death, and rebirth (&quot;saṃsāra&quot;). Sentient beings are composed of the five aggregates of existence (&quot;skandha&quot;): matter, sensation, perception, mental formations, and consciousness. In the &quot;Saṃyutta Nikāya&quot; of the Pāli Canon, the historical Buddha is recorded as saying that &quot;just as the word &#x27;chariot&#x27; exists on the basis of the aggregation of parts, even so the concept of &#x27;being&#x27; exists when the five aggregates are available.&quot; The early Buddhist texts outline different ways in which dependent origination is a middle way between different sets of &quot;extreme&quot; views (such as &quot;monist&quot; and &quot;pluralist&quot; ontologies or materialist and dualist views of mind-body relation). In the &quot;Kaccānagotta Sutta&quot; of the Pāli Canon (SN 12.15, parallel at SA 301), the historical Buddha stated that &quot;this world mostly relies on the dual notions of existence and non-existence&quot; and then explains the right view as follows:
Some Western scholars argue that the concept of non-self necessarily disproves the ideas of free will and moral responsibility. If there is no autonomous self, in this view, and all events are necessarily and unchangeably caused by others, then no type of autonomy can be said to exist, moral or otherwise. However, other scholars disagree, claiming that the Buddhist conception of the universe allows for a form of compatibilism. Buddhism perceives reality occurring on two different levels: the ultimate reality, which can only be truly understood by the enlightened ones, and the illusory or false reality of the material world, which is considered to be &quot;real&quot; or &quot;true&quot; by those who are ignorant about the nature of metaphysical reality; i.e., those who still haven&#x27;t achieved enlightenment. Therefore, Buddhism perceives free will as a notion belonging to the illusory belief in the unchanging self or personhood that pertains to the false reality of the material world, while concepts like non-self and dependent origination belong to the ultimate reality; the transition between the two can be truly understood, Buddhists claim, by one who has attained enlightenment.

==Determinism and predeterminism==
While the terms are sometimes used interchangeably, fatalism, determinism, and predeterminism are distinct, as each emphasizes a different aspect of the futility of human will or the foreordination of destiny. However, all these doctrines share common ground.

&quot;Determinists&quot; generally agree that human actions affect the future but that human action is itself determined by a causal chain of prior events. Their view does not accentuate a &quot;submission&quot; to fate or destiny, whereas &quot;fatalists&quot; stress an acceptance of future events as inevitable. Determinists believe the future is fixed specifically due to causality; fatalists and predeterminists believe that some or all aspects of the future are inescapable but, for fatalists, not necessarily due to causality.

Fatalism is a looser term than determinism. The presence of historical &quot;indeterminisms&quot; or chances, i.e. events that could not be predicted by sole knowledge of other events, is an idea still compatible with fatalism. Necessity (such as a law of nature) will happen just as inevitably as a chance—both can be imagined as sovereign. This idea has roots in Aristotle&#x27;s work, &quot;De interpretatione&quot;.

Theological fatalism is the thesis that infallible foreknowledge of a human act makes the act necessary and hence unfree. If there is a being who knows the entire future infallibly, then no human act is free. The early Islamic philosopher, Al Farabi, makes the case that if God does in fact know all human actions and choices, then Aristotle&#x27;s original solution to this dilemma stands.

==Idle argument==
One famous ancient argument regarding fatalism was the so-called &quot;Idle Argument&quot;. It argues that if something is fated, then it would be pointless or futile to make any effort to bring it about. The Idle Argument was described by Origen and Cicero and it went like this:

*If it is fated for you to recover from this illness, then you will recover whether you call a doctor or not.
*Likewise, if you are fated not to recover, you will not do so whether you call a doctor or not.
*But either it is fated that you will recover from this illness, or it is fated that you will not recover.
*Therefore, it is futile to consult a doctor.

The Idle Argument was anticipated by Aristotle in his &quot;De Interpretatione&quot; chapter 9. The Stoics considered it to be a sophism and the Stoic Chrysippus attempted to refute it by pointing out that consulting the doctor would be as much fated as recovering. He seems to have introduced the idea that in cases like that at issue two events can be &quot;co-fated&quot;, so that one cannot occur without the other.

==Logical fatalism and the argument from bivalence==
The main argument for logical fatalism goes back to antiquity. This is an argument that depends not on causation or physical circumstances but rather is based on presumed logical truths. There are numerous versions of this argument, including those by Aristotle and Richard Taylor. These arguments have been objected to and elaborated on with some effect.

The key idea of logical fatalism is that there is a body of true propositions (statements) about what is going to happen, and these are true regardless of when they are made. So, for example, if it is true today that tomorrow there will be a sea battle, then there cannot fail to be a sea battle tomorrow, since otherwise it would not be true today that such a battle will take place tomorrow.

The argument relies on applying principle of bivalence to future contingents, regarding that a statement about the future is either true or false. However, this does not apply if the future is considered to be undetermined meaning that the truth value of a statement can only be determined once the event occurs.

==Criticism==
===Semantic equivocation===
One criticism comes from the novelist David Foster Wallace, who in a 1985 paper &quot;Richard Taylor&#x27;s &quot;Fatalism&quot; and the Semantics of Physical Modality&quot; suggests that Taylor reached his conclusion of fatalism only because his argument involved two different and inconsistent notions of impossibility. Wallace did not reject fatalism &quot;per se&quot;, as he wrote in his closing passage, &quot;if Taylor and the fatalists want to force upon us a metaphysical conclusion, they must do metaphysics, not semantics. And this seems entirely appropriate.&quot; Willem deVries and Jay Garfield, both of whom were advisers on Wallace&#x27;s thesis, expressed regret that Wallace never published his argument. In 2010, the thesis was, however, published posthumously as &quot;Time, Fate, and Language: An Essay on Free Will&quot;.

<text>Joseph-Adélard Godbout (September 24, 1892 – September 18, 1956) was a Canadian agronomist and politician. He served as the 15th premier of Quebec briefly in 1936, and again from 1939 to 1944. He served as leader of the Parti Libéral du Québec (PLQ).

==Youth and early career==

Adélard Godbout was born in Saint-Éloi. He was the son of Eugène Godbout, agriculturalist and Liberal Member of the Legislative Assembly (MLA) from 1921 to 1923, and Marie-Louise Duret. He studied at the Séminaire de Rimouski, the agricultural school of Sainte-Anne-de-la-Pocatière and the Massachusetts Agricultural College, in the U.S. state of Massachusetts. He then became teacher at the Sainte-Anne-de-la-Pocatière agricultural school from 1918 to 1930. He was an agronomist for the Ministry of Agriculture from 1922 to 1925.

==Political career==
===Member of the legislature===

Godbout became a Member of the legislature for the district of L&#x27;Islet in the Chaudière-Appalaches area, after he won a by-election without opposition on May 13, 1929. He was re-elected in the 1931 and 1935 elections.

===Cabinet Minister===

Godbout was appointed to the Cabinet by Premier Alexandre Taschereau and served as Minister of Agriculture from November 27, 1930, to June 27, 1936.

===First Premiership===

Shortly after the 1935 election, Conservative Leader Maurice Duplessis, a rising star in Québec politics, forced Taschereau to call the Standing Committee on Public Accounts, which brought to light the existence of widespread corruption in the provincial government. The revelations made by the committee were embarrassing for several Liberal insiders. On June 11, 1936, less than a year after being put back in office, Taschereau resigned. He recommended to Lieutenant Governor Ésioff-Léon Patenaude the names of Édouard Lacroix and Adélard Godbout for his successor as Premier. Following constitutional conventions, the lieutenant governor offered the opportunity to form a government to Lacroix, who declined. He then made the offer to Godbout, who accepted. With the blessing of federal Cabinet Members, he took over Taschereau&#x27;s job as Liberal Leader and Premier of Québec. Godbout formed his first government and an election was called for August 1936.

Godbout had remained untouched by the scandals. But despite Godbout&#x27;s talks of &quot;a new order&quot; in an effort to distance himself from the Taschereau era, his first government lasted only two months, as his party suffered a humiliating defeat in the 1936 election. Led by Duplessis, the recently created Union nationale was put in office. The Liberals were reduced to 14 seats. Godbout lost re-election in his own district of L&#x27;Islet. He remained Liberal Leader after being reconfirmed at the 1938 party leadership convention, but T.-D. Bouchard led the parliamentary wing of the party until the 1939 election.

===Second Premiership===
World War II created the opportunity that Godbout needed to make a political comeback. An early provincial general election was called in 1939 and federal Cabinet member Ernest Lapointe, the Quebec lieutenant of Prime Minister Mackenzie King, took the stump for Godbout. He guaranteed that no one would face conscription if voters supported the Liberals. Lapointe would die of cancer in 1941.

Through the campaign, Godbout relentlessly repeated the formal promise : &quot;The government will never declare military conscription. I undertake, on my honour, weighing each of my words, to leave my party and even to fight against it, if even one French Canadian, before the end of the hostilities in Europe, is mobilized against his will under a Liberal government.&quot; Their promise would soon haunt Liberal politicians.

In the meantime though, Godbout made a spectacular comeback. He and 69 of his candidates were sent to the legislature. Godbout formed his second government, where he would serve as Premier and as minister of Agriculture.

Under Godbout&#x27;s premiership, the provincial government implemented a number of significant progressive legislations, laying the groundwork for the Quiet Revolution that would be implemented by the government of Premier Jean Lesage a couple of decades later. In fact, the Liberal administration delivered many of the proposals made by Paul Gouin&#x27;s Action libérale nationale in 1935.

While Premier of Québec, Godbout published an article entitled &quot;Canada: Unity in Diversity&quot; (1943) in the Council on Foreign Relations journal. He asked, &quot;How does the dual relationship of the French Canadians make them an element of strength and order, and therefore of unity, in our joint civilization, which necessarily includes not only Canada and the British Commonwealth of Nations, but also the United States, the Latin republics of America and liberated France?&quot;

====Accomplishments====
These measures include:
#the enactment of the right to vote for women in 1940, despite resistance from Duplessis and the Catholic Church;
#the establishment of a Civil Service Commission in 1943;
#the passage of an act that enforced compulsory school attendance until the age of 14 and the introduction of free education in primary schools in 1943;
#the adoption of a Labour Code that established principles governing union certification and the negotiation of collective agreements in 1944;
#the nationalization of the Montreal Light, Heat &amp; Power Company, a private corporation who had a monopoly on gas and electric light in the Montreal area, which led to the creation of Hydro-Québec in 1944.
#encouragement of French culture and language

====Relations with the Dominion government====

Because he served during wartime and dealt with Dominion (federal) politicians who believed in a strong Dominion government, Godbout was forced to abandon a number of traditional provincial jurisdictions. The most notable prerogatives that he surrendered to the Government of Canada include:
#the opportunity to create and oversight a provincial unemployment insurance system (a nationwide program was put into action in 1940);
#the power to tax the income of individuals and corporations, in exchange for a much more modest financial compensation from the federal government. (Almost simultaneously, the federal government of Australia usurped state governments&#x27; tax powers.)

In a 1942 plebiscite, Canadian voters were asked to release the federal government from its commitment made to the Québec voters not to declare military conscription. While the majority of predominantly French-speaking Québec refused to support such a release, English-speakers throughout Canada mostly did support it. Even though not that many people were forced to serve until the end of the war, the decision made by Mackenzie King to allow conscription (when both he and Godbout had specifically ruled out conscription earlier) was very unpopular in Québec. Duplessis, whose criticism of the federal encroachments upon the constitutional autonomy of the provinces capitalized on the Québec population&#x27;s general mistrust of the federal government, had a field day.

===Opposition Leader===

In the 1944 provincial election, Godbout&#x27;s Liberals and Duplessis&#x27; Union Nationale received similar shares of the popular vote, the Liberals getting slightly more votes but the UN enjoying a level of support in the province&#x27;s rural areas that was strong enough to win a majority of seats to the legislature and thus form the government. During the 1944 election, Duplessis claimed in a very anti-Semitic speech that Godbout had together with the Dominion government agreed to take in 100,000 Jewish refugees and settle them in Quebec after the war in exchange for which the &quot;International Zionist Brotherhood&quot; was funding his reelection campaign. Duplessis claimed that he would never take money from the Jews, and if were elected Premier again, he would stop this alleged plan to settle 100,000 Jewish refugees in Quebec. Through this story was entirely false, it was widely believed, sparking such a surge of antisemitism to allow the &quot;Union Nationale&quot; to win.

Godbout served as Leader of the Opposition until the 1948 election. Benefiting from post-war prosperity, the Union Nationale won an overwhelming majority. The Liberals won only eight seats, six of whom were located on the Montreal Island. Once again, Godbout narrowly lost re-election in his home district of L&#x27;Islet. In 1950, he relinquished the leadership of the Liberal Party to Georges-Émile Lapalme.

===Senator===

In 1949, Godbout was appointed to the Senate of Canada on the recommendation of Canadian Prime Minister Louis St. Laurent. He remained a senator until his death in 1956. His wife died in 1969 aged 79.

===Legacy===

Observers are divided about the significance of Godbout&#x27;s legacy. Lacking the oratory skills of Duplessis, his main political competitor, Godbout is sometimes judged very severely.

Federalists stress the importance progressive precedents that were set under Godbout&#x27;s premiership.

Autonomists on the other hand criticize him for taking a weak stance in the matters of the province&#x27;s autonomy.

More nuanced analysis claim that, being in power during World War II, he served in a difficult time, despite the shortcomings of his relations with the federal government.

In his 2000 film entitled &quot;Traître ou Patriote&quot;, filmmaker Jacques Godbout, Adélard&#x27;s nephew, lamented what he perceived as a lack of public knowledge about his uncle&#x27;s work and premiership.

On September 27, 2007, in a ceremony attended by Premier Jean Charest, a former electrical power station in Montréal, at the corner of Wellington and Queen streets, known as Poste Central-1 was named in honour of Godbout. A bust of Godbout by sculptor Joseph-Émile Brunet (1893–1977) has been installed at the site.

For his contribution to the field of agriculture and the advancement or rural Quebec in general, Mr. Godbout was posthumously inducted to Canadian Agricultural Hall of Fame in 1962 and to the Agricultural Hall of Fame of Quebec in 1992.

===Elections as party leader===

He lost the 1936 election, won the 1939 election, lost the 1944 election and lost the 1948 election.

<doc id="374031" wikidata="Q659859" url="?curid=374031" title="V-tail">
<text>The V-tail or &quot;vee-tail&quot; (sometimes called a butterfly tail or Rudlicki&#x27;s V-tail) of an aircraft is an unconventional arrangement of the tail control surfaces that replaces the traditional vertical and horizontal surfaces with two surfaces set in a V-shaped configuration. It is not widely used in aircraft design. The aft edge of each twin surface is a hinged control surface called a ruddervator, which combines the functions of both a rudder and elevator.

==History==
The V-tail was invented in 1930 by Polish engineer Jerzy Rudlicki and was tested for the first time on a Hanriot HD.28 trainer, modified by Polish aerospace manufacturer Plage and Laśkiewicz in the summer of 1931.

==Variants==
The X-shaped tail surfaces of the experimental Lockheed XFV were essentially a V tail that extended both above and below the fuselage.

=== Conventional ===
The most popular conventionally V-tailed aircraft that has been mass-produced is the Beechcraft Bonanza Model 35, often known as the &quot;V-tail Bonanza&quot; or simply &quot;V-Tail&quot;. Other examples include the Lockheed F-117 Nighthawk stealth attack aircraft and the Fouga CM.170 Magister trainer. The Cirrus Vision SF50 jet is a recent example of a civilian aircraft adopting the V-tail. Some gliders, like the Lehtovaara PIK-16 Vasama, were designed with a V-tail, but the production Vasamas had a cruciform tail.

===Inverted===
The Blohm &amp; Voss P 213 &quot;Miniaturjäger&quot; was one of the first aircraft to have an inverted V-tail. Unmanned aerial vehicles such as the LSI Amber, General Atomics Gnat and General Atomics MQ-1 Predator would later feature this type of tail. The Ultraflight Lazair ultralights, of which over 2,000 were produced, featured an inverted V-tail, which also carried the rear landing gear.

==Advantages==
Ideally, with fewer surfaces than a conventional three-aerofoil tail or a T-tail, the V-tail is lighter and has less wetted surface area, so thus produces less induced and parasitic drag. However, NACA studies indicated that the V-tail surfaces must be larger than simple projection into the vertical and horizontal planes would suggest, such that total wetted area is roughly constant; reduction of intersection surfaces from three to two does, however, produce a net reduction in drag through elimination of some interference drag.

Light jet aircraft such as the Cirrus Vision SF50, the Eclipse 400, the Sonex SubSonex or larger jet aircraft, such as the Northrop Grumman RQ-4 Global Hawk unmanned aerial drone often have the power plant placed outside the aircraft. In such cases V-tails are used to avoid placing the vertical stabilizer in the exhaust of the engine, which would disrupt the flow of the exhaust, reducing thrust and increasing wear on the stabilizer, possibly leading to damage over time.

In military aircraft, V-tails reduce the number of right angles on an aircraft, improving its stealth characteristics.

==Disadvantages==
In the mid-1980s, the Federal Aviation Administration re-assessed the Beechcraft Bonanza due to safety concerns. While the Bonanza met the initial certification requirements, it had a history of fatal mid-air breakups during extreme stress, at a rate exceeding the accepted norm. The type was deemed airworthy and restrictions removed after Beechcraft issued a structural modification as an Airworthiness Directive.

V-tailed aircraft require longer rear fuselages than aircraft with conventional empennages to prevent yawing. This tendency, called &quot;snaking&quot;, was apparent on taking off and landing on the Fouga CM.170 Magister, which has a relatively short fuselage.

==Ruddervators==

Ruddervators are the control surfaces on an airplane with a V-tail configuration. They are located at the trailing edge of each of the two airfoils making up the tail of the plane. The first use of ruddervators may have been on the Coandă-1910&#x27;s X-tail, although there is no proof that the aircraft ever flew. The later Coandă-1911 flew with ruddervators on its X-tail. Later Polish engineer Jerzy Rudlicki designed the first practical ruddervators in 1930, tested on a modified Hanriot HD.28 trainer in 1931.

The name is a portmanteau of &quot;rudder&quot; and &quot;elevator.&quot; In a conventional aircraft tail configuration, the rudder provides yaw (horizontal) control and the elevator provides pitch (vertical) control.

Ruddervators provide the same control effect as conventional control surfaces, but through a more complex control system that actuates the control surfaces in unison. Yaw moving the nose to the left is produced on an upright V tail by moving the pedals left which deflects the left-hand ruddervator down and left and the right-hand ruddervator up and left. The opposite produces yaw to the right. Pitch nose up is produced by moving the control column or stick back which deflects the left-hand ruddervator up and right and the right-hand ruddervator up and left. Pitch nose down is produced by moving the control column or stick forward which induces the opposite ruddervator movements.

<doc id="374039" wikidata="Q853958" url="?curid=374039" title="NTT Docomo">
<text>, also known as , is a Japanese mobile phone operator owned by the Nippon Telegraph and Telephone (NTT). The name is officially an abbreviation of the phrase, &quot;do communications over the mobile network&quot;, and is also from a compound word dokomo, meaning &quot;everywhere&quot; in Japanese. The company is headquartered in Sanno Park Tower, Nagatachō, Chiyoda, Tokyo. Docomo provides phone, video phone (FOMA and some PHS), i-mode (internet), and mail (i-mode mail, Short Mail, and SMS) services. It is the largest wireless carrier in Japan, with 82.632 million subscribers .

Docomo was spun off from NTT in August 1991 to take over the mobile cellular operations. NTT held a majority stake in the company until Docomo&#x27;s re-privatization in 2020.

It provides 2G (mova) PDC cellular services, 3G (FOMA) W-CDMA, 4G LTE and 5G NR services. Its businesses also included PHS (Paldio), paging, and satellite. Docomo ceased offering a PHS service on January 7, 2008. In late 2020, Docomo was bought back by NTT for about $40 billion.

== Customers ==
NTT Docomo is a subsidiary of Japan&#x27;s incumbent telephone operator, NTT. The majority of NTT Docomo&#x27;s shares are owned by NTT (which is 33.71% government-owned). While some NTT shares are publicly traded, control of the company by Japanese interests (government and civilian) is guaranteed by the number of shares available to buyers. It provides wireless voice and data communications to subscribers in Japan. NTT Docomo is the creator of W-CDMA technology as well as mobile i-mode service.

NTT Docomo had over 53 million customers (as of March 2008), which is more than half of Japan&#x27;s cellular market. The company provides a wide variety of mobile multimedia services. These include i-mode which provides e-mail and internet access to over 50 million subscribers, FOMA, which was launched in 2001 as the world&#x27;s first 3G mobile service based on W-CDMA, Xi, a 4G LTE mobile service which was launched on December 24, 2010, Premium 4G, a LTE Advanced service which was launched on March 27, 2015, and DoCoMo 5G, a 5G NR service which launched on March 25, 2020.

In addition to wholly owned subsidiaries in Europe and North America, the company is expanding its global reach through strategic alliances with mobile and multimedia service providers in Asia-Pacific and Europe. NTT Docomo is listed on the Tokyo (9437), London (NDCM), and New York (DCM) stock exchanges.

On April 19, 2008, it was announced that Ryuji Yamada, the co-president of NTT Docomo, would be promoted to president of NTT Docomo in June 2008. Masao Nakamura would stay in NTT Docomo as a director and also the senior adviser. Since the introduction in October 2006 of the service that allows a user to take their original phone number to a new provider, NTT Docomo has lost many users to KDDI and SoftBank. This promotion was made in order to get more users for NTT Docomo. The company was the last major global mobile carrier to offer Apple&#x27;s iPhone, which it finally did with the release of the iPhone 5s and 5c. This has been cited as one of the reasons for the steady stream of its customers switching to competing networks.

In June 2011, the company announced that they were teaming up with McAfee to provide McAfee VirusScan Mobile for its Android mobile users. In July 2012, NTT Docomo acquired Italy&#x27;s Buongiorno in a deal worth 209 million euros.

== Research and development ==
In October 2007, Docomo and Mitsubishi Electric showcased a prototype mobile phone at the CEATEC trade show. The phone checked health by tracking body movement and measuring calories, and included a breath analyzer. On January 24, 2008, NTT Docomo announced a partnership with Google, which allowed all models after the FOMA904i models to view YouTube videos. In 2008, NTT Docomo became a founding member of the Symbian Foundation.

In May 2017, Docomo launched 5G trial networks at Aomi, Odaiba (Tokyo Waterfront City) and the area around Tokyo Skytree. It commercially launched its 5G network on March 25, 2020, making it the first Japanese operator to do so, and making Japan among the first country in the world to launch 5G.

In August 2021, Docomo and Airbus demonstrated a solar-powered Zephyr High Altitude Platform Station (HAPS) for use with 5G and 6G technology. The trial took place in the United States over 18 days, and involved flying in the stratosphere and transmitting data at various speeds up to a distance of 140 km. If successful, then Docomo and Airbus would be able to provide communication services to remote islands, mountainous areas, and to remote sea lanes.

== Earthquake warning system ==
From 2008, Docomo began offering a service called the &quot;Area Mail Disaster Information Service&quot; which broadcasts Earthquake Early Warning messages produced by the Japan Meteorological Agency to its subscribers with compatible handsets. This service is provided free of charge and messages are limited to those areas affected by each particular alert. These alerts have a unique ring tone so they can be easily distinguished from incoming calls or messages.

== Civil protection system ==
From 2014, under Civil Protection Law of Japan, Docomo began offering a service called the &quot;Area Mail Disaster and Evacuation Information Service&quot; which broadcasts J-Alert messages (including Earthquake Early Warning) produced by the Japan Fire and Disaster Management Agency to its subscribers with compatible handsets (e.g. Sony XPERIA, iPhone 5s, Samsung Galaxy).

The message is broadcast when threats are imminent (e.g. North Korea&#x27;s ballistic missile launching, terrorist attack to nuclear power plant, volcanic eruptions, or an approaching tsunami.)

== Mascot ==

Since 2005, the company&#x27;s mascot is Docomodake, a mushroom, which is quite a celebrity in Japan. He is even the hero of a Nintendo DS puzzle and platforming video game, &quot;Boing! Docomodake DS&quot;, released in Japan, the North America and Europe. He also has a wide variety of merchandising such as cell phone straps, keychains, and plush dolls. As one type of advertising method, there are many types of Docomodakes such as Mother and Father, which symbolize the plans that NTT Docomo offers.

==Emoji==
Shigetaka Kurita, who was part of the team working on NTT DoCoMo&#x27;s i-mode mobile Internet platform, that has been credited as the first creator of emoji. However, SoftBank released their emoji set on the DP-211SW mobile phone in 1997.

Copyright ownership of an emoji typically belongs to the company or organization that created it. For example, the copyright for Apple&#x27;s emoji designs belongs to Apple Inc. Similarly, the copyright for emoji used on platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, and WhatsApp belong to the respective companies.

Emoji are standardized through the Unicode Consortium, which sets standards for how emoji should look and what they should represent. However, individual companies and platforms can still design their own variations of emoji within those standards.

== Investments outside Japan ==

NTT Docomo has a wide range of foreign investments. However, NTT Docomo was not successful in investing in foreign carriers. Docomo had invested very large multibillion-dollar amounts in KPN, KT Freetel, AT&amp;T Wireless, and had to write-off sell all these investments in foreign carriers. As a result, Docomo booked a total of about US$10 billion in losses, while during the same time Docomo&#x27;s Japan operations were profitable.

In December 2007, NTT Docomo and KT Freetel jointly invested US$200 million for a total of 33% stake in U Mobile Malaysia.

In June 2008 NTT Docomo joined the non-profit Symbian Foundation led by Nokia to co-develop a new Symbian smartphone operating system based on the S60 platform, which resulted in Symbian^2 for the Japanese market.

In December 2006 they acquired Guamcell, the largest phone company in Guam, and changed its name to DOCOMO PACIFIC.

Docomo is working on implementing its FeliCa-based payment system, called iD, overseas. It has already launched the system in Guam, as well as Shanghai and Beijing, China (however, as of November 2010, it has withdrawn iD terminals from all merchants in China).

== Docomo Capital ==
Working closely with NTT Docomo&#x27;s business and R&amp;D divisions, Docomo Capital is in charge of NTT Docomo&#x27;s venture investments in mobile related start-up companies, mainly in the United States and has committed $100M in capital. It has invested in Cooliris, Couchbase, Evernote, Fab.com, HighlightCam, Swype, TuneWiki, and Sigfox.

== Docomo Digital ==
Docomo Digital is the international payments business of NTT DOCOMO. DOCOMO Digital partners with carriers, merchants, OTT services, app stores and payment providers in both developed and emerging markets to facilitate direct carrier billing and other payments such as e-wallets. Sold to Bango plc August 2022. 

== Hikari TV ==
 is a Japanese IPTV service. It was established on March 31, 2008, and was originally owned and operated by the internet service provider NTT Plala. It launched Hikari TV Game, the first cloud gaming service for televisions in Japan, in 2013.

On July 1, 2022, NTT Docomo absorbed and merged the operating company NTT Plala, and on the same day, this service was also incorporated into NTT DoCoMo&#x27;s service. Along with this, the rate plan for new subscribers was changed after the same day.

Aside from offering access to various television channels, Hikari TV also produces its own content, primarily broadcast on the .

== Various problems and scandals ==

=== Problems with installation and construction of base stations ===
*In June 2005, the construction of a base station in Ikeda, Osaka, began without the required paperwork and destroyed the Furue Tomb.
*In June 2006, it was discovered that a base station installed in Arashiyama, Kyoto in 1999 had not been notified in advance under the Cultural Heritage Protection Law.
*In June 2008, it was discovered that a base station in the Hirao district of Nagashima-cho, Izumi County, Kagoshima Prefecture, had been installed without a permit in Unzen Amakusa National Park in 2006.
Both of these base stations were removed or relocated after the problem was discovered.

<text>Corkscrew Swamp Sanctuary is a National Audubon Society sanctuary located in southwest Florida, north of Naples, Florida and east of Bonita Springs, in the United States. The sanctuary was established to protect one of the largest remaining stands of bald cypress (&quot;Taxodium distichum&quot;) and pond cypress (&quot;T. ascendens&quot;) in North America from extensive logging that was ongoing throughout the 1940s and 1950s.

==History==

The Corkscrew Cypress Rookery Association was formed in 1954 to protect the area. The National Audubon Society accepted responsibility for management and started constructing the first boardwalk through the swamp in 1955. In all, nearly of wetland was purchased or donated, most of it from or by the owners, Lee Tidewater Cypress Center Co. and Collier Enterprises. Some of the funding that went to preserving the wetland was donated by Theodore Miller Edison, youngest son of the inventor Thomas Edison.

In 2018, researchers at the Sanctuary determined that beginning around the year 2000, the amount of groundwater in the park began to diminish. Records have been kept of water levels beginning in 1957, and analysis determined that previous changes in the landscape – such as the building of Immokalee Road, the use of canals to drain land for real estate development, the increase in agriculture in the area, the installation of electrical and telephone lines, or the paving over of neighboring wetlands – had not altered the water levels, which are measured at Lettuce Lake, the park&#x27;s deepest standing water. But since 2000 or 2001, despite the same amount of annual rainfall during the wet season, during the dry season the water now drains away quickly instead of slowly receding as it had done in the past. The cause of the change is unknown – there was no major topographical change at the time – but the cause and the effects of the drier dry season for the Sanctuary and surrounding Collier County are under investigation.

==Park offerings and amenities==
A boardwalk of a little over length provides walking access through pine flatwoods, wet prairie, stands of pond cypress and bald cypress, and marsh ecosystems within the sanctuary. In 2017, some parts of the boardwalk were damaged by bald cypress trees knocked over by Hurricane Irma. Most of the damage was repaired, but several small sections have been permanently closed.

The sanctuary is a gateway site for the Great Florida Birding Trail. It is an important breeding area for the endangered wood stork and other wetland birds. It also has wintering passerines, including the painted bunting. Numerous wading bird species can be found in the wetlands of the sanctuary, including the yellow-crowned night heron, black-crowned night heron, tricolored heron, great egret, and snowy egret. Specialist birds include limpkin, barred owl and, in summer, swallow-tailed kite.

American alligators and cottonmouth snakes are also inhabitants of the sanctuary.

The sanctuary visitor center is a Living Machine demonstration site.

<doc id="374052" wikidata="Q642503" url="?curid=374052" title="Louis-Alexandre Taschereau">
<text>Louis-Alexandre Taschereau (; March 5, 1867 – July 6, 1952) was the 14th premier of Quebec from 1920 to 1936. A member of the Parti libéral du Québec, Taschereau&#x27;s near 16-year tenure remains the longest uninterrupted term of office among Quebec premiers.

== Early life ==

Taschereau was born in Quebec City, Quebec, the son of Jean-Thomas Taschereau, lawyer and judge at the Supreme Court, and Marie-Louise-Joséphine Caron.

He received a law degree from Université Laval and was admitted to the Barreau du Quebec on July 9, 1889. After entering political life, he served as chief lieutenant in the Liberal government of Sir Lomer Gouin. He practised his profession in the law firm of Charles Fitzpatrick and Simon-Napoléon Parent. He was also journalist at the &quot;Action Libérale&quot; and president and vice-president of the &quot;Banque d&#x27;Economie de Québec&quot;.

A member of the Legislative Assembly from 1900 onwards, he served as Premier Lomer Gouin&#x27;s Minister of Public Works from 1907 to 1919.

== Premier of Quebec ==

Elected Premier in 1920, at a time when the North American economy began experiencing difficulties that ultimately led to the Great Depression, he opposed U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt&#x27;s New Deal social democratic policies, saying he could not tell if it was fascism or communism. Instead, he vigorously encouraged the development by private enterprise of the massive forests and the mineral resources of what had been the Ungava Region and Nunavik that the Parliament of Canada had added to the Province of Quebec.

A pioneer in advocating the exploitation of the huge hydraulic potential the waterways of the new Quebec, Taschereau understood the limited capital available in a sparsely populated Canada, and actively tried to bring in American investment to develop Quebec&#x27;s industrial potential and try to stop mass emigration south of the border.

His policies challenged the traditional agrarian society that the dominance and influence of the Roman Catholic Church had been able to maintain in Quebec longer than elsewhere in North America. The Liberals of Taschereau were primarily opposed by ultramontane nationalists such as Henri Bourassa, editor of &quot;Le Devoir&quot;, and Roman Catholic priest Lionel Groulx, editor of &quot;L&#x27;action canadienne-française&quot;.
Taschereau introduced a measure in 1930 to create a Jewish board that would have provided for Jewish participation on the highest decision-making educational body in Quebec, the Quebec Council of Public Instruction. Some newspapers saw the move by Taschereau to revamp the confessional school system as an example of an undermining of Christianity. As a result of the opposition, the Jewish leadership did not push the issue when Taschereau was forced to repeal the Act and submit a compromise which he had the leaders of the Roman Catholic Church examine and approve beforehand. In the resulting bill, Jews were sent back into the Protestant system, and the Jewish board had no power beyond the right to negotiate a deal with the Protestant School board.

Another policy of Taschereau involved the alcohol trade. The &quot;Alcohol Beverages Act&quot; established the Quebec Liquor Commission (predecessor to the modern Société des alcools du Québec), which provided the government of Quebec with a monopoly on the sale of liquor and wine during the era of Prohibition in the United States.

Taschereau created the Beaux-Arts schools in Quebec City and Montreal and subsidized scientific and literary works. He was awarded France&#x27;s Legion of Honour, the Order of Leopold (Belgium), and made a Commander of the Order of the Crown of Belgium.
In the later years of his premiership, discontent inside the Liberal Party became evident. The more &quot;radical&quot; left wing of the party left the Liberals and formed a new party, the Action libérale nationale. Paul Gouin, the son of Lomer Gouin and grandson of Honoré Mercier, joined this new party. Later, the Action Libérale Nationale merged with the Conservative Party of Quebec to form the &quot;Union Nationale&quot; party under the leadership of Maurice Duplessis, who had become famous by exposing the Taschereau cabinet&#x27;s misdeeds before the Accounts Committee of the Legislative Assembly.

After his brother Antoine admitted to the Accounts Committee that he had deposited the interest on funds belonging to the Legislative Assembly into his personal bank account, Premier Taschereau resigned in favour of fellow Liberal Adélard Godbout, who was sworn in as premier in June 1936. Two months later Godbout lost the election to the &quot;Union Nationale&quot;, and 40 years of Liberal rule came to an end.

The premier served on the boards of a number of major companies, including: Barclays Bank (Canada) Ltd., Caisse d&#x27;économie, Molson Bank, Canadian Investments Funds, Bank of Montreal, Royal Trust Company, Sun Life Assurance, North American Life Assurance Company, Metropolitan Life Assurance Co., Liverpool &amp; London &amp; Globe Insurance Co., Pioneer Insurance Co., Globe Indemnity Co. and the Manitoba Liverpool Insurance Co.

Taschereau won the 1923 election, 1927 election, 1931 election and 1935 election and resigned in 1936.

== Death ==

On his passing in Quebec City in 1952, Taschereau was interred in the Cimetière Notre-Dame-de-Belmont in Sainte-Foy, Quebec.

<text>The black rhinoceros (&quot;Diceros bicornis&quot;), also called the black rhino and the hooked-lip rhinoceros, is a species of rhinoceros, native to eastern Africa and southern Africa, including Angola, Botswana, Kenya, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa, Eswatini, Tanzania, Zambia, and Zimbabwe. Although the species is referred to as &quot;black&quot;, its colours vary from brown to grey. It is the only extant species of the genus &quot;Diceros&quot;.

The other African rhinoceros is the white rhinoceros (&quot;Ceratotherium simum&quot;). The word &quot;white&quot; in the name &quot;white rhinoceros&quot; is often said to be a misinterpretation of the Afrikaans word &#x27; ([[Dutch language|Dutch]]&#x27;) meaning wide, referring to its square upper lip, as opposed to the pointed or hooked lip of the black rhinoceros. These species are now sometimes referred to as the square-lipped (for white) or hook-lipped (for black) rhinoceros.

The species overall is classified as critically endangered (even though the south-western black rhinoceros is classified as near threatened) and is threatened by multiple factors including poaching and habitat reduction. Three subspecies have been declared extinct, including the western black rhinoceros, which was declared extinct by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) in 2011. The IUCN estimates that 3,142 mature individuals remain in the wild.

==Taxonomy==
The species was first named &quot;Rhinoceros bicornis&quot; by Carl Linnaeus in the 10th edition of his &quot;Systema naturae&quot; in 1758. The name means &quot;double-horned rhinoceros&quot;. There is some confusion about what exactly Linnaeus conceived under this name as this species was probably based upon the skull of a single-horned Indian rhinoceros (&quot;Rhinoceros unicornis&quot;), with a second horn artificially added by the collector. Such a skull is known to have existed and Linnaeus even mentioned India as origin of this species. However he also referred to reports from early travellers about a double-horned rhino in Africa and when it emerged that there is only one, single-horned species of rhino in India, &quot;Rhinoceros bicornis&quot; was used to refer to the African rhinos (the white rhino only became recognised in 1812). In 1911 this was formally fixed and the Cape of Good Hope officially declared the type locality of the species.

=== Subspecies ===
The intraspecific variation in the black rhinoceros has been discussed by various authors and is not finally settled. The most accepted scheme considers seven or eight subspecies, Its Somalian range was the last to be eradicated, the subspecies becoming extinct sometime in the early 20th century. of which three became extinct in historical times and one is on the brink of extinction:

* Southern black rhinoceros or Cape black rhinoceros (&quot;D. b. bicornis&quot;) – Extinct. Once abundant from the Cape of Good Hope to Transvaal, South Africa and probably into the south of Namibia, this was the largest subspecies. It became extinct due to excessive hunting and habitat destruction around 1850.
* North-eastern black rhinoceros (&quot;D. b. brucii&quot;) – Extinct. Formerly central Sudan, Eritrea, northern and southeastern Ethiopia, Djibouti and northern and southeastern Somalia. Relict populations in northern Somalia vanished during the early 20th century.
* Chobe black rhinoceros (&quot;D. b. chobiensis&quot;) – A local subspecies restricted to the Chobe Valley in southeastern Angola, Namibia (Zambezi Region) and northern Botswana. Nearly extinct, possibly only one surviving specimen in Botswana.
* Uganda black rhinoceros (&quot;D. b. ladoensis&quot;) – Former distribution from South Sudan, across Uganda into western Kenya and southwesternmost Ethiopia. Black rhinos are considered extinct across most of this area and its conservational status is unclear. Probably surviving in Kenyan reserves.
* Western black rhinoceros (&quot;D. b. longipes&quot;) – Extinct. Once lived in South Sudan, northern Central African Republic, southern Chad, northern Cameroon, northeastern Nigeria and south-eastern Niger. The range possibly stretched west to the Niger River in western Niger, though this is unconfirmed. The evidence from Liberia and Burkina Faso mainly rests upon the existence of indigenous names for the rhinoceros. A far greater former range in West Africa as proposed earlier is doubted by a 2004 study. The last known wild specimens lived in northern Cameroon. In 2006 an intensive survey across its putative range in Cameroon failed to locate any, leading to fears that it was extinct in the wild. On 10 November 2011 the IUCN declared the western black rhinoceros extinct.
* Eastern black rhinoceros (&quot;D. b. michaeli&quot;) – Had a historical distribution from South Sudan, Uganda, Ethiopia, down through Kenya into north-central Tanzania. Today, its range is limited primarily to Kenya, Rwanda and Tanzania. In addition, its population is in South Africa&#x27;s Addo Elephant National Park. 
* South-central black rhinoceros (&quot;D. b. minor&quot;) – Most widely distributed subspecies, characterised by a compact body, proportionally large head and prominent skin-folds. Ranged from north-eastern South Africa (KwaZulu-Natal) to northeastern Tanzania and southeastern Kenya. Preserved in reserves throughout most of its former range but probably extinct in eastern Angola, southern Democratic Republic of Congo and possibly Mozambique. Extinct but reintroduced in Malawi, Botswana, and Zambia. It also ranges in parts of Namibia and inhabit national parks in South Africa. 
* South-western black rhinoceros (&quot;D. b. occidentalis&quot;) – A small subspecies, adapted to survival in desert and semi-desert conditions. Originally distributed in north-western Namibia and southwestern Angola, today restricted to wildlife reserves in Namibia with sporadic sightings in Angola. These populations are often referred to &quot;D. b. bicornis&quot; or &quot;D. b. minor&quot;, but some experts consider them a subspecies in their own right.

The most widely adopted alternative scheme only recognizes five subspecies or &quot;eco-types&quot;: &quot;D. b. bicornis&quot;, &quot;D. b. brucii&quot;, &quot;D. b. longipes&quot;, &quot;D. b. michaeli&quot;, and &quot;D. b. minor&quot;. This concept is also used by the IUCN, listing three surviving subspecies and recognizing &quot;D. b. brucii&quot; and &quot;D. b. longipes&quot; as extinct. The most important difference to the above scheme is the inclusion of the extant southwestern subspecies from Namibia in &quot;D. b. bicornis&quot; instead of in its own subspecies, whereupon the nominal subspecies is considered extant.

===Evolution===
The rhinoceros originated in the Eocene about fifty million years ago alongside other members of Perissodactyla. The last common ancestor of living rhinoceroses belonging to the subfamily Rhinocerotinae is suggested to have lived around 16 million years ago.

The white rhinoceros and black rhinoceros are more closely related to each other than to other living rhinoceroses. Rhinoceroses closely related to the black and the white rhinoceros were present in Africa by the Late Miocene about 10 million years ago, and possibly as early as 17 million years ago. The two species may have descended from the Eurasian species &quot;&quot;Ceratotherium&quot; neumayri,&quot; but this is disputed&quot;.&quot; A 2021 genetic analysis estimated the split between the white and black rhinoceros at around 7 million years ago. After this split, the direct ancestor of &quot;Diceros bicornis&quot;, &quot;Diceros praecox&quot; was present in the Pliocene of East Africa (Ethiopia, Kenya, Tanzania). &quot;D. bicornis&quot; is suggested to have evolved from this species during the Late Pliocene – Early Pleistocene, with the oldest definitive record at the Pliocene–Pleistocene boundary c. 2.5 million years ago at Koobi Fora, Kenya.

A cladogram showing the relationships of recent and Late Pleistocene rhinoceros species (minus &quot;Stephanorhinus hemitoechus)&quot; based on whole nuclear genomes, after Liu et al., 2021:

== Description ==

An adult black rhinoceros stands high at the shoulder and is in length. An adult typically weighs from , however unusually large male specimens have been reported at up to . The cows are smaller than the bulls. Two horns on the skull are made of keratin with the larger front horn typically long, exceptionally up to .

The longest known black rhinoceros horn measured nearly in length. Sometimes a third, smaller horn may develop. These horns are used for defense, intimidation, and digging up roots and breaking branches during feeding. The black rhino is smaller than the white rhino and close in size to the Javan rhino of Indonesia. It has a pointed and prehensile upper lip, which it uses to grasp leaves and twigs when feeding, whereas the white rhinoceros has square lips used for eating grass. The black rhinoceros can also be distinguished from the white rhinoceros by its size, smaller skull, and ears; and by the position of the head, which is held higher than the white rhinoceros, since the black rhinoceros is a browser and not a grazer.
Their thick-layered skin helps to protect black rhinos from thorns and sharp grasses. Their skin harbors external parasites, such as mites and ticks, which may be eaten by oxpeckers and egrets. Such behaviour was originally thought to be an example of mutualism, but recent evidence suggests that oxpeckers may be parasites instead, feeding on rhino blood. It is commonly assumed that black rhinos have poor eyesight, relying more on hearing and smell. However, studies have shown that their eyesight is comparatively good, at about the level of a rabbit. Their ears have a relatively wide rotational range to detect sounds. An excellent sense of smell alerts rhinos to the presence of predators.

== Distribution ==

=== Prehistorical range ===
As with many other components of the African large mammal fauna, black rhinos probably had a wider range in the northern part of the continent in prehistoric times than today. However this seems to have not been as extensive as that of the white rhino. Unquestionable fossil remains have not yet been found in this area and the abundant petroglyphs found across the Sahara desert are often too schematic to unambiguously decide whether they depict black or white rhinos. Petroglyphs from the Eastern Desert of southeastern Egypt relatively convincingly show the occurrence of black rhinos in these areas in prehistoric times.

=== Historical and extant range ===
The natural range of the black rhino included most of southern and eastern Africa, except the Congo Basin, the tropical rainforest areas along the Bight of Benin, the Ethiopian Highlands, and the Horn of Africa. Its former native occurrence in the extremely dry parts of the Kalahari Desert of southwestern Botswana and northwestern South Africa is uncertain. It was abundant in an area stretching from Eritrea and Sudan through South Sudan to southeastern Niger, especially around Lake Chad. Its occurrence further to the west is questionable, although this is often claimed in literature.
Today it is found only in protected nature reserves, having vanished from many countries in which it once thrived, especially in the west and north of its former range. The remaining populations are highly scattered. Some specimens have been relocated from their habitat to better protected locations, sometimes across national frontiers. The black rhino has been successfully reintroduced to Malawi since 1993, where it became extinct in 1990. Similarly it was reintroduced to Zambia (North Luangwa National Park) in 2008, where it had become extinct in 1998, and to Botswana (extinct in 1992, reintroduced in 2003).

In May 2017, 18 eastern black rhinos were translocated from South Africa to the Akagera National Park in Rwanda. The park had around 50 rhinos in the 1970s but the numbers dwindled to zero by 2007. In September 2017, the birth of a calf raised the population to 19. The park has dedicated rhino monitoring teams to protect the animals from poaching.

In October 2017, The governments of Chad and South Africa reached an agreement to transfer six black rhinos from South Africa to Zakouma National Park in Chad. Once established, this will be the northernmost population of the species. The species was wiped out from Chad in the 1970s and is under severe pressure from poaching in South Africa. The agreement calls for South African experts to assess the habitat, local management capabilities, security and the infrastructure before the transfer can take place.

== Behavior ==
Black rhinos are generally thought to be solitary, with the only strong bond between a mother and her calf. In addition, bulls and cows have a consort relationship during mating, also subadults and young adults frequently form loose associations with older individuals of either sex. They are not very territorial and often intersect other rhino territories. Home ranges vary depending on season and the availability of food and water. Generally they have smaller home ranges and larger density in habitats that have plenty of food and water available, and vice versa if resources are not readily available. Sex and age of an individual black rhino influence home range and size, with ranges of cows larger than those of bulls, especially when accompanied by a calf. In the Serengeti home ranges are around , while in the Ngorongoro it is between . Black rhinos have also been observed to have a certain area they tend to visit and rest frequently called &quot;houses&quot; which are usually on a high ground level. These &quot;home&quot; ranges can vary from 2.6 km2 to 133 km2 with smaller home ranges having more abundant resources than larger home ranges.

Black rhinos in captivity and reservations sleep patterns have been recently studied to show that males sleep longer on average than females by nearly double the time. Other factors that play a role in their sleeping patterns is the location of where they decide to sleep. Although they do not sleep any longer in captivity, they do sleep at different times due to their location in captivity, or section of the park.

Black rhinos have a reputation for being extremely aggressive, and charge readily at perceived threats. They have even been observed to charge tree trunks and termite mounds. Black rhinos will fight each other, and they have the highest rates of mortal combat recorded for any mammal: about 50 percent of males and 30 percent of females die from combat-related injuries. Adult rhinos normally have no natural predators, due to their imposing size, thick skin, and deadly horns. However, adult black rhinos have fallen prey to crocodiles in exceptional circumstances. Calves and, very seldom, small sub-adults may be preyed upon by lions as well.

Black rhinos follow the same trails that elephants use to get from foraging areas to water holes. They also use smaller trails when they are browsing. They are very fast and can get up to speeds of running on their toes.

While it was assumed all rhinoceros are short-sighted, a study involving black rhinoceros retinas suggests they have better eyesight than previously assumed.

===Diet===
Black rhinos are herbivorous browsers that eat leafy plants, twigs, branches, shoots, thorny wood bushes, small trees, legumes, fruit, and grass. The optimum habitat seems to be one consisting of thick scrub and bushland, often with some woodland, which supports the highest densities. Their diet can reduce the number of woody plants, which may benefit grazers (who focus on leaves and stems of grass), but not competing browsers (who focus on leaves, stems of trees, shrubs or herbs). It has been known to eat up to 220 species of plants. They have a significantly restricted diet with a preference for a few key plant species and a tendency to select leafy species in the dry season. The plant species they seem to be most attracted to when not in dry season are the woody plants. There are 18 species of woody plants known to the diet of the black rhinoceros, and 11 species that could possibly be a part of their diet too. Black rhinos also have a tendency to choose food based on quality over quantity, where researchers find more populations in areas where the food has better quality. Black rhinos show a preference for &quot;Acacia&quot; species, as well as plants in the family Euphorbiaceae.

In accordance with their feeding habit, adaptations of the chewing apparatus have been described for rhinos. The black rhinoceros has a two phased chewing activity with a cutting ectoloph and more grinding lophs on the lingual side. The black rhinoceros can also be considered a more challenging herbivore to feed in captivity compared to its grazing relatives. They can live up to 5 days without water during drought. Black rhinos live in several habitats including bushlands, Riverine woodland, marshes, and their least favorable, grasslands. Habitat preferences are shown in two ways, the amount of sign found in the different habitats, and the habitat content of home ranges and core areas. Habitat types are also identified based on the composition of dominant plant types in each area. Different subspecies live in different habitats including &quot;Vachellia&quot; and &quot;Senegalia&quot; savanna, &quot;Euclea&quot; bushlands, Albany thickets, and even desert.
They browse for food in the morning and evening. They are selective browsers but, studies done in Kenya show that they do add the selection material with availability in order to satisfy their nutritional requirements. In the hottest part of the day they are most inactive- resting, sleeping, and wallowing in mud. Wallowing helps cool down body temperature during the day and protects against parasites. When black rhinos browse they use their lips to strip the branches of their leaves. Competition with elephants is causing the black rhinoceros to shift its diet. The black rhinoceros alters its selectivity with the absence of the elephant.

There is some variance in the exact chemical composition of rhinoceros horns. This variation is directly linked to diet and can be used as a means of rhino identification. Horn composition has helped scientists pinpoint the original location of individual rhinos, allowing for law enforcement to more accurately and more frequently identify and penalize poachers. 
=== Communication ===
Black rhinos use several forms of communication. Due to their solitary nature, scent marking is often used to identify themselves to other black rhinos. Urine spraying occurs on trees and bushes, around water holes and feeding areas. Cows urine spray more often when receptive for breeding. Defecation sometimes occurs in the same spot used by different black rhinos, such as around feeding stations and watering tracks. Coming upon these spots, rhinos will smell to see who is in the area and add their own marking. When presented with adult feces, bulls and cows respond differently than when they are presented with subadult feces. The urine and feces of one black rhinoceros helps other black rhinoceroses to determine its age, sex, and identity. Less commonly they will rub their heads or horns against tree trunks to scent-mark.

The black rhino has powerful tube-shaped ears that can freely rotate in all directions. This highly developed sense of hearing allows black rhinos to detect sound over vast distances.

=== Reproduction ===

The adults are solitary in nature, coming together only for mating. Mating does not have a seasonal pattern but births tend to be towards the end of the rainy season in more arid environments.

When in season the cows will mark dung piles. Bulls will follow cows when they are in season; when she defecates he will scrape and spread the dung, making it more difficult for rival adult bulls to pick up her scent trail.

Courtship behaviors before mating include snorting and sparring with the horns among males. Another courtship behavior is called bluff and bluster, where the black rhino will snort and swing its head from side to side aggressively before running away repeatedly. Breeding pairs stay together for 2–3 days and sometimes even weeks. They mate several times a day over this time and copulation lasts for a half-hour, or even longer than one hour.

The gestation period for a black rhino is 15 months. The single calf weighs about at birth, and can follow its mother around after just three days. Weaning occurs at around 2 years of age for the offspring. The mother and calf stay together for 2–3 years until the next calf is born; female calves may stay longer, forming small groups. The young are occasionally taken by hyenas and lions. Sexual maturity is reached from 5 to 7 years old for females, and 7 to 8 years for males. The life expectancy in natural conditions (without poaching pressure) is from 35 to 50 years.

== Conservation ==

For most of the 20th century the continental black rhino was the most numerous of all rhino species. Around 1900 there were probably several hundred thousand living in Africa. During the latter half of the 20th century their numbers were severely reduced from an estimated 70,000 in the late 1960s to only 10,000 to 15,000 in 1981. In the early 1990s the number dipped below 2,500, and in 2004 it was reported that only 2,410 black rhinos remained. According to the International Rhino Foundation—housed in Yulee, Florida at White Oak Conservation, which breeds black rhinos—the total African population had recovered to 4,240 by 2008 (which suggests that the 2004 number was low). By 2009 the population of 5,500 was either steady or slowly increasing.

In 1992, nine black rhinos were brought from Chete National Park, Zimbabwe to Australia via Cocos Island. After the natural deaths of the males in the group, four males were brought in from United States and have since adapted well to captivity and new climate. Calves and some subadults are preyed on by lions, but predation is rarely taken into account in managing the black rhinoceros. This is a major flaw because predation should be considered when attributing cause to the poor performance of the black rhinoceros population. In 2002 only ten western black rhinos remained in Cameroon, and in 2006 intensive surveys across its putative range failed to locate any, leading to fears that this subspecies had become extinct. In 2011 the IUCN declared the western black rhino extinct. There was a conservation effort in which black rhinos were translocated, but their population did not improve, as they did not like to be in an unfamiliar habitat.

Under CITES Appendix I all international commercial trade of the black rhino horn is prohibited since 1977. China though having joined CITES since 8 April 1981 is the largest importer of black rhino horns. However, this is a trade in which not only do the actors benefit, but so do the nation states ignoring them as well. Nevertheless, people continue to remove the rhino from its natural environment and allow for a dependence on human beings to save them from endangerment. Parks and reserves have been made for protecting the rhinos with armed guards keeping watch, but even still many poachers get through and harm the rhinos for their horns. Many have considered extracting rhino horns in order to deter poachers from slaughtering these animals or potentially bringing them to other breeding grounds such as the US and Australia. This method of extracting the horn, known as dehorning, consists of tranquilizing the rhino then sawing the horn almost completely off to decrease initiative for poaching, although the effectiveness of this in reducing poaching is not known and rhino mothers are known to use their horns to fend off predators.

The only rhino subspecies that has recovered somewhat from the brink of extinction is the southern white rhinoceros, whose numbers now are estimated around 14,500, up from fewer than 50 in the first decade of the 20th century.
But there seems to be hope for the black rhinoceros in recovering their gametes from dead rhinos in captivity. This shows promising results for producing black rhinoceros embryos, which can be used for testing sperm in vitro.

A January 2014 auction for a permit to hunt a black rhinoceros in Namibia sold for $350,000 at a fundraiser hosted by the Dallas Safari Club. The auction drew considerable criticism as well as death threats directed towards members of the club and the man who purchased the permit. This permit was issued for 1 of 18 black rhinoceros specifically identified by Namibia&#x27;s Ministry of Environment and Tourism as being past breeding age and considered a threat to younger rhinos. The $350,000 that the hunter paid for the permit was used by the Namibian government to fund anti-poaching efforts in the country.

In 2022 South Africa granted permits to hunt 10 black rhinos, stating that the population is growing.

== Threats ==
Today, there are various threats posed to black rhinos including habitat changes, illegal poaching, and competing species. Civil disturbances, such as war, have made mentionably negative effects on the black rhinoceros populations in since the 1960s in countries including, but not limited to, Chad, Cameroon, Rwanda, Mozambique, and Somalia. In the Addo Elephant National Park in South Africa, the African bush elephant (&quot;Loxodonta africana&quot;) is posing slight concern involving the black rhinoceroses who also inhabit the area. Both animals are browsers; however, the elephant&#x27;s diet consists of a wider variety of foraging capacity, while the black rhinoceros primarily sticks to dwarf shrubs. The black rhinoceros has been found to eat grass as well; however, the shortening of its range of available food could be potentially problematic.

Black rhinos face problems associated with the minerals they ingest. They have become adjusted to ingesting less iron in the wild due to their evolutionary progression, which poses a problem when placed in captivity. These rhinoceroses can overload on iron, which leads to build up in the lungs, liver, spleen and small intestine.
Not only do these rhinoceros face threats being in the wild, but in captivity too. Black rhinoceros have become more susceptible to disease in captivity with high rates of mortality.

Illegal poaching for the international rhino horn trade is the main and most detrimental threat. The killing of these animals is not unique to modern-day society. The Chinese have maintained reliable documents of these happenings dating back to 1200 B.C. The ancient Chinese often hunted rhino horn for the making of wine cups, as well as the rhino&#x27;s skin to manufacture imperial crowns, belts and armor for soldiers. A major market for rhino horn has historically been in the Middle East nations to make ornately carved handles for ceremonial daggers called jambiyas. Demand for these exploded in the 1970s, causing the black rhinoceros population to decline 96% between 1970 and 1992. The horn is also used in traditional Chinese medicine, and is said by herbalists to be able to revive comatose patients, facilitate exorcisms and various methods of detoxification, and cure fevers. It is also hunted for the Chinese superstitious belief that the horns allow direct access to Heaven due to their unique location and hollow nature. The purported effectiveness of the use of rhino horn in treating any illness has not been confirmed, or even suggested, by medical science. In June 2007, the first-ever documented case of the medicinal sale of black rhino horn in the United States (confirmed by genetic testing of the confiscated horn) occurred at a traditional Chinese medicine supply store in Portland, Oregon&#x27;s Chinatown.

<doc id="374055" wikidata="Q1199774" url="?curid=374055" title="Westwood, Los Angeles">
<text>Westwood is a commercial and residential neighborhood in the northern central portion of the Westside region of Los Angeles, California. It is the home of the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). Bordering the campus on the south is Westwood Village, a major regional district for shopping, dining, movie theaters, and other entertainment.

Wilshire Boulevard through Westwood is a major corridor of condominium towers, on the eastern end and of Class A office towers, on the western end. Westwood also has residential areas of multifamily and single family housing, including exclusive Holmby Hills. The neighborhood was developed starting in 1919, and UCLA opened in 1929, while Westwood Village was built up starting in 1929 through the 1930s.
==Geography==
According to the Westwood Neighborhood Council, the Westwood Homeowners Association, and the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; Mapping L.A. project, Westwood is bounded by:
===Sub-neighborhoods===
Westwood Village is immediately south of the UCLA campus, bounded by LeConte, Gayley, Thornton (between Lindbrook and Wilshire: Glendon) and Wilshire Boulevard. Westwood Village north of Wilshire is an on-street shopping, dining and entertainment district that was planned in the 1920s - the second such district ever to be built in the nation&#x27;s history. It was planned by Janss and businesses started to open in 1929. It was the Westside&#x27;s busiest such district through the 1980s.

A portion of Holmby Hills, home to the Playboy Mansion, south of Sunset Blvd., east of both Beverly Glen Bl. and Comstock Av., and west of the L.A. Country Club, is within Westwood. The northern section of Holmby Hills is part of Bel Air. Together, Holmby Hills, Bel Air and Beverly Hills form the &quot;Platinum Triangle&quot; of Los Angeles.

North Westwood Village (or North Village) consists mainly of multifamily residential units where many UCLA students live, west of Gayley, north of Weyburn, and east of Veteran aves.
Tehrangeles, also known as &quot;Little Persia&quot;, refers to the large number of Persian restaurants, grocery stores, bookstores, art galleries, travel agencies, and rug stores along Westwood Boulevard that has served as a cultural hub for the Persian community in Los Angeles since the 1960s.

===Climate===
Westwood has a Mediterranean climate (Köppen &quot;Csb&quot;) with dry summers, relatively wet winters, and mild temperatures year-round. Like the rest of coastal Los Angeles County, Westwood experiences an Indian summer, where its warmest highs, in the upper 70s, are towards the end of summer and early fall. After mid-October temperatures dip down quicker. as the cold season approaches, than they rise from late spring to summer. Ocean temperatures tend to moderate the climate more than inland locations.

The average precipitation in Westwood is 17.43 inches which tends to be higher than most populated places in LA County. This is due to its proximity to the ocean andhillside location resulting in heavier and abundant rainfall. The most rainfall in a wet season was 43.55 from September 1997 to June 1998.

==History==
===Development===
Westwood was developed on the lands of the historic Wolfskill Ranch, a parcel that Arthur Letts, the successful founder of the Broadway and Bullock&#x27;s department stores, purchased in 1919. Upon Arthur Letts&#x27; death, his son-in-law, Harold Janss, vice president of Janss Investment Company, inherited the land. He began to develop the area and started to advertise for new homes in 1922.

The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; reported the news: &quot;Westwood, the subdivision of the Wolfskill Ranch, of scenic territory between the city and Santa Monica, is to be opened to homeseekers and investors today by the Janss Investment Company. The tract comprises approximately 1000 residential and business lots, situated west of the Los Angeles Country Club on Santa Monica Boulevard and the Rancho Country Club on Pico Boulevard.&quot;

===UCLA===

Meanwhile, the Southern Branch of the University of California had been established on Vermont Avenue in Los Angeles, where enrollment expanded so rapidly that by 1925 the institution had outgrown the site. The selection of a new campus in the Westwood hills was announced on March 21, 1925. The owners of the estate, the Janss brothers, agreed to sell the property for approximately $1 million ($ million in dollars), less than one-third the land&#x27;s value. Municipal bond measures passed by Los Angeles, Santa Monica, Beverly Hills and Venice provided for that amount. Proposition 10, a state bond measure passed that year, provided $3 million for construction. Thus the University of California at Los Angeles was established in Westwood; ground was broken on September 12, 1927, and the campus opened for regular classes on September 20, 1929.

===Westwood Village established ===
Westwood Village, a planned, immediately south of the UCLA campus, was only the second such district on this scale ever to be built worldwide, preceded only by Country Club Plaza (1922–23) in Kansas City. It with was created by the Janss Investment Company, run by Harold and Edwin Janss and their father, Peter, in the late 1920s as a shopping district and headquarters of the Janss Company. Its boom was complemented by the boom of UCLA which opened in 1929 and served not only faculty, staff and students but also affluent shoppers from the surrounding upscale single-family-home neighborhoods.

Opening in 1929, the design was considered one of the nation&#x27;s best-planned and beautifully laid out commercial areas. Harold Janss had hired major architects and instructed them to follow a Mediterranean theme, with clay tile roofs, decorative Spanish tile, paseos, patios and courtyards. Buildings at strategic points, including theaters, used towers to serve as beacons for drivers on Wilshire Boulevard. Janss picked the first slate of businesses and determined their location in the neighborhood; the area opened with 34 businesses, and, despite the Great Depression, had 452 businesses in 1939, including Bullock&#x27;s (Parkinson &amp; Parkinson), Desmond&#x27;s (Percy Parke Lewis) and Sears department stores, and a Ralphs grocery (Stiles Clements).

===1970s–1980s===
The architectural style met a turning point in 1970, when a 24-story office building now known as the Oppenheimer Tower was built in the neighborhood and the design of new buildings soon became a blend of styles. The Oppenheimer Tower was used for the primary location in the 1978 episode of &quot;Emergency!&quot;, &quot;The Steel Inferno&quot;. Wilshire Boulevard through Westwood is would become a major corridor of condominium towers, from Westwood Boulevard east towards the Beverly Hills city line, and of Class A office towers, at Westwood Boulevard and westward. The 1980s saw Iranian immigration to the area after the 1979 Iranian Revolution, and the beginnings of the Tehrangeles business corridor along Westwood Boulevard south of Wilshire Boulevard. Westwood Village&#x27;s popularity as a shopping, dining, and nighttime entertainment district continued to rise, with commercial rents peaking in 1988.

===Decline of Westwood Village===
The Village suffered a major setback in the late 1980s, when gangs began to frequent the neighborhood and crime increased. The problems culminated in January 1988 when a gang shootout resulted in the death of a 27-year-old bystander. On January 30, 1988, gang violence brought nationwide attention to Westwood Village when Karen Toshima, a 27-year-old graphics artist, was killed as she crossed a Village street in a shootout between gang members. Her killer, Durrell DeWitt Collins, 23, was sentenced to two concurrent terms of 27 years to life in prison. In 2016, he was again denied parole until at least 2021. The episode led to the widespread impression that even affluent Westwood was not immune to the crime wave then ravaging Los Angeles.

The Los Angeles establishment reacted with horror. Newspapers and television headlined the story for days. &lt;br&gt;Police patrols in Westwood tripled, and the L.A.P.D. assigned a 30-member antigang unit to capture Toshima&#x27;s killer.&lt;br&gt;       There was a conviction in December 1988 for a September 1985 abduction and double-murder that started as an auto theft in Westwood.
The neighborhood&#x27;s well-known bookstores and some movie cinemas began closing with the advent of large chain stores, Amazon.com and multiplex theaters.

===Current challenges===
A 2014 report for the Westwood Village Improvement Association reported that Westwood Village, although still a busy place, was no longer the Westside&#x27;s dominant retail and entertainment destinations as it had been for decades. The Village suffered from deteriorating public spaces and a high number of vacancies. Multiple revitalization efforts over decades were unsuccessful and the Village&#x27;s image and reputation suffered. Even a quarter century later, &quot;Los Angeles&quot; Magazine referred to the 1988 gang‐related murder of an innocent bystander as a cause of Westwood Village&#x27;s diminished activity. Limited and expensive parking remained a problem. Macy&#x27;s (originally Bullock&#x27;s) closed in 1999, leaving the district without a department store anchor. In that quarter-century, multiple nearby districts lured customers away from the Village, such as Westfield Century City, The Grove, the now-closed Westside Pavilion, and Downtown Santa Monica with its open-air and enclosed shopping malls.

===Architecture===
Westwood Village was master-planned in the late 1920s and Janss carefully selected not only the architects, but also the style of the buildings and their juxtaposition. Towers were built as landmarks and businesses on corner lots were carefully selected for their attractiveness and as landmarks.

====Table of architecturally significant buildings in Westwood Village====
Buildings which according to a 1985 study by Gruen and Associates identified the following buildings of historic architectural significance:

==Demographics==
In 2018, about 50,288 people lived in the 90024 ZIP code, which grossly corresponds to Westwood, according to the Census Bureau&#x27;s American Community Survey. The 2000 U.S. census counted 47,916 residents in the 3.68-square-mile Westwood neighborhood—or 13,036 people per square mile, an average population density for the city. In 2008, the city estimated that the population had increased to 52,041. The median age for residents was 27, considered young for the city; the percentages of residents aged 19 to 34 was among the county&#x27;s highest.

The neighborhood was considered moderately diverse ethnically, with a high percentage of Asians and of whites. The breakdown was 62.9% Non-Hispanic White, 23,1% Asian, 7.0% Hispanic or Latino, 2.0% Black, and 4.9% of other origins. Iran (23.5%) and Taiwan (7.3%) were the most common places of birth for the 31.3% of the residents who were born abroad—about the same percentage as in the city at large.

The median yearly household income in 2008 dollars was $68,716, a high figure for Los Angeles. The percentages of households that earned $125,000 yearly and higher or that earned $20,000 or less were high for Los Angeles County. The average household size of two people was low for Los Angeles. Renters occupied 64.1% of the housing stock and house-or-apartment owners held 35.9%. The percentages of never-married men and women were among the county&#x27;s highest. In 2000 there were 309 families headed by single parents, a low percentage for the city. Five percent of the population had served in the military, a low figure for both the city and the county.

==Entertainment and cultural facilities==
Besides the many facilities of UCLA itself, cultural and entertainment facilities include:

===Historic cinemas===
The Village has two historic movie theaters Fox Village Theater (opened 1931, architect Percy Parke Lewis and the Bruin Theater (S. Charles Lee, 1937), which hosted many Hollywood premieres over past decades.

===Hammer Museum===
The Hammer Museum, which is affiliated with UCLA, is an art museum and cultural center known for its artist-centric and progressive array of exhibitions and public programs. Founded in 1990 by the entrepreneur-industrialist Armand Hammer to house his personal art collection, the museum has since expanded its scope to become &quot;the hippest and most culturally relevant institution in town.&quot; Particularly important among the museum&#x27;s critically acclaimed exhibitions are presentations of both historically overlooked and emerging contemporary artists. The Hammer Museum also hosts over 300 programs throughout the year, from lectures, symposia, and readings to concerts and film screenings. As of February 2014, the museum&#x27;s collections, exhibitions, and programs are completely free to all visitors.

===Geffen Playhouse Theater===
The Geffen Playhouse Theater was built in 1929 at 10886 LeConte Avenue as the Masonic Affiliates Club, or the MAC, for students and alumni at UCLA. One of the first dozen structures built in Westwood Village, it was designed by architect Stiles O. Clements.

===LDS (Mormon) Temple===
The Los Angeles California Temple, the second-largest temple operated by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, is on Santa Monica Boulevard in Westwood. The temple grounds also include a Visitors&#x27; Center open to the public and the headquarters for the Church&#x27;s missionary efforts in Los Angeles. The church purchased the land for the temple from silent film star Harold Lloyd in 1937 and opened the temple in 1956.

The temple grounds are also home to the Los Angeles Regional Family History Center (LARFHC), which is open to the public as well. It is the second-largest branch in the Family History Library system of the LDS Church, and contains more than 100,000 microfiche and 30,000 books.

==Parks and recreation==
The Westwood Recreation Center is in Westwood. The facility includes barbecue pits, a lighted baseball diamond, lighted outdoor basketball courts, racquetball courts, a children&#x27;s play area, a community room, an indoor gymnasium with weights, and a picnic table. The center also has Aidan&#x27;s Place, which opened on December 5, 2001. The place, named after wheelchair-bound Aidan James, is a playground developed for joint use by handicapped and non-handicapped children.

Holmby Park is also in Westwood.

==Government and infrastructure==
The Los Angeles County Department of Health Services SPA 5 West Area Health Office serves Westwood.

In 2018, Westwood stakeholders voted to subdivide the area into two official neighborhood council districts. Since then the North Westwood Neighborhood Council has represented UCLA, Westwood Village, the North Westwood Village, and Persian Square areas, while the Westwood Neighborhood Council has continued to represent the surrounding residential areas.

===Police===
The Los Angeles Police Department operates the West Los Angeles Community Police Station at 1663 Butler Avenue, which serves the community. Law enforcement for the UCLA campus is the responsibility of the UCLA Police Department, a division of the independent, statewide University of California Police Department. As a state police agency, the UCLA PD has full law enforcement powers on and off campus.

===Fire and EMS===
Fire and emergency medical services are provided by the Los Angeles Fire Department. UCLA Emergency Medical Services, a division of the UCLA Police Department, operates a Basic Life Support ambulance for the UCLA campus and supports LAFD on medical aid calls in the surrounding community. UCLA also maintains a small fire suppression apparatus staffed by campus fire marshals that responds to university-owned properties and helps the outside community when requested to by LAFD.

==Education==
Sixty-six percent of Westwood residents aged 25 and older had earned a four-year degree by 2000, a high figure for both the city and the county. The percentages of residents of that age with a master&#x27;s degree or higher was the third-highest in the county.

Westwood is home to the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA).

<text>Sir Jean Lomer Gouin, (March 19, 1861 – March 28, 1929) was a Canadian politician. He served as 13th premier of Quebec, as a Cabinet minister in the federal government of Canada, and as the 15th lieutenant governor of Quebec.

==Biography==

He was born in Grondines, Quebec to Dr. Joseph-Nérée Gouin, a doctor and Séraphine Fugère and was educated at Sorel College, Lévis College and Laval University in Montreal. He was called to the Bar in 1884. He practised with people heavily involved in Canadian and Quebec politics: Honoré Mercier, whose daughter he married, Louis-Olivier Taillon, Raymond Préfontaine, Joseph-Émery Robidoux, Louis-Philippe Bérard and Rodolphe Lemieux. He represented major railway companies. He was President of the Quebec Bar in 1910 and 1911. On May 24, 1888, he married Éliza Mercier, daughter of Honoré Mercier. Their son, Paul Gouin, later led the Action libérale nationale party.

He began his long political career by losing as a Liberal candidate in the riding of Richelieu in the 1891 federal election. His first electoral success came in 1897 when he was elected MNA for Montréal No. 2. He was re-elected in 1900 and 1904. He held the positions of Commissioner of Public Works (1900-1901), then Minister of Colonization and Public Works (1901-1905) in the cabinet of Simon-Napoléon Parent. Along with his colleagues Alexander Weir and Adélard Turgeon, he resigned with a view to overthrowing Parent, who had to leave in the face of this rebellion in his own party. He was appointed Premier of Quebec on 23 March 1905, a position he held until his resignation in 1920, while also holding the position of Attorney General (1905-1919) and, briefly, Minister of Colonization, Mines and Fisheries in 1907. In the 1908 election, faced with a surge of nationalists led by Henri Bourassa and Armand Lavergne, he ran in both Portneuf and Saint-Hyacinthe, as the law of the day allowed. He was elected in the first constituency and defeated by Bourassa in the second. Re-elected in both Portneuf and Saint-Jean in 1912, he chose Portneuf and was re-elected there in 1916 and 1919. He was responsible for the Workmen&#x27;s Compensation Act, passed in 1909, the incorporation of Ungava into Quebec in 1912 and the Good Roads Act. He created the Ministère de la Voirie in 1912. He reorganised municipal administration in Montreal and developed education by creating normal schools for girls and technical schools in Montreal and Quebec City. He was also responsible for the École des hautes études commerciales in Montreal, the École centrale de préparation et d&#x27;arpentage and the École forestières opened in 1907 at Université Laval.

In 1920, he was appointed to the Legislative Council as the representative for the Salaberry division. He resigned the following year to run successfully as a Liberal candidate in the federal riding of Laurier—Outremont in the general election. William Lyon Mackenzie King&#x27;s Liberals then took power and Gouin was appointed Minister of Justice (1921-1924). He did not stand for re-election in 1925 and returned to the practice of law while sitting on the boards of directors of numerous companies.

He was appointed Lieutenant-Governor on 10 January 1929. On the following 18 March, while in Parliament to prorogue a session that was running late, he suffered a heart attack and died in his office. His death caused a stir.

Lomer Gouin is interred in the Notre Dame des Neiges Cemetery in Montreal.

==Elections as party leader==

He won the 1908 election, 1912 election, 1916 election and 1919 election and resigned in 1920.

==Honours==
Many sites and landmarks were named to honour Lomer Gouin. They include:

<doc id="374063" wikidata="Q1551125" url="?curid=374063" title="Compatibilism">
<text>Compatibilism is the belief that free will and determinism are mutually compatible and that it is possible to believe in both without being logically inconsistent. As Steven Weinberg puts it: &quot;I would say that free will is nothing but our conscious experience of deciding what to do, which I know I am experiencing as I write this review, and this experience is not invalidated by the reflection that physical laws made it inevitable that I would want to make these decisions.&quot; The opposing belief, that the thesis of determinism is logically incompatible with the classical thesis of free will, is known as &quot;incompatibilism&quot;.

Compatibilists believe that freedom can be present or absent in situations for reasons that have nothing to do with metaphysics. In other words, that causal determinism does not exclude the truth of possible future outcomes. Because free will is seen as a necessary prerequisite for moral responsibility, compatibilism is often used to support compatibility between moral responsibility and determinism.

Similarly, political liberty is a non-metaphysical concept. Statements of political liberty, such as the United States Bill of Rights, assume moral liberty: the ability to choose to do otherwise than what one does.

== History ==
Compatibilism was mentioned and championed by the ancient Stoics and some medieval scholastics. More specifically, scholastics like Thomas Aquinas and later Thomists (such as Domingo Báñez) are often interpreted as holding that human action can be free, even though an agent in some strong sense could not do otherwise than what they did. Whereas Aquinas is often interpreted to maintain rational compatibilism (i.e., an action can be determined by rational cognition and yet free), later Thomists, such as Báñez, develop a sophisticated theory of theological determinism, according to which actions of free agents, despite being free, are, on a higher level, determined by infallible divine decrees manifested in the form of &quot;physical premotion&quot; (), a deterministic intervention of God into the will of a free agent required to reduce the will from potency to act. A strong incompatibilist view of freedom was, on the other hand, developed in the Franciscan tradition, especially by Duns Scotus, and later upheld and further developed by Jesuits, especially Luis de Molina and Francisco Suárez. In the early modern era, compatibilism was maintained by Enlightenment philosophers (such as David Hume and Thomas Hobbes).

During the 20th century, compatibilists presented novel arguments that differed from the classical arguments of Hume, Hobbes, and John Stuart Mill. Importantly, Harry Frankfurt popularized what are now known as Frankfurt counterexamples to argue against incompatibilism, and developed a positive account of compatibilist free will based on higher-order volitions. Other &quot;new compatibilists&quot; include Gary Watson, Susan R. Wolf, P. F. Strawson, and R. Jay Wallace. Contemporary compatibilists range from the philosopher and cognitive scientist Daniel Dennett, particularly in his works &quot;Elbow Room&quot; (1984) and &quot;Freedom Evolves&quot; (2003), to the existentialist philosopher Frithjof Bergmann. Perhaps the most renowned contemporary defender of compatibilism is John Martin Fischer.

A 2020 survey found that 59% of English-publishing philosophers accept or lean towards compatibilism.

== Defining free will ==

&quot;Compatibilists&quot; often define an instance of &quot;free will&quot; as one in which the agent had the freedom to act according to their own &quot;motivation&quot;. That is, the agent was not coerced or restrained. Arthur Schopenhauer famously said: &quot;Man can do what he wills but he cannot will what he wills.&quot; In other words, although an agent may often be free to act according to a &quot;motive&quot;, the nature of that motive is determined. This definition of free will does not rely on the truth or falsity of causal determinism. This view also makes &quot;free will&quot; close to &quot;autonomy&quot;, the ability to live according to one&#x27;s own rules, as opposed to being submitted to external domination.

=== Alternatives as imaginary ===

Some compatibilists hold both causal determinism (all effects have causes) and logical determinism (the future is already determined) to be true. Thus statements about the future (e.g., &quot;it will rain tomorrow&quot;) are either true or false when spoken today. This compatibilist free will should not be understood as the ability to choose differently in an identical situation. A compatibilist may believe that a person can decide between several choices, but the choice is always determined by external factors. If the compatibilist says &quot;I may visit tomorrow, or I may not&quot;, he is saying that he does not know what he will choose—whether he will choose to follow the subconscious urge to go or not.

=== Non-naturalism ===
Alternatives to strictly naturalist physics, such as mind–body dualism positing a mind or soul existing apart from one&#x27;s body while perceiving, thinking, choosing freely, and as a result acting independently on the body, include both traditional religious metaphysics and less common newer compatibilist concepts. Also consistent with both autonomy and Darwinism, they allow for free personal agency based on practical reasons within the laws of physics. While less popular among 21st-century philosophers, non-naturalist compatibilism is present in most if not almost all religions.

== Criticism ==
A prominent criticism of compatibilism is Peter van Inwagen&#x27;s consequence argument.

Critics of compatibilism often focus on the definitions of free will: incompatibilists may agree that the compatibilists are showing &quot;something&quot; to be compatible with determinism, but they think that this &quot;something&quot; ought not to be called &quot;free will&quot;. Incompatibilists might accept the &quot;freedom to act&quot; as a &quot;necessary&quot; criterion for free will, but doubt that it is &quot;sufficient&quot;. The incompatibilists believe that free will refers to &quot;genuine&quot; (i.e., absolute, ultimate, physical) alternate possibilities for beliefs, desires, or actions, rather than merely counterfactual ones.

The direct predecessor to compatibilism was soft determinism (a term coined by William James, which he used pejoratively). Soft determinism is the view that we (ordinary humans) have free will and determinism is true. (Compatibilists, by contrast, take no stand on the truth-value of determinism.) James accused the soft determinists of creating a &quot;quagmire of evasion&quot; by stealing the name of freedom to mask their underlying determinism. Immanuel Kant called it a &quot;wretched subterfuge&quot; and &quot;word jugglery&quot;. Kant&#x27;s argument turns on the view that, while all empirical phenomena must result from determining causes, human thought introduces something seemingly not found elsewhere in nature—the ability to conceive of the world in terms of how it &quot;ought&quot; to be, or how it might otherwise be. For Kant, subjective reasoning is necessarily distinct from how the world is empirically. Because of its capacity to distinguish &quot;is&quot; from &quot;ought&quot;, reasoning can &quot;spontaneously&quot; originate new events without being itself determined by what already exists. It is on this basis that Kant argues against a version of compatibilism in which, for instance, the actions of the criminal are comprehended as a blend of determining forces and free choice, which Kant regards as misusing the word &quot;free&quot;. Kant proposes that taking the compatibilist view involves denying the distinctly subjective capacity to re-think an intended course of action in terms of what &quot;ought&quot; to happen.

<doc id="374069" wikidata="Q800048" url="?curid=374069" title="Major League Baseball Manager of the Year Award">
<text>In Major League Baseball, the Manager of the Year Award is an honor given annually since 1983 to two outstanding managers, one each in the American League (AL) and the National League (NL). The winner is voted on by 30 members of the Baseball Writers&#x27; Association of America (BBWAA). Each submits a vote for first, second, and third place among the managers of each league. The manager with the highest score in each league wins the award.

Several managers have won the award in a season in which they led their team to 100 or more wins. They are:
*Lou Piniella – 116 (Seattle Mariners, 2001)
*Joe Torre – 114 (New York Yankees, 1998)
*Gabe Kapler – 107 (San Francisco Giants, 2021)
*Sparky Anderson – 104 (Detroit Tigers, 1984)
*Tony La Russa – 104 (Oakland Athletics, 1988)
*Dusty Baker – 103 (San Francisco Giants, 1993)
*Larry Dierker – 102 (Houston Astros, 1998)
*Whitey Herzog – 101 (St. Louis Cardinals, 1985)
*Rocco Baldelli – 101 (Minnesota Twins, 2019)
*Buck Showalter – 101 (New York Mets, 2022)
*Brandon Hyde – 101 (Baltimore Orioles, 2023)
*Kevin Cash – 100 (Tampa Bay Rays, 2021)

In 1991, Bobby Cox became the first manager to win the award in both leagues, winning with the Atlanta Braves and having previously won with the Toronto Blue Jays in 1985. La Russa, Piniella, Showalter, Jim Leyland, Bob Melvin, Davey Johnson, and Joe Maddon have since won the award in both leagues. Cox, La Russa, and Showalter have won the most awards, with four. Baker, Leyland, Piniella, Maddon, Melvin, and Terry Francona have won three times. In 2005, Cox became the first manager to win the award in consecutive years. Cash became the second manager in 2021, and first in the AL, to win the award in consecutive years. Stephen Vogt of the Cleveland Guardians and Pat Murphy of the Milwaukee Brewers are the most recent winners; with Murphy&#x27;s win, every MLB franchise has won the award at least once.

Because of the 1994–95 Major League Baseball strike cut the season short and canceled the post-season, the BBWAA writers effectively created a &quot;de facto&quot; mythical national championship (similar to college football) by naming managers of the unofficial league champions (lead the leagues in winning percentage) (Buck Showalter and Felipe Alou) as Managers of the Year. The Chicago White Sox have seen five managers win the award, the most in the majors.

Only five managers have won the award while leading a team that finished outside the top two spots in its division. Buck Rodgers was the first, winning the award in 1987 with the third-place Expos. Tony Peña and Showalter won the award with third-place teams in back-to-back years: Peña with the Royals in 2003, and Showalter with the Rangers in 2004. Joe Girardi is the only manager to win the award with a fourth-place team (2006 Florida Marlins); he is also the only manager to win the award after fielding a team with a losing record.

<doc id="374090" wikidata="Q1549254" url="?curid=374090" title="Principality of Seborga">
<text>The Principality of Seborga (, Ligurian: &quot;Prinçipatu de A Seborca&quot;) is an unrecognised micronation that claims a area located in the northwestern Italian Province of Imperia in Liguria, near the French border, and about from Monaco. The principality is coextensive with the comune of Seborga; assertions of sovereignty were instigated in 1963 by a local campaigner based on unproven claims about territorial settlements made by the Congress of Vienna after the Napoleonic Wars.

==History ==

The claim of sovereignty for Seborga was put forward in 1963 by a Seborgan former flower grower named Giorgio Carbone. He claimed to have found documents from the Vatican archives which, according to Carbone, indicated that Seborga had never been a possession of the House of Savoy and was therefore not legitimately included in the Kingdom of Italy when it was formed in 1861 during Italian unification. Carbone claimed that Seborga had existed as a sovereign state of Italy since 954, and that from 1079 it was a principality of the Holy Roman Empire. Sovereignty claims assert that Seborga was overlooked by the Congress of Vienna in its redistribution of European territories after the Napoleonic Wars.

Carbone promoted the idea of Seborgan independence as a principality, and in 1963 the town&#x27;s inhabitants elected him as their putative head of state. Carbone assumed the style and title &quot;His Tremendousness (Sua Tremendità)&quot; Giorgio I, Prince of Seborga. He formed a &quot;cabinet&quot; of ministers; minted a local currency, the luigino; introduced a Seborgan flag, a white cross on a blue background; and established a Latin motto, (Sit in the shade). 
Carbone&#x27;s campaign has generally not been taken seriously and is widely viewed as a ruse to attract tourists to the town, although his supporters in the town claim that their small state has been recognised by Burkina Faso.

In January 2006, Carbone announced that he would abdicate on reaching the age of 70, apparently as a result of a row over rebuilding the village centre, but he didn&#x27;t and continued to hold the office until his death. Even so, this decision was the subject of a feature on the BBC World Service radio programme &quot;World Today&quot; on 25 January 2006.

Giorgio Carbone retained his ceremonial position until his death on 25 November 2009 (age 73), due to complications due to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. The position of the Serborgan &quot;monarch&quot; is not hereditary, and since Carbone&#x27;s death, elections have been held in Seborga every seven years among the town&#x27;s 200 registered voters. Carbone was succeeded by businessman Marcello Menegatto, who was elected on 25 April 2010 and crowned on 22 May 2010 as &quot;His Serene Highness&quot; (&quot;Sua Altezza Serenissima&quot; or &quot;SAS&quot;) Prince Marcello I. Menegatto was re-elected as Prince on 23 April 2017, after an unsuccessful challenge to the position by Mark Dezzani, a British-born radio DJ who had lived in Seborga for nearly 40 years.

On 12 April 2019, Menegatto abdicated from his position, and he was succeeded by his ex-wife, Nina Menegatto, who was elected by the town as &quot;Her Serene Highness&quot; Princess Nina on 10 November 2019.

== List of Seborgan monarchs ==
=== False titles ===

There have been pretenders to the Seborgan throne, which include such pretenders as the self-styled &quot;Princess&quot; Yasmine von Hohenstaufen Anjou Plantagenet, and Nicolas Mutte, a French writer.

Yasmine von Hohenstaufen wrote to Italy&#x27;s president and offered to return the principality to the state on June 13, 2006.

== Seborga today ==

Seborga&#x27;s independence claims continue today, and an official &quot;Principato di Seborga&quot; website asserts the historical arguments put forward by Carbone. Seborga claims to maintain a volunteer border guard, the &quot;Corpo delle Guardie&quot;. Participants wear a blue-and-white uniform and during the tourist season they stand guard at sentry boxes on the unofficial border crossing on the main road into Seborga.

The unrecognised micronation that claims Seborga Town understands that the town still falls directly within the laws and borders of Italy.

=== Currency ===

Seborga&#x27;s local currency, the Seborga luigino, is divided into 100 cents. Luigini coins circulate in Seborga alongside the euro. The currency has no value outside of the town. The value of the luigino is pegged to the US dollar at SPL1 = USD6.00. On 20 August 2023 the Principality presented the first banknote ever of the &quot;luigini&quot;.

=== Population ===

As of 1 January 2018, Seborga had a population of 297 people, with 146 males and 151 females. As of 2021, the population of Seborga has gone down to 217 people.

<doc id="374093" wikidata="Q2900193" url="?curid=374093" title="Bettina Goislard">
<text>Bettina Goislard (11 November 1974 – 16 November 2003) was a French employee of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), assigned to its mission in Afghanistan. She was the first United Nations worker to be killed in that country since the fall of the Taliban in December 2001.

== Biography ==
Goislard, the daughter of career diplomat Bernard Goislard and his English wife, was born in Saumur, France. She got a degree in Arabic in Paris and Cairo . After graduation, was hired by the UNHCR in June 1999 for a field assignment in Rwanda. She spent almost three years there, assisting refugees to return. She then moved on to Guinea and then Afghanistan in June 2002.

In Afghanistan, she was involved in the UNHCR&#x27;s efforts to help about 50,000 displaced Afghan refugees return to their homes in and around the city of Ghazni in the southeast of the country.

== Death ==
On 16 November 2003, while driving through the streets of Ghazni in a clearly identified UNHCR vehicle, Goislard was shot at point-blank range by two men on a motorcycle. She was pronounced dead upon arrival at a hospital some minutes later. Her two assailants were caught and beaten by a local crowd, and then taken into custody by local security forces.

On 18 November 2003, the Taliban claimed responsibility for her murder, citing Goislard&#x27;s Christianity as their motivation. The UN immediately scaled back its efforts in Afghanistan, withdrawing its international refugee workers from four provinces. Two days later, in accordance with her wishes, Bettina Goislard was buried in Kabul.

=== Trial ===
On 10 February 2004, her two assailants Zia Ahmad and Abdul Nabi, both government employees under the former Taliban régime, were convicted of the murder and sentenced to be executed. The men are said to be planning an appeal against the decision. A month later, Taliban rebels kidnapped a Turkish highway engineer and his Afghan driver and threatened to kill them unless Ahmad and Nabi were released. The Turkish engineer and his Afghan driver were released unconditionally a few months later.

<doc id="374097" wikidata="Q4668993" url="?curid=374097" title="Abraham Lincoln's second inaugural address">
<text>Abraham Lincoln delivered his second inaugural address on Saturday, March 4, 1865, during his second inauguration as President of the United States. At a time when victory over secessionists in the American Civil War was within days and slavery in all of the U.S. was near an end, Lincoln did not speak of happiness, but of sadness. Some see this speech as a defense of his pragmatic approach to Reconstruction, in which he sought to avoid harsh treatment of the defeated rebels by reminding his listeners of how wrong both sides had been in imagining what lay before them when the war began four years earlier. Lincoln balanced that rejection of triumphalism, however, with recognition of the unmistakable evil of slavery. The address is inscribed, along with the Gettysburg Address, in the Lincoln Memorial.

==Sources and theme==
Lincoln used his second inaugural address to touch on the question of Divine providence. He wondered what God&#x27;s will might have been in allowing the war to come, and why it had assumed the terrible dimensions it had taken. He endeavored to address some of these dilemmas, using allusions taken from the Bible.

Lincoln reiterates the cause of the war, slavery, in saying that &quot;slaves constituted a peculiar and powerful interest. All knew that this interest was somehow the cause of the war.&quot;

The words &quot;wringing their bread from the sweat of other men&#x27;s faces&quot; are an allusion to the Fall of Man in the Book of Genesis. As a result of Adam&#x27;s sin, God tells Adam that henceforth &quot;In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, till thou return unto the ground; for out of it wast thou taken: for dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return&quot; ().

Lincoln&#x27;s phrase, &quot;but let us judge not, that we be not judged,&quot; is an allusion to the words of Jesus in which in the King James Version reads, &quot;Judge not, that ye be not judged.&quot;

Lincoln quotes another of Jesus&#x27; sayings: &quot;Woe unto the world because of offenses; for it must needs be that offenses come, but woe to that man by whom the offense cometh.&quot; Lincoln&#x27;s quoted language comes from ; a similar discourse by Jesus appears in .

Lincoln suggests that the death and destruction wrought by the war was divine retribution to the U.S. for possessing slavery, saying that God may will that the war continue &quot;until every drop of blood drawn with the lash shall be paid by another drawn with the sword&quot;, and that the war was the country&#x27;s &quot;woe due&quot;. The quotation &quot;the judgments of the Lord are true and righteous altogether&quot; is from .

The closing paragraph contains two additional glosses from scripture &quot;let us strive on to... bind up the nation&#x27;s wounds&quot; is a reworking of . Also, &quot;to care for him who shall have borne the battle and for his widow and his orphan&quot; relies on .

Lincoln&#x27;s point seems to be that God&#x27;s purposes are not directly knowable to humans, and represents a theme that he had expressed earlier. After Lincoln&#x27;s death, his secretaries found among his papers an undated manuscript now generally known as the &quot;Meditations on the Divine Will.&quot; In that manuscript, Lincoln wrote:

:The will of God prevails—In great contests each party claims to act in accordance with the will of God. Both &quot;may&quot; be, and one &quot;must&quot; be wrong. God cannot be &quot;for&quot;, and &quot;against&quot; the same thing at the same time. In the present civil war it is quite possible that God&#x27;s purpose is somewhat different from the purpose of either party—and yet the human instrumentalities, working just as they do, are of the best adaptation to effect this.

Lincoln&#x27;s sense that the divine will was unknowable stood in marked contrast to sentiments popular at the time. In the popular mind, both sides of the Civil War assumed that they could read God&#x27;s will and assumed His favor in their opposing causes. Julia Ward Howe&#x27;s &quot;Battle Hymn of the Republic&quot; expressed sentiments common among the supporters of the U.S. cause, that the U.S. was waging a righteous war that served God&#x27;s purposes. &quot;Mine eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the Lord...&quot; Similarly, the Confederacy chose &quot;Deo vindice&quot; as its motto, often translated as &quot;God will vindicate us.&quot; Lincoln, responding to compliments from Thurlow Weed on the speech, said that &quot;... I believe it is not immediately popular. Men are not flattered by being shown that there has been a difference of purpose between the Almighty and them.&quot;

==Inaugural speech==


Among those present for this speech was actor John Wilkes Booth, who, on April 14, 1865, just over a month after Lincoln&#x27;s second inauguration, assassinated him.

==In popular culture==
* An excerpt of the speech was dramatized in the 2012 Steven Spielberg film &quot;Lincoln&quot;, with Daniel Day-Lewis portraying Lincoln.
* An excerpt of the speech was dramatized in the two-hour 2013 National Geographic Channel political docudrama &quot;Killing Lincoln&quot;, with Billy Campbell portraying Lincoln.
*American composer Vincent Persichetti used text from the speech for his work &quot;A Lincoln Address&quot; that had been scheduled for President Richard Nixon&#x27;s inaugural concert January 19, 1973, but was removed from the program after someone in the administration read the text and decided the President would be embarrassed by the excerpt &quot;Fondly do we hope ... that this mighty scourge of war may speedily pass away.&quot; Ironically, four days later, the Vietnam Peace Accords were signed.

<text>The origins of Danish music can be traced back to the Bronze Age. Horns or lurs have been discovered in various parts of Scandinavia, mostly in the region now known as Denmark, since the end of the 18th century. Denmark&#x27;s most famous classical composer is Carl Nielsen, especially remembered for his six symphonies, while the Royal Danish Ballet specializes in the work of Danish choreographer August Bournonville. Danes have distinguished themselves as jazz musicians, and the Copenhagen Jazz Festival has acquired an international reputation. The modern pop and rock scene has produced a few names of note, including MØ, Dizzy Mizz Lizzy, Lukas Graham, D-A-D, Tina Dico, Aqua, The Raveonettes, Michael Learns to Rock, Volbeat, Alphabeat, Safri Duo, Medina, Oh Land, Kashmir, King Diamond, Outlandish, and Mew. Lars Ulrich is the first Danish musician to be inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.

==Origins==
The earliest traces of Danish music go back to the many twisting Bronze-Age horns or lurs which some experts have identified as musical instruments. They have been discovered in various parts of Scandinavia, mostly Denmark, since the end of the 18th century.

In his Gesta Danorum (c.1200), historian Saxo Grammaticus refers to the power that music had over King Erik the Kind-Hearted. In the 13th and early 14th centuries, German minnesingers such as Tannhäuser and Frauenlob sang in the Danish courts. The Codex Runicus (c.1300) contains a verse written in runes with a non-rhythmic musical notation. The first line is &quot;Drømdæ mik æn drøm i nat&quot; (I Dreamed Me a Dream Last Night). There is also evidence that English monks came to Denmark to sing at a celebration commemorating St Canute, who died in 1086. In 1145, Lund Cathedral received Scandinavia&#x27;s first choir statues, and by 1330 it was one of the larger churches to have an organ installed.

==Historical influences==

The greatest influence on the evolution of music in Denmark has certainly been the monarchy. At the time of his coronation in 1448, Christian I engaged a permanent corps of trumpeters, and by 1519 the court had a corps of court singers and an instrumental ensemble as well. The collections of works used by the chapel royal under Christian III in the middle of the 16th century were based on Dutch, Italian, French and German masters. Christian IV spent considerable sums of money on training local musicians and bringing foreign masters to Denmark. Mogens Pedersøn, one of his Danish musicians who had studied in Venice under Giovanni Gabrieli, became one of Denmark&#x27;s most important composers of church music. His principal work &quot;Pratum spirituale&quot; was a collection of 21 Danish hymns in five-part settings, a mass in five parts, three Latin motets and a number of Danish and Latin choral responses. It was published in Copenhagen in 1620 and is still performed today.

Under the influence of Louis XIV of France, music for the theatre was established in Denmark during the reigns of Frederik III and Christian V when lavish court ballets were performed. This soon led to opera and the performance of &quot;Der vereinigte Götterstreit&quot; composed by Povl Christian Schindler on Christian&#x27;s birthday in 1689. Although it was a great success, there was little interest in opera after the theatre caught fire a few days later causing 180 deaths.

In 1569, shortly after the Reformation, Denmark&#x27;s first hymn book, &quot;Thomesens Salmebog&quot;, was published with music for the individual hymns.

Dieterich Buxtehude (c. 1637–1707) was a Danish composer and organist, a highly regarded composer of the Baroque period. His organ works comprise a central part of the standard organ repertoire and are frequently performed at recitals and church services. But he is most remembered for his vocal compositions.

==Classical music==

===Opera, song and concerts===
Frederik IV opened a new opera house in Copenhagen in 1703, the first performance being an opera by the Italian Bartolomeo Bernardi. Reinhard Keiser, the prolific opera composer from Hamburg, presented his works in Copenhagen from 1721 to 1723. In 1748 &quot;Den Danske Skueplads&quot; (the Danish Theatre) moved into a new building and in 1779 &quot;Det Kongelige Kapel&quot; (the Royal Danish Orchestra) became a permanent attachment.

Pietro Mingotti, from Venice, who had formed an opera company was invited to Copenhagen by Queen Louise in 1747. His members included Christoph Willibald Gluck and Giuseppe Sarti. In 1756, Sarti provided the music for the first &quot;syngespil&quot; which, in the early 1790s, became established as a popular national genre with &quot;Høstgildet&quot; (the Harvest Celebration) and &quot;Peters Bryllup&quot; (Peter&#x27;s Wedding). Both were composed by Johann Abraham Peter Schulz. Johann Hartmann is remembered for his two operas on texts by Johannes Ewald in which he helped creating a national musical style. The first of these, &quot;Balders Død&quot;, builds on the old Nordic mythology and uses dark colours when depicting the old Gods and Valkyries. The second, &quot;Fiskerne&quot;, describes contemporary fishermen&#x27;s lives, and uses melodies inspired by the Scandinavian folk style.

Christoph Ernst Friedrich Weyse, from Altona, who was a pupil of Schulz, is remembered above all for his Danish songs, hymns and carols, which remain popular to this day. But he also composed religious music, piano pieces, and symphonies.

Friedrich Kuhlau wrote &quot;Elverhøj&quot; (Elves&#x27; Hill) (1828), which contains the music for &quot;Kong Kristian stod ved højen mast&quot;, a Danish national anthem. Elverhøj is considered to be the first Danish national play and has been performed in Denmark more than any other play. Kuhlau was also a pianist who brought Beethoven&#x27;s piano music to Denmark.

Schulz and Kunzen both gained importance as a result of their influence as chief conductors at the Royal Theatre. They brought the best of European music to Danish audiences. Weyse and Kuhlau contributed not only to orchestral and chamber music, but also to the popular repertory, Weyse with secular and religious songs and Kuhlau with chamber music suitable for amateur musicians.

Another successful composer and conductor in the mid-20th century was Emil Reesen (1887–1964), who is remembered above all for his highly successful operetta Farinelli (1942), which is still popular today.

Opera has continued to figure prominently on the Danish music scene, thanks in part to the Copenhagen Opera House, which was opened in the year 2005. Although the majority of performances cover the works of the well-known European composers, Danish operas are also included from time to time. In 2010, with the involvement of the ambitious young artistic director Kasper Bech Holten, there were performances of Poul Ruders&#x27; new work &quot;Kafka&#x27;s Trial&quot;, while in recent years works by both John Frandsen and Bent Sørensen have been part of the repertoire as well.

===The Golden Age===

The 19th century saw the emergence of a number of Danish composers inspired by Romantic nationalism. Johan Peter Emilius Hartmann (1805–1900), apart from opera and ballet music, contributed to song and the piano repertory. From 1843 until his death, he was the organist at the Church of Our Lady. His works are not only romantic but often inspired by the old Nordic legends. According to Alfred Einstein, it was he who really founded Danish romanticism, if not Scandinavian romanticism altogether. His works had a great influence on the next generation of composers such as Edvard Grieg and Carl Nielsen.

Hans Christian Lumbye (1810–1874) was employed as the first music director at the Copenhagen amusement park Tivoli when it opened in 1843. Here he had a platform for presenting a large foreign and Danish repertory, including his many waltzes and galops. In 1839, he had heard a Viennese orchestra play music by Johann Strauss, after which he composed in the same style, eventually earning the nickname &quot;The Strauss of the North&quot;. One of his most popular pieces, associated with Tivoli, is &quot;Champagnegaloppen&quot; (the Champagne Galop), which starts with the happy sound of a champagne cork popping. It has been used in several Danish films including &quot;Reptilicus&quot; (1961), and &quot;Champagnegaloppen&quot; (1938).

Niels W. Gade (1817–1890) participated in the development of &quot;Musikforeningen&quot; (the Music Society) which had been founded in 1836 with the purpose of extending and improving the understanding of classical music. He became its conductor in 1850, and under his management a number of masterpieces of choral music were given their first performance in Denmark, among them Bach&#x27;s St. Matthew Passion in 1875.
At the conservatory in Copenhagen he helped teach future generations, including Edvard Grieg and Carl Nielsen. In the spirit of Romantic nationalism, he composed eight symphonies, a violin concerto, chamber music, organ and piano pieces and a number of large-scale cantatas, among them &quot;Elverskud&quot; (&quot;The Elf King&#x27;s Daughter&quot;), the most famous Danish work of its kind.

Many other composers were part of this &quot;Golden Age&quot; of Danish music, among which Peter Heise, Emil Hartmann, August Winding, C.F.E. Horneman or Asger Hamerik.

Another major contributor to the Golden Age was August Bournonville (1805–1879), the renowned ballet master and choreographer. From 1830 to 1877, he was the choreographer at the Royal Danish Ballet, for which he created more than 50 ballets admired for their exuberance, lightness, and beauty. He created a style which, although influenced by the Paris ballet, is entirely his own. Bournonville&#x27;s best-known works are &quot;La Sylphide&quot; (1836), &quot;Napoli&quot; (1842), &quot;Le Conservatoire&quot; (1849), &quot;The Kermesse in Bruges&quot; (1851) and &quot;A Folk Tale&quot; (1854). He drew on a number of different composers including Johan Peter Emilius Hartmann, Holger Simon Paulli and Niels Gade. The ballets are widely performed today, not only in Denmark but worldwide, especially in the United States.

===The Carl Nielsen era===
As a result of problems with Germany, Denmark&#x27;s attitude during the first half of the 20th century became nationalistic and introverted. The two leading figures, Carl Nielsen and Thomas Laub revived interest in the purer music of earlier periods such as the Renaissance.
*Carl Nielsen (1865–1931), now an internationally recognized composer, was the dominant figure in Danish music and musical life from the end of the 1890s until well into the 20th century. He had grown up in a small village on Funen but, by performing with folk musicians as a child and as a bugler in the army, he was able to enter the music conservatory in Copenhagen in 1884. By the time he took over Gade&#x27;s role around 1900, Denmark&#x27;s music scene was firmly established with strong popular interest and support. Nielsen&#x27;s orchestral music, including six symphonies and concertos for flute, violin, and clarinet, is widely performed. Indeed, the success of his First Symphony when it was played in Berlin in 1896 paved the way for his growing reputation. The Third Symphony (1912), which contains wordless vocal solos, was performed in the Netherlands, Germany, Sweden and Finland within the first two years. The Fourth Symphony (1916) featuring a battle between two sets of timpani is the one which has been most widely recorded. Maskarade (1906), a three-act opera based on the play by Ludwig Holberg, is regarded as the Danish national opera. Nielsen also composed the opera &quot;Saul og David&quot; (1901) which offers marvellous chorus scenes. Another important choral work is the cantata &quot;Hymnus amoris&quot; (1896), a beautiful composition for choir and orchestra. He is also remembered for the incidental music he wrote for Adam Oehlenschläger&#x27;s play Aladdin as well as for the songs he set to music, many of which are still popular in Denmark.
*Thomas Laub (1852–1927), an organist, was devoted to reintroducing the old Protestant hymn tunes which had been forgotten or altered over the years. He published a number of important works including &quot;Kirkemelodier&quot; (Church Melodies) (1890), &quot;Udvalg af Salme-Melodier i Kirkestil&quot; (Selected Hymn Tunes in the Church Style) (1896 and 1902), &quot;Dansk Kirkesang&quot; (Danish Church Song) (1918) and &quot;Musik og Kirke&quot; (Music and Church) (1920). Laub also wrote folk song music and together with Carl Nielsen published &quot;En Snes danske Viser&quot; (A Set of Danish Folk Songs) (1917).
*Rued Langgaard (1893–1952), a late-Romantic composer, was not fully recognized until 16 years after his death. He was inspired by his conviction that music had a spiritual power and was therefore important for mankind. He was a prolific composer, completing over 400 works representing over 50 hours of music. His Symphony No. 1 &quot;Klippepastoraler&quot; (Rock Pastorals) is in the late-romantic style, reminiscent of Anton Bruckner while Symphony No. 10 &quot;Din Torden-Bolig&quot; (Your Dwelling of Thunder) is also majestic, but more in the style of Richard Strauss

===Contemporary composers===
In addition to those specialising in rock, folk and electronic music, Denmark has a number of contemporary composers who have been successful in writing classical music covering a variety of genres. Among the most successful are:

*Niels Viggo Bentzon (1919-2000) who wrote in a largely neoclassical style 24 symphonies, 16 string quartets, 31 piano sonatas, operas and many more works.
*Per Nørgård (born 1932) has composed works in all major genres: six operas, two ballets, seven symphonies and other pieces for orchestra, several concertos, choral and vocal works, an enormous number of chamber works, ten string quartets and several solo instrumental works. The conductor Sergiu Celibidache once precisely expressed the potential of Nørgård&#x27;s large-scale, faultless creation: &quot;Only the mind of a new time in the new millennium will be able to understand the scope of Nørgård’s music.&quot;
*Anders Koppel (born 1947) has had an extremely versatile career in rock, classical and world music. He has composed the music for eight ballets with the Danish Dance Theatre, 50 theatrical plays and for more than 100 movies.
*Poul Ruders (born 1949) is known internationally for the music he has written for choir, chamber ensemble, and solo instruments, which are frequently performed outside Denmark. It is however is orchestral music, especially his symphonies and concertos, which is most appreciated in Denmark.
*Hans Abrahamsen (born 1952) is one of the most notable contemporary composers whose works have evolved from his initial &quot;New Simplicity&quot; style leading to his internationally successful &quot;Nacht und Trompeten&quot;.

Other notable contemporary composers include Bent Sørensen, and Pelle Gudmundsen-Holmgreen (both winners of the Nordic Council Music Prize), and Frederik Magle (compositions for the Danish royal family).

===Light Classical===
One of the most universally known pieces of Danish music is the &quot;Jalousie &#x27;Tango Tzigane&#x27;&quot; (1925) composed by Jacob Gade. It has been used in countless films, such as the classic Danish sex comedy &quot;I Tvillingernes tegn&quot; (1975), where it is the centerpiece of a big nude dancing production number set in the 1930s, and Sally Potter&#x27;s &quot;The Man Who Cried&quot; (2000), with Johnny Depp playing a gypsy in the 1920s.

A special position is occupied by Bent Fabricius-Bjerre (b. 1924), who has written music for Danish films and television series such as &quot; Matador &quot; in his highly individual style. The signature tune &quot;Alley Cat&quot; quickly won international success in the same class as Gade&#x27;s tango.

==Jazz, rock and popular music==

===Jazz===
Jazz has been one of Denmark&#x27;s most important musical developments over the past century. Its origins can be traced to Valdemar Eiberg&#x27;s band in 1923 and their recordings the following year. But it was in 1925, when Sam Wooding brought his orchestra to Copenhagen that the Danish music scene was properly introduced to the genre. Early Danish jazz was influenced by three classically trained musicians: Erik Tuxen (1902–1957), who created one of the country&#x27;s first jazz bands, Bernhard Christensen (1906–2004), a composer of both jazz and classical music, and Sven Møller Kristensen (1909–1991) who wrote lyrics for Christensen as well as a number of books about jazz.

As jazz became more popular in the 1930s, one of the rising stars was the talented violinist Svend Asmussen (1916–2017) who made his first recordings in 1934 at the age of 18 and was still playing with his quartet more than 70 years later.

During the German occupation in the 1940s, jazz was discouraged but many musicians continued to perform while others escaped to Sweden, including drummer Uffe Baadh. Indeed, the period became known as &quot;The Golden Age of Jazz&quot; as the number of concerts in hotels and restaurants increased and the number of recordings rose from about 180 in 1935–1939 to over 650 from 1940 to 1945.
Following World War II, Danish jazz musicians began to split into an older guard, which maintained the style of older New Orleans jazz, and newer musicians who favored the bebop style of Charlie Parker and Dizzy Gillespie that was then emerging in America. The former were represented by musicians such as pianist Adrian Bentzon, trombonist Papa Bue, and trumpeter Theis Jensen, while the latter included saxophonist Max Brüel, bassist Erik Moseholm, and trumpeter Jørgen Ryg.

In the early 1960s, when there was something of a revival, the Jazzhus Montmartre opened in Copenhagen, reflecting the atmosphere of clubs in Paris and New York City. It soon became a major venue for both Danish and American artists. Many Americans moved to Denmark including Stan Getz, Dexter Gordon, Ben Webster, Lee Konitz and many others. The American pianist Kenny Drew formed a trio with drummer Alex Riel and bassist Niels-Henning Ørsted Pedersen which became a staple at Jazzhus Montmartre. Danish musicians also began to explore free jazz in the 1960s with saxophonist John Tchicai the most prominent proponent. In parallel, a more mainstream wing evolved, including saxophonist Jesper Thilo.

As rock music became more popular in the 1970s, jazz&#x27;s popularity waned, but it continues to be supported in venues such as the Copenhagen Jazzhouse and the Jazz Club Loco, as well as at the annual Copenhagen Jazz Festival. Danish jazz musicians continue to find unity in diversity, exploring a wide range of feelings and genres and bringing new strength to contemporary jazz as it unfolds in all its shapes and sizes. Prominent jazz musicians today include Carsten Dahl, Jørgen Emborg, Thomas Clausen, Fredrik Lundin, Marilyn Mazur, Mads Vinding, Ib Glindemann, Jakob Bro, Chris Minh Doky and his brother Niels Lan Doky.

The organization JazzDanmark, funded by the Danish government, works to promote jazz in Denmark and Danish jazz abroad.

=== Rock ===
In the early days of rock and beat, some Danish artists quickly adapted this new type of music with success. Bands like Peter og Ulvene, Sir Henry and his Butlers, The Beefeaters and later on Steppeulvene (the Steppenwolves), Alrune Rod and Savage Rose were among the popular bands in Denmark throughout the 1960s and early 1970s. Still, Danish rock and pop music in those days resembled more of German schlager than American or British rock.

The Danish rock scene thrived in the 1970s when groups drew on trends in the United States and Britain. Many consider their style to be Danish although this seems mainly to be due to the language of the songs and the way they fit into the national agenda. The most successful have been Gasolin&#x27;, Shu-Bi-Dua, Sebastian, Anne Linnet, Gnags, TV-2, and more recently Magtens Korridorer. Kim Larsen who had played with Gasolin&#x27; went on to become a very successful solo artist in his own right while Sebastian has composed a number of successful musicals for theatre and film. The versatile Anne Linnet is still popular in Denmark today.

Until fairly recently, few Danish rock groups had been successful outside Denmark. An exception was D-A-D (formerly Disneyland After Dark) who had a hit with Sleeping My Day Away in the early 1990s. Today, however, with the Music Export Denmark initiative, several rock bands are doing increasingly well internationally. These include Mew, Iceage, Volbeat, Kashmir, The Raveonettes, and Blue Van.
Other rock artists worth mentioning are The Kissaway Trail, Junior Senior, Nephew, Carpark North, Saybia, VETO, Swan Lee, Dúné, Volbeat and Dizzy Mizz Lizzy which has just had a revival.

Famous Danish rock and metal musicians include Lars Ulrich, the drummer and co-founder of Metallica, Mike Tramp, the vocalist and co-songwriter of White Lion, and Kim Bendix Petersen, aka King Diamond, vocalist of Danish heavy metal band Mercyful Fate and the eponymous King Diamond.

The annual Roskilde Festival is held in Danish city of Roskilde. The festival is the second-largest in Europe with ticket sales normally running from 70,000 to 100,000. The festival has featured many prominent artists (mainly rock), such as Nirvana, Guns N&#x27; Roses, Slipknot, Kings of Leon, U2, Bob Dylan, Black Sabbath and Green Day, and there has also been an emphasis on world music, alternative genres and Danish music at the festival. In 2000, the festival suffered a terrible accident during a Pearl Jam concert where nine people were crushed by the wild crowds, making security a primary issue of the following festivals. The festival has suffered no further incidents of the kind.

Denmark also participates in the annual Eurovision Song Contest, and holds its own Dansk Melodi Grand Prix competition to select the song that will represent the country in the Eurovision contest. Denmark has won the Eurovision Song Contest three times: first with Grethe &amp; Jørgen Ingmann&#x27;s &quot;Dansevise&quot; in 1963; the second with Brødrene Olsen&#x27;s (Olsen Brothers) &quot;Fly on the Wings of Love&quot; (from the Danish &quot;Smuk Som Et Stjerneskud&quot;, literally &quot;Beautiful as a shooting star&quot;) in 2000. And most recently, in 2013, Emmelie de Forest with &quot;Only Teardrops&quot; scored 281 points at Malmö, winning the contest with a margin of 47 points over runner-up Azerbaijan. Denmark therefore hosted the Eurovision Song Contest 2014 in Copenhagen.

The Danish entrants at the Eurovision Song Contest 2010, Christina Chanée and Tomas N&#x27;evergreen with &quot;In a Moment Like This&quot;, were already doing well in Eastern Europe ahead of the contest as their song became the most popular download in several countries.

Some hit songs of Danish origin have become international hits after being covered by foreign artists. Vengaboys covered The Walkers&#x27; &quot;Shalala Lala&quot;, Jamelia covered Christine Milton&#x27;s &quot;Superstar&quot;, Shayne Ward covered Bryan Rice&#x27;s &quot;No Promises&quot; and Celine Dion covered Tim Christensen&#x27;s &quot;Right Next to the Right One&quot;. Different covers of Rune&#x27;s &quot;Calabria&quot; have also been international hits.

===Electronic music===

Else Marie Pade was a Danish pioneer in electronic music as early as the 1950s. She knew and worked with Pierre Schaeffer and Karlheinz Stockhausen and has continued to make appearances on the Danish electronica scene well into the new millennium. With his Coma parties, Kenneth Bager brought acid house to Denmark in 1988 and was active in building a Danish club scene, moving venues from the discothèques to deserted factories and basements. The most successful Danish electronic musician internationally is Trentemøller while from a very early age Mike Sheridan has achieved success and been labelled a name of the future. In the more mainstream part of the genre, Safri Duo also experienced international success with their mixture of tribal sound and electronica; also in the electronic scene adding elements of string and brass instruments is the indie folk/electronic four-piece Efterklang.

A leading Danish venue for electronic music is Culture Box in Copenhagen which is subsidised by the Ministry of Culture as a regional music venue, enabling it to keep a high artistic profile. The Strøm and Copenhagen Distortion festivals are also dedicated to the capital&#x27;s electronic and club music scene.

Jesper Kyd is a famous Danish video game composer, who has been incorporating sounds of dark ambient, electronic and symphonic music into his music and has won many awards.

Martin Jensen with the UK hit &quot;Solo Dance&quot;.

=== Folk ===

Traditionally, Danish folk music has relied on a fiddle and accordion duo but, unlike its Scandinavian neighbours, Danish fiddlers almost always play in groups with few solo performance. Danish bands also tend to feature the guitar more prominently than the other Nordic countries.

Fiddle and accordion duos play generally rhythmic dance music, local versions of the Nordic folk dance music. The oldest variety is called pols, and it is now mostly found on Fanø with variants such as &quot;Sønderhoning&quot; from Sønderho.

The first systematic collection of popular folk songs, some of which go back centuries, was undertaken by the folklore collector Evald Tang Kristensen (1843–1929). These important sources were then transferred to the Danish Folklore Archives, established in 1904. The popular dance music tradition was continued into the 20th century by musicians such as the violinist Evald Thomsen (1913–93).

Danish traditional music experienced a renaissance when the Anglo-American folk song wave hit Denmark around 1970. Among the prominent soloists, often composing new songs, were Sebastian, Poul Dissing and Niels Hausgaard. The successful Lars Lilholt Band led by the violinist Lars Lilholt combines the folk music tradition with rock. A new and refreshing combination of techno music and medieval ballads has been provided by the group Sorten Muld since their first recording in 1996.

The formation of the Danish Folk Council to actively promote folk music both at home and abroad has helped raise the profile. Curiously, Danish folk music received its biggest boost from the home chart success of Sorten Muld, who used acoustic and electric instruments and electronica on old songs to create something very contemporary on its best-selling albums. Some of the best-known artists in recent years include Harald Haugaard and Dreamers&#x27; Circus.

== Music schools ==
As part of the reform of Danish municipalities in 2008 it was established by law that each of the 98 municipalities runs a music school. The first Danish music schools were formed in the 1930s with inspiration from Germany. From 1991 Musikloven – Law on Music – has had a chapter on music schools. According to the law the purposes of the music schools are to develop and support the musical talents and knowledge and to enhance music in the local communities. The primary goal is to engage with children and youth (0–24 years), but activities for adults are also possible. The financing of the music schools are divided among state, municipality and students (or parents of students).

==Music in everyday life==
Music is an important part of the lives of most Danes. One of the carefully observed traditions is to include music at celebrations at large, including family oriented ones such as wedding parties, birthdays and anniversaries. Indeed, it is not only common to engage one or more musicians for dancing but it is usual for the guests to write songs, normally to well-known traditional tunes, in honour of those to be celebrated.

There is also a popular tradition of choir singing. There are hundreds of amateur choirs throughout Denmark, usually specialising in traditional Danish songs or folk music.

Denmark has two national anthems, which are widely performed. &quot;Der er et yndigt land&quot; (There Is a Lovely Country) is sung loudly and enthusiastically at sporting events and is the most popular. Lyrics are by the Danish poet Adam Oehlenschläger and music by Hans Ernst Krøyer. &quot;Kong Kristian stod ved højen mast&quot; (King Christian Stood by Tow&#x27;ring Mast), is sung on official occasions when the royal family is represented. Lyrics are by Johannes Ewald while music was probably written by Ditlev Ludwig Rogert and can be heard in the final tableau of Elverhøj.

==Popular venues==

In recent years, there have been two important developments for the Danish music scene. The first was the opening of the Copenhagen Opera House in 2005 where ever since full houses have applauded the performances of the great European operas and some of Denmark&#x27;s more recent contributions. The other was the completion of Danmarks Radio&#x27;s Concert Hall in 2009 where the national broadcaster not only presents its orchestral music but also choirs, jazz, rock and pop.

Other important venues for music include:

*The Old Stage of the Royal Danish Theatre in the centre of Copenhagen where in particular performances of the Royal Danish Ballet can be seen.
*The Tivoli Concert Hall in the Tivoli Gardens where orchestral music, singers, jazz and other musical events feature in the programme every summer, frequently with the participation of the Tivoli Symphony Orchestra.
*Det Ny Theater in Copenhagen specializes in Danish productions of musicals.
*Musikhuset Aarhus, the Concert Hall of Aarhus, presents a wide variety of classical and popular music including singing and dance.

== Festivals ==

Music festivals are plentiful throughout the country and are very popular, with more than 130,000 attendees at Roskilde Festival, the largest music festival in Northern Europe and around 300,000 partygoers to Copenhagen Distortion street festival. Many smaller recurring music festivals of all genres are held throughout and on all times of the year. This includes the Copenhagen Jazz Festival, the traveling Grøn Koncert, Tønder Festival, Aalborg Opera Festival, Thy Chamber Music Festival and Skagen Festival, among many others.

<text>Venus&#x27; flower basket (Euplectella aspergillum) is a species of marine glass sponge found in the deep waters of the Pacific Ocean, usually at depths below . Like other sponges, they feed by filtering sea water to capture plankton and marine snow. Similar to other glass sponges, they build their skeletons out of silica, which forms a unique lattice structure of spicules. The sponges are usually between and tall, and their bodies act as refuge for their mutualist shrimp partners. This body structure is of great interest in materials science as the optical and mechanical properties are in some ways superior to man-made materials. Little is known regarding their reproduction habits, however fluid dynamics of their body structure likely influence reproduction and it is hypothesized that they may be hermaphroditic.

==Habitat==
Venus&#x27; flower baskets are found in the western Pacific Ocean nearby the Philippine Islands. Other species of this genus occur throughout oceans around the world, including near Japan and in the Indian Ocean.

This sponge&#x27;s habitat is on the rocky areas of the benthic seafloor, where it lives and grows connected to hard substrate for its entire life. It can be found from 100 m to 1000 m (330 ft to 3300 ft) below the ocean&#x27;s surface, and is most common at depths greater than 500 m. More specifically, they tend to anchor in soft sediments due to the nature of their spicules.

Connecting habitat to morphology, this sponge can often be found inhabiting loose, muddy sediments, causing them to develop a structure that would aid them in staying rooted to the sea floor.

==Morphology==

The body is tubular, curved and basket-like and made up of triaxon spicules. The body is perforated by numerous apertures, which are not true but simply parietal gaps. Syconoid type of canal system is present, where ostia communicate with incurrent canals, which communicates with radial canals through s which, in turn, open into the spongocoel and to the outside through the osculum.

The body structure of these animals is a thin-walled, cylindrical, vase-shaped tube with a large central atrium. The body is composed entirely of silica in the form of 6-pointed siliceous spicules, which is why they are commonly known as glass sponges. The spicules are composed of three perpendicular rays, giving them six points. Spicules are microscopic, pin-like structures within the sponge&#x27;s tissues that provide structural support for the sponge. It is the combination of spicule forms within a sponge&#x27;s tissues that helps identify the species. In the case of glass sponges, the spicules &quot;weave&quot; together to form a very fine mesh, which gives the sponge&#x27;s body a rigidity not found in other sponge species and allows glass sponges to survive at great depths in the water column.

It is speculated that the sponge harnesses bioluminescence to attract plankton. Its lattice shape also allows it to house animals like shrimp while remaining rooted in the ground.

Their peculiar skeletal motifs have been found to have important fluid-dynamic effects on both reducing the drag experienced by the sponge and in promoting coherent swirling motions inside the body cavity, arguably to promote selective filter feeding and sexual reproduction. In a study performed by a group of Italian researchers, a three-dimensional model of Venus&#x27; Flower Basket was utilized to simulate the flow of water molecules in and out of its lattice. The researchers found that, while reducing the sponge&#x27;s drag, it also created minute vortices inside the sponge which facilitated the mixing of its sperm and eggs; additionally, making feeding more efficient for the shrimp living inside of its lattice.

&quot;E. aspergillum&quot; differs in having anchorate basalia with six teeth, and diactins.

The skeleton of these sponges also contain silica nanoparticles among other biomaterials.

== Reproduction ==
As said in the introduction, little is known about reproduction. Sperm was found in one sample of &quot;E. aspergillum,&quot; within the connective tissue, and was described as aggregated clusters within very fine, thread-like appendages. This would contribute to the idea of the species being hermaphroditic. While these sponges are sessile, the sperm can be carried by the current and the ova that a different organism retained can be fertilized. It is also suggested that this species reproduces sexually, which can be deduced by the occurrence of their &quot;internal recirculation patterns&quot;.    

== Mutualistic relationship ==
The sponges are often found to house glass sponge shrimp, usually a breeding pair, who are typically unable to exit the sponge&#x27;s lattice due to their size. Consequently, they live in and around these sponges, where the shrimp perform a mutualistic relationship with the sponge until they die. The shrimp live and mate in the shelter that the sponge provides, and in return they also clean the inside of the sponge. This may have influenced the adoption of the sponge as a symbol of undying love in Japan, where the skeletons of these sponges are presented as wedding gifts.

== Ecology ==
While there is not much known about the ecology of these sponges, more research has been done on its class, Hexactinellid sponges. Hexactinellids in the Pacific ocean form reefs on the sea floor many of which are extinct now, but thrived in the Jurassic period. The role they play ecologically can be connected to their feeding on plankton in the deep sea, which produces carbon within their environments. Besides this, they can house many animals that reside on the seafloor, including the shrimps mentioned in previous sections.

== Ecosystem Role/Other Facts ==
In a study done with various glass sponges, Venus&#x27; Flower Basket was noted to be difficult to extract any further information because of how inaccessible it serves to be. However, when in contact with alkali, these sponges showed a high resistance, which then led researchers to believe that they potentially contain biomaterials like chitin, that could serve as a structural component to this species. This study suggests that as long as &quot;E. aspergillum&quot; and similar species are natural composites containing valuable biomaterials, they could be important in biomedicine and future biotechnology.

== Anthropomorphic applications ==

The glassy fibers that attach the sponge to the ocean floor, 5–20 centimetres (2–8 in) long and thin as human hair, are of interest to fiber optics researchers. The sponge extracts silicic acid from seawater and converts it into silica, then forms it into an elaborate skeleton of glass fibers. Other sponges such as the orange puffball sponge (&quot;Tethya aurantium&quot;) can also produce glass biologically. The current manufacturing process for optical fibers requires high temperatures and produces a brittle fiber. A low-temperature process for creating and arranging such fibers, inspired by sponges, could offer more control over the optical properties of the fibers. These nano-structures are also potentially useful for the creation of more efficient, low-cost solar cells. Furthermore, its skeletal structure has inspired a new type of structural lattice with a higher strength to weight ratio than other diagonally reinforced square lattices used in engineering applications.

These sponges skeletons have complex geometric configurations, which have been extensively studied for their stiffness, yield strength, and minimal crack propagation. An aluminum tube (aluminum and glass have similar elastic modulus) of equal length, effective thickness, and radius, but homogeneously distributed, has 1/100 the stiffness.

Besides these remarkable structural properties, Falcucci et al. found that their peculiar skeletal motifs deliver important fluid-dynamic effects on both reducing the drag experienced by the sponge and in promoting coherent swirling motions inside the body cavity, arguably to promote selective filter feeding and sexual reproduction.

Rao&#x27;s work on biomimicry in architecture describes the architectural inspiration gleaned from the Venus&#x27; Flower Basket structure, notably in connection with Norman Foster&#x27;s design for Gherkin tower in London.

<text>The Power Station were a British-American 1980s/1990s rock and pop music supergroup originally formed in New York City and London in 1984. It was made up of singer Robert Palmer, former Chic drummer Tony Thompson, and Duran Duran members John Taylor (bass) and Andy Taylor (guitar). Bernard Edwards, also of Chic, was involved on the studio side as recording producer and for a short time also functioned as the Power Station&#x27;s manager. Edwards also replaced John Taylor on bass for the recording of the band&#x27;s second album. The band was formed in New York City late in 1984 during a break in Duran Duran&#x27;s schedule that became a lengthy hiatus. The Power Station was named after the Power Station recording studio in New York, where their first album was conceived and recorded.

==Origins==
On 23 July 1983, Duran Duran&#x27;s charity concert at Villa Park in aid of Mencap, a UK charity, took place in Birmingham. Duran Duran had been known to be huge fans of Robert Palmer, so he was invited to participate.

After Duran Duran&#x27;s third album, &quot;Seven and the Ragged Tiger&quot;, the members of the band took a planned short hiatus, going into two projects. One of these was the band Arcadia, featuring frontman Simon Le Bon and keyboardist Nick Rhodes, which maintained the melodic and atmospheric aspects of Duran Duran&#x27;s previous recordings. The other was the Power Station, in which bassist John Taylor and guitarist Andy Taylor worked with Palmer, Thompson, and Edwards to explore more rhythmic and aggressive music rooted in funk and rock and roll. Roger Taylor was mainly the drummer for Arcadia but also contributed percussion to the Power Station.

The group began as something of a whim—it was a one-time gathering of friends to provide backing to model and would-be singer Bebe Buell, who wanted to record a cover of the 1971 T. Rex song &quot;Get It On&quot;. Both John Taylor and Andy Taylor were eager to branch out from the synthesizer-heavy pop of Duran Duran and play some Led Zeppelin-flavoured rock and roll. The participation of their idols from Chic lent the project a horn-inflected funk vibe that meshed surprisingly well with the crunching guitars and booming drums.

Soon, the project evolved into the idea of a revolving supergroup; a tentative name for the band was Big Brother. The original plan for the one-album project was for the three musicians (the two Taylors and Thompson) to provide musical continuity to an album full of material, with a different singer performing on each track. Those who were approached included Mick Jagger, Billy Idol, Mars Williams, Richard Butler (of the Psychedelic Furs), and Mick Ronson.

The group then invited Palmer to record vocals for the track &quot;Communication&quot;. When he heard that they had recorded demos for &quot;Get It On&quot;, he asked to try out vocals on that song as well. They decided to record the entire album with him. The group was signed with Capitol Records.

On 16 February 1985, the band performed &quot;Some Like It Hot&quot; and &quot;Get It On&quot; on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;. It was the only time that Robert Palmer performed live with the original line-up. The horn section for the Power Station&#x27;s &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; appearance included saxophonist Lenny Pickett, who would join the show&#x27;s house band that fall and eventually become the show&#x27;s musical director.

In March 1985, the Power Station issued a self-titled album produced by Bernard Edwards, with some informal assistance from Nile Rodgers. It reached number 12 in the United Kingdom and number 6 on the United States album chart.

The record is sometimes referred to as &quot;Power Station 33 ⅓&quot; as the sleeve for the original vinyl record release bore that subtitle, indicating the speed of a record turntable. Compact disc issues used &quot;CD&quot; as a subtitle instead, while initial cassette copies highlighted Columbia&#x27;s &quot;XDR&quot; process. The album&#x27;s cover graphics and color scheme, which were also used in the videos, were based on sketches by John Taylor.

Three singles were released from the album, two of them major hits. The first, &quot;Some Like It Hot&quot;, reached #14 on the UK Singles Chart and #6 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. (The music video featured model Caroline Cossey, credited by her nickname &quot;Tula&quot;.) The second single, &quot;Get It On&quot;, went to #22 in the United Kingdom and #9 in the United States, while competing against the Duran Duran single &quot;A View to a Kill&quot;, which was an American number one. &quot;Communication&quot; was not as successful, reaching #34 in the United States, but disappeared after hitting #75 in the United Kingdom.

The band also released a collection of their three music videos called &quot;The Power Station Video EP&quot;.

The group&#x27;s unexpected success led to two incompatible results: first, they decided to headline a summer tour in America with Paul Young, Nik Kershaw, the Bongos, and Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark; second, Robert Palmer decided to record a solo album to take advantage of his sudden name recognition. This led to Palmer&#x27;s departure from the band. (Tony Thompson, Andy Taylor, and future Power Station bass player Bernard Edwards all contributed to Palmer&#x27;s highly successful 1985 solo album &quot;Riptide&quot;).

When Palmer bailed on the tour, some critics referred to it as &quot;unprofessional behaviour&quot;. Speaking to &quot;Number One&quot; magazine in 1986, he hit back at the claims he joined the band for money: &quot;Firstly, I didn&#x27;t need the money and, secondly the cash was a long time coming. It wasn&#x27;t exactly an experience that set me up for retirement.&quot;

Palmer was also accused of ripping off the Power Station sound for his own records. He snapped: &quot;Listen, I gave &quot;The Power Station&quot; that sound. They took it from me, not the other way around.&quot;

With Palmer bowing out, the band recruited singer/actor Michael Des Barres (formerly of Silverhead, Chequered Past, and Detective) for the tour. Des Barres also performed with them at the Live Aid charity concert in Philadelphia that summer.

Des Barres&#x27; friendship with actor Don Johnson led to the band&#x27;s guest appearance on an episode of the television drama &quot;Miami Vice&quot;. Similarly, his friendship with producer Joel Silver led to the Power Station writing a song called &quot;We Fight for Love&quot; for the Arnold Schwarzenegger action film &quot;Commando&quot; (1985). The track was originally titled &quot;Someday, Somehow, Someone&#x27;s Gotta Pay&quot;. An EP containing the song plus some live songs from their tour was planned for release that same year, but was scrapped by their record company.

The band folded in late 1985 as its members turned to other projects. John Taylor returned to Duran Duran, while Andy Taylor chose to leave Duran Duran in favour of a solo career. A reformed Led Zeppelin played at the Live Aid concert in 1985, with Thompson sharing drumming duties with Phil Collins. Thompson was to take the place of John Bonham in a reformed Led Zeppelin, but after a few days of rehearsals in 1986, he was seriously injured in a car accident and the reunion never got off the ground. Palmer continued his revitalized solo career, while Des Barres released his second solo album in 1986.

==Reunions and reissues==
The Power Station reunited in 1996 with its original members: Robert Palmer, Andy Taylor, John Taylor, and Tony Thompson. The group worked together on writing and arranging a new album; however, personal problems forced bassist John Taylor to withdraw from the project and leave the band before any recording took place. Producer Bernard Edwards (Chic bassist) stepped in to become the Power Station&#x27;s bassist and new fourth member, playing all bass parts on &quot;Living in Fear&quot; (1996).

Edwards was prepared to tour with the group, but then died suddenly of pneumonia during a trip to Japan. The Power Station decided to press on as a trio augmented by session musicians, and toured first with bassist Guy Pratt and then Manny Yanes and second guitarist Luke Morley, to moderate success. They disbanded shortly after.

In 2002, EMI Music issued &quot;The Best of The Power Station&quot; as part of their Ten Best Series. All tracks are from the first album (some in remixed form), except for &quot;Taxman&quot; from &quot;Living in Fear&quot; and the final track, a previously unreleased live version of &quot;Dancing in the Street&quot;, recorded at the Hartford Civic Center in 1985 and sung by Michael Des Barres.

Both Robert Palmer and Tony Thompson died in late 2003.

EMI released a new version of the album &quot;The Power Station&quot; on 21 February 2005, to commemorate the album&#x27;s 20th anniversary. The package includes the original eight-song album, seven bonus tracks (mostly remixes), and a 40-minute eight-chapter DVD. Among the bonus tracks on the album is the track &quot;Someday, Somehow, Someone&#x27;s Gotta Pay&quot; (from the &quot;Commando OST&quot;), sung by Michael Des Barres.

<doc id="374126" wikidata="Q57209401" url="?curid=374126" title="The Maxx">
<text>The Maxx is an American comic book series created by Sam Kieth in 1993 and originally published monthly until 1998 by Image Comics for 35 issues, before being collected in trade paperback by DC Comics&#x27; Wildstorm imprint. The first appearance of the character was in &quot;Darker Image&quot; #1 by Image Comics in March 1993. The comic book, starring an eponymous purple-skinned hero, spawned a 13-episode animated series on MTV that originally aired April–June 1995. Starting in November 2013 and ending in September 2016, the original series has been republished by IDW as &quot;The Maxx: Maxximized&quot; with new colors and improved scans of the original artwork by Sam Kieth and Jim Sinclair. In 2018, the Maxx featured in a five-issue crossover series with Batman, published by IDW.

The series follows the adventures of the titular hero in two worlds: The real world and an alternate reality referred to as the Outback (presumably named metaphorically after the real Australian outback). In the real world, Maxx is a vagrant, a &quot;homeless man living in a box&quot;, while in the Outback, he is the powerful protector of the Jungle-Queen, who exists in the real world as Julie Winters, a freelance social worker who often bails Maxx out of jail. While Maxx is aware of the Outback, Julie is not, though it is integral to both of their stories.

==Plot summary==

===Main story arc===
Mr. Gone, a serial rapist with a telepathic link to Julie, has extensive knowledge of and access to other people&#x27;s Outbacks. He starts phoning Julie, but she thinks he is merely an obscene phone caller and ignores him. Eventually, the Maxx gets in Gone&#x27;s way by &quot;protecting&quot; Julie. Gone tries to kill him with assistance from the Outback&#x27;s main predators, the Isz. The Maxx fights him in both the Outback and the real world.

Eventually, Mr. Gone makes Julie see the truth about her past and reveals to her how the Maxx came to be. Gone first met Julie when she was a child as &quot;Uncle Artie&quot;, a friend of her father; his tall tales about a visit to Australia helped shape Julie&#x27;s Outback. As Julie begins healing herself and the Outback, the series starts following Sara, a depressed teenager whose mother sends her to Julie for counseling. Sara is often in conflict with her mother, who disciplines her so she will not grow up to be like her father - Mr. Gone.

===Backstory===
The backstories of several characters are revealed midway through the series. While in college, Julie picks up a hitch-hiker who beats and rapes her, leaving her to die. To cope, she hides in what is referred to as her &quot;Outback&quot; (a primeval landscape situated entirely in her subconscious, where she has control). In the Outback, she becomes &quot;The Jungle Queen&quot;, an all-powerful goddess. She spends so much time dwelling in her Outback that the real world and the Outback gradually become unstable.

One night, she accidentally hits a homeless man with her car. Remembering what happened the last time she stopped to help someone, she covers the unconscious body with trash, but in doing so unintentionally creates a link between it and the Outback. After Julie leaves a lampshade in the trash, which had previously brushed the Outback, it expands over the man&#x27;s body and becomes a mask that consumes and links him to Julie, transforming him into the Maxx.

===Second storyline===
After the conclusion of the first storyline, the action leaps forward from 1995 (the then-present) to the year 2005. Julie and Dave (the former Maxx) having vanished, the action focuses on Sara (as she now spells her name) and &quot;Iago&quot;, a giant, murderous banana slug from her Outback. Iago has a list of people to kill, and it turns out that Julie and Sara are both on it. Sara is hounded by a homeless man named Norbert whom she soon realizes is her Maxx. Sara has constant confrontations with Mr. Gone, who is repentant of his past crimes. He is visited by three special agents intent on arresting him, but he turns them into insects. Later, after reading a diary he leaves for her that reveals his tragic origin story, Sara eventually feels sympathy for and a connection to her father. She also begins developing a strange power that she may be inheriting from Mr. Gone.

Julie and Dave return to the story after Julie is attacked by Iago and loses a few fingers. It turns out that Julie abandoned her son, Mark, to keep him safe from Iago. She tries to have Dave tell Mark that she&#x27;s dead so he&#x27;ll stop seeking her out, but Mark does not believe him. Sara, Dave, Mark, Mr. Gone and Norbert band together to rescue Julie from Iago, who kidnaps and takes her into Sara&#x27;s outback. Norbert cuts Iago open, apparently defeating him, but Julie has already escaped.

Mr. Gone soon reveals that time is unraveling for the group, which now includes Glorie, one of Mr. Gone&#x27;s past victims who now has a friendly relationship with him. Gone returns Dave&#x27;s Maxx power to him. Sara returns as a being whom different people perceive as a giant Isz, pink fairy, or football. Mark has an odd dream about eccentric kidnappers. Each member of the group begins to disappear from reality to be reborn in another. Before Mr. Gone can disappear, the three agents who previously tried to arrest him, now appearing as humanoid beings with insect bug heads, return and kill him, as he expected. Mark is the last to disappear.

In Julie&#x27;s outback, Mr. Gone is reunited with Sara, who is now a child again. The Maxx considers attacking him, but the Jungle Queen says to leave him be, because even evil deserves a place to rest.

In the new reality, Mr. Gone is a professor and Dave is a janitor at his school. Julie and Mark are still mother and son, but seem to live in better conditions. All the principal characters now lead completely distinct lives, yet retain a small part of their connection to the Outback and to each other.

==Spirit animals==
One of the dominant concepts of &quot;The Maxx&quot; is that every human being has a spirit animal, which is linked to the person during a pivotal moment in their life. Julie&#x27;s spirit animal is a rabbit. When she was very young, Julie rescued a dying rabbit that lay in the road in front of her house (as seen in &quot;The Maxx&quot; #12). Julie later witnessed her mother bludgeoning the rabbit to death with a shovel to put it out of its misery. This traumatic event linked the rabbit to Julie&#x27;s subconscious. Julie projects the rabbit onto Dave as she tries to take care of him like the rabbit she was unable to save. Maxx, who is linked to Julie and her spirit animal, worries that, if he removes his mask, he will find the head of a rabbit beneath it.

Sarah&#x27;s spirit animal is a horse. In the latter half of the series, this spirit animal manifests itself as Norbert, a homeless man she takes pity on.

==Isz==
The main inhabitants of The Outback, the Isz are small, eyeless beings with egg-shaped bodies, arms and legs, about as large as housecats. The omnivorous white Isz of the Outback become cannibalistic black Isz when brought into the real world. They are stronger, faster, and have sharper teeth than white Isz. However, in one instance, a single White Isz was able to cross over into the real world unchanged when there was a small punctured hole in an alley wall that directly connected both realities. The Black Isz proceeded to torture their less aggressive kin after its initial mission had been completed, showing the completely opposite degrees of aggression the two types exhibit. The Black Isz can assume different appearances depending on the clothes they wear, and their intent. If an Isz is dressed as an elderly woman, it appears as such to anyone who does not know already that it is an Isz. In the latter part of the series, Sara&#x27;s Isz appear as pink, flying, eyeless fairies that explode if not kept in water.

=== Other issues ===
An earlier version of Maxx, still called Max the Hare, made his first appearance in &quot;Primer&quot; #5 (1983). Other Maxx issues include his modern version comic book debut, in an 8-page spread in the first and only issue of &quot;Darker Image&quot; (March 1993), an incomplete anthology series from Image Comics, as well as &quot;The Maxx&quot; #½ (June 1993) and a &quot;Gen13/The Maxx&quot; crossover (December 1995). Recently, IDW published another crossover series of five issues, &quot;Batman/The Maxx&quot; (October 2018–February 2019).

* &quot;Batman/The Maxx: The Lost Year Compendium&quot;: Issues #1–3 (Kindle Edition) (September 2020)
* &quot;Batman/The Maxx: Arkham Dreams&quot;: Issues #1–5, (2021)

==Cameos==
The Maxx has made cameo appearances in the graphic novel &quot;Popbot&quot; Book 2 (which Kieth co-wrote), issue #1 of the independent comic &quot;Armature&quot;, the Sonic the Hedgehog comic &quot;Sonic Super Special &quot;#7 Sonic/Image Crossover, the three issue limited series &quot;Altered Image&quot;, &quot; Bloodwulf&quot; #2, &quot;The Savage Dragon&quot; #28 (collected in &quot;Savage Dragon Vol. 7: A Talk With God&quot;), and &quot;Troll Halloween Special&quot; #1. He also briefly appears in the series &quot;Mars Attacks Image&quot;. He appears on a TV screen on the Frostbite version of the cover to &quot;DV8 #1&quot;. Maxx stories have also appeared in &quot;Gay Comics&quot; #24 and IDW Publishing&#x27;s &quot;Hero Comics 2014&quot;. In 2018, Maxx made a long-awaited comeback with Batman in the &quot;Arkham Dreams&quot; series.

==Television series==
The comic book series was adapted into an animated series as part of the MTV program &quot;Oddities&quot;. The show covered &quot;Darker Image&quot; #1, &quot;The Maxx&quot; #1/2, and issues #1–11 of the regular series and depicted the introduction of Julie, the original Maxx, Mr. Gone, and, later on in the series, Sarah. Therefore, the TV show did not go into the same depth (e.g. revealing the origins of all the characters) as the comic series.

The animation frequently changes style: in one scene, characters may be rendered in detail, but in the next, they may be simplified cartoons. Often, this is done to show a change in perspective. CGI and even live-action film are sometimes integrated or interspersed with the hand-drawn animation. Critics such as Richard Matthes have noted how much of the animation is based directly on panels from the comic.

===Home media===

In 1996, the complete series was released on VHS with a runtime of approximately 2 hours. In 2009, it became available to stream on MTV.com, though only to U.S. audiences. On December 17, 2009, &quot;The Maxx&quot; became available on DVD exclusively through Amazon&#x27;s CreateSpace &quot;Manufacture-on-Demand&quot; program; it contains every episode of the TV show and also includes audio commentary on each episode, plus interviews with creator Sam Kieth and director Gregg Vanzo.

===Voice actors===
*Michael Haley as The Maxx
*Glynnis Talken as Julie Winters and Glorie
*Amy Danles as Sarah
*Barry Stigler as Mr. Gone

==Other media==

===Role-playing game===
An adventure for the &quot;Heroes &amp; Heroines&quot; role-playing game was released using &quot;The Maxx&quot; characters and setting.

===Soundtrack===
An audio drama comic adaptation, &quot;MAXXimum Sound: A Comic Book Soundtrack&quot;, was made from the first three issues of the comic book and released on audio cassette in 1993. It was created by Stephen Romano and managed by Smiles Lewis.

===Video game===
In 2008, Chris Vick made an Atari Jaguar (1993 console) video game demo based on the Maxx for the &quot;JagCode II&quot; contest. Being the winner of the contest, it is available on the &quot;JagCode II&quot; website.

===Film===
On November 22, 2019, Channing Tatum and Roy Lee announced their intent to produce a film based on &quot;The Maxx&quot;. In January 2024, Tatum confirmed on his Instagram that production on the film was moving forward.

<doc id="374127" wikidata="Q6942371" url="?curid=374127" title="Music of the Faroe Islands">
<text>Faroese music is primarily vocal, accompanied by the fiddle (which arrived in the 17th century) and European dances like the minuet and polka. During the twentieth century choirs have played an important role in the musical history of the Faroes, and some of the best known current choirs are Tarira, Havnarkórið, Tórshavnar Manskór, Ljómur, Fuglafjarðar Gentukór, and the choirs situated in Copenhagen: Húsakórið and Mpiri.

== History ==
Much of the imported music and instruments remained popular only in the capital and largest city, Tórshavn. Rural peoples remained true to traditions of chain dance and ballads. The three types of dance ballads are kvæði, tættir and vísur. Many of these dance forms were revived after World War 2, when a number of dance societies were formed. The ballads were largely compiled in &quot;Corpus Carminum Færoensium&quot;, which collected over 44,000 stanzas.

Other songs include skjaldur, fantastic fairy tales sung by adults for children, and pitch-sliding, microtonal hymns called kingosálmar. In her magnum opus about Faroese folk singing, Marianne Clausen comprehensively described the various genres, and presented about 3,300 music transcriptions of folk singing melodies.

== Modern musicians ==

<text>In set theory, a regular cardinal is a cardinal number that is equal to its own cofinality. More explicitly, this means that formula_1 is a regular cardinal if and only if every unbounded subset formula_2 has cardinality formula_1. Infinite well-ordered cardinals that are not regular are called singular cardinals. Finite cardinal numbers are typically not called regular or singular.

In the presence of the axiom of choice, any cardinal number can be well-ordered, and then the following are equivalent for a cardinal formula_1:
# formula_1 is a regular cardinal.
# If formula_6 and formula_7 for all formula_8, then formula_9.
# If formula_10, and if formula_11 and formula_12 for all formula_8, then formula_14. That is, every union of fewer than formula_1 sets smaller than formula_1 is smaller than formula_1.
# The category formula_18 of sets of cardinality less than formula_1 and all functions between them is closed under colimits of cardinality less than formula_1.
# formula_1 is a regular ordinal (see below).
Crudely speaking, this means that a regular cardinal is one that cannot be broken down into a small number of smaller parts.

The situation is slightly more complicated in contexts where the axiom of choice might fail, as in that case not all cardinals are necessarily the cardinalities of well-ordered sets. In that case, the above equivalence holds for well-orderable cardinals only.

An infinite ordinal formula_22 is a regular ordinal if it is a limit ordinal that is not the limit of a set of smaller ordinals that as a set has order type less than formula_22. A regular ordinal is always an initial ordinal, though some initial ordinals are not regular, e.g., formula_24 (see the example below).

== Examples ==

The ordinals less than formula_25 are finite. A finite sequence of finite ordinals always has a finite maximum, so formula_25 cannot be the limit of any sequence of type less than formula_25 whose elements are ordinals less than formula_25, and is therefore a regular ordinal. formula_29 (aleph-null) is a regular cardinal because its initial ordinal, formula_25, is regular. It can also be seen directly to be regular, as the cardinal sum of a finite number of finite cardinal numbers is itself finite.

formula_31 is the next ordinal number greater than formula_25. It is singular, since it is not a limit ordinal. formula_33 is the next limit ordinal after formula_25. It can be written as the limit of the sequence formula_25, formula_31, formula_37, formula_38, and so on. This sequence has order type formula_25, so formula_33 is the limit of a sequence of type less than formula_33 whose elements are ordinals less than formula_33; therefore it is singular.

formula_43 is the next cardinal number greater than formula_29, so the cardinals less than formula_43 are countable (finite or denumerable). Assuming the axiom of choice, the union of a countable set of countable sets is itself countable. So formula_43 cannot be written as the sum of a countable set of countable cardinal numbers, and is regular.

formula_47 is the next cardinal number after the sequence formula_29, formula_43, formula_50, formula_51, and so on. Its initial ordinal formula_24 is the limit of the sequence formula_25, formula_54, formula_55, formula_56, and so on, which has order type formula_25, so formula_24 is singular, and so is formula_47. Assuming the axiom of choice, formula_47 is the first infinite cardinal that is singular (the first infinite &quot;ordinal&quot; that is singular is formula_31, and the first infinite &quot;limit ordinal&quot; that is singular is formula_33). Proving the existence of singular cardinals requires the axiom of replacement, and in fact the inability to prove the existence of formula_47 in Zermelo set theory is what led Fraenkel to postulate this axiom.

Uncountable (weak) limit cardinals that are also regular are known as (weakly) inaccessible cardinals. They cannot be proved to exist within ZFC, though their existence is not known to be inconsistent with ZFC. Their existence is sometimes taken as an additional axiom. Inaccessible cardinals are necessarily fixed points of the aleph function, though not all fixed points are regular. For instance, the first fixed point is the limit of the formula_25-sequence formula_65 and is therefore singular.

== Properties ==

If the axiom of choice holds, then every successor cardinal is regular. Thus the regularity or singularity of most aleph numbers can be checked depending on whether the cardinal is a successor cardinal or a limit cardinal. Some cardinalities cannot be proven to be equal to any particular aleph, for instance the cardinality of the continuum, whose value in ZFC may be any uncountable cardinal of uncountable cofinality (see Easton&#x27;s theorem). The continuum hypothesis postulates that the cardinality of the continuum is equal to formula_43, which is regular assuming choice.

Without the axiom of choice: there would be cardinal numbers that were not well-orderable. Moreover, the cardinal sum of an arbitrary collection could not be defined. Therefore, only the aleph numbers could meaningfully be called regular or singular cardinals.Furthermore, a successor aleph would need not be regular. For instance, the union of a countable set of countable sets would not necessarily be countable. It is consistent with ZF that formula_54 be the limit of a countable sequence of countable ordinals as well as the set of real numbers be a countable union of countable sets. Furthermore, it is consistent with ZF when not including AC that every aleph bigger than formula_29 is singular (a result proved by Moti Gitik).

If formula_1 is a limit ordinal, formula_1 is regular iff the set of formula_71 that are critical points of formula_72-elementary embeddings formula_73 with formula_74 is club in formula_1.

For cardinals formula_76, say that an elementary embedding formula_77 a &quot;small embedding&quot; if formula_78 is transitive and formula_79. A cardinal formula_1 is uncountable and regular iff there is an formula_81 such that for every formula_82, there is a small embedding formula_77.Corollary 2.2

<text>The fall-front desk is a desk with a main working surface that folds up to cover small shelves or drawers stacked in front of the user. As with its cousin the secretary desk, all working papers, documents and other items have to be stored before the desk is closed.

Unlike the secretary desk, the fall-front desk&#x27;s desktop panel is perfectly vertical when in its closed position. Often, there are no additional shelves or drawers above the section that is enclosed by the desktop. Thus, the fall-front desk is identical in shape to a Bargueño desk, which would have been placed on a stand of drawers, or more precisely to the form known as desk on a chest or as &quot;chest-on chest&quot;.

The fall-front desk is also called a drop-front desk, and sometimes also a drop-lid desk. Scrutoire and scriptoire are ancient variations. The &quot;secrétaire à abattant&quot; is a nearly identical form, but usually in a French style such as Louis XV, Art Deco, etc. In the early 19th century, Shaker communities produced a tall and plain variation that is often known as a &quot;cupboard desk&quot;.

<doc id="374136" wikidata="Q608507" url="?curid=374136" title="Check Your Head">
<text>Check Your Head is the third studio album by the American hip hop group Beastie Boys, released on April 21, 1992, by Grand Royal and Capitol Records. Three years elapsed between the releases of the band&#x27;s previous studio album &quot;Paul&#x27;s Boutique&quot; (1989) and &quot;Check Your Head&quot;, which was recorded at the G-Son Studios in Atwater Village in 1991 under the guidance of producer Mario Caldato Jr., the group&#x27;s third producer in as many albums. Less sample-heavy than their previous records, the album features instrumental contributions from all three members: Adam Horovitz on guitar, Adam Yauch on bass guitar, and Mike Diamond on drums.

The album was re-released in a number of formats in 2009, with 16 B-sides and rarities, as well as a commentary track, included as bonus material. It is one of the albums profiled in the 2007 book &quot;Check the Technique&quot;, which includes a track-by-track breakdown by Diamond, Yauch, Horovitz, Caldato, and frequent Beasties collaborator Money Mark.

== Background ==
&quot;Check Your Head&quot; was the first Beastie Boys album to be fully co-produced by Mario Caldato Jr., who had been an engineer on &quot;Paul&#x27;s Boutique&quot; and was credited as producer on that album&#x27;s track &quot;Ask for Janice&quot;. It also marked the first appearance on one of their albums of keyboardist Money Mark, who became a regular collaborator of the band.

The album was somewhat of a return by the Beastie Boys to their punk roots. It featured the trio playing their own instruments on the majority of the album, for the first time on record since their early EPs, due to the commercial failure of &quot;Paul&#x27;s Boutique&quot;. This inspired photographer Glen E. Friedman to shoot photos of the Beasties with their instrument cases, one of which was used as the cover of the album. Supposedly, a trading card for Norman Schwarzkopf Jr. from a set of Desert Storm trading cards was the inspiration for the album&#x27;s title.

The Beastie Boys toured with the Rollins Band and Cypress Hill in early 1992 to support &quot;Check Your Head&quot;.

== Critical reception ==
In &quot;The New York Times&quot;, James Bernard wrote that the &quot;frenzied hybrid&quot; of musical styles on &quot;Check Your Head&quot; &quot;is tough to follow but well worth the effort&quot;, concluding that the album &quot;demonstrates that the Beastie Boys will risk commercial failure to do what they please.&quot; Adam Higginbotham gave it a four-out-of-five rating in &quot;Select&quot; and called it an &quot;excellent&quot; record that he nonetheless felt would sell poorly due to its &quot;hopelessly eccentric&quot; nature. &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; critic Greg Kot awarded it three out of four stars and credited the Beastie Boys for &quot;showing surprising resiliency and versatility&quot;, while Steven Blush of &quot;Spin&quot; praised the album&#x27;s &quot;thick, deep, textured, and varied&quot; songs and emphasis on groove. Writing for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, Kevin Powell deemed it the group&#x27;s &quot;most unconventional outing to date&quot; and found its eclecticism &quot;confusing at times&quot; but distinctive, giving the album three-and-a-half stars out of five. At the end of 1992, &quot;Check Your Head&quot; was named the year&#x27;s fourth-best album by &quot;Spin&quot;, and it placed fifth in &quot;The Village Voice&quot;″s Pazz &amp; Jop critics&#x27; poll.

Stephen Dalton was less impressed in &quot;NME&quot;, rating &quot;Check Your Head&quot; six out of ten and finding that the Beastie Boys had regressed as lyricists, &quot;mimicking the music&#x27;s laid back laziness and trading much of their trademark humour for seemingly improvised shouting matches.&quot; In &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;, David Browne gave it a &quot;D&quot; grade and panned it as &quot;sophomoric&quot; and sounding &quot;as if it were recorded underwater.&quot; Robert Christgau deemed the album a &quot;great concept&quot; executed only &quot;halfway there at best&quot; in a year-end essay for &quot;The Village Voice&quot;, later assigning it a &quot;neither&quot; rating.

In a retrospective review, AllMusic editor Stephen Thomas Erlewine said that on &quot;Check Your Head&quot;, the Beastie Boys &quot;repositioned themselves as a lo-fi, alt-rock groove band&quot; who &quot;had not abandoned rap, but it was no longer the foundation of their music, it was simply the most prominent in a thick pop-culture gumbo&quot;. He cited the album&#x27;s &quot;earth-bound D.I.Y.&quot; approach as &quot;a big reason why it turned out to be an alt-rock touchstone of the &#x27;90s, something that both set trends and predicted them.&quot; &quot;The A.V. Club&quot;″s Nathan Rabin called it &quot;a dorm-room staple and cultural touchstone&quot; that &quot;was just as radical a reinvention&quot; as &quot;Paul&#x27;s Boutique&quot; and marked the group&#x27;s &quot;strangely organic evolution into adventurous sonic astronauts&quot;.

In 1995, &quot;Alternative Press&quot; placed &quot;Check Your Head&quot; at number 23 on its list of the top 99 albums released from 1985 to 1995. Four years later, &quot;Spin&quot; listed &quot;Check Your Head&quot; as the twelfth-best album of the 1990s. In 2022, &quot;Pitchfork&quot; ranked it as the 67th-best album of the 1990s, praising the album&#x27;s funk-inspired instrumentals. It was ranked at number 261 in the 2020 edition of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s &quot;500 Greatest Albums of All Time&quot; list.

<doc id="374143" wikidata="Q1058102" url="?curid=374143" title="International Tchaikovsky Competition">
<text>The International Tchaikovsky Competition is a classical music competition held every four years in Moscow and Saint Petersburg, Russia, for pianists, violinists, and cellists between 16 and 32 years of age and singers between 19 and 32 years of age. The competition is named after Russian composer Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky.

The International Tchaikovsky Competition was the first international music competition held in the Soviet Union, beginning in 1958. For the XIV competition in 2011, Valery Gergiev was appointed the competition&#x27;s chairman, and Richard Rodzinski, former president of the Van Cliburn Foundation, was appointed general director. A new voting system was instituted, created by mathematician John MacBain, and used by the International Violin Competition of Indianapolis, the Van Cliburn International Piano Competition, and the Cleveland International Piano Competition. All rules and regulations also underwent a complete revision. Emphasis was placed on the composition of the jury, which consisted primarily of well-known and respected performing artists.

The XIV International Tchaikovsky Competition was held in Moscow and St. Petersburg, Russia, from 14 June to 1 July 2011, under the auspices of the Russian federal government and its Ministry of Culture. The competition disciplines were piano, violin, cello, and voice (male singers and female singers). The XV competition took place in June 2015. The XVI competition took place 17–29 June 2019, in Moscow and St. Petersburg; woodwind and brass competition disciplines were added. The XVII International Tchaikovsky Competition was held in Moscow in 2023. The XVIII International Tchaikovsky Competition will take place in 2027.

==Prizes==
Cash prizes are awarded to the top-five competitors in each discipline of piano, violin, cello, and to each of the top four competitors in the men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s solo vocal categories. First prize (not always awarded) is US$30,000; second, US$20,000; third, US$10,000; fourth, US$5,000; and fifth, US$3,000. An additional prize, a Grand Prix of US$100,000, may be awarded to one of the gold medalists deemed outstanding by the juries. Additional awards are given for best performance of the chamber concertos and the commissioned new work.

For the 2019 competition, the prizes were as follows:

==History==
Held every four years, the first competition, in 1958, included two disciplines: piano and violin. Beginning with the second competition, in 1962, a cello category was added, and the vocal division was introduced during the third competition in 1966. In 1990, a fifth discipline was announced for the IX International Tchaikovsky Competition: a contest for violin makers, which traditionally comes before the main competition. In 2019, two new categories were added to the competition, woodwinds and brass.

===Tianxu An incident===
On 25 June 2019, at the final round of the piano category, Chinese competitor Tianxu An was supposed to play Tchaikovsky&#x27;s Piano Concerto No. 1 followed by Rachmaninoff&#x27;s &quot;Rhapsody on a Theme of Paganini&quot;. However, the scores on the orchestra&#x27;s and conductor&#x27;s stands were placed in reversed order and the Rachmaninoff piece was announced first, different from what the pianist requested. Since An didn&#x27;t understand Russian, he was unaware of the situation. With the piano entry in the Rachmaninoff almost immediate, the performance &quot;began with a failure&quot;. Following the incident, jury chair Denis Matsuev invited him to perform the program again, but An declined. The competition made an official apology and the orchestra administration suspended the responsible staff after the event. An was eventually awarded a &quot;special prize&quot; for his confidence and courage.

=== World Federation of International Music Competitions ===
In 1971, the International Tchaikovsky Competition joined the World Federation of International Music Competitions (WFIMC), which had been founded in 1957. On 19 April 2022, in line with widespread sanctions in response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the WFIMC decided with an overwhelming majority of member votes to exclude the International Tchaikovsky Competition from its membership with immediate effect.

<text>Hansraj Morarji Public School is a combined primary, junior and senior school in Mumbai, India. It was founded in 1939 by the Bai Kabibai and Hansraj Morarji Trust. The foundation stone was laid by Sardar Patel. The school was earlier an all-boys school but now admits girls.

==Campus==

The school campus of around is located at the foot of Gilbert Hill. The campus has Rajhans Vidyalaya a CBSE affiliated senior secondary school, and Bai Kabibai Balvatika the feeder pre-primary school for Hansraj and Rajhans. The school has a cricket ground, basketball courts, football ground, tennis courts and gymnasium. It has a School Wellness Clinic called AYAKSHA for the school student&#x27;s health and routine checkup. An audio-visual room for screening educational films is also present.
The HMP School is a member of Indian Public School Conference (IPSC).

The school started a Junior college in July 2008. The college provides Science and Commerce based streams along with vocational course for Information Technology.

== Affiliation ==
The school prepares students for Secondary Certificate Examinations (SSCs) held by the Mumbai Divisional Board of the Maharashtra State Board of Secondary and Higher Secondary Education. In addition to curriculum subjects, there are also clubs covering Maths, Drama. There is also The Green Brigade Club, which is the school&#x27;s Environment Club and which won the &quot;Green School Award&quot; in 1996.

The lady founder of the school was anxious that traditional Indian values should be instilled in the students. She was also wary of the English language, viewing it as being the vehicle of westernization and loss of cultural values. Therefore, in the articles of association of the school, she made it compulsory to offer Gujarati as a medium of instruction. One section of every class, from first to tenth standards, was for the Gujarati medium and students were taught all subjects in that language. From the time of its founding until the early 2000s, this system prevailed. However, due to lack of demand (presumably), the Gujarati medium-of-instruction classes have now been discontinued and the school has become a completely English Medium School.

<text>A piano roll is a music storage medium used to operate a player piano, piano player or reproducing piano. Piano rolls, like other music rolls, are continuous rolls of paper with holes punched into them. These perforations represent note control data. The roll moves over a reading system known as a tracker bar; the playing cycle for each musical note is triggered when a perforation crosses the bar.

Piano rolls have been in continuous production since at least 1896, and are still being manufactured today; QRS Music offers 45,000 titles with &quot;new titles being added on a regular basis&quot;, although they are no longer mass-produced. MIDI files have generally supplanted piano rolls in storing and playing back performance data, accomplishing digitally and electronically what piano rolls do mechanically. MIDI editing software often features the ability to represent the music graphically as a piano roll.

The first paper rolls were used commercially by Welte &amp; Sons in their orchestrions beginning in 1883.

A &quot;rollography&quot; is a listing of piano rolls, especially made by a single performer, analogous to a discography.

The Musical Museum in Brentford, London, England houses one of the world&#x27;s largest collections of piano rolls, with over 20,000 rolls as well as an extensive collection of instruments which may be seen and heard.

==Buffalo Convention==

In the early years of player pianos, piano rolls were produced in varying dimensions and formats. Most rolls used one of three musical scales. The 65-note format, with a playing range of A1 to C♯7, was introduced in 1896 in the United States, specifically for piano music. In 1900, an American format playing all 88 notes of the standard piano scale (A0 to C8) was introduced. In 1902, a German 72-note scale (F1, G1 to E7) was introduced.

On December 10, 1908, a group representing most of the largest U.S. manufacturers of player pianos gathered in Buffalo, New York, to try to agree on some standards. The group settled on a width of and perforation standards for 65-note rolls of 6 holes to the inch, and for 88-note rolls of 9 holes to the inch. That left margins at both ends for future developments. Any pianos built to those standards could play rolls made to them, albeit sometimes with a loss of special functionality. The formats became a loose world standard.

==Metronomic, hand played, and reproducing rolls==

&quot;Metronomic&quot; or &quot;arranged&quot; rolls are rolls produced by positioning the music slots without real-time input from a performing musician. The music, when played back, is typically purely metronomical. Metronomically arranged music rolls are deliberately left metronomic so as to enable a player-pianist to create their own musical performance (such as varying the dynamics, tempo, and phrasing) via the hand controls that are a feature of all player pianos.

&quot;Hand played&quot; rolls are created by capturing in real time the hand-played performance of one or more pianists upon a piano connected to a recording machine. The production roll reproduced the real-time performance of the original recording when played back at a constant speed. (It became industry convention for recordings of music intended to be used for dancing to be regularized into strict tempo despite the original performance having the slight tempo fluctuations of all human performances, as due to the recording and production process, any fluctuations would be magnified/exaggerated in the finished production copy and result in an uneven rhythm.)

&quot;Reproducing&quot; rolls are the same as &quot;hand-played&quot; rolls but have additional control codes to operate the dynamic modifying systems specific to whichever brand of reproducing piano it is designed to be played back on, producing an approximation of the original recording pianist&#x27;s dynamics. Reproducing pianos were beyond the reach of the average home in the original era of popularity of these instruments and were heavily marketed as reproducing the &#x27;soul&#x27; of the performer – slogans such as &quot;The Master&#x27;s Fingers On Your Piano&quot; or &quot;Paderewski will play for you in your own house!&quot; were common.

==Compositions for pianola and reproducing piano==
The player piano gives the opportunity to create music that is impossible for humans to play, or, more correctly, music that was not conceived in terms of performance by hand. Over one hundred composers wrote music specially for the player piano during the course of the 20th century. Many mainstream composers experimented with its possibilities, including Igor Stravinsky, Alfredo Casella, and Paul Hindemith; others, including Conlon Nancarrow, made it their primary milieu.

The Duo-Art, Ampico, and Welte-Mignon brands were known as &quot;reproducing&quot; piano rolls, as they could accurately reproduce the touch and dynamics of the artist as well as the notes struck, when played back on capable pianos.

== Reproducing pianos ==

Rolls for the reproducing piano were generally made from the recorded performances of famous musicians. Typically, a pianist would sit at a specially designed recording piano, and the pitch and duration of any notes played would be either marked or perforated on a blank roll, together with the duration of the sustaining and soft pedal. In Australia Edith and Laurel Pardey were employed as &quot;nine to five&quot; pianola pianists. They were not famous when they started in the 1920s but they became well known for their playing.

Reproducing pianos can also re-create the dynamics of a pianist&#x27;s performance by means of specially encoded control perforations placed towards the edges of a music roll. Different companies had different ways of notating dynamics, some technically advanced, some secret, and some dependent entirely on a recording producer&#x27;s handwritten notes, but in all cases these dynamic hieroglyphics had to be skillfully converted into the specialized perforated codes needed by the different types of instrument.

Recorded rolls play at a specific, marked speed, where for example, 70 signifies of paper travel in one minute, at the start of the roll. On all pneumatic player pianos, the paper is pulled on to a take-up spool, and as more paper winds on, so the effective diameter of the spool increases, and with it the paper speed. Player piano engineers were well aware of this, as can be seen from many patents of the time, but since reproducing piano recordings were generally made with a similar take-up spool drive, the tempo of the recorded performance is faithfully reproduced, despite the gradually increasing paper speed.

The playing of many pianists and composers is preserved on reproducing piano roll. Gustav Mahler, Camille Saint-Saëns, Edvard Grieg, Teresa Carreño, Claude Debussy, Manuel de Falla, Scott Joplin, Sergei Rachmaninoff, Sergei Prokofiev, Alexander Scriabin, Jelly Roll Morton and George Gershwin are amongst the composers and pianists who have had their performances recorded in this way.

Duo-Art featured artists such as Ignace Jan Paderewski, George Gershwin, Maurice Ravel, Teresa Carreño, Percy Grainger, Leopold Godowsky and Ferruccio Busoni. The Ampico brand&#x27;s featured artists included Sergei Rachmaninoff, Ferde Grofé, Leo Ornstein, Mischa Levitzki, Winifred MacBride, and Marguerite Volavy. Welte-Mignon, the earliest reproducing system, recorded artists such as Gustav Mahler, Camille Saint-Saëns, Claude Debussy, Manuel de Falla, Alexander Scriabin, Enrique Granados, Eugen d&#x27;Albert, Josef Lhévinne, Raoul Pugno, and Carl Reinecke (who was the earliest-born pianist to record in any media format).

There were hundreds of companies worldwide producing rolls during the peak period of their popularity (1900–1927). Some other non-reproducing rolls makers of live performances are listed below together with their most memorable recording artistes.

*Aeolian: Pauline Alpert, Edythe Baker, Felix Arndt, Jules de Sivrai, Constance Mering, Frank Milne, Rube Bloom, Eubie Blake, Les Copeland
*QRS: James P Johnson, Fats Waller, Zez Confrey, Blind Boone, Lem Fowler, J. Lawrence Cook, Pete Wendling, Phil Ohman, Victor Arden, J. Russel Robinson
*Connorized: Scott Joplin
*Republic: Adrian Rollini

*Imperial: Charley Straight, Roy Bargy
*Vocalstyle: Jelly Roll Morton, Walter Davison, Clarence Jones, Luckey Roberts, Cow Cow Davenport, Amanda Randolph
*Capitol/Columbia: Jimmy Blythe, Clarence Johnson, Pearl White, Eddie Hanson

==Legal protectability against copying==

&quot;White-Smith Music Publishing Company v. Apollo Company&quot;, 209 U.S. 1 (1908), was a decision by the Supreme Court of the United States which ruled that manufacturers of music rolls for player pianos did not have to pay royalties to the composers. The ruling was based on a holding that the piano rolls were not copies of the plaintiffs&#x27; copyrighted sheet music, but were instead parts of the machine that reproduced the music.

This case was subsequently eclipsed by Congress&#x27;s intervention in the form of an amendment to the Copyright Act of 1909, protecting them and introducing a compulsory license for the manufacture and distribution of such &quot;mechanical&quot; embodiments of musical works.

== In digital audio workstations ==

In most modern digital audio workstation software, the term &quot;piano roll&quot; is used to refer to a graphical display of, and means of editing, MIDI note data. Piano rolls allow the user to enter the pitch, length and velocity of notes manually, instead of recording the output of a keyboard or other device for entering note data. Usually a means of manually editing other aspects of the MIDI data, such as pitch bend or modulation, is also present, although not strictly part of the piano roll itself.

From the mid 1980s, music software started to include grid-based graphical editors inspired by piano rolls, with the two axes representing pitch and time, and the notes displayed as bars on the grid. MacroMind&#x27;s &quot;MusicWorks&quot; (1984) utilized the Macintosh&#x27;s high resolution WIMP graphical user interface to implement a piano roll-style editor with a keyboard aligned vertically on the left of a grid. Other early examples of piano roll-inspired editors include Southworth&#x27;s &quot;Total Music&quot; (1986), &quot;Iconix&quot; (1987) by System Exclusive, which used a vertical scrolling piano roll with the keyboard aligned horizontally at the top of the editing window, and &quot;Master Tracks Pro&quot; (1987) by Passport Designs.

With the release of Cubase and its Key Edit window in 1989, the piano roll format introduced by &quot;MusicWorks&quot; was established as a standard MIDI editing feature in modern digital audio workstations.

<text>Herman Wouk ( ; May 27, 1915 – May 17, 2019) was an American author. He published fifteen novels, many of them historical fiction such as &quot;The Caine Mutiny&quot; (1951), for which he won the Pulitzer Prize in fiction.

Other well-known works included &quot;The Winds of War&quot; and &quot;War and Remembrance&quot; (historical novels about World War II), the bildungsroman &quot;Marjorie Morningstar&quot;; and non-fiction such as &quot;This Is My God&quot;, an explanation of Judaism from a Modern Orthodox perspective, written for Jewish and non-Jewish readers. His books have been translated into 27 languages.

&quot;The Washington Post&quot; described Wouk, who cherished his privacy, as &quot;the reclusive dean of American historical novelists&quot;. Historians, novelists, publishers, and critics who gathered at the Library of Congress in 1995 to mark his 80th birthday described him as an American Tolstoy. Wouk lived to 103.

==Early life==
Wouk was born in the Bronx, New York, the second of three children born to Esther (née Levine) and Abraham Isaac Wouk, Russian Jewish immigrants from what is today Belarus. His father toiled for many years to raise the family out of poverty before opening a successful laundry service.

When Wouk was 13, his maternal grandfather, Mendel Leib Levine, came from Minsk to live with them and took charge of his grandson&#x27;s Jewish education. Wouk was frustrated by the amount of time he was expected to spend studying the Talmud, but his father told him, &quot;if I were on my deathbed, and I had breath to say one more thing to you, I would say &#x27;Study the Talmud.&#x27;&quot; Eventually Wouk took this advice to heart. After a brief period as a young adult during which he lived a secular life, he returned to religious practice and Judaism became integral to both his personal life and his career. He said later that his grandfather and the United States Navy were the two most important influences on his life.

After his childhood and adolescence in the Bronx, Wouk graduated from the original Townsend Harris High School in Manhattan, Townsend Harris Hall Prep School, the elite public prep school for City College. In 1934 he earned a Bachelor of Arts degree at the age of 19 from Columbia University, where he was a member of the Pi Lambda Phi fraternity. He also served as editor of the university&#x27;s humor magazine, &quot;Jester&quot;, and wrote two of its annual Varsity Shows. He became a radio dramatist, working in David Freedman&#x27;s &quot;Joke Factory&quot; and later with Fred Allen for five years and then, in 1941, for the United States government, writing radio spots to sell war bonds.

==Career==
===Military career===
Following the attack on Pearl Harbor, Wouk joined the U.S. Naval Reserve in 1942 and served in the Pacific Theater during World War II, an experience he later characterized as educational: &quot;I learned about machinery, I learned how men behaved under pressure, and I learned about Americans.&quot; Wouk served as an officer aboard two destroyer minesweepers (DMS), the and , becoming executive officer of the &quot;Southard&quot; while holding the rank of lieutenant. He participated in around six invasions and won a number of battle stars. Wouk was in the New Georgia Campaign, the Gilbert and Marshall Islands campaign, the Mariana and Palau Islands campaign, and the Battle of Okinawa. In off-duty hours aboard ship he started writing a novel, &quot;Aurora Dawn&quot;, which he originally titled &quot;Aurora Dawn; or, The True history of Andrew Reale, containing a faithful account of the Great Riot, together with the complete texts of Michael Wilde&#x27;s oration and Father Stanfield&#x27;s sermon.&quot; Wouk sent a copy of the opening chapters to philosophy professor Irwin Edman, under whom he studied at Columbia, who quoted a few pages verbatim to a New York editor. The result was a publisher&#x27;s contract sent to Wouk&#x27;s ship, then off the coast of Okinawa. &quot;Aurora Dawn&quot; was published in 1947 and became a Book of the Month Club main selection. Wouk finished his tour of duty in 1946.

===Writing career===
His second novel, &quot;City Boy&quot;, proved to be a commercial disappointment when it was published in 1948. Wouk claimed it was largely ignored amid the excitement over Norman Mailer&#x27;s bestselling World War II novel &quot;The Naked and the Dead&quot;.

While writing his next novel, Wouk read each chapter to his wife as it was completed and she remarked that if they did not like this one, he had better take up another line of work (a line he would give to the character of the editor Jeannie Fry in his novel &quot;Youngblood Hawke&quot;, 1962). The novel, &quot;The Caine Mutiny&quot; (1951), won the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction. A best-seller, drawn from his wartime experiences aboard minesweepers during World War II, &quot;The Caine Mutiny&quot; was adapted by the author into a Broadway play called &quot;The Caine Mutiny Court-Martial.&quot; In 1954 Columbia Pictures released a film version of the book, with Humphrey Bogart portraying Lt. Commander Philip Francis Queeg, captain of the fictional USS &quot;Caine&quot;.

Wouk&#x27;s next novel after &quot;The Caine Mutiny&quot; was &quot;Marjorie Morningstar&quot; (1955), which earned him a &quot;Time&quot; magazine cover story. Three years later Warner Bros. made it into a movie of the same name starring Natalie Wood, Gene Kelly and Claire Trevor. His next novel, a paperback, was &quot;Slattery&#x27;s Hurricane&quot; (1956), which he had written in 1948 as the basis for the screenplay for the film of the same name. Wouk&#x27;s first work of non-fiction was 1959&#x27;s &quot;This is My God: The Jewish Way of Life&quot;.

In the 1960s, he wrote &quot;Youngblood Hawke&quot; (1962), a drama about the rise and fall of a young writer, modeled on the life of Thomas Wolfe; and &quot;Don&#x27;t Stop the Carnival&quot; (1965), a comedy about escaping mid-life crisis by moving to the Caribbean, which was loosely based on Wouk&#x27;s own experiences. &quot;Youngblood Hawke&quot; was serialized in &quot;McCall&#x27;s&quot; magazine from March to July 1962. A movie version starred James Franciscus and Suzanne Pleshette and was released by Warner Brothers in 1964. In 1997 &quot;Don&#x27;t Stop the Carnival&quot; was turned into a short-lived musical by Jimmy Buffett.

In the 1970s, Wouk published two monumental novels, &quot;The Winds of War&quot; (1971) and a sequel, &quot;War and Remembrance&quot; (1978). He described &quot;Remembrance&quot;, which included a devastating depiction of the Holocaust, as &quot;the main tale I have to tell.&quot; Both were made into successful television mini-series, the first in 1983 and the second in 1988. Although they were made several years apart, both were directed by Dan Curtis and both starred Robert Mitchum as Captain Victor &quot;Pug&quot; Henry, the main character. The novels were historical fiction. Each had three layers: the story told from the viewpoints of Captain Henry and his circle of family and friends; a more or less straightforward historical account of the events of the war; and an analysis by a member of Adolf Hitler&#x27;s military staff, the insightful fictional General Armin von Roon. Wouk devoted &quot;thirteen years of extraordinary research and long, arduous composition&quot; to these two novels, noted Arnold Beichman. &quot;The seriousness with which Wouk has dealt with the war can be seen in the prodigious amount of research, reading, travel and conferring with experts, the evidence of which may be found in the uncatalogued boxes at Columbia University&quot; that contain the author&#x27;s papers.
&quot;Inside, Outside&quot; (1985) was the story of four generations of a Russian Jewish family and its travails in Russia, the U.S. and Israel. &quot;The Hope&quot; (1993) and its sequel, &quot;The Glory&quot; (1994), were historical novels about the first 33 years of Israel&#x27;s history. They were followed by &quot;The Will to Live On: This is Our Heritage&quot; (2000), a whirlwind tour of Jewish history and sacred texts and companion volume to &quot;This is My God&quot;.

In 1995, Wouk was honored on his 80th birthday by the Library of Congress with a symposium on his career. In attendance were David McCullough, Robert Caro, and Daniel Boorstin, among others.

&quot;A Hole in Texas&quot; (2004) was a novel about the discovery of the Higgs boson, whose existence was proven nine years later. &quot;The Language God Talks: On Science and Religion&quot; (2010) was an exploration of the tension between religion and science which originated in a discussion Wouk had with theoretical physicist Richard Feynman.

&quot;The Lawgiver&quot; (2012) was an epistolary novel about a contemporary Hollywood writer of a movie script about Moses, with the consulting help of a nonfictional character, Herman Wouk, a &quot;mulish ancient&quot; who became involved despite the strong misgivings of his wife.

Wouk&#x27;s memoir, titled &quot;Sailor and Fiddler: Reflections of a 100-Year-Old Author&quot;, was published in January 2016 to mark his 100th birthday. NPR called it &quot;a lovely coda to the career of a man who made American literature a kinder, smarter, better place.&quot; It was his last book.

==Daily journal==
Wouk kept a personal diary from 1937. On September 10, 2008, he presented his journals, numbering more than 100 volumes , to the Library of Congress at a ceremony in which he was honored with the first Library of Congress Lifetime Achievement Award for the Writing of Fiction (now the Library of Congress Prize for American Fiction). Wouk often referred to his journals to check dates and facts in his writing, and he hesitated to let the originals out of his possession. A solution was negotiated and the entire set of volumes was scanned into digital format.

==Personal life and death==
In 1944 Wouk met Betty Sarah Brown, a Phi Beta Kappa graduate of the University of Southern California, who was working as a personnel specialist in the navy while the &quot;Zane&quot; was undergoing repairs in San Pedro, California. The two fell in love and after Wouk&#x27;s ship went back to sea, Betty, who was born a Protestant and was raised in Grangeville, Idaho, began her study of Judaism and converted on her twenty-fifth birthday. They were married on December 10, 1945.

After the birth of the first of their three children the following year, Wouk became a full-time writer to support his growing family. His first-born son, Abraham Isaac Wouk, who was named after Wouk&#x27;s late father, drowned in a swimming pool accident in Cuernavaca, Mexico, shortly before his fifth birthday. Wouk later dedicated &quot;War and Remembrance&quot; to him with the Biblical words &quot;בלע המות לנצח – He will destroy death forever&quot; (Isaiah 25:8). Their second and third children were Iolanthe Woulff (born 1950 as Nathaniel Wouk, a Princeton University graduate and an author) and Joseph (born 1954, a Columbia graduate, an attorney, a film producer, and a writer who served in the Israeli Navy). He had three grandchildren.

The Wouks lived in New York, Saint Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands, where he wrote &quot;Don&#x27;t Stop the Carnival,&quot; and at 3255 N Street N.W. in the Georgetown section of Washington, D.C., where he researched and wrote &quot;The Winds of War&quot; and &quot;War and Remembrance,&quot; before settling in Palm Springs, California. His wife, who served for decades as his literary agent, died in Palm Springs on March 17, 2011.

&quot;I wrote nothing that was of the slightest consequence before I met Sarah,&quot; Wouk recalled after her death. &quot;I was a gag man for Fred Allen for five years. In his time, he was the greatest of the radio comedians. And jokes work for what they are but they&#x27;re ephemeral. They just disappear. And that was the kind of thing I did up until the time that I met Sarah and we married. And I would say my literary career and my mature life both began with her.&quot;

Wouk&#x27;s brother Victor died in 2005. His nephew, Alan I. Green, was a psychiatrist at Dartmouth College.

Wouk died in his sleep in his home in Palm Springs, California, on May 17, 2019, at the age of 103, ten days before his 104th birthday.

<doc id="374163" wikidata="Q862193" url="?curid=374163" title="Crevasse">
<text>A crevasse is a deep crack that forms in a glacier or ice sheet. Crevasses form as a result of the movement and resulting stress associated with the shear stress generated when two semi-rigid pieces above a plastic substrate have different rates of movement. The resulting intensity of the shear stress causes a breakage along the faces.

==Description==

Crevasses often have vertical or near-vertical walls, which can then melt and create seracs, arches, and other ice formations. These walls sometimes expose layers that represent the glacier&#x27;s stratigraphy. Crevasse size often depends upon the amount of liquid water present in the glacier. A crevasse may be as deep as and as wide as 

The presence of water in a crevasse can significantly increase its penetration. Water-filled crevasses may reach the bottom of glaciers or ice sheets and provide a direct hydrologic connection between the surface, where significant summer melting occurs, and the bed of the glacier, where additional water may moisten and lubricate the bed and accelerate ice flow. Direct drains of water from the top of a glacier, known as moulins, can also contribute the lubrication and acceleration of ice flow.

==Types==

*Longitudinal crevasses form parallel to flow where the glacier width is expanding. They develop in areas of tensile stress, such as where a valley widens or bends. They are typically concave down and form an angle greater than 45° with the margin.
*Splaying crevasses appear along the edges of a glacier and result from shear stress from the margin of the glacier and longitudinal compressing stress from lateral extension. They extend from the glacier&#x27;s margin and are concave up with respect to glacier flow, making an angle less than 45° with the margin. 
*Transverse crevasses are the most common crevasse type. They form in a zone of longitudinal extension where the principal stresses are parallel to the direction of glacier flow, creating extensional tensile stress. These crevasses stretch across the glacier transverse to the flow direction, or cross-glacier. They generally form where a valley becomes steeper.

==Dangers==

Falling into glacial crevasses can be dangerous and life-threatening. Some glacial crevasses (such as on the Khumbu Icefall at Mount Everest) can be deep, which can cause fatal injuries upon falling. Hypothermia is often a cause of death when falling into a crevasse.

A crevasse may be covered, but not necessarily filled, by a snow bridge made of the previous years&#x27; accumulation and snow drifts. The result is that crevasses are rendered invisible, and thus potentially lethal to anyone attempting to navigate across a glacier. Occasionally a snow bridge over an old crevasse may begin to sag, providing some landscape relief, but this cannot be relied upon.

The danger of falling into a crevasse can be minimized by roping together multiple climbers into a rope team, and the use of friction knots.

<doc id="374164" wikidata="Q5333548" url="?curid=374164" title="Economic stratification">
<text>Economic stratification refers to the condition within a society where social classes are separated, or stratified, along economic lines. Various economic strata or levels are clearly manifest. While in any system individual members will have varying degrees of wealth, economic stratification typically refers to the condition where there are meaningful gaps between the wealth controlled by various groups, and few instances in the transitional regions.

Economic stratification should not be confused with the related concept, [[economic inequality]]. This deals with the range of wealth, rather than the existence of distinct strata. Economic inequality and economic stratification can coincide, of course.

==Causation==

===Causal conditions===
The causal conditions for stratification include:
* Unequal distribution of resources (assets and income)
* Asymmetrical personal ability (Education, Genetic Factors)
* Cultural priorities
* State institutions and activities

The effects that stratification produces in society as a whole can be significant. They include:
* Inefficient economic cycling
* Increasing corruption of judicial and legislative processes
* Dysfunctional handling of social and political changes

In extreme cases, the social fabric can break down and result in open class warfare such as what happened during the French Revolution, the Russian Revolution, and many others.

===Causative factors===
Many of these effects also act as causative factors. This induces progressively greater stratification unless action is taken to limit a runaway condition. Corruption of the feedback mechanism is the most dangerous threat to any balanced system, since it can lead to economic oscillations of increasing magnitude until runaway inflation or depression results. A historical example of runaway stratification is the Great Depression of the late 1920s and 1930s. As monopolies gained increasing power and influence, the working class gradually lost purchasing power until other factors, such as the bank failures, coincided to produce an economic collapse. Such collapses can occur because the circulation of capital (M1) in such systems becomes highly dependent upon continually increasing apparent quantities of M2. A percentage of M2 is continually being converted into M1 until a point is reached in which the rate of conversion of M2 into M1 cannot be sustained by the available quantity of M1. In the case of the Great Depression, M2 refers to stocks and bank notes. When it became apparent that the valuation of M2 exceeded the supply of M1, a panic ensued to convert M2 to M1, resulting in the rapid apparent devaluation of M2, and the Wall Street Crash of 1929. In the case where M1 is increased to support the increasing conversion of M2 into M1, inflation increases until the physical supply of M1 becomes unwieldy and the result is also economic collapse, as was the case in Germany during the same period.

It is apparent that under these conditions, neither increasing the supply of M1 nor decreasing it (relative to M2) can effectively prevent an economic collapse. Therefore, it can be postulated that economic stratification itself ultimately results in economic collapse of one degree or another. An effective legislative process can prolong the period between collapses, but since one of the effects of stratification is the degradation of this process, it becomes a self accelerating process.

<doc id="374165" wikidata="Q3308043" url="?curid=374165" title="Michael Bliss">
<text>John William Michael Bliss (1941–2017) was a Canadian historian and author. Though his early works focused on business and political history, he also wrote biographies of physicians Frederick Banting, William Osler and Harvey Cushing. Bliss was a frequent commentator on political events and issues. He was an Officer of the Order of Canada.

==Early life==
Michael Bliss was born on January 18, 1941, in Leamington, Ontario, Bliss was raised in nearby Kingsville, Ontario. His father, Quartus Bliss, was a Kingsville-based physician who encouraged Michael to enter the medical field. In an autobiographical essay, Bliss explained that his aspirations were shattered when watching his father suture a drunk&#x27;s face:

==Academic pursuits==
Bliss entered the University of Toronto in 1958, and received his Bachelor of Arts, Master of Arts, and Doctor of Philosophy degrees there. He was appointed to the faculty in 1968 and by the time of his retirement in 2006 had attained the elite rank of University Professor.

His doctoral dissertation, which was supervised by Ramsay Cook, was a social history of Canadian business, an analysis of the &quot;thoughts and dreams&quot; of businessmen in Canada during the National Policy years. It was published under the title &quot;A Living Profit&quot;. In 1978 he published a major biography of Sir Joseph Flavelle, &quot;A Canadian Millionaire&quot;, and in 1987 the first history of business in Canada, &quot;Northern Enterprise&quot;.

In 1982, he began a mid-career transition to medical history with his book &quot;The Discovery of Insulin&quot;. This 1982 book was the basis for the award-winning &quot;Glory Enough for All&quot;, a 1988 Canadian television movie. He has published biographies of two Canadians, the discoverer of insulin Sir Frederick Banting and the famous physician Sir William Osler. In 2005, he published a biography of the American neurosurgeon Harvey Cushing, himself also a biographer of Osler.

Like J. L. Granatstein, his criticism of excessively specialized social history has made him a controversial figure in Canadian historiography.

Bliss has been a frequent commentator on Canadian politics for newspapers, magazines, and television, and has lectured widely in North America and Europe.

In a 2005 profile for the &quot;National Post&quot;, former student John Turley-Ewart writes: &quot;In the 1990s, when I worked as his teaching assistant, it was not unusual to see 300 people from all walks of life – full-time students, business people, civil servants, journalists – packed into his evening lectures.&quot; He was nominated by Turley-Ewart as Canada&#x27;s &quot;leading public intellectual&quot;, part of a series that ran in &quot;National Post&quot;.

==Awards and distinctions==
In 1998, he was made a Member of the Order of Canada and was promoted to Officer in 2013. His books have won various prizes, including the Welch Medal of the American Association for the History of Medicine, the Tyrrell Medal of the Royal Society of Canada, three Jason Hannah Medals of the Royal Society of Canada, the Garneau, Macdonald, and Ferguson prizes of the Canadian Historical Association, and the National Business Book Award. His book on Osler was shorted for the Governor General&#x27;s Award. He was an honorary member of the Harvey Club of London, the oldest medical club in Canada, for his historical biographical contributions on Banting, another honorary member of the Harvey Club. He is an honorary fellow of the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada and holds honorary degrees from the University of Prince Edward Island, McMaster University, McGill, the University of British Columbia, and the University of Toronto. In 2008 his students published a festschrift, &quot;Essays in Honour of Michael Bliss: Figuring the Social&quot;. In 2016 he became the first historian inducted into the Canadian Medical Hall of Fame.

In 2011, he received the Lifetime Achievement Award from the American Osler Society in 2010

==Political commentary==
Bliss frequently commented on current events, contributing essays to various magazine and newspapers, including &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot;. He opposed the Meech Lake Accord and the Charlottetown Accord and the 1999 NATO bombing of Kosovo and he advocated for the abolition of the Canadian monarchy. He also strongly criticized Stephen Harper&#x27;s 2006 move to recognize the Québécois as a nation.

==Death==
Michael Bliss died on May 18, 2017, in Toronto, Ontario, at the age of 76.

<text>Henry II of Champagne (or Henry I of Jerusalem) (29 July 1166 – 10 September 1197) was the count of Champagne from 1181 to 1197, and the king of Jerusalem from 1192 to 1197 by right of his marriage to Queen Isabella I of Jerusalem.

== Early life==
Henry was the elder son of Count Henry I of Champagne and Marie, daughter of King Louis VII of France and Duchess Eleanor of Aquitaine. His aunt Adela of Champagne was Louis VII&#x27;s third wife. In 1171, Henry was betrothed to Isabella of Hainault. When she married Philip II of France instead, his father, aunt and other members of his family were angered. It made Queen Adela&#x27;s faction hostile to Isabella&#x27;s family and so caused tension at the French court. Henry&#x27;s father died in 1181, and his mother ruled, as regent, until 1187.

== Crusade ==

In 1190 Henry left for the East, after having his barons swear to recognize his younger brother Theobald as his successor should he fail to return. He joined the Third Crusade, arriving ahead of his uncles, Kings Philip II of France and Richard I of England. Initially, he was one of the leaders of the French contingent at the siege of Acre before Philip&#x27;s arrival. He is said to have been a member of the group involved in the abduction of Queen Isabella I of Jerusalem, to get her to consent to a divorce from Humphrey IV of Toron so that she could be married to Conrad of Montferrat. Henry was related to Conrad through both his maternal grandparents. According to Baha ad-Din ibn Shaddad, he was wounded at Acre on 15 November.

Later on in the campaign, Henry shifted his allegiance to Richard who, in April 1192, sent Henry as his representative from Acre to Tyre, to inform Conrad of Montferrat of his election as king of Jerusalem. Henry then returned to Acre. A few days later, Conrad was murdered by two Assassins. Henry came back to Tyre two days later, ostensibly to help organise Conrad&#x27;s coronation, but found that a funeral was being prepared instead. He was immediately betrothed to the newly widowed—and pregnant—queen of Jerusalem. They were married just eight days after Conrad&#x27;s death.

The marriage was glossed romantically by some of the chroniclers: Isabella was so taken with Henry&#x27;s physical attractions (he was 20 years younger than Conrad) that she asked him to marry her. Since she was already known to be pregnant with Conrad&#x27;s child, Maria of Montferrat, the marriage was considered scandalous by some, but it was politically vital for her to acquire another husband to defend the kingdom. However, some consultation with the High Court might have been expected. The couple went on to have two daughters, Alice and Philippa.

Henry asked for permission from his uncle Richard, who gave it promptly: however, since Richard was suspected of Conrad&#x27;s murder, this raises further questions about the whole episode. Indeed, Henry, who was known to the Arabs as &quot;al-kond Herri&quot;, later sought an alliance with the Hashshashin, and was invited to visit their fortress stronghold, al-Kahf. To demonstrate his authority, the grand master of the Hashshashin beckoned to two adherents, who immediately flung themselves from the ramparts to their deaths. The Hashshashin then offered to commit a murder for Henry, as an honour to their guest. Henry demurred, concluded the treaty, and departed. Patrick A. Williams has suggested Henry himself as a suspect in Conrad&#x27;s murder, although it would have been a risky undertaking without his uncle&#x27;s support.

Henry died in 1197, falling from a window, one floor off the ground, at his palace in Acre. There are varying accounts in different manuscripts of the &quot;Old French Continuation of William of Tyre&quot;, also known as &quot;The Chronicle of Ernoul&quot;. The majority suggest that a window lattice or balcony gave way as he leaned against it. A servant, possibly a dwarf named Scarlet, also fell, after trying to save him by catching hold of his hanging sleeve - he weighed too little to pull the king (who was tall and strongly built) back. Another version suggests that Henry had been watching a parade from the window when a party of Pisan envoys entered the room. Turning to greet them, he stepped backwards and overbalanced. Whatever the exact circumstances, Henry was killed outright; the servant, who suffered a fractured femur, raised the alarm, but later died of his injury. Some accounts suggest that Henry might have survived if his servant had not landed on top of him.

== Legacy ==

Queen Isabella remarried soon after Henry&#x27;s death. Her fourth (and last) husband was Aimery of Lusignan, king of Cyprus. Henry&#x27;s heir-general was his elder daughter Alice who was soon married to her stepbrother King Hugh I of Cyprus and whose heirs represent the senior line of counts of Champagne.

Henry left behind several difficulties for Champagne. He had borrowed a great deal of money to finance his expedition to Jerusalem, and for his marriage; and the succession to the county of Champagne would later be contested by his daughters, Alice and Philippa. In 1213, supporters of his nephew Theobald IV of Champagne alleged to a papal legate that the annulment of Isabella&#x27;s marriage to Humphrey of Toron (who was still alive during her marriage to Henry) was invalid, and therefore the girls were illegitimate. However, this was questionable: the legitimacy of Isabella&#x27;s daughter by Conrad, Maria, and the right of her descendants to the throne of Jerusalem was never challenged, and if Maria was legitimate, so too were Isabella&#x27;s daughters by Henry. Theobald eventually had to buy off both Alice and Philippa at considerable cost.

<doc id="374178" wikidata="Q256117" url="?curid=374178" title="Eleanor Powell">
<text>Eleanor Torrey Powell (November 21, 1912 – February 11, 1982) was an American dancer and actress. Best remembered for her tap dance numbers in musical films in the 1930s and 1940s, she was one of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer&#x27;s top dancing stars during the Golden Age of Hollywood. Powell appeared in vaudeville, on Broadway, and most prominently, in a series of movie musical vehicles tailored especially to showcase her dance talents, including &quot;Born to Dance&quot; (1936), &quot;Broadway Melody of 1938&quot; (1937), &quot;Rosalie&quot; (1937), and &quot;Broadway Melody of 1940&quot; (1940). She retired from films in the mid-1940s but resurfaced for the occasional specialty dance scene in films such as &quot;Thousands Cheer&quot;. In the 1950s she hosted a Christian children&#x27;s TV show and eventually headlined a successful nightclub act in Las Vegas. She died from cancer at 69. Powell is known as one of the most versatile and athletic female dancers of the Hollywood studio era.

==Early life==
Powell was born in Springfield, Massachusetts, to Clarence Gardner Powell and Blanche Torrey Powell. Her father left her and her mother when she was two years old. She was raised by her mother with the help of her maternal grandparents (who also lived with them). Eleanor Powell was a painfully shy child, not even able to greet guests who would come into her family’s own house.

== Introduction to dance ==
Powell&#x27;s mother, Blanche, sent Eleanor to dance lessons at age 11, in hopes that it would combat her shyness. She trained locally with Ralph McKernan (also the teacher of dancer/choreographer Robert Alton) in classical ballet and &quot;interpretive&quot; modern dance. Powell also trained extensively in acrobatics. She immediately showed a natural aptitude for movement and was discovered by Gus Edwards (of the &quot;Vaudeville Kiddie Review&quot;) while performing acrobatics on a beach in Atlantic City, NJ. She subsequently began working her first paid gigs for Edwards at the age of 12, during her summer holidays. Powell&#x27;s first gig was in Atlantic City at the Ritz Grill, located in the Ambassador Hotel. She performed an acrobatic &quot;specialty&quot; act, and was by no means a star in the show; however, her consistently favorable reviews led to other paid performance opportunities, and eventually, more featured spots. Jack Benny and Eddie Cantor, who frequented Atlantic City and saw her perform, and her teacher, McKernan, are credited with having suggested to Powell that she set her sights on Broadway.

== New York City: introduction to tap ==
In 1927, Powell took a break from her schooling and moved with her mother to New York City. She was signed by William Grady at the William Morris Agency, and although she managed to book jobs almost immediately dancing in clubs, vaudeville and at private parties, her acrobatic specialty which had impressed in Atlantic City was not enough for a career on Broadway. Realizing that in order to be marketable as a dancer on Broadway at that time one had to be able to tap dance, Powell began a package of ten tap lessons at a school run by Jack Donahue and Johnny Boyle – these lessons would be the only formal tap training she would ever have. Powell disliked tap at first and had to be coaxed in order to return after her first lesson. She is quoted as saying &quot;in about the seventh lesson it all came together. Just like an algebra problem – you have a tutor teaching you and all of a sudden you say, &#x27;oh, now I see!&#x27;&quot;.

In training Powell, Donohue and Boyle used an unconventional method: in order to counteract her tendency toward pulling away from the floor and working through her feet, as one does in classical ballet and acrobatics, they had her wear an army surplus belt during her lessons, which had one sandbag attached on either side. This was intended to weigh her down, help her to feel the floor in a different way, and engage with it – to &quot;play&quot; the floor as if it were an instrument. This not only served to help Powell &quot;find her legs&quot; in tap dance, it also was to be a catalyst in the development of her uniquely grounded and smooth tap style.

Powell, now 16 years of age, booked tour on the vaudeville circuit, where she shared a bill with, among others, the renowned tap dance duo Buck &amp; Bubbles. She was strongly influenced by John &quot;Bubbles&quot; Sublett in particular, who was a highly inventive and creative tap dancer. Hailed as the &quot;Father of Rhythm Tap,&quot; he is known for bringing tap dance down into the heels, and incorporating unexpected rhythms that broke out of the more predictable meter of the time. Bill &quot;Bojangles&quot; Robinson had popularized an extremely Irish-influenced tap style, barely leaving the balls of his feet – it was bouncy and buoyant. Sublett &quot;got down into the floor&quot; and his style and inventiveness were a huge inspiration to Eleanor, who had recently &quot;found the floor&quot; herself. Powell named John &quot;Bubbles&quot; Sublett as one of her main influences, and it shows in her grounded, syncopated footwork (what is now thought of as &quot;hoofing,&quot; even though in that era, hoofing really referred to any vaudeville tap act, tap improviser, or tapping chorus member – and a hoofer did not use their arms, instead dancing from the waist-down and letting their upper body stay free and loose).

== Dance style ==
Eleanor Powell developed a dance style that fused her ballet and acrobatic abilities with her grounded taps. She moved smoothly and effortlessly through fast, complex footwork, barely leaving the floor, even to perform tap steps that take place while airborne, such as double pullbacks (sometimes tapping in a &quot;hoofing&quot; style, with natural, loose arms, and other times with a more technical, placed port de bras). This was contrasted with energetic turn sequences, high-flying, buoyant leaps, such as &quot;grand jeté en tourants,&quot; and grande battements, which further showed her technique and flexibility. She incorporated Hula for the film Honolulu, which then infiltrated her choreography for years to come.

== Broadway ==
When she was 17, she brought her graceful, athletic style to Broadway, where she starred in various revues and musicals, including &quot;Follow Thru&quot; (1929), which represented her first Broadway success, &quot;Fine and Dandy&quot; (1930), and &quot;At Home Abroad&quot; (1935). During this time, she was dubbed &quot;the world&#x27;s greatest female tap dancer&quot; due to her machine-gun footwork. In the early 1930s, she appeared as a chorus girl in a couple of early minor musical films.

== Road to Hollywood ==

In 1935, Powell made the move to Hollywood and showcased her talent in a specialty number in her first major film, &quot;George White&#x27;s 1935 Scandals.&quot; However, she later described this experience as a disaster because she was accidentally made up to resemble an Egyptian. This incident left her unimpressed with Hollywood, and when Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) approached her with offers of a contract, she initially turned them down. Powell reportedly attempted to dissuade the studio by making what she believed were unreasonable salary demands. Surprisingly, MGM agreed to her demands and she eventually accepted the contract. The studio then guided her towards stardom, making only minimal changes in her makeup and conduct.

==Film stardom==

Powell was well received in her first starring role in 1935 &quot;Broadway Melody of 1936&quot; (in which she was supported by Jack Benny and Frances Langford), and delighted 1930s audiences with her endless energy and enthusiasm, not to mention her stunning dancing. According to dancer Ann Miller, quoted in the &quot;making-of&quot; documentary &quot;That&#x27;s Entertainment! III&quot;, MGM was headed for bankruptcy in the late 1930s, but the films of Eleanor Powell, particularly &quot;Broadway Melody of 1936&quot;, were so popular that they made the company profitable again. Miller also credits Powell for inspiring her own dancing career, which would lead her to become an MGM musical star a decade later.

Powell would go on to star opposite many of the decade&#x27;s top leading men, including James Stewart, Robert Taylor, Fred Astaire, George Murphy, Nelson Eddy, and Robert Young. Among the films she made during the height of her career in the mid-to-late 1930s were &quot;Born to Dance&quot; (1936), &quot;Rosalie&quot; (1937), &quot;Broadway Melody of 1938&quot; (1937), &quot;Honolulu&quot; (1939), and &quot;Broadway Melody of 1940&quot; (1940). All of these movies featured her amazing solo tapping, although her increasingly huge production numbers began to draw criticism. Her characters also sang, but Powell&#x27;s singing voice was usually (but not always) dubbed. (This would also happen to one of Powell&#x27;s successors, Cyd Charisse.) &quot;Broadway Melody of 1940&quot;, in which Powell starred opposite Fred Astaire, featured an acclaimed musical score by Cole Porter.

Together, Astaire and Powell danced to Porter&#x27;s &quot;Begin the Beguine&quot;, which is considered by many to be one of the greatest tap sequences in film history. According to accounts of the making of this film, including a documentary included on the DVD release, Astaire was somewhat intimidated by Powell, who was considered the only female dancer ever capable of out-dancing Astaire. In his autobiography &quot;Steps in Time&quot; (1959), Astaire remarked, &quot;She &#x27;put &#x27;em down like a man&#x27;, no ricky-ticky-sissy stuff with Ellie. She really knocked out a tap dance in a class by herself.&quot; In his introduction to the clip, featured in &quot;That&#x27;s Entertainment&quot;, Frank Sinatra said, &quot;You know, you can wait around and hope, but I tell ya, you&#x27;ll never see the likes of this again.&quot;

==Decline in popularity==

Following &quot;Broadway Melody of 1940&quot;, Powell was sidelined for many months following a gallstone operation, and things changed somewhat for the worse, at least as far as Powell&#x27;s movie career was concerned. &quot;Lady Be Good&quot; (1941) gave Powell top billing and a classic dance routine to &quot;Fascinatin&#x27; Rhythm,&quot; but the main stars were Ann Sothern and Robert Young. &quot;Ship Ahoy&quot; (1942) and &quot;I Dood It&quot; (1943), in which Powell starred with Red Skelton, are considered lesser efforts, although in &quot;Ship Ahoy&quot;, her character played a central role in the story, and Powell&#x27;s dance skills were put to practical use when she managed to tap out a Morse code message to a secret agent in the middle of a dance routine. In another routine from &quot;Ship Ahoy&quot;, she danced to the Tommy Dorsey Orchestra with Buddy Rich on drums and the two performed a great musical partnership with the number &quot;Tallulah&quot;. She was signed to play opposite Dan Dailey in &quot;For Me and My Gal&quot; in 1942, but the two actors were removed from the picture during rehearsals and replaced by Gene Kelly and Judy Garland. Later, production of a new &quot;Broadway Melody&quot; film that would have paired Powell with Kelly was also cancelled.

Powell parted with MGM in 1943 after her next film, &quot;Thousands Cheer&quot;, in which she appeared only for a few minutes to perform a specialty number (as part of an all-star cast), and the same year married actor Glenn Ford. She danced in a giant pinball machine in &quot;Sensations of 1945&quot; (1944) for United Artists, but the film was a critical and commercial disappointment. Her performance was overshadowed by what was to be the final film appearance of W. C. Fields. She then retired to concentrate on raising her son, Peter Ford, who was born that year. She appeared in a couple of documentary-style short subjects about celebrities in the late 1940s. Overseas audiences saw one additional Powell dance performance in 1946, however: the compilation &quot;The Great Morgan&quot; included a number that had been cut from &quot;Honolulu&quot;.

In 1950, Powell returned to MGM one last time in &quot;Duchess of Idaho&quot;, starring Esther Williams. Appearing as herself in a nightclub scene, a hesitant Powell is invited to dance by bandleader Dick Layne (Van Johnson). She begins with a staid, almost balletic performance until she is chided by Layne for being lazy. She then strips off her skirt, revealing her famous legs, and performs a &quot;boogie-woogie&quot;-style specialty number very similar to the one she performed in &quot;Thousands Cheer&quot; seven years earlier. Williams, in her autobiography &quot;The Million Dollar Mermaid&quot;, writes of being touched, watching Powell rehearsing until her feet bled, in order to make her brief appearance as perfect as possible.

==Later career: TV and stage==

After &quot;Duchess of Idaho&quot;, Powell returned to private life. In May 1952, she emerged as a guest star on an episode of &quot;All Star Revue&quot; with Danny Thomas and June Havoc. Around this time, she was ordained a minister of the Unity Church and later hosted an Emmy Award-winning Sunday morning TV program for youth entitled &quot;The Faith of Our Children&quot; (1953–1955). Her son, Peter Ford, was a regular on this show and would later find his own success as a rock and roll singer and as an actor. In 1955, Powell made her last film appearance when she appeared in &quot;Have Faith in Our Children&quot;, a three-minute short film produced for the Variety Club of Northern California in which Powell asked viewers to donate to the charity. The short, which other than its title had no relation to the TV series, marked the only time Powell appeared on screen with Glenn Ford.

Powell divorced Ford in 1959, and that year, encouraged by Peter, launched a highly publicized nightclub career, including performances in Las Vegas and appearances at Lou Walters&#x27; Latin Quarter in Boston. The athleticism which characterised her dance style remained with her well into middle age. Her live performances continued well into the 1960s. During the early 1960s she made several guest appearances on variety TV programs, including &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot; and &quot;The Hollywood Palace&quot;. She made her final public appearance in 1981 at a televised American Film Institute tribute to Fred Astaire, where she received a standing ovation.

==Death==
Eleanor Powell died February 11, 1982, of ovarian cancer, aged 69, and is interred in the Hollywood Forever Cemetery in Hollywood in the Cathedral Mausoleum, Foyer Niche 432, Tier 3.

==Reintroduction==
Powell was reintroduced to audiences in the popular &quot;That&#x27;s Entertainment!&quot; documentary in 1974, and its sequels &quot;That&#x27;s Entertainment, Part II&quot; (1976) and &quot;That&#x27;s Entertainment! III&quot; (1994) and the related film &quot;That&#x27;s Dancing!&quot; (1985) which spotlight her dancing from films such as &quot;Broadway Melody of 1940&quot;, &quot;Lady Be Good&quot;, and &quot;Born to Dance&quot;. She is one of only a few performers to be the subject of spotlight segments (as opposed to being included in a montage with other performers) in all four films. &quot;That&#x27;s Entertainment! III&quot; is notable for including behind-the-scenes footage of her &quot;Fascinatin&#x27; Rhythm&quot; routine from &quot;Lady Be Good&quot;.

Powell&#x27;s films continue to be broadcast on television regularly by Turner Classic Movies, with most released in the VHS video format in 1980s and 1990s. North American DVD release of her work has been slower in coming. Aside from clips from her films being included in the aforementioned &quot;That&#x27;s Entertainment!&quot; trilogy, plus clips that were featured in other releases such as the 2002 special edition DVD release of &quot;Singin&#x27; in the Rain&quot;, it wasn&#x27;t until the 2003 DVD release of &quot;Broadway Melody of 1940&quot; that a complete Powell film was released in the format. In February 2007, Warner Home Video announced plans to release a boxed DVD set of Eleanor Powell&#x27;s musical films by year end. This did not occur; instead, on April 8, 2008 Warner released a third boxed set in the &quot;Classic Musicals from the Dream Factory&quot; series, with nine films, four of which star Powell: &quot;Broadway Melody of 1936&quot;, &quot;Born to Dance&quot;, &quot;Broadway Melody of 1938&quot;, and &quot;Lady Be Good&quot;. The films are expected to be released in individual two film sets (the two &quot;Broadway Melody&quot; films in one set, &quot;Born to Dance&quot;/&quot;Lady Be Good&quot; on the other) later in the year. Since 2007 several other Powell films have emerged on DVD, including &quot;Rosalie&quot;, &quot;I Dood It&quot; (1943) and &quot;Sensations of 1945&quot; (1945).

== Trivia ==

* Eleanor Powell was inspired by certain forms of the Hula, a Polynesian dance, and learned some hula technique in order to incorporate it into her dance numbers in the film &quot;Honolulu&quot; (1939). This influence remained as part of her repertoire and hints of it can be seen in some subsequent (non Hawaiian-style) numbers of hers, for example, during the introductory (legato) section of her boogie woogie tap feature in &quot;Duchess of Idaho&quot; (1950).
* Eleanor Powell was friends with Bill &quot;Bojangles&quot; Robinson early on in her career, when they both worked in New York and danced at private parties. Powell would accompany Robinson through back entrances and in freight elevators. Due to segregation, he was not allowed to enter through the front. Invariably, the host would offer her a glass of water, and she would answer &quot;Yes, and I&#x27;m sure Mr. Robinson would like one, too.&quot; (And, always, after finishing his glass of water, Robinson would deliberately break his glass, and then pay for the damage, knowing it was unlikely that, after a black man had drunk from it, the glass would be used again.)
* Eleanor Powell was a contributor to &quot;Dance Magazine&quot; in the United States, even contributing a monthly column for the magazine in 1937.
* During 1935, Powell was a regular on radio, where she sang and danced (radio shows had live audiences then), and had her own show that aired weekly on CBS Radio. It was called &quot;The Flying Red Horse Tavern.&quot;
* Powell choreographed her own numbers. She collaborated with the likes of Fred Astaire for duets with him, but for her solos, she was the creative voice for her own movement and rhythm.
* She was heavily involved in the editing process of her musical numbers, and took the time to learn about the technical side, particularly post-production. She would insist on cutting her films with the in-house editor. She believed that one must understand dance to understand how it should be shown to an audience most effectively.
* She was one of the only leading ladies in the Golden Age of Hollywood who, even when partnered with a man, was not secondary to him – she held her own, and even when in ballroom-style holds, often led (as in the &quot;Italian Cafe Routine,&quot; also known as the &quot;Jukebox Dance,&quot; in &quot;Broadway Melody of 1940)&quot;. But most often, she was side by side, as an equal.
* According to Jake McNiece, Powell honored a request for 13 unique signed cheesecake pictures of her which his unit then used to get around the rule that only a single picture of a relative could be displayed in barracks. Each man claimed she was related to him in a different way, from sister, to aunt, to grandmother. She was thereby the Queen of the Filthy Thirteen. McNiece said some of the men jumped into combat with her picture inside of their helmet.

<text>Marie of Champagne ( – 29 August 1204 was the first Latin empress of Constantinople by marriage to Emperor Baldwin I. She acted as regent of Flanders during the absence of her spouse from 1202 until 1204.

==Life==
Marie was a daughter of Henry I, Count of Champagne, and Marie, daughter of King Louis VII of France and Eleanor of Aquitaine.

According to the chronicle of Gislebert of Mons, on 13 May 1179 Marie was officially bethrothed to Baldwin, son of the count of Flanders and Hainaut, to whom she was already promised to be wed in 1171. Her betrothed was Baldwin VI, son of Baldwin V, Count of Hainaut and Margaret I, Countess of Flanders.

===Countess of Flanders===
On 6 January 1186, Marie and Baldwin were married at Valenciennes.

The young countess consort issued charters in her own name and seems to have a soft spot for the cities in Flanders. In 1200 she and her husband also released the Ninove and Bohéries Abbey from every toll on their territory.

In 1200, she and her husband took the cross in Bruges. On 14 April 1202 her husband left Flanders to join the Fourth Crusade. During her husband&#x27;s absence, Marie acted as regent for Flanders for two years.

Marie herself left Flanders to join her husband in Outremer. According to Geoffrey of Villehardouin and other authors she could not join him in the crusade earlier as she was pregnant at the time of his departure. After delivery of the child, Margaret and sufficient recovery, she set forth to join him.

=== Latin Empress ===
Her husband&#x27;s Crusade was diverted to Constantinople, capital of the Roman Empire, where the crusaders captured and sacked the city. Then the Crusaders and Venetian established the Latin Empire of Romaniae in place of the fallen one. On 9 May 1204, Baldwin was elected its first Emperor, making Marie the Empress.

She set sail from the port of Marseille and landed in Acre. It was only when she arrived in Outremer that the news reached her of the fall of Constantinople and the election of Baldwin as the new Emperor of the East. There as an Empress of Constantinople she received the homage of the Prince Bohemond IV of Antioch. She wanted to set sail for Constantinople but fell sick and died in the Holy Land.

News of her death reached Constantinople through Crusading reinforcements from Syria. Baldwin was reportedly afflicted by the death of his wife. Villehardouin reports that Marie &quot;was a gracious and virtuous lady and greatly honoured&quot;.

==Children==
They had two known children:

* Joan, Countess of Flanders (1199/1200 – 5 December 1244).
* Margaret II, Countess of Flanders (2 June 1202 – 10 February 1280).

<text>Jean-Baptiste Nicolas Robert Schuman (; 29 June 18864 September 1963) was a Luxembourg-born French statesman. Schuman was a Christian democratic (Popular Republican Movement) political thinker and activist. Twice Prime Minister of France, a reformist Minister of Finance and a Foreign Minister, he was instrumental in building postwar European and trans-Atlantic institutions and was one of the founders of the European Communities, the Council of Europe and NATO. The 1964–1965 academic year at the College of Europe was named in his honour. In 2021, Schuman was declared venerable by Pope Francis in recognition of his acting on Christian principles.

==Early life==

Schuman was born in June 1886 in Clausen, Luxembourg, inheriting his father&#x27;s German citizenship. His father, Jean-Pierre Schuman (d. 1900), who was a native of Lorraine and was born a French citizen, had become a German citizen when Lorraine was annexed by Germany in 1871, and he left to settle in Luxembourg, not far from his native village of Evrange.

His mother, Eugénie Suzanne Duren (d. 1911), was a Luxembourger and even though Robert Schuman would later become involved in French politics, he grew up and attended school in Luxembourg City, speaking Luxembourgish as his mother tongue.

Schuman&#x27;s secondary schooling from 1896 to 1903 was at Athénée de Luxembourg, followed in 1904 by the Lycée impérial in Metz. From 1904 to 1910, he studied law, economics, political philosophy, theology and statistics at the Universities of Berlin, Munich, Bonn and Strasbourg, and received a law degree with the highest distinction from Strasbourg University. In 1904, Schuman joined the Catholic student association &quot;Unitas&quot; in Bonn.

In 1912, Schuman set up practice as a lawyer in Metz and joined the L&#x27;Union Populaire Catholique. When the war broke out in 1914, he was called up for the auxiliary troops by the German army in Metz but was excused from military service on health grounds. From 1915 to 1918, he served in the administration of the Boulay district.

==Interwar period==
After the First World War, Alsace-Lorraine was returned to France, and Schuman became a French citizen in 1918.

Schuman became active in French politics. In 1919, he was first elected as a member of the Chamber of Deputies on a regional list and later served as the deputy for Thionville (Moselle) until 1958, with an interval during the war. He made a major contribution to the drafting and the parliamentary passage of the reintroduction of the French Civil and Commercial Codes by the French parliament, when the Alsace-Lorraine region, then under German rule and thus German law, returned to France. The harmonisation of the regional law with the French law was called &quot;Lex Schuman&quot;. Schuman also investigated and patiently uncovered postwar corruption in the Lorraine steel industries and in the Alsace and the Lorraine railways, which were bought for a derisory price by the powerful and influential de Wendel family in what he called in the Parliament &quot;a pillage&quot;.

==World War II==
In 1940, because of his expertise on Germany, Schuman was called to become a member of Paul Reynaud&#x27;s wartime government to be in charge of the refugees. He kept that position during the first Pétain government. On 10 July, he voted to give full power to Marshal Philippe Pétain, who supported the armistice with Germany but refused to continue to be in the government. On 14 September, he was arrested in Metz for acts of resistance and protest against Nazi methods. He was interrogated by the Gestapo but the intervention of a German lawyer stopped him from being sent to Dachau concentration camp. Schuman was placed then under house arrest in Neustadt but was able to escape to the unoccupied zone of France in August 1942. Between 1942 and 1944 he also stayed several times at various monasteries such as the En-Calcat Abbey whose liturgical hours he followed.

==French minister==
After the war, Schuman rose to great prominence. He initially had difficulties because of his 1940 vote for Petain and for being one of his ministers. In September 1944, General Jean de Lattre de Tassigny, the commander of the French First Army, sought him out to become a political advisor in the affairs of Alsace-Lorraine, the minister of war, , demanded shortly later that &quot;this product of Vichy be immediately kicked out&quot;. Schuman had been a former minister of Pétain and a parliamentarian who had voted to grant him full powers and so, under the ordinance of 26 August 1944, he was considered ineligible for public office, stricken with &quot;indignité nationale&quot;. On 24 July 1945, Schuman wrote to Charles de Gaulle to ask him to intervene. De Gaulle answered favourably, and on 15 September, Schuman regained his full civic rights, becoming able to again play an active role in French politics.

Schuman was Minister of Finance in 1946 and Prime Minister from 1947 to 1948. He assured parliamentary stability during a period of revolutionary strikes and attempted insurrection. In the last days of his first administration, his government proposed plans that later resulted in the Council of Europe and the European Community single market. Becoming Foreign Minister in 1948, he retained the post in different governments until early 1953. When Schuman&#x27;s first government proposed the creation of a European Assembly, it made the issue a governmental matter for Europe, not merely an academic discussion or the subject of private conferences, like The Hague Congress of the European Movements earlier in 1948. (Schuman&#x27;s was one of the few governments to send active ministers.) The proposal saw life as the Council of Europe and was created within the tight schedule that Schuman had set. At the signing of its Statutes at St James&#x27;s Palace, London, on 5 May 1949, the founding states agreed to define the borders of Europe based on the principles of human rights and fundamental freedoms that Schuman enunciated there. He also announced a coming supranational union for Europe that saw light as the European Coal and Steel Community and other such Communities within a union framework of common law and democracy:
As Foreign Minister, he announced in September 1948 and the next year, before the United Nations General Assembly, France&#x27;s aim was to create a democratic organisation for Europe, which a post-Nazi and democratic Germany could join. In 1949 and 1950, he made a series of speeches in Europe and North America about creating a supranational European Community. This supranational structure, he said, would create lasting peace between Member States.

On 9 May 1950, the principles of supranational democracy were announced in what has become known as the Schuman Declaration. The text was jointly prepared by Paul Reuter, the legal adviser at the Foreign Ministry and his aide and Jean Monnet and two of his team members, Pierre Uri and Étienne Hirsch. The French government agreed to the Schuman Declaration, which invited the Germans and all other European countries to manage their coal and steel industries jointly and democratically in Europe&#x27;s first supranational Community, with its five fundamental institutions. On 18 April 1951, six founder members signed the Treaty of Paris, which formed the basis of the European Coal and Steel Community. They declared that date and the corresponding democratic, supranational principles to be the &#x27;real foundation of Europe&#x27;. Three communities have been created so far. The Treaties of Rome (1957) created the Economic Community and the nuclear non-proliferation Community, Euratom. Together with the intergovernmental machinery of later treaties, they eventually evolved into the European Union. The Schuman Declaration was made on 9 May 1950 and since then, 9 May is designated to be Europe Day.

As Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Schuman was instrumental in the creation of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). Schuman also signed the North Atlantic Treaty for France. The defensive principles of NATO&#x27;s Article 5 were also repeated in the European Defence Community Treaty, which failed since the French National Assembly declined to vote its ratification. Schuman also supported an Atlantic Community.

==European politics==

Schuman later served as Minister of Justice before becoming the first President of the European Parliamentary Assembly (the successor to the &quot;Common Assembly&quot;), which bestowed on him by acclamation the title &#x27;Father of Europe&#x27;. He is considered one of the founding fathers of the European Union. He presided over the European Movement from 1955 to 1961. In 1958, he received the Karlspreis, an Award by the German city of Aachen to people who contributed to the European idea and European peace, commemorating Charlemagne, the ruler of what is now both France and Germany, who lived in and is buried at Aachen. Schuman was also made a knight of the Order of Pius IX.

Schuman was intensely religious and a Bible scholar. He commended the writings of Pope Pius XII, who condemned both fascism and communism. He was an expert in medieval philosophy, especially the writings of Thomas Aquinas, and he thought highly of the philosopher Jacques Maritain, a contemporary.

== Cause of beatification and canonization ==
Schuman demonstrated a monkish asceticism in his daily life and believed that democracy owed its existence to Christianity. 

On 9 June 1990, the Bishop of Metz, Pierre Raffin, authorized the opening of the beatification process. Schuman was proclaimed a Servant of God in May 2004, with the conclusion of the diocesan process. The documents were sent to the Vatican, where the Congregation for the Causes of Saints is studying the dossier.

On 19 June 2021, in an audience granted to Cardinal Marcello Semeraro, Pope Francis authorized the Congregation for the Causes of Saints to promulgate the decree concerning the heroic virtues of Robert Schuman, who can thus be defined as Venerable. The promulgation of the decree is a first step towards canonization by the Roman Catholic Church.

== Memorials ==

The Schuman District of Brussels (including a metro/railway station and a tunnel, as well as a square) is named in his honour. Around the square (&quot;Schuman roundabout&quot;) can be found various European institutions, including the Berlaymont building which is the headquarters of the European Commission and has a monument to Schuman outside, as well as key European Parliament buildings. In the nearby Cinquantenaire Park, there is a bust of Schuman as a memorial to him. The European Parliament awards the Robert Schuman Scholarship for university graduates to complete a traineeship within the European Parliament and gain experience within the different committees, legislative processes and framework of the European Union.

A Social Science University named after him lies in Strasbourg (France) along with the &quot;Avenue du President Robert Schuman&quot; in that city&#x27;s European Quarter. In Luxembourg there is a Rond Point Schuman, Boulevard Robert Schuman, a school called Lycée Robert Schuman and a Robert Schuman Building, of the European Parliament. In Esch-sur-Alzette, Luxembourg, there is a Rue Robert Schuman. The house where he was born was restored by the European Parliament and can be visited, as can his home in Scy-Chazelles just outside Metz.

In 1952 Schuman was awarded with an honorary doctorate in the Netherlands, at the Katholieke Economische Hogeschool Tilburg, at present Tilburg University.

In Aix-en-Provence, a town in Bouches-du-Rhone, France, there is an Avenue Robert Schuman, which houses the three university buildings of the town and in Ireland there is a building in the University of Limerick named the &quot;Robert Schuman&quot; building.

The European University Institute in Florence, Italy, is home to the Robert Schuman Centre for Advanced Studies (RSCAS), focusing on &quot;inter-disciplinary, comparative, and policy research on the major issues on the European integration process&quot;.

The Robert Schuman Institute in Budapest, Hungary, a European-level training institution of the European People&#x27;s Party family is dedicated to promoting the idea of a united Europe, supporting and the process of democratic transformation in Central, Eastern and South Eastern Europe and the development of Christian Democratic and centre-right political parties also bears the name of Robert Schuman.

In 1965, the Robert Schuman Mittelschule in the St. Mang suburb of the city of Kempten in southern Bavaria was named after him.

<text>Miriam Rogers (née Spickler; born January 27, 1956) is an American actress.

Her notable film roles are &quot;Gung Ho&quot; (1986), &quot;Someone to Watch Over Me&quot; (1987), &quot;Desperate Hours&quot; (1990), and &quot;Full Body Massage&quot; (1995). She garnered the greatest acclaim of her career for her role in the religious drama &quot;The Rapture&quot; (1991), with critic Robin Wood declaring that she &quot;gave one of the greatest performances in the history of the Hollywood cinema.&quot; Rogers has since appeared in &quot;Reflections on a Crime&quot; (1994), &quot;The Mirror Has Two Faces&quot; (1996), &quot;Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery&quot; (1997), &quot;Lost in Space&quot; (1998), &quot;Ginger Snaps&quot; (2000), &quot;The Door in the Floor&quot; (2004), and &quot;For a Good Time, Call...&quot; (2012).

Her work in television includes &quot;Paper Dolls&quot; (1984), &quot;Weapons of Mass Distraction&quot; (1997), &quot;The Loop&quot; (2006–2007), and recurring roles on &quot;The X-Files&quot; (1998–1999), &quot;Two and a Half Men&quot; (2011–2015), &quot;Wilfred&quot; (2014), &quot;Mad Men&quot; (2015), &quot;Bosch&quot; (2014–2021), and &quot;&quot; (2022).

==Early life==
Rogers was born Miriam Ann Spickler at Coral Gables Hospital in Coral Gables, Florida. She is the daughter of Philip C. Spickler, a civil engineer, and Kathy Talent, a former dance and drama major. Rogers&#x27;s father was Jewish and her mother Episcopalian. Her father became involved with Scientology before she was born, and the organization was part of her upbringing.

The family lived in Virginia, Arizona, Michigan, and England before settling in Los Angeles. At the age of fourteen, Rogers finished her formal education and graduated from high school. She later worked in a hospital for incapacitated patients outside Palo Alto, California, and for six years she worked part-time as a social worker involved in substance-abuse counseling.

At the beginning of their acting careers, Rogers and Kirstie Alley lived together.

==Career==
After her first marriage ended, Rogers moved to Los Angeles to embark on an acting career. She studied acting with Milton Katselas for nine months and then sought an agent. She screen tested for the lead role in &quot;Body Heat&quot; which eventually went to Kathleen Turner. Her early television roles included guest spots on &quot;Hill Street Blues&quot; (1981) as a love interest for officer Andy Renko (Charles Haid), as well as &quot;Magnum, P.I.&quot; (1982), and &quot;Hart to Hart&quot; (1983). In 1982, Rogers starred in the made-for-TV-movie &quot;Hear No Evil&quot; as Meg. She made her feature film debut in the sports comedy &quot;Blue Skies Again&quot; (1983). Between 1983 and 1984, she worked extensively in television as a series regular on &quot;The Rousters&quot; and as supermodel Blair Harper-Fenton in &quot;Paper Dolls&quot;. In 1986, she starred alongside Michael Keaton in &quot;Gung Ho&quot;.

In 1986, Rogers auditioned for the female lead in &quot;Fatal Attraction&quot; which went to Glenn Close. However, Rogers got her breakthrough role when she was cast opposite Tom Berenger in &quot;Someone to Watch Over Me&quot; (1987). Rogers played Claire Gregory, a socialite who is protected after she witnesses a murder. In 1989, she was in &quot;The Mighty Quinn&quot; starring Denzel Washington. In 1990, she appeared in &quot;Desperate Hours&quot;.

In 1991, Rogers starred as the protagonist in &quot;The Rapture&quot; about a woman who converts from a swinger to a born-again Christian after learning that a true Rapture is upon the world. She received an Independent Spirit Award for Best Female Lead nomination for her role in the film. &quot;Slant Magazine&quot; praised her &quot;spectacular performance, which seems in part inspired by the physical splendors and feral glances of Bette Davis or Barbara Stanwyck.&quot;

Rogers posed nude for the March 1993 edition of &quot;Playboy&quot; magazine, and also appeared on that issue&#x27;s cover. She later explained &quot;Playboy had been after me for years, and finally I agreed to pose when they gave me complete approval over the shoot. It was done in a tasteful way, and since I knew that I wanted to have children soon, I thought it might be nice to have a permanent record of my body in its prime.&quot;

In 1994, Rogers starred as a woman on death row in the prison thriller &quot;Reflections on a Crime&quot; and received the Best Actress prize for the film at the Seattle International Film Festival. &quot;New York Magazine&quot; praised Rogers&#x27;s &quot;typically terrific performance&quot; in the film.

Rogers later joined an ensemble cast in the critically acclaimed comedy-drama &quot;Trees Lounge&quot; (1996). She also had a supporting role alongside Barbra Streisand and Lauren Bacall in &quot;The Mirror Has Two Faces&quot; (1996). Her next film was the beginning of what would become a major franchise, when she appeared as Mrs. Kensington in &quot;Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery&quot; (1997).

In 1998, she co-starred in &quot;Lost in Space&quot;. A year later, she co-produced and co-starred in the Holocaust drama &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Arithmetic&quot;. Together with her fellow producers, Rogers received a Daytime Emmy Award nomination for Outstanding Children&#x27;s Special for the film. Between 1998 and 1999, Rogers also had a recurring role on &quot;The X-Files&quot; playing Diana Fowley for seven episodes. In 2000, she starred in the critically acclaimed Canadian horror film &quot;Ginger Snaps&quot;. She was also a series regular on the short-lived ABC series &quot;The Geena Davis Show&quot; (2000–01).

Rogers later made television appearances on &quot;Dawson&#x27;s Creek&quot; (2003) as the mother of Jen Lindley (Michelle Williams) and in &quot;Las Vegas&quot; (2003). She also appears in the comedy prequel &quot;Dumb and Dumberer: When Harry Met Lloyd&quot; (2003). In 2004, she starred alongside Jeff Bridges and Kim Basinger in the drama &quot;The Door in the Floor&quot;. Between 2006 and 2007, Rogers was a series regular on the Fox comedy &quot;The Loop&quot; playing Meryl. In 2010, Rogers had a guest voice role on &quot;King of the Hill&quot; and served as a producer on &quot;Unstoppable&quot;.

In 2010, she performed at the Geffen Playhouse in &quot;Love, Loss, and What I Wore&quot;. In 2011, she was cast in the recurring role of Robin Schmidt, a primatologist and Ashton Kutcher&#x27;s mother on &quot;Two and a Half Men&quot;. Rogers resumed the role in the season 10 premiere episode. In 2012, she made a guest appearance on &quot;The Client List&quot;, and appeared in the films &quot;For a Good Time, Call...&quot; and, alongside Meryl Streep, in &quot;Hope Springs&quot;.

In 2012, she was cast alongside Chad Michael Murray in the ABC pilot &quot;Scruples&quot;, as Harriet, a &quot;powerful and vindictive magazine editor&quot;. In 2015, she appeared on AMC&#x27;s &quot;Mad Men&quot; playing a bisexual photographer.

From 2014 to 2021, she had a recurring role in &quot;Bosch&quot;. Rogers appears as Honey Chandler, an attorney at odds with the titular character portrayed by Titus Welliver. She has since reprised the role as Honey Chandler in the Amazon Freevee (recently rebranded from IMDb TV) spin-off &quot;&quot;, which premiered in 2022.

==Other ventures==
Having played poker as a teenager, Rogers took up competitive poker in 2003 and finished in the money in her first major tournament at the World Poker Tour&#x27;s 240 player Shooting Stars&#x27; main event No-Limit Texas hold &#x27;em tournament in San Jose, California, on March 4, 2004. She is on the board of directors of the World Poker Tour. In July 2006, she finished in the money (33rd place) at the $1000 Ladies&#x27; No-Limit Hold &#x27;em World Series of Poker event.

==Personal life==

Rogers has been married three times. She married Jim Rogers on August 21, 1976, and assumed his surname; they divorced in September 1980. She then had a relationship with Emilio Estevez. On May 9, 1987, she married actor Tom Cruise in Bedford, New York; the marriage broke down at the end of 1989, and a divorce was finalized in February 1990. Rogers received a settlement of $4 million, and is believed to have introduced Cruise to Scientology.

In a 1993 &quot;Playboy&quot; interview, Rogers discussed her split from Cruise and said that he had been considering becoming a monk, which affected their intimacy. Rogers later retracted the comments and claimed she had been misinterpreted.

In April 1990, Rogers met her present husband, producer Chris Ciaffa, on the set of Ivan Passer&#x27;s made-for-cable film &quot;Fourth Story&quot;. The couple has a daughter, Amazon Studios creative executive Lucy Ciaffa (born November 20, 1994) and a son, ASU baseball player Charlie Ciaffa (born July 30, 2001). They married on March 20, 2003, at the Beverly Hills courthouse. During an interview on &quot;The Late Late Show with Craig Kilborn&quot;, Rogers joked that the marriage – after 13 years living together and two children – was just so they would be eligible for a country club membership.

Rogers has made campaign contributions to the Democratic Party.

===Scientology===
Rogers&#x27;s father became interested in Dianetics in 1952 and later became a prominent Mission Holder with the Church of Scientology and friend of its founder, L. Ron Hubbard. Rogers also reportedly became a highly trained &quot;auditor&quot; with the church. Prior to her acting career, she opened a &quot;field auditing&quot; practice, the Enhancement Center, with her first husband, Jim Rogers. According to Sonny Bono, Rogers was his &quot;auditor&quot; for dianetics. Tom Cruise was also a client before being directed towards a Celebrity Centre.

In an interview given to the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; in 1991, Rogers said about Scientology: &quot;that philosophy was simply part of my upbringing and I liked it. And, I think it was an excellent system of belief to grow up with because Scientology offers an extremely pragmatic method for taking spiritual concerns and breaking them down into everyday applications.&quot;

Rogers has left the Church of Scientology and has been described in media reports as a former member of the church.

Cruise biographer Andrew Morton alleged that Rogers&#x27;s father had been declared a suppressive person after leaving the church in the early 1980s, during a cull of Mission Holders.

According to 2012 article in &quot;Vanity Fair&quot;, Rogers held an unfavorable view of the church&#x27;s controversial leader, David Miscavige. In &quot;Going Clear: Scientology, Hollywood, and the Prison of Belief&quot;, published in 2013, author Lawrence Wright alleged that Miscavige had pushed Rogers out of her marriage with Cruise so the latter could pursue Nicole Kidman.

<doc id="374187" wikidata="Q496893" url="?curid=374187" title="Dyrehavsbakken">
<text>&#x27; (), commonly referred to as &#x27; (, to distinguish it from Dyrehaven, a royal deer park with public access) is an amusement park in Lyngby-Taarbæk, Denmark, near Klampenborg and approximately north of central Copenhagen. It is located in the southern part of Dyrehaven, around away from a public transport connection to the center of Copenhagen (Klampenborg S-train Station).

It opened in and is the world&#x27;s oldest operating amusement park. 

With 2.5–2.9 million visitors per year, it is the second most popular attraction in Denmark, after the more widely known Tivoli Gardens amusement park. Access to the area is free, and admissions are purchased separately for the individual attractions, unlike Tivoli.

==History==

The origins of Dyrehavsbakken can be traced back to 1583 when Kirsten Piil discovered a natural spring in what is now known as Jægersborg Dyrehave or Dyrehaven, a large forest park north of Copenhagen. Residents of Copenhagen were attracted to the spring water due to the poor water quality in central Copenhagen during this period. Many believed the natural spring to have curative properties, and therefore Piil&#x27;s discovery drew large crowds, especially in the springtime. These large crowds attracted entertainers and hawkers, whose presence are the origins of the amusement park today.

For a period the area that the spring was located on was not open to the public, due to it being on royal hunting grounds. In 1669, King Frederick III decided to set up an animal park in the area, and his son Christian V expanded the park to 3–4 times its original size after becoming king in 1670. The area was named Jægersborg Dyrehave, its present name, in 1671. The park was off-limits to the public until 1756, under Frederick V.

Open to the general public once again, Dyrehavsbakken began to flourish. Entertainers, hawkers, and innkeepers returned to the area, and Bakken&#x27;s growing reputation throughout Europe attracted other entertainers and artists, including Pjerrot, a clown who still is a fixture at the park today. The park continued to grow even throughout the Napoleonic Wars. Its popularity was later aided by easier accessibility due to the development of steamships in 1820 and railroads in 1864, as well as publicity from poets and authors.

As the popularity of Bakken grew, its conditions worsened. As a result, some of the business owners, or &quot;tent owners&quot; as they are still called today, created the Dyrehavsbakken Tent Owners&#x27; Association of 1885. The association improved garbage collection, restroom facilities, water supply, publicity, and helped bring electricity to the park. The association is still around today, and all businesses operating in the park are required to join.

The entertainment options also improved over time. Cabarets such as Sansouci, which opened in 1866, and Bakkens Hvile, which opened in 1877, became increasingly popular. The 20th century brought other ventures, such as the Circus Revue and automated moving rides. Over time, more modern rides and entertainment options have been introduced.

==Rides==

Bakken may have started as a place to get clean spring water, but today it is a thriving amusement park filled with modern rides and amenities. Bakken is home to five roller coasters, the most famous of which is (), a wooden roller coaster open since 1932. It was deemed a &quot;Coaster Classic&quot; by the American Coaster Enthusiasts (ACE) until the end of the 2009 season, after which the trains were updated and the brakemen who rode along to control the speed were retired, leading ACE to rescind its &quot;Classic&quot; status. The park is also home to dozens of other amusements and smaller rides suited for all ages.

Bakken contains many other entertainment options in addition to rides. This includes seven different gaming halls that have carnival-style games, slot machines, and dancing. The park&#x27;s mascot, Pjerrot the clown, performs every day for young children. The park is also home to Bakkens Hvile music hall, where cabarets are common, as well as the Circus Revue, a live circus-style performance. There are also live music performances in lounges and bars across the park on a regular basis.

The park is home to dozens of restaurants of several types and price ranges. The style of the restaurants ranges from street food vendors, to buffets, to fancier restaurants. The type of food represented ranges from standard amusement park fare, such as hamburgers and cotton candy, to traditional Danish cuisine, such as Pølser (Danish hot dogs), Æbleskiver (Danish popovers), and Smørrebrød (open-faced sandwiches), to many other types of international cuisine. Bakken also contains numerous bars and lounges, where popular Danish beers such as Carlsberg and Tuborg are served.

==Operation==

<text>The Caspian plover (Anarhynchus asiaticus) is a wader in the plover family of birds. The specific &quot;asiaticus&quot; is Latin and means &quot;Asian&quot;, although in binomials it usually means the type locality was India.

This plover breeds in western and central Asia and migrates southward to eastern and southern Africa to escape the northern winter.

==Description==

This plover is slightly larger than ringed plover, and it recalls greater sandplover and lesser sandplover in appearance. It is slimmer and longer-legged than the sandplovers, and has a much stronger white supercilium, and a long thin bill. It also lacks white tail sides and a weak wing bar.

Summer males have grey-brown backs and a white face and belly. The breast is chestnut, bordered black below. Other plumages have a grey-brown breast band, although the summer female may show a hint of chestnut. The call is a sharp &quot;chip&quot;.

==Distribution and habitat==
The Caspian plover breeds in western Asia in the area of the Caspian Sea. Its range includes southern Russia, Turkey, Iran, Turkmenistan, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and Afghanistan. Its habitat is steppes, desert verges, saltpans and saline soils amongst sparse shrubby vegetation up to an altitude of about . After breeding, it migrates to eastern and southern Africa, going as far as the Zambezi River. Its winter quarters are usually dry grassland, coastal dunes, saltmarshes, dry floodplains and sometimes cultivated land. This plover is a very rare vagrant to western Europe. It is also a rare vagrant to Australia.

==Biology==

It breeds on open grassland in central Asia, mainly to the north and east of the Caspian Sea. It breeds in loose colonies, with three eggs being laid in a nest on the bare ground or among short vegetation.

It feeds in a similar way to other plovers picking beetles, termites, ants, grasshoppers, small snails and other small prey mainly from the ground. It sometimes eats the seeds of grasses.

==Status==

The Caspian plover has a very wide range. The number of birds may be declining slowly due to degradation of its breeding range, especially in Europe, however the IUCN lists it as being of &quot;Least Concern&quot; because it does not consider the rate of decline justifies putting it in a more threatened category.

It is one of the species to which the &quot;Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds&quot; (AEWA) applies.
