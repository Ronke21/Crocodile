<doc id="370408" wikidata="Q671726" url="?curid=370408" title="The Three Friends and Jerry">
<text>The Three Friends and Jerry &quot;()&quot; is a children&#x27;s animated television series produced by Happy Life and TMO Film GmbH (Germany) in association with Nickelodeon UK and Nickelodeon Germany. The show was created by the Swedish illustrator Magnus Carlsson.

HIT Entertainment distributes the series internationally and is listed in the end credits. When HIT Entertainment partnered to launch PBS Kids Sprout in 2005, &quot;The Three Friends and Jerry&quot; was made available on Sprout on Demand.

==Plot==
Jerry is the new kid in town who does not fit with any of his classmates. This show follows his best attempts to join the &#x27;Three Friends&#x27; – Thomas, Eric, and their leader Frank – who do not want him to be part of their group but still let him hang out with them as long as he helps them with their schemes or problems. The friends are often joined by three of their girl classmates: Linda, Mimmi, and Tess and try (and usually fail) to win them over. Usually their antics often result in humiliating situations. Apart from school, the group have to contend with parents, bullies and their own conflicts.

The show takes place in the town of Carlsonville (most likely named after Magnus himself), which is located either in Sweden, Germany or the United Kingdom.

==Characters==
===Main===
* Jerry (Voiced by Viktor Birath (seasons 1–2) Joakim Beutler (season 3) (original) Joona Saastamoinen (Dubbed)) is the new kid in town, who has blond hair and buck teeth. He is a calm and bright boy with a head full of ideas. He desperately wants to join the eponymous Three Friends, but they do not see him as part of their group.
* Frank (Voiced by Sean Bussoli (original) Archit Tripathi (Dubbed)) is the leader of the Three Friends. He is a bald-headed boy who wears a blue T-shirt with a yellow number 1. The polar opposite to Jerry, Frank is short-tempered and cunning. Due to his appearance, he is seen as the ugliest boy in school. He ineffectively tries to win the heart of the leader of the girl gang – Linda – despite the fact they are actually cousins.
* Thomas is a boy with an orange hoodie, never seen without his big green cap. He is dominated by Frank and normally takes his side. Thomas is a very good artist, but he is self-conscious and feels that he needs to hide his creative nature.
* Eric is a boy with chin-length blond hair and a green T-shirt. He loves football and is the best sports player in the school. Just like Thomas, Eric is dominated by Frank.
* Linda is the leader of the girl gang who sometimes acts like a spoiled brat and uses strong language. She is a bit tougher and a little more mature than her two friends, Mimmi and Tess. Linda is also Frank&#x27;s cousin.
* Mimmi is an Asian girl who lives next door to Linda and has a swimming pool in her garden. She wears a blue dress with a smiley face symbol. Her adoptive father has his own business and lots of money. Mimmi considers her wealth as her main asset.
* Tess is a short and shy girl who tends to blindly follow Linda. Tess&#x27;s older brother, Tony, is a cool teenager who drives her to school on his moped. Tess has short blonde hair and wears a white shirt, purple skirt, and green shoes.

===Minor===
* The Teacher teaches Jerry&#x27;s class. She always has unshaven legs. The Three Friends and Jerry often try to send her into space so they will not have any lessons.
* The PE Teacher is Jerry&#x27;s bad-tempered father. He tends to act very loud with the Three Friends and his son, but he has a good heart and intentions. He has red hair and an athletic and muscular body. He lives in a one-floor house with his wife and son.
*Jerry&#x27;s mother is the PE Teacher&#x27;s wife. She has a caring and calm personality. Jerry inherited his looks and personality from her.
* Roy Johnson is Mimmi&#x27;s adoptive father and the wealthiest person in the town. He runs the local shop.
* Monica is an attractive brunette who works at Roy&#x27;s shop. She is also Tony&#x27;s girlfriend.
* Tony is a heavy metal guitarist, Tess&#x27; 16-year-old brother and Monica&#x27;s boyfriend.
* Dick Priest keeps an eye on the town. As a priest, he works in the church. Despite campaigning against everything immoral, he is revealed to be a fan of metal music and horror movies.
* Mr. and Mrs. Ingrid Bertwhistle are Jerry&#x27;s neighbours. Mr. Bertwhistle is a grumpy man obsessed with contacting extraterrestrials. The boys like him to some degree, but he does not fare well with Jerry&#x27;s father. Meanwhile Mrs. Bertwhistle is the librarian of the town&#x27;s public library, she is also a very vocal activist against certain things she believes &quot;corrupts&quot; children.
*Oscar is a local bum who everybody in the town looks down upon. Several years ago, he was a wealthy and respected person. Everything changed when, while being a beauty contest juror, he mistakenly gave the first place to Jerry, when Roy previously bribed him to make his daughter Mimmi win. After losing his wealth, he lives in an old shack. Most of the children are afraid of him.

==Production==
&quot;The Three Friends and Jerry&quot; was produced by Happy Life (Sweden) and TMO Film GmbH (Germany) in association with Nickelodeon UK and Nickelodeon Germany. Internationally, the series was distributed by HIT Entertainment.

In an interview from late 2020, Magnus Carlsson revealed many things about the development of the series. Carlsson first drew the characters around 1993 or 1994, and he later made an animated short starring the characters getting into trouble with drinking. When it was not picked up, he decided to retool the show to be more family-friendly, with him basing the main characters on actual friends he knew growing up (with Thomas being based on himself). When asked about questionable content in the show, Carlsson said that it was never a big deal or problem in Sweden.

The main characters&#x27; long foreheads were inspired by the film “&quot;Coneheads&quot;”.

He also initially wanted the theme song to be a reggae song but it was changed to a more Polka sounding melody.

==Telecast and home media==
In Sweden, the series first aired on SVT for its original run. It later aired reruns on SVT Barn throughout the 2000s and early 2010s.

The show was originally aired in the United Kingdom on Nickelodeon and Nicktoons, with reruns remaining until 2010, mainly to fulfill European content guidelines.

In Germany, the show was planned to air on Nickelodeon Germany, and Nickelodeon Germany is listed in the first few episodes&#x27; credits. However, the original incarnation of Nick Germany shut down in mid-1998. As a result, the show would instead air on Fox Kids (later Jetix and Disney XD) from 2001 until 2009. The show also aired on KIKA until the late 2000s, and ProSieben MAXX from 2013 until 2014.

In the U.S., the show initially aired from 1998 until 2000 on the Fox Family Channel. In 2005, the show&#x27;s distributor, HIT Entertainment, partnered to launch the PBS Kids Sprout channel. The show aired on Sprout until late 2006.

In Canada, the show aired on YTV from 1999 until 2001, and in Australia, it aired on Nickelodeon. It also aired on NCRV in the Netherlands, Nickelodeon in Latin America, Boing in Spain, 2x2 in Russia, Premiere Austria in Austria, and Arutz HaYeladim in Israel.

The series mostly aired on Fox Kids/Jetix and Nickelodeon channels worldwide.

In the late 1990s-2000s, the show was released on VHS (in Sweden only) and DVDs internationally, but never released in North America. Most notably in Australia by Magna Home Entertainment, who released various episodes through 7 volumes.

<doc id="370409" wikidata="Q2594055" url="?curid=370409" title="The Mercers' Company">
<text>The Mercers&#x27; Company, or the Worshipful Company of Mercers, is a livery company of the City of London in the Great Twelve City Livery Companies, and ranks first in the order of precedence of the Companies.

Today, the Company exists primarily as a charitable institution, supporting a variety of causes. The company&#x27;s motto is &quot;Honor Deo&quot; (Latin, &quot;Honour to God&quot;).

== History ==
The Mercers&#x27; Company is based at Mercers&#x27; Hall, 6 Frederick&#x27;s Place in the City of London. The city block upon which it stands contains the archaeology of a Roman-British temple known today as Gresham Temple.

Its corporate existence began in the form of a fraternity at least by the reign of King Henry II, in the mid 1100s if not before.

From 1210 to 1214, the first two Mayors of London, Henry FitzAlwyn and Robert FitzAlwyn were claimed to be members, and branch of the company was established at this time, the Company of Merchant Adventurers, who established themselves at Antwerp, the centre of the cloth trade.

Serlo le Mercer was a member of the company and was one of the negotiators of Magna Carta. 

Although of even older origin, the company was incorporated under a Royal Charter in 1394, the company&#x27;s earliest extant Charter. The company&#x27;s aim was to act as a trade association for general merchants, and especially for exporters of wool and importers of velvet, silk and other luxurious fabrics (mercers). 

From the 14th century onwards the Company held its meetings in the Hospital of St. Thomas of Acon on Cheapside.

Around 1438, William Caxton was apprenticed into the Mercers, under Robert Large, becoming a full member in 1452: his work took him into the Low Countries. 

Between 1517 and 1524, the Company built the Mercer&#x27;s Chapel on this land, with the first Mercers&#x27; Hall above it, fronting Cheapside. 

A member of the Mercers, Robert Packington, was murdered on 13 November 1536, the first recorded death by shooting with a handgun; Rose Hickman, a Protestant, recalled how he used to bring English bybles from beyond sea. and it is thought this may be connected to the murder. The entrance appears to have been on to Ironmonger Lane, and an interconnecting mansion house was secured by Sir Rowland Hill in 1546, which he later put at the use of his protégée and heir (via his niece) Sir Thomas Leigh. Hill is associated with the publication of the Geneva Bible, and is considered a possible inspiration for the character Old Sir Rowland in Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;As You Like It.&quot;

There are accounts of the Mercer&#x27;s buildings being the focus of London state pageantry in the mid- 16th century. For instance Sir Rowland Hill and Sir Thomas Gresham together with Henry VIII and Jane Seymour, are recording as watching the Midsummer Marchers that would become the Lord Mayor&#x27;s Show from the loggia of the hall. Around this time Francis Wren, grandfather of Christopher Wren was a member of the company

Sir Thomas Gresham, founder of the Royal Exchange, was a member of the mercers. He was admitted in 1543 aged 24 as a liveryman, and later that year he left England for the Low Countries, where, either on his own account or that of his father or uncle, he carried on business as a merchant whilst acting in various matters as agent for King Henry VIII.

The Dead Christ, one of the most important surviving works of late English Catholic sculpture prior to the iconoclasm of the Reformation was secretly preserved in a sand-filled pit under the chapel floor, only being found during repairs after the bomb damage of World War Two.

Inigo Jones was admitted as a member in 1620.

The building was destroyed in the Great Fire of London in 1666. 

The second Hall, designed by Edward Jarman and John Oliver, opened in May 1676. 

Following the Napoleonic Wars the first Viscount Hill, the Peninsular general, a relative (via his uncle, Ralph Hill) of the Lord Mayor of the same name was admitted to the company honouring his soldiering. 

The Hall was extensively refurbished during the period 1877 to 1881 (the porch of the 1676 building is now incorporated into the facade of Swanage Town Hall). 

The frontage was remodelled by George Barnes Williams and the interiors were redesigned by John Gregory Crace, the renowned Victorian designer. The Hall was destroyed by fire in 1941 during the Blitz. The third and present Mercers&#x27; Hall was opened in May 1958. The architect was E. Noel Clifton of Gunton and Gunton. The Hall incorporates fittings from the old Hall, including some 17th-century woodwork and Victorian stained glass. 

The Mercers&#x27; Company is the only City Livery Company to have its own private chapel.

==Membership==
Children whose father or mother was a member of the Company at the time of their birth have an automatic right to become Mercers by &#x27;patrimony&#x27;.

Most other members have a family connection to the company and obtain their Freedom by Redemption. Under this process applicants are recommended for membership after an interview and, if approved, they pay a sum of money called a &#x27;fine&#x27;.

Other people can also become Members by Redemption. Membership is sometimes granted because the Company wishes to honour the individual. Notable Members who joined the company by Redemption are Thomas More and Winston Churchill.

One other route to membership is by apprenticeship, but this has not happened recently. In the early days this was a very usual route; an apprentice would be &#x27;bound&#x27; to a Member for a term of about seven years but in exchange the member was required to teach the apprentice such that he was worthy of membership by the end of the term, when he became a &#x27;Freeman&#x27;, for he was no longer bound. Freemen of a Livery Company can apply to become Freemen of the City of London, which used to carry certain privileges, such as the right to drive a flock of sheep without charge over London Bridge.

==Etymology==
The word derives from the Latin &quot;merx, mercis&quot;, &quot;merchandise&quot; from which root the word &quot;merchant&quot; is also derived. 

The words &quot;mercero&quot; and &quot;mercier&quot;, still used in Spanish and French respectively, have meanings similar to &quot;haberdasher&quot;, although the medieval mercers would not have recognised any relationship to that trade which was covered by the separate Worshipful Company of Haberdashers.

==Charitable activities==
In education, the company has administered St Paul&#x27;s School since 1509 (and its prep school St Paul&#x27;s Juniors), St Paul&#x27;s Girls&#x27; School since 1904, two prep schools in London, The Hall School and Bute House, and retains close links with Collyer&#x27;s College, Dauntsey&#x27;s School, Abingdon School, Peter Symonds College and Gresham College, all founded by mercers. In recent times the company has founded a City Technology College (Thomas Telford School) and two City Academies (Walsall Academy and Sandwell Academy).

There was also a Mercers&#x27; School which was granted its first charter in 1447, and closed in 1959 when pupil numbers fell. The school was most recently based in Barnard&#x27;s Inn in Holborn, now the home of Gresham College.

In 2011, the Mercers co-sponsored a new academy school, Hammersmith Academy, specialising in creative and digital media and information technology, located in Hammersmith. The school was established in a new building, with support from the Mercers and the Worshipful Company of Information Technologists.

==Coat of arms==
The origin of the &quot;Mercers&#x27; Maiden&quot;, the heraldic emblem of the company, is not known. Unlike most of the City livery companies, the Mercers had no early grant of arms but the 1425 charter granted a common seal. A few impressions of the early seal survive showing a greatly simplified version of the present coat of arms. The fifteenth century Wardens&#x27; Accounts reveal that, even then, the Company required the device of the Maid&#x27;s Head to be displayed on its property. In 1530 the Company stated to the College of Heralds that they had no arms but only a Maid&#x27;s Head for their common seal and in 1568 the Heralds registered the seal as the company&#x27;s arms.

In 1911, the College of Arms confirmed the arms and granted the company a crest and motto, &#x27;Honor Deo&#x27; (Honour to God). The grant blazons the arms: &quot;Gules, issuant from a bank of clouds a figure of the Virgin couped at the shoulders proper vested in a crimson robe adorned with gold the neck encircled by a jeweled necklace crined or and wreathed about the temples with a chaplet of roses alternately argent and of the first and crowned with a celestial crown the whole within a bordure of clouds also proper&quot;.

==Current activities==
Every year the Mercers&#x27; Company publishes an annual review of their activities. The property portfolio includes 90 residential flats in Covent Garden. In an average year they might give away £7 million, about one-sixth of the total charitable contributions of 111 livery companies.

<doc id="370432" wikidata="Q5055020" url="?curid=370432" title="Economic inequality">
<text>Economic inequality is an umbrella term for a) income inequality or distribution of income (how the total sum of money paid to people is distributed among them), b) wealth inequality or distribution of wealth (how the total sum of wealth owned by people is distributed among the owners), and c) consumption inequality (how the total sum of money spent by people is distributed among the spenders). Each of these can be measured between two or more nations, within a single nation, or between and within sub-populations (such as within a low-income group, within a high-income group and between them, within an age group and between inter-generational groups, within a gender group and between them etc, either from one or from multiple nations).

Income inequality metrics are used for measuring income inequality, the Gini coefficient being a widely used one. Another type of measurement is the Inequality-adjusted Human Development Index, which is a statistic composite index that takes inequality into account. Important concepts of equality include equity, equality of outcome, and equality of opportunity.

Historically, there has been a long-run trend towards greater economic inequality over time. The exceptions to this during the modern era are the declines in economic inequality during the two World Wars and amid the creation of modern welfare states after World War II. Whereas globalization has reduced the inequality between nations, it has increased the inequality within most nations. Income inequality between nations peaked in the 1970s, when world income was distributed bimodally into &quot;rich&quot; and &quot;poor&quot; countries. Since then, income levels across countries have been converging, with most people now living in middle-income countries. However, inequality within most nations has risen significantly in the last 30 years, particularly among advanced countries.

Research has generally linked economic inequality to political and social instability, including revolution, democratic breakdown and civil conflict. Research suggests that greater inequality hinders economic growth and macroeconomic stability, and that inequality of land and human capital reduce growth more than inequality of income. Inequality is at the center stage of economic policy debate across the globe, as government tax and spending policies have significant effects on income distribution. In advanced economies, taxes and transfers decrease income inequality by one-third, with most of this being achieved via public social spending (such as pensions and family benefits). While the &quot;optimum&quot; amount of economic inequality is widely debated, there is a near-universal belief that complete economic equality (Gini of zero) would be undesirable and unachieveable.

==Measurements==

The Gini coefficient (also known as the Gini index or Gini ratio), is a measure of statistical dispersion intended to represent the income inequality, wealth inequality, or consumption inequality within a nation or a social group. It measures the inequality among the values of a frequency distribution, such as levels of income. A Gini coefficient of 0 reflects perfect equality, where all income or wealth values are the same, while a Gini coefficient of 1 (or 100%) reflects maximal inequality among values, a situation where a single individual has all the income or wealth while all others have none.

Oxfam&#x27;s 2021 report on global inequality said that the COVID-19 pandemic has increased economic inequality substantially; the wealthiest people across the globe were impacted the least by the pandemic and their fortunes recovered quickest, with billionaires seeing their wealth increase by $3.9 trillion, while at the same time the number of people living on less than $5.50 a day likely increased by 500 million. According to economist Joseph Stiglitz, the pandemic&#x27;s &quot;most significant outcome&quot; will be rising economic inequality in the United States and between the developed and developing world. The 2024 Oxfam report found a significant increase in inequality as roughly five billion people have become poorer while at the same time the fortunes of the five richest individuals have doubled. The report warns that current trends are paving the way for the world&#x27;s first trillionaire within a decade and global poverty eradication being postponed for 229 years. Oxfam&#x27;s 2025 report shows that over the last year billionaire wealth as surged from $13 trillion to $15 trillion primarily through inheritance, monopoly and powerful connections, and predicts there will be at least five trillionaires in the next decade, while at the same time the number of people living in poverty has barely changed since 1990, with 44% of the global population living on less than $6.85 per day. 

In 2016, the world&#x27;s billionaires increased their combined global wealth to a record $6 trillion. In 2017, they increased their collective wealth to 8.9 trillion. 

The existing data and estimates suggest a large increase in international (and more generally inter-macroregional) components between 1820 and 1960. It might have slightly decreased since that time at the expense of increasing inequality within countries. The United Nations Development Programme in 2014 asserted that greater investments in social security, jobs, and laws that protect vulnerable populations are necessary to prevent widening income inequality.

According to a 2020 study, global earnings inequality has decreased substantially since 1970. During the 2000s and 2010s, the share of earnings by the world&#x27;s poorest half doubled. Two researchers claim that global income inequality is decreasing due to strong economic growth in developing countries. According to a January 2020 report by the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs, economic inequality between states had declined, but intrastate inequality has increased for 70% of the world population over the period 1990–2015. In 2015, the OECD reported in 2015 that income inequality is higher than it has ever been within OECD member nations and is at increased levels in many emerging economies. According to a June 2015 report by the International Monetary Fund (IMF):

Widening income inequality is the defining challenge of our time. In advanced economies, the gap between the rich and poor is at its highest level in decades. Inequality trends have been more mixed in emerging markets and developing countries (EMDCs), with some countries experiencing declining inequality, but pervasive inequities in access to education, health care, and finance remain.

In October 2017, the IMF warned that inequality within nations, in spite of global inequality falling in recent decades, has risen so sharply that it threatens economic growth and could result in further political polarization. The Fund&#x27;s Fiscal Monitor report said that &quot;progressive taxation and transfers are key components of efficient fiscal redistribution.&quot;
In October 2018 Oxfam published a &quot;Reducing Inequality Index&quot; which measured social spending, tax and workers&#x27; rights to show which countries were best at closing the gap between the rich and the poor.

The 2022 World Inequality Report, a four-year research project organized by the economists Lucas Chancel, Thomas Piketty, Emmanuel Saez, and Gabriel Zucman, shows that &quot;the world is marked by a very high level of income inequality and an extreme level of wealth inequality&quot; and that these inequalities &quot;seem to be about as great today as they were at the peak of western imperialism in the early 20th century.&quot; According to the report, the bottom half of the population owns 2% of global wealth, while the top 10% owns 76% of it. The top 1% owns 38%.

===Income===

====Income distribution within individual countries====


In 1820, the ratio between the income of the top and bottom 20 percent of the world&#x27;s population was three to one. By 1991, it was eighty-six to one. A 2011 study titled &quot;Divided we Stand: Why Inequality Keeps Rising&quot; by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) sought to explain the causes for this rising inequality by investigating economic inequality in OECD countries; it concluded that the following factors played a role:
* Changes in the structure of households can play an important role. Single-headed households in OECD countries have risen from an average of 15% in the late 1980s to 20% in the mid-2000s, resulting in higher inequality.
* Assortative mating refers to the phenomenon of people marrying people with similar background, for example doctors marrying other doctors rather than nurses. OECD found out that 40% of couples where both partners work belonged to the same or neighbouring earnings deciles compared with 33% some 20 years before.
* In the bottom percentiles, number of hours worked has decreased.
* The main reason for increasing inequality seems to be the difference between the demand for and supply of skills.
The study made the following conclusions about the level of economic inequality:
* Income inequality in OECD countries is at its highest level for the past half century. The ratio between the bottom 10% and the top 10% has increased from 1:7 to 1:9 in 25 years.
* There are tentative signs of a possible convergence of inequality levels towards a common and higher average level across OECD countries.
* With very few exceptions (France, Japan, and Spain), the wages of the 10% best-paid workers have risen relative to those of the 10% lowest paid.

A 2011 OECD study investigated economic inequality in Argentina, Brazil, China, India, Indonesia, Russia, and South Africa. It concluded that key sources of inequality in these countries include &quot;a large, persistent informal sector, widespread regional divides (e.g., urban-rural), gaps in access to education, and barriers to employment and career progression for women.&quot;
Income inequality is measured by Gini coefficient (expressed in percent %) that is a number between 0 and 1. Here 0 expresses perfect equality, meaning that everyone has the same income, whereas 1 represents perfect inequality, meaning that one person has all the income and others have none. A Gini index value above 50% is considered high; countries including Brazil, Colombia, South Africa, Botswana, and Honduras can be found in this category. A Gini index value of 30% or above is considered medium; countries including Vietnam, Mexico, Poland, the United States, Argentina, Russia and Uruguay can be found in this category. A Gini index value lower than 30% is considered low; countries including Austria, Germany, Denmark, Norway, Slovenia, Sweden, and Ukraine can be found in this category. In the low-income inequality category (below 30%) is a wide representation of countries previously being part of Soviet Union or its satellites, like Slovakia, Czech Republic, Ukraine and Hungary.

In 2012 the Gini index for income inequality for whole European Union was only 30.6%.

Income distribution can differ from wealth distribution within each country. The wealth inequality is also measured in Gini index. There the higher Gini index signify greater inequality within the wealth distribution in country, 0 means total wealth equality and 1 represents situation, where everyone has no wealth, except an individual that has everything.  For instance, countries like Denmark, Norway and Netherlands, all belonging to the last category (below 30%, low-income inequality) also have very high Gini index in wealth distribution, ranging from 70% up to 90%.

===Wealth===
====Wealth distribution between countries====

====Wealth distribution within individual countries====
The wealth is calculated by various factors, for instance: liabilities, debts, exchange rates and their expected development, real estate prices, human resources, natural resources and technical advancements, etc.

===Consumption===

In economics, the &quot;consumption distribution&quot; or &quot;consumption inequality&quot; is an alternative to the income distribution or wealth distribution for judging economic inequality, comparing levels of consumption rather than income or wealth. This is an important measure of inequality as the basic utility of the wealth or income is the expenditure. People experience the inequality directly in consumption, rather than income or wealth.

====Consumption distribution between countries====

====Consumption distribution within individual countries====
==Factors proposed to affect economic inequality==
There are various reasons for economic inequality within societies, including both global market functions (such as trade, development, and regulation) as well as social factors (including gender, race, and education). Recent growth in overall income inequality, at least within the OECD countries, has been driven mostly by increasing inequality in wages and salaries.

Economist Thomas Piketty argues that widening economic disparity is an inevitable phenomenon of free market capitalism when the rate of return of capital (r) is greater than the rate of growth of the economy (g). According to an IMF report in 2016, after reviewing four decades of neoliberalism, it had warned that certain neoliberal policies including privatization, public spending cuts, and deregulation, have resulted in &quot;increased inequality&quot; and are stunting economic growth globally.

===Labour market===
In modern market economies, if competition is imperfect; information unevenly distributed; opportunities to acquire education and skills unequal; market failure results. Many such imperfect conditions exist in virtually every market. According to Joseph Stiglitz this means that there is an enormous potential role for government to correct such market failures.

In the United States, real wages are flat over the past 40 years for occupations across income and education levels, e.g., auto mechanics, cashiers, doctors, and software engineers. However, stock ownership favors higher income and education levels, thereby resulting in disparate investment income.

===Taxes===
Another cause is the rate at which income is taxed coupled with the progressivity of the tax system. A progressive tax is a tax by which the tax rate increases as the taxable base amount increases. In a progressive tax system, the level of the top tax rate will often have a direct impact on the level of inequality within a society, either increasing it or decreasing it, provided that income does not change as a result of the change in tax regime. Additionally, steeper tax progressivity applied to social spending can result in a more equal distribution of income across the board. Tax credits such as the Earned Income Tax Credit in the US can also decrease income inequality. The difference between the Gini index for an income distribution before taxation and the Gini index after taxation is an indicator for the effects of such taxation.

===Education===
An important factor in the creation of inequality is variation in individuals&#x27; access to education. Education, especially in an area where there is a high demand for workers, creates high wages for those with this education. However, increases in education first increase and then decrease growth as well as income inequality. As a result, those who are unable to afford an education, or choose not to pursue optional education, generally receive much lower wages. The justification for this is that a lack of education leads directly to lower incomes, and thus lower aggregate saving and investment. Conversely, quality education raises incomes and promotes growth because it helps to unleash the productive potential of the poor.

Access to education was in turn influenced by land inequalities. In the less industrialized parts of 19th century Europe, for example, landowners still held more political power than industrialists. These landowners did not benefit from educating their workers as much as industrialists did, since &quot;educated workers have more incentives to migrate to urban, industrial areas than their less educated counterparts.&quot; Consequently, lower incentives to promote education in regions where land inequality was high led to lower levels of numeracy in these regions.

===Economic liberalism, deregulation and decline of unions===
John Schmitt and Ben Zipperer (2006) of the CEPR point to economic liberalism and the reduction of business regulation along with the decline of union membership as one of the causes of economic inequality. In an analysis of the effects of intensive Anglo-American liberal policies in comparison to continental European liberalism, where unions have remained strong, they concluded &quot;The U.S. economic and social model is associated with substantial levels of social exclusion, including high levels of income inequality, high relative and absolute poverty rates, poor and unequal educational outcomes, poor health outcomes, and high rates of crime and incarceration. At the same time, the available evidence provides little support for the view that U.S.-style labor market flexibility dramatically improves labor-market outcomes. Despite popular prejudices to the contrary, the U.S. economy consistently affords a lower level of economic mobility than all the continental European countries for which data is available.&quot;

More recently, the International Monetary Fund has published studies which found that the decline of unionization in many advanced economies and the establishment of neoliberal economics have fueled rising income inequality.

Contrary to the proponents of neoliberalism, trickle-down economics have been proven to not be effective in resolving economic inequalities but have instead worsened it.

=== Technology ===

The growth in importance of information technology has been credited with increasing income inequality. Technology has been called &quot;the main driver of the recent increases in inequality&quot; by Erik Brynjolfsson, of MIT. In arguing against this explanation, Jonathan Rothwell notes that if technological advancement is measured by high rates of invention, there is a negative correlation between it and inequality. Countries with high invention rates&quot;as measured by patent applications filed under the Patent Cooperation Treaty&quot;exhibit lower inequality than those with less. In one country, the United States, &quot;salaries of engineers and software developers rarely reach&quot; above $390,000/year (the lower limit for the top 1% earners).

Some researchers, such as Juliet B. Schor, highlight the role of for-profit online sharing economy platforms as an accelerator of income inequality and calls into question their supposed contribution in empowering outsiders of the labour market.

Taking the example of TaskRabbit, a labour service platform, she shows that a large proportion of providers already have a stable full-time job and participate part-time in the platform as an opportunity to increase their income by diversifying their activities outside employment, which tends to restrict the volume of work remaining for the minority of platform workers.

In addition, there is an important phenomenon of labour substitution as manual tasks traditionally performed by workers without a degree (or just a college degree) integrated into the labour market in the traditional economy sectors are now performed by workers with a high level of education (in 2013, 70% of TaskRabbit&#x27;s workforce held a bachelor&#x27;s degree, 20% a master&#x27;s degree and 5% a PhD). The development of platforms, which are increasingly capturing demand for these manual services at the expense of non-platform companies, may therefore benefit mainly skilled workers who are offered more earning opportunities that can be used as supplemental or transitional work during periods of unemployment.

It has also been proposed that information technologies contribute to &quot;winner take most&quot; market concentration, reducing the need for labor across competing suppliers. Market concentration drives down labor&#x27;s share of the GDP, increasing the wealth of capital and thereby exacerbating inequality.

==== Automation ====
Economists have linked automation to increases in economic inequality, as automation raises the returns to wealth and contributes to stagnating wages at the lower end of the wage distribution. Several economists have suggested that automation has increased income inequality by causing low skill jobs to be replaced with machines operated by technologically skilled workers, thereby reducing the demand for unskilled labor while increasing the demand for skilled labor.

===Globalization===

Trade liberalization may shift economic inequality from a global to a domestic scale. When rich countries trade with poor countries, the low-skilled workers in the rich countries may see reduced wages as a result of the competition, while low-skilled workers in the poor countries may see increased wages. Trade economist Paul Krugman estimates that trade liberalisation has had a measurable effect on the rising inequality in the United States. He attributes this trend to increased trade with poor countries and the fragmentation of the means of production, resulting in low skilled jobs becoming more tradeable.

Anthropologist Jason Hickel contends that globalization and &quot;structural adjustment&quot; set off the &quot;race to the bottom&quot;, a significant driver of surging global inequality. Another driver Hickel mentions is the debt system which advanced the need for structural adjustment in the first place.

===Gender===

In many countries, there is a gender pay gap in favor of males in the labor market. Several factors other than discrimination contribute to this gap. On average, women are more likely than men to consider factors other than pay when looking for work and may be less willing to travel or relocate. Thomas Sowell, in his book &quot;Knowledge and Decisions&quot;, claims that this difference is due to women not taking jobs due to marriage or pregnancy. A U.S. Census&#x27;s report stated that in US once other factors are accounted for there is still a difference in earnings between women and men. A study done on three post-soviet countries Armenia, Georgia, and Azerbaijan reveals that gender is one of the driving forces of income inequality, and being female has a significant negative effect on income when other factors are held equal. The results show more than 50% gender pay gap in all three countries. These findings are because usually employers tend to avoid hiring women because of possible maternity leave. Other reason for this can be occupational segregation, which implies that women are usually accumulated in lower-paid positions and sectors, such as social services and education.

=== Race ===
There is also a globally recognized disparity in the wealth, income, and economic welfare of people of different races. In many nations, data exists to suggest that members of certain racial demographics experience lower wages, fewer opportunities for career and educational advancement, and intergenerational wealth gaps. Studies have uncovered the emergence of what is called &quot;ethnic capital&quot;, by which people belonging to a race that has experienced discrimination are born into a disadvantaged family from the beginning and therefore have less resources and opportunities at their disposal. The universal lack of education, technical and cognitive skills, and inheritable wealth within a particular race is often passed down between generations, compounding in effect to make escaping these racialized cycles of poverty increasingly difficult. Additionally, ethnic groups that experience significant disparities are often also minorities, at least in representation though often in number as well, in the nations where they experience the harshest disadvantage. As a result, they are often segregated either by government policy or social stratification, leading to ethnic communities that experience widespread gaps in wealth and aid.

Redlining intentionally excluded black Americans from accumulating intergenerational wealth. The effects of this exclusion on black Americans&#x27; health continue to play out daily, generations later, in the same communities. This is evident currently in the disproportionate effects that COVID-19 has had on the same communities which the HOLC redlined in the 1930s. Research published in September 2020 overlaid maps of the highly affected COVID-19 areas with the HOLC maps, showing that those areas marked &quot;risky&quot; to lenders because they contained minority residents were the same neighborhoods most affected by COVID-19. The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) looks at inequities in the social determinants of health like concentrated poverty and healthcare access that are interrelated and influence health outcomes with regard to COVID-19 as well as quality of life in general for minority groups. The CDC points to discrimination within health care, education, criminal justice, housing, and finance, direct results of systematically subversive tactics like redlining which led to chronic and toxic stress that shaped social and economic factors for minority groups, increasing their risk for COVID-19. Healthcare access is similarly limited by factors like a lack of public transportation, child care, and communication and language barriers which result from the spatial and economic isolation of minority communities from redlining. Educational, income, and wealth gaps that result from this isolation mean that minority groups&#x27; limited access to the job market may force them to remain in fields that have a higher risk of exposure to the virus, without options to take time off. Finally, a direct result of redlining is the overcrowding of minority groups into neighborhoods that do not boast adequate housing to sustain burgeoning populations, leading to crowded conditions that make prevention strategies for COVID-19 nearly impossible to implement.

As a general rule, races which have been historically and systematically colonized (typically indigenous ethnicities) continue to experience lower levels of financial stability in the present day. The global South is considered to be particularly victimized by this phenomenon, though the exact socioeconomic manifestations change across different regions.

==== Westernized Nations ====
While the progression of civil rights movements and justice reform has improved access to education and other economic opportunities in politically advanced nations, racial income and wealth disparity still exists. In the United States for example, African American populations are more likely to drop out of high school and college, are typically employed for fewer hours at lower wages, have lower than average intergenerational wealth, and are more likely to use welfare as young adults than their white counterparts. The racial wealth gap in the US has been maintained throughout history. In 1863, two years prior to emancipation from slavery, Black people owned 0.5 percent of the US national wealth, while in 2019 it is just over 1.5 percent.

Mexican-Americans, while suffering less debilitating socioeconomic factors than black Americans, experience deficiencies in the same areas when compared to whites and have not assimilated financially to the level of stability experienced by white Americans as a whole. These experiences are the effects of the measured disparity due to race in countries like the US, where studies show that in comparison to whites, blacks suffer from drastically lower levels of upward mobility, higher levels of downward mobility, and poverty that is more easily transmitted to offspring as a result of the disadvantage stemming from the era of slavery and post-slavery racism that has been passed through racial generations to the present. These are lasting financial inequalities that apply in varying magnitudes to most non-white populations in nations such as the US, the UK, France, Spain, Australia, etc.

==== Latin America ====
In the countries of the Caribbean, Central America, and South America, many ethnicities continue to deal with the effects of European colonization, and in general nonwhites tend to be noticeably poorer than whites in this region. In many countries with significant populations of indigenous races and those of Afro-descent (such as Mexico, Colombia, Chile, etc.) income levels can be roughly half as high as those experiences by white demographics, and this inequity is accompanied by systematically unequal access to education, career opportunities, and poverty relief. This region of the world, apart from urbanizing areas like Brazil and Costa Rica, continues to be understudied and often the racial disparity is denied by Latin Americans who consider themselves to be living in post-racial and post-colonial societies far removed from intense social and economic stratification despite the evidence to the contrary.

==== Africa ====
African countries, too, continue to deal with the effects of the Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade, which set back economic development as a whole for blacks of African citizenship more than any other region. The degree to which colonizers stratified their holdings on the continent on the basis of race has had a direct correlation in the magnitude of disparity experienced by nonwhites in the nations that eventually rose from their colonial status. Former French colonies, for example, see much higher rates of income inequality between whites and nonwhites as a result of the rigid hierarchy imposed by the French who lived in Africa at the time. Another example is found in South Africa, which, still reeling from the socioeconomic impacts of Apartheid, experiences some of the highest racial income and wealth inequality in all of Africa. In these and other countries like Nigeria, Zimbabwe, and Sierra Leone, movements of civil reform have initially led to improved access to financial advancement opportunities, but data shows that for nonwhites this progress is either stalling or erasing itself in the newest generation of blacks that seek education and improved transgenerational wealth. The economic status of one&#x27;s parents continues to define and predict the financial futures of African and minority ethnic groups.

==== Asia ====
Asian regions and countries such as China, the Middle East, and Central Asia have been vastly understudied in terms of racial disparity, but even here the effects of Western colonization provide similar results to those found in other parts of the globe. Additionally, cultural and historical practices such as the caste system in India leave their marks as well. While the disparity is greatly improving in the case of India, there still exists social stratification between peoples of lighter and darker skin tones that cumulatively result in income and wealth inequality, manifesting in many of the same poverty traps seen elsewhere.

=== Economic development ===
Economist Simon Kuznets argued that levels of economic inequality are in large part the result of stages of development. According to Kuznets, countries with low levels of development have relatively equal distributions of wealth. In the early stages, individual sectors or industries are developed first, which leads to an unequal distribution of income and wealth, resulting in growing inequality within a country. As the economy progresses and development takes place in more economic sectors, eventually attracting more workers, economic inequality decreases. Although the Kuznets curve described the development of inequality well at the time of its publication, there is now a growing number of critical voices questioning the link between inequality and development.

===Wealth concentration===

Wealth concentration is the process by which, under certain conditions, newly created wealth concentrates in the possession of already-wealthy individuals or entities. Accordingly, those who already hold wealth have the means to invest in new sources of creating wealth or to otherwise leverage the accumulation of wealth, and thus they are the beneficiaries of the new wealth. Over time, wealth concentration can significantly contribute to the persistence of inequality within society. Thomas Piketty in his book &quot;Capital in the Twenty-First Century&quot; argues that the fundamental force for divergence is the usually greater return of capital (r) than economic growth (g), and that larger fortunes generate higher returns.

===Rent seeking===

Economist Joseph Stiglitz argues that rather than explaining concentrations of wealth and income, market forces should serve as a brake on such concentration, which may better be explained by the non-market force known as &quot;rent-seeking&quot;. While the market will bid up compensation for rare and desired skills to reward wealth creation, greater productivity, etc., it will also prevent successful entrepreneurs from earning excess profits by fostering competition to cut prices, profits and large compensation. A better explainer of growing inequality, according to Stiglitz, is the use of political power generated by wealth by certain groups to shape government policies financially beneficial to them. This process, known to economists as rent-seeking, brings income not from creation of wealth but from &quot;grabbing a larger share of the wealth that would otherwise have been produced without their effort&quot;.

===Finance industry===
Jamie Galbraith argues that countries with larger financial sectors have greater inequality, and the link is not an accident.

===Global warming and climate change===

A 2019 study published in &quot;PNAS&quot; found that global warming plays a role in increasing economic inequality between countries, boosting economic growth in developed countries while hampering such growth in developing nations of the Global South. The study says that 25% of gap between the developed world and the developing world can be attributed to global warming.

A 2020 report by Oxfam and the Stockholm Environment Institute says that the wealthiest 10% of the global population were responsible for more than half of global carbon dioxide emissions from 1990 to 2015, which increased by 60%. According to a 2020 report by the UNEP, overconsumption by the rich is a significant driver of the climate crisis, and the wealthiest 1% of the world&#x27;s population are responsible for more than double the greenhouse gas emissions of the poorest 50% combined. Inger Andersen, in the foreword to the report, said &quot;this elite will need to reduce their footprint by a factor of 30 to stay in line with the Paris Agreement targets.&quot; A 2022 report by Oxfam found that the business investments of the wealthiest 125 billionaires emit 393 million metric tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions annually.

In July 2023, a letter sent to the United Nations secretary general António Guterres and World Bank president Ajay Banga by a group of over 200 economists from 67 countries, including Jayati Ghosh, Joseph Stiglitz and Thomas Piketty, warned that if the sharp increase in economic inequality is not reversed, it will &quot;entrench poverty and increase the risk of climate breakdown.&quot;

According to UNCTAD&#x27;s World Investment Report, poorer countries would need $4 trillion per year to accomplish the SDGs by 2030, up from $1.5 trillion in 2015. $1.7 trillion in green energy investment is required each year, while the majority of green foreign direct investment continues to flow to established nations.

===Politics===
Joseph Stiglitz argues in &quot;The Price of Inequality&quot; (2012) that the economic inequality is inevitable and permanent, because it is caused by the great amount of political power the richest have. He wrote, &quot;While there may be underlying economic forces at play, politics have shaped the market, and shaped it in ways that advantage the top at the expense of the rest.&quot;

===Cognitive biases===
Research has shown that biased decision-making does not alone explain a significant proportion of inequality, therefore inequality cannot be explained by cognitive biases of a specific sub-population, such as temporal discounting (i.e., not preferring immediate funds over larger future gains), overestimation (i.e. thinking you are better than you are at making decisions), over-placement (i.e. thinking you are better than the average person at making decisions), and extremeness aversion (i.e. taking the &#x27;middle option&#x27; simply because it seems safer than the highest or lowest).

==Mitigating factors==

Countries with a left-leaning legislature generally have lower levels of inequality. Many factors constrain economic inequalitythey may be divided into two classes: market driven, and government sponsored. The relative merits and effectiveness of each approach is a subject of debate:

Market forces outside of government intervention that can reduce economic inequality include:
* propensity to spend: with rising wealth &amp; income, a person may spend more. In an extreme example, if one person owned everything, they would immediately need to hire people to maintain their properties, thus reducing the wealth concentration. On the other hand, high-income persons have higher propensity to save. Robin Maialeh then shows that increasing economic wealth decreases propensity to spend and increases propensity to invest which consequently leads to even greater growth rate of already rich agents.
Typical government initiatives intended to reduce economic inequality include:
* Public education: increasing the supply of skilled labor and reducing income inequality due to education differentials.
* Progressive taxation: the rich are taxed proportionally more than the poor, reducing the amount of income inequality in society if the change in taxation does not cause changes in income.
Research shows that since 1300, the only periods with significant declines in wealth inequality in Europe were the Black Death and the two World Wars. Historian Walter Scheidel posits that, since the Stone Age, only extreme violence, catastrophes and upheaval in the form of total war, Communist revolutions, the French Revolution, pestilence and state collapse have significantly reduced inequality. He has stated that &quot;only all-out thermonuclear war might fundamentally reset the existing distribution of resources&quot; and that &quot;peaceful policy reform may well prove unequal to the growing challenges ahead.&quot; However, Scheidel also stated that &quot;There is certainly room for incremental change, that&#x27;s what the example of Latin America shows in the past 15 years or so.&quot;

===Policy responses intended to mitigate===
A 2011 OECD study makes a number of suggestions to its member countries, including:
* Well-targeted income-support policies.
* Facilitation and encouragement of access to employment.
* Better job-related training and education for the low-skilled (on-the-job training) would help to boost their productivity potential and future earnings.
* Better access to formal education.

Progressive taxation reduces absolute income inequality when the higher rates on higher-income individuals are paid and not evaded, and transfer payments and social safety nets result in progressive government spending. Wage ratio legislation has also been proposed as a means of reducing income inequality. The OECD asserts that public spending is vital in reducing the ever-expanding wealth gap.

Deferred investment programs that increase stock ownership amongst lower income levels can supplement income to compensate wage stagnation.

The economists Emmanuel Saez and Thomas Piketty recommend much higher top marginal tax rates on the wealthy, up to 50 percent, 70 percent or even 90 percent. Ralph Nader, Jeffrey Sachs, the United Front Against Austerity, among others, call for a financial transaction tax (also known as the Robin Hood tax) to bolster the social safety net and the public sector.

&quot;The Economist&quot; wrote in December 2013: &quot;A minimum wage, providing it is not set too high, could thus boost pay with no ill effects on jobs...America&#x27;s federal minimum wage, at 38% of median income, is one of the rich world&#x27;s lowest. Some studies find no harm to employment from federal or state minimum wages, others see a small one, but none finds any serious damage.&quot;

General limitations on and taxation of rent-seeking are popular across the political spectrum.

Public policy responses addressing causes and effects of income inequality in the US include: progressive tax incidence adjustments, strengthening social safety net provisions such as Aid to Families with Dependent Children, welfare, the food stamp program, Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid, organizing community interest groups, increasing and reforming higher education subsidies, increasing infrastructure spending, and placing limits on and taxing rent-seeking.

A 2017 study in the &quot;Journal of Political Economy&quot; by Daron Acemoglu, James Robinson and Thierry Verdier argues that American &quot;cutthroat&quot; capitalism and inequality gives rise to technology and innovation that more &quot;cuddly&quot; forms of capitalism cannot. As a result, &quot;the diversity of institutions we observe among relatively advanced countries, ranging from greater inequality and risk-taking in the United States to the more egalitarian societies supported by a strong safety net in Scandinavia, rather than reflecting differences in fundamentals between the citizens of these societies, may emerge as a mutually self-reinforcing world equilibrium. If so, in this equilibrium, &#x27;we cannot all be like the Scandinavians,&#x27; because Scandinavian capitalism depends in part on the knowledge spillovers created by the more cutthroat American capitalism.&quot; A 2012 working paper by the same authors, making similar arguments, was challenged by Lane Kenworthy, who posited that, among other things, the Nordic countries are consistently ranked as some of the world&#x27;s most innovative countries by the World Economic Forum&#x27;s Global Competitiveness Index, with Sweden ranking as the most innovative nation, followed by Finland, for 2012–2013; the U.S. ranked sixth.

There are however global initiative like the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 10 which aims to garner international efforts in reducing economic inequality considerably by 2030.

==Effects==

A lot of research has been done about the effects of economic inequality on different aspects in society:
* Health: For long time the higher material living standards lead to longer life, as those people were able to get enough food, water and access to warmth. British researchers Richard G. Wilkinson and Kate Pickett have found higher rates of health and social problems (obesity, mental illness, homicides, teenage births, incarceration, child conflict, drug use) in countries and states with higher inequality. Their research included 24 developed countries, including most U.S. states, and found that in the more developed countries, such as Finland and Japan, the heath issues are much lower than in states with rather higher inequality rates, such as Utah and New Hampshire. Some studies link a surge in &quot;deaths of despair&quot;, suicide, drug overdoses and alcohol related deaths, to widening income inequality. Conversely, other research did not find these effects or concluded that research suffered from issues of confounding variables.
* Social goods: British researchers Richard G. Wilkinson and Kate Pickett have found lower rates of social goods (life expectancy by country, educational performance, trust among strangers, women&#x27;s status, social mobility, even numbers of patents issued) in countries and states with higher inequality.
* Social cohesion: Research has shown an inverse link between income inequality and social cohesion. In more equal societies, people are much more likely to trust each other, measures of social capital (the benefits of goodwill, fellowship, mutual sympathy and social connectedness among groups who make up a social units) suggest greater community involvement.
* Happiness: According to the 2019 World Happiness Report, increasing socioeconomic inequality, along with rising healthcare costs, surging addiction rates, and an unhealthy work–life balance, are causes of unhappiness around the world.
* Crime: The cross national research shows that in societies with less economic inequality the homicide rates are consistently lower. A 2016 study finds that interregional inequality increases terrorism. Other research has argued inequality has little effect on crime rates.
* Welfare: Studies have found evidence that in societies where inequality is lower, population-wide satisfaction and happiness tend to be higher.
* Poverty: Study made by Jared Bernstein and Elise Gould suggest, that the poverty in the United States could have been reduced by the lowering of economic inequality for the past few decades.
* Debt: Income inequality has been the driving factor in the growing household debt, as high earners bid up the price of real estate and middle income earners go deeper into debt trying to maintain what once was a middle class lifestyle.
* Economic growth: A 2016 meta-analysis found that &quot;the effect of inequality on growth is negative and more pronounced in less developed countries than in rich countries&quot;, though the average impact on growth was not significant. The study also found that wealth inequality is more pernicious to growth than income inequality.
* Civic participation: Higher income inequality led to less of all forms of social, cultural, and civic participation among the less wealthy.
* Political instability: Studies indicate that economic inequality leads to greater political instability, including an increased risk of democratic breakdown and civil conflict. A significant impact of inequality on civil war probability has been found through anthropometric methods.
* Political party responses: One study finds that economic inequality prompts attempts by left-leaning politicians to pursue redistributive policies while right-leaning politicians seek to repress the redistributive policies.

==Perspectives==

===Socialist perspectives===
Socialists attribute the vast disparities in wealth to the private ownership of the means of production by a class of owners, creating a situation where a small portion of the population lives off unearned property income by virtue of ownership titles in capital equipment, financial assets and corporate stock. By contrast, the vast majority of the population is dependent on income in the form of a wage or salary. In order to rectify this situation, socialists argue that the means of production should be socially owned so that income differentials would be reflective of individual contributions to the social product.

Marxian economics attributes rising inequality to job automation and capital deepening within capitalism. The process of job automation conflicts with the capitalist property form and its attendant system of wage labor. In this analysis, capitalist firms increasingly substitute capital equipment for labor inputs (workers) under competitive pressure to reduce costs and maximize profits. Over the long term, this trend increases the organic composition of capital, meaning that less workers are required in proportion to capital inputs, increasing unemployment (the &quot;reserve army of labour&quot;). This process exerts a downward pressure on wages. The substitution of capital equipment for labor (mechanization and automation) raises the productivity of each worker, resulting in a situation of relatively stagnant wages for the working class amidst rising levels of property income for the capitalist class.

Marxist socialists ultimately predict the emergence of a communist society based on the common ownership of the means of production, where each individual citizen would have free access to the articles of consumption (&quot;From each according to his ability, to each according to his need&quot;). According to Marxist philosophy, equality in the sense of free access is essential for freeing individuals from dependent relationships, thereby allowing them to transcend alienation.

===Meritocracy===
Meritocracy favors an eventual society where an individual&#x27;s success is a direct function of his merit, or contribution. Economic inequality would be a natural consequence of the wide range in individual skill, talent and effort in human population. David Landes stated that the progression of Western economic development that led to the Industrial Revolution was facilitated by men advancing through their own merit rather than because of family or political connections.

===Liberal perspectives===
Most modern social liberals, including centrist or left-of-center political groups, believe that the capitalist economic system should be fundamentally preserved, but the status quo regarding the income gap must be reformed. Social liberals favor a capitalist system with active Keynesian macroeconomic policies and progressive taxation (to even out differences in income inequality). Research indicates that people who hold liberal beliefs tend to see greater income inequality as morally wrong.

However, contemporary classical liberals and libertarians generally do not take a stance on wealth inequality, but believe in equality under the law regardless of whether it leads to unequal wealth distribution. In 1966 Ludwig von Mises, a prominent figure in the Austrian School of economic thought, explains:

The liberal champions of equality under the law were fully aware of the fact that men are born unequal and that it is precisely their inequality that generates social cooperation and civilization. Equality under the law was in their opinion not designed to correct the inexorable facts of the universe and to make natural inequality disappear. It was, on the contrary, the device to secure for the whole of mankind the maximum of benefits it can derive from it. Henceforth no man-made institutions should prevent a man from attaining that station in which he can best serve his fellow citizens.

Robert Nozick argued that government redistributes wealth by force (usually in the form of taxation), and that the ideal moral society would be one where all individuals are free from force. However, Nozick recognized that some modern economic inequalities were the result of forceful taking of property, and a certain amount of redistribution would be justified to compensate for this force but not because of the inequalities themselves. John Rawls argued in &quot;A Theory of Justice&quot; that inequalities in the distribution of wealth are only justified when they improve society as a whole, including the poorest members. Rawls does not discuss the full implications of his theory of justice. Some see Rawls&#x27;s argument as a justification for capitalism since even the poorest members of society theoretically benefit from increased innovations under capitalism; others believe only a strong welfare state can satisfy Rawls&#x27;s theory of justice.

Classical liberal Milton Friedman believed that if government action is taken in pursuit of economic equality then political freedom would suffer. In a famous quote, he said:

A society that puts equality before freedom will get neither. A society that puts freedom before equality will get a high degree of both.

Economist Tyler Cowen has argued that though income inequality has increased within nations, globally it has fallen over the 20 years leading up to 2014. He argues that though income inequality may make individual nations worse off, overall, the world has improved as global inequality has been reduced.

===Social justice arguments===
Patrick Diamond and Anthony Giddens (professors of Economics and Sociology, respectively) hold that &#x27;pure meritocracy is incoherent because, without redistribution, one generation&#x27;s successful individuals would become the next generation&#x27;s embedded caste, hoarding the wealth they had accumulated&#x27;.

They also state that social justice requires redistribution of high incomes and large concentrations of wealth in a way that spreads it more widely, in order to &quot;recognize the contribution made by all sections of the community to building the nation&#x27;s wealth.&quot; (Patrick Diamond and Anthony Giddens, June 27, 2005, New Statesman)

Pope Francis stated in his &quot;Evangelii gaudium&quot;, that &quot;as long as the problems of the poor are not radically resolved by rejecting the absolute autonomy of markets and financial speculation and by attacking the structural causes of inequality, no solution will be found for the world&#x27;s problems or, for that matter, to any problems.&quot; He later declared that &quot;inequality is the root of social evil.&quot;

When income inequality is low, aggregate demand will be relatively high, because more people who want ordinary consumer goods and services will be able to afford them, while the labor force will not be as relatively monopolized by the wealthy.

===Effects on social welfare===
In most western democracies, the desire to eliminate or reduce economic inequality is generally associated with the political left. One practical argument in favor of reduction is the idea that economic inequality reduces social cohesion and increases social unrest, thereby weakening the society. There is evidence that this is true (see inequity aversion) and it is intuitive, at least for small face-to-face groups of people. Alberto Alesina, Rafael Di Tella, and Robert MacCulloch find that inequality negatively affects happiness in Europe but not in the United States.

It has also been argued that economic inequality invariably translates to political inequality, which further aggravates the problem. Even in cases where an increase in economic inequality makes nobody economically poorer, an increased inequality of resources is disadvantageous, as increased economic inequality can lead to a power shift due to an increased inequality in the ability to participate in democratic processes. According to Paul and Moser, countries with high income inequality and poor unemployment protections experience worse mental health outcomes among the unemployed.

===Capabilities approach===
The capabilities approach – sometimes called the human development approach – looks at income inequality and poverty as form of &quot;capability deprivation&quot;. Unlike neoliberalism, which &quot;defines well-being as utility maximization&quot;, economic growth and income are considered a means to an end rather than the end itself. Its goal is to &quot;wid[en] people&#x27;s choices and the level of their achieved well-being&quot; through increasing functioning (the things a person values doing), capabilities (the freedom to enjoy functionings) and agency (the ability to pursue valued goals).

When a person&#x27;s capabilities are lowered, they are in some way deprived of earning as much income as they would otherwise. An old, ill man cannot earn as much as a healthy young man; gender roles and customs may prevent a woman from receiving an education or working outside the home. There may be an epidemic that causes widespread panic, or there could be rampant violence in the area that prevents people from going to work for fear of their lives. As a result, income inequality increases, and it becomes more difficult to reduce the gap without additional aid.

=== Societal acceptance ===
A 2022 study published in Perspectives on Psychological Science found that in countries where neoliberal institutions have significant influence over policies, the psychology of those population are shaped to have both a higher tolerance of large levels of income inequality, and prefer it over more egalitarian outcomes.

According to a January 2025 Pew Research Center report, the majority of adults across 36 countries say that economic inequality is a major problem, along with the undue political influence of the wealthy.

===Public perception and accuracy thereof===
In the US, a 2011 study found that there is a significant difference in the measured wealth distribution and the public&#x27;s understanding of it. The actual wealth going to the top quintile in 2011 was around 84%, whereas the average amount of wealth that the general public estimated to go to the top quintile was around 58%.
=== Arguments that economic inequality is not a problem ===
The majority of researchers who analyze economic inequality argue that today&#x27;s levels are problematic and deserve some mitigation. There are however, some who disagree, and feel that current levels of inequality are necessary because it encourages individuals to gain useful skills and take risks, thereby encouraging growth and innovation, which are necessary for progress. Some have also argued that economic inequality is a natural and fair outcome in market economies, in which the rewards are distributed based on different economic contributions because individuals have different attitudes and talents. Many who feel that economic inequality is not a significant issue are associated with conservative or libertarian think tanks funded by corporations and the wealthy like The Heritage Foundation, the Manhattan Institute, the Cato Institute or the American Enterprise Institute, who may also feel that policies which would reduce inequality are direct attacks on their favored version of capitalism, laissez-faire capitalism. In addition, some feel that economic inequality has not actually increased significantly.

<text>Karl Rahner (5 March 1904 – 30 March 1984) was a German Jesuit priest and theologian who, alongside Henri de Lubac, Hans Urs von Balthasar, and Yves Congar, is considered to be one of the most influential Catholic theologians of the 20th century. He was the brother of Hugo Rahner, also a Jesuit scholar.

Before the Second Vatican Council, Rahner worked alongside Yves Congar, Henri de Lubac, and Marie-Dominique Chenu, theologians associated with the emerging school of theological thought known as Nouvelle théologie. The Council was influenced by Rahner&#x27;s theology and his understanding of Catholic faith.

==Biography==
Karl Rahner&#x27;s parents, Karl and Luise (née Trescher) Rahner, had seven children, of whom Karl was the fourth. His father was a professor in a local college and his mother had a profound religious personality, which influenced the home atmosphere. Karl attended primary and secondary school in Freiburg, entering the Society of Jesus upon graduation; he began his Jesuit formation in the North German Province of the Jesuits in 1922, four years after his older brother Hugo entered the same order. Deeply affected by the spirituality of Ignatius of Loyola during the initial phase of his formation (1922–24), he concentrated the next phase of his formation (1924–7) on Catholic scholastic philosophy and the modern German philosophers: he seems to have been particularly interested in Immanuel Kant and two contemporary Thomists, the Belgian Jesuit Joseph Maréchal and the French Jesuit Pierre Rousselot, who were to influence Rahner&#x27;s understanding of Thomas Aquinas in his later writings.

As a part of his Jesuit training, Rahner taught Latin to novices at Feldkirch (1927–29), then began his theological studies at the Jesuit theologate in Valkenburg aan de Geul in 1929. This allowed him to develop a thorough understanding of patristic theology, also developing interests in spiritual theology, mysticism, and the history of piety. Rahner was ordained a priest on 26 July 1932, and then made his final year of tertianship, the study and taking of Ignatius&#x27; Spiritual Exercises, at St. Andrä in Austria&#x27;s Lavanttal Valley.

Because Rahner&#x27;s superiors wished him to teach philosophy at Pullach, he returned home to Freiburg in 1934 to study for a doctorate in philosophy, delving more deeply into the philosophy of Kant and Maréchal, and attended seminars by Martin Heidegger. His philosophy dissertation &quot;Geist in Welt&quot;, an interpretation of Aquinas&#x27;s epistemology influenced by the transcendental Thomism of Maréchal and the existentialism of Heidegger, was ultimately rejected by his mentor Martin Honecker, allegedly for its bias toward Heidegger&#x27;s philosophy and not sufficiently expressing the Catholic neo-scholastic tradition. In 1936 Rahner was sent to Innsbruck to continue his theological studies and there he completed his habilitation. Soon after he was appointed a &quot;Privatdozent&quot; (lecturer) in the faculty of theology of the University of Innsbruck, in July 1937. In 1939 the Nazis took over the university and Rahner, while staying in Austria, was invited to Vienna to work in the Pastoral Institute, where he both taught and became active in pastoral work until 1949. He then returned to the theology faculty at Innsbruck and taught on a variety of topics which later became the essays published in &quot;Schriften zur Theologie ()&quot;: the collection is not a systematic presentation of Rahner&#x27;s views, but, rather a diverse series of essays on theological matters characterised by his probing, questioning search for truth.
In early 1962, with no prior warning, Rahner&#x27;s superiors in the Society of Jesus told him that he was under Rome&#x27;s pre-censorship, which meant that he could not publish or lecture without advance permission. The objections of the Roman authorities focused mainly on Rahner&#x27;s views on the Eucharist and Mariology; however, the practical import of the pre-censorship decision was voided in November 1962 when, without any objection, John XXIII appointed Rahner a &quot;peritus&quot; (expert advisor) to the Second Vatican Council: Rahner had complete access to the council and numerous opportunities to share his thoughts with the participants. Rahner&#x27;s influence at Vatican II was thus widespread, and he was subsequently chosen as one of seven theologians who would develop &quot;Lumen gentium&quot;, the dogmatic explication of the doctrine of the Church. The council&#x27;s receptiveness towards other religious traditions may be linked to Rahner&#x27;s notions of the renovation of the church, God&#x27;s universal salvific revelation, and his desire to support and encourage the ecumenical movement.

During the council, Rahner accepted the chair for Christianity and the Philosophy of Religion at the University of Munich and taught there from 1964 to 1967. Subsequently, he was appointed to a chair in dogmatic theology at the Catholic theological faculty of the University of Münster, where he stayed until his retirement in 1971. Rahner then moved to Munich and in 1981 to Innsbruck, where he remained for the next 3 years as an active writer and lecturer, also continuing his active pastoral ministry. He published several volumes (23 total in English) of collected essays for the &quot;Schriften zur Theologie (Theological Investigations)&quot;, expanded the &quot;Kleines theologisches Wörterbuch (Theological Dictionary)&quot;, co-authored other texts such as &quot;Unity of the Churches: An Actual Possibility&quot; with Heinrich Fries, and in 1976 he completed the long-promised systematic work, &quot;Foundations of Christian Faith&quot;.

Rahner fell ill from exhaustion and died on 30 March 1984 at the age of 80, after a birthday celebration that also honoured his scholarship. He was buried at the in Innsbruck. During his years of philosophical and theological study and teaching, Rahner produced some 4,000 written works.

==Work==

Rahner&#x27;s output is extraordinarily voluminous. In addition to the above-mentioned writings, his other major works include: the ten-volume encyclopaedia, &quot;Lexicon für Theologie und Kirche&quot;; a six-volume theological encyclopaedia, &quot;Sacramentum Mundi&quot;, and many other books, essays, and articles. In addition to his own work, the reference texts that Rahner edited also added significantly to the general impact of his own theological views.

The basis for Rahner&#x27;s theology is that all human beings have a latent (&quot;unthematic&quot;) experience of God in any perception of meaning or &quot;transcendental experience&quot;. It is only because of this proto-revelation that recognising a distinctively special revelation (such as the Christian Gospel) is possible. His theology influenced the Second Vatican Council and was ground-breaking for the development of what is generally seen as the modern understanding of Catholicism. Until the early 2000s his thought also shaped Catholic theology in the United States. A popular anecdote, that resonates with those who find some of Karl Rahner&#x27;s works difficult reading, comes from his brother Hugo who quipped that in his retirement he&#x27;d try to &quot;translate his brother&#x27;s works ... into German!&quot;

===&quot;Foundations of Christian Faith&quot;===
Written near the end of his life, Rahner&#x27;s &quot;Foundations of Christian Faith&quot; (&quot;Grundkurs des Glaubens&quot;) is the most developed and systematic of his works, most of which were published in the form of essays.

===Economic and immanent Trinity===
Among the most important of his essays was &quot;The Trinity&quot;, in which he argues that &quot;the economic Trinity is the immanent Trinity, and the immanent Trinity is the economic Trinity&quot; (sometimes called &#x27;Rahner&#x27;s rule&#x27;). That is to say, God communicates Himself to humanity (&quot;economic&quot; Trinity) as He really is in the divine Life (&quot;immanent&quot; Trinity).

Rahner was emphatic that the identity between &quot;economic&quot; Trinity and &quot;immanent&quot; Trinity does not lead to Modalism, because God could not communicate Himself to humanity as threefold () unless He were threefold in reality. Nonetheless, some theologians and Christian philosophers (e.g., Jürgen Moltmann) have found his teaching to tend strongly in a Modalist direction.

===God&#x27;s self-communication===
Rahner maintained that the fulfillment of human existence consists in receiving God&#x27;s self-communication, and that the human being is actually &quot;constituted&quot; by this divine self-communication. He identifies grace with the self-communication of God. In this vein, he writes: 

===Transfinalization===

Rahner was a critic of substance theory and was concerned about the finality of liturgy. He proposed instead to rename transubstantiation into &quot;transfinalization&quot;. John Hardon defined &quot;transfinalization&quot; as: 

Pope Paul VI in the encyclical &quot;Mysterium fidei&quot;, mentioning the term &#x27;transfinalization&#x27; one time, without citing Rahner&#x27;s name, stated:
Haldon states that in &quot;Mysterium fidei&quot; Pope Paul VI &quot;condemned&quot; the notion of &quot;transfinalization&quot;, which was one of the &quot;principal errors about the Real Presence that were already current in his day&quot;.

===Awareness of God===
The basis for Rahner&#x27;s theology is that all human beings have a latent (&quot;unthematic&quot;) awareness of God in any experiences of limitation in knowledge or freedom as finite subjects. Because such experience is the &quot;condition of possibility&quot; for knowledge and freedom as such, Rahner borrows the language of Kant to describe this experience as &quot;transcendental&quot;. This transcendental experiential factor reveals his closeness to Maréchal&#x27;s transcendental Thomism.

Such is the extent of Rahner&#x27;s idea of the &quot;natural knowledge of God&quot;—what can be known by reason prior to the advent of &quot;special&quot; revelation—that God is only approached asymptotically, in the mode of what Rahner calls &quot;absolute mystery&quot;. While one may try to furnish proofs for God&#x27;s existence, these explicit proofs ultimately refer to the inescapable orientation towards mystery which constitute—by transcendental necessity—the very nature of the human being.

====God as Absolute Mystery====
Rahner often prefers the term &quot;mystery&quot; to that of &quot;God&quot;. He identifies the God of Absolute Being as Absolute Mystery. At best, philosophy approaches God only asymptotically, evoking the question whether attempts to know God are in vain. Can the line between the human asymptote and the Mystery asymptote connect?

In Rahner&#x27;s theology, the Absolute Mystery reveals himself in self-communication. Revelation, however, does not resolve the Mystery; it increases cognizance of God&#x27;s incomprehensibility. Experiences of the mystery of themselves point people to the Absolute Mystery, &quot;an always-ever-greater Mystery.&quot; Even in heaven, God will still be an incomprehensible mystery.

===&quot;Homanisation&quot; and Incarnation===
Rahner examines evolution in his work &quot;Homanisation&quot; (1958, rev. 1965). The title represents a term he coined, deriving it from &quot;hominization&quot;, the theory of man&#x27;s evolutionary origins. The book&#x27;s preface describes the limits of Catholic theology with respect to evolution, further on giving a summary of official church teaching on the theory. He then continues in the next sections to propound &quot;fundamental theology&quot; in order to elucidate the background or foundation of church teaching. In the third section he raises some philosophical and theological questions relating to the concept of becoming, the concept of cause, the distinction between spirit and matter, the unity of spirit and matter, the concept of operation, and the creation of the spiritual soul. In his writing, Rahner does not simply deal with the origin of man but with his existence and his future, issues that can be of some concern to evolutionary theory. Central for Rahner is the theological doctrine of grace, which for Rahner is a constituent element of man&#x27;s existence, so that grace is a permanent modification of human nature in a supernatural &quot;existential&quot;, to use a Heidegger term. Accordingly, Rahner doubts the real possibility of a state of pure nature (&quot;natura pura&quot;), which is human existence without being involved with grace. In treating the present existence of man and his future as human, Rahner affirms that &quot;the fulfillment of human existence occurs in receiving God&#x27;s gift of Himself, not only in the beatific vision at the end of time, but present now as seed in grace.&quot;

====Multiple Incarnations====

Rahner has been open to the prospect of extraterrestrial intelligence, the idea that cosmic evolution has yielded sentient life forms in other galaxies. Logically, this raises for Rahner some important questions of philosophical, ethical, and theological significance: he argues against any theological prohibition of the notion of extraterrestrial life, while separating the existential significance of such life forms from that of angels. Moreover, Rahner advances the possibility of multiple Incarnations, but does not delve into it: given the strong Christological orientation of his theology, it does not appear likely he would have propended for repetitions of the Incarnation of Christ.

===Incarnation-grace===
For Rahner, at the heart of Christian doctrine is the co-reality of incarnation-grace. Incarnation and grace appear as technical terms to describe the central message of the Gospel: God has communicated Himself. The self-communication of God is crucial in view: grace is not something other than God, not some celestial &#x27;substance,&#x27; but God Himself. The event of Jesus Christ is, according to Rahner, the centre-point of the self-communication of God. God, insists Rahner, does not only communicate Himself from &quot;without&quot;; rather, grace is the constitutive element both of the objective reality of revelation (the incarnate Word) and the subjective principle of our hearing (the internal Word and the Holy Spirit). To capture the relation between these aspects of grace, Rahner appropriates the Heideggerian terminology of &quot;thematization:&quot; the objective mediation is the explicit &quot;thematization&quot; of what is &quot;always already&quot; subjectively proffered – the history of grace&#x27;s categorical expression &quot;without,&quot; culminating in the event of Jesus Christ, is the manifestation of what is &quot;always already&quot; on offer through the supernatural existential, which enters amid a transcendental horizon &quot;within&quot;.

===Mode of grace===
Rahner&#x27;s particular interpretation of the mode in which grace makes itself present is that grace is a permanent modification of human nature in a supernatural existential (a phrase borrowed from Heidegger). Grace is perceived in light of Christianity as a constitutive element of human existence. For this reason, Rahner denies the possibility of a state of pure nature (&quot;natura pura&quot;, human existence without being-involved with grace), which according to him is a counterfactual.

===Language about God: univocity and equivocation===
Like others of his generation, Rahner was much concerned with refuting the propositional approach to theology typical of the Counter-Reformation. The alternative he proposes is one where statements about God are always referring back to the original experience of God in mystery. In this sense, language regarding being is analogically predicated of the mystery, inasmuch as the mystery is always present but not in the same way as any determinate possible object of consciousness. Rahner would claim Thomas Aquinas as the most important influence on his thought, but also spoke highly of Heidegger as &quot;my teacher&quot;, and in his elder years Heidegger used to visit Rahner regularly in Freiburg.

Some have noted that the analogy of being is greatly diminished in Rahner&#x27;s thought. Instead, they claim, equivocal predication dominates much of Rahner&#x27;s language about God. In this respect, similarity between him and other Thomist-inspired theologians is seen as problematic. Others, however, identify Rahner&#x27;s primary influence not in Heidegger but in the Neo-Thomists of the early 20th century, especially the writings of Joseph Maréchal.

===Criticism of Jesusism===
Rahner criticised Jesusism, despite his stated respect for the position. Jesusism tends to focus narrowly on Jesus&#x27; life for imitation, apart from the Christian God or Church.

===Christology===
If the task of Christology is to make intelligible the Christian faith that Jesus of Nazareth, a historical person, is Christ as the centre of all human history and the final and full revelation of God to humanity—then Rahner feels that within &quot;the contemporary mentality which sees the world from an evolutionary point of view&quot; the person of Christ should not be emphasised in his unique individuality whilst ignoring any possibility of combining the event of Christ with the process of human history as a whole. In fact, it appears there are some limitations of classic Christological formula suggested by the Council of Chalcedon (AD 451) which affirms &quot;one identical Son, our Lord Jesus Christ ... perfect both in his divinity and in his humanity ... [with] two natures without any commingling or change or division or separation ... united in one person.&quot; Moreover, the Chalcedon formula adopts philosophical concepts such as &quot;nature&quot; and &quot;hypostatic union&quot; which are no longer used to explain and interpret religious experiences.
Thus, Rahner introduces &quot;transcendental Christology&quot;, which interprets the event and person of Christ in relation to the essential structure of the human person, reflecting on the essential conditions of all human experiences, conditions which transcend any one particular kind of experience. One should however first look into Rahner&#x27;s basic insights on Christology within an evolutionary view of the world, which claims that Christian faith sees all things in the world come from the one same origin, God. This means that in spite of their differences, there is &quot;an inner similarity and commonality&quot; among things, which forms a single world. This commonality is most clearly disclosed in a human being as a form of the unity of spirit and matter: it is only in a human person that spirit and matter can be experienced in their real essence and in their unity. Rahner states that &quot;spirit&quot; represents the unique mode of existence of a single person when that person becomes self-conscious and is always oriented towards the incomprehensible Mystery called God. However, it is only in the free acceptance by the subject of this mystery and in its unpredictable disposal of the subject that the person can genuinely undertake this process of returning to the self. Conversely, &quot;matter&quot; is the condition which makes human beings estranged from themselves towards other objects in the world and makes possible an immediate intercommunication with other spiritual creatures in time and space. Even if there is an essential difference between spirit and matter, that is not understood as an essential opposition: the relationship between the two can be said as &quot;the intrinsic nature of matter to develop towards spirit&quot;. This kind of becoming from matter to spirit can be called &quot;self-transcendence&quot; which &quot;can be only understood as taking place by the power of the absolute fullness of being&quot;: the evolutionary view of the world allows us to consider that humanity is nothing but the latest stage of the self-transcendence of matter.

====Christian faith and God&#x27;s self-communication====
According to Rahner, Christian faith affirms that the cosmos reaches its final fulfillment when it receives the immediate self-communication of its own ground in the spiritual creatures which are its goal and its high point. Rahner further states that God&#x27;s self-communication to the world is the final goal of the world and that the process of self-transcendence makes the world already directed towards this self-communication and its acceptance by the world. As a consequence, and explaining the place of Christ in this whole process of self-transcendence of the world, Rahner says that it has to do with the process of the intercommunication of spiritual subjects, because otherwise there is no way to retain the unity of the very process. God&#x27;s self-communication is given to cosmic subjects who have freedom to accept or reject it and who have intercommunication with other existents. It takes place only if the subjects freely accept it, and only then forms a &quot;common&quot; history in a sense that &quot;it is addressed to all men in their intercommunication&quot; then &quot;addressed to others as a call to their freedom&quot;. In this sense, Rahner claims that &quot;God&#x27;s self-communication must have a &quot;permanent beginning&quot; and in this beginning a guarantee that it has taken place, a guarantee by which it can rightly demand a free decision to accept this divine self-communication.&quot; Within this scheme, the &quot;saviour&quot; refers to a historical person &quot;who signifies the beginning of the absolute self-communication of God which is moving towards its goal, that beginning which indicates that this self-communication for everyone has taken place irrevocably and has been victoriously inaugurated.&quot; &quot;Hypostatic union&quot;, therefore, happens in an intrinsic moment when God&#x27;s self-communication and its acceptance by that person are met, and this union is open to all spiritual creatures with the bestowal of grace. In order to be fulfilled, this event should have &quot;a concrete tangibility in history&quot;.

====Transcendental Christology and mediation====
If one then examines Rahner&#x27;s &quot;transcendental Christology&quot;, it may be seen that it &quot;presupposes an understanding of the relationship of &quot;mutual&quot; conditioning and mediation in human existence between what is transcendentally necessary and what is concretely and contingently historical.&quot; It is a sort of relationship between the two elements in such a way that &quot;the transcendental element is always an intrinsic condition of the historical element in the historical self&quot; while &quot;in spite of its being freely posited, the historical element co-determines existence in an absolute sense.&quot; Transcendental Christology is &quot;the experiences which man always and inescapably has.&quot; Human beings were created to freely transcend themselves and the objects in the world, towards the incomprehensible Mystery called God; the limitations of human situation make a human being hope that the full meaning of humanity and the unity of everything in the world will be fulfilled by God&#x27;s self-giving. Furthermore, God&#x27;s self-communication and human hope for it should be &quot;mediated historically&quot; because of &quot;the unity of transcendentality and historicity in human existence&quot;: human hope looks in history for its salvation from God that &quot;becomes final and irreversible, and is the end in an &#x27;eschatological&#x27; sense.&quot; At this point Rahner proposes two possibilities of human salvation, i.e. either as &quot;fulfillment in an absolute sense&quot; which means the establishment of the Kingdom of God on earth, or as &quot;a historical event within history&quot;. The event of human salvation by God&#x27;s self-giving love should be the event of a human person, because God&#x27;s salvific love can only be effective in history when a person &quot;freely&quot; accepts his love, surrenders everything to God in death, and in death is accepted by God. Rahner significantly affirms that the character of the saviour is exemplary and absolute: given the unity of the world and of history from the view point of both God and the world, such an &quot;individual&quot; destiny has &quot;exemplary&quot; significance for the world as a whole. Such a man with this destiny is what is meant by an &quot;absolute saviour&quot;.

====Saviour and hypostatic union====
Rahner believes that the saviour described by his &quot;transcendental Christology&quot; is not diverse from the one presented by the classic Christological formulations of Chalcedon, which used a concept of &quot;hypostatic union&quot; to claim Jesus as the Christ. Accordingly, he then proceeds to articulate the meaning of the &quot;hypostatic union&quot;. The issue is how to understand the meaning of &quot;human being&quot;: Rahner understands the phrase &quot;became man&quot; as assuming an individual human &quot;nature&quot; as God&#x27;s own, and emphasises &quot;the self-emptying of God, his becoming, the kenosis and genesis of God himself.&quot; God &quot;assumes by creating&quot; and also &quot;creates by assuming&quot;, that is, he creates by emptying himself, and therefore, of course, he himself is in the emptying. He creates the human reality by the very fact that he assumes it as his own. God&#x27;s creating-by-emptying act belongs to God&#x27;s power and freedom as the absolute one and to God&#x27;s self-giving love expressed in Scripture. Therefore, it is legitimate for Rahner to assert that God &quot;who is not subject to change in himself can &quot;himself&quot; be subject to change in &quot;something&quot; else.&quot; This is what the doctrine of the Incarnation teaches us: &quot;in and in spite of his immutability he can truly become something: he himself, he in time.&quot;

According to Rahner, human beings are created to be oriented towards the incomprehensible Mystery called God. However, this human orientation towards the Mystery can be fully grasped only if we as humans freely choose to be grasped by the incomprehensible one: if God assumes human nature as God&#x27;s own reality with God&#x27;s irrevocable offer of God&#x27;s self-communication, and a person &quot;freely&quot; accepts it, the person is united with God, reaching the very point towards which humanity is always moving by virtue of its essence, a God-Man which is fully fulfilled in the person of Jesus of Nazareth claimed by Christian faith. In this sense, Rahner sees the incarnation of God as &quot;the unique and highest instance of the actualization of the essence of human reality&quot;.

====God-Man in history====
To answer the question of how we find a God-Man in history, Rahner employs a historical approach to Christology by examining the history of the life and death of Jesus of Nazareth and proposes two theses beforehand: 1) Christian faith requires a historical basis; and 2) considering a possibility of significant difference between who the person is and the extent to which that person verbalises or expresses identity, it is possible both to say that &quot;the self-understanding of the pre-resurrection Jesus may not contradict in an historical sense the Christian understanding of his person and his salvific significance&quot;, and to state that his self-understanding may not coincide with the content of Christological faith.

To establish the grounds of Christian faith, Rahner asserts that two points should be proven as historically credible—first, that Jesus saw himself &quot;as the eschatological prophet, as the absolute and definitive saviour&quot;, and second, that the resurrection of Jesus is the absolute self-communication of God. There are several historical elements concerning Jesus&#x27; identity as a Jew and &quot;radical reformer&quot;: his drastic behaviour in solidarity with social and religious outcasts based on his belief in God, his essential preaching &quot;as a call to conversion&quot;, his gathering disciples, his hope for conversions of others, his acceptance of death on the cross &quot;as the inevitable consequence of fidelity to his mission&quot;.

====Death and resurrection====
Rahner states that the death and the resurrection of Jesus are two aspects of a single event not to be separated, even though the resurrection is not a historical event in time and place like the death of Jesus. What the Scripture offers are powerful encounters in which the disciples come to experience the &quot;spirit&quot; of the risen Lord Jesus among them, provoking a resurrection faith of the disciples as &quot;a unique fact&quot;. The resurrection is not a return to life in the temporal sphere, but the seal of God the Father upon all that Jesus stood for and preached in his pre-Easter life. &quot;By the resurrection... Jesus is vindicated as the absolute saviour&quot; by God: it means &quot;this death as entered into in free obedience and as surrendering life completely to God, reaches fulfillment and becomes historically tangible for us only in the resurrection.&quot; Thus, in the resurrection, the life and death of Jesus are understood as &quot;the cause of God&#x27;s salvific will&quot; and open the door to our salvation: &quot;we are saved because this man who is one of us has been saved by God, and God has thereby made his salvific will present in the world historically, really and irrevocably.&quot; In this sense, Jesus of Nazareth becomes a God-Man, the absolute saviour.

===Anonymous Christianity===
Anonymous Christianity is the theological concept that declares that people who have never heard the Christian Gospel might be saved through Christ.

Inspiration for this idea sometimes comes from the Second Vatican Council&#x27;s &quot;Lumen gentium&quot;, which teaches that those &quot;who through no fault of their own do not know the Gospel of Christ or His Church, but who nevertheless seek God with a sincere heart, and moved by grace, try in their actions to do His will as they know it through the dictates of their conscience—those too may achieve eternal salvation.&quot;

Rahner&#x27;s development of the idea preceded the council, and became more insistent after it received its conciliar formulation. Non-Christians could have &quot;in [their] basic orientation and fundamental decision&quot;, Rahner wrote, &quot;accepted the salvific grace of God, through Christ, although [they] may never have heard of the Christian revelation.&quot; His writings on the subject were somewhat related to his views about the mode of grace.

===Non-Christian religions===
Rahner&#x27;s &quot;transcendental Christology&quot; opens another horizon which comprises non-Christian religions, as God&#x27;s universal saving will in Christ extends to non-Christians: since Christ is the saviour of all people, salvation for non-Christians comes only through Christ (anonymous Christians). Just as importantly, it is possible to say that Christians can learn from other religions or atheistic humanism because God&#x27;s grace is and can be operative in them. The presence of Christ in other religions operates in and through his Spirit and non-Christians respond to the grace of God through &quot;the unreflexive and &#x27;searching Christology (searching &quot;memory&quot; of the absolute saviour) present in the hearts of all persons. Three specific attitudes become involved: 1) an absolute love towards one&#x27;s neighbours; 2) an attitude of readiness for death; and 3) an attitude of hope for the future. In practising these, the person is acting from and responding to the grace of God that was fully manifest in the life of Jesus.

<text>Siegfried Alkan (30 March 1858 – 24 December 1941) was a German composer.

Alkan was born in Dillingen, Saarland (then Prussia, now Germany), the son of Johannes Alkan and Johanna Bonn in a family of merchants and musicians. Through his mother he was a distant cousin of the composers Felix Mendelssohn Bartholdy, Fanny Hensel and Giacomo Meyerbeer. It is unknown whether he was related to the French composer and pianist Charles-Valentin Alkan, but like the latter, he was a scion of Jewish families from the Moselle region.

In 1938 the octogenarian Siegfried Alkan became a victim of the &quot;Kristallnacht&quot;. His instruments were destroyed and he himself was beaten by Nazi hordes. In his last years he was forced to wear the yellow star.

Many works of Siegfried Alkan seem to be lost. Still known are for example the compositions &quot;Gruß an die Saar&quot; (Op. 32), &quot;O wüsstest du&#x27;s&quot; (Op. 39), &quot;Neues Saarlied&quot; (Op. 91) and &quot;Ur-Großmütterchen&quot; (Op. 80), which was very popular in the time after World War I.

<text>Modern social round dance, or round dancing, is a choreographed and cued ballroom dance that progresses in a circular counter-clockwise pattern around the dance floor. The two major categories of ballroom dances found in round dancing are the smooth and international ballroom styles (such as foxtrot and waltz) and the Latin dances (such as cha-cha-chá, salsa, and rhumba). It is not to be confused with circle dancing, which is a type of folk dance in which dancers are connected in a circular chain.

== Description ==
Round dancing differs from free-style ballroom dancing in that each round dance has been fully choreographed ahead of time, and a &quot;cuer&quot; or leader at the front of the ballroom tells the dancers, as they dance, what steps to do. As the music plays, and just ahead of the beat, so the dancers have time to respond, the cuer names each dance figure in the choreography. As a consequence, all the dancers on the floor are dancing the same steps at the same time.

To create a round dance, a piece of music is selected by the choreographer, and the different steps or figures are chosen to fit the music. If the music swells and pauses briefly, then a dance step that rises and stretches is put into that place. If there is a little syncopation in another part of the music, then a quick step is inserted. The creation of a piece of choreography is like engineering a machine, with every gear and lever in just the right place to give smooth and flowing motion. The step-by-step instructions on how to dance this choreography are written out in what is called a cue sheet.

==Types==
Examples of social dances that may be danced in &quot;round&quot; fashion are bolero, cha-cha-cha, foxtrot, hustle, jive, mambo, merengue, paso doble, quickstep, rhumba, salsa, samba, single swing, slow two step, tango, two step, waltz, Viennese waltz and West Coast swing.

Roundalab, the International Association of Round Dance Teachers, Inc., has established a &quot;Phase Rating System&quot; of round dancing, in order to rate round dance figures according to difficulty and complexity.

Salsa rueda, also referred to as casino de rueda, is a kind of round dance in which there is no complete pre-choreographed sequence, and the dance patterns are called out in a random order.

<doc id="370461" wikidata="Q1639522" url="?curid=370461" title="Manchester and Birmingham Railway">
<text>The Manchester and Birmingham Railway was built between Manchester and Crewe and opened in stages from 1840. Between Crewe and Birmingham, trains were worked by the Grand Junction Railway. The M&amp;BR was merged into the London and North Western Railway in 1846.

==History==

===Plans===
After the building of the Grand Junction Railway and the Liverpool and Manchester Railway, investors began to look for other routes south of Manchester. From 1835, the GJR was considering a branch to the Potteries, while the Manchester and Cheshire Junction Railway was planning a line from Manchester to Crewe with branches outwards. Meanwhile, George Stephenson was investigating a line from Manchester and Stockport to the Potteries, which developed into a proposal for a &quot;Manchester South Union Railway&quot;. Also involved were proposals for competing lines through the Trent valley to Rugby.
After two years of proposals and counter-proposals, what emerged was a scheme to run from a junction from the GJR at Chebsey, with branches to Macclesfield and Crewe, into Manchester Store Street, which received an act of Parliament, the (7 Will. 4 &amp; 1 Vict. c. lxix) authorising it in 1837. There were plans to take the line to Rugby, but for a number of reasons, including lack of finance, they were put in abeyance.

===Opening===
A section between Heaton Norris and a temporary station at Travis Street in Manchester was opened first in 1840 carrying nearly two thousand passengers in the first twenty weeks. However, there still remained to be built an enormous 22 arch viaduct over the River Mersey at Stockport. In 1841 the Sheffield, Ashton-under-Lyne and Manchester Railway, which was to share Store Street, also began running into Travis Street. Store Street finally opened in 1842 and later became known as London Road (it became Piccadilly in 1960). Services were extended to Sandbach but entry to Crewe, where it would use GJR metals to Birmingham, proved more difficult. In the end it was agreed that the GJR would work the trains south of Crewe, while the M&amp;B would work them into Manchester.

Enough locomotives, all 2-2-2, had been ordered from Robert Stephenson and Company and Sharp, Roberts and Company to work the whole distance, but John Ramsbottom, their Locomotive Superintendent, managed to sell four of them on to the South Eastern Railway. Although the company&#x27;s finances remained weak, it built a number of short branches, and, although a minor player, its position made it a crucial part in revived plans for the Trent and Churnet valleys, which involved the London and Birmingham Railway with which they would compete.

===Merger===
Eventually the complex relationship between the M&amp;BR, the GJR and the L&amp;BR was resolved by their merger in 1846 to form the London and North Western Railway. The long-awaited Trent Valley Railway opened in 1847. The Manchester and Birmingham had put other plans forward, including a line from Rugby to the Midland Railway at Syston near Leicester, authorised in 1846 and the Coventry and Nuneaton Railway. Also in 1846 the Manchester, Buxton, Matlock and Midlands Junction Railway had been authorised, supported strongly by the M&amp;BR and the Midland, joining the latter&#x27;s line to London. In the event it only reached Rowsley due to financial difficulties, but the merger was a considerable embarrassment to the Midland, since the LNWR was naturally opposed to a competing line to the capital.

==Locomotives of the M&amp;BR==

The M&amp;BR&#x27;s locomotive works was at Longsight railway station.

==Prestbury Tunnel==
The Prestbury Tunnel was constructed in 1845 by George W. Buck for the Manchester and Birmingham Railway. The south entrance arch is made from ashlar buff sandstone, and is Grade II listed. The arch stands proud of the rubble supporting walls, and is decorated with a modillion cornice. The north entrance arch is in brick and of a simpler design. The keystone of the northern arch has the 1845 date, and the company&#x27;s initials.

<doc id="370462" wikidata="Q314587" url="?curid=370462" title="Esa-Pekka Salonen">
<text>Esa-Pekka Salonen (; born 30 June 1958) is a Finnish conductor and composer. He is the music director of the San Francisco Symphony and conductor laureate of the Los Angeles Philharmonic, Philharmonia Orchestra in London and the Swedish Radio Symphony Orchestra. In 2024, he announced his resignation from the San Francisco Symphony upon the expiration of his contract in 2025.

==Life and career==

===Early work===
Born in Helsinki, Finland, Salonen graduated from Helsingin Suomalainen Yhteiskoulu (SYK), one of the top high schools in Finland, in 1977 and then went to study horn and composition at the Sibelius Academy in Helsinki, as well as conducting with Jorma Panula. His conducting classmates included Jukka-Pekka Saraste and Osmo Vänskä.
Another classmate on the composition side was the composer Magnus Lindberg and together they formed the new-music appreciation group Korvat auki (&quot;Ears open&quot; in the Finnish language) and the experimental ensemble Toimii (lit. &quot;It works&quot;). Later, Salonen studied with the composers Franco Donatoni, Niccolò Castiglioni, and Einojuhani Rautavaara.

His first experience with conducting came in 1979 with the Finnish Radio Symphony Orchestra, though he still thought of himself principally as a composer; in fact, Salonen has said that he took up conducting primarily to ensure that someone would conduct his own compositions. In 1983, however, he replaced an indisposed Michael Tilson Thomas to conduct a performance of Mahler&#x27;s &quot;Symphony No. 3&quot; with the Philharmonia Orchestra in London on very short notice, without ever having studied the score, and it launched his career as a conductor. He was subsequently principal guest conductor of the Philharmonia from 1985 to 1994.

Salonen was principal conductor of the Swedish Radio Symphony Orchestra from 1984 to 1995. He co-founded the Baltic Sea Festival in 2003 with and Valery Gergiev. This summer music festival presents new classical music and aims to bring the countries around the Baltic Sea together and to raise awareness of environmental deterioration of the Baltic. It continues to be held annually in one of the region&#x27;s countries.

===Los Angeles Philharmonic===
Salonen made his conducting debut in the United States with the Los Angeles Philharmonic in 1984. He said:

In 1989, he was offered the title of Principal Guest Conductor by Executive VP Ernest Fleischmann and was to take the orchestra on a tour of Japan; however, controversy ensued when André Previn, the orchestra&#x27;s music director at the time, was not consulted on either the Principal Guest appointment or the tour, and objected to both. Continued friction between Fleischmann and Previn led to Previn&#x27;s resignation in April 1989. Four months later, Salonen was named the orchestra&#x27;s tenth music director, officially taking the post in 1992 and holding it until 2009.

Salonen&#x27;s tenure with the orchestra began with a residency at the 1992 Salzburg Festival in concert performances and as the pit orchestra in a production of the opera &quot;Saint François d&#x27;Assise&quot; by Olivier Messiaen; it was the first time an American orchestra was given that opportunity. Salonen later took the orchestra on many other tours of the United States, Europe, and Asia, and residencies at the Lucerne Festival in Switzerland, The Proms in London, in Cologne for a festival of Salonen&#x27;s own works, and in 1996 at the Théâtre du Châtelet in Paris for a Stravinsky festival conducted by Salonen and Pierre Boulez; it was during this Paris residency that key Philharmonic board members heard the orchestra perform in improved acoustics and were re-invigorated to lead fundraising efforts to complete construction of Walt Disney Concert Hall.

Under Salonen&#x27;s leadership, the Philharmonic became an extremely progressive and well-regarded orchestra. Alex Ross of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; said this:

In 2007, Salonen and the orchestra announced the conclusion of his music directorship in 2009, with Gustavo Dudamel taking his place.

Before Salonen&#x27;s last concert as Music Director of the Los Angeles Philharmonic on 19 April 2009, the orchestra announced his appointment as its first Conductor Laureate. In addition, the LA Philharmonic created the Esa-Pekka Salonen Commissions Fund &quot;for the express purpose of supporting the commissioning and performance of new works&quot; as a way to honor his support of contemporary classical music during his tenure as music director. At its inception, it was endowed with $1.5 million.

During Salonen&#x27;s tenure as music director, the orchestra gave 120 pieces their world or American debuts and commissioned over 54 new works. By the time he stepped down, he had served as music director longer than anyone else in the orchestra&#x27;s history, leading the orchestra in 973 concerts and 23 tours.

===Philharmonia and subsequent career===
In November 2006, the Philharmonia Orchestra announced the appointment of Salonen as Principal Conductor and Artistic Advisor at the beginning of the 2008–2009 season. His initial contract was for 3 years. Salonen has conducted several commercial recordings with the Philharmonia, including music of Berlioz and Schönberg. In November 2010, the Philharmonia announced the extension of Salonen&#x27;s contract to 2014. In September 2013 the orchestra announced the further extension of Salonen&#x27;s contract through the 2016–2017 season. In December 2018 the Philharmonia announced that Salonen would conclude his principal conductorship of the orchestra after the 2020–2021 season.

Salonen made his Metropolitan Opera conducting debut in November 2009 with the Patrice Chéreau production of Leoš Janáček&#x27;s &quot;From the House of the Dead&quot;.

In 2012 his violin concerto written for Leila Josefowicz won the Grawemeyer Award for Music Composition. In March 2014 he was awarded the Michael Ludwig Nemmers Prize in Musical Composition by the Henry and Leigh Bienen School of Music at Northwestern University. The award includes a $100,000 cash prize, a residency of four nonconsecutive weeks at the school over the next two years, and a performance by the Chicago Symphony Orchestra. In the same spring he was also awarded the first creative chair at the Tonhalle Orchester Zürich for the 2014–2015 season. This post included lectures, workshops, but, most significantly, the commissioning of &quot;Karawane&quot;, a new piece for orchestra and chorus based on Hugo Ball&#x27;s dada poetry and the performance of nine other Salonen pieces throughout the season.

In autumn 2015 Salonen began a three-season appointment as composer-in-residence of the New York Philharmonic. He serves as an advisor to The Sync Project, a global collaboration seeking to understand and harness music&#x27;s effect on brain health. In August 2016 Salonen was named the first artist in association with the Finnish National Opera and Ballet.

Salonen first guest-conducted the San Francisco Symphony (SFS) in 2004. He returned for guest-conducting appearances in 2012 and 2015. In December 2018 the SFS announced the appointment of Salonen as its next music director, effective with the 2020–2021 season, with an initial contract of five seasons.

In March 2024, Salonen announced that he would be leaving the San Francisco Symphony when his contract expires in 2025, stating that &quot;I do not share the same goals for the future of the institution as the Board of Governors does.&quot; Some SFS patrons expressed support for Salonen and displeasure with the board&#x27;s direction.

===Digital projects===
Salonen and the Philharmonia Orchestra have worked on multi-disciplinary festivals together, including &quot;Woven Words: Music begins where words end&quot; to celebrate the centenary of the birth of Witold Lutosławski, Salonen&#x27;s mentor. They also created the award-winning RE-RITE installation, which was first exhibited in London in 2009 and has since travelled to Portugal, China, Turkey, Germany, and Austria. The digital residency allows members of the public to conduct, play and step inside the Philharmonia Orchestra with Salonen through audio and video projections of musicians performing &quot;The Rite of Spring&quot;. They followed-up with another installation, &quot;Universe of Sound&quot;, which was based on Gustav Holst&#x27;s &quot;The Planets&quot;, debuted at London&#x27;s Science Museum, and won the 2012 Royal Philharmonic Society Award for Audiences and Engagement. Salonen and the Philharmonia Orchestra, in partnership with Music Sales Group, Rite Digital, and Touch Press, released a successful iPad app, &quot;The Orchestra&quot;. &quot;Slate&quot; called the interactive tour through orchestral history &quot;the perfect classical music app.&quot; In the autumn of 2016 the Philharmonia Orchestra launched a digital takeover of the Southbank Centre, featuring the first major virtual-reality production from a UK symphony orchestra.

===Apple campaign===

In 2014 Salonen was part of an international television and web campaign for Apple, promoting iPad Air. The campaign included not only the ad itself, but also discussions with Salonen on classical music, inspiration, and composing. Apple also offered a new and, for a limited time, free recording of Salonen&#x27;s Grawemeyer prize-winning violin concerto, featuring the violinist Leila Josefowicz and the Philharmonia Orchestra, 20 of Salonen&#x27;s classical music picks on the iTunes Store classical music page, 15 of Salonen&#x27;s iPad app picks in the app store, and a guest DJ station on iTunes Radio.

The ad was noted for &quot;the novelty of seeing a contemporary classical composer in a piece of mainstream advertising,&quot; for the synchronisation of the video editing with the score, and for the positive portrayal of classical music as compared to its typical pop cultural image. Salonen also led a concert with violinist Leila Josefowicz and the Philharmonia Orchestra in an Apple store in Berlin and spoke about mixing music and technology. It was the first time that a full orchestra had performed in an Apple store.

In the summer of 2015 Salonen spoke on the uses of technology in music education to a group of Apple Distinguished Educators.

===Personal life===
Salonen married Kaarina Gould in 2021. Salonen was previously married to Jane Price, a former musician with the Philharmonia Orchestra, with whom he had three children: daughters Ella Aneira and Anja Sofia, and son Oliver. The couple separated in 2017 and filed for divorce in June 2018 after 26 years of marriage.

When Igor Stravinsky&#x27;s former Beverly Hills residence, at 1260 North Wetherly Drive, was put up for sale, Salonen strongly considered buying it. He stated, however, that after visiting the house and noting that indentations from Stravinsky&#x27;s piano were still visible in the carpet, he was too intimidated by the prospect of trying to compose in the same house where Stravinsky had written such works as Symphony in Three Movements, the Concerto in D for Strings, &quot;The Rake&#x27;s Progress&quot;, &quot;Orpheus&quot;, &quot;Agon&quot;, the Cantata, and the Mass.

==Honours and awards==
In April 2010, Salonen was elected a Foreign Honorary Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. In May 2010, he was awarded an honorary doctorate degree from the University of Southern California, and later the same day spoke at the graduation ceremony for the USC Thornton School of Music. Salonen carried the Olympic flame on 26 July 2012, as part of the 2012 Summer Olympics torch relay. In December 2020, he was appointed an Honorary Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire (KBE), for services to music and UK-Finland relations. He was the conductor of the Royal Stockholm Philharmonic Orchestra at the 2023 Nobel Prize Concert. In 2024, he was awarded the Polar Music Prize alongside Nile Rodgers.

In 2025 he received a Grammy Award for the San Francisco Symphony&#x27;s recording of the opera &quot;Adriana Mater&quot;, by Kaija Saariaho.

==Composing==
Salonen&#x27;s compositions include his &quot;Concerto for Alto Saxophone and Orchestra&quot; (&quot;auf den ersten Blick und ohne zu wissen&quot;) (1980, with a title taken from Franz Kafka&#x27;s &quot;The Trial&quot;), &quot;Floof&quot; for soprano and ensemble (1982, on texts by Stanisław Lem) and the orchestral &quot;L.A. Variations&quot; (1996).

Salonen has stated that his time in California has helped him to be more &quot;free&quot; in his compositions. Mark Swed, chief music critic of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, described it this way:

When [Salonen] arrived in Los Angeles, he still liked to consider himself a composer-conductor, but the truth was that he had stopped writing music. &quot;The obvious and easy explanation for me to give to people when they were asking why there hadn&#x27;t been any new pieces for a while was that I had been conducting so much, I had no time,&quot; he said. &quot;But that was only half the explanation.&quot;

As a European Modernist, Salonen said, he had been inculcated with negatives, such as to avoid melody, harmonic identity and rhythmic pulse. Secretly, though, he was attracted to John Adams, who was then dismissed overseas as being simplistic. &quot;Only after a couple of years here did I begin to see that the European canon I blindly accepted was not the only truth,&quot; he said. &quot;Over here, I was able to think about this rule that forbids melody. It&#x27;s madness. Madness!&quot;

Without a European musical elite looking over his shoulder, Salonen began to feel that it was fine to have his own ideas. &quot;My focus moved from an ideological principle to a pleasure principle&quot; is how he described the composition of his breakthrough piece, &quot;LA Variations,&quot; which the Philharmonic premiered in 1997.

Although a work of great intricacy and virtuosity that doesn&#x27;t ignore Salonen&#x27;s Modernist training, &quot;LA Variations&quot; builds on rhythmic innovations closer to Adams. The piece proved an immediate hit, so much so that Salonen was stunned by the reaction and then by the score&#x27;s continuing success – it has been taken up by several other conductors and had more than 80 performances worldwide.

In order to devote more time to composition, Salonen took a year&#x27;s sabbatical from conducting in 2000, during which time he wrote a work for solo horn (&quot;Concert Étude&quot;, the competition piece for Lieksa Brass Week), &quot;Dichotomie&quot; for pianist Gloria Cheng, &quot;Mania&quot; for the cellist Anssi Karttunen and sinfonietta, and &quot;Gambit&quot;, an orchestral piece that was a birthday present for fellow composer and friend Magnus Lindberg.

In 2001, Salonen composed &quot;Foreign Bodies&quot;, his largest work in terms of orchestration, which incorporated music from the opening movement of &quot;Dichotomie&quot;. Another orchestral piece, &quot;Insomnia&quot;, followed in 2002, and another, &quot;Wing on Wing&quot;, in 2004. &quot;Wing on Wing&quot; includes parts for two sopranos and distorted samples of architect Frank Gehry&#x27;s voice as well as a fish.

As is apparent with his interpretations of such avant-garde works as Jan Sandström&#x27;s &quot;Motorbike Odyssey&quot;, Salonen voices a distaste for ideological and dogmatic approaches to composition and sees music creation as deeply physical. In the liner notes for Deutsche Grammophon&#x27;s release of &quot;Wing On Wing&quot;, he is quoted saying &quot;Musical expression is bodily expression, there is no abstract cerebral expression in my opinion. It all comes out of the body.&quot; A recurring theme in his music is the fusion of or relationship between the mechanical and the organic.

Salonen has among his intended composing projects a proposed opera based on the novel &quot;The Woman and the Ape&quot; by Peter Høeg.

==Recordings==
Salonen is renowned for his dedication to performing and recording contemporary music. His 1985 recording of Witold Lutosławski&#x27;s Symphony No. 3 won the 1985 Gramophone Award, the Grammy Award, and a Caecilia Prize for Best Contemporary Recording. He later recorded Lutosławski&#x27;s &quot;Symphony No. 4&quot; with the Los Angeles Philharmonic, once for Sony Classical, and later in a live recording at Walt Disney Concert Hall for Deutsche Grammophon. He also worked with the Philharmonia Orchestra to record the complete works of György Ligeti for Sony Classical, but the project was left unfinished due to lack of funding.

<text>The Mascarene Islands (, ) or Mascarenes or Mascarenhas Archipelago is a group of islands in the Indian Ocean east of Madagascar consisting of islands belonging to the Republic of Mauritius as well as the French department of Réunion. Their name derives from the Portuguese navigator Pedro Mascarenhas, who first visited them in April 1512. The islands share a common geological origin beneath the Mascarene Plateau known as the Mauritia microcontinent which was a Precambrian microcontinent situated between India and Madagascar until their separation about 70 million years ago. They form a distinct ecoregion with unique biodiversity and endemism of flora and fauna.

==Geography==
The archipelago comprises three large islands, Mauritius, Réunion, and Rodrigues, plus a number of volcanic remnants in the tropics of the southwestern Indian Ocean, generally between 700 and 1,500 kilometres east of Madagascar. The terrain includes a variety of reefs, atolls, and small islands. They present various topographical and edaphic regions. On the largest islands these gave rise to endemism and unusual biodiversity. The climate is oceanic and tropical.

Mauritius is located 900 km east of Madagascar. It has an area of 1,865 km2. The highest point is 828 meters above sea level. Mauritius is the most populous of the Mascarene Islands, with a population of 1,252,964.

Réunion is located 150 km southwest of Mauritius. It is the largest of the islands, with an area of 2,512 km2. Piton des Neiges (3,069 m), an extinct volcano, is the highest peak on Réunion and in the islands. Piton de la Fournaise is an active volcano on Réunion which erupts frequently.

Rodrigues is located 574 km east of Mauritius. It has an area of 108 km2, and reaches 393 meters elevation.

St. Brandon, also known as the Cargados Carajos shoals, is a coral atoll group consisting of a barrier reef, shoals, and low islets. It is the remnant of one -or more- large volcanic islands sitting on the Mauritia (microcontinent) which were submerged by rising tides. Today, the thirty or so islands that comprise St Brandon form part of the Republic of Mauritius. Around seventeen of the uninhabited islands are administered by the &#x27;Outer Islands Development Corporation&#x27; of Mauritius (an entity run by the Prime Minister of Mauritius through the Prime Minister&#x27;s Office) whilst the remaining Thirteen Islands of St. Brandon are managed by the Raphael Fishing Company from three permanently inhabited island bases of Ile Raphael, L&#x27;île du Sud (South Island, l&#x27;île Boisées) and L&#x27;Île Coco. The Raphael Fishing Company was granted these Thirteen Islands of St. Brandon under a 1901 Permanent Lease (999-year lease) which were adjudged as a Permanent Grant by determination of the Privy Council (United Kingdom) in 2008. These Thirteen islands of St. Brandon on Permanent Grant are L&#x27;île du Sud (South Island, l&#x27;île Boisée), Petit Fou, l&#x27;Avocaire, l&#x27;île aux Fous, L&#x27;île du Gouvernement, Petit Mapou, Grand Mapou, La Baleine, L&#x27;Île Coco, Île Raphael, Verronge, l&#x27;île aux Bois and Baleines Rocks.

There are several submerged banks or shoals:
*Saya de Malha Bank is a large, submerged bank. Prehistorically it was a group of volcanic islands and was enjoined to the Great Chagos Bank until continental drift pushed them apart.
*Soudan Banks are a group of low-lying banks on the Mascarene Plateau.
*Nazareth Bank is located just north of Cargados Carajos, and prehistorically they were a single geological feature. Today it is a large, shallow fishing bank.
*Hawkins Bank is located on the northernmost point of the Mascarene Plateau.

==Geology==

The islands are volcanic in origin; Saya de Malha (35 mya) was the first of the Mascarene islands to rise out of the Indian Ocean due to the Réunion hotspot, followed by Nazareth Bank (approximately 2 mya later), Soudan Bank and Cargados Carajos. The youngest islands to form were Mauritius (7–10 mya), the oldest of the existing islands, created along with the undersea Rodrigues ridge. The islands of Rodrigues and Réunion were created in the last two million years. Réunion is the largest of the islands (2,500 km2), followed by Mauritius (1,900 km2) and Rodrigues (110 km2). Eventually, Saya de Malha, Nazareth and Soudan were completely submerged, Cargados Carajos remaining as a coral atoll. The Réunion hotspot was beginning to cool and Rodrigues came out as a small island.

Réunion is home to the highest peaks in the Mascarenes, the shield volcanoes Piton des Neiges (3,069 m) and Piton de la Fournaise (2,525 m). Piton de la Fournaise, on the southeastern corner of Réunion, is one of the most active volcanoes in the world, erupting last in December 2021. Piton de la Petite Rivière Noire (828 m) is the highest peak on Mauritius, and the gentle hills of Rodrigues rise to only 390 m.

The Mascarene Plateau is an undersea plateau that extends approximately 2000 km, from the Seychelles to Réunion. The plateau covers an area of over 115,000 km2 of shallow water, with depths ranging from 8 to 150 meters, plunging to 4000 m to the abyssal plain at its edges. The southern part of the plateau, including the Saya de Malha Bank, Nazareth Bank, Soudan Banks and Cargados Carajos Shoals (Saint Brandon) (then one large island), was formed by the Réunion hotspot. These were once volcanic islands, much like Mauritius and Réunion, which have now sunk or eroded to below sea level or, in the case of the Cargados Carajos, to low coral islands. The Saya de Malha Bank formed 35 million years ago, and the Nazareth Bank and the Cargados Carajos shoals after that. Limestone banks found on the plateau are the remnants of coral reefs, indicating that the plateau was a succession of islands. Some of the banks may have been islands as recently as 18,000–6,000 years ago, when sea levels were as much as 130 meters lower during the most recent ice age.

==History==

The early colonial history of the islands, like that of the Caribbean, featured a succession of takeovers between rival powers: the Portuguese, Dutch, French and British all ruled some or all of the islands.

Around 1507, the explorer Diogo Fernandes Pereira discovered the island group. The area remained under nominal Portuguese rule until Étienne de Flacourt arrived with a French naval squadron and took possession in 1649. From 4 June 1735 to 23 March 1746, a single French Mascarene Islands chartered colony under one &quot;gouverneur général&quot; (governor general) contained Isle de France (now Mauritius), Île Bourbon (Réunion) and Séchelles (Seychelles). On 14 July 1767 this became a French crown colony, still under one governor general. From 3 February 1803 until 2 September 1810 the French colony of &quot;Indes-Orientales&quot;, under a &quot;capitaine général&quot; (captain-general), included Réunion and (nominally) the Seychelles.

===Mauritius===
It is postulated from navigational charts, such as the Cantino planisphere of 1502, that Arab sailors first discovered Mauritius around 975, calling it Dina Arobi (&quot;abandoned island&quot;). The earliest confirmed discovery on record was in 1507 by Portuguese sailors. 

The Dutch took physical possession in 1598, establishing a succession of short-lived settlements over a period of about 120 years, before abandoning their efforts in 1710.
France took control in 1715, renaming it &quot;Isle de France&quot;. In 1810, the United Kingdom invaded the island to protect its East India ships coming around the Cape of Good Hope from French pirates. Four years later, at the Treaty of Paris, France ceded Mauritius and its dependencies to the United Kingdom. 
Under British Mauritius (1810-1968), the island successfully developed as a sugar cane-based plantation economy and colony until independence in 1968.

===Rodrigues===

Rodrigues was first discovered by the Arabs but named after Portuguese navigator Diogo Rodrigues. It was under Dutch control in 1601 and settled by the French in 1691. Britain took possession of Rodrigues in 1809. When Mauritius gained independence in 1968, Rodrigues was forcefully joined to it. Rodrigues remains an autonomous region of Mauritius.

===Réunion===
Réunion was discovered first by the Arabs then by the Portuguese, who named it Santa Apolónia. It was then occupied by the French as part of Mauritius. It was first inhabited by French mutineers who arrived on the island between 1646 and 1669. It was given its current name in 1793. From 1810 to 1815 it was held by the British, before being returned to France. Réunion became an overseas department of France in 1946.

==Climate==
The climate of the islands is tropical. At low elevations summer temperatures (December to April) average 30 °C. Winter temperatures (May to November) are generally cooler, around 25 °C. Temperatures are cooler in the mountains, averaging 18 °C. During the winter short-lived snow can fall on Réunion&#x27;s high peaks.

Southeasterly trade winds blow throughout the year. Rainfall is generally higher on the windward sides of the islands. On Mauritius average annual rainfall in the lowlands varies from 1905 mm on the windward southeast coast to 890 mm on the leeward side. Rainfall in the mountains is higher, varying from 2540 mm to 4445 mm annually. Tropical cyclones occur occasionally, bringing heavy rain and high winds, and causing erosion and landslides.

==Flora==
The habitats of the Macarenes vary with the islands&#x27; size, topography, age, and proximity to Madagascar, the nearest major land mass. As is common among remote islands, the Mascarene fauna and flora display a high degree of endemism; they include over a thousand species of which several hundred are endemic. The Mascarene islands form a distinct ecoregion known as the Mascarene forests. Until Europeans first settled the islands in the sixteenth century the Mascarenes are not known to have harbored any human population, and the islands&#x27; wildlife was still flourishing during the early days of settlement. Today much of the natural vegetation is gone, and there are many introduced species on the islands.

In prehistoric times the islands were covered in a diverse range of tropical moist broadleaf forests. The plant communities are not homogeneous, and comprise at least five fairly distinct vegetation zones that reflect variations in altitude and in moisture regime. These include dry lowland forests, semi-dry sclerophyllous forests, lowland rainforests, montane cloud forests, and high-elevation heathlands on Réunion.

Coastal habitats include beach vegetation, coastal wetlands, and swamp forests, grading into lowland rain forest on the windward sides of the islands and lowland dry forests to leeward.

The dry lowland forests are found on the leeward sides of the islands, from sea level to 200 metres in areas with less than 1000 mm of average annual rainfall. Palms are the dominant trees, including species of &quot;Latania&quot; and &quot;Dictyosperma album&quot;, along with the palm-like screw-pines (&quot;Pandanus&quot; spp.).

Semi-dry sclerophyllous forests are found between the coast and 360 metres elevation on Mauritius and Rodrigues, and from 200 to 750 metres elevation on the western slopes of Réunion, where only small patches of such forest now remain. Average annual rainfall in the semi-dry forests ranges from 1000 to 1500 mm. Tree genera and families well-represented in the semi-dry forests include ebony species in the genus &quot;Diospyros&quot; (Ebenaceae), &quot;Pleurostylia&quot; (Celastraceae), &quot;Foetidia&quot; (Lecythidaceae), &quot;Olea europaea&quot; subsp. &quot;cuspidata&quot; (Oleaceae), &quot;Cossinia pinnata&quot; (Sapindaceae) &quot;Dombeya&quot; (Malvaceae), &quot;Terminalia bentzoe&quot; (Combretaceae), and &quot;Sideroxylon boutonianum, Sideroxylon borbonicum&quot;, and various species of &quot;Mimusops&quot; in family Sapotaceae. Shrubs in the semi-dry forests include several spectacular endemic species of &quot;Hibiscus&quot; (Malvaceae), &quot;Zanthoxylum&quot; (Rutaceae), &quot;Obetia ficifolia&quot; (Urticaceae), and &quot;Scolopia heterophylla&quot; (Flacourtiaceae).

The lowland rain forests are characterized by dense evergreen forests, composed of diverse species creating a canopy of 30 meters or more in height. They are found on the Mauritius&#x27; eastern lowlands from the coast to 800–900 metres elevation, and above 360 m on the western slopes. On Réunion lowland rain forests are found between 750 and 1100 m. They occur in areas with average annual rainfall of 1500 to 6000 mm. Characteristic trees include species of &quot;Mimusops&quot; and &quot;Labourdonnaisia&quot; (Sapotaceae), &quot;Hernandia mascarenensis&quot; (Hernandiaceae), &quot;Calophyllum&quot; (Clusiaceae), and species of &quot;Syzygium&quot;, &quot;Eugenia&quot;, &quot;Sideroxylon&quot;, and &quot;Monimiastrum&quot; (Myrtaceae). Characteristic shrubs include species of &quot;Gaertnera&quot;, &quot;Chassalia&quot;, &quot;Bertiera&quot;, and &quot;Coffea&quot; in family Rubiaceae. Other plants include bamboos like &quot;Nastus borbonicus&quot;, numerous species of orchids (e.g., &quot;Angraecum&quot;, &quot;Bulbophyllum&quot;) and ferns e.g., &quot;Asplenium&quot;, &quot;Hymenophyllum&quot;, &quot;Trichomanes&quot;, &quot;Elaphoglossum&quot;, and &quot;Marattia fraxinea&quot;.

The cloud forests are evergreen rain forests found on mountain slopes with high rainfall. They occur on Réunion between 800 and 1900 metres elevation on eastern slopes with an average annual rainfall of 2000–10,000 mm, and between 1100 and 2000 metres on western slopes with an average annual rainfall of 2000–3000 mm. By 2005, relatively intact cloud forests still covered approximately 44,000 ha on Réunion. On Mauritius they are restricted to a small area of Montagne Cocotte in the island&#x27;s southwest, above 750 metres elevation and with average annual rainfall of 4500–5500 mm. Trees form a dense canopy 6 to 10 metres high. Typical canopy trees include species of &quot;Dombeya&quot; on Réunion, and species of &quot;Monimia&quot; and &quot;Tambourissa&quot; (Monimiaceae) on both islands. There is an understory of small trees and shrubs including species of &quot;Psiadia&quot; (Asteraceae) and &quot;Melicope&quot; (Rutaceae). The forests are rich in epiphytes (orchids, ferns, mosses, lichens), emergent tree ferns (&quot;Cyathea&quot; species), and, originally the palms &quot;Acanthophoenix rubra&quot;, but poaching has wiped out palms in many areas of Réunion. Three monodominant plant communities are also found in the cloud forests – forests of &quot;Acacia heterophylla&quot; (Fabaceae) as the canopy tree, which are similar to the &quot;Acacia koa&quot; forests in Hawaii, thickets dominated by &quot;Erica reunionensis&quot; (Ericaceae), and hyperhumid forests of screw-pine (&quot;Pandanus montanus&quot;).
Subalpine shrub occurs on the volcanoes on Réunion, above the treeline at 1800 to 2000 metres elevation. Average annual rainfall is from 2000 to 6000 mm, and frosts occur regularly in winter. Characteristic shrubs include &quot;Erica reunionensis&quot; and &quot;Erica galioides&quot; (Ericaceae), &quot;Stoebe passerinoides&quot; and species of &quot;Hubertia&quot; and &quot;Psiadia&quot; (Asteraceae), and &quot;Phylica nitida&quot; (Rhamnaceae). Herbaceous endemic species include &quot;Heterochaenia rivalsii&quot; (Campanulaceae), &quot;Eriotrix commersonii&quot; (Asteraceae), and &quot;Cynoglossum borbonicum&quot; (Boraginaceae).

Recent volcanic deposits on Réunion&#x27;s volcanic summits are covered by sparse grasslands rich in endemic grasses, including &quot;Festuca borbonica&quot;, &quot;Agrostis salaziensis&quot;, and &quot;Cenchrus afer&quot;. along with orchids like &quot;Disa borbonica&quot;. Ericoid thickets and thickets of the small tree &quot;Sophora denudata&quot; (Fabaceae) are found on weathered volcanic substrates.

Most of the indigenous Mascarene flora and fauna are thought to have descended originally from Madagascan and African ancestors.

The four largest families present in the Mascarene Islands are Myrtaceae, Rubiaceae, Orchidaceae, and Euphorbiaceae, which comprise between 193 and 223 species each, for a total of 831 species, or 26.9% of the flowering plant flora. Another seven families contain 80 or more species each: Poaceae, Apocynaceae, Cyperaceae, Cunoniaceae, Rutaceae, Araliaceae, and Sapotaceae, representing an additional ca. 660 species in all, 21.3% of the angiosperm flora. Ferns are prominent components of the biotas of the islands, especially in the tropical forest. Most ferns disperse easily via ornithochory of their spores, allowing fairly frequent colonization from Madagascar and exchange among the Mascarene islands.

The Mascarenes are home to many endemic species of Dombeyoideae, the monotypic genus &quot;Psiloxylon&quot; (&quot;Psiloxylon mauritianum&quot;), and members of the family Monimiaceae (the genera &quot;Monimia&quot; and &quot;Trochetia&quot;, and species of &quot;Tambourissa&quot;) and Escalloniaceae. Indigenous trees include species of the genera &quot;Ocotea, Erythrina, Sideroxylon&quot;, and &quot;Foetidia&quot;. The palm genera &quot;Latania&quot;, &quot;Hyophorbe&quot;, &quot;Acanthophoenix&quot;, &quot;Dictyosperma&quot;, and &quot;Tectiphiala&quot; are all endemic to the Mascarene Islands. Other endemic genera include &quot;Berenice, Heterochaenia, Nesocodon, Ruizia&quot;, and &quot;Astiria&quot;.

There are 24 species of trees and shrubs in the Mascarenes from subfamily Dombeyoideae, 23 of which are endemic to the islands. The Macarenes&#x27; endemic species are polyphyletic and split into nine clades. &quot;Trochetia&quot; appears monophyletic and more closely related to &quot;Eriolaena&quot; and &quot;Helmiopsis&quot; than to &quot;Dombeya&quot;. All &quot;Dombeya&quot; taxa are included in a clade together with &quot;Ruizia&quot; and &quot;Astiria&quot;, this means that &quot;Dombeya&quot; is paraphyletic. In terms of breeding systems the Malagasy Dombeyoideae are hermaphroditic, whereas those of the Mascarenes are considered dioecious. The polyphyly of the Mascarene Dombeyoideae suggests that dioecy has been acquired several times. At least five colonization events from Madagascar to the Mascarene archipelago occurred. The evolutionary history of two lineages of Mascarene Domeyoideae seems to be related to adaption to xeric habitats.

The flora of the islands co-evolved with the island&#x27;s unique fauna over millions of years. The human-caused extinction of several of the Mascarenes&#x27; land animals, and the introduction of exotic animals to the islands by humans, has disrupted the reproduction and thriving of various island plants. For example, the Tambalacoque tree (&quot;Sideroxylon grandiflorum&quot;), often called the dodo tree, is not producing young trees and is threatened with extinction. The extinct dodo, &quot;Cylindraspis&quot; tortoises, and broad-billed parrots, along with fruit bats, played an important role in dispersing the seeds. Passing through the animals&#x27; digestive tract aided in the seeds&#x27; germination. However the trees&#x27; decline may be mostly due to introduced crab-eating macaques (&quot;Macaca fascicularis&quot;) destroying unripened seeds.

==Fauna==

Much of the Mascarenes&#x27; native fauna has become endangered or extinct since the human settlement of the islands in the 17th century. Settlers cleared most of the forests for agriculture and grazing, and introduced many exotic species, including pigs, rats, cats, monkeys, and mongooses.

=== Birds ===
Many of the Mascarene birds evolved into flightless forms, the most famous of which was the extinct flightless pigeon, the dodo of Mauritius. Thirteen additional species of birds became extinct, including the Réunion flightless ibis, broad-billed parrot, red rail, Rodrigues rail, and Rodrigues solitaire.

Contemporary sources state that the dodo used gizzard stones and could swallow &quot;Ocotea&quot; fruits. Seed distribution of at least some &quot;Ocotea&quot; species is performed by frugivorous birds and there exist a few reports of &quot;solitaires&quot; from the Mascarenes without mention of which island these came from, and the term was also used for other species with &quot;solitary&quot; habits, such as the Réunion blue swamphen and the Réunion sacred ibis. At one point it was even believed that Réunion was the home of not only a white dodo, but also a white solitaire. In 1786, sub-fossil bones were discovered in a cave which confirmed Leguat&#x27;s descriptions, but at this time no living residents of Rodrigues remembered having seen living birds. The star constellation Turdus Solitarius was named after this bird.

Today 17 endemic bird species survive on the islands. Two species – the Mascarene paradise flycatcher (&quot;Terpsiphone bourbonnensis&quot;) and Mascarene swiftlet (&quot;Aerodramus francicus&quot;) – inhabit both Mauritius and Réunion. Eight species are endemic to Mauritius – the Mauritius grey white-eye, (&quot;Zosterops mauritianus&quot;), Mauritius cuckooshrike (&quot;Lalage typica&quot;), Mauritius kestrel (&quot;Falco punctatus&quot;), Mauritius fody (&quot;Foudia rubra&quot;), Mauritius bulbul (&quot;Hypsipetes olivaceus&quot;), Mauritius parakeet (&quot;Psittacula eques&quot;), Mauritius olive white-eye (&quot;Zosterops chloronothos&quot;), and pink pigeon (&quot;Nesoenas mayeri&quot;). The Réunion grey white-eye (&quot;Zosterops borbonicus&quot;), Réunion cuckooshrike (&quot;Lalage newtoni&quot;), Réunion stonechat (&quot;Saxicola tectes&quot;), Réunion olive white-eye (&quot;Zosterops olivaceus&quot;), and Réunion bulbul (&quot;Hypsipetes borbonicus&quot;) are endemic to Réunion. The Rodrigues warbler (&quot;Acrocephalus rodericanus&quot;) and Rodrigues fody (&quot;Foudia flavicans&quot;) are found only on Rodrigues.

=== Reptiles ===
Mauritius, Réunion, and Rodrigues were also once each home to one or more species of giant tortoises, now extinct, which comprised the genus &quot;Cylindraspis&quot;. There are 13 living endemic reptile species, including a number of species of day geckoes (genus &quot;Phelsuma&quot;).

=== Mammals ===
The islands&#x27; only native mammals are bats, including the Mauritian flying fox (&quot;Pteropus niger&quot;), which is endemic to Mauritius and Réunion, and the Rodrigues flying fox (&quot;Pteropus rodricensis&quot;) found only on Rodrigues. The lesser Mascarene flying fox (&quot;Pteropus subniger&quot;) is extinct.

==Freshwater==
The three largest islands have many freshwater streams which descend from the mountains to the sea. The upper reaches, particularly on Réunion, are fast-flowing and steep with numerous waterfalls. Tamarin Falls or Sept Cascades (293 m) on Mauritius is the highest waterfall on Mauritius, while Cascade Trou de Fer (725 m, ranks 23rd worldwide) on Réunion is the highest of the Mascarenes.

The Grand River South East (34 km) is the longest river on Mauritius, followed by Rivière du Poste (23 km), Grand River North West (22 km), Rivière La Chaux (22 km), and Rivière des Créoles (20 km). Mauritius has two natural crater lakes, Grand Bassin and Bassin Blanc.

There are about twenty species of fish which spend at least part of their lives in freshwater. The islands have five endemic freshwater fish species, all gobies (Gobiiformes) – &quot;Hypseleotris cyprinoides, Cotylopus acutipinnis, Glossogobius kokius, Gobius commersonii&quot;, and &quot;Oxyurichthys guibei&quot;. &quot;Cotylopus acutipinnis&quot;, which is endemic to Réunion, hatches in the sea before migrating to the rainforest streams where it lives its adult life.

==Marine==
The Mascarene Islands are surrounded by approximately 750 square km of coral reef. Rodrigues has nearly continuous fringing reefs bounding an extensive lagoon, 7 to 20 km wide, with deep channels. Mauritius is also surrounded by a fringing reef. In contrast, Réunion has very short stretches of narrow fringing reef along the western and southwestern coasts only. The islets of the Cargados Carajos Shoals, which have a very depauperate terrestrial biota owing to being so low-lying and swamped during cyclones, are bound to the east by an extensive arc of fringing reef, which accounts for ~30% of the reefs of the Mascarene Islands. Lagoon reefs and reef flats are dominated by scleractinian corals such as branching and tabular &quot;Acropora&quot;, &quot;Porites&quot; massives, foliaceous &quot;Montipora&quot; and &quot;Pavona&quot;, and sand consolidated with beds of seagrass such &quot;Halophila&quot; (Hydrocharitaceae).
Among coral reef fishes, wrasses (Labridae), damselfish (Pomacentridae), carnivorous groupers (Serranidae), and surgeonfishes (Acanthuridae) have many species.

==Wildlife, threats, and preservation==

Mauritius has one of the highest population densities in the world. All of the islands have experienced significant losses of habitats. Many of the surviving endemic species are still threatened with extinction and have little protection. Less than 40 percent of Réunion is covered with natural vegetation, only about 5 percent of Mauritius, and almost none of Rodrigues. On Réunion, forest has been cleared for agriculture and then overtaken by introduced plants. Mauritius was largely converted to sugar cane, tea, and conifer plantations. On Rodrigues, shifting cultivation has caused the damage.

=== Launch of Saint Brandon Conservation Trust ===
On 8 May 2024, Saint Brandon Conservation Trust, an independent Mauritian NGO, was internationally launched at the Corporate Council on Africa in Dallas, Texas, to protect St. Brandon from pollution and to protect surviving flora and fauna in the Cargados Carajos.

==Protected areas==
Protected areas constitute 40.6% of the Mascarene Islands&#x27; land area. Terrestrial protected areas on Mauritius include Black River Gorges National Park, Bras d&#x27;Eau National Park, Perrier Nature Reserve, Corps de Garde Nature Reserve, Le Pouce Nature Reserve, Cabinet Nature Reserve, Gouly Pere Nature Reserve, and Bois Sec Nature Reserve. There are 32 designated protected areas on Réunion, including Réunion National Park (1055.15 km2), which cover 63.13% of the island.

<text>The University of Maine (UMaine) is a public land-grant research university in Orono, Maine, United States. It was established in 1865 as the land-grant college of Maine and is the flagship university of the University of Maine System. It is classified among &quot;R1: Doctoral Universities – Very high research activity&quot;.

With an enrollment of approximately 11,500 students, UMaine is the state&#x27;s largest college or university. The University of Maine&#x27;s athletic teams, nicknamed the Black Bears, are Maine&#x27;s only Division I athletics program. Maine&#x27;s men&#x27;s ice hockey team has won two national championships.

==History==
The University of Maine was founded in 1862 as a function of the Morrill Act. Established in 1865 as the Maine State College of Agriculture and the Mechanic Arts, the college opened on September 21, 1868, and changed its name to the University of Maine in 1897.

By 1871, curricula had been organized in Agriculture, Engineering, and electives. The Maine Agricultural and Forest Experiment Station was founded as a division of the university in 1887. Gradually the university developed the Colleges of Life Sciences and Agriculture (later to include the School of Forest Resources and the School of Human Development), Engineering and Science, and Arts and Sciences. In 1912 the Maine Cooperative Extension, which offers field educational programs for both adults and youths, was initiated. The School of Education was established in 1930 and received college status in 1958. The School of Business Administration was formed in 1958 and was granted college status in 1965. Women have been admitted into all curricula since 1872. The first master&#x27;s degree was conferred in 1881; the first doctor&#x27;s degree in 1960. Since 1923 there has been a separate graduate school.

Near the end of the 19th century, the university expanded its curriculum to place greater emphasis on liberal arts. As a result of this shift, faculty hired during the early 20th century included Caroline Colvin, chair of the history department and the nation&#x27;s first woman to head a major university department.

In 1906, The Senior Skull Honor Society was founded to &quot;publicly recognize, formally reward, and continually promote outstanding leadership and scholarship, and exemplary citizenship within the University of Maine community.&quot;

On April 16, 1925, 80 women met in Balentine Hall faculty, alumnae, and undergraduate representatives to plan a pledging of members to an inaugural honorary organization. This organization was called &quot;The All Maine Women&quot; because only those women closely connected with the University of Maine were elected as members. On April 22, 1925, the new members were inducted into the honor society.

When the University of Maine System was incorporated, in 1968, the school was renamed by the legislature over the objections of the faculty to the University of Maine at Orono (known informally as &quot;U.M.O.&quot;). This was changed back to the University of Maine in 1986, when the &quot;U.M.O.&quot; moniker was also abandoned and replaced officially with &quot;UMaine&quot; as the informal title with which to reference the Orono campus.

==Organization and administration==
The University of Maine is the flagship of the University of Maine System. The president of the university is Joan Ferrini-Mundy. The senior administration governs cooperatively with the chancellor of the University of Maine system, Dannel Malloy, and the sixteen members of the University of Maine Board of Trustees (of which fifteen are appointed by the governor of Maine and one is the current Maine state commissioner of education). The Board of Trustees has full legal responsibility and authority for the university system. It appoints the chancellor and each university president, approves the establishment and elimination of academic programs, confers tenure on faculty members, and sets tuition rates and operating budgets.

UMaine is also one of a handful of colleges in the United States whose Student Government is incorporated. Student Government was formed in 1978 and incorporated in 1987. It is classified as a 501(c)(3) not-for-profit corporation.

==Campus==
===Location and layout===
Situated on Marsh Island, between the Penobscot and Stillwater rivers, the University of Maine is the nation&#x27;s only land grant university (other than the University of Hawaiʻi) on an island. Occupying the small city of Orono, population ~9,500, the campus has an enrollment (Fall 2019) of 11,561 students. The campus has thirty-seven academic buildings, thirty administrative buildings, eighteen residence halls, eighteen specific laboratory facilities, fourteen Greek life houses, ten sports facilities, five museums, two dining facilities, two convenience stores, a student union, a cafe, a pub, an state of the art recreation and fitness center, and a 200&#x27;x200&#x27; air supported athletic/recreational dome.

In 1867, the university rejected a campus plan by landscape architect Frederick Law Olmsted, who designed Central Park in New York City and the White House grounds in Washington, D.C. The plan&#x27;s broad concepts, including the Front Lawn, were nevertheless adopted during the school&#x27;s first fifty years, and were oriented toward the Stillwater River. A second master plan was produced in 1932 by Carl Rust Parker of the Olmsted Brothers firm, which reoriented the campus center to the Mall, an open grassy area between the Raymond H. Fogler Library and the Memorial Gym. The Mall is further bordered by one residence and five academic halls.

The campus is essentially divided into three sections (northern, southern, and hilltop), all of which are near or border the Mall. The northern section includes many of the athletic facilities, including the Alfond Arena (basketball, hockey), Morse Field at the Alfond Sports Stadium (football, track and field), Larry Mahaney Diamond (baseball), Kessock Field (softball), the Field Hockey Complex (field hockey), and the Mahaney athletic/recreational dome. Other buildings on the northern section include the Cutler Health Center, two administrative halls, three residence halls, and multiple academic halls.

The southern section of campus includes the Memorial Student Union, the Maynard F. Jordan Observatory, Lengyel Gymnasium and Athletic Field, the Buchanan Alumni House, as well as multiple administrative, residence, and academic halls. The Collins Center for the Arts is also on the southern part of campus. It provides the Hutchins Concert Hall, a 1,435-seat venue for performing artists from around the world, and the Hudson Museum. The Hilltop section of campus is populated largely with residence halls but also includes the Lyle E. Littlefield Ornamental Gardens, as well as academic and recreational facilities. The campus is also designated as an arboretum.

The pre-1915 core of the campus, covering its earliest period of development, was listed as a historic district on the National Register of Historic Places in 1978; this was expanded to include the second major phase of development (through the end of World War II) in 2010.

== Student life ==

===Ambulance Service===
The University of Maine operates the &quot;University Volunteer Ambulance Corps,&quot; an Ambulance service fully licensed by the State of Maine. The service is operated by students and staff. UVAC&#x27;s ambulances also provide aid to many surrounding towns and agencies. The service ensures a licensed Emergency Medical Technician is sent on every call. The service has two ambulances equipped to provide Paramedic Level care, and responds to approximately 500 calls per school year.

===Greek life===
Greek life has existed at the University of Maine since 1874. Approximately 14% of University of Maine undergraduates are members of Greek letter organizations.

===Sustainability===
The University of Maine was one of 16 colleges and universities listed in &quot;Princeton Review&#x27;s&quot; &quot;Green Honor Roll&quot; of 2011. The guide notes that UMaine has a sustainability coordinator, a sustainability council, and &quot;Eco Reps&quot; in its residence halls.

===Dining services===
The campus has two dining halls, Hilltop and York, and the Bear&#x27;s Den Café &amp; Pub in Memorial Union. Wells Dining Hall closed in fall 2022 due to a decrease in student enrollment. In fall 2023, the university deployed robots called Kiwibots to deliver food to students across campus. The Black Bear Exchange is the campus food pantry. The pantry is supported by the Good Shepherd Food Bank, donations, and food drives.

In 2022, the university signed a contract to outsource campus dining services to Sodexo beginning on July 1, 2023. Sodexo provides food service at Maine&#x27;s six other public universities. The deal requires Sodexo to pay the university a $3 million signing bonus and invest $7 million in dining hall improvements. In 2024, the high number of complaints about bad food led the university to form weekly focus groups of students. The dining halls began stocking its fresh fruit bars all day.
=== &quot;The Maine Campus&quot; ===
Founded in 1875, &quot;The Maine Campus&quot; is a weekly newspaper produced by students. It covers university and Town of Orono events. The &quot;Campus&quot; is a direct-funded student organization and is not under the purview of student government. Stephen King wrote a weekly column for the &quot;Campus&quot; in the 1970s and also published short stories such as &quot;Slade&quot; in the newspaper.

==Academics==

The University of Maine offers more than 90 undergraduate major programs organized in five colleges: the College of Education and Human Development; the College of Engineering; the Honors College; the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences; and the College of Earth, Life, and Health Sciences. UMaine also is home to one of the nation&#x27;s oldest honors programs, now called the Honors College. The Honors College offers academically qualified students an opportunity for intensive, interdisciplinary study. Students are invited to become part of the Honors College during the admissions review process. UMaine also offers a wide array of graduate programs, including more than seventy master&#x27;s degree programs and thirty doctorate programs.

The University of Maine is one of only a handful of institutions to offer a combined developmental/clinical PhD to students accepted into their clinical psychology PhD program, as well as advanced degrees with distinct concentrations in developmental psychology, social psychology, cognitive psychology, and behavioral neuroscience. The University of Maine has a strong commitment to developing the next generation of neuroscience researchers and educators, thus along with offering a PhD in psychological science with a concentration in behavioral neuroscience, they also offer a neuroscience concentration for PhD students studying biomedical science.

It is the only institution in Maine ranked as a national university in the &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; annual rankings. U.S. News categorizes UMaine as an institution that offers &quot;a full range of undergraduate majors, master&#x27;s, and doctoral degrees.&quot;

UMaine is one of only four institutions in Maine (along with Bowdoin, Bates, and Colby) accredited to award membership into the Phi Beta Kappa honor society.

The university is also the birthplace of the Phi Kappa Phi honor society, recognizing high academic achievement across all disciplines.

The Raymond H. Fogler Library is the largest in Maine and serves as one of its intellectual hubs, attracting scholars, professors, and researchers from around the state. A collection of rare and ancient manuscripts, as well as about two million government publications, augment the university&#x27;s collection. The Special Collections Unit includes the Stephen King (author and UMaine alumnus) papers, which attract researchers from across the globe.

UMaine hosts the Intensive English Institute, an English as a second language program designed to help students develop their English language skills for success in school, business, and social communication. Due to budget cuts during the COVID-19 pandemic, the IEI was discontinued as of May 31, 2020.

The University of Maine is also home to the Maine Business School, the largest business school in the state. Paris-based international educational consulting organization Eduniversal has included the Maine Business School at the University of Maine among its selection of 1,000 of the world&#x27;s best business schools, ranking it as an &quot;excellent business school-nationally strong and/or with continental links.&quot; In 2011, &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; ranked the Maine Business School among the nation&#x27;s best business colleges

The Canadian-American Center, an institution that focuses on Canadian-American studies is based at the University of Maine.

===Accreditation===
The University of Maine is accredited by the New England Commission of Higher Education, and programmatically accredited by other accreditors including the Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business, the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology, the American Chemical Society, the American Dietetic Association, the American Psychological Association, the American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, the Commission on Accreditation of Athletic Training Education, the Commission on Collegiate Nursing Education, the Computing Sciences Accreditation Board, the Council for the Advancement of Educator Preparation, the Council on Social Work Education, the National Association of Schools of Music, the National Association of Schools of Public Affairs and Administration, the Society of American Foresters, and the Society of Wood Science and Technology.

==Research==
The University of Maine is one of the National Science Foundation&#x27;s top 100 public universities for research. In FY10, UMaine exceeded $100 million in external expenditures for research, 86% of which was federal funding. Leading sectors of the university in generating external support are advanced materials, marine sciences, climate change, environmental studies, forestry, precision manufacturing, and aquaculture. In 2008, the Center for Undergraduate Research was established to connect students with faculty projects.

===UMaine Advanced Structures and Composites Center===
The UMaine Advanced Structures and Composites Center, founded in 1996 with support from the National Science Foundation, provides research, education, and economic development encompassing material sciences, manufacturing and engineering of composites and structures. The center&#x27;s research and development projects have included the VolturnUS 1:8, composite arch bridge system, and the Modular Ballistic Protection System (MBPS).

The center is the leading member of the DeepCwind Consortium, whose mission is to establish the State of Maine as a national leader in deepwater offshore wind technology.

===Multisensory Interactive Media Lab===
Founded in 2018, the Multisensory Interactive Media Lab (MIM Lab) is moving into an era of &#x27;Internet of Everything,&#x27; in which everything and everyone will be digitally embedded and connected. In the MIM Lab of the University of Maine, academic researchers develop novel enabling technologies to explore the immense potential for the communication of our experiences – shifting focus from the current age of information towards a new age of experience. Many of their research works try to answer a fundamental question &quot;How can we move beyond traditional visual- and auditory-based digital interfaces to form immersive sensory rich interactions in the context of real-world, augmented or virtual experiences?&quot;.

===Forest Land Resources===
The University of Maine is responsible for over of land across Maine which is used for research and recreation. Among the most prominent are: Aroostook Farm, (Presque Isle, Maine); Bear Brook Watershed, (Hancock County, Maine); Dwight B. Demeritt Forest, (Orono, Maine / Old Town, Maine); Fay Hyland Bog, (Orono / Veazie, Maine); and Hirundo Wildlife Refuge, (Old Town, Maine).

===Bureau of Labor Education===
The Bureau of Labor Education at the University of Maine in August 1966 with funds appropriated by the Maine Legislature. Its mission is to ensure that &quot;appropriate and specialized educational programs (be made) available to members of the Maine labor force, both organized and unorganized.&quot; Historian Charles Scontras has been affiliated with the BLE since its founding with his first book being published also in 1966.

=== Climate Change Institute ===

The University of Maine Climate Change Institute dates to 1973 and the founding of the Institute for Quaternary Studies. In 2002, it was renamed. The institute has mapped the difference between climate during the Ice Age and during modern times, connecting acid rain to human causes in the 1980s, and finding that the climate can change abruptly through analysis of ice core samples from Greenland. The institute maintains the Climate Reanalyzer, a website that provides data visualization tools based on climate and weather datasets from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and other meteorological organizations.

==Athletics==


The University of Maine participates in the NCAA&#x27;s Division I level, and is a member of the Coastal Athletic Association for football, Hockey East for ice hockey, and the America East Conference for all other sports. The school has won two national championships, both in men&#x27;s ice hockey. In 1993, they defeated Lake Superior State University 5–4 behind a third period hat trick by Jim Montgomery. In 1999, they defeated rival University of New Hampshire 3–2 in overtime on a goal by Marcus Gustafsson.

In 1965, the football team competed in the Tangerine Bowl in Orlando, Florida against East Carolina. They were beaten in the game 31–0, but remain the only team from Maine to compete in a bowl contest.

Although the official fight song of UMaine is &quot;For Maine&quot;, the school&#x27;s main spirit song is the better-known &quot;Maine Stein Song&quot;. Written by Lincoln Colcord (words) and E. A. Fenstad (music), the tune rose to fame when singer Rudy Vallée arranged the current version. Vallee attended Maine from 1921 to 1922 before transferring to Yale, and his popularity helped make the song a national favorite. To this day, the &quot;Stein Song&quot; remains the only college fight song to ever reach number one on the pop charts, achieving this distinction in 1930. According to &quot;College Fight Songs: An Annotated Anthology&quot;, by Studwell and Schueneman, the &quot;Stein Song&quot; is one of the very best fight songs of all time.

<text>Max Burckhard (14 July 1854, Korneuburg, Lower Austria - 16 March 1912, Vienna) was director of the Burgtheater, Vienna, from 1890 to 1898.

== Vita ==
Max Burckhard, a lawyer, was the artistic director of the Burgtheater when it opened as the “Neue Haus am Ring” on 12 May 1890. He remained director until 1898. He introduced Sunday matinees at a reduced cost to widen the theatre&#x27;s potential audience. He later remarked that the less wealthy audiences were the most &quot;critically acute&quot;. As director, he remodeled the auditorium in the spring and summer of 1897, and introduced contemporary drama by Henrik Ibsen, Gerhart Hauptmann, Arthur Schnitzler, Hugo von Hofmannsthal to the Viennese audience as well as Austrian classics of Ludwig Anzengruber and Ferdinand Raimund. He hired such famous actors as Adele Sandrock, Otto Treßler, Hedwig Bleibtreu, and Josef Kainz but was pressured to resign after having &quot;aroused the displeasure of the Christian Social Party&quot;.

<doc id="370471" wikidata="Q208668" url="?curid=370471" title="Rodrigues">
<text>Rodrigues ( ; Creole: ) is a autonomous outer island of the Republic of Mauritius in the Indian Ocean, about east of Mauritius. It is part of the Mascarene Islands, which include Mauritius and Réunion. Like Agaléga, Rodrigues is a constituent island of the Republic of Mauritius, under the Constitution of Mauritius and still remains, as explicitly defined by the same Constitution, part of the Sovereignty of Mauritius, together with the following islands: &quot;Agaléga, Tromelin, Cargados Carajos (Saint Brandon), Chagos Archipelago ... Diego Garcia and other islands included in the State of Mauritius&quot;.

Rodrigues is of volcanic origin and is surrounded by coral reef, and some tiny uninhabited islands lie just off its coast. The island used to be the tenth District of Mauritius; it gained autonomous status on 12 October 2002, and is governed by the Rodrigues Regional Assembly. The capital of the island is Port Mathurin. The islands of Rodrigues, Agaléga and Saint Brandon form part of the larger territory of the Republic of Mauritius.

Its inhabitants are Mauritian citizens. , the island&#x27;s population was about 41,669, according to Statistics Mauritius. Most of the inhabitants are of African descent. Its economy is based mainly on fishing, farming, handicraft and a developing tourism sector.

==Etymology and history==

Rodrigues was named after Portuguese explorer Diogo Rodrigues, who first came upon the uninhabited island in 1528, under direction of Portuguese Viceroy Pedro Mascarenhas (namesake of the Mascarene Islands).
Many maps also describe it as Diego Roiz. From the 10th century, Arabs are known to have visited the Mascarene Islands. The Cantino planisphere of and some other contemporary maps clearly show the three islands of the Mascarenes as &quot;Dina Arobi&quot; (or &quot;Harobi&quot;), &quot;Dina Margabin&quot; and &quot;Dina Moraze&quot;. These are apparently corrupted transliterations or transcriptions of the Arabic &quot;Diva Harab&quot; (&quot;Desert Island&quot;), &quot;Diva Maghrebin&quot; (&quot;Western Island&quot;) and &quot;Diva Mashriq&quot; (&quot;Eastern Island&quot;). While the second clearly refers to Réunion, sources disagree about which of the other is Mauritius and which one Rodrigues, which are both to the east of Réunion and arranged in a somewhat stylised way on these maps. However, even in its original state, Rodrigues had some karst, while Mauritius even after suffering 500 years of deforestation can by no means be called &quot;desert&quot; even in a colloquial sense.

The island was located again in February 1507. Part of the fleet of Afonso de Albuquerque and Tristão da Cunha, Diogo Fernandes Pereira&#x27;s ship &quot;Cisne&quot; (Swan) spotted Réunion on 9 February after a cyclone had diverted their course forcing them to go around Madagascar, unlike the rest of the fleet. It has also been opined that this was due to a navigational error by Afonso de Albuquerque. The other two islands were subsequently rediscovered. The initial name was &quot;Diogo Fernandes&quot;; &quot;Domingo Froiz&quot; was given as a name some years later, and by 1528 it had been again renamed after the Portuguese navigator Dom Diogo Rodrigues and has remained so since. The orthography has been less stable at first, with the name being transcribed &quot;Diogo Rodríguez&quot; (Spanish maps), &quot;Diego Roiz&quot;, &quot;Diego Ruys&quot; (Dutch maps) (or even &quot;Diego Ruy&#x27;s Island&quot;), &quot;Dygarroys&quot; or &quot;Bygarroys&quot;. Some early French sources called it &quot;Île Marianne&quot;.

Due to the island lying far off the beaten track of seafarers at that time, it received few visits. From 1601, the Dutch began visiting the island somewhat more regularly for fresh supplies of food. In 1691, the Huguenot François Leguat and seven companions landed on the island, intending to set up a farming colony of Protestant refugees. Farming was not successful, but there was an abundance of tortoises, turtles, birds, fish and other seafood.

During the 18th century, several attempts were made by the French to develop the island. African slaves (ancestors of the present population) were brought to Rodrigues to develop stock-breeding and farming. In 1735 a permanent French settlement was established, subordinated to Île Bourbon.

In 1809, after a brief battle with the French, British troops took possession of Rodrigues. After British occupation, slavery was eventually abolished in 1834. By 1843, the population had declined to a low of 250.

In 1883, the eruption of the Indonesian volcano Krakatoa was heard at Rodrigues Island and it remains the furthest point, at almost , at which the explosion was heard. The sound was described as &quot;the roar of heavy guns&quot;. Naval ships were ordered to investigate as it was feared the sound was due to a ship in distress firing its guns. The noise remains the loudest sound in recorded history.

In September 1897, solo sailor Joshua Slocum spent eight days on the island. He would later write, &quot;At Rodriguez one may now find every convenience for filling pure and wholesome water in any quantity. Governor Roberts having built a reservoir in the hills, above the village, and laid pipes to the jetty, where, at the time of my visit, there were five and a half feet at high tide. In former years well-water was used, and more or less sickness occurred from it. Beef may be had in any quantity on the island, and at a moderate price. Sweet potatoes were plentiful and cheap; the large sack of them that I bought there for about four shillings kept unusually well. I simply stored them in the sloop&#x27;s dry hold. Of fruits, pomegranates were most plentiful; for two shillings I obtained a large sack of them, as many as a donkey could pack from the orchard, which, by the way, was planted by nature herself.&quot;

Early in 1968, HMS &quot;Cambrian&quot;, which was part of the Beira Patrol following the Unilateral Declaration of Independence of Rhodesia, was diverted to Rodrigues to quell a reported uprising by some of the populace. The uprising consisted of a number of individuals who had been arrested by the local authorities for breaking into a warehouse and appropriating a supply of sweet potatoes. Other locals went to the authorities and by violence released the arrested persons. At this point, it is believed that the authorities requested assistance which was provided by HMS &quot;Cambrian&quot;. On her early morning arrival, the ship&#x27;s 4.5&quot; guns were fired (with blanks, it is believed) and an armed landing party was provided. This resulted in the offenders being rounded up and imprisoned again.

==Geography==
Rodrigues is a volcanic island rising from a ridge along the edge of the Mascarene Plateau. The tectonically active Rodrigues Triple Point lies on the sea-floor nearby. Rodrigues is only 1.5 million years old, even if the plateau under the lagoon surrounding Rodrigues may be much more ancient than the island. Over time Rodrigues has developed a unique environment, including many endemic species.

Rodrigues is situated about to the east of Mauritius. It is about long and wide with an area of . The shape is that of a whale back with a central ridge and deep cut valleys. The island is hilly with a central spine culminating in the highest peak, Mountain Limon at . Rodrigues is the only Mascarene island with extensive limestone deposits and caves. A large fringing reef surrounds the island forming a lagoon within which lie eighteen small islets.

The coral reef of Rodrigues is of particular interest as it is self-seeding – it receives no coral zooplankton from elsewhere. This has led to an overall species-poor but highly adapted ecosystem. A species of coral, two species of &quot;Pomacentrus&quot; damselfish and many species of crustaceans are found only on Rodrigues&#x27; reefs.

===Climate===
The isolation and location of the island give a microclimate specific to Rodrigues, with two seasons. Rodrigues enjoys a mild tropical maritime climate with persistent trade winds blowing throughout the year. Mean summer temperature is and mean winter temperature is around . The temperature difference between summer and winter is 3.6 °C. January to March are the hottest months and August is the coolest month. The wettest month is February; September and October are the driest months. The climate is hotter and drier than in Mauritius. Cyclones may arise from November to April, and Rodrigues is more often hit than Mauritius.

===Biodiversity===
Rodrigues was characterised by endemic plant and animal species in abundance, but since the seventeenth century much of its biodiversity has been eradicated. The island was home to two now-extinct endemic giant tortoises, a domed species (&quot;Cylindraspis peltastes&quot;), and a saddle-backed species (&quot;C. vosmaeri&quot;), and such birds as the Rodrigues solitaire (&quot;Pezophaps solitaria&quot;), a giant flightless pigeon closely related to the dodo of Mauritius, and the Rodrigues night heron (&quot;Nycticorax megacephalus&quot;). An endemic species of bat, the Rodrigues flying fox, is currently listed as endangered on the IUCN Red List. There are two remaining endemic bird species: the Rodrigues fody and the Rodrigues warbler, both are listed as near threatened.

To restore some forest areas, Grande Montagne, Anse Quitor (with neighbouring François Leguat Giant Tortoise Reserve) and two islets, Île aux Sables and Île aux Cocos have been declared nature reserves (under the Forest and Reserves Act 1983). Endangered plants on the reserves include &quot;Zanthoxylum paniculatum&quot;, &quot;Polyscias rodriguesiana&quot;, &quot;Badula balfouriana&quot;, and &quot;Gouania leguatii&quot;.

==Government and politics==

The island of Rodrigues is a constituency of the Republic of Mauritius and is dependent on the latter. However, on 20 November 2001, the Mauritius National Assembly unanimously adopted two laws giving Rodrigues its autonomy, creating a decentralised government system. This new legislation has allowed the implementation of a regional assembly in Rodrigues constituting 18 members and an executive council headed by a Chief Commissioner. The council meets every week to make decisions, draw up laws and manage the budget. The Chief Commissioner has the main task of informing the Mauritian Prime Minister of the management of the island&#x27;s concerns. The last election of the Rodriguan Regional Assembly was held on 27 February 2022. The Alliance (UPR/MIR/PSMD/FPR
) party was the winner and obtained nine seats, while the Organisation du Peuple de Rodrigues (OPR) obtained eight. The President acts as head of state and the Chief Commissioner as head of government on Rodrigues. The current chief commissioner is Johnson Roussety and the Chief Executive of Rodrigues is Pierre Louis Jean Claude.

===Electoral regions===
The island includes six electoral regions: La Ferme (Region 1), Marechal (Region 2), Saint Gabriel (Region 3), Baie aux Huitres (Region 4), Port Mathurin (Region 5) and Grande Montagne (Region 6). Rodrigues Regional Assembly election are held every five years.

===Zones===
Rodrigues is divided into 14 municipalities or zones. For statistical purposes, the zones are further subdivided into a total of 182 localities. The zones have between a minimum of six localities (La Ferme) and maximum of 22 (the capital Port Mathurin).


==Demographics==
The population estimate (as of 18 November 2022) for the island of Rodrigues was 43,650. The main religion is Christianity, dominated by Roman Catholicism with small minorities of other Christian branches, as well as Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses, and there are also Hindus, Muslims and Buddhists. Most of the inhabitants are of African descent and there is a minority of mixed-race peoples, descendants of the first European settlers.

The main language is Rodriguan Creole, but English and French are most used as the languages of government administration, the courts and business. Rodriguan Creole is very similar to Mauritian Creole, though some words are pronounced differently. People born in Rodrigues island are called Rodriguans.

==Education==
The education system in Rodrigues is similar to that throughout the rest of Mauritius. The government provides free education to students up to the tertiary level.
Education is taught mainly in English.

==Transportation==
Rodrigues is served by Sir Gaëtan Duval Airport in Plane Corail, with regular flights to Sir Seewoosagur Ramgoolam International Airport in Plaisance.

==Economy==

The economy of Rodrigues is mostly dependent on Mauritius. The main sources of income and economic activity are tourism, fishing, agriculture (especially of onions, garlic and chilli), and animal rearing. The handicraft industry has proven to be beneficial to the economy of the island. However, the income derived from the export of sea products, cattle, and food crops is smaller than the costs of imported products, creating a deficit.
It has a special relationship with English-speaking countries, such as England in the United Kingdom, Australia and Ireland.
As of 2020, Gross National Income per capita was approximately $16,400.

==Culture==

Cultural awakening which occurred at the end of the 1970s allowed the construction and consolidation of the cultural identity of Rodrigues through the development of these various elements, which form the base of the culture of every nation: food, music, and crafts

===Music and folklore===
The traditional music of the island is known as Sega Tambour. The music has an accentuated beat, usually accompanied by an accordion, clapping and the use of improvised percussion instruments like bamboo. The folk dance music is similar to polkas, quadrilles, waltzes and Scottish reels.

===Cuisine===
Rodrigues cuisine consists of dishes from local products: fruit, vegetables, seafood (fish, octopus, crab, shrimp, lobster) and meat. National dishes include sausages with kreolinės, rougaille sauce, octopus with curry, kono-kono (a shellfish) salad and Rodrigues cake.

===Sports===
The most common sport in Rodrigues is association football. There are local competitions almost throughout the year and in specific competitions, the winning team travels to Mauritius for sport exchange. Volleyball is also popular. There is also a public swimming pool at Marechal, a village located in the center of the island, and a stadium at Camp Du Rois in the region of Port Mathurin.

===Museum===

In 2010, plans were developed by Bernard Eric Typhis Degtyarenko for a private museum on the island, centred on the restoration of the yacht &quot;Admiral Nevelskoi&quot;. The hull of the yacht, belonging to the Maritime State University in Vladivostok, Russia, had been found drifting off Rodrigues in 1997 and brought ashore.

== Sustainability ==
Since 2014, Rodrigues Island has been proactive in environmental conservation, banning plastic bags to safeguard its marine and terrestrial biodiversity. Building on this success and with positive reception from the community, the island extended its eco-friendly measures by prohibiting single-use polystyrene food containers four years later, garnering global acclaim. These efforts complement various initiatives dedicated to preserving the island&#x27;s unique ecosystem.

Crucial among these initiatives is the establishment of reserves, notably the Grande Montagne Nature Reserve at the island&#x27;s center, harboring indigenous fauna and flora. The reserve is vital for monitoring endemic plants such as the &#x27;café maron&#x27; and &#x27;bois blan,&#x27; as well as unique bird species like the Rodriguan Warbler and Rodriguan Fody.

On the western part of Rodrigues, the Francois Leguat Giant Tortoises Reserve and Cave contribute to the rehabilitation of tortoises, including the riadata and Aldabra species. Since 2006, the reserve has been a stalwart in tortoise conservation, now housing over 5,000 tortoises within its 20 hectares. The reserve features a unique landscape of limestone formations, including nine fascinating caves and dolines. One highlight is the remarkable Grande Caverne, outfitted with raised walkways, steps, and eco-friendly lighting. It stands out as the only electrified &quot;Show Cave&quot; in the Southwest Indian Ocean, designed to international standards with the expertise of an Australian cave consultant.

&#x27;Ile aux Cocos,&#x27; another reserve, serves as a protected habitat for seabirds. Through guided tours, visitors gain insights into the destination&#x27;s preservation efforts. Additionally, a sponsorship campaign for reptiles is available at the reserve.

Even during the challenging times of the COVID-19 crisis, the island exhibited resilience. The local government, along with tourism sector workers, contributed to environmental protection. From cleaning hiking paths to restoring islets, these collective efforts upheld Rodrigues&#x27; commitment to conservation.

Tourists played a pivotal role through the Tourism Livelihood Scheme, providing immediate positive impacts. Continuing its ecological journey, Rodrigues Island aims to launch the &#x27;One Tree, One Tourist, and One Child&#x27; project in 2023. This visionary initiative entails planting a tree for every traveler, nurtured by local children. Serving as a model for active involvement in environmental protection, this project fosters an enduring ecological mindset among both tourists and locals, ensuring the ongoing conservation of Rodrigues&#x27; unique environment for generations to come.

<text>John Barry Humphries (17 February 1934 – 22 April 2023) was an Australian comedian, actor, author and satirist. He was best known for writing and playing his stage and television characters Dame Edna Everage and Sir Les Patterson. He appeared in numerous stage productions, films and television shows.

Humphries&#x27;s characters brought him international renown. Originally conceived as a dowdy Moonee Ponds housewife who caricatured Australian suburban complacency and insularity, the Dame Edna Everage character developed into a satire of stardom: a gaudily dressed, acid-tongued, egomaniacal, internationally fêted &quot;housewife gigastar&quot;. His other satirical characters included the &quot;priapic and inebriated cultural attaché&quot; Sir Les Patterson, who &quot;continued to bring worldwide discredit upon Australian arts and culture, while contributing as much to the Australian vernacular as he has borrowed from it&quot;; gentle, grandfatherly &quot;returned gentleman&quot; Sandy Stone; iconoclastic 1960s&#x27; underground film-maker Martin Agrippa; Paddington socialist academic Neil Singleton; sleazy trade-union official Lance Boyle; high-pressure art salesman Morrie O&#x27;Connor; failed tycoon Owen Steele; and archetypal Australian bloke Barry McKenzie.

==Early life==
Humphries was born on 17 February 1934 in the suburb of Kew in Melbourne, Victoria, the son of Eric Humphries (né John Albert Eric Humphries) (1905–1972), a construction manager, and his wife Louisa Agnes (née Brown) (1907–1984). His grandfather John George Humphries was an emigrant to Australia from Manchester, England, in the late 1800s. His father was well-to-do, and Barry grew up in a &quot;clean, tasteful, and modern suburban home&quot; on Christowel Street, Camberwell, then one of Melbourne&#x27;s new &quot;garden suburbs&quot;. His early home life set the pattern for his eventual stage career; his father in particular spent little time with him, and Humphries spent hours playing at dressing-up in the back garden.

His parents nicknamed him &quot;Sunny Sam&quot;, and his early childhood was happy and uneventful. However, in his teens, Humphries began to rebel against the strictures of conventional suburban life by becoming &quot;artistic&quot;, much to the dismay of his parents, who, despite their affluence, distrusted &quot;art&quot;. A key event took place when he was nine – his mother gave all of his books to the Salvation Army, cheerfully explaining: &quot;But you&#x27;ve read them, Barry.&quot; Humphries responded by becoming a voracious reader, a collector of rare books, a painter, a theatre fan and a surrealist. Dressing in a black cloak, black homburg hat and mascaraed eyes, he invented his first sustained character, &quot;Dr Aaron Azimuth&quot;, agent provocateur, dandy and Dadaist.

===Education===
Educated first at Camberwell Grammar School, Humphries was awarded a place in the school&#x27;s gallery of achievement. As his father&#x27;s building business prospered, Humphries was sent to Melbourne Grammar School, where he spurned sport, detested mathematics, shirked cadets &quot;on the basis of conscientious objection&quot; and matriculated with strong results in English and art. Humphries described this schooling, in a &quot;Who&#x27;s Who&quot; entry, as &quot;self-educated, attended Melbourne Grammar School&quot;.

Humphries spent two years studying at the University of Melbourne, where he studied law, philosophy and fine arts. During this time, he was a private in the Melbourne University Regiment, serving a period of national service in the Citizens Military Force of the Australian Army. He did not graduate from university (although he would receive an honorary doctorate almost 50 years later). During this time he became a follower of the deconstructive and absurdist art movement, Dada.

The Dadaist pranks and performances that he mounted in Melbourne were experiments in anarchy and visual satire that have become part of Australian folklore. An exhibit entitled &quot;Puss in Boots&quot; consisted of a pair of Wellington boots filled with custard; a mock pesticide product called &quot;Platytox&quot; claimed on its box to be effective against the platypus, a beloved and protected species in Australia. He was part of a group that made a series of Dada-influenced recordings in Melbourne from 1952 to 1953. &quot;Wubbo Music&quot; (Humphries said that &quot;wubbo&quot; is a pseudo-Aboriginal word meaning &quot;nothing&quot;) is thought to be one of the earliest recordings of experimental music in Australia. Other exhibits the group mounted include &quot;Creche Bang&quot;, a pram covered in meat and &quot;Eye and Spoon Race&quot;, a spoon with a sheep&#x27;s eye.

==Career==
===Early career in Australia===
Humphries had written and performed songs and sketches in university revues, so after leaving university he joined the newly formed Melbourne Theatre Company (MTC). It was at this point that he created the first incarnation of what became his best-known character, Edna Everage. The first stage sketch to feature Mrs. Norm Everage, called &quot;Olympic Hostess&quot;, premiered at Melbourne University&#x27;s Union Theatre on 13 December 1955.

In his award-winning autobiography, &quot;More Please&quot; (1992), Humphries related that he had created a character similar to Edna in the back of a bus while touring country Victoria with &quot;Twelfth Night&quot; with the MTC at the age of 20. He credited his then mentor, Peter O&#x27;Shaughnessy, stating that, without his &quot;nurturing and promotion, the character of Edna Everage would have been nipped in the bud after 1956 and never come to flower, while the character of Sandy Stone would never have taken shape as a presence on the stage&quot;.

In 1957, Humphries moved to Sydney and joined Sydney&#x27;s Phillip Street Theatre, which became Australia&#x27;s leading venue for revue and satirical comedy over the next decade. His first appearance at Phillip Street was in the satirical revue &quot;Two to One&quot;, starring veteran Australian musical star Max Oldaker, with a cast including Humphries and future &quot;Number 96&quot; star Wendy Blacklock. Although he had originally assumed Edna&#x27;s debut Melbourne appearance would be a one-off, Humphries decided to revive &quot;Olympic Hostess&quot; for Phillip Street and its success helped to launch what became a fifty-year career for the self-proclaimed &quot;Housewife Superstar&quot; (later Megastar, then Gigastar).

The next Phillip Street revue was &quot;Around the Loop&quot;, which again teamed Oldaker, Gordon Chater, Blacklock and Humphries, plus newcomer June Salter. Humphries revived the Edna character (for what he said would be the last time) and the revue proved to be a major hit, playing eight shows a week for 14 months. During this period Humphries was living near Bondi and while out walking one day he had a chance meeting with an elderly man who had a high, scratchy voice and a pedantic manner of speech; this encounter inspired the creation of another of Humphries&#x27;s most enduring characters, Sandy Stone.

In September 1957, Humphries appeared as Estragon in &quot;Waiting for Godot&quot;, in Australia&#x27;s first production of the Samuel Beckett play at the Arrow Theatre in Melbourne directed by Peter O&#x27;Shaughnessy who played Vladimir.

In 1958, Humphries and O&#x27;Shaughnessy collaborated on and appeared in the &quot;Rock&#x27;n&#x27;Reel Revue&quot; at the New Theatre in Melbourne, where Humphries brought the characters of Mrs Everage and Sandy Stone into the psyche of Melbourne audiences. In the same year, Humphries made his first commercial recording, the EP &quot;Wild Life in Suburbia&quot;, which featured liner notes by his friend, the Modernist architect and writer Robin Boyd.

===London and the 1960s===
In 1959, Humphries moved to London, where he lived and worked throughout the 1960s. He became a friend of leading members of the British comedy scene including Dudley Moore, Peter Cook, Alan Bennett, Jonathan Miller, Spike Milligan, Willie Rushton and fellow Australian expatriate comedian-actors John Bluthal and Dick Bentley. Humphries performed at Cook&#x27;s comedy venue The Establishment, where he became a friend of and was photographed by leading photographer Lewis Morley, whose studio was located above the club.

Humphries contributed to the satirical magazine &quot;Private Eye&quot;, of which Cook was publisher, his best-known work being the cartoon strip &quot;The Wonderful World of Barry McKenzie&quot;. The bawdy cartoon satire of the worst aspects of Australians abroad was written by Humphries and drawn by New Zealand-born cartoonist Nicholas Garland. The book version of the comic strip, published in the late 1960s, was for some time banned by the Australian government because it &quot;relied on indecency for its humour&quot;.

Humphries appeared in numerous West End stage productions including the musicals &quot;Oliver!&quot; and &quot;Maggie May&quot;, by Lionel Bart, and in stage and radio productions by his friend Spike Milligan. At one time, he was invited to play the leading role of Captain Martin Bules in &quot;The Bedsitting Room&quot;, which had already opened successfully at the Mermaid Theatre and was transferring to the West End. Humphries performed with Milligan in the 1968 production of &quot;Treasure Island&quot; in the role of Long John Silver. He described working with Milligan as &quot;one of the strangest and most exhilarating experiences of my career&quot;.

In 1961, when Humphries was in Cornwall with his wife, he fell over a cliff near Zennor and landed on a ledge 50 m (150 ft) below, breaking bones. The rescue by helicopter was filmed by a news crew from ITN. The footage of the rescue was shown to Humphries for the first time on a 2006 BBC show, &quot;Turn Back Time&quot;.

Humphries&#x27;s first major break on the British stage came when he was cast in the role of the undertaker Mr Sowerberry for the original 1960 London stage production of &quot;Oliver!&quot; He recorded Sowerberry&#x27;s feature number &quot;That&#x27;s Your Funeral&quot; for the original London cast album (released on Decca Records) and reprised the role when the production moved to Broadway in 1963. However, the song &quot;That&#x27;s Your Funeral&quot; was omitted from the RCA Victor original Broadway cast album, so Humphries is not heard at all on it. In 1967, he starred as Fagin in the Piccadilly Theatre&#x27;s revival of &quot;Oliver!&quot;, which featured a young Phil Collins as the Artful Dodger. In 1997, Humphries reprised the role of Fagin in Cameron Mackintosh&#x27;s award-winning revival at the London Palladium.

In 1967, his friendship with Cook and Moore led to his first film role, a cameo as &quot;Envy&quot; in the film &quot;Bedazzled&quot;, starring Cook and Moore, with Eleanor Bron and directed by Stanley Donen. The following year, he appeared in &quot;The Bliss of Mrs. Blossom&quot;, with Shirley MacLaine.

Humphries contributed to BBC Television&#x27;s &quot;The Late Show&quot; (1966–67), but Humphries found his true calling with his one-man satirical stage revues, in which he performed as Edna Everage and other character creations including Sandy Stone. &quot;A Nice Night&#x27;s Entertainment&quot; (1962) was the first such revue. It and &quot;Excuse I: Another Nice Night&#x27;s Entertainment&quot; (1965) were only performed in Australia. In 1968 Humphries returned to Australia to tour his one-man revue &quot;Just a Show&quot;; this production transferred to London&#x27;s Fortune Theatre in 1969. Humphries gained considerable notoriety with &quot;Just a Show&quot;. It polarised British critics but was successful enough to lead to a short-lived BBC television series, &quot;The Barry Humphries Scandals&quot;.

===1970s===
In 1970, Humphries returned to Australia, where Edna Everage made her movie debut in John B. Murray&#x27;s &quot;The Naked Bunyip&quot;. In 1971–72 he teamed up with producer Phillip Adams and writer-director Bruce Beresford to create a film version of the Barry McKenzie cartoons. &quot;The Adventures of Barry McKenzie&quot; starred singer Barry Crocker in the title role and featured Humphries—who co-wrote the script with Beresford—playing three different parts. It was filmed in England and Australia with an all-star cast including Spike Milligan, Peter Cook, Dennis Price, Dick Bentley, Willie Rushton, Julie Covington, Clive James and broadcaster Joan Bakewell. It was almost unanimously panned by Australian film critics, but became a huge hit with audiences. The film became the first Australian feature film to make more than $1 million at the box office, paving the way for the success of subsequent locally made feature films such as &quot;Alvin Purple&quot; and &quot;Picnic at Hanging Rock&quot;. It has been argued that Humphries was the first &quot;proper&quot; movie star of the Australian movie revival and was under-used as a star of local films.

Another artistic production undertaken at this time was a 1972 collaboration between Humphries and the Australian composer Nigel Butterley. Together, they produced &quot;First Day Covers&quot;, a collection of poems about suburbia – read in performance by Edna Everage – with accompanying music by Butterley. It included poems with titles such as &quot;Histoire du Lamington&quot; and &quot;Morceau en forme de &#x27;meat pie&#x27;&quot;.

===Film roles===
From the late 1960s, Humphries appeared in numerous films, mostly in supporting or cameo roles. His credits included &quot;Bedazzled&quot; (1967), the UK sex comedy &quot;Percy&#x27;s Progress&quot; (1974), David Baker&#x27;s &quot;The Great Macarthy&quot; (1975), and Bruce Beresford&#x27;s &quot;Barry McKenzie Holds His Own&quot; (1974), in which Edna was made a dame by then Australian prime minister Gough Whitlam.

His other film credits included &quot;Side by Side&quot; (1975) and &quot;The Getting of Wisdom&quot; (1977). The same year, he had a cameo as Edna in the Robert Stigwood musical film &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot;, followed in 1981 by his part as the fake-blind TV-show host Bert Schnick in &quot;Shock Treatment&quot;, the sequel to &quot;The Rocky Horror Picture Show&quot;.

Humphries was more successful with his featured role as Richard Deane in &quot;Dr. Fischer of Geneva&quot; (1985); this was followed by &quot;Howling III&quot; (1987), a cameo as Rupert Murdoch in the miniseries &quot;Selling Hitler&quot; (1991) with Alexei Sayle, a three-role cameo in Philippe Mora&#x27;s horror satire &quot;Pterodactyl Woman from Beverly Hills&quot; (1995), the role of Count Metternich in &quot;Immortal Beloved&quot; (1994), as well as roles in &quot;The Leading Man&quot; (1996), the Spice Girls&#x27; film &quot;Spice World&quot;, the Australian feature &quot;Welcome to Woop Woop&quot; (1997), and &quot;Nicholas Nickleby&quot; (2002), in which he donned female garb to play Nathan Lane&#x27;s wife.

Humphries featured in various roles in comedy performance films including &quot;The Secret Policeman&#x27;s Other Ball&quot; (1982) and &quot;A Night of Comic Relief 2&quot; (1989). In 1987, he starred as Les Patterson in one of his own rare flops, &quot;Les Patterson Saves the World&quot;, directed by George T. Miller of &quot;Man From Snowy River&quot; fame and co-written by Humphries with his third wife, Diane Millstead.

In 2003, Humphries voiced the shark Bruce in the Pixar animated film &quot;Finding Nemo&quot;, using an exaggerated baritone Australian accent.

During 2011, Humphries travelled to New Zealand to perform the role of the Great Goblin in the first instalment of Peter Jackson&#x27;s three-part adaptation of J. R. R. Tolkien&#x27;s &quot;The Hobbit&quot;. At the press conference in Wellington, New Zealand, just before the film&#x27;s world premiere, Humphries commented:

In 2015, Humphries voiced the role of Wombo the Wombat in &quot;Blinky Bill the Movie&quot;.

In 2016, he appeared in a dual role in &quot;Absolutely Fabulous: The Movie&quot; as Charlie, a rich former lover of Patsy Stone, and in a nonspeaking cameo as Dame Edna.

===One-man shows===
Humphries&#x27;s forte was always his one-man satirical stage revues, in which he appeared as Edna Everage and other character creations, most commonly Les Patterson and Sandy Stone. The longevity of Dame Edna endured for more than sixty years, but, in 2012, he announced his retirement from live performance.

Humphries&#x27;s one-man shows, which were typically two and a half hours long, alternated satirical monologues and musical numbers and consisted of entirely original material, laced with ad-libbing, improvisation and audience participation segments. Humphries mostly performed solo, but he was occasionally joined on stage by supporting dancers and an accompanist during the musical numbers. Only one actor ever regularly shared the stage with Humphries, and this was during the Edna segments: English actress Emily Perry played Edna&#x27;s long-suffering bridesmaid from New Zealand, Madge Allsop, whose character never spoke.

Humphries presented many successful shows in London, most of which he subsequently toured internationally. Although he eventually gained worldwide popularity, he encountered stiff resistance in the early years of his career: his first London one-man show, &quot;A Nice Night&#x27;s Entertainment&quot; (1962), received scathing reviews. He gained considerable notoriety with his next one-man revue, &quot;Just a Show&quot;, staged at London&#x27;s Fortune Theatre in 1969. It polarised the critics but was a hit with audiences and became the basis of a growing cult following in the UK. He further developed the character of Edna Everage in his early-1970s&#x27; shows, including &quot;A Load of Olde Stuffe&quot; (1971) and &quot;At Least You Can Say You&#x27;ve Seen It&quot; (1974–75).

He finally broke through to widespread critical and audience acclaim in Britain with his 1976 London production &quot;Housewife, Superstar!&quot; at the Apollo Theatre. Its success in Britain and Australia led Humphries to try his luck with the show in New York City in 1977 at the off-Broadway Theatre Four (now called the Julia Miles Theatre), but it proved to be a disastrous repeat of his experience with &quot;Just a Show&quot;. Humphries later summed up his negative reception by saying: &quot;When &quot;The New York Times&quot; tells you to close, you close.&quot;

His next show was &quot;Isn&#x27;t It Pathetic at His Age&quot; (1978), and, like many of his shows, the title derives from the sarcastic remarks his mother often made when she took Humphries to the theatre to see superannuated overseas actors touring in Australia during his youth.

His subsequent one-man shows included:
* &quot;A Night with Dame Edna&quot; (1979), for which he won an Olivier Award for Best Comedy Performance
* &quot;An Evening&#x27;s Intercourse with Dame Edna&quot; (1982)
* &quot;Back with a Vengeance&quot; (1987–1989, 2005–2007)
* &quot;Look at Me When I&#x27;m Talking to You&quot; (1996)
* &quot;Edna, The Spectacle&quot; (1998) at the Theatre Royal Haymarket, where he held the record as the only solo act to fill the theatre (since it opened in 1720)
* &quot;Remember You&#x27;re Out&quot; which toured Australia in 1999
* &quot;Dame Edna Live: The First Last Tour&quot; toured the US in 2009

He made numerous theatrical tours in Germany, Scandinavia, the Netherlands, and the Far and Middle East. In 2003, he toured Australia with his show &quot;Getting Back to My Roots (and Other Suckers)&quot;.

For his delivery of Dadaist and absurdist humour to millions, his biographer Anne Pender described Humphries in 2010 as not only &quot;the most significant theatrical figure of our time ... [but] the most significant comedian to emerge since Charlie Chaplin&quot;.

===Television roles===
Humphries&#x27;s numerous television appearances in Australia, the UK and the U.S. included &quot;The Bunyip&quot;, a children&#x27;s comedy for the Seven Network in Melbourne. In the UK, he made two highly successful series of his comedy talk show &quot;The Dame Edna Experience&quot; for London Weekend Television. The series featured a variety of famous guests, including Liza Minnelli, Sean Connery, Roger Moore, Dusty Springfield, Charlton Heston, Lauren Bacall, and Jane Seymour.

These highly popular programmes have since been repeated worldwide, and the special &quot;A Night on Mount Edna&quot; won Humphries the &quot;Golden Rose of Montreux&quot; in 1991. He wrote and starred in ABC-TV&#x27;s &quot;The Life and Death of Sandy Stone&quot; (1991), and presented the ABC social history series &quot;Barry Humphries&#x27; Flashbacks&quot; (1998).

His other television shows and one-off specials include &quot;Dame Edna&#x27;s Neighbourhood Watch&quot; (1992), &quot;Dame Edna&#x27;s Work Experience&quot; (1996), &quot;Dame Edna Kisses It Better&quot; (1997) and &quot;Dame Edna&#x27;s Hollywood&quot; (1991–92), a series of three chat-show specials filmed in the U.S. for the NBC and the Fox network. Like &quot;The Dame Edna Experience&quot;, these included an array of top celebrity guests such as Burt Reynolds, Cher, Bea Arthur, Kim Basinger and Barry Manilow. Edna&#x27;s most recent television special was &quot;Dame Edna Live at the Palace&quot; in 2003. He starred in the Kath &amp; Kim telemovie &quot;Da Kath &amp; Kim Code&quot; in late 2005.

In 1977, Dame Edna guest-starred on the U.S. sketch comedy and variety show &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;.

In 2007, Humphries returned to the UK&#x27;s ITV to host another comedy chat show called &quot;The Dame Edna Treatment&quot;, a similar format to &quot;The Dame Edna Experience&quot; from 20 years earlier. The series once again had a collection of high-profile celebrity guests, such as Tim Allen, Mischa Barton, Sigourney Weaver, Debbie Harry, and Shirley Bassey.

In March 2008, Humphries joined the judging panel on the BBC talent show &quot;I&#x27;d Do Anything&quot; to find an unknown lead to play the part of Nancy in a West End revival of the musical &quot;Oliver!&quot;.

In May 2013, Australia&#x27;s ABC Network announced that Humphries would be joining the cast of the Australian telemovie series, &quot;Jack Irish&quot;, playing a high-profile judge in the third movie in the series. He appeared as Justice Loder in the 2014 &quot;Dead Point&quot; episode.

===Success in the United States===

In 2000 Humphries took his &quot;Dame Edna: The Royal Tour&quot; show to North America winning the inaugural Special Tony Award for a Live Theatrical Event in 2000 and won two National Broadway Theatre Awards for &quot;Best Play&quot; and for &quot;Best Actor&quot; in 2001. Asked by an Australian journalist what it was like to win a Tony Award, he said &quot;it was like winning a thousand Gold Logies at the same time&quot;.

Dame Edna&#x27;s new-found success in the United States led to many media opportunities, including a semi-regular role in the hit TV series &quot;Ally McBeal&quot;. &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; magazine invited Dame Edna to write a satirical advice column in 2003, although, after an outcry following a remark about learning Spanish, the column was discontinued.

As of September 2021, Humphries was honorary vice-president of the American Guild of Variety Artists trade union.

===Farewell tour===

In March 2012, Humphries announced his retirement from live entertainment, stating that he was &quot;beginning to feel a bit senior&quot; and was planning to retire from show business. Humphries announced his Australian &quot;Farewell Tour&quot;, titled &quot;Eat, Pray, Laugh!&quot;, to begin in Canberra on 22 July 2012 and to conclude in Perth on 3 February 2013, although it was extended until 10 February. The show included appearances by Dame Edna, Sir Les Patterson and Sandy Stone, and introduced a new character called Gerard Patterson, Sir Les&#x27;s brother and a paedophilic Catholic priest.

The tour was widely praised. Dan Ilic of &quot;Time Out Sydney&quot; stated that Humphries delivered &quot;a show that almost feels like a blueprint for the foundations for the last fifty years of Australian comedy&quot;. Helen Musa of &quot;CityNews&quot; gave a similarly positive review, referring to Humphries being &quot;as virile, as vulgar and as magnificent as ever&quot; thanks to a &quot;well researched&quot; script. Arts blog &quot;Critter Away&quot; referred to Humphries&#x27; characters as being &quot;still fresh&quot; and &quot;a testament to laugh-out-loud satire&quot;.

The same show opened in the United Kingdom at the Milton Keynes Theatre in October 2013 prior to a season of shows at the London Palladium and a national tour.

===Weimar Cabaret===
Humphries emceed a program of Weimar Republic cabaret songs performed by chanteuse Meow Meow and accompanied by the Australian Chamber Orchestra in July–August 2016 and then by the Aurora Orchestra in July 2018.

==Characters==
===Dame Edna Everage===

Humphries was probably best known for his persona Dame Edna Everage. Originally conceived in 1956, Edna evolved from a satire of Australian suburbia to become, in the words of journalist Caroline Overington:

Like her ever-present bunches of gladioli, one of the most popular and distinctive features of Edna&#x27;s stage and TV appearances was her extravagant wardrobe, with gaudy, custom-made gowns. Her costumes, most of which were created for her by Australian designer Bill Goodwin, routinely incorporated Aussie kitsch icons such as the flag, Australian native animals and flowers, the Sydney Opera House and the boxing kangaroo. Her outlandish spectacles were inspired by the glasses worn by the Melbourne eccentric, actor and dancer Stephanie Deste, as were many other aspects of Dame Edna&#x27;s personality.

As the character evolved, Edna&#x27;s unseen family became an integral part of the satire, particularly the travails of her disabled husband Norm, who had an almost lifelong onslaught of an unspecified prostate ailment. Her daughter Valmai and her gay hairdresser son Kenny became intrinsic elements of the act, as did her long-suffering best friend and New Zealand bridesmaid, Madge Allsop.

Throughout Edna&#x27;s career, Madge was played by English actress Emily Perry, until Perry&#x27;s death in 2008. Perry was the only other actor ever to appear on stage with Humphries in his stage shows, as well as making regular appearances in Dame Edna&#x27;s TV programmes.

Dame Edna made a successful transition from stage to TV. The talk-show format provided an outlet for Humphries&#x27; ability to ad-lib in character, and it enabled Edna to reach a wider range audience. As other Australian actors have begun to make a wider impression internationally, Edna did not hesitate to reveal that it was her mentorship that helped &quot;kiddies&quot; like &quot;little Nicole Kidman&quot; to achieve their early success.

=== Sir Les Patterson ===
Humphries&#x27;s character, Sir Les Patterson, was a boozy Australian cultural attaché: dishevelled, uncouth, lecherous and coarse. He alternated with Edna and Sandy Stone in Humphries&#x27;s stage shows and typically featured in pre-recorded segments in Dame Edna&#x27;s TV shows. Sir Les was the polar opposite of Dame Edna; she was a culturally aspirational Protestant from Melbourne and he was a culture-free Roman Catholic from Sydney. In December 1987, Humphries appeared on the BBC Radio 4 program &quot;Today&quot; in a recorded interview in which he simultaneously played the characters of both Dame Edna and Sir Les.

=== Sandy Stone ===
Humphries&#x27;s character, Sandy Stone, was an elderly Australian man, either single or married with a daughter who died as a child. Humphries said in 2016 that &quot;slowly the character has deepened, so I begin to understand and appreciate him, and finally feel myself turning into him&quot;. As Humphries aged, he no longer required makeup for the part and played Sandy in his own dressing gown.

==Personal life==
Humphries was married four times. His first marriage, to Brenda Wright, took place when he was 21 and lasted less than two years. He had two daughters, Tessa and Emily, and two sons, Oscar and Rupert, from his second and third marriages to Rosalind Tong and Diane Millstead respectively. His elder son, Oscar, was editor of the art magazine &quot;Apollo&quot; and a contributing editor at &quot;The Spectator&quot;. He is now an art curator. His fourth wife (from 1990 until his death in 2023), Elizabeth Spender, previously an actor, is the daughter of British poet Sir Stephen Spender and the concert pianist Natasha Spender. They lived in a terraced townhouse in South Hampstead, his home for forty years.

In the 1960s, Humphries was dependent on alcohol, and in a 2004 interview with Andrew Barrow, described himself as having been &quot;a dissolute, guilt-ridden, self-pitying boozer&quot;. His alcoholism reached a crisis point during a visit home to Australia in the early 1970s. His parents finally had him admitted to a private hospital to &#x27;dry out&#x27;, when, after a particularly heavy binge, he was found battered and unconscious in a gutter. After that incident, he abstained from alcohol completely and occasionally attended Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) meetings. He was one of the many friends who tried in vain to help Peter Cook, who himself eventually died from alcohol-related illnesses.

Humphries was a friend of the English poet John Betjeman until Betjeman&#x27;s death in 1984. Their friendship began in 1960, after Betjeman, while visiting Australia, heard some of Humphries&#x27;s early recordings and wrote very favourably of them in an Australian newspaper. Their friendship was, in part, based on numerous shared interests, including Victorian architecture, Cornwall and the music hall.

Humphries appeared in the 2013 documentary &quot;Chalky&quot; about his longtime friend and colleague Michael White, who produced many of Humphries&#x27; first Dame Edna shows in the UK.

Other notable friends of Humphries included the painter Arthur Boyd, the author and former politician Jeffrey Archer, whom Humphries visited during Archer&#x27;s stay in prison, and the comedian Spike Milligan.

Humphries spent much of his life immersed in music, literature and the arts. A self-proclaimed &#x27;bibliomaniac&#x27;, his house in West Hampstead, London, supposedly contained some 25,000 books, many of them first editions of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Some of the more arcane and rare items in this collection include the telephone book of Oscar Wilde, &quot;Memoirs of a Public Baby&quot; by Philip O&#x27;Connor, an autographed copy of &quot;Humdrum&quot; by Harold Acton, the complete works of Wilfred Childe and several volumes of the pre-war surrealist poetry of Herbert Read. He was elected a member of the Roxburghe Club, an elite bibliophilic society, in 2011.

Humphries was a prominent art collector who, as a result of his three divorces, bought many of his favourite paintings four times. He at one time had the largest private collection of the paintings of Charles Conder in the world and he was a great admirer of the Flemish symbolist painter Jan Frans De Boever, relishing his role as &#x27;President for Life&#x27; of the De Boever Society. He himself was a landscape painter and his pictures are in private and public collections both in his homeland and abroad. Humphries was also the subject of numerous portraits by artist friends, including Clifton Pugh (1958, National Portrait Gallery) and John Brack (in the character of Edna Everage, 1969, Art Gallery of New South Wales).

Humphries enjoyed avant-garde music and was a patron of, among others, the French composer Jean-Michel Damase and the Melba Foundation in Australia. Humphries was a patron and active supporter of the Tait Memorial Trust in London, a charity to support young Australian performing artists in the UK. When Humphries was a guest on the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Desert Island Discs&quot; radio programme in 2009, he made the following choices: &quot;&quot; from Strauss&#x27; &quot;Der Rosenkavalier&quot;; Gershwin&#x27;s &quot;Things are Looking Up&quot; sung by Fred Astaire; &quot;Love Song&quot; composed by Josef Suk; &quot;On Mother Kelly&#x27;s Doorstep&quot; sung by Randolph Sutton; &quot;&quot; from Schubert&#x27;s &quot;Winterreise&quot; song cycle; the 2nd movement of Poulenc&#x27;s Flute Sonata; Mischa Spoliansky&#x27;s &quot;&quot;; and &quot;They are not long the weeping and the laughter&quot; from Delius&#x27; &quot;Songs of Sunset&quot;.

Cultural historian Tony Moore, author of &quot;The Barry McKenzie Movies&quot;, writes of Humphries&#x27; personal politics thus: &quot;A conservative contrarian while many in his generation were moving left, Humphries nevertheless retained a bohemian delight in transgression that makes him a radical.&quot;

Humphries had two brothers and a sister in Melbourne. His brother Christopher worked as an architect, his brother Michael (1946–2020) was a teacher and historian, and his sister Barbara is also a former schoolteacher.

===Views on transgender people===
In 2018, Humphries was criticised on social media for making comments considered by some to be transphobic. The comments included referring to gender-affirmation surgery as &quot;self-mutilation&quot; and transgender identity as a whole as a &quot;fashion—how many different kinds of lavatory can you have?&quot; The comments prompted the Barry Award, a comedy festival award in Melbourne named after the comedian, to be renamed the Melbourne International Comedy Festival Award the next year.

===Death===
Following a fall in February of the same year, Humphries died after complications from hip surgery at St Vincent&#x27;s Hospital in Darlinghurst, Sydney, on 22 April 2023, at the age of 89. After his funeral, he was sent to Northern Suburbs Memorial Gardens and Crematorium for cremation. His remains were scattered in an undisclosed place.
Tributes to Humphries were given by members of the British royal family including Charles III and Sarah, Duchess of York, and by Australian prime minister Anthony Albanese and Western Australian premier Mark McGowan. Tributes were also given by members of the entertainment industry including Michael Parkinson, Eric Idle and Ricky Gervais.

<text>Sima Yi ( ; 179 CE7 September 251 CE), courtesy name Zhongda, was a Chinese military general, politician, and regent of the state of Cao Wei during the Three Kingdoms period of China.

He formally began his political career in 208 under the Han dynasty&#x27;s Imperial Chancellor Cao Cao, and was quickly promoted to higher office. His success in handling domestic and military affairs such as governance and the promotion of agriculture, serving as an adviser, repelling incursions and invasions led by Shu and Wu forces, speedily defeating Meng Da&#x27;s Xincheng Rebellion, and conquering the Gongsun-led Liaodong commandery, garnered him great prestige. He is perhaps best known for defending Wei from a series of invasions that were led by Wei&#x27;s rival state Shu between 231 and 234.

In 239, along with another co-regent Cao Shuang, he was made to preside as a regent for the young Cao Fang after the death of latter&#x27;s adoptive father, Cao Rui. Although amicable at first, the relationship soon deteriorated in light of Cao Shuang&#x27;s corruption, extravagance, and attempts to curtail Sima Yi&#x27;s political influence. In February 249, after carefully planning and building up support, Sima Yi ousted Cao Shuang from power in a coup d&#x27;état and had him and his associates executed.

Afterwards, Sima Yi became the primary authority in Wei, although in June 251 he faced some opposition from Wang Ling&#x27;s rebellion, which he swiftly dealt with. Sima Yi died on 7 September 251, at the age of 71 or 72, and was succeeded by his eldest son Sima Shi.

For the remainder of Wei&#x27;s history, state power was increasingly vested in the Sima clan, which led to the establishment of the Jin dynasty, which was founded by Sima Yi&#x27;s grandson Sima Yan in February 266. After Sima Yan became emperor, he honoured his grandfather with the posthumous title Emperor Xuan of Jin and the temple name Gaozu. He was also the last common ancestor of all emperors of the Jin dynasty; while emperors of the Western Jin descended from Sima Zhao (his son with wife Zhang Chunhua), emperors of the Eastern Jin descended from Sima Zhou (his son with concubine Lady Fu).

==Family background==
Sima Yi&#x27;s ancestral home was in Xiaojing (), Wen County, Henei Commandery. His ancestor was Sima Ang the King of Yin (), who briefly ruled one of the Eighteen Kingdoms during the transition period from the Qin dynasty to the Western Han dynasty before Liu Bang&#x27;s general Han Xin conquered his territory, capturing Sima Ang and his capital city Zhaoge. In the early Han dynasty, Sima Ang&#x27;s former kingdom, which was largely situated in Henei, became a commandery of the Han Empire and his descendants had lived there since.

Sima Jūn (), an eighth-generation descendant of Sima Ang and the great-great-grandfather of Sima Yi, served as a general of the Han Empire, holding the position General Who Conquers the West (). Sima Jūn&#x27;s son Sima Liang () held the position Grand Administrator of Yuzhang, and Sima Liang&#x27;s son Sima Jùn () served as Grand Administrator of Yingchuan. Sima Jùn&#x27;s son Sima Fang served as the Prefect of Luoyang (), Intendant of Jingzhao, and later as Cavalry Commandant () towards the end of the Eastern Han dynasty. Sima Yi was Sima Fang&#x27;s second son.

Sima Yi had one elder brother Sima Lang (Boda) and six younger brothers. The eight Sima brothers were collectively known as the &quot;Eight &quot;Da&quot;s&quot; because their courtesy names all ended with &quot;da&quot; ().

==Early life==
Sima Yi displayed intelligence and great ambitions at a young age. He was knowledgeable and well-versed in Confucian classics. When chaos broke out in China towards the End of the Han dynasty, Sima Yi often expressed sympathy and concern for the people. Before he reached adulthood around the age of 19, Sima Yi once met Yang Jun, a commandery administrator who was known for spotting talents. Yang Jun described him as an &quot;extraordinary talent&quot;. Cui Yan, a friend of Sima Yi&#x27;s elder brother, Sima Lang, once said: &quot;(Sima Yi) is intelligent, decisive, and unique. (Sima Lang) can&#x27;t be compared to him.&quot;

Sima Yi and his family used to live in the imperial capital, Luoyang, where his father, Sima Fang, served as a government official. Sima Yi was raised in a strict Confucian manner: He was not allowed to visit his father unless summoned, to speak to his father without being explicitly addressed, and neither was he allowed to be seated in the same room as his father. In 190, when the warlord Dong Zhuo dominated the Han central government and wanted to relocate the imperial capital to Chang&#x27;an, Sima Fang ordered Sima Lang to bring the Sima family out of Luoyang and return to their ancestral home in Wen County, Henei Commandery. Some months later, as Sima Lang foresaw that chaos would break out in Henei Commandery, he relocated his family to Liyang Commandery (黎陽郡; around present-day Xun County, Henan), where they stayed with Sima Lang&#x27;s kinsman, Zhao Weisun. In 194, when war broke out between the warlords Cao Cao and Lü Bu, Sima Lang brought his family out of Liyang Commandery and again returned to their now-ravaged ancestral home in Wen County, Henei Commandery, where Sima Yi and his brothers largely sustained themselves by living as farmers; fending off local groups of bandits while studying diligently during their free time.

Around 201, the administrative office of Henei Commandery nominated Sima Yi to serve in the government by holding local office, possibly as a clerk in charge of the records, and in 202 he was sent as a Reporting Officer () to the capital. Around the same year, he married a woman named Zhang Chunhua, possibly at the instigation of his father. At the same time, the warlord Cao Cao, who then held the position of Minister of Works in the Han imperial court, heard of Sima Yi&#x27;s talent and wanted to recruit him to serve in the administration. Sima Yi declined, presumably on grounds of illness, with the &quot;Book of Jin&quot; more specifically mentioning that he, seeing that the Han Empire&#x27;s future was bleak, declined and lied by supposedly saying that he suffered from paralysis; staying at home, with Cao Cao&#x27;s spies reporting that they saw Sima Yi lying motionless in bed.

One day—in a story that may be apocryphal—while Sima Yi was drying his books under the sun, there was a sudden downpour, so he rushed out to grab his books and was seen by a maid. Sima Yi&#x27;s wife, Zhang Chunhua, feared that the maid would leak out news that Sima Yi was well and get their family into trouble, so she killed the maid to silence her.

==Service under Cao Cao==
When Cao Cao became the Imperial Chancellor in 208, he sent an official to recruit Sima Yi to serve as an assistant clerk in his administration, and is said to have instructed the official to arrest Sima Yi if he dawdled. Sima Yi became afraid and accepted the appointment. Although he was initially assigned to be an attendant to the crown prince, he was later reassigned to other positions, including Gentleman of the Yellow Gate (), Consultant (), Officer in the East Bureau of the Imperial Chancellor&#x27;s Office (), and Registrar in the Imperial Chancellor&#x27;s Office ().

===Advising Cao Cao to attack Yi Province===
In 215, Sima Yi accompanied Cao Cao on his campaign against the warlord-pope Zhang Lu, whom Cao Cao defeated at the Battle of Yangping in Hanzhong Commandery. Afterwards Sima Yi urged him to capitalise on the momentum and attack his rival Liu Bei, who was in the neighboring Yi Province. Sima Yi said because Liu Bei had only recently seized control of Yi Province from Liu Zhang, he had yet to establish a strong foothold in the province. Cao Cao rejected Sima Yi&#x27;s idea and said he was already content with having Longyou (; covering parts of present-day Gansu and Shaanxi). He then turned his attention to his other key rival Sun Quan.

===Urging Cao Cao to usurp the throne===
Sun Quan sent an emissary to meet Cao Cao, asking to make peace and expressing his willingness to pledge allegiance to Cao Cao. He also urged Cao Cao to seize the throne from Emperor Xian and declare himself emperor. In response to Sun Quan&#x27;s suggestion, Cao Cao remarked; &quot;This kid wants me to put myself on top of a fire!&quot; Sima Yi told him: &quot;The Han dynasty nears its end. Your Lordship controls nine-tenths of the Han Empire. You are in a position to take the throne. Sun Quan&#x27;s submission is the will of Heaven.&quot; Previously, during Yu&#x27;s time and throughout the Xia, Yin, and Zhou dynasties, the rulers who did not hesitate when they should take the throne were the ones who truly understood Heaven&#x27;s will. Cao Cao did not usurp the throne from Emperor Xian and remained a subject of the Han Empire until his death.

In 216, after Emperor Xian promoted Cao Cao from a duke to a vassal king under the title &quot;King of Wei&quot;, Sima Yi became an adviser to Cao Cao&#x27;s son and heir apparent, Cao Pi, who highly regarded and respected Sima Yi for his brilliance. Along with Chen Qun, Wu Zhi, and Zhu Shuo (朱鑠), Sima Yi was one of Cao Pi&#x27;s close aides and one of his &quot;Four Friends&quot;. Before Cao Pi became his father&#x27;s heir apparent in 216, he was engaged in a power struggle with his younger brother Cao Zhi over the succession. During this time, Sima Yi was believed to have secretly backed Cao Pi and helped him win the position of heir apparent. He was also partly responsible for Cao Zhi&#x27;s demotion and removal from politics after Cao Pi became emperor.

When Sima Yi was appointed as an Army Major (), he suggested to Cao Cao to stockpile food supplies and maintain their defences because there were more than 200,000 people who were unable to sustain themselves through farming. Cao Cao accepted his idea and implemented a policy for the people to farm and stockpile grain.

===Battle of Fancheng===
Sima Yi warned Cao Cao about Hu Xiu () and Fu Fang (), who respectively served as the Inspector of Jing Province and the Administrator of Nanxiang Commandery (南鄉郡; in Jing Province) at the time. Sima Yi said Hu Xiu was violent and Fu Fang was arrogant, and that neither should not be entrusted with the responsibility of guarding the border at Jing Province, but Cao Cao ignored him. In 219, during the Battle of Fancheng, while Cao Cao&#x27;s general Cao Ren was besieged by Liu Bei&#x27;s general Guan Yu in Fancheng, Cao Cao ordered Yu Jin to lead reinforcements to lift the siege on Fancheng. The reinforcements were killed in a flood and Yu Jin surrendered to Guan Yu. As Sima Yi foresaw, Hu Xiu and Fu Fang defected to Guan Yu, placing Cao Ren in a more perilous situation.

Upon learning of Yu Jin&#x27;s defeat, Cao Cao felt the Han imperial capital Xuchang was too near enemy territory so he considered moving the capital further north into Hebei. Sima Yi and Jiang Ji said; &quot;Yu Jin&#x27;s defeat ... was not due to flaws in our defences, nor will it significantly affect us. Moving the imperial capital is showing our weakness to the enemy. It will cause unrest in the regions around the Huai and Mian rivers. Sun Quan and Liu Bei seem close to each other, but they actually don&#x27;t trust each other. Sun Quan will feel very uneasy upon seeing Guan Yu&#x27;s victory, so we should incite him to attack Guan Yu&#x27;s base in Jing Province. This will lift the siege on Fancheng.&quot; Cao Cao heeded their advice and Sun Quan later sent his general Lü Meng to attack Gong&#x27;an County and invade Jing Province in the winter of 219–220. Sun Quan&#x27;s forces captured and executed Guan Yu.

Cao Cao wanted to relocate residents in Jing Province and Yingchuan Commandery further north as he felt they were too close to enemy territory in the south. Sima Yi, however, advised him against doing so and said; &quot;The Jing and Chu regions are unstable. The people are easy to move but hard to pacify. As Guan Yu has been recently defeated, bad people will go into hiding. If we move the good people, we might cause them to feel distressed and unwilling to return to our side.&quot; Cao Cao heeded Sima Yi&#x27;s advice. The people affected by the Battle of Fancheng reverted to their original livelihoods after the battle.

When Cao Cao died in Luoyang in March 220, there was apprehension in the imperial court. Sima Yi supervised the funerary arrangements to ensure everything would be carried out in an orderly fashion, and accompanied the funeral cortège to Ye, earning the respect of officials within and outside the central government.

==Service under Cao Pi==

After Cao Pi succeeded his father as the vassal King of Wei and Imperial Chancellor of the Han Empire in early 220, he enfeoffed Sima Yi as Village Marquis of Hejin () and appointed him as his Chief Clerk ().

Later, when Sun Quan led his forces to attack Cao Pi&#x27;s territories in Jing Province, some officials rejected the idea of resisting Sun Quan because Fancheng and Xiangyang lacked food supplies. Cao Ren, who was defending Xiangyang, had been reassigned from Fancheng to defend Wan. Sima Yi said; &quot;Sun Quan has recently defeated Guan Yu. At this time, he will want to be tying up his own business, and will not dare cause us trouble. Xiangyang&#x27;s land and water routes are crucial to its defences against enemy attacks, so we cannot abandon the city.&quot; Cao Pi ignored Sima Yi&#x27;s advice, and had Cao Ren burn and abandon Xiangyang and Fancheng. As Sima Yi predicted, Sun Quan did not attack afterwards, and Cao Pi regretted not listening to him.

Throughout 220, Sima Yi served as one of the leading officials in court to urge Cao Pi&#x27;s seizure of the throne, and was supported by other officials.

In late 220, Cao Pi usurped the throne from Emperor Xian, ending the Eastern Han dynasty, and declared himself emperor of the newly established state of Wei. Cao Pi first appointed Sima Yi as a Master of Writing () but later reassigned him as an Army Inspector () and Palace Assistant Imperial Clerk (). He promoted Sima Yi from a village marquis to a district marquis under the title &quot;District Marquis of Anguo&quot; ().

In 221, Sima Yi was removed from his post as an Army Inspector, and was appointed as a Palace Attendant () and Right Supervisor of the Masters of Writing (). This was a position of considerable influence, one of the assistant managers of the Imperial Secretariat, responsible for imperial correspondence and edicts.

In 222, when Cao Pi visited Wan, either because the city was not celebratory enough or because a local market had failed to produce a type of medicine Cao Pi had requested, the Governor of Nanyang Yang Jun (楊俊) under whose authority the city fell, was arrested. Sima Yi, among other officials, was on good terms with Yang Jun, whom he had met during his youth (they were both from Henei Commandery) and considered capable and intelligent, and pleaded on his behalf; knocking his forehead on the ground until it started bleeding, but Cao Pi dismissed the appeal. Yang Jun, admitting he was at fault, committed suicide. Sima Yi was greatly saddened at such a loss.

Two years later, in September 224, Cao Pi toured the south to inspect his forces near the border between Wei and Wu border. Sima Yi remained behind to defend Xuchang and his marquis title was changed to &quot;District Marquis of Xiang&quot; ().

In early 225, he was appointed General Who Pacifies the Army () and placed in command of 5,000 troops, and also held the positions of Official Who Concurrently Serves in the Palace () and Manager of the Affairs of the Masters of Writing (), a promotion from his prior office. When Sima Yi declined to accept these appointments, Cao Pi told him; &quot;I have been busy with the affairs of state all day into the night, with no moment to rest. This isn&#x27;t a commendation: just sharing the burden.&quot;

The next year, Cao Pi led his armies to attack Sun Quan, and left Sima Yi behind to defend and govern the imperial capital in his absence, as well as providing reinforcements and supplies for his armies at the frontline. Before departing, Cao Pi issued a decree; &quot;I am deeply concerned about my posterity. This is why I entrust you with this responsibility. Even though Cao Shen made many contributions on the battlefield, Xiao He played a more important role than him. Would that I could but be free of looking back over my shoulder at the west (referring to Shu Han)!&quot; Cao Pi later returned from Guangling Commandery to Luoyang. He told Sima Yi, &quot;When I am in the east, you will be in charge of the west; when I am in the west, you will be in charge of the east.&quot; Sima Yi remained behind to guard Xuchang.

In mid 226, when Cao Pi became critically ill, he summoned Sima Yi, Cao Zhen, Chen Qun, and possibly Cao Xiu to meet him in the south hall of Chonghua Palace (), where he ordered them to assist his son Cao Rui after his death. Cao Pi also told Cao Rui; &quot;There may be those who would alienate these Three Excellencies from you, but be careful and do not doubt them&quot;.

==Service under Cao Rui==
===Driving back Wu invaders===
After Cao Rui became Emperor of Wei, he elevated Sima Yi from the status of a district marquis to a county marquis under the title &quot;Marquis of Wuyang&quot;. Around that time, Sun Quan attacked Jiangxia Commandery and sent his generals Zhuge Jin and Zhang Ba () to attack Xiangyang. Sima Yi led Wei forces to resist the Wu invaders, defeated Zhuge Jin, and killed Zhang Ba and more than 1,000 Wu soldiers. In recognition of Sima Yi&#x27;s efforts, Cao Rui promoted him to General of Agile Cavalry ().

===Suppressing Meng Da&#x27;s rebellion===

In July 227, Cao Rui ordered Sima Yi to garrison at Wan, and put him charge of the military affairs of Jing and Yu provinces.

During Cao Pi&#x27;s reign, Sima Yi had warned Cao Pi Meng Da, a former Shu general who had defected to Wei, was untrustworthy, but Cao Pi had ignored him. Sima Yi was proven right after Cao Pi&#x27;s death when in late 227, Sima Yi received news Meng Da was planning to rebel against Wei and return to Shu; according to the &quot;Weilüe&quot;, he had sent his adviser Liang Ji () to investigate Meng Da&#x27;s case while urging Meng Da to visit Luoyang to attend to the Wei court, which alarmed the latter, persuading Meng Da to rebel.

According to the &quot;Book of Jin&quot; and &quot;Zizhi Tongjian&quot;, Sima Yi, upon hearing Meng Da wished to rebel, wrote a flattering letter to Meng Da to distract and confuse him while preparing to suppress the rebellion. While Meng Da was deciding whether to commit to his rebellion, Sima Yi swiftly assembled his troops and secretly led them to attack Meng Da&#x27;s base in Shangyong Commandery (上庸郡; around present-day Zhushan County, Hubei). While heading towards the location, Sima Yi&#x27;s subordinates suggested they observe Meng Da&#x27;s actions first before advancing but Sima Yi replied, &quot;[Meng] Da is not a trustworthy person. Now that he is hesitating due to suspicions, we should seize this opportunity to get rid of him.&quot; The marching speed was quickened and, covering 2,200 &quot;li&quot;, Sima Yi arrived within eight days and ordered his subordinates to lead separate detachments to intercept and block Meng Da&#x27;s reinforcements in the form of Shu and Wu forces that had just arrived at Anqiao () and Mulan Fort () in Xicheng () respectively.

Meng Da was taken by surprise, having not expected Sima Yi to appear so quickly at Shangyong Commandery. Meng Da was surrounded on three sides by a river so he set up wooden barriers to defend himself. Sima Yi&#x27;s forces crossed the rivers, destroyed the barriers, and arrived just outside Shangyong. Sima Yi split up his forces and attacked the city from eight directions for over two weeks. On the sixteenth day, Meng Da&#x27;s nephew Deng Xian () and subordinate Li Fu () opened the city gates and surrendered to Sima Yi. Meng Da was captured and executed, and his head was sent to the capital Luoyang; more than 10,000 captives were taken and Sima Yi returned to Wan in triumph.

===Governing Jing and Yu provinces===
While he was in charge of Jing and Yu provinces, Sima Yi encouraged and promoted agriculture, and reduced wastage of public funds. The people of the southern lands were happy and showed their support for him.

Shen Yi, a former subordinate of Meng Da, had remained in Weixing Commandery (魏興郡; around present-day Ankang, Shaanxi) and had become deeply entrenched there. Shen Yi had been illegally using the Wei emperor&#x27;s name to carve official stamps and seals, and giving them to others. After hearing of Meng Da&#x27;s fall, he became worried he would be the next target of Sima Yi&#x27;s crackdown on traitorous officials. After Sima Yi had suppressed Meng Da&#x27;s rebellion, many regional officials came to present gifts and congratulate him. Sima Yi sent a messenger to provoke Shen Yi and lure him into a trap. When Shen Yi went to confront Sima Yi, he was captured and sent to the imperial capital. Sima Yi relocated to You Province with more than 7,000 households from Shangyong Commandery. The Shu military officers Yao Jing (), Zheng Tuo (), and others later brought more than 7,000 men with them to surrender to Sima Yi.

Among the thousands of people who migrated to Wei from Shu, many were unregistered residents whom the Wei government wanted to register as citizens of Wei. The Wei emperor Cao Rui summoned Sima Yi back to Luoyang and sought his opinion on this issue. Sima Yi said: &quot;The enemy seized these people through deception and now abandoned them. If we acknowledge their position in our great apparatus of state, they will naturally feel happy and at ease.&quot; Cao Rui then asked him which of Wei&#x27;s two rival states (Wu and Shu) they should attack first. Sima Yi replied: &quot;The people of Wu know that we in the Central States are not adept in naval warfare, hence they dare to live in Dongguan. When we attack an enemy, we should always block its throat and strike its heart. Xiakou and Dongguan are the enemy&#x27;s heart and throat. If we can move our land forces to Wan to lure Sun Quan to advance east, then take advantage of his absence from Xiakou by sending our navy to attack it, it will be like an army from Heaven descending to attack, victory assured.&quot; Cao Rui agreed with Sima Yi&#x27;s view and ordered him to return to his post at Wan.

Around August 228, during the time of the Battle of Shiting, records make brief mention of Sima Yi&#x27;s involvement in the events by stating he led Wei forces into Jiangling.

===Campaign against Shu===
In March 230, Sima Yi was promoted to General-in-Chief (), appointed Grand Chief Controller () in charge of multiple commanderies, and – in a continuation of an extremely early tradition – bestowed a ceremonial yellow battle axe. The Wei emperor Cao Rui put him and Cao Zhen in charge of defending Wei&#x27;s western borders from attacks by its rival state Shu, which had been launching invasions since 228. At Cao Zhen&#x27;s instigation, a campaign against Shu was proposed and eventually implemented after Cao Rui approved his proposal. In August 230, Cao Zhen led an army from Chang&#x27;an to attack Shu via the Ziwu Valley (). At the same time, another Wei army led by Sima Yi, acting on Cao Rui&#x27;s order, advanced towards Shu from Jing Province by sailing along the Han River. The rendezvous point for Cao Zhen and Sima Yi&#x27;s armies was at Nanzheng. The army led by Sima Yi passed through Zhuoshan () and Xicheng County (; present-day Ankang, Shaanxi), sailed along the Mian River to Quren County (; west of Yunyang County, Chongqing), and arrived at Xinfeng County (; south of Weinan, Shaanxi). He made camp at Dankou (). Other Wei armies also prepared to attack Shu from the Xie Valley () or Wuwei Commandery. The campaign, however, had to be aborted by October 230 because the gallery roads leading into Shu were too damaged for the troops to pass through, and because of constant heavy rain that had lasted for more than 30 days.

===Battle of Mount Qi===
In 231, Shu forces led by Zhuge Liang attacked Tianshui Commandery, and besieged Wei forces led by Jia Si () and Wei Ping () at Mount Qi (; the mountainous regions around present-day Li County, Gansu). Cao Rui ordered Sima Yi to move to Chang&#x27;an to supervise military operations in Yong and Liang provinces. Sima Yi then ordered Fei Yao and Dai Ling to protect Shanggui County (; in present-day Tianshui, Gansu) with 4,000 elite troops and set out with the rest of his men westward to relieve the mountainous battlefield. Zhang He wanted to take a detachment and station it at Yong and Mei counties but Sima Yi reasoned: &quot;If the vanguard is able to face the enemy alone, your words are right; but should they not be able to do so, the dividing of the forces into vanguard and rear would be unwise; in this manner the Three Armies of Chu were captured by Qing Bu.&quot; After making preparations for battle, Sima Yi, with Zhang He, Fei Yao, Dai Ling (), and Guo Huai serving as his subordinates, led the Wei forces to Yumi County (; east of Qianyang County, Shaanxi) and stationed there.

When Zhuge Liang heard of the Wei army&#x27;s arrival, he led his troops to Shanggui County to collect the harvest. Without good coordination, Sima Yi&#x27;s subordinates defied his order to defend their positions; a detachment of the Wei army went to attack the Shu forces but were defeated, although accounts from the &quot;Book of Jin&quot; make no mention of a detachment being defeated, and records of the campaign tend to vary and prove unreliable. After defeating the enemy, Zhuge Liang foraged for the early spring wheat that was available in the vicinity. Sima Yi&#x27;s subordinates feared losing the wheat but Sima Yi stated: &quot;Zhuge Liang thinks too much and makes too few decisions. He&#x27;ll be fortifying his camp and defences first before coming to harvest the wheat. Two days is sufficient for me [to reach Shanggui County].&quot; He arrived within two days after travelling overnight. When Zhuge Liang and his men heard Sima Yi was marching towards their position, they swiftly retreated instead of giving battle. Initially, the Wei emperor Cao Rui wanted to supply Sima Yi&#x27;s army with the wheat in Shanggui County and had rejected a proposal to transport grain from Guanzhong to the front line. Zhuge Liang&#x27;s movements, however, were quicker than Cao Rui anticipated; only a portion of the wheat produce in Shanggui County was left after the Shu army&#x27;s harvesting. The Wei general Guo Huai then asserted his influence over local nomadic tribes and forced them to hand over food supplies for the Wei army. The Wei army was thus able to gain access to food supplies without assistance from the central government in Luoyang.

Sima Yi again encountered Zhuge Liang, this time east of Shanggui County at Hanyang () but no direct engagement occurred; Sima Yi drew in his troops and put them into formation while waiting, finding protection in the nearby defiles; concurrently he sent Niu Jin to lead a lightly armed cavalry detachment to lure the enemy to Mount Qi, who in the process briefly engaged in battle with Shu vanguard commander Ma Dai and inflicted some losses on the enemy. Zhuge Liang simultaneously withdrew his forces and Sima Yi thereafter closely followed Zhuge Liang from the rear. Zhang He advised against pursuit on grounds they could effectively station at Mount Qi, combine their forces, and conduct irregular expeditions; Zhuge Liang&#x27;s provisions were running low and he would soon be forced to retreat, but Sima Yi did not heed this advice and continued his pursuit. Zhuge Liang ordered a retreat towards the eastern side of the Mount Qi ridges, where the Shu army fortified at Lucheng (), seizing control of the hills in the north and south, and using the river as a natural barrier while pitching &quot;covering camps&quot; near the riverbank to take complete control of the water passage.

Although his subordinates repeatedly urged Sima Yi to attack the enemy, he was hesitant to do so after seeing the layout of the Shu camps in the hills. He relented when his subordinates criticised and mocked him by saying he would become a laughing stock if he refused to attack. Sima Yi sent Zhang He to attack the southern Shu camps that were guarded by Wang Ping while he led a frontal assault on Lucheng from the central avenue. In response, Zhuge Liang ordered Wei Yan, Wu Ban, and Gao Xiang to lead troops to engage and resist the enemy outside Lucheng. The Wei forces suffered an unexpected and large defeat: 3,000 soldiers were killed, and 5,000 suits of armour and 3,100 sets of hornbeam crossbows were seized by the Shu forces but Sima Yi retained a sizable army, which he led back to his camp.

Despite his victory, Zhuge Liang could not make use of the momentum to launch a major offensive on the enemy because his army was running low on supplies. The &quot;Book of Jin&quot; said Sima Yi launched an attack on the Shu garrisons at this juncture and captured the Shu &quot;covering camps&quot;. Zhuge Liang abandoned Lucheng and retreated in the night but Sima Yi pursued him and inflicted roughly 10,000 casualties on the Shu army. This account from the &quot;Book of Jin&quot; is disputed by historians and is not included in the &quot;Zizhi Tongjian&quot;. According to the &quot;Records of the Three Kingdoms&quot; and &quot;Zizhi Tongjian&quot;, Zhuge Liang retreated due to a lack of supplies rather than defeat, and the Wei forces pursued him. The pursuit did not go completely smoothly for Wei; Sima Yi had ordered Zhang He to further pursue the enemy in an attempt to capitalise on their momentum. According to the &quot;Weilüe&quot;, Zhang He initially refused to obey Sima Yi&#x27;s order and argued according to classical military doctrine, one should refrain from pursuing an enemy force retreating to its home territory. Sima Yi refused to listen and forced Zhang He to carry out this order. Zhang He fell into an ambush at Mumen Trail (; in Tianshui, Gansu), where Zhuge Liang had ordered crossbowmen to hide on high ground and fire at approaching enemy forces when they entered a narrow defile. Zhang He died after a stray arrow hit him in the right knee. Regardless of this setback, Cao Rui sent an emissary to congratulate Sima Yi on his victory and rewarded him by adding more taxable households to his marquisate.

Sima Yi&#x27;s advisors Du Xi and Xue Ti () told Sima Yi the wheat would be ready for harvest the following year and Zhuge Liang would be sure to come seize it. Because Longyou lacked food supplies, they should transport the wheat there that winter. Sima Yi said: &quot;Zhuge Liang advanced towards Mount Qi again and attacked Chencang [; east of Baoji, Shaanxi] but lost and withdrew. If he advances again, instead of attacking cities, he will call for a battle in the east of Longyou and not the west. Zhuge Liang feels frustrated whenever there is shortage of grain, so he will stockpile supplies when he returns [to Shu]. I predict he won&#x27;t attack again without at least three harvests&#x27; worth of food supplies.&quot; Sima Yi then proposed to the Wei imperial court to mobilise farmers from Ji Province to Shanggui County and put them under the jurisdiction of Jingzhao, Tianshui, and Nan&#x27;an () commanderies. By 233, Sima Yi&#x27;s agricultural plan came to fruition and became a source of food supplies for the three commanderies.

===Battle of Wuzhang Plains===

In March or April 234, Zhuge Liang led up to 100,000 Shu troops out of the Xie Valley () and camped at the southern bank of the Wei River near Mei County.

Sima Yi&#x27;s subordinates wanted to station their camp north of the Wei River but Sima Yi said: &quot;Many civilians have gathered at the south of the Wei River. That is certain to be a hotly contested location.&quot; Sima Yi then led his troops across the river, took up his position with his rear facing the river, and began constructing fortifications. He also said: &quot;If Zhuge Liang is brave enough, he&#x27;ll move out from Wugong County and head eastward in the direction of the mountains. If he moves west to the Wuzhang Plains, we&#x27;ll have no worries.&quot; Around that time, the Wei emperor Cao Rui became worried and decided to send the general Qin Lang to lead 20,000 infantry and cavalry as reinforcements to join Sima Yi.

While Sima Yi and his troops were stationed at the south of the Wei River, Guo Huai urged him and the officers to move a detachment to the plains on the river&#x27;s north bank because he foresaw Zhuge Liang would attempt to seize the plains. When the other officers disagreed, Guo Huai stated: &quot;If Zhuge Liang crosses the Wei River and occupies those plains, his troops will have access to the mountains in the north. If they block the road through the mountains, it will cause fear and panic among the people living in the region. This isn&#x27;t helpful to our state.&quot; Sima Yi finally agreed with Guo Huai and sent him to occupy the plains. While Guo Huai and his men were building a camp on the plains, they came under attack by Shu forces but drove them back.

Zhuge Liang moved his army west to the Wuzhang Plains and prepared to cross to the northern bank of the Wei River. Sima Yi sent Zhou Dang () to station at Yangsui (; the area north of the Wei River in present-day Mei and Fufeng counties in Shaanxi) and lure Zhuge Liang to attack him. Zhuge Liang, however, did not mobilise his troops for several days. Sima Yi said: &quot;Zhuge Liang wants to take control of the Wuzhang Plains and won&#x27;t advance towards Yangsui. His intention is obvious.&quot; He then sent and Guo Huai to defend Yangsui. Several days later, Guo Huai received news Zhuge Liang was planning to launch an attack in the west and Guo Huai&#x27;s subordinates wanted to strengthen their defences in the west. Guo Huai was the only one who recognised it was a ruse and that Zhuge Liang was planning to attack Yangsui. He was proven right later as the Shu forces attacked Yangsui at night. Because Guo Huai had earlier set up defences, the Shu forces failed to capture Yangsui. Zhuge Liang could not advance further so he retreated to the Wuzhang Plains.

One night, Sima Yi saw a meteor falling towards the Shu camp and predicted Zhuge Liang would be defeated. He ordered a surprise attack on the Shu camp from behind; 500 Shu soldiers were killed, 600 surrendered, and Wei forces captured more than 1,000 livestock of the Shu army. This account, which comes from the &quot;Book of Jin&quot;, is not included in the &quot;Zizhi Tongjian&quot;. Rather, the accounts from the &quot;Records of the Three Kingdoms&quot; were included in the &quot;Zizhi Tongjian&quot;.

The Wei government observed because the Shu army was far away from its base at Hanzhong Commandery, it would not be in its interest to fight a prolonged war in enemy territory so it would be better for the Wei army to adopt a defensive posture against the Shu invaders. Cao Rui thus ordered Sima Yi to hold his position and refrain from engaging the Shu forces in battle. Zhuge Liang attempted to lure Sima Yi to attack him; on one occasion, Zhuge Liang sent Sima Yi women&#x27;s ornaments to taunt him. Sima Yi, apparently feeling enraged, sought permission from Cao Rui to attack the enemy but this was denied. The emperor sent Xin Pi, bearing the imperial sceptre—a symbol of the emperor&#x27;s authority—to the battlefield to make sure Sima Yi followed orders and remained in camp. Zhuge Liang knew Sima Yi was pretending to be angry because he wanted to show the Wei soldiers he would not put up with the enemy&#x27;s taunting and to ensure the Wei soldiers were ready for battle.

According to the &quot;Book of Jin&quot;, when Sima Fu wrote to his brother Sima Yi to ask about the situation at Wuzhang Plains, Sima Yi replied: &quot;Zhuge Liang has big ambitions but fails to recognise opportunities. Always scheming but indecisive, he dallies impotently at combat. Though in command of 100,000 troops, he has played right into my plans and faces certain defeat.&quot; When Zhuge Liang&#x27;s envoy visited Sima Yi&#x27;s camp, the latter inquired about his adversary&#x27;s sleeping and eating habits, and how busy he was. When told how Zhuge Liang consumed little and did not sleep much, Sima Yi said to his men: &quot;Zhuge Kongming takes little food and does much work; how can he last long?&quot;

According to at least one source, Sima Yi continued to provoke Zhuge Liang. Sima Yi reportedly made some 2,000 people cheer by the south-east corner of the military compound. When Zhuge Liang sent a man to inquire on the situation, he stated: &quot;Eastern Wu&#x27;s envoy came and said he would surrender.&quot; Zhuge Liang responded: &quot;Eastern Wu will not surrender. Sima Yi is an old man who will soon be 60 years old, does he really need to use such a trick?&quot;

After a standoff lasting more than 100 days, Sima Yi heard from civilians Zhuge Liang had died from illness and the Shu army had burnt down their camp and retreated. He then led his troops to pursue the enemy and caught up with them but withdrew when the Shu forces got into battle formation. Some days later, Sima Yi surveyed the remains of the Shu camp and said; &quot;He was a genius&quot;. He also concluded Zhuge Liang was indeed dead when he saw the Shu army had hastily retreated. Xin Pi felt they could not yet be certain about Zhuge Liang&#x27;s death but Sima Yi said: &quot;The most important things in an army are its documents, troops, horses, and supplies. [Zhuge Liang] has abandoned all of them. How can a person lose his five most important organs and still be alive? We should quickly pursue (the enemy).&quot; The ground in the Guanzhong region was full of &quot;Tribulus terrestris&quot; – a ground level plant with spiky burrs – so Sima Yi sent 2,000 men wearing wooden clogs with flat soles to clear the path before his main army advanced and continued pursuing the enemy, although he retreated when he encountered the Shu forces. When Sima Yi reached Chi&#x27;an (), he asked the residents there about Zhuge Liang and heard there was a saying: &quot;A dead Zhuge scares away a living Zhongda&quot;. When Sima Yi heard that, he laughed and said: &quot;That&#x27;s because I can predict the living; I can&#x27;t predict the dead.&quot;

In 235, Sima Yi was promoted to Grand Commandant and had the number of taxable households in his marquisate increased. In the same year, when the Shu general Ma Dai led troops to invade Wei, Sima Yi sent Niu Jin to lead Wei forces to resist the invaders. Niu Jin defeated Ma Dai and killed more than 1,000 enemy soldiers. However, this account from the &quot;Book of Jin&quot; is not referenced in the &quot;Zizhi Tongjian&quot;. When a famine broke out in North China Plain, Sima Yi had more than five million &quot;hu&quot; of grain transported from Chang&#x27;an to Luoyang to aid in disaster relief efforts.

Around this time, Sima Yi established a military market at Chang&#x27;an. When an official named Yan Fei () reported that the soldiers were insulting the people living there, he summoned the market captain and personally flogged him 100 times in front of Yan Fei, and thereafter strictly supervised the conduct of all the officials and soldiers.

===Liaodong campaign===

In 236, Sima Yi caught a white deer, which was regarded as an auspicious animal, and presented it to the Wei emperor Cao Rui, who said: &quot;When the Duke of Zhou assisted King Cheng in governance, he presented white pheasants to the king. Now you are in charge of Shaanxi and you present a white deer. Isn&#x27;t this a sign of loyalty, cooperation, long-lasting stability, and peace?&quot; Later, when Cao Rui asked for capable and virtuous men to be recommended to him, Sima Yi recommended Wang Chang.

Gongsun Yuan, a warlord based in Liaodong Commandery who previously pledged allegiance to the Wei state, started a rebellion and declared independence, defeating the general Guanqiu Jian in an engagement.

In January 238, Cao Rui summoned Sima Yi to Luoyang to lead a campaign against Liaodong. When asked by the emperor how Gongsun Yuan would respond, Sima Yi stated he may either flee, resist, or defend his capital city; the final option being the worst choice, and the most likely to be used against Sima Yi after some initial resistance. When the emperor asked how long it would take, Sima Yi said he needed one year to lead the troops to Liaodong, to suppress the revolt, and to then return and repose. The Wei government had conscripted many men into military service or recruited them for manual labour to work on Cao Rui&#x27;s palace construction and renovation projects. Sima Yi felt doing so would increase the burden on the common people and make them resent the Wei government so he advised Cao Rui to halt the projects and focus on dealing with more pressing issues.

Thereafter, Sima Yi, with Niu Jin and Hu Zun () serving as his subordinates, set out with an army of 40,000 men from Luoyang to attack Liaodong. Cao Rui saw him off at Luoyang&#x27;s Ximing Gate (), where he ordered Sima Yi&#x27;s brother Sima Fu and son Sima Shi, as well as other officials to attend the ceremony. During the extensive and lively festivities, in which Sima Yi met with elders and old friends, he began sighing and, feeling emotional and dissatisfied, sang a song:
Sima Yi advanced with the army, which would later be reinforced by Guanqiu Jian&#x27;s forces in You Province, which included the Xianbei auxiliary led by Mohuba (), ancestor of the Murong clan. The Wei army reached Liaodong in June 238 and as Sima Yi had anticipated, Gongsun Yuan had sent his Grand General Bei Yan () and Yang Zuo () to face him. They built their camps along the Liao River to await Sima Yi&#x27;s arrival. The Wei generals wanted to attack the enemy on the river&#x27;s banks but Sima Yi reasoned attacking the encampment would only wear themselves out and deplete their valuable resources; because the bulk of the Liaodong army was at the Liao River, Gongsun Yuan&#x27;s headquarters at Xiangping, the capital of the Liaodong Commandery, would be comparatively empty and the Wei army could take it with ease.

Sima Yi decided to dispatch Hu Zun with a contingent of his army south with banners and drums to indicate he was going to make a sortie there with a large force. This deceived Bei Yan and his men, who pursued the decoy unit, whereby Hu Zun, having lured the enemy, crossed the river and broke through Bei Yan&#x27;s line. Sima Yi secretly crossed the river to the north, sank the boats, burnt down the bridges, built a long barricade along the river, and then marched for the capital. Once the opposing generals realised they had fallen for a ruse, they started marching in haste towards the capital. In the night, while heading north to intercept Sima Yi as had been expected of them, they caught up at Mount Shou (; a mountain west of Xiangping), where Bei Yan was ordered to give battle, and was subsequently defeated by Sima Yi and his army. Sima Yi then marched towards Xiangping unopposed, and started besieging it.

July brought the summer monsoons, which a year earlier had impeded Guanqiu Jian&#x27;s campaign. Heavy ran fell for more than a month so even ships could sail the length of the flooded Liao River from its mouth at Liaodong Bay up to the walls of Xiangping. Despite the water being several feet high on level ground, Sima Yi was determined to maintain the siege regardless of the clamours of his officers, who proposed changing camps. Sima Yi threatened to execute those who advocated for the idea, such as the officer Zhang Jing, who violated the order. The rest of the officers subsequently became silent.

Because of the floods, the encirclement of Xiangping was incomplete and the defenders used the flood to their advantage to sail out to forage and pasture their animals. Sima Yi forbade his generals from pursuing the foragers and herders from Xiangping, and upon being questioned by one of his subordinates, stated: &quot;Meng Da&#x27;s multitudes were small, but he had food and supplies for a year. My generals and soldiers were four times those of Da, but with provisions not even for a full month. Using one month to plot against one year, how could I not be quick? To use four to strike against one, if it merely makes half be eliminated, I would still do it. In this case, I consider not calculations on death and injuries, I compete against provisions. Now, the rebels are numerous and we are few; the rebels are hungry and we are full. With flood and rain like this, we cannot employ our effort. Even if we take them, what is the use? Since I left the capital, I have not worried about the rebels attacking us, but have been afraid they might flee. Now, the rebels are almost at their extremity as regards supplies, and our encirclement of them is not yet complete. By plundering their cattle and horses or capturing their fuel-gatherers, we will be only compelling them to flee. War is an art of deception; we must be good at adapting ourselves to changing situations. Relying on their numerical superiority and helped by the rain, the rebels, hungry and distressed as they are, are not willing to give up. We must make a show of inability to put them at ease; to alarm them by taking petty advantages is not the plan at all.&quot;

Officials in the Wei imperial court in Luoyang were also concerned about the floods and proposed recalling Sima Yi. The Wei emperor, Cao Rui, being certain of Sima Yi&#x27;s abilities, turned down the proposal. Around this time, the Goguryeo king sent a noble (; &quot;taeka&quot;) and the Keeper of Records ( &quot;jubu&quot;) of the Goguryeo court with several thousand men to aid Sima Yi.

On 3 September, a comet was seen in the skies of Xiangping and was interpreted as an omen of destruction by those in the Liaodong camp. A frightened Gongsun Yuan sent his Chancellor of State Wang Jian () and Imperial Counsellor Liu Fu () to negotiate the terms of surrender, where he promised to present himself bound to Sima Yi once the siege was lifted. Sima Yi, wary of Gongsun Yuan&#x27;s double-crossing past, executed the two, saying in a message to Gongsun Yuan he desired an unconditional surrender: &quot;In ancient times, Chu and Zheng were classed as states of equal footing, yet the Earl of Zheng nevertheless met the Prince of Chu with his flesh bare and leading a sheep. I am a superior Ducal Minister of the Son of Heaven, yet Wang Jian and his following wanted me to raise the siege and withdraw my men. Is this proper? These two men were dotards who must have failed to convey your intentions; I have already put them to death (on your behalf). If you still have anything to say, then send a younger man of intelligence and precision.&quot;

When Gongsun Yuan sent Wei Yan () for another round of talks, this time asking permission to send a hostage to the Wei court, Sima Yi dismissed the final messenger as a waste of time: &quot;In military affairs there are five essential points. If able to fight, you must fight. If not able to fight, you must defend. If not able to defend, you must flee. The remaining two points entail only surrender or death. Now that you are not willing to come bound, you are determined to have death; there is no need of sending any hostage.&quot; Sima Yi&#x27;s previous suggestion of further negotiations was an act of malice that gave false hope to Gongsun Yuan while prolonging the siege and placing further strain on the supplies within the city.

When the rain stopped and the floodwater receded, Sima Yi hastened to complete the encirclement of Xiangping. The siege continued day and night using mining, hooked ladders, battering rams, and artificial mounds for siege towers and [ to get higher vantage points. The speed at which the siege was tightened caught the defenders off guard; because they had been obtaining supplies with such ease during the flood, there was apparently no real attempt to stockpile the goods inside Xiangping. As a result, famine and cannibalism broke out in the city. Many Liaodong generals, such as Yang Zuo, surrendered to Sima Yi during the siege.

On 29 September, the famished Xiangping fell to the Wei army. Gongsun Yuan and his son Gongsun Xiu (), leading a few hundred horsemen, broke out of the encirclement and fled to the southeast. The main Wei army gave pursuit, and killed both father and son on the Liang River (; now known as Taizi River). Gongsun Yuan&#x27;s head was cut off and sent to Luoyang for public display. A separate fleet led by future Grand Administrators Liu Xin () and Xianyu Si () had been sent to attack the Korean commanderies of Lelang and Daifang by sea. Eventually, all of Gongsun Yuan&#x27;s former holdings were subjugated.

After Sima Yi&#x27;s army occupied Xiangping, he erected a pair of guideposts to separate recent and long-serving government officials, and military personnel of Gongsun Yuan&#x27;s disestablished regime, and ordered a systematic purge of 2,000 officials. He also had some 7,000 men aged 15 and above from within the city executed and raised a &quot;jingguan&quot; (, a victory mound) with their corpses while pardoning the remaining survivors. In total, Sima Yi&#x27;s conquest gained Wei an additional 40,000 households and over 300,000 citizens, although Sima Yi did not encourage these frontier settlers to continue their livelihoods in the Chinese northeast; he ordered those families who wished to return to central China be allowed to do so. Sima Yi also posthumously rehabilitated and erected mounds over the graves of Lun Zhi () and Jia Fan (), two officials who had attempted to stop Gongsun Yuan from rebelling but were executed by him. Sima Yi also freed Gongsun Gong, the previous Administrator of Liaodong, who had been imprisoned by his nephew Gongsun Yuan. All of this was carried out under an order that stated: &quot;During the ancients&#x27; attacks on states, they executed their fiercest enemies, and that was all. Those who were deceived and misled by Wenyi, all are forgiven. People of the Central States who desire to return to their old hometowns are free to do so.&quot;

Because it was winter, many soldiers were suffering from the cold and wanted extra clothing. When someone said they had a surplus of &quot;ru&quot; and suggested giving them to the soldiers, Sima Yi said: &quot;The padded coats are the property of the government. No one is allowed to give them to others without permission.&quot; Sima Yi ordered all soldiers aged 60 and above, numbering over 1,000 men, to retire from their service, and for the dead and wounded to be sent home. As Sima Yi led the troops back to Luoyang from Liaodong, Cao Rui sent an emissary to meet them in Ji and host a victory celebration. He also added Kunyang County (; present-day Ye County, Henan) to Sima Yi&#x27;s marquisate so Sima Yi had two counties as his marquisate.

===Appointment as regent===
When Sima Yi arrived at Xiangping, he dreamt Cao Rui asked him to look at his face, which appeared different than usual, and Sima Yi sensed something was wrong. Later, when Sima Yi was in Ji County (; in present-day Xinxiang, Henan), Cao Rui issued an imperial order instructing him to return to Luoyang via a faster route through the Guanzhong region. When Sima Yi reached Baiwu (), he received another five orders within three days. Sensing the urgency of the situation, he boarded a &quot;zhuifengche&quot; and travelled overnight across the Baiwu region over a distance of more than 400 &quot;li&quot;, stopping only once for a brief rest, and reached Luoyang the following day. Upon arrival, Sima Yi was led to the bedroom of the Jiafu Hall () in the imperial palace to meet Cao Rui and saw the emperor was critically ill. With tears in his eyes, Sima Yi asked Cao Rui about his condition. Cao Rui held Sima Yi&#x27;s hand and told him: &quot;I have matters to entrust you. Now that I meet you one last time before I die, I have no more regrets.&quot; Cao Rui called into his chambers the Prince of Qin, Cao Xun, and the Prince of Qi, Cao Fang, and while pointing towards Cao Fang stated: &quot;This is he. Look at him carefully and do not make any mistake.&quot; Cao Rui had Cao Fang embrace Sima Yi&#x27;s neck. Sima Yi hit his forehead on the floor and started weeping. Cao Rui thereafter designated Sima Yi as a co-regent for the young Cao Fang alongside the general Cao Shuang, who had already been designated for the position.

Before his death, Cao Rui had planned to exclude Sima Yi from the regency and instead appoint Cao Yu, Xiahou Xian (), Cao Shuang, Cao Zhao, and Qin Lang as the regents. Two of his close aides, Liu Fang () and Sun Zi (), who were not on good terms with Xiahou Xian and Cao Zhao, persuaded Cao Rui to exclude those two, and Qin Lang and Cao Yu, thereby having Cao Shuang and Sima Yi appointed as the regents instead.

==Service under Cao Fang==
In early 239, when Cao Fang became the new Wei emperor, the Wei government appointed Sima Yi as a Palace Attendant () and Manager of the Affairs of the Imperial Secretariat (), granted him imperial authority, and ordered him to oversee military affairs within and outside Luoyang. Sima Yi and Cao Shuang each held command over 3,000 troops, and served as regents for the underage emperor. Because Cao Shuang wanted the Masters of Writing (or Imperial Secretariat) to report to him first, he proposed to the imperial court to reassign Sima Yi to be the Grand Marshal (). The previous Grand Marshals had all died in office so the imperial court thought it would be more appropriate to appoint Sima Yi as Grand Tutor () instead. Sima Yi was also awarded additional privileges similar to those granted to Xiao He in the early Western Han dynasty and Cao Cao in the late Eastern Han dynasty: He did not have to walk briskly when he entered the imperial court, did not have to have his name announced when he entered, and was allowed to wear shoes and carry a sword into the imperial court. His eldest son Sima Shi was appointed as a Regular Mounted Attendant () while three of his relatives were enfeoffed as marquises and four others were appointed as Cavalry Commandants (). Sima Yi ordered his relatives to decline the honours and appointments.

In the spring of 239, the Wa, Karasahr, Weixu () states and the Xianbei tribes living south of the Ruo River came to pay tribute to the Cao Wei state. Cao Fang attributed this to the efforts of his subjects and he rewarded Sima Yi by increasing the number of taxable households in his marquisate. Sima Yi also suggested the Wei imperial court put an end to the extravagant palace construction and renovation projects started in Cao Rui&#x27;s reign, and divert those resources and manpower to agriculture. The imperial court approved.

===Battles in Jing Province===
Around late May or June 241, Wu launched an invasion of Wei on three fronts: Quebei (; south of present-day Shou County, Anhui), Fancheng, and Zhazhong (; west of present-day Nanzhang County, Hubei). When Sima Yi asked permission to lead troops to resist the enemy, officials in the imperial court argued there was no need to take swift action because Fancheng was strong enough to withstand attacks and because the enemy was weary after travelling a long distance. Sima Yi disagreed and said: &quot;In Zizhong the Chinese people and the barbarians number a hundred thousand; south of the water they wander and roam without a master over them. Fancheng has been under attack more than a month without relief. This is a precarious situation. I ask to lead a campaign myself.&quot;

In late June or July 241, Sima Yi led an army from Luoyang to fight the Wu invaders. The Wei emperor Cao Fang saw him off at Luoyang&#x27;s Jinyang Gate (). Upon reaching Fancheng, Sima Yi knew he should not linger for too long because of the heat of summer. He sent a lightly armed cavalry detachment to harass the Wu forces while his main army remained in position. Later, he ordered his tired troops to rest and bathe while a remaining group of personally chosen forces and enlisted volunteers were ordered to climb Fancheng&#x27;s city walls to reinforce the city and curb the enemy&#x27;s siege. The Wu forces led by Zhu Ran retreated overnight upon hearing of this. Sima Yi and the Wei forces pursued the retreating Wu forces to the confluence of the Han, Bai, and Tang rivers, where they defeated and killed over 10,000 enemy soldiers and captured their boats, equipment, and other resources. Cao Fang sent a Palace Attendant as an emissary to meet Sima Yi at Wan to congratulate him and host a banquet to celebrate the victory.

In August 241, the Wei imperial court added two counties to Sima Yi&#x27;s marquisate as a reward for his contributions; Sima Yi&#x27;s marquisate now spanned four counties and covered 10,000 taxable households. Eleven of Sima Yi&#x27;s relatives were also enfeoffed as marquises. As Sima Yi gained greater glory for his achievements, he behaved in a more humble manner, He also constantly reminded his siblings, children, and younger relatives to be mindful of their conduct. In early 242, Cao Fang bestowed the posthumous title &quot;Marquis Cheng of Wuyang&quot; () upon Sima Yi&#x27;s deceased father Sima Fang.

===Promoting agriculture in the Huai River region===
According to the &quot;Book of Jin&quot;, in April or May 242, Sima Yi proposed to the Wei government the digging of a canal to connect the Yellow and Bian rivers and direct their waters towards the southeast to promote agriculture north of the Huai River.

An account from the &quot;Zizhi Tongjian&quot; places this event somewhere in 241; in this account, Deng Ai proposed the idea of building such a canal to Sima Yi, who only thereafter petitioned the state. The agricultural project was begun and eventually completed, and whenever there was a battle in the southeast between the Wei and Wu armies, Wei troops could quickly travel downstream towards the Huai River to counter the enemy. The abundance of food resources and waterways in the upper stream were advantageous for the Wei forces.

Around that time, the Wu general Zhuge Ke was stationed at a military garrison at Wan (; near Qianshan County, Anhui) and posed a threat to the Wei forces in the region. When Sima Yi wanted to lead troops to attack Zhuge Ke, many officials advised him against it. They said Wan was heavily fortified and abundant in supplies, and that Wu reinforcements would come to Zhuge Ke&#x27;s aid if he came under attack, thus putting the invaders in a perilous position. Sima Yi disagreed and said: &quot;The enemy&#x27;s strength is in naval warfare. Why don&#x27;t we try attacking their land garrison and gauge their reaction? If they know their strengths, they will abandon the garrison and retreat; this is our objective. If they hold up inside the garrison and defend their position, their reinforcements will have to reach them via land because the waters are too shallow in winter for boats to sail through. They will be forced to abandon their strength and act from their weakness, to our benefit.&quot;

In October 243, Sima Yi led an army from Luoyang to attack Zhuge Ke at Wan. When Sima Yi and his army reached Shu County (; near Shucheng County, Anhui), Zhuge Ke, upon being instructed by Sun Quan to not give battle and instead station at Chaisang (), gave orders to burn the supplies stockpiled in Wan, abandon the garrison, and retreat.

Sima Yi&#x27;s aim was to destroy the Wu forces&#x27; sources of food in the Huai River region so once Zhuge Ke burnt the supplies in Wan, Sima Yi felt more at ease. He then implemented the &quot;tuntian&quot; policy of agricultural military colonies, alongside large-scale agricultural and irrigation works in the region. In late January or February 244, Cao Fang sent an emissary to meet Sima Yi at Huainan Commandery and honour him for his achievements in promoting agriculture in the region.

===Struggle with Cao Shuang===
Throughout the early years of Cao Shuang and Sima Yi&#x27;s co-regency, the former attempted to consolidate his political influence while only briefly paying respect to Sima Yi based on his status and seniority. Cao Shuang put his brothers in command of the military, promoted his close aides to higher positions in the imperial court, and made changes to the political structure to benefit himself and his clique. He also silenced those who stood against him, his associates, and their combined interests.

During this chain of events, Cao Shuang had Sima Yi appointed to the position of Grand Tutor under the guise of a promotion; while the position was an honourable one, it held almost no real authority and removed Sima Yi from the position of Manager of Affairs of the Imperial Secretariat, instead giving authority over the Secretariat to Cao Shuang. Through the careful appointing of some of Sima Yi&#x27;s aides to certain positions, however, Sima Yi effectively retained much of his political influence and Cao Shuang&#x27;s attempts at strengthening his grip on the political scene were somewhat mitigated. For instance, Deng Ai, a man with whom Sima Yi had previously grown acquainted and realising his talent, transferred him into his service, was eventually appointed to the position of Prefect of the Imperial Secretariat () in 241, gave Deng Ai the rank of Prefect of the Masters of Writing. allowing Sima Yi to still supervise the edicts and memorials. After the death of Man Chong in 242, one of Sima Yi&#x27;s long-serving associates Jiang Ji was appointed to the position of Grand Commandant.

Throughout the 240s, as new groups of intellectuals largely headed by He Yan, an associate of Cao Shuang, sought to oppose traditional Confucian principles and discard &quot;pointless&quot; formalities in society, Sima Yi became a leading representative of men from good families who sought to promote the traditional type of Confucian morality, and restraint in politics and society.

In 244, the officials Deng Yang and Li Sheng advised Cao Shuang to launch a military campaign against Shu to boost his fame and authority in Wei. Sima Yi strongly objected to this idea but Cao Shuang ignored him and proceeded with the campaign. In April 244, Cau Shuang was defeated by Shu forces at the Battle of Xingshi. Sima Yi sent a letter to Cao Shuang&#x27;s associate and uncle Xiahou Xuan reprimanding his faction&#x27;s reckless actions because they could lead to destruction, referring to a historical precedent by stating Cao Cao almost suffered a total defeat in the war against Liu Bei for Hanzhong. The letter also said Shu forces were already occupying Mount Xingshi (; north of Yang County, Shaanxi), and if Cao Shuang&#x27;s group failed to seize control of the area, they could have their retreat route cut off and their forces destroyed. Xiahou Xuan subsequently grew anxious and advised Cao Shuang to lead back his troops, which he eventually did by June or July of the same year, incurring further losses during his retreat.

In September 245, Cao Shuang wanted to alter the structure of the military so he could put his brothers Cao Xi () and Cao Xun () in command of troops. Sima Yi opposed these changes but Cao Shuang ignored him and went ahead. In January 246, the Wei emperor Cao Fang granted Sima Yi the privilege of riding to the imperial court in a type of horse-drawn carriage that was traditionally reserved for emperors.

In February 246, when Wu forces attacked Zhazhong, over 10,000 households living there fled to the north across the Mian River (, a historical name for the Han River). When news of the Wu invasion reached the Wei imperial court, Sima Yi argued they should let the civilians remain on the northern side of the river because the southern side was near enemy territory and hence too dangerous for them. Cao Shuang, however, said: &quot;It isn&#x27;t in our long-term interests to allow the civilians to remain here and give up trying to secure the south of the Mian River&quot;. Sima Yi disagreed: &quot;No. In every case, a safe place is safe, and a dangerous place is dangerous. Hence the military manuals state: &#x27;Victory and defeat are manifestations; safety and danger are energies.&#x27; Manifestation of energy, from the emperor on down, this affects everyone. One cannot but take care about it. Suppose the enemy sends 20,000 troops to cut off passage across the Mian River, sends another 30,000 troops to fight our forces at the south of the Mian, and sends another 10,000 troops to occupy Zhazhong. What then can we do to save those civilians?&quot; Cao Shuang refused and ordered the refugees to return to the southern side of the Mian River. As Sima Yi foresaw, Wu forces occupied Zhazhong, captured the civilians, and relocated them to Wu territory.

Around late May or early June 247, Cao Shuang wanted to further dominate the Wei government so he used a series of political manoeuvres to consolidate and concentrate power in himself and his clique. He heeded the advice of his close aides He Yan, Deng Yang, and Ding Mi (), and relocated Cao Rui&#x27;s widow Empress Dowager Guo to Yongning Palace () so she could not interfere in politics. Sima Yi was unable to stop this, among other contrivances, putting severe stress on the relationship between him and Cao Shuang, who became increasingly distrustful and wary of Sima Yi. In June or July 247, Sima Yi said he was ill and withdrew from politics.

The Princes of Qinghe and Pingyuan had been arguing among themselves with Sun Li, the governor of Ji Province, over a land dispute for the past eight years, after consulting with Sima Yi, arguing a map from the palace archives made during the time of the latter prince&#x27;s enfeoffment should be used. This map would favour Pingyuan&#x27;s claim but Cao Shuang preferred the plaint of the Prince of Qinghe and dismissed the appeal. Sun Li sent a memorial in a forceful tone and Cao Shuang, in anger, banished him from his position for five years. He was eventually reinstated as the governor of Bing Province, and visited Sima Yi before taking his leave. Sima Yi saw that something was amiss, and he asked him if he thought it a small thing to be made the governor of Bing Province, or if he instead felt regret for having got himself involved in this whole affair. Sun Li, in tears, said that he didn&#x27;t take official ranks or past affairs to heart, but that he was worried about the dynasty&#x27;s future. Sima Yi replied: &quot;Stop for the time being, and bear the unbearable.&quot;

In April or May 248, Zhang Dang (), a palace eunuch, illegally transferred eleven women out of the imperial harem and presented them to Cao Shuang to be his concubines. Cao Shuang and his close aides thought Sima Yi was seriously ill and could no longer do anything so they plotted with Zhang Dang to overthrow the emperor Cao Fang and put Cao Shuang on the throne. They were still wary of Sima Yi, however, and did not lower their guard against him.

In late 248, Sima Yi, together with his eldest son Sima Shi, and with possibly his second eldest son Sima Zhao, began plotting against Cao Shuang

===Meeting with Li Sheng===
Li Sheng, one of Cao Shuang&#x27;s supporters, had been reassigned to be the Inspector of Jing Province. Cao Shuang secretly instructed him to check if Sima Yi was as ill as he claimed so Li Sheng visited Sima Yi before leaving for Jing Province. Sima Yi knew the true purpose of Li Sheng&#x27;s visit so he pretended to be frail and senile. Li Sheng saw Sima Yi could not move around and wear clothes without help from his servants, and could not consume congee without soiling his clothes. He then told Sima Yi: &quot;Everyone thought that your illness was a minor one; alas, who expected you to be in such poor health?&quot; Sima Yi pretended to cough and pant as he replied: &quot;I am old and sick. My death could come any day. When you go to Bing Province, you should be careful because it is near barbarian territory. We might not see each other again, so I entrust my sons Shi and Zhao to your care.&quot; Li Sheng corrected him: &quot;I am returning to my home province, not Bing Province&quot;. Sima Yi pretended to mishear and continued saying: &quot;You are going to Bing Province, aren&#x27;t you?&quot; Li Sheng corrected him again: &quot;My home province is Jing Province&quot;. Sima Yi replied: &quot;I am so old and weak that I can&#x27;t even hear you properly. So now you are going back to your home province. It&#x27;s time for you to make some glorious achievements!&quot; Li Sheng returned to Cao Shuang and told him: &quot;Lord Sima is like a corpse who still breathes. His spirit has already departed his body. He can&#x27;t even think.&quot; Later, he said: &quot;It&#x27;s sad to see that the Grand Tutor will not be able to return to service&quot;. Thus duped, Cao Shuang and his associates lowered their guard against Sima Yi.

===Seizing power===
According to the &quot;Book of Jin&quot;, on the night of 4 February, the day before the planned &quot;coup&quot;, Sima Yi sent spies to monitor the behaviour of his two eldest children. In the early hours of the next morning, the spies reported to Sima Yi that Sima Shi went to bed as usual and slept peacefully whereas Sima Zhao, having supposedly only been informed of the plan during the prior evening, tossed and turned in his bed.

On 5 February 249, Cao Shuang and his brothers accompanied the emperor Cao Fang on a visit to Gaoping Mausoleum () to pay their respects to the late emperor Cao Rui. On that day, Sima Yi seized the opportunity to stage a &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot; against his co-regent. He went to Yongning Palace to meet Empress Dowager Guo to request the memorialisation of a decree ordering the removal of Cao Shuang and his brothers from power. Thereafter, the city gates were closed while Sima Shi&#x27;s previously arranged 3,000 forces that had gathered at the Sima Gate () under his command were led to occupy the palace gates. Sima Yi later commented: &quot;This son really worked well.&quot; Soon, the troops were lined up along the palace grounds, passing through Cao Shuang&#x27;s camp. Cao Shuang&#x27;s Controller of Camp Yan Shi () was on the upper floor, drawing his crossbow with the intent to shoot the passing Sima Yi. His colleague Sun Qian () stopped him and said: &quot;We don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s going on.&quot; Yan Shi thrice prepared to shoot the bow but did not shoot.

Meanwhile, Sima Yi granted imperial authority to Gao Rou the Minister over the Masses and appointed him as acting General-in-Chief (), and ordered him to take command of Cao Shuang&#x27;s troops, stating: &quot;You&#x27;re now like Zhou Bo.&quot; Sima Yi also appointed Wang Guan the Minister Coachman (), whom Sima Yi had previously recommended during Cao Rui&#x27;s reign as acting Commandant of the Central Army (), and ordered him to seize command of the troops under Cao Shuang&#x27;s brother Cao Xi ().

Sima Yi, along with the Grand Commandant Jiang Ji and others, led troops out of Luoyang to the pontoon bridge above the Luo River, where he sent a memorial to the emperor Cao Fang listing Cao Shuang&#x27;s crimes—which included not fulfilling his duty as regent and corrupting the government, and conspiring against the throne—and asking the emperor to remove Cao Shuang and his brothers from their positions of power. Cao Shuang blocked the memorial from reaching Cao Fang and left the emperor at the south of the Yi River while ordering his men to cut down trees to build anti-cavalry blockades and station about 1,000 troops nearby to guard against Sima Yi&#x27;s advances. Sima Yi sent Xu Yun () and Chen Tai to persuade Cao Shuang to plead guilty as early as possible. Sima Yi also sent Yin Damu (), a man whom Cao Shuang trusted, to tell him nothing more would result from this aside from his dismissal. Huan Fan, the Minister of Finance (), had left the city to visit Cao Shuang&#x27;s camp, with Sima Yi commenting: &quot;The &#x27;bag of wisdom&#x27; is gone.&quot; Jiang Ji responded: &quot;Huan Fan is indeed wise, but stupid horses are too much attached to the beans in their manger. Cao Shuang is certain not to employ his counsel.&quot; Huan Fan attempted to persuade Cao Shuang and his brothers to flee to Xuchang with the emperor, and to issue an edict denouncing Sima Yi as a traitor and drafting troops to fight back but they remained undecided. Cao Shuang ultimately surrendered to Sima Yi and gave up his powers, thinking he could still lead a luxurious life in retirement. Huan Fan scolded them, saying: &quot;Cao Zhen was a good man, yet sired you and your brothers, little pigs and calves that you are! I never expected to be involved with you and have my family annihilated.&quot;

After returning to Luoyang, Cao Shuang and his brothers were carefully guarded, and on 9 February 249, Cao Shuang was accused of plotting treason after the palace eunuch Zhang Dang (), who had been sent to the &quot;tingyu&quot;, had testified Cao Shuang and his associates were planning to seize the throne for themselves. Cao Shuang was arrested along with his brothers and his supporters, including He Yan, Ding Mi, Deng Yang, Bi Gui, Li Sheng, and Huan Fan. They were subsequently executed with the rest of their families and relatives on the same day. Jiang Ji had attempted to persuade Sima Yi to spare Cao Shuang and his brothers in consideration of the meritorious service rendered by their father, Cao Zhen but Sima Yi refused. Two of Cao Shuang&#x27;s subordinates Lu Zhi () and Yang Zong () had been implicated in the plot and were arrested as well, although Sima Yi pardoned them under the rationale: &quot;Each of them was serving his own master.&quot;

Earlier, when Huan Fan escaped from Luoyang to join Cao Shuang, he encountered Si Fan (), who was guarding the Changping Gate. Because Si Fan used to serve under Huan Fan, Si Fan trusted Huan Fan and allowed him to pass through. Once he was out of Luoyang, Huan Fan turned back and told Si Fan: &quot;The Imperial Tutor [Sima Yi] is planning to commit treason. You should come with me!&quot; Si Fan, however, stayed behind and hid himself. After the &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot;, Si Fan surrendered himself to Sima Yi and told him what happened earlier. Sima Yi asked: &quot;What&#x27;s the punishment for falsely accusing someone of treason?&quot; The reply was: &quot;According to the law, the one who makes the false accusation shall be punished for treason.&quot; Huan Fan was then executed along with the rest of his family.

Cao Shuang&#x27;s younger cousin Cao Wenshu had perished and the family of his widowed wife, Xiahou Lingnü wanted to remarry her to someone else, in response to which she cut off her ears and later her nose. Her family asserted the Cao clan was exterminated but she retorted by saying: &quot;I have heard that a person of worth does not renounce his principles because of changes in fortune, nor a righteous person change his mind with a view to preservation or destruction. While the Cao flourished, I was bent on keeping my chastity. Now that they have declined and perished, can I bear to renounce them? Even animals do not act this way; how can I?&quot; When Sima Yi heard of this, he allowed her to adopt a son as an heir to the Cao clan. The contemporaneous Shu official and regent Fei Yi gave his own comment regarding the coup:
On 18 February or sometime in March 249, Cao Fang appointed Sima Yi as Imperial Chancellor, and added another four counties to Sima Yi&#x27;s marquisate, bringing the size of the marquisate to eight counties and 20,000 taxable households. Cao Fang also awarded Sima Yi the privilege of not having to announce his name when he spoke to the emperor. Sima Yi declined the appointment of Imperial Chancellor. In January or February 250, Cao Fang awarded Sima Yi the nine bestowments and an additional privilege of not having to kowtow during imperial court sessions. Sima Yi declined the nine bestowments. In February or March 250, Cao Fang had an ancestral shrine for the Sima family built in Luoyang, increased the size of Sima Yi&#x27;s personal staff, promoted some of Sima Yi&#x27;s personal staff, and enfeoffed Sima Yi&#x27;s sons Sima Rong () and Sima Lun as village marquises. Because Sima Yi was chronically ill, he could not regularly attend imperial court sessions so Cao Fang often visited him at his residence to consult him on policy matters.

===Suppressing Wang Ling&#x27;s rebellion===
Wang Ling the Grand Commandant and his nephew Linghu Yu (令狐愚) the Inspector of Yan Province became worried about Sima Yi&#x27;s growing influence over the emperor Cao Fang, so they plotted to replace him with Cao Biao, the Prince of Chu, while instating his capital city as Xuchang, and then to overthrow Sima Yi. Linghu Yu, however, died in December 249 or January 250.

In February 251, Wang Ling either lied by stating Wu forces were approaching the Tu River () and requested the Wei government give him troops to resist the invaders or was telling the truth that they were obstructing the river, but wanted to use the troops for his own malicious purposes. Sima Yi was suspicious of Wang Ling&#x27;s intention so he refused to approve the request. On 7 June 251, upon receiving intelligence of Wang Ling&#x27;s plot from officials Yang Hong () and Huang Hua (), Sima Yi immediately mobilised troops to attack Wang Ling and travelled down the river while bestowing additional authority upon Zhuge Dan and ordering him to lead his own forces to encroach upon Wang Ling&#x27;s position. Sima Yi issued a pardon to Wang Ling and sent a secretary to call for his surrender. Sima Yi&#x27;s army reached Gancheng () within a few days and advanced to within 100 &quot;chi&quot; of Wang Ling&#x27;s base to put pressure on him. Wang Ling knew Sima Yi was aware of his plans to rebel and that his own forces were too weak so he gave up, sent his subordinate Wang Yu () to apologise on his behalf, and handed over his official seal and ceremonial axe to Sima Yi. When Sima Yi&#x27;s army reached Qiutou (), Wang Ling tied himself up but Sima Yi, acting on imperial order, sent a Registrar () to unbind Wang Ling, reassure him of his safety, and return to him his official seal and ceremonial axe.

Wang Ling met with Sima Yi at Wuqiu () with a distance of more than ten zhang between both of them. Wang Ling told Sima Yi: &quot;If I am guilty, you can summon me to meet you. Why do you need to come here?&quot; Sima Yi replied: &quot;That&#x27;s because you don&#x27;t respond to summons.&quot; Wang Ling said: &quot;You have failed me!&quot; Sima Yi responded: &quot;I would rather fail you than fail the state.&quot; Wang Ling was then escorted as a prisoner back to Luoyang. To discern Sima Yi&#x27;s true intentions, Wang Ling asked him if he could receive nails for his coffin. Sima Yi had them given to him. While &quot;en route&quot; to Luoyang, when Wang Ling passed by a shrine honouring the Wei general Jia Kui, he said; &quot;Jia Liangdao! Only the gods know Wang Ling is truly loyal to Wei.&quot; Wang Ling committed suicide on 15 June 251 by consuming poison at Xiang County (; around present-day Shenqiu County, Henan). Sima Yi had Wang Ling&#x27;s conspirators arrested and executed along with their families.

Cao Fang sent Wei Dan () as an emissary to meet Sima Yi at Wuchi () and congratulate him on his success in suppressing Wang Ling&#x27;s rebellion. When Sima Yi reached Gancheng, Cao Fang sent Yu Ni () as an emissary to appoint Sima Yi as Chancellor of State, and promote him from a marquis to a duke with the title &quot;Duke of Anping Commandery&quot;. One of Sima Yi&#x27;s grandsons and one of his brothers were also enfeoffed as marquises. At the time, the Sima family had 19 marquises and 50,000 taxable households in all their combined marquisates. Sima Yi declined the appointment of Chancellor of State and refused to accept his enfeoffment as a duke.

Guo Huai&#x27;s wife, the younger sister of Wang Ling, was taken into custody by imperial censors. Guo Huai apprehensively relented and let her be taken, not wanting to push things further, but when his five sons kowtowed before him until their foreheads started bleeding, he relented and ordered his subordinates to bring back his wife from the imperial censors. Guo Huai wrote a letter to Sima Yi: &quot;My five sons are willing to sacrifice their lives for their mother. If they lose their mother, I lose them too. Without my five sons, I will no longer exist. If I have violated the law by seizing back my wife from the imperial censors, I am willing to see the Emperor and take full responsibility for my actions.&quot; After reading Guo Huai&#x27;s letter, Sima Yi made an exception for Guo Huai&#x27;s wife and pardoned her.

The &quot;Weilüe&quot; recounts a story of a man named Yang Kang (), a former personal aide of Linghu Yu who divulged the conspiracy of Linghu Yu, who wanted to engage in a rebellion in 249 or 250. Sima Yi, while stationed in Shouchun, asked Shan Gu (), another former aide: &quot;Did Linghu Yu plot a rebellion?&quot; Shan Gu denied this but Sima Yi doubted him because Yang Kang had previously said Shan Gu had also been involved in the plot. Shan Gu and his family were arrested, and he was tortured and interrogated. Shan Gu remained firm in his denial so Sima Yi had Yang Kang called in to compare their testimonies. Yang Kang was unable to defend his own rhetoric so Shan Gu began cursing at Yang Kang. Yang Kang had thought he would be enfeoffed as a reward but because his own testimony had been inconsistent, he was sentenced to death together with Shan Gu, and both men were dragged out and executed.

Around that time, the corpses of Wang Ling and Linghu Yu had been dragged out of their tombs and their bodies had been exposed for three days in the nearest market place.

In July 251, Cao Biao was forced to commit suicide. Sima Yi then relocated the other nobles from the Cao family to Ye, where they were effectively put under house arrest.

==Death and posthumous honours==
In July 251, when Sima Yi became critically ill, he dreamt of Jia Kui and Wang Ling being honoured, which disturbed him. Sima Yi died on 7 September 251 in Luoyang at the age of 73. Emperor Cao Fang donned mourning garments, attended Sima Yi&#x27;s funeral in person, and ordered Sima Yi to be buried with the same honours as those accorded to Huo Guang in the Western Han dynasty. He also posthumously appointed Sima Yi as Chancellor of State and elevated him to the status of a duke. Sima Yi&#x27;s younger brother Sima Fu, however, declined the ducal title and a &quot;wenliangche&quot; () on behalf of his deceased brother, stating Sima Yi would have done that if he was still alive.

Sima Yi was buried on 19 October 251 at Heyin County (; north of present-day Mengjin County, Henan). Cao Fang granted him the posthumous title &quot;Wenzhen&quot; (), which was later changed to &quot;Wenxuan&quot; (). Before his death, however, Sima Yi had made arrangements to be buried at Mount Shouyang (; in Yanshi, Luoyang, Henan) with no markers such as tombstone or trees around his tomb, to be dressed in plain clothes, and have no luxury items buried with him. He also stated his family members who died after him should not be buried with him.

After Sima Yi&#x27;s death, his eldest son Sima Shi assumed his father&#x27;s authority up until his own death on 23 March 255, after which Sima Yi&#x27;s second eldest son Sima Zhao took up his elder brother&#x27;s position. On 2 May 264, when the Wei emperor Cao Huan enfeoffed Sima Zhao as the vassal &quot;King of Jin&quot;, Sima Zhao honoured his father with the posthumous title &quot;King Xuan of Jin&quot;.

Sima Zhao died on 6 September 265, and his eldest son Sima Yan succeeded him in his position. In February 266, after Sima Yi&#x27;s grandson Sima Yan usurped the throne from Cao Huan and established the Jin dynasty with himself as the emperor, he honoured his grandfather with the posthumous title &quot;Emperor Xuan of Jin&quot; with the temple name &quot;Gaozu&quot;, and named his grandfather&#x27;s burial place &quot;Gaoyuan Mausoleum&quot; ().

==Anecdotes==
In his youth, Sima Yi was a close friend of Hu Zhao (). In one incident, Zhou Sheng () kidnapped Sima Yi and wanted to kill him. Hu Zhao braved danger to meet Zhou Sheng in the Xiao Mountains and tried to persuade him to release Sima Yi. When Zhou Sheng refused, Hu Zhao cried and pleaded with him. Zhou Sheng was so moved by Hu Zhao&#x27;s sincerity he released Sima Yi. Hu Zhao told nobody about this incident and very few people knew Sima Yi owed him his life.

A different and likely fictional version of Sima Yi&#x27;s joining of Cao Cao&#x27;s administration comes from a &quot;Weilüe&quot; account that states Cao Hong, a veteran general serving under Cao Cao, had heard of Sima Yi&#x27;s talent and wanted to recruit him as an adviser. Sima Yi thought little of Cao Hong, and refused to meet him, pretending to be so ill he could not walk without using crutches. Cao Hong was so unhappy he reported it to Cao Cao, who then summoned Sima Yi. When Sima Yi heard Cao Cao wanted to meet him, he immediately threw aside his crutches and rushed there.

Cao Cao heard Sima Yi was ambitious and had a &quot;lang gu&quot; () appearance so he wanted to see if it was true. One day, Cao Cao ordered Sima Yi to walk in front of him and made him look back. Sima Yi turned his head to look back without moving his body. Cao Cao also once dreamt of three horses feeding from the same trough and he felt disturbed so he warned Cao Pi: &quot;Sima Yi won&#x27;t be content with being a subject; he will interfere in your family matters&quot;. Because Cao Pi was on good terms with Sima Yi, he often protected and shielded Sima Yi from criticism. Sima Yi also took great care to create an image of himself as a diligent and faithful subject in front of Cao Cao to reduce the latter&#x27;s suspicions of him.

==Appraisal and legacy==
In 238, when Gongsun Yuan heard Sima Yi was leading a Wei army to Liaodong to attack him, he sent a messenger to request reinforcements from Wu. Sun Quan eventually complied and wrote to Gongsun Yuan: &quot;Sima Yi is well-versed in military arts. He uses military strategy like a god. He defeats all who stand in his way. I am deeply worried for you, my brother.&quot;

In 249, Wang Guang, the son of Wang Ling, said: &quot;Now Sima Yi cannot be fathomed, but what he does never runs contrary to the situation. He gives his assignments to the worthy and capable, and liberally credits those who are better than he; he practices the laws of the former rulers and satisfies the people&#x27;s desire. Of whatever Cao Shuang did wrong, he has left nothing uncorrected. He does not relax his efforts day and night, his primary aim being to soothe the people.&quot;

Emperor Ming of Jin (323–325), a descendant of Sima Yi, once asked an official named Wang Dao to tell him about the origins of the Jin dynasty. Wang Dao told him everything from Sima Yi&#x27;s career to Cao Mao&#x27;s attempted coup against Sima Zhao. After hearing from Wang Dao, Emperor Ming said: &quot;If what you said is true, how can the Jin (dynasty) expect to last long?&quot;

The Tang dynasty historian Fang Xuanling, who was the lead editor of Sima Yi&#x27;s biography in the &quot;Book of Jin&quot;, noted Sima Yi was known for appearing to be generous and magnanimous while actually being distrustful and jealous. According to Fang, Sima Yi was suspicious, calculative, manipulative, and a skilled practitioner of power politics. He also noted Sima Yi&#x27;s cruelty in massacring Liaodong&#x27;s population and exterminating Cao Shuang and his entire clan.

After the fall of the Western Jin dynasty in 316, the belief began to slowly shift from the popular ideal Wei was the rightful successor to the Han dynasty towards the view Shu may have had greater legitimacy. Before 316, Sima Yi was seen as a righteous figure and was practically deified; after 316, however, he started to be viewed in a more critical manner, which has lasted into the modern age and is exemplified by Li Shimin&#x27;s comment in the &quot;Book of Jin&quot; regarding Sima Yi:

==In fiction==

Sima Yi is a major character in the 14th-century historical novel &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot;, which romanticises the historical figures and events before and during the Three Kingdoms period of China. In the novel, Sima Yi pretends to be a loyal and dedicated subject of the Wei state while secretly planning to concentrate power in his hands and prepare for his descendants to usurp the throne one day – &quot;double-dealing&quot; in the same way Cao Cao did towards the end of the Eastern Han dynasty. Sima Yi is also a nemesis to Zhuge Liang during the Shu invasions of Wei between 228 and 234, with both of them trying to outwit each other in battles.

Sima Yi is sometimes venerated as a door god at Chinese and Taoist temples, usually in partnership with Zhuge Liang.

Chan Mou&#x27;s manhua comic-book series &quot;The Ravages of Time&quot; is a fictionalised retelling of the history of the late Eastern Han dynasty and the Three Kingdoms, with Sima Yi as the central character.

Sima Yi appears as a playable character in Koei&#x27;s video game series &quot;Dynasty Warriors&quot; and &quot;Warriors Orochi&quot;. In the mobile video game &quot;Puzzle &amp; Dragons&quot;, he is featured as a God type in the Three Kingdoms 2 Pantheon alongside Ma Chao and Diaochan. In the collectible card game &quot;&quot; there is a card named &quot;Sima Yi, Wei Field Marshal&quot; in the &quot;Portal Three Kingdoms&quot; set.

Notable actors who have portrayed Sima Yi include: Wei Zongwan, in &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot; (1994); Ni Dahong, in &quot;Three Kingdoms&quot; (2010); Eric Li, in &quot;Three Kingdoms RPG&quot; (2012); Wu Xiubo, in &quot;The Advisors Alliance&quot; (2017); and Elvis Han, in &quot;Secret of the Three Kingdoms&quot; (2018).

<text>HMS &quot;Warrior&quot; is a 40-gun steam-powered armoured frigate built for the Royal Navy in 1859–1861. She was the name ship of the &quot;Warrior&quot;-class ironclads. &quot;Warrior&quot; and her sister ship were the first armour-plated, iron-hulled warships, and were built in response to France&#x27;s launching in 1859 of the first ocean-going ironclad warship, the wooden-hulled &quot;Gloire&quot;. &quot;Warrior&quot; conducted a publicity tour of Great Britain in 1863 and spent her active career with the Channel Squadron. Obsolescent following the 1873 commissioning of the mastless and more capable HMS &quot;Devastation&quot;, she was placed in reserve in 1875, and was &quot;paid off&quot; – decommissioned – in 1883.

She subsequently served as a storeship and depot ship, and in 1904 was assigned to the Royal Navy&#x27;s torpedo training school. The ship was converted into an oil jetty in 1927 and remained in that role until 1979, at which point she was donated by the Navy to The Maritime Trust for restoration. The restoration process took eight years, during which many of her features and fittings were either restored or recreated. When this was finished she returned to Portsmouth as a museum ship. Listed as part of the National Historic Fleet, &quot;Warrior&quot; has been based in Portsmouth since 1987.

==Background==
The launching of the steam-powered ship of the line &quot;Napoléon&quot; by France in 1850 began an arms race between France and Britain that lasted for a decade. The destruction of a wooden Ottoman fleet by a Russian fleet firing explosive shells in the Battle of Sinop, early in the Crimean War, followed by the destruction of Russian coastal fortifications during the Battle of Kinburn in the Crimean War by French armoured floating batteries, and tests against armour plates, showed the superiority of ironclads over unarmoured ships. France&#x27;s launching in 1859 of the first ocean-going ironclad warship, the wooden-hulled , upset the balance of power by neutralising the British investment in wooden ships of the line and started an invasion scare in Britain, as the Royal Navy lacked any ships that could counter &quot;Gloire&quot; and her two sisters. The situation was perceived to be so serious that Queen Victoria asked the Admiralty if the navy was adequate for the tasks that it would have to perform in wartime. &quot;Warrior&quot; and her sister were ordered in response.

The Admiralty initially specified that the ship should be capable of , and have a full set of sails for worldwide cruising range. Iron construction was chosen as it gave the best trade-off between speed and protection; an iron hull was lighter than a wooden one of the same size and shape, giving more capacity for guns, armour and engines.

==Design and description==

===Overview===
The Chief Constructor of the Navy Isaac Watts and the Chief Engineer Thomas Lloyd designed the ship. To minimise risk they copied the hull design of the large wooden frigate , modifying it for iron construction and to accommodate an armoured box, or citadel, amidships along the single gun deck, which protected most of the ship&#x27;s guns. Ships with this configuration of guns and armour are classified as broadside ironclads.

The &quot;Warrior&quot;-class design used many well-proven technologies that had been used in ocean-going ships for years, including her iron hull, marine steam engine, and screw propeller; only her wrought-iron armour was a major technological advance. Naval architect and historian David K. Brown wrote, &quot;What made [&quot;Warrior&quot;] truly novel was the way in which these individual aspects were blended together, making her the biggest and most powerful warship in the world.&quot; Faster, better armoured and harder to hit than her rivals, she was superior to any existing naval ship. The Admiralty stopped construction of all wooden ships of the line, and ordered another 11 ironclads over the next few years. Jacky Fisher, who was the ship&#x27;s gunnery lieutenant in 1863–1864, later wrote that most people did not realise at the time what a significant change it would bring about: &quot;It certainly was not appreciated that this, our first armourclad ship of war, would cause a fundamental change in what had been in vogue for something like a thousand years.&quot;

Although built in response to &quot;Gloire&quot;, the &quot;Warrior&quot; had a very different operational concept from the French ship, which was meant to replace wooden ships of the line. The &quot;Warriors&quot; were designed by Watts as 40-gun armoured frigates, not intended to stand in the line of battle, as the Admiralty was uncertain about their ability to withstand concentrated fire from wooden two- and three-deck ships of the line. Unlike &quot;Gloire&quot;, they were planned to be fast enough to force battle on a fleeing enemy and to control to their own advantage the range at which a battle was fought. In contrast to &quot;Gloire&quot;″s square profile, &quot;Warrior&quot; has a clipper bow, but she is twice as long as a typical clipper ship.

HMS &quot;Warrior&quot; is long between perpendiculars and long overall. She has a beam of and a draught of . The ship displaces and has a tonnage of 6,109 tons burthen. The ship&#x27;s length made her relatively unmanoeuvrable, making it harder for her to use her strengthened stem for ramming, an ancient tactic that was coming back into use at the time. The ends of the hull are subdivided by watertight transverse bulkheads and decks into 92 compartments, and the hull has a double bottom underneath the engine and boiler rooms.

===Armament===

The armament of the &quot;Warrior&quot;-class ships was originally intended to be 40 smoothbore, muzzle-loading 68-pounder guns, 19 on each side on the main deck and one each fore and aft as chase guns on the upper deck. The 68-pounder had a range of with (solid) round shot. During construction the armament was changed to include 10 Armstrong 110-pounder guns, an early rifled breech loader (RBL) design, along with 26 68-pounders, and four RBL Armstrong 40-pounder guns with a calibre of and a maximum range of . It had been planned to replace all the 68-pounders with the innovative 110-pounder, whose shell could reach , but poor results in armour-penetration tests halted this. During the first use in action of a 110-pounder aboard HMS &quot;Euryalus&quot; in 1863, the gun was incorrectly loaded and the vent piece was blown out of the breech when fired. They were labour-intensive to load and fire, and were henceforth only used with a reduced propellant charge, which left them ineffective against ironclad ships.

All the guns could fire either solid shot or explosive shells. The 68-pounders could also fire molten iron shells, filled with iron melted in a furnace between the two forward boilers. The 40-pounder Armstrong guns were replaced with a better design of the same calibre in 1863. &quot;Warrior&quot;″s original armament was replaced during her 1864–1867 refit with 24 7-inch and four rifled muzzle-loading (RML) guns. The ship also received four RBL Armstrong 20-pounders for use as saluting guns. The RML 8-inch gun could penetrate of wrought iron armour at the muzzle, and the RML 7-inch gun could pierce .

===Armour===

&quot;Warrior&quot;″s armour consisted of of wrought iron backed by of teak. The iron armour was made up of plates that interlocked by the tongue and groove method. It was bolted through the teak to the iron hull. The teak consisted of two layers laid at right angles to each other; they strengthened the armour by damping the shock waves caused by the impact of shells that would otherwise break the bolts connecting the armour to the hull. Unlike most later ship armour, &quot;Warrior&quot;″s armour was made by a process of hammering rather than rolling. Based on tests at Shoeburyness in October 1861 when the &quot;Warrior&quot; was launched, it &quot;was practically invulnerable to the ordnance at the time in use&quot;.

The armour covered the middle of the ship and extended above the waterline and below it. The guns on the main deck were protected from raking fire by 4.5-inch transverse bulkheads. The ends of the ship were unprotected, but were subdivided into watertight compartments to minimise flooding. The lack of armour at the stern rendered the steering gear and rudder vulnerable.

===Crew===
The ship&#x27;s crew comprised 50 officers and 656 ratings in 1863. The majority of the crew had to do physically demanding tasks; one such duty was the raising of the heaviest manually hauled anchors in maritime history. The day-to-day life of her crew differed little from those on the navy&#x27;s traditional wooden-hulled vessels.

The majority of the crew lived on the single gun deck of the &quot;Warrior&quot;; these crewmen slept in hammocks slung from the sides and deck beams, with up to 18 men between each pair of guns. The officers berthed in the rear of the ship in small individual cabins; the wardroom was also the officers&#x27; mess. The captain had two spacious, well-furnished cabins.

Of the ratings, 122 were Royal Marines. As an experiment during the ship&#x27;s first commission, all of &quot;Warrior&quot;&#x27;s marines were from Royal Marine Artillery; subsequently some marine infantrymen were assigned as was the usual naval practice. The marines manned the aft section of guns and slung their hammocks between the crew&#x27;s accommodation and the officers&#x27; cabins.

===Propulsion===

&quot;Warrior&quot; had a two-cylinder trunk steam engine, made by John Penn and Sons, driving a single propeller using steam provided by 10 rectangular boilers. The engine produced a total of during &quot;Warrior&quot;″s sea trials on 1 April 1868 giving a speed of under steam alone. The ship carried of coal, enough to steam at .

The ironclad was ship rigged and had a sail area of . &quot;Warrior&quot; reached under sail alone, faster than her sister ship . She had the largest hoisting propeller ever made; it weighed , and 600 men could raise it into the ship to reduce drag while under sail. To further reduce drag, both her funnels were telescopic and could be lowered. Under sail and steam together, the ship once reached against the tide while running from Portsmouth to Plymouth.

==Construction and service==
&quot;Warrior&quot; was ordered on 11 May 1859 from Thames Ironworks and Shipbuilding Company in Blackwall, London. The ship was laid down some time after 6 June 1859 on the West Ham side of Bow Creek when the P&amp;O ocean liner &quot;Seine&quot; was launched, and the slipway was reinforced to support &quot;Warrior&quot;″s weight. Full-scale production of the ship&#x27;s iron began in August, and the construction probably began in mid-August. Indecision by the Admiralty and frequent design changes caused many delays and nearly drove her builders bankrupt before a grant of £50,000 was awarded to keep them solvent. Her launching on 29 December 1860 was during the coldest winter for 50 years. She was frozen to her slipway and required the use of hydraulic rams, additional tugs, and dockworkers running from side to side on the upper deck to rock her free. &quot;Warrior&quot; was commissioned in August 1861 to conduct her sea trials; she was completed on 24 October for £377,292, almost twice the cost of a contemporary wooden ship of the line. Between March and June 1862, defects exposed during her trials were rectified, and damage repaired. Changes included the fitting of a lighter bowsprit and a shorter jib boom, along with the provision of extra heads amidships.

The ship was initially assigned to the Channel Squadron under the command of Captain Arthur Cochrane. In March 1863, &quot;Warrior&quot; escorted the royal yacht that brought Princess Alexandra of Denmark to Britain to marry the Prince of Wales. The princess appreciated the conduct of the ship&#x27;s crew, and requested Admiral Sir Michael Seymour to convey to the ship that &quot;she was much pleased&quot;. Cochrane had the message engraved on a brass plate and fitted to the ship&#x27;s wheel. Her descendant, Princess Alexandra of Kent, is now patron of the HMS &quot;Warrior&quot; 1860 Trust. In mid-1863 the Channel Fleet toured British ports for 12 weeks; the ship received 300,000 visitors, including as many as 13,000 a day in port. On 19 September, she rescued the survivors of the Mersey Flat &quot;Mary Agnes&quot;, which had sunk in a collision with the Isle of Man Steam Packet Company&#x27;s ship at Liverpool, Lancashire.

&quot;Warrior&quot; began a refit in November 1864 during which the Armstrong guns, which had not proved successful in use, were removed and her armament was upgraded to the latest rifled muzzle-loading guns. She was recommissioned in 1867, under the command of Captain John Corbett, to relieve her sister as the guardship at Queenstown in Ireland, but instead both ships participated in the Fleet Review held on 17 July in honour of the visits made by the Khedive of Egypt and the Sultan of Turkey to Britain. After the review, the Admiralty paid off the ship on 24 July; the following day &quot;Warrior&quot; was recommissioned with Captain Henry Boys in command. After working up at Spithead, she sailed to join the Channel Squadron on 24 September. At the end of the year she was deployed to Osborne Bay to guard Queen Victoria at Osborne House. The Fenian Rising was under way, and there was intelligence suggesting that the Queen might be in danger from Irish nationalists. While &quot;Warrior&quot; was performing this duty, she received an informal visit from the Queen. The ship was part of a squadron that escorted the royal yacht to Dublin in April 1868 for an official visit by the Prince of Wales, the future King Edward VII. In August, while cruising to Scotland, &quot;Warrior&quot; collided with , losing her figurehead and jib boom and smashing &quot;Royal Oak&quot;″s cutter. Captain Boys was court-martialled and acquitted over the incident.

From 4 to 28 July 1869, &quot;Warrior&quot;, with &quot;Black Prince&quot; and the wooden paddle frigate , towed a specially built floating drydock, large enough to accommodate ironclads, across the Atlantic from Madeira to Bermuda. Upon her return to England in late August 1869, Boys was relieved by Captain Frederick Stirling. After a refit to clean her hull and replace the figurehead lost in the collision, &quot;Warrior&quot; rejoined the Channel Squadron. On 2 March 1870, Captain Henry Glyn assumed command of the ship. While returning from a joint cruise with the Mediterranean Fleet, the ship was present when was lost during a severe storm on 7 September. Further cruises followed, including trips to Madeira and Gibraltar. &quot;Warrior&quot; narrowly missed colliding with when she was following her out of Gibraltar and &quot;Agincourt&quot; grounded on Pearl Rock.

The rapid evolution of warship design, for which &quot;Warrior&quot; was partly responsible, meant that she started to become obsolete only ten years after she had been launched. In 1871 the Royal Navy commissioned its first mastless capital ship, . In the absence of masts, the main armament could move from the broadside and traverse more freely from a higher position. In the same year, &quot;Warrior&quot; began a refit that lasted until 1875; it added a poop deck and steam capstan, a shorter bowsprit, and replacement boilers. In April 1875, the ship was recommissioned, and assigned to the First Reserve, where she served as a guardship at Portland. In this role, she went on annual summer cruises to various ports. During the Russo-Turkish War of 1877–1878, she was mobilised due to concerns that the victorious Russians might be about to attack Constantinople, forcing Great Britain to intervene, but nothing transpired and &quot;Warrior&quot; cruised to Bantry Bay instead. In April 1881 she was transferred to the Clyde District, where she served as guardship until 31 May 1883. Two of her masts were discovered to be rotten that month and with no replacements available, the ship was decommissioned and the masts removed.

&quot;Warrior&quot; was reclassified as a &quot;screw battle ship, third class, armoured&quot; in 1887 and again in May 1892 as a first-class armoured cruiser, although no changes were made to her. She was considered for modernization as late as 1894, but this was rejected as uneconomical after at least one new boiler was installed. She was struck off the effective list at Portsmouth and classified as hulk in March 1900. The ship was used as a storage hulk from May 1901 to July 1902. In preparation for her service as a depot ship for a flotilla of destroyers, the ship had her engines and boilers removed and part of her upper deck roofed over. &quot;Warrior&quot; served in this role from July 1902, under the command of Captain John de Robeck. In March 1904, she was assigned to the Portsmouth-based , the Royal Navy&#x27;s torpedo-training school. Her name was changed to &quot;Vernon III&quot; that month in order to release her name for a new armoured cruiser , and six new Belleville boilers and four electric generators were installed so that she could supply steam and electricity to the neighbouring hulks that made up &quot;Vernon&quot;. Most of the upper deck was roofed over to form classrooms for radio training, and her fore and mizzen masts were reinstalled. In October 1923, the school was transferred to a newly built shore installation, rendering &quot;Warrior&quot; and her companion hulks redundant; &quot;Warrior&quot; resumed her name on 1 October and the Royal Navy declared her redundant six months later.
The mass scrapping of obsolete ships after World War I had caused a downturn in demand for scrap iron by the time the Navy decided to sell off &quot;Warrior&quot; on 2 April 1925. There was no commercial interest in scrapping the old ship, and she remained at Portsmouth for another four years. She was modified into a mooring jetty beginning on 22 October 1927. This entailed the removal of all of her equipment and masts other than her boilers and generators, and the installation of two diesel-driven emergency pumps. The space under the poop was converted into accommodation for a shipkeeper and his family. The hulk was towed to her new home, Pembroke Dock in Wales, on 13 March 1929 where she served as a floating oil jetty. For the next fifty years, the ship lay just offshore from an oil depot at Llanion Cove. The Navy covered the ship&#x27;s upper deck with a thick layer of concrete during one of her maintenance dockings before World War II. In the war, she served as a base ship for coastal minesweepers and, on 27 August 1942, was once again renamed as &quot;Oil Fuel Hulk C77&quot; to release her name for use by a light aircraft carrier, , then under construction. She refuelled 5,000 ships during her service at Llanion Cove.

==Preservation==

Restoring &quot;Warrior&quot; was discussed in the early 1960s, but did not develop into a serious project. In 1967, the Greater London Council proposed to restore the ship as an attraction in London, but &quot;Warrior&quot; was still required in Pembroke by the Royal Navy and the scheme went no further. In 1968 the Duke of Edinburgh chaired a meeting that discussed preserving and restoring &quot;Warrior&quot; and other historic vessels, and a year later The Maritime Trust was established to save the decrepit ironclad and other historic ships. The Maritime Trust and a major supporter, the Manifold Trust led by the Conservative Member of Parliament (MP) John Smith, maintained an interest in &quot;Warrior&quot;. In 1976 the Royal Navy announced that the Llanion Oil Depot would close in 1978, and the Manifold Trust began to seek funds to restore her. With the promise of financial support for restoration, the Royal Navy donated the ship to the trust in 1979. The Ship&#x27;s Preservation Trust acquired ownership of the ship in 1983; it became the Warrior Preservation Trust in 1985.

===Restoration===
In August 1979 &quot;Warrior&quot; began her journey to her temporary home in the Coal Dock at Hartlepool for restoration as a museum ship. She arrived on 2 September 1979 and began the £9 million restoration project, largely funded by the Manifold Trust. The Maritime Trust decided to restore &quot;Warrior&quot; to her 1862 condition with the aim that no further major work would be necessary for the next 20 years. The first two years of the restoration were generally devoted to safely removing material added after her first commission, like the poop deck and the of concrete decking. Intensive research was done to find detailed descriptions of the ship and her equipment as of 1862 to make the restoration as accurate as economically feasible. Sources included surviving official records, and the papers of those who had served on the ship during her active service. Bolt-holes and ridges in the paint gave clues to the location of some fittings and fixtures, and the sketch plans of Midshipman Henry Murray, found in Captain Cochrane&#x27;s Letter Book, showed the locations of the armament, moveable fittings and stores.

Work on carving a replacement for &quot;Warrior&quot;″s figurehead, which was destroyed in the 1960s, began in 1981 using photographs of the original as a guide. The work-in-progress was displayed at the 1982 London International Boat Show with the carvers, Jack Whitehead and Norman Gaches from the Isle of Wight, still at work; it dominated coverage of the show. Before it was finished in mid-1983, the figurehead appeared on the BBC children&#x27;s television programme &quot;Blue Peter&quot;. For much of 1984 it was displayed at the Main Gate of the Portsmouth Royal Dockyard. It was mounted on the ship on 6 February 1985.

Replacement of the ship&#x27;s , lower masts in wood was not feasible, so they were made of steel tube cut and welded to shape, with a ladder inside each mast to allow access to the platforms on the masts. The three masts and the bowsprit were stepped in place between September 1984 and February 1985. &quot;Warrior&quot;″s engines, boilers and auxiliary machinery were considered too expensive to rebuild, so replicas were built from sheet steel with a few components made from cast iron to duplicate the look of the real equipment. The replica engines can rotate slowly, using electrical power, to allow visitors to imagine how they might have looked in operation.

The Woolwich Rotunda Artillery Museum and the States of Jersey lent examples of &quot;Warrior&quot;″s original primary guns, the muzzle-loading 68-pounder and the breech-loading 110-pounder, which were used as moulds for fibreglass replicas. The Armstrong guns were built with working breeches; they, and the muzzles of all the guns, had to be sealed to prevent people leaving rubbish in them. Little information was available on the wooden gun carriages despite extensive research, and a prototype had to be developed and tested before they could be built.

===Museum ship===
In 1985 a new berth beside Portsmouth Harbour railway station was dredged, and a new jetty constructed in preparation for &quot;Warrior&quot; arrival in Portsmouth. The ship left Hartlepool on 12 June 1987 under the command of Captain Collin Allen and was towed to the Solent in four days. When she entered Portsmouth Harbour she was welcomed by thousands of people lining the town walls and shore, and by over 90 boats and ships. She opened as a museum on 27 July. The restored ironclad was renamed HMS &quot;Warrior&quot; (1860) to avoid confusion with the Northwood Headquarters, commissioned as HMS &quot;Warrior&quot; in 1963, which was at the time the operational headquarters of the Royal Navy.

&quot;Warrior&quot; is part of the National Historic Fleet, and is berthed in the Portsmouth Historic Dockyard complex, which is also the home of Nelson&#x27;s flagship , the Tudor warship &quot;Mary Rose&quot;, and First World War-era monitor . In 1995 she received over 280,000 visitors, and the whole dockyard receives between 400,000 and 500,000 visitors annually. &quot;Warrior&quot; continued to be managed by the Warrior Preservation Trust until 2017. In April of that year, the trust was taken over by the National Museum of the Royal Navy and &quot;Warrior&quot; became part of the museum&#x27;s fleet. The ship continues to be used as a venue for weddings and functions to generate funds for her maintenance. The trust also maintained a collection of material related to the ship and an archive, although it is not yet open to the public.

<doc id="370528" wikidata="Q754632" url="?curid=370528" title="Athabasca oil sands">
<text>The Athabasca oil sands, also known as the Athabasca tar sands, are large deposits of oil sands rich in bitumen, a heavy and viscous form of petroleum, in northeastern Alberta, Canada. These reserves are one of the largest sources of unconventional oil in the world, making Canada a significant player in the global energy market.

As of 2023, Canada&#x27;s oil sands industry, along with Western Canada and offshore petroleum facilities near Newfoundland and Labrador, continued to increase production and were projected to increase by an estimated 10% in 2024 representing a potential record high at the end of the year of approximately 5.3 million barrels per day (bpd). The surge in production is attributed mainly to growth in Alberta&#x27;s oilsands. The expansion of the Trans Mountain pipelinethe only oil pipeline to the West Coastwill further facilitate this increase, with its capacity set to increase significantly, to 890,000 barrels per day from 300,000 bpd currently. Despite this growth, there are warnings that it might be short-lived, with production potentially plateauing after 2024. Canada&#x27;s anticipated increase in oil output exceeds that of other major producers like the United States, and the country is poised to become a significant driver of global crude oil production growth in 2024. The exploitation of these resources has stirred debates regarding economic development, energy security, and environmental impacts, particularly emissions from the oilsands, prompting discussions around emissions regulations for the oil and gas sector.

The Athabasca oil sands, along with the nearby Peace River and Cold Lake deposits oil sand deposits lie under of boreal forest and muskeg (peat bogs) according to Government of Alberta&#x27;s Ministry of Energy, Alberta Energy Regulator (AER) and the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers (CAPP).

== History ==

The Athabasca oil sands are named after the Athabasca River which cuts through the heart of the deposit, and traces of the heavy oil are readily observed on the river banks. Historically, the bitumen was used by the indigenous Cree and Dene Aboriginal peoples to waterproof their canoes. The oil deposits are located within the boundaries of Treaty 8, and several First Nations of the area are involved with the sands.

===Early history===


The Athabasca oil sands first came to the attention of European fur traders in 1719 when Wa-pa-su, a Cree trader, brought a sample of bituminous sands to the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company post at York Factory on Hudson Bay where Henry Kelsey was the manager. In 1778, Peter Pond, another fur trader and a founder of the rival North West Company, became the first European to see the Athabasca deposits after exploring the Methye Portage which allowed access to the rich fur resources of the Athabasca River system from the Hudson Bay watershed.

In 1788, fur trader Alexander Mackenzie, after whom the Mackenzie River was later named, traveled along routes to both the Arctic and Pacific Ocean wrote: &quot;At about from the fork (of the Athabasca and Clearwater Rivers) are some bituminous fountains into which a pole of long may be inserted without the least resistance. The bitumen is in a fluid state and when mixed with gum, the resinous substance collected from the spruce fir, it serves to gum the Indians&#x27; canoes.&quot; He was followed in 1799 by mapmaker David Thompson and in 1819 by British Naval officer John Franklin.

John Richardson did the first serious scientific assessment of the oil sands in 1848 on his way north to search for Franklin&#x27;s lost expedition. The first government-sponsored survey of the oil sands was initiated in 1875 by John Macoun, and in 1883, G. C. Hoffman of the Geological Survey of Canada tried separating the bitumen from oil sand with the use of water and reported that it separated readily. In 1888, Robert Bell, the director of the Geological Survey of Canada, reported to a Senate Committee that &quot;The evidence ... points to the existence in the Athabasca and Mackenzie valleys of the most extensive petroleum field in America, if not the world.&quot;

Count Alfred von Hammerstein (1870–1941), who arrived in the region in 1897, promoted the Athabasca oil sands for over forty years, taking photos with descriptive titles such as &quot;Tar Sands and Flowing Asphaltum in the Athabasca District,&quot; that are now in the National Library and National Archives Canada. Photos of the Athabasca oil sands were also featured in Canadian writer and adventurer, Agnes Deans Cameron&#x27;s, best-selling book &quot;The New North&quot; which recounted her roundtrip to the Arctic Ocean. Her photographs were reproduced in 2011–2012 in an exhibit at the Canadian Museum of Civilization in Ottawa, and included photos of Count Alfred Von Hammerstein&#x27;s oil drill works along the Athabasca River.

In 1926, Karl Clark of the University of Alberta received a patent for a hot water separation process which was the forerunner of today&#x27;s thermal extraction processes. Several attempts to implement it had varying degrees of success.

===Project Oilsand===

Project Oilsand was a 1958 proposal to exploit the Athabasca oil sands using the underground detonation of nuclear explosives; hypothetically, the heat and pressure created by an underground detonation would boil the bitumen deposits, reducing their viscosity to the point that standard oilfield techniques could be used. The plan was discussed in the October 1976 &quot;Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists&quot;. A patent was granted for the intended process in 1964. The nuclear heating option is considered a forerunner to some of the conventional heating methods used to extract tar sands oil.

In April 1959, the Federal Mines Department approved Project Oilsand. However, it was subsequently cancelled in 1962.

===Great Canadian Oil Sands===
The oil sands, which are typically thick and sit on top of relatively flat limestone, are relatively easy to access. They lie under of waterlogged muskeg, of clay and barren sand. As a result of the easy accessibility, the world&#x27;s first oil-sands mine was in the Athabasca oil sands.

Commercial production of oil from the Athabasca oil sands began in 1967, with the opening of the Great Canadian Oil Sands (GCOS) plant in Fort McMurray. It was the first operational oil sands project in the world, owned and operated by the American parent company, Sun Oil Company. When the US$240 million plant officially opened with a capacity of , it marked the beginning of commercial development of the Athabasca oil sands. In 2013 McKenzie-Brown listed industrialist J. Howard Pew as one of the six visionaries who built the Athabasca oil sands. By the time of his death in 1971, the Pew family were ranked by &quot;Forbes&quot; magazine as one of the half-dozen wealthiest families in America. The Great Canadian Oil Sands Limited (then a subsidiary of Sun Oil Company but now incorporated into an independent company known as Suncor Energy Inc.) produced of synthetic crude oil.

=== Oil crisis ===

The true size of the Canadian oil sands deposits became known in the 1970s. The Syncrude mine is now the largest mine (by area) in the world, with mines potentially covering . (Although there is oil underlying , which may be disturbed by drilling and in situ extraction, only may potentially be surface mined, and has to date been mined.)

Development was inhibited by declining world oil prices, and the second mine, operated by the Syncrude consortium, did not begin operating until 1978, after the 1973 oil crisis sparked investor interest. However, the price of oil subsided afterwards and although the 1979 energy crisis caused oil prices to peak again, during the 1980s, oil prices declined to very low levels causing considerable retrenchment in the oil industry.

In 1979, Sun formed Suncor by merging its Canadian refining and retailing interests with Great Canadian Oil Sands and its conventional oil and gas interests. In 1981, the Government of Ontario purchased a 25% stake in the company but divested it in 1993. In 1995, Sun Oil also divested its interest in the company, although Suncor maintained the Sunoco retail brand in Canada. Suncor took advantage of these two divestitures to become an independent, widely held public company.

Suncor continued to grow and continued to produce more and more oil from its oil sands operations regardless of fluctuating market prices, and eventually became bigger than its former parent company. In 2009, Suncor acquired the formerly Canadian government owned oil company, Petro-Canada, which turned Suncor into the largest petroleum company in Canada and one of the biggest Canadian companies. Suncor Energy is now a Canadian company completely unaffiliated with its former American parent company. Sun Oil Company became known as Sunoco, but later left the oil production and refining business, and has since become a retail gasoline distributor owned by Energy Transfer Partners of Dallas, Texas. In Canada, Suncor Energy converted all of its Sunoco stations (which were all in Ontario) to Petro-Canada sites in order to unify all of its downstream retail operations under the Petro-Canada banner and discontinue paying licensing fees for the Sunoco brand. Nationwide, Petro-Canada&#x27;s upstream product supplier and parent company is Suncor Energy. Suncor Energy continues to operate just one Sunoco retail site in Ontario.

==Oil sands production in the 21st century==
At the turn of the 21st century, oil sands development in Canada started to take off, with an expansion at the Suncor mine, a new mine and expansion at Syncrude, and a new mine by Royal Dutch Shell associated with their new Scotford Upgrader near Edmonton. Three new large steam-assisted gravity drainage (SAGD) projects were added – Foster Creek, Surmont, and MacKay River – by different companies, all of which have since been bought by larger companies.

Shell Canada&#x27;s third mine began operating in 2003. However, as a result of oil price increases since 2003, the existing mines have been greatly expanded and new ones were built.

According to the Alberta Energy and Utilities Board, 2005 production of crude bitumen in the Athabasca oil sands was as follows:
:

As of 2006, oil sands production had increased to . Oil sands were by then the source of 62% of Alberta&#x27;s total oil production and 47% of all oil produced in Canada. As of 2010, oil sands production had increased to over to exceed conventional oil production in Canada. 53% of this was produced by surface mining and 47% by in-situ techniques. In 2012, oil production from oil sands was .

=== Shale oil boom ===

The massive development of tight oil extraction in the Bakken and Permian Basin in the United States transformed the oil industry rapidly, reducing importation of foreign oil dramatically. As with the oil sands, production costs of shale oil are higher than those of conventional oil. A combination of factors, among them oversupply and geopolitical rivalries, drove the price of oil down from more than 100 dollars a barrel in 2013 to less than 40 dollars three years later. Lingering low oil prices prompted companies to cancel new investments in the oil sands.

=== Fort McMurray wildfire ===
From May to July 2016, a wildfire spread from Fort McMurray across northern Alberta, burning approximately of forested areas and destroying approximately 2,400 homes and buildings. 88,000 people were forced from their homes in what became the largest wildfire evacuation in Alberta&#x27;s history and the costliest disaster in Canadian history.

The wildfire halted oil sands production at facilities north of Fort McMurray. Shell Canada shut down output at its Albian Sands mining operation. Suncor Energy and Syncrude Canada also scaled back operations and evacuated employees and their families. Approximately one million barrels of oil a day, equal to a quarter of Canada&#x27;s oil production, was halted as a result of the fire in May. This continued into June at a rate of 700,000 barrels per day. The lost output was a contributing factor to rises in global oil prices. The scaled back operations, along with a refinery outage in Edmonton, caused many gas stations to run out of gas throughout Western Canada.
In 2018, oil sands production reached .

Until 2014, industry groups believed oil sands production levels could reach by 2030. As of 2021, after a slowdown in investment, analyst are predicting it could reach by that time.

=== Transportation ===
Canada is the largest source of oil imported by the United States, supplying chiefly from oil sands sources as of 2019.

Industry observers went from believing there might be excess pipeline capacity to warning that it was insufficient to accommodate oil sands production growth, after several pipeline projects were abandoned or cancelled.

The North Gateway project to Kitimat, British Columbia, which would have been built by Enbridge, operator of the Enbridge Pipeline System which also serves the area, was cancelled in 2016. Similarly, after lengthy environmentalist and First Nation group opposition, Keystone XL, a pipeline project from Alberta to Gulf coast refineries, was cancelled in 2021. Other projects, using existing rights of way, are being built, like Kinder Morgan&#x27;s Trans Mountain Expansion, nationalized in 2018, or Enbridge&#x27;s Line 9, reversed to feed refineries in Quebec. Between January 2019 and December 2020, the Alberta government imposed a quota to adjust production to pipeline export capacity.

To compensate for pipeline capacity limitations, shipment of oil by rail increased from less than 50 thousand to between 2012 and 2020.

== Future production ==

As of December 2008, the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers revised its 2008–2020 crude oil forecasts to account for project cancellations and cutbacks as a result of the price declines in the second half of 2008. The revised forecast predicted that Canadian oil sands production would continue to grow, but at a slower rate than previously predicted. There would be minimal changes to 2008–2012 production, but by 2020 production could be less than its prior predictions. This would mean that Canadian oil sands production would grow from in 2008 to in 2020, and that total Canadian oil production would grow from in 2020. Even accounting for project cancellations, this would place Canada among the four or five largest oil-producing countries in the world by 2020.

In early December 2007, London-based BP and Calgary-based Husky Energy announced a 50–50 joint venture to produce and refine bitumen from the Athabasca oil sands. BP would contribute its Toledo, Ohio refinery to the joint venture, while Husky would contribute its Sunrise oil sands project. Sunrise was planned to start producing of bitumen in 2012 and may reach by 2015–2020. BP would modify its Toledo refinery to process of bitumen directly to refined products. The joint venture would solve problems for both companies, since Husky was short of refining capacity, and BP had no presence in the oil sands. It was a change of strategy for BP, since the company historically has downplayed the importance of oil sands.

In mid December 2007, ConocoPhillips announced its intention to increase its oil sands production from to over the next 20 years, which would make it the largest private sector oil sands producer in the world. ConocoPhillips currently holds the largest position in the Canadian oil sands with over under lease. Other major oil sands producers planning to increase their production include Royal Dutch Shell (to ); Syncrude Canada (to ); Suncor Energy (to ) and Canadian Natural Resources (to ). If all these plans come to fruition, these five companies will be producing over of oil from oil sands by 2028.

== Governance ==

The governance of the Alberta oil sands is focused on economic development, and has historically been dominated by the interests of two primary actors; government (federal and provincial) and industry. Canadian federalism forms the functions and roles of each level of government, in that constitutional power is split so that neither is superior to the other. The Constitution Act, 1867, Section 109 ensures the province full ownership of the lands and resources within its borders. The province acts as the landowner and the federal government oversees jurisdiction over trade, commerce and taxation. There is a clear overlap, as resource management influences trade, and trade management influences resources. As of the 1990s, both the federal and provincial government have been aligned, focusing on regulation, technology and the development of new export markets. The majority of &quot;ground-level&quot; governance is carried out by a number of provincial institutions.

Ottawa has avoided direct investment, preferring to improve the investment climate. A prime example of this occurred in 1994, when the federal government rolled out tax breaks allowing 100% of oil sands capital investments to be written off as accelerated capital cost allowances. The provincial government had a much more direct role in development; investing directly in numerous pilot projects, undertaking joint ventures with the industry and consistently making massive investments in research and development. Some people have claimed that Alberta features one of the lowest royalty rates in the world. Since Alberta, unlike US states, owns the vast majority of oil under its surface it can exercise more control over it, whereas US states are limited to severance taxes. This industry-centric royalty system has been criticised for &quot;promoting a runaway pace of development&quot;.

Industry is the core force of oil sands development. The first major players, Suncor Energy and Syncrude, dominated the market until the 1990s. Currently there are 64 companies operating several hundred projects. The majority of production now comes from foreign-owned corporations, and the maintenance of a favourable climate for these corporations grants them strong influence; much stronger than that of non-productive stakeholders, such as citizens and environmental groups.

Governance (policy, administration, regulation) over the oil sands is held almost entirely by the Ministry of Energy (Alberta) and its various departments. Critics noted a clear and systemic lack of public involvement at all key stages of the governance process. In answer to this, the province initiated the Oil Sands Consultations Multistakeholder Committee (MSC) in 2006. The MSC represents four organisations: the Cumulative Environmental Management Association (CEMA), the Wood Buffalo Environmental Association (WBEA), the Canadian Oil Sands Network for Research and Development (CONRAD) and the Athabasca Regional Issues Working Group (RIWG). The role of the MSC is to consult and make recommendations on management principles. The recommendations contained in the MSC&#x27;s first 2007 Final Report were lauded by several ministers and government representatives, but none have yet been effectively passed into law.

On October 17, 2012, the Alberta government announced it would follow the recommendations of a working group to develop an agency that would monitor the environmental impact of the oil sands. &quot;The new science-based agency will begin work in the oil sands region and will focus on what is monitored, how it&#x27;s monitored and where it&#x27;s monitored. This will include integrated and coordinated monitoring of land, air, water and biodiversity,&quot; said a press release from Diana McQueen&#x27;s office, the Minister of Energy and Sustainable Development. The provincial government moved to develop the agency after widespread public criticism by environmentalists, aboriginal groups and scientists, who claimed the oil sands would have a devastating, long-term effect on the environment if left unchecked.

On 17 June 2013 the newly formed corporation, Alberta Energy Regulator (AER) was phased in with a mandate to regulate oil, gas and coal development in Alberta including the Athabasca oil sands. The AER brings together &quot;the regulatory functions from the Energy Resources Conservation Board and the Alberta Ministry of Environment and Sustainable Resource Development into a one-stop shop&quot; The Alberta Energy Regulator is now &quot;responsible for all projects from application to reclamation.&quot; They will respond to project proponents, landowners and industry regarding energy regulations in Alberta. The Responsible Energy Development Act gave the Alberta Energy Regulator &quot;the authority to administer the Public Lands Act, the Environmental Protection and Enhancement Act and the Water Act, with regards to energy development.&quot; The Alberta Energy Regulator will enforce environmental laws and issue environmental and water permits, responsibilities formerly the mandate of Alberta Environment.

== Development ==

The key characteristic of the Athabasca deposit is that it is the only one shallow enough to be suitable for surface mining. About 10% of the Athabasca oil sands are covered by less than of overburden. Until 2009, the surface mineable area (SMA) was defined by the ERCB, an agency of the Alberta government, to cover 37 contiguous townships (about ) north of Fort McMurray. In June 2009, the SMA was expanded to townships, or about . This expansion pushes the northern limit of the SMA to within of Wood Buffalo National Park, a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

The Albian Sands mine (operated by Shell Canada) opened in 2003. All three of these mines are associated with bitumen upgraders that convert the unusable bitumen into synthetic crude oil for shipment to refineries in Canada and the United States. For Albian, the upgrader is at Scotford, 439 km south. The bitumen, diluted with a solvent, is transferred there in a corridor pipeline.

The Energy Resource Conservation Board has approved over 100 mining and in-situ projects despite the negative environmental impacts. As of 2012, there were 9 active open mining projects, more than 50 approved in-situ projects as well as 190 primary recovery projects extracting bitumen that is free flowing. The ERCB has also approved 20 projects that are testing unproven technology as well as new versions of existing technologies.

== Bitumen extraction ==
===Surface mining===
Since Great Canadian Oil Sands (now Suncor) started operation of its mine in 1967, bitumen has been extracted on a commercial scale from the Athabasca Oil Sands by surface mining. In the Athabasca sands there are very large amounts of bitumen covered by little overburden, making surface mining the most efficient method of extracting it. The overburden consists of water-laden muskeg (peat bog) over top of clay and barren sand. The oil sands themselves are typically deep, sitting on top of flat limestone rock. Originally, the sands were mined with draglines and bucket-wheel excavators and moved to the processing plants by conveyor belts.

These early mines had a steep learning curve to deal with before their bitumen mining techniques became efficient. In the intervening years, more effective in-situ production techniques were developed, particularly steam-assisted gravity drainage (SAGD). In-situ methods became increasingly important because only about 20% of the Athabasca oil sands were shallow enough to recover by surface mining, and the SAGD method in particular was very efficient at recovering large amounts of bitumen at a reasonable cost.

In recent years, companies such as Syncrude and Suncor have switched to much cheaper shovel-and-truck operations using the biggest power shovels (at least ) and dump trucks () in the world. This has held production costs to around US$27 per barrel of synthetic crude oil despite rising energy and labour costs.

After excavation, hot water and caustic soda (sodium hydroxide) is added to the sand, and the resulting slurry is piped to the extraction plant where it is agitated and the oil skimmed from the top. Provided that the water chemistry is appropriate to allow bitumen to separate from sand and clay, the combination of hot water and agitation releases bitumen from the oil sand, and allows small air bubbles to attach to the bitumen droplets. The bitumen froth floats to the top of separation vessels, and is further treated to remove residual water and fine solids.

About of oil sands are required to produce one barrel () of oil. Originally, roughly 75% of the bitumen was recovered from the sand. However, recent enhancements to this method include Tailings Oil Recovery (TOR) units which recover oil from the tailings, Diluent Recovery Units to recover naphtha from the froth, inclined plate settlers (IPS) and disc centrifuges. These allow the extraction plants to recover well over 90% of the bitumen in the sand. After oil extraction, the spent sand and other materials are then returned to the mine, which is eventually reclaimed.

Alberta Taciuk Process technology extracts bitumen from oil sands through a dry retorting. During this process, oil sand is moved through a rotating drum, cracking the bitumen with heat and producing lighter hydrocarbons. Although tested, this technology is not in commercial use yet.

The original process for extraction of bitumen from the sands was developed by Dr. Karl Clark, working with the Alberta Research Council in the 1920s. Today, all of the producers doing surface mining, such as Syncrude Canada, Suncor Energy and Albian Sands Energy etc., use a variation of the Clark Hot Water Extraction (CHWE) process. In this process, the ores are mined using open-pit mining technology. The mined ore is then crushed for size reduction. Hot water at is added to the ore and the formed slurry is transported using hydrotransport line to a primary separation vessel (PSV) where bitumen is recovered by flotation as bitumen froth. The recovered bitumen froth consists of 60% bitumen, 30% water and 10% solids by weight.

The recovered bitumen froth needs to be cleaned to reject the contained solids and water to meet the requirement of downstream upgrading processes. Depending on the bitumen content in the ore, between 90 and 100% of the bitumen can be recovered using modern hot water extraction techniques. After oil extraction, the spent sand and other materials are then returned to the mine, which is eventually reclaimed.

=== Steam-assisted gravity drainage ===

Steam-assisted gravity drainage (SAGD) is an enhanced oil recovery technology for producing heavy crude oil and bitumen. It is an advanced form of steam stimulation in which a pair of horizontal wells are drilled into the oil reservoir, one a few metres above the other. High pressure steam is continuously injected into the upper wellbore to heat the oil and reduce its viscosity, causing the heated oil to drain into the lower wellbore, where it is pumped out to a bitumen recovery facility. Dr. Roger Butler, engineer at Imperial Oil from 1955 to 1982, invented steam-assisted gravity drainage (SAGD) in the 1970s. Butler &quot;developed the concept of using horizontal pairs of wells and injected steam to develop certain deposits of bitumen considered too deep for mining.&quot;

More recently, &quot;in situ&quot; methods like steam-assisted gravity drainage (SAGD) and cyclic steam stimulation (CSS) have been developed to extract bitumen from deep deposits by injecting steam to heat the sands and reduce the bitumen viscosity so that it can be pumped out like conventional crude oil.

The standard extraction process requires huge amounts of natural gas. As of 2007, the oil sands industry used about 4% of the Western Canada Sedimentary Basin natural gas production. By 2015, this may increase two-and-a-half-fold.

According to the National Energy Board, it requires about of natural gas to produce one barrel of bitumen from &quot;in situ&quot; projects and about for integrated projects. Since a barrel of oil equivalent is about of gas, this represents a large gain in energy. That being the case, it is likely that Alberta regulators will reduce exports of natural gas to the United States in order to provide fuel to the oil sands plants. As gas reserves are exhausted, however, oil upgraders will probably turn to bitumen gasification to generate their own fuel. In much the same way as bitumen can be converted into synthetic crude oil, it can also be converted into synthetic natural gas.

== Environmental impacts ==


=== Land ===

The oil sands have been described by first nations peoples, scientists, lawyers, journalists and environmental groups as ecocide. Approximately 20% of Alberta&#x27;s oil sands are recoverable through open-pit mining, while 80% require &quot;in situ&quot; extraction technologies (largely because of their depth). Open pit mining destroys the boreal forest and muskeg, while &quot;in situ&quot; extraction technologies cause less significant damage. Approximately 0.19% of the Alberta boreal forest has been disturbed by open pit mining. The Alberta government requires companies to restore the land to &quot;equivalent land capability&quot;. This means that the ability of the land to support various land uses after reclamation is similar to what existed, but that the individual land uses may not necessarily be identical.

In some particular circumstances the government considers agricultural land to be equivalent to forest land. Oil sands companies have reclaimed mined land to use as pasture for wood bison instead of restoring it to the original boreal forest and muskeg. Syncrude asserts they have reclaimed 22% of their disturbed land, a figure disputed by other sources, who assess Syncrude more accurately reclaimed only 0.2% of its disturbed land.

=== Water ===

A Pembina Institute report stated &quot;To produce one cubic metre (m3) [] of synthetic crude oil (SCO) (upgraded bitumen) in a mining operation requires about of water (net figures). Approved oil sands mining operations are currently licensed to divert 359 million m3 from the Athabasca River, or more than twice the volume of water required to meet the annual municipal needs of the City of Calgary.&quot; It went on to say &quot;...the net water requirement to produce a cubic metre of oil with &quot;in situ&quot; production may be as little as , depending on how much is recycled&quot;.

The Athabasca River runs from the Athabasca Glacier in west-central Alberta to Lake Athabasca in northeastern Alberta. The average annual flow just downstream of Fort McMurray is with its highest daily average measuring 1,200 cubic metres per second.

Water licence allocations total about 1% of the Athabasca River average annual flow, though actual withdrawals for all uses, in 2006, amount to about 0.4%. In addition, the Alberta government sets strict limits on how much water oil sands companies can remove from the Athabasca River. According to the Water Management Framework for the Lower Athabasca River, during periods of low river flow water consumption from the Athabasca River is limited to 1.3% of annual average flow. The province of Alberta is also looking into cooperative withdrawal agreements between oil sands operators.

Since the beginning of the oil sands development, there have been several leaks into the Athabasca River polluting it with oil and tailing pond water. The close proximity of the tailing ponds to the river drastically increases the likelihood of contamination due to ground water leakages. In 1997, Suncor admitted that their tailing ponds had been leaking of toxic water into the river a day. This water contains naphthenic acid, trace metals such as mercury and other pollutants. The Athabasca River is the largest freshwater delta in the world but with Suncor and Syncrude leaking tail ponds the amount of polluted water will exceed 1 billion cubic meters by 2020.

Natural toxicants derived from bitumen in Northern Alberta pose potential ecological and human health risks to people living in the area. Oil sands development contributes arsenic, cadmium, chromium, lead, mercury, nickel and other metal elements toxic at low concentrations to the tributaries and rivers of the Athabasca.&lt;ref name=&quot;doi: 10.1073/pnas.1008754107&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Emissions ===

As of 2024, oilsands account for 8% of the total of Canadian emissions. Emissions from the oilsands continue to increase, while most other sources are decreasing.

The processing of bitumen into synthetic crude requires energy generated by burning natural gas. In 2007, the oil sands used around of natural gas per day, around 40% of Alberta&#x27;s total usage. Based on gas purchases, natural gas requirements are given by the Canadian Energy Resource Institute as 2.14 GJ (2.04 thousand cu ft) per barrel for cyclic steam stimulation projects, 1.08 GJ (1.03 thousand cu ft) per barrel for SAGD projects, 0.55 GJ (0.52 thousand cu ft) per barrel for bitumen extraction in mining operations not including upgrading or 1.54 GJ (1.47 thousand cu ft) per barrel for extraction and upgrading in mining operations.

A 2009 study by CERA estimated that production from Canada&#x27;s oil sands emits &quot;about 5 percent to 15 percent more carbon dioxide, over the &quot;well-to-wheels&quot; lifetime analysis of the fuel, than average crude oil.&quot; Author and investigative journalist David Strahan that same year stated that IEA figures show that carbon dioxide emissions from the oil sands are 20% higher than average emissions from oil, explaining the discrepancy as the difference between upstream emissions and life cycle emissions. He goes on to say that a US government report in 2005 suggested with current technology conventional oil releases 40 kg of carbon dioxide per barrel while non-conventional oil releases 80–115 kg of carbon dioxide. Alberta energy suggests lower releases of carbon with improving technology, giving a value of 39% drop in emissions per barrel between 1990 and 2008, however only a 29% reduction between 1990 and 2009.

The forecast growth in synthetic oil production in Alberta also threatens Canada&#x27;s international commitments. In ratifying the Kyoto Protocol, Canada agreed to reduce, by 2012, its greenhouse gas emissions by 6% with respect to 1990. In 2002, Canada&#x27;s total greenhouse gas emissions had increased by 24% since 1990.

Ranked as the world&#x27;s eighth largest emitter of greenhouse gases, Canada is a relatively large emitter given its population and is missing its Kyoto targets. A major Canadian initiative called the Integrated Network (ICO2N) promotes the development of large scale capture, transport and storage of carbon dioxide (CO2) as a means of helping Canada to help meet climate change objectives while supporting economic growth. ICO2N members represent a group of industry participants, many oil sands producers, providing a framework for carbon capture and storage development in Canada.

Two separate fraud lawsuits were filed against &quot;ExxonMobil involving Alberta&#x27;s oilsands&quot; in October. One was in New York and the second was filed in Massachusetts on October 24. The Massachusetts lawsuit says that ExxonMobil misled investors by &quot;falsely&quot; justifying to them &quot;its riskiest long-term investments, including Canadian bitumen oilsands projects.&quot; The company did not warn investors &quot;about what climate change measures could cost its operations — especially those in the oilsands.&quot;

In December 2022, the Pathways Alliance, a consortium of six companies Canadian Natural Resources, Cenovus Energy, Imperial Oil, MEG Energy, Suncor Energy and ConocoPhillips, which together are responsible for about 95% of Canada&#x27;s oil sands production, announced that exploratory drilling would begin that winter to create underground reservoirs in northern Alberta, where carbon captured during the process of oil sands extraction would be stored. The proposal, which may take several years to gain regulatory approval, includes the construction of a pipeline to transport captured carbon from over twenty oil sands facilities to an underground storage facility near Cold Lake.

The same month, Athabasca Oil Corporation, Canada&#x27;s 10th largest oil producer, announced that it would build a carbon capture and storage facility at its Leismer oil sands well site near Conklin, Alberta in partnership with Entropy Inc., which is funding the project. Athabasca Oil said that it aims for a 30% reduction in emissions from the extraction process by 2025.

=== Animals ===

In Northern Alberta, oil development activities bring an enormous number of people into a fragile ecosystem. Historically, population figures have been very low for this region. Water is easily polluted because the water table reaches the surface in most areas of muskeg. With the ever-increasing development and extraction of resources, wildlife are recipient to both direct and indirect effects of pollution. Woodland Caribou are particularly sensitive to human activities, and as such are pushed away from their preferred habitat during the time of year when their caloric needs are greatest and food is the most scarce. Humans&#x27; effect on the Caribou is compounded by road construction and habitat fragmentation that open the area up to deer and wolves.

Wildlife living near the Athabasca River have been greatly impacted due to pollutants entering the water system. An unknown number of birds die each year. Particularly visible and hard hit are migrating birds that stop to rest at tailing ponds. There have been numerous reports of large flocks of ducks landing in tailing ponds and perishing soon after. Data has been recorded since the 1970s on the number of birds found on tailing ponds.

There has also been a large impact on the fish that live and spawn in the area. As toxins accumulate in the river due to the oil sands, bizarre mutations, tumors, and deformed fish species have begun to appear. A study commissioned by the region&#x27;s health authority found that several known toxins and carcinogens were elevated. Aboriginal communities that live around the river are becoming increasingly worried about how the animals they eat and their drinking water are being affected.

While there has been no link yet made between the oil sands and health issues, Matt Price of Environmental Defense says the connection makes common sense. Deformities in fish and high concentrations of toxic substances in animals have also been identified.

=== Tailings ponds ===

Large volumes of tailings are a byproduct of bitumen extraction from the oil sands and managing these tailings is one of the most difficult environmental challenges facing the oil sands industry. Tailings ponds are engineered dam and dyke systems that contain solvents used in the separation process as well as residual bitumen, salts and soluble organic compounds, fine silts and water. The concentrations of chemicals may be harmful to fish and oil on the surface harmful to birds. These settling basins were meant to be temporary. A major hindrance to the monitoring of oil sands produced waters has been the lack of identification of individual compounds present. By better understanding the nature of the highly complex mixture of compounds, including naphthenic acids, it may be possible to monitor rivers for leachate and also to remove toxic components. Such identification of individual acids has for many years proved to be impossible but a breakthrough in 2011 in analysis began to reveal what is in the oil sands tailings ponds. Ninety percent of the tailings water can be reused for oil extraction. By 2009 as tailing ponds continued to proliferate and volumes of fluid tailings increased, the Alberta Energy Resources Conservation Board issued Directive 074 to force oil companies to manage tailings based on new aggressive criteria. The Government of Alberta reported in 2013 that tailings ponds in the Alberta oil sands covered an area of about . The Tailings Management Framework for Mineable Oil Sands is part of Alberta&#x27;s Progressive Reclamation Strategy for the oil sands to ensure that tailings are reclaimed as quickly as possible.

Suncor invested $1.2 billion in their Tailings Reduction Operations (TROTM) method that treats mature fine tails (MFT) from tailings ponds with chemical flocculant, an anionic Polyacrylamide, commonly used in water treatment plants to improve removal of total organic content (TOC), to speed their drying into more easily reclaimable matter. Mature tailings dredged from a pond bottom in suspension were mixed with a polymer flocculant and spread over a &quot;beach&quot; with a shallow grade where the tailings would dewater and dry under ambient conditions. The dried MFT can then be reclaimed in place or moved to another location for final reclamation. Suncor hoped this would reduce the time for water reclamation from tailings to weeks rather than years, with the recovered water being recycled into the oil sands plant. Suncor claimed the mature fines tailings process would reduce the number of tailing ponds and shorten the time to reclaim a tailing pond from 40 years at present to 7–10 years, with land rehabilitation continuously following 7 to 10 years behind the mining operations. For the reporting periods from 2010 to 2012, Suncor had a lower-than-expected fines capture performance from this technology.
Syncrude used the older composite tailings (CT) technology to capture fines at its Mildred Lake project. Syncrude had a lower-than-expected fines capture performance in 2011–2012 but exceeded expectations in 2010–2011. Shell used atmospheric fines drying (AFD) technology combined &quot;fluid tailings and flocculants and deposits the mixture in a sloped area to allow the water to drain and the deposit to dry&quot; and had a lower-than-expected fines capture performance.

By 2010 Suncor had transformed their first tailings pond, Pond One, into Wapisiw Lookout, the first reclaimed settling basin in the oil sands. In 2007 the area was a 220-hectare pond of toxic effluent but several years later there was firm land planted with black spruce and trembling aspen. Wapisiw Lookout represents only one percent of tailings ponds in 2011 but Pond One was the first effluent pond in the oil sands industry in 1967 and was used until 1997. By 2011 only 65 square kilometres were cleaned up and about one square kilometre was certified by Alberta as a self-sustaining natural environment. Wapisiw Lookout has not yet been certified. Closure operations of Pond One began in 2007. The jello-like mature fine tails (MFT) were pumped and dredged out of the pond and relocated to another tailings pond for long-term storage and treatment. The MFT was then replaced with 30 million tonnes clean sand and then topsoil that had been removed from the site in the 1960s. The of topsoil over the surface, to a depth of , was placed on top of the sand in the form of hummocks and swales. It was then planted with reclamation plants.

In March 2012 an alliance of oil companies called Canada&#x27;s Oil Sands Innovation Alliance (COSIA) was launched with a mandate to share research and technology to decrease the negative environmental impact of oil sands production focusing on tailings ponds, greenhouse gases, water and land. Almost all the water used to produce crude oil using steam methods of production ends up in tailings ponds. Recent enhancements to this method include Tailings Oil Recovery (TOR) units which recover oil from the tailings, Diluent Recovery Units to recover naphtha from the froth, Inclined Plate Settlers (IPS) and disc centrifuges. These allow the extraction plants to recover well over 90% of the bitumen in the sand.

In January 2013, scientists from Queen&#x27;s University published a report analyzing lake sediments in the Athabasca region over the past fifty years. They found that levels of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) had increased as much as 23-fold since bitumen extraction began in the 1960s. Levels of carcinogenic, mutagenic, and teratogenic PAHs were substantially higher than guidelines for lake sedimentation set by the Canadian Council of Ministers of the Environment in 1999. The team discovered that the contamination spread farther than previously thought.

The Pembina Institute suggested that the huge investments by many companies in Canadian oil sands leading to increased production results in excess bitumen with no place to store it. It added that by 2022 a month&#x27;s output of waste-water could result in a toxic reservoir the size of New York City&#x27;s Central Park [].

The oil sands industry may build a series of up to thirty lakes by pumping water into old mine pits when they have finished excavation leaving toxic effluent at their bottoms and letting biological processes restore it to health. It is less expensive to fill abandoned open pit mines with water instead of dirt. In 2012 the Cumulative Environmental Management Association (CEMA) described End Pit Lakes (EPL) as

CEMA acknowledged that the &quot;main concern is the potential for EPLs to develop a legacy of toxicity and thus reduce the land use value of the oil sands region in the future.&quot; Syncrude Canada was planning the first end pit lake in 2013 with the intention of &quot;pumping fresh water over 40 vertical metres of mine effluent that it has deposited in what it calls &#x27;base mine lake.&#x27;&quot; David Schindler argued that no further end pit lakes should be approved until we &quot;have some assurance that they will eventually support a healthy ecosystem.&quot; There is to date no &quot;evidence to support their viability, or the &#x27;modelled&#x27; results suggesting that outflow from the lakes will be non-toxic.&quot;

=== Pipeline-processing pollution ===
Oil sands and especially the related projects, like the construction of a new pipeline, also have a social impact. Most of all, the local population groups would suffer from the effects of a new oil pipeline. In addition to the risk of general oil spills, there is now also the danger of gathering food due to the pollution of the fields and waters. Despite the fact that most people in those areas are not well off, the money is still used to build new projects instead of spending it on improving the quality of life there. Furthermore, adding a new pipeline to the already existing oil pipelines would increase our dependence on fossil fuels.

In July 2015, one of the largest leaks in Canada&#x27;s history spilled 5,000 cubic metres of emulsion — about 5 million litres of bitumen, sand and wastewater — from a Nexen Energy pipeline at a Long Lake oil sands facility, south of Fort McMurray. The subsidiary of China&#x27;s CNOOC Ltd. automated safety systems had not detected the pipeline fault that caused the spill to cover an area of about 16,000 square metres prior to manual inspection. Alberta Energy Regulator (AER) revealed the number of pipeline &quot;incidents&quot; in Alberta increased 15% last year, despite the regulator&#x27;s well-publicized efforts to reduce ruptures and spills.

=== Occupational health and safety ===
An explosion left one worker dead and another seriously injured at the Chinese-owned Nexen Energy facility in the Long Lake oil sands near Anzac, south of Fort McMurray The two maintenance workers involved were found near natural gas compression equipment used for a hydrocracker, which turns heavy oil into lighter crude, at the plant&#x27;s main processing facility, known as an upgrader.

== Population ==

The Athabasca oil sands are in the northeastern portion of the Canadian province of Alberta, near the city of Fort McMurray. The area is only sparsely populated, and in the late 1950s, it was primarily a wilderness outpost of a few hundred people whose main economic activities included fur trapping and salt mining. From a population of 37,222 in 1996, the boomtown of Fort McMurray and the surrounding region (known as the Regional Municipality of Wood Buffalo) grew to 79,810 people as of 2006, including a &quot;shadow population&quot; of 10,442 living in work camps. The community struggled to provide services and housing for migrant workers, many of them from Eastern Canada, especially Newfoundland. Fort McMurray ceased to be an incorporated city in 1995 and is now an urban service area within Wood Buffalo.

== Estimated oil reserves ==
By 2015, Venezuela accounted for 18%, Saudi Arabia for 16.1%, and Canada for 10.3% of the world&#x27;s proven oil reserves, according to NRCAN.

The Alberta government&#x27;s Energy and Utilities Board (EUB) estimated in 2007 that about of crude bitumen were economically recoverable from the three Alberta oil sands areas based on then-current technology and price projections from the 2006 market prices of $62 per barrel for benchmark West Texas Intermediate (WTI), rising to a projected $69 per barrel. This was equivalent to about 10% of the estimated of bitumen-in-place. Alberta estimated that the Athabasca deposits alone contain of surface mineable bitumen and of bitumen recoverable by in-situ methods. These estimates of Canada&#x27;s reserves were doubted when they were first published but are now largely accepted by the international oil industry. This volume placed Canadian proven reserves second in the world behind those of Saudi Arabia.

Only 3% of the initial established crude bitumen reserves have been produced since commercial production started in 1967. At rate of production projected for 2015, about , the Athabasca oil sands reserves would last over 170 years. However those production levels require an influx of workers into an area that until recently was largely uninhabited. By 2007 this need in northern Alberta drove unemployment rates in Alberta and adjacent British Columbia to the lowest levels in history. As far away as the Atlantic Provinces, where workers were leaving to work in Alberta, unemployment rates fell to levels not seen for over one hundred years.

The Venezuelan Orinoco Oil Sands site may contain more oil sands than Athabasca. However, while the Orinoco deposits are less viscous and more easily produced using conventional techniques (the Venezuelan government prefers to call them &quot;extra-heavy oil&quot;), they are too deep to access by surface mining.

== Economics ==

Despite the large reserves, the cost of extracting the oil from bituminous sands has historically made production of the oil sands unprofitable—the cost of selling the extracted crude would not cover the direct costs of recovery; labour to mine the sands and fuel to extract the crude.
In mid-2006, the National Energy Board of Canada estimated the operating cost of a new mining operation in the Athabasca oil sands to be to per barrel, while the cost of an in-situ SAGD operation (using dual horizontal wells) would be to per barrel.
This compares to operating costs for conventional oil wells which can range from less than one dollar per barrel in Iraq and Saudi Arabia to over six in the United States and Canada&#x27;s conventional oil reserves.

The capital cost of the equipment required to mine the sands and haul it to processing is a major consideration in starting production. The NEB estimates that capital costs raise the total cost of production to to per barrel for a new mining operation and to per barrel for a SAGD operation. This does not include the cost of upgrading the crude bitumen to synthetic crude oil, which makes the final costs to per barrel for a new mining operation.

Therefore, although high crude prices make the cost of production very attractive, sudden drops in price leaves producers unable to recover their capital costs—although the companies are well financed and can tolerate long periods of low prices since the capital has already been spent and they can typically cover incremental operating costs.

However, the development of commercial production is made easier by the fact that exploration costs are very low. Such costs are a major factor when assessing the economics of drilling in a traditional oil field. The location of the oil deposits in the oil sands are well known, and an estimate of recovery costs can usually be made easily. There is not another region in the world with energy deposits of comparable magnitude where it would be less likely that the installations would be confiscated by a hostile national government, or be endangered by a war or revolution.

As a result of the oil price increases since 2003, the economics of oil sands have improved dramatically. At a world price of US$50 per barrel, the NEB estimated an integrated mining operation would make a rate return of 16 to 23%, while a SAGD operation would return 16 to 27%. Prices since 2006 have risen, exceeding US$145 in mid-2008 but falling back to less than 40 US$ as a result of the worldwide financial crisis, the oil price recovered slowly and many of the planned projects (expected to exceed billion between 2006 and 2015) were stopped or scheduled. In 2012 and 2013 the oil price was high again, but the US production is increasing due to new technologies, while the gasoline demand is falling, so there is an overproduction of oil. But recovering economy can change this in a few years.

At present the area around Fort McMurray has seen the most effect from the increased activity in the oil sands. Although jobs are plentiful, housing is in short supply and expensive. People seeking work often arrive in the area without arranging accommodation, driving up the price of temporary accommodation. The area is isolated, with only a two-lane road, Alberta Highway 63, connecting it to the rest of the province, and there is pressure on the government of Alberta to improve road links as well as hospitals and other infrastructure.

Despite the best efforts of companies to move as much of the construction work as possible out of the Fort McMurray area, and even out of Alberta, the shortage of skilled workers is spreading to the rest of the province. Even without the oil sands, the Alberta economy would be very strong, but development of the oil sands has resulted in the strongest period of economic growth ever recorded by a Canadian province.

== Geopolitical importance ==
The Athabasca oil sands hold geopolitical significance.

An agreement has been signed between PetroChina and Enbridge to build a pipeline from Edmonton, Alberta, to the west coast port of Kitimat, British Columbia. If it is built, the pipeline will help export synthetic crude oil from the oil sands to China and elsewhere in the Pacific. However, in 2011, First Nations and environmental groups protested the proposed pipeline, stating that its construction and operation would be destructive to the environment. First Nations groups also claim that the development of the proposed pipeline is in violation of commitments that the Government of Canada has made through various Treaties and the UN Declaration of the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. A smaller pipeline will also be built alongside to import condensate to dilute the bitumen. Sinopec, the largest refining and chemical company in China, and China National Petroleum Corporation have bought or are planning to buy shares in major oil sands development.

On August 20, 2009, the U.S. State Department issued a presidential permit for an Alberta Clipper Pipeline that will run from Hardisty, Alberta, to Superior, Wisconsin. The pipeline will be capable of carrying up to of crude oil a day to refineries in the U.S.

== Indigenous peoples of the area ==

Indigenous peoples of the area include the Fort McKay First Nation. The oil sands themselves are located within the boundaries of Treaty 8, signed in 1899, which states:

The Fort McKay First Nation has formed several companies to service the oil sands industry and will be developing a mine on their territory.
Opposition remaining within the First Nation focuses on environmental stewardship, land rights, and health issues, like elevated cancer rates in Fort Chipewyan and deformed fish being found by commercial fishermen in Lake Athabasca.

The Alberta Cancer Board published research of the cancer rates of those living in Fort Chipewyan, Alberta, in 2009. While many companies argue that there are not enough chemicals and toxic material in the water due to the development of the oil sands, this report indicates that there is coincidentally a significantly higher rate of cancer within this community. There have been many speculations as to why there is a higher rate of cancer in this community; some of those speculations are contamination with the river and the oil sands as well as uranium mining that is currently in progress. The world&#x27;s largest production of uranium is produced in this area as well as along the Athabasca River, allowing for easy contamination of the river.

From 2010 to 2014, the Tar Sands Healing Walk, founded by Indigenous women, was held annually as a demonstration against oil extraction and the damage it caused to local communities and the environment.

== Impact of oil sands and pipeline development on Indigenous groups ==
According to some environmental activists, pipeline development poses risks to the cultural, social, and economic way of life of Canada&#x27;s Indigenous populations. Historically, some Indigenous groups have opposed pipeline development for two primary reasons: 1) the perception of inherent environmental risks associated with transporting harmful oil and gas products, and 2) failure by the federal government to properly consider and mitigate Indigenous groups&#x27; concerns regarding resource development on their lands. For instance, many Indigenous groups rely heavily on local wildlife and vegetation for their survival. Increased oil production in Canada requires greater oil transport through their traditional lands, which, to some, poses the perception of threats to the survival and traditional way of life of Indigenous groups, as well as the safety and preservation of the surrounding ecosystems. First Nations in Alberta have called particular attention to adverse health impacts related to oil sands emissions, asserting that the water quality testing for specific chemicals (heavy metals) has been insufficient.

Aside from environmental concerns, many Indigenous groups have pushed back against pipeline development due to inadequate consultation processes by the federal government. As per Section 35 of the Canadian Constitution Act Indigenous peoples in Canada are guaranteed the right to be meaningfully consulted with and accommodated when the Crown is contemplating resource development on their lands - see Duty to Consult. Through a series of Supreme Court of Canada rulings and political protests from Indigenous peoples (see Haida Nation v. British Columbia [Minister of Forests], Taku River Tlingit First Nation v British Columbia, and Tsilhqot&#x27;in Nation v British Columbia), among others, the courts have attempted to further define the Crown&#x27;s consultation responsibilities and give legal recognition to Indigenous traditional territory and rights regarding resource development.

Contrarily, oil sands development also presents many positive impacts and opportunities for Indigenous groups, particularly in Western Canada. In fact, over the past two decades, First Nations participation in the energy sector has increased dramatically, from employment and business opportunities to project approval processes and environmental evaluation. Increased Indigenous participation has been encouraged by numerous collaboration agreements with industry, typically in the form of impact benefit agreements (IBAs), which provide not only employment and business ventures, but also job training and community benefits. Enhanced participation in the energy sector has empowered many Indigenous groups to push for wider involvement by negotiating ownership stakes in proposed pipelines and bitumen storage projects. Perhaps the best example of such partnering in Alberta is the agreement between Suncor and Fort McKay and Mikisew Cree First Nations. The two First Nations acquired a 49% ownership in Suncor&#x27;s East Tank Farm Development with shares valued at about $500 million making it the largest business investment to date by a First Nation entity in Canada.

Support for resource development and desire for direct involvement is further illustrated by the First Nations&#x27; led $17-billion Eagle Spirit Energy Holding Ltd. pipeline and energy corridor between Alberta and the northern B.C. coast (with a back-up plan to site its terminal in Alaska to get around the tanker ban in B.C.). The project has secured support from 35 First Nations along the proposed route; the bands are entitled to at least 35% ownership in exchange for the land use.

== Oil sand companies ==

There are currently three large oil sands mining operations in the area run by Syncrude Canada Limited, Suncor Energy and Albian Sands owned by Shell Canada, Chevron, and Marathon Oil Corp.

Major producing or planned developments in the Athabasca Oil Sands include the following projects:

* Suncor Energy&#x27;s Steepbank and Millennium mines currently produce and its Firebag in-situ project produces .
* Syncrude&#x27;s Mildred Lake and Aurora mines currently can produce .
* Shell Canada currently operates its Muskeg River Mine producing and the Scotford Upgrader at Fort Saskatchewan, Alberta.
* Nexen&#x27;s in-situ Long Lake SAGD project is now producing .
* Total S.A.&#x27;s subsidiary Deer Creek Energy was operating a SAGD project on its Joslyn lease, producing . It intended on constructing its mine by 2010 to expand its production by , however this had not occurred by May 2014 when the company shelved the project while it reviewed the economic viability of the project.

==Court ordered sanctions==
For improper diversion of water in 2008–2009, Statoil Canada Ltd. was ordered in 2012 to pay a fine of $5000 and to allocate $185,000 for a training project (The verdict was handed down by the Provincial Court of Alberta, Criminal Division).

<text>The Worshipful Company of Drapers is one of the 111 livery companies of the City of London. It has the formal name The Master and Wardens and Brethren and Sisters of the Guild or Fraternity of the [[Virgin Mary|Blessed Mary the Virgin]] of the Mystery of Drapers of the City of London. More usually known simply as the Drapers&#x27; Company, it is one of the historic Great Twelve Livery Companies and was founded during the Middle Ages.

==History==

An informal association of drapers had organized as early as 1180, and the first (Lord) Mayor of London in 1189, Henry Fitz-Ailwin de Londonestone, was believed to have been a Draper. The guild was formally founded in 1361; it received a Royal Charter three years later. It was incorporated as a company under a Royal Charter in 1438 and was the first corporate body to be granted a coat of arms. The charter gave the company perpetual succession and a common seal. Over the centuries the original privileges granted by Royal Charter have been confirmed and amended by successive monarchs. The acting charter of today is that granted by James I in 1607, amended by four supplemental charters, most recently in 2008.

The brotherhood of drapers, a religious fraternity attached to the Church of St Mary Bethlehem in Bishopsgate, was founded in honour of the Virgin Mary by &quot;good people Drapers of Cornhill and other good men and women&quot; for the amendment of their lives. The majority of drapers lived in and around Cornhill, Candlewick Street (now Cannon Street) and Chepe (Cheapside). Possibly it was for this reason that their allegiance was transferred to St Mary-le-Bow in Cheapside and later to St Michael, Cornhill, where the company continues to worship today. Despite these changes, the drapers retain the Blessed Virgin Mary as their patron saint.

Originally, the organisation was a trade association of wool and cloth merchants. It has been one of the most powerful companies in London civic politics. Over one hundred Lord Mayors have been members of the company; the first, Henry Fitz-Ailwyn, progenitor of the Earls of Arundel, was a draper. During the Plantation of Ulster, the company held land around Moneymore and Draperstown in County Londonderry.

Amongst the royalty who have been members of the company, three had not been expected to become a monarch at the time of their admission to the company but were later crowned:
*Prince William of Orange in 1670, later King William (III &amp; II) of England, Scotland, France and Ireland
*Prince Carl of Denmark in 1896, later King Haakon VII of Norway
*Prince Albert, Duke of York, in 1919, later George VI, King of Great Britain and Ireland, Emperor of India
Other well-known members have included Prince Frederick, Duke of York and Albany (&quot;aka&quot; The Grand Old Duke of York), Sir Francis Drake, Admiral the Viscount Nelson, The Marquess of Ripon and Grinling Gibbons.

Queen Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom (who was elected to the Court of Assistants in 2017, on the occasion of the 70th anniversary of her membership of the Company), King Harald V of Norway, King Charles III, The Duchess of Gloucester, Admiral the Lord Boyce, and Lady Victoria Leatham (elected as the first female Master of the Company in 2012) are among the many distinguished recent members of the company.

Professor Morag Shiach serves as Master Draper for 2024–25.

==Present==

Today, the company operates as a charitable, ceremonial and educational institution. This has included providing the site and some of the buildings of Queen Mary University of London, the library at Bangor University, the Radcliffe Science Library and Townsend Building in Oxford, the Science Library at Cardiff University, and the site and the original nineteenth-century buildings of Bancroft&#x27;s School. It also administers three almshouses: Queen Elizabeth College Greenwich, Edmanson&#x27;s Close Tottenham and Walter&#x27;s Close Southwark. It provides the chairman and four other governors of Bancroft&#x27;s School, who display the Drapers&#x27; coat of arms and motto. It is the co-sponsor of Drapers&#x27; Academy in Harold Hill, which uses a similar logo.

It has maintained long-standing close ties with Kirkham Grammar School near Preston, Lancashire, founded in Tudor times.

The Company founded two girls&#x27; schools: in Llandaff and Denbigh, Wales, using the endowment of Welsh merchant Thomas Howell, who bequeathed a sum of money to the foundation. Both schools were independent and separate institutions but the Company still has a representative in the governing body of the former. The company also has close links with some eighteen other educational establishments, ranging from Oxbridge colleges to a primary school. It administers charitable trusts relating to relief of need, education and almshouses; it provides banqueting and catering services; and it fosters its heritage and traditions of good fellowship. The Court of Assistants is its governing body.

The Drapers&#x27; Company continues to play a role in the life of the City. Its liverymen carry out important functions in the elections of the governance of the City and its civic offices.

==Livery hall==

The Drapers&#x27; Company is based at Drapers&#x27; Hall located in Throgmorton Street, near London Wall. The company has owned the site since 1543, when it purchased the London mansion of Thomas Cromwell, of Austin Friars, from King Henry VIII. Cromwell had been attainted and executed in 1540.

The building was destroyed in the Great Fire of London and rebuilt to designs by Edward Jarman. After another fire in 1772, it was rebuilt again. This time the architect was John Gorham. Further extensive alterations were made in the 19th century. The Hall survived the Blitz during the Second World War.

The Hall includes four finely decorated main rooms used for the company&#x27;s functions. The largest room is the Livery Hall, which can accommodate up to 276 guests for dinner. These rooms are also available for hire and have often been used for film locations, including for &quot;The King&#x27;s Speech&quot;, &quot;GoldenEye&quot;, &quot;The Lost Prince&quot; and &quot;Agent Cody Banks 2: Destination London&quot;. Groups may book a guided tour of Drapers&#x27; Hall; a donation to the company&#x27;s charitable work is requested. The main rooms in the Hall are usually also open once a year as part of Open House London.

==Guild Church==
* St Michael&#x27;s Cornhill

==Collections==
The company&#x27;s archives, works of art, silver and artefacts are in the care of its archivist. The document collection has items dating to the 13th century, including charters and coats of arms, charity records and records of the company&#x27;s landholdings, including the Londonderry estates. The silver collection includes an ancient Celtic decorative collar found on the Londonderry estate and pieces of the company&#x27;s own silverware from the 16th century onwards. There is also a collection of paintings, mostly of former members. Researchers may view its collections by appointment.

<text>Grass skiing, skiing on grass, is a training method for alpine skiing and an established sport of its own. The skis used for grass skiing are short with rolling treads or wheels. These skis are attached to the skiers&#x27; boots. Depending on the skill of the grass skier, high speeds and jumps can be navigated.
Grass skiing was invented by Josef Kaiser in Germany in 1963. It was created initially as a training method for skiers before the winter season.

Originally, skis used in grass skiing were like rolling treads attached to the ski boots. Currently there are two types of skis used in grass skiing. These are the wheeled models and the tracked ones. The wheeled model can be used in various terrains and for freestyle skiing and off-piste skiing. The tracked model on the other hand is specifically designed to be used on grass slopes.

<text>A leaf blower, commonly known as a [[Centrifugal fan|blower]], is a device that propels air out of a nozzle to move debris such as leaves and grass cuttings. Leaf blowers are powered by electric or gasoline motors. Gasoline models have traditionally been two-stroke engines, but four-stroke engines were recently introduced to partially address air pollution concerns. Leaf blowers are typically self-contained handheld units, or backpack mounted units with a handheld wand. The latter is more ergonomic for prolonged use. Larger units may rest on wheels and even use a motor for propulsion. These are sometimes called &quot;walk-behind leaf blowers&quot; because they must be pushed by hand to be operated. Some units called blower vacs, can also suck in leaves and small twigs via a vacuum, and shred them into a bag.

Leaf blowers are a source of controversy due to their adverse impacts such as operator injury, including hearing loss, particulates air pollution, noise pollution, and ecological habitat destruction. Over 200 localities have restricted the use of leaf blowers and many major cities, including Washington, DC, are implementing total bans due to the negative effects to operator health, ecological destruction, pollution, and nuisances including noise. October 9, 2021, California passed an air pollution control law AB1346 phasing out small off-road engines, like those found in leaf blowers, set to take effect January 1, 2024. They can also be used to blow away thin materials such as clothes

== Environmental and occupational impact ==

Emissions from gasoline-powered grounds-keeping equipment in general are a source of air pollution and more immediately, noise pollution. In the United States, US emission standards prescribe maximum emissions from small engines. The two-stroke engines used in most leaf blowers operate by mixing gasoline with oil, and a third of this mixture is not burned, but is emitted as an aerosol exhaust. These pollutants have been linked to cancer, heart disease, and asthma. A 2011 study found that the amount of NMHC pollutants emitted by a leaf blower operated for 30 minutes is comparable to the amount emitted by a Ford F-150 pickup truck driving from Texas to Alaska.

In addition to the adverse health effects of carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, hydrocarbons, and particulates generated in the exhaust gas of the gasoline-powered engines, leaf blowers pose problems related to the dust raised by the powerful flow of air. Dust clouds caused by leaf blowers contain potentially harmful substances such as pesticides, mold, and animal fecal matter that may cause irritation, allergies, and disease.

Noise pollution is also a concern with leaf blowers, as they can emit noise levels above those required to cause hearing loss to both the operator and those nearby.

Leaf blowers also present an occupational hearing hazard to the nearly 1 million people who work in lawn service and ground-keeping. A recent study assessed the occupational noise exposure among groundskeepers at several North Carolina public universities and found noise levels from leaf blowers averaging 89 decibels (A-weighted) and maximum sound pressure levels reaching 106 dB(A), both far exceeding the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) Recommended Exposure Limit of 85 dB(A)

Leaves are ecologically beneficial, providing habitat for insects and microorganisms and nutrients for the soil. Leaving some leaves rather than removing them all can support biodiversity.

Battery-powered leaf blowers produce zero emissions, are more efficient, and are even rechargeable, making them an increasingly reliable alternative to gas power. 

=== Bans ===
Soon after the leaf blower was introduced into the U.S., its use was banned in two California cities, Carmel-by-the-Sea in 1975 and Beverly Hills in 1978, as a noise nuisance. There are currently twenty California cities that have banned leaf blowers, sometimes only within residential neighborhoods and usually targeting gasoline-powered equipment. Another 80 cities have ordinances on the books restricting either usage or noise level or both.

Washington, DC, passed a ban on gas-power leaf blowers in 2018. A law banning the sale of gas-powered lawn equipment in California will take effect in 2024.

<doc id="370543" wikidata="Q3760271" url="?curid=370543" title="Geography of Alberta">
<text>Alberta is one of the thirteen provinces and territories of Canada. Located in Western Canada, the province has an area of and is bounded to the south by the United States state of Montana along 49° north for ; to the east at 110° west by the province of Saskatchewan for ; and at 60° north the Northwest Territories for . The southern half of the province borders British Columbia along the Continental Divide of the Americas on the peaks of the Rocky Mountains, while the northern half borders British Columbia along the 120th meridian west. Along with Saskatchewan it is one of only two landlocked provinces or territories.

==Terrain==

Alberta&#x27;s landscape is marked by the impact of the Wisconsin Glaciation, about 75,000 to 11,000 years ago, when the entire future province was covered in ice. As the ice sheet receded, the landscape was changed, and large amounts of glacial till were left behind.

The southern portion consists chiefly of plains that are almost entirely treeless. As the slopes of the Rocky Mountains to the west are reached, more trees are found until in the foothills of the mountains, bodies of forest timber occur. Trees also become more numerous in the northern part of the province, until in the region north of the North Saskatchewan River continuous forests are met with again. From the southern boundary line for 2.5° north the prairie is dry, but of good soil, which grows excellent crops when irrigated. North of this region, the surface of the province is of the most fertile soil, with ordinary rainfall sufficing for agriculture. Alberta also has large oil reserves, especially in the Athabasca oil sands in the north of the province.

The appearance of the prairie section of the province is that of undulating grasslands, with rounded sloping ridges covered with shorter grasses, which serve for the support of large herds of beef cattle. The wooded portions of the terrain are dotted with clumps and belts of trees of moderate size, giving them a park-like appearance. In winter it is generally very cold, but this is occasionally reduced by a warm wind from the west, known as the Chinook.

In 1986, Agriculture Canada published a map listing the following physiographic regions to be present at least partially within Alberta:

*Canadian Shield
**Kazan Upland
**Athabasca Plain
*Interior Plains
**Northern Plains
**Saskatchewan Plains
**Northern Alberta Lowlands
**Eastern Alberta Plains
**Western Alberta Plains
**Northern Alberta Uplands
**Southern Alberta Uplands
*Cordilleran Region
**Rocky Mountain Foothills
**Rocky Mountains

==Mountains==
From a distance of about the mountains are constantly in view in clear weather. They appear as a line of snowy peaks along the western horizon. This continues for hundreds of kilometres northwestward. The Canadian Rockies are ascended by a gradual approach from the east, but are exceedingly abrupt on their transalpine slope in British Columbia. The peaks of these mountains are majestic, many of them reaching a height of more than above the sea. Among the more notable of these are:

#Mount Columbia – 
#Twin Peaks massif – 
#Mount Alberta – 
#Mount Forbes – 
#Mount Temple – 
#Mount Brazeau – 
#Snow Dome – 
#Mount Lyell – 
#Mount Kitchener – 
#Mount Hungabee – 

Historical travelling through these mountains was difficult, and alpine passes became very important. The most noted of the Alberta passes are:

* The Crowsnest Pass, near the southern boundary line, through which a branch of the Canadian Pacific Railway runs.
* The Kicking Horse Pass, through which the main line of the Canadian Pacific Railway was built; from the eastern end of this pass is the gate of Banff National Park, with the famous touristic town of Banff as its centre.
* The Yellowhead Pass, running west from the Athabasca River; this pass was discovered by John Palliser (1858), was crossed by the first tourists, William Wentworth-Fitzwilliam, Viscount Milton and Walter Butler Cheadle, in 1861, and by Sandford Fleming (1871–1872) in the Ocean to Ocean expedition;

The Caribou Mountains are not part of the Canadian Rockies, but are located in the northern Alberta, constituting an elevated plateau in the northern plains. They reach an altitude of , almost higher than the surrounding area.

While not considered mountains, the Cypress Hills, located in southern Alberta, on the Saskatchewan border, constitutes the highest point between the Rocky Mountains and Labrador. They reach a maximum elevation of , above the surrounding prairie.

==Water==
With the exception of the southern section, the province of Alberta is well watered. Rising from numerous valleys on the Alberta declivity of the Rocky Mountains between the international boundary line and 52° north are streams which unite to form the Oldman River, and farther north the Bow River. Running eastward these two rivers unite about 112° west, and flow on under the name of the South Saskatchewan River. North of 52° north many small streams unite to form the Red Deer River, which flowing southeastward joins the South Saskatchewan near 110° west. Between 52° and 53° north rises the great river, the North Saskatchewan River. It receives a southern tributary, the Battle River, which joins it about 108° west. Pursuing their courses eastward the North and South Saskatchewan rivers unite in the Saskatchewan River (, &quot;swift flowing river&quot;), which finds its way to Lake Winnipeg, and thence by way of Nelson River to Hudson Bay. It is one of the mightiest rivers of the continent.

At Mount Athabasca, there is an unusual occurrence where the water flows either to the Pacific Ocean on the western slope, the Arctic Ocean on the northeast, and Hudson Bay on the southeast.

In the northern part of the province, between 53° and 54° north, all the waters of Alberta flow toward the Arctic Ocean. Starting at Mount Athabasca, the Athabasca River runs north and empties into Lake Athabasca near 58° north. North of 56° north flows through and from the Rocky Mountains as the Peace River. After descending northeastward to within a few miles of Lake Athabasca, it is met by a stream emerging from that lake. The united river carrying down the waters of the Athabasca slope is called the Slave River, which, passing through Great Slave Lake, emerges as the great Mackenzie River, which flows into the Arctic Ocean. Alberta thus gives rise to the two great rivers, the Saskatchewan and the Mackenzie.

While a number of fresh water, or in some cases brackish, lakes each less than in extent are situated in Alberta, two of more considerable size are found. These are Lake Athabasca, in extent, of which the greater part is in Saskatchewan, and the other Lesser Slave Lake in area.

==Climate==
As Alberta extends for approximately from north to south, it is natural that the climate should vary considerably between parallels of 49° and 60° north and also between approximately 110° and 120° west. It is also further influenced by the different altitudes found in the province.

In general, Alberta&#x27;s climate is dry, due to the rain shadow effect of the Rocky Mountains and Pacific Coast Ranges to the west, and continental, due to its distance from any large body of water. The contrast between warming, dry winds descending from the Rockies and proximate cold air in Yukon, however, gives Alberta (and the adjacent Mackenzie Basin) during the winter the highest variability in monthly temperatures anywhere in the world. Exceptionally warm winter months in the province can be as warm as oceanic climates at similar latitudes – for instance Edmonton averaged in February 1977 – whereas the coldest winter months like January 1950 when Edmonton averaged are comparably cold to such Siberian localities as Aldan, Sakha.

===Southern Alberta===
Most of Southern Alberta east of the Rockies and outside of the Cypress Hills, especially Palliser&#x27;s Triangle, is a dry steppe, with most locations having an annual average precipitation of 280-430mm. Under the Köppen climate classification, most places in Southern Alberta are either semi-arid (Köppen climate classification &quot;&quot;BSk&quot;&quot;), or humid continental (Köppen climate classification &quot;Dfb&quot;) (the &quot;humid&quot; designation denotes that these climates do not meet the criteria to be semi-arid, not that they necessarily have high humidity levels). Most places in Southern Alberta that fall under the &quot;humid continental&quot; classification are close to the borderline between semi-arid and humid continental. The other climates in this area are semi-monsoonal humid continental (Koppen: &quot;Dwb&quot;) located around Calgary, or subarctic (Koppen: &quot;Dfc&quot;) located in high elevation areas and the Cypress Hills. This region has the hottest summer temperatures in Alberta and quite cold winters, though chinook winds ameliorate the cold winter temperatures temporarily when they pass over. The natural vegetation of this region is mainly dry mixed grass prairie, grading to mixed grass prairie, and then fescue prairie as precipitation increases with higher altitude and / or latitude. This area is prone to drought and farming here is not successful without significant irrigation.

===Central Alberta===
Central Alberta has a dry continental climate, with most places falling under the humid continental classification (Köppen climate classification &quot;Dfb&quot;), though some areas in the southeast of this region, close to the border with Saskatchewan around Oyen, are semi-arid (Köppen &quot;BSk&quot;). Precipitation levels here are generally higher than in Southern Alberta, though the driest areas of Alberta, around Empress, are in Central Alberta. This region generally has cooler temperatures than Southern Alberta in both summer and winter, due to the decreased amount of solar radiation received, and the lower frequency of chinooks blowing through the region. After Southern Ontario, Central Alberta is the region in Canada most likely to experience tornadoes. Most of Central Alberta is covered by aspen parkland, but the driest areas have mixedgrass and even dry mixed grass prairie, while the wetter and/or cooler areas are covered in mixed boreal forest. The wetter parts of this region, around Edmonton, have some of the most fertile land in the Canadian Prairies.

===Northern Alberta===
Northern Alberta is the coldest region of Alberta, with most places having a subarctic climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Dfc&quot;) though some areas in the south of this region, as well as much of the Peace River Country, have a humid continental climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Dfb&quot;). Winters in Northern Alberta are long, and cold, while summers are short and warm. Precipitation levels are generally lower than Central Alberta and similar to Southern Alberta, but lower evapotranspiration results in there being greater effective precipitation than Southern Alberta. Natural vegetation in Northern Alberta consists primarily of mixed and coniferous taiga, with aspen parkland in the Peace River Country. With the exception of the Peace River Country, this region is generally quite poor for agriculture.

===Rocky Mountains and Cypress Hills===
Lower elevations of the Rocky Mountains and all but the highest elevations of the Cypress Hills have a humid continental climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Dfb&quot;). These areas have snowy but mild winters due to the warming effect of chinook winds, and cool summers due to their high elevation. As altitude increases and the subalpine zone is reached, this grades into a subarctic climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Dfc&quot;), with harsher winters and even cooler summers. Above the tree line, an alpine climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;ETH&quot;) prevails. Conditions this high are even colder and very windy. Precipitation is higher in these elevated regions than elsewhere in Alberta, and this supports forests of lodgepole pine and trembling aspen mixed with fescue grasslands in the montane areas, Engelmann spruce and subalpine fir forests in the subalpine zone, and heather, sedges and mountain avens in the alpine zone above the tree lines.

<doc id="370544" wikidata="Q1779564" url="?curid=370544" title="Variegation">
<text>Variegation is the appearance of differently coloured zones in the foliage, flowers, and sometimes the stems and fruit of plants, granting a speckled, striped, or patchy appearance. The colors of the patches themselves vary from a slightly lighter shade of the natural coloration to yellow, to white, or other colors entirely such as red and pink. This is caused by varying levels and types of pigment, such as chlorophyll in leaves. Variegation can be caused by genetic mutations affecting pigment production, or by viral infections such as those resulting from mosaic viruses. Many plants are also naturally variegated, such as &quot;Goeppertia insignis&quot;. Most of these are herbaceous or climbing plants, and are most often species native to tropical rainforests. 

Many species which are normally non-variegated are known to display variegation. Their appearance is desirable to enthusiasts, and many such plants are propagated and sold as unique cultivars. However, in individuals where the variegation occurs in normally-photosynthetic cells, the lack of functioning chloroplasts can slow growth rate. Conversely, naturally-variegated plants derive benefits from their appearance, such as improved photosynthetic efficiency in low-light conditions and herbivore deterrence. 

The term is also sometimes used to refer to colour zonation in minerals and the integument of animals.

== Causes ==
=== Chimeral ===

Chimeric plants contain tissues with more than one genotype. A variegated chimera contains some tissues that produce chlorophyll and other tissues which do not. Because the variegation is due to the presence of two kinds of plant tissue, propagating the plant must be by a vegetative method of propagation that preserves both types of tissue in relation to each other. Typically, stem cuttings, bud and stem grafting, and other propagation methods that results in growth from leaf axil buds will preserve variegation. Cuttings with complete variegation may be difficult, if not impossible, to propagate. Root cuttings will not usually preserve variegation, since the new stem tissue is derived from a particular tissue type within the root.

=== Structural ===

Some variegation is caused by structural color, not pigment; the microscopic structure of the plant itself reflects light to produce varying colors. This can happen when an air layer is located just under the epidermis resulting in a white or silvery reflection. It is sometimes called blister variegation. &quot;Pilea&quot; &quot;cadierei&quot; (aluminum plant) shows this effect. Leaves of most &quot;Cyclamen&quot; species show such patterned variegation, varying between plants, but consistent within each plant. 

The presence of hairs on leaves, which may be coloured differently from the leaf itself, can also produce variable coloration. This is found in various &quot;Begonia&quot; species and their hybrids. 

Sometimes venal variegation occurs – the veins of the leaf are picked out in white or yellow. This is due to lack of green tissue above the veins. It can be seen in some aroids. The blessed milk thistle, &quot;Silybum marianum&quot;, is a plant in which another type of venal variegation occurs, but in this case it is due to a blister variegation occurring along the veins.

=== Pigmentary ===
A common cause of variegation is the masking of green pigment by other pigments, such as anthocyanins. This often extends to the whole leaf, causing it to be reddish or purplish. On some plants however, consistent zonal markings occur; such as on some clovers, bromeliads, certain &quot;Pelargonium&quot; and &quot;Oxalis&quot; species. On others, such as the commonly grown forms of Coleus, the variegation can vary widely within a population. In &quot;Nymphaea lotus&quot;, the tiger lotus, leaf variegations appear under intense illumination.

=== Pathological ===
Virus infections may cause patterning to appear on the leaf surface. The patterning is often characteristic of the infection. Examples are the &quot;mosaic viruses&quot;, which produce a mosaic-type effect on the leaf surface or the citrus variegation virus (CVV). Recently a virus disease, &quot;Hosta virus X&quot; (HVX) has been identified that causes mottled leaf coloring in hostas. At first, diseased plants were propagated and grown for their mottled foliage, at the risk of infecting other healthy hostas. While these diseases are usually serious enough that the gardener would not grow affected plants, there are a few affected plants that can survive indefinitely, and are attractive enough to be grown for ornament; e.g. some variegated Abutilon varieties. Nutrient deficiency symptoms may cause a temporary or variable yellowing in specific zones on the leaf. Iron and magnesium deficiencies are common causes of this. Transposable elements can cause colour variegation.

=== Defensive masquerade ===
It has been suggested that some patterns of leaf variegation may be part of a &quot;defensive masquerade strategy.&quot; In this, leaf variegation may appear to a leaf mining insect that the leaf is already infested, and this may reduce parasitization of the leaf by leaf miners.

== Nomenclature ==
By convention, the italicised term &quot;&#x27;variegata&quot;&#x27; as the second part of the Latin binomial name, indicates a species found in the wild with variegation (&quot;Aloe variegata&quot;). The much more common, non-italicised, inclusion of &#x27;Variegata&#x27; as the third element of a name indicates a variegated cultivar of an unvariegated parent (&quot;Aucuba japonica&quot; &#x27;Variegata&#x27;). However, not all variegated plants have this Latin tag, for instance many cultivars of &quot;Pelargonium&quot; have some zonal variegation in their leaves. Other types of variegation may be indicated, e.g. &quot;Daphne odora&quot; &#x27;Aureomarginata&#x27; has yellow edging on its leaves.

== Usage ==
Variegated plants have long been valued by gardeners, as the usually lighter-coloured variegation can &#x27;lift&#x27; what would otherwise be blocks of solid green foliage. Many gardening societies have specialist variegated plants groups, such as the Hardy Plant Society&#x27;s Variegated Plant Special Interest Group in the UK.

In 2020, a variegated &quot;Rhaphidophora tetrasperma&quot; plant sold at auction for US$5,300. In June 2021, another variegated &quot;Rhaphidophora tetrasperma&quot; plant sold at auction for US$19,297.

<text>The Worshipful Company of Fishmongers (or Fishmongers&#x27; Company) is one of the 111 livery companies of the City of London, being an incorporated guild of sellers of fish and seafood in the City. The Company ranks fourth in the order of precedence of City Livery Companies, thereby making it one of the Great Twelve City Livery Companies.

==History==
The Company records an unbroken existence for 750 years, forming as City fishmongers began to collaborate for mutual benefit, developing into a guild which managed London&#x27;s fish trade according to their defined set of rules and regulation. The earliest evidence of such a group dates back to 1154, when a number of London fishmongers were fined for trading without Royal Warrant with the Company receiving its first Royal Charter from Edward I in 1272.

The Company&#x27;s regulation of the fish trade were formalised by the 1272 Royal Charter which &quot;secured approval of their ordinances&quot; and was further reinforced by the 1383 Charter from King Edward III which stipulated that &quot;anyone wishing to sell fish were required to lodge with a Fishmonger during their stay in the City&quot;. Although Lord Mayor John Comberton de Northampton (a Draper) persuaded the City Common Council  to declare that the Fishmongers should no longer have the power to monopolise trade in fish, and this was reaffirmed by Parliament, a Royal Charter granted by Richard II in 1399 restored all privileges. The same Charter states they should elect six Wardens annually, the number which continues to the present day.

The most famous City fishmonger is Sir William Walworth, who, as Lord Mayor of London in 1381, helped bring the Peasants&#x27; Revolt to an end by stabbing the rebel Wat Tyler at Smithfield in the presence of King Richard II.

In the early 17th century, the Company was granted lands at Ballykelly and Banagher in modern-day Northern Ireland, by the Crown. It remained a major landowner there until the 20th century, and the villages contain some of the most interesting buildings erected in Ulster by the Plantation companies.

In 1714, the Irish actor Thomas Doggett provided money to endow a boat race called Doggett&#x27;s Coat and Badge Race in honour of the new king, George I of Hanover. The race was originally to be rowed annually on 1 August on the River Thames, by up to six young watermen per boat who were not to be out of their apprenticeship by more than twelve months. The prize for the champion oarsman is a fine red coat embellished with a large silver badge on one arm, depicting the White Horse of Hanover with the word &#x27;liberty&#x27; underneath. Since Doggett&#x27;s death, the Fishmongers&#x27; Company continues to organise this event each year, and it is now believed to be the world&#x27;s longest continuously-running sporting event as well as being the longest boat race in the world – 4 miles, 5 furlongs (7,400 m).

==Functions==
The Company is governed by its Prime Warden, five other Wardens and its Court of Assistants, comprising 28 appointed Livery members. The Company comprises about 700 members, including a good representation of from the seafood trade, UK fisheries and marine and freshwater conservation. Liverymen of all City companies are members of Common Hall which entitles them to vote each year in the election of the Lord Mayor of the City of London.

The Company&#x27;s Fisheries Charitable Trust maintains its link with its namesake trade, working to &quot;build and safeguard a prosperous and sustainable fishing industry, for the benefit of those engaged in it, the environment and our island nation&quot;. Supporting a range of projects across UK fisheries, the Trust works with universities, government and third sector organisations to support, through charitable giving, a sustainable fishing industry, healthy rivers and oceans and thriving coastal communities.

The Company&#x27;s Charitable Trust responds to a range of social issues, focusing on mental health, food and nutrition and education in prisons. It has also long supported the City and Guilds of London Art School and the City and Guilds of London Institute.

==Hall ==

The Company&#x27;s livery hall in the City of London is known as Fishmongers&#x27; Hall (sometimes shortened in common parlance to Fish Hall); its earliest recorded hall was built in 1310. A new hall, on the present site, was bequeathed to the Company in 1434. Together with 43 other Livery halls, this one was destroyed in the Great Fire of London in 1666 and a replacement hall designed by the architect Edward Jerman opened in 1671. This hall by Jerman was demolished to facilitate the construction of the new London Bridge in 1827. The Fishmongers&#x27; next hall was designed by Henry Roberts (although his assistant, later the celebrated Sir Gilbert Scott, made the drawings) and built by William Cubitt &amp; Company, opening in 1827. After severe bomb damage during the Blitz, Fishmongers&#x27; Hall was restored by Austen Hall (of Whinney, Son &amp; Austen Hall) and reopened in 1951.

==Gresham&#x27;s School==
Since 1555, the Company has acted as the Trustee of Gresham&#x27;s School in Holt, Norfolk, in accordance with the wishes of Lord Mayor Sir John Gresham (1492–1556), who endowed the school to the Company upon his death. Among other responsibilities, the Company now focuses on providing &quot;life changing&quot; bursaries for students.

<text>HMS &quot;Warrior&quot; was a armoured cruiser built for the Royal Navy in the first decade of the 20th century. She was stationed in the Mediterranean when the First World War began and participated in the pursuit of the German battlecruiser and light cruiser . &quot;Warrior&quot; was transferred to the Grand Fleet in December 1914 and remained there for the rest of her career. She was heavily damaged during the Battle of Jutland in 1916, after which she withdrew and was later abandoned and sank in a rising sea.

==Description==

&quot;Warrior&quot; displaced as built and fully loaded. The ship had an overall length of , a beam of and a draught of . She was powered by four-cylinder triple-expansion steam engines, driving two shafts, which developed a total of and gave a maximum speed of . The engines were powered by 19 Yarrow water-tube boilers and six cylindrical boilerss. The ship carried a maximum of of coal and an additional of fuel oil that was sprayed on the coal to increase its burn rate. At full capacity, she could steam for at a speed of .

===Armament===
Her main armament consisted of six BL 9.2-inch Mk X guns in single Mk V turrets; two on the centreline (one each fore and aft) and four in the corners about the funnels. Her secondary armament of four BL 7.5-inch Mk II or Mk V guns in single Mk II turrets was carried amidships, between the wing 9.2-inch guns. Twenty-six Vickers QF 3-pounders were fitted, ten on turret roofs and eight each on the forward and aft superstructures. The last four ships of the cruisers had a secondary armament of turreted 7.5-inch guns rather than the guns in casemates of the first two ships; these latter four were sometimes referred to as the &quot;Warrior&quot; class. Because of the extra topweight of the turrets in comparison to their half-sisters their stability was reduced which made them very good seaboats and steady gun platforms. The ship also mounted three submerged 17.7-inch (450 mm) torpedo tubes, one of which was mounted in the stern.

==Service==
&quot;Warrior&quot; was ordered as part of the 1903–04 naval construction programme as the first of four armoured cruisers and laid down on 5 November 1903 at Pembroke Dockyard. Her eponym, the once-innovative armoured frigate (at the time converted to a depot ship) , was renamed to HMS &quot;Vernon III&quot; in 1904 to free up the name. She was launched on 25 November 1905 and completed on 12 December 1906. On completion, &quot;Warrior&quot; was assigned to the 5th Cruiser Squadron in the Channel Fleet until 1909, when she was transferred to the 2nd Cruiser Squadron. On 15 September 1909 one of &quot;Warrior&quot;″s boiler tubes failed during firing practice, and she was repaired at Devonport Dockyard. In 1913 the ship was transferred to the 1st Cruiser Squadron of the Mediterranean Fleet. She was involved in the pursuit of the German battlecruiser &quot;Goeben&quot; and light cruiser &quot;Breslau&quot; at the outbreak of World War I, but was ordered not to engage them. &quot;Warrior&quot; participated in the Allied sweep which led to the sinking of the Austro-Hungarian light cruiser during the Battle of Antivari in August 1914. A few days later she was ordered to Suez to defend the Suez Canal against any Turkish attack and remained there until 6 November when she was ordered to Gibraltar to join a squadron of French and British ship to search for German warships still at sea off the African coast. This was cancelled on 19 November after the location of the German East Asia Squadron was revealed by survivors of the Battle of Coronel.

&quot;Warrior&quot; joined the Grand Fleet in December 1914 and was assigned to the 1st Cruiser Squadron under Rear-Admiral Sir Robert Keith Arbuthnot. At the Battle of Jutland on 31 May 1916, the 1st Cruiser Squadron was in front of the Grand Fleet, on the right side. At 5:47 p.m., the squadron flagship, , and &quot;Warrior&quot; spotted the German II Scouting Group and opened fire. Their shells felt short and the two ships turned to port in pursuit, cutting in front of the battlecruiser , which was forced to turn away to avoid a collision. Shortly afterwards they spotted the disabled German light cruiser and closed to engage. When the two ships reached a range of from &quot;Wiesbaden&quot; they were spotted in turn at 6:05 by the German battlecruiser and four battleships who were less than away. The fire from the German ships was heavy and &quot;Defence&quot; blew up at 6:20. &quot;Warrior&quot; was hit by at least fifteen and six shells, but was saved when the German ships switched their fire to the battleship when its steering jammed and caused &quot;Warspite&quot; to make two complete circles within sight of much of the High Seas Fleet.

&quot;Warrior&quot; was heavily damaged by the German shells, which caused large fires and heavy flooding, although the engine room crew - of whom only three survived - kept the engines running for long enough to allow her to withdraw to the west. She was taken in tow by the seaplane tender who took off her surviving crew of 743. She was abandoned in a rising sea at 8:25 a.m. on 1 June when her upper deck was only 4 feet (1.2 m) above the water, and subsequently foundered.

==Wreck Discovery==
On 8 September 2016 Dr Innes McCartney of Bournemouth University announced that he and a team from the Sea War Museum Jutland had discovered the wreck of the &quot;Warrior&quot;. The wreck was discovered in a search on 24 August 2016. The ship lies completely upside down, at a depth of 80 meters in an area of soft sea bed, up to the level of the upper deck. The ship appears to be largely intact, with no sign of the illegal metal salvage that has occurred on other Jutland wrecks. &quot;Warrior&quot; is the last of the 25 ships sunk at the Battle of Jutland to be located. There are concerns that the wreck may be exploited by illegal metal scavengers, despite the wreck being protected by the Protection of Military Remains Act 1986.

<doc id="370588" wikidata="Q1191501" url="?curid=370588" title="Politics of Alberta">
<text>The politics of [[Alberta]] are centred on a provincial government resembling that of the other Canadian provinces, namely a constitutional monarchy and parliamentary democracy. The capital of the province is Edmonton, where the provincial Legislative Building is located.

The unicameral legislature, the Alberta Legislature, is composed of the Lieutenant Governor and the Legislative Assembly, which has 87 members. Government is conducted after the Westminster model. The provincial government&#x27;s revenue, although it is often described as predominantly coming from the province&#x27;s resource base, actually is derived from a variety of sources. Nonrenewable resource revenue provided the government with 24 percent of its revenue in 2010–11, with about the same coming from individual income tax, 14 per cent from grants from the federal government, and about eight percent coming from both corporations and the government&#x27;s own business activities. Alberta is the only province in Canada without a provincial sales tax (see also Sales taxes in Canada).

Alberta has a single-tier system of municipal government similar to that of most of the other provinces.

== Lieutenant governor ==
, of Canada, is also the sovereign for Alberta&#x27;s provincial jurisdiction. Within Canada, the monarch exercises power individually on behalf of the federal government, and the 10 provinces. The powers of the Crown are vested in the monarch and are exercised by the lieutenant governor.

While the advice of the premier and Executive Council is typically binding on the lieutenant governor, there are occasions when the lieutenant governor has refused advice. This usually occurs if the premier does not clearly command the confidence of the elected Legislative Assembly, or if the advice or legislation would be unconstitutional.

In 2022, Lieutenant Governor Salma Lakhani identified the constitutional role of the lieutenant governor as the most important part of the job. She stated &quot;We are a constitutional monarchy, and this is where we do checks and balances. I’m what I would call a ‘constitutional fire extinguisher.’ We don&#x27;t have to use it a lot, but sometimes we do have to use it,&quot; in response to a proposed &quot;Alberta Sovereignty Act&quot; if it was determined to be unconstitutional. The proposed law would give the province the ability to ignore federal legislation it does not agree with.

== Legislative power ==

The Legislative Assembly of Alberta is the deliberative assembly of the Alberta Legislature for the province of Alberta, Canada, and is seated at the Alberta Legislature Building in the provincial capital of Edmonton. The Legislative Assembly is a unicameral assembly of 87 members, elected first past the post from single-member electoral districts. Bills passed by the legislature are given Royal Assent by Charles III, King of Canada, represented by the Lieutenant-Governor of Alberta. The current Legislature is the 30th, since Alberta entered Confederation under the &quot;Alberta Act&quot; in 1905, and is composed of members elected in the April 16, 2019 general election, and returned a majority parliament controlled by the United Conservative Party commonly abbreviated to &#x27;UCP&#x27;.

== Executive power ==

The day-to-day operation and activities of the Government of Alberta are performed by the provincial departments and agencies, staffed by the non-partisan public service, and directed by the elected government.

The premier of Alberta is the primary minister of the Crown. The premier acts as the head of government for the province, chairs and selects the membership of the Cabinet, and advises the Crown on the exercise of executive power and much of the royal prerogative.

==History of Alberta politics==
===Provincial===
Alberta&#x27;s parliamentary governments are determined by general elections held every three to five years. Five years is the maximum term allowed. By-elections are conducted between the general elections to fill seats left vacant by death or resignation. In each election (so far) a single party has taken a majority of the seats, although sometimes it does this after receiving less than half the votes cast.

Alberta&#x27;s politics has historically been one of long-lasting governments with government changes being few and far between.

For the first 16 years Alberta was a province it had a Liberal government. Through the 1910s the growing farmer movement forced reforms out of this government and, embodied in the United Farmers of Alberta group, it launched itself into direct politics, winning power in the first election it contested.

Louise McKinney and Roberta MacAdams were the first women elected to the Legislative Assembly, in the 1917 election. They were also the first women in any legislature of the British Empire. Irene Parlby was the first woman appointed to the provincial Cabinet, in 1921.

Alberta was swept up in the wave of &quot;prairie populism&quot; that took place after the First World War; from 1921 to 1935 the United Farmers of Alberta headed the longest-lived of the farmers&#x27; governments that won power in Canada during this time. It made several reforms including changing Alberta&#x27;s election system. Ranked voting was brought in --Single transferable voting proportional representation in the cities and Instant-runoff voting outside the cities. The UFA lost all its seats in 1935 when William Aberhart&#x27;s Social Credit party (Socred) was elected on a radical monetary reform platform. After Aberhart&#x27;s death in 1943 and changing economic conditions, the Socred government moved to the right under Premier Ernest Manning.

For over 80 years, the province was governed by right of centre parties. The Socreds were succeeded in 1971 by the Progressive Conservatives. Ralph Klein was premier of Alberta from 1992 to 2006 and despite multiple controversies, he remained the leader of the Progressive Conservative party and thus the province although only 55 percent of delegates from his party signified their approval of his leadership on the spring of 2006, pushing him into retirement. In the previous election (2004) Klein&#x27;s PC party had taken less than half the votes cast in the province but had won 75 percent of the seats.

Left wing Edmonton was an exception to the province&#x27;s post–Second World War conservative voting pattern, earning it the nickname &quot;Redmonton&quot;. Edmonton city residents, to a larger extent than elsewhere, tend to vote for the Liberal Party of Alberta and Alberta New Democrats. Their preferences is often obscured by the first-past-the-post electoral system. No Labour or CCF or NDP candidate won an Edmonton seat from 1955 to 1982, despite the large left vote in the city overall, in part due to the cancellation of the STV/IRV voting systems in 1956. The 2004 provincial election was an example of how the city got its nickname &quot;Redmonton&quot;; Liberal and New Democrat candidates won 15 of the city&#x27;s 18 seats.

While Tories won 13 of Edmonton&#x27;s 18 seats in 2008, Klein&#x27;s successor, Ed Stelmach, represented a riding just outside Edmonton and was perceived to be less connected to the interests of the energy corporations whose headquarters are in Calgary.

Stelmach gave way in 2011 to Alison Redford, the province&#x27;s first female premier. She led the Tories to a 12th consecutive election victory in 2012. Redford was forced to resign in 2014, and was ultimately succeeded by former federal minister Jim Prentice.

The period of conservative dominance in Alberta politics was broken in 2015 when the Alberta New Democratic Party formed government for the first time, and Rachel Notley became Alberta&#x27;s 17th premier. The NDP won 54 of Alberta&#x27;s 87 seats.

The 2019 general election saw Jason Kenney and his new United Conservative Party (a merger of the Progressive Conservative and Wildrose parties) sweep to power. The UCP won 63 of 87 seats in the Alberta legislature, returning the province to conservative politics. This was the only election in Alberta history to dethrone an incumbent government after only a single term. However, the UCP received just 54 percent of the vote, the first-past-the-post system inflating the avalanche of switched seats and exaggerating the appearance of the party&#x27;s popularity. In the 2023 general election, the UCP won another majority but by smaller margins - UCP 49 seats, NDP 38 seats; UCP 53 percent of votes, NDP 44 percent of votes cast overall.

===Federal===
When first MPs were elected in what is present-day Alberta in 1880s/1890s, Calgary and southern Alberta generally elected Conservatives, such as Donald Watson Davis and north-central Alberta elected Liberals such as Frank Oliver.

After province-hood, Alberta&#x27;s federal representation mostly echoed that of its provincial government. Like provincial elections, federal elections again and again saw the leading party (no matter what its label) receive more than its due share of members and the other parties were under-represented.

When Liberals were in power in the Legislative Assembly, most of the province&#x27;s MPs were Liberal. The 1917 election was an exception - The Union government&#x27;s use of the soldier vote meant that Liberal candidates with majority support among voters voting in the riding were not declared elected.

Then when the United Farmers dominated from 1921 to 1935, most of the Alberta MPs were of that party. Calgary was a labour stronghold, and its election of two Labour MPs in 1921 was un-equalled anywhere else in the country.

When Social Credit came into vogue, winning its first electoral successes in 1935, federal representation also changed to being mostly Socred. The Social Credit party under Ernest Manning turned right-wing in the 1940s, but this apparently mirrored changing sentiment among Alberta voters. And the party maintained its power provincially and its hold on most of the federal seats until the 1970s.

Alberta&#x27;s conservative leaning was pronounced on the federal level. The province was the heartland of the Reform Party of Canada and its successor, the Canadian Alliance. These parties were the second-largest political parties in the federal Parliament from 1997 to 2003 and they were located on the political right.

The Canadian Alliance merged with the Progressive Conservative Party to form today&#x27;s Conservative Party of Canada. The Conservatives&#x27; former leader and ex–Prime Minister Stephen Harper, moved to Alberta in the 1980s and represented a Calgary riding; Rona Ambrose, the party&#x27;s interim leader and Leader of the Opposition (2015–17), is also an Albertan.

Alberta elected no Liberal MP 1958–1963, 1965–1968, 1972–1993, 2006–2015, 2019 to 2021. In 2021 it elected one in Edmonton and one in Calgary. In 2021 it received 15.5 percent of the Alberta votes so was proportionally due five seats in that province. In those years when Alberta had no Liberal MPs, Liberals were in power 1965–1968, 1972–1979, 1980–1984, 1993 to 2006 and 2019 to the present. In almost all of those five periods, for a total of 31 years, Alberta did not have direct representation in the federal cabinet. This included the years when PM Pierre Trudeau tried to create a National Energy Program. It failed. To this day, Canada is one of only a few major countries without a national energy plan.

The CCF never did elect an MP in Alberta. But under its later label, the New Democratic Party, the left has achieved more successes in Alberta, electing an MP in 1988 and one in Edmonton-Strathcona every time since 2008. In 2021 an additional NDP MP was elected in Edmonton Griesbach. The party received almost a fifth of the Alberta vote in 2021 and proportionally was due six seats.

Rural Alberta ridings typically give the leading party, whether it is the Conservatives, or the United Farmers, Social Credit, Reform and the Alliance before them, some of the highest margins in the country; in many cases, the successful candidate receives more than two-thirds of the vote.

===Provincial political culture===
Alberta&#x27;s political stability has led to a series of political continuity. Voters have turned a government out of office only five times in 115 years. The two governments prior to 2015 were among the longest-lived in the Commonwealth.

Sine the end of STV/IRV in 1956, Alberta elections have used the first-past-the-post voting system so MLAs elected do not necessarily receive a majority of the votes in the constituency, and the party with a majority of the seats in the Legislature does not necessarily receive a majority of votes cast in the election. For example, in the 2004 election, the Progressive Conservative party won 61 of 83 seats (73% of the seats) but obtained only 47% of the popular vote.

During the UFA and early Socred government periods, elections were conducted using transferable preferential ballots (see ranked voting). Members in cities ran in city-wide districts, under the single transferable voting system ensuring city-wide proportional representation in the Legislature; members outside the cities were elected using Instant-runoff voting. In the cities, under STV, balanced representation was elected, while IRV, used elsewhere, produced the same disproportional results that were produced before 1924 and after 1956 by first past the post. No Labour, CCF or NDP members were elected in Edmonton prior to 1982 except in elections where STV was used. Many of the opposition parties today include electoral reform in their policies.

In its history, Alberta has seen only six distinct governments, with no party ever returning to form government under the same label again after defeat. (The UFA government of 1921-1935 can be seen as a precursor of the NDP government of 2015–2019 as it organizationally was its forerunner. The present UCP government is an organizational descendant of the old Progressive-Conservative Party that reigned from 1971 to 2015.)
All Alberta elections have resulted in a majority government, a trend unseen in any other Canadian province. (But frequently the most popular party was the choice of less than half the voters.) Even with crossing the floor or by-elections, Alberta has never had a minority government. Each government has held a majority of seats in the Legislature.

===Liberal to UFA to Social Credit (1905-1971)===
===Progressive Conservative to NDP to UCP (1971 to present)===
Some Albertans continue to resent the imposition in the 1980s of the National Energy Program (NEP) by the Liberal federal government of Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau. It was considered to be an intrusion by the federal government in an area of provincial responsibility. This led some Albertans to advocate separation of the province from Canada but this advocacy (despite occasional surges in interest) has never resulted in electoral success. Neither, however, has the Liberal Party of Canada enjoyed much success in Alberta (outside of Edmonton) since that time. The NEP was ended when the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada, led by Brian Mulroney, formed the federal government following the 1984 federal election.

In the 2006 election, the federal Conservative Party of Canada won all the seats in Alberta, providing them with a complete sweep of the province. However, the NDP won the seat of Edmonton—Strathcona in the election of 2008, denying the Conservatives a sweep of the province in this election. No Alberta seats changed parties in the 2011 election, in which the Conservatives went from a minority government to a parliamentary majority. In all three elections, many of the Conservative candidates were elected with large majorities of the vote. Alberta has for decades been considered a conservative fortress, no matter which right-of-centre party they may have chosen to support. Albertans followed strong support for the Progressive Conservatives in the 1980s with the same degree of support for the Reform Party, and the Canadian Alliance in the 1990s, finally delivering a clean sweep for the new Conservative Party of Canada only a few years after its creation in 2003–2004.

However, small disaffection with the Conservative Party of Canada over policies enacted during its minority government such as Equalization payments in Canada and the Conservatives&#x27; reversal on income trusts led to the founding of the nascent federal Party of Alberta, in 2006. Provincially, while the Progressive Conservative Party of Alberta had been in power for 40 years, they continued to win large majorities in the Legislative Assembly, winning 72 out of 83 seats in the March 2008 provincial election, although with declining popularity and lowering voter turn-out, reflecting increasing disfavour among ordinary Albertans regarding the government&#x27;s market-first policies, its low quality of health and education services, and its flat-income tax policy. 
As well, for the first time since the 1980s, the PCs faced a challenge from the right wing, the upstart Wildrose Alliance Party. A November 2009 poll said the new party had 28% support, just 6 points behind the governing PCs. In polls, the Wildrose Party had a double digit lead over the PCs in December 2009, with 39% versus 25% each for the PCs and Alberta Liberals.

In April 2015, Jim Prentice called an election for May 5, citing the need for a mandate in order to make longer-term economic changes. Though initial polls had the PCs in the lead, as the election approached they fell behind the opposition Wildrose party, and the NDP. On May 5 the NDP gained 53 seats, winning a majority government under Rachel Notley.

The United Conservative Party (UCP) was established in July 2017 as a merger between the Progressive Conservative Association of Alberta and the Wildrose Party. When established, the UCP immediately formed the Official Opposition in the Legislative Assembly of Alberta. The UCP won a majority mandate in the 2019 Alberta general election to form the government of Alberta. In the 2023 election they lost several seats but maintained a majority in the Legislative Assembly.

<text>The Worshipful Company of Goldsmiths (commonly known as The Goldsmiths&#x27; Company and formally styled The Wardens and Commonalty of the Mystery of Goldsmiths of the City of London), is one of the Great Twelve Livery Companies of the City of London, headquartered at Goldsmiths&#x27; Hall, London EC2.

The company, which originates from twelfth-century London, received a Royal Charter in 1327 and ranks fifth in precedence of the City Livery Companies. &lt;br&gt;Its motto is &quot;Justitia Virtutum Regina&quot;, Latin for &quot;Justice is Queen of Virtues&quot;.

==History==

Established as a medieval guild for the goldsmith trade, the term &quot;hallmarking&quot; derives from precious metals being officially inspected and marked at Goldsmiths&#x27; Hall in the City of London.
In 1812, twenty almshouses were built on the former Perryn estate in Acton, on land bequeathed to the company by John Perryn in 1657.

In 1891, the Goldsmiths&#x27; Company founded the Goldsmiths&#x27; Technical and Recreative Institute, becoming Goldsmiths&#x27; College then Goldsmiths, University of London.

One of the few Livery Companies today playing a formal role in its ancient trade, it oversees the Goldsmiths&#x27; Company Assay Office, where objects made of precious metals are tested for purity, and then marked with an official symbol should they pass the necessary tests. At the Trial of the Pyx, the Goldsmiths&#x27; Company is also responsible for checking the validity of British coinage.

The Goldsmiths&#x27; Company also maintains a library and archive for those wishing to research goldsmithing, silversmithing and hallmarking.

===Goldsmiths&#x27; Centre===

In 2012 the Goldsmiths’ Centre, a space for workshops, exhibitions and events, and education including apprentice training, opened in Clerkenwell.

===Current activities===
In July 2017, the Goldsmiths&#x27; Company announced it was to become a founding partner of the new Museum of London, donating £10 million to the new site. It also announced a contribution of £250,000 to Westminster Abbey for the Queen&#x27;s Diamond Jubilee Galleries, which opened in 2018.

The Goldsmiths’ Company supports two large educational initiatives, providing funding for a science initiative in primary schools created by Imperial College London and the National Theatre’s programme of streamed recordings for primary schools.

<doc id="370599" wikidata="Q5193518" url="?curid=370599" title="Culture of Alberta">
<text>The culture of Alberta refers to the art, customs, and traditions of the people of Alberta. Alberta entered into Confederation in 1905, placing her in a tie with Saskatchewan as the country&#x27;s second youngest province. Despite her short history, the province possesses a rich culture. The vastness of the land and variation of geography – which includes mountains, foothills, grassland, parkland, forest, and rockland – have served as important sources of creative inspiration across all art forms. Alberta&#x27;s primary industries of farming, ranching, and petroleum also play a major part in the province&#x27;s culture and identity.

== Arts ==

=== Architecture ===

Few structures in Alberta predate the province&#x27;s founding in 1905. During the province&#x27;s early years, many significant projects were designed by eastern firms including those of Ross and MacDonald, E. and W. S. Maxwell, Edward Colonna, John M. Lyle, Brown and Vallance, Burke Horwood and White, and Percy Erskine Nobbs.

For much of the 20th century, the Alberta landscape was dotted with wooden, gable-roofed grain elevators. Authors have referred to prairie elevators as &quot;prairie sentinels&quot; or &quot;prairie cathedrals.&quot; These structures existed in most towns and hamlets and became symbols of the Canadian prairies. Alberta&#x27;s first grain elevator was erected in Strathcona in 1895 by the Brackman-Ker Milling Co. Elevators, which had painted on their sides the names of towns, served as landmarks for rail and car travelers, as well as for BCATP pilots during World War II. In his 1923 book &quot;Vers une architecture&quot;, French architect Le Corbusier featured a photograph of the concrete Dominion Government Elevator in Calgary, which was demolished in 2011. By 1951 there were 1,651 elevators in the province. However, in the 1960s the traditional grain transportation system began to disappear, and by 2005 only 156 wooden elevators remained. Several, such as those at Andrew, Castor, Leduc, Meeting Creek, Paradise Valley, Radway, Rowley, Scandia and St. Albert have been designated historical sites.

Alberta is home to six grand hotels built by railway companies; some of these are built in the château style, a uniquely Canadian aesthetic. The hotels are the Palliser Hotel, Hotel Macdonald, Banff Springs Hotel, Château Lake Louise, Jasper Park Lodge, and Prince of Wales Hotel. All six remain prominent tourist destinations. Alberta was also home to one of only two buildings in Canada designed by Frank Lloyd Wright: the Banff National Park Pavilion (built 1913-14). The building was, however, destroyed by flood in 1938. In recent years the Town of Banff has made several proposals to reconstruct the building, albeit in a new location, however, none have come to fruition.

Following World War II, Albertan architects embraced the International Style. The firm of Rule Wynn and Rule was founded in Edmonton in 1938 by three University of Alberta graduates, and in 1945 opened a second office in Calgary. Throughout the 1950s and 1960s RWR dominated the province&#x27;s architectural scene, producing numerous notable commercial and residential structures. In the late 1960s a new generation emerged and sought to develop a uniquely Albertan style of architecture that responded to the province&#x27;s landscape and culture. These individuals included Douglas Cardinal (1934-), Peter Hemingway (1929-1995), Gordon Atkins (1937-), Jack Long (1925-2001), Donald G. Bittorf (1926-2008), and William E. Boucock. Of this group, Douglas Cardinal became the most famous, going on to gain worldwide recognition for his work.

Perhaps the two most recognizable buildings in Calgary&#x27;s skyline are the Calgary Tower (William G. Milne, 1968) and the Olympic Saddledome (Graham McCourt, 1983). Edmonton&#x27;s most recognizable buildings are arguably the Alberta Legislature Building (Allan Merrick Jeffers and Richard Blakey, 1907) and Muttart Conservatory (Peter Hemingway, 1976).

=== Dance ===
Alberta is home to Canada&#x27;s third largest ballet company, the Alberta Ballet Company. The company was founded in 1958 by Ruth Carse (1916–1999) as Dance Interlude. Carse had been a ballerina with the Canadian Ballet, National Ballet of Canada, and Radio City Music Hall before injury forced her into retirement in 1954. In 1960 it changed its name to the Edmonton Ballet Company, and in 1966 to the Alberta Ballet Company. Since Carse&#x27;s retirement in 1975, subsequent directors have included Jeremy Leslie-Spinks, Brydon Paige, Ali Pourfarrokh, Mikko Nissinen, and Jean Grand-Maître. In 1990 the company merged with the Calgary City Ballet and relocated to Calgary. It is currently based in St. Mary&#x27;s Parish Hall.

=== Film ===
During the Golden Age of Hollywood, Alberta was the setting of many films in the Northern genre. Some of these were filmed on location while others were shot in the United States. Examples include &quot;Canadian Pacific&quot;, &quot;Saskatchewan&quot;, &quot;Northwest Stampede&quot;, &quot;Blue Canadian Rockies&quot;, and &quot;The Wild North&quot;. Although it takes places in the United States, the 1954 film &quot;River of No Return&quot;, starring Marilyn Monroe, was filmed in Banff. The 1941 British war film &quot;49th Parallel&quot; includes a lengthy sequence shot in Banff National Park. &quot;Campbell&#x27;s Kingdom&quot; (1957), starring Dirk Bogarde, is the only feature film to tell a story about the Alberta oil industry.

Alberta has a rapidly burgeoning film industry based largely out of Calgary. During the industry’s nascent years, Alberta’s prairie landscape made it a popular location to shoot western films. These include: &quot;Days of Heaven&quot; (1978), &quot;Unforgiven&quot; (1992), &quot;Legends of the Fall&quot; (1994), &quot;Open Range&quot; (2003), &quot;Brokeback Mountain&quot; (2005), and &quot;The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford&quot; (2007).

In more recent years, the province has played host to many successful films either filmed or set almost entirely within the province. These include: Superman, Superman II, and Superman III (1983), The Revenant (2015), Ghostbusters (2020), Inception (2010), Cool Runnings (1993), The Bourne Legacy (2012), and others.

=== Music ===
Alberta is home to two professional orchestras: the Calgary Philharmonic Orchestra and the Edmonton Symphony Orchestra. The CPO was founded in 1955 upon the merger of two existing groups. From 1957 to 1985 the orchestra&#x27;s home was the Southern Alberta Jubilee Auditorium, after which time it moved to the new Jack Singer Concert Hall, where it remains today. The EPO was founded in 1952 upon the merger of two groups. From 1952 to 1997 its home was the Northern Alberta Jubilee Auditorium, after which time it moved to the Winspear Centre, where it remains today.

Several prominent classical composers originate from Alberta or have lived there. In 1962, Montreal-born composer Violet Archer (1913-2000) moved to Edmonton after taking a position in the music department at the University of Alberta. Archer remained in Edmonton for the duration of her life and often drew from the Alberta landscape for inspiration. Other Alberta composers include Allan Gordon Bell (1953-) and Allan Gilliland (1965-), both of whom studied under Archer. South African-born composer Malcolm Forsyth lived in Edmonton from 1968 until his death in 2011. Perhaps his best-known composition is &quot;Atayoskewin&quot; from 1984, which depicts Alberta&#x27;s northern landscape.

Alberta has long had a vibrant jazz scene. The Edmonton jazz club Yardbird Suite has been in operation since 1984, making it one of the longest-running clubs in the country. It features local, national, and international musicians and has been the site of many live recordings. From 1987 to 2012 Calgary also had a jazz club, the Beat Niq. Perhaps the two most famous jazz musicians from Alberta are saxophonist P. J. Perry (1941-) and pianist Tommy Banks (1936-2018). Perry was born in Red Deer and as a teenager played in his father&#x27;s band, the Paul Perry Orchestra, at Varsity Hall in Sylvan Lake during the summer months. Banks was born in Calgary and before becoming a senator in 2011 was the host of the television programme &quot;The Tommy Banks Show&quot;.

The country and western genre plays a significant part in Alberta&#x27;s music scene. Although born in Victoria, British Columbia, Ian Tyson (1933-) is arguably the province&#x27;s most famous country musician. In 1963, as part of the duo Ian and Sylvia, Tyson recorded the song &quot;Four Strong Winds,&quot; which became one of Canada&#x27;s most famous songs and whose lyrics explicitly discuss Alberta. Since the late 1960s Tyson has resided on a ranch near Longview, Alberta, and has recorded numerous cowboy-themed albums. Another of Alberta&#x27;s best-known country and western performers is Corb Lund (1969-) and his band The Hurtin&#x27; Albertans. Lund&#x27;s songs regularly discuss Albertan subjects. Gord Bamford, although born in Australia, grew up and still resides in Alberta.

A number of successful pop musicians and bands have come from Alberta. These include performers Jann Arden (1962-), k.d. Lang (1961-), Joni Mitchell (1943-), Feist (1976-), and bands Loverboy, The Stampeders, Nickelback, The Dudes, and Tegan and Sara.

An important musical institution is the province-wide CKUA Radio Network. The station originated in 1927 when the Extension Department of the University of Alberta purchased the license to CFCK. CKUA is fully donor funded, and its programming includes all types of music. Since 2012 the station has been based at the newly renovated Alberta Hotel at 9804 Jasper Avenue. CKUA also has a satellite broadcast location in the King Edward Hotel in Calgary.

=== Painting ===
The first visual art produced in Alberta was made the members of Aboriginal tribes such as the Blackfoot, Sarcee, and Nakota. Blackfoot pictographic art was made on media such as tipis, rock, and robes, and recurring subjects include spiritualism and inter-tribal war. One of the best-preserved examples of Aboriginal art in Alberta is at Writing-on-Stone Provincial Park near Lethbridge.

The first European artist to travel to Alberta was Paul Kane, who visited the province thrice in the late 1840s. Kane was enthralled by the expanse of the land and portrayed the west as romantic and exotic. Romanticisation of the landscape would remain a prominent feature throughout much of the province&#x27;s artistic history. In 1859 Kane published an account of his journeys entitled &quot;&quot;. Other European artists, such as James Alden and William Hind, journeyed to Alberta in the mid-19th century and produced romantic depictions of the land, similar to those of Kane. Watercolour was the preferred medium at this time as it was fast-drying and easily transportable.

Following the completion of the Canadian Pacific Railway in 1885, the company&#x27;s president William Van Horne began giving free passes to artists. Paintings produced by these artists would serve to promote travel to the newly-accessible region. Early artists to travel to the west on the CPR included John Fraser, Lucius O&#x27;Brien, Robert Ford Gagen, John A. Hammond, and Frederic Bell-Smith. Most of their paintings depict the mountains rather than the prairies.

In the years following World War I, Alberta artists began to establish institutions to support their craft. The first art classes in Alberta were held at the Provincial Institute of Technology and Art in Calgary in 1921. Teachers included Lars Jonson Haukaness (1927-1929), Alfred Crocker Leighton (1929-1935), and Henry George Glyde (1936-1946). Students to come out of the two-year programme included William Leroy Stevenson, Maxwell Bates, and Marion Nicoll. Numerous art clubs formed around this time as well, included in Edmonton Art Association (1914), Lethbridge Sketch Club (1936), Medicine Hat Art Club (1945), and the Red Deer Art Club (late-1940s). Crucially, in 1935 art classes began at the Banff School of Fine Arts, which remains a vital artistic institution in Alberta today. An important guest at the Medicine Hat club was Walter J. Phillips. The most famous artist to originate from Medicine Hat was Roloff Beny. Several new galleries also opened in this era, including the Edmonton Museum of Arts (1924) and the Canadian Art Galleries (1945). All members of the Group of Seven (excluding Franklin Carmichael and Frederick Varley) painted in Alberta. A. Y. Jackson was the only member to paint prairie landscapes as well as mountains. In the 1940s and 50s, a new generation of Aboriginal artists – including Gerald Tailfeathers and Percy Two Gun – began depicting their communities using European techniques and tools.

Prior to the 1960s, only a select few artists painted in the modernist style. These included Bates, Stevenson, and Nicoll, as well as Stanford Perrott, Jock Macdonald, Helen Stadelbauer, Ron Spickett, and Roy Kiyooka. The Emma Lake Artist&#x27;s Workshops of the 1950s helped to spread modernism. Guests at the workshops included Will Barnet and Barnett Newman. In 1960, the new University of Calgary – which until 1966 was a satellite campus of the University of Alberta – had from its inception an art programme. Faculty included Helen Stadelbauer, Eric Dodd, Harry Kiyooka, Ken Esler, and Ron Spickett.

Following the 1960s, modernism and abstraction took a prominent place in the Alberta arts scene. Many new galleries emerged, including the Walter Phillips Gallery (1976), the Nickle Arts Museum (1979), the Medicine Hat Art Gallery (1967), and the Muttart Art Gallery (1977). In 1975 a large collection of Alberta art was showcased at Canada House in London, and was introduced by Premier Peter Lougheed&#x27;s wife Jeanne. Important post-1960 artists include Robert Scott, Graham Peacock, Douglas Haynes, John Brocke, and Takao Tanabe. Although he spend much of his career in Saskatchewan, Ted Godwin remained an important member of the Albertan art community.

== Sport ==

=== Football ===

A central element of sporting culture in Alberta is the rivalry between teams from Edmonton and Calgary, known as the &quot;Battle of Alberta.&quot; This rivalry exists across multiple sports and leagues. Calgary and Edmonton teams have competed against one another in football since around the 1890s. Rivalries between the cities existed via various Calgary and Edmonton clubs that participated in the Alberta Rugby Football Union. Following World War II, the Calgary Stampeders and Edmonton Eskimos formed, in 1948 and 1949 respectively, both of whom played in the Western Interprovincial Football Union, the precursor to the modern CFL West Division. The Stampeders and Eskimos quickly developed into rivals. Every year since 1949 (excluding 1954–1958, 1964–1967, 1973, and 1981), the two clubs have competed against one another in the &quot;Labour Day Classic,&quot; which is arguably the province&#x27;s paramount annual sporting event. The game has always been played in Calgary, with the exception of the years 1949, 1952, and 1953. A newer tradition formed later, the &quot;Labour Day Rematch,&quot; in which Edmonton hosts Calgary the week after Labour Day. This game was first played in 1989 and has been held annually since 1992. In 1948 the Calgary Stampeders competed in their first Grey Cup. Along with the team, a delegation from Calgary chartered a train to Toronto to support the team. This delegation took with it a full car of livestock and chuckwagons. Notoriously, members of the Stampeders delegation rode a horse into the lobby of the Royal York after disembarking at Union Station. The ritual of riding a horse into a hotel in the host city is a tradition Calgarians continue today when the Stampeders play in the Grey Cup.

=== Hockey ===

Calgary and Edmonton have likewise competed against one another in hockey since the 1890s. Teams in senior leagues such as the Western Canada Hockey League, and junior leagues such as the Western Hockey League, played against one another for most of the 20th century. It was not until the 1980s, however, that both cities had professional teams that could sustain a rivalry. The Edmonton Oilers first played in the 1972–73 season of the World Hockey Association. After that league folded in the summer of 1979, the Oilers joined the NHL for the 1979–80 season. The Calgary Flames began life as the Atlanta Flames in the 1972–73 season of the National Hockey League, and after a group of Calgary businessmen bought the team, the club relocated to Calgary for the 1980–81 season. The Flames played their first three seasons in the Stampede Corral before moving to the Olympic Saddledome for the 1983–84 season. The golden age of the Flames-Oilers rivalry was the late 1980s, when the two teams were at the pinnacle of their power. During this era both clubs featured a balance of skill and toughness that resulted in many high-scoring, fight-filled games. From 1983 to 1990, the Stanley Cup Finals included either the Oilers or Flames. Since the 1980s, the teams have not been competitive simultaneously, which has meant that the rivalry has diminished to an extent. Edmonton last played in the Stanley Cup Finals in 2006, while Calgary last played in the Finals in 2004. Unquestionably the greatest sports star in Alberta&#x27;s history is Wayne Gretzky, who played for the Edmonton Oilers from 1979 to 1988.

Junior hockey leagues such as the Western Hockey League and the Alberta Junior Hockey League play an important cultural role in the province&#x27;s small towns.

=== Rodeo and chuckwagons ===

The first rodeo in Canada was held in Raymond, Alberta in 1902, and was organized by Ray Knight. The sport soon became popular across the province and in 1912 Guy Weadick along with businessmen Pat Burns, George Lane, A. J. McLean, and A. E. Cross – collectively known as the &quot;Big Four&quot; – added the first Calgary Stampede to the Calgary Exhibition, which had existed since 1886. The event has taken place annually since then and remains the city&#x27;s greatest tourist attraction. The province hosts the majority of rodeos in the Canadian Professional Rodeo Association season. Other larger rodeos include the Ponoka Stampede and the Guy Weadick Days in High River.

The sport of chuckwagon racing was invented by Guy Weadick, and formal races were first held at the 1923 Calgary Stampede under the name the &quot;Rangeland Derby.&quot; The majority of races during the World Professional Chuckwagon Association (WPCA) season take place in Alberta.

=== Skiing ===

Alberta is bounded on the west by the Canadian Rockies, and consequently, possesses some of the world&#x27;s finest skiing destinations. During the winter, many Albertans spend their weekends in the mountains. Major ski hills include Sunshine Village, Lake Louise, Nakiska, Mount Norquay, Castle Mountain, and Marmot Basin. The alpine skiing at the 1988 Olympics was held at Nakiska. Calgary is home to Canada Olympic Park, which includes the ski jump and bobsleigh track that were used for the 1988 Olympics.

== Cuisine ==

=== Food ===
Alberta&#x27;s ranches contain just over 40% of the country&#x27;s beef cattle herd. Accordingly, beef is one of the province&#x27;s most prominent foods. One of Alberta&#x27;s most famous restaurants is Hy&#x27;s Steakhouse, which was founded in Calgary in 1955 by Hy Aisenstat, and has since opened restaurants in several other Canadian cities. Other iconic steakhouses include the Longview Steakhouse and Caesars Steakhouse. Historically, most small towns in the province had a Chinese Café on their main streets, and Canadian-Chinese cuisine remains an important food. The dish ginger beef was invented in the 1970s by chef George Wong at the Silver Inn in Calgary. In central Alberta, which has a large population of Eastern-European descent, pierogies are a popular food. Pierogies are often served in Ukrainian churches and community halls in small towns. During Stampede week in Calgary, communities across the city host free pancake breakfasts to celebrate the event.

Signature ingredients of Alberta include honey, canola, Red Fife wheat, Saskatoon berries, and root vegetables. Alberta is the fifth-largest honey-producing region in the world, producing 40 million pounds of honey a year, which is half the total production of Canada. Albertan honey is distinct for its white colour and creamy consistency due to local red clover and alfalfa. Canola, short for &quot;Canadian oil&quot;, was developed in Alberta, and the province produces 15 million tonnes annually. Red Fife wheat was the first breed of wheat to grow in Canada, is credited for having saved pioneers from starvation, and can be found in Alberta bakeries in sourdough loaves, baguettes, croissants, and more. Saskatoon berries are indigenous to Alberta, are typically used in jams, jellies, pies, and butter tarts, and have historically been used for tea and to make pemmican.

=== Drink ===
The oldest distillery in the province is Alberta Distillers, which was founded in 1946 by Frank McMahon and George H. Reifel. Alberta Distillers&#x27; best-known product is Alberta Premium, a 100% rye-grain whiskey. The cocktail &quot;Bloody Caesar,&quot; or simply &quot;Caesar,&quot; was invented at the Calgary Inn (now The Westin Calgary) in 1969 by bartender Walter Chell (1926-1997). This drink has since become one of the most popular cocktails in Canada.

Alberta&#x27;s most famous beer is Old Style Pilsner, which was first brewed in 1926 by Fritz Sick at Sick&#x27;s Breweries in Lethbridge. The recipe was bought in 1958 by Molson and the beer is no longer brewed in Alberta, however, it remains a popular drink in the province. Another historic beer is Calgary Beer, which was first brewed in 1892 by the Calgary Brewing and Malting Company, founded by A. E. Cross. Its iconic &quot;buffalo head and horseshoe&quot; logo was for decades a prominent emblem of the city and appeared on the jerseys of many sports teams. As with Old Style Pilsner, Calgary Beer is no longer brewed in the city and is only available for purchase in Saskatchewan. One of Edmonton&#x27;s historic breweries was Northwest Brewing, which had been founded by Robert Oschner in 1894 as Strathcona Brewing before changing its name in 1923. Its most popular product was Bohemian Maid Beer. The brewery closed in 1975. The area around the former Edmonton Brewing and Malting Company has been redeveloped as the Brewery District. Newer Alberta breweries whose beers are popular include Big Rock Brewery, Wild Rose Brewery, and Alley Kat Brewing.

Alberta is also the origin of several well-known cocktails. The &quot;B-52&quot;, invented at the Banff Springs Hotels, is a layered shot composed of coffee liqueur, Irish cream, and Grand Marnier (substitutes include triple sec or Cointreau). The &quot;Angry Canadian&quot;, invented in Calgary, is an Old Fashioned variety made with Canadian rye whiskey, bitters, club soda or water, and pure maple syrup.

== Costume ==
Albertans often don western wear for public events. In Calgary, many citizens wear cowboy hats and boots during Stampede week in July. Since 1950, Calgary has presented its &quot;White Hat&quot; to visiting dignitaries upon their arrival. The official manufacturer of the Calgary White Hat is Smithbilt Hats. Smithbilt was founded in 1919 by Morris Schumiatcher, who had immigrated to Canada from Russia in 1910, and for 100 years has been the city&#x27;s preeminent manufacturer of cowboy hats. Two major western wear retailers were started in Alberta: Riley and McCormick, founded in 1901, and Lammle&#x27;s, founded in 1983. During World War I, Riley and McCormick provided saddles for the Russian cavalry, and in 1919 when the Prince of Wales purchased his E.P. Ranch, fully equipped its staff.

== Symbols ==
=== Decorative symbols ===

Alberta&#x27;s coat of arms was granted a royal warrant by King Edward VII on 30 May 1907. Originally, the coat of arms consisted exclusively of an escutcheon (shield). At the top of the escutcheon is a Saint George&#x27;s Cross, which alludes to the arms of the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company, which formerly controlled the territory that is now Alberta. Below the cross are, from foreground to background, a wheat field, a grass prairie, foothills, and the Rocky Mountains. On 30 July 1980, Queen Elizabeth II granted a second royal warrant which augmented the shield with supporters, a crest, and motto. These elements include a beaver (representing Canada), a lion (representing the monarchy), and a pronghorn antelope (representing the province proper). The motto in the arms is &quot;fortis et liber,&quot; or &quot;strong and free.&quot;

On 1 June 1968 Alberta adopted its official flag. The flag consists of the province&#x27;s shield centered on an ultramarine background. Alberta has two tartans: regular and dress. The regular tartan was adopted in 1961, and its colour scheme represents the green of forests, the gold of wheat fields, the blue of skies and lakes, the pink of wild rose, and the black of coal and petroleum. The dress tartan was adopted in 2000, and its colour scheme represents the Alberta landscape in winter.

=== Natural symbols ===

Alberta&#x27;s best-known natural symbol is the wild rose. The province&#x27;s license plates include the phrase &quot;Wild Rose Country,&quot; reflecting the flower&#x27;s symbolic importance. Alberta&#x27;s provincial tree is the lodgepole pine, its provincial mammal is the bighorn sheep, and its provincial bird is the great horned owl.

=== Monarchy ===
Alberta, named after Princess Louise Caroline Alberta (1848–1939), maintains a strong relationship with the Canadian Royal Family. Other royal eponyms include the towns Empress, Lake Louise, Princess, Patricia, and Coronation; the neighbourhoods Prince Rupert, Victoria Park, Connaught, Athlone, King Edward Park, Queen Alexandra, Queen Mary Park, and Prince Charles; the mountains Mount Victoria, Little Alberta, Mount Alberta, Princess Margaret Mountain, and the Queen Elizabeth Ranges; the lakes Lake Louise and Patricia Lake; and the roads Marquis of Lorne Trail, Kingsway, Queen Elizabeth II Highway, and Princess Elizabeth Avenue.

The first reigning monarch to visit Alberta was King George VI, who during his 1939 tour of Canada stayed in Calgary on 26 May and in Banff on 27 May. The Lieutenant Governor of Alberta lives in the province&#x27;s capital, Edmonton, and the position is held by Salma Lakhani. Government House was built in 1913 to house the LG; however, it has not been used for that purpose since 1938. The Lieutenant Governor does, however, still use it to host her annual Christmas tea and New Year&#x27;s levée, both of which the public may attend. Canada&#x27;s current Sovereign, Charles, Prince of Wales first visited Alberta in July 1977 to mark the centenary of Treaty 7. Charles visited again in 1983 with his wife Diana, Princess of Wales. Canada&#x27;s former Sovereign, Queen Elizabeth II, has visited Alberta six times: in 1951 (as princess), 1959, 1973, 1978, 1990, and 2005. Her most recent visit was to celebrate the centennials of Alberta and Saskatchewan. Many other members of Canada&#x27;s Royal Family have spent time in Alberta. From 1919 to 1962 Edward, Prince of Wales (later King Edward VIII) owned a property south of Calgary, the E.P. Ranch, beside the Bar U Ranch. Heir to the Canadian throne, Prince William, Duke of Cambridge, visited Alberta for the first time in July 2011.

== Museums and galleries ==
=== Museums ===

Alberta&#x27;s state museum is the Royal Alberta Museum, located in Edmonton. Opened in 1967 as the Provincial Museum of Alberta, the museum contains life science, earth science, and human history collections. During her 2005 visit to the province, Queen Elizabeth II granted the museum royal patronage, at which time it became the Royal Alberta Museum. In October 2018 the museum moved from its original location in Glenora to a new building downtown. Calgary&#x27;s largest museum is the Glenbow Museum, which was founded in 1966 by oilman and collector Eric Harvie. The Glenbow boasts a diverse collection of local and international objects. One of the province&#x27;s unique attractions is the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology, located in Drumheller. In Wetaskiwin is the Reynolds-Alberta Museum, which owns one of the world&#x27;s largest collection of moving machines. The Whyte Museum in Banff opened in 1968 and focuses largely on art and artefacts related to the Rocky Mountains. Aviation museums include the Bomber Command Museum of Canada in Nanton, Hangar Flight Museum in Calgary, the Cold Lake Air Force Museum, and the Alberta Aviation Museum in Edmonton. Sports museums include Canada&#x27;s Sports Hall of Fame in Calgary and the Alberta Sports Hall of Fame in Red Deer.

=== Galleries ===

The province&#x27;s largest gallery is the Art Gallery of Alberta in Edmonton. The museum&#x27;s origins date to 1924 when the Edmonton Museum of Arts was founded, which in 1956 became the Edmonton Art Museum. In 2005 the gallery moved from its home at the Arthur Blow Condell Memorial Building to a new building designed by Randall Stout, and at this time changed its name to the Art Gallery of Alberta. The Southern Alberta Art Gallery in Lethbridge, which opened in 1976, is a leader in contemporary art.

<text>A medical license is an occupational license that permits a person to legally practice medicine. In most countries, a person must have a medical license bestowed either by a specified government-approved professional association or a government agency before they can practice medicine. Licenses are not granted automatically to all people with medical degrees. A medical school graduate must receive a license to practice medicine to legally be called a physician. The process typically requires testing by a medical board. The medical license is the documentation of authority to practice medicine within a certain locality. An active license is also required to practice medicine as an assistant physician, a physician assistant or a clinical officer in jurisdictions with authorizing legislation.

A professional may have their license removed due to if they are not deemed fit to practise, such as due to a lack of competence, health reasons, or ethical violations. The license will limit a professional&#x27;s scope of practice.

== Canada ==
Canada requires that applicants have graduated from a school registered in the World Directory of Medical Schools, and apply to sit the &quot;Medical Council of Canada Qualifying Examination&quot;. Licenses are issued by Provincial bodies. A brief history of medical licensing in Ontario and Quebec, with a list of physicians licensed prior to 1867, is available at David Crawford&#x27;s website.

===Criticism===
An article from 2013 says of the road to licensing in Canada, &quot;The path through immigration, residency training, licensure and employment promises to remain a difficult road to navigate,&quot; and emphasizes that the current and future demand for healthcare. This emphasizes that there are a number of barriers that doctors face when it comes to practicing, yet there is a very high demand for doctors.

==China==
Medical practitioners in China started to be licensed for the first time when Law of the People&#x27;s Republic of China on Medical Practitioners passed on June 26, 1998. The law, which came into effect May 1, 1999, requires all newly graduated medical students to sit the National Medical Licensing Examination, regulated by the National Medical Examination Center, and then register with the local regulatory body. The two-part exam includes a Clinical Skill (CS) test and a General Written (GW) test. The candidates must pass the CS test to take the GW test. Each year, the CS is held in July, followed by the GW in September. The medical practitioners on the job who had obtained a primary medical qualification (i.e., Bachelor of Medicine) prior to law are not required to sit the exam and can directly be licensed.

==Colombia==

The Instituto Colombiano para el Fomento de la Educación Superior (ICFES) and the Ministry of Education regulate the medical schools that are licensed to offer medical degrees. After completing all the schools&#x27; requirements to obtain a medical degree, physicians must serve the &quot;obligatory social service&quot; (in rural areas, research, public health or special populations e.g., orphan children), which usually lasts one year. After completing the social service, a doctor obtains a &quot;medical registration&quot; at the governor&#x27;s office (Gobernación) of the Department (province/state) where they served the obligatory term. This registration is the same as a license in other countries, and authorizes the physician to practice medicine anywhere in the national territory. However, to practice in other departments requires an inscription from that department. Unlike the US, there is no official licensing exam for medical graduates in Colombia, since this responsibility is delegated to medical schools that have permission to confer medical degrees.

==Germany==
In Germany, licensing of doctors (&quot;Approbation&quot;) is the responsibility of the state governments. Licensed doctors are compulsory members of &quot;Ärztekammern&quot; (literally: &quot;Physician chambers&quot;), which are medical associations organized on state level. Criteria for licensing of doctors are regulated in the , which is a piece of federal law. According to the licensing regulations, the physician must have successfully completed his medical studies and passed the (final) examination. He or she must not have engaged in negative behavior that would raise clear concerns about his or her suitability (e.g., practicing a criminal offense). Furthermore, the physician must meet the health requirements and have sufficient German language skills to be able to perform the profession.

Physicians who have not studied medicine in Germany, among others, must prove their language skills by means of a German B2 certificate and a successfully completed Fachsprachprüfung. In addition, doctors who have not studied in the EU, EEA or Switzerland must prove that their studies are equivalent. For this purpose, they usually have to pass a Kenntnisprüfung (&quot;test of competence&quot;).

==India==
In India, certification requires that a medical school graduate pass the final MBBS examination and undergo a one-year internship in a hospital recognised by the National Medical Commission erstwhile Medical Council of India. Foreign medical graduates must take the Foreign Medical Graduates Examination (FMGE), conducted by the National Board of Examinations (NBE). They can practice medicine throughout the country after certifying themselves as per Indian Medical Council Act, 1956. Doctors registered with any one state medical council are automatically included in the Indian Medical Register and thereby entitled to practice medicine anywhere in India.
The MCI Ethics Committee observed in a meeting held on September 2, 2004, that, &quot;There is no necessity of registration in more than one state medical council because any doctor, who has registered with any state medical council is automatically registered in the Indian Medical Register and also by virtue of Section 27 of the IMC Act, 1956, a person, whose name is included in the IMR, can practice anywhere in India.&quot; The Registered Doctors with various State Medical Councils across India up to the year 2019 can be checked in the Medical Council of India&#x27;s Indian Medical Registry official website.

==UK==
The term &quot;Medical License&quot; is US-centric terminology. In the UK and in other Commonwealth countries the analogous instrument is called registration; i.e., being on the register or being/getting struck off (the register). The General Medical Council is the regulatory body for doctor&#x27;s licensing in the UK. Currently, there are two types of basic registration: &quot;Provisional Registration&quot; and &quot;Full Registration&quot;, and two types of specialty registration: &quot;Specialist Registration&quot; and &quot;GP registration&quot;. In November 2009, the GMC introduced the &quot;licence to practise&quot;, and it is required by law that to practice medicine in the UK, all doctors must be registered and hold a license to practice. The registration information for all doctors holding a license in the UK is available online at the GMC website.

==United States==
In the United States, medical licenses are usually granted by individual states. Only those with medical degrees from schools listed in the World Directory of Medical Schools are permitted to apply for medical licensure. Board certification is a separate process.

The federal government does not grant licenses. A physician practicing in a federal facility, federal prison, US Military, and/or an Indigenous Reservation may have a license from any state, not just the one they are residing in. The practice of &quot;tele-medicine&quot; has made it common for physicians to consult or interpret images and information from a distant location. Some states have special licensure for this. The licensure process for most physicians takes between three and six months, due to the extensive background checks, educational, training, and historical primary source verifications.

===History===
The Tenth Amendment to the Constitution became the underpinning for the entire medical licensing system. Following several years of discussion and debate, the states&#x27; ratification of this amendment as part of the Bill of Rights concluded on December 15, 1791. It explicitly avowed that powers not granted to the federal government, nor prohibited to the states by the Constitution. The Tenth Amendment remains a living codification of states rights and is routinely cited by state medical boards today to justify the authority delegated to them by their state legislatures. In 1811, Ohio passed legislation licensing physicians but repealed these laws in 1833. In 1817, Illinois legislated the medical practice, but had repealed these laws by 1826.

The American Medical Association when formed in 1847, proposed that the state legislate medicine (rather than each of the different medical schools). Horowitz argues that this suggestion was made in order to gain greater control over medical education.

In the 1870s, almost all U.S. physicians were still unlicensed. The majority of physicians had M.D. degrees earned in American medical schools. The rest were mostly either homeopaths or eclectics. Homeopaths were trained in a pseudoscientific system known as homeopathy that had been developed by Samuel Hahnemann. Eclectics physicians also attended medical schools, but their practice mixed mainstream medicine with Thomsonsianism, a system of herbalism. Each of these groups was organized into both national and state medical societies across the United States.

In 1877, the Illinois legislature passed the Illinois medical licensing law, which led to the aggressive prosecution of physicians that were perceived as illegal or unethical. Medical boards of other states (often composed of both regular and irregular physicians) followed suit. Some authors claim that these efforts allowed organized regular and irregular physicians to exclude not only fraudulent practitioners, but other groups, including midwives, clairvoyants, osteopaths, Christian Scientists, and magnetic healers.

In 1889, &quot;Dent v. West Virginia&quot;, the U.S. Supreme Court for the first time upheld a state physician licensing law. A practitioner with insufficient credentials to obtain a medical license sued West Virginia, claiming a violation of his rights under the due process clause of the 14th Amendment. The Supreme Court upheld the statute noting that, while each citizen had a right to follow any lawful calling, they were subject to reasonable state restrictions. Because of the nature of medical training, the large amount of knowledge required, and the life-and-death circumstances with which physicians dealt, patients needed to rely on the assurance of a license requiring physicians to meet a minimum set of standards.

In 1956, the Federation of State Medical Boards released &quot;A Guide to the Essentials of a Modern Medical Practice Act.&quot; The report distilled a series of recommendations that addressed five core areas: the definition of the practice of medicine; eligibility standards for licensure; licensing examinations; licensure endorsement; and the bases for probation, suspension, or revocation of a license. Since its initial publication in 1956, the Essentials of a Modern Medical Practice Act has passed through thirteen updated editions, with the most recent in 2012.

By the beginning of the 20th century most states had implemented licensing laws.During the 20th century, medical boards sought to eliminate diploma mills by expanding their requirements for medical schools. They started to dictate the length and type of education required for licensing. As early as 1910, all but 12 states excluded physicians from medical practice if their schools were not found to be in &quot;good standing&quot;. Between 1910 and 1935, more than half of all American medical schools merged or closed, in some part due to all state medical boards gradually adopting and enforcing the Flexner Report&#x27;s recommendations on having all schools connected to universities.

Today, physicians are amongst the most highly regulated professionals with detailed criteria for licensing established by medical boards in each state, however, lack of discretionary action against physician misconduct by state medical boards has been criticized in recent years for their failure to discipline physicians, despite several consumer concerns and complaints.
===Criticism===

According to a 1979 article in the &quot;Journal of Libertarian Studies&quot;, the enactment of U.S. state medical licensing laws in the late 1800s was for the primary purpose of reducing competition and allowing physicians to make more money. 
The added benefit of public safety made restrictive licensure laws more appealing to both physicians and legislators. Infrequently mentioned in the literature, is that the &quot;public safety&quot; that is created by reducing the number of practitioners only extends to the patients who receive medical care. Thus, the overall effect is more expensive and higher-quality medical care for fewer patients.

Beyond the more general criticisms of occupational licensing that licensing increases costs and fails to improve quality, licensing in the medical profession specifically has been criticized as failing to enforce the standard practices they are charged with enforcing. In 1986, Inspector General at the United States Department of Health and Human Services said that medical boards took &quot;strikingly few disciplinary actions&quot; for physician misconduct.
There have been a number of cases involving patient deaths where physicians only had their licenses removed years after multiple wrongful patient deaths had happened. State medical boards have increased the number of disciplinary actions against physicians since the 1980s.

Also, it has been said that because hospitals have had more legal burden placed on them in recent decades, they have more of an incentive to require that their physicians be competent. Thus, the process whereby physicians are reviewed and licensed by the state medical board results in some duplicate evaluations. The physician is evaluated both in the licensure process and then again by the hospital for the purpose of credentialing and granting hospital privileges.

Laws in some states prohibit interstate telemedicine without a license to practice in the state where the patient is located. This reduces access to care.

===Patient protection===
State medical boards cannot assure a high standard of care, they do not review physicians on a regular basis, nor do they evaluate clinicians at the point of care. It is provider liability that results in oversight that protects consumers, and even that is imperfect. Before they employ or associate with individual physicians, via credentialing and privileging, providers confirm the training, knowledge and skills needed to take on relevant tasks. They review any sanctions and malpractice claims. There are cases where physician liability has been stripped by federal regulations, with adverse impacts, as on an Indian Reservation. Medical professional liability insurance companies deny problem physicians malpractice insurance or limit their practice.
