<text>Alexander Emerick Jones (born February 11, 1974) is an American far-right radio show host and prominent conspiracy theorist. He hosts &quot;The Alex Jones Show&quot; from Austin, Texas, which is the longest-running online news and politics talk show, and was previously broadcast by the Genesis Communications Network across the United States via syndicated and internet radio. He is the founder of &quot;InfoWars and Banned.Video&quot;, websites that promote conspiracy theories and fake news. 

Among many other conspiracy theories, Jones has alleged that the United States government either concealed information about or outright falsified the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, the Oklahoma City bombing, the September 11 attacks, and the 1969 Moon landing. He has also claimed that several governments and large businesses have colluded to create a globalist &quot;New World Order&quot; through &quot;manufactured economic crises, sophisticated surveillance tech and—above all—inside-job terror attacks that fuel exploitable hysteria&quot;. Jones has provided a platform for white nationalists and neo-Nazis on his website, &quot;Banned.Video&quot;, as well as providing an &quot;entry point&quot; to their ideology. In 2023, leaked texts from Jones&#x27;s phone revealed that he created the website &quot;National File&quot; to evade social media bans on &quot;InfoWars&quot; content.

A longtime critic of Republican and Democratic foreign and security policy, Jones supported Donald Trump&#x27;s 2016 presidential bid and continued to support him as a savior from an alleged criminal bipartisan cabal controlling the federal government, despite also falling out with Trump over several of his policies, including airstrikes against the Assad regime. A staunch supporter of Trump&#x27;s re-election, Jones also supported the attempts to overturn the 2020 United States presidential election. On January 6, 2021, Jones was a speaker at the rally in Lafayette Square Park supporting Trump preceding the latter&#x27;s supporters&#x27; attack on the US Capitol.

In October 2022, for Jones&#x27;s defamatory falsehoods about the Sandy Hook shooting, juries in Connecticut and Texas awarded a total of $1.487 billion in damages from Jones to a first responder and families of victims; the plaintiffs alleged that Jones&#x27;s lies led to them being threatened and harassed for years. On December 2, 2022, Jones filed for personal bankruptcy.

== Early life and influences ==
Alexander Emerick Jones was born on February 11, 1974, in Dallas, Texas, and was raised in Rockwall, 25 miles east of Dallas. His father was a dentist from Austin and his mother was a homemaker. He says he has English, German, Scottish, and Irish descent. The family moved to Austin in Jones&#x27;s second year of high school. He attended Anderson High School, where he played football and graduated in 1993. After graduating, Jones briefly attended Austin Community College before dropping out.

As a teenager, he read &quot;None Dare Call It Conspiracy&quot;, a book by John Birch Society conspiracy theorist Gary Allen, which alleged global bankers controlled American politics rather than elected officials. It had a profound influence on him, and Jones has described Allen&#x27;s work as &quot;the easiest-to-read primer on The New World Order&quot;.

===Waco siege and Oklahoma bombing===
The Waco siege at the Branch Davidian complex near Waco, Texas, had an impact on Jones. It ended in April 1993, near the end of Jones&#x27;s senior year of high school, with a substantial fire and a significant number of fatalities. According to the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC), these events &quot;only confirmed his belief in the inexorable progress of unseen, malevolent forces&quot;. It was at this time he started to host a call-in show on public access television (PACT/ACTV) in Austin.

The Oklahoma City bombing on April 19, 1995, was intended by perpetrator Timothy McVeigh as a response to the federal involvement in the botched resolution of the Waco siege on its second anniversary. Jones began accusing the federal government of having caused it: &quot;I understood there&#x27;s a kleptocracy working with psychopathic governments—clutches of evil that know the tricks of control&quot;. He did not believe the bombing had been the responsibility of McVeigh and his associate Terry Nichols. In 1998, he released his first film, &quot;America Destroyed by Design&quot;.

In 1998, Jones organized a successful campaign to build a new Branch Davidian church as a memorial to those who died during the 1993 fire. He often discussed the project on his public-access television program. He claimed that David Koresh and his followers were peaceful people who were murdered by Attorney General Janet Reno and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms during the siege.

== Early broadcasting career ==
Jones began his career in Austin working on a live, call-in format public-access cable television program. In 1996, Jones switched to radio, hosting a show named &quot;The Final Edition&quot; on KJFK (98.9 FM). Influenced by radio host William Cooper, who phoned in to Jones&#x27;s early shows, Jones began to broadcast about the New World Order conspiracy theory at this time.

While running for Congress, Ron Paul was a guest on his show several times. In 1999, Jones tied with Shannon Burke for that year&#x27;s poll of &quot;Best Austin Talk Radio Host&quot;, as voted by readers of &quot;The Austin Chronicle.&quot; Later that year, he was fired from KJFK-FM for refusing to broaden his topics. The station&#x27;s operations manager said that Jones&#x27;s views made it difficult for the station to sell advertising. Jones said:

== &quot;InfoWars&quot; ==

In about 1999, Jones founded with his then-wife Kelly Jones the website &quot;InfoWars&quot;, initially as a mail-order outlet for the sale of their conspiracy-oriented videos. Over time, &quot;InfoWars&quot;, with Jones as its publisher and director, became a prominent fake news website centered on promoting conspiracy theories. In November 2016, the &quot;InfoWars&quot; website received approximately 10 million visits, making its reach more extensive than mainstream news websites such as &quot;The Economist&quot; and &quot;Newsweek&quot;. Another of Jones&#x27;s websites is PrisonPlanet.com.

=== &quot;The Alex Jones Show&quot; ===
After his firing from KJFK-FM, Jones began to broadcast his own show by Internet connection from his home. In July 2000, a group of Austin Community Access Center (ACAC) radio hosts claimed that Jones had used legal proceedings and ACAC policy to intimidate them or try to get their broadcasts removed. In 2001, Jones&#x27;s radio show was syndicated on approximately 100 stations.

On the day of the 9/11 attacks, Jones said on his radio show there was a &quot;98 percent chance this was a government-orchestrated controlled bombing&quot;. He began promoting the conspiracy theory that the Bush administration was behind the attack. As a result, several stations dropped Jones&#x27;s program, according to columnist Will Bunch. Jones became a leading figure of the &quot;9/11 truther&quot; cause. In 2010, the show attracted around two million listeners each week. According to Alexander Zaitchik of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine, in 2011 Jones had a larger on-line audience than Glenn Beck and Rush Limbaugh combined. In 2020, &quot;The Alex Jones Show&quot; was syndicated nationally by the Genesis Communications Network to more than 100 AM and FM radio stations in the United States.

According to journalist Will Bunch, a senior fellow at Media Matters for America, the show has a demographic that leans more towards younger listeners than do other conservative pundits, due to Jones&#x27;s &quot;highly conspiratorial tone and Web-oriented approach&quot;. Bunch also stated that Jones &quot;feed[s] on the deepest paranoia&quot;.

Jones told &quot;The Washington Post&quot; in November 2016 that his radio show, then syndicated to 129 stations, had a daily audience of five million listeners and his video streams had topped 80 million viewers in a single month.

Jones&#x27;s syndicator, Genesis Communications Network, announced its shutdown effective May 5, 2024, citing financial losses. The owners plan to migrate Jones&#x27;s show, and others, to other networks.

=== Website, own-brand and endorsed products ===

According to court testimony Jones delivered in 2014, &quot;InfoWars&quot; then had revenues of over $20 million a year.

A 2017 piece for German magazine &quot;Der Spiegel&quot; by Veit Medick indicated that two-thirds of Jones&#x27;s funds derive from sales of his own products. These products are marketed through the &quot;InfoWars&quot; website and through advertising spots on Jones&#x27;s show. They include dietary supplements, toothpaste, bulletproof vests and &quot;brain pills&quot;, which hold &quot;an appeal for anyone who believes Armageddon is near&quot;, according to Medick. From September 2015 to the end of 2018, the InfoWars store made $165 million in sales, according to court filings relating to the Sandy Hook lawsuits filed against Jones.

In August 2017, Californian medical company Labdoor, Inc reported on tests applied to six of Jones&#x27;s dietary supplement products. These included a product named Survival Shield, which was found by Labdoor to contain only iodine, and a product named Oxy-Powder, which comprised a compound of magnesium oxide and citric acid—common ingredients in dietary supplements. Labdoor indicated no evidence of prohibited or harmful substances, but cast doubt on the marketing claims for these products, and asserted that the quantity of the ingredients in certain products would be &quot;too low to be appropriately effective&quot;.

On a 2017 segment of &quot;Last Week Tonight&quot;, host John Oliver stated that Jones spends &quot;nearly a quarter&quot; of his on-air time promoting products sold on his website, many of which are purported solutions to medical and economic problems claimed to be caused by the conspiracy theories described on his show.

Research commissioned in 2017 by the Center for Environmental Health (CEH) determined that two products sold by Jones contained potentially dangerous levels of the heavy metal lead.

Jones continued his promotion of supplements during the COVID-19 pandemic. On March 12, 2020, Jones was issued a cease and desist from the Attorney General of New York, after he claimed, in the absence of any evidence, that products he sold, including colloidal silver toothpaste, were an effective treatment for COVID-19. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) also sent him a letter on April 9, 2020, warning that the federal government might proceed to seize the products he was marketing for COVID-19 or fine him if he continued to sell them. A disclaimer then appeared on Jones&#x27;s website, stating his products were not intended for treating &quot;the novel coronavirus&quot;. On a linked page, Jones was quoted: &quot;They plan on, if they&#x27;ve fluoridated you and vaccinated you and stunned you and mesmerized you with the TV and put you in a trance, on killing you.&quot; Jones continued to sell the products.

According to leaked text messages from Jones&#x27;s mobile phone, &quot;InfoWars&quot; sold VasoBeet, a product it described as a &quot;powerful beet formula&quot;, at a 900% retail markup as of September 2019. On January 29, 2020, &quot;InfoWars&quot; pulled in $245,000 in food sales, a day after Jones stoked fear about food shortages caused by the COVID-19 pandemic in a broadcast.

During the April 2022 &quot;InfoWars&quot; bankruptcy hearing, Jones&#x27;s representative stated, &quot;&quot;InfoWars&quot; is a prominent trademark in the conspiracy theory community and Alex Jones is equally as prominent&quot;. He added that Jones&#x27;s name was the &quot;Coca-Cola of the conspiracy theory community&quot;.

In 2023, Jones launched a new subscription-based podcast, &quot;Alex Jones Live&quot;. It was put on hold shortly after it began due to matters relating to his Sandy Hook case.

=== Social media restrictions and bans ===
In February 2018, YouTube issued a &quot;strike&quot; against the &quot;InfoWars&quot; channel after a video was posted in which Alex Jones accused David Hogg, a survivor of the Parkland school shooting, of being a paid &quot;crisis actor&quot;. YouTube removed the video for violating its policies against harassment and bullying.

On July 24, 2018, YouTube removed four &quot;InfoWars&quot;″ videos citing &quot;child endangerment and hate speech&quot;, issued another &quot;strike&quot; against the channel, and suspended the ability to live stream. On July 27, 2018, Facebook suspended Jones&#x27;s profile for 30 days, and removed the same videos, saying they violated the website&#x27;s standards against hate speech and bullying. On August 3, 2018, Stitcher Radio removed all of his podcasts, citing harassment.

Later that year, on August 6, 2018, Facebook, Apple, YouTube and Spotify removed all content by Jones and &quot;InfoWars&quot; for policy violations. YouTube removed channels associated with &quot;InfoWars&quot;, including The Alex Jones Channel, stating that &quot;InfoWars&quot; had repeatedly attempted to post content similar to that which had already been removed, as well as attempting to circumvent the suspension of its live streaming privileges by having other users live stream on its behalf. On Facebook, four pages associated with &quot;InfoWars&quot; and Alex Jones were removed over repeated policy violations. Apple removed all podcasts associated with Jones from iTunes. Facebook cited instances of dehumanizing immigrants, Muslims and transgender people, as well as glorification of violence, as examples of hate speech. After &quot;InfoWars&quot; was banned from Facebook, Jones used another of his websites, &quot;NewsWars&quot;, to circumvent the ban.

On August 13, 2018, Vimeo removed all of Jones&#x27;s videos because of &quot;prohibitions on discriminatory and hateful content&quot;.

Jones&#x27;s accounts were also removed from Pinterest, Mailchimp and LinkedIn. , Jones retained active accounts on Instagram, Google+ and Twitter. Jones tweeted a Periscope video calling on others to get their &quot;battle rifles&quot; ready against antifa, the mainstream media, and Chicom operatives. In the video, he says: &quot;Now is time to act on the enemy before they do a false flag.&quot; Twitter cited this as the reason to suspend his account for a week in August 2018.

In September, Jones was permanently banned from Twitter and Periscope after comments about CNN reporter Oliver Darcy. On September 7, 2018, the &quot;InfoWars&quot; app was removed from the Apple App Store for &quot;objectionable content&quot;. He was banned from using PayPal for business transactions, having violated the company&#x27;s policies by expressing &quot;hate or discriminatory intolerance against certain communities and religions&quot;. After Elon Musk&#x27;s purchase of Twitter, several previously banned accounts were reinstated including Donald Trump, Andrew Tate and Ye, but Jones was not among them. In November 2022, Musk referred to Jones as a person who &quot;would use the deaths of children for gain, politics or fame&quot; and said Jones would not be unbanned. He changed his position on December 10, 2023, when he reinstated Jones&#x27;s account citing that if Jones said something false, Community Notes would correct him.

&quot;InfoWars&quot; remained available on Roku devices, in January 2019, a year after the channel&#x27;s removal from multiple streaming services. Roku indicated that they do not &quot;curate or censor based on viewpoint&quot;, and that it had policies against content that is &quot;unlawful, incited illegal activities, or violates third-party rights&quot;, but that &quot;InfoWars&quot; was not in violation of these policies. Following a social media backlash, Roku removed &quot;InfoWars&quot; and stated, &quot;After the &quot;InfoWars&quot; channel became available, we heard from concerned parties and have determined that the channel should be removed from our platform.&quot;

In March 2019, YouTube terminated the Resistance News channel due to its reuploading of live streams from &quot;InfoWars&quot;. On May 1, 2019, Jones was barred from using both Facebook and Instagram. Jones briefly moved to Dlive, but was suspended in April 2019 for violating community guidelines.

In March 2020, the &quot;InfoWars&quot; app was removed from the Google Play store due to Jones disseminating COVID-19 misinformation. A Google spokesperson stated that &quot;combating misinformation on the Play Store is a top priority for the team&quot; and apps that violate Play policy by &quot;distributing misleading or harmful information&quot; are removed from the store.

Comedian Joe Rogan attracted controversy for hosting Jones on his podcast, &quot;The Joe Rogan Experience&quot;, in October 2020. The episode was made available on YouTube and Spotify in spite of Jones&#x27;s ban from both platforms. Though Rogan occasionally fact-checked Jones throughout the course of the interview, he nonetheless faced backlash from critics for giving Jones a platform to spread misinformation and validate his views. A YouTube spokesman responded that YouTube reviewed the episode and determined it did not violate the site&#x27;s guidelines, noting that YouTube bans channels rather than individuals.

In March 2023, the Southern Poverty Law Center reported on Jones&#x27; leaked texts from his Sandy Hook defamation trial. The texts revealed that Jones and his collaborators had been trying to evade social media bans of &quot;InfoWars&quot; content by setting up alternate websites such as &quot;National File&quot; to disguise its origin.

In May 2023, Jones guest hosted Steven Crowder&#x27;s podcast &quot;Louder with Crowder&quot;. Crowder&#x27;s channel was subsequently suspended by YouTube for facilitating ban evasion by Jones.

=== Shutdown, liquidation and sale===
On June 23, 2024, Christopher Murray, Jones&#x27; bankruptcy trustee, filed an emergency motion in a Houston court where he indicated his intent to not only sell &quot;InfoWars&quot;, but also shut down the website and liquidate its assets.
 In the motion, Murray stated that he made plans to &quot;conduct an orderly wind-down&quot; of the operations of &quot;InfoWars&quot;&#x27;s parent company and also &quot;liquidate its inventory.&quot; 

On November 14, 2024, a planned sale to &quot;The Onion&quot;, a satirical news site, was halted for review. 

On November 18, 2024, attorneys for Jones filed a lawsuit in the U.S Bankruptcy Court in Houston, alleging that &quot;The Onion&quot;&#x27;s parent company, Global Tetrahedron, and several families of victims of the Sandy Hook shooting, submitted an unlawful bid for the assets of &quot;InfoWars&quot;&#x27;s parent company. There was a court hearing on December 9. 

== Views and incidents ==
Jones has described himself as a conservative, paleoconservative, and libertarian, terms he uses interchangeably. Others describe him as right-wing, alt-right, far-right, and populist. Asked about such labels, Jones said he is &quot;proud to be listed as a thought criminal against Big Brother&quot;.

=== Early political activities ===

In 1998, he was removed from a George W. Bush rally at Bayport Industrial District, Texas. Jones interrupted Governor Bush&#x27;s speech, demanding that the Federal Reserve and Council on Foreign Relations be abolished. Journalist David Weigel, reporting on the incident, said Jones &quot;seemed to launch into public events as if flung from another universe&quot;.

In early 2000, Jones was one of seven Republican candidates for state representative in Texas House District 48, an open swing district based in Austin, Texas. Jones said that he was running &quot;to be a watchdog on the inside&quot; but withdrew from the race after a couple of weeks.

On July 15, 2000, Jones infiltrated the Bohemian Grove &quot;Cremation of Care&quot;, a Jones-alleged planning event of the New World Order involving child sacrifice, which he called &quot;a ritualistic shedding of conscience and empathy&quot; and an &quot;abuse of power&quot;.

On June 8, 2006, while on his way to cover a meeting of the Bilderberg Group in Ottawa, Jones was stopped and detained at the Ottawa airport by Canadian authorities. They confiscated his passport, camera equipment, and most of his belongings. He was later allowed to enter Canada legally. Jones said about his immigration hold: &quot;I want to say, on the record, it takes two to tango. I could have handled it better.&quot;

On September 8, 2007, Jones was arrested while protesting at 6th Avenue and 48th Street in New York City, when his group crashed a live television show featuring Geraldo Rivera. He was charged with operating a megaphone without a permit, and two other persons were also cited for disorderly conduct.

=== Gun rights ===
Jones is a vocal gun rights advocate. MTV labeled him a &quot;staunch Second Amendment supporter&quot;, while &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; in London called him a &quot;gun-nut&quot;.

In January 2013, Jones was invited to speak on Piers Morgan&#x27;s CNN show after Jones promoted an online petition to deport Morgan for supporting gun control. In the ensuing debate with Morgan, Jones stated that &quot;1776 will commence again if you try to take our firearms&quot;. Jones was referring to the American Revolutionary War in relation to theoretical gun control measures taken by the government. Jones said he owned around 50 firearms. Morgan said on CNN&#x27;s &quot;Newsroom&quot; the following evening he couldn&#x27;t conceive of a &quot;better advertisement for gun control than Alex Jones&#x27; interview last night&quot;. On his own show, according to &quot;The Atlantic&quot;, Glenn Beck said Morgan &quot;is trying to make everybody who has guns and who believes in the Second Amendment to be a deterrent to an out of control government look like a madman. So now he immediately books the madman and makes him look like a conservative.&quot;

In a &quot;New York&quot; magazine interview in November 2013, Jones said mass shootings in the United States &quot;were very, very suspicious, but at minimum, the tragic events were used to try to create guilt on the part of the average gun owner. So via the guilt trip, they would accept their individual liberties curtailed.&quot;

During an episode of his show &quot;InfoWars&quot; on May 24, 2022, Jones said concerning the Robb Elementary School shooting: &quot;I would predict a lot of mass shootings right before elections and like clockwork, it is happening. To me, it is just very opportunistic what is happening.&quot;

=== Other opinions ===

Jones is a proponent of the New World Order conspiracy theory. In 2009, Jones claimed that a convicted con man&#x27;s scheme to take over a long-vacant, would-be for-profit prison in Hardin, Montana, was part of a Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) plot to detain US citizens in concentration camps, relating to said conspiracy theory. In 2010, Jones produced and directed &quot;Police State 4: The Rise of FEMA&quot;, a film he claimed &quot;conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps&quot; and that &quot;The military-industrial complex is transforming our once free nation into a giant prison camp.&quot; In 2012, Jones linked to a story titled &quot;List of All FEMA Concentration Camps in America Revealed&quot; from the German UFO conspiracy website Disclose.tv.

On June 9, 2013, Jones appeared as a guest on the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Sunday Politics&quot;, discussing conspiracy theories about the Bilderberg Group, with presenter Andrew Neil and journalist David Aaronovitch. Aaronovitch implied that, since Jones had not been killed for exposing conspiracies, they either do not exist or that Jones is a part of them himself. Jones began shouting and interrupting, and Neil ended the interview, describing Jones as &quot;an idiot&quot; and &quot;the worst person I&#x27;ve ever interviewed&quot;. According to Neil on Twitter, Jones was still shouting until he knew that he was off-air.

Jones was in a &quot;media crossfire&quot; in 2011, which included criticism by Rush Limbaugh, when the news spread that Jared Lee Loughner, the perpetrator of the 2011 Tucson shooting, had been &quot;a fan&quot; of the 9/11 conspiracy film &quot;Loose Change&quot; of which Jones had been an executive producer.

&quot;Media Matters&quot; covered his claim that NFL players protesting during the national anthem were &quot;kneeling to white genocide&quot; and violence against whites, which the SPLC featured in their headlines review. His reporting and public views on the topic have received support and coverage from white nationalist publications and groups, such as the AltRight Corporation and the New Zealand National Front.

The Jones film &quot;Endgame: Blueprint for Global Enslavement&quot; features the Georgia Guidestones, a 19-foot-high megalithic granite monument installed in Elberton in 1982, an attraction that drew 20,000 annual visitors. On July 7, 2022, the day they were dynamited by unknown saboteurs, his guest U.S. Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene said ecumenical texts inscribed on it represented a nefarious future of &quot;population control&quot; as envisioned by the &quot;hard left&quot;. She added, &quot;There is a war of good and evil going on, and people are done with globalism.&quot; Jones admitted to enjoying the destruction, &quot;at an animal level&quot;, though he added he would also would have liked them to remain as an &quot;evil edifice&quot; exposing supposed depopulation plans.

Jones has repeatedly made hateful comments towards the LGBT community and has associated the community with pedophilia. In 2010, he claimed: &quot;The reason there&#x27;s so many gay people now is because it&#x27;s a chemical warfare operation, and I have the government documents where they said they&#x27;re going to encourage homosexuality with chemicals so that people don&#x27;t have children.&quot; In a 2013 interview on YouTube concerning same-sex marriage, he ultimately blamed the &quot;globalists&quot; who &quot;want to encourage the breakdown of the family, because the family is where people owe their allegiance&quot; as a means &quot;to get rid of God&quot; by &quot;taking the rights of an ancient, unified program of marriage and... are breaking it&quot;. He has claimed that the government is putting chemicals in water supplies to make people gay. In 2018, Jones threatened to come after drag performers with torches &quot;like the villagers in the night&quot;.

Leaked texts reported on by the SPLC in 2023 indicated that Jones privately held different views about sexuality than what he promoted on &quot;InfoWars&quot;, with Jones and his second wife expressing positive views on bisexuality in their messages.

Jones believes that global warming is a hoax made up by the World Bank to control the world economy through a carbon tax.

&quot;Salon&quot; paraphrased Jones as having claimed President Obama had &quot;access to weather weapons capable of not only creating tornadoes but also moving them around, on demand&quot;. His belief in weather warfare has been reported by mainstream media. He has claimed that Hurricane Irma may have been geo-engineered.

Jones is a proponent of the conspiracy theory that Michelle Obama is transgender, with much of his apparent proof being pictures of Obama where it appears she has a bulge in her pants, and a video clip where Barack Obama refers to somebody as &quot;Michael&quot;. Jones has claimed that the election of Joe Biden is part of a plot by the deep state and the globalists to bring about &quot;the takedown of America&quot;.

In April 2017, Jones was criticized for claiming that the Khan Shaykhun chemical attack was a hoax and false flag. Jones stated that the attack was potentially carried out by civil defense group White Helmets, which he claimed are an Al-Qaeda-affiliated terrorist front financed by George Soros.

While Jones initially supported QAnon, Right Wing Watch reported that he had ceased to support QAnon by May 2018, declaring the source &quot;completely compromised&quot;. In 2021, after the Capitol attack, Jones denounced believers of the QAnon conspiracy theory on &quot;InfoWars&quot;.

Jones is known for both his opposition to vaccines, and his views on vaccine controversies. On June 16, 2017, &quot;Vox&quot; covered his claim that the introduction of the &quot;Sesame Street&quot; character Julia, an autistic Muppet, was &quot;designed to normalize autism, a disorder caused by vaccines&quot;. On November 20, 2017, &quot;The New Yorker&quot; quoted Jones as claiming &quot;InfoWars&quot; was &quot;defending people&#x27;s right to not be forcibly infected with vaccines&quot;. Critics argue that he endangers children &quot;by convincing their parents that vaccines are dangerous&quot;. Jones has specifically disputed the safety and effectiveness of MMR vaccines.

In April 2022, Jones denied Russian war crimes by accusing the Ukrainians of staging the Bucha massacre.

In August 2024, Jones suggested he might relocate to Russia after Vladimir Putin signed a decree offering sanctuary to those who shared traditional values.

===Book project===

On January 23, 2018, Jones announced he would be working with author Neil Strauss on his upcoming book, titled &quot;The Secret History of the Modern World &amp; the War for the Future&quot;.

== Connections to Donald Trump ==
===2016 presidential campaign===
On December 2, 2015, Donald Trump, then a presidential candidate, appeared on &quot;The Alex Jones Show&quot;, with Trump stating to Jones at the end: &quot;your reputation is amazing. I will not let you down. You&#x27;ll be very, very impressed, I hope.&quot; During the broadcast, Jones compared Trump to George Washington and said 90% of his listeners supported his candidacy. Jones and Trump both said the appearance was arranged by Roger Stone, who made multiple appearances on Jones&#x27; program during the 2016 presidential campaign. Ron and Rand Paul were the only other significant politicians to appear on Jones&#x27; show in the preceding few years. Jones indicated his support for Trump during the presidential campaign.

During his 2016 presidential campaign, via his Twitter account, Trump linked to &quot;InfoWars&quot; articles as sources for his claim &quot;thousands and thousands&quot; of Muslims celebrated 9/11 and the false assertion California was not suffering from a drought. A few days before one of Trump&#x27;s August 2016 rallies, &quot;InfoWars&quot; published a video claiming Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton had mental health issues, which Trump recycled in his campaign speech at the rally, according to &quot;Mother Jones&quot;. Trump&#x27;s claim the 2016 vote would be rigged, &quot;The Independent&quot; reported, followed a Jones video making the same claim two days earlier. In one of her own speeches and video ads, Clinton criticized Trump for his ties to Jones.

Jones ran a campaign attacking former president Bill Clinton as a rapist. He designed a T-shirt, ran another &quot;get on MSM&quot; competition and gate-crashed &quot;The Young Turks&quot; set at the RNC, while displaying the T-shirt, resulting in a physical altercation with Cenk Uygur. Jones said Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama were demons because they both smelt of sulfur, a claim supposedly based on assertions from people in contact with them. In late 2015, &quot;InfoWars&quot; began selling T-shirts with the slogan &quot;Hillary for Prison&quot;.

According to Jones, Trump called him on the day after the election to thank him for his help in the campaign.

===Trump as president===
In April 2018, Jones publicly criticized President Trump during a livestream, after Trump announced a military strike against Syria. During the stream, Jones also stated that Trump had not called him during the prior six months. A leaked interview of Jones in January 2019 expressing displeasure over his relationship with Trump was released by the Southern Poverty Law Center in March 2021, with Jones stating &quot;I wish I never would have fucking met Trump... I&#x27;m so sick of fucking Donald Trump, man. God, I&#x27;m fucking sick of him.&quot;

Jones supported Trump during his re-election campaign in 2020 and called on demonstrations to be held on the premise the election had been &quot;rigged&quot; against Trump.

After Trump recommended at an August 2021 rally that people choose to be vaccinated against COVID-19, Jones said that Trump was either lying or &quot;not that bright&quot; and &quot;a dumbass&quot;.

Numerous then-serving and former Trump advisers have appeared on Jones&#x27;s show, including Counselor to the President Steve Bannon, Senior Advisor to the President Stephen Miller, National Security Advisor Michael Flynn, and senior Trump campaign advisers Jason Miller and Roger Stone.

=== Events related to the January 6 Capitol attack ===
Jones partially funded and raised other funds to finance the January 6 Trump rally in Washington, D.C., that preceded the 2021 United States Capitol attack. &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported he assisted in raising at least $650,000 from Julie Fancelli, a Publix grocery chain heiress who is a follower of &quot;InfoWars&quot;, to finance Trump&#x27;s rally on the Ellipse, including $200,000 of the total amount deposited in one of Jones&#x27; bank accounts.

Jones attended the January 5 and 6 rallies at the capitol. On January 5, he was a scheduled speaker at the March to Save America and said, &quot;We have only begun to resist the globalists. We have only begun our fight against their tyranny. They have tried to steal this election in front of everyone.&quot; Jones also stated that &quot;I don&#x27;t know how this is all going to end, but if they want to fight, they better believe they&#x27;ve got one&quot;, according to the same video. Jones called Joe Biden a &quot;slave of Satan&quot; and said, &quot;Whatever happens to President Trump in 15 days, he is still the elected president of this republic. And we do not recognize the Communist Chinese agent Joe Biden, or his controllers.&quot;

The next day, Wednesday, January 6, at a gathering in Lafayette Park north of the Capitol, he addressed the crowd with a bullhorn, and stated that he had seen &quot;over a hundred&quot; members of antifa in the crowd, a baseless assertion other Trump supporters had also made, although the FBI said there was no evidence of antifa involvement. The same day, a video of Jones was posted on &quot;InfoWars&quot;, in which he is recorded saying &quot;We declare 1776 against the new world order... We need to understand we&#x27;re under attack, and we need to understand this is 21st-century warfare and get on a war-footing&quot;. In the same video, before setting off toward the Capitol building, Jones told the crowd: &quot;We&#x27;re here to take our rightful country back peacefully, because we&#x27;re not globalist, antifa criminals. So let&#x27;s start marching, and I salute you all.&quot; When rioters attacked the Capitol, Jones called on them to stop. &quot;Let&#x27;s not fight the police and give the system what they want&quot;, he said.

In February 2021, &quot;The Washington Post&quot; reported that the FBI was investigating any role Jones might have played in influencing the participation of Proud Boys and Oath Keepers in the incursion. Jones had previously hosted leaders of the two groups on his programs. Some members of the groups had been indicted for conspiracy in the incident.

On November 22, 2021, the House Select Committee on the January 6 Attack subpoenaed Jones for testimony and documents by December 18 and 6, respectively. He had a virtual meeting with the committee by video link on January 24, 2022. By the estimate of his legal team, Jones said, he pleaded the Fifth Amendment 100 times and had been instructed to do so by his counsel.

On August 5, 2022, during a defamation trial in Texas brought by Sandy Hook school shooting parents against Jones, a lawyer for the plaintiffs revealed that Jones&#x27; lawyer had inadvertently sent him two years of texts from Jones&#x27; phone. On August 8, the House select committee investigating the January 6 attack received those text messages; they had requested the information since Jones had helped organize a rally before the Capitol attack. Jones&#x27;s lawyer, Norm Pattis, had also released confidential discovery items including Sandy Hook plaintiffs&#x27; medical records, and consequently, in January 2023, a judge suspended his law license. At the time of his license suspension, Pattis was part of the legal team defending Proud Boys leader Joseph Biggs against charges of seditious conspiracy.

On September 12, 2023, Owen Shroyer, an &quot;InfoWars&quot; co-host who accompanied Jones to the capital on January 6, 2021, was sentenced to thirty days in prison for violating an active order to stay away from the Capitol grounds. He had received the order after previously being arrested for causing a disturbance in another governmental building.

== Litigation ==
=== Pizzagate conspiracy theory ===
In February 2017, James Alefantis, owner of Comet Ping Pong pizzeria, sent Jones a letter demanding an apology and retraction of his advocacy for the Pizzagate conspiracy theory. Jones was given one month to comply or be subject to a libel suit. In March 2017, Jones apologized to Alefantis and retracted his allegations.

=== Chobani yogurt company ===
In April 2017, the Chobani yogurt company sued Jones over his allegations that their Idaho plant was involved in several tuberculosis cases, and a sexual assault taking place the year prior. As a result, Jones issued an apology and retraction of his allegations in May 2017. However, while being deposed in the Texas defamation lawsuit filed by Sandy Hook parents, Jones reiterated many of his previous allegations against Chobani and its founder, Hamdi Ulukaya, indicating that he continues to espouse the false claims.

=== Charlottesville car attack ===
In March 2018, Brennan Gilmore, who shared a video he captured of a car hitting counter-protesters at the 2017 Unite the Right rally, filed a lawsuit against Jones and six others. According to the lawsuit, Jones said that Gilmore was acting as part of a false flag operation conducted by disgruntled government &quot;deep state&quot; employees promoting a coup against Trump. Gilmore alleged he received death threats from Jones&#x27;s audience. In March 2022, Gilmore secured an admission of liability from Jones.

=== Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting ===

Jones has repeatedly spread disproven conspiracy theories about the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, including claiming that it was a &quot;false flag&quot; operation perpetrated by gun control advocates, that &quot;no one died&quot; in Sandy Hook, and that the incident was &quot;staged&quot;, &quot;synthetic&quot;, &quot;manufactured&quot;, &quot;a giant hoax&quot; and &quot;completely fake with actors&quot;. Jones faced numerous defamation lawsuits due to these lies.

====&quot;Pozner and De La Rosa vs. Jones&quot;====
On April 16, 2018 Leonard Pozner and Veronique De La Rosa, parents of victim Noah Pozner, filed a defamation suit against Jones, Infowars and Free Speech Systems in Travis County, Texas. Pozner, who has been forced to move several times to avoid harassment and death threats, was accused by Jones of being a crisis actor.

====&quot;Heslin vs. Jones&quot;====
On April 16, 2018, Neil Heslin and Scarlett Lewis, parents of victim Jesse Lewis, filed a defamation suit against Jones, Infowars and Free Speech Systems in Travis County, Texas.

Jones was found to be in contempt of court even before the trial started as a result of his failure to produce witnesses and materials relevant to the procedures. Consequently, Jones and &quot;Infowars&quot; were fined a total of $126,000 in October and December 2019.

On January 22, 2021, the Texas Supreme Court threw out an appeal for dismissal by Jones of four defamation lawsuits from families of Sandy Hook victims. The court allowed the judgments of two lower courts to stand without comment, allowing the lawsuits to continue.

On September 27, 2021, a district judge in Texas issued three default judgments against Jones, requiring him to pay all damages in two lawsuits. These rulings came after Jones repeatedly failed to hand over documents and evidence as ordered by the court, which the judge characterized as &quot;flagrant bad faith and callous disregard for the responsibilities of discovery under the rules&quot;.

The jury trial began in Texas on July 25, 2022, where the plaintiffs&#x27; attorney said they would seek $150 million from the jury. Heslin testified on August 2 that conspiracy theorists, fueled by Jones&#x27; statements, fired into his house and car and subjected him and his family to harassment. He said Jones&#x27; failure to attend court during his testimony was a &quot;cowardly act&quot;. While Heslin was testifying, Jones was broadcasting his show, calling Heslin &quot;slow&quot; and &quot;manipulated by some very bad people&quot;. Jones subsequently arrived at court to present his testimony, first sitting through that of Jesse&#x27;s mother Scarlett Lewis. Lewis said, &quot;Alex, I want you to hear this. We&#x27;re more polarized than ever as a country. Some of that is because of you.&quot; She asked Jones: &quot;Do you think I&#x27;m an actor?&quot; Jones responded, &quot;No, I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;re an actor.&quot; As the only person testifying in his defense, Jones admitted the Sandy Hook shooting was &quot;100% real&quot;, and agreed with his own attorney that it was &quot;absolutely irresponsible&quot; to push falsehoods about the shooting and its victims.

Jones testified that he had complied with court orders in defamation suits and is bankrupt. On August 3, cross-examination revealed that Jones had not fully complied with court orders to provide text messages and emails for pretrial evidence gathering. Judge Maya Guerra Gamble of Travis County District Court admonished him for lying under oath, as his failure to comply with court orders was the reason he lost the defamation suits, and that bankruptcy proceedings had yet to be adjudicated. Gamble said, &quot;You&#x27;re under oath. That means things must actually be true when you say them.&quot; After the judge left the courtroom, Jones said Lewis and Heslin were being &quot;controlled&quot;. While the jury deliberated the amount of compensatory damages, Jones was claiming on his radio show that the proceedings were &quot;an incredible spectacle&quot; backed by globalists trying to shut him down. On August 4, 2022, the jury ordered Jones pay Heslin and Lewis $4.1 million in compensatory damages, and the following day, he was ordered to pay an additional $45.2 million in punitive damages. On November 22, 2022, a judge ruled that Jones must pay the full amount of the punitive damages, even though this amount exceeds a cap under Texas law. (Jones&#x27; attorneys had estimated the punitive damages award would be reduced to $1.5 million, while the plaintiffs&#x27; attorneys had expected it to be reduced to $4.5 million.)

On November 22, 2022, Judge Gamble ruled that the punitive damages cap did not apply in this case due to the rare and egregious nature of the harm. She also questioned the constitutionality of the damages cap in general.

On April 25, 2023, Judge Gamble ordered Jones&#x27;s attorney, Andino Reynal, to pay $97,169 to Heslin and Lewis for his bad-faith attempts to delay the trial, with a contingency fee of $55,000 should Reynal appeal and lose, and $61,600 if he appeals to the Texas Supreme Court and loses.

====&quot;Lafferty et al. vs. Jones&quot;====
On June 26, 2018, seven families of victims and an FBI agent who responded to the attack filed a defamation lawsuit in Connecticut Superior Court against Jones, Infowars, Free Speech Systems, Infowars Health and others for spreading false claims, resulting in the harassment, stalking and threatening of the plaintiffs.

By February 2019, the plaintiffs won a series of court rulings requiring Jones to testify under oath. Jones was later ordered to undergo a sworn deposition, along with three other defendants related to the operation of Infowars. He was also ordered to turn over internal business documents related to Infowars. In this deposition in the last week of March 2019, Jones acknowledged the deaths were real, stating he had &quot;almost like a form of psychosis&quot;, where he &quot;basically thought everything was staged&quot;.

On March 25, 2019, Jeremy Richman, one of the plaintiffs, whose daughter Avielle was killed, committed suicide. Jones, through his lawyer, offered condolences to Richman&#x27;s family, but later that day on his show suggested that Richman had been murdered and that his death had something to do with special counsel Robert Mueller&#x27;s investigation into Russian election interference.

On April 5, 2021, the Supreme Court of the United States declined to hear an appeal by Jones against a court sanction in the lawsuit.

On November 15, 2021, the judge found Jones liable by default for defamation, for &quot;willful non-compliance&quot; in failing to turn over documents to the families in line with court orders.

On March 29, 2022, Jones offered a settlement of $120,000 to each of the thirteen people involved in the lawsuits, which was quickly rejected.

On June 2, 2022, Jones&#x27;s attorneys asked the judge to drop them from the case. The judge said she had heard this before, citing thirteen times in the past four years when Jones&#x27; attorneys asked to replace each other or be dropped from the case. She ordered them to continue to represent Jones until she ruled on the motion on June 15.

On October 12, 2022, the jury awarded $965 million to be shared by 15 plaintiffs (eight families and one first responder). The plaintiffs&#x27; individual awards ranged from $28.8 million to $120 million. During the trial, the families testified that they had been threatened and harassed over years due to Jones&#x27; falsehoods. Jones reacted live to the verdict on his show, mocking it: &quot;Do these people actually think they&#x27;re getting any money?&quot; He implored his viewers to donate to him to &quot;appeal&quot;, and also declared that the jury&#x27;s verdict was an attempt to &quot;scare us away from questioning&quot; school shootings such as the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting and the Robb Elementary School shooting, but &quot;we&#x27;re not going to stop&quot;.

On November 10, 2022, the judge awarded the plaintiffs a further $473 million in punitive damages in the form of lawyers&#x27; fees, bringing the total to over $1.4 billion. The judge also issued an order that Jones was &quot;not to transfer, encumber, dispose or move his assets out of the United States until further order of the court&quot;.

Jones moved for a new trial, but on December 22, 2022, the judge denied his request.

By the end of the summer of 2023, Jones had paid nothing to the families.

On December 6, 2024, the Connecticut Appellate Court reduced the total Jones owed to about $1.2 billion. It did this by affirming the jury&#x27;s $965 million verdict while saying that Jones would not have to pay the $150 million in punitive damages that the lower court had awarded the plaintiffs.

====&quot;Sherlach vs. Jones&quot;====
On July 24, 2018, William Sherlach, husband of victim and school psychologist Mary Sherlach, filed a defamation lawsuit in Connecticut Superior Court against Jones, Infowars, Free Speech Systems and Infowars Health. Sherlach&#x27;s lawsuit was consolidated into the &quot;Lafferty et al. vs. Jones&quot; lawsuit for the Connecticut trial.

====Attempts to protect assets====
Numerous media sources have raised questions on how much Jones really owns and hides in assets.

On April 6, 2022, according to the Associated Press and &quot;The Daily Beast&quot;, a lawsuit was filed in Austin, Texas, by some of the Sandy Hook families accusing Jones of hiding assets worth millions of dollars after he began being sued for defamation by the families of Sandy Hook victims. The suit claims Jones &quot;conspired to divert his assets to shell companies owned by insiders like his parents, his children, and himself&quot;. The lawsuit alleges Jones drew $18 million from the Infowars company beginning in 2018 and accuses Jones of claiming a &quot;dubious&quot; $54 million debt at about the same time to another company alleged by the lawsuit to be also owned by Jones. Norm Pattis, an attorney for Jones, said the lawsuit was &quot;ridiculous&quot; and denied that there had been any attempt to conceal assets.

====Bankruptcies====
On April 17, 2022, three companies owned by Jones filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Texas, suspending further civil litigation claims, as the families had sued Jones as well as his companies. The three companies affected were InfoW, Prison Planet TV, and IWHealth (or Infowars Health). The court filings estimated &quot;InfoWars&quot;″ assets at between $0–$50,000, but its liabilities (including from the damages awarded against Jones in defamation suits) were stated as being between $1 million and $10 million. Regarding why Jones did not personally file for bankruptcy, his representative stated, &quot;It would ruin his name and harm his ability to sell merchandise.&quot; and &quot;Putting him in bankruptcy would harm his trademark value in terms of cashflow.&quot; A lawyer for the families involved in a Connecticut lawsuit against Jones responded, &quot;Alex Jones is just delaying the inevitable: a public trial in which he will be held accountable for his profit-driven campaign of lies against the Sandy Hook families who have brought this lawsuit.&quot;

On June 10, 2022, a federal judge in Texas dismissed the bankruptcy protection case after Jones and the families agreed that the three companies would be dropped from the defamation lawsuits against Jones, allowing them to continue in Texas and Connecticut. On July 29, 2022, the parent company of &quot;InfoWars&quot;, Free Speech Systems, LLC, filed for bankruptcy. In response to the Connecticut legal settlement made against him, Jones had previously claimed assets of $6.2 million in January 2022.

On December 2, 2022, Jones filed for Chapter 11 personal bankruptcy in the Southern District of Texas, claiming that his assets were between $1 million and $10 million, while his debts were between $1 billion and $10 billion. He also claimed that he had 50 to 99 creditors, and in February 2023, that the Department of Justice intended to seize his pet cat, valued at $2,000, to pay debts owed to the Sandy Hook families. On October 19, 2023, a Texas bankruptcy judge ruled that Jones cannot rely on bankruptcy protection to avoid paying the $1.5 billion he owes to the Sandy Hook families as a result of the Connecticut lawsuit. It remained unclear whether he would be able to reduce the amount of punitive damages in the Texas case.

In November 2023, the Sandy Hook families offered a settlement in which Jones would pay $85 million over 10 years (about 6 percent of what he had been court-ordered to pay). The offer was filed within Jones&#x27;s personal bankruptcy case. The following month, Jones countered with an offer of $55 million over 10 years. In February 2024, Jones&#x27;s general unsecured creditors (mostly Sandy Hook families) voted in favor of a Chapter 11 plan that would liquidate and redistribute his assets.

Appearing emotional and defiant, on June 1, 2024, Jones said on his program, &quot;At the end of the day, we&#x27;re going to beat these people. I&#x27;m not trying to be dramatic here, but it&#x27;s been a hard fight. These people hate our children.&quot; The next day, the families filed an emergency motion in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Houston, asking the judge to liquidate Alex Jones&#x27;s company rather than allow him to reorganize it. The court filing said Jones has &quot;failed to demonstrate any hope of beginning to satisfy&quot; their claims. On June 6, Jones&#x27;s attorneys filed a motion to convert his bankruptcy to Chapter 7 status, which would lead to liquidation of his personal assets, including his stake in &quot;InfoWars&quot;, which was agreed to by the plaintiffs the following day. On June 14, the judge approved the Chapter 7 liquidation. On June 24, the court-appointed trustee public revealed that he planned to shut down &quot;InfoWars&quot;. On September 24, the judge approved the sale of Free Speech Systems, the parent company of &quot;InfoWars&quot;.

The auction was scheduled for November 13.

=== Stoneman Douglas High School shooting ===
Jones spread discredited conspiracy theories about the 2018 Parkland high school shooting. He stated survivor David Hogg was a crisis actor.

Marcel Fontaine sued Jones on April 2, 2018, after &quot;InfoWars&quot; falsely identified him as the gunman and posted photos of him in several versions of an article on the &quot;InfoWars&quot; website about the massacre. The lawsuit was filed in Texas court naming Jones, &quot;InfoWars&quot;, parent company Free Speech Systems, LLC and &quot;Infowars&quot; employee Kit Daniels as defendants. Fontaine&#x27;s lawsuit was the first one against Jones that involved his defamatory statements about mass school shootings. One of his lawyers stated that &quot;Marcel Fontaine is the only reason why we filed the first Sandy Hook case&quot;, because after Fontaine&#x27;s suit was filed, the families of two boys slain in the Sandy Hook shooting contacted his law firm about also suing Jones. Fontaine died in an apartment building fire in Worcester, Massachusetts, on May 14, 2022.

== Personal life ==
Jones has three children with his former wife Kelly Jones (née Nichols). The couple divorced in March 2015. In 2017, Kelly sought sole or joint custody of their children due to her ex-husband&#x27;s behavior. She asserted that &quot;he&#x27;s not a stable person&quot; and she was &quot;concerned that he is engaged in felonious behavior, threatening a member of Congress [Adam Schiff].&quot; His attorney responded by claiming that &quot;he&#x27;s playing a character&quot; and describing him as a &quot;performance artist&quot;. On his show, Jones denied playing a character and he called his show &quot;the most bona fide, hard-core, real McCoy thing there is, and everybody knows it&quot;; whereas in court, Jones clarified that he generally agreed with his attorney&#x27;s statement, but that he disagreed with the media&#x27;s interpretation of the term &quot;performance artist&quot;. Kelly was awarded the right to decide where their children live while he maintains visitation rights. In April 2020, a state district judge denied an emergency motion by Kelly to secure custody of their daughters for the next two weeks after Jones led a rally at the Capitol, where he was mobbed by supporters and called COVID-19 a hoax. In 2023, after a 2008 audioclip of Jones berating his then wife was obtained by the &quot;Daily Mail&quot;, Kelly claimed that Jones was &quot;a total racist&quot; regarding her Jewish heritage, claiming that her genes were &quot;flawed.&quot;

His son, Rex Jones, has worked for &quot;InfoWars&quot;. His father, David Jones, is involved in &quot;InfoWars&quot;&#x27;s business, and previously handled human resources tasks for his son, according to his testimony in a deposition.

Jones married Erika Wulff in 2017; they have one child. In February 2023, the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) reported on text messages that appeared to corroborate a September 2022 &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; story reporting that Jones may have spied on Wulff in 2019. In the texts reviewed by the SPLC, Jones told his security employee to monitor Wulff, expressing concern that she was cheating on him.

<text>The red-footed falcon (Falco vespertinus), formerly the western red-footed falcon, is a bird of prey. It belongs to the family Falconidae, the falcons. This bird is found in eastern Europe and Asia although its numbers are dwindling rapidly due to habitat loss and hunting. It is migratory, wintering in Africa. It is a regular wanderer to western Europe, and in August 2004 a red-footed falcon was found in North America for the first time on the island of Martha&#x27;s Vineyard, Massachusetts.

==Taxonomy==
The Amur falcon was formerly included herein as a subspecies but it is nowadays considered distinct. Nonetheless, it is the present species&#x27; closest relative; their relationship to other falcons is more enigmatic. They appear morphologically somewhat intermediate between kestrels and hobbies and DNA sequence data has been unable to further resolve this question, mainly due to lack of comprehensive sampling. They might be closer to the merlin than to most other living falcons, or more generally related to this species and American falcons such as the American kestrel and the aplomado falcon.

The genus name &quot;Falco&quot; is from Late Latin &quot;falx&quot;, &quot;falcis&quot;, a sickle, referencing the claws of the bird. The species name &quot;vespertinus&quot; is Latin for &quot;of evening&quot; from &quot;vesper&quot;, &quot;evening&quot;.

==Description==
It is a medium-small, long-winged species. The adult male is all blue-grey, except for his red undertail and legs; its underwings are uniformly grey. The female has a grey back and wings, orange head and underparts, and a white face with black eye stripe and moustaches.

Young birds are brown above and buff below with dark streaks, and a face pattern like the female. Red-footed falcons are in length with a wingspan of . The average mass is .

==Distribution==
The main areas of European distribution are in southern Russia and Ukraine. The species occurs in large numbers in Hungary, Romania and Serbia. Smaller populations exist in Italy, Bulgaria and Moldova, in Austria, Slovakia and in Belarus. The red-footed falcon also breeds irregularly in the Czech Republic and in the Baltic States, occasionally also in Germany. In Asia, the breeding occurrences run in a relatively narrow band somewhat south of the taiga eastwards to the upper Lena, where they touch the range of the sister species &quot;Falco amurensis&quot; east of the Baikal. The northern border lies between the 63° and 58° north latitude, the south border around 45° north latitude. It runs along the north slope of the Altai and then westward follows the transition of open pine forests into the treeless steppe areas of Central Asia. Further to the west, the breeding areas on the lower reaches of the Volga and on the north coast of the Caspian Sea reach Europe. The southernmost occurrences are in the steppe areas north of the Caucasus and in South Georgia. Some isolated breeding areas are located in northern Turkey. The red-footed falcon winters in southern and eastern Africa.

==Breeding and behaviour==
This falcon is a colonial breeder, reusing the old nests of corvids, such as rooks. It lays two to four eggs. Its maximum lifespan is 13.25 years in the wild and 18 years in captivity.

===Azerbaijan===
Red-footed falcons were witnessed copulating several times over a week-long period and &quot;showed a strong preference for an old magpie nest&quot; Frequent copulation was interspersed with joint inspections of the magpie nest. The morning after the aforementioned observations, the pair was again observed and they repeated their behaviour. Both then defended against an attack by a lesser kestrel. On this day neither bird spent much time in the nest, but always remained perched beside it. At the end of the week the researchers revisited the nest. The behaviour this time was that the female sat in the nest and the male perched outside but in the same tree. Further defensive responses to lesser kestrels were observed. The male red-footed falcon hunted for large insects and fed them to the female. Copulation then occurred. After copulation, the female returned to sit in the nest until the male fed her again. This behaviour continued for several days. This pair clearly showed territorial behaviour. The frequent copulations and lengthy stay of the female in the nest suggested incubation but the researchers did not check the nest.

===Carpathian Basin===
Researchers used a species distribution model for red-footed falcons. This model can play a crucial role in identifying key nesting sites for endangered species. According to the researchers, the red-footed falcon is officially listed as near-threatened, due to the drastic breeding population decline of the past decades. Red-footed falcons breed in colonies and in solitary pairs. They do not build a nest. In Hungary, the landscape scale distribution of rookeries remained stable, while the density and size of rookeries decreased and their location shifted to human settlements. Similar patterns were reported from other European countries. The reasons of rookery declines can be attributed to a large-scale persecution in the mid-80s resulting in a 90% population crash. Because of this, most potential breeding colonies for red-footed falcons disappeared, causing a decline in the number of breeding pairs. Conservation projects have established artificial nest box colonies to rectify this problem.

There is little evidence of this plan&#x27;s effectiveness and also little evidence on recent population trends and distribution, from Northern Serbia, where 5–10% of the total European Union population is thought to breed. The researchers&#x27; main focus was on understanding the relationship between landscape scale habitat variables and red-footed falcon presence. The researchers found that the increase of natural grasslands had a positive effect on nest site presence while the increase of broad-leaved forests negatively influenced the probability of nest site presence. Their modelling approach proved successful in describing the landscape scale habitat composition of red-footed falcon breeding sites in the modelling area. Natural grasslands have a considerable impact on the probability of nest site presence. Therefore, locating their breeding sites or creating breeding sites by providing artificial colonies with the aid of our results has additional conservation and socio-economic benefits for wildlife and human population.

===Serbia===
Near the village of Melenci (Vojvodina, northern Serbia) there were 22 red-footed falcon nests in 1991 in which offspring had been successfully brought up. The contents of four nests were checked daily from the start of incubation until the fledglings left the nests. Breeding success did not differ between the group of four nests disturbed by inspections and the remaining 18. Despite the fact that the ratio of parent bird presence (both, only female, only male) and absence differed in the comparison of the four nests, red-footed falcon parents were usually found in the close surroundings, i.e. they attended their nest. The attendance of the birds to the nests differed between the sexes during incubation as well as hatching and the nestling period, which fact can be interpreted as a difference between the roles of females and males. In 59% of the cases it was the female, while in 41% it was the male bird that was sitting on the eggs. At the time of hatching it was mostly the female (female 86%, male 14%) that was present in the nest, while after hatching it was only the female. Later on the adult birds usually took off from the branch supporting the nest, from neighbouring trees, or from abandoned rook (&quot;Corvus frugilegus&quot;) nests, rather than from the nest itself. Females participated more times in the defence of the nest than males, yet the ratios of the studied types of behaviour (alarm, repellence, attack) did not differ between the sexes. However, significant difference appeared to be present between four nests when the distribution frequency of the three behaviour types was looked at. The distribution of the reaction types of the parent birds to disturbance was significantly different in the periods of incubation, hatching and nestling, respectively. As nesting proceeded and parental investment grew, the number of repellences and attacks increased proportionally.

The survey of population size and distribution of red-footed falcons proceeded in June–July 2000 and 2001 respectively, ten years after the first census (1990 and 1991). Data of only those nests were processed in which there was breeding. Breeding Success was calculated from the number of offspring per reproductive female. During the survey in Voivodina in 1990–1991 there were 308 and 124 pairs, respectively, whereas ten years later, in the year 2000 there were 116, and in 2001 only 61 pairs of red-footed falcons. Even if the marked fluctuations observed are not considered, the red-footed falcon population breeding in Voivodina shows a declining tendency. The south-western margin of the distribution area has moved towards the northeast by about 50–70 kilometres. More than 90% of the nesting sites, including the larger nesting colonies, are found in the Banat region, i.e. east of the Tisa River. More than 90% of the red-footed falcons continue to nest in rook colonies. No significant change has occurred in their breeding success.

==Dietary habits==
The red-footed falcon is a bird of prey with a diet consisting of a variety of insects, amphibians, reptiles, mammals and birds, such as great green bush-crickets, spadefoot toads, sand lizards, the common vole and bird nestlings, respectively. This bird&#x27;s distinctive method of hunting is shared by the common kestrel. It regularly hovers, searching the ground below, then makes a short steep dive towards the target. When feeding their nestlings, the youngest nestlings receive the most food more frequently and more regularly. Chicks that are between 0 and 3 weeks old will get fed bigger prey like toads, lizards, bird nestlings, and great green bush-crickets, while nestlings over that age will get fed less frequently and with less variety. The diet of young nestlings consists mostly of Orthoptera and beetles with some vertebrates, while the diet of older nestlings mostly consists of Orthoptera and almost never of vertebrates.

==Habitat==

The red-footed falcon tends to reside in typical steppe type habitats ranging from Eastern Europe to Lake Baikal in Central Asia. This is a diurnal bird of open country with some trees, often near water. They tend to migrate far south for the winter, including in areas of Africa. The red-footed falcon tends not to make their own nests, but tend to use abandoned nests made by other birds such as the hooded crow, rook, and magpie. The nests that are chosen tend to be higher than the majority of the other nests; the nests tend to be above the ground and within of the tree top. Most of these nests tend to be near the edge of woods, avoiding nesting on solitary trees. Breeding takes place in these abandoned nests; usually breeding occurs colonially in rookeries because these birds tend to stay together in groups. This is also important because fledging success tends to be higher when these birds are in colonies and are not solitary. The red-footed falcon relies on the nests built by rooks, and with a decline in population of rooks, the number of suitable rookeries for colonial nesting has also decreased, leading humans to ideas of conservation.

==Threats==
A major impact on the red footed falcon&#x27;s population is loss and degradation of natural nest sites. Rooks and rookeries are regularly attacked, by shooting into the nests, killing birds and cutting down the trees they were living in for the wood. Pesticides are also a huge threat as they are depleting their natural food sources, making food competitive. There is also an increased mortality caused by electrocution due to the bird&#x27;s habit of sitting perched on power lines. From 1980 to 1999 intensive poisoning of rooks in Hungary forced the species to change its nest site selection habits, and large colonies have nearly disappeared there as a result, with only 38% of the population breeding colonially. As productivity is generally greater in larger colonies, further decreases may occur. The species appears to be hunted opportunistically during migration.

==Conservation==
The global population of red-footed falcon is estimated to be between 300,000-800,000 individuals, with 26,000 to 39,000 pairs in Europe. Most of the population breeds in the steppe grasslands of Russia and central Asia, although a significant amount also breeds in Ukraine, Romania and Hungary. In 2005, the population in Hungary was estimated to be between 700 and 800, showing a steady decline. Red-footed falcons can be considered as a classic umbrella species because they affect other species living in the community. They play a popular role in the Natura 2000 designation process. Therefore, locating their breeding sites or creating breeding sites by providing artificial colonies has additional conservation and socio-economic benefits for both wildlife and the local human population.

===Conservation in the Pannonian Region===
A conservation program, which was funded by the EU&#x27;s LIFE Nature financial instrument, was initiated on January 1, 2006 with the goal of increasing and maintaining the breeding population of the species in Hungary and western Romania. This conservation project developed a method to create more nesting sites by creating artificial nest box colonies. It&#x27;s pretty common for the birds to be preyed upon by martens or other mammalian predators during incubation or during the nestling state, even in the artificial colonies. Some extreme cases show that the predators may threaten the existence of every clutch in the colony. They are using many methods to repel or trap potential predators in order to avoid predation. Some of those methods are listed in this section. There are many known threatening factors and the program takes active conservation measures against them. Some of these factors include being electrocuted by electric pylons so the program locates and insulates the exposed cables. Roadside trees are a common nesting site for falcons because they are also home to corvids. Previously, only safety aspects were considered in the management of these nesting facilities. Therefore, the project will submit a conservation based management plan to the correct authorities. One of the reasons of red-footed falcon decline is the collapse of the rook population due to drastic pest control measures. Based on previous experience and information from stakeholders, a draft &quot;corvus management plan&quot; will be prepared to handle the conflict situations caused by rooks.

Future conservation efforts proposed include continuing to conduct regular surveys throughout the area. Figuring out additional ways to help the species is crucial. Red-footed falcons are known to use artificial colonies, therefore, they can be a useful mid-term conservation tool to prevent their population from fragmenting. Also, there may be ways to help out the species by changing farming and land-use practices in Central Europe. Surveys in Bulgaria indicated that there is a decline in available breeding sites for the birds.

<text>Sir Michael John Cullen (5 February 1945 – 19 August 2021) was a New Zealand politician. He was a Member of the New Zealand House of Representatives from 1981 to 2009, the Deputy Leader of the New Zealand Labour Party from 1996 to 2008 and a senior minister in the Fifth Labour Government from 1999 to 2008, serving as Deputy Prime Minister, Minister of Finance, and Attorney-General.

Cullen was first elected in 1981 as the Member of Parliament for St Kilda after a ten-year career as a history lecturer at the University of Otago. He was a junior minister in the second term of the Fourth Labour Government, where his appointments as Minister of Social Welfare and Associate Minister of Finance were intended by Prime Minister David Lange to temper the government&#x27;s economic reforms known as Rogernomics. When Helen Clark became Labour&#x27;s leader in opposition from 1993, Cullen became the Labour Party&#x27;s finance spokesperson. Later, he became Clark&#x27;s deputy leader and served as her deputy prime minister from 2002 to 2008.

In his post-parliamentary career, Cullen was involved in public governance as the chair of New Zealand Post and the Earthquake Commission. He co-led a review of the intelligence and security sector with Dame Patsy Reddy for the Fifth National Government and chaired the Sixth Labour Government&#x27;s Tax Working Group. In 2020, Cullen retired from public life after revealing he had been diagnosed with stage 4 small-cell lung cancer, which had also spread to his liver. He died of cancer the following year.

==Early life and education==
Cullen was born in Enfield in north London on 5 February 1945, the son of Ivy May Cullen (née Taylor) and John Joseph Thomas Cullen. His father was a spectacle frame maker and his mother was a secretary. 

He attended West Green and later North Harringay schools (both in Harringay) the latter of which was close to his maternal grandparents house. When his paternal grandmother died in 1953 his family received a modest inheritance and considered moving to a better house elsewhere in London before instead deciding to move to New Zealand. 

The family emigrated from Tottenham to New Zealand in 1955, where friends gave him the nick-name &quot;Pom&quot;, and Cullen attended secondary school on a scholarship at Christ&#x27;s College in Christchurch. He went on to study history at the University of Canterbury, earning a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1965, and a Master of Arts in 1968. His masters thesis was titled &quot;Poverty in London, 1885-95&quot;. 

Receiving a Commonwealth Scholarship he then gained a PhD in social and economic history from the University of Edinburgh. He was the first person in his family to attend university. From 1971 to 1981 he was a lecturer at the University of Otago, with a term as a visiting fellow at the Australian National University from 1975 to 1976. One of his students was future MP Michael Laws, whom he called a &quot;very bright student, but you knew there was something not quite right, even then.&quot;

Whilst Cullen was researching his thesis on poverty in the late 19th century in London he discovered that the street in which his maternal grandparents grew up was famed for semi-criminal activities. They proceeded to become &quot;working class respectables&quot; and then his father became a semi-skilled tradesman.

Cullen became a naturalised New Zealand citizen in 1975.

==Member of Parliament==




Cullen joined the Labour Party in 1974, and served on the party&#x27;s Executive and Council between 1976 and 1981. At the 1981 general election he was elected MP for the Dunedin electorate of St Kilda. In 1983 he was appointed Labour&#x27;s spokesperson for the environment. In his first several years in parliament he had deliberately avoided his previous career focuses (of welfare and finance) to avoid being &quot;pigeonholed&quot; in those areas.

===Fourth Labour Government===

When Labour entered government in 1984, Cullen became Senior Whip. Due to his knowledge of economics, Cullen became increasingly involved in the disputes surrounding the Minister of Finance, Roger Douglas, who supported the liberalisation of trade and the sale of state assets plus deep tax cuts. These goals, which were against traditional Labour policies, angered both party members and the public. When the Prime Minister, David Lange, attempted to limit the influence Douglas had on the government&#x27;s direction, Cullen became involved on Lange&#x27;s side. After Labour&#x27;s re-election in 1987, Cullen was made Associate Minister of Finance (an attempt by Lange to provide an anti-reform counterbalance to the radical Douglas) and Minister of Social Welfare. There were two other associate finance ministers (David Butcher and Peter Neilson) both of whom were on side with Douglas&#x27; reforms so Cullen&#x27;s ability to temper financial policies were minimal. Of the three he was the more senior and deputised for Douglas when he was unable to attend parliamentary sessions.

He implemented the Puao-te-Ata-tu report which reorganised the administration of welfare provisions in relation to Māori and passed the Children, Young Persons, and Their Families Act. Soon after Cullen had been elevated to Cabinet, his father died following a long and painful illness, his marriage ended, and his dog died prompting him to ponder resigning; &quot;I seriously considered quitting from Cabinet, but the least I could do was stay there for Helen [Clark] and David [Lange] and make sure we didn&#x27;t lose social policy to the Rogernomes who were driving so much of the policy.&quot;

Eventually, Douglas was forced to resign, but a month later the political controversies around the dispute prompted the resignation of Lange himself. Douglas was succeeded as Finance Minister by David Caygill, one of his allies (albeit a considerably less radical one). Cullen was made Associate Minister of Health, in an attempt reduce the effect of reforms on that sector.

In 1989 he married fellow Labour MP Anne Collins.

===Opposition===
When Labour lost the 1990 election – attributed to public anger at Douglas&#x27; reforms, and disarray within the Labour Party – Cullen returned to being Labour&#x27;s spokesperson on social welfare. The following year he replaced David Caygill as Shadow Minister of Finance, Cullen being seen as more fiscally moderate to help blunt the growth of the newly formed Alliance party (which was made up largely of Labour dissidents). After Labour&#x27;s narrow defeat at the 1993 election, Helen Clark won the leadership of the party. At the same time Cullen ran to replace her as deputy leader, but was defeated by Caygill by the narrow margin of 23 votes to 21.

Before Labour&#x27;s position in the polls improved, Cullen was also involved in an attempt to oust Clark as party leader, which was not successful. Soon after, when Caygill decided to retire from politics in 1996, Cullen took the deputy leader&#x27;s post unopposed as well. Cullen has claimed to be happy with his position as second, saying that in terms of personality, he is &quot;a number two sort of person&quot;. Many commentators agree, believing that Cullen&#x27;s strength lies more in administration than leadership.

On 26 August 1999, Cullen was named by the Speaker Doug Kidd for saying that the National Member Max Bradford had lied, and that he was a &quot;stooge&quot; of the Employers Federation.

===Fifth Labour Government===
Prior to the 1999 New Zealand general election, Cullen and his family moved to Napier, prompting him to stand down as Labour&#x27;s candidate in his Dunedin South electorate at the upcoming election as it would have been to difficult to have a family base in Napier, while also being in Dunedin for electorate business and Wellington for Parliamentary business. After Labour MP Geoff Braybrooke signaled his intention to retire in 1999, Cullen expressed interest in running for Braybrooke&#x27;s Napier electorate seat, although after Braybrooke reversed his decision Cullen decided to contest the 1999 election as a list only candidate. As Deputy leader Cullen was guaranteed the number 2 placing on Labour&#x27;s list and Labour&#x27;s electoral victory in 1999 resulted in Cullen easily being returned to Parliament as a List MP and becoming Minister of Finance.

As Minister of Finance, Cullen delivered nine consecutive budget surpluses, the longest unbroken run by any finance minister since the 1940s. After the government&#x27;s defeat in 2008, his successor Bill English praised the Labour government, telling reporters that New Zealand was starting from a “reasonable position” due to Cullen&#x27;s budgets “saving up for” a rainy day fund in dealing with the global financial crisis.

After the 2002 election, the electoral support for Labour&#x27;s junior coalition partner (the Progressive Party) was not sufficient to justify its leader holding the Deputy Prime Minister position, resulting in Michael Cullen replacing Jim Anderton as Deputy Prime Minister.

In 2005 Helen Clark appointed Cullen to the post of Attorney-General following the election of Margaret Wilson as Speaker of the House. His appointment became controversial because of his non-legal background (only one other non-lawyer had previously held the post) and because of his previous criticisms of the judiciary, including of the Chief Justice Dame Sian Elias. His term in the position ended following the 2005 general election. However, with the resignation of David Parker in March 2006, Cullen took over the position again.

He had a reputation as one of the Labour Party&#x27;s best parliamentary debaters, and is known for his sometimes &quot;acerbic&quot; sense of humour.

==== Budget 2006 ====

Cullen presented his seventh budget in 2006. Cullen&#x27;s guiding principle was, he stated, &quot;The fool who spends on the upturn will find himself broke on the downturn&quot;.

==== Budget 2007 ====

Labour&#x27;s eighth budget in 2007 reduced company tax from 33% to 30%
and introduced a 15% research and development tax credit. It also made a number of changes to the KiwiSaver scheme.

==== Budget 2008 ====

The New Zealand economy entered recession in December 2007. Cullen&#x27;s final budget was delivered in this context in May 2008; it reduced income tax on the first $9,500 earned from 15% to 12.5%, and the company tax rate from 30% to 29%.

=== Resignation and retirement from politics ===
The day after the defeat of Labour in the 2008 general elections and Helen Clark&#x27;s resignation as party leader, Cullen announced his resignation as deputy leader of the Labour Party. Phil Goff was elected the new leader and Annette King succeeded him as deputy leader. Goff appointed Cullen as Shadow Leader of the House and Spokesperson for Treaty of Waitangi Negotiations.

When he resigned from Parliament in 2009 he was replaced as an MP from the party list by Damien O&#x27;Connor.

==Political views==
Cullen identified as a social democrat.

In 2004 Cullen declared his support for the monarchy of New Zealand, describing himself as &quot;a sort of token monarchist in the Cabinet these days&quot;. However, in 2010 he repudiated that stance, taking the view that New Zealand should move towards a republic once the Queen&#x27;s reign ends.

Cullen voted in favour of the third reading of the Civil Union Bill 2004, which legalised civil unions in New Zealand. In 2020 he declared his support for the End of Life Choice Bill.

Despite his opposition to a capital gains tax during his term as finance minister on grounds that it was &quot;political suicide&quot;, as the head of the Tax Working Group appointed by Jacinda Ardern, he recommended one in 2019. Cullen changed his views and saw the tax as necessary to reduce inequality in New Zealand. Cullen was being paid more than $1000 a day as chairman of the Tax Working Group.

==Post politics==
After leaving parliament, Cullen held a number of public roles, including serving on the Constitutional Advisory Panel, the Tax Working Group and chairing the boards of New Zealand Post and the Earthquake Commission. He was appointed to chair the Bay of Plenty District Health Board after the 2019 local elections. He also joined the board of retirement insurance business Lifetime Income.

In March 2020, Cullen stood down from most of his public roles after announcing that he had been diagnosed with stage IV small-cell lung cancer. His memoir, &quot;Labour Saving&quot;, was published in June 2021. He died of the illness in Whakatāne on 19 August 2021, aged 76.

==Honours and awards==

In 1990, Cullen was awarded the New Zealand 1990 Commemoration Medal. On 16 December 2009, he received an honorary LLD from the University of Otago in recognition of &quot;his contributions as an Otago academic and as a respected and highly influential politician&quot;.

In the 2012 Queen&#x27;s Birthday and Diamond Jubilee Honours, Cullen was appointed Knight Companion of the New Zealand Order of Merit.

<text>Wilfried Achiel Emma Martens (; 19 April 1936 – 9 October 2013) was a Belgian politician who served as prime minister of Belgium from 1979 to 1981 and from 1981 to 1992. A member of the Flemish Christian People&#x27;s Party, during his premiership he oversaw the transformation of Belgium into a federal state. He was one of the founders of the European People&#x27;s Party.

==Early life==
Martens was born on 19 April 1936 in the village of Sleidinge, East Flanders, the son of modest small farmers. He studied law at the Catholic University of Leuven, graduating in 1960. Martens became active in the Flemish Movement as a student. He began to draw public attention in 1957 when, as president of the Flemish Youth Committee, he organized a march to protest the lack of Flemish presence in the 1958 Brussels World&#x27;s Fair, and was subsequently arrested while protesting the opening of the exposition.

== Political career ==
In 1965, Martens joined the Christian People&#x27;s Party or CD&amp;V, (since renamed to Christian Democratic and Flemish). He served as the party&#x27;s chairman from 1972 to 1979, sitting as a deputy in the Chamber of Representatives from 1974 to 1991, and serving as a Senator from 1991 to 1994.

Wilfried Martens served as Prime Minister in nine coalition governments (Martens I-IX) from 3 April 1979 to 6 April 1981 and 17 December 1981 to 7 March 1992. His period in office was dominated by the economic crisis of the 1980s and the state reforms of 1980 and 1988 which set Belgium on a path to federalism.

He co-founded the European People&#x27;s Party (EPP) in 1976 and was EPP President from 1992 until his death.

From 1993, he was President of the European Union of Christian Democrats (EUCD), until its merger with the EPP in 1996. Martens also negotiated with Finnish politician Sauli Niinistö the merger of the European Democrat Union (EDU) into the EPP (formally concluded in 2002). The successful fusion of all centre-right European organisations into the EPP – currently the largest transnational European political party with 75 member-parties from 40 countries – is widely recognised as an important achievement of his European political legacy.

From 1994 to 1998, he was a Member of the European Parliament, chairing the EPP Group.

From October 2000 to November 2001, he was also the President of the Christian Democrat International (CDI).

He re-appeared on the Belgian political stage on 22 December 2008 to help in the 2007–2011 Belgian political crisis.

Martens held a doctorate in law, a degree in notarial studies, as well as a baccalaureate in Thomistic philosophy from the Catholic University of Louvain. He also studied international political science at Harvard University. He practised law at the Ghent court of appeal.

Among numerous national and international distinctions, he was honoured in 1998 with the Charles V European Award for his contribution to European integration.

== Private life ==
Martens had five children: two from his first marriage with Lieve Verschroeven (Kris and Anne) and three with Ilse Schouteden (Sarah, Sophie and Simon). After the birth of their twins in 1997 they married on 13 November 1998. Ilse Schouteden has a son from her previous marriage. In 2007 he divorced his second wife. On 27 September 2008 he married Miet Smet, a former Belgian minister. It was his third marriage and her first. After the death of his first wife, Martens was able to celebrate the marriage to Miet Smet in the Catholic Church, on 27 April 2013.

== Death and tributes ==

Martens suffered from pancreatic cancer and ended his life via euthanasia on the 9th of October, 2013 at his home in Lokeren; he was 77. Elio Di Rupo, the Belgian prime minister, described him as a &quot;true statesman and one of the fathers of federal Belgium&quot;. Martin Schulz, president of the European Parliament, paid tribute to him as a &quot;statesman of Belgium, Europe and an outstanding leader of European Parliament&quot;. Jerzy Buzek, EPP MEP and former prime minister of Poland, described him as &quot;irreplaceable&quot;. He received a state funeral he was buried in the cemetery of Campo Santo.

The EPP think tank Centre for European Studies has been renamed after him, now being the &quot;Wilfried Martens Centre for European Studies&quot;, a decision taken during the EPP Congress in Dublin held on 9 March 2014.

<doc id="358957" wikidata="Q188877" url="?curid=358957" title="Brambling">
<text>The brambling (Fringilla montifringilla) is a small passerine bird in the finch family Fringillidae. It has also been called the cock o&#x27; the north and the mountain finch. It is widespread and migratory, often seen in very large flocks.

==Taxonomy==
In 1758 Linnaeus included the species in the 10th edition of his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; under its current binomial name, &quot;Fringilla montifringilla&quot;. &quot;Montifringilla&quot; is from Latin &quot;mons, montis&quot; mountain and &quot;fringilla&quot; finch. The English name &quot;bramlyng&quot; (Bram &quot;loud&quot; + lyng &quot;lung&quot;) was used in 1544 by the English naturalist William Turner but later in the 16th century the current spelling &quot;brambling&quot; was used. The etymology of the name is uncertain as the bird is not associated with the bramble or common blackberry &quot;Rubus fruticosus&quot;.

==Description==
The brambling is similar in size and shape to a common chaffinch. Breeding-plumaged male bramblings are very distinctive, with a black head, dark upperparts, orange breast and white belly. Females and younger birds are less distinct, and more similar in appearance to some chaffinches. In all plumages, however, bramblings differs from chaffinches in a number of features:
* the brambling has a white rump, whereas that of the common chaffinch is grey-green;
* the breast is orange, contrasting with a white belly, on the brambling, whereas on the common chaffinch, the underparts are more uniformly coloured (pink or buff);
* the brambling&#x27;s scapular feathers are orange, whereas the common chaffinch&#x27;s are grey or grey-brown;
* the flanks are dark-spotted on the brambling, plain on the common chaffinch;
* bramblings lack the white outer tail feathers of common chaffinches.

An additional difference for all plumages except breeding-plumaged males is the bill colour - yellow in the brambling, dull pinkish in the common chaffinch (breeding-plumaged male bramblings have black bills, common chaffinches in the corresponding plumage have grey bills).

Measurements:

* Length: 16 cm
* Weight: 23–29 g
* Wingspan: 25–26 cm

==Distribution and habitat==

This bird is widespread, in the breeding season, throughout the forests of northern Europe and east across the Palearctic. It is migratory, wintering in southern Europe, North Africa, northern India, northern Pakistan, China, and Japan. It frequently strays into Alaska during migration and there are scattered records across the northern United States and southern Canada. The global population of bramblings is about 100 to 200 million, with a decreasing trend.

Open coniferous or birch woodland is favoured for breeding.

===Migration===
This species is almost entirely migratory. In Europe, it forms large flocks in the winter, sometimes with thousands or even millions of birds in a single flock. Such large gatherings occur especially if beech mast is abundant. Bramblings do not require beech mast in the winter, but winter flocks of bramblings will move until they find it. This may be an adaptation to avoid competition with the common chaffinch.

==Behaviour==

===Breeding===
Bramblings first breed when they are one year old. The nest is usually placed high in a tree against the trunk. It is built by the female and consists of an outer layer which may contain lichen, grass, heather, cobwebs and strips of bark from birch or juniper trees. It is lined with feathers, soft grass and hair. The eggs are laid at daily intervals. The clutch usually contains 5–7 eggs. They range from light blue to dark olive-brown and have pink to rusty red spots and blotches. On average they measure and have a calculated weight of . Starting after the last egg has been laid, they are incubated by the female and hatch after 11–12 days. The young are fed and cared for by both parents and fledge after 13–14 days. Often only one brood is raised each year but two broods can be raised in northwest Russia.

The nests can be predated by the carrion crow (&quot;Corvus corone&quot;) and the Siberian jay (&quot;Perisoreus infaustus&quot;). The nest are often parasitized by the common cuckoo (&quot;Cuculus canorus&quot;).

===Food and feeding===
Bramblings mostly eat seeds in winter, but insects in summer.

<text>Ruy López de Villalobos (;  – 23 April 1546) was a Spanish explorer who led a failed attempt to colonize the Philippines in 1544, attempting to assert Spanish control there under the terms of the treaties of Tordesillas and Zaragoza. Unable to feed his men through barter, raiding, or farming and unable to request resupply from Mexico due to poor knowledge of the Pacific&#x27;s winds and currents, Villalobos abandoned his mission and fled to the Portuguese-held Moluccas, where he died in prison. He is chiefly remembered for some sources crediting him with naming Leyte and Samar &quot;Las Islas Filipinas&quot; in 1543 in honor of the Spanish crown prince Philip (later King PhilipII). The name was later extended across the entire Philippine Archipelago and its nation. (Other sources credit the name to one of his captains, Bernardo de la Torre.)

==Background==
Ruy López de Villalobos was born in Málaga, Spain sometime between 1505 and 1510. He was a member of a distinguished family and his father was a close associate of the king, Ferdinand II of Aragon. He was well educated and may have studied law. At some point he became an experienced sailor and Pedro de Alvarado referred to him as &quot;a very expert and practical gentleman in things of the sea.&quot;

==Philippine expedition==

Villalobos was commissioned in 1541 by Antonio de Mendoza, the viceroy of New Spain and first colonial administrator in the New World, to send an expedition to the Philippines, then known to the Spanish as the &quot;Islands of the West&quot; (). They lay at the far western frontier of the division of the world between Spain and Portugal established by the treaties of Tordesillas and Zaragozain fact they lay over the line within the Portuguese areaand there was a need to establish a larger Spanish presence there as a base for trade with the Spice Islands and China. If possible, the goal was to extend Spanish control over the Moluccas in the Portuguese East Indies. Villalobos was chosen for the command because he was related to De Mendoza by marriage.

Villalobos&#x27;s fleet of six ships left Barra de Navidad, Jalisco, in New Spain (now Mexico) with 370–400 men on 1 November 1542:
* His flagship () was the of 150–200 toneladas, formerly owned by Juan Rodríguez Cabrillo. He chose Gaspar Rico as the expedition&#x27;s chief pilot (). 
* The second shipthe fleet&#x27;s was the 120-tonelada galleon , equipped with a cutwater () and under the command of Bernardo de la Torre and his pilot Alonso Fernández Tarifeño.
* The third ship of 90–100 toneladas is variously referenced as the , the , the , and the (&quot;Seven Greyhounds&quot;). It was captained by Francisco Merino and piloted by Francisco Ruiz.
* The fourth ship of 70 toneladas was the under Alonso Manrique, piloted by Ginés de Mafra, who had been a member of the 1519–1522 Magellan expedition.
* The fifth was the galley under Pedro Ortíz de Rueda, piloted by Antonio Corço and powered by sails and 20 pairs of oars.
* The last was the fusta under Juan Martel, piloted by Cristóbal de Pareja and powered by sails and 14 pairs of oars.

The large number of passengers included a unit of soldiers and a number of gentlemen, who brought black slaves and about 40 Indian men and women as servants. Martín de Islares acted as factor and interpreter; Guido de Lavezaris, later governor of the Philippines, as treasurer; Maestre Anes (&quot;Master Hans&quot;), previously part of both the Magellan and Loaísa expeditions, as chief gunner; and Gerónimo de Santisteban as head of the voyage&#x27;s clergy, which included 3 other Augustinian priests and 4 or 5 deacons.

The fleet first encountered the Revilla Gigedo Islands off the west coast of Mexico, among which the sighting of Roca Partida was reported for the first time. On 26 December 1542 they sighted a group of islands in the Marshalls that they called the Corals (), which most probably are those of the Wotje Atoll. They thought these to be the Islands of the Kings () previously charted by Álvaro de Saavedra in his 1528 expedition. They anchored at one of the islets, which they named San or Santo Esteban (&quot;St. Stephen&quot;). They left on 6 January 1543 and that same day they sighted several small islands on the same latitude as the Corals, which they named the Garden Islands (), now the Kwajalein Atoll. On 23 January 1543, the expedition found Fais in the Carolines, which they charted as the Sailors (). On 26 January 1543, they charted some new islands as the Reefs () which have since been identified as the Yaps, also part of the Carolines.

According to Spate, Villalobos&#x27;s crew included the pilot Juan Gaetan, credited by La Perouse for the discovery of Hawaii. Gaetan&#x27;s voyage was described in similar terms in 1753 with the same sequence of islands and no identification of any others known by the time of the account. In 1825, the Portuguese geographer Casado Giraldes stated that the &quot;Sandwich Islands&quot;i.e. the Hawaiian Islandswere discovered by Gaetan in 1542 and did not even mention James Cook.

From 6–23 January 1543, the galley now piloted by De Mafrawas separated from the other ships after a severe storm. It eventually reached the island of Mazaua, where Magellan had anchored in 1521. 

Although he was attempting to reach Cebu, Villalobos ignored the advice of his pilot to lead the ships north of Mindanao. Instead, on 2 February, the fleet reached northeastern Mindanao, exposed to the weather coming from the open ocean and separated from any Chinese or Malay traders. Stuck in place, they repaired their ships after the voyage. Bernardo de la Torre or Villalobos named Mindanao &quot;Cesarea Karoli&quot; () in honor of the Habsburg emperor Charles V, who was also king of Spain as Carlos I. They resorted to eating grubs, unknown plants, land crabs that sickened the crew, and a phosphorescent gray lizard which killed most of those who ate it. After several days, they reached Sarangani, where they lost six men while raiding a local village for supplies. During this period, either Bernardo de la Torre or Villalobos named Leyte and Samar the Philippines () in honor of Charles&#x27;s son the crown prince Philip (later King PhilipII).

On 7 August a Portuguese ship arrived with a letter from Jorge de Castro, governor of the Moluccas. De Castro demanded an explanation for the presence of the Spaniards in Portuguese territory, in response to which Villalobos drafted a letter dated 9 August. His letter repeated the Spanish claims to the islands, saying they were within the Demarcation Line of the Crown of Castile under the relevant treaties.

On 27 August the left for New Spain under De la Torre, directed to explain the expedition&#x27;s difficulties and request additional supplies and reinforcements. A second letter from De Castro arrived in the first week of September; Villalobos&#x27;s reply dated 12 September repeated the same claims as before. The having passed the Volcano Islands and possibly the Bonins without being able to replenish its waterreturned in mid-October without completing its mission. (No attempt to cross the Pacific from west to east would be successful for another two decades.) Villalobos again attempted to depart for Cebu with the and , but again failed to make headway against unfavorable winds. The natives refused to provide any supplies even for sail, fearing Portuguese retribution.

De la Torre having died, the was refitted for another attempt to reach New Spain under Yñigo Ortiz de Retez using a southerly route instead. This left on 16 May 1545 and hugged the coast of New Guineawhich Ortiz de Retez nameduntil 12 August, when the ship was forced to turn back once again. It reached Tidore in October. Repulsed by hunger, hostile natives, and further shipwreck, Villalobos finally abandoned the remaining goals of the expedition. He and his crew members sought refuge in the Moluccas but, quarrelling with the Portuguese, were imprisoned.

Villalobos died of a tropical fever on Good Friday 23 April 1546, in his prison cell on Ambon Island. The Portuguese described him dying &quot;of a broken heart&quot;. Popular legend made his deathbed nurse the Jesuit missionary and later saint Francis Xavier.

Some 117 of the crew survived, including De Mafra, Juan Gaetan, and Guido de Lavezaris. Juan Gaetan&#x27;s account of the Villalobos voyage was published in 15501559 by Giovanni Battista Ramusio, an Italian historian, in his &quot;Navigations and Travels&quot; (). De Mafra produced a manuscript on Magellan&#x27;s voyage and had this delivered to Spain by a friend. Thirtyincluding De Mafraelected to remain instead. His manuscript remained unrecognized for many centuries until being rediscovered in the early 20th century. The survivors who had left Spain or Portugal and returned home were individually circumnavigators of the world, although the expedition itself did not accomplish that.

The inaccurate accounts of Villalobos and his men led Spain to believe that the Pacific was much smaller than it actually was for the rest of the 16th century.

<doc id="358964" wikidata="Q467019" url="?curid=358964" title="Margaret II, Countess of Hainaut">
<text>Margaret II of Avesnes (1311 – 23 June 1356) was Countess of Hainaut and Countess of Holland (as Margaret I) from 1345 to 1356. She was Holy Roman Empress and Queen of Germany by marriage to Holy Roman Emperor Louis IV the Bavarian.

==Life==
Margaret was the daughter of William I, Count of Hainaut, and Joan of Valois, the daughter of Charles, Count of Valois, who was the third son of King Philip III of France. She spent her childhood in Hainaut (also known as Hainault or Henegouwen) and also frequently visited France with her French mother.

On 26 February 1324, in Cologne, she married Louis of Bavaria, thereby becoming Queen of Germany. On 17 January 1328, she was crowned Holy Roman Empress alongside her spouse in Rome.

===First reign===
In 1345 she succeeded her brother William II, Count of Hainaut and Holland (as William IV, Count of Holland) following his death in battle with her husband Louis IV the Bavarian, Holy Roman Emperor who designated that the counties of Hainaut, Holland, Zeeland and Friesland were his wife&#x27;s possessions. Emperor Louis IV gave his support to his wife Margaret because he was reportedly worried that the domains of her late brother would otherwise be lost to the empire. Due to the dangerous hostility of the House of Luxemburg, Louis increased his power base ruthlessly.
Margaret traveled to Hainaut and was recognized there in her new position as ruler, and on 26 March, she left Hainaut to visit her Northern domains of Holland and Zeeland. There were different difficulties in securing the position of Margaret in her three domains. In Holland and Zeeland, there were doubts as to whether female succession was legal, and while her gender was not a problem in Hainaut, there where still the question of her sister&#x27;s claims upon the domain. Margaret granted the cities and citizens in Holland and Zeeland several economic privileges to secure her position. The claims of her sisters were also addressed.

A parchment dated 7 September 1346 in Frankfurt, of which the seal is destroyed, announces that Louis IV of Bavaria, Emperor of the Holy Germanic Empire bestows for himself and his heirs, in the name of his spouse, the empress Margaret, to never cede, divide or bestow the counties of Hainaut, Holland, Zeeland and the palatine of Frisia, which belong to his wife Margaret II (of Avesnes), Countess of Hainaut and to her heirs, excepting the rights of her sisters and after her death, to be passed to their second son William I, Duke of Bavaria (future William III, Count of Hainaut) Duke (I) of Bavaria, and after his decease to Albert (future Albert I, Count of Hainaut). Margaret&#x27;s sisters, including Philippa of Hainault who was Queen consort of King Edward III of England, disavowed their hereditary claims.

Margaret ruled her three domains directly for seven months, after which she was called back to Germany by her spouse, and then appointed her son William to rule in her absence.

When Louis IV died on 11 October 1347, he was succeeded by his six sons, and in connection to this, Margaret resigned her sovereignty in favor of her son William in exchange for an allowance. In 1349 Louis IV&#x27;s sons decided to partition their possessions: Louis V, Duke of Bavaria kept Brandenburg and Tyrol, his younger brothers Louis VI the Roman and Otto V the Bavarian received Upper Bavaria. While Stephen II, William I and Albert I received Lower Bavaria, Holland and Hainaut. Louis V and Stephen were the stepsons of Margaret from her husband&#x27;s first wife, and her youngest sons Albert and Otto were still minors. Her eldest son Louis VI released Holland and Hainaut for his brothers William and Albert in 1349 since he expected the Polish crown by his marriage with Cunigunde of Poland. In 1353 her son Stephen also released Holland and Hainaut to his brother William.

However, a conflict soon arose between Margaret and her son William, as he refused to honor the terms in her abdication document by withholding the allowance she had demanded in turn for abdicating in his favor. Willem&#x27;s opposition among the nobles of Holland asked Margaret to return to run Holland again, and in March 1350, Margaret had returned to Hainaut, where she retracted her abdication in 1 June. The Cod League was formed on 23 May 1350 by a number of supporters of William, and on 5 September of the same year, the Hook League was formed in support of Margaret. Soon afterward these factions clashed and a civil war began, known as the Hook and Cod wars.

Margaret and the war between mother and son was controversial, and her right to Holland was always considered to be of dubious legality, as this domain was at that time regarded as reserved for men, though the same thing was not raised when it came to her right to Hainaut.

After the destruction of several strongholds of Margaret and a defeat of her forces at two sea battles in 1351, Edward III of England, Margaret&#x27;s brother-in-law through her sister Philippa of Hainault, came to her aid, winning a naval engagement off Veere in 1351; a few weeks later the Hooks and their English allies were defeated by William and the Cods at Vlaardingen, a defeat which ruined Margaret&#x27;s cause. Edward III shortly afterwards changed sides and in 1354, Margaret saw herself compelled to come to an understanding with her son: he being recognized as count of Holland and Zeeland, and she being secured as ruling countess of Hainaut in her lifetime.

Margaret ruled Hainaut for two more years, and died at Le Quesnoy Castle of infectious tuberculosis 23 June 1356, leaving William in possession of the entire Holland-Hainaut inheritance. She was buried in the Minderbroeders Abbey in Valenciennes.

<doc id="358965" wikidata="Q239718" url="?curid=358965" title="Muezzin">
<text>The muezzin (; ) is the person who proclaims the call to the daily prayer (ṣalāt) five times a day (Fajr prayer, Zuhr prayer, Asr prayer, Maghrib prayer and Isha prayer) at a mosque from the minaret. The muezzin plays an important role in ensuring an accurate prayer schedule for the Muslim community.

== Etymology ==
The English word &quot;muezzin&quot; is borrowed from , , simplified &quot;mu&#x27;azzin&quot;, the active participle of &quot;to call&quot;. Thus, it means &quot;the calling one&quot;.

==Roles and responsibilities==
The professional muezzin is chosen for his good character, voice and skills to serve at the mosque. Muezzins are typically men. The muezzin is not considered a cleric, as he cleans the toilets and the place where people wash their hands, face and feet when they perform the Wuḍu&#x27; (Arabic: &quot;wuḍū’&quot; وُضُوء, the &quot;purification&quot; of ablution) before offering the prayer. When calling to prayer, the muezzin faces the qiblah, the direction of the Ka&#x27;bah in Makkah, while reciting the &quot;adhan&quot;.

From the fourteenth century, initially in Mamluk Egypt but then spread into other parts of the Islamic world, major mosques might employ a related officer, the &quot;muwaqqit&quot;, who determined the prayer times using mathematical astronomy. Unlike the muezzin who were typically chosen for their piety and beautiful voice, the qualification of the muwaqqit required special knowledge in astronomy. Historian Sonja Brentjes speculates that the muwaqqit might have evolved from a specialised muezzin, and that there might not have been a clear delineation between the two offices. Some celebrated muwaqqits, including Shams al-Din al-Khalili and ibn al-Shatir, were known to have once been muezzins, and many individuals held both offices simultaneously. Today, with the production of electronic devices and authoritative timetables, a muezzin in a mosque can broadcast the call to prayer by consulting a table or a clock without requiring the specialised skill of a &quot;muwaqqit&quot;.

==Call of the muezzin==
The call of the muezzin is considered an art form, reflected in the melodious chanting of the adhan. In Turkey there is an annual competition to find the country&#x27;s best muezzin.

Historically, a muezzin would have recited the call to prayer atop the minarets in order to be heard by those around the mosque. Now, mosques often have loudspeakers mounted on the top of the minaret and the muezzin will use a microphone, or a recording is played, allowing the call to prayer to be heard at great distances without climbing the minaret.

==Origins==
The institution of the muezzin has existed since the time of Muhammad. The first muezzin was a former slave Bilal ibn Rabah, one of the most trusted and loyal &quot;sahabah&quot; (companions) of the Islamic prophet Muhammad. He was born in Mecca and is considered to have been the first mu&#x27;azzin, chosen by Muhammad himself.

After minarets became customary at mosques, the office of muezzin in cities was sometimes given to a blind man, who could not see down into the inner courtyards of the citizens&#x27; houses and thus could not violate privacy.

* Ali Ahmed Mulla

<doc id="358966" wikidata="Q27075785" url="?curid=358966" title="European greenfinch">
<text>The European greenfinch or simply the greenfinch (Chloris chloris) is a small passerine bird in the finch family Fringillidae.

This bird is widespread throughout Europe, North Africa and Southwest Asia. It is mainly resident, but some northernmost populations migrate further south. The greenfinch has also been introduced into Australia, New Zealand, Uruguay, and Argentina.

==Taxonomy==

The greenfinch was described by Carl Linnaeus in his landmark 1758 10th edition of &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; under the binomial name &quot;Loxia chloris&quot;. The specific epithet is from &quot;khloris&quot;, the Ancient Greek name for this bird, from &quot;khloros&quot;, &quot;green&quot;.

A molecular phylogenetic study published in 2012 found that the greenfinches are not closely related to other members of the genus &quot;Carduelis&quot;. They have therefore been placed in the resurrected genus &quot;Chloris&quot; that had originally been introduced by the French naturalist Georges Cuvier in 1800, with the European greenfinch as the type species.

===Subspecies===
There are 10 recognised subspecies.
==Description==

The European greenfinch is long with a wingspan of . It is similar in size and shape to a house sparrow, but is mainly green, with yellow in the wings and tail. The female and young birds are duller and have brown tones on the back. The bill is thick and conical. The song contains a lot of trilling twitters interspersed with wheezes, and the male has a &quot;butterfly&quot; display flight. 
Male greenfinch birds exhibit higher degrees of fluctuating asymmetry. The development of males&#x27; bones is more subject to disruption than that of females.

==Behaviour and ecology==

===Breeding===

The breeding season lasts from the second half of March until June; fledging takes place in early July. 
Woodland edges, farmland hedges and gardens with relatively thick vegetation are favoured for breeding. The nest is placed in trees or bushes. The nest is built by the female who is accompanied by the male. The clutch consists of 4–6 eggs which are laid at daily intervals usually beginning one or two days after the completion of the nest. The eggs are greyish-white, bluish-white or beige with reddish or brownish spots or blotches concentrated at the broader end. On average the eggs measure and weigh . They are incubated by the female for 13–14 days. The male feeds her at the nest during this period. Chicks are covered with thick, long, greyish-white down at hatching. They are fed on insect larvae by both adults during the first days, and later, by a frequently regurgitated yellowish paste made of seeds. They leave the nest about 13 days later, but they are not able to fly. Usually, they fledge 16–18 days after hatching. This species produces two or three broods per year.

In Australasia, the European greenfinch&#x27;s breeding season is from October to March.

===Food and feeding===
The European greenfinch feeds on a great variety of seeds, berries, fruit, buds, flowers and some arthropods. It forages in trees and bushes, and also on the ground.

==Predators and parasites==
The protozoal parasite &quot;Trichomonas gallinae&quot; was known to infect pigeons and raptors, but, beginning in Great Britain in 2005, carcasses of dead European greenfinches and common chaffinches were found to be infected with the parasite. The disease spread and in 2008, infected carcasses were found in Norway, Sweden and Finland and a year later in Germany. The spread of the disease is believed to have been mediated by common chaffinches, as large numbers of the birds breed in northern Europe and winter in Great Britain. In Great Britain, the number of infected carcasses recovered each year declined after a peak in 2006. There was a reduction in the number of European greenfinches from around 4.3 million to around 2.8 million, but no significant decline in the overall number of common chaffinches. A similar pattern occurred in Finland where, after the arrival of the disease in 2008, there was a reduction in the number of European greenfinches but only a small change in the number of common chaffinches.

==In literature==
The English poet William Wordsworth wrote a poem about this species entitled &quot;The Green Linnet&quot; in 1803.

<text>The BeiDou Navigation Satellite System (BDS; ) is a satellite-based radio navigation system owned and operated by the China National Space Administration. It provides geolocation and time information to a BDS receiver anywhere on or near the Earth where there is an unobstructed line of sight to four or more BDS satellites. It does not require the user to transmit any data and operates independently of any telephonic or Internet reception, though these technologies can enhance the usefulness of the BDS positioning information; however, concerns have been raised about embedded malware leaking information in this way.

The current service, BeiDou-3 (third-generation BeiDou), provides full global coverage for timing and navigation, along with Russia&#x27;s GLONASS, the European Galileo, and the US&#x27;s GPS. It consists of satellites in three different orbits, including 24 satellites in medium-circle orbits (covering the world), 3 satellites in inclined geosynchronous orbits (covering the Asia-Pacific region), and 3 satellites in geostationary orbits (covering China). The BeiDou-3 system was fully operational in July 2020. In 2016, BeiDou-3 reached millimeter-level accuracy with post-processing.

Predecessors included BeiDou-1 (first-generation BeiDou), consisting of three satellites in a regional satellite navigation system. Since 2000, the system has mainly provided navigation services within China. In December 2012, as the design life of BeiDou-1 expired, it stopped operating.
The BeiDou-2 (second-generation BeiDou) system was also a regional satellite navigation system containing 16 satellites, including 6 geostationary satellites, 6 inclined geosynchronous orbit satellites, and 4 medium earth orbit satellites. In November 2012, BeiDou-2 began to provide users with regional positioning services in the Asia-Pacific region. Within the region, BeiDou is more accurate than GPS.

In 2015, fifteen years after the satellite system was launched, it was generating a turnover of $31.5 billion per annum for major companies such as China Aerospace Science and Industry Corporation, AutoNavi, and Norinco. The industry has grown an average of over 20% in value annually to reach $64 billion in 2020.

== Nomenclature ==
The official English name of the system is &quot;BeiDou Navigation Satellite System&quot;. It is named after the Big Dipper asterism, which is known in Chinese as (). The name literally means &quot;Northern Dipper&quot;, the name given by ancient Chinese astronomers to the seven brightest stars of the Ursa Major constellation. Historically, this set of stars was used in navigation to locate the North Star. As such, the name BeiDou also serves as a metaphor for the purpose of the satellite navigation system.

== History ==
=== Conception and initial development ===
The original idea of a Chinese satellite navigation system was conceived by Chen Fangyun and his colleagues in the 1980s. The Gulf War in 1991 showcased how the GPS gave the US complete advantage on the battlefield and how satellite navigation systems can be used to conduct &quot;space warfare&quot;. In 1993, China realised the risk of denied access to GPS during the Yinhe incident and including an alleged case in 1996 during the Third Taiwan Strait Crisis, gave impetus to the creation of its own indigenous satellite navigation system which officially began in 1994.

According to the China National Space Administration, in 2010, the development of the system would be carried out in three steps:

# 2000–2003: experimental BeiDou navigation system consisting of three satellites
# By 2012: regional BeiDou navigation system covering China and neighboring regions
# By 2020: global BeiDou navigation system

The first satellite, &quot;BeiDou-1A&quot;, was launched on 30 October 2000, followed by &quot;BeiDou-1B&quot; on 20 December 2000. The third satellite, &quot;BeiDou-1C&quot; (a backup satellite), was put into orbit on 25 May 2003. The successful launch of &quot;BeiDou-1C&quot; also meant the establishment of the BeiDou-1 navigation system.

On 2 November 2006, China announced that from 2008 BeiDou would offer an open service with an accuracy of 10 metres, timing of 0.2 microseconds, and speed of 0.2 metres/second.

In February 2007, the fourth and last satellite of the BeiDou-1 system, &quot;BeiDou-1D&quot; (sometimes called &quot;BeiDou-2A&quot;, serving as a backup satellite), was launched. It was reported that the satellite had suffered from a control system malfunction but was then fully restored.

In April 2007, the first satellite of BeiDou-2, namely &quot;Compass-M1&quot; (to validate frequencies for the BeiDou-2 constellation) was successfully put into its working orbit. The second BeiDou-2 constellation satellite &quot;Compass-G2&quot; was launched on 15 April 2009.

On 15 January 2010, the official website of the BeiDou Navigation Satellite System went online, and the system&#x27;s third satellite (&quot;Compass-G1&quot;) was carried into its orbit by a Long March 3C rocket on 17 January 2010.

On 2 June 2010, the fourth satellite was launched successfully into orbit.

The fifth orbiter was launched into space from Xichang Satellite Launch Center by an LM-3I carrier rocket on 1 August 2010.

Three months later, on 1 November 2010, the sixth satellite was sent into orbit by LM-3C.

Another satellite, the BeiDou-2/Compass IGSO-5 (fifth inclined geosynchronous orbit) satellite, was launched from the Xichang Satellite Launch Center by a Long March 3A on 1 December 2011 (UTC).
=== Chinese involvement in Galileo system ===
In September 2003, China intended to join the European Galileo positioning system project and was to invest €230 million (US$296 million, £160 million) in Galileo over the next few years. At the time, it was believed that China&#x27;s &quot;BeiDou&quot; navigation system would then only be used by its armed forces.

In October 2004, China officially joined the Galileo project by signing the &quot;Agreement on the Cooperation in the Galileo Program between the &quot;Galileo Joint Undertaking&quot; (GJU) and the &quot;National Remote Sensing Centre of China&quot; (NRSCC)&quot;. Based on the Sino-European Cooperation Agreement on Galileo program, China Galileo Industries (CGI), the prime contractor of China&#x27;s involvement in Galileo programs, was founded in December 2004. By April 2006, eleven cooperation projects within the Galileo framework had been signed between China and the EU.

=== Phase III ===
* In November 2014, BeiDou became part of the World-Wide Radionavigation System (WWRNS) at the 94th meeting of the International Maritime Organization (IMO) Maritime Safety Committee, which approved the &quot;Navigation Safety Circular&quot; of the BeiDou Navigation Satellite System (BDS).
* At Beijing time 21:52, 30 March 2015, the first new-generation BeiDou Navigation satellite (and the 17th overall) was successfully set to orbit by a Long March 3C rocket.
* On 20 April 2019, a BeiDou satellite was successfully launched. Launch occurred at 22:41 Beijing time, and the Long March 3B delivered the BeiDou navigation payload into an elliptical transfer orbit ranging between 220 kilometres and 35,787 kilometres, with an inclination of 28.5° to the equator, according to U.S. military tracking data.
* On 23 June 2020, the final BeiDou satellite was successfully launched, the launch of the 55th satellite in the BeiDou family. The third iteration of the BeiDou Navigation Satellite System provides global coverage for timing and navigation, offering an alternative to Russia&#x27;s GLONASS and the European Galileo positioning system, as well as the US&#x27;s GPS.

=== Use outside China ===

In 2018, the Pakistan Armed Forces received access to BeiDou for military purposes. In 2019, the Saudi Ministry of Defense signed an agreement for military use of BeiDou. In 2020, Argentina entered into a cooperation agreement with China regarding the use of BeiDou. In 2021, the first China-Africa BeiDou System Cooperation Forum was held in Beijing. In 2022, Vladimir Putin signed an agreement for the interoperability of BeiDou and GLONASS.

=== GPS vs. BeiDou Capabilities ===
The National Space-Based Positioning, Navigation, and Timing (PNT) Advisory Board, which offers independent guidance to the U.S. government on GPS policy, issued a summary report from its 27th meeting held on 16–17 November 2022. During the meeting, it was highlighted that &quot;GPS’s capabilities are now substantially inferior to those of China’s BeiDou.&quot;

== BeiDou-3 ==

The third phase of the BeiDou system (BDS-3) includes three GEO satellites, three IGSO satellites, and twenty-four MEO satellites which introduce new signal frequencies B1C/B1I/B1A (1575.42MHz), B2a/B2b (1191.79MHz), B3I/B3Q/B3A (1268.52MHz), and Bs test frequency (2492.02MHz). Interface control documents on the new open signals were published in 2017–2018.

On 23 June 2020, the BDS-3 constellation deployment was fully completed after the last satellite was successfully launched at the Xichang Satellite Launch Center. BDS-3 satellites also include SBAS (B1C, B2a, B1A - GEO sats), Precise Point Positioning (B2b - GEO sats), and search and rescue transponder (6 MEOSAR) capabilities.


Characteristics of the &quot;I&quot; signals on E2 and E5B are generally similar to the civilian codes of GPS (L1-CA and L2C), but Compass signals have somewhat greater power. The notation of Compass signals used in this page follows the naming of the frequency bands and agrees with the notation used in the American literature on the subject, but the notation used by the Chinese seems to be different.

There has also been an experimental S band broadcast called &quot;Bs&quot; at 2492.028 MHz, following similar experiments on BeiDou-1.

== Predecessors ==

=== BeiDou-1 ===
BeiDou-1 was an experimental regional navigation system, which consisted of four satellites (three working satellites and one backup satellite). The satellites themselves were based on the Chinese DFH-3 geostationary communications satellite and had a launch weight of 1,000 kg each.

Unlike the American GPS, Russian GLONASS, and European Galileo systems, which use medium Earth orbit satellites, BeiDou-1 used satellites in geostationary orbit. This means that the system does not require a large constellation of satellites, but it also limits the coverage to areas on Earth where the satellites are visible. The area that can be serviced is from longitude 70° E to 140° E and from latitude 5° N to 55° N. The frequency of the system is 2,491.75 MHz.

==== Completion ====
The first satellite, BeiDou-1A, was launched on 31 October 2000. The second satellite, BeiDou-1B, was successfully launched on 21 December 2000. The last operational satellite of the constellation, BeiDou-1C, was launched on 25 May 2003.

==== Position calculation ====
In 2007, the official Xinhua News Agency reported that the resolution of the BeiDou system was as high as 0.5 metre. With the existing user terminals it appears that the calibrated accuracy is 20 m (100 m, uncalibrated).

==== Terminals ====
In 2008, a BeiDou-1 ground terminal cost around (), almost 10 times the price of a contemporary GPS terminal. The price of the terminals was explained as being due to the cost of imported microchips. At the China High-Tech Fair ELEXCON of November 2009 in Shenzhen, a BeiDou terminal priced at was presented.

==== Applications ====
* Over 1000 BeiDou-1 terminals were used after the 2008 Sichuan earthquake, providing information from the disaster area.
* As of October 2009, all Chinese border guards in Yunnan were equipped with BeiDou-1 devices.

Sun Jiadong, the chief designer of the navigation system, said in 2010 that &quot;Many organizations have been using our system for a while, and they like it very much&quot;.

==== Decommissioning ====
BeiDou-1 was decommissioned at the end of 2012, after the BeiDou-2 system became operational.

=== BeiDou-2 ===


BeiDou-2 (formerly known as COMPASS) is not an extension to the older BeiDou-1, but rather supersedes it outright. The new system is a constellation of 35 satellites, which include 5 geostationary orbit satellites for backward compatibility with BeiDou-1, and 30 non-geostationary satellites (27 in medium Earth orbit and 3 in inclined geosynchronous orbit), that offer complete coverage of the globe.

The ranging signals are based on the CDMA principle and have complex structure typical of Galileo or modernized GPS. Similar to the other global navigation satellite systems (GNSSs), there are two levels of positioning service: open (public) and restricted (military). The public service is available globally to general users. When all the currently planned GNSSs are deployed, users of multi-constellation receivers will benefit from a total over 100 satellites, which will significantly improve all aspects of positioning, especially availability of the signals in so-called urban canyons. The general designer of the COMPASS navigation system is Sun Jiadong, who is also the general designer of its predecessor, the original BeiDou navigation system. All BeiDou satellites are equipped with laser retroreflector arrays for satellite laser ranging and the verification of the orbit quality.

==== Accuracy ====
There are two levels of service provided – a free service to civilians and licensed service to the Chinese government and military. The free civilian service has a 10-metre location-tracking accuracy, synchronizes clocks with an accuracy of 10 nanoseconds, and measures speeds to within 0.2 m/s. The restricted military service has a location accuracy of 10 cm, can be used for communication, and will supply information about the system status to the user. In 2019, the International GNSS Service started providing precise orbits of BeiDou satellites in experimental products.

To date, the military service has been granted only to the People&#x27;s Liberation Army and to the Pakistan Armed Forces.

==== Frequencies ====
Frequencies for COMPASS are allocated in four bands: E1, E2, E5B, and E6; they overlap with Galileo. The fact of overlapping could be convenient from the point of view of the receiver design, but on the other hand raises the issues of system interference, especially within E1 and E2 bands, which are allocated for Galileo&#x27;s publicly regulated service. However, under International Telecommunication Union (ITU) policies, the first nation to start broadcasting in a specific frequency will have priority to that frequency, and any subsequent users will be required to obtain permission prior to using that frequency, and otherwise ensure that their broadcasts do not interfere with the original nation&#x27;s broadcasts. As of 2009, it appeared that Chinese COMPASS satellites would start transmitting in the E1, E2, E5B, and E6 bands before Europe&#x27;s Galileo satellites and thus have primary rights to these frequency ranges.

==== Compass-M1 ====
Compass-M1 is an experimental satellite launched for signal testing and validation and for the frequency filing on 14 April 2007. The role of Compass-M1 for Compass is similar to the role of the GIOVE satellites for the Galileo system. The orbit of Compass-M1 is nearly circular, has an altitude of 21,150 km and an inclination of 55.5°.

The investigation of the transmitted signals started immediately after the launch of Compass-M1 on 14 April 2007. Soon after in June 2007, engineers at CNES reported the spectrum and structure of the signals. A month later, researchers from Stanford University reported the complete decoding of the &quot;I&quot; signals components. The knowledge of the codes allowed a group of engineers at Septentrio to build the COMPASS receiver and report tracking and multipath characteristics of the &quot;I&quot; signals on E2 and E5B.

==== Operation ====
In December 2011, the system went into operation on a trial basis. It started providing navigation, positioning and timing data to China and the neighbouring area for free from 27 December 2011. During this trial run, Compass offered positioning accuracy to within 25 metres and the precision improved as more satellites were launched. Upon the system&#x27;s official launch, it pledged to offer general users positioning information accurate to the nearest 10 m, measure speeds within 0.2 metres per second, and provide signals for clock synchronisation accurate to 0.02 microseconds.

The BeiDou-2 system began offering services for the Asia-Pacific region in December 2012. At this time, the system could provide positioning data between longitude 55° E to 180° E and from latitude 55° S to 55° N.

The new-generation BeiDou satellites support short message service.

==== Completion ====
In December 2011, Xinhua stated that &quot;[t]he basic structure of the BeiDou system has now been established, and engineers are now conducting comprehensive system test and evaluation. The system will provide test-run services of positioning, navigation and time for China and the neighboring areas before the end of this year, according to the authorities&quot;. The system became operational in the China region that same month. The global navigation system should be finished by 2020.

As of December 2012, 16 satellites for BeiDou-2 had been launched, with 14 in service. As of December 2017, 150 million Chinese smartphones (20% of the market) were equipped to utilize BeiDou.

== Constellations ==
The regional BeiDou-1 system was decommissioned at the end of 2012.

The first satellite of the second-generation system, Compass-M1 was launched in 2007. It was followed by further nine satellites during 2009–2011, achieving functional regional coverage. A total of 16 satellites were launched during this phase.

In 2015, the system began its transition towards global coverage with the first launch of a new-generation of satellites, and the 17th one within the new system. On 25 July 2015, the 18th and 19th satellites were successfully launched from the Xichang Satellite Launch Center, marking the first time for China to launch two satellites at once on top of a Long March 3B/Expedition 1 carrier rocket. The Expedition-1 is an independent upper stage capable of delivering one or more spacecraft into different orbits. On 29 September 2015, the 20th satellite was launched, carrying a hydrogen maser for the first time within the system.

In 2016, the 21st, 22nd and 23rd satellites were launched from Xichang Satellite Launch Center, the last two of which entered into service on 5 August and 30 November, respectively.

Orbital period: 12 hours and 53 minutes (every 13 revolutions, done in 7 sidereal days, a satellite passes over the same location).


== Prohibitions ==
In 2018, Taiwan&#x27;s National Communications Commission announced that it would be illegal to use BeiDou products in Taiwan without its approval.

<doc id="358971" wikidata="Q45523" url="?curid=358971" title="Brisbane Airport">
<text>Brisbane Airport is an international airport serving Brisbane, the capital of the Australian state of Queensland. The airport services 31 airlines flying to 50 domestic and 29 international destinations, total amounting to more than 22.7 million passengers who travelled through the airport in 2016. In 2016, an OAG report named Brisbane airport as the fifth-best performing large-sized airport in the world for on-time performance with 87% of arrivals and departures occurring within 15 minutes of their scheduled times, slipping from 88.31% the year before. It covers an area of , making the airport the largest in land area in all of Australia.

Brisbane Airport is the primary hub for Virgin Australia, a major hub for Qantas, and a secondary hub for Qantas&#x27; low cost subsidiary Jetstar. Brisbane has the third highest number of domestic connections in Australia following Sydney and Melbourne. It is also home to Qantas&#x27; Airbus A330 and Boeing 737 heavy maintenance facilities. Virgin Australia has a smaller maintenance facility at the airport, where line-maintenance on the airline&#x27;s 737 fleet is performed. Alliance Airlines and QantasLink also conduct maintenance at the airport. The airport has international and domestic passenger terminals, a cargo terminal, a general aviation terminal and apron as well as two runways. JetGo also operated from Brisbane Airport until its demise in 2018.

The Royal Flying Doctor Service has one of its nine Queensland bases at Brisbane Airport.

==History==
===Eagle Farm Airport===

Brisbane&#x27;s first airport was Eagle Farm Airport that was built in 1925 on former agricultural land in the suburb of Eagle Farm located north-east of the Brisbane central business district, south-west of Brisbane Airport&#x27;s Domestic Terminal. Although Qantas started operations there in 1926, most of the flights in Brisbane operated at the Archerfield Airport, which contained a superior landing surface. While in operation, Charles Kingsford Smith landed at Eagle Farm on 9 June 1928, after completing the first trans-pacific flight in his Fokker F.VII, the Southern Cross. There is now a museum containing the original aircraft, along with a memorial located within the Brisbane Airport precinct.

During World War II, Brisbane was the headquarters of the Supreme Commander of Allied forces in the South West Pacific Area, General Douglas MacArthur. The United States Armed Forces upgraded the airfield (Eagle Farm Airport) to cater for military flights, bringing it to such a standard that it became the main civilian airport for the city.

By the 1960s, the facilities at Eagle Farm Airport were inadequate for a city of Brisbane&#x27;s size and anticipated growth. Many long-haul international services to Asia were required to make an en route stop (e.g., at Darwin), disadvantaging the city to lure prospective carriers and business opportunities.

Some of the infrastructure at Eagle Farm Airport was incorporated into today&#x27;s Brisbane Airport. For example, the north-east end of the main runway (04/22) survives as taxiway Papa of the present airport, while the Eagle Farm international terminal is now the Brisbane Airport cargo terminal. The final flight from the Eagle Farm Airport departed on 20 March 1988.

===1988 opening===
The Federal Government announced the construction of Brisbane Airport to be built immediately north east of Eagle Farm Airport. Construction commenced in June 1980. The new airport was built by Barclay Brothers at a cost of $400 million and opened on 19 March 1988, with a new domestic terminal and two runways. The opening was hosted by Prime Minister Bob Hawke. The new airport was built on the former Brisbane residential suburb of Cribb Island that was demolished to make way for the airport. Large amounts of sand were pumped from nearby Moreton Bay to raise the swamp land above the tidal range.

The 1988 facilities included: a domestic terminal; state-of-the-art maintenance facilities; freight apron at the existing passenger terminal; two runways ( and ) with parallel taxiway systems (cater for Code F+ aircraft); access roads; parking facilities and a tall air traffic control tower.

In September 1995, the international terminal was inaugurated by Prime Minister Paul Keating, and it has been expanded since that time.

===Privatisation===
In 1997, as part of the privatisation of numerous Australian airports, the airport was acquired for $1.4 billion from the Federal Airports Corporation by Brisbane Airport Corporation (BAC) under a 50-year lease (with an option to renew for a further 49 years). The original BAC shareholders were Amsterdam Airport Schiphol, Brisbane City Council, Commonwealth Bank and Port of Brisbane Corporation. Since that time, BAC has assumed ultimate responsibility for the operations of Brisbane Airport including all airport infrastructure investment with no government funding. As at January 2024, the major shareholders were Queensland Investment Corporation (29%), Igneo Infrastructure Partners (27%), Amsterdam Airport Schiphol (20%) and IFM Investors (20%). Brisbane Airport is categorised as a Leased Federal Airport.

====New parallel runway====
On 18 September 2007, the federal government granted approval for the construction of a new parallel runway. The proposed $1.3 billion, runway was expected to take approximately eight years to construct and was constructed on swamp land west of the existing terminal area and parallel to the existing main runway. The long construction period was due to the settling period of the of sand fill dredged from Moreton Bay. In early December 2014 the delivery of of sand to the site was completed. In 2019, asphalting of the second runway had begun and was completed by late 2019, while mid February 2020 saw the start of the line-marking of the runway. The runway was completed on 30 April 2020 after over eight years of construction at a cost of over $1 billion. It opened officially on 12 July 2020 with a Virgin Australia flight to Cairns being the first to take off from the new runway.

On 30 March 2020, runway 14/32 was decommissioned early as part of Brisbane&#x27;s new runway &#x27;Operational Readiness &amp; Testing&#x27; phase so that the newly decommissioned cross runway could be used for aircraft parking.

In May 2020, construction of a new runway was completed. Its first flight was operated by Virgin Australia, flight VA781 to Cairns, on 12 July 2020.

==Terminals==
Brisbane Airport has two passenger terminals.

===International terminal===
The international terminal was built in 1995 and has 14 bays with aerobridges, four of these are capable of handling A380s. There are also four layover bays. The terminal has four levels: level 1 houses most airline offices and baggage handlers, level 2 handles arrivals, level 3 houses the departure lounge (airside) and other offices (landside), and level 4 houses departure check-in.

The airport contains an Emirates lounge, the first outside Dubai that has direct access to the A380 aerobridges, and also has Air New Zealand, Qantas, Singapore Airlines, Aspire and Plaza Premium lounges.

There is also a five-storey long term carpark and a smaller short term carpark in close proximity to the terminal.

The international terminal redevelopment began in February 2014. The $45 million redevelopment is designed by Brisbane architectural practices Richards and Spence and Arkhefield. Queensland artists, Sebastian Moody and Mirdidingkingathi Juwarnda Sally Gabori, were commissioned for the artworks.

===Domestic terminal===
Brisbane Airport&#x27;s domestic terminal is a two-storey curved building with three complete satellite arms extending beyond the building providing additional passenger lounge and gate facilities for airlines.

The domestic terminal has three distinct areas serving Qantas and QantasLink at the northern end of the building and Virgin Australia at the southern end of the building with other carriers such as Jetstar located in the central area of the terminal.

The Qantas concourse has nine bays served by aerobridges including one served by a dual bridge. It has three lounges – The Qantas Club, Business Class and Chairman&#x27;s Lounge. Virgin Australia occupies what was the former Ansett Australia end of the terminal. Its concourse has 11 parking bays, nine of which are served by aerobridges including two served by a dual bridge. It has two lounges – the Virgin Australia Lounge which is located in the former Golden Wing Club opposite Gate 41 and the Beyond Lounge.

Remote bays are located to the north and south of the building (serving non-jet aircraft), and in the central area (serving jet aircraft).

On 27 February 2014, Qantas announced it had disposed of its long-term lease (signed in 1987) at the domestic terminal which was due to expire on 30 December 2018. Under the new arrangements, Qantas retains exclusive use and operational control over much of the northern end of the terminal until the end of 2018 while securing rights to key infrastructure beyond this period.

===Future third terminal===
As of September 2024, plans had begun for a terminal three development. The third terminal will reportedly service both domestic and international flights.

===AVCAIR FBO &amp; VIP Lounge and Brisbane Jet Base===
Brisbane has two FBO Lounge and Operation Facilities, located on the North Apron (Brisbane Jet Base) and South Logistics Apron (AVCAIR FBO) of Brisbane Airport. The AVCAIR facility handles VIP and FIFO (fly-in fly-out) movements including Ad hoc Military, Medical and Charter flights and offers direct airside access for VIP movements.

==Airlines and destinations==
===Passenger===

Qantas operates dedicated &#x27;flightseeing&#x27; services over Antarctica from Brisbane. These flights, using a Boeing 787 Dreamliner, depart Brisbane from the Domestic Terminal, and provide a guided aerial tour of Antarctica before returning to Australia. These flights are about thirteen hours in total.

===Cargo===
==Other tenants==
There are several operators of emergency medical retrieval and rescue services based at the airport, including LifeFlight Australia, the Royal Flying Doctor Service and AVCAIR.

==Ground transport==
===Road===
Brisbane Airport has four car-parks, all operating 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. There are two multi-level undercover car parks, the international, providing short and long term services, and the domestic also provides long and short term parking. Qantas and Virgin Australia also offer valet parking at the domestic terminal only. Total car spaces number 9,000.

====Upgrades====
In 2009, to help relieve congestion between Brisbane CBD and the airport, the BrisConnections consortium was formed between Queensland Government, Brisbane City Council, and a Thiess/John Holland/Macquarie Bank to build the Airport Link road project. It included the longest tunnel in Australia at the time of construction (over ; 6 lanes) from the interchange between the Inner City Bypass and Clem Jones Tunnel (the 2nd longest tunnel in Australia when the Airport Link opened) to the Airport Flyover over an improved Southern Cross Way Overpass which leads on to Airport Drive, cutting 16 sets of traffic lights. It was completed in mid-2012.

The Northern Access Road project, completed in December 2009, significantly reduces traffic congestion on Airport Drive. Moreton Drive, the , multi-lane road network, linking Gateway Motorway with the airport terminals, provides airport users with a second major access route to terminals and on-airport businesses.

===Public transport===
====Rail====
The airport has two railway stations as part of a privately owned airport rail line. The International Airport railway station is elevated and located next to the international terminal, as is the Domestic Airport railway station. Both stations are privately owned and operated by the Airtrain Citylink consortium. As a result, fares are more expensive than a regular suburban ticket, though less than half the taxi fare. The Airtrain Citylink travels via the Queensland Rail network to Fortitude Valley and the Brisbane CBD, with most trains continuing to the Gold Coast via South Bank.

====Bus====
There is a free inter-terminal bus connecting the two terminals and the nearby Skygate shopping precinct, DFO and adjacent Novotel Brisbane Airport hotel.

From the Skygate shopping precinct, Translink bus route 590 connects to the rest of Brisbane&#x27;s public transport system.

===Cycling and walking===
Brisbane Airport has cycling and pedestrian connections connecting to the Moreton Bay Bikeway network.

==Future development projects==
===Brisbane Centre===
The Brisbane FIR consists of New South Wales north of Sydney, all of Queensland, most of the Northern Territory and the northern half of Western Australia. It also contains the Australian Tasman Sea airspace. Brisbane Centre is located adjacent to Brisbane Tower at Brisbane Airport. It also contains Brisbane Approach.

Due to the nature of the airspace it controls, most international flights in and out of Australia (except Indian Ocean flights) come under the Brisbane FIR&#x27;s jurisdiction, as well as domestic flights operating to and from airports within the zone. From Brisbane Centre, Airservices Australia manages the airspace over the northern half of Australia, representing 5 per cent of the world&#x27;s total airspace. As only two of eight capitals are located in the Brisbane FIR, it handles a lesser volume of traffic than Melbourne Centre. However, Sydney is on the border of the two FIRs, and thus Brisbane Centre has control of flights arriving or departing in Sydney from the North.

==Traffic and statistics==
Brisbane Airport&#x27;s annual passenger numbers were 23.1 million in 2017. This is expected to grow to around 50 million by 2035.

===Total annual passengers===

===Domestic===
===International===
==Awards==
Brisbane Airport has won a number of awards, including being rated as Australia&#x27;s No. 1 airport for quality of service 10 years in a row (2005–2014 inclusive) in a survey by the Australian Competition &amp; Consumer Commission, and being ranked as 3rd Best Airport in the world (for airports servicing between 20 and 30 million passengers per year). In 2015, it was reported as the fourth-best medium-sized airport for on-time arrivals and departures. The international terminal won the Queensland architecture award. In 2005 Brisbane Airport was awarded the IATA Eagle Award, the second of only two Australian airports to receive such an award.

== Accidents and incidents ==
* On 15 February 2012, a Toll Aviation Fairchild Metro III freighter came to rest on its fuselage at about 2:30 am. Neither of the two pilots were injured. The landing gear on the light plane failed to go down during testing after maintenance.
* On 18 July 2018, a Malaysian Airlines Airbus A330 took off from Brisbane with pitot tube covers still in place, resulting in unreliable airspeed indications and the aircraft diverting back to Brisbane. Airport ground staff had placed covers on the pitot tubes to prevent mud wasps nesting in them (a common hazard at Brisbane Airport), and the pilots, engineers and ground staff failed to check the covers were removed prior to departure.
* On 1 July 2022, an Emirates Airbus A380 performing Flight 430 from Dubai landed at Brisbane Airport with a hole on the left side of its fuselage. A missing bolt and cap was found on the aircraft&#x27;s nose landing gear after it parked. Damage allegedly occurred on takeoff and the pilots reported a blown tire before landing, but investigation is ongoing.

<text>Perote is a city and municipality in the Mexican state of Veracruz. The city serves as the seat of government for the surrounding municipality of the same name, with a population 42,451 inhabitants as 2020, while the municipality population is of 77,432. Perote borders the municipalitys of Las Vigas de Ramírez, Acajete, Xico and Tlalnelhuayocan, and the state of Puebla. It is on Federal Highway 140.
Its climate is cold and dry with an annual average temperature of 12 degrees Celsius.

Perote&#x27;s fortress of San Carlos once served as a prison. Guadalupe Victoria died there.

Also in Perote is the Cofre de Perote shield-shaped volcano (the Nahuatl name of which was &quot;&quot;Naucampatepetl&quot;,&quot; which means &quot;four times lord&quot;).

This town is the home of a sizable Spanish community which immigrated here in the 1930s. Because of this, it is known for Spanish-style cured meats and sausage such as jamón serrano (serrano ham), botifarra (Catalán sausage), and Spanish chorizo sausage.

<text>The Bohemian Grove is a restricted 2,700-acre (1,100-hectare) campground in Monte Rio, California. Founded in 1878, it belongs to a private gentlemen&#x27;s club known as the Bohemian Club. In mid-July each year, the Bohemian Grove hosts a more than two-week encampment of some of the most prominent men in the world.

==History==

The tradition of a summer encampment was established six years after the Bohemian Club was formed in 1872. Henry &quot;Harry&quot; Edwards, a stage actor and founding member, announced that he was relocating to New York City to further his career. On June 29, 1878, somewhat fewer than 100 Bohemians gathered in the Redwoods in Marin County near Taylorville (present-day Samuel P. Taylor State Park) for an evening sendoff party in Edwards&#x27; honor. Freely flowing liquor and some Japanese lanterns put a glow on the festivities, and club members retired at a late hour to the modest comfort of blankets laid on the dense mat of Redwood needles. This festive gathering was repeated the next year without Edwards, and became the club&#x27;s yearly encampment. 

By 1882, the members of the Club camped together at various locations in both Marin and Sonoma counties, including the present-day Muir Woods and a redwood grove that once stood near Duncans Mills, several miles down the Russian River from the current location. From 1893, Bohemians rented the current location, and in 1899 purchased it from Melvin Cyrus Meeker, who had developed a successful logging operation in the area. Gradually over the next decades, members of the Club purchased land surrounding the original location, expanding it to the perimeter of the basin in which it resides.

Writer and journalist William Henry Irwin said of the Grove,
Not long after the club&#x27;s establishment by newspaper journalists, it was commandeered by prominent San Francisco-based businessmen, who provided the financial resources necessary to acquire further land and facilities at the Grove. However, they still retained the &quot;bohemians&quot;—the artists and musicians—who continued to entertain international members and guests.

The Grove is particularly famous for a Manhattan Project planning meeting that took place there in September 1942, which subsequently led to the atomic bomb. Those attending this meeting included Ernest Lawrence, J. Robert Oppenheimer, the S-1 Executive Committee heads, such as the presidents of Harvard, Yale, and Princeton, along with representatives of Standard Oil and General Electric as well as various military officials. At the time, Oppenheimer was not an S-1 member, although Lawrence and Oppenheimer hosted the meeting. Grove members take particular pride in this event and often relate the story to new attendees. 

Former U.S. president Herbert Hoover was inducted into the Old Guard on March 4, 1953; he had joined the club exactly 40 years prior, which is the requirement for the status. Redwood branches from the Grove were flown to the Waldorf Astoria Hotel in New York City, where they were used to decorate a banquet room for the celebration. In his acceptance speech, Hoover compared the honor of the &quot;Old Guard&quot; status to his frequent role as veteran counselor to later presidents.

Other behavior at the campground has led to numerous claims and even some parody in popular culture. One example was President Richard Nixon&#x27;s comments from a May 13, 1971, tape recording talking about upper-class San Franciscans: &quot;The Bohemian Grove, which I attend from time to time—it is the most faggy goddamned thing you could ever imagine, with that San Francisco crowd.&quot;

In 2019, the Sonoma County Board of Supervisors informed the club that after that year, the county would no longer provide law enforcement security.

Despite the high levels of security always present, there have been numerous high-profile successful infiltrations of the Bohemian Grove:

* In the summer of 1980, Rick Clogher gained entrance to the Grove with the help of an employee and posed as a worker during two weekends of the annual encampment. His efforts, the first magazine reporting from inside the Grove, were published in the August 1981 issue of &quot;Mother Jones.&quot; Around the same time, ABC Evening News aired a special report on the Bohemian Grove.
* In the summer of 1989, &quot;Spy&quot; magazine writer Philip Weiss spent seven days in the camp posing as a guest, which led to his November 1989 article &quot;Inside the Bohemian Grove&quot;. He was eventually discovered and arrested for trespassing.
* On July 15, 2000, Alex Jones and his cameraman Mike Hanson clandestinely entered the Bohemian Grove and shot footage of the Cremation of Care ceremony. Jones claimed it was a &quot;ritual sacrifice&quot;. From this footage, documentary filmmaker Jon Ronson produced the episode &quot;The Satanic Shadowy Elite?&quot;, in which he characterizes the proceedings as an &quot;overgrown frat party&quot;, while Jones produced &quot;Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove&quot;, describing what he said were Satanic rituals.
* On January 19, 2002, 37-year-old Richard McCaslin was arrested after his nighttime infiltration of the Bohemian Grove, where he set several fires. He was heavily armed and wearing a skull mask and outfit with &quot;Phantom Patriot&quot; written across the chest.

==Membership and operation==
The Bohemian Club is a private club; only active members and their guests may visit. Guests have been known to include politicians and notable figures from other countries. Particularly during the midsummer encampment, the number of guests is strictly limited due to the small size of the facilities.

The Bohemian Club&#x27;s all-male membership includes artists and musicians, as well as many prominent business leaders, government officials, former U.S. presidents, senior media executives, and people of power. Members may invite guests to the Grove. Guests may be invited to the Grove for either the &quot;Spring Jinks&quot; in June or the main July encampment. Bohemian Club members can schedule private day-use events at the Grove any time it is not being used for Club-wide purposes, and they are allowed at these times to bring spouses, family, and friends, although female and minor guests must be off the property by 9 or 10 pm.

After 40 years of membership, the men earn &quot;Old Guard&quot; status, giving them reserved seating at the Grove&#x27;s daily talks, as well as other perks.

The Club motto is &quot;Weaving Spiders Come Not Here,&quot; which implies that outside concerns and business deals (networking) are to be left outside. When gathered in groups, Bohemians usually adhere to the injunction, although discussion of business often occurs between pairs of members. Important political and business deals have been developed at the Grove. 
===Facilities===

The main encampment area consists of of old-growth redwood trees over 1,000 years old, some over tall.

Sleeping quarters, or &quot;camps&quot;, are also scattered throughout the grove. There were 118 as of 2007. These camps, which are frequently patrilineal, are the principal means through which high-level business and political contacts and friendships are formed.

The preeminent camps are:
*Hill Billies
*Mandalay
*Cave Man
*Stowaway
*Uplifters
*Owls Nest
*Hideaway
*Isle of Aves
*Lost Angels
*Silverado Squatters
*Sempervirens
*Hillside
*Idlewild

The Grove features the following gathering places:
*&quot;Grove Stage&quot; – an amphitheater with seating for 2,000, used primarily for the Grove Play production, on the last weekend of the midsummer encampment. The stage extends up the hillside.
*&quot;Field Circle&quot; – a bowl-shaped amphitheater used for the mid-encampment &quot;Low Jinks&quot; musical comedy, for &quot;Spring Jinks&quot; in early June and for a variety of other performances.
*&quot;Campfire Circle&quot; – has a campfire pit in the center of the circle, surrounded by carved redwood log benches. Used for smaller performances in a more intimate setting.
*&quot;Museum Stage&quot; – a semi-outdoor venue with a covered stage. Lectures and small ensemble performances.
*&quot;Dining Circle&quot; – seating approximately 1,500 diners simultaneously.
*&quot;Clubhouse&quot; – designed by Bernard Maybeck in 1903, completed in 1904 on a bluff overlooking the Russian River; a multi-purpose dining, drinking and entertainment building; the site of the Manhattan Project planning meeting held in 1942.
*&quot;The Owl Shrine and the Lake&quot; – an artificial lake in the interior of the Grove, used for the noon-time concerts and also the venue of the &quot;Cremation of Care&quot;, which takes place on the first Saturday of the encampment. It is also the location of the 12:30 p.m. daily &quot;Lakeside Talks.&quot; These significant informal talks (many on public policy issues) have been given over the years by entertainers, professors, astronauts, business leaders, cabinet officers, Central Intelligence Agency directors, future presidents and former presidents.

===Camp valets===
Camp valets are responsible for the operation of the individual camps. The head valets are akin to general managers at a resort, club, restaurant, or hotel. Service staff include female workers whose presence at the Grove is limited to daylight hours and central areas close to the main gate. Male workers may be housed at the Grove within the boundaries of the camp to which they are assigned or in peripheral service areas. High-status workers stay in small private quarters, but most are housed in rustic bunkhouses.

=== Security ===

The Bohemian Grove is protected by a sophisticated security team year-round. The Bohemian Club employs ex-military personnel to help secure the area. They use high-end security equipment, including thermal/night vision cameras, motion detectors, and vibration sensing alarm systems. The level of security is particularly heightened during the time periods that members are on-site. During these times, the local Sheriff&#x27;s office, California Highway Patrol, and, if warranted by the guest-list, the United States Secret Service help to secure the areas and roads surrounding the encampment.

===Women===
Although no woman has ever been given full membership in the Bohemian Club, the four female honorary members were hostess Margaret Bowman, poet Ina Coolbrith (who served as librarian for the club), actress Elizabeth Crocker Bowers, and writer Sara Jane Lippincott. Since Coolbrith&#x27;s death in 1928, no other woman has been made a member. These honorary members and other female guests have been allowed into the Bohemian &quot;City Club&quot; building and as daytime guests of the Grove, but not to the upper floors of the City Club nor as guests to the main summer encampment at the Grove. Annual &quot;Ladies&#x27; Jinks&quot; were held at the Club especially for spouses and invited guests.

In 2019, Sonoma County Board of Supervisors member Lynda Hopkins, who was elected to the district encompassing the Grove, wrote an open letter criticizing the role the Bohemian Club had in making it difficult for women to get into politics, their lack of investment in the community despite members&#x27; personal wealth, and the anachronistic and hegemonic attitudes she felt described the Grove.

==Traditions, rituals, and symbols==

=== Symbols ===
The club&#x27;s patron saint is John of Nepomuk, who, according to legend, died at the hands of a Bohemian monarch rather than disclose the confessional secrets of the queen. A large wood carving of St. John in cleric robes with his index finger over his lips stands at the shore of the lake in the Grove, symbolizing the secrecy kept by the Grove&#x27;s attendees throughout its long history.

Since the founding of the club, the Bohemian Grove&#x27;s mascot has been an owl, symbolizing wisdom. A hollow owl statue made of concrete over steel supports stands at the head of the lake in the Grove. This statue was designed by sculptor and two-time club president Haig Patigian. It was constructed in the late 1920s. Since 1929, the Owl Shrine has served as the backdrop of the yearly &quot;Cremation of Care&quot; ceremony.

====&quot;Cremation of Care&quot;====
The &quot;Cremation of Care&quot; ceremony is a theatrical production in which some of the club&#x27;s members participate as actors. It was first conducted in 1881. The production was devised by James F. Bowman with George T. Bromley playing the High Priest. It was originally set up within the plot of the serious &quot;High Jinks&quot; dramatic performance on the first weekend of the summer encampment, after which the spirit of &quot;Care&quot;, slain by the Jinks hero, was solemnly cremated. The ceremony served as a catharsis for pent-up high spirits, and &quot;to present symbolically the salvation of the trees by the club ...&quot; The &quot;Cremation of Care&quot; was separated from the other Grove Plays in 1913 and moved to the first night to become &quot;an exorcising of the Demon to ensure the success of the ensuing two weeks.&quot; The Grove Play was moved to the last weekend of the encampment.

The ceremony takes place in front of the Owl Shrine. The moss- and lichen-covered statue simulates a natural rock formation, yet holds electrical and audio equipment within it. For many years, a recording of the voice of club member Walter Cronkite was used as the voice of The Owl during the ceremony.

===Grove Play===
Each year, a Grove Play is performed for one night during the final weekend of the summer encampment. The play is a large-scale musical theatrical production, written and composed by club members, involving some 300 people, including chorus, cast, stage crew and orchestra. The first Grove Play was performed in 1902; for three years during World War II (1943–45) the stage was dark. In 1975, an observer estimated that the Grove Play cost between $20,000 and $30,000, an amount that would be as high as $ in today&#x27;s dollars.
== Court cases ==
=== Women&#x27;s employment ===
In 1978, the Bohemian Club was charged with discrimination by the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing over its refusal to hire female employees. In January 1981, an administrative law judge issued a decision supporting the practices of the club, noting that club members at the Grove &quot;urinate in the open without even the use of rudimentary toilet facilities&quot; and that the presence of females would alter club members&#x27; behavior. However, the judge&#x27;s decision was overruled by the State Fair Employment and Housing Commission, which on October 17, 1981, ordered the club to begin recruiting and hiring women as employees.

The Bohemian Club then filed a petition in California Superior Court, which ruled in favor of the club, finding &quot;the male gender [to be] a bona fide occupational qualification.&quot; It was revealed that the trial judge had previously participated in club activities, yet the request that he be disqualified was denied. The Fair Employment and Housing Commission appealed to the California Court of Appeal which reversed the lower court&#x27;s decision, holding that the Bohemian Club&#x27;s private status did not shield it from the &quot;same rules which govern all California employers.&quot; The Supreme Court of California denied review in 1987, effectively forcing the club to begin hiring female workers during the summer encampment at the Grove in Monte Rio. This ruling became quoted as a legal precedent and was discussed during the 1995–96 floor debate surrounding California Senate Bill SB 2110, a proposed law concerning whether tax-exempt organizations (including fraternal clubs) should be exempt from the Unruh Civil Rights Act.

===Logging===
Outside the central camp area, which is the site of the old-growth grove, but within the owned by the Bohemian Club, logging activities have been underway since 1984. Approximately of lumber equivalents were removed from the surrounding redwood and Douglas fir forest from 1984 to 2007. The club&#x27;s forester, Edward Tunheim, resigned his post in 2006 over club pressure to increase logging. Tunheim was concerned that excessive logging would encourage more brushy undergrowth and thus increase the fire danger.

In 2007, the Bohemian Club board filed an application for a nonindustrial logging permit available to landowners with less than of timberland, which would allow them to steadily increase their logging in the second-growth stands from per year to over the course of the 50-year permit. The board had been advised by Tom Bonnicksen, a retired forestry professor, that they should conduct group selection logging to reduce the risk of fire burning through the dense second-growth stands, damaging the old-growth forest the Club wants to protect.

The Club stated that an expansion of logging activities was needed to prevent fires, and that money made from the sale of the lumber would be used to stabilize access roads and to clear fire-promoting species such as tanoaks and underbrush. The California Department of Fish and Wildlife instead recommended single-tree logging to preserve the habitats of murrelets and spotted owls in senescent trees. Philip Rundel, a University of California, Berkeley professor of biology, said that redwoods are not very flammable and &quot;This is clearly a logging project, not a project to reduce fire hazard&quot;. Reed F. Noss, a professor at the University of California, Davis, has written that fires within redwood forests do not need to be prevented, that young redwoods are adapted to regenerate well in the destruction left behind by the fires typical of the climate.

After controversy raised by opponents of the harvesting plan, the Club moved to establish their qualification for the permit by offering to the Rocky Mountain Elk Foundation in Missoula, Montana, for a conservation easement. A further were written off as not being available for commercial logging, bringing the total to and thereby qualifying for the permit. Opponents and their lawyers interpreted the relevant law as counting all timberland and not just the portion subject to the logging permit. They stated that if the total of timberland is counted, are owned by the Club, so the permit should not be granted.

On March 10, 2011, Judge René A. Chouteau rejected the Non-Industrial Timber Management Plan (NTMP) that the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection had approved. The suit, brought by the Sierra Club and the Bohemian Redwood Rescue Club, sought to have the NTMP annulled. The ruling called on the Bohemian Club to draft a new NTMP offering alternatives to its proposed rate of logging. At present the Bohemian Club is not allowed to log any of its property.

===Wage theft===
In June 2023, a group of former workers sued Bohemian Grove alleging wage theft and unfair labor practices. The club was dismissed from the lawsuit in January 2024 after a judge ruled it did not fit the legal definition of an employer. In May 2024, another lawsuit was filed.

<text>Sir Cornthwaite Hector William James Rason (18 June 1858 – 15 March 1927), better known as Hector Rason, was the seventh Premier of Western Australia.

==Early life==
Rason was born in Cleeve, Somerset, in England on 18 June 1858. He was the son of Cornthwaite Hector Rason (Snr), a Royal Navy surgeon who was the medical officer at York, Western Australia, in 1866 and 1867. Rason (Jnr) was educated at private schools in Eastbourne, Brighton and Reading, and worked as a railway clerk.

==Business career==
In October 1880, Rason emigrated to Perth, Australia, but returned to England after eighteen months. In February 1883, he married Mary E. Terry, and shortly afterwards returned to Western Australia with his wife and her brother, W. R. Terry. Rason and Terry set up business as storekeepers at Toodyay and Guildford, but after a few years Terry returned to England. Rason then went into partnership with a Mr Webster, and attempted to benefit from the gold rushes in the Kimberley and Goldfields regions. Rason also spent some time in Coolgardie trading as a mining engineer and auctioneer. In July 1889, while already a member of the Western Australian Legislative Council, he became the inaugural president of the newly-formed Stock Exchange of Perth. He retired from business in 1891, but was affected by the firm&#x27;s bankruptcy in 1892. From 1893 to 1895 he was a mining agent and auctioneer in Coolgardie, and in 1896 he moved to Mount Magnet. From 1897 to 1898, Rason was Mayor of the Municipality of Guildford.

==Politics==
In January 1889, Rason was elected to the Western Australian Legislative Council for the Swan district. He was a strong supporter of responsible government, and left the Council in October 1890 after responsible government had been established. In 1897 he was elected to the Western Australian Legislative Assembly seat of South Murchison, sitting as a supporter of Sir John Forrest&#x27;s government. In 1898, he was appointed president of the royal commission on mining. The seat of South Murchison was abolished in 1901, and Rason won the Legislative Assembly seat of Guildford in the general elections of April 1901. When George Leake formed his second government in December 1901, Rason was appointed minister for works, holding responsibility for administration of the Coolgardie Water Scheme. Under Walter James&#x27; premiership from July 1902 until August 1904, he was minister for works and railways, and was also treasurer for a few months from April 1904. After Labor took office in August 1904, he became Leader of the Opposition.

Rason became Premier, Treasurer and Minister for Justice on 25 August 1905, after Henry Daglish&#x27;s Labor government was defeated. Like Daglish, Rason did not have a majority of support, but he was granted an early dissolution in October, and easily won the subsequent general election. Later that year he headed the royal commission on immigration.

==Later life==
Rason did not provide firm leadership as premier, and was dogged by family and financial worries. In May 1906 he appointed himself as Agent General for Western Australia in London before resigning as premier to take up the post, an action which drew strong criticism. He held the post until 1911, after which he pursued a business career in Britain. He also became Chairman of the Bode Rubber Estates (1914) Ltd., a company which cultivated natural rubber in British North Borneo. He was made Knight Bachelor in 1909. He died at Beckenham, Kent, in England on 15 March 1927.

<text>Spencer Tunick is an American photographer best known for organizing large-scale nude shoots.

== Early life and education ==
Spencer Tunick was born in Middletown, Orange County, New York into a Jewish family, being the fourth generation of photographers. His grandfather was a photographer of high profile politicians in the United Nations. His father, Earle David Tunick, founded Resort Photo Service, a photography business that photographed private events as well as those of famous politicians, singers, actors, and athletes. His paternal grandmother is a relative of Martin Indyk, the former US ambassador to Israel. 

Tunick studied at the New York Military Academy, and later earned a degree in Fine Arts from Emerson College in 1988.

==Photography==
In 1992, Tunick began documenting live nudes in public locations in New York through video and photographs. His early works from this period focus more on a single nude individual or small groups of nudes. Tunick cites 1994, when he posed and photographed 28 nude people in front of the headquarters of the United Nations in midtown Manhattan, as a turning point in his career; &quot;It all started there, moving my work from just photography into installation and performance photography,&quot; he says. Between 1994 and 2011, he photographed over 75 human installations around the world.

Tunick&#x27;s philosophy is that &quot;individuals en masse, without their clothing, grouped together, metamorphose into a new shape. The bodies extend into and upon the landscape like a substance. These grouped masses which do not underscore sexuality become abstractions that challenge or reconfigure one&#x27;s views of nudity and privacy.&quot;
Sometimes, after gathering his subjects together, Tunick grades them by gender, long hair, age or other characteristics. Registration for modeling on his website includes questions about skin tone. A color chart shows seven boxes ranging from stark white to baby-powder pink and dark chocolate. In his work, he plays off different flesh tones or groups people of the same color. Tunick is also interested in the juxtaposition between the organic and the mechanical, and often chooses famous buildings or unusual structures as his backdrop.
Since 1992, Tunick has traveled the world, capturing both individuals and groups in the nude. In 1994, he produced 75 distinct photographs. In Sydney, Australia, 5,200 volunteer Australians posed nude in 2010, and at the Dead Sea in Israel in 2011, around 1,200 participants paid to join the installation. 

The many volunteers who participate come from diverse societal groups, and by shedding their clothes, they become a single homogeneous entity—an integrated structure stripped of individual identity, social, cultural, economic, or political distinctions. This collective body becomes a living environmental sculpture.

To mark International Women&#x27;s Day on March 8, 2021, the 24th session of the &quot;Stay Apart Together&quot; project saw Tunick and Vanden Broeck collaborate with Mexican-American visual artist Daniela Edburg to depict 75 Latin American women in 11 poses, incorporating the colors purple and green (symbols of the Latin American feminist movement) and hot pink, selected by Edburg for its liveliness.

==Critical reception ==
Mia Fineman, writing for &quot;Slate magazine&quot;, said that there may be an ambiguity in Tunick&#x27;s work between &quot;transgression&quot; and &quot;obedience&quot;. A &quot;regimented&quot; quality has been observed in the arrangement of figures in some of Tunick&#x27;s work, but this may be offset by the social transgression that accrues to public nakedness.

==Documentaries ==
Tunick is the subject of three HBO documentaries, &quot;Naked States&quot;, &quot;Naked World&quot;, and &quot;Positively Naked&quot;. 

He is the also subject of the COVID-19 pandemic documentary film &quot;Stay Apart Together&quot;, directed by Nicole Vanden Broeck and released in 2023, in which Tunick reinvents his photography &quot;to find a way to bring everyone together while staying apart&quot;.

==Major installations==
; 2001
On May 26, 2001, between 2,500 and 3,000 volunteers gathered at the Place des Arts in Montreal, in collaboration with the Musée d&#x27;art contemporain de Montréal. Later, in September 2001, Tunick photographed 400 nude volunteers in Greenwich, London, each side of &quot;Cutty Sark&quot;, and then in a nearby street.
; 2002
On June 30, 2002, 4,000 volunteers got together near the Parque Forestal in Santiago completely naked at 0°. Some people from conservative and Christian background criticized the event and even protested in front of the Palacio de La Moneda after it happened , gathering around 200 people.
; 2003
In April 2003, Tunick was again in London to photograph 160 nude volunteers in front of the Saatchi Gallery at its opening on the South Bank, and later 500 volunteers in a nude photo shoot in Selfridges department store.
In June, he photographed 7,000 naked people in Barcelona, and hundreds of women in New York&#x27;s Grand Central Terminal in October.
; 2004
On June 26, 2004 in Cleveland, he completed his largest installation in the United States, with 2,754 people posing. In August 2004, a photo shoot was completed in Buffalo of about 1,800 nudes in Buffalo&#x27;s old central train station.
; 2005
On July 17, 2005 he photographed almost 1,700 nudes on the quaysides at Newcastle upon Tyne and Gateshead, including the Gateshead Millennium Bridge.
On September 11, 2005, he photographed 1,493 nudes in Lyon on the Rhône quaysides and footbridge resp. between containers. On March 19, 2006, Tunick photographed 1,500 nudes in Caracas, having people standing up, lying down, and on their knees beside the main Simón Bolívar statue.
; 2006
On August 6, 2006 he photographed about 500 nudes in the courtyard of the Museum Kunstpalast in Düsseldorf.
; 2007
In 2007 Spencer Tunick was commissioned by the Dream Amsterdam Foundation to realize art projects for the artistic event &quot;Dream Amsterdam&quot;. On April 15, 2007, Tunick organized an installation in a tulip field in Schermerhorn. On June 3, 2007, he photographed installations with 2000 participants in Amsterdam: 2000 people in a car park; 250 men at a nearby gas station; and 250 women on bicycles on the Lijnbaansgracht — Lauriergracht. A small group of participants was photographed on a canal, Leliegracht, requiring a special bridge construction to create the illusion that the people were floating over the water.
On May 6, 2007, approximately 18,000 people posed for Tunick in Mexico City&#x27;s principal square, the Zócalo, setting a new record, and more than doubling the previous highest number of 7,000 people who had turned out in Barcelona in 2003. Male and female volunteers of different ages stood and saluted, lay down on the ground, crouched in the fetal position, and otherwise posed for Tunick&#x27;s lens in the city&#x27;s massive central plaza, the Plaza de la Constitución. Here, the specific problems of photographing great numbers of people outside became clear: as Tunick could only shoot from buildings located west of the square (the three other sides of the square are government buildings and the cathedral), there was a rush to take the pictures before dawn to avoid getting sunflare in the lens. An accompanying documentary &quot;Naked in Mexico: Spencer Tunick&quot; was also filmed on, and around, the date of the photo shoot.
On August 18, 2007, Tunick used 600 nude people in a &quot;living sculpture&quot; on the Aletsch Glacier in an installation intended to draw attention to global warming and the shrinking of the world&#x27;s glaciers in a collaboration with Greenpeace. The temperature was about . The Aletsch glacier retreated by between 2005 and 2006. The environment-oriented installation was reported in several languages and media outlets around the world, Swiss politicians were playfully encouraged to demonstrate their green credentials by participating in Tunick&#x27;s installation, and Euro RSCG Zurich, Switzerland received the AME Grand Trophy for Public Service and Not-For-Profit, for their campaign for Tunick and Greenpeace Switzerland, &quot;Naked Testimony to Global Warming&quot;.
Tunick followed this installation with one at the Sagamore Hotel in Miami Beach.
; 2008
Tunick announced plans to take photographs in Ernst Happel Stadium in Vienna with 2,008 naked football fans in the run-up to the Euro 2008 tournament.
On June 17, 2008 Tunick carried out an installation in the grounds of Blarney Castle in County Cork with about 1200 people. Another photoshoot was organised for four days later (Saturday June 21) in Dublin, on the South Wall near the Poolbeg Lighthouse, with over 2500 nude people taking part. The South Wall event was somewhat washed out, with one of the proposed set-ups having to be cancelled. However, people praised the organisers for an event well run.
; 2009
On October 3, 2009, Tunick performed another installation in collaboration with Greenpeace, this time to draw attention to the effect climate change is having on French wine production. Over 700 volunteers turned up at a vineyard near Macon, France, for a number of poses among the vines.
; 2010

On March 1, 2010, Tunick carried out a series of installations titled &quot;The Base&quot; on the Sydney Opera House Forecourt and inside the Opera House. The installations were carried out as part of the Sydney Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras and were Tunick&#x27;s first large-scale installation in Sydney, with over 5,200 participants. For the event, the CBC reported that Tunick had invited Lady Gaga to the photo shoot.
In May 2010, Tunick was commissioned by The Lowry to work with 1000 people in five secret locations. The resulting exhibition was called Everyday People, tying into a phrase used by L. S. Lowry in describing his art. The press were allowed a photoshoot at Peel Park, Salford on May 1, but the other locations such as Castlefields, Dantzic Street and Ringway remained unreported.
On August 8, 2010, around 700 revellers at the Big Chill Festival, at Eastnor Castle Deer Park in Herefordshire UK, shed their clothes and covered themselves in five shades of body paint for an installation that paid homage to the art of Yves Klein, Mark Rothko and Ellsworth Kelly, and made reference to the BP oil spillage in the Gulf of Mexico.

Tunick continued to the International Street Theatre Festival in Aurillac, France, where he had been invited to hold an installation for its 25th anniversary. The installation took place over two days, August 20 and 21, 2010. On the first morning, Tunick assembled participants with black umbrellas on a hillside above the town centre, and later with clear umbrellas in the narrow streets of the historic quarter of Aurillac. On the following morning Tunick set out to re-enact Eugène Delacroix&#x27;s &quot;Liberty Leading the People&quot;, with the help of 250 women wielding French flags, 4 men and a smoke machine.
; 2011
On September 17, 2011, Tunick photographed a large group of naked volunteers at the Dead Sea. 1,200 volunteers ranging in age from 20 to somewhere in their sixties set out for the Dead Sea before dawn and modeled in three different arrangements: in the sea, on land and covered in Dead Sea mud.
; 2012
On June 23, 2012, Tunick photographed a group of naked volunteers in Munich, Germany. Tunick was interpreting scenes from the Richard Wagner opera &quot;Der Ring des Nibelungen&quot;. The volunteers were painted in gold or red posing outside the Bavarian State Opera House.
; 2016
On June 4, 2016, Tunick photographed a group of naked volunteers in Bogotá, Colombia. 6,000 volunteers ranging in age from 20 to somewhere in their sixties set out for Bogotá before dawn.
On July 9, 2016, Tunick photographed 3,200 people wearing only blue paint, in Kingston upon Hull, UK. The project was named &quot;Sea of Hull&quot;, and was commissioned by Ferens Art Gallery in recognition of the following year&#x27;s City of Culture events. The gathering was the largest of any of Tunick&#x27;s UK-based projects to date.
On July 18, 2016, Tunick photographed 100 nude women, in Cleveland, Ohio, where the Republican National Convention was being hosted. They held circular Mylar mirrors over their heads and reflected light at the city to expose what they view as the naked truth about Republicans. According to Tunick, the point of the exercise was to &quot;shine the wisdom of women to change the world.&quot;
;2018
In July 2018, Tunick photographed almost 500 men and women draped in sheer red cloths on top of a Woolworths supermarket building in Melbourne, Australia.
In September 2018, Tunick visited Bodø, Norway to create the artwork BODØ BODYSCAPE as part of Bodø Biennale. It was his first project in Norway, and first ever project north of the Arctic Circle.
;2022
In November 2022, Tunick photographed 2500 volunteers dney&#x27;s Bondi Beach. It was done during the skin cancer awareness week, with a charity Skin Check Champions being a collaborator.
;2024
In October 2024, Tunick photograhed over 5500 volunteers on Australia, Brisbane’s Story Bridge, having them pose in many different ways. This installment, titled &quot;Rising Tide&quot;, was a sequel to a smaller photoshoot in 2023 Melt Festival, titled &quot;Tide&quot;. Monique Ross, writing for &quot;The Guardian,&quot; remarked on the diversity, listing &quot;Stocky bodies. Sagging bodies. Tattooed bodies. Transitioning bodies. Scarred bodies. Bony bodies. Pregnant bodies. Chiselled bodies. Bodies needing assistance from a wheelchair, a walker, a pair of crutches&quot;.

<text>The Spirit of St. Louis (formally the Ryan NYP, registration: N-X-211) is the custom-built, single-engine, single-seat, high-wing monoplane that Charles Lindbergh flew on May 20–21, 1927, on the first solo nonstop transatlantic flight from Long Island, New York, to Paris, France, for which Lindbergh won the $25,000 Orteig Prize.

Lindbergh took off in the &quot;Spirit&quot; from Roosevelt Airfield in Garden City, New York, and landed 33 hours, 30 minutes later at Aéroport Le Bourget in Paris, a distance of approximately 3,600 miles (5,800 km). He also flew this aircraft on numerous occasions, delivering mail in and out of the United States. One of the best-known aircraft in the world, the &quot;Spirit&quot; was built by Ryan Airlines in San Diego, California, owned and operated at the time by Benjamin Franklin Mahoney, who had purchased it from its founder, T. Claude Ryan, in 1926. The &quot;Spirit&quot; is on permanent display at the Smithsonian Institution&#x27;s National Air and Space Museum in Washington, D.C.. The exhibit, &quot;Pioneers of Flight,&quot; is closed for renovations until Spring 2025.

==Development==

Officially known as the &quot;Ryan NYP&quot; (for &quot;N&quot;ew &quot;Y&quot;ork to &quot;P&quot;aris), the single-engine monoplane was designed by Donald A. Hall of Ryan Airlines and named the &quot;Spirit of St. Louis&quot; in honor of Lindbergh&#x27;s supporters from the St. Louis Raquette Club in his then hometown of St. Louis, Missouri. To save design time, the NYP was loosely based on the company&#x27;s 1926 Ryan M-2 mailplane, the main difference being the NYP&#x27;s range. As a nonstandard design, the government assigned it the registration number N-X-211 (for &quot;experimental&quot;). Hall documented his design in &quot;Engineering Data on the &quot;Spirit of St. Louis&quot;&quot;, which he prepared for the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA) and is included as an appendix to Lindbergh&#x27;s 1953 Pulitzer Prize winning book &quot;The Spirit of St. Louis&quot;.

B.F. &quot;Frank&quot; Mahoney and Claude Ryan had co-founded the company as an airline in 1925 and Ryan remained with the company after Mahoney bought out his interest in 1926, although there is some dispute as to how involved Ryan may have been in its management after selling his share. It is known, however, that Hawley Bowlus was the factory manager who oversaw construction of the Ryan NYP, and that Mahoney was the sole owner at the time of Donald A. Hall&#x27;s hiring.

The &quot;Spirit&quot; was designed and built in San Diego to compete for the $25,000 Orteig Prize for the first nonstop flight between New York and Paris. Hall and Ryan Airlines staff worked closely with Lindbergh to design and build the &quot;Spirit&quot; in just 60 days. Although what was actually paid to Ryan Airlines for the project is not clear, Mahoney agreed to build the plane for $6,000 and said that there would be no profit; he offered an engine, instruments, etc. at cost. After first approaching several major aircraft manufacturers without success, in early February 1927 Lindbergh, who as a U.S. Air Mail pilot was familiar with the good record of the M-1 with Pacific Air Transport, wired, &quot;Can you construct Whirlwind engine plane capable flying nonstop between New York and Paris ...?&quot;

Mahoney was away from the factory, but Ryan answered, &quot;Can build plane similar M-1 but larger wings... delivery about three months.&quot; Lindbergh wired back that due to competition, delivery in less than three months was essential. Many years later, John Vanderlinde, chief mechanic of Ryan Airlines, recalled, &quot;But nothing fazed B.F. Mahoney, the young sportsman who had just bought Ryan.&quot; Mahoney telegraphed Lindbergh back the same day: &quot;Can complete in two months.&quot;

Lindbergh arrived in San Diego on February 23 and toured the factory with Mahoney, meeting Bowlus, chief engineer Donald Hall, and sales manager A. J. Edwards. After further discussions between Mahoney, Hall and Lindbergh, Mahoney offered to build the &quot;Spirit&quot; for $10,580, restating his commitment to deliver it in 60 days. Lindbergh contributed $2,000 toward the cost of the &quot;Spirit&quot; that he had saved from his earnings as an Air Mail pilot for Robertson Aircraft Corporation. The rest was provided by the Spirit of St. Louis Organization.

Lindbergh was convinced: &quot;I believe in Hall&#x27;s ability; I like Mahoney&#x27;s enthusiasm. I have confidence in the character of the workmen I&#x27;ve met.&quot; He then went to the airfield to familiarize himself with a Ryan aircraft, either an M-1 or an M-2, then telegraphed his St. Louis backers and recommended the deal, which was quickly approved.

Mahoney lived up to his commitment. Working exclusively on the aircraft and closely with Lindbergh, the staff completed the &quot;Spirit of St. Louis&quot; 60 days after Lindbergh arrived in San Diego. Powered by a Wright Whirlwind J-5C 223-hp radial engine, it had a 14 m (46-foot) wingspan, 3 m (10 ft) longer than the M-1, to accommodate the heavy load of 1,610 L (425 gal) of fuel. In his 1927 book &quot;We&quot;, Lindbergh acknowledged the builders&#x27; achievement with a photograph captioned &quot;The Men Who Made the Plane&quot;, identifying: &quot;B. Franklin Mahoney, president, Ryan Airlines&quot;, Bowlus, Hall and Edwards standing with the aviator in front of the completed aircraft.

==Design==
Lindbergh believed that multiple engines resulted in a greater risk of failure while a single-engine design would give him greater range. To increase fuel efficiency, the &quot;Spirit of St. Louis&quot; was also one of the most advanced and aerodynamically streamlined designs of its era.

Lindbergh believed that a flight made in a single-seat monoplane designed around the dependable Wright J-5 Whirlwind radial engine provided the best chance of success. The Ryan NYP had a total fuel capacity of or of gasoline, which was necessary in order to have the range to make the anticipated flight non-stop. The fuel was stored in five fuel tanks, a forward tank – , the main – , and three wing tanks – total of . Lindbergh modified the design of the plane&#x27;s &quot;trombone struts&quot; attached to the landing gear to provide a wider wheelbase in order to accommodate the weight of the fuel.
At Lindbergh&#x27;s request, the large main and forward fuel tanks were placed in the forward section of the fuselage, in front of the pilot, with the oil tank acting as a firewall. This arrangement improved the center of gravity and reduced the risk of the pilot being crushed to death between the main tank and the engine in the event of a crash. This design decision meant that there could be no front windshield, and that forward visibility would be limited to the side windows. This did not concern Lindbergh as he was accustomed to flying in the rear cockpit of mail planes with mail bags in the front. When he wanted to see forward, he would slightly yaw the aircraft and look out the side. To provide some forward vision as a precaution against hitting ship masts, trees, or structures while flying at low altitude, a Ryan employee who had served in the submarine service installed a periscope which Lindbergh helped design. It is unclear whether the periscope was used during the flight. The instrument panel housed fuel pressure, oil pressure and temperature gauges, a clock, altimeter, tachometer, airspeed indicator, bank and turn indicator, and a liquid magnetic compass. The main compass was mounted behind Lindbergh in the cockpit, and he read it using the mirror from a women&#x27;s makeup case which was mounted to the ceiling using chewing gum. Lindbergh also installed a newly developed Earth Inductor Compass made by the Pioneer Instrument Company which allowed him to more accurately navigate while taking account of the magnetic declination of the earth. Lindbergh&#x27;s ultimate arrival in Ireland deviated from his flight plan by just a few miles.

Lindbergh sat in a cramped cockpit which was in width, length, and height. It was so small, Lindbergh could not stretch his legs, nevertheless it was to be his home for nearly two days and nights over the Atlantic. The &quot;Spirit of St. Louis&quot; was powered by a , air-cooled, nine-cylinder Wright J-5C Whirlwind radial engine, by most accounts an exceptionally engineered powerplant by engineer Charles Lawrance. The engine was rated for a maximum operating time of 9,000 hours (more than one year if operated continuously) and had a special mechanism that could keep it clean for the entire New York-to-Paris flight. It was also, for its day, very fuel-efficient, enabling longer flights carrying less fuel weight for given distances. Another key feature of the Whirlwind radial engine was that it was rated to self-lubricate the engine&#x27;s valves for 40 hours continuously. Lubricating, or &quot;greasing,&quot; the moving external engine parts was a necessity most aeronautical engines of the day required, to be done manually by the pilot or ground crew prior to every flight and would have been otherwise required somehow to be done during the long flight.

The engine was built at Wright Aeronautical in Paterson, New Jersey, by a 24-year-old engine builder, Tom Rutledge, who was disappointed that he was assigned to the unknown aviator, Lindbergh. Four days after the flight, he received a letter of congratulations from the Wright management.

The race to win the prize required time-saving design compromises. Donald A. Hall decided that the empennage (tail assembly) and wing control surfaces would not be altered from his original Ryan M-2 design, thus minimizing redesign time that was not available without delaying the flight. The result was less aerodynamic stability; nevertheless, the experienced Lindbergh approved the unaltered design. This setup resulted in a negatively stable design that tended to randomly introduce unanticipated pitch, yaw, and bank (roll) elements into its overall flight characteristics. There is a dispute regarding whether Hall and Lindbergh also preferred this design because they anticipated that the continuous corrections to the random movements of the aircraft would help to keep Lindbergh awake during the estimated 40-hour flight. Whether or not the unstable design was deliberately retained to help fight fatigue, Lindbergh did later write how these random unanticipated movements helped keep him awake at various times during the flight. The stiff wicker seat in the cockpit was also purposely uncomfortable, although custom-fitted to Lindbergh&#x27;s tall and lanky frame.
Lindbergh also insisted that unnecessary weight be eliminated, even going so far as to cut the top and bottom off of his flight map. He carried no radio in order to save weight and because the radios of the period were unreliable and difficult to use while flying solo. Also, although he was an airmail pilot, he refused to carry souvenir letters on the transatlantic journey, insisting that every spare ounce be devoted to fuel. The fuselage was made of treated fabric over a metal tube frame, while the wings were made of fabric over a wood frame. The plywood material that was used to build most of Lindbergh&#x27;s plane was made at the Haskelite Manufacturing Corporation in Grand Rapids, Michigan.

A small, left-facing Indian-style swastika was painted on the inside of the original propeller spinner of the &quot;Spirit of St. Louis&quot; along with the names of all the Ryan Aircraft employees, including Dapper Dan, who designed and built it. It was meant as a message of good luck prior to Lindbergh&#x27;s solo Atlantic crossing as the symbol was often used as a popular good luck charm with early aviators and others. The inside of the original propeller spinner can be viewed at the National Air and Space Museum. This propeller spinner was found to be cracked when Lindbergh arrived at New York prior to his transatlantic flight. A replacement was hastily made in New York to replace the cracked original and was on the aircraft during the transatlantic flight.

== Later history and conservation ==
Lindbergh&#x27;s New York-to-Paris flight made him an instant celebrity and media star. In winning the Orteig Prize, Lindbergh stirred the public&#x27;s imagination. He wrote: &quot;I was astonished at the effect my successful landing in France had on the nations of the world. It was like a match lighting a bonfire.&quot; Lindbergh subsequently flew the &quot;Spirit of St. Louis&quot; to Belgium and England before President Calvin Coolidge sent the light cruiser to bring them back to the United States. Arriving on June 11, Lindbergh and the &quot;Spirit&quot; were escorted up the Potomac River to Washington, D.C., by a fleet of warships, multiple flights of military pursuit aircraft, bombers, and the rigid airship (which was itself a veteran of one of the earliest transatlantic flights), where President Coolidge presented the 25-year-old U.S. Army Reserve aviator with the Distinguished Flying Cross.

On the same day, the U.S Post Office issued a commemorative 10-cent &quot;Lindbergh Air Mail&quot; stamp depicting the &quot;Spirit&quot; over a map of its flight from New York to Paris, and which was also the first stamp issued by the post office that bore the name of a living person.

Over the next 10 months, Lindbergh flew the &quot;Spirit of St. Louis&quot; on promotional and goodwill tours across the United States and Latin America. According to the published log of the &quot;Spirit,&quot; during his 3-month tour of the US, he allowed Major Thomas Lamphier (Commander of the 1st Pursuit Squadron, Selfridge Field) and Lieutenant Philip R. Love (classmate in flight school and colleague of Lindbergh&#x27;s in the airmail service of Robertson Aircraft Corporation) to pilot the &quot;Spirit of St. Louis&quot; for ten minutes each on July 1 and August 8, 1927, respectively. These two are apparently the only persons other than Lindbergh who ever piloted the &quot;Spirit of St. Louis.&quot;

One year and two days after making their first flight at Dutch Flats in San Diego, California, on April 28, 1927, Lindbergh and the &quot;Spirit of St. Louis&quot; flew together for the final time while making a hop from St. Louis to Bolling Field, in Washington, D.C., on April 30, 1928. There he presented the plane to the Smithsonian Institution where for more than eight decades it has been on display, hanging for 48 years (1928–76) in the Arts and Industries Building, and since 1976 hanging in the atrium of the National Air and Space Museum alongside the Bell X-1 and SpaceShipOne. At the time of its retirement, the &quot;Spirit&quot; had made 174 flights, totaling 489:28 hours in the air.

The &quot;Spirit of St. Louis&quot; appears today much as it appeared on its accession into the Smithsonian collection in 1928, except that the gold color of the aircraft&#x27;s aluminum nose panels is an artifact of well-intended early conservation efforts: Not long after the museum took possession of the &quot;Spirit&quot;, conservators applied a clear layer of varnish or shellac to the forward panels in an attempt to preserve the flags and other artwork painted on the engine cowling. This protective coating has yellowed with age, resulting in the golden hue seen today. Smithsonian officials at some point planned to remove the varnish and restore the nose panels to their original silver appearance when the aircraft was to be taken down for conservation,
but later decided that the golden hue on the engine cowling will remain, as it is part of the aircraft&#x27;s natural state after acquisition and during its years on display. The effort to preserve artifacts is not to alter them but to maintain them as much as possible in the state in which the Smithsonian acquired them.

In 2015 the aircraft was lowered to the floor of the museum&#x27;s Milestone&#x27;s gallery, and the tires were temporarily replaced with &quot;forklift&quot; style tires. This was done to preserve the Spirit&#x27;s original tires which, due to age and lessening of vulcanization, are unable to sustain the aircraft&#x27;s weight without disintegration (conservation was also likely undertaken on the wheel assembly itself).

==Further developed types==
NYP-2, an exact duplicate of the &quot;Spirit of St. Louis&quot;, was built 45 days after the transatlantic flight, for the Japanese newspaper &quot;Mainichi&quot;. The NYP-2 carrying serial number 29 was registered as &quot;J-BACC&quot; and achieved a number of record-breaking flights early in 1928 before a crash ended its career.

Although Ryan capitalized on the notoriety of the NYP special, further developments were only superficially comparable to the &quot;Spirit of St. Louis&quot;. An offshoot of the Ryan B-1 Brougham emerged as a five-seater with the same J-5 engine but modified with a conventional cockpit layout and a shorter wingspan. Under the newly restructured B.F. Mahoney Company, further development continued with the six-place Model B-7 utilizing a engine and the Model C-1 with the basic engine.

Shortly after the original &quot;Spirit&quot; was retired in April 1928, the Mahoney Aircraft Corporation presented Lindbergh with a Mahoney Ryan B-1 &quot;Brougham&quot;. In 1928, Mahoney built a B-1X (NX4215) as a gift for Charles Lindbergh.

Pilot Frank Hawks purchased a Mahoney Ryan B-1 Brougham (NC3009) with money from his wife, naming the plane the &quot;Spirit of San Diego.&quot; In the aftermath of the media exposure surrounding Lindbergh&#x27;s transatlantic flight, he flew to Washington with his wife on board to greet the triumphant Lindbergh. Due to the ensuing publicity, Hawks was hired by the Ryan Aircraft company to be its official representative. Hawks went on to tour the country, selling rides in the aircraft &quot;like Lindy flew.&quot;

==Reproductions==

===Airworthy examples===
The Mahoney Ryan B-1 &quot;Brougham&quot; was also used as the basis of a reproduction of the &quot;Spirit of St. Louis&quot;. The reproduction was used in the 1938 Paramount film &quot;Men with Wings&quot; starring Ray Milland.

All three reproductions from the Warner Bros. film &quot;The Spirit of St Louis&quot; (1957) have survived with B-153 on display at the Missouri History Museum, in St. Louis, B-156 is part of the collection at The Henry Ford museum in Dearborn, Michigan, and B-159 belongs to the Cradle of Aviation Museum located in Garden City, Long Island, New York, not far from the site of Roosevelt Field from which the original departed in 1927. According to information at the Henry Ford Museum, their copy (B-156) was actually owned by James Stewart, who portrayed Lindbergh in the film. Stewart is credited as having donated the aircraft to the museum. Lindbergh was reputed to have flown one of the reproductions during the film&#x27;s production, however, the connection to Lindbergh is now considered a myth.
On the 40th anniversary of Lindbergh&#x27;s flight, a new reproduction named &quot;Spirit 2&quot; was built by a movie stunt pilot, Frank Tallman. It first flew on April 24, 1967, and appeared at the 1967 Paris Air Show where it made several flights over Paris. In 1972, &quot;Spirit 2&quot; was bought for $50,000 by the San Diego Air &amp; Space Museum (formerly San Diego Aerospace Museum) and placed on public display until it was destroyed by arson in 1978. The museum built a replacement named &quot;Spirit 3&quot; which first flew on April 28, 1979; it made seven flights before being placed on display. In August 2003, the &quot;Spirit 3&quot; was removed from display and was flown as a 75th Anniversary tribute to Lindbergh. The aircraft is now on display in the museum&#x27;s rotunda.

Through the efforts of both staff and volunteers, the Experimental Aircraft Association in Oshkosh, Wisconsin produced two reproductions of the &quot;Spirit of St. Louis&quot;, powered by Continental R-670-4 radial engines, the first in 1977 (of which was to be based on a conversion from a B-1 Brougham; the aircraft proved to be too badly deteriorated to be used in that manner), flown by EAA founder Paul Poberezny to commemorate the 50th anniversary of Lindbergh&#x27;s flight across the Atlantic Ocean and subsequent tour of the United States. This example is now on display in the main museum gallery. A second reproduction, started from scratch in 1977 and first flown in November 1990, continues to fly at air shows and commemorative events. Both of the EAA reproductions were registered under the original&#x27;s N-X-211.

Another airworthy reproduction was built by David Cannavo and first flown in 1979, powered by a Lycoming R-680 engine. In 1995, it was bought by Kermit Weeks for his Fantasy of Flight Museum in Polk City, Florida.

A reproduction of the &quot;Spirit&quot; (Registration ES-XCL), which had been built and certified in Estonia in 1997, was written off on May 31, 2003. Shortly after takeoff at an air show in Coventry, England, structural failure occurred, resulting in a fatal crash, killing its owner-pilot, Captain Pierre Holländer. 

A recently completed &quot;Spirit&quot; reproduction, intended for airworthiness is owned by the Old Rhinebeck Aerodrome (ORA), fulfilling a lifelong dream of its primary founder, Cole Palen (1925–1993). The reproduction project had been started by Cole before his own death and has mostly been subsequently built by former ORA pilot and current vintage aircraft maintenance manager Ken Cassens, receiving its wing covering, completed with doped fabric in 2015. A restored Wright J-5 Whirlwind radial was obtained by Palen in the 1970s for the project&#x27;s start, with original, and still-functional 1920s-era flight instruments being incorporated — including the same basic type of earth inductor compass used by Lindbergh — matching the ones in the original &quot;Spirit&quot; at the NASM.

This reproduction aircraft successfully flew in early December 2015 in upstate New York, piloted by aircraft restorer/builder Ken Cassens of Stone Ridge, New York. The aircraft made its public debut flight on May 21, 2016, the 89th anniversary of Lindbergh&#x27;s flight.

JNE Aircraft&#x27;s reproduction

Over a period of 7 years and 3 months, John Norman of Burlington, Washington crafted to-date the most authentic &quot;Spirit&quot; reproduction ever built. With the intention of creating a copy of the aircraft &quot;as it sits now,&quot; with all the patches, updates or modifications recreated in pains-taking detail and the added bonus of being airworthy Norman completed the project in 2019. The maiden flight was performed July 28, 2019 and the public debut flight was September 8, piloted by John&#x27;s friend and seasoned pilot, Ron Fowler.

In 2015, with coordinated efforts by fellow &quot;Spirit&quot; researcher Ty Sundstrom and the National Air &amp; Space Museum, Norman took detailed measurements to correct errors he had discovered in the existing &quot;Morrow&quot; drawings. During the same trip, in an attempted search for Lindbergh&#x27;s missing logbook, Norman used a video boroscope to inspect never-before seen areas of the fuselage and discovered an original pair of pliers thought to have been used by Lindbergh to adjust the fuel valves during flight.

In late 2021, a documentary feature film centered on the project and its builder began production. A tentative summer 2023 release is expected.

===Static display examples===
A 90% static reproduction, built in 1956 for &quot;The Spirit of St Louis&quot; film by studio employees, is now on display at the Wings of the North Air Museum in Eden Prairie, MN. In 1999, the San Diego Air &amp; Space Museum built a non-flying example that was fitted with an original Wright J-5 engine. It is on display at San Diego International Airport. A static reproduction of the &quot;Spirit of St. Louis&quot; was built in 2002 and is on display at St. Louis Lambert International Airport. The Octave Chanute Aerospace Museum at Rantoul, Illinois also has a static reproduction built by museum volunteers. Two reproductions are also found in Germany, one at the Frankfurt International Airport with the second in the &quot;Luftfahrtmuseum Hannover&quot;.

<text>Philip David Segal (born in Southend-on-Sea, Essex, England in 1962) is a British-American television producer. He emigrated to the United States &quot;at the age of fifteen or sixteen&quot;, where he gained a degree in Telecommunications from San Diego State University. After graduating he started work in the US television industry, first as a casting assistant and then as a literary agent, working at Fenton Feinberg Casting and the ICM TV Literary Department training program.

In 1985, he was appointed Director of Drama Development at Columbia Pictures. He then moved to ABC Television as a programming executive, and says he worked on shows such as &quot;Twin Peaks&quot;, &quot;Thirtysomething&quot; and &quot;China Beach&quot;.

In 1989, he went to the BBC where he had a chat about the TV industry and asked about work on different shows, one of the ones he was most interested in was science fiction series &quot;Doctor Who&quot;. A week later, plans for a 1990 season of &quot;Doctor Who&quot; were aborted while the BBC searched for an American company to make a new series as a joint venture.

In 1991, he joined Steven Spielberg&#x27;s Amblin Entertainment, where he became Vice President of Amblin Television, overseeing the production of &quot;seaQuest DSV&quot;, &quot;Earth 2&quot; and &quot;The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles&quot;.

Segal contacted the BBC, applying for the distribution rights of a new series of &quot;Doctor Who&quot; under Amblin. Collaborating with fellow English expatriate Peter Wagg (producer of &quot;Max Headroom&quot;) they created the early drafts of what eventually became the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; television movie in 1996. Segal received an executive producer credit on the movie. In 2000, Segal co-wrote the book &quot;Doctor Who: Regeneration&quot; with Gary Russell (HarperCollins, ), the making-of book about the movie.

Segal won the best director of a short film award from the NY International Film &amp; Video Festival in 2000 for his short story The Other Side of Monday. Other directing credits include: a single episode of &quot;Mutant X&quot; according to IMDB and one episode of &quot;Andromeda&quot; for the Tribune Action Hours, and the feature film &quot;Hobbs End&quot; which he also co-wrote with Eric Truheart. In 2000 he became senior VP for scripted programming and development at Tribune Entertainment, overseeing &quot;Andromeda&quot;, &quot;Beastmaster&quot; and other shows.

After a period working at Bunim-Murray Productions as Executive Vice-President, Segal joined Original Productions in 2006 as an executive producer. He was appointed Chief Executive Officer of Original in 2012 but left the company in 2017 when Original&#x27;s parent company, Fremantle, decided not to renew his contract. His credits include &quot;Ice Road Truckers&quot; and &quot;Ax Men&quot; for &quot;The History Channel&quot;, &quot;The Colony&quot;, &quot;Pitchmen&quot;, &quot;&quot; for Discovery Channel, &quot;1000 Ways to Die&quot; for Spike, &quot;Black Gold&quot; for Tru TV, &quot;Wildlife Warriors&quot; and &quot;Cut in Half&quot; for National Geographic Channel, and &quot;Storage Wars&quot; for A&amp;E. Segal lives in Glendale, California and in Medford, Oregon.

<doc id="358999" wikidata="Q3276647" url="?curid=358999" title="Difference feminism">
<text>Difference feminism is a term developed during the equality-versus-difference debate in American feminism to describe the view that men and women are different, but that no value judgment can be placed upon them and both sexes have equal moral status as persons.

Most strains of difference feminism did not argue that there was a biological, inherent, ahistorical, or otherwise &quot;essential&quot; link between womanhood and traditionally feminine values, habits of mind (often called &quot;ways of knowing&quot;), or personality traits. These feminists simply sought to recognize that, in the present, women and men are significantly different and to explore the devalued &quot;feminine&quot; characteristics. This variety of difference feminism is also called gender feminism. 

However, some forms of difference feminism – such as Mary Daly&#x27;s cultural feminism – argue that women and their values are superior to those of men. There is ongoing debate about whether Daly&#x27;s feminism is essentialist.

== History ==
The &quot;difference&quot; feminist view was developed in the 1980s, in part as a reaction to popular liberal feminism (also known as &quot;equality feminism&quot;), which emphasized the similarities between women and men in order to argue for equal treatment for women. Difference feminism, although it still aimed at equality between men and women, emphasized the differences between men and women and argued that identicality or sameness are not necessary in order for men and women, and masculine and feminine values, to be treated equally. Liberal feminism aimed to make society and law gender-neutral, since it saw recognition of gender difference as a barrier to rights and participation within liberal democracy, while difference feminism held that gender-neutrality harmed women &quot;whether by impelling them to imitate men, by depriving society of their distinctive contributions, or by letting them participate in society only on terms that favor men&quot;.

Difference feminism drew on earlier nineteenth-century strains of thought, for example the work of German writer Elise Oelsner, which held that not only should women be allowed into formerly male-only spheres and institutions (e.g. public life, science) but that those institutions should also be expected to change in a way that recognizes the value of traditionally devalued feminine ethics, like care. On the latter point, many feminists have re-read the phrase &quot;difference feminism&quot; in a way that asks &quot;what difference does feminism make?&quot; (e.g. to the practice of science) rather than &quot;what differences are there between men and women&quot;?

In the 1990s, feminists addressed the binary logic of &quot;difference&quot; versus &quot;equality&quot; and moved on from it, notably with postmodern and/or deconstructionist approaches that either dismantled or did not depend on that dichotomy.

== Criticism ==
Some have argued that the thought of certain prominent second-wave feminists, like psychologist Carol Gilligan and radical feminist theologian Mary Daly, is essentialist. In philosophy, essentialism is the belief that &quot;(at least some) objects have (at least some) essential properties&quot;. In the case of sexual politics, essentialism is taken to mean that &quot;women&quot; and &quot;men&quot; have fixed essences or essential properties (e.g. behavioral or personality traits) that cannot be changed. However, essentialist interpretations of Daly and Gilligan have been questioned by some feminist scholars, who argue that charges of &quot;essentialism&quot; are often used more as terms of abuse than as theoretical critiques based on evidence, and do not accurately reflect Gilligan or Daly&#x27;s views.

== In France ==
Commonly labeled &quot;French feminism&quot;, the work of Hélène Cixous, Luce Irigaray and Julia Kristeva has been considered a form of difference feminism. Their psychoanalytic approach to sexual difference perceived the search for equality as a phallocentric erasure of the specificities of the female body. Like the American differentialist authors, &quot;French feminists are regularly accused of essentialism.&quot;

<doc id="359002" wikidata="Q3344188" url="?curid=359002" title="Legazpi Airport">
<text>Legazpi Airport was a major airport in the Bicol Region, served the vicinity of Legazpi, the capital city of Albay in the Philippines.

Prior to its closure, the airport was designated as a Class 1 principal domestic airport by the Civil Aviation Authority of the Philippines, a body of the Department of Transportation responsible for the operations of most airports in the Philippines.

The airport was replaced by the new and larger Bicol International Airport in 2021.

==History==
The site of the former Legazpi Airport used to be the Sanborn Field. This former US airfield opened in the early 1900s. During World War II, the airport was occupied by Japanese forces from 1941 until the airport was liberated by the United States Army in 1945. Commercial operations started the following year.

The jet age came to Legazpi in the late 1960s and by the 1970s Philippine Airlines (PAL) introduced regular service to/from Manila using British Aircraft Corporation&#x27;s BAC 1-11s. In the late 1980s PAL introduced Boeing 737-300s. YS-11s provided airlink to Mactan, Cebu, Masbate, and Virac. When PAL phased out the YS-11s and the short-lived Shorts SD-360 &#x27;Sunriser,&#x27; Fokker 50s replaced them. Before the debilitating labor strike in 1998 which caused PAL to temporarily cease operation, Legazpi Airport served as the airline&#x27;s hub in Bicol, serving Manila, Cebu, Masbate, Virac, even Catarman in Samar. Today, it serves local clients and transient passengers from southern Camarines Sur and the province of Sorsogon.

Aside from PAL, Filipinas Orient Airways and Air Manila International served the airport before 1972, the declaration of martial law in the Philippines. Through the years, other airlines came and went: Air Philippines for some time served Legazpi with YS-11s and 737-200s. Asian Spirit served Pili for flights to/from Manila and Cebu and has since ceased operations with six million pesos in collectibles from local (Naga or Pili) franchisees. Asian Spirit also planned to introduce flights to Virac and Masbate before its rebranding as Zest Airways. At present, Aboitiz cargo regularly calls on Legazpi. South East Asian Airlines, using the 19-seat LET-410. plies Cebu-Legazpi-Cebu Mondays and Fridays.

When Pope John Paul II visited the Philippines in 1981, his itinerary included the city of Legazpi. The papal plane was a chartered PAL Boeing 727 tri-jet. President Ferdinand Marcos arrived in his own jet; First Lady Imelda and the then-Minister of Defense, Juan Ponce Enrile, arrived with their own retinues on separate jets.

In the mid-1990s, a Harrier jumpjet of the US Marines made an emergency landing here. Nearby Alicia Hotel housed the unexpected guests for days while the aircraft was repaired. During that time, day and night, the airport site became an aviation museum of sorts with curious on-lookers taking a glimpse at the heavily guarded fighter plane, exactly the same piece used in the Schwarzenegger film &quot;True Lies&quot;.

In February 2000, during a lull in nearby Mayon Volcano&#x27;s eruption (which suspended regular commercial service), a chartered Boeing 727 from Guam landed, bringing relief goods for evacuees.

On September 15, 2001, coming home from her state visit to Japan, President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo flew to Legazpi non-stop from Tokyo using a chartered PAL Airbus A320, highlighting the capability of the airport to handle international air traffic. On November 26, 2003, a Cebu Pacific DC-9-32 brought delegates to the Philippine Institute of Certified Public Accountants (PICPA) convention on a charter flight from Cebu.

===Upgrades===

In 2015, the passenger terminal building was refurbished and expanded under a refurbishment program funded by the Civil Aviation Authority of the Philippines.

Although operating as sunrise-sunset (SR-SS) due to lack of an instrument landing system (ILS), the airport can handle night landings and take-off but only on prior notice. The fact that the airfield does not have an ILS system leads to flights being delayed and/or cancelled because the airfield cannot operate in inclement weather without an ILS system. Evening flights began in 2016 after upgrades to the airport facilities, with Cebu Pacific being the first airline to operate night flights.

===Closure===
As early as 1996, plans were laid to construct an international airport in the neighboring municipality of Daraga, which would replace Legazpi Airport. Construction of the larger Bicol International Airport was slated to open by 2014 but was repeatedly delayed.

The airport had its last flight on October 7, 2021, and closed on the same day. After the closure, the airport site is planned to be converted into a business district.

==Structure==
===Runway===

The airport had a single runway which was long and wide. The runway was longer than those of the now-defunct Bacolod City Domestic Airport () and Mandurriao Airport in Iloilo City (). It runs in a direction of 06/24.

===Terminal and apron===
The passenger terminal building at Legazpi Airport had the capacity of more than 500 passengers. After its refurbishment in 2015, separate arrival and pre-departure areas for domestic and international chartered flights were added to the terminal building, including office space for the Bureau of Immigration, customs and quarantine, and the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency.

The airport could handle medium-sized civilian jets and military aircraft. Its apron has the capacity of three aircraft.

<doc id="359003" wikidata="Q3444162" url="?curid=359003" title="Remembrance of the Daleks">
<text>Remembrance of the Daleks is the first serial of the 25th season of the British science fiction television series &quot;Doctor Who&quot;. The serial was first broadcast in four weekly episodes from 5 to 26 October 1988. It was written by Ben Aaronovitch and directed by Andrew Morgan. The serial contains many references to the history of the show, featuring settings from the first &quot;Doctor Who&quot; episode, &quot;An Unearthly Child&quot;, such as Coal Hill School and the junkyard at 76 Totter&#x27;s Lane.

In the serial, alien time traveller the Doctor and his companion Ace travel back to 1963 to retrieve the Hand of Omega, a powerful device created by the Time Lords, and keep it from the Daleks. The serial is the final appearance of the Daleks in the original run and the only occasion in which the Seventh Doctor encountered them on television.

In reader polls conducted by &quot;Doctor Who Magazine&quot; from 1998 onwards, &quot;Remembrance of the Daleks&quot; has consistently been voted as one of the greatest &quot;Doctor Who&quot; stories.

==Plot==

The Seventh Doctor and Ace arrive in Shoreditch in 1963. They meet a military unit led by Group Captain Gilmore and Sergeant Smith, tracking abnormal local magnetic fluctuations, originating mainly from Coal Hill School where a transmat device in its basement is tied to a Dalek ship in geostationary orbit. A second, weaker fluctuation is emitted by a nearby Dalek. There are two Dalek factions: Imperial Daleks on the orbiting mothership, controlling the school, and Renegade Daleks, who reject the Emperor&#x27;s authority, controlling the junkyard. Both sides seek the Hand of Omega, a Time Lord device the Doctor left on Earth during his first visit to 1963.

Smith is a secret associate of Ratcliffe, leader of a group of fascists, reporting to a Renegade battle computer, which uses a schoolgirl as its eyes and ears. The Doctor has the Hand buried in a local cemetery, but Ratcliffe finds it, tipped off by Smith. Imperial Daleks arrive to seize it from the Renegades, but the Doctor and Ace defeat them and destroy their transmat. Anticipating a siege, the Doctor has Gilmore fortify the school while he disables the Renegade &quot;time controller&quot;, fleeing with Daleks in pursuit, returning to the school just as the Imperial Daleks land. The Imperials eventually defeat the Renegades after deploying a Special Weapons Dalek, wiping out all but a Supreme Dalek, allowing Ratcliffe and Smith to escape with the controller, pursued by the schoolgirl, who kills Ratcliffe.

The Imperial Daleks take the Hand to the mothership, leaving for their home planet, Skaro. Ace follows Smith to recover the controller. The Doctor establishes communication with the Dalek Emperor, who is really their creator, Davros, who means to destroy the Time Lords with the Hand. The Doctor mocks him but then feigns fear. Davros launches the Hand, Skaro&#x27;s sun goes supernova, and Skaro is destroyed, the force of the explosion also destroying the mothership. The Hand returns to Gallifrey, and Davros flees.

Smith captures Ace, but the schoolgirl finds them and kills Smith. The Doctor persuades the Supreme Dalek to relinquish control of the girl. The Supreme Dalek self-destructs, and the girl screams and faints, but is still alive. At Smith&#x27;s funeral, The Doctor and Ace slip away contemplating that time will tell if they &quot;did good&quot;.

===Continuity===
An undertaker says that he thought the Doctor was supposed to be an &quot;old geezer with white hair,&quot; referring to his first incarnation.

==Production==

===Conception and writing===

Producer John Nathan-Turner wanted to start &quot;Doctor Who&quot; twenty-fifth anniversary season &quot;with a bang&quot;, a story with the Doctor&#x27;s most famous adversaries, the Daleks. Nathan-Turner and script editor Andrew Cartmel hired 25 year old Ben Aaronovitch to write the story, who had not written for television before. He initially developed a story idea which later became &quot;Battlefield&quot; (1989), before Cartmel then commissioned Aaronovitch to write the Dalek story, originally titled &quot;Nemesis of the Doctor&quot;. According to deals made with Terry Nation, the creator of the Daleks, he had to approve a Dalek story if he was not writing it. Despite initial concerns, the storyline was approved. One of Cartmel&#x27;s goals with the story was to have the Doctor be a commanding centre, rather than being &quot;pushed and pulled&quot; by the story as he felt had been happening recently. As such, Aaronovitch wanted there to be a spirit of the Doctor just wanting to tackle the Daleks. Two of the first things Aaronovitch thought of when creating the story was the 1963 setting and a Dalek climbing up stairs. He decided to reveal the Daleks in the middle of the first episode instead of as its cliffhanger, and then have a Dalek levitating up stairs to surprise viewers. The inability of Daleks to climb stairs was an urban myth and a joke, with the Doctor even joking about it in &quot;Destiny of the Daleks&quot; (1979). &quot;Remembrance&quot; was intended to put it to rest, though Cartmel noted that the joke was still prevalent. The Dalek civil war seen in &quot;Remembrance&quot; was intended to be an outcome of the previous Dalek story, &quot;Revelation of the Daleks&quot; (1985). Aaronovitch felt that destroying Skaro at the end seemed like a logical conclusion, but he noted that it might not be the best decision in the long run.

&quot;Remembrance of the Daleks&quot;, the first story in &quot;Doctor Who&quot; twenty-fifth anniversary season, contains many references to the series&#x27; past, something Aaronovitch felt was fun. It is set in the same time and place as the programme&#x27;s first episode, &quot;An Unearthly Child&quot;, where Coal Hill School employed original companions Ian and Barbara and the Doctor&#x27;s granddaughter Susan was enrolled. The Totter&#x27;s Lane junkyard also reappears, as it had in season 22&#x27;s &quot;Attack of the Cybermen&quot;, though &quot;I.M. Foreman&quot; is misspelled &quot;I.M. Forman&quot;. It originally read &quot;L.M.&quot;, though that was changeable in production. In one of the classrooms, Ace picks up a book on the French Revolution just as Susan had in &quot;An Unearthly Child&quot;; Aldred studied the original to try to mimic Carole Ann Ford&#x27;s stature. The Doctor references the events of &quot;The Dalek Invasion of Earth&quot; (1964), &quot;Genesis of the Daleks&quot; (1975), &quot;Terror of the Zygons&quot; (1975), and &quot;The Web of Fear&quot; (1968), as well as likening a device to something he used in &quot;Planet of the Daleks&quot; (1973). The Doctor mistakenly calls Group Captain Gilmore &quot;Brigadier&quot;, a reference to Brigadier Lethbridge-Stewart, who had headed UNIT, an organisation similar to Gilmore&#x27;s. Rachel, a scientific advisor from Cambridge, is similar to Liz Shaw, and she shares a conversation with Gilmore that is reminiscent of a conversation between the Brigadier and Liz in &quot;Spearhead from Space&quot; (1970). Rachel also bears a physical resemblance to Barbara. &quot;Remembrance of the Daleks&quot; is also contains a meta-reference; a television continuity announcer says, &quot;This is BBC television, the time is quarter past five and Saturday viewing continues with an adventure in the new science fiction series &quot;Doc&quot;—&quot;, but is cut off by a scene change before completing the title. Aaronovitch &quot;couldn&#x27;t resist&quot; the reference, and clarified that it was meant as a joke and was not to be taken seriously. Originally, it was intended that the show that was introduced would be called &quot;Professor X&quot;. Alison and Rachel make mention of a &quot;Bernard&quot; from the &quot;British Rocket Group&quot;. This is a reference to Bernard Quatermass and his British Experimental Rocket Group, of the Nigel Kneale-penned &quot;Quatermass&quot; science-fiction television serials.
Several scenes from &quot;Remembrance of the Daleks&quot; were cut or edited in production. McCoy&#x27;s favourite scene, in which the Doctor muses to a worker at a café, was cut by about half. As originally shot, Ace defused the tension between her and the Doctor when he left her at the boarding house. Also cut was the Doctor curing Ace&#x27;s leg at the beginning of the third episode, and the issuing of instructions from the Dalek controller through an earpiece. In a notable deleted line, the Doctor tells Davros that he is &quot;far more than just another Time Lord&quot;. This, along with the Doctor&#x27;s hints that he was present at the creation of the Hand of Omega, was part of the so-called &quot;Cartmel Masterplan&quot; by script editor Andrew Cartmel to restore some of the mystery to the Doctor&#x27;s origins. However, as the programme ceased production in 1989, the intended revelations never came to pass. The original script also had the Doctor blowing up a Dalek with the anti-tank missile in episode two, but McCoy felt this was out of character and suggested Ace should do it instead.

===Casting===

To protect the secret of Davros&#x27; presence in the story, Terry Molloy was credited in part three under an anagram, &quot;Roy Tromelly&quot;. Ian Ogilvy was approached for the role of Gilmore, but did not accept; Neil Stacy was also considered. The role went to Simon Williams, who was known for his role as James Bellamy in &quot;Upstairs, Downstairs&quot;. Sophie Aldred and Karen Gledhil, who had watched the programme when they were younger, were awed to work with him. Williams had trouble handling the character&#x27;s gun and also misunderstood a stage direction in the script describing it, which earned him the nickname of &quot;Chunky&quot;. This nickname was carried on into the character, with McCoy adding the line, &quot;...why his men call him &#x27;Chunky&#x27; I&#x27;ve no idea.&quot;

The computer was voiced by John Leeson, who previously played K-9. Leeson was asked to make his voice sound like Davros&#x27;, to trick viewers into thinking the computer was Davros, and watched past episodes for reference. Michael Sheard was chosen to play the headmaster as he would be familiar to children. Sheard had to be released from his work on &quot;Grange Hill&quot; to participate; Peter Tilbury was briefly considered for the role if Sheard could not make it. Sheard had previously appeared in &quot;The Ark&quot; (1966), &quot;The Mind of Evil&quot; (1971), &quot;Pyramids of Mars&quot; (1975), &quot;The Invisible Enemy&quot; (1977), and &quot;Castrovalva&quot; (1982). Peter Halliday, who played the blind Vicar, had also appeared in various &quot;Doctor Who&quot; stories. Stratford Johns, who had previously appeared in &quot;Four to Doomsday&quot;, was originally considered for Ratcliffe. Mark McGann, the brother of Eighth Doctor actor Paul McGann, was originally considered for the role of Mike Smith. Pamela Salem had roles in two Fourth Doctor serials, as one of the Xoanon voices in &quot;The Face of Evil&quot;, and as Toos in &quot;The Robots of Death&quot; (1977). Simon Williams, Karen Gledhill, and Pamela Salem reprised their roles in this serial in an audio spin-off series for Big Finish titled &quot;Counter-Measures&quot;, which details the adventures of the group after this story.

&quot;Remembrance of the Daleks&quot; was the first story in which Ace was a regular companion, having joined at the end of &quot;Dragonfire&quot;. Cartmel worked with Aldred to make Ace different from most companions: less of a &quot;screamer&quot; and more tomboyish. Aldred recalled that taking on the Daleks made her feel like a &quot;real assistant&quot;. Aldred did many of her own stunts, bonding with the new stunt coordinator, Tip Tipping. She found the experience &quot;terrifying&quot; at first. Aldred has said that she is proud of the scene where Ace beats up a Dalek with a baseball bat, calling it one of the best things she has done in her life. Aldred was also trained in firing guns for the scene where she shoots a Dalek.

===Filming and effects===

The director, Andrew Morgan, wanted to improve upon his last effort, &quot;Time and the Rani&quot; (1987). Feeling that the script was worth it, extra money was put into the production. However, production went over-budget by £13,000, and as a result Morgan was barred from directing for the programme again. Filming took place in April 1988. St John&#x27;s School in Hammersmith was used as Coal Hill School. The Kew Bridge Steam Museum in Brentford was used as the I.M. Forman junkyard. Filming at this location was occasionally interrupted by a radio traffic news helicopter circling overhead. John Nodes Funeral Service in Ladbroke Grove, London was used for the funeral parlour the Doctor retrieves the Hand of Omega from, and the graveyard where he buries the Hand is Willesden Lane Cemetery. The cemetery filming was attended by some &quot;Doctor Who&quot; fans who came to watch.

For the levitating Dalek, a scaffolding was built over the stairs, and the Dalek prop was placed in a tray that was hoisted up by a rail-mounted trolley. Two of the six Renegade Daleks were reused props from the 1960s. Imperial Daleks were built with bigger wheels that would roll easier on location. Aaronovitch expected the Dalek ship to be cheap-looking and achieved with colour-separation overlay, and was surprised when a model ship was constructed and &quot;landed&quot; with the help of a crane. For the final battle sequence between the Renegade and Imperial Daleks, the BBC Effects Department&#x27;s pyrotechnics were so loud and the explosions so realistic that the London Fire Brigade was dispatched to the scene by local residents who feared that an IRA bomb had gone off. McCoy recalled that after the first explosions, a number of car alarms in the neighbourhood went off, and the emergency services drivers were surprised when they arrived to see Daleks coming at them from out of the smoke. The junkyard gate was part of ITV&#x27;s storage facility, and the pyrotechnics not only destroyed it for the effect of the Special Weapons Dalek blowing it up, but also smashed windows in the nearby building. A thermal imaging camera was used for Dalek perspective shots.

===Post-production===
The first episode begins with a cold open, the second serial to have a specially-shot pretitles sequence after &quot;Time and the Rani&quot; (1987), though &quot;Castrovalva&quot; (1982) began with a reprise of &quot;Logopolis&quot; (1981) and &quot;The Five Doctors&quot; (1983) featured a clip from &quot;The Dalek Invasion of Earth&quot; (1964) before the title sequence. &quot;Remembrance&quot; cold open features a shot of the Earth with audio clips from 1963, including John F. Kennedy&#x27;s American University speech and Martin Luther King Jr.&#x27;s &quot;I Have a Dream&quot; speech. Other clips from the early 60s were planned but did not make the final cut. Many songs from the time period can be heard in the background during several scenes in the serial.

==Themes and analysis==
James Chapman, in his book &quot;Inside the TARDIS&quot; (2006), reported that the plot to revisit the Doctor&#x27;s past and origins has been compared to a comic book trend in the 1980s to reinterpret the origin stories of comic-book characters. He also noted that the many continuity references in the story displayed a knowledge of the series&#x27; history, but that &quot;Remembrance of the Daleks&quot; was &quot;neither a celebration of the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; legacy&quot; like &quot;The Five Doctors&quot; (1983), &quot;nor an exercise in fan-obsessive continuity&quot; as was displayed in &quot;Attack of the Cybermen&quot; (1985).

The battle between Dalek factions has been likened to racism, which is apparent in the 1960s setting as Ace sees a sign that says &quot;No Coloureds&quot;. The subtext was intentional, as Aaronovitch drew on the Daleks&#x27; Nazi theme and applied it to the setting. Cartmel was particularly proud of the scene and, when it was screened to BBC Head of Drama Mark Shivas, rewound the tape because Shivas had missed the sequence due to a phone call. Shivas felt that Ace should have torn the sign up, and Cartmel agreed it was a missed opportunity.

==Broadcast and reception==



This was the first time the programme was transmitted – albeit only in the London region – with NICAM stereo sound.

Reviews were mostly positive. Paul Cornell, Martin Day, and Keith Topping wrote in &quot;The Discontinuity Guide&quot;, &quot;The best &quot;Doctor Who&quot; story in some considerable time, &quot;Remembrance of the Daleks&quot; reintroduced mystery and magic into the series with much intelligence and revisionist continuity&quot;. &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; reviewer Christopher Bahn, despite noting that the production had not aged well visually, called &quot;Remembrance of the Daleks&quot; &quot;the Seventh Doctor era at its best&quot;. He was positive towards how going back to &quot;An Unearthly Child&quot; allowed Aaronovitch and Cartmel to &quot;showcase their new, more devious master-planner version of the Doctor&quot;, as well as the action and the character moments for Ace. DVD Talk&#x27;s J. Doyle Wallis, reviewing the original DVD release, gave the story three and a half out of five stars, calling it &quot;a good ... adventure&quot; and noting the shift in the Doctor&#x27;s personality. Alasdair Wilkins of io9 called &quot;Remembrance&quot; &quot;by a pretty wide margin the best anniversary special the show has ever done&quot;, praising the return to the 1960s and the various continuity references.

Patrick Mulkern of &quot;Radio Times&quot; praised the serial for &quot;attempting to honour the programme&#x27;s roots, even if, sadly, the effect is more of the present clomping all over the past&quot;, and questioned how the Doctor could have known about the Daleks in 1963 if he did not meet them until he left. He was also critical of the supporting characters and McCoy and Ace; he felt McCoy &quot;struggles to convey gravitas&quot; in the changes that had been made to his character, and while Aldred brought &quot;gusto&quot;, Ace was &quot;a peculiarly safe, middle-class rendering of a streetwise kid&quot;. Mulkern wrote that the action scenes were handled well, but some of the Daleks looked &quot;fragile&quot; and destroying Skaro was double genocide. John Sinnot, reviewing the second DVD release on DVD Talk, gave the serial three and a half out of five stars. He praised the action, references, and the Doctor&#x27;s active involvement in the plot, but criticised the music and also questioned how the Doctor would have been able to plant the Hand of Omega for the Daleks. Sinnot also felt the Daleks acted &quot;stupid&quot; in some scenes, and wrote that the relationship between Ace and Mike was &quot;clumsy and awkward&quot;. In 2010, Charlie Jane Anders of &quot;io9&quot; listed the cliffhanger to the first episode – in which the Dalek levitates up the stairs – as one of the greatest cliffhangers in the history of &quot;Doctor Who&quot;. However, Anders felt that the execution was &quot;pants, with Sylvester McCoy pulling some dreadful faces&quot;. In 2013, &quot;Den of Geek&quot;″s Andrew Blair selected &quot;Remembrance of the Daleks&quot; as one of the ten &quot;Doctor Who&quot; stories that would make great musicals.

In the &quot;Doctor Who Magazine&quot; 1988 season poll, &quot;Remembrance of the Daleks&quot; was voted as the best story of season twenty-five with 64% of the vote, 46% ahead of &quot;The Greatest Show in the Galaxy&quot;. Ten years later, the magazine conducted a poll of readers to find the most popular &quot;Doctor Who&quot; stories of all time for the programme&#x27;s 35th anniversary; &quot;Remembrance of the Daleks&quot; was voted 6th. In 2003, the magazine conducted a poll for the programme&#x27;s 40th anniversary – this time, &quot;Remembrance of the Daleks&quot; finished 7th. &quot;Remembrance of the Daleks&quot; placed 14th in the magazine&#x27;s 2009 &quot;Mighty 200&quot; reader survey, which ranked the 200 &quot;Doctor Who&quot; stories made up to that point. In the magazine&#x27;s 50th anniversary poll, released in 2014, it placed 10th. In 2023, the story finished in 9th position in the magazine&#x27;s 60th anniversary poll.

The 2021 Channel 4 drama &quot;It&#x27;s a Sin&quot; contains a mocked-up scene of a fictional &quot;Doctor Who&quot; serial involving a Dalek attack in tribute to the actor Dursley McLinden, who appeared in &quot;Remembrance of the Daleks&quot; and whose life and early death from AIDS partially inspired the drama&#x27;s main character played by Olly Alexander.

===In print===

Ben Aaronovitch&#x27;s novelisation was published by Target Books in June 1990. Its use of a &quot;darker Doctor and more modern approach&quot; influenced the &quot;Virgin New Adventures&quot;, a series of more adult original novels that continued the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; story after the series was cancelled. The ancient Gallifreyan figure known as &quot;The Other&quot; first appears here, who had been instrumental to the Cartmel Masterplan, and whose storyline continued into the &quot;New Adventures&quot;. The novelisation also references Kadiatu Lethbridge-Stewart, who became a recurring character in the &quot;New Adventures&quot;. Certain phrases are also translated into the Daleks&#x27; language which refer to the Doctor as the &quot;Ka Faraq Gatri&quot; and is variously translated as &quot;Bringer of Darkness&quot; or &quot;Destroyer of Worlds&quot;. The phrase is used throughout the &quot;Virgin New Adventures&quot; series to refer to the increasingly dark actions of the Seventh Doctor and is referred to again in &quot;Journey&#x27;s End&quot; where Davros condemns the Tenth Doctor as the &quot;Destroyer of Worlds&quot;.

The novelisation was rereleased in 2013 as part of a 50th anniversary collection of novels reprinted for each Doctor. &quot;Remembrance of the Daleks&quot; was the only novelisation in the range.

===Home media===
&quot;Remembrance of the Daleks&quot; was released on VHS with &quot;The Chase&quot; in September 1993 as a special Dalek tin set titled &quot;The Daleks: Limited Edition Boxed Set&quot;. It was re-released in 2001 as part of &quot;The Davros Collection&quot;, which was a limited-edition box set, exclusive to UK retailer WH Smith.

The serial was released on DVD in the United Kingdom on 26 February 2001, remastered by the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; Restoration Team. The original Region 2 DVD release has some video effects missing from episode 1 and the start of episode 2. This was an unforeseen consequence of the Restoration Team using earlier edits of these episodes to minimise generational quality loss, made before certain effects were added. The problem was corrected with subsequent DVD releases, including Region 1. This DVD also was not able to include two songs by The Beatles, &quot;Do You Want to Know a Secret&quot; and &quot;A Taste of Honey&quot;, due to copyright; the former was replaced by the Billy J. Kramer and the Dakotas&#x27; version, while the latter was replaced with &quot;generic production music&quot;.

The story was included as part of a limited run box set in 2003 with &quot;The Dalek Invasion of Earth&quot; and &quot;Resurrection of the Daleks&quot;. A remastered version of this story was released on Region 2 in November 2007, as part of &quot;The Complete Davros Collection&quot; and as a two-disc standalone release (including the &#x27;Davros Connections&#x27; documentary from the boxset) on 20 July 2009. It includes the effects that were mistakenly left out and songs by The Beatles that weren&#x27;t clearable for the original release but subsequently fell under a blanket music licensing agreement for the UK. There is also a newly remastered stereo and 5.1 surround sound mix. In the original Davros Boxset release version, there were two total mutes of the 5.1 soundtrack during episode one. 2entertain fixed the master within a few days of release and faulty copies could be exchanged for fixed ones via mail-in. The standalone version of the release uses the fixed version. The two-disc Special Edition was delayed due to clearance issues and was held off until it was released in the United States and Canada on 2 March 2010.

This serial was also released as part of the Doctor Who DVD Files in issue 29 on 10 February 2010, the first of the classic series to be released on the partwork. This marks the fourth different separate release of the serial on DVD.

In 2013, (in the USA and Australia) it was released on DVD for another time as part of the &quot;Doctor Who: The Doctors Revisited 5–8&quot; box set, alongside &quot;Earthshock&quot;, &quot;Vengeance on Varos&quot;, and the TV movie.

<doc id="359005" wikidata="Q3038433" url="?curid=359005" title="Dr. Who and the Daleks">
<text>Dr. Who and the Daleks is a 1965 British science fiction film directed by Gordon Flemyng and written by Milton Subotsky, and the first of two films based on the British science-fiction television series &quot;Doctor Who&quot;. It stars Peter Cushing as Dr. Who, Roberta Tovey as Susan, Jennie Linden as Barbara, and Roy Castle as Ian. It was followed by &quot;Daleks&#x27; Invasion Earth 2150 A.D.&quot; (1966).

The story is based on the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; television serial &quot;The Daleks&quot;, produced by the BBC. Filmed in Technicolor, it is the first &quot;Doctor Who&quot; story to be made in colour and in a widescreen format. The film was not intended to form part of the ongoing story-lines of the television series. Elements from the programme are used, however, such as various characters, the Daleks and a police box time machine, albeit in re-imagined forms.

==Plot==
Dr. Who, his granddaughters Susan and Barbara, and Barbara&#x27;s boyfriend Ian are accidentally transported to another planet by Dr. Who&#x27;s latest invention, a time and space machine called Tardis.

While exploring, the travellers see a city in the distance. They also find a small container of drugs which they take aboard Tardis. Wishing to investigate further, Dr. Who fakes a leak in a fluid link, a vital component of Tardis, to ensure that the group will go to the city to search for the mercury supposedly needed to refill the component. Once in the city, they are captured by cyborg creatures which refer to themselves as &quot;Daleks&quot;, who seize the fluid link for examination. Dr. Who then realises that the group have contracted radiation sickness, and that the drugs which they discovered earlier may be their only hope of survival.
While covertly observing the captives, the Daleks discuss their own plight. They are trapped inside their metal casings, and within the city, by the radiation. They wish to leave so that they can destroy all other life and claim the planet for themselves. Hearing the captives discussing the drugs, the Daleks make a proposal to them. If the humans bring the drugs they found to them, they will allow them enough to treat themselves. Susan goes, being the only one still strong enough to undertake the task.

Reaching Tardis, Susan collects the drugs and then encounters Alydon, leader of the Thals, a species that fought the Daleks in an atomic war centuries previously. Alydon gives Susan a second container of anti-radiation drugs to use if the Daleks break their promise.

When Susan returns, the Daleks discover the second drug supply, but allow the humans to treat themselves with it. Susan explains to the others that, according to Alydon, the Thal crops have failed and they have come to the Dalek city, hoping to trade the anti-radiation drug formula for food. Again overhearing this conversation, the Daleks decide that they no longer need the Thals now that they have a sample of the drug. They get Susan to write a letter which they will leave for the Thals, stating that they will provide food, to be collected from the city, as an act of friendship. When Susan finishes the letter, the Daleks reveal that they plan to kill all of the Thals when they arrive.

When a Dalek enters their cell, the travellers manage to disable it. Once free, they are able to warn the Thals who are entering the city, and escape with them into the jungle. The Daleks then test the Thal anti-radiation drug but find that it causes disastrous side effects. Thwarted, they decide to detonate a neutron bomb to increase the planet&#x27;s radiation to a level which even the Thals cannot survive.

Back at the Thal camp, Dr. Who realises that the travellers are trapped on the planet as the Daleks still have the fluid link, and he will need the Thals&#x27; help to recover it. He urges Alydon to fight the Daleks to save his species but he refuses, insisting that the Thals are now peaceful. In response, Dr. Who pretends to order Ian to take a Thal woman to the Daleks in exchange for the confiscated component. Horrified, Alydon attacks Ian, then realises that the Thals &quot;can&quot; fight for things they care about. Alydon, Dr. Who and Susan then lead the Thals in an attack on the city, but the Daleks repel the assault; in the commotion, Dr. Who and Susan are recaptured.

Meanwhile, Ian, Barbara and a small group of Thals infiltrate the Dalek city from the rear. Once inside, they join the rest of the Thals, who have mounted a frontal assault to rescue Dr. Who and Susan. The Thals and humans enter the control room, where the Daleks have started the bomb countdown. During the ensuing struggle the Daleks inadvertently destroy their main control console, which kills them by cutting their power and stops the bomb detonation.

Back in the jungle, with the fluid link recovered, the travellers depart in Tardis to return home, with some Thal capes as presents.

==Cast==
==Production==
Amicus bought an option to make the story and two sequels from Terry Nation and the BBC for £500. Principal photography commenced at Shepperton Studios, England in April 1965 and took six weeks. The film was produced on a budget of £180,000, .

The Daleks were redesigned slightly for the film. They had larger base sections and dome lights than the TV Daleks of the time, making them more imposing, and some were fitted with a two-jawed mechanical claw instead of a plunger. They also had more colourful paint schemes, with two Dalek leaders being painted respectively in black and red. Originally, the Daleks were to be armed with flamethrowers, but these were vetoed on health and safety grounds and because they were considered too frightening for a young audience. Instead, the guns produced jets of CO2 gas from internally mounted fire extinguishers. The actor Barrie Ingham discussed the production in an interview in Australia in 1976 for the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; fanzine &quot;Zerinza&quot;.

In 1995, a documentary about the two Dalek films, &quot;Dalekmania&quot;, was released on video. It revealed details about the productions, spin-offs, and publicity campaigns. It was later included as an extra in many of the home media video releases of the two Dalek films.

Although the planet on which the action takes place is not named in the film, it is retroactively identified as Skaro in the sequel, matching the name given in the television series.

==Release==
The film premiered in London on 23 August 1965. The film was the twentieth biggest British box office moneymaker in 1965. It did not perform as well in the US, however, where the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; television series and the Daleks were relatively unknown.

==Marketing==
As part of the promotional campaign, a number of Daleks were displayed at the 1965 Cannes film festival. Single Daleks were also sent further afield, one making an appearance at a cinema in Sydney, Australia. Souvenir Press published a tie-in colouring book for children in 1965, with colour photographic illustrations from the film on both the front and rear covers.

==Critical response==
&quot;Halliwell&#x27;s Film Guide&quot; described the film as &quot;limply put together, and only for indulgent children&quot;. John Clute, in the book &quot;Science Fiction: The Illustrated Encyclopedia&quot;, gives the film one star out of three, stating: &quot;Many people would like to see the [&quot;Doctor Who&quot;] television series back; few mourn the long-gone films&quot;. &quot;Radio Times&quot; was more favourable, awarding the film three stars out of five, commenting: &quot;this spin-off lacks the bite and inventiveness that set the landmark series apart, unwisely injecting humour into the sparse scenario, and the cheap art direction is strictly &#x27;101 Uses for Pink Plastic Sheeting&#x27;. However, despite the many faults, it&#x27;s still a fun ride for both the uninitiated and die-hard fans alike&quot;.

In &quot;The Guardian&quot; in 2013, Stuart Heritage stated: &quot;Cushing does his best, but he&#x27;s not exactly given a lot to work with.&quot; He described the Daleks as &quot;so pointlessly toothless here&quot; and also criticised the &quot;incredibly tedious&quot; amount of Dalek dialogue to explain their motives, the portrayal of the Thals, and Roy Castle&#x27;s performance, saying &quot;to call him hammy would be to provide the greatest disservice to pigs.&quot; Andrew Nette of the British Film Institute stated the film was &quot;widely derided by many fans and critics&quot;, adding it is &quot;certainly an uneven affair. Some scenes [...] still have the capacity to thrill. Others, like the final victory over the Daleks, feel rushed and flat. The Doctor&#x27;s granddaughters are largely one-dimensional... The aspect of the movie that most antagonises purists is Cushing&#x27;s Doctor.&quot; Nette described the film as having a &quot;wonderfully pulpy sci-fi atmosphere&quot;, saying: &quot;The highlight of the movie is its look... Many of the sets [...] are impressive&quot; and &quot;the movie Daleks are more impressive than their small screen counterparts&quot;.

According to the BFI, the Cushing films &quot;are often forgotten in the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; pantheon&quot;. Similarly, Stuart Heritage commented in &quot;The Guardian&quot; in 2013 that &quot;people don&#x27;t talk about &quot;Dr Who and the Daleks&quot; any more&quot;. In 1975, actor Tom Baker, who was playing the Fourth Doctor in the television series, commented on the flaws of the film and its sequel while discussing another proposed &quot;Doctor Who&quot; film, saying &quot;There have been two &quot;Doctor Who&quot; films in the past, both rather poor... There are many dangers in transporting a television series onto the big screen.. a lot of things that you could get away with on the small screen wouldn&#x27;t wash in the cinema.&quot;

<text>Virgin Books is a British book publisher 90% owned by the publishing group Random House, and 10% owned by Virgin Group, the company originally set up by Richard Branson as a record company.

==History==
Virgin established its book publishing arm in the late 1970s; in the latter part of the 1980s Virgin purchased several existing companies, including WH Allen, well known among &quot;Doctor Who&quot; fans for their Target Books imprint; Virgin Books was incorporated into WH Allen in 1989, but in 1991 WH Allen was renamed Virgin Publishing Ltd.

Virgin Publishing&#x27;s early success came with the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; New Adventures novels, officially licensed full-length novels carrying on the story of the popular science-fiction television series following its cancellation in 1989. Virgin published this series from 1991 to 1997, as well as a range of &quot;Doctor Who&quot; reference books from 1992 to 1998 under the Doctor Who Books imprint.

In recent times the company is best known for its commercial non-fiction list, which includes business, health and lifestyle, music, film, and celebrity biographies. Richard Branson&#x27;s autobiography &quot;Losing My Virginity&quot;, released in 1998, was an international best-seller at the time, and continues to sell well. His follow-up title &quot;Business Stripped Bare&quot; was published in September 2008. Virgin Business Guides included titles by Robert Craven, Paul Barrow and Rachelle Thackray. More recently the company has enjoyed success with Robert H Frank&#x27;s &quot;The Economic Naturalist&quot;, where the author had his economics students pose interesting questions from everyday life and explain them through economics.

Random House, through its United Kingdom division, acquired a 90% stake in the company in March 2007. In November 2009, Virgin became an independent imprint within Ebury Publishing, a division of the Random House Group.

==Imprints==
Other popular ranges have included various erotic fiction lines:
* Black Lace specializes in erotica and erotic romance written by female authors specifically for heterosexual female readers. The imprint does not publish novels written by men partly as a marketing scheme, partly to better appeal to their target demographic. The books explore women&#x27;s sexuality as well as such themes as BDSM, group sex and bisexuality. The imprint began publishing in 1993, has published over 250 titles and sold over three million books. In 2006, Black Lace developed three specific lines within the imprint: contemporary, historical and paranormal. Black Lace also publishes short story anthologies, novella collections and in 2007 launched its first trilogy, a series of werewolf erotica by Mathilde Madden. The imprint marked its fifteen-year anniversary in 2008 with re-issues of several of its original novels. In 2009, Virgin announced that Black Lace would add no new titles in 2010. The line was relaunched in 2012.
* Nexus Books, sado-masochistic pornography written mostly for men who have sex with women, and women who have sex with men or women. In 2009, Virgin announced that Nexus would add no new titles in 2010.
* Idol for gay men (defunct).
* Sapphire for lesbians (defunct).

<text>The Norman yoke is a term denoting the oppressive aspects of feudalism in England, attributed to the impositions of William the Conqueror, the first Norman king of England, his retainers and their descendants. The term was used in English nationalist and democratic discourse from the mid-17th century.

== History ==

The medieval chronicler Orderic Vitalis wrote in his &quot;Ecclesiastical History&quot; that the Normans had imposed a yoke on the English: &quot;And so the English groaned aloud for their lost liberty and plotted ceaselessly to find some way of shaking off a yoke that was so intolerable and unaccustomed.&quot; His later work, written in light of Henry I&#x27;s reign and fifty years after the Conquest, took a more positive view of the situation of England, writing, &quot;King Henry governed the realm ... prudently and well through prosperity and adversity. ... He treated the magnates with honour and generosity. He helped his humbler subjects by giving just laws, and protecting them from unjust extortions and robbers.&quot; The culturally freighted term of a &quot;Norman yoke&quot; first appears in an apocryphal work published in 1642 during the English Civil War, under the title &quot;The Mirror of Justices&quot;; the book was a translation of , a collection of 13th century political, legal, and moral fables, written in Anglo-Norman French, thought to have been compiled and edited in the early 14th century by renowned legal scholar Andrew Horn. Even though it would have been obvious to anyone living in the fourteenth century that the book was a work of fiction, at the time of its publication in 1642, &quot;The Mirror of Justices&quot; was presented and accepted as historical fact.

Frequently, critics following the Norman yoke model would claim Alfred the Great or Edward the Confessor as models of justice. In this context, Magna Carta is seen as an attempt to restore pre-Conquest English rights, if only for the gentry. When Sir Edward Coke reorganised the English legal system, he was keen to claim that the grounds of English common law were beyond the memory or register of any beginning and pre-existed the Norman conquest, although he did not use the phrase &quot;Norman yoke&quot;.

The idea of the Norman yoke characterized the nobility and gentry of England as the descendants of foreign usurpers who had destroyed an Anglo-Saxon golden age. Such a reading was extremely powerful for the poorer classes of England. Whereas Coke, John Pym, Lucy Hutchinson, and Sir Henry Vane saw Magna Carta rights as being primarily those of the propertied classes, during the prolonged 17th-century constitutional crisis in England and Scotland, the arguments were also taken up in a more radical way. Those espousing the more radical arguments include the likes of Francis Trigge, John Hare, John Lilburne, John Warr, and Gerrard Winstanley of the radical Diggers, the latter of whom even called for an end to primogeniture and for the cultivation of the soil in common. &quot;Seeing the common people of England by joynt consent of person and purse have caste out Charles our Norman oppressor, wee have by this victory recovered ourselves from under his Norman yoake&quot;, wrote Winstanley on behalf of the Diggers, in December 1649. In &quot;The True Levellers Standard Advanced&quot; Winstanley begins:

==Revival of interest==
Interest in the idea of the Norman yoke revived in the eighteenth century; it appeared in such texts as the &quot;Historical Essay on the English Constitution&quot; (1771) and in John Cartwright&#x27;s &quot;Take Your Choice&quot; (1777), and featured in the debate between Thomas Paine and Edmund Burke. Thomas Jefferson also championed the idea.

By the 19th century the Norman yoke lost whatever historical significance it may have had and was no longer a &quot;red flag&quot; in political debate, but it still carried its popular-history usefulness, conjuring up an imagined Anglo-Saxon golden-age England - Sir Walter Scott in his novel &quot;Ivanhoe&quot; (1819) puts a &quot;Saxon proverb&quot; into the mouth of Wamba (Ch. xxvii):
Norman saw on English oak.
On English neck a Norman yoke;
Norman spoon to English dish,
And England ruled as Normans wish;
Blithe world in England never will be more,
Till England&#x27;s rid of all the four.
Victorian Protestants sometimes linked the idea of the &quot;Norman Yoke&quot; with anti-Catholicism, with claims that the English Anglo-Saxon Church was freer of Papal influence than the Norman one. They cited events such as Pope Alexander II supporting William the Conqueror and the homages of various Plantagenet kings to the Papacy as proof of this idea. This linking of &quot;Anglo-Saxon&quot; English nationalism and anti-Catholicism influenced Charles Kingsley&#x27;s novel &quot;Hereward the Wake&quot; (1866), which, like &quot;Ivanhoe&quot;, helped popularize the image of a romantic Anglo-Saxon England destroyed by the Normans. On the other hand, Thomas Carlyle rejected the idea of the &quot;Norman Yoke&quot;; in his &quot;History of Friedrich II of Prussia&quot; (1858) Carlyle portrayed the Norman conquest as beneficial because it had helped unify England.

According to historian Marjorie Chibnall,

 Every age has found in [the Norman Conquest] something relevant to the constitutional, social and cultural issues of its own day, ranging from the political and parliamentary struggles of the seventeenth century through the romantic and scientific interpretations of history in the nineteenth to the debates on colonialism, races, and women&#x27;s history in the twentieth.

Fantasy author J. R. R. Tolkien, who was also a professor of Anglo-Saxon studies, is thought to have been influenced by the theory, especially in his &quot;lost rural idyll&quot; depiction of the Hobbits in the Lord of the Rings.

In the twenty-first century, Michael Wood touched upon the Norman Yoke concept in the context of highly mythologised so-called &quot;comic-book history&quot; for the BBC History series &quot;In Search of England&quot;.

<doc id="359010" wikidata="Q1758364" url="?curid=359010" title="Doctor Who Magazine">
<text>Doctor Who Magazine (abbreviated as DWM) is a magazine devoted to the British science fiction television series &quot;Doctor Who&quot;.

Launched in 1979 as &quot;Doctor Who Weekly&quot;, the magazine became a monthly publication the following year. In 1990 it switched to a four-weekly schedule, publishing 13 issues a year, along with triannual deluxe Special Editions (2002–) and Bookazines (2013–). Regular issues include interviews, behind-the-scenes articles on television episodes and &quot;Doctor Who&quot; in other media, as well as producing its own comic strip.

Its founding editor was Dez Skinn, and the longest-serving editor was Tom Spilsbury who served from 2007 to 2017. He was succeeded by Marcus Hearn, who took over from Spilsbury in July 2017. The incumbent editor is Jason Quinn, who took over from Hearn in September 2023. &quot;DWM&quot; is recognised by &quot;Guinness World Records&quot; as the longest running TV tie-in magazine, celebrating 40 years of continuous publication on 11 October 2019. The magazine published its 600th issue on 1 February 2024.

== History ==
Originally geared towards children and predominately featuring comic strips, &quot;DWM&quot; slowly transformed into a mature magazine, expanding to explore behind-the-scenes aspects of the series and developing the comic strip. Due to its longevity, it is seen as a source of &#x27;official&#x27; and exclusive information, sharing a close relationship with the television production team and the BBC.

=== Marvel years (1979–1995) ===

Officially licensed by the BBC, the magazine began life as Doctor Who Weekly in 1979, published by the UK arm of Marvel Comics. The first issue was released on Thursday 11 October with a cover date of 17 October and priced 12 pence.

The magazine moved from weekly to monthly publication with issue 44 in September 1980, becoming Doctor Who – A Marvel Monthly with a cover price of 30 pence – although the tagline was not part of the name, but simply a descriptor which appeared on many of Marvel UK&#x27;s monthly titles at that point. The indicia continued describing the publication as &#x27;Doctor Who Weekly&#x27; until issue 48. The cover title changed to Doctor Who Monthly with issue 61, and then to The Official Doctor Who Magazine with issue 85 in February 1984. It became The Doctor Who Magazine with issue 99 in April 1985, and simply Doctor Who Magazine with issue 107 in December 1985. The magazine has remained under that title ever since; an exception was made for issue 397 (June 2008) when the cover featured only the words Bad Wolf, following transmission of the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; episode &quot;Turn Left&quot; on Saturday 21 June.

Despite the BBC discontinuing production of &quot;Doctor Who&quot; in 1989, the magazine continued to be published, providing new adventures in the form of comics. In 1990 the magazine started appearing once every four weeks (13 times a year).

=== Panini years (1995–present) ===

&quot;DWM&quot; is now published by Panini Comics, which purchased the title along with the rest of the Marvel UK catalogue in 1995. In 2006, however, it lost its exclusivity when BBC Worldwide launched its own comic, &quot;Doctor Who Adventures&quot;, aimed at a younger audience.

DWM&#x27;s 400th issue was published in September 2008, and the publication celebrated its 30th anniversary in October 2009. In April 2010, it was confirmed in issue 420 that Doctor Who Magazine now holds the Guinness World Record for &quot;Longest Running Magazine Based on a Television Series.&quot; The magazine reached its 500th issue in May 2016. It reached its 600th issue in February 2024.

In April 2011, Panini Comics released a new monthly magazine titled &quot;Doctor Who Insider&quot;; although it was made in Britain the magazine was published for North America. It was announced on 27 January 2012 that &quot;Doctor Who Insider&quot; had ceased publication after nine issues. &quot;Doctor Who Insider&quot; returned for a special edition issue on 1 November 2012.

Panini has begun to digitally restore and reprint older &quot;DWM&quot; comics in trade paperback format. Twenty-five volumes have been printed so far: two featuring the comics adventures of the Fourth Doctor, one with the adventures of the Fifth Doctor, two featuring the Sixth Doctor, five with the adventures of the Seventh Doctor, four focusing on the Eighth Doctor, one with the adventures of the Ninth Doctor, three featuring the Tenth Doctor, four collecting the adventures of the Eleventh Doctor and four with the adventures of the Twelfth Doctor. Panini also published a one-shot magazine-format reprinting of the complete Ninth Doctor strips in 2006 and most of the Tenth Doctor and Martha Jones strips in 2008. DWM issue 426 reported that the series had been postponed; it eventually resumed with the publication of &quot;The Crimson Hand&quot; in May 2012.

In November 2020, Panini published &quot;The Daleks&quot;, a new compilation of the Dalek comic strips originally published on the back pages of early issues of 1960s comic &quot;TV Century 21&quot;. Unlike previous reprints, the majority of pages in the collection were scanned from the original artwork.

=== Editors ===

&quot;DWM&quot;&#x27;s founding editor was Dez Skinn, who had been headhunted by Stan Lee (the figurehead and creative leader at Marvel) to oversee the revitalisation of the ailing UK division. &quot;[I] had the idea for a &quot;Doctor Who&quot; title around 1975. . . . I felt it would be a perfect stablemate to my then-current &quot;House of Hammer&quot; magazine, and could be produced in the same format, with a mix of comic strips and features, going behind and beyond the TV series.&quot; To make the publication work, Skinn needed a comic strip to be at the heart of the publication, and successfully negotiated for the rights to the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; comics licence with the BBC which had previously been held by Polystyle Publications since late 1964. DWCC Launching in 1979 as a weekly comic strip based publication, Skinn handed over the reins in 1980.

His immediate successor as editor, Paul Neary, was faced with significant falling sales following the premature end of the programme’s 17th season in January 1980. Neary first attempted to target the publication at a younger readership; when this failed to halt falling sales, he instead relaunched the title as a monthly magazine. Subsequent editors gradually realised then surpassed Skinn&#x27;s vision of a more mature magazine, getting rid of secondary and tertiary comic strips for regular features and articles going behind the scenes of the show.

During 1995 Panini bought out Marvel UK, and thus took control of &quot;DWM&quot;. The incumbent editor Gary Russell – who would go on to produce the Big Finish Productions &quot;Doctor Who&quot; audios dramas from their inception, and to work for BBC Wales as a Script Editor on the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; spin-offs &quot;The Sarah Jane Adventures&quot; and &quot;Torchwood&quot; – was &#x27;asked to leave&#x27;. The editorship was taken over by recently hired comic strip editor, Gary Gillatt.

Gillatt edited the magazine for the next five years, except for issue 255 in 1997 which was guest-edited by one of the stars of the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; TV show Sophie Aldred (who had portrayed the Seventh Doctor&#x27;s companion Ace during the late 1980s).

In February 2001, the editor at the time Alan Barnes, oversaw the transformation of the comic strip from black and white to full-colour with the first episode of the Eighth Doctor story &quot;Ophidius&quot; (issue 300).

Clayton Hickman became the editor in 2002, launching the deluxe triannual Special Editions of the magazine (which are running to this day) and the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; Annual, later Storybook, in 1996 (which ceased publication after five years). He was the first editor since John Freeman (editor) to work on the publication with the show actually in production.

Subsequent editor Tom Spilsbury took over in 2007, later launching the deluxe triannual Bookazine (running parallel to the Special Editions, and again still being produced to this day). Spilsbury would stay at the helm for a decade, becoming the longest-serving editor in the process, handing over the editorship to Marcus Hearn in 2017. Hearn announced his departure as editor in issue 594 in 2023, and he was succeeded by Jason Quinn.

=== Controversy ===
The October 2017 issue of &quot;Doctor Who Magazine&quot; featured a hidden profane message in a column written by an anonymous writer under the pseudonym &#x27;The Watcher&#x27;. Soon after the message&#x27;s discovery, the column was amended in the digital version of the issue. It was later revealed that the writer of the column had been Nicholas Pegg, an occasional writer for the magazine and one of the Dalek operators on the television series. BBC Worldwide had told the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; that &quot;The matter was raised with the publisher who have dismissed the writer.&quot; &quot;Private Eye&quot; later reported that editor Tom Spilsbury&#x27;s decision to leave the magazine stemmed from &quot;falling-out&quot; with BBC Wales over DWM&#x27;s coverage of &quot;Doctor Who&quot; spin-off &quot;Class&quot;, and that he was &quot;paid off&quot; in the summer of 2017 to leave the publication. However, in the following issue of &quot;Private Eye&quot;, a letter from Spilsbury was published, denying these allegations.

=== Circulation ===

The magazine joined the Audit Bureau of Circulations in June 2010, giving the average figure per issue for every six months, meaning circulation figures have only been made available officially for six-monthly periods since August of that year, when the publication recorded an average circulation of 35,374 per issue for between January and June 2010.

Since then, the average figures per issue have fluctuated, reaching a high of 36,151 for the July–December 2013 period, but generally decreasing since then, with the occasional small rise.

The last-known six-month certified average circulation figure per issue was 20,635 for the period between July and December 2018. The magazine&#x27;s average circulation figure per issue for January to June 2019 was due to be released on 15 August 2019 as part of the bureau&#x27;s batch of Consumer Magazines figures for that period. However, for the first time since August 2010 no official data was published, after the magazine changed its reporting frequency to annually. The average circulation figure per issue for the 13 editions between January and December 2019, subsequently published by the bureau on 13 February 2020, was 17,586, comprising 10,239 paid single copies, 7,213 paid subscriptions and 134 free copies.

The average circulation per issue for the 13 editions between January and December 2020 was 16,304, according to data published by the bureau on 11 February 2021. It comprised 8,330 paid single copies, 7,838 paid subscriptions and 136 free copies.

The magazine stopped being registered with the Audit Bureau of Circulations at some point after then, meaning no figures for 2021 were published as part of the bureau&#x27;s batch of Consumer Magazines figures that were released on 17 February 2022.

== Content ==

Each issue of &quot;DWM&quot; contains a main comic strip (occasionally with secondary and tertiary strips or illustrated short stories), regular features (such as a letters page, previews and reviews of TV episodes, books and audios, and updates from the transmedia world of &quot;Doctor Who&quot;), and special articles (sometimes one-offs, sometimes in serial form, including interviews, analyses, and making-ofs).

=== Comic strip ===

&quot;DWM&quot; has featured an ongoing main comic strip starring the Doctor since its first issue in October 1979. The &quot;DWM&quot; strip thus took over from what has become known as the &#x27;Polystyle era&#x27; (1964–1979) of &quot;Doctor Who&quot; comic strips. Paul Scoones, an historian of the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; comic strip, writes: &#x27;First launched in the pages of &quot;TV Comic&quot; in November 1964, the comic strip version of &quot;Doctor Who&quot; is just one year younger than the television series on which it is based. The strip appeared almost every week: first in &quot;TV Comic&quot;, then in &quot;Countdown&quot; and &quot;TV Action&quot; before returning to &quot;TV Comic&quot;. All these titles were produced by a company called Polystyle Publications (formally TV Publications), which held the rights to publish a &quot;Doctor Who&quot; comic [strip] until May 1979 when the last instalment of the strip appeared [...] Once relinquished by Polystyle, the rights were soon snapped up by Marvel UK, who created their own ongoing comic [strip]. This new strip [...] continues to this day&#x27;. The main comic strip features the contemporary television Doctor (beginning with the Fourth Doctor who was on TV at the time &quot;DWM&quot; launched), sometimes with his on-screen companion(s), and sometimes with companion(s) created by the &quot;DWM&quot; writers. During some of the period when &quot;Doctor Who&quot; was off-air, in the wake of the Seventh Doctor, the &quot;DWM&quot; main strip featured stories with all the previous Doctors (1994–1996) but continued with the Eighth Doctor after the broadcast of the TV movie (1996). In 2004, when the series returned to television, showrunner Russell T Davies offered to let &quot;DWM&quot; write and publish the official regeneration scene from the Eighth Doctor to the Ninth Doctor. Although work was done on this storyline, then editor Clayton Hickman and writer Scott Gray eventually turned down the offer as they felt they couldn&#x27;t do such an important event justice under the constraints imposed by the TV series&#x27; continuity. In October 2018 (issue 531), the main comic strip began featuring the Thirteenth Doctor in &quot;The Warmonger&quot;.

As well as a main strip, &quot;DWM&quot; has also featured other comics strips over the years. In its first incarnation as &quot;Doctor Who Weekly&quot; the main strip was accompanied by a specially commissioned secondary strip exploring stories from across the Whoniverse, and a tertiary strip of reprints from other Marvel publications. The secondary strip continued with the transformation of the magazine into a monthly publication, finally ending in May 1982 (issue 64), albeit becoming more infrequent over the previous year. A tertiary strip, named &#x27;Tales from the TARDIS&#x27;, ran in &quot;Doctor Who Weekly&quot; until late April 1980 (issue 29). These re-used adaptations of classic works of literary science fiction previously published in Marvel Classics Comics (USA). In late May 1980 (issue 33), the tertiary strip returned reprinting the &quot;Dalek Chronicles&quot; (aka &quot;Dalek Tapes&quot;), a strip originally published as a one-pager in &quot;TV Century 21&quot; as &quot;The Daleks&quot; (1965–1967). This tertiary Dalek strip ended in September 1982 (issue 68) after completing about half of the original run. Since 1982, other strips have appeared again from time to time. For instance, in the 1990s a Cyberman one-pager strip was featured on the inside cover (3 August 1994 – 8 May 1996 [issues 215–238]). Titled &quot;The Cybermen&quot;, the series was set on their home planet of Mondas prior to the events of the television episode &quot;The Tenth Planet&quot; (1966). The &quot;TV Century 21&quot; comic &quot;The Daleks&quot; was also resurrected for a short time in 1997 (12 March-30 July [issues 249–254]), drawn in the same style as the 1960s original and continuing the story from where it had left off by showing the Daleks attacking Earth. Other than this and since then, secondary and tertiary strips have been as rare as hen&#x27;s teeth, and usually either one or two episodes.

The &quot;DWM&quot; comic strips were all originally printed in black and white (except with a minor – page-count-wise – exception for two pages of &quot;The Tides of Time&quot; [July 1982: issue 66]). The main strip, beginning in 1979 with the Fourth Doctor story &quot;The Iron Legion&quot; (17 October – 5 December [issues 1–8]), began being issued in colour as of issue 300 in 2001 with the Eighth Doctor story &quot;Ophidius&quot; (February–May [issues 300–303]). However, as early as December 1980 colourised reprints of the early Fourth Doctor main strip and secondary strips appeared in Marvel USA publications: &quot;Marvel Premiere: Doctor Who&quot; (every two months between December 1980 and June 1981 [issues 57–60]) successfully trialled the concept for an American audience to determine if it would attract enough readers; a &quot;Doctor Who&quot; comic series being launched in 1984. The series came to an end with issue 23 in August 1986, having colourised and reprinted all the Fourth Doctor strips and four of the six strips of the Fifth Doctor era, as well as 24 of the 27 &quot;DWM&quot; secondary strip stories originally published between 1979 and 1982. Reprints of the original &quot;DWM&quot; strips have also appeared in their original black and white as well as colourised in a dizzying number of formats, especially during the Marvel years (1979–1995). These Marvel UK (or Marvel licensed) parallel publications were: &quot;Doctor Who Magazine Specials&quot; (1980–1996); &quot;Doctor Who Magazine Graphic Novels&quot; (1989–1993); &quot;Doctor Who Classic Comics&quot; (1992–1994) and &quot;Doctor Who Yearbooks&quot; (1992–1996). Many of these publications also printed original strips as well. Another original &quot;Doctor Who&quot; strip also appeared in &quot;The Incredible Hulk Presents&quot; comic series (1989), and the Doctor appeared as a guest character in the first &quot;Death&#x27;s Head&quot; series (1989; rejigged and reprinted as &quot;Incomplete Death&#x27;s Head&quot; in 1993). Spin-off strips and reprints have become much more limited and much more focused during the Panini Years (1995–present). There was a short-lived original Eighth Doctor strip for the Radio Times (1996–1997), some original Ninth and Tenth Doctor strips in the &quot;Annual&quot; and &quot;Storybooks&quot; (2006–2010), and two sets of reprints of the Ninth Doctor strips (2006) and some of the Tenth Doctor strips (2008) in the relaunched and rebranded &quot;Special Editions&quot; (2002–present). Returning to the origins of the &quot;DWM&quot; main strip, Panini licensed IDW, an American comic book company, for new digitalised colour reprints of Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, and Seventh Doctor stories. Beginning in January 2008 and running into 2013, IDW printed its &quot;Doctor Who Classics&quot; monthly comic book series, going on to collect the colourised strips into various trade paperbacks and omnibus editions.

Notable writers and artists who have worked on the &quot;DWM&quot; comic strips, in all its myriad forms include John Wagner, Pat Mills, Alan Moore, Grant Morrison, Dave Gibbons, Mike McMahon, John Ridgway and Ian Edginton. Supporting characters created by such writers for &quot;DWM&quot; have even crossed over from the comic to other spin-off media include Frobisher, the shape-changing companion of the Sixth and Seventh Doctors who would appear in Big Finish audios; Abslom Daak, the Dalek Killer; the Special Executive, who would later appear in Marvel&#x27;s &quot;Captain Britain&quot;; and the villainous Beep the Meep.

During the mid-2000s, in the wake of the successful return of &quot;Doctor Who&quot; to television, the BBC began offering multiple comic strip publishing licences effectively ending the monopoly held by &quot;DWM&quot; since they had taken over where Polystyle had left off. In 2006, the partwork publishers GE Fabbri acquired the license to produce &quot;Doctor Who – Battles in Time&quot;, a fortnightly magazine with a trading card game and its own &quot;Doctor Who&quot; comic strip. The final issue (number 70) was released on 13 May 2009. Around the same time, IMC launched &quot;Doctor Who Adventures&quot;, its comic strip and features aimed at 6 to 13-year-olds, a younger demographic than the &quot;DWM&quot; readership. Initially published every fortnight, from 2008 it went weekly, returning to fortnightly in May 2013, then monthly in 2014. In April 2015, the title was purchased by Panini, the publishers of &quot;DWM&quot;, who rebooted the publication beginning again with issue 1, changing it to bi-monthly in late 2016. On 19 June 2017, Panini confirmed that publication of the magazine was to be paused after issue 24. A special one-off edition was released in January 2019. Finally, IDW – who were reprinting early &quot;DWM&quot; strips in their &quot;Doctor Who Classics&quot; series – launched a parallel range of ongoing comics featuring the Tenth Doctor in early 2008. Over the next six years, until the end of 2013, there were series and ones-shots featuring the Tenth then Eleventh Doctor, even producing a cross over with &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation / Doctor Who : Assimilation2&quot;. IDW ceded their license to Titan in 2014, who have since created a complex number of parallel &quot;Doctor Who&quot; series for both nu-&quot;Who&quot; and classic Doctors. Titan have collected the IDW and Titan comics into various format collectors editions, scaling back production since the beginning of the Thirteenth Doctor era.

=== Cartoons and illustrated short stories ===

The publication also features parody cartoons, most notably &quot;Doctor Who?&quot;, a humorous look at the series by Tim Quinn and Dicky Howett. This was principally a three-panel comic strip, though occasionally page-long parodies were featured. Also, between 1989 and 1992 &quot;The Comic Assassins&quot; was a series of parody strips by Steve Noble and Kev F. Sutherland. &quot;Doctor Who?&quot;&#x27;s spiritual successor was the single-panel strip &quot;Doctor Whoah!&quot; by &#x27;Baxter&#x27;. Embedded into the &#x27;Galaxy Forum&#x27; letters page, it lampooned a recent episode, DVD release of stories or other such event by showing alternative, exaggerated and expanded versions of &quot;Doctor Who&quot; scenes. For example, after the broadcast of &quot;Partners in Crime&quot; (2008), the strip portrayed the Doctor&#x27;s arrival on the &#x27;Planet of the Hats&#x27;, referred to in the episode. The strip was known for its characters who are depicted as having no pupils in their eyes. Since 2014, &quot;Doctor Whoah!&quot; has been replaced by &quot;The Daft Dimension&quot;, a similarly sized strip in three panels by Lew Stringer.

&quot;DWM&quot; has also published illustrated short stories in its magazine and parallel publications, most cohesively during the Marvel years. Beginning in &quot;Doctor Who Weekly&quot; on 9 April 1980 (issue 26), a sequence of these short stories ran for eight issues, returning is shorts burst for a number of issues every few years up until 1996. Occasional illustrated short stories have appeared since then, including the many parallel publications in both Marvel and Panini years. In addition, there was also a run of &#x27;Brief Encounters&#x27;, very short one or two-page illustrated stories that ran from 28 November 1990 (issue 167) through to 6 July 1994 (issue 214) as well as in contemporary &quot;Specials&quot; and &quot;Yearbooks&quot; between 1991 and 1992.

=== Regular features and special articles ===
Other regular features of the magazine include the news section &quot;Gallifrey Guardian&quot;, which has run since nearly the beginning of the magazine; the letters page &quot;Galaxy Forum&quot; which – as well as containing the &quot;Daft Dimension&quot; strip – features other small sub-sections, such as &quot;Ask DWM!&quot; (where readers&#x27; questions about the show are answered), &quot;On This Month&quot; (which looks at an old issue on the anniversary of its publication) and &quot;WhoTube&quot; (which highlights &quot;Doctor Who&quot;-themed videos which can be viewed online); reviews of television episodes and merchandise (in &quot;The DWM Review&quot;, known for a time as &quot;After Image&quot;, &quot;Off the Shelf&quot;, and &quot;Shelf Life&quot;); the &quot;Time Team&quot;, which involves four fans watching every &quot;Doctor Who&quot; story in order from the beginning; and, since production restarted on the series in 2004, a regular column &quot;Production Notes&quot; by the show&#x27;s executive producer. From 2004 to 2009 the column was written by Russell T Davies, and from January 2010 to July 2017, Steven Moffat took over the page, although other writers and production staff have from time-to-time written the column. Also, on the final page of magazine, there is a section called &quot;Wotcha!&quot; (compiled by &#x27;The Watcher&#x27;), a comedy page with such recurring features as, &#x27;A History of Doctor Who in 100 Objects&#x27;, &#x27;Supporting Artist of the Month&#x27;, a spoof &#x27;Top Ten&#x27;, the &#x27;Stockbridge English Dictionary&#x27; (a variation on a game from &quot;I&#x27;m Sorry I Haven&#x27;t a Clue&quot;) and a true or false quiz &quot;The Six Faces of Delusion&quot;. Prior to this, the slot was taken up by a page called &quot;Who on Earth is...&quot;, featuring a short interview with someone previously (or currently) involved in Doctor Who (say, a member of the cast).

A single-page &#x27;opinion&#x27; column has often been part of the magazine&#x27;s mix – past columns have included &quot;Fluid Links&quot; by Matt Jones, &quot;The Life and Times of Jackie Jenkins&quot; by &#x27;Jackie Jenkins&#x27;, &quot;It&#x27;s the End... But&quot; by &#x27;The Watcher&#x27;, &quot;You Are Not Alone&quot; by Jonathan Morris (as &#x27;Neil Harris&#x27;) and &quot;Relative Dimensions&quot; by author (and former &quot;Time Team&quot; member) Jacqueline Rayner. The format has changed over the years, but the news, letters, reviews, and comic strip have all been present consistently since the early 1980s.

The magazine also features interviews with the cast and crew of the television show (including the old episodes), and reports from the set of the current series, written by Benjamin Cook or Jason Arnopp. The behind-the-scenes stories of all of the 1963–1989 episodes have been documented in Andrew Pixley&#x27;s &quot;DWM Archive&quot;, and detailed analysis of certain significant serials are covered in &quot;The Fact of Fiction&quot;, usually written by former &quot;DWM&quot; editor Alan Barnes, Jonathan Morris or David Bailey. &quot;The DWM Review&quot; is currently written predominantly by Graham Kibble-White, former editor Gary Gillatt, Paul Kirkley, Martin Ruddock and Matt Michael. Previous reviewers include Vanessa Bishop, Craig Hinton (died in 2006), and Gary Russell, who subsequently became the magazine&#x27;s editor.

== &quot;DWM&quot; Parallel Publications: Marvel Years (1979–1995) ==

During the Marvel years (1979–1995), &quot;Doctor Who Magazine&quot; produced three types of &quot;Deluxe edition&quot; series issued in parallel to the main publication. These were the semi-regular Specials generally issued twice a year seasonally, and most usually labelled &quot;Summer&quot; and &quot;Winter&quot; (1980–1996); Yearbooks, essentially annuals, issued once a year in advance and for Christmas (1992–1996); and Poster Magazines, a short run of more visually orientated periodicals with single themes (1994–1996). All these series came to an end in the wake of Panini acquiring Marvel, and consequently, &quot;Doctor Who Magazine&quot; in 1995.

In addition, and since its very beginning, &quot;DWM&quot; comic strips have been reprinted and – on a few occasions had their original release – in many other publications and formats. Reprinting of &quot;DWM&quot; strips began as early as 1980 in parallel serial publications, and over the years there have been a number of such comic reprints and collections, many of which colourised the original strips. In addition, there have also been some original strips issued through these publications. Some series have even reprinted some of the earlier pre-&quot;DWM&quot; Polystyle Publications &quot;Doctor Who&quot; comic strips that appeared in TV Comic, which began in 1964 and ended when &quot;DWM&quot; gained the comic strip licence in 1979. There have also been original &quot;Doctor Who&quot; strips in other Marvel publications, and the Doctor appearing in other original Marvel strips (all of which dovetail with the main &quot;DWM&quot; strip). Finally, other publishers have reprinted &quot;DWM&quot; strips under licence.

=== &quot;Doctor Who&quot; Comics USA (1980–1986) ===
The first series of reprints of &quot;DWM&quot; comic strips began in late 1980, only a year or so after the original publication in 1979. These reprints were for the American market, and consisted of four issues in the &quot;Marvel Premiere&quot; series. The &quot;Marvel Premiere&quot; series was considered a testing ground to determine if a character or concept could attract enough readers to justify launching their own series. The four issues were considered a success, and so eventually became a series beginning in 1984, titled simply &quot;Doctor Who&quot;. Again, these were reprints were from &quot;DWM&quot;, and began soon after where &quot;Marvel Premiere&quot; left off (skipping a two part strip, perhaps appropriately titled &quot;Timeslip&quot; [issues 17–18], a Fourth Doctor story featuring the First, Second, and Third Doctors; this was eventually published in &quot;Doctor Who&quot; issue 18). All these strip reprints were colourised for the first time; as were supporting secondary Doctorless strips also taken from &quot;DWM&quot; (or, on limited occasions, &quot;DWM&quot; Specials). Both &quot;Marvel Premiere: Doctor Who&quot; and &quot;Doctor Who&quot; had regular features and special articles.

* Marvel Premiere: Doctor Who (Issues 57–60): From December 1980 to June 1981 once every two months, Marvel USA experimented with the &quot;DWM Doctor Who&quot; comic strip for an American audience. For four issues they reprinted the earliest two Fourth Doctor main strips. These were now colourised, and with new covers displaying the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; logo of the time. These four issues of &quot;Marvel Premiere: Doctor Who&quot; were a test run for an American style &quot;Doctor Who&quot; comic, which eventually began publishing in 1984. In some editions there were just strips (with the exception of a letters page); in some editions there were also short features. Furthermore, in two editions there were secondary strips, in one instance a &quot;DWM&quot; secondary strip, and in the other a non-&quot;Doctor Who&quot; strip – both of which were in colour.
* Doctor Who (Marvel Comics USA) (Issues 1–23): From October 1984 to August 1986, and following the success of the trial run of &quot;Marvel Premiere: Doctor Who&quot;, Marvel Comics published a monthly comic book series in America titled simply &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, that reprinted the Fourth Doctor and some of the earliest Fifth Doctor main strips. Beginning soon after where &quot;Marvel Premiere: Doctor Who&quot; had concluded (skipping the third story of the original run, which was eventually published later in the run), once again the strips were colourised and had new covers, but they also appeared in a &#x27;glossy format&#x27; rather than traditional American style rough paper print. There were also &quot;DWM&quot; secondary strips (again, colourised from the original black and white); or on limited occasions strips taken from early &quot;DWM&quot; Specials. The comic had regular features, from issue three a letters column and, from issue 13, &quot;Who Knows&quot;, described as &#x27;Happenings in the world of &quot;Doctor Who&quot;&#x27;. There were also occasional short special articles on the television show, such as overviews of characters, and interviews with cast and crew members.

The list below covers all comic strip colourised reprints and notable special articles:

&quot;Doctor Who&quot; (Marvel USA) ceased publication with issue 23 in August 1986. Editor Jim Salicrup explained the reason as being &#x27;poor sales. Despite a good start, and rather good sales in areas where &quot;Doctor Who&quot; (the television programme) is in syndication, sales have been off. Producing &quot;Doctor Who&quot; [Marvel USA] in this format has been expensive, and without sufficient sales support it was decided to discontinue [...] rather than sacrifice the quality of the magazine&#x27;. Salicrup is essentially referring to the added costs of the glossy paper and the strips needing to go through a process of colouration.

In summary, over the entire run of &quot;Marvel Premiere: Doctor Who&quot; and &quot;Doctor Who&quot; the magazine reprinted in colourised form:
* the &quot;DWM&quot; main comic strip from issue 1 (17 October 1979) through to 77 (June 1983) in consecutive order, with the exception of &quot;Timeslip&quot; (&quot;DWM&quot; issues 17–18) which was initially skipped but included much later in the run essentially as a &quot;Doctor Who&quot; (Marvel USA) secondary strip. Thus, the magazine included all the Fourth Doctor strips, and the first four (of a total of six) Fifth Doctor strips.
* the &quot;DWM&quot; Doctorless secondary strip, mostly in order from the beginning of &quot;Doctor Who&quot; (Marvel USA) – except for a one part story in &quot;Marvel Premiere: Doctor Who&quot; – up until issue 13, when &quot;Abslom Daak… Dalek-Killer&quot; was followed by later strips featuring the character. After that, secondary strips were placed increasingly randomly. Over the entire original run of 27 secondary strips in &quot;DWM&quot; (from issue 1 to 64, after which they came to an end as a continuous feature), Marvel USA comics reprinted 24 of these. The exceptions were the one-part stories: &quot;Star Death&quot; (&quot;DWM&quot; #47), &quot;4-D War&quot; (&quot;DWM&quot; #51), and &quot;Black Sun Rising&quot; (&quot;DWM&quot; #57).
* three Doctorless strips from early &quot;DWM&quot; Specials (not including a parody strip from &quot;DWM&quot; Winter Special 1983/84 [1983]). One from the &quot;DWM&quot; Winter Special 1981 (the second part of story began in &quot;DWM&quot;); and two from the &quot;DWM&quot; Special Summer 1982. The &quot;Doctor Who Magazine&quot; Specials are listed in full in the next subsection.

=== &quot;Doctor Who Magazine Specials&quot; (1980–1996) ===

From 1980 to 1996 &quot;DWM&quot; released a series of &#x27;Specials&#x27; with an increased page count. Early on, the Specials tended to have a mix of articles and comic strips (both reprints and originals). However, after the first few issues and up to about halfway through the run, the publication tended to be just composed of articles; with the occasional issue dedicated to comic strip reprints, essentially a &#x27;Graphic Novel&#x27; (some in the original black &amp; white, some colourised). The second half of the run went back to including a comic strip in article based issues, during which time there were also two &#x27;Graphic Novels&#x27; (both in colour, one reprints, one original). Occasionally, issues carried illustrated short stories. The Specials began by being published twice a year during the summer and winter, and were usually, although not always, branded as such. This changed over the period 1987–1989 when there was only one a year (two for anniversaries), and then none in 1990. The twice year schedule resumed in 1991 again with summer and winter editions, before becoming a little more erratic during and after 1994 to the end of the run. The final two issues were devoted to &quot;Doctor Who&quot; movies: *&quot;Dr. Who and the Daleks&quot; and &quot;Daleks – Invasion Earth: 2150 A.D.&quot; (issue 29) and &quot;Doctor Who: The Movie&quot; (issue 30).

These Specials were not numbered, and sometimes contained no indicia or did not specify their status in the indicia – accordingly, confusion has arisen over the years between the Specials and some one-off &quot;DWM&quot; comic strip publications from the same period (some named Graphic Novels in their indicia, some with no indicia, or just the title of the publication in the indicia). However, in 2016 &quot;DWM&quot; provided a pictorial overview of what they considered official &quot;DWM&quot; Specials in their &quot;Doctor Who Magazine: 500 DWM Issues&quot; bonus &#x27;Souvenir&#x27; publication that came free with &quot;DWM&quot; issue 500. The list below follows the overview therein, but the issue numbering is imposed for ease of tracking, and was never included in the actual publications. The table below also attempts to capture the flavour of the different types of issue with the labelling &#x27;Seasonal Specials&#x27;, &#x27;Graphic Novels&#x27;, &#x27;Anniversary Issues&#x27;, and &#x27;Movie Specials&#x27;. In some cases, however, a single Special can be more than one of these types (such as labelled a seasonal special and an anniversary issue); once again, the numbering is imposed on these issues for ease of tracking the type.

*Seasonal Specials [SS] (which predominated): most usually twice a year for Winter and Summer, and labelled as such. The covers only rarely indicated the year.
*Graphic Novels [GN] (occasional): around half of all the Specials had comic strips, but six were devoted entirely to, or substantially to, comic strips. Note, the numbering here tracks all Marvel era &quot;Doctor Who&quot; Graphic Novels across its many different publications (for the full overview see the &#x27;Doctor Who Magazine Graphic Novels (1989–1993)&#x27; subsection below).
*Anniversary Issues [A] (three editions): for the 25th Anniversary of the television series (November 1988); the 10th Anniversary of &quot;Doctor Who Magazine&quot; (October 1989); and finally the 30th Anniversary of the television series (November 1993) which was also labelled (unlike the other anniversary editions) a seasonal special for Winter 1993.
*Movie Specials [M] (the final two editions): &quot;The Sixties Dalek Movies&quot; (also labelled &quot;Spring Special&quot;) (February 1996); and &quot;The &quot;Doctor Who Movie&quot; Special&quot; (May 1996) celebrating the return of &quot;Doctor Who&quot; to the screen after seven years without any television presence.

&quot;Doctor Who Magazine&quot; Specials ceased publication, along with all the other Marvel parallel publications, with the purchase of &quot;Doctor Who Magazine&quot; by Panini in 1995. Six years later, Panini kicked off production of &#x27;Specials&#x27; once again, this time called &#x27;Special Editions&#x27; (2002–present), following very similar formats and mixture of types although issued triannually. Panini would go on to launch another set of triannual &#x27;Specials&#x27;, known as &#x27;Bookazines&#x27;, a decade or so after that (2013–present).

With respect to Specials devoted to comic strips and labelled as &#x27;Graphic Novels&#x27; in the list above, there were six issued in total. Along with the three Marvel era &#x27;Graphic Novels&#x27; (1989–1993) and the &quot;DWM Classic Comics Autumn Special: Evening’s Empire&quot; (1993) publication (which appears as a Special of the &#x27;Classic Comics&#x27; run) there were ten Marvel era &quot;DWM&quot; &#x27;Graphic Novels&#x27; overall. These are all listed together for ease in the &quot;&#x27;Doctor Who Magazine&quot; Graphic Novels (1989–1993)&#x27; subsection below, with the publications belonging to the different &#x27;Specials&#x27; and &#x27;Classic Comics&#x27; indicated in the table.

=== &quot;Doctor Who&quot; Graphic Novels (1980–1994) ===

There were ten publications during the Marvel era that can be considered &#x27;Graphic Novels&#x27;. These were six of the 30 &quot;Doctor Who Magazine&quot; &#x27;Specials&#x27; (1980–1996), &quot;Evening’s Empire&quot; (1993) which appeared as a &#x27;Special&#x27; of the &#x27;Classic Comics&#x27; run (1992–1994), and three one-off publications. The term &#x27;Graphic Novel&#x27; must be applied loosely here overall, as all but two these publications collect and reprint several comic stories from &quot;DWM&quot;, although in most cases the stories are related. Furthermore, the two issues that print original stories in full or part are &quot;The Age of Chaos&quot; (1994) in the &#x27;Specials&#x27; run; and the aforementioned &quot;Classic Comics Autumn Special: Evening’s Empire&quot; (1993), which printed a strip begun but never completed in &quot;Doctor Who Magazine&quot;. Accordingly, the three one-off &#x27;Graphic Novels&#x27; are all reprints from &quot;DWM&quot;, although two of these colourise original black and white strips:

* Doctor Who: Voyager (1989): Collects and reprints four Sixth Doctor stories from the &quot;DWM&quot; main comic strip, including the two stories already reprinted in &quot;Doctor Who Collected Comics&quot; (&quot;DWM&quot; &#x27;Specials&#x27;) three years previous. These appeared in the order of original publication, and all four strips were colourised for the first time.
* Abslom Daak Dalek Killer (1990): Abslom Daak was a character who first appeared in a &quot;DWM&quot; secondary strip in the early years of the publication, when still &quot;Doctor Who Weekly&quot; (1980). The character returned a couple of times in two related secondary strips later that year, before appearing in the main strip alongside the Seventh Doctor after almost a decade (1989). This volume collects all these stories, as well as having an original short story linking the early three secondary strips with the later main strip appearance. The strips appear here, as they did in their original publication, in black and white.
* Doctor Who: The Mark of Mandragora (1993): A Virgin Publishing experiment, who were at the time printing the Virgin New Adventures &quot;Doctor Who&quot; novels (1991–1997) starring the Seventh Doctor. Virgin licensed some Seventh Doctor main comic strips from &quot;DWM&quot; and published them in a graphic novel entitled &quot;Doctor Who: Mark of Mandragora&quot;, reprinting stories that originally appeared between 1990 and 1991, as well as the text story &quot;Teenage Kicks&quot; by Paul Cornell (1990). The strips were colourised.

The list below displays all ten &#x27;Graphic Novels&#x27;, although only the contents of the three stand-alone publications are given here. The seven other publications refer back to the content lists of the sub-sections for &quot;Doctor Who Magazine&quot; &#x27;Specials&#x27; (1980–1996) and &quot;Doctor Who Classic Comics&quot; (Marvel) (1992–1994). This method has been chosen to both give a full overview of the ten &quot;DWM&quot; &#x27;Graphic Novels&#x27; in this section, but also so as to differentiate with those that are part of other series. Numbering has been provided to give some order to these publications (and is reflected in the &#x27;Specials&#x27; and &quot;Classic Comics&quot; sections), but is not official and does not indicate any &#x27;series&#x27; designation.

After Marvel sold &quot;Doctor Who Magazine&quot; to Panini in 1995, the different formats of Graphic Novels would become much more harmonized with the introduction of the &quot;&#x27;Doctor Who&quot; Comic Strip Collected Editions (2004–present)&#x27;. These would reprint &quot;DWM&quot; main strips and strips from parallel publications in large A4 editions. The ethos of the &#x27;Collected Editions&#x27; was and is to print the stories in their original order and format, in other words, reprinting strips originally produced in black and white as black and white. Accordingly, the Marvel era publications with reprinted but colourised strips generally remains the only way to see these stories in Graphic Novel format. There are exceptions, however. Colourised reprints of the early &quot;DWM&quot; black and white strips which had been published in &quot;Doctor Who&quot; Marvel Comics USA (1980–1986) would appear in &quot;Doctor Who Classic Comics&quot; (1992–1994), around the same time as the Marvel Graphic Novels. Then, in January 2008 under a Panini licence, IDW Publishing, an American comic book company, would launch &quot;Doctor Who Classics&quot;, a monthly comic book series reprinting digitally colourised Fourth, Fifth, Sixth and Seventh Doctor strips (2008–2014). The series would go on to be collected in various trade paperbacks, and then some in omnibus editions – both of which can be considered &#x27;Graphic Novels&#x27;. However, these are recoloured digitally while the Marvel era were hand-coloured, so the Marvel Graphic Novels retain a certain uniqueness. From later years of &quot;DWM&quot; when the strip was colourised (beginning issue 300 in 2001), there were also two Panini era &#x27;Special Editions&#x27; (2002–present) that reprinted comic strips for the Ninth Doctor (April 2006) and some of the mid-period Tenth Doctor (April 2008), although these strips went on to also be collected in the &#x27;Collected Editions&#x27;.

=== &quot;DWM&quot; related &quot;Doctor Who&quot; strips (1989–1993) ===

During the late 1980s Marvel UK Comics decided to expand its ranges, and created a number of &#x27;experimental&#x27; comics. Two of these titles launched toward the end of 1989, both of which were edited by Andy Seddon, featured &quot;Doctor Who&quot; content. The Incredible Hulk Presents had an original dedicated stand-alone &quot;Doctor Who&quot; comic strip which ran every issue, alongside reprints of other Marvel USA comic strips. The Death&#x27;s Head situation was far more complex as it was constituted as crossover stories. The already established character of Death&#x27;s Head featured in a main strip of &quot;Doctor Who Magazine&quot;, before going on to have its own comic Deaths Head launched where the Doctor went on to appear in one of the stories. Subsequently, Death&#x27;s Head would return to have another guest appearance in the &quot;Doctor Who Magazine&quot; main strip. Both publications suffered poor sales, and were soon cancelled. However, in 1993, all the Death&#x27;s Head stories, plus those from &quot;DWM&quot; featuring Death&#x27;s Head now specially colourised, were reissued in the pre-planned limited run The Incomplete Death&#x27;s Head series. The content also included a non-Death&#x27;s Head &quot;Doctor Who Magazine&quot; story (again specially colourised), as well as a newly created coda starring the Doctor in the final pages of the final issue.

==== &quot;The Incredible Hulk Presents&quot; (1989) ====

&quot;The Incredible Hulk Presents&quot; was a short-lived weekly comic from Marvel UK. It launched in September 1989 with issue 1, and lasted twelve issues in total. It reprinted stories from US Marvel Comics&#x27; &quot;The Incredible Hulk&quot; from the 1970s; &quot;G.I. Joe: Special Missions&quot; (retitled for the UK as &quot;Action Force&quot;, later &quot;G.I. Joe the Action Force&quot;); and an Indiana Jones strip reprinting Marvel US adaptations of &quot;Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade&quot; and further &quot;Indiana Jones&quot; adventures. All the reprinted US strips were in colour. The only original content was the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; strip, which was, however, produced in black and white. This strip featured ten adeventures (with two two-parters) of the Seventh Doctor.

The &#x27;intention (unbeknownst to the editor of &quot;Doctor Who Magazine&quot;) [was] that the strips would also run in &quot;DWM&quot;. When he found out, John Freeman took issue with the plan, arguing that while the strips had merit for the intended younger audience &quot;IHP&quot; was aimed at, they were inappropriate for &quot;DWM&quot;, which was trying to tailor more for &quot;Doctor Who&quot; fans, instead of the mainstream audience previous editors had aimed for&#x27;. Freeman&#x27;s argument was eventually accepted by Marvel UK as sales figures of &quot;DWM&quot; improved under his leadership; albeit with two exceptions. The two part strip &quot;Hunger at the Ends of Time!&quot; from issues 2 and 3 of &quot;IHP&quot; was reprinted in &quot;DWM&quot; issues 157 and 158 (February – March, 1990); and the one unpublished strip completed for &quot;IHP&quot; issue 13 before the publication was cancelled, &quot;Doctor Conkerer!&quot;, which appeared in &quot;DWM&quot; issue 162 (July 1990).

Andy Seddon, editor of &quot;IHP&quot;, says that the comic folded quite quickly as &#x27;a result of poor sales. I think everyone involved at the editorial level didn&#x27;t think it was a coherent offering&#x27;. As well as the reprint and re-purposing of the two strips mentioned above, four of the strips were soon reprinted in &quot;Doctor Who Classic Comics&quot; (1992–1994) – beginning with issue 21 (June 1992) – now specially colourised (see below). Eventually, all the strips (including the re-purposed &quot;IHP&quot; issue 13 strip printed in &quot;DWM&quot; 162) were reissued in original black and white in the Collected Edition &quot;Doctor Who: Nemesis of the Daleks&quot; (2013).

==== &quot;Death&#x27;s Head&quot; &amp; &quot;Incomplete Death&#x27;s Head&quot; (1989–1993) ====

The character of Death&#x27;s Head was a giant robotic bounty hunter created by writer Simon Furman for the Marvel UK&#x27;s &quot;The Transformers&quot; comic. According to Furman, Death&#x27;s Head was simply a &#x27;throwaway character&#x27; which would &#x27;be discarded down the line (probably at the end of the first story arc)&#x27;. However, when artist Geoff Senior showed Furman the initial character designs, both agreed Death&#x27;s Head had potential beyond his planned transitory appearance. To avoid Hasbro claiming ownership of the character as a consequence of the &quot;Transformers&quot; copyright terms agreed with Marvel, Death&#x27;s Head had to make his debut in another Marvel comic before appearing in &quot;Transformers&quot;. Accordingly, Furman wrote a single-page &quot;Death&#x27;s Head&quot; strip that has become known as &quot;High Noon Tex&quot;, illustrated by Bryan Hitch). In this short strip, Death&#x27;s Head was a noir-ish contract killer of human proportions (thus anticipating the character&#x27;s size and occupation post-&quot;Transformers&quot; appearances). The idea was that the strip would be published in a number of Marvel UK titles prior to appearing in &quot;The Transformers&quot; – although there is no evidence of any such an early publication. Death&#x27;s Head made his debut as the giant robotic bounty hunter in the weekly &quot;The Transformers&quot; comic beginning with issue 113 (16 May 1987), and appearing during this initial run in 13 issues in total: #114, #117-#119, #133-#134, and #146-#151 (ending 6 February 1988).

First Doctor Who crossover: &quot;Doctor Who Magazine&quot; – The character&#x27;s first association with &quot;Doctor Who&quot; happened in the April 1998 edition of &quot;Doctor Who Magazine&quot; (issue 135) in the Seventh Doctor main strip &quot;The Crossroads of Time&quot;. In this story the Doctor and Death&#x27;s Head clashed, the former reducing the latter from a giant robot to human size with &#x27;one of the Master&#x27;s Tissue Compression Eliminators!,&#x27; before sending him to Earth.

Death&#x27;s Head then made a guest appearance in Marvel UK&#x27;s &quot;Dragon&#x27;s Claws&quot; issue 5 (November 1988) in a strip titled &quot;Watch Out Dragon&#x27;s Claws – Here&#x27;s Death&#x27;s Head&quot;. After these guest appearances, Marvel Comics UK launched the full colour USA size-format &quot;Death&#x27;s Head&quot; in December 1988. The publication was issued monthly, with each edition featuring one long comic strip story starring Death&#x27;s Head.

Second Doctor Who crossover: &quot;Death&#x27;s Head&quot; – It was during the &quot;Death&#x27;s Head&quot; comic run that the Seventh Doctor appeared as a central antagonist. In issue 8 (July 1989), the story &quot;Time Bomb!&quot; (not to be confused with a &quot;DWM&quot; Sixth Doctor story of the same name) saw the Doctor with a bounty on his head. Death&#x27;s Head picks up the contract from a long term &quot;Doctor Who Magazine&quot; character and adversary to the Doctor, uber-capitalist Josiah W. Dogbolter.

Despite the first issue of &quot;Death&#x27;s Head&quot; comic prompting a letter from Stan Lee praising the character and creative team, the publication soon folded. The &quot;Death&#x27;s Head&quot; publication was cancelled at issue 10 (September 1989). The following year, Death&#x27;s Head returned in the &quot;Fantastic Four&quot; comic (issue 338; March 1990), with a story titled &quot;Kangs for the Memories!!! Or Guess Who&#x27;s Coming to Diner&quot;. Later the same year Death&#x27;s Head featured in an ongoing story called &quot;The Body in Question&quot; in Marvel&#x27;s short lived &quot;Strip&quot; comic. Beginning in issue 13 (August 1990) and ending in the final issue of the publication (November 1990) the story was later republished as a Death&#x27;s Head graphic novel &quot;Death&#x27;s Head: The Body in Question&quot; (1991). This strip not only resolved the cliffhanger at the end of the cancelled &quot;Death&#x27;s Head&quot; series, but also outlined an origin story (although confusingly, perhaps, Death&#x27;s Head was human sized prior to his confrontation with the Doctor). Death&#x27;s Head then popped up in &quot;The Sensational She-Hulk&quot; (issue 24; February 1991) with the story &quot;Priceless&quot;, and in a short stand-alone strip in &quot;Marvel Comics Presents&quot; (issue 76; March 1991) with &quot;The Deadliest Game&quot;.

Third Doctor Who crossover: &quot;Doctor Who Magazine&quot; – In May 1991, Death&#x27;s Head featured in a cameo role in the &quot;Doctor Who Magazine&quot; main strip in a story called &quot;Party Animals&quot; (issue 173). In the story, the Seventh Doctor attends a party populated by a number of his foes, and witnesses a bar fight explode, in which Death&#x27;s Head plays a contributing factor.

This was essentially the end of original stories in Death&#x27;s Head initial run. However, the character was rebooted as Death&#x27;s Head II for inclusion in Marvel UK&#x27;s next wave of titles. Commissioned by the new editor Paul Neary, &quot;Death&#x27;s Head II&quot; replaced the original character with a new version created by Dan Abnett, Andy Lanning, and Liam Sharp. In an autumn 1992 interview with &quot;Comic World&quot;, Neary was dismissive about the original character, saying &#x27;I didn&#x27;t think there was much future in Transformers-style robots and I thought we could do an awful lot better.&quot; He produced some sample sketches of how he wanted the character to look, and Liam Sharp&#x27;s demo artwork gave the project &#x27;a kickstart&#x27;. &quot;Death&#x27;s Head II&quot; launched with issue 1 in March 1992, and ran for four monthly issues.

Fourth Doctor Who crossover: &quot;The Incomplete Death&#x27;s Head&quot; – Death&#x27;s Head II was an immediate success, which meant Neary was ordered to create more titles. The simplest way to do this quickly was to reprint the original &quot;Death&#x27;s Head&quot; comic series. The job was given to editor John Freeman. &#x27;Paul was ordered to come up with more Death&#x27;s Head titles,&#x27; said Freeman &#x27;and the easiest way to do that was to reprint the original series. That didn&#x27;t mean he liked it... I suggested the &quot;wraparound story&quot; featuring DHII to help convince him&#x27;. The series – which ran for twelve issues – was called &quot;The Incomplete Death&#x27;s Head&quot; (January – December 1993). However, it did not only repeat the original series, but also included a number of other Death&#x27;s Head strips from Marvel publications, pretty much in order of release, the exception being &quot;The Transformers&quot; stories and &quot;The Body in Question&quot; series. Accordingly, the twelve issues of &quot;The Incomplete Death&#x27;s Head&quot; included everything else from &quot;High Noon Tex&quot; through to the &quot;Marvel Comics Presents&quot; story &quot;The Deadliest Game&quot;, as well as beginning (issue 1) and ending (issue 12) with the two &quot;Doctor Who Magazine&quot; strips &quot;The Crossroads of Time&quot; and &quot;Party Animals&quot; – now colourised from their original black and white. Strangely, the publication also incorporated a non-Death&#x27;s Head story early-run (issues 4 and 5), the &quot;Doctor Who Magazine&quot; comic strip &quot;Keepsake&quot; (&quot;DWM&quot; 140; September 1988) once again starring the Seventh Doctor, and once again colourised. This was possible due to way the whole series was framed with the wraparounds, with Death&#x27;s Head II witnessing these past events in an effort to learn more about his original incarnation. In this way, the Doctor&#x27;s status of arch-nemesis of the original Death&#x27;s Head is heightened even before &quot;Time Bomb&quot; appears in issue 9 – the only original &quot;Death&#x27;s Head&quot; series strip featuring the Doctor. Indeed, the final few pages of the final issue – as an untitled coda – have a fourth encounter with the Doctor, specially produced for the publication.

In summary, all of the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; and &quot;Death&#x27;s Head&quot; material is included in &quot;The Incomplete Death&#x27;s Head&quot; series and subsequent graphic novel in colourised form. However, as of 2020, the &quot;Death&#x27;s Head&quot; / &quot;Incomplete Death&#x27;s Head&quot; comic strip of &quot;Time Bomb!&quot; and the Untitled coda comic strip of &quot;Incomplete Death&#x27;s Head&quot; has yet to be reprinted in the &quot;DWM&quot; Collected Editions series. The original &quot;DWM&quot; strips have all been repetrinted – in their original black and white and not their &quot;Incomplete Death&#x27;s Head&quot; colourised form – in &quot;A Cold Day in Hell&quot; (2009) (&quot;The Crossroads of Time&quot; &amp; &quot;Keepsake&quot;) and &quot;The Good Soldier&quot; (2015) (&quot;Party Animals&quot;).

The Death&#x27;s Head character, post &quot;Doctor Who&quot; crossover, would go on to have numerous further adventures continuing as Death&#x27;s Head II and then as a third incarnation, Death&#x27;s Head 3.0, once again created by original Death&#x27;s Head writer Simon Furman.

=== &quot;Doctor Who Classic Comics&quot; (1992–1994) ===

Between 1992 and 1994, Marvel UK published &quot;Doctor Who Classic Comics&quot;. The aim was, as editor Gary Russell stated in the Editorial of the first issue, &#x27;to reproduce every one of the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; strips produced in Britain&#x27;. In the end, the publication only ran for 27 monthly issues, with an additional mid-run &#x27;Autumn Special&#x27; in 1993. Over the 27 issues, the publication reprinted strips predominately from the early Polystyle &quot;Doctor Who&quot; comic strip and the early &quot;TV Century 21&quot; Dalek comic strip, but also from a number of sources including, later in the run, &quot;DWM&quot; itself. As well as reprints, the &#x27;Autumn Special&#x27; featured the comic strip &quot;Evening&#x27;s Empire&quot;, an unfinished story from &quot;DWM&quot; issue 180, here completed for the first time. &quot;Evening&#x27;s Empire&quot;, accordingly, can be seen as a &#x27;Graphic Novel&#x27; and essentially as the only original strip of the publication. The sources were:

*Polystyle comic strip (1964–1979): reprinting selected stories from the First, Second, Third, and Fourth Doctors originally printed in &quot;TV Comic&quot; (#674–999 [1964–1971]); &quot;Countdown&quot; (#1–39 [1971]); &quot;Countdown for TV Action&quot; (#40–56 [1971–1972]); &quot;TV Action in Countdown&quot; (#57–58 [1972]); &quot;TV Action + Countdown&quot; (#59–100 [1972–1973]); &quot;TV Action&quot; (#101–131 [1973]); &quot;TV Comic + TV Action&quot; (#1133–1147 [1973]); &quot;TV Comic&quot; (#1148–1181 [1973–1974]); &quot;TV Comic plus Tom &amp; Jerry Weekly&quot; (#1182–1201 [1974]); &quot;TV Comic&quot; (#1202–1291 [1974–1976]); &quot;Mighty TV Comic&quot; (#1292–1352 [1976–1977]); &quot;TV Comic&quot; (#1353–1392 [1977–1978]); &quot;TV Comic with Target&quot; (#1393–1401 [1978]); and &quot;TV Comic&quot; (#1402–1430 [1978–1979]); as well as one strip from an associated annual: &quot;TV Comic Annual 1976&quot; (1975). Some of these stories were originally in colour; some in part colour (for example one page was colour, the rest of the pages black and white); or in black and white. For &quot;DWCC&quot; all original black and white pages were colourised.
*TV Century 21 comic strip (1965–1967): reprinting Dalek stories which had been &#x27;a huge success&#x27; in DWCC&#x27;s &#x27;sister publication, &quot;Doctor Who Magazine&quot;&#x27; and were &#x27;transferred... to give... more space to re-present them&#x27;. The strip was presented in its original colour format, and ran from issue 1 almost every week, completing in issue 19 (April 1994).
*Dell Movie Classics comic strip (December 1966): a one-off American publication (in the &quot;Dell Movie Classic&quot; series) featuring a story called &quot;Dr. Who and the Daleks&quot; with the Aaru Doctor (alternative First Doctor played by Peter Cushing). This was an adaptation of the &quot;Dr. Who and the Daleks&quot; film from 1965, in turn adapted from the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; television serial &quot;The Daleks&quot; from 1963 to 1964. The reprint appeared in its entirety in &quot;DWCC&quot; issue 9. Printed in original colour.
*Doctor Who Magazine comic strip (1979–1991): &quot;DWCC&quot; reprinted mostly main strips from the Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, and Seventh Doctors; as well as completing the Seventh Doctor story &quot;Evening&#x27;s Empire&quot; in the mid-run &#x27;Autumn Special&#x27; (September 1993). The &quot;DWM&quot; main strip reprints began in &quot;DWCC&quot; issue 9 (July 1993) with a Fourth Doctor story. &quot;DWCC&quot; also reprinted some &quot;DWM&quot; secondary strips (essentially Doctorless), beginning in issue 23. All were originally in black and white (barring two pages of the Fifth Doctor story &#x27;The Tides of Time&#x27; – &quot;DWM&quot; issue 66), and were specially colourised for &quot;DWCC&quot; (even when some had previously been colourised for reprints in &quot;Doctor Who&quot; Comics USA [1980–1986]).
*The Incredible Hulk Presents comic strip (1989): a short run of a parallel Seventh Doctor strip in the short-lived &quot;The Incredible Hulk Presents&quot; comic. It launched in September 1989 with issue 1, and lasted twelve issues in total. It reprinted stories from US Marvel Comics&#x27; &quot;The Incredible Hulk&quot; from the 1970s; &quot;G.I. Joe: Special Missions&quot; (retitled for the UK as &quot;Action Force&quot;, later &quot;G.I. Joe the Action Force&quot;); and an &quot;Indiana Jones&quot; strip reprinting Marvel US adaptations of &quot;Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade&quot; and further Indiana Jones adventures. All these US strips were in colour. The &quot;Doctor Who&quot; strip, however, was in black and white. One story was later printed in &quot;DWM&quot;, Hunger from the Ends of Time!; and one unpublished strip, &quot;Doctor Conkerer!&quot;, was produced for the unprinted issue #13 later being printed in &quot;DWM&quot; 162. &quot;DWCC&quot; reprinted only four of the early stories, over three issues beginning in issue 21. All four one-part strips were colourised.

The comic strips in &quot;Doctor Who Classic Comics&quot; were presented in full colour, meaning strips were colourised when not originally released in colour.

The conclusion of &quot;Doctor Who Classic Comics&quot; was first announced in the Editorial of issue 26. There, assistant editor Marcus Hearn alluded to a &#x27;big finale&#x27; the following month; continuing &#x27;We&#x27;re going out in style with Issue 27 – a special collector&#x27;s edition with a wrap-round cover&#x27; and various other features. Issue 27 appeared with &#x27;Final Jam-Packed Issue!&#x27; on the cover, and Hearn – once again providing the Editorial – echoed the previous issue in implicitly saying that the series had come to a natural end. &#x27;With the finest of the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; strips&#x27;s pre-Marvel heritage reprinted, our work is largely done. Other projects beckon for us&#x27;. With this final issue, &quot;DWCC&quot; completed the full run of the &quot;Countdown&quot; / &quot;TV Action&quot; run (excluding specials and annuals) during the mid-period of the Polystyle Third Doctor strips, before the strips left and then returned to &quot;TV Comic&quot;. However, of the two &quot;TV Comic&quot; periods (First, Second, half of the Third, and Fourth Doctors), only 32 of the potential 152 strips were ever reprinted (just over 20%). The situation was even worse with respect to the fifteen or so years of &quot;Doctor Who Magazine&quot; strips and (admitted far, far shorter run) of &quot;The Incredible Hulk Presents&quot; strips. That the publication was terminated for reasons other than having completed the Third Doctor &quot;Countdown&quot; / &quot;TV Action&quot; strips is the fact that the ongoing &quot;Vworp Vworp&quot; articles, which were printing a chronology of &quot;Doctor Who&quot; comic strips with short synopses, only reached then end of the Third Doctor Polystyle period.

=== &quot;Doctor Who Yearbooks&quot; (1992–1996) ===

Between 1992 and 1996 Marvel UK published a number of &quot;Doctor Who Yearbooks&quot; – essentially annuals – containing articles, comic strips, and short fiction. These continued the tradition of &quot;Doctor Who Annuals&quot; that had been issued under a separate licence from the BBC by World Distributors between 1965 and 1985 (for the years 1966 to 1986); renaming themselves World International, Ltd. in 1981, but due to falling sales limiting their publishing activities before ceasing trading later that decade.

=== &quot;Doctor Who Poster Magazine&quot; (1994–1996) ===

Between 1994 and 1996 Marvel UK published a number of &quot;Doctor Who Poster Magazines&quot;, produced in full colour with visual image based articles, each with a specific theme. After the first six issues the format of the magazine was changed, but only ran for another two issues before being cancelled.

== &quot;DWM&quot; Parallel Publications: Panini Years (1995–present)==

=== &quot;DWM&quot; related &quot;Doctor Who&quot; strips (1996–1997) ===

*Radio Times comic strip (1996–1997)

=== Special Editions (2002–present) ===

From 2002 &quot;Doctor Who Magazine&quot; has been producing a regular series of &quot;Special Editions&quot;, generally released three times a year. These are stand alone magazines themed around a specific topic and carrying a much higher page count than the regular magazine. Over the run, so far, there have been eight themes:

*Doctor Who eras (2002–2014): These issues explored the stories in a Doctor&#x27;s era, sometimes over a number of &#x27;volumes&#x27;. This theme was named The Complete x Doctor for the classic series, and The Doctor Who Companion for the post-2005 series – although the last two of these have different names, the &quot;Official Guide&quot; covering the final part of the Eleventh Doctor&#x27;s final season (April 2014), and &quot;The Year of the Doctor&quot; 50th Anniversary edition (August 2014). This strand of the &quot;Special Editions&quot; came to an end with these two releases, but is continued in the rebooted &quot;Bookazine&quot; series as of 2019 with the Twelfth Doctor.
*Anniversaries (2003–): Beginning with &quot;We Love Doctor Who&quot; (November 2003), celebrating the 40th anniversary of the first broadcast of the TV show, the Special Editions have marked all the major milestones of the programme. In the case of the 50th Anniversary edition (August 2014), this publication also had the function of being the final part of the &quot;Doctor Who eras&quot; thematic, which post-2005 was labelled The Doctor Who Companion (in all but this and the penultimate instalment, tagged an &quot;Official Guide&quot;).
*In Their Own Words (2005–2010): An overview of the programme&#x27;s history produced chronologically. This series collected excerpts from interviews with &quot;Doctor Who&quot; cast and crew over the years 1963 to 2009. The series concluded in 2010.
*Comic strip reprints (2006–2008): The Special Editions became the reprint format for the main comic strip for the Ninth Doctor (April 2006) and some of the mid-period Tenth Doctor (April 2008). These strips were, however, also collected in the Collected Edition format (2004–present) in &quot;The Cruel Sea&quot; (2014) for the Ninth Doctor; and &quot;The Widow&#x27;s Curse&quot; (2009, Collected Tenth Doctor Comic Strips Volume 2).
*Missing Episodes (2013): The three 2013 Special Editions published Telesnaps from missing episodes from the Hartnell and Troughton eras.
*Sarah Jane Adventures (2009–2012): Three special editions between 2009 and 2012 covering the production of the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; television spin-off &quot;The Sarah Jane Adventures&quot;.
*Yearbooks (2015–): Beginning with the 2015 Yearbook (December 2014), these publications are issued once a year looking back over the previous year in &quot;Doctor Who&quot;.
*Topics (2015–): In the wake of the first &quot;Doctor Who Yearbook&quot; (2015; published December 2014), the &quot;Special Editions&quot; devoted the other two releases of 2015 to specific topics: &quot;The Art of Doctor Who&quot; (April 2015) and &quot;The Music of Doctor Who&quot; (August 2015). This pattern of a Yearbook followed by two topics has continued to present.

=== Annual / Storybooks (2006–2010) ===

Panini rebooted these in 2006 with the return of &quot;Doctor Who&quot; to television as an annual. Due to the success of the annual, BBC publishing retrieved the license for that designation, but allowed Panini to continue publishing a yearly Storybook, which they did for another four years.

=== &quot;Doctor Who&quot; Classics (IDW Comics) (2008–2014) ===

In January 2008, IDW Publishing, an American comic book company, launched &quot;Doctor Who Classics&quot;, a monthly comic book series reprinting digitally colourised Fourth, Fifth, Sixth and Seventh Doctor strips from the early issues of DWM. The series was collected in trade paperbacks. The Dave Gibbons Collection was also released in an oversized hardback edition.

=== Doctor Who Insider Magazine (2011–2012) ===

A North American publication that ran for nine issues, with two specials. It was features and articles based, with a more visual approach than &quot;Doctor Who Magazine&quot;. It also carried no comic strip.

=== Bookazines (2013–present) ===

For the 50th anniversary of &quot;Doctor Who&quot; in 2013 three &quot;bookazines&quot; were published under the &quot;Doctor Who – 50 Years&quot; banner, featuring articles on the Doctor, his companions and the Daleks. These continued into 2014 and beyond, renamed &quot;The Essential Doctor Who&quot;, again with three issues released annually. In 2018, with the advent of the Thirteenth Doctor, a special one-off edition bookazine was released as part of the series called &quot;The Story of Doctor Who&quot;. After this, the range continued on with the title &quot;The Essential Doctor Who&quot; for one final release in February 2019. The series was replaced by &quot;The Doctor Who Companion&quot; range, with the same release schedule, beginning in June 2019.

== &quot;Doctor Who&quot;: The Complete History (2015–2019) ==
Beginning on 9 September 2015, Panini published a fortnightly partwork documenting the production of every &quot;Doctor Who&quot; TV story. Content in the partwork was largely based on Andrew Pixley&#x27;s &quot;Archive&quot; features which were initially published in &quot;Doctor Who Magazine&quot; throughout the 80s, 90s and early 2000s and continue in numerous special editions (see above); however, a considerable amount of new material was written exclusively for the books. The 90-part work was published in a multi-volume hardback form, in association with the BBC and Hachette. Each part features 1–4 stories. As is common with part-works, the volumes were not being released in chronological order by broadcast date, but in an order chosen &quot;to reflect the variety and breadth of the series.&quot; In January 2018, it was confirmed that &quot;The Complete History&quot; was extended from 80 volumes to 90, to include all remaining Twelfth Doctor episodes up to &quot;Twice Upon a Time&quot;.

== &quot;Doctor Who&quot; Comic Strip Collected Editions (2004–present) ==

Panini has been collecting the comic sections of the magazines into a number of Collected Editions (trade paperbacks) since 2004, beginning with the Fourth Doctor title &quot;The Iron Legion&quot;. These Collected Editions have not always been published in the order of original publication in &quot;Doctor Who Weekly/Magazine&quot; and its &quot;Yearbooks&quot;, &quot;Specials&quot; and associated publications. Panini have published two or three of these Collected Editions each year from 2004 to 2019, except 2010 and 2011 when the Collected Editions were put on hold.

As of December 2019 there have been 29 volumes released, the most recent being &quot;Ground Zero&quot;, which features strips from the First, Third, Fourth, Fifth, and Seventh Doctors. As Panini have now collected all the main strips up to the end of the Twelfth Doctor continuity, they began focusing upon the &#x27;past Doctors&#x27; period of the magazine (1994–1996, between the end of the Seventh Doctor continuity and beginning of the Eighth Doctor continuity) and other strips from across its publications throughout the years while they built up enough Thirteenth Doctor strips for a Collected Edition. The first Thirteenth Doctor Collected Edition (volume 30) is due in 2020.

The list of volumes below is placed in the original order of their publication in &quot;Doctor Who Magazine&quot;, which parallels the continuity of the television series, except for the &#x27;past Doctors&#x27; period (1994–1996) when the publication began seeding one-off stories from all the past Doctors from the period prior to and including the Seventh. The Collected Editions with these stories are thus placed between the Seventh and Eighth Doctor continuities, except for irregularities, the most substantial being volume 28 &quot;The Clockwise War&quot;, which leads with the final strip of the Twelfth Doctor period, but also includes past Doctor stories from the &quot;Doctor Who Yearbooks&quot; published between 1994 and 1996. Many of the Collected Edition also feature bonus material, such as specially commissioned commentaries by the authors and artists, and sometimes short stories (the latter taken from &quot;Doctor Who Magazine&quot;) – these are signalled in the &#x27;Notes&#x27; of the below table.

<text>Big Finish Productions is a British company that produces books and audio plays (released straight to compact disc and for download in MP3 and m4b format) based, primarily, on science fiction properties. These include &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, the characters Judge Dredd and Strontium Dog from &quot;2000 AD&quot;, &quot;Blake&#x27;s 7&quot;, &quot;Dark Shadows&quot;, &quot;Dracula&quot;, &quot;Terrahawks&quot;, &quot;Sapphire &amp; Steel&quot;, &quot;Sherlock Holmes&quot;, &quot;Stargate&quot;, &quot;The Avengers&quot;, &quot;The Prisoner&quot;, &quot;Timeslip&quot;, and &quot;Torchwood&quot;.

==History==
Founded in 1996, Big Finish in late 1998 began releasing audio plays adapted from the New Adventures, a series of novels from Virgin Books which had originally been licensed &quot;Doctor Who&quot; stories, but by then had become officially independent from the show and were based around the character of Bernice &quot;Benny&quot; Summerfield. In 1999, Big Finish obtained a non-exclusive licence to produce official &quot;Doctor Who&quot; plays, beginning with the multi-Doctor story &quot;The Sirens of Time&quot;. &quot;Doctor Who&quot; and spin-offs have remained the main part of the company&#x27;s output ever since, although they have since diversified. Many of those initially involved in Big Finish had worked on the Audio Visuals fan series of unlicensed &quot;Doctor Who&quot; audio plays.

The name of the company was taken from the episode &quot;The Big Finish&quot; of the 1989-1993 ITV series &quot;Press Gang&quot;.

On 25 July 2019, Big Finish made a statement about equality and diversity in response to requests from fans wishing the company to make a statement on the views expressed by a few individuals they have worked with. The company stated that it is committed to ensuring that those working for the company are protected from discrimination due to age, disability, gender reassignment, marriage, pregnancy or maternity leave, race, religion, sex and sexual orientation.

===Organisation===
Until July 2006, Gary Russell served as producer of the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; audios. When Russell left the company, Jason Haigh-Ellery and Nicholas Briggs took joint responsibility as Co-Executive Producers. Briggs now bears creative responsibility for Big Finish&#x27;s &quot;Doctor Who&quot; range, along with script editor Alan Barnes. David Richardson holds the title of senior producer across all ranges, organising the schedules across the company&#x27;s output, as well as having creative producer responsibility for &quot;The Companion Chronicles&quot;, Lost Stories, and the spin-off &quot;Jago &amp; Litefoot&quot;. The Chairman and co-executive producer of the company is Jason Haigh-Ellery.

===Big Finish Day===
Big Finish Day is a fan convention featuring guest appearances by Big Finish actors. On 11 June 2011, Tenth Planet Events hosted the first Big Finish Day in Barking. On 11 February 2012, a second one was held. As of September 2015, there have been seven Big Finish Days, with more planned.

===Downloads===
In February 2008, Big Finish launched a new download service through their website, which would provide audio plays in MP3 format, free of any digital rights management. They currently provide the large majority of their catalogue in MP3 and M4B format, with very few outstanding exceptions.

In late April 2008, Big Finish released a download subscription service that mirrors its physical CD service. In addition, those who purchase Big Finish productions on CD through the company&#x27;s website receive access to a complimentary download of the story.

In September 2008, they released their first free downloadable play. &quot;&quot; had previously been given away with an issue of &quot;Doctor Who Magazine&quot;.

On February 8, 2017 they announced the Big Finish app.

==Available releases==

===&quot;Doctor Who&quot;===

The &quot;Doctor Who&quot; audio plays have, to date, featured seven of the ten living actors to play the character of the Doctor in the series (Tom Baker, Peter Davison, Colin Baker, Sylvester McCoy, Paul McGann, Christopher Eccleston, and David Tennant), as well as many of the regular supporting actors over the many years of the programme. The late Jon Pertwee&#x27;s voice is featured in the 40th-anniversary story &quot;Zagreus&quot;. His part in the story was pieced together from snippets of Pertwee&#x27;s dialogue from the fan-produced &quot;Doctor Who&quot; video &quot;Devious&quot;. The actor John Hurt also recorded appearances as the War Doctor for Big Finish prior to his death in 2017.

&quot;Destiny of the Doctor&quot;, produced in conjunction with AudioGO, who were rights holders to the 2005–present series, marked the first time Big Finish produced storylines featuring the Ninth, Tenth, and Eleventh Doctors to mark the 50th anniversary of the franchise. In February 2015, Big Finish announced that following a licensing deal with BBC Worldwide, they had been permitted to produce an audio series entitled &quot;UNIT: Extinction&quot;, starring Kate Stewart played by Jemma Redgrave. The debut of the character on audio marks the second time Big Finish have been actively permitted to utilise material introduced in the 2005 revival.

In May 2015, Big Finish announced a new series of &quot;Torchwood&quot;, featuring Captain Jack Harkness (John Barrowman). Since this announcement. In 2017, Big Finish announced six new stories of &quot;Class&quot; featuring original members of the class, as well as a story starring Ace (Sophie Aldred).

On 27 June 2015, it was announced that Big Finish would produce a line of stories featuring River Song and the Eighth Doctor, as well as stories from Winston Churchill (Ian McNeice) and his interactions with the Doctor. Further it was announced that a special set would be released featuring classic Doctors (in this case, the Fifth, Sixth, Seventh, and Eighth Doctors), with new series monsters (The Weeping Angels, the Judoon, the Sycorax, and the Sontarans). The latter story will also connect into the Time War. According to Big Finish&#x27;s website in May 2018, their license was expanded to feature properties set during the Twelfth Doctor&#x27;s era up until &quot;Twice Upon a Time&quot;. This has allowed Big Finish to explore more recent characters and areas from &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, as seen in &quot;Paternoster Gang&quot;; &quot;Jenny, The Doctor&#x27;s Daughter&quot;; and &quot;Tales from New Earth&quot;.

Developments in the 2005 revival TV series also impacted the availability of certain characters. For example, Big Finish was no longer allowed to use the character of Davros, following his return to the series in 2008, although this restriction has since been lifted and Davros returned to Big Finish in &quot;The Curse of Davros&quot; (January 2012). Prior to the character&#x27;s being featured in the new series, he had been used in several plays, portrayed by Terry Molloy, who played Davros in three TV serials in the 1980s. In a 2008 podcast, Nicholas Briggs explained that all scripts are sent through the TV show&#x27;s offices in Cardiff to prevent any potential conflicts in continuity.

The return of Sarah Jane Smith to the continuity of the TV series, and subsequent &quot;The Sarah Jane Adventures&quot; spin-off, resulted in the character&#x27;s no longer being available to Big Finish (forcing the cancellation of an ongoing &quot;Sarah Jane Smith&quot; audio series). According to Briggs, permission from Russell T Davies, producer and creator of &quot;The Sarah Jane Adventures&quot;, had been secured that would have allowed the character (and actress Elisabeth Sladen) to return to Big Finish for a series of stories alongside Tom Baker&#x27;s Fourth Doctor, but Sladen&#x27;s illness and death in April 2011 put an end to those plans.

To celebrate the 50th anniversary of &quot;Doctor Who&quot; in 2013, Big Finish created a series in the style of &quot;The Companion Chronicles&quot; range titled &quot;Destiny of the Doctor&quot; narrated by companions throughout the show&#x27;s history. In addition to this, Big Finish released a multi-doctor story featuring all surviving Doctors of the classic series and almost every companion in &quot;The Light at the End&quot;.

Big Finish also published a series of short story anthologies taking place in the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; universe under the overall title of &quot;Short Trips&quot;. Three &quot;Short Trips&quot; collections were published by BBC Books in the late 1990s, before a hardback short story anthology licence was granted to Big Finish, who took over the name and produced them until their licence to publish such stories was revoked in the spring of 2009. Big Finish currently continues to produce audio-only Short Trips productions.

In 2016, Big Finish&#x27;s licence to produce &quot;Doctor Who&quot; audios was extended to 20 June 2025.

In 2019, Big Finish reached its 20th anniversary of producing &quot;Doctor Who&quot; audios and released a special: &quot;The Legacy of Time&quot; which combined several spin-offs, including UNIT, &quot;The Diary of River Song&quot;, Bernice Summerfield and &quot;Counter-Measures&quot;. Other celebratory releases included the third series of &quot;Ravenous&quot; (featuring almost all Eighth Doctor companions); fourth series of &quot;Ravenous&quot; (featuring multiple incarnations of the Master; the sixth Series of the &quot;Early Adventures&quot; (in which the First Doctor encountered the Second Doctor, as well as using the character of Katerina for the first time); &quot;The Diary of River Song&quot; series 5 (the first appearance of Eric Roberts&#x27; Master since the 1996 film and the return of Missy).

In August 2020, Big Finish announced a new series of audios beginning release in May 2021, featuring Christopher Eccleston reprising his role as the Ninth Doctor (for the first time since his departure from the series in 2005).

In December 2021, Big Finish announced that their license to produce Doctor Who audios was extended until the 31st of March 2030.

In June 2022, Big Finish announced that in November of the same year, the prices of all unreleased boxsets as of that month would see an increase in price due to the rising costs of production and supply costs. These new prices are yet to be announced as of the 15th of September 2022.

====Doctor Who spin-offs====
Other spin-offs include the &quot;Gallifrey&quot; series (with Lalla Ward as Romana, Louise Jameson as Leela and John Leeson as K-9); the &quot;Dalek Empire&quot; series; the &quot;UNIT&quot; series; the &quot;Iris Wildthyme&quot; series starring Katy Manning; the &quot;Sarah Jane Smith&quot; series and the &quot;I, Davros&quot; series. Big Finish have also produced a series of &quot;Doctor Who&quot; plays based on alternative scenarios (for example, what if the Doctor had never left Gallifrey, or had been a woman), collectively titled &quot;Doctor Who Unbound&quot;. This has allowed them to cast other actors in the role of the Doctor, including Sir Derek Jacobi, Arabella Weir and David Warner. In 2013, following the death of original Romana actress Mary Tamm, Big Finish introduced a previously unknown third incarnation of Romana, played by American actress Juliet Landau.

Other spin-off series include &quot;Jago &amp; Litefoot&quot;, featuring Henry Gordon Jago (Christopher Benjamin) and Professor George Litefoot (Trevor Baxter), characters from the 1970s storyline &quot;The Talons of Weng-Chiang&quot;; &quot;Counter-Measures&quot;, featuring a group of scientists featured in 1988&#x27;s &quot;Remembrance of the Daleks&quot;; &quot;Vienna&quot;, focusing on an assassin named Vienna Salvatori (played by former &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&quot; actress Chase Masterson) who was introduced in the Seventh Doctor audio drama &quot;The Shadow Heart&quot;; UNIT, originally focused around the UNIT during the hiatus years of &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, starring the Seventh Doctor (Sylvester McCoy) and Elizabeth Klein (Tracey Childs, who first appeared in &quot;Colditz&quot;) and later became focused on UNIT from the revived series, featuring Kate Stewart (Jemma Redgrave and Osgood (Ingrid Oliver), as well as guest characters Jo Grant, River Song (Alex Kingston) and Doctor Chin Lee (Pik-Sen Lim, who first appeared in &quot;the Ambassadors of Death&quot;).

Two TV spin-offs from the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; universe have been continued in audio form by Big Finish: &quot;Torchwood&quot; and &quot;Class&quot; which has featured the return of several characters from the original cast: Gwen Cooper (Eve Myles), Owen Harper (Burn Gorman), Toshiko Sato (Naoko Mori), Ianto Jones (Gareth David-Lloyd), Rhys Williams (Kai Owen), Andy Davidson (Tom Price), Suzie Costello (Indira Varma), Captain John Hart (James Marsters) and Bilis Manger (Murray Melvin) have all reprised their roles in &quot;Torchwood&quot;. Characters from &quot;Doctor Who&quot; have also appeared in &quot;Torchwood&quot; audios, including Yvonne Hartman (Tracy-Ann Oberman) and Jo Grant. Big Finish have also created several new characters of Torchwood in their continuation of the series from Miracle Day, most notably Tyler Steele (Jonny Green). Starting with January 2017, Big Finish also began releasing the &quot;Torchwood One&quot; series set before the events of Doomsday (Doctor Who).

Other writers for Big Finish include Rob Shearman and &quot;The League of Gentlemen&#x27;s&quot; Mark Gatiss, who have also written for the 2005 relaunch of the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; television series. Shearman&#x27;s 2005 TV episode &quot;Dalek&quot; has been acknowledged as being based upon his Big Finish storyline &quot;Jubilee&quot;.

===&quot;2000 AD&quot;===

Between 2002 and 2004, Big Finish released eighteen audio plays featuring characters from the British sci-fi comic strip anthology magazine &quot;2000 AD&quot;. These consisted of sixteen &quot;Judge Dredd&quot; stories with two additional plays featuring characters from the &quot;Strontium Dog&quot; strip.

The &quot;Judge Dredd&quot; series drew heavily upon Big Finish&#x27;s repertory company established through their &quot;Doctor Who&quot; series with many actors crossing over such as Toby Longworth (who voiced Dredd), Clare Buckfield, Nicholas Briggs, Mark Donovan and Teresa Gallagher who voiced Chief Judge Hershey. The series would also feature many special guest stars such as &quot;The League of Gentlemen&quot;&#x27;s Mark Gatiss playing Judge Death, &quot;Doctor Who&quot; companion actress Nicola Bryant (who would also direct &quot;99 Code Red!&quot;) plus &quot;Blake&#x27;s 7&quot; star Stephen Greif as Efil Drago San. Writers for the series included David Bishop, Dave Stone and James Swallow.

===&quot;Blake&#x27;s 7&quot;===
In July 2011, Big Finish obtained a licence to produce audiobooks and novels based on the BBC television series &quot;Blake&#x27;s 7&quot;. On 1 February 2012, the first collection of audiobooks, &quot;Blake&#x27;s 7: The Liberator Chronicles&quot;, was released featuring original cast members from the television series. Eleven more followed. Since then five series of full cast audio dramas have been released.

===&quot;Earthsearch&quot;===
&quot;Earthsearch&quot; was a BBC Radio 4 radio series written by James Follett which was later adapted as a science fiction novel. However, his prequel novel &quot;Earthsearch Mindwarp&quot; was adapted by Big Finish and broadcast by Digital radio station BBC 7. &quot;Earthsearch Mindwarp&quot; stars a number of actors from the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; range — India Fisher, Nicholas Courtney and Colin Baker.

===&quot;Sapphire &amp; Steel&quot; ===
Big Finish produced and sold three seasons of &quot;Sapphire &amp; Steel&quot; audios on CD until their licence expired. As both actors declined to reprise their original TV roles, Susannah Harker played Sapphire (replacing Joanna Lumley) and David Warner played Steel (replacing David McCallum), although David Collings did reprise his role of Silver from the TV series in several releases.

In March 2024, Big Finish made the stories from all three seasons available once more as digital downloads. This is the first time these have been available in more than a decade.

==Former releases==
===&quot;The Tomorrow People&quot;===
Big Finish also produced and sold 5 seasons of &quot;The Tomorrow People&quot; audios until renewed licence negotiations failed in late 2007, the range was withdrawn in total in December 2008.

<text>Daleks&#x27; Invasion Earth 2150 A.D. is a 1966 British science fiction film directed by Gordon Flemyng and written by Milton Subotsky, and the second of two films based on the British science-fiction television series &quot;Doctor Who&quot;. It stars Peter Cushing in a return to the role of the eccentric inventor and time traveller Dr. Who, Roberta Tovey as Susan, Jill Curzon as Louise and Bernard Cribbins as Tom Campbell. It is the sequel to &quot;Dr. Who and the Daleks&quot; (1965).

The story is based on the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; television serial &quot;The Dalek Invasion of Earth&quot; (1964), produced by the BBC. The film was not intended to form part of the ongoing storylines of the television series. Elements from the programme are used, however, such as various characters, the Daleks and a police box time machine, albeit in re-imagined forms.

==Plot==
Special Constable Tom Campbell encounters a jewellery shop burglary. Running to what appears to be a police box to summon backup, he enters Tardis, a time and space machine operated by its inventor Dr. Who, his niece Louise and granddaughter Susan, as it departs for the future. Arriving in London, 2150 A.D., they find that Daleks have invaded the Earth. Some survivors have become resistance fighters, while captives are either turned into brainwashed &#x27;Robomen&#x27; servants, or forced to labour at a mine in Bedfordshire.

Dr. Who and Tom are captured and imprisoned on a Dalek spaceship. Meanwhile a rebel, Wyler, takes Louise and Susan to a London Underground station resistance base, where they meet fighters including David, and Dortmun who plans to bomb the Dalek spaceship using rebels disguised as Robomen.

On the spaceship, Dr. Who and Tom avoid being robotised when the rebels, including David, Wyler and Louise, attack. Dr. Who escapes with David, while Tom and Louise become trapped on the spaceship. After the attack fails, Wyler returns to the base and informs Dortmun and Susan that Dr. Who escaped. They decide to hide in London&#x27;s outskirts until the rebels can regroup. Susan writes a message about their intentions for Dr. Who, then they commandeer a van. Dortmun is killed by a Dalek patrol, and Wyler and Susan have to abandon the vehicle just before it is destroyed.

Dr. Who and David manage to return to the now deserted underground station. Failing to see Susan&#x27;s message, they assume that Wyler, Dortmun and Susan have gone to Bedfordshire to investigate the mining operation and decide to follow them.

Hiding on the Dalek spaceship, now bound for the mine, Tom and Louise reunite. When the craft lands they escape from it. Finding themselves in the mining complex, they are saved from a Roboman by one of the slave-workers, who hides them in a tool shed.

Wyler and Susan shelter in a cottage, occupied by a mother and daughter. Susan convinces Wyler that Dr. Who would head for the Bedfordshire mine, and that they must follow. The daughter then leaves on an errand, but returns with Daleks who capture Wyler and Susan and take them to their mine control centre.

Near the mine Dr. Who and David are confronted by black marketeer Brockley, who agrees to smuggle them into the complex. By chance, he leads them to the tool shed where Tom and Louise are hiding. They are joined by a prisoner, Conway. He reveals that the Daleks intend to drop a bomb into their mineshaft, to destroy the Earth&#x27;s core and replace it with a device enabling the planet to be piloted like a giant spacecraft. Stolen plans show an old shaft leading to a convergence between the planet&#x27;s magnetic poles. Realising that an explosion at this point would release enough energy to destroy the metallic Daleks, Tom and Conway agree to try deflecting the bomb while Louise and David go to help evacuate the prisoners from the mine. Brockley leaves, refusing to get involved, but returns with a group of Daleks. As Dr. Who is led away the Daleks fire on Brockley, killing him.

Tom and Conway enter the mineshaft but are discovered by a Roboman. During the ensuing fight Conway and the Roboman fall to their deaths. Tom uses old timbers to create a deflecting ramp, then leaves.
Dr. Who is taken to the mine control room and meets Wyler and Susan. He seizes the radio link to the Robomen and orders them to turn against their masters. The Robomen and Daleks fight, while everybody else flees from the mine. The Daleks quickly defeat the rebellion and release their bomb into the shaft, but the device is deflected and detonates at the pole convergence. The Daleks are pulled into the Earth&#x27;s core and destroyed, while their spaceship crashes onto the mine and explodes.

As the travellers prepare to return to the present in Tardis, Tom asks to be taken back to a few minutes before the burglary occurred. Upon arrival, he knocks out the thieves and drives them away in their getaway car, heading for the police station and anticipating a promotion.

A number of the film&#x27;s cast have also had roles in the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; television series. Bernard Cribbins appeared as recurring character Wilfred Mott between 2007 and 2010 and in 2023, during which it is revealed that he is the grandfather of companion Donna Noble. Philip Madoc appeared four times in the series and in a number of Big Finish Productions &quot;Doctor Who&quot; audio adventures in different roles. Eileen Way appeared as Old Mother in the Doctor Who TV serial &quot;An Unearthly Child&quot; and as Karela in &quot;The Creature from the Pit&quot;. Roger Avon appeared as Saphadin in &quot;The Crusade&quot; and as Daxtar in &quot;The Daleks&#x27; Master Plan&quot;. Robert Jewell was a Dalek and creature operator, and David Graham and Peter Hawkins provided Dalek and other voices, in the series.

==Production==
Amicus bought an option to make three Dalek-related stories from Terry Nation and the BBC for £500. Production of the third film, to be based on the serial &quot;The Chase&quot;, was scrapped because of this film&#x27;s under-performance at the box-office. Principal photography commenced at Shepperton Studios, England, on 31 January 1966, and was completed on 22 March, eleven days behind schedule. The film&#x27;s budget of £286,000 was nearly sixty per cent larger than its predecessor.

Production was complicated by the illness of Cushing, which required some rewriting of the script to reduce his on-screen appearances. There were also a number of accidents on set. A Dalek prop caught fire during the filming of rebels storming the Dalek spaceship. Stuntman Eddie Powell broke his ankle during a scene in which his character is killed by the Daleks while trying to escape from them. Actor Andrew Keir hurt his wrist when punching through a van windscreen during a sequence in which his character, Wyler, and Susan escape from London.

The design and colour scheme for the majority of the Dalek props was very similar to that used for the television versions at the time, having large, black bases and predominantly silver paintwork, with grey shoulders, natural aluminium collars and slats and blue hemispheres. Three Dalek leaders are also shown, painted respectively in gold, black and red. As with the first Dalek film, the props were fitted with larger dome light than their TV counterparts, and some were equipped with a mechanical claw in place of the standard plunger. The film marks the first instance of the Daleks using rels as a time measurement, this would be used in comics and later in the revived series.

In January 1984, an article about the two Dalek films appeared in &quot;Doctor Who Monthly&quot; containing production information, photographs and interviews. Another article about the films appeared in the 1995 Spring Special edition of &quot;Doctor Who Magazine&quot;.

In 1995, a documentary about the two Dalek films, &quot;Dalekmania&quot;, was released on video. It revealed details about the productions, spin-offs, and publicity campaigns. It was later included as an extra in many of the home media video releases of the two Dalek films.

==Release==
The film premiered in London on 22 July 1966.

==Marketing==
Of the film&#x27;s £286,000 budget, over £50,000 was spent on promotion.

The breakfast cereal Sugar Puffs sponsored the film and, in an example of product placement, Sugar Puffs signs and products can be seen at various points in the film. In exchange for its funding, the company was also allowed to run a competition on its cereal packets to win a Dalek film prop, and feature the Daleks in its television advertisements.

From 1965 to 1967, the &quot;TV Century 21&quot; comic featured a one-page Dalek comic strip. From January 1966 onward artists Eric Eden and Ron Turner depicted the Daleks using elements from the film design, including mechanical claws and large bases and dome lights. During the run of the strip, the comic also often featured photographs from, and articles about, the films.

==Critical response==
The film was given a negative review in &quot;The Times&quot; newspaper on 21 July 1966: &quot;The second cinematic excursion of the Daleks shows little advance on the first... The filming of all this is technically elementary... and the cast, headed by the long-suffering, much ill-used Peter Cushing, seem able, unsurprisingly, to drum up no conviction whatever in anything they are called to do. Grown-ups may enjoy it, but most children have more sense.&quot;

Alan Jones of the &quot;Radio Times&quot; gave the film three stars out of five in a retrospective review in 2015, stating &quot;&quot;Independence Day&quot; it&#x27;s not, but director Gordon Flemyng keeps the colourful action moving swiftly along to cheap and cheerful effect. Youngsters will love it, while adults will want to E-X-T-E-R-M-I-N-A-T-E Bernard Cribbins, who provides comic relief as the bumbling bobby. Yet, through all the mindless mayhem roll the ever-impressive Daleks, truly one of science fiction&#x27;s greatest alien creations.&quot;

In a review of the 2013 Blu-ray release, &quot;&quot;Starburst&quot;&quot; reviewer Paul Mount said the feature was &quot;a leaner, slicker film than its predecessor, its bigger scale and lavish location filming giving the story room to breathe and allowing for some effective action sequences, such as the rebel attack on the impressive Dalek flying saucer.&quot;

==Radio adaptation==
The film&#x27;s soundtrack was adapted and presented by Gordon Gow for radio broadcast on the BBC Light Programme on 18 November 1966 as &quot;Show 305&quot; of the &quot;Movietime&quot; series. It was produced by Tony Luke.

<doc id="359025" wikidata="Q8021615" url="?curid=359025" title="Willie Jorrín">
<text>Guillermo Jaime Jorrín (born November 12, 1969), known as Willie Jorrín, is a Mexican-American former professional boxer who competed from 1993 to 2003. He held the WBC super bantamweight title from 2000 to 2002. Jorrín was trained by five-time Trainer of the Year Freddie Roach.

==Amateur career==
Jorrín lost to Wayne McCullough as an amateur in Portland, Oregon.

==Professional career==
Willie made his professional debut on February 12, 1993, with a first round knockout victory over Esau Diegues. This was the first of three consecutive first-round knockout victories for Jorrín. On October 1 of that year, Pat Chávez became the first person to go the distance with Jorrín, losing a six-round decision to the Sacramento fighter.

He faced Enrique Jupiter on June 7, 1997. Jupiter was a ranked contender and Jorrín beat him by a ten-round unanimous decision. Jorrín then became a ranked challenger by the WBC. Jorrin outpointed Juan Luis Torres, also over ten rounds, on December 4, 1997.

Jorrín won all three of his fights in 1998, including a four-round knockout over Enrique Valenzuela. He kept his winning ways in 1999, winning three fights, among them, a twelve-round decision over Aristead Clayton and a five-round knockout over Juan Luis Torres in a rematch. After those wins, he was ranked as the world&#x27;s number one contender by the WBC.

===WBC Super Bantamweight Championship===
In September 2000, Jorrín took on the road, going to Manchester, England, where he became world champion by beating Michael Brodie on September 9 with a majority decision for the WBC&#x27;s world Super Bantamweight title.

For his first defense, he won over Óscar Larios by decision in twelve back home in Sacramento on an ESPN televised fight on January 19, 2001. He then went to Japan, where he dropped Osamu Sato in round three of his second defense, but was only given a draw (tie) by the judges on February 5, 2002. Then Willie lost to Larios in a rematch, Jorrín lost his WBC&#x27;s world title.

Jorrín started a quest to try to recover his world title almost immediately, and on April 25, 2003, he beat John Hoffman by a knockout in two rounds at Rosemont, Illinois. In his next fight, on November 6 at Phoenix, however, he suffered a setback, losing by unanimous decision in ten rounds to Christian Favela. He retired after that contest.

<text>The year 1998 in science and technology involved many events, some of which are included below.

==Astronomy and space exploration==
* January–September – Cosmologists from the Supernova Cosmology Project led by Saul Perlmutter and the High-z Supernova Search Team led by Adam Riess and Brian Schmidt publish evidence that the expansion rate of the universe is increasing.
* January 6 – The Lunar Prospector spacecraft is launched into orbit around the Moon and later finds evidence for frozen water on the Moon&#x27;s surface.
* February 26 – Total solar eclipse
* March 2 – Data sent from the Galileo space probe indicates that Jupiter&#x27;s moon Europa has a liquid ocean under a thick crust of ice.
* March 5 – NASA announces that the Clementine probe orbiting the Moon has found enough water in polar craters to support a human colony and rocket-fuelling station.
* March 13 – Penumbral lunar eclipse
* July 5 – Japan launches a probe to Mars, and thus joins the United States and Russia as a space-exploring nation.
* August 8 – Penumbral lunar eclipse
* August 22 – Annular solar eclipse
* September 6 – Penumbral lunar eclipse
* October 29 – Space Shuttle &quot;Discovery&quot; blasts-off with 77-year-old John Glenn on board, making him the oldest person to go into space up to that time. He became the first American to orbit Earth on February 20, 1962.
* November 20 – Zarya, the first module of the International Space Station, is launched.
* The first of four 8.4 m reflecting telescopes opens in the Very Large Telescope program of the European Southern Observatory at Cerro Paranal in Chile.

==Botany==
* The Angiosperm Phylogeny Group publishes the first version of the APG System of plant classification.

* Tiger Electronics launch the Furby electronic toy, the first domestic robot.

==Geology==
* February 4 – The 5.9 Afghanistan earthquake shakes the Takhar Province with a maximum Mercalli intensity of VII (&quot;Very strong&quot;). With 2,323 killed, and 818 injured, damage is considered extreme.
* March 14 – An earthquake measuring 6.9 on the Richter scale hits southeastern Iran.
* May 30 – A 6.6 magnitude earthquake hits northern Afghanistan killing up to 5,000.
* July 17 – The 7.0 Papua New Guinea earthquake shakes the region near Aitape with a maximum Mercalli intensity of VIII (&quot;Severe&quot;). This submarine earthquake triggered a landslide that caused a destructive tsunami, leaving 2,183–2,700 dead and thousands injured.

==Mathematics==
* Luca Cardelli and Andrew D. Gordon develop ambient calculus.
* Thomas Callister Hales (almost certainly) proves the Kepler conjecture.

==Paleontology==

<text>The Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority (LACMTA), branded as Metro, is the county agency that plans, operates, and coordinates funding for most of the public transportation system in Los Angeles County, California, the most populated county in the United States.

The agency directly operates a large transit system that includes bus, light rail, heavy rail (subway), and bus rapid transit services. Metro also provides funding for transit it does not operate, including Metrolink commuter rail, municipal bus operators and paratransit services. The agency also provides funding and directs planning for railroad and highway projects within Los Angeles County.

In , the Metro system had a total ridership of , and had a ridership of per weekday as of . It is the largest transit agency by ridership in the state of California, and the third-largest in the United States.

== Background ==
The Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority was formed on February 1, 1993, by the California State Legislature which merged two rival agencies: the Southern California Rapid Transit District (SCRTD or more often, RTD) and the Los Angeles County Transportation Commission (LACTC).

The RTD was founded on August 18, 1964, to operate most public transportation in the urbanized Southern California region, including Los Angeles, San Bernardino, Orange, and Riverside counties. RTD replaced the major predecessor public agency, the Los Angeles Metropolitan Transit Authority, and took over eleven failing other bus companies and services in the Southern California region. Services outside of Los Angeles County began to be divested in the early 1980s.

The LACTC began operation in 1977 after a state requirement that all counties form local transportation commissions. Its main objective was to be the guardian of all transportation funding, both transit and highway, for Los Angeles County.

The bickering between the two agencies came to a head in the 1980s. At that time, the LACTC was building the Blue Line (now A Line) light rail line between Los Angeles and Long Beach, while the RTD was building the Red Line (now B Line) subway in Downtown Los Angeles. It was revealed that due to disputes between the agencies, the LACTC was planning to end the Blue Line at Pico Station, instead of serving the 7th Street/Metro Center station being built by the RTD six blocks north.

LA Metro has assumed the functions of both agencies and now develops and oversees transportation plans, policies, funding programs, and both short-term and long-range solutions to mobility, accessibility and environmental needs in the county. The agency is also the primary public transit provider for the city of Los Angeles, the second largest city in the United States, providing the bulk of such services. even though the city&#x27;s own Los Angeles Department of Transportation LADOT operates a smaller bus only public transit system of its own called DASH within the MTA service area in the city of Los Angeles, often overlapping with some Metro Bus routes and stops in several neighborhoods primarily in the central part of the city.

Since 1995 the agency has been based out of the Metro Headquarters Building, a 26-story high-rise office tower located next to Union Station, a major transportation hub and the main train station for the Los Angeles metropolitan area, which it has also owned since purchasing it in 2011.

The Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority operates the third-largest public transportation system in the United States by ridership with a 1,433 mi2 (3,711 km2) operating area and 2,000 peak hour buses on the street any given business day. Metro also operates of urban rail service. The authority has 10,290 employees, making it one of the region&#x27;s largest employers.

The authority also partially funds sixteen municipal bus operators and an array of transportation projects including bikeways and pedestrian facilities, local roads and highway improvements, goods movement, Metrolink regional commuter rail, Freeway Service Patrol and freeway call boxes within the County of Los Angeles.

To increase sustainability in transportation services, Metro also provides bike and pedestrian improvements for the over 10.1 million residents of Los Angeles County.

Security and law enforcement services on Metro property (including buses and trains) are currently provided by the Transit Services Bureau via contract, in conjunction with Metro Transit Enforcement Department and the Los Angeles Police Department (Union Station and all LACMTA rail services within the City of Los Angeles).

== Services ==

: is a light rail line running between South Los Angeles and Inglewood, and between Westchester and Redondo Beach. The service gap between Inglewood and Westchester will be filled when LAX/Metro Transit Center station opens in 2025.

=== Metro Bus ===
Metro is the primary bus operator in the Los Angeles Basin, the San Fernando Valley, and the western San Gabriel Valley until Arcadia going east. Other regions of Los Angeles County, including the Antelope Valley and the eastern San Gabriel Valley, are served by separate bus operators, which receive some funding from Metro.

, the Metro Bus system includes 117 routes, serving over 11,000 bus stops. Most Metro Bus lines are local services, stopping at marked stops approximately every two blocks. Limited-stop Metro Rapid services stop only at major intersections, and Metro Express services utilize the extensive Southern California freeways to provide nonstop service between regional destinations.

=== Metro Busway ===
Metro Busway is a bus rapid transit system with two lines operating on dedicated or shared-use busways. The system runs a total of , with 29 stations and over 42,000 daily weekday boardings as of May 2016.

The Metro Busway system is meant to mimic the Metro Rail system, both in the vehicle&#x27;s design and in the operation of the line. Vehicles stop at dedicated stations (except for the portion of the Metro J Line in Downtown Los Angeles), vehicles receive priority at intersections and are painted in a silver livery similar to Metro Rail vehicles.

: is a bus rapid transit line running between Chatsworth and North Hollywood. Some trips terminate in Canoga Park.
: is a bus rapid transit line running between El Monte, Downtown Los Angeles, and Harbor Gateway, with some trips continuing to San Pedro.

=== Busways ===
The Metro Busway J Line operates over two busways, semi-exclusive roadways built into the Southern California freeway system. These busways are also used by other bus routes to speed up their trips.
* The El Monte Busway is a combination busway and high-occupancy toll (HOT) roadway that runs in the median of the San Bernardino Freeway (I-10) and on a separate right-of-way. The busway provides express bus service between Downtown LA and the San Gabriel Valley. Services on the busway are operated by both Metro and Foothill Transit.
* The Harbor Transitway is a combination busway and HOT roadway that runs in the median of the Harbor Freeway (I-110). The busway provides express bus service between San Pedro and Downtown LA. Services on the busway are operated by Metro, GTrans, LADOT, OC Bus and Torrance Transit.

=== Other services ===
* Metro Art: A program of the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority that commissions and integrates public art into Metro stations and facilities to enhance the transit experience of Los Angeles County.
* Metro Bike Share: A bicycle-sharing system in Downtown LA, Central LA, Hollywood, North Hollywood and on the Westside.
* Metro ExpressLanes: High-occupancy toll lanes on the El Monte Busway and Harbor Transitway.
* Metro Freeway Service Patrol: A joint effort between Metro, Caltrans, and the California Highway Patrol offering free quick-fix repairs and towing from freeways.

* Bike paths: of bike facilities for commuter and recreational purposes.
* HOV (Carpool) Lanes: , both directions/each lane, of carpool, vanpool, and express bus lanes.
*Metrolink: Partially funded by Metro, it is Southern California&#x27;s regional commuter rail system.
*&quot;Pacific Surfliner&quot;: Partially funded by Metro. Metro has two board seats in the LOSSAN Rail Corridor Agency

=== Fares and fare collection ===
The base fare for Metro services, including local and express buses and Metro Rail, is $1.75. Metro introduced daily and weekly fare caps in July 2023, replacing daily, weekly, and monthly passes. With fare capping, the cost of each trip is credited towards the cost of a daily or weekly unlimited pass, automatically ensuring that all passengers pay the lowest fare possible. Discounted or free fares are available for seniors, disabled individuals, Medicare recipients, low-income individuals, and students.

The primary method of payment for Metro fares is the TAP card, a contactless stored-value card. TAP cards are valid on Metro buses and trains, and on 25 other transit agencies in Los Angeles County. TAP cards are required for Metro Rail trips, free bus transfers, and fare capping; however, single-ride bus fares can still be paid in cash. TAP cards can be purchased at station fare machines, local vendors, online, and at Metro Customer Care Centers.

Fare gates are installed at all B, C, D and K Line stations, along with select A and E Line stations. Fare gates were added after 2007 to reduce fare evasion. At the time, the decision was criticized for its cost and perceived ineffectiveness.

== Ridership ==

The Metro A Line has the highest ridership of all Metro Rail lines and also the lowest operational cost because of its high ridership. The Metro Rail Metro K Line has the lowest ridership of all letter-branded lines. Average daily boardings and passenger miles for all of 2024 are as follows:
== Governance ==
Day-to-day operations of Metro is overseen by Chief Executive Officer Stephanie Wiggins. Metro is a joint powers authority governed by a board of directors with 14 members, 13 of whom are voting members. The Board is composed of:
* The five members of the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors
* The mayor of the city of Los Angeles
* Three people appointed by the mayor of Los Angeles, at least one of whom must be member of the Los Angeles City Council.
* Four city council members or mayors from LA County cities other than Los Angeles, who each represent one region of the county: San Gabriel/Pomona Valley, Arroyo/Verdugo, Gateway Cities and Westside Cities
* One non-voting member appointed by the Governor of California (traditionally the Director of Caltrans District 7)

While the Metro board makes decisions on large issues, they rely on Service Councils to advise on smaller decisions, such as on bus stop placement and over bus service changes. To enable this work, the councils call and conduct public hearings, evaluate Metro programs in their area, and meet with management staff. There are five Service Councils, each representing a different region: Gateway Cities, San Fernando Valley, San Gabriel Valley, South Bay, and Westside/Central. Each council is led by a board composed of a political appointees.

Members of Metro staff also sit on the boards of other joint powers authorities across the region, including the LOSSAN Rail Corridor Agency, the Alameda Corridor Transportation Authority, the Foothill Gold Line Construction Authority, the Southern California Regional Rail Authority, the High Desert Corridor Joint Powers Agency, and the Inglewood Transit Connector Joint Powers Authority.

== Funding ==
A complex mix of federal, state, county and city tax dollars as well as bonds and fare box revenue funds Metro.

The Metro budget for 2020 is $7.2 billion. Below is the funding breakdown from Metro&#x27;s fiscal year 2020 budget:
== Jurisdiction ==
The agency is a public transportation and planning agency that lies under the jurisdiction of the State of California. Although it falls under State regulations, it can also partake in regional and municipal levels of rule during a transportation development project. For example, it can play a role in policies regarding a state&#x27;s housing policies, since the living situation of one affects the methods of transportation its residents will take.

This transit agency can measure successful projects through key pointers such as low income ridership increase and an increase of favorable environmental and health factors for its public community. Increased low income ridership is a significant factor because that focus group tends to makes up the majority of public transit ridership. Favorable environmental and health factors are also relevant factors because they indicate a positive relationship within the space developed and its residents.

== Fleet ==
Most of Metro&#x27;s bus fleet is powered by compressed natural gas (CNG), the largest such fleet in the United States. Using CNG reduces emissions of particulates by 90%, carbon monoxide by 80%, and greenhouse gases by 20% compared to diesel powered buses. The agency is also operating a substantial number of battery electric buses, notably on the G Line busway which has seen all CNG buses replaced with battery electric ones, and has plans to convert into a fully electric bus system. Buses feature on-board visual displays and automatic voice announcement systems that announce the next stop.

The Metro Rail fleet is broken down into two main types: light rail vehicles and rapid transit cars (commonly called subway cars in Los Angeles). Metro&#x27;s light rail vehicles, used on the A, C, E, and K lines, are articulated, high-floor double-ended cars, powered by overhead catenary lines, which typically run in two or three car consists. The light rail lines consist of the Kinki Sharyo P3010, Siemens P2000, and the Ansaldobreda P2550. Metro&#x27;s retired LRV fleet is the Nippon Sharyo P865/P2020 fleet. Metro’s subway cars, used on the B and D Lines, are electric multiple unit, married-pair cars, powered by electrified third rail consisting of the CRRC HR4000 and the Breda A650 fleet, that typically run in four or six car consists.

== Future ==
=== NextGen Bus Plan ===
Metro is currently implementing its &quot;NextGen Bus Plan,&quot; a major restructuring of the agency&#x27;s routes. The plan eliminates most of the Metro Rapid routes and low-performing Metro Local lines to invest in the remaining routes. Metro says the plan will double the number of frequent bus lines (defined as a bus every 10 minutes or better) and expand midday, evening, and weekend service while ensuring that 99% of current riders continue to have a less than -mile walk to their bus stop.

=== D Line Extension ===
Section 1 of the D Line Extension will add three new subway stations to the D Line at Wilshire/La Brea, Wilshire/Fairfax, and Wilshire/La Cienega. Construction on Section 1 began in 2014 and is expected to be complete in 2025. Section 2 to Century City is expected to be completed in 2026, followed by Section 3 to Westwood in 2027.

=== Foothill Extension ===

The Foothill Gold Line Construction Authority (Foothill Gold Line) is constructing an extension of the A Line (formerly the Gold Line) east from the former Gold Line terminus at Sierra Madre Villa station in Pasadena. The first phase of this extension to APU/Citrus College station in Azusa, Phase 2A, opened on March 5, 2016. Groundbreaking for the first part of the second phase to Pomona North station in Pomona, Phase 2B, occurred on December 2, 2017, with construction starting in July 2020 and completing on January 3, 2025. An opening date is currently expected for sometime in August 2025 or later in the summer, following pre-revenue testing. The second part of Phase 2B will further extend the line two stations to Montclair Transcenter in Montclair, located in San Bernardino County, is planned to break ground in spring 2025 and be completed in 2030.

=== Los Angeles Aerial Rapid Transit ===

Metro, in partnership with LA Aerial Rapid Transit Technologies LLC, is currently proposing to construct an aerial gondola system to connect Dodger Stadium and the stadium&#x27;s surrounding communities to Union Station in Downtown Los Angeles. When completed, the approximate 5,000 people per hour, per direction aerial gondola is expected to transport visitors from Union Station to Dodger Stadium in approximately seven minutes. Additionally, the proposed project would also include several improvements to the nearby Los Angeles State Historic Park.

=== Long-range Measure M plans ===
Measure M, passed in November 2016, extends and increases the Measure R 30-year half-cent sales tax to a permanent one-cent sales tax. This tax is expected to fund $120 billion in highway and transit projects over 40 years. The tax is also expected to support over 778,000 jobs in the Los Angeles area and $79.3 billion in economic output.

Projects to be funded by Measure M, not previously mentioned above, include:
* A streetcar in Downtown Los Angeles
* The Los Angeles County portion of the High Desert Corridor: a freeway, rail transit, and bikeway corridor linking cities in the Antelope and Victor Valleys. Caltrans put the freeway on hold in 2019.
* Bus Rapid Transit connecting the G and B Lines in North Hollywood with the A Line in Pasadena
* Conversion of the G Line from Bus Rapid Transit to Light Rail
* Light Rail along Van Nuys Boulevard to San Fernando (East San Fernando Valley Light Rail Transit Project)
* Light Rail along the West Santa Ana Branch from Union Station to Artesia
* Bus Rapid Transit along Vermont Avenue between the B Line at Hollywood Boulevard and the C Line at 120th Street.
* Southern extension of the C Line to Torrance Transit Center
* Eastern extension of the C Line to the Norwalk/Santa Fe Springs Metrolink station
* Heavy Rail tunnel underneath or monorail over the Sepulveda Pass linking the G Line in the San Fernando Valley and the D Line at Westwood/UCLA
* Heavy Rail or Monorail extension from the D line at Westwood/UCLA to LAX
* Extension of the E Line from East Los Angeles with a branch to Whittier next to the San Gabriel River
* Bus Rapid Transit from LAX to the E Line at Santa Monica along Lincoln Boulevard.
* Bus Rapid Transit in the North San Fernando Valley (downgraded to local bus improvements)

<doc id="359035" wikidata="Q239773" url="?curid=359035" title="Garbage (album)">
<text>Garbage is the debut studio album by Scottish/American rock band Garbage. It was released on August 15, 1995, by Almo Sounds. The album was met with critical acclaim upon its release, being viewed by some as an innovative recording for its time. It reached number 20 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and number six on the UK Albums Chart, while charting inside the top 20 and receiving multi-platinum certifications in several territories. The album&#x27;s success was helped by the band promoting it on a year-long tour, including playing on the European festival circuit and supporting the Smashing Pumpkins throughout 1996, as well as by a run of increasingly successful singles culminating with &quot;Stupid Girl&quot;, which received Grammy Award nominations for Best Rock Song and Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group in 1997.

In October 2015, the album was reissued to mark its 20th anniversary, featuring remastered tracks from the original analog tapes, as well as remixes and previously unreleased alternate versions of songs from the album.

==Background==
In 1983, Butch Vig and Steve Marker founded Smart Studios in Madison, Wisconsin, and Vig&#x27;s production work brought him to the attention of Sub Pop. Vig&#x27;s old band Spooner reunited in 1990 and released another record, but disbanded in 1993 as Vig&#x27;s and Marker&#x27;s careers as producers gained strength. In 1994, as Vig became &quot;kind of burned out on doing really long records&quot;, he got together with Duke Erikson and Marker, and they started producing remixes for acts such as U2, Depeche Mode, Nine Inch Nails and House of Pain, featuring different instrumentation and often highlighting new guitar hooks and bass grooves. The experience inspired the three men to form a band, in which they &quot;wanted to take that remix sensibility and somehow translate it into all of the possibilities of a band setup.&quot; An early comment that their work sounded &quot;like garbage&quot; inspired the band&#x27;s name.

Shirley Manson had been performing with the Edinburgh-based rock band Goodbye Mr Mackenzie since 1984. In 1993, several of the members, including Manson, formed the side project Angelfish. Their only studio album, &quot;Angelfish&quot;, was as commercially unsuccessful as preceding albums by Goodbye Mr Mackenzie, selling only 10,000 copies.

Initial sessions with Vig on vocals and the members&#x27; past work with all-male groups led to the band&#x27;s desire for a woman on lead. Marker was watching &quot;120 Minutes&quot; when he saw the one-time airing of the music video for Angelfish&#x27;s &quot;Suffocate Me&quot;. He showed the video to Erikson and Vig while their manager, Shannon O&#x27;Shea, tracked Manson down. When Manson was contacted, she didn&#x27;t know who Vig was and was urged to check the credits on Nirvana&#x27;s album &quot;Nevermind&quot;, which Vig had produced. On April 8, 1994, Manson met Erikson, Marker and Vig for the first time in London. Later that evening Vig was informed of Kurt Cobain&#x27;s suicide. Garbage was put on hold as Angelfish was touring North America in support of Live. Erikson, Marker and Vig attended the Metro Chicago date, and Manson was invited to Madison to audition for the band. The audition did not go well, but Manson socialized with the men while there and they found they had a similar taste in music. Angelfish disbanded at the end of the Live tour. Manson called O&#x27;Shea and asked to audition again, feeling that &quot;it would work out&quot;.

==Recording==
In her return to Smart Studios, Manson began to work on skeletal versions of the songs &quot;Queer&quot;, &quot;Vow&quot; and &quot;Stupid Girl&quot;. While looking for a record deal for the album, Garbage sent out demo tapes with no bio, to avoid a bidding war over Vig&#x27;s production history. Garbage signed with Mushroom Records UK worldwide and to Jerry Moss&#x27;s label Almo Sounds for North America. Manson&#x27;s contribution was licensed to both Mushroom and Almo by her label Radioactive Records.

Garbage continued to work on the album throughout the start of 1995, delayed by Vig&#x27;s work producing Soul Asylum&#x27;s &quot;Let Your Dim Light Shine&quot; album and the songs being &quot;piecemealed together in the studio&quot;. Vig described the composing process as a &quot;dysfunctional democracy&quot; where someone would bring a loop or a sample, which was followed by jam sessions in which the band members would &quot;find one bar that&#x27;s kind of cool, load that into our samplers, jam on top of that, [and] Shirley will ad-lib&quot;, with the process continuing until the song was finished, often with &quot;all of the original ideas gone, and the song had somehow mutated into something completely different.&quot; Among the songs that were completely reworked, &quot;As Heaven Is Wide&quot; went from &quot;a big rock track&quot; to a techno-style song with Tom Jones-inspired beats, only keeping Erikson&#x27;s fuzz bass and Manson&#x27;s vocals from the original recording. Given Vig &quot;got bored spending so many years recording really fast, straightforward punk records&quot;, the band &quot;didn&#x27;t want to approach the Garbage record from the angle of a band playing live&quot;, making their songs out of samples that would be processed and reworked in a Wall of Sound process &quot;to create something that sounded fresh.&quot;

A major part of the work involved Manson rewriting the song lyrics, which Vig said the band attempted to &quot;write from a woman&#x27;s perspective and I think, initially, some of them were a little pretentious. But as soon as Shirley came on board she simplified the lyrics so that they were a lot more subtle and worked better as songs.&quot; Manson detailed that regarding the previous song sketches, &quot;some of the ideas for lyrics I found unsuitable, and others I liked and worked on with them. I always went to bat for what I believed in.&quot; She added that because &quot;the lyrics take a while to work on&quot; bandmates would give suggestions and she included the ones that fancied her.

When Garbage began to collate the material for career retrospective &quot;Absolute Garbage&quot; in 2007, the &quot;Garbage&quot; analog masters could not be found. Vig and audio engineer Billy Bush were able to track down an archived, but rather incomplete and damaged, set of 16-bit 44.1 kHz safety DAT mixes. Despite the condition of the backups, mastering engineer Emily Lazar at The Lodge in New York City was able to reverse-engineer the missing songs from the damaged archive. Lazar used some alternate versions of the songs when completing the final master. Her assistant, Joe LaPorta, mastered and edited the remixes for the special edition.

==Composition and style==
&quot;Garbage&quot; has a sound that &quot;tr[ied] to incorporate different styles and genres, throw it all into a big melting pot and see what would happen&quot;, according to Vig. Vig explained that as in his opinion &quot;the most exciting bands are those who incorporate all those elements of punk, funk, techno, hip hop, etc.&quot; Garbage would attempt to do the same and &quot;take those influences and make them work in the context of a pop song.&quot; The band went overboard with experimentation, with Erikson adding that throughout they liked to include &quot;sounds that we found accidentally, like Steve&#x27;s sample of a tape deck backing up, or the bit in &#x27;Stupid Girl&#x27; that was initially a mistake, but when we slowed it down, actually fit the timbre and pace of the song and became the hook.&quot;

The lyrics on the record were described by the band members as &quot;a collaborative psycho-therapy session wherein personal demons of various sizes and importance are exorcised, vilified, taken revenge upon and laid to rest.&quot; Vig said they tried to deal with &quot;dark themes that I think a lot of people can relate to in some way or another&quot;, which included voyeurism, hedonism, perversion, obsession and &quot;the art of self-destruction.&quot; Manson stated that even though she put together most of the songs, &quot;everybody has ideas that come to the table and I just use what I fancy. When we&#x27;re working on something, the lyrics take a while to work on and [they] come to me and say &#x27;I&#x27;ve had these ideas, use them if you want&#x27; and if there&#x27;s something I like, I&#x27;ll stick it in with my own, or vice-versa. Some people come in going &#x27;I&#x27;ve got this great title for a song&#x27; and I might use that.&quot; Manson remarked that while the content was &quot;a lot more poppy&quot; than most of her previous work, the songs invoked the dark side of her nature, as &quot;sometimes I&#x27;m a wee bit creepy, and that definitely comes out in the music.&quot; She also declared that music &quot;unlocks sensations and feelings that you keep inside, that society doesn&#x27;t allow you to show&quot;, saying that the gist of a mean-spirited song like &quot;Vow&quot; is very real despite &quot;none of us hav[ing] ever really acted on those feelings&quot;. Vig added that the band was eager to exploit the contrast between words and music: &quot;The initial idea was to make this a dark lyric with a shiny, happy, pop sensibility. You could be singing this really catchy line and realize the lyrics were totally wacked.&quot;

In May 2017, Manson revealed during an interview with Yahoo! that the song &quot;Fix Me Now&quot; was originally titled &quot;Chris Cornell&quot;, because she was obsessed with the lead singer of Soundgarden. A demo version of the song features Manson singing Cornell&#x27;s name.

Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic stated that the album &quot;has all the trappings of alternative rock—off-kilter arrangements, occasional bursts of noise, a female singer with a thin, airy voice, but it comes off as pop&quot; because of Vig&#x27;s &quot;glossy production&quot;. Erlewine characterized the sound of the record as &quot;slick and professional&quot;, full of &quot;well-crafted pop songs&quot;, including &quot;trashy alternative pop gems&quot; like &quot;Queer&quot; and &quot;Vow&quot;. &quot;The A.V. Club&quot;″s Stephen Thompson described the album as &quot;a prototypically &#x27;90s record full of pumped-up, electronically enhanced, sample-laden pop-rock songs.&quot; &quot;Newsweek&quot; remarked that the album &quot;has an impressive swirl of acoustic and electric guitars, keyboards and swanky pop hooks that actually push alternative rock in a new direction.&quot; About.com&#x27;s Tim Grierson stated that the album &quot;was steeped in alt-rock, but hits like &#x27;Only Happy It Rains&#x27; had a dance element to them that distinguished the band from many of their angst-rock peers.&quot; Grierson further categorized the album as &quot;dance-rock&quot; and &quot;techno-rock&quot;.

Gil Kaufman of &quot;Addicted to Noise&quot; described the album as a &quot;surprisingly non-guitar rock mix of ambient noise, shifting trip-hop beats, grinding jungle rhythms and an ocean-size chunk of buzzing noise that, somehow, gels and rises above the din thanks to catchy hooks and killer song construction.&quot; &quot;Metro Weekly&quot; characterized the album as &quot;a heavy mix of electronic pop and guitar rock with samples, electronica and trip-hop beats thrown into the mix.&quot; &quot;Billboard&quot; noted that &quot;acting on the premise that more is more, foursome Garbage thrashes out power pop with enough skill and passion to rate among the cream of the alternative crop. First single &#x27;Queer&#x27; is a modern rock success, and other cuts—especially &#x27;Only Happy When It Rains&#x27;, &#x27;Stupid Girl&#x27;, and &#x27;Supervixen&#x27;—are capable of keeping interests high. Proof that success can come from the oddest combinations.&quot;

==Promotion==
Vig stated that the band had no initial plans to tour as &quot;not going on the road would really free us up to record tons of stuff&quot;. As the band members realized &quot;that if we were going to have a successful record we&#x27;d have to go out on tour and promote it&quot;, and enjoyed playing live to record the &quot;Vow&quot; video, they decided to perform to audiences as well. To perform the complex and layered tracks live, the band hired Los Angeles bass player Daniel Shulman for the tour, and figured out ways to trigger samples on stage, such as having Marker play a keyboard along with his guitar.

On February 24, 1996, Garbage set off on a 17-date headline tour of North America. Garbage then supported Smashing Pumpkins on their North American arena tour from June 25, although the tour was cut short after the death of Smashing Pumpkins keyboardist Jonathan Melvoin on July 12. Garbage returned to Europe on August 3 promoting &quot;Garbage&quot; with a month of shows around the festival circuit. Garbage then headed south to Asia and Australia to promote the album, beginning with shows in Singapore on September 28 and ending in Osaka, Japan, on October 18. Garbage returned to the US to give &quot;Garbage&quot; a final push by rejoining the Smashing Pumpkins&#x27; rescheduled tour, beginning on October 23.

==Critical reception==

&quot;Garbage&quot; was acclaimed by contemporary critics. In &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;, Steven Mirkin said the band&#x27;s songwriting was just as exceptional as Vig&#x27;s guitar and drum sounds, highlighting the &quot;menacing sexuality, sonic playfulness, inventive guitar treatments, and cool vocals by Shirley Manson&quot;. Gil Kaufman from &quot;Addicted to Noise&quot; found the record&#x27;s sound &quot;akin to a Jackson Pollock painting, thick layers upon layers of sound that have been stripped down, torn apart, pasted together and then stripped again, until the result is a dizzying soundscape that reveals fresh nuances upon repeated listening&quot;. He added that the music&#x27;s mix of ambience, rhythms, and noise &quot;gels and rises above the din thanks to catchy hooks and killer song construction.&quot; Sharon O&#x27;Connell of &quot;Melody Maker&quot; hailed it as the closest to &quot;perfection as a pop/rock record&quot; as can be, while Emma Morgan of &quot;NME&quot; called it &quot;a reminder of how sweet angst can be in the hands of talented players&quot;. &quot;Garbage&quot; was voted the 19th best album of 1995 in the Pazz &amp; Jop, an annual poll of American critics published by &quot;The Village Voice&quot;. The newspaper&#x27;s Robert Christgau gave the album a three-star honorable mention. He named &quot;Queer&quot; and &quot;Supervixen&quot; as its highlights while writing &quot;if Whale is Tricky without a dark side, Garbage is Whale without Tricky and depressed about it&quot;. Keith Harris wrote in &quot;The Rolling Stone Album Guide&quot; that the record&#x27;s electronic guitar hooks and Manson&#x27;s &quot;pop-star-as-one-night-stand&quot; persona were seductive but had a &quot;tawdry disposability&quot;. On the other hand, writing in &quot;The Michigan Daily&quot;, Heather Phares was very mixed. Although she was favourable of the singles &quot;Vow&quot; and &quot;Queer&quot;, the latter of which had &quot;a sinister sex appeal that redeems it somewhat from the cheesiness of the rest of the album.&quot; She felt that the band mostly sound &quot;angsty and jaded for no good reason,&quot; and concluded that while it&#x27;s not &quot;total junk, it&#x27;s no prize either.&quot;

In 1997, &quot;Garbage&quot; was named the 71st greatest album of all time by &quot;The Guardian&quot;, which polled a number of renowned critics, artists, and radio DJs worldwide. It was later included in the musical reference book &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;. According to &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; critic Mikael Wood, the record&#x27;s techno-minded sound and Manson&#x27;s alluring persona complemented and countered the contemporary post-grunge music Vig had helped pioneer after producing Nirvana&#x27;s 1991 album &quot;Nevermind&quot;. &quot;Sound on Sound&quot; journalist Sam Inglis argued that the musical techniques used on &quot;Garbage&quot; were radical at the time and influenced subsequent popular music, &quot;uniting distorted guitars and cool female vocals with production that owed as much to Public Enemy as Led Zeppelin&quot;. In Jancee Dunn&#x27;s opinion, the album always sounded &quot;very forward-thinking, intelligent&quot; and current, even when heard more than a decade later.

==Commercial performance==
&quot;Garbage&quot; debuted at number 29 on the Top Heatseekers chart dated September 2, 1995, before peaking at number two on March 9, 1996. In the issue dated September 30, 1995, the album entered the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 at number 193, and reached its peak position of number 20 on August 10, 1996. The album was certified double platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) on February 24, 1999, and by August 2008, it had sold 2.4 million copies in the United States. In Canada, the album reached number 15 on &quot;The Record&quot;″s chart and number 25 on &quot;RPM&quot;″s chart, was certified double platinum by Canadian Recording Industry Association (CRIA), denoting shipments in excess of 200,000 units.

&quot;Garbage&quot; debuted at number 12 on the UK Albums Chart in October 1995 with 9,409 copies sold in its first week, eventually peaking at number six in April 1996. The album was certified double platinum by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI) on October 16, 1998, and had sold 701,757 copies in the United Kingdom as of May 2012. The album saw modest success across continental Europe, reaching number 16 in France, number 19 in Sweden, number 23 in Finland, number 30 in Norway and number 55 in Germany. In Oceania, it charted at number four in Australia and number one in New Zealand, earning double platinum certifications in both countries. As of August 2015, &quot;Garbage&quot; had sold over four million copies worldwide.

<text>Don Pío de Jesús Pico IV (May 5, 1801 – September 11, 1894) was a Californio politician, ranchero, and entrepreneur, famous for serving as the last governor of Alta California under Mexican rule from 1845 to 1846. He briefly held the governorship during a disputed period in 1832. A member of the prominent Pico family of California, he was one of the wealthiest men in California at the time and a hugely influential figure in Californian society, continuing as a citizen of the nascent U.S. state of California.

His legacy can be seen in the numerous places named after him, such as the city of Pico Rivera, Pico Boulevard in Los Angeles, Pio Pico State Historic Park, and numerous schools that bear his name.

==Early years==
===Ancestry===

Pío Pico was of African, Native American, Spanish, and Italian ancestry. His earliest known ancestor is the Count Mazzi, who lived during the early 1600s in the town of Pico in Central Italy. Pico&#x27;s great grandfather, the Spanish-born Pío de Jesús Pico III, likely came to Mexico during the first or second decade of the 18th century.

Pico&#x27;s paternal grandmother, María Jacinta Vastida, was listed in the 1790 census as &quot;mulata&quot;, meaning mixed-race with African ancestry. His paternal grandfather, Santiago de la Cruz Pico, was described as a &quot;mestizo&quot; (Native American-Spanish) in the same census. Santiago was one of the soldiers who accompanied Juan Bautista de Anza on the expedition that left Tubac, Arizona for California in 1775 to explore the region and colonize it. Santiago and María Jacinta were from the provinces of what are now Sinaloa and Sonora.

===Birth and childhood===

Pío de Jesús Pico IV was born at Mission San Gabriel Arcángel on May 5, 1801, to José María Pico and his wife María Eustaquia Gutiérrez, with the aid of midwife Eulalia Pérez de Guillén Mariné. He was the fourth of his parents&#x27; ten children, and their second son. Among his siblings was his younger brother General Andrés Pico, born in 1810.

In 1805, the family moved to San Diego. José María Pico worked as a guard for mission communities, and would move to different missions as his work required. Pío Pico spent much of his childhood outside the tiny settlement of Mission San Diego. There, he received a modest education. He often read from the Bible at Mass, and felt the immense presence of the church, as it dominated the economy, although he was not profoundly religious. At the Presidio of San Diego, José Antonio Carrillo, who later married Pico&#x27;s sister Estéfana, taught Pico how to read. This would be important to his career, as California law required literacy among elected officials. Carrillo would have a great influence on Pico&#x27;s youth and political rise.

He took an interest in his father&#x27;s work, and in 1815, he was temporarily placed in charge of the mission guards by local officials while his father was away. His father and other guards defended the missions from rebellions by Native Californians, who resented being forced to convert to Christianity as part of attempts to &quot;civilize&quot; them.

The Spanish government gave plots of land for housing and agriculture to some of the settlers in the area, and used them as incentives to recruit soldiers. José María Pico was never given any plots. José María eventually began to support the Mexican War of Independence from Spain. In 1811, he and sixty other soldiers were arrested by Spanish authorities on charges of conspiracy and imprisoned. He was eventually released, and the family moved back to San Gabriel. However, José María died in September 1819 in the same mission in which his son had been born. After this, Pío Pico was left in charge of his large family, and would have to continue without owning any land, which would remain a necessary component for entering California politics.

===Mexican independence===
Following his father&#x27;s death, Pico moved back to San Diego around the year 1820. He became a merchant, selling liquor, groceries, and dry goods. He would open a general store where he also sold furniture and mules. His occupation also allowed him to travel the state and meet notable Californios. Pico&#x27;s sisters married into prominent California families, which would be important to Pico&#x27;s political rise. He kept close connections with these families. These marriages also gave the Pico family their first sense of financial security. Concepción Pico married Domingo Carrillo in 1810, María Casimira Pico married José Joaquín Ortega in 1821, and Estéfana married José Antonio Carrillo in 1823. In 1824, Pío and Andrés Pico built their mother a home by Presidio Hill in San Diego.

After Mexico&#x27;s successful independence in 1821, the First Mexican Empire was created. However, Mexico&#x27;s emperor, Agustín de Iturbide, clashed with liberal revolutionary generals such as Guadalupe Victoria, Vicente Guerrero, and Antonio López de Santa Anna, who resisted Iturbide&#x27;s conservative policies. In 1823, Iturbide was forced to abdicate amid revolts, and soon after, the First Mexican Republic was created. Two rival factions developed: Liberals and Centralists. Centralists believed that Mexico&#x27;s states should be controlled by an elitist government, as well as the continued heavy influence of the Catholic Church. Liberals wanted Mexico to become a federal republic, where the federal government shared power with the states, and supported secular education. California leaned more towards liberalism, as their political culture had developed largely separately from the federal government seated in Mexico City.

Pico was eventually appointed as the secretary to a captain named Pablo de la Portillà. In 1827, Portillà charged merchant Luis Brigas with misappropriation of funds, and brought the matter to a military tribunal. Brigas defended himself by stating that, &quot;the civilians were the sacred core of the nation and that the military were nothing more than servants&quot;. The response affected Pico so much that he broke the line of command and sided with Brigas, which resulted in Pico temporarily being placed in jail. The incident was the beginning of Pico&#x27;s support for liberalism and the first major political event of his life. Pico also became a supporter of California&#x27;s liberal governor, José María de Echeandía, who became California&#x27;s governor in 1825. Echeandía was a supporter of secularization, which would involve releasing natives from Church control and redistributing excess land to them.

==Early political career==
===Diputado===
With the help of his family connections, Pico was able to enter politics. By 1826, he had been elected to San Diego&#x27;s town council and in 1828 he was elected to California&#x27;s legislative body, known as a diputación. In 1829, Echeandía gave Pico Rancho Jamul, which was the first major piece of land he owned. After receiving the ranch, Pico began stocking it with cattle and hiring workers to cultivate a cattle empire and become part of the landowning elite. By 1831, California&#x27;s diputación consisted of Pico, Ortega, Juan Bautista Alvarado, Mariano Guadalupe Vallejo, Antonio María Osio, Santiago Argüello, Juan Bandini, and Tomás Yorba, all of whom were interrelated, which allowed them to take complete control of territorial politics.

After the presidency of Guadalupe Victoria, the liberal Vicente Guerrero became president, but after he was given emergency powers to repel a Spanish invasion, conservatives accused him of despotism. Led by Vice President Anastasio Bustamante, the conservatives launched a rebellion in late 1829. Upon becoming president, Bustamante designated the conservative centralist Lucas Alamán to head his cabinet, who sought to remove liberal opposition from federal and state governments. Alamán removed Echeandía as governor, and sent Manuel Victoria to replace him in 1830. Prior to Victoria&#x27;s arrival, Echeandía issued decrees authorizing secularization, which he knew Victoria would oppose. Pico and other liberals in California supported Echeandía&#x27;s decrees.

By 1831, Pico was the &quot;primer vocal&quot; of the diputación, being its most senior member. Victoria began ignoring the diputación&#x27;s demands, such as one instance when Pico demanded Victoria meet with him, which Victoria considered a person attack, and stated that he would decide when the diputación would meet. In a government circular on September 31 that year, Victoria stated his intention to end Echeandía&#x27;s secularization policies, and accused the diputados (diputación members) of being illegally elected. He then suspended it entirely. He then began replacing the civilian government with a military one, and banished prominent critics who spoke out against these policies, such as José Antonio Carrillo and Abel Stearns. This alienated several key Californio families. In late September, Pico wrote a contestación (a response) to Victoria&#x27;s circular, stating that the diputación had the right to rebel against the governor, and argued against the expulsions and the nullification of local elections and diputados. He portrayed himself as a patriot defending Mexican law, and in bandos (pronouncements that posted on public buildings), he instilled the image of himself as a fighter for the liberty of common citizens. His prominent position gave his manifesto public weight.

Pico received word from Carrillo that Victoria planned to kill him and Bandini. Victoria also dismissed Bandini from his political position around that time. Pico responded by building an opposition including many of the most influential Southern Californians, such as Carrillo, Bandini, and Stearns. They met at Pico&#x27;s Rancho Jamul to gather information on Victoria&#x27;s forces and plan an armed revolt. At the same time, Victoria informed the federal government of his suspension of the diputación and his plans for military rule. With the diputación no longer recognized federally, the group chose to send Pico to Los Angeles to recruit influential men in the city to their cause. He found many of them imprisoned, but was still able to speak with them, and although he didn&#x27;t get all the support he hoped for, he did find a significant amount.

===1831 revolt===

After less than two months of planning, on November 29, 1831, Pico, Carrillo, and Bandini issued the Plan de San Diego, which placed them in open rebellion against Victoria. It accused Victoria of violating the law by issuing banishments without trial and of &quot;promoting illegal arrests&quot; in Los Angeles. It announced the suspension of Victoria as governor and military commandant and called for a legally elected interim official to run the government and military. On November 30, a group of 15 armed men, including Pico, Carrillo, Bandini, and Stearns marched into San Diego and surprised its garrison. Pico placed his friend Argüello under arrest, as well as Ygnacio del Valle. Pico took them to the home of Portillà, who had been arrested by Bandini, and the rebels attempted to convince the captured officers to join their rebellion. They refused, but promised to take no action against Pico&#x27;s group for the remainder of the rebellion. The group released the officers, who allowed the rebels to take artillery pieces from the barracks, and soldiers from the garrison began joining them. They then went to Los Angeles, where they stormed the prison, released all prisoners, and then arrested the alcalde Vicente Sánchez.
The rebellion was gaining public support, and its success convinced Portillà and Argüello to join on the condition that Echeandía lead it. Although he had little involvement prior, Echeandía agreed. This gave further legitimacy to the rebels, and more officers and soldiers joined them. In early December, Echeandía led his force of about 50 men into Los Angeles. The two groups met in Cahuenga Pass, with Victoria&#x27;s force of about 30 against Pico and Echeandía&#x27;s 150. The following battle was short. Pico&#x27;s side gained the upper hand, with Victoria being critically wounded while retreating. The following day he formally surrendered. On December 9, he met with Echeandía to make plans abdicate and leave to another part of Mexico. The rebels celebrated their victory without fear of retaliation from the federal government, as they lacked the resources to send a force to the state and keep resupplying them.

==First governorship==
===Echeandía dispute===
Vallejo signed the Plan de San Diego soon after, which united the North and South of California under it. On January 10, 1832, the restored diputación met in Los Angeles. This time, it consisted of Pico, Vallejo, Alvarado, Ortega, Osio, Argüello, and Yorba. With Victoria gone, they were free to continue secularization and governance of the state. They set aside any political differences they had to select a new head of government. An 1822 law stated that the primer vocal would assume the governorship, which was still Pico. The church resisted giving the group religious objects needed for the swearing-in, so Alvarado broke in to get them. Afterwards, Vallejo inaugurated Pico as the governor on January 27. Pico&#x27;s governance had the support of San Diego.

On February 1, Echeandía wrote to Pico about his concerns that Pico&#x27;s election was illegitimate. Pico didn&#x27;t reply, and then in a letter to Los Angeles alcalde Manuel Dominguez, Echeandía admitted the legality of Pico&#x27;s selection as governor. However, he also clarified his opposition to Pico&#x27;s governance based on the illegality of the rebellion. Dominguez then refused to accept Pico as governor. Echeandía believed that since Victoria passed the office to him before he left, that he, not Pico, gave him the governorship. On February 16, Echeandía issued an ultimatum to Pico: If he didn&#x27;t step down, Echeandía would hold him and the diputación responsible for the rebellion to the nation, which ignored Echeandía&#x27;s own role in it. The group placated Echeandía&#x27;s desire, and Pico made no further claims to the office and issued to acts after this point. Echeandía was able to assume the governorship on February 18.

Some historians do not view Pico&#x27;s first claim to the governorship as legitimate. Historian Hubert Howe Bancroft states that Pico&#x27;s claim was illegitimate, historian Paul Gray describes the revolt as if Pico never held the office, while Pico&#x27;s biographer Carlos Manuel Salomon describes Pico as the governor during this period. Bancroft notes that it is customary for historians to list Pico&#x27;s first governorship between those of Victoria and Figueroa.

===Aftermath===
Shortly after Pico&#x27;s resignation, Agustín V. Zamorano, Victoria&#x27;s secretary, began a revolt in Northern Alta California. He and his allies rejected the authority of Echeandía and the diputación. By March 22, the diputación and Echeandía had reached an accord with Echeandía, and Pico issued a circular to the ayuntamientos requesting they maintain peace and avoid joining Zamorano&#x27;s revolt. Pico did not challenge Echeandía or Zamorano for the governorship and sought to end public disruption. By early May, a truce placed Zamorano and Echeandía in military control of the north and south, respectively. Meanwhile, the federal government sent brigadier general José Figueroa to assume the governorship, but he would not arrive until the following year, and until then the massive territory would not have a single leader. Figueroa arrived on January 14, 1833, reuniting the state.

==Interim career==
===Secularization and marriage===
As governor, Figueroa opposed full secularization, arguing that it would hurt California&#x27;s economy and that natives required more &quot;civilizing&quot;. He issued a law giving partial emancipation to those who had practiced Christianity for twelve years, but placed recalcitrant natives back under mission authority. By 1833, the Liberals, led by Antonio López de Santa Anna and Valentín Gómez Farías, removed the conservative government. Gómez Farías implemented many liberal reforms, including secularization in the Californias. This conflicted with Figueroa&#x27;s gradual plan, but in 1834 he complied. He created the &quot;Reglamento provisional para la secularización de las Misiones&quot; (), which secularized ten missions and created plans to secularize the rest. It created a &quot;comisionado&quot; () to emancipate and redistribute property to the natives, and to take mission inventory and pay debts with the governor&#x27;s approval. After redistribution, this would leave excess land that Figueroa believed could improve the economy. However, there was a lack of regulations on the comisionado and on native labor requirements.

Pico married María Ignacia Alvarado on February 24, 1834 at La Iglesia de Nuestra Señora la Reina de los Ángeles. She was the daughter of sergeant Francisco Javier Alvarado. His son, Francisco Javier II, was alcalde of Los Angeles and had married Pico&#x27;s sister María Tomasa Pico in 1829. The reception was held across the street at the home of his brother-in-law José Antonio Carrillo. The reception lasted eight days. Pico&#x27;s best man was then-governor Figueroa. By this point, the two had formed a strong friendship. That year, Pico ran to become alcalde of San Diego, but on December 21, he lost to Juan María Osuna.

In 1837, Pico was the godfather at the baptism of John &quot;Juan&quot; Forster, an English-born immigrant who converted to Catholicism and became a Mexican citizen to own land. The two men would later refer to this event when asking each other for political favors. Forster would soon after marry Pico&#x27;s sister Isidora Ygnacia Pico, making Forster his son-in-law as well.

===Mission San Luis Rey and Alvarado governorship===
In 1835, Pico became the comisionado of Mission San Luis Rey de Francia, which may have been influenced by his friendship with Figueroa. As comisionado, Pico faced resistance from natives at San Luis Rey, as they had been skeptical of emancipation and continued to face mistreatment following secularization. Laws had given natives the ability to establish pueblos and elect their own alcaldes, who would interact with the Mexican government on behalf of their people. Two pueblos and alcaldes were established by the Luiseños (natives at San Luis Rey). To overcome this, Pico worked with the local &quot;encargado de justicia&quot; (). The encargado could arrest people at the mission for crimes, but the act creating this position was vague on what constituted a crime, and the encargado could arrest a native for simply refusing to work. Punishments involved imprisonment in chains for up to eight days and possibly an equal amount of time doing forced labor. According to Pico, he once had a Luiseño alcalde chained and lashed fifty times for attacking a Mexican mayordomo. In 1836, Pico also became the encargado de justicia, which gave him further control over the Luiseños.

The Luiseños soon came to despise Pico. According to the Luiseño Julio César, Pico was their most abusive administrator. Pico mandated that all Luiseños remove their hats when he walked by, and allowed his cattle to graze on native pueblos. He also sought to profit off of the mission, and by 1835, his inventory valued the mission at $194,436, which was far ahead of the others. A Luiseño coalition elected the educated Pablo Apis to represent them, and in June they petitioned the alcalde of San Diego to remove Pico. Pico learned of this and requested military assistance from the San Diego Presidio. Comandante Nicolás Gutiérrez gave Apis permission to travel to San Diego, but Pico had Apis arrested. Apis was placed in jail, but a thousand Luiseños protested outside his quarters, demanding his release. Fearing for his life, Pico unconditionally released Apis. However, Pico had requested the aid of troops from San Juan Capistrano, and after they arrived, he again arrested Apis. He forced Apis to join the military company in Monterey to eliminate him as a threat, and had the military arrest more natives. A month later, Luiseño protests continued, with them unsuccessfully petitioning governor Mariano Chico to remove Pico.

Pico made some concessions to the Luiseños. When Luiseños at the pueblo of Las Flores complained about their officials, Pico personally traveled there and replaced them. In November 1836, Pico prevented Portillà from acquiring native property rights in Agua Caliente, although he took some of them for himself.
By 1836, a conservative government had regained control of the federal government, and it enacted the Siete Leyes (), which diminished the power of the states and created the Centralist Republic of Mexico. That year, Northern California politician Juan Bautista Alvarado led a revolt against Governor Gutiérrez and declared California independent from Mexico. He elevated the diputación to a junta. However, Pico, Carlos Antonio Carrillo, and other Southern California politicians feared that Alvarado would favor the north. Pico and his allies challenged Alvarado&#x27;s government, supporting Carrillo instead. In 1837 the conflict erupted into a revolt, which Pico joined. By March 1838, Alvarado&#x27;s army had defeated the southern rebels. Carrillo surrendered, and Pico and several others were briefly imprisoned. Eventually, the federal government recognized Alvarado as governor, which ended the conflict on all sides.

While Pico was imprisoned, natives had attacked burned down Rancho Jamul. Pico&#x27;s mother and sisters escaped due to a warning from a native servant, but multiple staff members and their relatives were killed or disappeared. The natives had also begun leaving Mission San Luis Rey in large numbers. After Pico&#x27;s release, he sought to regain control of and rebuild his empire with the aid of his family. His brother José Antonio was placed in charge of the military in San Luis Rey, in 1839, which allowed him to defend his brother against native uprisings. Meanwhile, Andrés Pico left the military to take charge of Rancho Jamul.

Back at San Luis Rey, the Luiseños continued refusing to work, and he needed more funding. In June 1839, he moved his mother and sister Jacinta into the mission, and sent a letter to his brother José Antonio, asking him to use his influence with Alvarado and Vallejo to sell their family home in San Diego. He also requested ownership of the lands of Temecula, which Alvarado gave him temporary custody of. There, he gave provisions to the natives while announcing his custody of the land, but they threatened him with an armed revolt. He was soon replaced with his son-in-law José Antonio Estudillo.

Pico also threatened to resign from the mission unless mission inspector general William Hartnell helped him round up fugitive Luiseños. Hartnell interviewed them, and learned of their complaints against Pico, including that his wasteful spending left them without necessities such as clothing. Hartnell then recommended that Alvarado discharge Pico, which he did. Pico fought against his dismissal, but to no avail, then paid off his debt to the mission of $170.00, and left in 1840.

===Move to Los Angeles===
Pico then purchased a home in Los Angeles Plaza, which was a city where many other rancheros and southern elites lived. In late 1840, Pico made another attempt to gain Temecula, but instead Alvarado gave him Rancho Santa Margarita, on the condition that he relinquish his claims to Temecula. Pico&#x27;s Ranchos Jamul and Santa Margarita were entering full production, although they were managed by staff and Pico had little need to reside at either.

Pico did not directly involve himself in politics for the next few years, but was still influential with the state assembly. He, along with fellow assembly members Alvarado and José Castro, was placed on a list of candidates the federal government could choose to be governor, but Alvarado was ultimately chosen. Pico did not fight this, but argued that Los Angeles, not Alvarado&#x27;s home of Monterey, should be the state&#x27;s capital.

In 1840, Pico served as the tithe collector of Los Angeles, where he received five percent per commission. This position allowed him to meet residents of the city. Due to his wealth and the city&#x27;s reliance on ranching professions, Pico became one of the most respected people in Los Angeles.

In 1842, Pico, still encargado de justicia, declared the land around Las Flores too arid for further settlement, which opened it for his ranching operations. He purchased Las Flores in 1844, and made his brother Andrés a co-recipient of the land. The two oversaw on the land the construction of a corral and an adobe house that they used to entertain guests and conduct business. Thanks to lands from Mission San Luis Rey, Pico&#x27;s herds had grown, and his two ranches had made him wealthy.

===Micheltorena governorship===
n 1842, President López de Santa Anna replaced Alvarado as governor with the Brigadier General Manuel Micheltorena, due to the president&#x27;s fear of another war with Americans after the Texas Revolution of the 1830s. Micheltorena brought with him to the state an army of three hundred criminal soldiers, who were viewed as a public nuisance by local Californios. Micheltorena was generous with land grants to foreign immigrants, which many locals, including Pico, viewed suspiciously. Pico suspected that Micheltorena may have been working with John Sutter to make California independent from Mexico.

==Second governorship==
===Return to power===
In 1844, he was chosen as a leader of the California Assembly. In 1845, he was again appointed governor, succeeding the unpopular Manuel Micheltorena.
This occurred because, in late 1844, the Mexican province of California staged a revolt against the mother country. Micheltorena had been sent to California from Mexico, along with an army that had been recruited out of Mexico&#x27;s worst jails. He had no money to feed his army, which then spread out to people&#x27;s homes and farms &quot;like a plague of locusts, stripping the countryside bare.&quot; This enraged the Californians and led to widespread hatred of Micheltorena. Women were not considered safe from the depredations of Micheltorena&#x27;s army.

Juan Bautista Alvarado, the governor who had been forcibly replaced by Micheltorena, organized a rebellion against Micheltorena. Upon learning of the impending revolt, Micheltorena appointed John Sutter to lead troops in opposition. Sutter came to John Marsh, who had one of the largest ranchos in California, hoping he would join. Marsh wanted no part of it, but Sutter forced him to join his army against his will.

The two forces met in Cahuenga Pass, near Los Angeles, and fought the Battle of Providencia (also known as the Second Battle of Cahuenga Pass), which consisted primarily of an artillery duel. On the long march to the battle Marsh had taken every opportunity to dissuade the other soldiers from Micheltorena’s cause. Ignoring Sutter, Marsh seized an opportunity in the battle to signal the other side for a parley. Many of the soldiers on each side were immigrants from the United States. Marsh convinced them that they had no reason to be fighting each other. At Marsh&#x27;s urging, these soldiers on both sides united, abandoned Micheltorena&#x27;s cause, and even captured Sutter. Micheltorena was defeated, and California-born Pio Pico was returned to the governorship.

===Mexican–American War===

Pico made Los Angeles the province&#x27;s capital, although he left the treasury in the former capital, Monterey. In the year leading up to the Mexican–American War, Pico advocated that California achieve independence from Mexico and become a British protectorate.

When U.S. troops occupied Los Angeles and San Diego in 1846 during the Mexican–American War, Pico fled to Baja California, Mexico, to argue before the Mexican Congress for sending troops to defend Alta California. He was joined by his Secretary of State José Matías Moreno who traveled on Pico&#x27;s behalf to request arms, munitions, men, and money. Pico did not return to Los Angeles until after the signing of the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, and he reluctantly accepted the transfer of sovereignty.

===Return to California===
Automatically granted United States citizenship, he was elected to the Los Angeles Common Council in 1853, but he did not assume office.

Pico helped establish the California Republican Party, allying with the larger Republican Party due to his anti-slavery stances.

==Business life==

John Bidwell, an early California settler, mentioned Pico among the people he knew:
Los Angeles I first saw in March 1845. It then had probably 250 people, of whom I recall Don Abel Stearns, John Temple, Captain Alexander Bell, William Wolfskill, Lemuel Carpenter, David W. Alexander; also of Mexicans, Pio Pico (governor), Don Juan Bandini, and others.

By the 1850s Pico was one of the richest men in Alta California. In 1850 he purchased the Rancho Paso de Bartolo, which included half of present-day Whittier. Two years later, he built a home on the ranch and lived there until 1892. It is preserved today as Pio Pico State Historic Park. Pico also owned the former Mission San Fernando Rey de España, Rancho Santa Margarita y Las Flores (now part of Camp Pendleton), and several other ranchos for a total of over .

In 1868, he constructed the three-story, 33-room hotel, Pico House (Casa de Pico) on the old plaza of Los Angeles, opposite today&#x27;s Olvera Street. At the time of its opening in 1869, it was the most lavish hotel in Southern California. Even before 1900, however, both the hotel and the surrounding neighborhood had begun to decline, as the business center moved farther south. After decades as a shabby flophouse, the hotel was deeded to the State of California in 1953. It is now a part of El Pueblo de Los Angeles State Historic Monument. It is used on occasion for exhibits and special events.

== Later life ==

Following the American annexation of California, Pico dedicated himself to his businesses.

He survived the American conquest of California, becoming one of the wealthiest California cattlemen, controlling more than a quarter million acres. He defended his position and fortune in over 100 legal cases, including 20 that were argued before the California Supreme Court.
However, gambling, losses to loan sharks, bad business practices, being a victim of fraud, and the flood of 1883 ruined him financially. For example, in 1893, Pico made an arrangement with Bernard Cohn in which Cohn paid Pico more than $60,000 in exchange for a deed to Pico&#x27;s property in Los Angeles and elsewhere in the county. Pico sued Cohn, but lost on appeal. The decision, &quot;Pico v. Cohn&quot; (1891) 91 Cal. 129, 133-134, is classically cited by California appellate courts in cases having to do with the setting aside of a judgment in case of fraud.

Pico was forced to liquidate his real estate holdings and his final years were spent in near poverty. In 1893, a committee of local boosters and history enthusiasts asked him to appear at the Chicago World&#x27;s Columbian Exposition as &quot;the last of the California &quot;dons&quot;. Pico refused, considering it an affront to his dignity. He died in 1894 at the home of his daughter, Joaquina Pico Moreno, in Los Angeles. He was buried in the old Calvary Cemetery on North Broadway in Downtown Los Angeles, but his remains, as well as those of his wife, were relocated in 1921 to a modest tomb in El Campo Santo Cemetery, now in the Homestead Museum in the City of Industry.

== Personal life==

Pico&#x27;s wife María Ignacia Alvarado died on February 21, 1854, in Santa Barbara. Pico never acknowledged any children with her or anyone else, but multiple people claimed to have been his direct descendants. The mixed martial artist Aaron Pico is reportedly Pío Pico&#x27;s great-great-great-great grandson.

Pico, a Spanish speaker, never learned English, which would become an important factor in his lawsuit against Juan Forster.

Pico held three different nationalities during his lifetime. He was born a Spaniard in New Spain, became a Mexican citizen as a young man, and finally a United States citizen. He was known for his extravagant lifestyle, with fine clothes, expensive furnishings, and heavy gambling.

In 2010, scientists published an article about Pio Pico asserting that he showed signs of acromegaly, a disease not characterized until later in the nineteenth century.

==Legacy==

Numerous landmarks, areas, and streets bear Pico&#x27;s name, especially in Southern California and particularly Los Angeles County. Pico Boulevard, a major east–west thoroughfare in Los Angeles, is named for him. The L.A. neighborhoods of Pico Union, Pico-Roberston, Pico Park, Pico/Rimpau, and Pico/Aliso Gardens bare his name. The city of Pico Rivera is also named after him. Pico station and Pico/Aliso station are stops on the Los Angeles Metro Rail. The 300-megawatt Pio Pico Energy Center has natural gas-fired combustion turbine generators in Otay Mesa, San Diego, starting in 2016.

Pío Pico State Historic Park is the historic site of Governor Pico&#x27;s Rancho Paso de Bartolo, made up of his adobe mansion and ranching estate. The site, located in Whittier, California, was opened to the public in 1927 and is operated by California State Parks.

Pico House, located on the Los Angeles Plaza, is a historic site in Downtown Los Angeles, now part of the El Pueblo de Los Ángeles Historical Monument.

<text>The United Transportation Union (UTU) was a broad-based, transportation labor union that represented about 70,000 active and retired railroad, bus, mass transit, and airline workers in the United States. The UTU was headquartered in Cleveland, Ohio. On August 11, 2014, it merged with the Sheet Metal Workers&#x27; International Association (SMWIA) to form the International Association of Sheet Metal, Air, Rail and Transportation Workers, known by the acronym SMART.

==Membership==

The UTU was the largest railroad operating union in North America, with more than 500 locals. The UTU represented employees on every Class I railroad in the United States, as well as employees on many American regional and shortline railroads. It also represented bus and mass transit employees on approximately 45 bus and transit systems and had grown to include airline pilots, flight attendants, dispatchers and other airport personnel. The UTU was very interested in the airline sector and hoped to expand its representation with pilots and flight attendants. The UTU believed it is a viable alternative to other aviation labor unions because the UTU operated under the belief that it has been proficient in interpreting and enforcing provisions of the Railroad Labor Act (RLA), under which airlines also operate.

Membership was drawn primarily from the operating crafts in the railroad industry and includes conductors, brakemen, switchmen, ground service personnel, locomotive engineers, hostlers and workers in associated crafts. More than 1,800 railroad yardmasters also are represented by the UTU. The UTU&#x27;s 8,000 bus and transit members include drivers, mechanics and employees in related occupations.

==History==
In 1968 exploratory talks among the four brotherhoods interested in forming one transportation union proved fruitful and plans were formulated for merging of the four operation unions into a single organization to represent all four operating crafts. The four unions were the Brotherhood of Locomotive Firemen and Enginemen, the Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen, the Order of Railway Conductors and Brakemen, and the Switchmen&#x27;s Union of North America. The first three of these were considered fraternal orders, as well as labor unions.

In August 1968, the union presidents announced that after nine months of planning, a tentative agreement had been reached on all phases of unity. It was further announced that the name of the new organization would be the United Transportation Union and the target date for establishing the UTU was January 1, 1969. In Chicago on December 10, 1968, the tabulation of the voting revealed an overwhelming desire by the members of the four crafts to merge into a single union, and the United Transportation Union came into existence on January 1, 1969.

The new union had 230,000 members. The first president was Charles Luna, formerly president of the Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen. By 1978 the Union had 240,000 members in 1,000 branches.
In 1970, the International Association of Railway Employees joined the UTU.
In 1971 the UTU Insurance Association assumed the insurance and welfare plans of the brotherhoods who had formed the UTU.
The UTU held its first national convention in August 1971 in Miami Beach, Florida. Al Chesser, National Legislative Director of the UTU, was elected to succeed Luna, who was retiring.

In 1985, the Railroad Yardmasters of America joined.

<text>José María Teclo Morelos Pérez y Pavón () (30 September 1765 – 22 December 1815) was a Mexican Catholic priest, statesman and military leader who led the Mexican War of Independence movement, assuming its leadership after the execution of Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla in 1811.

Born in Valladolid, Michoacán, Morelos studied at Colegio de San Nicolás and was appointed priest of Carácuaro in 1799. He joined Miguel Hidalgo&#x27;s Cry of Dolores, soon becoming an insurgency leader. Aided by local peoples, along with revolutionary leaders Mariano Matamoros and Ignacio López Rayón, Morelos occupied territories in southern and central New Spain, leading the Siege of Cuautla and capturing Acapulco, New Spain&#x27;s main port in the Pacific Ocean. His campaigns galvanized regional insurgencies against Spanish rule, which made him the royalist army&#x27;s main rival.

In 1813, Morelos wrote &quot;Sentimientos de la Nación&quot;, a document influenced by the Constitution of Cádiz where he outlined his program for the Mexican nation. Under his leadership, the Congress of Anáhuac was installed in Chilpancingo, and on 6 November 1813 declared the independence of Mexico. On 22 October 1814, the Constitution of Apatzingán drafted by Congress declared that Mexico would be a Republic.

After a series of defeats, Morelos was captured by the royalist army in Temalaca, Puebla. He was tried by the Inquisition, defrocked as a cleric, and executed by civil authorities in San Cristóbal Ecatepec on 22 December 1815. Morelos is considered a national hero in Mexico, who despite not having a military background became a successful insurgency leader, credited with organizing and bolstering the War of Independence. The Mexican state of Morelos and city of Morelia are named after him.

== Early life ==

Morelos was born in Valladolid, since renamed Morelia. Although often portrayed as being of &quot;mixed&quot; or &quot;indigenous&quot; descent, Morelos was classified as a Spaniard (&quot;español&quot;) in his baptismal register, a system in which the Catholic Church kept separate registers for ethnic affiliation. Although ethnic affiliation was fluid in colonial Spanish America, his family was considered as Spaniard according to the social categories of the time. His paternal family had both Spaniards and Mestizos (Indigenous and African) whereas his maternal family was fully Spanish.

His father was José Manuel Morelos y Robles, a carpenter originally from Zindurio, a village west of Valladolid. His mother was Juana María Guadalupe Pérez Pavón, originally from San Juan Bautista de Apaseo, also near Valladolid. Valladolid was the seat of a bishop and of the government of the colonial Intendency of Valladolid. It was known as the &quot;Garden of the Viceroyalty of New Spain&quot; because of its prosperity.

Through his paternal line, Morelos was related to Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla. Both insurgents shared a common ancestor, Diego Ruiz de Cortés, who was a descendant of the conquistador Hernán Cortés. Hidalgo was the descendant of Ruiz de Cortés through his mother, Ana María Gallaga.
Morelos worked as a muleteer (&quot;arriero&quot;) in the area where he fought in the insurgency, on the ground experience of the terrain that would be valuable. He is also said to have worked on a ranch rented by his uncle for nearly ten years.

Morelos had ambitions for something more than working with his hands, and assiduously studied; his maternal grandfather was a school teacher. In 1789, he enrolled in the Colegio de San Nicolás Obispo in Valladolid, where Father Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla was rector. When he was ordained a priest, he, as with many others without connections, had no benefice to guarantee any income as a priest. However, as a secular cleric, he took no vow of poverty and could freely pursue business activities to make a living.

As a priest, he could not marry, but he did form a relationship with at least one woman, Brígida Almonte. He is known to have fathered three children: two sons and a daughter. His first born was Juan Nepomuceno Almonte, who played a significant role in Mexican military history. Lucas Alamán, a fierce nineteenth-century opponent of the insurgency and after independence a conservative politician and historian, asserted that Morelos &quot;fathered various children with anonymous women of the people.&quot; This charge of promiscuity might simply be a slur without foundation on the insurgent-priest. At Morelos&#x27;s trial, the Inquisition accused him of sending his son to the United States. He testified at his trial that &quot;while he had not been completely pristine for a priest, he had not acted in a scandalous manner&quot; and that he had sent his son away for education and for his safety, acknowledging his paternity.

==Insurrection against the Spanish monarchy==

The former rector of the Colegio de San Nicolás Obispo (where Morelos attended seminary), Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla was planning with others for the independence of New Spain from the Spanish empire. About 6:00 a.m. on 16 September 1810, Hidalgo, then the parish priest of Dolores, Guanajuato (since renamed Dolores Hidalgo in his honor), ordered the church bells to be rung, and gathered his congregation. Flanked by Ignacio Allende and Juan Aldama, Hidalgo addressed the people in front of his church, urging them to take up arms, with the Cry of Dolores (&quot;El Grito de Dolores&quot;, now celebrated every year on 15 September at 11:00 p.m.) that called for armed revolt after the Spanish colonial authorities had discovered the Conspiracy of Querétaro, a clandestine movement seeking Mexican independence. Like Allende and Aldama, Josefa Ortiz de Domínguez, popularly known as &quot;La Corregidora&quot;, was one of the famous initial supporters of the revolt. Miguel Hidalgo and his followers rose in open rebellion against the Spanish colonial authorities launching what became the Mexican War of Independence.

With the imperial government taken by surprise, operatives took important cities of the Bajío region without an organized response. The insurgency proclaimed Hidalgo captain general of Mexico in Celaya on 21 September. Hidalgo y Costilla advanced to Guanajuato; and on 28 September, the rebels captured the Alhóndiga de Granaditas in battle, killing at least 400 Spaniards who had taken shelter. Among the dead was the crown&#x27;s highest official in Guanajuato, Intendant Juan Antonio Riaño, an old friend of Hidalgo y Costilla.

The bishop of Michoacán, Manuel Abad y Queipo, excommunicated the insurgents. Hidalgo y Costilla and his army marched on to Valladolid, where the locals feared that the slaughter of Guanajuato would be repeated, prompting many people to abandon the region, particularly elites. Valladolid was taken peacefully on 17 October 1810.

In Tacámbaro, Hidalgo y Costilla was proclaimed general, and Allende captain general. Hidalgo ordered a rest for his troops in Indaparapeo, where a few minutes before their departure, Morelos, who had read about his excommunication and his triumphs, found him. Morelos had heard of the revolt in October 1810 and determined to join it. Hidalgo asked his former student to recruit troops in the south of the colony and capture the port of Acapulco, the west coast port for the Pacific trade to the Philippines, also a Spanish colony. Unlike Hidalgo, who was a poor tactician leading a huge and undisciplined following, Morelos quickly demonstrated military skills, gathering and training a small core of fighters. He sought allies in the region, and obtained cannons and other war materiel.

Morelos&#x27;s objectives for the rebellion called for the creation of a republican government that &quot;all Mexican people would participate, the abolition of slavery, and the elimination of divisions between races and ethnicities.&quot;

===Campaigns===

Morelos soon showed himself to be a talented strategist, and became one of the greatest revolutionary military commanders of the war. In his first nine months, he won 22 victories, defeating the armies of three Spanish royalist leaders and capturing almost all of what is now the state of Guerrero. In December, he captured Acapulco for the first time, except for the Fort of San Diego. Spanish reinforcements forced him to raise the siege in January. By quick marches, he was able to capture most of the Spanish possessions on the Pacific coast of what are now Michoacán and Guerrero. On 24 May 1811, he occupied Chilpancingo and on 26 May he took Tixtla.

In his second campaign, Morelos divided his army into three groups. The most important engagement of this campaign was at Cuautla. On Christmas Eve 1811 the townspeople welcomed Morelos to the town. The next year his forces were besieged by the Spanish army under general Félix María Calleja del Rey. On 2 May 1812, after 58 days, Morelos broke through the siege, and started his third campaign.

Major victories on this third campaign were at Citlalli on 8 June 1812, Tehuacán on 10 August 1812, Orizaba, Oaxaca and Acapulco. Morelos arrived at Orizaba with 10,000 soldiers on 28 October 1812. The city was defended by 600 Spanish soldiers. Negotiation led to a surrender without bloodshed. He entered Oaxaca in triumph on 25 November 1812. Acapulco fell on 12 April 1813, forcing the Spanish army to take refuge in the Fort of San Diego.

===Congress of Chilpancingo===

In 1813, Morelos called the National Constituent Congress of Chilpancingo, composed of representatives of the provinces under his control, to consider a political and social program which he outlined in a document entitled &quot;Sentimientos de la Nación&quot; (Sentiments of the Nation). The Congress called itself the Congress of Anáhuac, in reference to the Aztecs.

On 31 September 1813, the Congress, with Morelos present, endorsed Sentiments of the Nation. This document declared Mexican independence from Spain, established Catholicism as official religion and created the legislative, executive and judicial branches of government. It declared respect for property and confiscated the productions of the Spanish colonial government. It abolished slavery and racial categories in favor of the title &quot;American&quot; for all native-born individuals. Torture, colonial monopolies and the system of tributes were also abolished. Morelos was offered the title &quot;Generalissimo&quot; with the style of address &quot;Your Highness&quot;, but he refused these and asked to be called &quot;Siervo de la Nación&quot; (Servant of the Nation). On 6 November 1813, the Congress declared independence in the Solemn Act of the Declaration of Independence of Northern America.

After several military defeats, the Congress organized a meeting in Apatzingán, and on 22 October promulgated the &quot;Decreto Constitucional para la Libertad de la América Mexicana&quot; (Constitution of Apatzingán). This established a limited executive and a powerful legislature, the opposite of what Morelos had called for. He nevertheless conceded that it was the best he could hope for under the circumstances.

===Capture and execution===
Shortly thereafter, Morelos began his fourth military campaign, a series of defeats beginning at Valladolid in late 1813. While escorting the new insurgent Congress in November 1815, he was defeated in Temalaca by royalist forces. Morelos and his guard were surrounded; rather than have all taken prisoner, Morelos told his men to each save himself. This left Morelos to be captured alone. As a Catholic priest, the church had jurisdiction for his imprisonment and trial; he was jailed in the Inquisition building in Mexico City. Although Morelos was a huge prize for the royal government, the viceroy decided not to make a public spectacle of his journey of incarceration, but rather slipped him into the capital before dawn.

The royal government had experience with the trial and execution of Father Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla, which was done far from the capital and in rushed fashion; but Morelos&#x27;s trial was conducted in the capital with the highest officials presiding, with the outcome of a guilty verdict and execution by civil officials. Inquisition officials drew up 23 charges against Morelos, and following proper procedure, Morelos had a defense attorney, José Quiles. He was charged with treason, disloyalty to the crown, and transgressions in his personal life, namely, sending his natural sons to the United States for education.

He was tried and sentenced to death for treason. Morelos was executed by firing squad on 22 December 1815, in San Cristóbal Ecatepec, north of Mexico City in order that his execution not provoke a dangerous public reaction. He was later judged to be reconciled to the church, lifting his excommunication, as he was seen praying on his way to his execution. After his death, his lieutenant, Vicente Guerrero, continued the war for independence.

==Legacy==
Morelos is considered a national hero of Mexico; the state of Morelos and city of Morelia are named after him. Morelos has been portrayed on the 50-peso note since 1997, and on 1-peso coins during the 1940s, 1970s and 1980s. The Estadio Morelos in Morelia, Puerto Morelos in the state of Quintana Roo, the Morelos Station
on the Mexico City Metro, the city of Ecatepec de Morelos in Mexico State where he was executed, Insurgente José María Morelos y Pavón National Park in Michoacán, and the Morelos Satellite from the Communications company Satmex are also named after him. His remains were transferred to the Monument to Independence El Ángel in Mexico City, along with those of other heroes of the insurgency. The Presidential aircraft Boeing 787 TP-01 was named José María Morelos y Pavón.

<text>The Amalgamated Transit Union (ATU) is a labor organization in the United States and Canada that represents employees in the public transit industry. Established in 1892 as the Amalgamated Association of Street Railway Employees of America, the union was centered primarily in the Eastern United States; today, ATU has over 200,000 members throughout the United States and Canada.

==History==
The union was founded in 1892 as the Amalgamated Association of Street Railway Employees of America. The union has its origins in a meeting of the American Federation of Labor in 1891 at which president Samuel Gompers was asked to invite the local street railway associations to form an international union. Gompers sent a letter to the local street railway unions in April 1892, and based on the positive response arranged for a convention of street railway workers. The convention began on September 12, 1892, in Indianapolis, Indiana, attended by fifty delegates from twenty-two locals. Many of the smaller unions were affiliated with the AFL, while four larger locals were affiliated with the Knights of Labor and two were independent.

The first president was William J. Law from the AFL-affiliated local in Detroit. Detroit was chosen as the headquarters, using the same facilities as the Detroit local. Because the number of members affiliated with the Knights of Labor was greater than the numbers affiliated with the AFL, according to the claims of the delegates, the new international remained unaffiliated despite pleas by Gompers. The objectives included education, settlement of disputes with management, and securing good pay and working conditions. The international was given considerable authority over the locals.

The second convention was held in Cleveland in October 1893, with just fifteen divisions represented by about twenty delegates. At this meeting William D. Mahon was named president, and he still held this position in 1937. By then the union had been renamed the Amalgamated Association of Street, Electric Railway and Motor Coach Employees of America. The union struggled in the early years as the transit companies followed the practice of firing union activists. In the 1897 meeting in Dayton, Ohio, there were twenty delegates. The treasury of the union now had $4,008. An early achievement was to have laws passed in a dozen states by 1899 that mandated enclosed vestibules for the motormen. Wages were close to $2 a day where the union was established, and in Detroit and Worcester the nine-hour day had been achieved, although in most cities ten- or eleven-hour days were common.

At the start of the 20th century the Amalgamated Association launched a militant organizing program. Although the union was always willing to arbitrate in disputes, there were many strikes against the streetcar companies. Often these turned violent, as in St. Louis in 1900 or Denver in 1920. The public and small businesses sympathized with the strikers, and passengers and other unions often became involved in the street actions. When buses began to replace streetcars, the association began to be challenged by the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, Chauffeurs, Stablemen and Helpers. It was agreed that the Amalgamated Association would have jurisdiction over buses operated by street railway companies, while the Teamsters would have jurisdiction over independent bus lines and over road transportation of goods.

==Political and legislative activities==
In 2008, the ATU endorsed Hillary Clinton in her unsuccessful bid for the Democratic presidential nomination; after she conceded defeat, the ATU endorsed Barack Obama in his bid to become president.

<text>Balgowlah is a suburb of northern Sydney, in the state of New South Wales, Australia. Balgowlah (or Bulgowlah) said to be an Aboriginal name for &quot;North Harbour&quot;. The area now known as Balgowlah was known to the Aboriginals as Jilling.

Balgowlah is located 12 kilometres north-east of the Sydney central business district in the local government area of Northern Beaches Council, in the Northern Beaches region. Balgowlah shares the postcode 2093 with the adjacent suburbs of Manly Vale, Balgowlah Heights and North Balgowlah.

==History==
Balgowlah was named in 1832 after an Aboriginal word meaning &quot;north harbour&quot; in reference to its position from Port Jackson. In the early days of European Settlement it had been known as Little Manly. Sir Edmund Barton, Australia&#x27;s first prime minister, resided in the building known as Whitehall in White Street. Since 2004, Whitehall has been the site of the Norwegian Seamen&#x27;s Church.

==Heritage listings==
Balgowlah has a number of heritage-listed sites, including:
* 83 Griffiths Street: Balgowlah Substation

==Demographics==
According to the of population, there were 8,068 residents in Balgowlah. 65.2% of residents were born in Australia. The most common other countries of birth were England 9.6%, New Zealand 2.7% and South Africa 1.9%. 83.3% of residents spoke only English at home. The most common responses for religious affiliation were No Religion 47.1%, Catholic 23.0% and Anglican 14.3%.

==Commercial area==
Balgowlah&#x27;s main commercial area is located on Condamine Street and Sydney Road. Major businesses in Balgowlah are Harvey Norman and Bunnings. Stockland Balgowlah is a shopping centre located on Condamine Street. The centre opened on 15 July 2009. Its main majors are Coles, Fitness First and 62 other retailers. Stockland Balgowlah is built on the site of the historic Totem Centre, which opened in 1959. The name Totem was based on the North American model. The centre had 33 shops, a Zone Bowling bowling alley and a huge Woolworths store. In 2007 the Totem Centre was demolished, the centre was run down at the time of its demolition and the Totem name was not continued. However, the centre is still colloquially referred to as &quot;the Totem&quot; or the &quot;Totem Shopping Centre&quot; in the area. The nearest major shopping centre is Westfield Warringah Mall, located two kilometres north of the suburb.

There are a few smaller shopping areas in Balgowlah, some of them the remnants of the traditional &quot;corner shop&quot; prior to the 1960s.

==Transport==
Balgowlah is one of the destinations for the Hop-Skip-Jump free bus service operated by Northern Beaches Council. Numerous public buses operated by Keolis Downer Northern Beaches also operate in the area, the majority coming through Balgowlah en route to Manly, Westfield Warringah Mall, Seaforth and the city.

==Schools==
Schools in the Balgowlah region include:
*St. Cecilias Primary School
*Balgowlah Heights Public School
*Manly West Public School
*Northern Beaches Secondary College Balgowlah Boys Campus

==Parks and reserves==
The North Harbour Reserve on Condamine Street, south of the shopping centre, is a popular picnic spot for large groups. The reserve is also on the scenic walk that runs from Manly through Fairlight, Balgowlah, Balgowlah Heights and Clontarf to The Spit, near the Spit Bridge.

<doc id="359070" wikidata="Q467068" url="?curid=359070" title="Burrowing owl">
<text>The burrowing owl (Athene cunicularia), also called the shoco, is a small, long-legged, primarily terrestrial—though not flightless—species of owl native to the open landscapes of North and South America. They are typically found in grasslands, rangelands, agricultural areas, deserts, or any other open, dry area with low vegetation. They nest and roost in burrows, and, despite their common name, do not often construct these dwellings themselves, rather repurposing disused burrows or tunnels previously excavated and inhabited by other species, such as American badgers (&quot;Taxidea taxus&quot;), foxes (&quot;Vulpes&quot; sp.), ground squirrels or prairie dogs (&quot;Cynomys&quot; spp.), among others. 

Unlike most owls, burrowing owls are often active during the day, although they tend to avoid the heat of midday. But, similar to many other species of owls, they are mostly crepuscular hunters, as they can utilize their night vision and attuned hearing to maximum potential during sunrise and sunset. Having evolved to live on open grasslands and prairie habitat (as well as badlands, chaparral and desert ecosystems), as opposed to dense forest, the burrowing owl has developed longer legs than other owls, a trait which enables it to sprint when pursuing its prey, not dissimilarly to the greater roadrunner, as well as providing momentum when taking flight; however, burrowing owls typically only become airborne for short bursts, such as when fleeing threats, and typically do not fly very high off of the ground. 

==Taxonomy==
The burrowing owl was formally described by Spanish naturalist Juan Ignacio Molina in 1782 under the binomial name &quot;Strix cunicularia&quot; from a specimen collected in Chile. The specific epithet is from the Latin &quot;cunicularius&quot;, meaning &quot;burrower&quot; or &quot;miner&quot;. The burrowing owl is now placed in the genus &quot;Athene&quot; which was introduced by German zoologist Friedrich Boie in 1822.

The burrowing owl is sometimes classified in the monotypic genus &quot;Speotyto&quot; (based on an overall unique morphology and karyotype). Osteology and DNA sequence data, though, suggests that the burrowing owl is a terrestrial member of the little owls genus (&quot;Athene&quot;), thus it is placed in that group today, by most authorities.

A considerable number of subspecies have been described, though they differ little in appearance; the taxonomic validity of several is still up-for-debate. Most subspecies are found in or near the Andes and within the Antilles of the Caribbean Sea. Although distinct from each other, the relationship of the Florida subspecies, for instance, to (and its distinctness from) the Caribbean owls, is not quite clear.

The 18 recognised subspecies, of which two are now extinct, are:

*†&quot;A. c. amaura&quot; : Antiguan burrowing owl – formerly Antigua and Saint Kitts and Nevis; extinct (&quot;circa&quot; 1905)
* &quot;A. c. boliviana&quot; : Bolivian burrowing owl – the Bolivian altiplano
* &quot;A. c. brachyptera&quot; : Margarita Island burrowing owl – Margarita Island (may include &quot;A. c. apurensis&quot;)
* &quot;A. c. carrikeri&quot; : East Colombian burrowing owl – Eastern Colombia; doubtfully distinct from &quot;A. c. tolimae&quot;
* &quot;A. c. cunicularia&quot; :- southern burrowing owl – lowlands of southern Bolivia and southern Brazil south to Tierra del Fuego
* &quot; A. c. floridana&quot; : Florida burrowing owl – Florida and the Bahamas; listed as &quot;Vulnerable&quot;
* &quot;A. c. grallaria&quot; : Brazilian burrowing owl – Central and eastern Brazil
*†&quot;A. c. guadeloupensis&quot; : Guadeloupe burrowing owl – formerly Guadeloupe and Marie-Galante islands; extinct (&quot;circa&quot; 1890)
* &quot;A. c. guantanamensis&quot; : Cuban burrowing owl – Cuba and Isla de la Juventud
* &quot;A. c. hypugaea&quot; : western burrowing owl – Southern Canada through the Great Plains, south to Central America; listed as &quot;Apparently Secure&quot;
* &quot;A. c. juninensis&quot; : south Andean burrowing owl – Andes Mountains and foothills from central Perú to northwestern Argentina (may include &quot;A. c. punensis&quot;)
* &quot;A. c. minor&quot; : Guyanese burrowing owl – southern Guyana and Roraima state (Brazil)
* &quot;A. c. nanodes&quot; : Southwest Peruvian burrowing owl – southwestern Perú (may include &quot;A. c. intermedia&quot;)
* &quot;A. c. pichinchae&quot; : West Ecuadorean burrowing owl – western Ecuador
* &quot;A. c. rostrata&quot; : Revillagigedo burrowing owl – Clarion and Revillagigedo Islands
* &quot;A. c. tolimae&quot; : West Colombian burrowing owl – Western Colombia (may include &quot;A. c. carrikeri&quot;)
* &quot;A. c. troglodytes&quot; : Hispaniolan burrowing owl – Hispaniola (Haiti and the Dominican Republic) and surrounding islands (Gonâve, Beata Island)
includes &quot;A. c. partridgei&quot; : Corrientes burrowing owl – Corrientes Province, Argentina (probably not distinct from &quot;A. c. cunicularia&quot;)

A paleosubspecies, &quot;A. c. providentiae&quot;, has been described from fossil remains from the Pleistocene of the Bahamas. How these birds relate to the extant &quot;A. c. floridana&quot; – that is, whether they were among the ancestors of that subspecies, or whether they represented a more distant lineage that completely disappeared later – is unknown.

In addition, prehistoric fossils of similar owls have been recovered from many islands in the Caribbean (Barbuda, the Cayman Islands, Jamaica, Mona Island and Puerto Rico). These birds became extinct towards the end of the Pleistocene, probably because of ecological and sea-level changes at the end of the last ice age rather than human activity. These fossil owls differed in size from present-day burrowing owls, and their relationship to the modern taxa has not been resolved.

==Description==
Burrowing owls have bright eyes; their beaks can be dark yellow or gray depending on the subspecies. They lack ear tufts and have a flattened facial disc. The owls have prominent white eyebrows and a white &quot;chin&quot; patch which they expand and display during certain behaviors, such as a bobbing of the head when agitated.

Adults have brown heads and wings with white spotting. Their chests and abdomens are white with variable brown spotting or barring, also depending on the subspecies. Juvenile owls are similar in appearance, but they lack most of the white spotting above and brown barring below. The juveniles have a buff bar across their upper wings and their breasts may be buff-colored rather than white. Burrowing owls of all ages have grayish legs longer than those of other owls.

Males and females are similar in size and appearance, so display little sexual dimorphism. Females tend to be heavier, but males tend to have longer linear measurements (wing length, tail length, etc.). Adult males appear lighter in color than females because they spend more time outside the burrow during daylight, and their feathers become &quot;sun-bleached&quot;. The burrowing owl measures long and spans across the wings, and weighs . As a size comparison, an average adult is slightly larger than an American robin (&quot;Turdus migratorius&quot;).
==Distribution and habitat ==

Before European colonization, burrowing owls probably inhabited every suitable area of the New World, but in North America, they have experienced some restrictions in distribution since then. In parts of South America, they are expanding their range due to deforestation. The western burrowing owls (&quot;A. c. hypugaea&quot;) are most common in the Rocky Mountain Arsenal National Wildlife Refuge, as well as in most of the western states. Known resident populations inhabit areas of Colorado, Arizona, New Mexico, Texas and California, where their population is reportedly threatened by human encroachment and construction.

Burrowing owls range from the southern portions of the western Canadian provinces (British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba) and all the way through Mexico to western Panamá. They are also found across the state of Florida, as well as some Caribbean islands. In South America, they are fairly common, and are known to inhabit every country on the continent, with the exception of the dense Amazon rainforest interior and the highest ranges of the Andes Mountains. Their preference is for the cooler, possibly sub-tropical coastal and temperate regions. South of the Amazon, their population seems to again rebound, as they are widely distributed from southern Brazil and the Pantanal down to Patagonia and Tierra del Fuego.

Burrowing owls are year-round residents in most of their range. Birds that breed in Canada and the northern U.S. usually migrate south to Mexico and the southern U.S. during winter months.

== Behaviour and ecology==
This species can live for at least 9 years in the wild and over 10 years in captivity. They are often killed by vehicles when crossing roads, and have many natural enemies, including badgers, coyotes, and snakes. They are also killed by both feral and domestic cats and dogs. Two birds studied in the Parque Nacional de La Macarena of Colombia were free of blood parasites.

Burrowing owls often nest and roost in the burrows made by ground squirrels, a strategy also used by rattlesnakes. When threatened, the owl retreats to the burrow and produces rattling and hissing sounds similar to those of a rattlesnake. The behavior is suggested to be an example of acoustic Batesian mimicry and has been observed to be an effective strategy against animals that are familiar with the dangers posed by rattlesnakes.

===Breeding===

The nesting season begins in late March or April in North America. Burrowing owls usually only have one mate but occasionally a male will have two mates. Pairs of owls will sometimes nest in loose colonies. Their typical breeding habitat is open grassland or prairie, but they can occasionally adapt to other open areas like airports, golf courses, and agricultural fields. Burrowing owls are slightly tolerant of human presence, often nesting near roads, farms, homes, and regularly maintained irrigation canals.

The owls nest in a burrow, hence the name burrowing owl. If burrows are unavailable and the soil is not hard or rocky, the owls may excavate their own. Burrowing owls will also nest in shallow, underground, man-made structures that have easy access to the surface.

During the nesting season, burrowing owls will collect a wide variety of materials to line their nest, some of which are left around the entrance to the burrow. The most common material is mammal dung, usually from cattle. At one time it was thought that the dung helped to mask the scent of the juvenile owls, but researchers now believe the dung helps to control the microclimate inside the burrow and to attract insects, which the owls may eat.

The female lays an egg every one or two days until she has completed a clutch, which can consist of four to 12 eggs (usually 9). She then incubates the eggs for 3–4 weeks while the male brings her food. After the eggs hatch, both parents feed the chicks. Four weeks after hatching, the chicks can make short flights and begin leaving the nest burrow. The parents still help feed the chicks for 1–3 months.

Site fidelity rates appear to vary among populations. In some locations, owls will frequently reuse a nest several years in a row. Owls in migratory northern populations are less likely to return to the same burrow every year. Also, as with many other birds, the female owls are more likely to disperse to a different site than are male owls.

===Food and feeding===

When hunting, they wait on a perch until they spot prey. Then, they swoop down on prey or fly up to catch insects in flight. Sometimes, they chase prey on foot across the ground. The highly variable diet includes invertebrates and small vertebrates, which make up roughly one third and two thirds of the diet, respectively. Burrowing owls mainly eat large insects and small rodents. Although burrowing owls often live close to ground squirrels (Marmotini), they rarely prey upon them. They also hunt bats. An analysis of burrowing owl diets in the Dominican Republic found the owls consumed ~53% invertebrates, ~28% other birds, ~15% reptiles, ~3% amphibians, and 1% mammals.

Rodent prey is usually dominated by locally superabundant species, like the delicate vesper mouse (&quot;Calomys tener&quot;) in southern Brazil. Among squamates and amphibians, small lizards like the tropical house gecko (&quot;Hemidactylus mabouia&quot;), snakes, frogs, and toads predominate. Generally, most vertebrate prey is in the weight class of several grams per individual. The largest prey are usually birds, such as eared doves (&quot;Zenaida auriculata&quot;) which may weigh almost as much as a burrowing owl, as well as sparrows.

Regarding invertebrates, the burrowing owl seems less of a generalist. It is extremely fond of termites such as Termitidae, and Orthoptera such as Conocephalinae and Copiphorinae katydids, Jerusalem crickets (Stenopelmatidae), true crickets (Gryllidae) and grasshoppers. &quot;Bothynus&quot; and &quot;Dichotomius anaglypticus&quot; scarab beetles (Scarabaeidae) were eaten far more often than even closely related species by many burrowing owls across central São Paulo (Brazil). Similarly, it was noted that among scorpions Bothriuridae were much preferred, among spiders Lycosidae (wolf spiders), and among millipedes (Diplopoda) certain Diplocheta. Small ground beetles (Carabidae) are eaten in quantity, while larger ones are much less popular as burrowing owl food, perhaps due to the vigorous defense the large species can put up. Earthworms are also preyed upon. Burrowing owls are also known to place the fecal matter of large herbivorous mammals around the outside of their burrows to attract dung beetles, which are used to provide a steady source of food for the owls. Burrowing owls can also predate on invertebrates attracted to artificial night lighting.

Unlike other owls, they also eat fruits and seeds, especially the fruit of tasajillo (&quot;Cylindropuntia leptocaulis&quot;) and other prickly pear and cholla cacti. On Clarion Island, where mammalian prey is lacking, they feed essentially on crickets and prickly pear fruit, adding Clarión wrens (&quot;Troglodytes tanneri&quot;) and young Clarion mourning doves (&quot;Zenaida macroura clarionensis&quot;) on occasion.

== Status and conservation ==
The burrowing owl is endangered in Canada and threatened in Mexico. It is a state threatened species in Colorado and Florida and a California species of special concern. It is common and widespread in open regions of many Neotropical countries, where they sometimes even inhabit fields and parks in cities. In regions bordering the Amazon Rainforest they are spreading with deforestation. It is therefore listed as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List. Burrowing owls are protected under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act in Canada, the United States, and Mexico. They are also included in CITES Appendix II. NatureServe lists the species as &quot;Apparently Secure&quot;.

===California Endangered Species Act Listing Petition===

In March 2024, Center for Biological Diversity, Urban Bird Foundation, Defenders of Wildlife, Burrowing Owl Preservation Society, Santa Clara Valley Audubon Society, Central Valley Bird Club and San Bernardino Valley Audubon Society submitted a California Endangered Species Act listing petition to the Fish and Game Commission to get protections for five populations of the western burrowing owl.

The petition requests endangered status for burrowing owls in southwestern California, central-western California and the San Francisco Bay Area, and threatened status for burrowing owls in the Central Valley and southern desert range.

=== Dependency on burrowing animals ===
The major reasons for declining populations in North America are loss of habitat, and control programs for prairie dogs. While some species of burrowing owl can dig their own burrows, most species rely on burrowing animals to burrow holes that the owls can use as shelter and nesting space. There is a high correlation between the location of burrowing animal colonies, like those of ground squirrels, with the presence of burrowing owls. Rates of burrowing owl decline have also been shown to correlate with prairie dog decline. Western burrowing owls, for example, nest in burrows made by black-tailed prairie dogs since they are unable to dig their own. However, prairie dog populations have experienced a decline, one of the causes of this being prairie dog eradication programs. When prairie dogs dig burrows, they can uproot plants in the process. This is most common in agricultural areas, where burrows cause damage to existing crops, creating a problem for local farmers. In Nebraska and Montana, eradication programs have already been put in place to manage the population of prairie dogs. Eradication programs for ground squirrels have also been put in place. In California, California ground squirrels have been known to feed on crop seedlings as well as grasses meant for cattle, which prevents crop growth and decreases food supply for cattle. However, as burrowing animal populations decrease, burrowing owls become more vulnerable to exposure to predators. With fewer burrows available, burrowing owl populations will be more concentrated, with more owls occupying fewer burrows . As a result, predators will more easily detect owl populations and be capable of eliminating larger broods of owls at once. Prairie dogs and ground squirrels also act as a buffer between owls and their predators, since they become the target prey rather than the owls. Another benefit prairie dogs in particular provide burrowing owls takes the form of their alarm calls, which alert burrowing owls if predators are nearby, therefore giving the owls ample time to hide or escape. Without burrowing animals, almost every aspect contributing to suitable and safe living for burrowing owls will no longer be available. Organizations have tried contributing to the conservation of burrowing owls by digging artificial burrows for these owls to occupy in areas with no active colony of burrowing animals. However, creating artificial burrows is not sustainable and is not effective as a long term solution.

=== Anthropogenic impacts ===

Burrowing owls readily inhabit some anthropogenic landscapes, such as airport grasslands or golf courses, and are known to take advantage of artificial nest sites (plastic burrows with tubing for the entrance) and perches. Burrowing owls have demonstrated similar reproductive success in rural grasslands and urban settings. The urban-residing burrowing owls have also developed the behavior of digging their own burrows and exhibit different fear responses to human and domestic dogs compared to their rural counterparts. Research has suggested that this species has made adaptations to the rapid urbanization of their usual habitat, and conservation efforts should be considered accordingly. Genetic analysis of the two North American subspecies indicates that inbreeding is not a problem within those populations.

=== Relocation ===
Where the presence of burrowing owls conflicts with development interests, a passive relocation technique has been applied successfully: rather than capturing the birds and transporting them to a new site (which may be stressful and prone to failure), the owls are half-coerced, half-enticed to move on their own accord. The preparations need to start several months prior to the anticipated disturbance with observing the owl colony and noting especially their local movements and site preferences. After choosing a location nearby that has suitable ground and provides good burrowing owl breeding habitat, this new site is enhanced by adding burrows, perches, etc. Once the owls have accustomed to the changes and are found to be interested in the location – if possible, this should be at the onset of spring, before the breeding season starts – they are prevented from entering the old burrows. A simple one-way trapdoor design has been described that is placed over the burrow for this purpose. If everything has been correctly prepared, the owl colony will move over to the new site in the course of a few nights at most. It will need to be monitored occasionally for the following months or until the major human construction nearby has ended.

Some organizations like Center for Biological Diversity and Urban Bird Foundation contend that the removal from their burrows, either through active or passive relocation, has been a factor in the extirpation of burrowing owl populations in California because of the species high site fidelity.

<text>The Constructive Cost Model (COCOMO) is a procedural software cost estimation model developed by Barry W. Boehm. The model parameters are derived from fitting a regression formula using data from historical projects (63 projects for COCOMO 81 and 163 projects for COCOMO II).

== History ==

The constructive cost model was developed by Barry W. Boehm in the late 1970s and published in Boehm&#x27;s 1981 book &quot;Software Engineering Economics&quot; as a model for estimating effort, cost, and schedule for software projects. It drew on a study of 63 projects at TRW Aerospace where Boehm was Director of Software Research and Technology. The study examined projects ranging in size from 2,000 to 100,000 lines of code, and programming languages ranging from assembly to PL/I. These projects were based on the waterfall model of software development which was the prevalent software development process in 1981.

References to this model typically call it &quot;COCOMO 81&quot;. In 1995 &quot;COCOMO II&quot; was developed and finally published in 2000 in the book &quot;Software Cost Estimation with COCOMO II&quot;. COCOMO II is the successor of COCOMO 81 and is claimed to be better suited for estimating modern software development projects; providing support for more recent software development processes and was tuned using a larger database of 161 projects. The need for the new model came as software development technology moved from mainframe and overnight batch processing to desktop development, code reusability, and the use of off-the-shelf software components.

COCOMO consists of a hierarchy of three increasingly detailed and accurate forms. The first level, &quot;Basic COCOMO&quot; is good for quick, early, rough order of magnitude estimates of software costs, but its accuracy is limited due to its lack of factors to account for difference in project attributes (&quot;Cost Drivers&quot;). &quot;Intermediate COCOMO&quot; takes these Cost Drivers into account and &quot;Detailed COCOMO&quot; additionally accounts for the influence of individual project phases.
Last one is Complete COCOMO model which addresses the shortcomings of both basic &amp; intermediate.

== Intermediate COCOMOs ==
&quot;Intermediate COCOMO&quot; computes software development effort as function of program size and a set of &quot;cost drivers&quot; that include subjective assessment of product, hardware, personnel and project attributes. This extension considers a set of four &quot;cost drivers&quot;, each with a number of subsidiary attributes:-

* Product attributes
** Required software reliability extent
** Size of application database
** Complexity of the product
* Hardware attributes
** Run-time performance constraints
** Memory constraints
** Volatility of the virtual machine environment
** Required turnabout time
* Personnel attributes
** Analyst capability
** Software engineering capability
** Applications experience
** Virtual machine experience
** Programming language experience
* Project attributes
** Use of software tools
** Application of software engineering methods
** Required development schedule

Each of the 15 attributes receives a rating on a six-point scale that ranges from &quot;very low&quot; to &quot;extra high&quot; (in importance or value). An effort multiplier from the table below applies to the rating. The product of all effort multipliers results in an &quot;effort adjustment factor (EAF)&quot;. Typical values for EAF range from 0.9 to 1.4.

The Intermediate Cocomo formula now takes the form:

where &quot;E&quot; is the effort applied in person-months, KLoC is the estimated number of thousands of delivered lines of code for the project, and EAF is the factor calculated above. The coefficient &quot;ai&quot; and the exponent &quot;bi&quot; are given in the next table.

The Development time &quot;D&quot; and also the most effective number of Persons &quot;P&quot; calculation uses &quot;E&quot; in the same way as in the Basic COCOMO:
:

Note that in addition to the EAF, the parameter &quot;ai&quot; is different in &quot;Intermediate COCOMO&quot; from the Basic model:

The parameters &quot;b&quot; and &quot;c&quot; are the same in both models.

<text>The 2003 National Assembly for Wales election was the second general election to the National Assembly for Wales. It was held on 1 May 2003. The election was characterised by a resurgence for the Labour Party, whilst Plaid Cymru saw a reduction in support and the number of Assembly Members they returned. Having won thirty seats, one short of a majority, Labour chose to govern in minority without a coalition partner.

This election also saw the returning of John Marek as an independent member of the Assembly. Of the 60 members elected, 30 were male and 30 were female.

It was held on the same day as the 2003 Scottish Parliament election and 2003 United Kingdom local elections.

<doc id="359092" wikidata="Q6658351" url="?curid=359092" title="Liverpool City Council">
<text>Liverpool City Council is the local authority for the city of Liverpool in Merseyside, England. Liverpool has had a local authority since 1207, which has been reformed on numerous occasions. Since 1974 the council has been a metropolitan borough council. It provides the majority of local government services in the city. The council has been a member of the Liverpool City Region Combined Authority since 2014.

The council has been under Labour majority control since 2010. It meets at Liverpool Town Hall and has its main offices at the Cunard Building.

==History==
Liverpool was an ancient borough, having been granted its first charter by King John in 1207. It had a mayor from at least 1292.

===Municipal borough===
Liverpool was reformed to become a municipal borough in 1836 under the Municipal Corporations Act 1835, which standardised how most boroughs operated across the country. It was then governed by a body formally called the &#x27;mayor, aldermen and burgesses of the borough of Liverpool&#x27;, generally known as the corporation or town council. As part of the same reforms, the borough boundaries were enlarged to match the larger Liverpool parliamentary constituency, which had been expanded in 1832 to include the neighbouring parishes of Everton and Kirkdale and part of West Derby. The corporation created a police force in 1836.
Liverpool was granted city status in 1880, after which the corporation was also known as the city council. When elected county councils were established in 1889, Liverpool was considered large enough to provide its own county-level services, and so it became a county borough, independent from the new Lancashire County Council, whilst remaining part of the geographical county of Lancashire. In 1893 the city was granted the right to appoint a lord mayor.

The city boundaries were enlarged on several occasions, notably gaining Wavertree, Walton and parts of Toxteth and West Derby in 1895, Fazakerley in 1905, Allerton, Childwall and Woolton in 1913, the rest of West Derby in 1928, and Speke in 1932.

Liverpool&#x27;s first female councillor was Eleanor Rathbone, elected in 1909. Eighteen years later, Margaret Beavan became the first female Lord Mayor in 1927.

===Metropolitan borough===
The city was reformed to become a metropolitan district in 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972. It kept the same boundaries as the former county borough (which had last been adjusted in 1956) and became one of five metropolitan districts within the new metropolitan county of Merseyside. Liverpool&#x27;s borough and city statuses and its lord mayoralty passed to the reformed district and its council.

From 1974 until 1986 the council was a lower-tier authority, with upper-tier functions provided by Merseyside County Council. The county council was abolished in 1986 and its functions passed to Merseyside&#x27;s five borough councils, including Liverpool, with some services provided through joint committees.

During the 1980s, the Militant group gained control of Liverpool&#x27;s Labour Party. Under their leadership the council attempted to challenge the national government on several issues, including refusing to set a budget in 1985. The leadership of the national Labour Party was drawn into the controversy, ultimately expelling members of Militant, including the council&#x27;s deputy leader, Derek Hatton, in 1986.

In 2012 the council introduced the position of Mayor of Liverpool as a directly elected mayor to serve as the council&#x27;s political leader instead of having a leader of the council chosen by the councillors. The position was separate from the more ceremonial role of the Lord Mayor. The directly elected mayor position was abolished in 2023 and the position of leader of the council was reinstated.

Since 2014 the council has been a member of the Liverpool City Region Combined Authority, which has been led by the directly elected Mayor of the Liverpool City Region since 2017. The combined authority provides strategic leadership and co-ordination for certain functions across the region, but Liverpool City Council continues to be responsible for most local government functions.

The council&#x27;s chief executive, Ged Fitzgerald, was suspended in 2017 and subsequently resigned in 2018 following an investigation by Lancashire Constabulary into financial irregularities relating to a joint project between Lancashire County Council and British Telecom (BT) during Fitzgerald&#x27;s tenure as chief executive of the county council. The police investigation subsequently widened to investigate alleged criminality at the city council and the Merseyside pension fund too. In 2020, it was reported that the city council&#x27;s accounts since 2015 had not been signed off by its auditors on account of the &#x27;complex ongoing police investigation&#x27;.

In December 2020, the elected mayor, Joe Anderson, was arrested as part of an anti-corruption investigation. The Labour Party suspended Anderson on news of his arrest. He did not resign as mayor but stood back from active duties, handing effective control to the deputy mayor, Wendy Simon, for the remainder of his term of office to May 2021. As of April 2024 no charges had been brought against him, but the investigation had yet to conclude.

On 24 March 2021, the Secretary of State for Housing, Communities and Local Government, Robert Jenrick, announced that he was appointing commissioners to oversee some of the authority&#x27;s functions for at least 3 years. This was following an investigation, commissioned in December 2020 that found there were &quot;multiple apparent failures&quot; and a &quot;deeply concerning picture of mismanagement&quot; in the council.

The commissioners remained in post until June 2024. Following improvements in the council&#x27;s performance and management, the intervention was then scaled back to less direct supervision, due to last until March 2025.

==Governance==
Liverpool City Council provides metropolitan borough services. Some strategic functions in the area are provided by the Liverpool City Region Combined Authority; the leader of Liverpool City Council sits on the combined authority as Liverpool&#x27;s representative. There are no civil parishes in the city.

===Political control===
The council has been under Labour majority control since 2010.

In the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, the council was run by the Conservatives. Labour councillors were first elected to the council in 1905, but Liverpool was one of the last major cities in the UK in which the Labour Party gained control, which first occurred in 1955.

Municipal borough
Political control of the council since the 1974 reforms has been as follows:

Metropolitan borough
===Leadership===
The role of Lord Mayor of Liverpool is largely ceremonial role. Political leadership is instead provided by the leader of the council. Between 2012 and 2023 the council had a directly elected Mayor of Liverpool (a separate post from the Lord Mayor) instead of a leader. The directly elected mayor position was abolished in 2023 and the position of leader reinstated. The leaders since 1918 have been:

County Borough leaders

The last leader of the council before the 1974 reforms, Bill Sefton, went on to be the first leader of Merseyside County Council.

Metropolitan Borough leaders
Directly elected mayors

Metropolitan Borough leaders
===Composition===
Following the 2023 election the composition of the council was:
The next election is due in 2027.

==Elections==

Since the last boundary changes in 2023, 85 councillors have been elected from 64 wards, with each ward electing one, two or three councillors. Elections are held every four years.

These are the wards since the 2023 local elections.

==Premises==

Council meetings are held at Liverpool Town Hall at the junction of High Street, Dale Street and Water Street, which was built between 1749 and 1754. The council&#x27;s main administrative offices are located in the Cunard Building at Pier Head, which had been completed in 1917 as the headquarters of the Cunard Line. The council bought the building in 2013.

From 1868 until 2016 the council&#x27;s main offices were the Municipal Buildings on Dale Street. The Municipal Buildings were sold in 2016 after the council decided they were too large and costly to maintain and following the transfer of most offices to the Cunard Building.

<doc id="359096" wikidata="Q3836406" url="?curid=359096" title="Log-structured file system">
<text>A log-structured filesystem is a file system in which data and metadata are written sequentially to a circular buffer, called a log. The design was first proposed in 1988 by John K. Ousterhout and Fred Douglis and first implemented in 1992 by Ousterhout and Mendel Rosenblum for the Unix-like Sprite distributed operating system.

== Rationale ==
Conventional file systems lay out files with great care for spatial locality and make in-place changes to their data structures in order to perform well on optical and magnetic disks, which tend to seek relatively slowly.

The design of log-structured file systems is based on the hypothesis that this will no longer be effective because ever-increasing memory sizes on modern computers would lead to I/O becoming write-heavy since reads would be almost always satisfied from memory cache. A log-structured file system thus treats its storage as a circular log and writes sequentially to the head of the log.

This has several important side effects:
* Write throughput on optical and magnetic disks is improved because they can be batched into large sequential runs and costly seeks are kept to a minimum.
** The structure is naturally suited to media with append-only zones or pages such as flash storages and shingled magnetic recording HDDs
* Writes create multiple, chronologically-advancing versions of both file data and meta-data. Some implementations make these old file versions nameable and accessible, a feature sometimes called time-travel or snapshotting. This is very similar to a versioning file system.
* Recovery from crashes is simpler. Upon its next mount, the file system does not need to walk all its data structures to fix any inconsistencies, but can reconstruct its state from the last consistent point in the log.

Log-structured file systems, however, must reclaim free space from the tail of the log to prevent the file system from becoming full when the head of the log wraps around to meet it. The tail can release space and move forward by skipping over data for which newer versions exist further ahead in the log. If there are no newer versions, then the data is moved and appended to the head.

To reduce the overhead incurred by this garbage collection, most implementations avoid purely circular logs and divide up their storage into segments. The head of the log simply advances into non-adjacent segments which are already free. If space is needed, the least-full segments are reclaimed first. This decreases the I/O load (and decreases the write amplification) of the garbage collector, but becomes increasingly ineffective as the file system fills up and nears capacity.

== Disadvantages ==
The design rationale for log-structured file systems assumes that most reads will be optimized away by ever-enlarging memory caches. This assumption does not always hold:
* On magnetic media—where seeks are relatively expensive—the log structure may actually make reads much slower, since it fragments files that conventional file systems normally keep contiguous with in-place writes.
* On flash memory—where seek times are usually negligible—the log structure may not confer a worthwhile performance gain because write fragmentation has much less of an impact on write throughput. Another issue is stacking one log on top of another log, which is not a very good idea as it forces multiple erases with unaligned access. However, many flash based devices cannot rewrite part of a block, and they must first perform a (slow) erase cycle of each block before being able to re-write. By putting all the writes in one block, this can help performance as opposed to writes scattered into various blocks, and each one must be copied into a buffer, erased, and written back, which is a clear advantage for so-called &quot;raw&quot; flash memory where flash translation layer is bypassed.

<text>Otto Emil Franz Grotewohl (; 11 March 1894 – 21 September 1964) was a German politician who served as the first prime minister of the German Democratic Republic (GDR/East Germany) from its foundation in October 1949 until his death in September 1964. 

Grotewohl was a Social Democratic Party (SPD) politician in the Free State of Brunswick during the Weimar Republic and leader of the party branch in the Soviet Occupation Zone after World War II. Grotewohl led the SPD&#x27;s merger with the Communist Party (KPD) to form the Socialist Unity Party of Germany (SED) in 1946 and served as co-chairman of the party with KPD leader Wilhelm Pieck until 1950. Grotewohl chaired the Council of Ministers after the establishment of the GDR in 1949 and served as the &quot;de jure&quot; head of government under First Secretary Walter Ulbricht until his death in 1964.

==Biography==
===Early years===
Grotewohl was born on 11 March 1894 in Braunschweig to a middle-class Protestant family, the son of a master tailor, and was apprenticed to a printer. At the age of 16 he joined the youth wing of the Social Democratic Party of Germany. Grotewohl served in the German Army during World War I, and started his political career after the war as a leader of the Independent Social Democratic Party of Germany (USPD), and in 1920 was elected to the &quot;Landtag&quot; of the Free State of Brunswick in the Weimar Republic. Grotewohl served as a minister in numerous cabinets of the Brunswick state government, including Minister of Justice and Education from March to May 1922, and Minister of Justice from February 1923.

In 1922, Grotewohl and the majority of the USPD members joined the Social Democratic Party, and on 31 October 1925 he became a member of parliament in the national &quot;Reichstag&quot; to replace the SPD representative Elise Bartels after her death. Grotewohl was elected to the Reichstag in his own right in the September 1930 election and re-elected in the July 1932, November 1932, and March 1933 elections.

===Nazi era===
Grotewohl was eventually dismissed as a representative in the Reichstag after the &quot;Machtergreifung&quot;, the establishment of Nazi Germany, and like other SPD members was subject to discrimination. On 23 March 1933, Grotewohl had voted against Chancellor Adolf Hitler&#x27;s Enabling Act, a constitutional amendment allowing Hitler to enact laws without the Reichstag&#x27;s approval, which passed. Grotewohl was brutally beaten, arrested and imprisoned several times by Nazi police and subsequently forced to leave Braunschweig, first moving to Hamburg then from 1938 to Berlin, where he worked as a greengrocer and industrial representative. Grotewohl joined a resistance group centered around Erich Gniffke, an SPD politician he knew from Braunschweig, but the group ended up ensuring the contact and economic survival of its members rather than resisting Nazi rule. In August 1938, Grotewohl was again brutally beaten, arrested and charged by Nazi police with treason before the People&#x27;s Court. On 4 March 1939, Grotewohl was released from pre-trial detention and the court&#x27;s procedure against him was discontinued after seven months. Grotewohl was again brutally beaten and arrested by Nazi police after Georg Elser&#x27;s attempted assassination of Adolf Hitler and other high-ranking Nazis on 8 November 1939, spending about eight weeks in custody before being released. Grotewohl worked as a clerk in Berlin after his release and increasingly devoted his time to painting. Grotewohl had been scheduled for arrest again on 20 July 1944, but the Gestapo was unable to locate him because he was now living off-the-grid. According to Heinz Voßke&#x27;s 1979 biography of Grotewohl, this lifestyle allowed him to avoid being conscripted into the &quot;Volkssturm&quot; during the closing months of World War II.

===Formation of the Socialist Unity Party===
After German defeat in World War II in May 1945, the country was occupied by the Allied forces and divided into four zones governed by the United States, the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, and France, respectively. Grotewohl and several other former SPD politicians founded a branch of the re-established Social Democratic Party of Germany in the Soviet Occupation Zone, and he became the branch leader as Chairman of the Central Committee. Immediately after the war, the Soviets believed the Communist Party of Germany (KPD), rebuilt by the &quot;Ulbricht Group&quot; and led by Wilhelm Pieck, would naturally develop into the strongest political force in their zone with some guidance. However, Soviet leader Joseph Stalin and KPD deputy leader Walter Ulbricht began to push for a merger with the eastern SPD after the poor performance of communist parties in elections in Hungary and Austria in November 1945. The SPD in the Soviet zone faced increasing pressure from the Soviet Military Administration (SVAG) to merge with the KPD, despite historic animosity between the two parties. Unification was pushed by some members of Grotewohl&#x27;s SPD in the Soviet zone and Berlin, under the belief that division between the main left-wing parties had led to Nazi rise to power. Grotewohl initially opposed the merger, but under duress from Ulbricht and SVAG soon yielded and became a proponent of a quick unification. Grotewohl&#x27;s change of heart was fiercely opposed by Kurt Schumacher, a prominent member of the eastern SPD and anti-communist, who subsequently became leader of the western SPD after the merger.

In April 1946, the KPD and the eastern branch of the SPD merged as the Socialist Unity Party (SED), with Pieck and Grotewohl serving as co-chairmen. Grotewohl&#x27;s hand appeared alongside Pieck&#x27;s on the SED&#x27;s &quot;handshake&quot; logo derived from the SPD-KPD congress establishing the party where he symbolically shook hands with Pieck. Grotewohl&#x27;s position allowed him to avoid the systematic sidelining and exclusion of former SPD members that began soon after the merger. The few recalcitrant SPD supporters were condemned as &quot;Agents of Schumacher&quot; and shunted aside, accelerating a process that left the SED as essentially the KPD under a new name. Eventually, Grotewohl was one of the few holdovers from the SPD half of the merger to have a prominent post in the merged party.

In 1948, Grotewohl became Chairman of the constitutional committee of the German People&#x27;s Council, the predecessor of the &quot;Volkskammer&quot;.

===Prime minister===
On 12 October 1949, Grotewohl became the first prime minister (&quot;Ministerpräsident&quot;) of the German Democratic Republic (commonly known as East Germany or the GDR), five days after its establishment from the Soviet Occupation Zone with the SED as the ruling party. Grotewohl was appointed Chairman of the Council of Ministers (&quot;Ministerrat&quot;), the &quot;de jure&quot; government of the GDR, while Pieck served as State President. Although Grotewohl and Pieck were officially on equal footing, Grotewohl wielded far more real political power in state affairs than Pieck. In the East German political hierarchy, the prime minister was the highest state official, with the president nominally ranking second. Thus, for the GDR&#x27;s first year of existence, Grotewohl was the most powerful politician in the country.

Grotewohl&#x27;s power was significantly reduced in July 1950, when the SED restructured along more orthodox Soviet lines. Ulbricht became First Secretary of the SED&#x27;s Central Committee, the &quot;de facto&quot; power center of the GDR, and thus the &quot;de facto&quot; leader of East Germany. Grotewohl remained as Chairman of the Council of Ministers and the official head of government without challenge from the SED. However, the Council of Ministers, despite being officially defined as the &quot;government&quot; of East Germany, was reduced to a transmission belt for policies made by the SED&#x27;s Politburo. Grotewohl was thus left as mostly a figurehead without any real influence on state affairs. Grotewohl was a member of the delegation that signed the Treaty of Zgorzelec on the recognition of the Oder-Neisse border as a border between the GDR and the People&#x27;s Republic of Poland. In 1957, Grotewohl advocated for the Rapacki Plan for a nuclear weapon-free zone in Central Europe.

Unlike Ulbricht and most of his other SED colleagues, Grotewohl was known to openly favour a more humane way of governing. He condemned abuses in the legal system in a major speech at the SED party conference on 28 March 1956. He also denounced illegal arrests, called for more respect for civil rights, and even called for lively debate in the Volkskammer. Grotewohl also made a veiled criticism of Justice Minister Hilde Benjamin&#x27;s notoriously high-handed handling of political trials. Despite his open criticism of the SED&#x27;s increasingly heavy-handed rule, Grotewohl retained his posts without reprisal because the Kremlin maintained its trust in him.

===Last years and death===
Grotewohl, who was 55 years old upon coming to power, faced rapidly declining health during his premiership. Grotewohl was repeatedly taken to a government hospital during the 1950s, typically minor examinations in which he was released on the same day, but also multi-day stays. However, Grotewohl was not only examined by specialist physicians in the GDR, who identified arteriosclerosis and incipient calcification of the coronary system in his heart in 1953, but also took advantage of the medical care of top Soviet politicians in Moscow. On 12 November 1953, Grotewohl visited the Kremlin Polyclinic in Moscow. Afterwards, Grotewohl completed a three-and-a-half-week cure on the Black Sea. He reportedly took advantage of these unofficial stays in Moscow to conduct political talks with the Kremlin, but there are no official records. From 1955, Grotewohl&#x27;s doctors were worried about the condition of his cardiovascular system. In 1959, they finally diagnosed incipient heart failure and pushed for a reduction in workload. Due to the persistent high blood pressure and the chronic arrhythmia, the physicians feared a heart attack. 

In 1960, Grotewohl was diagnosed with leukemia, and the course of the year saw his health deteriorate rapidly to the point he was barely able to participate in daily political business. On 4 April 1960, Grotewohl traveled to a four-week relaxing holiday on the Black Sea; eight months later, he arrived again for several weeks in the Soviet sanatorium in Barvikha. After his return from the Soviet Union, he reluctantly moved with his wife from Pankow to Wandlitz, giving in to a previous decision from Ulbricht. At the end of October 1960, Grotewohl had commissioned his top deputy, Willi Stoph, as acting prime minister, although he officially remained in office. The permanent cardiovascular disorders prevented Grotewohl&#x27;s return to politics, and he was no longer able to participate actively in the meetings of the leadership committees of the party and the government. As his eyesight also faded, he could no longer read any script, which is why there are hardly any public speeches from him at the beginning of 1961. Despite the clear medical situation, his resignation was out of the question. On the contrary, in September 1960 Grotewohl became Deputy Chairman of the State Council, the collective body that was created on the base of the Presidency which was abolished after Wilhelm Pieck&#x27;s death in 1960. 

Grotewohl died on 21 September 1964, at 12:35 noon, in the Niederschönhausen area of Pankow, East Berlin, from the complications of a brain haemorrhage. A few hours later, the GDR flag on the Brandenburg Gate was lowered half-mast and the Deutscher Fernsehfunk broadcasting was interrupted. The GDR Council of Ministers ordered 3-day mourning period and Grotewohl was lying in state in the SED Headquarters. On 15 October, his ashes were buried at the &quot;Memorial to the Socialists&quot; () in the Friedrichsfelde Central Cemetery, Berlin.

==Legacy==
After his death, the &quot;Wilhelmstrasse&quot; in East Berlin was renamed &quot;Otto-Grotewohl-Straße&quot; in his honor; the street retained this name until 1991, following German reunification. On 15 April 1986, the present-day Mohrenstraße U-Bahn station in eastern Berlin, then known as the &quot;Thälmannplatz&quot; station, was also renamed &quot;Otto-Grotewohl-Straße&quot;. The Third German School in Chapayesky Lane, Moscow, was named the Otto Grotewohl School.

==Personal life==

Grotewohl was married to Marie Martha Louise (&quot;née&quot; Ohst) from 1919 until 1949. The couple had two children, a son Hans and daughter Dorle. Hans Grotewohl (1924–1999), was an architect who was sent by his father to lead a German Work Team for rebuilding Hamhung, North Korea, in 1954 after the Korean War. Grotewohl married his secretary, Johanna Schumann (&quot;née&quot; Danielzig) the same year as his divorce from Ohst. 

He was an avid painter and amateur filmmaker.

<text>A rhyme scheme is the pattern of rhymes at the end of each line of a poem or song. It is usually referred to by using letters to indicate which lines rhyme; lines designated with the same letter all rhyme with each other.

An example of the ABAB rhyming scheme, from &quot;To Anthea, who may Command him Anything&quot;, by Robert Herrick:

== Function in writing ==

These rhyme patterns have various effects, and can be used to:

* Control flow: If every line has the same rhyme (AAAA), the stanza will read as having a very quick flow, whereas a rhyme scheme like ABCABC can be felt to unfold more slowly. 
* Structure a poem&#x27;s message and thought patterns: For example, a simple couplet with a rhyme scheme of AABB lends itself to simpler direct ideas, because the resolution comes in the very next line. Essentially these couplets can be thought of as self-contained statements. This idea of rhyme schemes reflecting thought processes is often discussed particularly regarding sonnets.
* Determine whether a stanza is balanced or unbalanced.
* Help to reinforce the feeling being expressed: If the writer wants to express stubbornness, they may use tight structured rhyme schemes, whereas if one was writing about feeling lost, then perhaps the stanza would only have one rhyme (XXAXXXA).

A basic distinction is between rhyme schemes that apply to a single stanza, and those that continue their pattern throughout an entire poem (see chain rhyme). There are also more elaborate related forms, like the sestina – which requires repetition of exact words in a complex pattern. Rhyming is not a mandatory feature of poetry; a four-line stanza with non-rhyming lines could be described as using the scheme ABCD.

==Notation and examples==

Notation used below:
* ABAB – Four-line stanza, first and third lines rhyme at the end, second and fourth lines rhyme at the end.
* AB AB – Two two-line stanzas, with the first lines rhyming at the end and the second lines rhyming at the end.
* AB,AB – Single two-line stanza, with the two lines having both a single internal rhyme and a conventional rhyme at the end.
* aBaB – Two different possible meanings for a four-line stanza:
** First and third lines rhyme at the end, second and fourth lines are repeated verbatim.
** First and third lines have a feminine rhyme and the second and fourth lines have a masculine rhyme.
* – Two stanzas, where the first lines of both stanzas are exactly the same, and the last lines of both stanzas are the same. The second lines of the two stanzas are different, but rhyme at the end with the first and last lines. (In other words, all the &quot;A&quot; and &quot;a&quot; lines rhyme with each other, but not with the &quot;b&quot; lines.)
* XAXA – Four lines, two unrhymed (X) and two with the same end rhyme (A)

Other notation examples:
* Indicating the number of stressed syllables in certain lines: AA4B2CC4 or AA4B2CC4
* Some publications use lowercase or have punctuation to separate lines or stanzas, e.g. or . (These variations are not used elsewhere in this article, for clarity.)

==In hip-hop music==
Hip-hop music and rapping&#x27;s rhyme schemes include traditional schemes such as couplets, as well as forms specific to the genre, which are broken down extensively in the books &quot;How to Rap&quot; and &quot;Book of Rhymes&quot;. Rhyme schemes used in hip-hop music include 
*Couplets
*Single-liners
*Multi-liners
*Combinations of schemes
*Whole verse

Couplets are the most common type of rhyme scheme in old school rap and are still regularly used, though complex rhyme schemes have progressively become more frequent. Rather than relying on end rhymes, rap rhyme schemes can have rhymes placed anywhere in the bars of music to create a structure. There can also be numerous rhythmic elements which all work together in the same scheme – this is called internal rhyme in traditional poetry, though rap rhymes schemes can be anywhere in the bar, they could all be internal, so the term is not always used. Rap verses can also employ &#x27;extra rhymes&#x27;, which do not structure the verse like the main rhyme schemes, but which add to the overall sound of the verse.

==Number of rhyme schemes for a poem with &quot;n&quot; lines==

The number of different possible rhyme schemes for an &quot;n&quot;-line poem is given by the Bell numbers,
which for &quot;n&quot; = 1, 2, 3, ... are
:1, 2, 5, 15, 52, 203, 877, 4140, 21147, 115975, .. .

Examples: We find one rhyme scheme for a one-line poem (A), two different rhyme schemes for a two-line poem (AA, AB), and five for a three-line poem: AAA, AAB, ABA, ABB, and ABC.

These counts, however, include rhyme schemes in which rhyme is not employed at all (ABCD). There are many fewer rhyme schemes when all lines must rhyme with at least one other line; a count of these is given by the numbers,
:0, 1, 1, 4, 11, 41, 162, 715, 3425, 17722, ... .
For example, for a three-line poem, there is only one rhyming scheme in which every line rhymes with at least one other (AAA), while for a four-line poem, there are four such schemes (AABB, ABAB, ABBA, and AAAA).

<doc id="359112" wikidata="Q5385032" url="?curid=359112" title="Erasure poetry">
<text>Erasure poetry, or blackout poetry, is a form of found poetry or found object art created by erasing words from an existing text in prose or verse and framing the result on the page as a poem. The results can be allowed to stand &quot;in situ&quot; or they can be arranged into lines and/or stanzas.

Writers and visual artists have adopted this form both to achieve a range of cognitive or symbolic effects and to focus on the social or political meanings of erasure. Erasure is a way to give an existing piece of writing a new set of meanings, questions, or suggestions. It lessens the trace of authorship but also draws attention to the original text.

== History ==
Doris Cross appears to have been among the earliest to utilize this technique, beginning in 1965 with her &quot;Dictionary Columns&quot; book art. Other examples before 1980 include:
*&quot;A Humument,&quot; Tom Phillips&#x27; 1970 major work of book art and found poetry deconstructed from a Victorian novel.
*&quot;Radi Os&quot;, Ronald Johnson&#x27;s, long 1977 poem deconstructed from the text of Milton&#x27;s &quot;Paradise Lost&quot;. 
*&quot;Mans Wows&quot; – Jesse Glass&#x27; &quot;Mans Wows&quot; (1981), is a series of poems and performance pieces mined from John George Hohman&#x27;s book of charms and healings &quot;Pow Wows, or The Long Lost Friend&quot;.

Modern Poet Alicia Cook is known for redacting her own poetry to create new works. Since 2016, she has published three poetry collections, each featuring 92 original poems alongside their blackout poetry counterparts.

The poetic form gained new political purpose online in 2017 in response to the Trump administration.

The tradition of concrete poetry and the works of visual artists such as d.a. levy have some relationship to this artform.

==Use in representations of political or social themes==
=== Government and military secrecy ===

Jenny Holzer&#x27;s &quot;Redaction Paintings&quot; consists of enlarged, colorized silkscreen &quot;paintings&quot; of declassified and often heavily censored American military and intelligence documents that have recently been made available to the public through the Freedom of Information Act. The works are intended as reminders of the editing or erasure that goes on behind the scenes in the American military/political power system. Documents address counter-terrorism, prisoner abuse, and the threat of Osama bin Laden. Some of the documents are almost completely inked out, like Colin Powell&#x27;s memo on Defense Intelligence Agency reorganization.

Anthropologist Michael Powell writes: &quot;While the literal act of redaction attempts to extract information and eradicate meaning, the black marker actually transforms the way we read these documents, sparking curiosity and often stirring skeptical, critical, and even cynical readings. As redacted government documents make their way from government bureaus into the hands of citizens, a peculiar transformation seems to take place, one that seems to create a paranoia within reason.&quot;

&quot;Seven Testimonies (redacted)&quot; – Nick Flynn&#x27;s &quot;Seven Testimonies (redacted)&quot; in &quot;The Captain Asks a Show of Hands&quot;, is an erasure of the testimonies from prisoners at Abu Ghraib.

=== Holocaust ===
Jonathan Safran Foer&#x27;s 2010 &quot;Tree of Codes&quot; is a book-length erasure of &quot;The Street of Crocodiles&quot; by Bruno Schulz. Schulz was killed by an officer of the Gestapo during the Nazi occupation of his hometown Drohobycz, after distributing the bulk of his life&#x27;s work to gentile friends immediately prior to the occupation. All of these manuscripts have been lost. &quot;The Tree of Codes&quot; is Safran-Foer&#x27;s attempt to represent the unrepresentable loss which occurred in the Holocaust by deleting text, rather than by writing another book about the Holocaust as a historical subject or context for a work of fiction. Safran-Foer&#x27;s approach to the Holocaust as an &quot;unrepresentable subject&quot; recalls the use of negative space in the poetry of Dan Pagis.

=== Freedom and Slavery ===
Poet Laureate Tracy K. Smith has written several erasure poems, including &quot;Declaration&quot; (drawn from the Declaration of Independence) and &quot;The Greatest Personal Privation&quot; (from letters about slaveholding).

Poet Nicole Sealey wrote &quot;The Ferguson Report: An Erasure&quot;, a book length erasure of the Ferguson Report which comments on the Killing of Michael Brown and the subsequent Ferguson unrest. Her poem &quot;Pages 22–29, an excerpt from the book, won a Forward Prize for Poetry in October 2021.

=== Indigenous erasure poetry ===
Poets such as Jordan Abel and Billy-Ray Belcourt have engaged in erasure poetry to mirror the erasure of Indigenous peoples from history. Through working to erase existing texts such as Treaty 8 in &quot;NDN Coping Mechanisms&quot; by Billy-Ray Belcourt and &quot;Totem Poles&quot; by Canadian ethnographer Marius Barbeau in &quot;The Place of Scraps&quot; by Jordan Abel these two poets &quot;make and unmake texts&quot; the way Indigenous histories have been made and unmade by colonialist influences.

<doc id="359117" wikidata="Q192789" url="?curid=359117" title="Robert Wadlow">
<text>Robert Pershing Wadlow (February 22, 1918 July 15, 1940), also known as the Alton Giant and the Giant of Illinois, was an American man. He is the tallest person in recorded history for whom there is irrefutable evidence. Wadlow was born and raised in Alton, Illinois, a small city near St. Louis, Missouri.

Wadlow&#x27;s height was while his weight reached at his death at age 22. His great size and his continued growth in adulthood were due to hypertrophy of his pituitary gland, which results in an abnormally high level of human growth hormone (HGH).

==Early life==
Wadlow was born in Alton, Illinois, on February 22, 1918, to Harold Franklin and Addie May (Johnson) Wadlow, and was the oldest of five children. He was taller than his father by age 8, and in elementary school a special desk was made for him. He was involved in a school German and Camera club before his graduation. By the time of his graduation from Alton High School in 1936, he was . He enrolled in Shurtleff College with the intention of studying law.
==Adulthood==
Wadlow required leg braces when walking and had little feeling in his legs and feet, but he never used a wheelchair.

Wadlow became a celebrity after his 1936 U.S. tour with the Ringling Brothers Circus, appearing at Madison Square Garden and the Boston Garden in the center ring (never in the sideshow). During his appearances, he dressed in his everyday clothes and refused the circus&#x27;s request that he wear a top hat and tails.

In 1938, he began a promotional tour with the International Shoe Company, which provided him shoes free of charge, again only in his everyday street clothes. Wadlow saw himself as working in advertising, not exhibiting as a freak. He possessed great physical strength until the last few days of his life.

Wadlow belonged to the Order of DeMolay, the Masonic-sponsored organization for young men, and was later a Freemason. By November 1939, Wadlow was a Master Mason under the jurisdiction of the Grand Lodge of Illinois A.F. and A.M.

One year before his death, Wadlow passed John Rogan as the tallest person ever recorded. On June 27, 1940 (18 days before his death), he was measured by doctors at .

==Death==
On July 4, 1940, during a professional appearance at the Manistee National Forest Festival, a faulty brace irritated his ankle, leading to infection. He was treated with a blood transfusion and surgery, but his condition worsened and he died in his sleep on July 15.

His coffin measured long by wide by deep, weighed over , and was carried by twelve pallbearers and eight assistants. He was buried at Oakwood Cemetery in Alton, Illinois.

==Legacy==
A life-size statue of Wadlow was erected opposite the Alton Museum of History and Art in 1986. He is one of the Guinness World Records ICONS of 2025.

<text>Pantun (Jawi: ) is a Malayic oral poetic form used to express intricate ideas and emotions. It generally consists of even-numbered lines and based on ABAB rhyming schemes. The shortest consists of two lines better known as the in Malay, while the longest , the have 16 lines. is a disjunctive form of poetry which always come in two parts, the first part being the prefatory statement called or that has no immediate logical or the narrative connection with the second or closing statement called or . However, they are always connected by the rhymes and other verbal associations, such as puns and repeating sounds. There is also an oblique but necessary relationship and the first statement often turns out to be a metaphor for the second one. The most popular form of is the quatrain (four lines), and the couplet (two-lines), which both featured prominently in the literature and modern popular culture.

The earliest literary records of date back to the 15th century Malacca Sultanate, although some historians believe that may be as old, or precedes the Classical Malay language itself, grew and spread during the Srivijaya era, where the founder of Malacca was from. during Malacca era was featured in the most important Malay literary text, the Malay Annals and is regarded as a high art and has been the integral part of classical Malay literature. It also thrived as a natural part in the daily communication of traditional Malay society and served as the important expressive tool in Malay songs, rituals, performing arts and in all form of storytelling.

==Etymology==
According to Za&#x27;aba, the word is thought to evolve from the Malay word (Jawi: سڤنتون) meaning &#x27;same as&#x27;. The word is used to signify a proverbial metaphor or simile, a type of figure of speech commonly found in traditional or proverbs from classical Malay literature. The archaic meaning of pantun in Malay language also refers to a form of proverb used for indirect references, which has similar role to as poetry, that are still generally created in styles portraying (indirect references) and (analogies).

Other theory suggests that originated from the word (&#x27;guider&#x27;), from noun-building prefix and the verb (Jawi:تونتون) or &#x27;to guide&#x27;. Alternatively, Brandstetter suggested that the word originates from and its similar sounding variants in Austronesian languages, with multiple meanings; Kapampangan (&#x27;well organized&#x27;), Tagalog (&#x27;skillful arrangement&#x27;), Old Javanese (&#x27;thread&#x27;), (&#x27;well arranged&#x27;), (&#x27;to lead&#x27;), and Toba Batak (&#x27;polite&#x27; or &#x27;worthy of respect&#x27;). Winstedt supported this opinion, noting that in many Austronesian languages, words which suggest &#x27;something set out in rows&#x27; gradually gain the new meaning of &#x27;well-arranged words&#x27;, in prose or in poetry. Ari Welianto suggested that is originated from Minangkabau word of which means &quot;guide&quot;.

== History ==
Some scholars believe that predates literacy and maybe as old as the Malay language itself, Muhammad Haji Salleh believe that form grew and spread from Srivijaya, and most probably from around the city of Palembang or Malayu. When Palembang became more dominant, of the two cities would be known to each other&#x27;s population, and while they used the same language, they were adversaries politically. Nevertheless, the tradition was known to have reached its refined form with the flowering of classical Malay literature from the 15th century. Notable literary works like Malay Annals and Hikayat Hang Tuah contain the earliest written examples of .

For at least 500 years, spread from Malay language through trade routes, ports, and migrations and became the most dynamic single literary form. Today, it is known in at least 40 dialects of Malay, and 35 non-Malay languages, in the Malay Peninsula and many of the islands of Maritime Southeast Asia. The popularity of among hybrid communities like Peranakans, Chitty and Kristang people, signifies its preeminent position as a cultural symbol in the Malay world. A type of called that consists of interwoven quatrains, was introduced to Western poetry in the 19th century by Ernest Fouinet and later popularised by Victor Hugo, that forms the basis of modern pantoum.

== Tradition ==
The originated as a traditional oral form of expression, manifesting the traditional Malay views of life and their surroundings, and utilized to express an endless range of emotions and ideas. As a symbol of Malay identity, are known to be the reflections of &quot;adat&quot; (&#x27;customs) and &quot;adab&quot; (&#x27;manners&#x27;). As Malay culture emphasised the importance of polite and indirect expressions, s are generally created in styles portraying various forms of figurative language. Elements of metaphors, similes, symbols, personifications, eponyms, allusions, idioms and proverbs are abound in the elegantly compacted Malay .

In Malay culture, is an important instrument of communication in various social, cultural, and economic activities. It is used traditionally to express feelings, to give advice, to exchange quizzes, and also to sweeten conversations. For example, are used in the customary verbal exchange in a Malay wedding (or engagement) ceremony, especially as part of the culturally sanctioned greetings between the representatives of the bridegroom and the bride upon their arrival at the bride house. As an expressive tool, are also used extensively in the lyrics of traditional Malay songs that tuned to the popular rhythms like Zapin, Inang and Joget. Other notable application of can be found as a structural support for art performances like Dondang sayang, Bangsawan, Mak yong, Mek Mulung and Dikir barat. The skill in performing these poems is to recite in a way to suggest a form of singing while at the same time conjure up the ability to engage in quick, witty and subtle dialogue.

Indonesia possesses a wealth of verbal art. A largely nonwritten tradition of reciting expressive, often witty quatrains called is common in most Malay areas throughout the archipelago. Some performances are narrative; the traditions of central and eastern Java, for instance, use structure (which is called ) to recount religious or local historical tales to the accompaniment of a drum, although this appears to be modern adaptations, as writers from the early 20th century like H Overbeck and JJ De Hollander noted that a tradition similar to did not exist in Javanese at that time. Indeed, much of Indonesia&#x27;s traditional literature forms the foundation of complex mixed-genre performances, such as the Randai of the Minangkabau of western Sumatra, which blends instrumental music, dance, drama, and martial arts in ceremonial settings.

==Description==
In its most basic form, the consists of a quatrain which employs an ABAB rhyme scheme. A is traditionally recited according to a fixed rhythm and as a rule of thumb, in order not to deviate from the rhythm, every line should contain between eight and 12 syllables. &quot;The is a four-lined verse consisting of alternating, roughly rhyming lines. The first and second lines sometimes appear completely disconnected in meaning from the third and fourth, but there is almost invariably a link of some sort. Whether it be a mere association of ideas, or of feeling, expressed through assonance or through the faintest nuance of thought, it is nearly always traceable&quot; (Sim, page 12). The is highly allusive and in order to understand it, readers generally need to know the traditional meaning of the symbols the poem employs. An example (followed by a translation by Katharine Sim):

According to Sim, literally means &#x27;a floating coconut shell at sixes and sevens&#x27;. (&#x27;sweet basil&#x27;) implies &#x27;lover&#x27;, because it rhymes with the word for that, . Other frequently recurring symbols are the flower and the bee, indicating a girl and her lover, the squirrel () implying a seducer, and the water hyacinth () meaning love that will not take root. The often makes use of proverbs as well as geographical and historical allusions, for example, the following poem by Munshi Abdullah:

This alludes to the foundation of Singapore in 1819 by Sir Stamford Raffles. The last line means a girl who is protected by a powerful man, and Sim suggests this may refer to Raffles&#x27;s wife Olivia.

Sometimes a may consist of a series of interwoven quatrains, in which case it is known as a . This follows the ABAB rhyme scheme with the second and fourth lines of each stanza becoming the first and third lines of the following stanza. Finally, the first and third lines of the first stanza become the second and fourth lines of the last stanza, usually in reverse order so that the first and last lines of the poem are identical. This form of has exercised the most influence on Western literature, in which it is known as the &quot;pantoum&quot;.

<doc id="359126" wikidata="Q650682" url="?curid=359126" title="Denbighshire">
<text>Denbighshire ( ; ) is a county in the north-east of Wales. It borders the Irish Sea to the north, Flintshire to the east, Wrexham to the southeast, Powys to the south, and Gwynedd and Conwy to the west. Rhyl is the largest town, and Ruthin is the administrative centre. Its borders differ from the historic county of the same name.

Denbighshire has an area of and a population of 95,800, making it sparsely populated. The most populous area is the coast, where Rhyl and Prestatyn form a single built-up area with a population of 46,267. The next-largest towns are Denbigh, Ruthin, and Rhuddlan, while St Asaph is its only city. All of these settlements are in the northern half of the county; the south is even less densely populated, and the only towns are Corwen and Llangollen.

The geography of Denbighshire is defined by the broad valley of the River Clwyd, which is surrounded by rolling hills on all sides except the north, where it reaches the coast. The Vale of Clwyd, the lower valley, is given over to crops, while cattle and sheep graze the uplands. The Clwydian Range in the east is part of the Clwydian Range and Dee Valley Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty.

This part of Wales contains the country&#x27;s oldest known evidence of habitation – Pontnewydd (Bontnewydd-Llanelwy) Palaeolithic site has Neanderthal remains of some 225,000 years ago. The county is also home to several medieval castles, including Castell Dinas Brân, Denbigh, and Rhuddlan, as well as St Asaph Cathedral. Llangollen International Musical Eisteddfod takes place in the town each July.

==Formation==
The main area was formed on 1 April 1996 under the Local Government (Wales) Act 1994, from various parts of the county of Clwyd. It includes the district of Rhuddlan (formed in 1974 entirely from Flintshire), the communities of Trefnant and Cefn Meiriadog from the district of Colwyn (entirely Denbighshire) and most of the Glyndŵr district. The last includes the former Edeyrnion Rural District, part of the administrative county of Merionethshire before 1974, covering the parishes of Betws Gwerfil Goch, Corwen, Gwyddelwern, Llangar, Llandrillo yn Edeirnion and Llansanffraid.

Other principal areas including part of historical Denbighshire are Conwy, which picked up the remainder of 1974–1996 Colwyn, the Denbighshire parts of 1974–1996 Aberconwy, and Wrexham, which corresponds to the pre-1974 borough of Wrexham along with most of Wrexham Rural District and several parishes of Glyndŵr. Post-1996 Powys includes the historically Denbighshire parishes of Llanrhaeadr-ym-Mochnant, Llansilin and Llangedwyn, which formed part of Glyndŵr district.

==Early history==
Researchers have found signs that Denbighshire was inhabited at least 225,000 years ago. Bontnewydd Palaeolithic site is one of the most significant in Britain. Hominid remains of probable Neanderthals have been found, along with stone tools from the later Middle Pleistocene.

===Archaeology===
In 2021 February, archaeologists from Aeon Archaeology announced a discovery of over 300 Stone Age tools and artifacts in Rhuddlan. They revealed scrapers, microliths, flakes of chert (a hard, fine-grained, sedimentary rock composed of microcrystalline or cryptocrystalline quartz), flints and other rudimentary tools. An expert, Richard Cooke, believes the lithic remains belonged to ancient peoples, who while passing through the area, made camp by the river more than 9,000 years ago.

==Geography==
:&quot;See also List of places in Denbighshire.&quot;
The eastern edge of Denbighshire follows the ridge of the Clwydian Range, with a steep escarpment to the west and a high point at Moel Famau (), which with the upper Dee Valley forms an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, the Clwydian Range and Dee Valley – one of just five in the Wales. The Denbigh Moors (Mynydd Hiraethog) are in the west of the county and the Berwyn Range adjacent to the southern edge. The River Clwyd has a broad fertile Vale running from south–north in the centre of the county. There is a narrow coastal plain in the north which much residential and holiday-trade development. The highest point in the historic county was Cadair Berwyn at ), but the boundary changes since 1974 make Cadair Berwyn North Top the highest point. Denbighshire borders the present-day principal areas of Gwynedd, Conwy County Borough, Flintshire, Wrexham County Borough, and Powys.

Rhyl and Prestatyn form a single built-up area in the north of the county, with a population of 46,267. They are immediately adjacent to the Kinmel Bay and Abergele built-up area in neighbouring Conwy, and at the eastern end of series of coastal resorts which that also includes Colwyn Bay and Llandudno further west.

==Population==
According to the 2021 United Kingdom census, Denbighshire&#x27;s population was approximately 95,800. According to previous censuses, the population of Denbighshire was 93,734 in 2011 and 93,065 in 2001. The largest towns on the coast are Rhyl (2001 population c. 25,000) and Prestatyn (2001 population c. 18,000). According to the 2011 Census returns, 24.6 per cent stated they could speak Welsh.

==Economy==
Since the 20th-century demise of the coal and steel industries in the Wrexham area, there is no heavy industry in the county. Although most towns have small industrial parks or estates for light industry, the economy is based on agriculture and tourism. Much of the working population is employed in the service sector. The uplands support sheep and beef cattle rearing, while in the Vale of Clwyd dairy farming and wheat and barley crops predominate. Many towns have livestock markets and farming supports farm machinery merchants, vets, feed merchants, contractors and other ancillaries. With their incomes on the decline, farmers have found opportunities in tourism, rural crafts, specialist food shops, farmers&#x27; markets and value-added food products.

The upland areas with their sheep farms and small, stone-walled fields are attractive to visitors. Redundant farm buildings are often converted into self-catering accommodation, while many farmhouses supply bed and breakfast. The travel trade began with the arrival of the coast railway in the mid-19th century, opening up the area to Merseyside. This led to a boom in seaside guest houses. More recently, caravan sites and holiday villages have thrived and ownership of holiday homes increased. Initiatives to boost the economy of North Wales continue, including redevelopment of the Rhyl seafront and funfair.

==Transport==
The North Wales Coast Line running from Crewe to Holyhead is served by Transport for Wales and Avanti West Coast services. Trains leaving Crewe to pass through Chester, cross the River Dee into Wales, and continue through Flint, Shotton, Holywell Junction (closed in 1966), Prestatyn, Rhyl, and stations to Bangor and Holyhead, which has a ferry service to Ireland.

There are no motorways in Denbighshire. The A55 dual carriageway runs from Chester through St Asaph to the North Wales coast at Abergele, then parallel to the railway through Conwy and Bangor to Holyhead. The A548 run from Chester to Abergele through Deeside and along the coast, before leaving the coast and terminating at Llanrwst. The main road from London, the A5, passes north-westwards through Llangollen, Corwen and Betws-y-Coed to join the A55 and terminate at Bangor. The A543 crosses the Denbigh Moors from south-east to north-west, and the A525 links Ruthin with St Asaph.

There are local bus services between the main towns. Several services by Arriva Buses Wales run along the main coast road between Chester and Holyhead, linking the coastal resorts. Another route links Rhyl to Denbigh.

==Politics==

Denbighshire was last represented in the House of Commons by three MPs. The Welsh Labour Party lost to the Welsh Conservatives in the 2019 general election for the first time.

The following MPs were elected from Denbighshire in 2019:
*Simon Baynes (Welsh Conservatives) in Clwyd South, first elected in 2019.
*David Jones (Welsh Conservatives) in Clwyd West, first elected in 2005.
*James Davies (Welsh Conservatives) in Vale of Clwyd, first elected in 2019.
From 2024, Denbighshire is covered by four constituencies. These are Bangor Aberconwy, Clwyd North, Clwyd East and Dwyfor Meirionnydd.

Denbighshire is also represented in the Senedd by three members elected in 2021:
*Ken Skates (Welsh Labour) in Clwyd South, first elected in 2011
*Darren Millar (Welsh Conservatives) in Clwyd West, first elected in 2007
