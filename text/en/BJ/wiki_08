<text>Mário Alberto Nobre Lopes Soares (; 7 December 1924 – 7 January 2017) was a Portuguese politician, who served as prime minister of Portugal from 1976 to 1978 and from 1983 to 1985, and subsequently as the 17th president of Portugal from 1986 to 1996. He was the first secretary-general of the Socialist Party, from its foundation in 1973 to 1986. A major political figure in Portugal, he is considered the father of Portuguese democracy.

==Family==
Soares was the son of João Lopes Soares (Leiria, Arrabal, 17 November 1879 – Lisbon, Campo Grande, 31 July 1970), founder of the Colégio Moderno in Lisbon, government minister and then anti-fascist republican activist who had been a priest before impregnating and marrying Elisa Nobre Baptista (Santarém, Pernes, 8 September 1887 – Lisbon, Campo Grande, 28 February 1955), Mário Soares&#x27;s mother, at the 7th Conservatory of the Civil Register of Lisbon on 5 September 1934. His father also had another son by an unknown mother named Tertuliano Lopes Soares. His mother had previously been married and had two children, J. Nobre Baptista and Cândido Nobre Baptista. Mário Soares was raised as a Roman Catholic, but came to identify himself as a republican, secular and socialist.

==Early life==
Soares was born in the Coração de Jesus neighbourhood of Lisbon, and graduated in history and philosophy from the University of Lisbon. He became a university lecturer in 1957, but his activities in opposition to the dictatorship of António de Oliveira Salazar led to repeated arrests. He was active in resistance groups such as the Movement for Anti-Fascist National Unity and the Movement for Democratic Unity.

Soares began his studies at Colégio Moderno, owned by his father. There, for a short period he was taught geography by Álvaro Cunhal, who would later become the towering figure of Portuguese Communism and one of Soares&#x27; greatest political rivals.

While a student at university, Soares joined the Portuguese Communist Party, being responsible for the youth section. In this capacity, he organised demonstrations in Lisbon to celebrate the end of World War II. He was first arrested by PIDE, the Portuguese political police, in 1946, when he was a member of the Central Committee of the Movement of Democratic Unity (), at the time chaired by . Soares was arrested twice in 1949. On those latter occasions, he was the secretary of General Norton de Matos, a candidate for the Presidency. However, he became estranged from de Matos when the latter discovered Soares&#x27;s Communist sympathies.

Soares married Maria de Jesus Barroso Soares, an actress, on 22 February 1949, while in the Aljube prison, at the Third Conservatory of the Civil Register of Lisbon. They had a son, João Soares, who later became Mayor of Lisbon, and a daughter, Isabel Barroso Soares (born in 1951), who now manages the Colégio Moderno.

Soares&#x27;s multiple arrests for political activism made it impossible for him to continue with his career as a lecturer of history and philosophy. Therefore, he decided to study law and become an attorney.

==Political activity during the &quot;Estado Novo&quot;==
In 1958, Soares was very active in the presidential election supporting General Humberto Delgado. Later, he would become Delgado&#x27;s family lawyer, when Humberto Delgado was murdered in 1965, in Spain, by agents of the dictatorship&#x27;s secret police (PIDE). As a lawyer, he defended some of Portugal&#x27;s political prisoners and participated in numerous trials conducted in the Plenary Court and in the Special Military Court. Represented, particularly, Álvaro Cunhal when he was accused of several political crimes, and along with Adelino da Palma Carlos he also defended the dynastic cause of Maria Pia of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha Braganza.

In April 1964, in Geneva, Switzerland, Soares together with Francisco Ramos da Costa and Manuel Tito de Morais created the &quot;Acção Socialista Portuguesa&quot; (Portuguese Socialist Action). At this point he was already quite distant from his former Communist friends (having quit the Communist Party in 1951); his views were now clearly inclined towards economic liberalism.

In March 1968, Soares was arrested again by PIDE, and a military tribunal sentenced him to banishment in the colony of São Tomé and Principe in the Gulf of Guinea. His wife and two children, Isabel and João, accompanied him. However, they returned to Lisbon eight months later for in the meantime dictator Salazar had been replaced by Marcello Caetano. The new dictator wanted to present a more democratic face to the world, so many political prisoners, Soares among them, were released and allowed exile in France.

In the October 1969 general election, which was rigged, the democratic opposition (whose political rights were severely restricted) entered with two different lists. Soares participated actively in the campaign supporting the &quot;Coligação Eleitoral de Unidade Democrática&quot; or CEUD (Electoral Coalition for Democratic Unity). CEUD was clearly anti-fascist, but they also reaffirmed their opposition to Communism.

In 1970, Soares was exiled to Rome, Italy, but eventually settled in France where he taught at the Universities of Vincennes, Paris and Rennes. In 1973, the &#x27;Portuguese Socialist Action&#x27; became the Socialist Party, and Soares was elected Secretary-General. The Socialist party was created under the umbrella of Willy Brandt&#x27;s SPD in Bad Münstereifel, Germany, on 19 April 1973.

==Carnation Revolution==
On 25 April 1974, elements of the Portuguese Army seized power in Lisbon, overthrowing Salazar&#x27;s successor, Marcello Caetano. Soares and other political exiles returned home to celebrate what was termed the &quot;Carnation Revolution&quot;.

In the provisional government which was formed after the revolution, led by the Movement of the Armed Forces (MFA), Soares became minister for overseas negotiations, charged with organising the independence of Portugal&#x27;s overseas colonies. Among other encounters, he met with Samora Machel, the leader of Frelimo, to negotiate the independence of Mozambique.
Within months of the revolution however (and in spite of the April 1975 Constituent Assembly election results which gave victory to the Socialist Party and clearly favored the pro-democracy political parties), it became apparent that the Portuguese Communist Party, allied with a radical group of officers in the MFA, was attempting to extend its control over the government. The prime minister, Vasco dos Santos Gonçalves, was accused of being an agent of the Communists and a bitter confrontation developed between the Socialists and Communists over control of the newspaper &quot;República&quot;.

President Francisco da Costa Gomes dismissed Vasco Gonçalves in September 1975 and a failed far-left coup in late November ended the far-left influence in Portuguese government and politics. After the approval of the 1976 Constitution, a democratic government was finally established when national elections were held on 25 April 1976.

==Prime minister==
The 1976 legislative election gave the Socialists a plurality of seats in the newly created Assembly of the Republic and Soares became prime minister. Deep hostility between the Socialists and the Communists made a left-wing majority government impossible, and Soares formed a weak minority government. Vast fiscal and currency account deficits generated by previous governments forced Soares to adopt a strict austerity policy, which made him deeply unpopular. Soares had to resign from office after only two years, in 1978.

The wave of left-wing sentiment which followed the 1974 revolution had now dissipated, and a succession of conservative governments held office until 1983, with Soares&#x27; Socialist Party unsuccessful in the 1979 special elections and 1980 elections. Soares again became prime minister following the 1983 elections, holding office until late 1985. His main achievement in office was negotiating Portugal&#x27;s entry into the European Economic Community. Portugal at the time was very wary of integrating itself into the EEC, and Soares almost single-handedly turned public opinion around.

==Presidency==

In the 1986 presidential election, Soares was elected president of Portugal, beating Diogo Freitas do Amaral by little more than 2%. He was reelected in 1991, this time with almost 70% of the vote. For most of Soares&#x27; two terms of office, Portugal was governed by the centre-right Social Democratic Party, led by Aníbal Cavaco Silva.

In 1989, he was the first foreign head of state to visit Czechoslovakia in the course of the Velvet Revolution, invited by Václav Havel, who was elected president of Czechoslovakia two days later.

He devised the so-called &quot;Presidência Aberta&quot; (Open Presidency), a series of tours around the country, each addressing a particular issue, such as the environment or a particular region of Portugal. Although generally well received by the public, some claimed that he was criticizing the government and exceeding his constitutional role. Others stated that the tours were in the style of medieval courts. Yet the name stuck for today&#x27;s presidential initiatives of the same type.

==Post-Presidency==
*Soares retired in 1996, but in 1998 he headed the Independent World Commission on the Oceans.
*In 1999 he headed the Socialist ticket in elections to the European Parliament, where he served until the 2004 elections. He ran for President of the Parliament, but lost to Nicole Fontaine.
*In 2000 he was awarded the North-South Prize.
*Soares was a member of the Club de Madrid, an independent organization of more than 80 former democratic statesmen from around the world. The group works to strengthen democratic governance and leadership.
*In March 2005, he launched a petition urging the European Union to start membership talks with Cape Verde.
*On 30 August 2005, he announced his candidacy to run for president in the election that occurred on 22 January 2006, when he was 81 years old. However, he lost the election to Aníbal Cavaco Silva and was even behind Manuel Alegre, receiving 14% of the vote. &quot;The results went against my expectations. I accept this defeat with a feeling of mission accomplished,&quot; he said. It was suggested (on the RTP1 TV programme &quot;Prós e Contras&quot; in March 2008) that one of the reasons for his weak support could be that the Portuguese were reluctant to elect any president for more than two terms (only allowed by the Portuguese Constitution of 1976 if non-consecutive).

* In the TV programme &quot;Os Grandes Portugueses&quot; (English: The Greatest Portuguese), he was voted 12th, the highest-placed among living people chosen by the public. 
* He was a member of the strongest Masonic lodge in Portugal.
* He was president of the then ( (FMS)).
* He sat on the board of directors of the ().
* He was a Member of the Portuguese Council of State, as a former elected president of Portugal.
*After the Finnish general elections on 17 April 2011, Soares opined that &quot;Finland has changed into an extremely conservative country, where solidarity is unknown.&quot; Soares evoked the memory of Kalevi Sorsa, contrasting his generosity with &quot;those dwarfs, who now want to rule Finland, their ethical values and hostility to Portugal&quot;. According to Soares the Finns live in an illusion, believing that &quot;speculative markets and credit criminals can destroy nations with nine hundred years&#x27; independent history&quot;.

==Death and state funeral==

Soares died on 7 January 2017 at the age of 92. He had been admitted to the hospital on 13 December, and although his condition at first showed slight signs of improvement, he lapsed into a coma on 26 December from which he never recovered. The Portuguese Government offered a state funeral and declared three days of national mourning. It was the first state funeral in Portugal after that of President Óscar Carmona in 1951. After lying in state at Jerónimos Monastery during 9 January, his remains were transported to Prazeres Cemetery the next day, and now lie at the family vault next to those of his wife.

<text>Pussy () is a small village and a delegated commune of La Léchère in the Savoie &quot;département&quot; of France. It is situated on the eastern slope of Mont Bellachat above the left bank of the Isère, 9 km (5.5 mi.) northwest of Moûtiers. The name derives from &quot;Pusiacum&quot;, based on the Roman personal name &quot;Pussius&quot;, which refers to the owner of the place in the Roman era.

The village boundary covers 18 km2 (6.8 mile²). The local church, dedicated to Saint John the Baptist, was rebuilt in 1669. In 1561 the population was recorded as 1455 people, 548 in 1776, and 276 in 1979. Pussy and several other small villages were merged into the new commune of La Léchère for administrative purposes in 1972.

<doc id="357452" wikidata="Q3427423" url="?curid=357452" title="Induced representation">
<text>In group theory, the induced representation is a representation of a group, , which is constructed using a known representation of a subgroup . Given a representation of &quot;,&quot; the induced representation is, in a sense, the &quot;most general&quot; representation of that extends the given one. Since it is often easier to find representations of the smaller group than of &quot;,&quot; the operation of forming induced representations is an important tool to construct new representations&quot;.&quot;

Induced representations were initially defined by Frobenius, for linear representations of finite groups. The idea is by no means limited to the case of finite groups, but the theory in that case is particularly well-behaved.

==Constructions==

===Algebraic===

Let be a finite group and any subgroup of . Furthermore let be a representation of . Let be the index of in and let be a full set of representatives in of the left cosets in . The induced representation can be thought of as acting on the following space:

:formula_1

Here each is an isomorphic copy of the vector space &quot;V&quot; whose elements are written as with . For each &quot;g&quot; in and each &quot;gi&quot; there is an &quot;hi&quot; in and &quot;j&quot;(&quot;i&quot;) in {1, ..., &quot;n&quot;} such that . (This is just another way of saying that is a full set of representatives.) Via the induced representation acts on as follows:

:formula_2

where formula_3 for each &quot;i&quot;.

Alternatively, one can construct induced representations by extension of scalars: any &quot;K-&quot;linear representation formula_4 of the group &quot;H&quot; can be viewed as a module &quot;V&quot; over the group ring &quot;K&quot;[&quot;H&quot;]. We can then define

:formula_5

This latter formula can also be used to define for any group and subgroup , without requiring any finiteness.

====Examples====
For any group, the induced representation of the trivial representation of the trivial subgroup is the right regular representation. More generally the induced representation of the trivial representation of any subgroup is the permutation representation on the cosets of that subgroup.

An induced representation of a one dimensional representation is called a monomial representation, because it can be represented as monomial matrices. Some groups have the property that all of their irreducible representations are monomial, the so-called monomial groups.

====Properties====
If is a subgroup of the group , then every -linear representation of can be viewed as a -linear representation of ; this is known as the restriction of to and denoted by . In the case of finite groups and finite-dimensional representations, the Frobenius reciprocity theorem states that, given representations of and of , the space of -equivariant linear maps from to has the same dimension over &quot;K&quot; as that of -equivariant linear maps from to .

The universal property of the induced representation, which is also valid for infinite groups, is equivalent to the adjunction asserted in the reciprocity theorem. If formula_6 is a representation of &quot;H&quot; and formula_7 is the representation of &quot;G&quot; induced by formula_8, then there exists a -equivariant linear map formula_9 with the following property: given any representation of and -equivariant linear map formula_10, there is a unique -equivariant linear map formula_11 with formula_12. In other words, formula_13 is the unique map making the following diagram commute:

The Frobenius formula states that if is the character of the representation , given by , then the character of the induced representation is given by

: formula_14

where the sum is taken over a system of representatives of the left cosets of in and

:formula_15

===Analytic===
If is a locally compact topological group (possibly infinite) and is a closed subgroup then there is a common analytic construction of the induced representation. Let be a continuous unitary representation of into a Hilbert space &quot;V&quot;. We can then let:

:formula_16

Here means: the space &quot;G&quot;/&quot;H&quot; carries a suitable invariant measure, and since the norm of is constant on each left coset of &quot;H&quot;, we can integrate the square of these norms over &quot;G&quot;/&quot;H&quot; and obtain a finite result. The group acts on the induced representation space by translation, that is, for &quot;g,x&quot;∈&quot;G&quot; and .

This construction is often modified in various ways to fit the applications needed. A common version is called normalized induction and usually uses the same notation. The definition of the representation space is as follows:

:formula_17

Here are the modular functions of and respectively. With the addition of the &quot;normalizing&quot; factors this induction functor takes unitary representations to unitary representations.

One other variation on induction is called compact induction. This is just standard induction restricted to functions with compact support. Formally it is denoted by ind and defined as:

:formula_18

Note that if is compact then Ind and ind are the same functor.

===Geometric===
Suppose is a topological group and is a closed subgroup of . Also, suppose is a representation of over the vector space . Then acts on the product as follows:
:formula_19
where and are elements of and is an element of .

Define on the equivalence relation

:formula_20

Denote the equivalence class of formula_21 by formula_22. Note that this equivalence relation is invariant under the action of ; consequently, acts on . The latter is a vector bundle over the quotient space with as the structure group and as the fiber. Let be the space of sections formula_23 of this vector bundle. This is the vector space underlying the induced representation formula_24. The group acts on a section formula_23 given by formula_26 as follows:
:formula_27

=== Systems of imprimitivity ===
In the case of unitary representations of locally compact groups, the induction construction can be formulated in terms of systems of imprimitivity.

In Lie theory, an extremely important example is parabolic induction: inducing representations of a reductive group from representations of its parabolic subgroups. This leads, via the philosophy of cusp forms, to the Langlands program.

<doc id="357457" wikidata="Q641600" url="?curid=357457" title="Japanese Communist Party">
<text>The is a communist party in Japan. Founded in 1922, it is the oldest political party in the country. It has 250,000 members as of January 2024, making it one of the largest non-governing communist parties in the world. The party is chaired by Tomoko Tamura, who replaced longtime leader Kazuo Shii in January 2024.

The JCP, founded in 1922 in consultation with the Comintern, was deemed illegal in 1925 and repressed for the next 30 years, engaging in underground activity. After World War II, the party was legalized in 1945 by the Allied occupation authorities, but its unexpected success in the 1949 general election led to the &quot;Red Purge&quot;, in which tens of thousands of actual and suspected communists were fired from their jobs in government, education, and industry. The Soviet Union encouraged the JCP to respond with a violent revolution, and the resulting internal debate fractured the party into several factions. The dominant faction, backed by the Soviets, waged an unsuccessful guerrilla campaign in rural areas, which undercut the party&#x27;s public support.

In 1958, Kenji Miyamoto became the JCP&#x27;s leader and moderated the party&#x27;s policies, abandoning the previous line of violent revolution. Miyamoto also began distancing the JCP from the Eastern Bloc in the 1960s. The party maintained a neutral stance during the Sino-Soviet split, declared its support for multi-party democracy in opposition to the one-party politics of China and the Soviet Union, and purged pro-Soviet or Chinese members. His efforts to regain electoral support were particularly successful in urban areas such as Osaka, Kyoto, and Tokyo, and the JCP worked with the Japan Socialist Party (JSP) in the 1970s to elect a number of progressive mayors and governors. By 1979, the JCP held about 10% of the seats in the National Diet. The party saw a brief electoral resurgence after the collapse of the JSP in 1996; however, the party has generally been in decline since in terms of electoral results and party membership.

The party at present advocates the establishment of a democratic society based on pacificism. It believes that this objective can be achieved by working within an electoral framework while carrying out an extra-parliamentary struggle against &quot;imperialism and its subordinate ally, monopoly capital&quot;. As such, the JCP does not advocate violent revolution but rather a &quot;democratic revolution&quot; to achieve &quot;democratic change in politics and the economy&quot;. It accepts the current constitutional position of the emperor but opposes the involvement of the Imperial House in politics. A staunchly anti-militarist party, the JCP firmly supports Article 9 of the Japanese Constitution and seeks to dissolve the Japan Self-Defense Forces. It opposes Japan&#x27;s military alliance with the United States as an unequal relationship and infringement of Japan&#x27;s national sovereignty.

==History==

===Foundation===
Sanzō Nosaka became a communist in the late 1910s and was a founding member of the Communist Party of Great Britain. Sen Katayama left Japan for the United States in 1914, after serving a prison sentence for supporting a strike. He became a communist during his time in the country and was a founding member of the Communist Party USA. Katayama founded the Association of Japanese Socialists in America and served as chair of the Far Eastern People&#x27;s Congress.

In 1921, Katayama was informed by the Communist International (Comintern) that the First Congress of the Toiler of the Far East would be held on 21 January 1922 in Irkutsk. Three men from his organization (Watanabe Haruo, Taguchi Unzo, and Maniwa Suekichi) served as delegates. The Japanese Communist Party was founded in Tokyo on 15 July 1922, at a meeting where Kyuichi Tokuda discussed sessions held between the Japanese delegation and Comintern officials. Two delegates were sent to the 4th World Congress of the Communist International and a general meeting of the party was held in Ichikawa, Chiba, on 4 February 1923.

The party&#x27;s early leadership was drawn from the anarcho-syndicalist and Christian socialist movements that developed around the turn of the century. From the former came Hitoshi Yamakawa, Sakai Toshihiko, and Kanson Arahata, who had all been supporters of Kōtoku Shūsui, an anarchist executed in 1911. Katayama, another early party leader, had been a Christian socialist for much of his political life. The three former anarchists were reluctant to found the JCP, with Yamakawa shortly after arguing that Japan was not ready for a communist party and calling for work to be done solely within labor unions. Katayama&#x27;s theoretical understanding of Marxism also remained low. In the aftermath of the 1923 Great Kanto Earthquake, there was a campaign of rumors instigated by Japanese state authorities that incited widespread massacres of suspected enemies of the state by military, police, and vigilante forces. Military and police officials assassinated key leftist leaders under the cover of martial law, including Ōsugi Sakae.

===Outlawed and persecuted===

In May 1923, a roster of the JCP&#x27;s membership was found by police at Manabu Sano&#x27;s quarters at Waseda University. A series of protests were occurring at the university about military training. On 5 June, almost every member of the party, except those in rural areas or outside the country, were arrested. A group of Japanese communists, including Arahata, assembled in Vladivostok in August, and decided to create a proletarian party. Those members arrested in 1923, and released in 1924 believed that the conditions for a communist party were not present and decided to dissolve the party at the Morigasaki Conference in March. However, Grigori Voitinsky rejected this and ordered them to reestablish the party. In August, a committee with Tokuda as chair was formed to reestablish the party. Masanosuke Watanabe and Sano held positions in this committee and Arahata was an organizer in the Kansai region. The JCP was formally reestablished on 4 December 1926. Fukumoto Kazuo, a rising figure in Japanese communism, was a member and his ideology, Fukumotoism, was a main part of the platform.

The JCP was outlawed in 1925 with the passage of the Peace Preservation Law, the JCP was subjected to repression and persecution by the Special Higher Police (&quot;Tokkō&quot;), nicknamed the &quot;Thought Police&quot;. JCP members and sympathizers were imprisoned and pressured to &quot;convert&quot; (&quot;tenkō suru&quot;) to anti-communist nationalism. Many of those who refused to convert remained imprisoned for the duration of the Pacific War. The Japanese Communist Party member Hotsumi Ozaki, who was part of the Richard Sorge spy ring for the Kremlin, was the only Japanese person hanged for treason under the Peace Preservation Law. Police also widely used methods of torture against arrested communists. One of the JCP members killed by police torture in this period was the writer Kobayashi Takiji.

Hyōgikai was formed on 25 May 1925, and this union served as a vehicle for the communist party. Other proletariat parties (Japan Farmers Party, Japan Labour-Farmer Party, Social Democratic Party, and Labour-Farmer Party) were formed during this period. These parties won seven seats in the 1928 election, but a crackdown on 15 March resulted in 1,200 people, including Communist leaders, being arrested and the Japanese government dissolved Hyōgikai and Labour-Farmer Party. Sano, Watanabe, Shoichi Ichikawa, Kenzō Yamamoto, and Hideo Namba avoided arrest as they were serving as representatives to the 6th World Congress of the Communist International and reorganized the party. The Labour-Farmer Party was reconstituted, with opposition from the Comintern-affiliated communists, into the Proletarian Masses Party with Mosaburō Suzuki as Secretary General. An attempt to reform Hyōgikai resulted in arrests so a new organization, the National Council of Japanese Labor Unions (Zenkyō), was formed as an underground group with 5,500 members on 25 December 1928.

Police found a chart of the JCP&#x27;s district organization in Tokyo after arresting a prominent member on 18 March 1929. This resulted in mass arrests that left Yamamoto, who was sick in Moscow, as one of the few leaders not in prison. 81 high-ranking members of Zenkyō were arrested in April. The party was reconstituted by Seigen Tanaka, Zenshirō Zennō, and Hiroshi Sano in July. Many members wanted to dissolve the party as the Peace Preservation Law was amended to inflict the death penalty. Jōkichi Kazama was sent from Moscow to rebuild the party in December 1930. He and Noboru Matsumura wrote the 1931 Draft Thesis, but the Comintern was displeased with it. A new document supported by the Comintern, the 1932 Draft Thesis, was written by Nosaka and served as the JCP&#x27;s main document until 1946. This document stated that a bourgeois revolution to eliminate feudalism and the emperor must occur before the proletariat revolution.

In 1932, Japanese authorities raided a meeting of members of the Japanese Communist Party in Atami. According to a March 1933 article on the raid, the accused were not the &quot;rag-tag-and-bobtail&quot; of the people. Only a very small minority of the accused were laborers. Almost all the accused were of the &quot;better classes&quot;. Among the accused were two judges, two professors of universities, lawyers, teachers, and students. Professor S.H Roberts of the University of Sydney reported in a 1934 newspaper that &quot;all Japan was stirred when it was realized that only a minority of prisoners were laborers.&quot; In addition, the arrested were also accused of being connected to the Omori Bank Robbery.

Kazama and other leaders were arrested in fall 1932. The party was reformed by Masami Yamamoto, who was also sent from Moscow, in January 1933, but he was arrested in May. Manabu Sano, Kazama, Tanaka, and other imprisoned Communist leaders denounced communism starting in May. The leadership of the party&#x27;s central committee passed from Eitaro Noro to Kenji Miyamoto to Hakamada Satomi as a result of each person&#x27;s arrests. The party lost its organization after Satomi&#x27;s arrested in 1935.

The JCP campaigned against the invasion of China and the imperial regime&#x27;s expansionist policy in Asia. Following the outbreak of the 1931 Japanese invasion of Manchuria, the Japanese Communist Party had infiltrated the military, including in Tokyo, and Osaka. They would distribute leaflets and newspapers opposing the war.

===Postwar reemergence===
On 4 October 1945, all political prisoners, including communists that had been imprisoned for decades, were ordered to be released by the Allied military occupation of Japan. The first issue of &quot;Shimbun Akahata&quot; after the end of the war thanked the Allied occupation for the &quot;democratic revolution&quot; that was occurring and called for the recreation of a communist political party. A national conference was held on 8 November 1945, and the 4th Party Congress was held from 1 to 2 December.

According to Jacobin, the JCP, unlike the French, and Italian communists, emerged into the postwar period without an organizational base established through wartime resistance movements. As a result, the postwar JCP relied heavily on support of Korean activists in Japan. Of the roughly one thousand supporters who gathered in Western Tokyo to greet party members who had emerged from prison on 10 October 1945, half or more were Korean.

Nosaka returned to Japan after fourteen years in exile on 10 January 1946. Under the guidance of Nosaka, the party pursued a policy of portraying itself as &quot;lovable&quot;. Nosaka&#x27;s strategy involved avoiding open calls for violent revolution and taking advantage of the seemingly pro-labor stance of the Allied occupation to organize the urban working classes and win power at the ballot box and through propaganda. In particular, the party was successful in winning acceptance of the notion that communists had been the only ones to resist Japanese wartime militarism. This propaganda effort won the party thousands of new members and an even larger number of sympathizers, especially among artists and intellectuals.

Party membership, which never exceeded 1,000 in the pre-war period, rose from 1,180 in December 1945, to 7,500 by February 1946, 70,000 by December 1947, and over 100,000 by April 1950. Sanbetsu, a union affiliated with the JCP, had around 1.5 million members as overall Japanese union membership rose to 6 million in the post-war period. The JCP benefited from Japan&#x27;s Korean population that was more favorable to communism due to discrimination and high unemployment rates. The JCP made dramatic gains in the 1949 general election, tripling its popular vote support and increasing its seat total from 4 to 35.

===Red Purge and turn to violence===
Beginning in the fall of 1949, in reaction to the JCP&#x27;s electoral success and as part of the &quot;Reverse Course&quot; in Allied occupation policy amid rising Cold War tensions, the Allied occupation authorities and the Japanese government carried out a sweeping Red Purge, firing tens of thousands of communists and suspected communists from government posts, teaching positions at schools, and private corporations. The purge was further intensified in response to the outbreak of the Korean War.

Douglas MacArthur considered banning the JCP on 3 May 1950. Twenty-four members of the party&#x27;s central committee were removed from office on 6 June and its newspaper, &quot;Shimbun Akahata&quot;, was suspended on 27 June. A total of 11,000 workers and 1,200 government workers were fired from 1949 to 1950. Union divisions and attacks on communist influence in labor led to Sanbetsu&#x27;s membership falling to 400,000 by 1949.

Against this backdrop in January 1950, the Soviet-led Cominform, at the behest of Soviet premier Joseph Stalin, issued a blistering criticism of the JCP&#x27;s peaceful line as &quot;opportunism&quot; and &quot;glorifying American imperialism&quot;. It also demanded that the JCP carry out an immediate violent revolution along Maoist lines. This devastating &quot;Cominform Criticism&quot; led rival JCP factions to compete for the Cominform&#x27;s approval, and ultimately led to the militant which declared that &quot;it would be a serious mistake to think that Japan&#x27;s liberation can be achieved through peaceful, democratic means&quot; and called for an immediate violent revolution. This thesis was a combination of late Stalinist and Maoist thought. The result was a campaign of violence in which JCP activists threw Molotov cocktails at police boxes and cadres were sent up into the mountains with instructions to organize ostensibly oppressed farmers into &quot;mountain guerrilla squads&quot;.

The backlash to the JCP&#x27;s new militant line was swift and severe. Militants were rounded up, tried, and sentenced to lengthy prison terms, and in the 1952 general election, Japanese voters vented their ire at the JCP by stripping the party of every single one of its 35 Diet seats, a blow from which it would take two decades to recover. Stunned, the JCP gradually began to pull back from its militant line, a process facilitated by the death of Stalin in 1953. At the 6th Party Congress in 1955, the JCP renounced the militant line completely, returning to its old &quot;peaceful line&quot; of gradually pursuing socialist revolution through peaceful, democratic means.

 and were informally controlling the JCP in the early 1950s. Tokuda&#x27;s death in 1953 created a power vacuum in the party. Shida won and Itō was expelled from the party, having been accused of being a spy. Shida&#x27;s influence waned in the late 1950s as Miyamoto, who became General Secretary in 1958, gained power. Members of Shida&#x27;s faction later broke away to from a new JCP in September 1965. This group performed poorly in elections despite support from the Soviet Union.

===Anpo protests===
In 1960, the JCP played a central role in organizing the massive Anpo protests against the U.S.–Japan Security Treaty, which were the largest protests in Japanese history. The JCP took a different line than the Japan Socialist Party, Sohyo labor federation, and other groups who argued that the main target of the protest movement was Japanese monopoly capitalism. Instead, the JCP argued that the main enemy was American imperialism, and along with affiliated groups, focused its protests around the U.S. Embassy in Tokyo. Accordingly, JCP-linked groups were the driving force behind the &quot;Hagerty Incident&quot; in which the car carrying U.S. President Eisenhower&#x27;s press secretary James Hagerty was mobbed outside of Tokyo&#x27;s Haneda Airport on 10 June 1960, provoking a major international incident and helping to precipitate the downfall of the Nobusuke Kishi cabinet.

The Anpo protests were a turning point in the JCP&#x27;s ongoing attempts to revive its political fortunes after the disastrous turn toward violent revolution in the early 1950s. Although the Maoists had been purged from the party following the earlier disaster, the JCP was still riven by the age-old rivalry between the Rōnō Ha (Worker-Farmer Faction) and the Kōza Ha (Lecture Faction), which dated back to the prewar era. Among other disagreements, the two factions disagreed over which stage of Marxist development Japan was currently in; the Rōnō Ha believed that Japan had already achieved full capitalism, which meant that an immediate socialist revolution was possible, whereas the Kōza Ha argued that Japan&#x27;s transition to capitalism was not yet complete and that therefore what was needed was a &quot;two-stage&quot; revolutionfirst a &quot;democratic revolution&quot; that would overthrow American imperialism and establish true democracy, and then a &quot;socialist revolution&quot; that would establish communism. Although the &quot;mainstream&quot; of the JCP, led by Kenji Miyamoto, favored the Kōza Ha interpretation, as late as the 7th Party Congress in 1958 the &quot;anti-mainstream&quot; Rōnō Ha faction, led by Shōjirō Kasuga, still controlled around 40% of the delegates.

The Anpo protests greatly strengthened the hand of the Kōza Ha faction. During the protest, the JCP, still scarred by the backlash to its violent line in the 1950s, consistently advocated peaceful, orderly, and restrained protests. This stance was highly unpopular with the radical student activists of the Zengakuren student federation, who broke decisively with the JCP as a result and began to build a New Left student movement. However, the movement proved unpopular with the broader public, and the JCP was able to use its image as a &quot;peaceful&quot; and &quot;positive&quot; force during the protests as a recruitment tool. Membership in the party soared during the course of the protests, doubling from 40,000 to 80,000, and most of the new recruits wound up supporting the Kōza Ha line.

===Zenith===
Over the remainder of the 1960s, the Kōza Ha was able to purge many members from the Rōnō Ha faction, and others, dissatisfied with JCP policies, quit the party of their own accord. Miyamoto was able to cement his control over the party and reigned as party chairman all the way until 1982. Meanwhile, the party&#x27;s membership continued to grow rapidly, and the party began to make steady gains at the ballot box, winning more and more seats in the National Diet. By the mid-1960s, the United States Department of State estimated party membership to be approximately 120,000 (0.2% of the working-age population), Miyamoto reported a membership above 100,000 in 1964, and the party had acquired around 300,000 members by 1970.

The JCP&#x27;s vote totals in the prefectural assemblies doubled between the 1959 and 1963 elections and their seats rose from 12 to 22 despite running 200 fewer candidates. The JCP&#x27;s vote totals and seats in city council elections rose from 509,069 to 880,991 votes and 218 to 369 seats. Their vote totals in the town council elections doubled and their seats rose from 168 to 314.

In the 1972 general election, the JCP won an astonishing 38 seats in the Diet, surpassing its 1949 high of 35 and signaling the party&#x27;s full recovery from the disastrous militant line of the early 1950s. Party membership continued to grow in the 1970s, albeit at a slower rate than in the 1960s, reaching approximately 500,000 members by 1980.

===1980s to 21st century===
After the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the JCP released a press statement titled &quot;We welcome the end of a party which embodied the historical evil of great power chauvinism and hegemonism&quot;. The party also criticized the Eastern Bloc countries which abandoned socialism, describing their decisions as a &quot;reversal of history&quot;. Consequently, the party did not suffer an internal crisis as a result of the Soviet Union&#x27;s collapse in 1991, nor did it consider disbanding or changing its name. However, owing to a significant loss in electoral support, the party revised its policies in the 1990s and became a more traditional democratic socialist party.

Lam Peng Er argued in the &quot;Pacific Affairs&quot; in 1996 that &quot;the JCP&#x27;s viability is crucial to the health of Japanese democracy&quot; because &quot;[i]t is the only established party in parliament that has not been coopted by the conservative parties. It performs the watchdog role against the ruling parties without fear or favor. More importantly, the JCP often offers the only opposition candidate in prefectural governorship, city mayoral and other local elections. Despite the ostensible differences between the non-communist parties at the national level, they often support a joint candidate for governor or mayor so that all parties are assured of being part of the ruling coalition. If the JCP did not offer a candidate, there would be a walkover and Japanese voters would be offered a fait accompli without an electoral avenue of protest. Promoting women candidates in elections to win women&#x27;s votes is another characteristic of the party. More women are elected under the communist label than other political parties in Japan.&quot;

In 2008, foreign media recorded an increase in support for the party due to the effect of the global financial crisis on Japanese workers. However, the party failed to increase its number of seats in the 2009 general election. Subsequently, the projected decline of the party was halted, with the JCP becoming the third-largest party in the Tokyo Metropolitan Assembly and making gains in the House of Councillors, going from six to 11 seats. The party surged in the 2014 elections, receiving 7,040,130 votes (13.3%) in the constituency section and 6,062,962 (11.37%) in the party lists.

During the nomination period of the July 2016 House of Councillors election, the party signed an agreement with the Democratic, Social Democratic and People&#x27;s Life parties to field a jointly endorsed candidate in each of the 32 districts in which only one seat was contested, uniting in an attempt to take control of the House from the LDP–Komeito coalition. JCP leaders expressed willingness to enter into a coalition with the Democratic Party, a notion which was rejected by then-Democratic Party President Katsuya Okada as being &quot;impossible&quot; in the near future due to what he viewed as some of the &quot;extreme leftist policies&quot; promoted by the JCP. The party had three Councillors up for re-election and fielded a total of 56 candidates in the election, down from 63 candidates in the 2013 election, but still the second-highest number after the LDP. However, only 14 of those candidates contested single- and multi-member districts, while 42 contested the 48-seat national proportional representation block.

Councillor Tomoko Tamura was appointed as the party&#x27;s first chairwoman on 18 January 2024, replacing Kazuo Shii who had occupied the role for over 23 years.

==Ideology and policies==
The JCP is one of the largest non-governing communist parties in the world; it is, however, politically moderate and advocates a peaceful transition to communism. Marxism–Leninism, which former party chairman Tetsuzo Fuwa had worked for years to make acceptable to the electorate, was abandoned in favor of scientific socialism in 1976. According to the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot;, the JCP became a more traditional democratic socialist party after modifying its policies in the 1990s. This analysis is supported by the Japanese political scientist , who is often cited as a specialist on the JCP. The JCP follows a Marxist ideology, stating that the theory of Marx and Engels is the foundation of their program. The party sits on the left to far-left of the left–right political spectrum.

===Economic policy===
The JCP strives to change the nation&#x27;s economic policy of what it views as serving the interests of large corporations and banks to one of &quot;defending the interests of the people&quot;. It advocates establishing &quot;democratic rules&quot; that will check the activities of large corporations and &quot;protect the lives and basic rights of the people&quot;.

Regarding the international economy, the JCP has advocated establishing a new international democratic economic order on the basis of respect for each country&#x27;s economic sovereignty. The party strongly opposed Japan&#x27;s consideration of the failed Trans-Pacific Partnership. The JCP views the United States, transnational corporations, and international financial capital as the main pushers of globalization, which it asserts is negatively affecting the global economy by further widening the North–South economic divide and creating irrevocable environmental problems. The JCP advocates the &quot;democratic regulation of activities by transnational corporations and international financial capital on an international scale&quot;.

In September 2015, after the passage of the 2015 Japanese military legislation, the JCP called for cooperation from other opposition parties to form an interim government to abolish the bills. It was the first time the party had called for such cooperation with other parties.

===Social policy===
The JCP is generally regarded as the most progressive party in Japanese politics. The JCP has traditionally been opposed to the existence of the Imperial House since its inception. However, the party changed its stance in 2004 by acknowledging the Emperor as Japan&#x27;s head of state. The JCP has stated that it supports the establishment of a democratic republic, but also that &quot;[the monarchy&#x27;s] continuation or discontinuation should be decided by the will of the majority of the people in future, when the time is ripe to do so&quot;. In 2000, the party opposed legislation which reintroduced two symbolic practices to secondary school graduation ceremonies in Japan, namely the raising of the national flag and the singing of the national anthem, both of which the party views as relics of Japan&#x27;s militarist past.

====LGBT rights and feminism====
The JCP has been one of the political parties to vocally back LGBTQ+ rights in the country; communist lawmakers have been working to win the passage of same-sex marriage and anti-discrimination laws in parliament. The JCP jointly supports the passing of an LGBT equality law with the Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan (CDP), the Social Democratic Party (SDP), and Reiwa Shinsengumi.

The JCP has maintained a friendly relationship with the Japanese feminist camp since its inception, and is still the most active in women&#x27;s rights issues among Japan&#x27;s major political parties. The JCP was the first party to call for universal suffrage for women. The party supports eliminating the wage gap between men and women and has called for the participation of more women in Japanese politics and political life.

===Foreign policy===
One of the JCP&#x27;s main objectives is terminating the Japan–United States military alliance and the dismantling of all American military bases in Japan, with a goal to make Japan a non-aligned and neutral country, in accordance with its principles of self-determination and national sovereignty. There are about 130 American military bases and related facilities in Japan, with Okinawa Prefecture alone hosting more than half of United States Forces Japan personnel. The JCP adheres to the idea that Japan, as an Asian country, must not allow its relationship with the United States and the G8 to define its foreign relations and should put its East Asian neighbors at the center of its diplomatic efforts. It supports establishing an &quot;independent foreign policy in the interests of the Japanese people&quot; and rejects &quot;uncritically following any foreign power&quot;.

The JCP advocates that Japan issue further apologies for its actions during World War II and has condemned prime ministerial visits to Yasukuni Shrine. In the 1930s, while the JCP was still illegal, it was the only political party to vocally oppose Japan&#x27;s war with China. The JCP supports Japanese territorial claims over the Kuril and Senkaku Islands and Liancourt Rocks. Furthermore, the JCP has condemned North Korea&#x27;s nuclear-weapons testing, calling for effective sanctions, but opposing the prospect of a military response.

The JCP&#x27;s leading politicians are known to be the most active opponents of anti-Korean racism and xenophobia in Japan. Contemporary JCP politicians criticize mainstream Japanese politicians for instigating contempt towards Korea, and oppose historical revisionism in regard to Korean history and Japanese war crimes. The JCP was one of the few Japanese parties which supported the Korean independence movement. In the latter half of the 1940s, a training school for Korean revolutionaries was operated jointly by the JCP and several Korean organizations, including the Communist Party of Korea. In South Korea, the JCP is known as the only &quot;pro-South Korea&quot; political party in Japan. Although it is illegal to form a communist party in South Korea, &quot;Mindan&quot; maintains friendly relations with the JCP. In 2003, due to the consideration of the then liberal South Korean president Roh Moo-hyun, formal exchanges between the JCP and the South Korean government began.

====Pacifism====
The JCP has traditionally championed pacifism. With regards to the Japan Self-Defense Forces (Japan&#x27;s armed forces), the JCP&#x27;s current policy is that it is not principally opposed to its existence (in 2000 the party stated that it would agree to its use should Japan ever be attacked), but that it will seek to abolish it in the long term, international situation permitting. The JCP opposes the possession of nuclear weapons by any country, military blocs, and attempts to revise Article 9 of the Japanese Constitution, which says that &quot;never again... [will Japan] be visited with the horrors of war through the action of government&quot;. Regarding the resolution of disputes, it argues that priority must be given to peaceful means through negotiations, not to military solutions. The JCP says that Japan must adhere to the United Nations Charter.

====China and the Soviet Union====
The JCP took a neutral stance during the Sino-Soviet split and Miyamoto believed that it was unnecessary for the JCP to take a side. A pro-Chinese faction under the leadership of Hakamada Satomi and pro-Soviet faction under the leadership of Yoshio Shiga and Shigeo Kamiyama existed within the JCP. However, both groups were in the minority compared to the neutral faction.

Another pro-Soviet faction of the party was under the leadership of Shōjirō Kasuga. Kasuga&#x27;s faction formed the Preparatory Commission for a Socialist Reform Movement on 9 October 1961. This group broke away on 3 May 1962, and formed the Unified Socialist League with 600 members. Relations between the Soviet Union and JCP soured as the Soviets attempted to court the JSP. Shiga and were expelled from the party for voting in favor of the Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty in 1963. Shiga and Suzuki were praised in Soviet publications, including &quot;Pravda&quot;. The publication of &quot;Shimbun Akahata&quot; faced restrictions in the Soviet Union while Shiga&#x27;s &quot;Voice of Japan&quot; did not.

The JCP supported China during the Sino-Indian War. Miyamoto announced the JCP&#x27;s opposition to the 1968 Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia. At the same time, the party had distanced itself from Mao and Maoism, which allowed it to avoid being associated with China&#x27;s Great Leap Forward and Cultural Revolution once they started coming more fully to light in the 1970s. In July 1969, the JCP declared that if it ever came to power, it would permit the free functioning of opposition parties, in an effort to distinguish itself from the one-party states in the Soviet Union and China. A purge of pro-Chinese elements in the JCP, including Tokuda&#x27;s son Nishizawa Ryūji from the Central Committee, was conducted in 1966. In 1976, mentions of &quot;Marxism–Leninism&quot; in the party program were changed to &quot;scientific socialism&quot;.

In 2020, the JCP revised its platform for the first time since 2004. The new platform criticized the Chinese Communist Party, denouncing China&#x27;s &quot;great-power chauvinism and hegemonism&quot; as &quot;an adverse current to world peace and progress&quot;. The JCP also removed a line from its platform which described China as a country &quot;that is beginning a new quest for socialism&quot;. JCP members have stated that this was due to human rights conditions in China. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China denounced the accusations of the JCP as &quot;groundless and biased&quot;.

==Organization==
The party officially upholds democratic centralism. The party constitutions states decisions &quot;shall be based on democratic discussion and finally decided by majority vote&quot; and that &quot;there shall be no factions or splinter groups&quot;. Along with Komeito, the JCP is unique amongst major Japanese political parties for the continuity of its leaders, with Shii having served as JCP chairman from 2000 to 2024.

===Central organization===
According to the party constitution, the highest body of the JCP is the Party Congress, organized by the Central Committee every 2–3 years, though it may be postponed in special circumstances. Between the congresses, the highest body is the Central Committee, elected by the Party Congress. The Central Committee meets two times every year and can also hold a plenum at the request of one-third of its membership. The Central Committee is made out of regular and alternate members; the latter can participate in Central Committee meetings but cannot vote. The Central Committee also elects the executive committee of the Central Committee, and its chairpersons and vice-chairpersons, the head of the Secretariat. The current chairman of the executive committee of the Central Committee of the JCP is Tomoko Tamura. The Central Committee also appoints the Disciplinary Commission and the Audit Commission, and may elect a Central Committee chairperson; the current Central Committee chair is Kazuo Shii.

The executive committee manages party affairs between Central Committee meetings. It appoints the members of the Secretariat, which manages the day-to-day affairs of the party center, and the Central Organ Paper Editors Commission. It also elects the Standing Committee of the executive committee.

===Press===
&quot;Shimbun Akahata&quot; (Japanese: &quot;Red Flag Newspaper&quot;) is the daily organ of the JCP in the form of a national newspaper. &quot;Musansha Shinbun&quot; (Japanese: &quot;Proletarian News&quot;) was another publication of the party which was circulated between 1925 and 1929. Several other newspapers preceded and merged into &quot;Red Flag&quot;, including &quot;Daini Musansha Shinbun&quot; (Japanese: &quot;The Second Proletarian News&quot;), which was merged into &quot;Red Flag&quot; in 1932. &quot;Daini Musansha Shinbun&quot; was itself the immediate successor to the original &quot;The Proletarian News&quot;, which was banned by the government in September 1929. &quot;Daini Musansha Shinbun&quot; began publication immediately after the ban.

In the past, the party published numerous other newspapers as well, including another national paper called &quot;Nihon Seiji Shinbun&quot; (Japanese: &quot;Japan Political News&quot;) and a theoretical journal called &quot;Zenshin&quot; (Japanese: &quot;Forward&quot;). The party also published several regional newspapers such as &quot;Class War&quot; in and around Kyoto, Osaka and Kobe, &quot;Shinetsu Red Flag&quot; in Nagano and &quot;Hokkaido News&quot; in Hokkaido. They also published numerous (the exact number is unknown) factory newspapers.

Some regional newspapers, such as (Japanese: &quot;New Kanagawa&quot;) in Kanagawa, are still published.

===Affiliated organizations===
The youth wing of JCP is the Democratic Youth League of Japan. In the 1920s and 1930s, the organization published several newspapers of its own, including (English: &quot;Lenin Youth&quot;) and &quot;Proletarian Youth&quot;.

The party also has affiliate medical and consumer co-ops. The Japanese Consumers&#x27; Co-Operative Union (JCCU), the umbrella body of the co-operative movement in Japan, has a sizable number of communists in its ranks, although the exact numbers are difficult to verify. Another example of the JCP&#x27;s prevalence in the co-operative movement is the Co-op Kanagawa in the Kanagawa Prefecture, which has 800,000 members and has historical ties to the JCP. It still advertises and occasionally is published in JCP newspapers such as &quot;Red Flag&quot; and &quot;New Kanagawa&quot;. The prevalence of house unions in Japan as opposed to enterprise unions has prompted much of the exceptional development of other organizations by the JCP, as well as causing the JCP to seek other external organizational support, including from kōenkai.

The is a musical group which supports the JCP. Its repertory and artistic activity are strongly linked to / ), a musical movement of Japanese working class that dates back to 1948, when the was established. The group was founded in Kyoto in 2011 and is directed by Tadao Yamamoto, a composer, accordionist, choir director, and ordinary member of the National Council of The Singing Voice of Japan. In various cultural events organized by the party, the Choir of JCP-fans appears as an element among the joined choirs of the volunteer singers of The Singing Voice of Japan. As of 2016, the choir is the only organization of Japanese musicians specializing in political support and in the cultural activity of the party.

Notable concerts and performances by the choir include:
* 11 February 2011, Kyoto Kaikan Hall: Concert sponsored by the Kyoto Committee of the Japanese Communist Party (JCP).
* 1 August 2013, Nishijin Bunka Center (Kyoto): Cultural Live Revolutionary &quot;Pub&quot;, in collaboration with , former JCP member of the House of Councilors. 
* 23 September 2014, Takaragaike Park (Kyoto): Festival Kyoto ed. 2014, organized by the Kyoto Committee of the JCP.
* 1 February 2015, Kyoiku Bunka Center (Kyoto): Festival sponsored by the Kyoto Committee of the JCP.
* 29 April 2016, Takaragaike Park (Kyoto): Festival Kyoto ed. 2016, organized by the Kyoto Committee of the JCP: performance with and , JCP member of the House of Councilors and Secretary-General of the party.

==Membership==
44.09% of the JCP&#x27;s membership in 1966 was between the ages of 30–39, 27.50% were below 29, 15.21% were 40–49, 8.81% were above 50, and 3.74% were of an unknown age. The most common form of employment was in factory work, civil service, education, and agrarian work. During the 1980s, party membership began to decline, falling to 500,000 by 1990 and 370,000 by 1997.

Following its advancement in the 2013 Tokyo prefectural election, the party enjoyed an increase in membership growth, with over 1,000 people joining in each of the final three months of 2013. Approximately 20% of new members during this period were aged 20 to 40, showing a higher ratio of young people joining the party than in the past. The JCP had approximately 320,000 members in January 2014.

More recently, however, membership numbers have declined, with membership around 300,000 in 2017, 270,000 in 2020, and 250,000 in 2024.

===House of Representatives===
Prior to 1996, the entire House of Representatives was elected by majoritarian or &quot;semi-proportional&quot; voting systems with votes cast for individuals (1946: limited voting in multi-member districts, 1947 to 1993 SNTV in multi-member districts). Since 1996, the House of Representatives is elected in a parallel election system—essentially two separate elections only in the lower house complicated by the fact that a candidate may stand in both segments and the sekihairitsu system which ties proportional list ranking to FPTP results: only the majority of members the House of Representatives, 295 (initially 300) seats, are elected in a majoritarian system with voting for candidates (first-past-the-post in single-member districts), while the remaining 180 (initially 200) seats are elected by a proportional representation system (votes are cast for party lists in regional multi-member districts, called &quot;blocks&quot; in the House of Representatives). The votes and vote percentages in the table below are the JCP candidates&#x27; vote totals for the whole election from before 1993 and just the votes for the party in the election to the 180 proportional seats after 1996.

The JCP polled 11.3% of the vote in 2000, 8.2% in 2003, 7.3% in 2005, 7.0% in 2009, and 6.2% in 2012. These results seemed to indicate a trend of declining support, but the party won 21 seats in 2014, up from eight in the previous general election, as the JCP received 7,040,130 votes (13.3%) in the constituency section and 6,062,962 (11.37%) in the party lists. This continued a new wave of support that was also evident in the 2013 Tokyo prefectural election in which the party doubled its representation. Fighting on a platform directly opposed to neoliberalism, the Trans-Pacific Partnership, attempts to rewrite the constitution, United States Forces Japan, and nuclear power, the JCP tapped into a minority current that seeks an alternative to Japan&#x27;s rightward direction. Following the 2016 Japanese House of Councillors election, the party held 13 seats in the House of Councillors. After the 2017 Japanese general election, the party held 12 seats in the House of Representatives, and since the 2021 Japanese general election, it holds 10 seats.

===House of Councillors===
Elections to the House of Councillors are staggered. Every three years, half of the House is up for election to six-year terms. In addition, a parallel election system is used: the majority of members of the House of Councillors (currently 146 of 242, or 73 in one regular election to one half of the House) are elected in 45 (formerly 46→47) prefectural districts, votes are cast for individual candidates by SNTV, but with both multi- and single-member districts used and in the latter SNTV becomes identical to FPTP (winner-takes-all). The remaining, currently 96 members (48 per regular election) are elected in one nationwide district. Until 1980, votes there were cast for individuals too by SNTV. Since 1983, votes are cast for party lists and the seats are allocated proportionally (d&#x27;Hondt) in the nationwide district. Unlike in general elections to the lower house, a candidate may not be nominated in both segments of one regular election to the upper house. The seats totals show below are the JCP&#x27;s overall post-election seat totals, not just their seats elected in that particular year. The votes shown are the votes in the election for the 48 (formerly 50) seats in the nationwide SNTV/PR segment.

<text>The County of London was a county of England from 1889 to 1965, corresponding to the area known today as Inner London. It was created as part of the general introduction of elected county government in England, by way of the Local Government Act 1888. The Act created an administrative County of London, which included within its territory the City of London. However, the City of London and the County of London formed separate ceremonial counties for &quot;non-administrative&quot; purposes. The local authority for the county was the London County Council (LCC), which initially performed only a limited range of functions, but gained further powers during its 76-year existence. The LCC provided very few services within the City of London, where the ancient Corporation monopolised local governance. In 1900, the lower-tier civil parishes and district boards were replaced with 28 new metropolitan boroughs. The territory of the county was in 1961. During its existence, there was a long-term decline in population as more residents moved into the outer suburbs; there were periodic reviews of the local government structures in the greater London area and several failed attempts to expand the boundaries of the county. In 1965, the London Government Act 1963 replaced the county with the much larger Greater London administrative area.

==Geography==
The county occupied an area of just under and lay within the London Basin. It was divided into two parts (north and south) by the River Thames, which was the most significant geographical feature. It was bordered by the River Lea with Essex to the north-east, Kent to the south-east, Surrey the south-west and Middlesex to the north-west. The highest point was Hampstead Heath in the north of the county at , which is one of the highest points in London. In 1900 a number of boundary anomalies were abolished. These included the loss of the Alexandra Park exclave to Middlesex, gaining South Hornsey in return, and the transfer of Penge to Kent.

==History==

===Creation of the county===
The Metropolis Management Act 1855 revolutionised and amalgamated much of local government across an identical, newly formed, area. This reform created an indirectly elected Metropolitan Board of Works which initially built and maintained infrastructure for the metropolis, including modern sanitation. Over time the board gained more functions and became the de facto local authority and provider of new services for the London area. The board operated in those parts of the counties of Middlesex, Surrey and Kent that had been designated by the General Register Office as &quot;the Metropolis&quot; for the purposes of the Bills of Mortality. This area had been administered separately from the City of London, which came under the control of the Corporation of London.

There had been several attempts during the 19th century to reform London government, either by expanding the City of London to cover the whole of the metropolitan area; by creating a new county of London; or by creating ten municipal corporations matching the parliamentary boroughs of the metropolis. These had all been defeated in Parliament, in part because of the agency power of the City Corporation. Ultimately, the Local Government Act 1888 and the introduction of county councils in England provided the mechanism for creating a territory and authority encompassing the expanded London area. For expediency, the area of the metropolitan board was chosen for the new county, and no attempt was made to select new boundaries. This area had been out of line with the expansion of London even in 1855. For example, it anomalously omitted built-up and expanding areas such as West Ham, but included some sparsely populated areas on the metropolitan fringe.

The City of London and the County of London each formed counties for &quot;non-administrative&quot; purposes, with a separate Lord Lieutenant and High Sheriff for the county of London. However, the administrative county, which corresponded to the area of control of the county council, also included the City of London. In practice, the county council had very little authority over the ancient City, with some powers over drainage, roads, fire brigade, embankment of the river and flood prevention. In common with the rest of the country, the 1888 Act provided no reform of lower-tier authorities and the county was, initially at least, administered locally by a series of parish vestries and district boards.

===County council===

The local authority for the county was the London County Council (LCC). Initially, the LCC provided the services it had inherited from the Metropolitan Board of Works. Eventually, however, it absorbed functions from ad-hoc agencies such the London School Board and Metropolitan Asylums Board. The council was initially based in Spring Gardens, but moved to a purpose-built County Hall in the 1930s. The housing policy of the council included provision of large housing estates outside the boundaries of the county, such as that at Becontree.

===Local government===
In 1900, eleven years after its foundation, the London Government Act divided the County of London into 28 metropolitan boroughs. These replaced the ancient parish vestries and district boards as the second tier of local government.

County of London boroughs numbered in the information box on the right side:
† Not a metropolitan borough.

===Decline in population===
Population fell after World War I and as recorded at each census until its 1965 demise. In 1901, the population was 4.5 million and by 1961 it had fallen to 3.2 million. Following the 1931 census, more of the population of &quot;Greater London&quot; (defined at the time as the Metropolitan Police District and City of London) lived outside the county than in it. The following table illustrates the approximate population according to the census at various intervals:

†The City of London and the Metropolitan Boroughs of Bermondsey, Bethnal Green, Finsbury, Holborn, St Marylebone, St Pancras, Shoreditch, Southwark, Stepney and Westminster.

‡The Metropolitan Boroughs of Battersea, Chelsea, Islington, Kensington, Lambeth and Paddington.

§The Metropolitan Boroughs of Camberwell, Deptford, Fulham, Greenwich, Hackney, Hammersmith, Hampstead, Lewisham, Poplar, Stoke Newington, Wandsworth and Woolwich.

#Defined as the area of the Metropolitan Police district outside the County of London.

===Abolition===

The county of London was abolished in 1965 and was replaced by the fivefold-sized Greater London, which took in nearly all of Middlesex, along with areas in Surrey, Kent, Essex and Hertfordshire. Middlesex and Surrey had already been reduced in 1889 on the county&#x27;s creation. The area &quot;that had been&quot; has since been known statutorily as Inner London and an Inner London Education Authority operated in the area until 1990. The 28 metropolitan boroughs were merged to form 12 new Inner London boroughs.

<text>The Metropolitan Borough of Wandsworth was a Metropolitan borough under the London County Council, from 1900 to 1965.

==History==
The borough was formed from five civil parishes: Clapham, Putney, Streatham, Tooting Graveney and Wandsworth. In 1904, these five were combined into a single civil parish called Wandsworth Borough, which was conterminous with the metropolitan borough. Before 1900, these parishes, and Battersea until 1888, had been administered by the Wandsworth District Board of Works.

The borough had an irregular boundary with Mitcham in Surrey. On 1 April 1901 a small unpopulated exclave of Mitcham was transferred to Wandsworth. Part of the boundary followed the River Graveney, which had been culverted. On 1 April 1904 the boundary was straightened.

==Coat of arms==
The coat of arms were granted on 6 July 1901. The blue wavy division represents the Rivers Wandle and Thames. French Huguenot refugees arrived in the area in 1685, and the blue drops represent the tears of their struggle. The five stars represent the constituent former parishes. At the top is a long boat, with a dragon&#x27;s head, commemorating 9th century Danish incursions along the river. The borough council&#x27;s motto was &quot;We Serve&quot;. The arms can still be seen in the façade of Wandsworth Town Hall.

==Population and area==
The borough covered , which made it the largest in the County of London. The population recorded in the Census was:

Constituent parishes 1801–1899

Metropolitan Borough 1900–1961
==Politics==

The borough was divided into nine wards for elections: Balham, Clapham North, Clapham South, Fairfield, Putney, Southfield, Springfield, Streatham, and Tooting.

===Borough council===

===Parliament constituency===
For elections to Parliament, the borough was divided into one and a half constituencies:
*Clapham (also including part of the Metropolitan Borough of Battersea)
*Wandsworth
In 1918 the borough&#x27;s representation was increased to five seats:
*Balham and Tooting
*Clapham
*Putney
*Streatham
*Wandsworth Central
In 1950 the borough&#x27;s representation was reduced to four seats:
*Clapham
*Putney
*Streatham
*Wandsworth Central

==Replacement==
When the metropolitan boroughs were replaced with larger London boroughs in 1965, this borough was split. The core area of Wandsworth (about ) became part of the London Borough of Wandsworth, along with the former Metropolitan Borough of Battersea, but the areas of Streatham and Clapham (totalling ) became part of the London Borough of Lambeth.

<text>The Syslinux Project is a suite of five different bootloaders for starting up Linux distributions on computers. It was primarily developed by H. Peter Anvin.

==Components==
The Syslinux Project consists of five different bootloaders:

* The eponymous SYSLINUX, used for booting from the FAT filesystem
* ISOLINUX, used for booting from the ISO 9660 filesystem
* PXELINUX, used for booting from a network server using the Preboot Execution Environment (PXE) system
* EXTLINUX, used for booting from Btrfs, ext2, ext3, ext4, FAT, NTFS, UFS/UFS2, and XFS filesystems
* MEMDISK, emulates a RAM disk for older operating systems like MS-DOS

The project also includes two separate menu systems and a development environment for additional modules.

===SYSLINUX and ISOLINUX===
SYSLINUX was originally meant for rescue floppy disks, live USBs, or other lightweight environments. ISOLINUX is meant for live CDs and Linux installation CDs.

The SYSLINUX bootloader can be used to boot multiple distributions from a single source such as a USB stick.

A minor complication is involved when booting from compact discs. The El Torito standard allows booting in two different modes:

* &quot;No emulation&quot; Requires storing the boot information directly on the CD. ISOLINUX is suitable for this mode.
* &quot;Floppy emulation&quot; Requires storing the boot information in a disk image file suitable for emulating a FAT-formatted floppy disk. SYSLINUX is suitable for this mode.

To have this choice is sometimes useful, since ISOLINUX is vulnerable to BIOS bugs. For that reason, it is handy to be able to boot using SYSLINUX. This mostly affects computers built before about 1999, and, in fact, for modern computers the &quot;no emulation&quot; mode is generally the more reliable method. Since version 3.72 ISOLINUX supports the creation of so-called &quot;hybrid ISO&quot; images, that put both the &quot;El Torito&quot; boot record of the compact discs and the master boot record of hard disks into an ISO image . This hybrid image could then be written to both a compact disc or a USB flash drive.

===PXELINUX===
PXELINUX is used in conjunction with a PXE-compliant ROM on a network interface controller (NIC), which enables receiving a bootstrap program over the local area network. This bootstrap program loads and configures an operating system kernel that puts the user in control of the computer. Typically, PXELINUX is used for performing Linux installations from a central network server or for booting diskless workstations.

===EXTLINUX===
EXTLINUX is a general-purpose bootloader, similar to LILO or GRUB. Since Syslinux 4, EXTLINUX is capable of handling Btrfs, FAT, NTFS, UFS/UFS2, and XFS filesystems.

==COMBOOT==
SYSLINUX can be extended by COMBOOT modules written in C or assembly language. 32-bit modules typically use the codice_1 filename extension. Version 5 and later do not support 16-bit codice_2 modules.

===Hardware Detection Tool (HDT)===
Since the 3.74 release, the Syslinux project hosts the Hardware Detection Tool (HDT) project, licensed under the terms of GNU GPL. This tool is a 32-bit module that displays low-level information for any IA-32–compatible system. It provides both a command-line interface and a semi-graphical menu mode for browsing. HDT is also available as a bootable ISO and a 2.88 MB floppy disk image. The last update of HDT was in 2015; it has since been discontinued.

<doc id="357469" wikidata="Q180673" url="?curid=357469" title="Ceremonial counties of England">
<text>Ceremonial counties, formally known as &quot;counties for the purposes of the lieutenancies&quot;, are areas of England to which lord-lieutenants are appointed. They are one of the two main legal definitions of the counties of England in modern usage, the other being the counties for the purposes of local government legislation. A lord-lieutenant is the monarch&#x27;s representative in an area. Shrieval counties have the same boundaries and serve a similar purpose, being the areas to which high sheriffs are appointed. High sheriffs are the monarch&#x27;s judicial representative in an area. 

The ceremonial counties are defined in the Lieutenancies Act 1997, and the shrieval counties in the Sheriffs Act 1887. Both are defined as groups of local government counties.

== History ==
The historic counties of England were originally used as areas for administering justice and organising the militia, overseen by a sheriff. From Tudor times onwards a lord-lieutenant was appointed to oversee the militia, taking some of the sheriff&#x27;s functions.

Certain towns and cities were counties corporate, which gave them the right to appoint their own sheriffs and hold their own courts. Whilst in theory the counties corporate could have had separate lieutenants appointed for them, in practice all of them except London shared a lieutenant with the wider county from which they had been created. London had instead a commission of lieutenancy, headed by the Lord Mayor. The long-standing practice of appointing lieutenants jointly to the wider county and any counties corporate it contained was formalised by the Militia Act 1882.

Apart from the inclusion of the counties corporate, the counties for the purposes of lieutenancy generally corresponded to the judicial counties. The exception was Yorkshire, which was one judicial county, having a single Sheriff of Yorkshire, but from 1660 onwards each of Yorkshire&#x27;s three ridings had its own lieutenant.

In 1889 elected county councils were established under the Local Government Act 1888, taking over the administrative functions of the quarter sessions. Certain towns and cities were made county boroughs, independent from the county councils. In counties where the quarter sessions had been held separately for different parts of the county, such as the Parts of Lincolnshire, each part was given its own county council. The area administered by a county council was called an administrative county. As such, some of the judicial or lieutenancy counties comprised several administrative counties and county boroughs.

The Ordnance Survey adopted the term &#x27;geographical county&#x27; to describe the widest definition of the county. In most cases this was the lieutenancy county; the exceptions were Yorkshire, where the judicial county was larger on account of it being split into its three ridings for lieutenancy purposes, and the County of London where the administrative county was larger on account of the City of London and the rest of the county being separate for both judicial and lieutenancy purposes.
The counties lost their judicial functions in 1972, after which the main functions of the counties were the administrative functions of local government. Despite the loss of their functions, sheriffs continued to be appointed to the former judicial counties up until 1974.

In 1974, administrative counties and county boroughs were abolished, and a new system of metropolitan and non-metropolitan counties was introduced instead. Sheriffs were renamed &#x27;high sheriffs&#x27; and both they and the lieutenants were appointed to the new versions of the counties.

The counties of Avon, Cleveland and Humberside, each of which had only been created in 1974, were all abolished in 1996. They were divided into unitary authorities; legally these are also non-metropolitan counties. As part of these reforms, it was decided to define counties for the purposes of lieutenancy differently from the local government counties in some cases, effectively reverting to the pre-1974 arrangements for lieutenancies. Whereas the lieutenancies had been defined slightly differently from the shrieval counties prior to 1974, it was decided in 1996 that the high sheriffs and lieutenants should be appointed to the same areas. Regulations amending the Sheriffs Act 1887 and specifying the areas for the appointment of lieutenants were accordingly brought in with effect from 1 April 1996.

The regulations were then consolidated into the Lieutenancies Act 1997. When Herefordshire, Rutland and Worcestershire were re-established as local government counties in 1997 and 1998 no amendment was made to the 1997 Act regarding them, allowing them to also serve as their own lieutenancy areas. The lieutenancy counties have not changed in area since 1998, although the definitions of which local government counties are included in each lieutenancy have been amended to reflect new unitary authorities being created since 1997.

In legislation the lieutenancy areas are described as &#x27;counties for the purposes of the lieutenancies&#x27;; the informal term &#x27;ceremonial county&#x27; has come into usage for such areas, appearing in parliamentary debates as early as 1996.

== Shrieval counties ==

The shrieval counties are defined by the Sheriffs Act 1887 as amended, in a similar way to the lieutenancies defined by the Lieutenancies Act 1997. Each has a high sheriff appointed (except the City of London, which has two sheriffs).

== Definition ==
The Lieutenancies Act 1997 defines counties for the purposes of lieutenancies in terms of metropolitan and non-metropolitan counties (created by the Local Government Act 1972, as amended) as well as Greater London and the Isles of Scilly (which lie outside the 1972 Act&#x27;s system). Although the term is not used in the act, these counties are sometimes known as &quot;ceremonial counties&quot;. The counties are defined in Schedule 1, paragraphs 2–5 as amended (in 2009, 2019 and 2023). 

Generally, each time a new non-metropolitan county is created the 1997 Act is amended to redefine the existing areas of the lieutenancies in terms of the new areas. No such amendment was made in 1997 when Rutland was made a unitary authority or in 1998 when Herefordshire and Worcestershire were re-established; those three therefore have been given their own lieutenants again since the passing of the 1997 Act. The actual areas of the ceremonial counties have not changed since 1998.

=== Lieutenancy areas since 1998 ===
These are the 48 counties for the purposes of the lieutenancies in England, as currently defined:

==Geographical counties 1889–1974==

After the creation of county councils in 1889, there were counties for judicial and shrieval purposes, counties for lieutenancy purposes, and administrative counties and county boroughs for the purposes of local government. 

The 1888 Act used the term &#x27;entire county&#x27; to refer to the group of administrative counties and county boroughs created within each judicial county. The Ordnance Survey used the term &#x27;geographical county&#x27; to refer to this wider definition of the county.

Yorkshire had three lieutenancies, one for each riding, but was a single judicial county with one sheriff, and was counted as one geographical county by Ordnance Survey.

The counties lost their judicial functions in 1972 under the Courts Act 1971 which abolished the quarter sessions and assizes. Sheriffs continued to be appointed for each county despite the loss of the judicial functions. Certain towns and cities were counties corporate appointing their own sheriffs. The counties corporate were all included in a wider county for lieutenancy purposes, except the City of London which had its own lieutenants.

The geographical counties were relatively stable between 1889 and 1965. There were occasional boundary changes, notably following the Local Government Act 1894 which said that parishes and districts were no longer allowed to straddle county boundaries. After that most boundary changes were primarily to accommodate urban areas which were growing across county boundaries, such as when Caversham was transferred from Oxfordshire to Berkshire as a result of being absorbed into the County Borough of Reading in 1911.

The lieutenancies and judicial / shrieval counties were defined as groups of administrative counties and county boroughs, and so were automatically adjusted if the boundaries of those administrative areas changed. There were two exceptions to this rule (one only briefly). The county borough of Great Yarmouth straddled Norfolk and Suffolk for judicial and lieutenancy purposes until 1891 when it was placed entirely in Norfolk for those purposes. The county borough of Stockport straddled Cheshire and Lancashire for judicial and lieutenancy purposes - it was placed entirely in Lancashire for judicial purposes in 1956 but continued to straddle the two counties for lieutenancy purposes until 1974.

More significant changes to the geographical counties were made in 1965 with the creation of Greater London and of Huntingdon and Peterborough, which resulted in the abolition of the offices of Lord Lieutenant of Middlesex, Lord Lieutenant of the County of London, and Lord Lieutenant of Huntingdonshire and the creation of the Lord Lieutenant of Greater London and of the Lord Lieutenant of Huntingdon and Peterborough.

<text>In China, house churches or family churches () are Protestant assemblies in the People&#x27;s Republic of China that operate independently from the state-sanctioned Three-Self Patriotic Movement (TSPM) and China Christian Council (CCC). They represent a tradition of independent churches that would not come under the control of the Chinese Communist Party dating back to Wang Ming-Dao in the 1950s. However, they came into their current form of existence after the Cultural Revolution in the early-1980s.

== Terminology ==
While these groups are sometimes described as &quot;underground churches&quot; (), this term is generally associated with Catholic assemblies who have chosen to operate independently from the state-sanctioned Catholic Patriotic Association and the .

K. H. Ting, one of the key leaders of the TSPM and the CCC for many years, did not like the term &quot;house church&quot; and preferred to use the term &quot;house gathering&quot; (). This was because he found designations such as &quot;house church&quot; and &quot;official church&quot; as returning to the pre-Cultural Revolution practice of denominationalism.

Some scholars prefer to use terms such as &quot;unregistered church&quot; to speak about the Protestant phenomenon, because these groups can reach several hundred and do not always literally meet in someone&#x27;s home. Others suggest the need to discard the &quot;house church&quot; vs. &quot;TSPM church&quot; dichotomy as there is a lot that blurs these divisions, including the relationship between the two groups themselves.

Moreover, as a result of the rapid urbanization of China since the 1990s, there has been a growing development within urban Christianity. Some congregations have preferred to self-identify as being part of a &quot;third church&quot; to differentiate from both traditional house churches and TSPM churches.

==History==

In 1949, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) gained control of mainland China and established the People&#x27;s Republic of China (PRC). Shortly thereafter, well-known Christian leader Y. T. Wu authored and published &quot;The Christian Manifesto&quot;, which publicly supported the CCP&#x27;s policy of overseeing the church for the sake of national unity and progress and called on all Protestant Christians to follow suit. In the 1950s, Wu successfully oversaw the signing of &quot;The Christian Manifesto&quot; by roughly half of the Protestant population across China. He also played a key role in creating and leading the Three-Self Patriotic Movement (TSPM), a state-sanctioned governing body for Protestant Christianity in China. 

However, China&#x27;s independent churches, championed by Wang Ming-Dao, strongly resisted the TSPM both for its allegiance to a political entity and its liberal theological leanings. As a result of their refusal to join with the TSPM, an entire generation of China&#x27;s independent pastors were severely persecuted and their churches forced to close. These resistant churches often began meeting in undisclosed locations, such as individual homes or fields, thus gaining the name &quot;house church&quot;. Despite the TSPM&#x27;s efforts to maintain a good relationship with the CCP, it too was eventually dismantled and persecuted during the Cultural Revolution (19661976) so that all Christian practice in China became persecuted and hidden. During the period from the 1950s to 1970s, the strongest house church networks could be found in China&#x27;s countryside.

Due to the changes in religious policy after the end of the Cultural Revolution, in 1980, the Three-Self Patriotic Movement would be reinstated and the China Christian Council would be formed. Protestant congregations that wished to worship publicly registered with the TSPM, but those that did not would eventually be termed house churches.

Since the 1990s, a number of developments have resulted from the rapid urbanization experienced in Chinese society. While house churches originated as being quite independent of one another, a number of house church networks have developed, with some headquartered in Henan and Zhejiang provinces. These networks have sent missionaries all over the country and have even started sending them abroad to neighboring states.

The rapid urbanization has also resulted in migration to China&#x27;s urban centers and the rise of urban house churches.
 Some of these have developed through migrant worker communities and university students. Other new communities can be seen among urban intellectuals and entrepreneurs, the latter termed &quot;boss Christians&quot; ().

The house church has grown by some estimations to tens of millions of Christians. They had demonstrated national-level influence when Christians organized to provide relief to the deadly 2008 Sichuan earthquake, a disaster which the government was slow to handle. In 2018, the CCP began to introduce a series of new religious regulations. It closed Zion Church in Beijing and Early Rain Covenant Church in Chengdu, whose pastor, Wang Yi, was given a jail sentence of 9 years, the longest given to a pastor in several decades.

== Legality ==
House churches in China are generally considered illegal, yet smaller house churches of less than 25 members tend to be tolerated by the government. However, some have grown to a fairly large size, such as the Shouwang Church which reached 1,000 members at its height. House churches today still experience persecution, though the situation tends to differ depending on the region. American political scientist Carsten T. Vala argues that house churches are subject to persecution when they cross red lines, which include, apart from size, rapid growth, active proselytization, the attempt to form national networks, contacts with foreign Christian organization, and criticism of the government.

House churches are often reluctant to become official by joining the state-sanctioned Three-Self Patriotic Movement (TSPM). In addition to accepting the worrying institutional memory of government use of the TSPM to suppress churches during the 1950s, groups joining the TSPM would have to agree to limits on the time and location of religious activities, among other restrictions. Further, some Christians find certain TSPM teachings inconsistent with their personal faith. All churches submit to government monitoring as a condition of state approval; the government has direct oversight over TSPM congregations and can insist that Christians honor the government, in addition to traditional Christian theological teachings. Many Chinese Christians choose to attend house churches to practice their faith without government interference. 

Some house churches, however, submit their activities for government approval in an attempt to follow the law as closely as possible while remaining independent. In some instances, authorities have allowed such house churches to continue to operate. In others, officials have arrested pastors, congregants, and others affiliated with the targeted congregations, and have even gone so far as the destruction of buildings used for worship.

== Pentecostal characteristics ==
The first Pentecostal missionaries arrived in China shortly after the Azusa Street Revival as part of groups such as the Christian and Missionary Alliance, the China Inland Mission, the Pentecostal Missionary Union, and the Assemblies of God. These groups would also be instrumental in inspiring the creation of indigenous Pentecostal groups, such as the True Jesus Church and the Jesus Family.

Today, Chinese house churches are commonly described as being Pentecostal or charismatic. This is often the case due to the experience of miraculous healing. According to some surveys, 90% of converts to Protestant Christianity, in both house churches and TSPM churches, cite healing as a reason for their conversion.

However, a number of scholars have attempted to reconsider this description, using phrases such as &quot;Pentecostal-like&quot; or &quot;Pentecostal characteristics&quot; to indicate this ambiguity.

The Assemblies of God theologian Simon Chan argues that &quot;an adequate definition of Pentecostalism cannot be restricted to phenomenological description&quot; – that is, based on experiences. Chan continues to explain that classical Pentecostal beliefs such as Spirit-baptism and speaking in tongues are not prevalent in Chinese churches, when compared with miraculous healing.

Edmond Tang has pointed out that only a few groups, like the True Jesus Church and the Jesus Family, can trace themselves back to missionaries coming from Pentecostal denominations. Many of the Pentecostal characteristics in Chinese churches are seen to have parallels with Chinese folk religion, such as trances, ancestral worship, and the use of talismans. Some have described this as a folk religionization of Christianity.

Robert Menzies disputes these views, arguing, &quot;The common thread that unites Pentecostals in China with other Pentecostals around the world is their sense of connection with the apostolic church as reflected in the book of Acts.&quot;

The hymnal &quot;Canaan Hymns&quot;, rich in pneumatological themes, is widely used.

==Similar organization in other religions==
While foreign media often focus discussion about house churches mainly with relation to Protestantism, other religious traditions in China have chosen a similar form of organization. These include house assemblies of Han Chinese following Tibetan Buddhism, led by lamas and tulkus, Buddhist and Baháʼí Faith study groups, unregistered Zhengyi and vernacular forms of Taoism, and various folk religious groupings such as Yiguandao.

<text>Die Hard with a Vengeance is a 1995 American action thriller film directed by John McTiernan and written by Jonathan Hensleigh, which is based on the screenplay &quot;Simon Says&quot; by Hensleigh and the characters created by Roderick Thorp for his 1979 novel &quot;Nothing Lasts Forever&quot;. &quot;Die Hard with a Vengeance&quot; is the third film in the &quot;Die Hard&quot; film series after &quot;Die Hard 2&quot; and was later followed by &quot;Live Free or Die Hard&quot; and &quot;A Good Day to Die Hard&quot;.

The film stars Bruce Willis as NYPD Lieutenant John McClane and Samuel L. Jackson as McClane&#x27;s reluctant partner Zeus Carver. McClane and Carver team up to stop an East German terrorist group headed by &quot;Simon&quot; (Jeremy Irons), who have planted bombs across New York City and plot to steal the gold bullion of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. The film was released on May 19, 1995, and it initially received mixed reviews and became the highest-grossing film of the year.

== Plot ==
The Bonwit Teller department store in New York City is blown up by a bomb during the morning commute. A man identifying himself as &quot;Simon&quot; telephones the New York City Police Department (NYPD) and claims responsibility. Making demands in the form of a &#x27;Simon Says&#x27; game, he threatens to detonate another bomb unless Lt. John McClane is sent to Harlem wearing an intentionally provocative sandwich board. The NYPD comply and send McClane to Harlem, where he is confronted by an electrician and shop owner named Zeus Carver. McClane explains his situation before a group of gang members also confront McClane over his sign. Carver intervenes and saves McClane, and they escape in a taxi.

They arrive at 1 Police Plaza, where Simon demands that the pair follow a timed challenge or he will set off more bombs. They agree and McClane eventually boards the 3 train heading towards the Wall Street station in order to defuse a bomb that Simon planted on it. Carver arrives at the station before McClane finds the bomb and throws it on the tracks just as it explodes. McClane and Carver regroup with the NYPD and meet some FBI and CIA agents, who initially inform the pair that Simon is &quot;Peter Krieg&quot;, a mercenary and former colonel in the National People&#x27;s Army. They then reveal that Krieg&#x27;s real name is Simon Peter Gruber, the brother of Hans Gruber, who McClane killed years earlier in Los Angeles.

Simon then places another call to the NYPD, informing them that he has planted an explosive in one of the city&#x27;s elementary schools which is set to explode once class ends and can be triggered by the same radio frequencies utilized by law enforcement. Simon offers to give the authorities the school&#x27;s location if McClane and Carver follow another timed challenge, warning that he will detonate the explosive if any evacuation attempts are carried out. While the pair solve Simon&#x27;s next challenge, the NYPD begin to search all elementary schools in the city. McClane realizes that Simon is attempting to distract the NYPD away from Wall Street, which has no schools, and travels to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York Building. He discovers that Simon&#x27;s men have stolen $140 billion of gold bullion from its vault using dump trucks. He follows the trucks into the under-construction New York City Water Tunnel No. 3 while Carver continues Simon&#x27;s challenges.

Simon blows up a cofferdam to flood the tunnel, but McClane escapes and reunites with Carver. Surviving a car chase with Simon&#x27;s men, the pair find all the men were carrying exactly enough money to pay a bridge toll. The pair sneak aboard a tanker docked in the Long Island Sound, but Simon&#x27;s associates capture them and tie them up next to a bomb. Simon explains that his school threat was fake and broadcasts a message claiming that he is planning on destroying the tanker filled with the bullion to destabilize the Western world&#x27;s economy. After he leaves, Carver and McClane free themselves and escape the tanker just before the bomb detonates. As McClane and Carver are debriefed by the NYPD, McClane informs them that none of the bullion Simon&#x27;s men stole was in the tanker&#x27;s cargo hold, having deduced that Simon had intended to keep all of it for himself, using his knowledge of the Gruber family&#x27;s &quot;modus operandi&quot;.

While attempting to place a call to his estranged wife Holly, McClane glances at a bottle of aspirin given to him by Simon onboard the tanker and notices that it was purchased at a truck stop in Quebec on the Canada–United States border. McClane informs the NYPD of his discovery, and joins them and Carver as they rush towards a warehouse near the truck stop where Simon and his men are redistributing the bullion and planning their escape. The rest of Simon&#x27;s men are quickly apprehended by law enforcement personnel, though Simon and his girlfriend Katya attempt to escape in a helicopter, attacking McClane. McClane shoots at an overhead power line which falls onto the helicopter, causing it to crash and explode, killing Simon and Katya. While they are celebrating their triumph, Carver persuades McClane to place another call to Holly.

== Production ==
===Development and writing===
Like most of the films in the series, the premise of this film was repurposed from a stand-alone project. Various scripts were written for &quot;Die Hard 3&quot;; a number of them were ultimately rejected by Bruce Willis on the grounds that they felt like retreads of the action movies that came in the wake of the first film. One script, originally titled &quot;Troubleshooter&quot;, had McClane fighting terrorists on a Caribbean cruise line, but was rejected for being too similar to &quot;Under Siege&quot;. &quot;Troubleshooter&quot; was later repurposed for &quot;Speed 2: Cruise Control&quot;.

The script ultimately used was intended for a film entitled &quot;Simon Says&quot;, originally positioned as a Brandon Lee vehicle and the character of Zeus was written with an actress in mind, but the project was cancelled after Lee&#x27;s death during filming of &quot;The Crow&quot;. Warner Bros. bought the script and rewrote it as a &quot;Lethal Weapon&quot; sequel. Warner Bros. later put the script in turnaround, only to be purchased by 20th Century Fox and rewritten as a &quot;Die Hard&quot; film.

Andy Vajna replaced Joel Silver and Larry Gordon as the producer on the film due to a fall-out with Willis. As a result, Vajna&#x27;s company, Cinergi, acquired foreign rights to the film. In most regions, the film rights were acquired by Disney and Summit Entertainment, while Fox retained domestic and Japan rights. In July 1997, Cinergi sold its 50% stake in the film to Fox for $11.25 million.

=== Casting ===
Laurence Fishburne was originally offered the co-starring role of Zeus Carver, a part also written for him, but wanted a higher fee. Producer Andy Vajna held out on the deal. Fishburne had earlier turned down the role of Jules Winnfield in &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot;, which was eventually played by Samuel L. Jackson. Fishburne was talked out of playing Jules by his representatives who wanted him to only accept leading parts, otherwise he would be stuck career-wise as a supporting actor. Subsequently, &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; premiered at the Cannes Film Festival during the same time as Fishburne&#x27;s pay negotiations. Vajna also attended the event to support Willis who was appearing in the Quentin Tarantino film. Tarantino recalled that Vajna was so impressed by Jackson&#x27;s performance that he offered him the part of Carver instead. Fishburne later filed a lawsuit against Vajna&#x27;s company Cinergi for reneging on a verbal agreement. The lawsuit was settled before going to trial, with Fishburne receiving $750,000 and a guarantee that Cinergi would option a screenplay he had written.

==Music==

Michael Kamen returned to score the third film, again incorporating other material into his score (most notably &quot;When Johnny Comes Marching Home&quot;, not included on the soundtrack album). Excerpts from his scores for &quot;Die Hard&quot; and &quot;Die Hard 2&quot; were also included in the new film. The soundtrack was released by RCA Victor. In 2012, La-La Land Records released an expanded version of the soundtrack, containing music that Kamen had composed but went unused in the final film.

==Release==
===Theatrical===
Unlike its predecessors, &quot;Die Hard with a Vengeance&quot; did not take place during Christmas, instead being set during the late summer. It opened in theaters on May 19, 1995, five years after &quot;Die Hard 2&quot;. Despite concerns about the film portraying bomb threats and terrorism with the Oklahoma City bombing having occurred the previous month, the film was released as originally scheduled.

=== Home media ===
&quot;Die Hard with a Vengeance&quot; was released on VHS on December 19, 1995, in the United States by Fox Video with a THX-certified version, while it was released in international countries by Touchstone Home Entertainment and released in South Africa on VHS by Ster-Kinekor Home Video. It was then released on LaserDisc on January 17, 1996, and on DVD on March 9, 1999. A special edition was released on DVD on July 10, 2001, and then re-released in February 2005 and 2007. The film was released on Blu-ray in 2007 and 2013. A 4K release of the film has been made available for digital purchase on services such Apple TV, Amazon Video, and the Microsoft Store, plus free 4K streaming on select platforms such as Disney+.

==== Alternative ending ====
An alternative ending to the one shown in the final movie was filmed with Jeremy Irons and Bruce Willis, set some time after the events in New York. It can be found on the Special Edition DVD. In this version, it is presumed that the robbery succeeds, and that McClane was used as the scapegoat for everything that went wrong. He is fired from the NYPD after more than 20 years on the force and the FBI has even taken away his pension; it is also mentioned that McClane and his wife Holly have divorced. Nevertheless, he still manages to track Simon using the batch number on the bottle of aspirins and they meet in a bar in Hungary. In this version, Simon has double-crossed most of his accomplices, gotten the loot to a safe hiding place somewhere in Hungary, and has the gold turned into statuettes of the Empire State Building in order to smuggle it out of the country. McClane is keen to take his problems out on Simon, who he invites to play a game called &quot;McClane Says&quot;. This involves a form of Russian roulette with a small Chinese rocket launcher that has had the sights removed, meaning it is impossible to determine which end is which. McClane then asks Simon some riddles similar to the ones he played in New York. When Simon gets a riddle wrong, McClane forces him at gunpoint to fire the launcher, which fires the rocket through Simon, killing him.

In the DVD audio commentary, screenwriter Jonathan Hensleigh claims that this version was dropped because the studio thought it showed a more cruel and menacing side to McClane, a man who killed for revenge rather than in self-defense. The studio was also displeased with the lack of action in the scene, feeling that it did not fit as a &quot;climax&quot; and therefore chose to reshoot the finale as an action sequence at a significant monetary cost. Hensleigh&#x27;s intention was to show that the events in New York and the subsequent repercussions had tilted McClane psychologically. This alternative ending, set some time after the film&#x27;s main events, would have marked a serious break from the &quot;Die Hard&quot; formula, in which the plot unfolds over a period of roughly 12 hours.

According to the DVD audio commentary, a second alternative ending had McClane and Carver floating back to shore on a makeshift raft after the explosion at sea. Carver says it is a shame the bad guys are going to get away; McClane tells him not to be so sure. The scene then shifts to the boat where the terrorists find the briefcase bomb they left in the park and which Carver gave back to them (in this version it was not used to blow up the dam). The film would end on a darkly comic note as Simon asks if anyone has a four-gallon jug. This draft of the script was rejected early on – possibly due to the similarity of the ending to &quot;Die Hard 2&quot;, where all the villains board a plane that later explodes – so it was never actually filmed. The rocket-launcher sequence was the only alternative ending to be filmed.

== Reception ==
=== Box office ===
&quot;Die Hard with a Vengeance&quot; opened in the United States on May 19, 1995, and earned $22,162,245 in its opening weekend. The film ranked number one at the box office, beating &quot;Crimson Tide&quot;. In Japan, it set a record opening for 20th Century Fox with a five-day gross of $13.5 million, beating &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot; and ranking number one for five consecutive weeks, grossing over $81 million. Its opening in France set a summer record with a gross of $8.8 million in its first 8 days. The film went on to gross $100,012,499 in the United States and Canada, and $266,089,167 in other markets, giving it a total worldwide gross of $366,101,666 and making it the highest-grossing film of 1995.

=== Critical response ===
On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 60% based on 80 reviews, with an average rating of 6.20/10. The site&#x27;s critical consensus reads, &quot;&quot;Die Hard with a Vengeance&quot; gets off to a fast start and benefits from Bruce Willis and Samuel L. Jackson&#x27;s barbed interplay, but clatters to a bombastic finish in a vain effort to cover for an overall lack of fresh ideas.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a score of 58 out of 100, based on 19 critics, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;A−&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

Roger Ebert of &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; gave the film three stars out of four, praising the action sequences and the performances of Willis, Jackson, and Irons, concluding: &quot;&quot;Die Hard with a Vengeance&quot; is basically a wind-up action toy, cleverly made, and delivered with high energy. It delivers just what it advertises, with a vengeance.&quot; &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;″s Owen Gleiberman disliked the film, stating that while &quot;[John] McTiernan stages individual sequences with great finesse... they don&#x27;t add up to a taut, dread-ridden whole&quot;.

James Berardinelli thought that the explosions and fights were &quot;filmed with consummate skill, and are thrilling in their own right&quot;. Samuel L. Jackson&#x27;s performance in the film was also praised by critics. Desson Howe of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; thought that &quot;the best thing about the movie is the relationship between McClane and Zeus,&quot; saying that Jackson was &quot;almost as good as he was in &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot;.&quot; For &quot;Variety&quot;, Brian Lowry wrote the film was the &quot;least accomplished&quot; of the &quot;Die Hard&quot; series, but &quot;even a subpar adventure won&#x27;t kill this series, as the pic&#x27;s built-in audience will make it a major summer attraction, if perhaps one lacking quite the stamina of the first two movies&quot;.

&quot;Empire&quot; magazine&#x27;s Ian Nathan gave the film a three out of five stars review, stating that &quot;&quot;Die Hard with a Vengeance&quot; is better than &quot;Die Hard 2&quot;, but not as good as the peerless original. Though it&#x27;s breathless fun, the film runs out of steam in the last act. And Jeremy Irons&#x27; villain isn&#x27;t fit to tie Alan Rickman&#x27;s shoelaces.&quot;

In the &quot;Crime Time Filmbook&quot;, which archives various UK film reviews, the film was given a perfect 5-star review, citing it as &quot;...simply the best Action film of the decade, leaving imitators like &quot;Bad Boys&quot;, &quot;Executive Decision&quot;, &quot;The Rock&quot; and &quot;Chain Reaction&quot; in varying depths of shadow.

Retrospective rankings have called the film the best sequel in the franchise. &quot;Empire&quot; considered it to be one of the 50 greatest film sequels in 2009. Ben Sherlock of &quot;Screen Rant&quot; regarded it as the best sequel of the franchise. Johnny Hoffman from Movieweb considered it a step up from the previous film and praised Willis and Jackson&#x27;s chemistry and the action scenes.

<text>The Band Concert is a 1935 American animated short film produced in 3-strip Technicolor by Walt Disney Productions and released by United Artists. The 73rd short film in the Mickey Mouse series, it was the second release of the year, and notable as the first in the series to be produced in color.

Directed by Wilfred Jackson, with music adapted by Leigh Harline, the action follows a small music band, conducted by Mickey Mouse, which struggles through a distraction-filled public performance. Clarence Nash provides the voice of Donald Duck, the only speaking character. The film remains among the most highly acclaimed of the Disney shorts.

==Plot==
Mickey Mouse&#x27;s concert band is performing a concert in a park. As the film opens, they are being applauded for having just played music from Louis Joseph Ferdinand Hérold&#x27;s &quot;Zampa&quot;. They next begin Gioacchino Rossini&#x27;s &quot;William Tell&quot; overture.

Mickey&#x27;s performance is first disrupted by Peter Pig&#x27;s vibrato trumpet and Paddy Pig&#x27;s tuba playing &quot;Prelude: Dawn&quot; from the &quot;William Tell&quot; overture. Meanwhile, Donald Duck rolls a vendor cart through the audience selling popcorn, lemonade, peanuts, and ice cream, which further causes a distraction to Mickey.

While the band is playing the &quot;Finale&quot; segment, Donald plays &quot;Turkey in the Straw&quot; with a flute at the same tempo as the band. Overhearing Donald, the entire band absent-mindedly find themselves playing Donald&#x27;s song. Realizing his mistake, Mickey gets mad over his performance being disrupted in this manner and splits Donald&#x27;s flute in half, only for Donald to get another one out. They play the song once more and Donald is stopped by Mickey, who splits the flute again. The band resumes the segment and Donald pulls out a third flute and plays &quot;Turkey in the Straw&quot; again, but before Mickey can stop him again, Donald breaks the flute himself. An angry trombonist grabs Donald by the neck, shakes out several of his flutes and forces him off the stage, knocking him backwards into the vendor cart.

While Donald tries to play the song again, a bee harasses him. When the bee lands on Mickey&#x27;s hat, Donald throws ice cream at the bee, but it flies into Peter Pig&#x27;s trumpet; he shoots it out, accidentally hitting Mickey with it. The ice cream slides under Mickey&#x27;s uniform, making him shake around, causing the band to briefly play &quot;The Streets of Cairo&quot; until it falls out and he kicks it away. Mickey has the band play &quot;Ranz des Vaches&quot; and swats his baton at the bee, temporarily causing the band to briefly play notes more drastically different than the song. Percussionist Horace Horsecollar tries to kill the bee by squishing it with his cymbals and with a hammer, but accidentally hits Goofy&#x27;s head instead, driving his head down into his jacket. He continues playing his clarinet from inside it while Horace leaves in shame.

When the band comes to the &quot;Storm&quot; segment of the overture, it summons an actual tornado, prompting the audience and Donald to run away. The benches that the audience members were sitting on come to life (each wearing a hat that fell off an audience member) and also begin running for their lives as well. Donald tries to take shelter in some trees only for the tornado to tie them in knots with Donald in the middle. The tornado sucks up and destroys everything in its path, even the pavilion on which the band is playing, but the band is so used to distractions at this point that they continue to play from inside the tornado, in which Mickey floats through the remains of a wrecked house, Peter Pig gets spanked by a fence, and Clarabelle gets hit by a coat and an umbrella that turns her flute inside out. The tornado suddenly freezes when Mickey takes a pause conducting and goes in reverse as the band finishes the last part of the song. As the storm passes, the band is thrown into a tree and they finish the overture. By this time, the only remaining audience member is Donald Duck who applauds enthusiastically. Witnessing Donald playing &quot;Turkey in the Straw&quot; as an encore, the angry band members throw their instruments at him, which ends with a tuba being thrown on top of him. Donald&#x27;s hands appear out of the tuba&#x27;s blowpiece and plays a final flutter of notes.

==Reception==
&quot;The Band Concert&quot; has become one of the most highly acclaimed Disney short films. &quot;Esquire&quot; magazine cultural critic Gilbert Seldes wrote that &quot;[none of] dozens of works produced in America at the same time in all the other arts can stand comparison with this one.&quot; The Italian conductor Arturo Toscanini was such a fan of &quot;The Band Concert&quot; that he saw it six times in the theater and later invited Walt Disney to his home in Italy.

In &quot;The Disney Films&quot;, Leonard Maltin said that &quot;The Band Concert&quot; is &quot;one of the best cartoons ever made anywhere... There are nuances of expression in Mickey&#x27;s character throughout this film that had seldom been explored in earlier shorts. The pacing is also entirely different from the standard Mickey Mouse comedies of the early thirties. Instead of trying to pack in a thousand gags a minute, &quot;The Band Concert&quot; takes its time and builds to a crescendo.&quot;

&quot;The Band Concert&quot; was rated third in the 1994 book &quot;The 50 Greatest Cartoons&quot;, as rated by members of the field of animation. As a result, it was the highest-ranked Disney cartoon on the list, and the only one in the top 5 not produced by Warner Bros. Cartoons.

==Home media==
The short was released on December 4, 2001, on &quot;Walt Disney Treasures: Mickey Mouse in Living Color&quot;.

==Legacy==
According to Leonard Maltin, the 1942 &quot;Mickey Mouse&quot; film &quot;Symphony Hour&quot; was somewhat of a remake of &quot;The Band Concert&quot;.

In the 1942 wartime cartoon, &quot;All Together&quot;, Mickey and his whole band from the cartoon is seen in the parade.

In the video game &quot;Kingdom Hearts II&quot;, in the Garden area of Disney Castle, there is a topiary sculpture of all characters in the band besides Mickey, Donald, and Goofy.

&quot;The Band Concert&quot; serves as the basis for a projector level in the game &quot;Epic Mickey 2: The Power of Two&quot;.

&quot;The Band Concert&quot; was also the basis for, and title of the secret level in the game, &quot;Mickey Mania: The Timeless Adventures of Mickey Mouse&quot; (in the Sega Genesis/Mega Drive, Sega CD and PlayStation versions only).

&quot;The Band Concert&quot; is one of the parade units that was featured in the Tokyo Disneyland parade &quot;Disney on Parade: 100 Years of Magic&quot;, which depicts a large inflatable rendition of Mickey from the cartoon. It was later reused for Hong Kong Disneyland&#x27;s &quot;Disney on Parade&quot;.

This cartoon was also the inspiration for the Walt Disney World Resort Magic Kingdom show Mickey&#x27;s PhilharMagic.

The short was one of the many featured in &quot;Donald Duck&#x27;s 50th Birthday&quot;. Donald remembers it in a psychiatric session with Dr. Ludwig Von Drake and says that Mickey &quot;invited&quot; Donald to play with his band.

&quot;The Band Concert&quot; is the theme for the Silly Symphony Swings attraction at Disney California Adventure Park.

This cartoon was featured in &quot;Disney&#x27;s Magical Mirror Starring Mickey Mouse&quot;.

Mickey&#x27;s music stand and a drum are on display as props from the short in the queue of the Mickey &amp; Minnie&#x27;s Runaway Railway attraction at Disneyland.

<doc id="357479" wikidata="Q1506136" url="?curid=357479" title="World of Darkness">
<text>World of Darkness is a series of tabletop role-playing games, originally created by Mark Rein-Hagen for White Wolf Publishing. It began as an annual line of five games in 1991–1995, with &quot;&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;&quot;, and &quot;&quot;, along with off-shoots based on these. The series ended in 2004, and the reboot Chronicles of Darkness was launched the same year with a new line of games. In 2011, the original series was brought back, and the two have since been published concurrently.

The games in the series have a shared setting, also named the World of Darkness, which is a dark, gothic-punk interpretation of the real world, where supernatural beings such as vampires and werewolves exist in secrecy. The original series&#x27; setting has a large focus on lore and overarching narrative, whereas &quot;Chronicles of Darkness&quot; setting has no such narrative and presents the details of its setting as optional.

The series has been well received critically for its setting, writing, and art direction, and has won or been nominated for awards including the Origins Award. It has also been commercially successful, with millions of game books sold; by 2001, &quot;Vampire: The Masquerade&quot; was the second highest selling tabletop role-playing game after TSR, Inc.&#x27;s &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;. The series has been adapted into other media, including the television series &quot;&quot;, actual play web series, novels and anthologies, comic books, card games, and a line of video games.

==Games==
The original &quot;World of Darkness&quot; series consists of eight core lines of role-playing games which were originally released from 1991 to 2002:
*&quot;&quot;
*&quot;&quot;
*&quot;&quot;
*&quot;&quot;

As well as off-shoots based on these, such as the Asia-themed &quot;Kindred of the East&quot; and the historical &quot;&quot;.
The 2004 reboot series, &quot;Chronicles of Darkness&quot;, consists of eleven game lines: &quot;&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;Demon: The Descent&quot;, &quot;Beast: The Primordial&quot;, and &quot;Deviant: The Renegades&quot;. Most of these are based on concepts from the original series, directly as with &quot;Vampire: The Requiem&quot; and &quot;Vampire: The Masquerade&quot;, or indirectly as with &quot;Geist&quot; and &quot;Wraith&quot;, which both deal with spirits.

Both series are supported with supplementary sourcebooks detailing backgrounds and character types, which can be used when creating adventures for one&#x27;s players; pre-made adventure modules have also occasionally been published. The &quot;Chronicles of Darkness&quot; sourcebooks in particular present the information as optional and something one may choose whether to include in one&#x27;s game. The supplements often take the form of a book describing a location as it is portrayed in the setting, such as &quot;Vampire: The Masquerade&quot; series of &quot;By Night&quot; books and &quot;Werewolf: The Apocalypse&quot; &quot;Rage Across&quot; series. Several splatbooks – sourcebooks detailing character classes or organizations – have also been published, such as the &quot;Clanbook&quot; series, describing vampire clans, and the &quot;Kithbook&quot; line, covering types of fae.

==Common elements==
The games in the original series are set in a shared universe, also named the World of Darkness, which is a dark, gothic-punk interpretation of the real world, rife with corruption. In it, supernatural beings such as vampires, mages, and werewolves exist in secrecy, influencing humanity and clashing against each other; players take the roles of these beings, who belong to various classes such as &quot;Vampire: The Masquerade&quot; vampire clans, and &quot;Werewolf: The Apocalypse&quot; werewolf tribes. The series as a whole is themed around personal horror, while individual games have their own themes, such as redemption and humanity in &quot;Vampire: The Masquerade&quot;, and hubris in &quot;Mage: The Ascension&quot;. The series is known for its focus on metaplot – an overarching story for the setting that advances as new game books are released.

Whereas the original series has a large focus on lore and background information for its setting, the urban horror &quot;Chronicles of Darkness&quot; setting does not to the same extent; it does not have a metaplot, and it presents any setting information as strictly optional to include in campaigns. With its lesser focus on lore and less defined world, &quot;Chronicles of Darkness&quot; also streamlines the character types, stripping the many vampire clans and werewolf tribes from the original series down to five each.

The person leading campaigns – a role called gamemaster or dungeon master in other games – is called a storyteller in &quot;World of Darkness&quot;, highlighting how the series is more focused on collaborative storytelling than on combat or on players overcoming the game leader&#x27;s challenges; the rules exist to give players a framework for telling stories, and players are rewarded by being part of the setting rather than by escalating power levels. &quot;Chronicles of Darkness&quot; has a larger focus on making the gameplay systems work together, enabling easier cross-over play between the games.

==History==
===1990–2006: White Wolf Publishing===
The &quot;World of Darkness&quot; series began development in 1990 by game designer Mark Rein-Hagen at White Wolf Publishing, as his next major role-playing game project after 1987&#x27;s &quot;Ars Magica&quot;. Designed as the first in a planned series of five annual games, &quot;&quot; was released in 1991, and was followed by &quot;&quot; (1992), &quot;&quot; (1993), &quot;&quot; (1994), and &quot;&quot; (1995), all set in the same world and using the Storyteller rule system. This rapid expansion with new games, although successful and capturing players&#x27; and the industry&#x27;s interest, led to often flawed first editions, prompting several revised, new editions of the core rulebooks between 1992–2000, resulting in &quot;Mage: The Ascension&quot; morphing a lot between its editions as its themes changed. &quot;Ars Magica&quot; was initially tied to &quot;World of Darkness&quot; and used as a historical backdrop: its House Tremere was reused as a vampire clan in &quot;Vampire: The Masquerade&quot;, and its Order of Hermes as a mage tradition in &quot;Mage: The Ascension&quot;. The rights to &quot;Ars Magica&quot; were sold to Wizards of the Coast in 1994, and the histories of the games were separated.

Rein-Hagen constantly moved on to designing new games after finishing one, designing all the original five games except &quot;Mage: The Ascension&quot;, which was designed by White Wolf Publishing&#x27;s founders, brothers Stewart and Steve Wieck, and Chris Earley; as such, new staff were brought in to manage the game lines, including Andrew Greenberg for &quot;Vampire&quot; and Bill Bridges for &quot;Werewolf&quot;, who came to define the look and feel of the series. An economic downturn for White Wolf Publishing in 1995–1996, caused in part by bookstore returns for &quot;World of Darkness&quot; novelizations, led to a falling out between Rein-Hagen and the Wieck brothers, after which Rein-Hagen left the company. As the original planned five annual games had already been published, White Wolf Publishing next devised a new model of role-playing games with a historical setting based on previous games, resulting in &quot;&quot; (1996), &quot;&quot; (1997), and &quot;&quot; (1998), of which only &quot;Vampire: The Dark Ages&quot; sold well. This led to the cancellation of the underperforming &quot;Wraith&quot; line, with the release of the historical-setting &quot;&quot; and the 1999 supplement &quot;Ends of Empire&quot;, which functioned as a finale to the game&#x27;s metaplot.

In 1997, White Wolf Publishing developed another model, where they would release a game that required another &quot;World of Darkness&quot; rule book to play, which thereby would get the same attention as a new stand-alone core game without requiring them to further support it with supplements; this was used for 1997&#x27;s &quot;&quot; and its 2001 re-release &quot;Mummy: The Resurrection&quot;, and 1998&#x27;s &quot;Kindred of the East&quot;. The two final major modern-day-setting &quot;World of Darkness&quot; role-playing games, &quot;&quot; and &quot;&quot;, followed in 1999 and 2002, after which White Wolf Publishing returned to historical-setting games with &quot;Victorian Age: Vampire&quot; and &quot;Dark Ages: Vampire&quot;, a new edition of &quot;Vampire: The Dark Ages&quot;, and a line of &quot;Dark Ages&quot; games based on other &quot;World of Darkness&quot; games that, like &quot;Kindred of the East&quot; and &quot;Mummy&quot;, required a main game&#x27;s rule book to be played. A final game, &quot;Orpheus&quot;, was released in 2003 as a sequel to &quot;Wraith&quot;.

In 2004, following dwindling sales, White Wolf Publishing ended the series with the major event &quot;Time of Judgment&quot;: a line of books that ended the overarching narratives of &quot;Vampire: The Masquerade&quot;, &quot;Werewolf: The Apocalypse&quot;, &quot;Mage: The Ascension&quot;, &quot;Changeling: The Dreaming&quot;, &quot;Demon: The Fallen&quot;, &quot;Hunter: The Reckoning&quot;, &quot;Kindred of the East&quot;, and &quot;Mummy: The Resurrection&quot;. Following this, White Wolf Publishing rebooted the series with the 2004 rulebook &quot;The World of Darkness&quot;, and released new games with updated Storytelling System gameplay rules and a new setting, beginning with &quot;&quot; in 2004 and &quot;&quot; and &quot;&quot; in 2005.

===2006–2015: CCP Games===
In 2006, the Icelandic video game developer CCP Games acquired White Wolf Publishing and their intellectual properties, with the intention of developing an online video game based on &quot;World of Darkness&quot;. Business continued as usual until 2009, when CCP Games started transferring White Wolf Publishing staff to video game development and slowed down tabletop game production.

The CCP Games incarnation of White Wolf Publishing published its last print products for distribution in 2011, with &quot;Vampire: The Masquerade 20th Anniversary Edition&quot;, an update of the pre-reboot game. Amid mass layoffs at CCP Games the same year, leaving few resources to produce tabletop games, White Wolf Publishing&#x27;s creative director Rich Thomas formed Onyx Path Publishing and licensed both of the &quot;World of Darkness&quot; series, continuing support for them and producing new material. This included further anniversary editions, and new games like &quot;&quot; (2013) and &quot;Demon: The Descent&quot; (2014); these projects were frequently financed through crowdfunding.

===2015–present: Paradox Interactive===
White Wolf Publishing and its intellectual properties were sold again in 2015, to the Swedish video game publisher Paradox Interactive. Following this, the rebooted &quot;World of Darkness&quot; series was renamed &quot;Chronicles of Darkness&quot;, while the original series remained as &quot;World of Darkness&quot;. This was done to prevent confusion among players over there being two series and settings with the same name: Prior to the renaming, the two had been distinguished from each other by being referred to as the &quot;Old&quot; or &quot;Classic World of Darkness&quot; and the &quot;New World of Darkness&quot;. Onyx Path Publishing&#x27;s in-development &quot;Vampire: The Masquerade 4th Edition&quot;, which they had announced only a few months earlier, was cancelled following this, as Paradox Interactive planned to publish their own fifth edition.

The Paradox Interactive incarnation of White Wolf Publishing released the fifth edition of &quot;Vampire: The Masquerade&quot; in 2018, which included references to neo-Nazis and a character interpreted as being a pedophile, leading to accusations that they were catering to neo-Nazi groups. White Wolf Publishing denied that this was their intention, and apologized. Following the use of the real-world anti-gay purges in Chechnya as the backdrop for fictional events in &quot;Vampire: The Masquerade&quot; sourcebooks, in what Paradox Interactive&#x27;s vice president of business development described as a &quot;crude and disrespectful&quot; way, Paradox Interactive integrated White Wolf Publishing directly into the parent company, made changes to its leadership, suspended sales and printings of the books, and halted its development and publishing of &quot;World of Darkness&quot; games. The material was removed from the books, and &quot;Vampire: The Masquerade&quot; development was moved to the licensee Modiphius Entertainment and collaborators including Onyx Path Publishing.

Starting with the 2020 book &quot;Vampire: The Masquerade Companion&quot;, Paradox Interactive introduced further changes to the handling of the series: headed by creative lead Justin Achilli, they would develop core game books internally, while collaborator Renegade Game Studios would develop other game material. Along with this reorganization, Paradox Interactive announced that &quot;World of Darkness&quot; development from then on would involve sensitivity reviewers to ensure respectful portrayal of themes and topics. In addition to tabletop game development, the &quot;World of Darkness&quot; team at Paradox Interactive plans the setting&#x27;s overarching narrative, and coordinates with external developers, such as those of &quot;World of Darkness&quot; video game adaptations, to ensure cohesion.

==Related media==
In addition to the tabletop games, the series has expanded into other media, including video games, card and board games, the &quot;Mind&#x27;s Eye Theatre&quot; series of live action role-playing games, novels, fiction anthologies, comics, the 1996 television series &quot;&quot;, the actual play web series &quot;L.A. by Night&quot; (2018), &quot;Seattle by Night&quot; (2019), &quot;Vein Pursuit&quot; (2020), and &quot;The Nightlife&quot; (2021), and an in-development film and television franchise. Although &quot;World of Darkness&quot; multimedia projects slowed down under CCP Games, production began anew after Paradox Interactive acquired the series.

A collectible card game based on &quot;Vampire: The Masquerade&quot; was released by Wizards of the Coast in 1994 as &quot;Jyhad&quot;, before being re-launched a year later as &quot;&quot;; Wizards of the Coast continued publishing it until 1996, and then White Wolf took over, publishing it in 2000–2010. In 2018, Black Chantry Productions licensed &quot;The Eternal Struggle&quot;, reprinting old cards and continuing production of the game. Following &quot;The Eternal Struggle&quot;, White Wolf also published a collectible card game on their own, &quot;Rage&quot;, based on &quot;Werewolf: The Apocalypse&quot;, from 1995 to 1996, which was even more successful than &quot;The Eternal Struggle&quot;; Five Rings Publishing licensed it, and continued producing it in 1998–1999. Two other &quot;Vampire: The Masquerade&quot; card games, &quot;Vendetta&quot; and &quot;Rivals&quot;, were released in 2021 by Horrible Guild and Renegade Game Studios, respectively. A story-based board game, &quot;Vampire: The Masquerade – Chapters&quot;, is in development by Flyos Games.

A large number of &quot;World of Darkness&quot; novels and anthologies have been published, starting with the &quot;Werewolf: The Apocalypse&quot; anthology &quot;Drums Around the Fire&quot; in 1993, and were described by &quot;What Do I Read Next? A Reader&#x27;s Guide to Current Genre Fiction&quot; as &quot;old-fashioned adventures&quot; in the style of pulp fiction. The books were popular and helped White Wolf Publishing grow, and were described as leading among horror novelizations by &quot;The Mammoth Book of Best New Horror&quot; in 1996, but were in the end not financially successful, due to book chains closing mall stores in 1995–1996 and returning a large amount of unsold books to the publisher. By 1998, &quot;What Do I Read Next?&quot; considered the novelizations to have improved in quality, citing White Wolf&#x27;s move to commissioning established horror and fantasy writers; in 2002, &quot;Black Gate&quot; considered Andrew Bates&#x27;s &quot;Year of the Scarab Trilogy&quot; a standout compared to previous &quot;lackluster&quot; &quot;World of Darkness&quot; novels. New &quot;World of Darkness&quot; novelizations started to disappear around 2006, but have since resumed.

The series has been adapted into comics, sometimes published in the &quot;World of Darkness&quot; tabletop game books, but also as comic books, including &quot;Vampire: The Masquerade&quot; and &quot;Werewolf: The Apocalypse&quot; lines published by Moonstone Books in the early 2000s, and published by Vault Comics since 2020.

There are several video game adaptations of the series, based on &quot;Vampire: The Masquerade&quot;, &quot;Hunter: The Reckoning&quot;, &quot;Mage: The Ascension&quot;, &quot;Werewolf: The Apocalypse&quot;, and &quot;Wraith: The Oblivion&quot;. Critical reception of the games has varied, ranging from average to positive, with 2004&#x27;s &quot;&quot; standing out, being described by video game publications as a cult classic and a &quot;flawed masterpiece&quot;; when Paradox Interactive acquired the series, they had considered &quot;Bloodlines&quot; the &quot;crown jewel&quot; of &quot;World of Darkness&quot;, and something they knew from the start that they wanted to bring back with .

==Reception==
&quot;World of Darkness&quot; has been critically well received, with several of its games having won or been nominated for awards, and with &quot;Vampire: The Masquerade&quot; having been inducted into the Origins Award hall of fame. The series has also been highly successful financially, primarily in the United States, with over three million game books sold by the late 1990s; around 1995, new &quot;World of Darkness&quot; releases were frequently top sellers, making White Wolf the second biggest publisher of tabletop role-playing games at the time after TSR, Inc., and by 2001, &quot;Vampire: The Masquerade&quot; was the second best selling tabletop role-playing game after TSR, Inc.&#x27;s &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;. Onyx Path Publishing&#x27;s crowdfunding campaigns for &quot;World of Darkness&quot; games and material have also been successful, particularly those for the original series, such as the anniversary editions of &quot;Werewolf: The Apocalypse&quot; and &quot;Mage: The Ascension&quot;.

The series&#x27; setting, plot, and art direction have been well received, with &quot;Rue Morgue&quot; describing the series&#x27; &quot;fabulous artwork&quot; as one of its major strengths, &quot;Fenix&quot; praising the series&#x27; mood and the quality of the writing, and &quot;Realms of Fantasy&quot; appreciating the broad scope and the familiarity to players due to being based on the real world. &quot;Shadis&quot; described the setting as &quot;truly unique&quot;, bringing something never before seen to games. Some publications found the setting too crowded or defined, however; &quot;Diehard GameFan&quot; thought this took away from opportunities for horror, and &quot;Tor.com&quot; thought it left little room to tell new stories, often choosing to ignore the metaplot when running games. In his book series &quot;Designers &amp; Dragons&quot;, Shannon Appelcline considered the series&#x27; focus on metaplot to likely be what had caused sales to dwindle prior to the reboot, as players would have stopped playing the games when feeling they could not keep up with the story. Reactions to the &quot;Chronicles of Darkness&quot; setting have been divided, with some preferring the original series&#x27; setting for being more fantastical and grand in scale, and some the reboot&#x27;s more grounded setting.

The original series&#x27; rules were criticized by &quot;Arcane&quot; as, although generally easy to understand, often having confusing and unclear combat rules, while &quot;Tor.com&quot; described them as having a recurring problem with statistical anomalies. The updated gameplay rules of &quot;Chronicles of Darkness&quot; were however generally seen as a big improvement, and seen by critics as fluid, elegant and open-ended, to the point where &quot;Tor.com&quot; and &quot;Backstab&quot; recommended using them even when running non-&quot;Chronicles of Darkness&quot; games. &quot;Fenix&quot; appreciated the speed of creating characters and of playing, comparing the system of dice pools and dots favorably to number-based role-playing game systems.

In his 2023 book &quot;Monsters, Aliens, and Holes in the Ground&quot;, RPG historian Stu Horvath noted, &quot;For all of the innovation and great ideas on display across all of the &quot;World of Darkness&quot; lines, there were problems from the start. The first version of nearly every game in the series was ugly and semi-broken, followed soon after by the second edition, which attempted to salvage the games with corrections and tidier production values. Given that White Wolf books had a habit of physically falling to pieces in short order, that is, perhaps, a feature and not a bug.&quot;

<text>The Basque Nationalist Party ( , EAJ; , PNV; , PNB; EAJ-PNV), officially the Basque National Party in English, is a Basque nationalist and regionalist political party. The party is located in the centre of the political spectrum. It has been described as Christian democratic, with social democratic and conservative-liberal factions. 

The EAJ-PNV was founded by Sabino Arana in 1895, which makes it the second oldest extant political party in Spain, after the Spanish Socialist Workers&#x27; Party (PSOE). The EAJ-PNV is the largest Basque nationalist party, having led the Basque Government uninterruptedly since 1979, except for a brief period between 2009 and 2012. In Navarre, it is part of the coalition Geroa Bai, which is currently a junior partner of the PSOE in the Navarrese regional government. In Spain at large, the party has been supporting current Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez, a member of the PSOE, since 2020. Currently a member of the European Democratic Party, EAJ-PNV was previously a member of the European Free Alliance from 1999 to 2004. Earlier it had been affiliated with the European People&#x27;s Party and the Christian Democrat International (from which it was expelled in 2000).

The party operates in all the territories comprising the Basque Country: the Basque Autonomous Community and Navarre in Spain, and in the French Basque Country. It also has delegations in dozens of foreign nations, specifically those with a major presence of Basque immigrants. Its current chairman is Andoni Ortuzar. The party&#x27;s youth wing is Euzko Gaztedi. The EAJ-PNV&#x27;s social offices are called batzokis, of which there are over 200 throughout the world. Since 1932, the party celebrates &quot;Aberri Eguna&quot; (Homeland Day) on Easter. Also, since 1977, it celebrates &quot;Alderdi Eguna&quot; (Party Day).

== History ==

=== Origins and early history ===

The Basque Nationalist Party (EAJ-PNV) was founded in 1895 by Sabino de Arana Goiri as a Catholic and conservative political party agitating for political independence for the province of Biscay and the defence of Basque traditional culture, language, and racial purity. In fact, in its early years, party membership was restricted to those who could prove pure Basque ancestry by having eight Basque surnames.

By 1897, the party sought independence not only for Biscay but for all seven provinces comprising the Basque Country in both Spain and France.

In 1916, the Basque Nationalist Party renamed itself the Basque Nationalist Communion (&quot;Comunión Nacionalista Vasca&quot;). This name change marked a departure, in many aspects, from the original doctrine of the late Sabino Arana and casting itself as a broader social movement rather than simply a political party. The Basque Nationalist Communion at this point advocated for Basque autonomy within Spain, rather than outright independence. However, a small faction known as the &quot;Aberrianos&quot; (&quot;Fatherlanders&quot;) within the party remained committed to the cause of independence. In 1921, the leading members of the Aberrianos were kicked from the moderate Basque Nationalist Communion. Later that year, the Aberrianos officially formed their own political party, reclaiming the name &quot;Basque Nationalist Party&quot;.

During the single party dictatorship of Captain General Miguel Primo de Rivera (1923-1930), the Basque Nationalist Party was outlawed, and its members went underground. Many of its activities continued through mountaineering (&quot;mendigoxale&quot;) and folklore associations. However, the Basque Nationalist Communion was tolerated by the Spanish dictatorship as it was considered a moderate regionalist party.

At the end of 1930, the two nationalist organisations united under the original name Basque Nationalist Party. However, a small faction split from the Basque Nationalist Communion shortly before the reunification, calling itself &quot;Eusko Abertzale Ekintza-Acción Nacionalista Vasca&quot; (&quot;Basque Nationalist Action&quot;). It was on the moderate nationalist left, non-confessional and open to alliances with Spanish republican and socialist parties.

=== The Second Spanish Republic ===

==== 1934–1935 ====
The division between autonomism and independentism appeared again during the Second Spanish Republic. Headed by &quot;Aberriano&quot; veteran Eli Gallastegi, a small group of independentists coalesced around the Mountaineering Federation of Biscay and its affiliated weekly publication &quot;Jagi-Jagi&quot; (&quot;Arise Arise&quot;), and abandoned the now-moderate and autonomist Basque Nationalist Party.

=== The Spanish Civil War and Franco&#x27;s rule ===

After the Spanish Civil War of 18 July 1936, the party felt torn. Certain branches of the party supported the rebellion against the Republic, feeling sympathy for its Catholic and anti-communist agenda. However, the right-wing rebels insisted on a unified Spain, making them hostile to nationalist movements in regions such as the Basque Country. Furthermore, the Basque Nationalist Party was also anti-Fascist, while Fascists constituted a large part of the rebellion. Ultimately, the republican government was able to secure the allegiance of the Basque Nationalist Party with the promise to pass a Basque Autonomy Statute.

The Biscayan and Gipuzkoan branches declared support for the republic, democracy, and anti-fascism in the ensuing Spanish Civil War and were key in balancing those provinces to the Republican side. In the territory seized by the rebels, PNV members faced tough times. During the military uprising in Navarre, the Basque nationalist mayor of Estella-Lizarra, Fortunato Aguirre, was arrested by the Spanish nationalist rebels (18 July 1936), and killed in September. Some Basque nationalists could flee north to Basque areas loyal to the Republic, or France. However, some members of the Alavese and Navarrese committees, ahead of an official decision, published notes refusing support to the Republic. Notwithstanding their initial ambiguous position in certain areas, the party premises and press in Álava and Navarre were closed in that month of July.

Some PNV sympathizers and members joined the Carlist battalions, either out of conviction or to avoid persecution. By October 1936, a war front had been established at the northern tip of Álava and to the west of Donostia-San Sebastián. Initially, the Defence Committees in Biscay and Gipuzkoa were dominated by the Popular Front. After hard negotiations, eventually Basque autonomy was granted within the Second Spanish Republic in late 1936, and the new autonomous government immediately organized the Basque Army, consisting of militias recruited separately by the various political organizations, including the EAJ-PNV, EAE-ANV, and &quot;Jagi-Jagi&quot;.

The autonomous government maintained remarkable order behind the lines in Biscay and western Gipuzkoa, and managed the coordination and provision of military resistance. Upon occupation of territories loyal to the Republic, the rebel forces focused repression on leftists, but Basque nationalists were also targeted, facing prison, humiliation, and death in some cases. As the rebel troops approached Biscay, the Carlist press in Pamplona even called for the extermination of Basque nationalists.
José Antonio Aguirre, the party leader, became in October 1936 the first &quot;lehendakari&quot; (Basque president) of the wartime multipartite Basque Government, ruling the unconquered parts of Biscay and Gipuzkoa. In April 1937, the city of Gernika was bombed by German airplanes covertly aiding the rebel forces. Jose Antonio Aguirre stated that &quot;the German planes bombed us with a brutality that had never been seen before for two and a half hours.&quot; Pablo Picasso made a painting in remembrance of the massacre named after the city that year.

When Bilbao, the most populated city in the Basque Country, was taken by Franco&#x27;s troops, the Basque nationalists decided to not destroy or sabotage the powerful manufacturing industry of Bilbao, thinking that they had the responsibility to secure the prosperity of their people in the future. This decision allowed the occupying rebel forces to use the industrial power of Bilbao in their war effort against the rest of Republic-aligned Spain.

In July 1937, having lost all Basque territory, the Basque Army retreated toward Santander. With no territory or help from the Republic, the Basque Army surrendered to the Italian &quot;Corpo Truppe Volontari&quot; through the so-called Santoña Agreement. Prison sentences and executions followed, as the rebel government of Francisco Franco ruled that separate terms of surrender could not be made between the Basques and Italians. The Basque government then moved to Barcelona until the fall of Catalonia, and then out of Spain into exile in France. &quot;Lehendakari&quot; Aguirre was exiled in Belgium when Hitler&#x27;s forces invaded it, thus beginning his long clandestine journey to reach the United States. With a false identity, he travelled to Berlin, and then on to Sweden with the help of a Panamanian ambassador. He fled Europe for Latin America, where in Uruguay he re-assumed his real identity and was given a visa to the United States. He travelled to New York, where he was taken under the protection of American Basques as a professor at Columbia University.

====Exile during the post-war====
The president of the Basque Government in exile was always a EAJ-PNV member. Additionally, the sole Spanish representative in the United Nations was the Basque appointee Jesús de Galíndez, until his murder in an obscure episode regarding his PhD Thesis about Dominican Republic&#x27;s dictator Trujillo. He also decided to put the large Basque exiles&#x27; network at the service of the Allied side and collaborated with the US Secretary of State and the CIA during the Cold War to fight Communism in Spanish America.

When the United States decided to back Franco in 1952, Aguirre went to France where the Basque Government in exile was established. Also, he learned there that the pro-Nazi French government of Vichy confiscated the Basque Government&#x27;s building and that the anti-Nazi Charles de Gaulle maintained it as a Spanish Government&#x27;s possession. The building today is the Instituto Cervantes premises where French people can learn any of the Spanish languages, including Basque.

====Generational conflict and new alliances====
In 1959, ETA was created by young undergraduates from the area of Bilbao (organisation EKIN) lured by Basque nationalist ideology, but increasingly disgruntled at the ineffective political action of the EAJ-PNV, largely daunted by post-war repression and scattered in exile. In addition, the new generation resented an attempt of the EAJ-PNV to pull the strings of their movement and PNV&#x27;s youth wing Euzko Gaztedi (EGI), with whom they had merged in the mid-1950s, as well as showing a more modern stance, stressing for one the language as the centre of &quot;Basqueness&quot;, instead of race.

In the 1950s and 1960s, the party looked for alliances abroad, expecting at first that the defeat of the Axis in World War II would encourage USA&#x27;s support for an eventual overthrow of Franco&#x27;s hold on power, which did not happen. In addition, it was a founder party of the Christian Democrat International, but now the party is an active member of the European Democratic Party.

In the late 1960s and early 1970s, contacts started with other Spanish parties to assert the EAJ-PNV&#x27;s position in a new post-Francoist order. At the same time, the Basque Nationalist Party confirmed its stance against ETA in a period when its violent actions saw a surge and its influence in society was very apparent, especially in street protests. Juan de Ajuriaguerra paved the way for the EAJ-PNV&#x27;s comeback to Basque politics from exile, and started to negotiate their participation in the new status-quo, with special attention to a new Statute.

===A Basque Statute===

The EAJ-PNV&#x27;s results in the 1977 and 1978 elections confirmed PNV&#x27;s central position in Basque politics. While the EAJ-PNV advocated for abstention in the referendum on the Spanish Constitution for its lack of Basque input, the party supported the Statute of Autonomy of the Basque Country, approved in December 1978, and paved the way to its success in the first elections held in the Basque Autonomous Community, once Navarre was left out.

In the transition years after Franco&#x27;s death in 1975, Xabier Arzallus came to prominence, who masterminded the so-called &quot;Spirit of Arriaga&quot; to accommodate the party to the new Spanish democracy. Despite some internal tensions, the former priest and Jesuit came up reinforced and was chosen undisputed party leader. The EAJ-PNV found its main and strongest support base in Biscay, while in Navarre EAJ-PNV was next to non-existent.

Carlos Garaikoetxea spearheaded the new autonomous government after being elected with 38.8% of the votes and during this first term the Basque Nationalist Party held office without outside support. During this period, the EAJ-PNV&#x27;s challenges were closely associated to its position in the Basque Government: defense of the Statute, devolution of powers from Madrid, discrediting of political violence, restructuring of manufacturing industry steeped in crisis.

As of 1985, tensions inside the party spurred the formation of a splinter group with a stronghold in Gipuzkoa, which in turn led to a new party in 1987, when dissenters from the EAJ-PNV formed the &quot;Basque Solidarity&quot; (&quot;Eusko Alkartasuna&quot;, EA) party. Carlos Garaikoetxea was then elected as the first president of the rival party. The split from the EAJ-PNV was mainly based on:
* A personality clash between the lehendakari Garaikoetxea, who went to form EA, and the EAJ-PNV leader Xabier Arzalluz.
* The configuration of the Basque Country:
** A strong Basque government and weak provinces (EA).
** Strong provinces (EAJ-PNV).

Afterwards, some ideological differences also came out. EA adopted a social-democratic ideology, while the EAJ-PNV remained more attached to its Christian-democratic ideas. The split was particularly bitter given that it was headed by the lehendakari (premier) himself. Many EAJ-PNV political bars (&#x27;, &quot;meeting place&quot;) became &#x27; (&quot;meeting house&quot;).
Since 1991, as time has eased the bitter split (helped by the fact that both Arzalluz and Garaikoetxea have gone into political retirement), both parties agreed to form an electoral coalition in a number of local elections as a means to maximise the nationalist votes, which eventually led to reunite both candidatures in a joint list again for the regional governments of Navarra and the Basque Autonomous Community in 1998. Thus, EA has participated in several EAJ-PNV-led Basque governments, including the 2006 government of President Juan José Ibarretxe Markuartu. Still, EA decided to run by itself in the municipal elections held in May 2007.

Former president Juan José Ibarretxe spearheaded a call for the reform of the Statute of Autonomy that governs the Basque Country Autonomous Community, through a proposal widely known as the Ibarretxe Plan, passed by the Basque Parliament but not even accepted for discussion by the Spanish Cortes Generales.

In 2009, the EAJ-PNV was expelled from office by an alliance of the Socialist Party of the Basque Country and the People&#x27;s Party, taking advantage of a distorted parliament representation issued from the outlawing of left-wing Basque nationalists. Until that moment, the EAJ-PNV dominated every administration of the Basque government. In Navarre, the EA and EAJ-PNV formed the coalition Nafarroa Bai—&#x27;Yes to Navarre&#x27;—along with Aralar and Batzarre, but a split within the coalition led to its revamp as Geroa Bai. In terms of ideology, by November 2016 the Basque Nationalist Party shifted its rhetoric to make the autonomous community of Euskadi the subject of the Basque nation.

=== Position in recent referendums ===
The EAJ-PNV called for:
* Abstention in the Referendum for Spanish Constitution in 1978.
* Gave freedom to vote yes or no to permanence of Spain in the NATO in 1986. The Yes won the vote in Spain, but the No was the first choice among the electors of the Basque Country.
* Yes to the European Constitution proposal in the referendum held in Spain on 21 February 2005; and supported the Lisbon Treaty in the Spanish Cortes Generales.

== Ideology ==
The EAJ-PNV has ideologically evolved over time. The party has struggled with internal infighting between moderate pragmatic and radical separatist factions for much of its history. The party currently defines itself as a &quot;basque, democratic, participative, plural, secular and humanist&quot; party.

During its early years under the command of Sabino Arana, the party&#x27;s ideology was based on a Basque nationalism fundamentally characterised by an essentialist conception of the Basque nation, Catholic integrism, notions of racial purity and opposition to liberalism, socialism and industrialization. The party initially sought independence only for the province of Biscay, but it started calling for the independence of all seven Basque provinces in Spain and France soon after. The party&#x27;s ideological evolution under Arana has been divided into three stages: a radical nationalist one from 1893 to 1898; a more moderate and pragmatic phase from 1898 to 1902; and a pro-Spanish shift that ended in 1903 with Arana&#x27;s death.

=== Leadership ===
==== Party Presidents ====
The National Council of the Basque Nationalist Party (&quot;Euzkadi-Buru-Batzar&quot;) was created in 1911. Therefore, Sabino Arana and Ángel Zabala were only presidents of the Regional Council of Biscay (&quot;Bizkai-Buru-Batzar&quot;).

=== Party traditions ===

==== &quot;Jeltzaletasuna&quot; ====

JeL (, &quot;God and the Old Laws&quot; in Arana&#x27;s purist Biscayan Basque, or in Standard Basque) is the motto of the party.

The &quot;old laws&quot; referred to are the fueros, the traditional laws of the Basque provinces, observed by the kings of Castile, and later Spain, until the Carlist Wars.
The motto of Basque Carlists was &quot;&quot; (&quot;God, Country, Fueros, King&quot;). Basque nationalism evolved out of Carlism, eventually supplanting it in much of the Basque Country.

 in the party&#x27;s Basque-language name is a word comprising two parts: (the acronym for &quot;God and the Old Laws&quot;) and (literally meaning &quot;fond of&quot;). Thus could be rendered in English as &quot;one who is fond of God and the Old Laws (JeL)&quot;, or translated simply as &quot;nationalist&quot;.

A (after , &quot;companion&quot;) is a member of the party.

==== Alderdi Eguna ====
Alderdi Eguna (&quot;Party Day&quot;) is the national holiday of the Basque Nationalist Party which is annually celebrated on the last Sunday of September, the Sunday closest to the feast day of Saint Michael, the patron saint of Euskal Herria and of the Basque Nationalist Party.

The central act of this celebration is a political meeting of leading nationalists, but the celebration begins in the morning with a traditional festival in which the different municipal organizations from the party set up stands to sell drinks and their more typical products, all brightened up by traditional music. Dances and traditional sports are also enjoyed. The celebration takes place in an open air arena (currently in Foronda, Álava), and lasts until nightfall.

=== International affiliation ===
In the European Parliament, the Basque Nationalist Party sits in the Renew Europe group with one MEP. The EAJ-PNV is also a member of the European Democratic Party (EDP). The party was previously a founding member of the European People&#x27;s Party and the Christian Democrat International, from which it was expelled in 2000. The EAJ-PNV was also a member of the European Free Alliance from 1999 to 2004. 

In the European Committee of the Regions, the Basque Nationalist Party sits in the Renew Europe CoR group with one full and one alternate member for the 2020-2025 mandate.

<text>Paris Saint-Germain Football Club (), commonly referred to as Paris Saint-Germain or simply PSG, is a professional football club based in Paris, France. They compete in Ligue 1, the top division of French football. 

Founded in 1970, following the merger of Paris FC and Stade Saint-Germain, PSG have the most consecutive seasons playing in France&#x27;s top flight. They are the most popular football club in France and one of the most widely supported teams in the world. They are nicknamed the &quot;Les Rouge-et-Bleu&quot; (The Red-and-Blues), for the shirt colour that also includes white, and their crest features the Eiffel Tower and a fleur-de-lis. The team has a longstanding rivalry with Marseille, against whom they contest Le Classique. PSG have played their home matches in the 48,000-capacity Parc des Princes in Paris since 1973, located in the 16th arrondissement of Paris near the Boulogne-Billancourt commune. 

They won their first major honour, the French Cup, in 1982 and their first Division 1 title in 1986. The 1990s was among the most successful periods in the club&#x27;s history. After suffering a decline in fortunes during the 2000s, the Red and Blues have enjoyed a revival since 2011 when they were taken over by Qatar Sports Investments. With considerable financial investment, allowing the club to buy superstar players such as Zlatan Ibrahimović, Edinson Cavani and Neymar, the team has achieved unparalleled dominance in domestic competitions, winning multiple league titles and national cups and became a regular feature in the UEFA Champions League. 

With 51 major trophies won, PSG are the most decorated club in France. They have won 49 domestic trophies: a record 12 Ligue 1 titles, a record 15 Coupe de France, a record 9 Coupe de la Ligue, and record 13 Trophée des Champions. Internationally, they won the UEFA Cup Winners&#x27; Cup in 1996 – unique feat in French football – and were runners-up in 1997, making them one of two French clubs to have won a major European title. They also won the UEFA Intertoto Cup in 2001 and were runners-up in the 2019–20 UEFA Champions League. 

Since 2011, PSG have been majority-owned by Qatari government-backed investment fund Qatar Sports Investments, which currently holds 87.5% of the shares. American investment firm Arctos Partners owns the remaining 12.5%. PSG are the richest club in France and one of the wealthiest in the world. PSG currently have the third-highest revenue in the footballing world with annual earnings of €806m according to Deloitte, and are the world&#x27;s seventh-most valuable football club, worth $4.4bn according to Forbes.

==History==
===Creation and split (1970–1973)===
In the summer of 1970, an ambitious group of businessmen decided to create a major team in the French capital. Guy Crescent and Pierre-Étienne Guyot chose to merge their virtual side, Paris FC, created in 1969, with Stade Saint-Germain of Henri Patrelle after the team from Saint-Germain-en-Laye, 15 km west of Paris and founded in 1904, won promotion to Division 2. However, the three men were stuck with the financial feasibility of the project until they met Real Madrid president Santiago Bernabéu. He told them that starting a crowdfunding campaign was the best solution to establish a new team. 20,000 people backed the project and Paris Saint-Germain were formed on 17 June 1970. Guyot was elected the club&#x27;s first president a few days later. For the first time in French football history, the fans had financially contributed in the making of a club. The merger was made official following the creation of the club&#x27;s association on 12 August 1970. PSG retains this day as their foundation date.

Paris FC contributed with the financial backing, while Stade Saint-Germain provided the sporting infrastructure, from the Division 2 status to the Camp des Loges training center, as well as the manager Pierre Phelipon and most of the players, including Bernard Guignedoux, Michel Prost and Camille Choquier. PSG further strengthened their squad with the signing of Jean Djorkaeff, captain of the French national team. PSG&#x27;s first official game was a 1–1 league draw away to Poitiers on 23 August 1970. Guignedoux scored the club&#x27;s first ever goal from a free-kick. The club went on to clinch promotion to Division 1 and claim the Division 2 title in its inaugural season.

PSG&#x27;s first top-flight season ended with a safe 16th place, meaning they would stay in Division 1 next year, but behind the scenes the club was in a delicate financial situation. Back in September 1971, the Paris City Council offered 850k francs to pay the club&#x27;s debt and save its place in the elite, demanding PSG in return to adopt the more Parisian name &quot;Paris Football Club.&quot; Crescent, who had replaced Guyot as club president before the start of the season, was in favor of the name change, but Patrelle was against it. The disagreement led to Crescent&#x27;s resignation in December 1971, handing the presidency to Patrelle. The latter tried to persuade the council to reconsider their position, but they remained inflexible and the club split on 1 June 1972, a few days after the last match of the campaign. Backed by the council, Crescent re-formed Paris FC and remained in Division 1, while the PSG of Patrelle were administratively relegated to Division 3, thus losing professional status.

===Top-flight return and Parc des Princes move (1973–1978)===

Paris Saint-Germain really took flight with the arrival of fashion designer Daniel Hechter as chairman of the management committee in June 1973. Besides offering his financial support to the club, he also designed the team&#x27;s classic home outfit. Hechter then shocked the national game ahead of 1973–74 by appointing French legend Just Fontaine as sporting director.

Robert Vicot&#x27;s men finished second in Group B, four points behind Red Star, qualifying for the promotion play–offs against Valenciennes. PSG lost 1–2 away to Valenciennes, but PSG recorded an incredible 4–2 comeback at the Parc des Princes, thus achieving promotion to Division 1 and regaining its professional status abandoned two years earlier. Overwhelmed by emotion, Fontaine collapsed on the lawn and was then carried by the players in celebration. Since then, PSG have always played in the first tier of French football.

PSG played their first game at the Parc des Princes during this campaign. It was against fellow Parisian side Red Star on 10 November 1973. PSG won 3–1 and Othniel Dossevi scored the club&#x27;s first goal at the stadium. The Parisians also began their tradition of brilliant Coupe de France runs, reaching the quarterfinals after beating Metz at the Parc in front of 25,000 spectators (2–1; 4–1 on aggregate).

In an ironic turn of events, Paris FC were relegated to Division 2 at the same time as Paris Saint-Germain moved up to the top flight in 1974, leaving their home stadium, the Parc des Princes, in the hands of their estranged Parisian brothers. Since then, the Parc has been the home of PSG. With promotion to Division 1 also came a change of command. Daniel Hechter, then chairman of the management committee, took over as club president in June 1974 following the resignation of Patrelle. He named Francis Borelli as vice-president.

Under Hechter&#x27;s tenure, the Parisians failed to win any silverware in the 1970s but began their tradition of brilliant Coupe de France runs, established themselves in Division 1, and attracted several prestigious players, including Jean-Pierre Dogliani, Mustapha Dahleb and Carlos Bianchi. After Hechter was banned for life from football by the French Football Federation in January 1978, for running a ticketing scheme at the Parc des Princes, Francis Borelli, who had been vice-president until then, became the new boss of the Île-de-France club.

===First major honours and decline (1978–1991)===

Following the arrival of manager Georges Peyroche in November 1979, the club established itself as a top-half team and then welcomed its first major honour when the Parisians reached their first French Cup final in 1982. Up against the great Saint-Étienne of Michel Platini at the Parc des Princes, Nambatingue Toko opened the scoring for PSG following a good cross from Ivica Šurjak. Saint-Étienne reacted and Platini equalized to send the game to extra-time. Platini then doubled his personal account, giving the Greens the lead. The Parc des Princes faithful no longer believed in their team when Dominique Rocheteau, after yet another assist from Šurjak, scored an unexpected equalizer in the last seconds of the match. PSG fans invaded the field in joy, while club president Francis Borelli kneeled and kissed the lawn of the Parc. Following an interruption of 30 minutes, the penalty shootout sealed PSG&#x27;s coronation. Dominique Baratelli stopped Saint-Étienne&#x27;s last attempt and Jean-Marc Pilorget scored the winning penalty for the capital side. This success opened the doors to Europe, where PSG made an impressive continental debut in reaching the quarterfinals of the 1982–83 European Cup Winners&#x27; Cup.

On the domestic scene, results were just as satisfying. PSG captured their first podium finish, coming in third place, and repeated the feat in the 1983 Coupe de France Final, this time against Nantes. Recently crowned French champions, the Canaries were headed for the league-cup double, leading at the break after overturning Pascal Zaremba&#x27;s early strike. But PSG managed their own comeback in the second half as Sušić equalized and then assisted Toko for the winning goal (3–2). The campaign ended on a sad note, though, as Georges Peyroche left the club.

Three years later, under the guidance of manager Gérard Houllier, PSG claimed their maiden league crown in 1985–86. They dominated the championship from start to finish thanks in big part to the likes of Joël Bats, Dominique Bathenay, Luis Fernandez, Dominique Rocheteau and Safet Sušić, all of whom made up the backbone of the team. The victory away to Toulouse on Matchday 3 meant PSG sat at the top of the table for the first time ever, a spot they never relinquished, going a memorable 26 matches without defeat towards the title.

The follow-up to the league title was not as glorious though. Defending champions PSG finished the league in seventh place, suffered an early exit from the French Cup and were knocked out by Czech minnows Vítkovice in the first round of a disappointing European Cup debut. The following year, PSG avoided relegation on the final match of the 1987–88 season thanks to a dramatic 0–1 win away to Le Havre. Highly indebted, the club briefly bounced back, fighting for the 1988–89 league crown with Marseille, before going into decline.

===Canal+ takeover and golden era (1991–1998)===

The takeover by television giants Canal+ in 1991 revitalised Paris Saint-Germain as they became one of the richest clubs in France. Canal+ wiped out PSG&#x27;s huge debt and appointed Michel Denisot, journalist on the channel, as club president in place of Francis Borelli. Now enjoying serious investment, the Red and Blues were able to set their sights steadily higher: they had to qualify for European competitions in their first season and become French champions within three years. In consequence, Canal+ increased the club&#x27;s budget from 90 to 120 million francs in order to build a strong squad for the 1991–92 season. The revolution began with the appointment of renowned coach Artur Jorge, famous for leading Porto to the 1986–87 European Cup trophy. The club then embarked on a spending spree, signing Brazilian stars Ricardo and Valdo as well as proven French players Paul Le Guen, Laurent Fournier, Patrick Colleter and prolific Liberian striker George Weah.

The 1992–93 season also marked the beginning of &quot;Le Classique&quot;, the rivalry between Paris Saint-Germain and Marseille, as both teams battled each other on the field for the 1992–93 French Division 1 crown. PSG finished runners-up after losing both games against Marseille. In the second match between the two clubs, only three days after winning the 1992–93 UEFA Champions League, league leaders Marseille welcomed closest challengers PSG in a match that would determine the title. After Marseille won their fifth consecutive championship, Bernard Tapie and Marseille were found guilty of match-fixing, in what became known as the French football bribery scandal. The French Football Federation stripped Marseille of their title and offered it to second-placed PSG, who refused it because club owners Canal+ thought that claiming the trophy would anger their subscribers back in Marseille. As a result, the 1992–93 title remained unattributed, with Canal+ even refused letting the capital club participate in next year&#x27;s UEFA Champions League after UEFA excluded Marseille from the competition. Instead, Monaco, who finish third in Ligue 1 took the Champions League spot instead.

Considered the club&#x27;s golden era, the Parisians won nine trophies and reached five consecutive European semi-finals during the 1990s, including their first UEFA Champions League last-four appearance and two at the same stage of the UEFA Cup. PSG&#x27;s crowning glory came in the 1996 UEFA Cup Winners&#x27; Cup Final with legend Luis Fernandez now as coach. Bruno Ngotty scored the only goal of the match to defeat Rapid Wien and make Paris the second French club to ever clinch a major European tournament and the youngest club in history to win a European title at 26 years of existence. The following season, PSG finished runners-up in the 1996 UEFA Super Cup and 1997 UEFA Cup Winners&#x27; Cup Final. On the domestic scene, results were just as satisfying, with Paris celebrating a second league title, three French Cups, two French League Cups and just as many French Super Cup wins.

===Crisis mode and relegation battles (1998–2011)===

PSG then went into decline following years of mismanagement. In the summer 2000, PSG spent heavily on new players signing Nicolas Anelka, Peter Luccin and Stéphane Dalmat as part of the &quot;PSG Banlieue&quot; project of its shareholder Canal+, with the goal of winning Ligue 1 and performing a solid UEFA Champions League campaign but it was a failure. In 2003, the club faced a massive financial loss with a deficit of €65 million, leading Canal+ to fire Luis Fernandez as coach and Laurent Perpère as president and replacing them with Vahid Halilhodžić, who became the new coach and Francis Graille the new president. The club&#x27;s form dwindled as they slipped further down the table and eventually, a split from owners Canal+ became inevitable.

At the start of the 21st century, PSG struggled to rescale the heights despite the magic of Ronaldinho and the goals of Pauleta. Five more trophies arrived in the form of three French Cups (including one against &quot;Le Classique&quot; arch-rivals Marseille in 2006), one French League Cup and one UEFA Intertoto Cup, but the club became better known for lurching from one high-profile crisis to another.

The French premium television channel sold the club to Colony Capital in 2006. The situation, however, only got worse and PSG spent the 2006–07 and 2007–08 campaigns staving off relegations. The latter was the most dramatic. Marred by poor results and fan violence, Paris avoided the drop on the final match after a 2–1 win at Sochaux. The hero was Ivorian striker Amara Diané who scored both goals that night. Despite not enjoying the star status of other current or past PSG greats, Diané is still considered a legend by most Parisian fans.

===QSI ownership and domestic dominance (2011–present)===
After two years of solid progress and stability under the stewardship of manager Antoine Kombouaré and president Robin Leproux, the fortunes of Paris Saint-Germain changed dramatically when Qatar Sports Investments (QSI) purchased the club in 2011. The takeover made PSG not only the richest club in France but one of the wealthiest in the world. Club president Nasser Al-Khelaifi pledged to form a team capable of winning the UEFA Champions League and making the club France&#x27;s biggest name.
Club legend Leonardo was brought back in as sporting director and oversaw a spending spree in summer 2011 that has so far been unprecedented in Ligue 1 history, including the signings of Blaise Matuidi, Salvatore Sirigu, Maxwell, Kevin Gameiro and Javier Pastore. As a result, the Parisians have dominated French football, despite finishing behind Montpellier in 2011–12, the elusive league crown was finally brought back to Paris in 2012–13 driven by star player Zlatan Ibrahimović, team captain Thiago Silva and manager Carlo Ancelotti. During the season, ahead of the winter transfer deadline it was announced that David Beckham signed a five-month deal with the club. Ibrahimović&#x27;s 30-goal haul helped the capital side to its first Ligue 1 title in 19 years, and third overall. They also became a regular in the knockout stages of the Champions League, being eliminated from the UEFA Champions League on away goals by Barcelona in the quarter-finals after drawing both games. Big money signings continued with the arrivals of Edinson Cavani in 2013 for a league record of €64 million, making it the sixth largest transfer in history and David Luiz in 2014 for a £50 million transfer fee, a world-record transfer for a defender. Despite the departure of Ancelotti, PSG kept its winning ways under Laurent Blanc. The club secured a maiden domestic treble (Ligue 1, Coupe de la Ligue and Trophée des Champions) in the 2013–14 season, before claiming an unprecedented national quadruple (Ligue 1, Coupe de France, Coupe de la Ligue and Trophée des Champions) twice in a row in 2014–15 and 2015–16, winning the latter with a record-breaking 96 points, becoming the only first French men&#x27;s team to achieve that feat.

Fresh from three consecutive UEFA Europa League titles with Sevilla, Unai Emery was hired by PSG for his European pedigree. But with star player Ibrahimović gone, the club endured a disappointing 2016–17 season. Paris were pipped to the Ligue 1 title by Monaco, missing out on top spot for the first time in five years. Meanwhile, in the Champions League, the club suffered several disappointing nights, including &quot;La Remontada&quot; (&quot;The Comeback&quot;) against Barcelona, losing 6–1 in the second leg of the round of sixteen, despite winning the first leg in France by a score of 4–0.
In response, PSG signed Neymar for a world-record fee of €222 million and French prodigy Kylian Mbappé on an initial loan, which was made permanent in 2018 in a transfer worth €180 million plus add-ons, making him both the second-most expensive player and most expensive teenager. The capital club reclaimed the Ligue 1 title and also won the Trophée des Champions, the Coupe de la Ligue and the Coupe de France, clinching the domestic quadruple for the third time in four seasons. Despite their massive expenditure, in the Champions League, PSG lost to Real Madrid in the round of 16, leading Unai Emery to leave the club at the end of the season.

In May 2018, Thomas Tuchel signed a two-year contract with PSG and in the 2019–20 season, PSG won the Ligue 1 for the 9th time in their history, despite the season ending prematurely due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and also reclaimed the Coupe de France defeating Saint-Étienne in the final and won the last-ever Coupe de la Ligue defeating Lyon in a penalty shootout. In the 2019–20 UEFA Champions League, PSG reached the semi-finals for the second time since 1995, after a last minute 2–1 win over Atalanta, before losing to Bayern Munich 1–0 in the final in Lisbon, with former PSG player Kingsley Coman scoring the only goal.
During the 2021 summer transfer season, PSG completed one of the most historic transfer windows in football history, exercising the option to buy Danilo Pereira and signing Achraf Hakimi from Inter Milan for a reported fee of €60 million. In addition, the club registered the free transfers of Georginio Wijnaldum, Sergio Ramos, and Gianluigi Donnarumma. PSG concluded their transfer window with the signing of one of the greatest players of all time and record Ballon d&#x27;Or winner Lionel Messi, who unexpectedly left Barcelona following the expiration of his contract, and promising defender Nuno Mendes on an initial loan, which was made permanent in 2022. Later in the season, PSG went on to reclaim the Ligue 1 title for the record 10th time. 

Unsatisfied with the club direction and lack of European success club president Nasser Al-Khelaifi promised changes heading into next season and stated the team would not win the UEFA Champions League as currently constructed. Changes were needed at the club on a very deep level and as such during the pre season for the 2022–23 season the club embarked on an ambitious rebuild, most notably with the hiring of transfer market expert Luís Campos as football advisor.

===Colours and mascot===

Since their foundation, Paris Saint-Germain have represented both the city of Paris and the nearby royal town of Saint-Germain-en-Laye. As a result, red, blue and white are the club&#x27;s traditional colours. The red and blue are Parisian colours, a nod to revolutionary figures Lafayette and Jean Sylvain Bailly, and the white is a symbol of French royalty and Saint-Germain-en-Laye.

On the club&#x27;s crest, the Eiffel Tower in red and the blue background represent Paris, while the fleur de lys in white is a hint to the coat of arms of Saint-Germain-en-Laye. The fleur de lys is a royal symbol as well and recalls that French King Louis XIV was born in the town. Throughout its history, PSG have brandished several crests, but all of them have featured the club&#x27;s three historical colours.

Likewise, PSG&#x27;s most iconic shirts have been predominantly red, blue or white, with the remaining two colours included as well. The club&#x27;s official mascot, Germain the Lynx, also sports PSG&#x27;s traditional colours. It was unveiled during the 2010 Tournoi de Paris in commemoration of the club&#x27;s 40th anniversary, and can be seen entertaining kids in the stands of the Parc des Princes or near the pitch with the players during the warm-up.

===Anthems and mottos===
&quot;Allez Paris!,&quot; recorded by Belgian actress and singer Annie Cordy in 1971, was the club&#x27;s first official anthem. A PSG fan from the start, she was part of an association of hundreds of celebrities who contributed to the foundation of the club in 1970. The club&#x27;s second anthem, &quot;Allez Paris-Saint-Germain!&quot; by Les Parisiens, was recorded in 1977, replacing Cordy&#x27;s version. The brainchild of historical PSG leader and music producer Charles Talar, he produced and released it under his homonym record label. The song&#x27;s chorus became a popular chant among PSG supporters during games. A new version, also called &quot;Allez Paris-Saint-Germain!&quot;, was recorded in 2010 as part of the club&#x27;s 40th anniversary celebrations. Sung to the tune of &quot;Go West&quot; by Village People, the lyrics were rewritten with suggestions made by fans. This is the club&#x27;s current official anthem.

&quot;Ô Ville Lumière&quot; (), to the tune of &quot;Flower of Scotland&quot;, is another veritable club anthem for PSG supporters. Other notable chants from supporters&#x27; groups in the Boulogne and Auteuil stands include &quot;Le Parc est à nous&quot; (), &quot;Ici, c&#x27;est Paris!&quot; (), and &quot;Paris est magique!&quot; (). Both stands began exchanging these chants during PSG matches in the 1990s. &quot;Ici, c&#x27;est Paris!&quot; and &quot;Paris est magique!&quot; are also the club&#x27;s most iconic mottos. &quot;Who Said I Would&quot; by Phill Collins is also a traditional anthem for the fans. The song has accompanied the players&#x27; entry into the field since 1992.

===Iconic shirts===
During their first three seasons of existence, the home shirt of Paris Saint-Germain was red with blue and white details in its sleeves and neck to bring together the three colours of the club: the red and blue of Paris, and the white of Saint-Germain-en-Laye. During the 2010–11 season, PSG wore a red shirt during home matches to commemorate their 40th anniversary.

The connection between Paris Saint-Germain and the city&#x27;s fashion houses is a longstanding one. French fashion designer Daniel Hechter became PSG president in 1973 and designed the club&#x27;s traditional home look that same year: a blue shirt with a red vertical stripe flanked by two thinner white stripes (blue-white-red-white-blue). First worn in the 1973–74 season, the so-called &quot;Hechter shirt&quot; has remained the classic home identity of PSG ever since.

The famous jersey made its debut during a home Ligue 2 game against Red Star on 10 November 1973. This was also the club&#x27;s maiden match at the Parc des Princes. PSG won 3–1 as Othniel Dossevi scored the club&#x27;s first goal at the stadium as well as the first with the Hechter shirt. PSG stars from the 1990s and 2000s like Raí, Ronaldinho and Pauleta are associated with this kit. While wearing it, the capital club reached five European semi-finals in a row between 1993 and 1997, claimed the 1995–96 UEFA Cup Winners&#x27; Cup and achieved eight consecutive wins against &quot;Le Classique&quot; arch-rivals Olympique de Marseille between 2002 and 2004.

The general belief is that Hechter based his creation on the red-and-white jersey worn by Ajax, the dominant team in Europe at the time, but with the French flag in mind. Hechter himself has denied this, though, instead claiming he was inspired by the Ford Mustang. He transposed the car&#x27;s hood stripes on the shirt and employed the three colours of the club. The Hechter shirt has two alternate versions: the &quot;reversed Hechter&quot; (red-white-blue-white-red), introduced in the 1974–75 season, and the &quot;white Hechter&quot; (white-blue-red-blue-white), which premiered in the 1994–95 season.

It was with the club&#x27;s most iconic away outfit, though, that fans saw the first big PSG team which won their maiden French Cup titles in 1982 and 1983, experienced their first European campaign in 1983, and claimed their maiden Ligue 1 crown in 1986. The shirt was white with blue and red vertical stripes on the left. Like the Hechter jersey, it debuted in the 1973–74 season as the away kit. Promoted by PSG president Francis Borelli, the white shirt was the club&#x27;s home identity from 1981 to 1990. Now known as the &quot;Borelli shirt,&quot; it is synonym with PSG legends from the 1980s like Safet Sušić, Luis Fernández and Dominique Bathenay.

In 2025 shirts included a design in Arabic writing for the first time; they were worn in Doha on 5 January for the Trophée des Champions match. The design was created by calligrapher Fatma Al Sharshani.

===Crest evolution===

The club&#x27;s first crest was basically the same as the original Paris FC (PFC) logo. Having to merge and give birth to PSG using Stade Saint-Germain&#x27;s stadium, the PFC crest kept its original design but the name below it changed from &quot;Paris FC&quot; to &quot;Paris Saint-Germain Football Club.&quot; This badge consisted of a blue football with a red vessel inside it. The latter is a historic symbol of Paris and is present in the city&#x27;s coat of arms. The name of the club was written below in red.

PSG, however, split from PFC in 1972 and thus needed a new crest. Representing both Paris and Saint-Germain-en-Laye, the club&#x27;s second crest became the basis of the one the fans know today. The round logo featured the Eiffel Tower in red against a blue background and, underneath it, two Saint-Germain symbols in white: a fleur de lys and Louis XIV&#x27;s cradle. Created by Christian Lentretien, former PSG board member and publicist by profession, this crest was first used in 1972 and lasted until 1982. The Parc des Princes, the club&#x27;s home stadium, appeared below it between 1982 and 1990.

The stadium was dropped from the crest in 1990. Two years later, then club owners Canal+ radically changed it in 1992. The new model had the acronym &quot;PSG&quot; in white against a blue-white-red-white-blue background (like the colour pattern of the Hechter shirt) with &quot;Paris Saint-Germain&quot; underneath in white against a black background. Under pressure from supporters, the traditional crest returned in 1995 with &quot;Paris Saint-Germain&quot; above the tower and &quot;1970&quot; below the cradle. This logo went through a slight facelift in 2002, most notably featuring a darker shade of blue.

At the request of the club&#x27;s Qatari owners, the traditional crest underwent a major makeover in 2013. &quot;Paris&quot; is now written in big white bold letters above a large Eiffel Tower, clearly putting forward the brand &quot;Paris&quot; instead of &quot;Paris Saint-Germain&quot;. Underneath it, &quot;Saint-Germain&quot; is written in smaller letters below the fleur de lys. The cradle and the club&#x27;s founding year &quot;1970&quot; were left out. PSG deputy general manager Jean-Claude Blanc said: &quot;We are called Paris Saint-Germain but, above all, we are called Paris&quot;.

===Friendly tournaments===
Paris Saint-Germain used to host two very famous invitational competitions: the Tournoi de Paris and the Tournoi Indoor de Paris-Bercy. Regarded as French football&#x27;s most prestigious friendly tournament, the Tournoi de Paris is considered a precursor of both the Intercontinental Cup and the FIFA Club World Cup. PSG began hosting it in 1975 and were crowned champions a record seven times. Held at the Parc des Princes, the Tournoi de Paris was last organized in 2012. The Tournoi Indoor de Paris-Bercy was an indoor football tournament founded by PSG in 1984 and held annually until 1991 at the AccorHotels Arena in the 12th arrondissement of Paris. Played indoors on a synthetic field and featuring seven-a-side teams, the competition featured hosts PSG and five more clubs. The Parisians lifted the trophy on two occasions, more than any other club.

==Grounds==

===Stadiums===

Since its inception, Paris Saint-Germain have played in five main stadiums: the Stade Jean-Bouin, the Stade Georges Lefèvre, the Stade Bauer, the Stade Yves-du-Manoir, and the Parc des Princes, their current home ground. PSG took on Ligue 2 promotion rivals Red Star on 10 November 1973, for the club&#x27;s first match at the Parc des Princes. It was the curtain-raiser for that season&#x27;s opening Ligue 1 match between Paris FC and Sochaux. PSG moved into the ground upon its return to Ligue 1 in July 1974, ironically the same year that Paris FC were relegated. Up until that point it had hosted Paris FC, who showed reluctance towards PSG playing there.

From that moment on, the Parc des Princes has been the home stadium of PSG. Its most prolific season in terms of average attendance is 2019–20, during which an average of 47,517 spectators went to the stadium for each match. The attendance record for a PSG match dates back to 13 March 1983, with 49,575 spectators present in the stands of the Parc des Princes. This match pitted PSG against Belgian side Waterschei for the UEFA Cup Winners&#x27; Cup quarterfinals. The final score was a 2–0 victory for the Parisians.

During the 1970–71 season, the club played at the Stade Jean-Bouin, concurrently with the Stade Georges Lefèvre. The Jean-Bouin was privileged given that it drew significantly greater levels of fan support. The Georges Lefèvre regularly hosted PSG matches from 1972 to 1974 as well. Between 1904 and 1970, it was the home of Stade Saint-Germain, club which merged with Paris FC to form PSG in 1970. PSG played again at the Jean-Bouin in 1973–74, alternating their home games with the Georges Lefèvre and the Parc des Princes.

PSG played at the Stade de Paris, today known as Stade Bauer, for the first time during the 1971–72 season. It was used again by the club once in 1976–77 and 1977–78, and twice in 1978–79 due to construction work on the lawn of the Parc des Princes. Similarly, the Stade Olympique Yves-du-Manoir, as its officially called, welcomed PSG for three matches in 1971–72, once more in 1974–75, and one last time in 1975–76 because the Parc des Princes was under renovation.

===Training facilities===

Campus PSG has been the club&#x27;s training ground since July 2023. Located in Poissy, it replaced the Camp des Loges, PSG&#x27;s historical training facility. Owned and financed by the club, the venue brings together PSG&#x27;s male and female football, handball and judo teams, as well as the football and handball academies. Each division have its own dedicated facilities. Campus PSG will have a stadium, which will complement the club&#x27;s home ground of the Parc des Princes. It is due to be built during the second phase of the project, after 2024. PSG&#x27;s male team moved into Campus PSG on 10 July 2023. They completed their first group training session there on 18 July 2023, and played their first game on 21 July 2023. It was a friendly match against Le Havre which ended in a 2–0 victory for PSG.

The Camp des Loges is a training ground located in Saint-Germain-en-Laye. It hosted PSG&#x27;s male team from July 1970 to June 2023. The venue also turned into the training facilities of the club&#x27;s academy when it opened on 4 November 1975. The current version of the Camp des Loges opened in November 2008, and is the second to have been built on the site, with the first opening its doors in June 1904. It was renamed Ooredoo Training Centre, as part of a sponsorship deal with Ooredoo, in September 2013. The complex hosted the training sessions of the club&#x27;s female team between June 2023 and January 2024. The men&#x27;s team left the Camp des Loges for Campus PSG in July 2023. The club&#x27;s academy and female team moved to the new site in January 2024. Rugby union club Stade Français are expected to become the new tenants of the Camp des Loges in the summer of 2024.

==Records and statistics==

Paris Saint-Germain holds many records, most notably being the most successful French club in history in terms of official titles won, with 50. They are the record holders of all national competitions, having clinched twelve Ligue 1 championships, fourteen Coupe de France, nine Coupe de la Ligue, and twelve Trophée des Champions. Their trophy cabinet also includes one Ligue 2 title. In international football, PSG have claimed one UEFA Cup Winners&#x27; Cup and one UEFA Intertoto Cup.

Their victory in the 1995–96 UEFA Cup Winners&#x27; Cup makes PSG the sole French side to have won this trophy, one of only two French clubs to have won a major European competition, and the youngest European team to do so. They are also the only side to have won the Ligue 1 title after being at the top of the table from the first until the last round (2022–23), the Coupe de France without conceding a single goal (1992–93 and 2016–17), five Coupe de la Ligue in a row (2014–2018), four back-to-back Coupe de France (2015–2018), and eight consecutive Trophée des Champions (2013–2020).

PSG have won all four national titles in a single season on four occasions. This feat is known as the domestic quadruple. The Red and Blues have completed the domestic double, the league and league cup double, the domestic cup double, the domestic treble and the league three-peat several times as well. Therefore, PSG are the club with the most domestic doubles and league and league cup doubles, one of two sides to have achieved the league three-peat twice, and the only team to have won the domestic cup double, the domestic treble and the domestic quadruple.

Since their inception, PSG have completed 53 seasons, of which 50 have been played in the highest division in French football, known as Ligue 1. In 2022–23, they celebrated their 49th consecutive campaign in Ligue 1, which makes them the competitions&#x27;s longest-serving club. PSG have played continuously in Ligue 1 from the 1974–75 season onwards. Since then, the Parisians have won twelve league titles, finishing first more frequently than in any other position. Having come second in nine league campaigns, PSG have therefore made up the top two spots on 21 occasions. They have also reached the top five 29 times, which represents more than half of the club&#x27;s seasons in Ligue 1. PSG&#x27;s lowest-ever finish is 16th, both in 1971–72 (their first in Ligue 1) and 2007–08, when they escaped relegation on the final day of the season, with a 2–1 win at Sochaux.

==Supporters==

Paris Saint-Germain is the most popular football club in France and one of the most widely supported teams in the world. Famous PSG fans include Nicolas Sarkozy, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Tony Parker, Victoria Azarenka, Yannick Noah, Jean-Paul Belmondo, Booba, Tom Brady, Fabio Quartararo, Patrick Dempsey, DJ Snake, Pierre Gasly, Mireille Mathieu, and Teddy Riner.

Lacking a big passionate fanbase, the club began offering cheaper season tickets to young supporters in 1976. These fans were placed in the Kop K, located in the K section of the Borelli stand at the Parc des Princes. Following an increase in ticket prices, Kop K supporters moved to the Boulogne stand in 1978, and the Kop of Boulogne (KoB) was born. There, the club&#x27;s first Italian-style ultra group, Boulogne Boys, was founded in 1985. Other KoB groups, however, took British hooligans as dubious role models and violence rapidly escalated. PSG supporters&#x27; groups have been linked to football hooliganism ever since.

PSG owners Canal+ responded in 1991 by encouraging and financing non-violent fans of the KoB stand to take place in the Auteuil stand at the other end of the Parc des Princes. The Virage Auteuil was born, alongside Supras Auteuil, its most notorious ultras. At first the measure worked but, slowly, a violent rivalry arose between the two stands. Things came to a head in 2010 before a match against Olympique de Marseille in Paris. Boulogne fan Yann Lorence was killed following a fight between groups from both stands outside the Parc des Princes, forcing PSG president Robin Leproux to take action.

The club exiled the supporters&#x27; groups from the Parc des Princes and banned them from all PSG matches in what was known as Plan Leproux. It made PSG pay the price in terms of atmosphere, with one of Europe&#x27;s most feared venues now subdued. For their part, former Virage Auteuil supporters formed the Collectif Ultras Paris (CUP) in February 2016, with the aim of reclaiming their place at the stadium. In October 2016, after a six-year absence, the club agreed to their return. Grouped in the Auteuil end of the stadium, the CUP currently is the only ultra association officially recognized by PSG. The ultra movement has also started to come back to life in the Boulogne stand. New groups Block Parisii and Résistance Parisienne are trying to convince the club of relaunching the Kop of Boulogne.

==Rivalries==
===Le Classique===
Paris Saint-Germain shares an intense rivalry with Olympique de Marseille; matches between the two teams are referred to as Le Classique. The clubs are the two most successful clubs in French football, and the only French teams to have won major European trophies. Therefore, the fixture is the biggest rivalry in France.

PSG and OM were the dominant teams prior to the emergence of Olympique Lyonnais in the 2000s, and are the most followed French teams internationally. Both clubs are at or near the top of the French attendance lists each season. Their meetings during the 1970s gave little indication the two would become major adversaries. The newly formed Parisians were trying to assemble a competitive team, while the Olympians were Ligue 1 contenders.

The rivalry began in earnest in 1986 when PSG won their first championship and OM was bought by Bernard Tapie. By the end of the decade, PSG was fighting for the 1988–89 title against Tapie&#x27;s Marseille. The accusations made by PSG president Francis Borelli against Tapie and OM for fixing matches during that season were a contributor to their growing rivalry.

In the 1990s, tensions between the two sides escalated. French TV channel Canal+ bought PSG in 1991 with the aim of breaking Marseille&#x27;s hegemony but then agreed with Tapie to emphasize the animosity between them as a way to promote the league. With equivalent financial backing, PSG and OM became the main contenders in the title race. Both sides were less successful in the late 1990s and the 2000s but the rivalry remained strong. Since the 2010s, the matchup has been dominated by PSG, and the significant investment of their Qatari owners has created a wide gap between the clubs.

==Ownership and finances==

Paris Saint-Germain were initially fan-owned and had 20,000 members. The club was run by board members Guy Crescent, Pierre-Étienne Guyot and Henri Patrelle. A group of wealthy French businessmen, led by Daniel Hechter and Francis Borelli, would then buy the club in 1973. PSG changed hands in 1991, when Canal+ took over, and then again in 2006 with the arrival of Colony Capital. Qatar Sports Investments (QSI) have been the majority owners of PSG since 2011, currently holding 87.5% of the shares. Arctos Partners owns the remaining 12.5%.

Backed by the Qatari government, QSI acquired a majority stake in 2011 and then became the Parisian outfit&#x27;s sole owner in 2012. PSG are therefore a state-owned club, which makes them one of the wealthiest teams in the world. In 2023, Arctos Partners acquired a minority stake in the Qatar-funded French team. QSI chairman Nasser Al-Khelaifi has been PSG president since the takeover. However, Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, the Emir of Qatar, has the final word on every major decision of the club. He is both the chairman of the QIA and the founder of QSI.

Upon its arrival, QSI pledged to form a team capable of winning the UEFA Champions League. PSG have spent over €1.9bn on player transfers since the summer of 2011. These massive expenditures have translated in PSG&#x27;s domination of French football but have not yet brought home the coveted UCL trophy as well as causing problems with UEFA&#x27;s Financial Fair Play regulations.

PSG currently have the third-highest revenue in the footballing world with annual earnings of €806m according to Deloitte, and are the world&#x27;s seventh-most valuable football club, worth $4.4bn according to &quot;Forbes&quot; magazine. This financial growth has been supported by PSG&#x27;s Qatari owners; the team&#x27;s on-pitch success; high-profile signings, including Zlatan Ibrahimović, Neymar, Kylian Mbappé and Lionel Messi; and lucrative sponsorship deals with the Qatar Tourism Authority, Nike, Air Jordan, Accor and Qatar Airways.

<doc id="357495" wikidata="Q219199" url="?curid=357495" title="Cream-colored courser">
<text>The cream-colored courser (Cursorius cursor) is a species of wader in the pratincole and courser family, Glareolidae. Both parts of the scientific name derive from Latin &quot;cursor&quot;, &quot;runner&quot;, from &quot;currere&quot;, &quot;to run&quot; which describes their usual habit as they hunt their insect prey on the ground in dry open semi-desert regions of the Middle East and northern Africa.

==Range==
Cream-colored coursers are found in the Canary Islands, Cape Verde, North Africa and Southwest Asia. Their two eggs are laid in a ground scrape. The breeding season extends from February to September, but they may breed also in autumn and winter when local conditions (especially rainfall) are favourable. They are partially migratory, with northern and northwestern birds wintering in India, Arabia and across the southern edge of the Sahara. Some birds also breed in the southern desert regions in northwestern India and Pakistan.

They are rare north of the breeding range, but this species has occurred as far away as Finland, Ireland and Great Britain.

==Description==
Cream-colored coursers have long legs, long wings, and slightly downcurved bills. The body plumage is sandy in colour, fading to whitish on the lower belly. The upperwing primary feathers and the underwings are black. The crown and nape are grey, and there is a black eyestripe and white supercilium.

In flight, this species resembles a pratincole with its relaxed wingbeats, pointed wings and dark underwings.

==Subspecies==
There are three subspecies of the cream-colored courser:

* &quot;C. c. cursor&quot;, : Canary Islands, North Africa Arabian Peninsula to Iraq
* &quot;C. c. bogolubovi&quot;, : southeast Turkey to Iran, Afghanistan, South Pakistan to northwest India 
* &quot;C. c. exsul&quot;, : Cape Verde Islands

==Taxonomic note==
Hayman&#x27;s &quot;Shorebirds&quot; treats the east African form &quot;littoralis&quot; as a race of the Somali courser rather than of cream-colored. Some authorities in turn consider the Somali, Burchell&#x27;s and cream-colored coursers to be conspecific.

<doc id="357499" wikidata="Q630638" url="?curid=357499" title="Preserved counties of Wales">
<text>The preserved counties of Wales () are the eight current areas used in Wales for the ceremonial purposes of lieutenancy and shrievalty. They are based on the counties which were used for local government and other purposes between 1974 and 1996. Each comprises one or more of the 22 single-tier principal areas which are used for administrative purposes.

==Usage==
The Local Government (Wales) Act 1994 abolished the eight ceremonial counties created by the Local Government Act 1972. However, it created the concept of preserved counties based on their areas, to be used for purposes such as lieutenancy. This usage was consolidated by the Lieutenancies Act 1997. Certain statutes already in force were amended to include reference to them.

==Boundary changes==
The preserved counties were originally almost identical to the 1974–96 counties, but with a few minor changes in line with local government boundary changes: Llanrhaeadr-ym-Mochnant, Llansilin and Llangedwyn were transferred from Clwyd to Powys, and Wick, St Brides Major, Ewenny and Pentyrch were transferred from Mid Glamorgan to South Glamorgan. There were however two local government areas, Caerphilly and Conwy, split between preserved counties.

The Local Government Boundary Commission for Wales were instructed by the National Assembly for Wales on 11 March 2002 to undertake a review of preserved county boundaries. In their final proposals the part of the local government area of Caerphilly which had been in Mid Glamorgan was to be part of Gwent and the part of the local government area of Conwy which had been in Gwynedd was to be part of Clwyd. The boundary between Mid Glamorgan and South Glamorgan was also to be re-aligned to reflect small changes in local government boundaries. The Assembly accepted these proposals such that from 2 April 2003 each preserved county encompassed between one and five whole local government areas.

The boundary between West Glamorgan and Powys was further modified on 1 April 2005 as a result of boundary changes between Ystalyfera and Ystradgynlais.

The boundary between Mid Glamorgan and Powys was further modified on 1 April 2010 to reflect the 2009 local government boundary changes in the area around Vaynor, Merthyr Tydfil.

<text>David Rupert (born July 27, 1951) is an American former FBI/British intelligence agent whose testimony led to the arrest and prosecution of Michael McKevitt, the reputed leader of the Real IRA, for the Omagh Bombing.

==Background==
David Rupert was awarded the FBI&#x27;s Lou Peters Award in 2013.

==Testimony==
Rupert&#x27;s testimony was crucial in McKevitt being convicted of directing terrorism. In 2006, McKevitt&#x27;s legal team appealed the conviction based on the defense team not having access to information concerning the tax affairs of Rupert during the original trial. All appeals were denied.

<text>Annie is a musical with music by Charles Strouse, lyrics by Martin Charnin, and a book by Thomas Meehan. It is based on the 1924 comic strip &quot;Little Orphan Annie&quot; by Harold Gray (which in turn was inspired from the poem Little Orphant Annie by James Whitcomb Riley). The original Broadway production opened in 1977 and ran for nearly six years, setting a record for the Alvin Theatre (now the Neil Simon Theatre). It spawned numerous productions in many countries, as well as national tours, and won seven Tony Awards, including for Best Musical. The musical&#x27;s songs &quot;Tomorrow&quot; and &quot;It&#x27;s the Hard Knock Life&quot; are among its most popular musical numbers.

==Background==
Martin Charnin first approached Thomas Meehan to write the book of a musical about &quot;Little Orphan Annie,&quot; in 1972. Meehan researched, by rereading prints of the comic strip, but he was unable to find any satisfactory material for a musical, other than the characters of Annie, Oliver Warbucks, and Sandy, so, he decided to write his own story. As Meehan, Charnin, and Charles Strouse were all from New York, and given what he saw as the downbeat mood of the then-current Nixon era and Vietnam War, Meehan set his story in New York during the similarly downbeat Great Depression. Meehan saw the character of Annie as a 20th-century American female version of the main orphan characters created by Charles Dickens in works such as &quot;Oliver Twist&quot; and &quot;David Copperfield,&quot; with the mystery of Annie&#x27;s abandonment and unknown parenthood as consistent with a strand of mysteries in Dickens&#x27; tales. Meehan&#x27;s book was accepted by Charnin and Strouse, but considerable material had to be trimmed out – material which Meehan would later restore for his novelization.

==Plot==

===Act 1===
In 1933, in New York City, eleven-year-old Annie sleeps in an orphanage, with many other girls her age. When six-year-old Molly wakes up from a bad dream, Annie comforts her, by singing about her own parents; even though they abandoned her at the orphanage, as a baby, she holds on to the hope that they will come back for her (&quot;Maybe&quot;). Annie decides to escape to find her parents, but she is caught by Miss Hannigan, the cruel keeper of the orphanage. To punish Annie&#x27;s behavior, she forces all the girls to clean, and they lament the terrible conditions of the orphanage (&quot;It&#x27;s the Hard Knock Life&quot;). Later on, Bundles, the laundry man, comes in to pick up the blankets, allowing Annie to escape in his truck. Miss Hannigan realizes she&#x27;s gone and chases after the truck. The other orphans cheer her on, but await punishment, when Hannigan returns (&quot;Hard Knock Life (Reprise)&quot;).

Annie escapes, running into a friendly stray dog. She tells him of better days to come (&quot;Tomorrow&quot;). She fools a police officer into believing he is her dog, named Sandy. Later, Annie and Sandy stumble upon a Hooverville, a shanty town full of formerly well-off people suddenly rendered homeless by the Great Depression. They sarcastically toast the former president (&quot;We&#x27;d Like to Thank You, Herbert Hoover&quot;). The shanty town is broken up by the cops, who take Annie back to the orphanage, where Miss Hannigan punishes her with extra chores.

At the orphanage, Miss Hannigan vents her frustration at being surrounded by children (&quot;Little Girls&quot;). Grace Farrell, the assistant to the billionaire, Oliver Warbucks, comes to the orphanage, asking for an orphan to spend Christmas at his mansion. Seeing how poorly Miss Hannigan treats Annie, Grace insists on taking her.

At Warbucks&#x27;s mansion, Grace introduces Annie to the staff and explains that she will have every luxury available (&quot;I Think I&#x27;m Gonna Like It Here&quot;). Oliver Warbucks returns and isn&#x27;t happy to have Annie in his mansion, having assumed all orphans were boys. Warbucks instructs Grace to take her to a movie, while he works, but when he realizes that Annie has never seen New York, he decides to take her there, himself, walking the 45 blocks to the Roxy and seeing New York City in all of its glory (&quot;N.Y.C.&quot;).

Grace pays Miss Hannigan a visit to tell her that Warbucks wants to officially adopt Annie. Hannigan becomes furiously envious that the orphan she hated so much will suddenly have everything. Her ne&#x27;er-do-well brother Rooster and his girlfriend, Lily, drop by, in hopes of a handout. When Miss Hannigan mentions that Annie is going to be adopted by Warbucks, Rooster realizes they can use this situation to their advantage to bring Annie back to Miss Hannigan, before it&#x27;s too late (&quot;Easy Street&quot;).

Having noticed a broken locket around Annie&#x27;s neck, Warbucks buys her a new, more expensive one from Tiffany&#x27;s. He wonders whether he is ready for such a big change in his life (&quot;Why Should I Change A Thing?&quot;). When he offers Annie the locket and attempts to take off the old one, Annie bursts into tears, as the locket was the only thing left to her by her parents, and she still holds out hope that they will return for her. Warbucks pledges to find her parents, no matter what it takes, calling J. Edgar Hoover to get the Federal Bureau of Investigation on the job (&quot;You Won&#x27;t Be An Orphan For Long&quot;).

===Act 2===
Annie appears on Bert Healy&#x27;s radio show (&quot;Maybe (Reprise)&quot;), where Warbucks announces that he is offering $50,000 to the couple who can prove they are her parents. Healy, then, sings a song with the Boylan Sisters (&quot;You&#x27;re Never Fully Dressed Without a Smile&quot;). At the orphanage, the girls are listening to the show. They joyously sing along (&quot;You&#x27;re Never Fully Dressed Without a Smile (Reprise)&quot;).

A couple claiming to be Annie&#x27;s parents, Ralph and Shirley Mudge, arrive at the orphanage. In fact, they are Rooster and Lily in disguise. They believe they can pass themselves off as Annie&#x27;s parents, with Hannigan&#x27;s help, for which she demands half of the money (&quot;Easy Street (Reprise)&quot;).

Warbucks brings Annie to Washington, D.C., where she meets President Franklin D. Roosevelt. Roosevelt and his Cabinet are inspired by her optimism and decide to make it a cornerstone of their administration (&quot;Tomorrow (Cabinet Reprise)&quot;).

Once back home, Warbucks tells Annie how much he loves her (&quot;Something Was Missing&quot;). Because all the people claiming to be her parents were frauds, he offers, once again, to adopt her, and Annie gleefully accepts. The delighted staff get Annie dressed for the formal adoption proceedings and tell of how her arrival has changed their lives (&quot;Annie&quot;). As Judge Louis Brandeis shows up to begin the adoption proceedings, Warbucks and Annie dance together (&quot;I Don&#x27;t Need Anything But You&quot;).

They are interrupted by Rooster and Lily in disguise. The two present forged documents, as well as the other half of Annie&#x27;s locket, seemingly confirming their story. Warbucks requests that she be allowed to stay one more night, and they can take her away on Christmas morning. The next morning, Annie wonders if her life with her parents will really be as good as her life with Warbucks could have been (&quot;Maybe (Second Reprise)&quot;). Warbucks receives a surprise visit from Roosevelt and his Secret Service. The FBI has learned that Annie&#x27;s parents are actually David and Margaret Bennett, who died long ago in a fire when Annie was a baby. Mr. and Mrs. &quot;Mudge&quot; show up to take Annie along with the money, but are quickly revealed to be none other than Rooster and Lily; the Secret Service arrests them along with Miss Hannigan, for child abuse, and all three villains are sent to a psychiatric hospital for their crimes. Annie is officially adopted by Warbucks, who notes that this Christmas is the beginning of a new life for them, for the orphans (all of whom are adopted by wealthy friends of Warbucks), and for the rest of the country, thanks to Roosevelt&#x27;s New Deal (&quot;A New Deal for Christmas&quot;/&quot;Tomorrow (Second Reprise)&quot;).

==Production history==

&quot;The New York Times&quot; estimates that &quot;Annie&quot; is performed 700 to 900 times, each year, in the United States.

===Pre-Broadway tryout===
&quot;Annie&quot; had its world premiere on August 10, 1976, at the Goodspeed Opera House in East Haddam, Connecticut, under the direction of Michael P. Price. Kristen Vigard was the first actress to play the title role. However, the producers soon decided that Vigard&#x27;s genuinely sweet interpretation was not tough enough for the street-smart orphan. After a week of performances, Vigard was replaced by Andrea McArdle, who had been playing one of the other orphans, Pepper. Vigard went on to become McArdle&#x27;s Broadway alternate.

After the Goodspeed run ended, the role of Miss Hannigan was also recast, as original actor Maggie Task&#x27;s performance was considered too mean. Producer Mike Nichols suggested comedy actress Dorothy Loudon to bring the humour out of the role; in rehearsals, Loudon reportedly improvised numerous elements, including the lines &quot;Do I hear happiness in here?&quot; and &quot;Why any kid would want to be an orphan, I&#x27;ll never know.&quot;

===Broadway original===

The original Broadway production opened at the Alvin Theatre on April 21, 1977, and starred Andrea McArdle as Annie, Reid Shelton as Warbucks, Dorothy Loudon as Miss Hannigan, and Sandy Faison as Grace Farrell, with Danielle Brisebois as Molly, the youngest and smallest orphan. It was nominated for eleven Tony Awards and won seven, including the Best Musical, Best Score, and Best Book at the 31st Tony Awards. Replacements in the title role on Broadway included Shelley Bruce, Sarah Jessica Parker, Allison Smith and Alyson Kirk. Replacements in the role of Miss Hannigan included Alice Ghostley, Dolores Wilson, Betty Hutton, Marcia Lewis, and June Havoc. Ann Ungar understudied and played for Dorothy Loudon in the role of Miss Hannigan. She also understudied Alice Ghostley and Dolores Wilson. &quot;Annie&quot; was evicted from the Alvin Theatre, in September 1981, to make way for &quot;Merrily We Roll Along&quot;, which began its months long journey to finding a new permanent home. On September 16, the show moved to ANTA (now the August Wilson), knowing the production would need to move, again, due to contractual obligations to the new musical &quot;Oh Brother!&quot; On October 29, &quot;Annie&quot; moved to the Eugene O&#x27;Neill Theatre, and finally moved to its final home at the Uris (now the Gershwin) on December 12 to make room for a revised &quot;Little Me&quot;. This move was made possible, partly because of the early closing of the revival of &quot;My Fair Lady&quot;, had originally been scheduled to run through the end of that year. The show closed on January 2, 1983, after a total of 2,377 performances, setting a record for the longest running show at the Alvin Theatre (now the Neil Simon Theatre), until it was surpassed by &quot;Hairspray&quot; in 2009.

===United States national touring companies===
During the Broadway run of &quot;Annie&quot;, there were four touring companies that were launched from the original production to tour to major North American cities:

The first national touring company opened in Toronto in March 1978 with Kathy Jo Kelly as Annie, Norwood Smith as Daddy Warbucks, Jane Connell, Ruth Kobart as Miss Hannigan, and Gary Beach as Rooster. It played in Miami from April 12 to May 13, 1978, then continued for a few more cities until it landed in Chicago where it played for 32 weeks. In April 1979, it continued on the road in with Mary K. Lombardi now in the lead as Annie. In the fall of 1980, Theda Stemler took over the part and was replaced in Boston when she grew too old. On May 15, 1981, Louanne Sirota, who had played Annie in the long-running Los Angeles production, took over the role for four months. In August 1981, Becky Snyder became the company&#x27;s last Annie, closing the tour on September 6, 1981.

The second national touring company (sometimes referred to as the West Coast or Los Angeles production) opened in San Francisco on June 22, 1978, with Patricia Ann Patts starring as Annie, Jennifer Cihi as Pepper and the then-unknown Molly Ringwald as one of the orphans. The show landed in Los Angeles on October 15, 1978, for an open-ended run at the Shubert Theatre. Children&#x27;s television host Tom Hatten played Franklin D. Roosevelt. On June 12, 1979, Sirota, just 9 years old (up until that time, all Annies had been 11 or older), took over the role from Patts. Marisa Morell took the role in December 1979, closing the Los Angeles run and continuing on tour with the show through December 1980. Kristi Coombs (who played the youngest orphan Molly in the first national touring company) then played Annie, until this touring company closed in Hawaii on August 22, 1982. Alyssa Milano played orphan Kate in 1981.

The third national touring company opened in Dallas on October 3, 1979, with Rosanne Sorrentino (who would later go on to portray Pepper in the 1982 film version) in the title role. This company toured to 23 cities playing mostly shorter runs of a month or less. On March 27, 1981, Bridget Walsh took over as Annie. Becky Snyder (who had closed the first national tour) joined this company in the summer of 1982 and stayed with it until it closed in September of that year.

The fourth national touring company opened on September 11, 1981, with Mollie Hall playing Annie. This production was a &quot;bus and truck&quot; tour, with a slightly reduced cast, that traveled the country and often played in two cities a week. This company was still touring when the original Broadway production closed in January 1983, making Kathleen Sisk the final performer to play Annie from the original production team. This tour closed in late March 1983.

===West End original===
The musical premiered in the West End at the Victoria Palace Theatre on May 3, 1978. Andrea McArdle, the original Broadway Annie, played the title role for 40 performances. British 12-year-old Ann Marie Gwatkin was also cast in the title role and appeared on the original London cast recording. The opening night cast and the original cast album recording of children were Claire Hood, Jane Collins, Dawn Napier, Annette Mason, Helen Stephenson, Jackie Ekers and Linda Brewis. Ann Marie Gwatkin alternated with Christine Hyland, and four other Annies were cast at this point: Anne O&#x27;Rourke, Jacinta Whyte, Helen Thorne, Tracy Taylor, who were to play the role over the next year. Suzie Kemeys from South Wales also performed two shows in 1980/81. The first was as July and the second was Annie. ITV Wales commissioned two documentaries about this young Welsh girl and her rise from obscurity to a West End leading lady. Following this, Ann Marie Gwatkin and Jackie Ekers shared the title role, followed by many other casts of Annie. Miss Hannigan was originally played by Sheila Hancock, and later by Maria Charles and Stella Moray; Warbucks was played by Stratford Johns and later by Charles West, with Deborah Clarke playing Pepper in the first year and Melanie Grant playing Molly.

&quot;Annie&quot; closed on November 28, 1981, after 1,485 performances.

===UK tour===
The musical transferred to the Bristol Hippodrome for a special Christmas season before touring Britain. Because of strict British employment laws for juvenile actors, a succession of actresses took on the lead role every four months. One of the last girls to perform the role at the Victoria Palace before the show went on tour was 10-year-old Claudia Bradley from Leeds, who was featured on a 1981 BBC program called &quot;Fame&quot;. She went on to perform on the tour as well.

===Broadway revival (1997)===
A 20th anniversary Broadway revival, which played at the Martin Beck Theatre (now called the Al Hirschfeld Theatre) in 1997, entitled &quot;Annie, the 20th Anniversary&quot;, starred Nell Carter as Miss Hannigan, but controversy surrounded the casting of the titular character. The original actress cast in the role, Joanna Pacitti, was fired and replaced by Brittny Kissinger (who had been playing orphan July) just two weeks before her Broadway debut, while battling bronchitis in Boston. The pre-Broadway tour was playing the Colonial Theatre, when Joanna became sick with bronchitis and missed a few performances. Alexandra Kiesman, the swing orphan and Annie understudy went on the first night Pacitti was out and then the production decided to test Brittny Kissinger in the role, as she&#x27;d been rehearsing as a second understudy. The tour then moved on to Hershey PA where Kissinger (now listed in the Playbill as a second understudy for Annie) performed again in the lead role while Pacitti was out sick. 
The Hershey tour stop would prove to be Pacitti&#x27;s last performance in the show on February 23, 1997. The next tour stop was Oakdale in Connecticut where an insert was placed in the pre-printed programs displaying Pacitti as Annie that read &quot;The role of Annie is now being played by Brittny Kissinger. Public sentiment seemed to side with Pacitti as she was the winner of a highly publicized contest to find a new Annie, sponsored by the department store Macy&#x27;s. This incident, coupled with the mixed reviews the new staging garnered, doomed it to a short run, although it was followed by a successful national tour. Kissinger, then 8, became the youngest actress to ever play Annie on Broadway.

More controversy surrounding the show involved Nell Carter. Carter reportedly was very upset when commercials promoting the show used a different actress, Marcia Lewis, a white actress, as Miss Hannigan. The producers claimed that the commercials, which were made during an earlier production, were too costly to reshoot. Carter felt that racism played a part in the decision. &quot;Maybe they do not want audiences to know Nell Carter is black&quot;, she told the New York Post. However, the ads did mention that Carter was in the show. &quot;It hurts a lot&quot;, Carter told the Post, &quot;I&#x27;ve asked them nicely to stop it — it&#x27;s insulting to me as a black woman.&quot; Later reports stated that &quot;Nell Carter of Broadway&#x27;s &quot;&#x27;Annie&quot;&#x27; denied Thursday that she called her show&#x27;s producers racist because they chose to air commercials featuring a previous Miss Hannigan—who is white—instead of her.&quot; Her statement, released by the Associated Press, read: &quot;&#x27;Yes, it is true that I and my representatives have gone to management on more than one occasion about the commercial and were told that there was nothing they could do about it,&#x27; Carter said in a statement Thursday. &#x27;Therefore, I have resigned myself to the fact that this is the way it is.&#x27; The statement also addressed the alleged charges of racism, first published in Thursday&#x27;s New York Post. Carter is black. &#x27;I, Nell Carter, never, ever, ever accused my producers or anyone in the show of racism,&#x27; she said. Producers have said it is too expensive to film a new commercial.&quot; Carter was later replaced by another white actress, Sally Struthers. The revival closed on October 19, 1997, after 14 previews and 239 performances.

===West End revival (1998)===
The show was revived at the Victoria Palace Theatre, running from September 30, 1998, to February 28, 1999. It starred Lesley Joseph and then Lily Savage (the female alter ego of comedian Paul O&#x27;Grady) as Miss Hannigan and Kevin Colson as Warbucks. The young girls who played Annie were Charlene Barton, Tasha Gold, Libby Gore and Sophie McShera. Orphans included Dominique Moore as documented on &quot;Paddington Green&quot;.

=== 1999–2000 United States tour ===
Starting in August 1999, the post Broadway national tour continued with Meredith Anne Bull as Annie. In the spring of 2000, Ashley Wieronski, who had been playing Duffy, moved up to play Annie. In July 2000, Dana Benedict took over as Annie.

===2000–01 Australian tour===
In 2000/2001, a tour was staged in Sydney, Melbourne, and Brisbane. Anthony Warlow starred as Warbucks with Amanda Muggleton as Miss Hannigan. A new song, &quot;Why Should I Change a Thing&quot;, was written for Warlow. Appearing as Annie in the Sydney production were Rachel Marley and Jodie McGaw. A publicist noted that &quot;each time the show moves to a new city, two casts of seven orphans plus two Annies have to be found to join the adult cast.&quot;

===2001–10 UK tours===
Further UK tours of the show were also staged, including a one-month run at The Theatre Royal in Lincoln in 2001. Members of the original cast included Kate Winney and Jemma Carlisle as Annie, Louise English (Grace), Vicki Michelle (Miss Hannigan) and Simon Masterton-Smith (Warbucks). The show proved to be a success, and so for the first two tours and the Malaysian Genting Highlands Production, the role of Annie was then shared by Faye Spittlehouse and a young Lucy May Barker. Miss Hannigan was later performed by Su Pollard and Ruth Madoc and Daddy Warbucks by Mark Wynter. This particular production toured from 2001 to 2007 and resumed in September 2008. The last tour of this production ended in 2011 with the role of Miss Hannigan still being played by Pollard, David McAlister as Warbucks, Victoria Sian Lewis as Annie, and Simone Craddock as Grace Farrell.

===2005–10 US national tours===
Opening in August 2005, a 30th anniversary traveling production of &quot;Annie&quot; by NETworks Tours embarked on a multi-city tour. This production was directed by Martin Charnin and choreographed by Liza Gennaro (daughter of the show&#x27;s original choreographer, Peter Gennaro). This all-new production with new set designs by Ming Cho Lee, also featured the brand-new song &quot;Why Should I Change A Thing?&quot; (sung by Warbucks). For the first two years of the tour, Conrad John Schuck played Warbucks, reprising the role he played in the original run of &quot;Annie&quot; on Broadway, as well as the 15th Anniversary National Tour and 1997 Broadway revival. Chicago actress, Alene Robertson was Miss Hannigan, Annie was played by Marissa O&#x27;Donnell, Scott Willis played Rooster Hannigan, Elizabeth Broadhurst was Grace Farrell and Mackenzie Phillips performed the role of Lily St. Regis. In December 2006, the tour briefly returned to New York City to play The Theater at Madison Square Garden for Christmas where it broke box office records during the five week stay. Kathie Lee Gifford played Miss Hannigan. This original Equity tour closed on March 25, 2007, at the Hippodrome Theatre in Baltimore, Maryland.

The tour continued non-union for several more years and throughout the run of the show, there were replacements. The 2007-08 tour starred Amanda Balon as Annie, who took over as Molly during the second year. The 2008-09 cast for the tour featured Tianna Stevens as Annie. Early in 2009, Amanda Balon returned temporarily to play the role of Annie until Madison Kerth was rehearsed to play the title role. Also returning were Barton, Andrews and Meisner. Other cast members included Mackenzie Aladjem (Molly). In the 2009-10 tour, Kerth returned as Annie along with most of the previous year&#x27;s cast, adding Jordan Boezem (from Spotlight Kids in Sarasota, Florida) in the role of July.

===2nd Broadway revival (2012-14)===
A 35th Anniversary production opened on Broadway in 2012. Thomas Meehan revised the musical, with James Lapine directing. Lilla Crawford starred as Annie with Katie Finneran as Miss Hannigan, and Anthony Warlow making his long-awaited Broadway debut as Warbucks. Featured cast included Brynn O&#x27;Malley, Clarke Thorell and J. Elaine Marcos as Grace Farrell, Rooster and Lily St. Regis, respectively. The revival started previews at the Palace Theatre on October 3, 2012, and officially opened on November 8, 2012, receiving mixed reviews. Notable replacements include Jane Lynch and Faith Prince as Miss Hannigan. On July 30, Taylor Richardson and Sadie Sink both began alternating the role of Annie, replacing Crawford. This production closed on January 5, 2014, after 38 previews and 487 regular performances.

=== 2014–24 United States tours ===
Starting in September 2014, a 40th anniversary traveling production of &quot;Annie&quot; was launched by TROIKA Entertainment. Directed by Martin Charnin, the tour kicked off in Detroit, Michigan. For the first year of the tour, Issie Swickle played the title character Annie with Faith Perez as her alternate, alongside Gilgamesh Taggett and Lynn Andrews as Warbucks and Miss Hannigan, respectively. There were many replacements throughout the tour, and by the end of it, Gilgamesh Taggett was the only remaining original member. For most of the second year of the tour, Heidi Gray played Annie. For the third and final year of the tour, Tori Bates played Annie and became the first biracial Annie in a professional production. The 40th Anniversary performance was celebrated in Baltimore, Maryland, on April 21, 2017, with Angelina Carballo as Annie. The tour came to a close in Boston, Massachusetts, on May 21, 2017, after 745 performances.

Another tour directed by Jenn Thompson, who played Pepper in the original Broadway production, began October 4, 2022, and ended June 11, 2023, with Ellie Rose Pulsifer as the title role. Another leg of the tour began October 7, 2023, and ended May 19, 2024, with Rainier Trevino playing Annie. Afterwards, the tour moved on to Macau, China, and opened there on August 2, 2024, with the same cast as the 23-24 US tour.

===UK and Ireland tours and West End revival (2015-23)===
A new UK and Ireland tour opened at the Theatre Royal, Newcastle in July 2015 starring Craig Revel Horwood as Miss Hannigan, directed by Nikolai Foster and produced by Michael Harrison and David Ian, with new orchestrations by George Dyer. The production toured until 2016 with Lesley Joseph appearing at some venues and performances as Miss Hannigan.

The production opened in London&#x27;s West End at the Piccadilly Theatre, opening on June 5, 2017 (previews beginning on May 23) for a limited run until January 6, 2018. This was Miranda Hart&#x27;s musical debut as Miss Hannigan (until September 17). The three girls who shared the main role were Madeleine Haynes (reprising her the role from the UK tour), Lola Moxom and Ruby Stokes. From September 19, for a limited 10 week run, Craig Revel Horwood returned to the role of Miss Hannigan, reprising his role from the 2015-16 UK and Ireland tour. The production extended its limited run, with Meera Syal as Miss Hannigan from November 27, through to the show&#x27;s conclusion on February 18, 2018, when it closed to make way for the musical adaptation of &quot;Strictly Ballroom&quot;.

The production began another UK and Ireland tour in February 2019 at the Manchester Opera House starring Anita Dobson as Miss Hannigan, alternating venues with Craig Revel Horwood and Jodie Prenger.

Another UK and Ireland tour began at the Curve in Leicester in February 2023 starring Zoe Akinyosade, Harlie Barthram, and Sharangi Gnanavarathan sharing the title role, with Craig Revel Horwood, Paul O&#x27;Grady, Jodie Prenger and Elaine C. Smith alternating venues as Miss Hannigan, after previously performing the role in previous tours and West End runs. After performing the role in Newcastle-upon-Tyne and Edinburgh, O&#x27;Grady died on March 28, 2023.

===Hollywood Bowl production, 2018===
For its annual fully staged musical event, the Hollywood Bowl produced a limited run of &quot;Annie&quot; from July 27–29, 2018, directed by Michael Arden. The cast included Kaylin Hedges as the title role, Roger Bart as Rooster, Ana Gasteyer as Miss Hannigan, David Alan Grier as Warbucks, Megan Hilty as Lily St. Regis, Lea Salonga as Grace, Ali Stroker as &quot;Star to Be&quot;, and Steven Weber as Franklin D. Roosevelt.

==Stage sequels==
The first attempt at a sequel, &quot;Annie 2: Miss Hannigan&#x27;s Revenge&quot;, opened at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington, D.C., in December 1989 to universally disastrous reviews. Extensive reworking of the script and score proved futile, and the project was abandoned.

In 1993, a second attempt, with a different plot and score, titled &quot;Annie Warbucks&quot; was developed in a workshop at the Goodspeed Opera House (where the original &quot;Annie&quot; premiered in 1976) under the direction of Michael P. Price. It subsequently opened at the Off Broadway Variety Arts Theatre, where it ran for 200 performances.

==Recordings==
The original Broadway cast recording was made on April 25, 1977, at the Columbia 30th Street Studio in New York City and released that year by Columbia Records. A CD containing bonus tracks was released on September 15, 1998, by Sony (ASIN: B00000AG6Z). The 1995 London studio cast recording, featuring the National Symphony Orchestra, stars Sarah French as Annie, Kim Criswell as Miss Hannigan and Ron Raines as Warbucks.

A 30th anniversary cast recording was released in 2008 on Time–Life Records. An all-star cast of former &quot;Annie&quot; cast members includes Carol Burnett, Sally Struthers, Kathie Lee Gifford, Andrea McArdle, John Schuck, Harve Presnell, Gary Beach and Amanda Balon. The rest of the cast is made up of the members of the 30th Anniversary Tour. This recording is a double CD set and includes the entire show as it is performed now on the first disc. The second disc includes songs from the sequel, &quot;Annie 2: Miss Hannigan&#x27;s Revenge&quot;, as well as songs that were cut from or added to the original production. There is also a song from the 1977 TV special &quot;The Annie Christmas Show&quot;. The booklet is made up of original drawings by Philo Barnhart, who is the creator of Ariel and Ursula in &quot;The Little Mermaid&quot;, and is presented in a comic book style. The album was produced by music producer Robert Sher.

==Novelizations==
===Thomas Meehan===
In 1980, Macmillan Books published Meehan&#x27;s novelization of his script for the musical, later reprinted by Puffin Books in 2014. Several of the lyrics from songs from the show were adapted into dialogue and monologue for the novelization. The main lyrics of &quot;Tomorrow&quot; are depicted as being Annie&#x27;s personal mantra, while &quot;Little Girls&quot; becomes a self-pitying monologue by Miss Hannigan alone in her office moments before Annie is returned to her and then taken away by Grace Farrell. On the other hand &quot;You&#x27;re Never Fully Dressed Without a Smile&quot; is replaced by the slogan &quot;Smile, darn ya, smile&quot; and others such as &quot;It&#x27;s the Hard Knock Life&quot; are dispensed with entirely. Meehan used the novel to restore material cut from his original storyline and develop the Annie story into his original concept of what he considered to be a 20th-century female American version of Charles Dickens&#x27; &quot;Oliver Twist.&quot;

The novel goes into greater depth regarding the backgrounds of many of the characters, and particularly about hardship at the orphanage, at which brutal beatings and emotional abuse from Miss Hannigan are everyday occurrences. Unlike the high camp portrayal of Miss Hannigan in most productions of the musical, the novelization – in the tradition of Dickens&#x27; &quot;Oliver Twist&quot; – emphatically depicts her as a truly sinister and malevolent villainess – &quot;a skinny hatchet faced woman with short jet-black hair (who) reminded the orphans of a particularly unpleasant looking – and all too real – Halloween witch&quot;.

A greater emphasis is placed on the sheer drudgery and illegality of the orphans&#x27; sewing labours in the orphanage basement. However, whereas in the musical the orphans are not enrolled in school until the final scene, in the novelization they attend a public school, PS62, where they suffer from snobbery from teachers and harassment from non-orphan pupils, particularly from a spoiled rich girl named Myrtle Vandenmeer. The legal name of Rooster&#x27;s girlfriend Lily St. Regis is given in the book as being Muriel Jane Gumper.

In the novel, Annie spends several months on the run from the orphanage, initially spending the winter as a resident staff in Bixby&#x27;s Beanery, a low-grade café run by couple Fred and Gert Bixby, before escaping after she finds Sandy. She then spends several months living in Hooverville with Sophie and the Apple Seller (who is named as G. Randall &quot;Randy&quot; Whitworth Jr, a former stockbroker left destitute by the Depression) who, in the novelization, are adult characters and a couple. It is revealed at the end that Randy, Sophie and all the other Hoovervillites were released from prison and given jobs and homes by Warbucks as gratitude for taking care of Annie. Also reappearing at the end of the book is Sandy, previously written out of the book while fleeing police during the raid on the Hooverville, who it transpires was successfully traced by agents from Pinkerton hired by Warbucks.

===Leonore Fleischer===
A second novelization of &quot;Annie&quot;, by Leonore Fleischer, was published by Random House in 1982. This was a tie-in with the first film and was adapted directly from the screenplay.

==Film and television==
Columbia Pictures acquired the film rights in 1977 for $9.5 million, the most expensive at the time for a stage musical. The film was released in 1982 directed by John Huston, starring Albert Finney as Warbucks, Carol Burnett as Miss Hannigan, Ann Reinking as Grace Farrell, Tim Curry as Rooster, Bernadette Peters as Lily, and newcomer Aileen Quinn as Annie.

A sequel, &quot;&quot; was made for television in 1995. It starred Ashley Johnson, Joan Collins, George Hearn, and Ian McDiarmid. Aside from a reprise of &quot;Tomorrow&quot;, there are no songs in it.

A made-for-TV &quot;Wonderful World of Disney&quot; movie version, produced by The Walt Disney Company and directed by Rob Marshall, was broadcast in 1999; it starred Victor Garber as Daddy Warbucks, Kathy Bates as Miss Hannigan, Audra McDonald as Grace Farrell, Alan Cumming as Rooster, Kristin Chenoweth as Lily, and newcomer Alicia Morton as Annie.

In January 2011, Will Smith announced plans for a remake of &quot;Annie&quot; set in the present day, produced with his wife Jada Pinkett Smith and rapper Jay-Z for release by Columbia Pictures. This version was to star the Smiths&#x27; daughter, Willow, as Annie; but as she had aged out of the part before production began, she was replaced by Quvenzhané Wallis. Directed by Will Gluck and released in 2014, this version of &quot;Annie&quot; also stars Jamie Foxx as Will Stacks (an update of Warbucks), Rose Byrne as Grace Farrell, and Cameron Diaz as Miss Hannigan.

None of these films contain the songs &quot;We&#x27;d Like To Thank You, Herbert Hoover&quot;, &quot;You Won&#x27;t Be an Orphan for Long&quot;, &quot;Annie&quot;, or &quot;A New Deal for Christmas&quot;. The 1982 film additionally omits &quot;N.Y.C.&quot; and &quot;Something was Missing&quot; while adding four new songs. The 2014 film contains the songs common to both films, remixed to various degrees, while adding three new songs.

A documentary film, &quot;Life After Tomorrow&quot;, was directed and produced by one of the original Broadway and national tour orphans, Julie Stevens and partner, Gil Cates Jr. It reunites more than 40 women who played orphans in the show and reveals the highs and lows of their experiences as child actresses in a cultural phenomenon. The film premiered on Showtime and was released on DVD in 2008.

In May 2021, NBC announced a live television production of &quot;Annie&quot; with Robert Greenblatt and Neil Meron as executive producers as a &quot;holiday event&quot; in 2021. The production was aired on December 2 of that year. It was directed by Lear deBessonet, and starred Celina Smith as Annie, Taraji P. Henson as Miss Hannigan, Harry Connick Jr. as Oliver Warbucks, Nicole Scherzinger as Grace Farrell, Tituss Burgess as Rooster Hannigan, and Megan Hilty as Lily St. Regis.

==&quot;Annie Jr.&quot;==
Annie Jr. is a musical licensed by Music Theatre International&#x27;s Broadway Junior collection, specially edited to be performed by children in a shortened form. It is performed internationally every year by acting academies, programs, schools, and theatre camps. MTI also licenses another youth version of the show, called &quot;Annie KIDS&quot;, a 30-minute length version meant for elementary-aged performers.

===Stage differences (1977 musical)===
The songs &quot;We&#x27;d Like to Thank You Herbert Hoover&quot;, &quot;A New Deal for Christmas&quot;, &quot;Something Was Missing&quot; and &quot;Tomorrow (Cabinet Reprise)&quot; were cut. There is only one version of &quot;You&#x27;re Never Fully Dressed Without a Smile&quot;, which is sung by the orphans. There are only two &quot;Maybe&quot; reprises. The song &quot;You won&#x27;t Be an Orphan For Long&quot; only features Annie and Daddy Warbucks. The songs &quot;Easy Street&quot;, &quot;NYC&quot;, and &quot;Little Girls&quot; were also shortened. Many of the songs have been transposed down a few keys to make them easier for amateur child actors to sing. The last verses of &quot;Little Girls&quot; was removed and added again as a reprise later in the same scene.

==Pop culture references==
&quot;Annie&#x27;s&quot; popularity is reflected in its numerous mentions in popular media. References to the show appear in films such as &quot;Austin Powers in Goldmember&quot;, where Dr. Evil (Mike Myers) and Mini-Me (Verne Troyer) perform Jay-Z&#x27;s version of the song &quot;Hard Knock Life (Ghetto Anthem)&quot;; and in the 1994 John Waters dark comedy &quot;Serial Mom&quot;, where Mrs. Jenson (Patsy Grady Abrams) is bludgeoned to death with a leg of mutton by the titular serial killer Beverly Sutphin (Kathleen Turner) while watching the 1982 film version and singing along. It is parodied in &quot;Reefer Madness: The Movie Musical&quot;, where President Franklin D. Roosevelt (Alan Cumming) shows up as the &quot;deus ex machina&quot; at the end of the satirical musical to tell the assembled crowd, &quot;A little orphan girl once told me that the sun would come out tomorrow. Her adopted father was a powerful billionaire, so I suppressed the urgeto laugh in her face, but now, by gum, I think she may have been on to something!&quot;

References in television series include:
* In an episode of &quot;House&quot;, Dr. Gregory House (Hugh Laurie) references &quot;little orphan Annie&quot; and &quot;Oliver Twist&quot;.
* An episode of &quot;SCTV&quot;, features a spoof commercial of the &quot;original&quot; cast, now older adults still playing their kid roles, performing the 8,000th performance of &quot;Annie&quot;.
* Stephanie Tanner (Jodie Sweetin) of &quot;Full House&quot; sings songs from the musical in several episodes.
* On &quot;30 Rock&quot;, Liz Lemon (Tina Fey) is discovered in her office after-hours listening to music on her headset and singing &quot;Maybe&quot;.
* The stop-motion comedy show &quot;Robot Chicken&quot; parodied &quot;Annie&quot; in episodes, including &quot;Maurice Was Caught&quot;.
* In &quot;Makeover&quot;, an episode of &quot;Glee&quot;, Sarah Jessica Parker as Isabelle Wright with Kurt Hummel (Chris Colfer) and Rachel Berry (Lea Michele) sing &quot;You&#x27;re Never Fully Dressed Without A Smile&quot;.
* In the Netflix series &quot;Haters Back Off&quot;, Miranda Sings (Colleen Ballinger) and her family attempt to mount a backyard production of &quot;Annie&quot; (with extensive book and score revisions) in the episode &quot;Staring in a Musicall&quot;.
* In the animated show, &quot;Hazbin Hotel&quot;, the character Alastor (Amir Talai) references &quot;Annie&quot; by telling another character &quot;Smile, my dear. You know, you&#x27;re never fully dressed without a smile.&quot; Furthermore, &quot;You&#x27;re Never Fully Dressed Without A Smile&quot; and the character Bert Healy were the inspirations for Alastor&#x27;s character and singing voice.
* In the episode of &quot;The Big Bang Theory&quot;, &quot;The Maternal Combustion&quot;, Howard Wolowitz (Simon Helberg), Raj Koothrappali (Kunal Nayyar) and Stuart Bloom (Kevin Sussman) sing &quot;It&#x27;s a Hard Knock Life&quot; while cleaning the kitchen.
The song &quot;Tomorrow&quot; is sung in many media references, including in &quot;Roseanne&quot;, by Darlene Conner (Sara Gilbert) and Becky Conner (Lecy Goranson); by Chandler Bing (Matthew Perry) in &quot;Friends&quot;, by Elizabeth Masterson (Reese Witherspoon) in &quot;Just Like Heaven&quot;; by Donkey (Eddie Murphy) in the CGI movies &quot;Shrek II&quot; and &quot;Shrek Forever After&quot;; and in a commercial for Lowe&#x27;s Hardware promoting their next-day delivery. The climax of the animated film &quot;Igor&quot; involved a giant monster named Eva (Molly Shannon) performing &quot;Tomorrow&quot;.

Other prominent media references include the following:
* Producer The 45 King heavily sampled &quot;It&#x27;s the Hard-Knock Life&quot; from the original Broadway cast recording on rapper Jay-Z&#x27;s single &quot;Hard Knock Life (Ghetto Anthem)&quot; (1998).
* The NFL Network produced two Super Bowl ads in 2004 and 2005 featuring &quot;Tomorrow&quot;. A series of football celebrities who were retired or did not make it to that year&#x27;s Super Bowl would sing the song, ending with the caption &quot;Tomorrow, we&#x27;re all undefeated again.&quot;
* Comedian Zach Galifianakis lip-synced to a recording of &quot;Tomorrow&quot; during his monologue on the March 12, 2011, episode of &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; while dressed as Annie.
* In &quot;The Lego Ninjago Movie&quot;, a scene of the character Lloyd Garmadon (Dave Franco) returning to his home while reflecting on his life plays &quot;It&#x27;s the Hard-Knock Life&quot;.
* In season 3, episode 4 (&quot;Gently Falling Rain&quot;) of &quot;The Orville&quot;, the Krill attended a performance of Annie during peace negotiations on Earth and a young alien girl sings &quot;Tomorrow&quot;.

<text>The Lichfield Gospels (also known as the St Chad Gospels, the Book of Chad, the Llandeilo Gospels, the St Teilo Gospels and variations of these) is an 8th-century Insular Gospel Book housed in Lichfield Cathedral. There are 236 surviving pages, eight of which are illuminated. Another four contain framed text. The pages measure 30.8 cm by 23.5 cm. The manuscript is also important because it includes, as marginalia, some of the earliest known examples of written Old Welsh, dating to the early part of the 8th century. The art historian Peter Lord dates the book at 730, placing it chronologically before the Book of Kells but after the Lindisfarne Gospels.

Marginal entries indicate that the manuscript was in the possession of the church of St Teilo in Wales at some point in the 9th century and eventually came into the possession of Lichfield Cathedral during the 10th century.

The manuscript was rebound in 1962 by Roger Powell; it was then discovered that the pages had been trimmed during the rebinding of 1707, and the manuscript had been cut into single leaves in the rebinding of 1862. In 2010, Bill Endres, then at the University of Kentucky, led efforts to digitise the manuscript.

In 2014, Endres returned to Lichfield Cathedral and used Reflectance Transformation Imaging (RTI) to capture the drypoint writing in the Lichfield Gospels. One drypoint entry on p. 226 shows the contributions of women during the early medieval period: its listing of three Anglo-Saxon female names suggests that women worked in the scriptorium at Lichfield.

==Provenance==
Scholars view four places as possible sites for the making of the Lichfield Gospels: Ireland, Northumbria, Wales, and Lichfield. Paleographic and stylistic similarities link it to Northumbria and Iona: the painting techniques resemble those of the Lindisfarne Gospels and the Book of Kells. Some scholars interpret the Welsh marginalia as indicating that this great gospel book was likely written in Wales, perhaps at Llandeilo Fawr or other site in South Wales. However, in 1980, Wendy Stein made an extensive argument for Lichfield, viewing Wales as unlikely but Ireland and Northumbria as still possible. In 1996, by studying the type of paper, pigmentation, and style of text, researcher Pamela James concluded that the most likely place of origin for the manuscript was Lichfield itself. In 2003, the discovery of the Lichfield Angel, an Anglo-Saxon stone carving of an angel that had been buried in Lichfield Cathedral, provided further evidence for that conclusion. Sharp (2016) has drawn similarities to motifs in the Gospels with goldwork in the Staffordshire Hoard. But without definitive evidence, this debate is likely to continue.

Based upon style, the actual making of the book may be placed between 698 and 800. Patterns of interlaced birds on the cross-carpet page (p. 216) strikingly resemble the ornament on a cross shaft from Aberlady, Lothian, a Northumbrian site of the mid-8th century: the author/artist of the book and the sculptor of the cross-shaft ornament may have had a similar source for their designs. Although it is unknown how the book came to be in Lichfield, it was certainly there by the end of the 10th century. The opening folio contains a faded signature reading &quot;Wynsige presul&quot;, which probably refers to the Wynsige who was Bishop of Lichfield from about 963 to 972–5. Folio 4 contains a reference to Leofric, who was bishop from 1020 to 1026.
Wherever the book originated and however it came to Lichfield, it has been there since the 10th century. In 1646, during the English Civil War, Lichfield Cathedral was sacked and its library looted. The books and manuscripts were given to Frances, Duchess of Somerset, who returned them in 1672 or 1673. This is probably when the second volume of the Gospels was lost. Precentor William Higgins is credited with saving the remaining volume.

The book was put on public display in 1982. The bishops of Lichfield still swear allegiance to the Crown on the Lichfield Gospels.

Other Insular illuminated manuscripts of possible Welsh origin include the Ricemarch Psalter and the Hereford Gospels.

==Text and script==

The extant manuscript contains the Gospels of Matthew and Mark, and the early part of the Gospel of Luke. The Latin text is written in a single column and is based on the Vulgate. The manuscript has almost 2000 variances from the Vulgate, almost a third of which it shares with the Hereford Gospels. There are fewer variations in the text that agree with the MacRegol Gospels and the Book of Armagh; 370 agree with the Book of Kells and 62 with the Lindisfarne Gospels.

The script is predominantly Insular majuscule but has some uncial characteristics and is thus called semi-uncial. The regularity of script suggests a single scribe; however, some evidence suggests that possibly four scribes copied the manuscript. The script forms strong links between the Lichfield manuscript and Northumbrian, Iona, and Irish manuscripts.

==Decoration==

The manuscript has two evangelist portraits (St Mark and St Luke); a carpet page, which so closely resembles the working technique of Eadfrith that it should be attributed to him; incipit pages for Matthew (&quot;Lib&quot; of &quot;Liber&quot;), Mark (&quot;Ini&quot; of &quot;Initium&quot;), and Luke (&quot;Q&quot; of &quot;Quoniam&quot;); a Chi Rho monogram page, and a page with the four symbols of the evangelists. Unfortunately, Matthew&#x27;s incipit page is severely worn, appearing to have functioned as the manuscript&#x27;s front cover for a number of years. Matthew&#x27;s gospel includes four framed pages: the Genealogy of Christ (3 pages) and Matthew&#x27;s last page.

==Marginalia==

There are eight marginal inscriptions written in Latin and Old Welsh, which are some of the earliest extant written Welsh. The first records in Latin the gift of the manuscript &quot;to God on the altar of St Teilo&quot; by a man named Gelhi, who had bought the manuscript for the price of his best horse from Cingal. In her treatment of the Book of Kells, Françoise Henry reported Lichfield&#x27;s provenance in similar terms: &quot;The Book of Lichfield was exchanged for a horse in the late eighth century and given to the sanctuary of S. Tellio at Llandaff where it remained until the tenth century, when it was transferred to the Cathedral of Lichfield.&quot; The &quot;altar of St Teilo&quot; has in the past been associated with the monastery at Llandaff but, as it has been determined that the third, fourth and sixth marginal inscriptions refer to lands within fifteen miles of Llandeilo Fawr, it is now thought that the book spent time there. The second such inscription contains a unique example of early Welsh prose recording the details of the resolution of a land dispute. These two inscriptions have been dated to the mid-9th century. The marginalia were edited by John Gwenogvryn Evans with John Rhys in their 1893 edition of the Book of Llandaff.

Gifford Thomas-Edwards and Helen McKee have also identified nine dry-point glosses – glosses that are scratched into parchment without ink and so are only visible from an angle and hard to decipher. The first and final groups of three are decipherable as Anglo-Saxon personal names and it is likely that the others are as well. In order, they appear in the glosses as follows:


It is possible that there are other glosses on this text, and on other Insular gospel books, that are yet to be identified. The names themselves might be significant if they can be dated, as the provenance of the manuscript is uncertain. An 8th-century date would show that the gospel book was in Anglo-Saxon territory before arriving in Wales, whereas a date after the end of the 10th century (at Lichfield) would add little to what is already known – although a dating either way does little to rule out its having been produced in Ireland or Northumbria for a Welsh or Mercian ecclesiastic centre.

Furthermore, it is very difficult to discern whether the same hand wrote the text, the gospels and dry-point glosses unless the letters show signs of a later development in style. Dry-point glosses are etched into the vellum rather than produced by a smooth flow of a quill over a writing surface. G. Charles-Edwards and H. McKee believe they have identified such features, elements of the letters in the glosses that appear to be a late-9th-century invention, in response to Carolingian minuscule. Therefore, it is likely that these glosses were additions after the Gospels had been moved to Lichfield.

<text>The Facts of Life is an American television sitcom created by Dick Clair and Jenna McMahon and a spin-off of &quot;Diff&#x27;rent Strokes&quot; that originally aired on NBC from August 24, 1979, to May 7, 1988, making it one of the longest-running sitcoms of the 1980s. The series focuses on Edna Garrett (Charlotte Rae), as she becomes a housemother (and from the second season onward, a dietitian as well) at the fictional Eastland School, an all-girls boarding school in Peekskill, New York.

==Plot==
===Season 1===
A spin-off of &quot;Diff&#x27;rent Strokes&quot;, the series featured the Drummonds&#x27; former housekeeper Edna Garrett (Charlotte Rae) working in a new job as the housemother of a dormitory at Eastland School, a private all-girls school in Peekskill, New York. The girls in her care included spoiled rich girl Blair Warner (Lisa Whelchel); the youngest, gossipy Dorothy &quot;Tootie&quot; Ramsey (Kim Fields), and impressionable Natalie Green (Mindy Cohn).

The backdoor pilot for the show was originally aired as the last episode of the first season of &quot;Diff&#x27;rent Strokes&quot; and was called &quot;The Girls&#x27; School (a.k.a. Garrett&#x27;s Girls).&quot; The plot line for the pilot had Kimberly Drummond (Dana Plato) requesting that Mrs. Garrett help her sew costumes for a student play at the East Lake School for Girls, the school Kimberly attended in Upstate New York, as her dorm&#x27;s housemother had recently quit. Mrs. Garrett agrees to help, puts on a successful play and also solves a problem for the boyfriend-obsessed Nancy Olsen (Felice Schachter) as she also meets Blair; Tootie; Sue Ann Weaver (Julie Piekarski), a small-town girl from Kansas, and the budding social activist Molly Parker (Molly Ringwald). Mrs. Garrett is asked to stay on as the new housemother but says she would rather continue working for the Drummonds at the end of the pilot.

After the backdoor pilot, the name of the school was changed to Eastland and new characters were added with Natalie, athletic tomboy Cindy Webster (Julie Anne Haddock), and Mr. Bradley becoming part of the main group featured. Although Kimberly Drummond is featured as a student at Eastland, her character did not cross over to the spinoff series with Mrs. Garrett. In the show&#x27;s first season, episodes focus on the issues of seven girls, with the action usually set in a large, wood-paneled common room of a girls&#x27; dormitory. Also appearing was the school&#x27;s headmaster, Mr. Steven Bradley (John Lawlor) and Miss Emily Mahoney (Jenny O&#x27;Hara), an Eastland teacher who was dropped after the first four episodes. Early episodes of the show typically revolve around a central morality-based or &quot;lesson teaching&quot; theme. The show&#x27;s pilot episode plot included a storyline in which Blair Warner insinuates that her schoolmate Cindy Webster is a lesbian, because she is a tomboy and frequently shows affection for other girls. Other season one episodes deal with issues including drug use, sex, eating disorders, parental relationships, and peer pressure.

===Seasons 2–8===
The producers felt that there were too many characters given the limitations of the half-hour sitcom format and that the plotlines should be more focused to give the remaining girls more room for character development. Four of the original actresses—Julie Anne Haddock (Cindy), Julie Piekarski (Sue Ann), Felice Schachter (Nancy) and Molly Ringwald (Molly)—were written out of the show, although the four did make periodic guest appearances in the second and third seasons, and all but Molly Ringwald appeared in one &quot;reunion&quot; episode in the eighth season. Mr. Bradley&#x27;s character was also dropped and replaced by Mr. Charles Parker (Roger Perry). Mr. Parker appeared in episodes through the beginning of season 5. In addition to being housemother to the remaining girls, Mrs. Garrett became the school dietitian as the second season began. Jo Polniaczek (Nancy McKeon), a new student originally from the Bronx, arrived at Eastland on scholarship. A run-in with the law forced the four to be separated from the other girls and work in the cafeteria, living together in a spare room next to Mrs. Garrett&#x27;s bedroom. The season two premiere of the retooled series saw an immediate ratings increase. By its third season (1981–82), &quot;Facts of Life&quot; had become NBC&#x27;s No. 1 comedy and No. 2 overall NBC program, beating its predecessor, &quot;Diff&#x27;rent Strokes&quot;, for the first time.

In 1983, Jo and Blair graduated Eastland Academy in the highly anticipated season four finale &quot;Graduation&quot;. To keep the four girls under one roof, in the season five premiere, &quot;Brave New World&quot;, Mrs. Garrett went into business for herself and opened a gourmet food shop named Edna&#x27;s Edibles. The four girls came to live and work with Mrs. Garrett in the new refreshed space. In September 1985, NBC moved the seventh season of the series to its burgeoning Saturday night lineup at 8:30, as a lead-in for the new series &quot;The Golden Girls&quot; at 9 pm. In an attempt to refresh the &quot;ratings work horse&quot; and increase ratings, George Clooney was added to the regular cast and Mrs. Garrett&#x27;s store was gutted by fire in the season seven premiere &quot;Out of the Fire&quot;. The follow-up episodes &quot;Into the Frying Pan&quot; and &quot;Grand Opening&quot; had the girls join together to rebuild the store with a pop culture-influenced gift shop, called Over Our Heads. The changes proved successful as all three episodes placed in the top ten ratings each week. By the end of the season, &quot;TV Guide&quot; reported, &quot;&quot;Facts&quot;″ success has been so unexpected that scions of Hollywood are still taken aback by it... &quot;Facts&quot; has in fact been among NBC&#x27;s top-ranked comedies for the past five years. It finished twenty-seven overall for the 1985–1986 season, handily winning its time slot against its most frequent competitors, &quot;Airwolf&quot; and &quot;Benson&quot;. Lisa Whelchel stated, &#x27;We&#x27;re easily overlooked because we&#x27;ve never been a huge hit; we just sort of snuck in there.&#x27;&quot;

Charlotte Rae initially reduced her role in seasons six and seven and later decided to leave the series altogether, believing she had done all she could do with her character and desiring to move on to other projects. In season eight&#x27;s heavily promoted one-hour premiere, &quot;Out of Peekskill&quot; Mrs. Garrett married the man of her dreams and joined him in Africa while he worked for the Peace Corps. Mrs. Garrett convinces her sister, Beverly Ann Stickle (Cloris Leachman), to take over the shop and look after the girls. The character of Beverly Ann had a similar personality to Leachman&#x27;s previous Emmy-winning role as Phyllis Lindstrom on two 1970s CBS sitcoms–&quot;The Mary Tyler Moore Show&quot; and &quot;Phyllis&quot;. Beverly Ann later legally adopted Over Our Heads worker Andy Moffett (Mackenzie Astin) in the episode &quot;A Boy About the House&quot;. Describing the new changes to &quot;The Facts of Life&quot;, Brandon Tartikoff, the president of NBC Entertainment, said he &quot;was surprised that &quot;The Facts of Life&quot; performed well this season, as, with a major cast change and all, I thought it might not perform as it had in the past. &quot;Facts&quot; has been renewed for next season.&quot;

===Final season===
In the ninth and final season, the series aired on NBC&#x27;s Saturday lineup at 8 pm; NBC still had confidence in the series, making it the 8 p.m. anchor, kicking off the network&#x27;s second-highest rated night (after Thursdays). For the February Nielsen rating sweeps, the writers created a controversial storyline in this season for the episode titled &quot;The First Time&quot;. Natalie became the first of the girls to lose her virginity. Lisa Whelchel refused to do this storyline that would have made her character, not Natalie, the first among the four young women in the show to lose her virginity. Having become a Christian when she was 10, Whelchel would not say the lines because of her religious convictions. Whelchel appeared in every episode of the show but asked to be written out of &quot;The First Time&quot;. The episode ran a parental advisory before it began and placed 22nd in the ratings for the week. With the show still easily winning its timeslot, NBC had made plans to renew &quot;The Facts of Life&quot; for a 10th season but two castmates–Mindy Cohn and Nancy McKeon–chose to leave at the conclusion of season nine.

==Cast==
===Main characters===

===Recurring characters===
A key recurring character was Geri Tyler (Geri Jewell), Blair&#x27;s cousin who has cerebral palsy. Jewell&#x27;s character primarily was created in order to show Blair&#x27;s more sympathetic side but Cousin Geri eventually inspired many other people with disabilities interested in the entertainment industry. Other recurring characters included the judgment-impaired Miko Wakamatsu (Lauren Tom), the delivery boy Roy (Loren Lester) who was enamored with Jo, the royal princess Alexandra (Heather McAdam) and the snobbish Boots St. Clair (Jami Gertz). Shoplifter Kelly (Pamela Segall) was billed as a regular during the fifth season. Other guest roles included the boyfriends of the girls; Jo&#x27;s parents, played by Alex Rocco and Claire Malis; Blair&#x27;s parents, played by Nicolas Coster and Marj Dusay; Tootie&#x27;s parents, played by Chip Fields (Kim Fields&#x27;s real-life mother) and Robert Hooks and Natalie&#x27;s parents, played by Norman Burton and Mitzi Hoag. Characters from &quot;Diff&#x27;rent Strokes&quot; also appeared in some episodes of both season one and season two. Other recurring characters included Tootie&#x27;s boyfriend Jeff Williams (Todd Hollowell), Blair&#x27;s boyfriend Cliff (Woody Brown), and Charles Parker (Roger Perry), who served as headmaster of Eastland following Lawlor&#x27;s exit from the show. Also, Robert Romanus appeared in 4 episodes as &#x27;Snake Robinson&#x27;.

==Production==
===Development===
&quot;The Facts of Life&quot; was produced first by T.A.T. Communications Company, later known as Embassy Television (Norman Lear&#x27;s production companies) and then as Embassy Communications and Columbia Pictures Television (through ELP Communications) on January–May 1988 episodes of the series. Sony Pictures Television currently owns the distribution rights to the sitcom. From 1979 until 1982 the show was produced at Metromedia Square in Los Angeles. In 1982, production moved to Universal City Studios and then to Sunset Gower Studios in 1985.

===Theme music===
The show&#x27;s theme song was composed by Al Burton, Gloria Loring, and her then-husband, Alan Thicke. The first season lyrics began &quot;There&#x27;s a place you gotta go / For learnin&#x27; all you ought to know / About the facts of life,&quot; sung partly by the cast.

Later seasons opened with &quot;You take the good, you take the bad / You take them both, and there you have / The facts of life,&quot; sung by Loring. The original lyrics shifted to the closing credits before being dropped entirely. Burton, Loring, and Thicke had previously composed the theme to &quot;Diff&#x27;rent Strokes&quot;, which was sung by Thicke.

==Episodes==
===Television films===
====&quot;The Facts of Life Goes to Paris&quot;====
&quot;The Facts of Life Goes to Paris&quot;, a two-hour TV movie in which Mrs. Garrett and the girls travel to France, aired September 25, 1982. It ranked 22nd for the week, with an 18.1 rating and a 31 share. The movie was later added to the American syndication package, separated into four half-hour episodes; however, the original cut of the film appears on the Season 4 DVD set in 2010. The TV movie was directed by Asaad Kelada.

====&quot;The Facts of Life Down Under&quot;====
&quot;The Facts of Life Down Under&quot;, another two-hour TV movie, aired Sunday, February 15, 1987 placing a strong No. 13 for the week garnering 21.4/32. This was strategic counterprogramming by NBC, which placed the movie against the conclusion of ABC&#x27;s highly publicized miniseries &quot;Amerika&quot;. The Telemovie was also syndicated as four half-hour episodes in later U.S. airings.

====&quot;The Facts of Life Reunion&quot;====
&quot;The Facts of Life Reunion&quot;, a two-hour TV movie reunion aired on ABC November 18, 2001, in which Mrs. Garrett and the girls are reunited in Peekskill, New York, for the Thanksgiving holiday. It occasionally aired in the United States on ABC Family. Nancy McKeon (Jo) did not appear in the movie due to scheduling conflicts with her then-TV series, &quot;The Division&quot;; her character&#x27;s absence is explained as being on assignment as a police officer.

==Reception==
===Ratings===
&quot;The Facts of Life&quot; was originally not a ratings winner on Friday nights in its summer debut in 1979 or in its second tryout in the spring of 1980. It ranked 74th of 79 shows on the air in the year-end Nielsen ratings and was NBC&#x27;s lowest-rated series. The show was put on hiatus and extensively retooled in preparation for season two. In November 1980, season two of &quot;The Facts of Life&quot; premiered in a Wednesday 9:30 p.m. time slot, where it immediately flourished, peaking in January 1981 with a 27.4 rating and 41 share; it ranked No. 4 for the week. The program became NBC&#x27;s fourth highest-rated scripted series, after &quot;Little House on the Prairie&quot;, &quot;Diff&#x27;rent Strokes&quot; and &quot;CHiPs&quot;. By the third season, the series moved time slots to 9:00 pm. Wednesdays and soon became NBC&#x27;s highest-rated comedy series and NBC&#x27;s No. 2 overall series, after &quot;Real People&quot;. For its seventh season, it moved to Saturdays at 8:30 p.m., to bolster the premiering series &quot;The Golden Girls&quot; at 9 p.m. in the newly formed Saturday night comedy block. At the start of the eighth season, the series was moved forward a half-hour to the toughest time slot on television–Saturday at 8 pm, which brought the ratings down from its season seven high. Still, the series easily won its time slot and garnered high numbers in the coveted teen and 18–49 demographics. One of the highest rated season eight episodes saw the original season one cast return for a mini-reunion. Titled &quot;The Little Chill&quot;, it placed No. 19 for the week with an 18.2 rating and 31 share. In the article &quot;Ratings Top with Teens&quot; appearing in the January 19, 1988 edition of &quot;USA Today&quot;, &quot;The Facts of Life&quot; was ranked as one of the top 10 shows in a survey of 2,200 American teenagers.

==Home media==
On April 21 and 22, 2001, Columbia House released &quot;The Facts of Life: The Collector&#x27;s Edition&quot;, a 10-volume &quot;Best of&quot; the series on VHS (40 episodes in all). With the advent shortly thereafter of TV on DVD and Columbia House&#x27;s eventual move from the direct marketing model of exclusive series, the tapes were discontinued. Sony Pictures Home Entertainment released the first two seasons on DVD in Region 1 on May 9, 2006 with new interviews with most of the cast, including first season regulars Felice Schachter and Julie Anne Haddock. To promote the DVD&#x27;s release, McKeon, Weichel and Cohn appeared together on various TV shows such as &quot;Entertainment Tonight&quot;, &quot;Today&quot;, and &quot;CNN Showbiz&quot; to reminisce about their time on the show and talk about their lives presently; unfortunately, Fields was unable to take part due to other commitments. The third season was released on October 24, 2006. This release failed to match the success of the first and second seasons, sales-wise. The first and second seasons were also released in Region 4 on March 7, 2007. In 2010, Shout! Factory acquired the rights to the series and released the fourth season on Region 1 DVD on May 4, 2010. Special features include &quot;The Facts of Life Goes To Paris&quot;, a made-for-TV-movie (which originally aired a few days prior to the fourth season debut) and a &quot;Know &quot;The Facts&quot;: Trivia Game.&quot; They have subsequently released seasons five through nine on DVD. Mill Creek Entertainment re-released the first and second seasons on DVD on May 20, 2014. It is unknown as to whether or not Mill Creek will release any further seasons. On January 13, 2015, Shout! Factory released &quot;The Facts of Life – The Complete Series&quot; on DVD in Region 1. The 26-disc set contains all 201 episodes of the series as well as the two made-for-TV films (&quot;The Facts of Life Goes to Paris&quot; and &quot;The Facts of Life Down Under&quot;) and other bonus features including an all-new cast reunion. &quot;The Facts of Life Reunion&quot; film is not included in this collection and has yet to be released on DVD.

==Attempted spin-offs==
The various attempts at spin-offs were backdoor pilots, which were shown as episodes of &quot;The Facts of Life&quot;.

*&quot;Brian &amp; Sylvia&quot; – A season two episode in which Tootie and Natalie go to Buffalo, New York to visit Tootie&#x27;s Aunt Sylvia, a black woman (played by Rosanne Katon) who has recently married a white man, played by Richard Dean Anderson (the future star of &quot;MacGyver&quot; and &quot;Stargate SG-1&quot;). Ja&#x27;Net DuBois of &quot;Good Times&quot; played Ethel, who was both Tootie&#x27;s grandmother and Sylvia&#x27;s mother. The episode never developed into a series and in the season five episode &quot;Crossing the Line&quot;, Tootie mentions Brian&#x27;s and Sylvia&#x27;s interracial marriage and says that the two have recently gotten divorced.
*&quot;The Academy&quot; – A season three episode set at Stone Academy, an all-boys military school that was near Eastland. In this episode, the girls at Eastland attended a dance with the boys from the military school. The boys included actors Jimmy Baio, Ben Marley, David Ackroyd, Peter Frechette, and John P. Navin Jr.
*&quot;Jo&#x27;s Cousin&quot; – Another season three episode, in which Jo visits her family in the Bronx, including her cousin Terry, a fourteen-year-old girl (played by Megan Follows) going through adolescence in a family full of men. The family included actors Grant Cramer, John Mengatti, Donnelly Rhodes, and D.W. Brown.
*&quot;The Big Fight&quot; – A season four episode set at Stone Academy, a boys&#x27; military school. Natalie comes to visit a boy who tries to impress her with his boxing. This episode includes the same cast from the season three episode &quot;The Academy&quot;, with the addition of &#x27;80s &#x27;nerd&#x27; icon Eddie Deezen.
*&quot;Graduation&quot; – This spin-off was to revolve around Blair and Jo&#x27;s life at Langley College.
*&quot;Big Apple Blues&quot; – A season nine episode in which Natalie spends the night with a group of eccentric young people living in a SoHo loft, and decides to remain in New York to begin her life. Two of the tenants in the loft were played by David Spade and Richard Grieco.
*&quot;The Beginning of the End/Beginning of the Beginning&quot; – The two-part series finale sees Blair buying Eastland to prevent its closing. Blair finds that the school is in such dire financial straits that she is forced to make the school co-ed. Blair then essentially adopts the Mrs. Garrett role as she presides over the school and is forced to deal with the trouble-making students in a plot line that is highly reminiscent of the season two premiere. The new Eastland students included Seth Green, Mayim Bialik, Meredith Scott Lynn, and future Oscar-nominee Juliette Lewis.

==Cancelled Revival==
After the re-creation of an episode of the series in a 2021 &quot;Live in Front of a Studio Audience&quot; special, Mindy Cohn said Norman Lear suggested a revival because the special was so popular. Cohn claimed in a July 2024 interview on &quot;Jeff Lewis Live&quot; on Sirius XM that the new series was well into the planning stages when one cast member she would not name went behind the other actress’s and tried to secure a separate deal for a spinoff for that actress character. It created an enormous rift between the group and the deal was pulled. Although Cohn suggested she and the unnamed co-star talk again, she said the revival is &quot;very dead.&quot;

<text>The Royal Astronomical Society (RAS) is a learned society and charity that encourages and promotes the study of astronomy, solar-system science, geophysics and closely related branches of science. Its headquarters are in Burlington House, on Piccadilly in London. The society has over 4,000 members, known as fellows, most of whom are professional researchers or postgraduate students. Around a quarter of Fellows live outside the UK.

The society holds monthly scientific meetings in London, and the annual National Astronomy Meeting at varying locations in the British Isles. The RAS publishes the scientific journals &quot;Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society&quot;, &quot;Geophysical Journal International&quot; and &quot;RAS Techniques and Instruments&quot;, along with the trade magazine &quot;Astronomy &amp; Geophysics&quot;.

The RAS maintains an astronomy research library, engages in public outreach and advises the UK government on astronomy education. The society recognises achievement in astronomy and geophysics by issuing annual awards and prizes, with its highest award being the Gold Medal of the Royal Astronomical Society. The RAS is the UK adhering organisation to the International Astronomical Union and a member of the UK Science Council.

== History ==

The society was founded in 1820 as the Astronomical Society of London to support astronomical research. At that time, most members were &#x27;gentleman astronomers&#x27; rather than professionals. It became the Royal Astronomical Society in 1831 on receiving a Royal Charter from William IV.

In 1846 the RAS absorbed the Spitalfields Mathematical Society, which had been founded in 1717 but was suffering from a decline in membership and dwindling finances. The nineteen remaining members of the mathematical society were given free lifetime membership of the RAS; in exchange, their society&#x27;s extensive library was donated to the RAS.

Between 1835 and 1916 women were not allowed to become fellows, but Anne Sheepshanks, Lady Margaret Lindsay Huggins, Agnes Clerke, Annie Jump Cannon and Williamina Fleming were made honorary members. In 1886 Isis Pogson was the first woman to attempt election as a fellow of the RAS, being nominated (unsuccessfully) by her father and two other fellows. All fellows had been male up to this time and her nomination was withdrawn when lawyers claimed that under the provisions of the society&#x27;s royal charter, fellows were only referred to as &quot;he&quot; and as such had to be men. A Supplemental Charter in 1915 opened up fellowship to women. On 14 January 1916, Mary Adela Blagg, Ella K Church, A Grace Cook, Irene Elizabeth Toye Warner and Fiammetta Wilson were the first five women to be elected to Fellowship.

==Publications==

One of the major activities of the RAS is publishing refereed journals. It publishes three primary research journals: &quot;Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society&quot; for topics in astronomy; &quot;Geophysical Journal International&quot; for topics in geophysics (in association with the Deutsche Geophysikalische Gesellschaft); and &quot;RAS Techniques &amp; Instruments&quot; for research methods in those disciplines. The society also publishes a trade magazine for members, &quot;Astronomy &amp; Geophysics&quot;.

The history of journals published by the RAS (with abbreviations used by the Astrophysics Data System) is:
* &quot;Memoirs of the Royal Astronomical Society&quot; (MmRAS): 1822–1977 
* &quot;Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society&quot; (MNRAS): 1827–present
* &quot;Geophysical Supplement to Monthly Notices&quot; (MNRAS): 1922–1957
* &quot;Geophysical Journal&quot; (GeoJ): 1958–1988
* &quot;Geophysical Journal International&quot; (GeoJI): 1989–present (volume numbering continues from GeoJ)
* &quot;Quarterly Journal of the Royal Astronomical Society&quot; (QJRAS): 1960–1996
* &quot;Astronomy &amp; Geophysics&quot; (A&amp;G): 1997–present (volume numbering continues from QJRAS)
* &quot;RAS Techniques &amp; Instruments&quot; (RASTI): 2021–present
==Membership==
=== Fellows === 
Full members of the RAS are styled Fellows, and may use the post-nominal letters FRAS. Fellowship is open to anyone over the age of 18 who is considered acceptable to the society. As a result of the society&#x27;s foundation in a time before there were many professional astronomers, no formal qualifications are required. However, around three quarters of fellows are professional astronomers or geophysicists. Most of the other fellows are postgraduate students studying for a PhD in those fields, but there are also advanced amateur astronomers, historians of science who specialise in those disciplines, and other related professionals. The society acts as the professional body for astronomers and geophysicists in the UK and fellows may apply for the Science Council&#x27;s Chartered Scientist status through the society. The fellowship passed 3,000 in 2003.

=== Friends ===
In 2009 an initiative was launched for those with an interest in astronomy and geophysics but without professional qualifications or specialist knowledge in the subject. Such people may join the Friends of the RAS, which offers popular talks, visits and social events.

== Meetings ==

The Society organises an extensive programme of meetings:

The biggest RAS meeting each year is the National Astronomy Meeting, a major conference of professional astronomers. It is held over 4–5 days each spring or early summer, usually at a university campus in the United Kingdom. Hundreds of astronomers attend each year.

More frequent smaller &#x27;highlight&#x27; meetings feature lectures about research topics in astronomy and geophysics, often given by winners of the society&#x27;s awards. They are normally held in Burlington House in London on the afternoon of the second Friday of each month from October to May. The talks are intended to be accessible to a broad audience of astronomers and geophysicists, and are free for anyone to attend (not just members of the society). Formal reports of the meetings are published in &quot;The Observatory&quot; magazine.

Specialist discussion meetings are held on the same day as each highlight meeting. These are aimed at professional scientists in a particular research field, and allow several speakers to present new results or reviews of scientific fields. Usually two discussion meetings on different topics (one in astronomy and one in geophysics) take place simultaneously at different locations within Burlington House, prior to the day&#x27;s highlight meeting. They are free for members of the society, but charge a small entry fee for non-members.

The RAS holds a regular programme of public lectures aimed at a general, non-specialist, audience. These are mostly held on Tuesdays once a month, with the same talk given twice: once at lunchtime and once in the early evening. The venues have varied, but are usually in Burlington House or another nearby location in central London. The lectures are free, though some popular sessions require booking in advance.

The society occasionally hosts or sponsors meetings in other parts of the United Kingdom, often in collaboration with other scientific societies and universities.

== Library ==

The Royal Astronomical Society has a more comprehensive collection of books and journals in astronomy and geophysics than the libraries of most universities and research institutions. The library receives some 300 current periodicals in astronomy and geophysics and contains more than 10,000 books from popular level to conference proceedings. Its collection of astronomical rare books is second only to that of the Royal Observatory in Edinburgh in the UK. The RAS library is a major resource not just for the society but also the wider community of astronomers, geophysicists, and historians.

== Education ==
The society promotes astronomy to members of the general public through its outreach pages for students, teachers, the public and media researchers. The RAS has an advisory role in relation to UK public examinations, such as GCSEs and A Levels.

== Associated groups ==
The RAS sponsors topical groups, many of them in interdisciplinary areas where the group is jointly sponsored by another learned society or professional body:
* The Astrobiology Society of Britain (with the NASA Astrobiology Institute)
* The Astroparticle Physics Group (with the Institute of Physics)
* The Astrophysical Chemistry Group (with the Royal Society of Chemistry)
* The British Geophysical Association (with the Geological Society of London)
* The Magnetosphere Ionosphere and Solar-Terrestrial group (generally known by the acronym MIST)
* The UK Planetary Forum
* The UK Solar Physics group

== Presidents ==

The first person to hold the title of President of the Royal Astronomical Society was William Herschel, though he never chaired a meeting, and since then the post has been held by many distinguished astronomers. The post has generally had a term of office of two years, but some holders resigned after one year e.g. due to poor health. Francis Baily and George Airy were elected a record four times each. Baily&#x27;s eight years in the role are a record (Airy served for seven). Since 1876 no one has served for more than two years in total.

The current president is Mike Lockwood, who began his term in May 2024 and will serve for two years.

== Awards and prizes ==
The highest award of the Royal Astronomical Society is its Gold Medal, which can be awarded for any purpose but most frequently recognises extraordinary lifetime achievement. Among the recipients best known to the general public are Albert Einstein in 1926, and Stephen Hawking in 1985.

Other awards are for particular topics in astronomy or geophysics research, which include the Eddington Medal, the Herschel Medal, the Chapman Medal and the Price Medal. Beyond research, there are specific awards for school teaching (Patrick Moore Medal), public outreach (Annie Maunder Medal), instrumentation (Jackson-Gwilt Medal) and history of science (Agnes Mary Clerke Medal). Lectureships include the Harold Jeffreys Lectureship in geophysics, the George Darwin Lectureship in astronomy, and the Gerald Whitrow Lectureship in cosmology. Each year, the society grants a handful of free memberships for life (termed honorary fellowship) to prominent researchers resident outside the UK.

== Other activities ==

The society occupies premises at Burlington House, London, where a library and meeting rooms are available to fellows and other interested parties. The society represents the interests of astronomy and geophysics to UK national and regional, and European government and related bodies, and maintains a press office, through which it keeps the media and the public at large informed of developments in these sciences. The society allocates grants to worthy causes in astronomy and geophysics, and assists in the management of the Paneth Trust.

<text>Lost Cities and Vanished Civilizations is a 1962 book by Robert Silverberg that deals with the then-current archaeology studies of six past civilizations. The book is divided into six chapters, and each deals with a particular civilization: Pompeii, Troy, Nicola, Babylon, Chichen Itza, and Angkor Wat. Silverberg also deals with the historical search for the past through the life works of archaeologists such as Heinrich Schliemann and Henry Rawlinson.

<text>The Walt Disney Company has produced an anthology television series since 1954 under several titles and formats. The program&#x27;s current title, The Wonderful World of Disney, was used from 1969 to 1979 and again from 1991 onward. The program moved among the Big Three television networks in its first four decades, but has aired on ABC since 1997.

The original version of the series premiered on ABC in 1954. The show was broadcast weekly on one of the Big Three television networks until 1983. After a two-year hiatus it resumed, running regularly until 1991. From 1991 until 1997, the series aired infrequently.

The program resumed a regular schedule in 1997 on the ABC fall schedule, coinciding with Disney&#x27;s purchase of ABC in 1996. From 1997 to 2008, the program aired regularly on ABC. Since then, ABC has continued the series as an occasional special presentation from 2008 onward, the most recent being a holiday music special in 2019. In 2020, the series returned with movies from the Disney+ library.
The show has had only two hosts, Disney co-founder Walt Disney and former Disney chairman and CEO Michael Eisner.

The show is the second longest-running prime-time program on American television, behind &quot;Hallmark Hall of Fame&quot;.

== History ==
The anthology series was an outgrowth of Walt Disney looking for funding for Disneyland, with his brother Roy Disney approaching all the big-three networks and American Broadcasting-Paramount Theatres taking the deal for programming for ABC.

=== &quot;Walt Disney&#x27;s Disneyland&quot; (1954–1958) ===
Although Walt Disney was the first major film producer to venture into television, two established independent film producers successfully ventured into television production before Disney, Hal Roach and Jerry Fairbanks. Disney wanted to produce a television program to finance the development of the Disneyland amusement park. After being turned down by both CBS and NBC, Disney eventually signed a deal with ABC (which had merged with United Paramount Theatres in 1953) on March 29, 1954. The show contained teasers for Walt&#x27;s park, as well as episodes representing life in one of the park&#x27;s main sections: Adventureland, Tomorrowland, Fantasyland, and Frontierland, with the opening titles used from its inception until the show&#x27;s move to NBC in 1961, showing the entrance to Disneyland itself, as well as the four aforementioned lands, one of which was then identified as the main feature of that evening&#x27;s program.

Consequently, Davy Crockett and other pioneers of the Old West, and American history in general, appeared in &quot;Frontier Land&quot;. Similarly, &quot;20,000 Leagues Under the Sea&quot; might be the focus of an evening spent in &quot;Adventure Land&quot;, although a documentary on the film could also be possibly presented as a topic for such episodes, including clips from the actual film. Topics for &quot;Fantasy Land&quot; would include either actual cartoons, and animated films, or documentaries on &quot;The Making of ...&quot; (such as behind-the-scenes presentation of Peggy Lee singing the duet of the wicked Siamese cats in &quot;Lady and the Tramp&quot;, or the barbershop quartet of lost dogs in the municipal Dog Pound); excerpts from a &quot;True-Life Adventure&quot; documentary might also be included (for example, one on the life and works of beavers and their dam-building) or those using stroboscopic stop-action photography (such as investigating what really happened when a rain-drop fell in a puddle, as part of a &quot;Fantasy Land&quot; episode), explaining the techniques of cartoon animation. The multiplane camera used to create the three-dimensional effects of &quot;Bambi&quot; was also a topic for a &quot;Fantasy Land&quot;-set telecast. In the episode An Adventure in Art, four different artists were given the task of drawing the same tree, with each artist using his own preferred ways of drawing and imagining a tree; this led to cartoon examples of differently animated trees, as in some of the early &quot;Silly Symphonies&quot; shorts, and later full-length animated films. &quot;Tomorrow Land&quot; was an opportunity for the Disney studio staff to present cutting-edge science and technology, and to predict possible futures, such as futuristic automobiles and highways, and featured Wernher von Braun as an on-air technical consultant in Man and the Moon, which aired December 28, 1955. This format remained basically unchanged through the 1980s, though new material was scarce in later years. Other episodes were segments from Disney films such as &quot;Seal Island&quot; and &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot;, or cartoons of Donald Duck and other Disney standbys.

The program spawned the Davy Crockett craze of 1955 with the airing of a three-episode series (not shown over the course of consecutive weeks) about the historical American frontiersman, starring Fess Parker in the title role. Millions of dollars of merchandise relating to the title character were sold, and the theme song, &quot;The Ballad of Davy Crockett&quot;, became a hit record that year. Three historically based hour-long programs aired during late 1954/early 1955, and were followed up by two dramatized installments the following year. The TV episodes were later edited into two theatrical films.

On July 17, 1955, the opening of Disneyland was covered on a live television special, &quot;Dateline: Disneyland&quot;, which is not technically considered to be part of the series. It was hosted by Art Linkletter, with whom Walt Disney had worked out a deal prior to the opening to allow Linkletter to lease a shop on Main Street in return for the broadcast. Art Linkletter was assisted by Bob Cummings and Ronald Reagan, and the program featured various other guests, including various appearances of Walt himself as he dedicated the various lands of Disneyland.

=== &quot;Walt Disney Presents&quot; (1958–1961) ===
In 1958, the series was retitled &quot;Walt Disney Presents&quot; and moved to a Friday-night timeslot; by 1960, ABC had switched it to Sunday nights, where it remained for 21 years. During this iteration, &quot;The Peter Tchaikovsky Story&quot;, an episode made to promote Walt&#x27;s latest animated feature, &quot;Sleeping Beauty&quot;, was one of the first stereo simulcasts on TV; in this case it was 3 channel stereo. FM radio stations across the country carried the left channel at the same time as ABC broadcast the TV show in mono, which served as a center channel, and AM radio stations broadcast the right channel. In the second half of the show, a lengthy clip of &quot;Sleeping Beauty&quot; was shown, with its 6 channels (70 mm. version) mixed down into 3 for the broadcast. Walt apparently wanted people to see &quot;Sleeping Beauty&quot; in 70 mm, so, in the introduction, he explained the difference between 35 mm and 70 mm and held up a card with both sizes on it. In addition to episodes devoted to the latest additions at Disneyland, many episodes during this period were Westerns such as &quot;Texas John Slaughter&quot; and &quot;Elfego Baca&quot;, while others talked about the United States&#x27; burgeoning efforts to explore outer space and others, such as &quot;Moochie of the Little League&quot;, were set in the then-present day. Some episodes even mixed live-action and animation, showing Mickey Mouse, Donald Duck, Goofy, Chip &#x27;n&#x27; Dale, Professor Owl and Jiminy Cricket talking with Walt himself, while one 1959 episode (titled The Adventures of Chip &#x27;n&#x27; Dale) turned the spotlight on Chip &#x27;n&#x27; Dale, combining their theatrical cartoons with mixed media wrap-around footage including the chipmunks&#x27; own theme song. The episode&#x27;s genre is a live action/animated musical comedy, and as the title suggests, it stars the titular chipmunks. At the end of the episode, Chip &#x27;n&#x27; Dale say (singing) their goodbyes to the audience and return to their nut home on the counter hoping the audience enjoyed their show.

=== &quot;Walt Disney&#x27;s Wonderful World of Color&quot; (1961–1969) ===
Although the basic format remained the same, the series moved to NBC on September 24, 1961, to take advantage of that network&#x27;s ability to broadcast programming in color. In addition, Walt Disney&#x27;s relationship with ABC had soured as the network resisted selling its stake in the theme park before doing so in 1960. In a display of foresight, Disney had filmed many of the earlier shows in color, allowing them to easily be repeated on NBC; since all but three of Disney&#x27;s feature-length films were also made in color (the three black-and-white exceptions were &quot;The Shaggy Dog&quot;, &quot;The Absent-Minded Professor&quot;, and &quot;Son of Flubber&quot;, all family comedies starring Fred MacMurray), they could now also be telecast in that format.

To emphasize the new feature, the series was retitled &quot;Walt Disney&#x27;s Wonderful World of Color&quot; when NBC began airing it. The first NBC episode even dealt with the principles of color, as explained by a new character named Ludwig Von Drake (voiced by Paul Frees), a bumbling professor with a thick German accent, who was the uncle of Donald Duck. Von Drake was the first Disney character created specifically for television.
Walt Disney died on December 15, 1966, 12 years after the anthology series premiered. While the broadcast that aired three days after his death featured a memorial tribute from &quot;Huntley-Brinkley Report&quot; anchor Chet Huntley with film and television star Dick Van Dyke, the introductions that Walt had already filmed before his death continued to air for the remainder of the season. After that, the studio decided that Walt&#x27;s persona as host was such a key part of the show&#x27;s appeal to viewers that the host segment was dropped. The final episode featuring Walt&#x27;s host segment was the episode &quot;A Salute to Alaska&quot;.

=== &quot;The Wonderful World of Disney&quot; (1969–1979) ===
The series was retitled &quot;The Wonderful World of Disney&quot; in September 1969, by which time the color distinction was no longer needed as all big three networks were broadcasting in color. It continued to gain solid ratings, often ranking in the top 20, until the mid-1970s.

In 1976, Disney showed its hit 1961 film &quot;The Parent Trap&quot; on television for the first time, as a 2½-hour special. This marked a major step in broadcasting for the studio, which had never shown one of its more popular films on television in a time slot longer than an hour (although it had shown &quot;Now You See Him, Now You Don&#x27;t&quot; and &quot;Napoleon and Samantha&quot; in a two-hour format in 1975). Walt Disney Productions also began running some of its multiepisode television programs, such as 1962&#x27;s &quot;Sammy The Way-Out Seal&quot;, as televised feature films on the anthology series. A slightly edited version of the 1954 Disney film &quot;20,000 Leagues Under the Sea&quot; made its television debut as a two-hour special on NBC in October 1976. Several other Disney films, some of them not especially successful (such as &quot;Superdad&quot;, which was an outright flop in its initial theatrical release) were also aired on the program in the form of two-hour broadcasts that year. However, the multiepisode format for feature films had not been discontinued; as late as 1981, films such as &quot;Pollyanna&quot; were still being shown on the Disney program in several installments running a week apart.

During the early 1970s, the show gradually concentrated less on animated cartoons and dramatic or comedy films, and began to place an emphasis on nature-oriented programs (such as the &quot;True-Life Adventures&quot;).

The show&#x27;s continued ratings success in the post-Walt era came to an end during the 1975–76 season. At this time, Walt Disney Productions was facing a decline in fortunes due to falling box-office revenues, while NBC as a whole was also slipping in the ratings. The anthology series became even more dependent on airings of live-action theatrical features, its &quot;True-Life Adventures&quot;, reruns of older episodes, and cartoon compilations. Nothing from the Disney animated features canon aired, with the exceptions of &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot; and &quot;Dumbo&quot;, as part of a long-standing policy placed on the program by Disney. Additionally, in 1975, when CBS regained the broadcast rights to the 1939 Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer film &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;, it was scheduled opposite &quot;Disney&quot;, as it had been between 1960 and 1968. At that time, telecasts of that film were highly rated annual events, which largely attracted the same family audience as the Disney series. From 1968 to 1975, when NBC held the television rights to &quot;Oz&quot; (which it had acquired from CBS in 1967), it usually pre-empted &quot;Disney&quot; to show it. However, the show&#x27;s stiffest weekly competition came from CBS&#x27;s newsmagazine &quot;60 Minutes&quot;.

In 1975, an amendment to the Prime Time Access Rule gave the Sunday 7:00 p.m. Eastern Time slot back to the networks, allowing NBC to move &quot;Disney&quot; back by a half-hour. It also allowed CBS to schedule &quot;60 Minutes&quot; at 7:00 p.m. Eastern Time starting on December 7; prior to this, &quot;60 Minutes&quot; had aired at 6:00 p.m. Eastern and did not begin its seasons until after the National Football League season ended. &quot;Disney&quot; fell out of the top 30, while &quot;60 Minutes&quot; had its ratings rise significantly.

=== &quot;Disney&#x27;s Wonderful World&quot; (1979–1981) ===
In September 1979, the studio agreed to then-NBC president Fred Silverman&#x27;s request for changes to the program. The show shortened its title to &quot;Disney&#x27;s Wonderful World&quot;, and updated the opening sequence with a computer-generated logo and disco-styled theme song, but largely kept the same format. The problems for the show continued. As a result of the ratings strength of &quot;60 Minutes&quot;, compounded by low ratings, increasingly less original material, and frequent pre-emptions (primarily due to sporting events such as NFL game telecasts), NBC cancelled &quot;Disney&quot; in 1981. One factor that was beyond the control of either Disney or NBC was a 94-day strike by the Screen Actors&#x27; Guild that cut the number of shows for the 1980–1981 season, but the damage was done nonetheless.

=== &quot;Walt Disney&quot; (1981–1983) ===
Following NBC&#x27;s announcement that it would drop the anthology series, CBS picked up the program and began airing it on Saturdays at 8:00 p.m. Eastern Time, in September 1981. Despite a more elaborate credit sequence and another title change, to simply &quot;Walt Disney&quot;, the series&#x27; format remained unchanged. During the 1981–1982 season, the series had a full season&#x27;s worth of material again, but little of it was new. Among the little that actually was new were a handful of pilots based on &quot;Pollyanna&quot;, &quot;Escape to Witch Mountain&quot;, and &quot;The Apple Dumpling Gang&quot;, but only the last of the three pilots was sold and became the half-hour sitcom &quot;Gun Shy&quot; the following season, one of the studio&#x27;s first entries in that genre but only lasted six episodes.

The 1982–1983 season had enough material to fill the time slot, but almost all of it was pre-existing material, the lone exception being the celebrity-laden opening ceremony of Epcot on October 23. It also did not help matters that NBC slotted the family-friendly sitcoms &quot;Diff&#x27;rent Strokes&quot; and &quot;Silver Spoons&quot; at 8:00 p.m. and 8:30 p.m. up against it to draw children away from CBS. After moving to Tuesday at the beginning of 1983, it went on hiatus on February 15 while the aforementioned &quot;Gun Shy&quot; took up the second half of its time slot. When it came back for summer reruns on May 3, it was still on Tuesday at 8:00 p.m.; its final network broadcast was on September 24, bringing an uninterrupted 29-year run on all three networks to a close.

The end of the show coincided with the launch of the studio&#x27;s cable television network, the Disney Channel. While ratings were a factor, the final decision to end the show came from Walt Disney Productions&#x27; then-CEO Card Walker, who felt that having both the show and the new channel active would result in cannibalization of viewership. The new channel would provide a home for the show in reruns for the next two decades, but for the time being, Disney&#x27;s presence on U.S. network TV would be limited to the occasional holiday special, theme park anniversary, or cartoon compilation. The CBS version of the shows&#x27; intro would also be featured on Disney Channel. 

=== &quot;The Disney Sunday Movie&quot; (1986–1988) ===
After the studio – which was rechristened as the Walt Disney Company in 1986 – underwent a change in management, Disney sought to bring back some sort of programming to broadcast television. Their efforts led to the premiere of &quot;The Disney Sunday Movie&quot;, which debuted on February 2, 1986, on ABC. Many names were considered to serve as presenter for the revived show, including Julie Andrews, Dick Van Dyke, Cary Grant, Tom Hanks, Walter Cronkite, Roy E. Disney (who closely resembled his uncle), and even Mickey Mouse. The studio finally decided to have Michael Eisner, the company&#x27;s recently hired CEO, host the series. Although he was not a performer, after filming a test video with his wife Jane and a member of his executive team (which required multiple takes), studio management believed he could do the hosting job. Eisner hired Michael Kay, a director of political commercials for then-U.S. Senator Bill Bradley, to help him improve his on-camera performance.

&quot;The Disney Sunday Movie&quot; initially aired as ABC&#x27;s lead-off program on Sundays, running from 7:00 to 9:00 p.m. Eastern Time. By this point, the format was similar to a movie-of-the-week. Gary Barton, a Disney senior vice president, was in charge of the program. &quot;Help Wanted: Kids&quot; was the first episode&#x27;s film. Other first revival year films were &quot;Young Again&quot;, &quot;The Richest Cat in the World&quot;, &quot;I-Man&quot; (starring Scott Bakula), and &quot;My Town&quot;. Sometimes the slot would feature a special instead of dramatic material, such as &quot;Disney Goes to the Oscars&quot; featuring the studio&#x27;s Academy Award winners, and &quot;The Greatest Moments in Disney Animation&quot;. A handful of Disney Channel original films made their network television debuts during these iteration as well, but the program did not present any film made by Disney&#x27;s Touchstone subsidiary, as such films were not considered appropriate for children. However, &quot;Splash, Too&quot;, a sequel to the 1984 film, aired on the series over two weeks in May 1988. The series had increased Disney Park attendance and ABC&#x27;s Sunday night ratings for the evening by an average 27% for the rest of the season. Disney, wanting to make it a regular viewing habit, gave ABC additional films from its library, including &quot;Old Yeller&quot;, &quot;The Apple Dumpling Gang&quot; and &quot;Candleshoe&quot; for the normal rerun mid-year period. &quot;The Last Electric Knight&quot; movie produced a spin-off series called &quot;Sidekicks&quot; (originally to be called &quot;Karate Kid&quot;) for ABC&#x27;s 1987 season.

Despite improving ABC&#x27;s numbers, the program&#x27;s ratings were never strong as the established &quot;60 Minutes&quot; and scripted mystery series &quot;Murder, She Wrote&quot; on CBS, both of which Disney was competing with for viewers, remained the leading primetime programs on Sunday nights. In 1987, ABC reduced &quot;The Disney Sunday Movie&quot; from two hours to one. The move did not help drive ratings, and ABC decided not to renew its contract with Disney or pick up a fourth season of the second iteration of the anthology series.

&quot;The Disney Sunday Movie&quot; was also being run on the Disney Channel, also hosted by Eisner.

=== &quot;The Magical World of Disney&quot; (1988–1990) ===
In early 1988, NBC decided to renew its association with Disney after it had cut ties to the anthology series seven years earlier; NBC brought the series, now named &quot;The Magical World of Disney&quot;, to serve as the lead-in of its Sunday lineup in September 1988. As the program had done during its last season as &quot;The Disney Sunday Movie&quot;, &quot;The Magical World of Disney&quot; ran for one hour, airing at 7:00 p.m. Eastern Time; Michael Eisner also returned as its host. During this period, the show attempted to reintroduce the rotating format the show started out with in 1954. It also introduced new versions of Walt-era movies and TV shows such as &quot;The Absent-Minded Professor&quot;, a reboot of &quot;Davy Crockett&quot;, and the musical &quot;Polly&quot;, which was based on the book &quot;Pollyanna&quot; by Eleanor H. Porter and the Walt Disney&#x27;s 1960 film adaptation of it. New television animation came in the form of &quot;Super DuckTales&quot;—a compilation of an arc from Disney&#x27;s syndicated animated series &quot;DuckTales&quot;—as an Easter special on March 26, 1989; another &quot;DuckTales&quot; special, &quot;A DuckTales Valentine&quot;, aired on February 11, 1990.

In the 1989–1990 season, during which Disney was negotiating with Jim Henson to buy the Muppets, they aired two Muppet specials; one of them was &quot;The Muppets at Walt Disney World&quot;, which turned out to be Henson&#x27;s last Muppet special. He died May 16, 1990, 10 days after the special aired, and Disney only acquired the Muppets more than a decade later.

After two seasons experiencing the same lackluster ratings as it had accrued during the end of its initial NBC run and its subsequent runs on CBS and ABC, Disney elected to end the broadcast television run of &quot;The Magical World of Disney&quot; and began airing the anthology on the Disney Channel – in the same time slot it had been airing for the past decade – starting in September 1990, expanding back to a two-hour format. Since the Disney Channel operated as a premium channel at the time, films presented on the series were presented without commercial interruption. &quot;The Magical World of Disney&quot; originally aired on the cable channel as a weekly Sunday-only program for its first 5½ years; but in December 1996, as part of the first phase of a programming revamp that culminated in its formal conversion into a commercial-free basic cable channel in April 1997, the Disney Channel expanded the &quot;Magical World&quot; brand to encompass its Monday through Saturday primetime film block, maintaining its 7:00 p.m. Eastern time slot.

=== &quot;The Wonderful World of Disney&quot; (1991–present) ===
&quot;The Wonderful World of Disney&quot; returned in 1991 as an umbrella title for Disney specials airing on major networks (CBS airings used the historical title &quot;The Wonderful World of Disney&quot; for the first few years, while other networks broadcast the show with another title, &quot;A Disney Special&quot;). During this time, one of the telefilms shown under the banner was spun off into its own series -- &quot;The 100 Lives of Black Jack Savage&quot;, a collaboration with Stephen J. Cannell Productions.

In 1997, with Disney acquiring ABC in 1995, ABC gave the series a regular slot in the schedule. Disney CEO Eisner formed Disney Telefilms by 1995 to supply original films to the series and program together with ABC. It led ABC&#x27;s Sunday night lineup at the 7:00 p.m. Eastern time slot, resulting in the displacement of Sunday mainstay &quot;America&#x27;s Funniest Home Videos&quot;, which had occupied the slot since 1992. On September 28, 1997, the all-new &quot;Wonderful World of Disney&quot; premiered with the network television premiere of &quot;Toy Story&quot;. On October 5, 1997, Disney Telefilms&#x27; first production, &quot;Toothless&quot;, debuted on the series. In addition to the planned 16 original Disney telemovies, ABC and Disney added a few direct-to-video movies and films from other sources.

In 2001, a Spanish-language version of the program premiered on Telemundo (which, incidentally, was acquired by the English version&#x27;s former home, NBC, that same year) as &quot;El Maravilloso Mundo de Disney&quot;, with more of a focus on Disney theatrical films than the English broadcasts at the time.

In September 2003, &quot;The Wonderful World of Disney&quot; moved to Saturdays at 8:00 pm Eastern, with the previous Sunday time slot being ceded to &quot;AFV&quot; (which moved back to Sundays that season) and drama series in the 8:00 pm hour. Rare exceptions to the program&#x27;s format occurred during this time; for example, a &quot;Little House on the Prairie&quot; miniseries ran for several weeks in 2004 under the &quot;Wonderful World of Disney&quot; banner. For most of its second run on ABC, the program aired throughout the television season, with the exception of the 2005–06 season (when it aired during the midseason only), and in 2007 and 2008 (when it was relegated to the summer months), with a broader array of films occupying the network&#x27;s Saturday primetime slot at other times, when sports programming did not air. The series ended as a regular program in 2008.

At this point, the series began to shift focus toward Disney theatrical films, relying less on original television films; however, the series aired three Disney Channel Original Movies (2002&#x27;s &quot;Cadet Kelly&quot;, 2008&#x27;s &quot;Camp Rock&quot; and 2011&#x27;s &quot;Phineas and Ferb the Movie: Across the 2nd Dimension&quot;, currently the only Disney Channel television films to have aired on a non-Disney Channel-branded network domestically) during its ABC run. The second ABC revival also included some family-oriented films produced by studios other than Disney under the &quot;Wonderful World&quot; banner, such as &quot;The Sound of Music&quot; from 20th Century Fox (which is presently owned by Disney, now known as 20th Century Studios).

=== Revival, and Presented by Disney+ (2015–present) ===

On December 12, 2015, ABC&#x27;s &quot;The Wonderful World of Disney&quot; officially returned to its anthology format with a showing of &quot;Mary Poppins&quot; for the first time on ABC since 2002, hosted by Dick Van Dyke. Van Dyke took viewers on a tour through the Disney Archives, as they explored props and costumes from the production of &quot;Mary Poppins&quot; and discussed the film&#x27;s history and context within the Disney legacy. It was then shown on February 21, 2016, with the special &quot;Disneyland 60&quot;, which honored Disneyland&#x27;s 60th anniversary; on November 24, 2016, for their Magical Holiday Celebration, filmed at Walt Disney World; and on December 11, 2016, for the network television premiere of &quot;Frozen&quot;. On August 5, 2019, it was announced that &quot;The Wonderful World of Disney&quot; would present &quot;The Little Mermaid Live!&quot; on November 5 of that year with Auliʻi Cravalho, Queen Latifah and Shaggy starring as Ariel, Ursula and Sebastian, respectively. The cast also included John Stamos as Chef Louis and Graham Phillips as Prince Eric. The special featured music from both the film and the Tony Award-nominated Broadway stage version and was performed in front of a live audience with giant projection surface. The title was used again on November 28, 2019, for a two-hour music special, &quot;The Wonderful World of Disney: Magical Holiday Celebration&quot;, hosted by Emma Bunton and Matthew Morrison.

On May 7, 2020, it was announced that &quot;The Wonderful World of Disney&quot; would bring back its banner for a series of theatrical movies from the Disney+ library, which featured an updated title card, which includes &quot;Moana&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;Up&quot;, and &quot;Big Hero 6&quot;, for four weeks beginning May 20, 2020. A fifth week was later added, featuring the 2010 Disney/Pixar film, &quot;Toy Story 3&quot;, marking ten years since its theatrical release. The program returned on September 23, 2020, featuring the 2014 Marvel film, &quot;Guardians of the Galaxy&quot;, filling a gap in ABC&#x27;s fall 2020 schedule. On October 9, 2020, ABC announced the program would return on October 14, with the broadcast television premiere of the 2017 Disney/Pixar film, &quot;Coco&quot;.

&quot;Captain America: The Winter Soldier&quot; aired on January 12, 2021. The 2015 live action film &quot;Cinderella&quot; aired on January 19, 2021.

On April 28, 2021, it was announced that the program would return on May 3, 2021, for five weeks with a series of theatrical movies from the Disney+ library, which includes the broadcast television premieres of &quot;Incredibles 2&quot; and &quot;Finding Dory&quot;, &quot;Monsters, Inc.&quot;, &quot;Tangled&quot; and &quot;The Princess and the Frog&quot;. On October 28, 2021, the program returned with the broadcast television premiere of the 2019 Disney/Pixar film &quot;Toy Story 4&quot;.

&quot;Hocus Pocus&quot; aired on September 29, 2022, to promote &quot;Hocus Pocus 2&quot;, which premiered on Disney+ a day later. &quot;Enchanted&quot; aired on November 17, 2022, to promote &quot;Disenchanted&quot;, which premiered on Disney+ a day later. During the airing of &quot;Hocus Pocus&quot;, a new title card premiered bookending with the new Disney100 logo to celebrate the Walt Disney Company&#x27;s 100th anniversary. &quot;Avatar&quot; aired on December 11, 2022, to promote &quot;&quot;, which premiered in theaters 5 days later. &quot;Home Alone&quot; aired on December 24, 2022.

To kick off 2023, the program returned for five weeks with a series of theatrical movies from the Disney+ library, which includes the 2019 CGI film &quot;The Lion King&quot; and &quot;Finding Nemo&quot;, as well as the broadcast television premiere of &quot;Iron Man&quot; and &quot;The Avengers&quot;. Due to the death of Barbara Walters on December 30, 2022, the schedule would be moved by a week and the broadcast television premiere of the 2017 live action film &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; was canceled but was instead replaced with the 2019 film &quot;The Lion King&quot;. In May 2023, it was announced the program would air on Sunday nights for 3 weeks in June (when the NBA Finals were not being played) in a 2-hour block, it would also air on Sunday nights in the fall of that year with a three-hour block.

In May 2024, it was announced that the program would return the following month with a showing of &quot;Inside Out&quot; and that the program would air weekly on Sunday nights as part of ABC&#x27;s 2024-25 schedule.

== &quot;The Magical World of Toons&quot; ==
&quot;The Magical World of Toons&quot; was the daily prime time programming block featuring character&#x27;s key series episodes coinciding with the launch of Disney&#x27;s new channel, Toon Disney, on April 18, 1998. It continued at least until 2003.

== &quot;The Magical World of Disney Junior&quot; ==
In 2012, Disney Junior launched a variant of the movie night anthology as &quot;The Magical World of Disney Junior&quot; on its new 24/7 channel. The channel also premiered its first Disney Junior Original Movie, &quot;Lucky Duck&quot; during &quot;Magical World&quot; on June 20, 2014.

== Reruns ==
Prior to the launch of the Disney Channel, several of the films and specials made for the anthology series were licensed to pay-TV networks such as HBO; in HBO&#x27;s case, the kaleidoscopic-pattern titles that preceded them in the original run were retained.

Around the same time that the 1980s incarnations aired on ABC and NBC, reruns of older episodes of the Disney anthology series, airing under the &quot;Wonderful World of Disney&quot; banner, were syndicated to broadcast television stations throughout the United States as well as in various international markets. In Australia, the program aired on Network Seven on Saturdays at 6:30 pm, before it was dropped in 1994 due to Optus Vision (later Foxtel)&#x27;s launch of a domestic version of the Disney Channel, with &quot;Saturday Disney&quot; replacing it as the channel&#x27;s main block of Disney films.

Reruns of the shows were a staple of the Disney Channel for several years under the title &quot;Walt Disney Presents&quot; (which used the same title sequence as the 1980s CBS incarnation), when it was an outlet for vintage Disney cartoons, television series, and films, basically serving the same function that the anthology series served in the days before cable. The original opening titles were restored to the episodes in 1997. Reruns of the anthology series were discontinued when the channel exclude all vintage material with the removal of its Vault Disney late-night block on September 8, 2002. However, a few select episodes are available on VHS or DVD (some of which are exclusive to the Disney Movie Club), with the possibility of additional future releases.

From 2014 to 2019, live-action Disney films from the 1950s to the 1980s including special episodes from Walt Disney&#x27;s Wonderful World of Color aired on Turner Classic Movies, without commercial interruption, and presented uncut and with letterboxing on the network&#x27;s standard-definition feed.

All of the episodes and existing material used on the series up to 1996 are listed in the Bill Cotter book &quot;The Wonderful World of Disney Television&quot;, which was released in 1997 by Hyperion Books (which was owned by the Walt Disney Company at the time of the book&#x27;s publication).

== Programming ==
Originally hosted by Walt Disney himself, the original format of the Disney anthology series consisted of a balance of theatrical animated cartoons, live-action features, and other informational material (some original, some pre-existing) from the studio&#x27;s library. For many years, the show also featured edited one-hour versions of such then-recent Disney films as &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot;, and in other cases, telecasts of complete Disney films that were split into two or more one-hour episodes. Later original programs consisted of dramatizations of other historical figures and legends along the lines of the Davy Crockett mini-series. These included a miniseries based on Daniel Boone (not the Fess Parker characterization), Texas John Slaughter, Elfego Baca, Francis Marion (the &quot;Swamp Fox&quot;) and 1977&#x27;s &quot;Kit Carson and the Mountain Man&quot; (with Christopher Connelly as Kit Carson, Robert Reed as John C. Fremont, and Gregg Palmer as mountain man Jim Bridger).

Occasionally, a more educational segment would be featured (such as &quot;The Story of the Animated Drawing&quot;), including nature and animal programs similar to the &quot;True-Life Adventures&quot; that were released in theaters, as well as various dramatic installments which were either structured as single-part, two-part, and sometimes, multipart editions. Much of the original informational excerpts were to create awareness of Disneyland. In spite of essentially serving as advertisements for the park, entertainment value was emphasized, as well to make the shows palatable. Some of the program&#x27;s informational content was formatted to promote upcoming feature film releases by the studio (such as &quot;20,000 Leagues Under the Sea&quot; and &quot;Darby O&#x27;Gill and the Little People&quot;), with some programs focusing on the art and technology of animation itself.

This format generally stayed consistent in the later years of the program, with minor deviations (i.e. more wildlife programming) until &quot;The Disney Sunday Movie&quot; era, which began to rely more on original telefilms and specials as opposed to Disney library content; in certain cases, these films were intended to be spun-off into regular series (including &quot;The Last Electric Knight&quot;, which became the short-lived &quot;Sidekicks&quot;, and the equally short-lived &quot;100 Lives of Black Jack Savage&quot;). During the 1997-2008 period on ABC, more original telefilms and recent Disney theatrical films made up the bulk of the content; however, films from outside producers were featured occasionally, including &quot;Princess of Thieves&quot; (a production of Granada Media) and the 2001 remake of &quot;Brian&#x27;s Song&quot; (produced by Columbia TriStar Television).

== Theme music ==
* From 1954 to 1961, the series used the song &quot;When You Wish Upon a Star&quot; as its theme. The recording was taken directly from the soundtrack of the movie &quot;Pinocchio&quot;. Once the title was changed to &quot;Walt Disney Presents&quot; in 1958, the theme was used only over the ending credits.
* From 1961 to 1968, an original song was used, &quot;The Wonderful World of Color&quot;, written by Richard M. Sherman and Robert B. Sherman. This song helped to emphasize the use of color with its lyrics.
* From 1968 to 1979 (&quot;The Wonderful World of Disney&quot;), orchestral medleys of various Disney songs from movies and theme parks as theme songs.
* From 1979 to 1980 (&quot;Disney&#x27;s Wonderful World&quot;), a disco-styled theme was written to emphasize the new visual changes, even though the format remained the same. John Debney composed the melody and John Klawitter wrote the lyrics.
** From 1980 to 1981, the series discarded the Debney/Klawitter theme and went back to an earlier orchestral medley theme, while keeping the 1979 credits motif and title.
* From 1981 to 1983 (&quot;Walt Disney&quot;), a short disco arrangement of &quot;When You Wish Upon a Star&quot;, arranged by Frank Gari, served as theme against some elaborate, then-state-of-the-art computer graphics. CBC Television in Canada also used this title sequence and theme music for their own versions of the show. The sequence was also used as the opening sequence on international Walt Disney Home Video releases until 1987.
* From 1986 to 1988, a synthesized, pop-rock arrangement of &quot;When You Wish Upon a Star&quot; with some clapping was the theme. This was used again for season of &quot;The Magical World of Disney&quot; on NBC from 1989 to 1991 and on The Disney Channel from 1991 to 1996.
* In 1988, an orchestral medley of &quot;A Dream is a Wish Your Heart Makes&quot; and &quot;When You Wish Upon a Star&quot; was used. This was switched back to the 1986 theme in 1989.
* From 1991 to 1997, an orchestral medley of &quot;When You Wish Upon a Star&quot; and &quot;Part of Your World&quot; (the latter from Disney&#x27;s then recent hit &quot;The Little Mermaid&quot;), composed by David Newman, was used for network airings of the show (known as &quot;The Wonderful World of Disney&quot; on CBS and &quot;A Disney Special&quot; on other networks). This theme was also used internationally.
* From 1997 to 2000, an orchestral medley of &quot;When You Wish Upon a Star&quot; and &quot;A Whole New World&quot; (the latter used in the movie &quot;Aladdin&quot;), composed by Bruce Broughton, were used; also used occasionally was the Louis Armstrong hit &quot;What a Wonderful World&quot;. This theme &quot;Mickey Mouse March&quot; is still used currently internationally.
* From 2000 to 2007, a newer orchestral arrangement of &quot;When You Wish Upon a Star&quot; with a wordless choir, composed by James Horner, was used for ABC airings in the United States. The opening title sequence was updated in 2007 to include the castle shown in the 2006 Disney logo, along with clips from Disney and Pixar films. This updated intro was also a promotion of the new Disney website, which debuted earlier that year.
* From 2007 to 2008, another orchestral arrangement of &quot;When You Wish Upon a Star&quot; (in actuality, the theme from the 2006 Disney logo, written and composed by Mark Mancina and co-arranged with and orchestrated by David Metzger) and a brand-new opening title sequence (depicting a montage of the company&#x27;s work with audio from Walt Disney himself) are used for ABC airings in the United States.
* From 2015 onwards, &quot;Heaven&#x27;s Triumph&quot;, composed by Robert Etoll via Q-Factory, is used alongside a brand-new opening title sequence (updated with a longer voice-over from Walt Disney and including clips of films from the &quot;Star Wars&quot; franchise and Marvel Studios). The opening title sequence was updated in 2020 to add &quot;Presented by Disney+&quot; text to the show&#x27;s title card (with the animated Disney+ logo) as the 2006 Disney logo (without the text) was shortened, and 2022 to replace the 2006 Disney logo with the Disney100 version of the 2022 Disney logo (without the text), in celebration of The Walt Disney Company&#x27;s 100th anniversary in 2023, as in which the &quot;Presented by Disney+&quot; text (with the animated Disney+ logo) was shown earlier as the program&#x27;s logo was being shown. After that, it transitions to the print Disney100 logo. On December 11, 2022, the intro was updated with the print Disney100 logo was removed as the &quot;Presented by Disney+&quot; text was still shown for the rest of the intro, due to the addition of films from 20th Century Studios. However, a scene from the featured movie is shown as well, starting with &quot;Hocus Pocus&quot; (that scene was later used in &quot;Enchanted&quot;). On June 2, 2023, the &quot;Presented by Disney+&quot; text was removed. However, on October 1, 2023, to add the print Disney100 logo back to the title card, now smaller in size. It was reverted to the previous version on January 7, 2024. The &quot;Presented by Disney+&quot; tagline made a surprise re-appearance on October 20, 2024 and January 12, 2025.

==== The Telefe era ====
&quot;El mundo de Disney&quot; (The World of Disney) aired for the first time on the OTA network Telefe in 1990, hosted by Leonardo Greco. He remained as the sole presenter of the show, lasting until 1995, when the series concluded. The programme started airing at 8:00 pm nightly from the second half of 1990 until December 1992. By 1993, it was moved to weekday afternoons at 5:00 pm. When it was coming to an end, around 1994, shifted to Sunday afternoons, and aired a long marathon of movies and cartoons. According to Greco, this programme was possible because of a distributor who acquired the material, and was allowed to be shown without following a strict format, because the company wanted to do so.
Telefe wanted a comeback, and appointed chef and host Maru Botana (then network talent) to present &quot;Planeta Disney&quot; (Disney Planet) on Sunday evenings, at 8:00pm, beginning November 21, 2004. Starting on July 9, 2005, Botana was replaced with two personalities employed by Disney, Carolina Ibarra and Dani Martins. They both shared the duties of hosting this show and the South American edition of Zapping Zone, on Disney Channel. This lasted for a year and a half, with relative success.

==== The Canal 13 era ====
While Telefe had a major success carrying the animated movies and some TV series like &quot;Blossom&quot; or &quot;Dinosaurs&quot; (distributed by Buena Vista Television), Canal 13 saw the possibility of buying material from the company and airing it (sometimes competing against the Telefe&#x27;s program) on Sunday afternoons, beginning in 1994, which at that time was filled with telecasts of ancient Argentinian films from the 1950s, 1960s or 1970s, and by reruns of &quot;Tarzan&quot; and &quot;The Three Stooges&quot;. The only clear difference was that only movies starring human actors, like &quot;Chitty Chitty Bang Bang&quot; or &quot;The Island at the Top of the World&quot;, could be broadcast, and not the cartoons. This experiment lasted until early 1996. By 2007, the network took off from Telefe the exclusive rights to show all the Disney franchise movies and programs, and began to air its movies on Sunday evenings at 7:00 pm, without a host. This also allowed Canal 13 to detain rights for other shows not related with Disney, but with the ABC network, like &quot;Lost&quot; or &quot;Grey&#x27;s Anatomy&quot;, and to produce a localized version of the high-grossing film &quot;High School Musical&quot;.

=== Australia ===
For more than 30 years, The Wonderful World of Disney was broadcast on the Seven Network, but in 2019, The Wonderful World of Disney moved to Saturday nights on the Nine Network and Friday nights on Nine&#x27;s sister network, 9Go!. In 2020, The Wonderful World Of Disney moved to Friday, Saturday and Sunday nights on Seven&#x27;s sister network, 7flix.

=== Brazil ===
The ABC run of the program under &quot;The Magical World of Disney&quot; title originally aired in that country under the title &quot;Cine Disney&quot;, now as &quot;O Mundo Mágico de Disney&quot; and &quot;Sessão de Filmes Domingo Disney&quot;, on the Brazilian-Portuguese version of Sistema Brasileiro de Televisão (SBT) in partnership with The Walt Disney Company. The ABC run of the program under &quot;The Wonderful World of Disney&quot; title originally aired in that country under the title &quot;O Mundo Maravilhoso de Disney&quot; on the Brazilian Portuguese version of Disney Channel; the program moved to SBT as &quot;Mundo Disney&quot; in 2015, for return in partnership with The Walt Disney Company, for end partnership in 2018 from 2 years.

=== Canada ===
CBC aired Disney shows for many years. Disney Movies were simsubbed in the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s on CBS, NBC and ABC with the CBC Broadcast via Cable and later with satellite. CTV aired &quot;The Santa Clause&quot; but later moved to CBC. The movies moved to 4pm eastern many times to prevent simsubbing. Starting in 2023, the CTV Television Network acquired the rights to &quot;The Wonderful World of Disney&quot;, and has since aired it on both CTV and CTV 2. However, CTV doesn&#x27;t use the intro or a host for the series, and only airs the movies.

=== Hong Kong ===
====The TVB Pearl era====

=== United Kingdom ===
The rights to broadcast the series were held by the BBC throughout the 1970s and into the 80s. Originally broadcast as &quot;Walt Disney: The Wonderful World of Colour&quot; from September 1971, its title changed to &quot;The Wonderful World of Disney&quot; the following year and remained thus until the final broadcast in September 1983. Almost all the broadcasts ended with an orchestral version of the &quot;Wonderful World of Color&quot; theme. With only a handful of exceptions, the broadcasts tended to be on Friday or Saturday early evenings. Additionally, the BBC broadcast &quot;Disney Time&quot;, one-off programmes usually restricted to holidays, with a celebrity presenter introducing extracts from Disney films. This series was first broadcast on Christmas Day 1964 (introduced by Julie Andrews) and ended on Boxing Day 1997 (hosted by Keith Chegwin).

<doc id="357522" wikidata="Q202435" url="?curid=357522" title="Lieutenancy areas of Scotland">
<text>The lieutenancy areas of Scotland are the areas used for the ceremonial lord-lieutenants, the monarch&#x27;s representatives, in Scotland. The lord-lieutenants&#x27; titles chosen by the monarch and his legal advisers are mainly based on placenames of the traditional counties of Scotland. In 1794, permanent lieutenancies were established by Royal Warrant. By the Militia Act 1797 (37 Geo.3, C.103), the lieutenants appointed &quot;for the Counties, Stewartries, Cities, and Places&quot; were given powers to raise and command County Militia Units.

While in their lieutenancies, lord lieutenants are among the few individuals in Scotland officially permitted to fly a banner of the Royal Arms of Scotland, the &quot;Lion Rampant&quot; as it is more commonly known.

Lieutenancy areas are different from the current local government council areas and their committee areas. They also differ from other subdivisions of Scotland including sheriffdoms and former regions and districts.

The Lord Provosts of Aberdeen, Dundee, Edinburgh, and Glasgow also act as lord-lieutenants. This is a unique right in the United Kingdom: all other lord-lieutenants are appointed by the monarch, rather than being elected politicians.

==List==
==Definition of the areas==
Each Lord-Lieutenant of a county holding office immediately prior to the local government reorganisation of Scotland on 16 May 1975 was appointed to an area (usually the traditional county area or something very similar to it) within the regions and districts which were established on that date. The lieutenancy areas were not given names in the 1975 order transferring the lieutenancies. When local government was reorganised again on 1 April 1996, the lieutenancy areas remained essentially the same, with minor border adjustments in some based on new council area boundaries. The order transferring the lieutenancies in 1996 gave each lieutenancy a name, usually taken from the names of the pre-1975 counties which roughly correspond to the lieutenancy areas. Some lieutenancy names differ though, with the pre-1975 county of Peeblesshire now corresponding to a lieutenancy of Tweeddale.

<doc id="357525" wikidata="Q945138" url="?curid=357525" title="Bedknobs and Broomsticks">
<text>Bedknobs and Broomsticks is a 1971 American live-action/animated hybrid musical fantasy film directed by Robert Stevenson and with songs written by the Sherman Brothers. It was produced and co-written by Bill Walsh for Walt Disney Productions. It is based upon the books &quot;The Magic Bedknob&quot; (1943) and &quot;Bonfires and Broomsticks&quot; (1947) by English children&#x27;s author Mary Norton. It combines live action and animation, and stars Angela Lansbury, David Tomlinson, Ian Weighill, Cindy O&#x27;Callaghan, and Roy Snart.

During the early 1960s, the film entered development when the negotiations for the film rights to &quot;Mary Poppins&quot; (1964) were placed on hold. When the rights were acquired, the film was shelved repeatedly because of its similarities to &quot;Mary Poppins&quot; until it was revived in 1969. Originally at a length of 139 minutes, it was edited down to almost two hours before its premiere at Radio City Music Hall.

The film was released on December 13, 1971, to mixed reviews from film critics, some of whom praised the live-action/animated sequence. It received five Academy Awards nominations, winning one for Best Special Visual Effects. It was the last film released before the death of Walt Disney&#x27;s surviving brother, Roy O. Disney, who died one week later. It was also the last theatrical film Reginald Owen appeared in before his death the following year in 1972; his last two acting credits were for television. It was also the last film work of screenwriter Don DaGradi before his retirement in 1970 and death on August 4, 1991.

In 1996, the film was restored with most of the deleted material re-inserted back into it. A stage musical adaptation of it had its world premiere at the Theatre Royal in Newcastle upon Tyne on 14 August 2021 before embarking on a UK and Ireland tour until May 2022.

==Plot==

In August 1940, during the Blitz, three orphans named Charlie, Carrie, and Paul Rawlins are evacuated from London to Pepperinge Eye near the Dorset coast where they are placed in the reluctant care of Miss Eglantine Price, who agrees to the arrangement temporarily. They attempt to run back to London, but change their minds after observing Miss Price flying on a broomstick. Revealing that she is learning witchcraft through a correspondence school with hopes of using her spells in the British war effort against the Nazis, Miss Price offers the children a transportation spell on a bedknob in exchange for their silence, which they accept. Later, she receives a letter from her school announcing its closure, thus preventing her from learning the final spell. She convinces the children to use the bedknob to go to London and locate her teacher Professor Emelius Browne.

Mr. Browne turns out to be a charismatic street magician who created the course from an old book as a joke, only to be shocked to learn that the spells work. He gives the book to Miss Price, who is distraught to discover the final spell, Substitutiary Locomotion, is missing key pages. The group travels to Portobello Road to locate the old bookseller who gave Browne the book; the missing pages reveal that the spell is engraved on the Star of Astoroth, a medallion that belonged to a sorcerer of that name. The bookseller explains that Astoroth experimented with magic on animals before anthropomorphism drove the animals to kill the wizard, take the medallion, and flee to the remote island of Naboombu. According to a notation in the book, a 17th-century lascar had claimed to have traveled to Naboombu, but the bookseller never found it. Paul confirms its existence by revealing a storybook that he found in the abandoned townhouse where Browne kept the old book.

The group travels to Naboombu and lands in a lagoon, where Mr. Browne and Miss Price enter a dance contest and win first prize before the bed is fished out by a bear, who informs the group that humans are not allowed on the island by royal decree. They are brought before the ruler King Leonidas, who is wearing the Star of Astoroth. Mr. Browne acts as a referee in a soccer match in order to appease King Leonidas and the animals&#x27; love for the game. The chaotic match ends in King Leonidas&#x27; self-proclaimed victory, but Mr. Browne swaps the medallion with his referee whistle, and the group escapes back to Miss Price&#x27;s house. Miss Price exercises the Substitutiary Locomotion spell, which imbues inanimate objects with life, but they quickly go out of control. When she is informed that the children can be moved to another home, she decides to let them stay, realizing she has come to care for them and vice versa. Mr. Browne later bids goodbye to the group and sleeps at the train station so that he can catch a train back to London in the morning.

A platoon of Nazi German commandos land on the coast via U-boat, invading Miss Price&#x27;s house to use as their headquarters while imprisoning her and the children in the local museum, with the intent to invade the town. At the train station, Mr. Browne fends off two Nazis cutting phone lines and heads back to Miss Price&#x27;s house where he turns himself into a white rabbit to avoid the Nazis. Reuniting with Miss Price and the children at the museum, Mr. Browne inspires Miss Price to use the Substitutiary Locomotion spell to enchant the exhibits into an army. The army of knights&#x27; armor and military uniforms chases the Nazis away, but not before they destroy Miss Price&#x27;s workshop, breaking the spell and ending her career as a witch. Despite the setback, Miss Price is happy that she played a small part in the war effort.

Shortly afterward, Miss Price has officially adopted the children while Mr. Browne has enlisted in the army and departs with the local Home Guard escorting him, promising that he will return and sharing a kiss with Miss Price. Paul reveals he still has the enchanted bedknob, implying they can continue on with their adventures.

==Cast==

* Angela Lansbury as Miss Eglantine Price. Miss Price is initially a somewhat reclusive woman, reluctant to take in children from London as she believes they will get in the way of her witchcraft, which she prefers to keep secret but hopes to use to bring the nascent World War II to an end. However, she bonds with the children and falls in love with Mr. Browne during their journey. She becomes the adoptive mother to the Rawlins siblings at the end of the film.
* David Tomlinson as Mr. Emelius Browne. Introduced as &quot;Professor Browne&quot;, the title by which Miss Price knows him, he is running a Correspondence College of Witchcraft based on what he believes to be &quot;nonsense words&quot; found in an old book. When Miss Price and the children find him in London, he is revealed to be a street performer and con artist, and not a very good one. He is, however, a smooth talker, which proves useful on the group&#x27;s adventures, and believes in doing everything &quot;with a flair&quot;. As the adventures unfold, he finds himself developing an attachment to Miss Price and the children, a feeling he struggles with; Browne becomes the adoptive father to the Rawlins siblings at the end of the film and enlists himself in the military, while promising his new family that he&#x27;ll return.
* Roddy McDowall as Mr. Rowan Jelk, the local clergyman. Deleted scenes reveal Mr. Jelk to be interested in marrying Miss Price, largely for her property.
* Sam Jaffe as Bookman, a mysterious criminal also in pursuit of the Substitutiary Locomotion spell. It is implied that there is some history and bad blood between him and Mr. Browne.
* John Ericson as Colonel Heller, leader of the German raiding party which comes ashore at Pepperinge Eye.
* Bruce Forsyth as Swinburne, a spiv and associate of the Bookman&#x27;s who acts as his muscle.
* Cindy O&#x27;Callaghan as Carrie Rawlins. Slightly younger than Charlie, she takes on a motherly attitude toward her brothers, especially Paul. She is the first to encourage a friendly relationship between Miss Price and the children. 
* Roy Snart as Paul Rawlins. Paul is about six; his possession of the bedknob and the Isle of Naboombu children&#x27;s book lead to the group&#x27;s adventures as well as the eventual solution to the quest for the Substitutiary Locomotion spell. Paul is prone to blurting out whatever is on his mind, which occasionally leads to trouble.
* Ian Weighill as Charles &quot;Charlie&quot; Rawlins. Charlie is the eldest of the orphaned Rawlins children; eleven, going on twelve, according to Carrie, an age which Miss Price calls &quot;The Age of Not Believing&quot;. Accordingly, he is initially cynical and disbelieving of Miss Price&#x27;s magical efforts, but comes around as time goes on; it is at his initial suggestion that Ms. Price uses the Substitutiary Locomotion spell on the museum artifacts.
* Tessie O&#x27;Shea as Mrs. Jessica &quot;Jessie&quot; Hobday, the local postmistress of Pepperinge Eye and chairman of the War Activities Committee.
* Arthur Gould-Porter as Captain Ainsley Greer, a British Army captain who comes from HQ in London to inspect the Home Guard and becomes lost in the area. He is constantly running into locals who suspect him of being a Nazi in disguise.
* Reginald Owen as Major General Sir Brian Teagler, commander of the local Home Guard.
* Cyril Delevanti as Elderly Farmer
* Hank Worden as Old Home Guardsman (uncredited)

===Voices===
* Bob Holt as Codfish, a denizen of the Naboombu lagoon who judges the underwater dance contest.
* Lennie Weinrib as King Leonidas, a lion who is the ruler of the Isle of Naboombu. He is a devoted soccer player with a fearsome temper, as well as a notorious cheat who is known to make up the rules as he goes along, according to Paul&#x27;s book. Leonidas&#x27; voice is based on Robert Newton&#x27;s interpretation of Long John Silver from Disney&#x27;s live-action adaptation of &quot;Treasure Island&quot;.
** Weinrib also voices Secretary Bird, a prim and proper type who is King Leonidas&#x27;s secretary, and often bears the brunt of the King&#x27;s outbursts.
* Dallas McKennon as Bear, a brown bear who is a sailor and fisherman on the Isle of Naboombu. He is the one who pulls the bed, with Miss Price&#x27;s group on it, out of the lagoon with his fishing pole, and takes them to see the King after warning them of his temper.

==Production==
English author Mary Norton published her first children&#x27;s book, &quot;The Magic Bed-Knob&quot;, in 1943. In August 1945, Walt Disney purchased the film rights to the book. Norton then published &quot;Bonfires and Broomsticks&quot; in 1947, and the two children&#x27;s books were then combined into &quot;Bed-Knob and Broomstick&quot; in 1957. In 1961, Disney was in negotiations for the film rights to &quot;Mary Poppins&quot; with P. L. Travers; a film adaptation of &quot;Bedknobs and Broomsticks&quot; was suggested as an alternative project in case the rights were refused. During the meantime, Disney instructed Robert and Richard Sherman to begin development on the project. Sometime later, the Sherman Brothers held a story conference with producer Bill Walsh and screenwriter Don DaGradi, in which the Shermans sang a demo version of the song &quot;Eglantine&quot;. During the conference, Disney fell asleep in his chair, a moment DaGradi later immortalized in a sketch. Richard Sherman explained, &quot;[Disney] might have been tired that day...&quot; When Disney purchased the rights to &quot;Mary Poppins&quot;, the &quot;Bedknobs&quot; project was shelved.

In April 1966, the project (re-titled as &quot;The Magic Bedpost&quot;) was placed back into development, with the Sherman Brothers and Irwin Kostal set to resume their musical collaboration. However, the project was shelved again because of its similarities to &quot;Mary Poppins&quot; (1964). As the Sherman brothers&#x27; contract with the Disney studios was set to expire in 1968, they were contacted by Bill Walsh in their office to start work on the film. Then, Walsh, DaGradi, and the Sherman brothers re-assembled to work on the storyline for several months. Although there was no plan to place the film into production at the time, Walsh promised the Shermans that he would call them back to the studio and finish the project. He eventually did in November 1969. Throughout 1970 and 1971, the Sherman brothers reworked their musical compositions for the film. The song &quot;The Beautiful Briny&quot; was originally written for &quot;Mary Poppins&quot;, for a sequence where Mary sends the Banks children to several exotic locations by spinning a compass, but the sequence was deleted. The song was ultimately used in &quot;Bedknobs and Broomsticks&quot; instead.

===Casting===
Leslie Caron, Lynn Redgrave, Judy Carne, and Julie Andrews were all considered for the role of Eglantine Price. Andrews was initially offered the part, but hesitated, afraid of being typecast. Walsh later contacted Angela Lansbury, who signed onto the role on Halloween: October 31, 1969. Shortly after, Andrews, feeling she owed Disney for her film career, contacted Walsh to accept the role only to learn that Lansbury had been cast. Although Peter Ustinov was considered, Ron Moody was originally slated as Emelius Brown, but he refused to star in the film unless he received top billing which the studio would not allow. He was ultimately replaced with David Tomlinson.

The three Rawlins children—Charlie, Carrie, and Paul—were played by Ian Weighill, Cindy O&#x27;Callaghan, and Roy Snart respectively. Weighill had previously dropped out of school and began his acting career in an uncredited role as a schoolboy in &quot;David Copperfield&quot; (1969). He auditioned before Disney talent scouts for one of the child roles in &quot;Bedknobs and Broomsticks&quot; in London, and was cast as Charlie. Before &quot;Bedknobs&quot;, Snart was a child actor appearing in numerous commercials, and was cast as Paul for his &quot;impish, cheeky look&quot;. For the part of Carrie, O&#x27;Callaghan had previously acted in television commercials and later made her stage debut in a production of &quot;Peter Pan&quot; at the Scala Theatre. There, she caught the attention of Disney&#x27;s talent scouts.

===Filming===
Filming took place at the Disney studios in Burbank, California, from early March to June 10, 1970. The coastal scenes featuring German soldiers were shot on location at a nearby California beach. The opening village scenes which features Corfe Castle and long shots of Miss Price (Lansbury) on her motorbike were created using matte paintings by artist Alan Maley. Filming lasted fifty-seven days while the animation and special effects required five months each to complete.

For the Naboombu soccer sequence, the sodium vapor process was used, which was developed by Petro Vlahos in the 1960s. Animator and director Ward Kimball served as the animation director over the sequence. Directing animator Milt Kahl had designed the characters, but he was angered over the inconsistencies in the character animation. This prompted Kimball to send a memo dated on September 17, 1970, to adhere to animation cohesiveness to the animation staff. Because of the heavy special effects, the entire film had to be storyboarded in advance, shot for shot, which Lansbury later said resulted in her acting being &quot;very by the numbers&quot;.

==Release==
&quot;Bedknobs and Broomsticks&quot; had an original runtime of 141 minutes, and was scheduled to premiere at Radio City Music Hall. However, in order to accommodate for the theater&#x27;s elaborate stage show, the film had to be trimmed down to under two hours, and 23 minutes were ultimately removed from the film. The removed scenes included a minor subplot involving Roddy McDowall&#x27;s character (which was reduced to one minute) and three entire musical sequences, titled &quot;A Step in the Right Direction&quot;, &quot;With a Flair&quot;, and &quot;Nobody&#x27;s Problems&quot;. Additionally, almost three minutes were removed from the &quot;Portobello Road&quot; sequence, and the song &quot;Eglantine&quot; was also shortened.

When the film was reissued theatrically on April 13, 1979, an additional twenty minutes of footage were deleted.

===1996 restoration===
Intrigued with Lansbury&#x27;s song, &quot;A Step in the Right Direction&quot; on the original soundtrack album, Scott MacQueen, then-senior manager of Disney&#x27;s library restoration, set out to restore the film in conjunction with the film&#x27;s 25th anniversary. Most of the deleted film material was found, but some segments of &quot;Portobello Road&quot; had to be reconstructed from work prints with digital re-coloration to match the film quality of the main content. The footage for &quot;A Step in the Right Direction&quot; was unrecoverable, but the sequence was reconstructed for inclusion as a supplemental feature on home media releases of the film by linking the original music track up to existing production stills. The edit included several newly discovered songs, including &quot;Nobody&#x27;s Problems&quot;, performed by Lansbury. The number had been cut before the premiere of the film. Lansbury had only made a demo recording, singing with a solo piano because the orchestrations would have been added when the picture was scored. When the song was cut, the orchestrations had not yet been added; therefore, it was finally orchestrated and put together when it was placed back into the film.

The soundtrack for some of the spoken tracks was unrecoverable. Therefore, Lansbury and McDowall re-dubbed their parts, while other actors made ADR dubs for those who were unavailable. Voice actor Jeff Bennett recorded ADR for Mr. Browne, as health issues prevented Tomlinson from participating in recording.

The restored version of the film premiered on September 27, 1996, at the Motion Picture Academy of Arts and Sciences in Beverly Hills, California, where it was attended by Lansbury, the Sherman Brothers, Ward Kimball, and special effects artist Danny Lee. It was later broadcast on Disney Channel on August 9, 1998.

===Home media===
In 1980, Disney partnered with Fotomat Corporation on a trial distribution deal, in which &quot;Bedknobs and Broomsticks&quot; was released on VHS and LaserDisc on March 4, 1980. By October 1982, Disney partnered with RCA to release nine of their films on the CED videodisc format, and &quot;Bedknobs and Broomsticks&quot; was re-released later that year. The film was issued on VHS on October 23, 1989. It was released on VHS as an installment in the Walt Disney Masterpiece Collection on October 28, 1994.

The restored version of the film was released on laserdisc in 1997, then a subsequent VHS and DVD release with this version followed on March 20, 2001, as part of the Walt Disney Gold Classic Collection, to commemorate the 30th anniversary of the film. The reconstruction additionally marked the first time the film was presented in stereophonic sound. Along with the film, the DVD included a twenty-minute making-of featurette with the Sherman brothers, a recording session with David Tomlinson singing the ending of &quot;Portebello Road&quot;, a scrapbook containing thirteen pages of concept art, publicity, and merchandising stills, and a Film Facts supplement about the film&#x27;s production history.

A new edition called &quot;Bedknobs and Broomsticks: Enchanted Musical Edition&quot; was released on DVD on September 8, 2009. This new single-disc edition retained the restored version of the film and most of the bonus features from the 2001 DVD release. The film was released on Special Edition Blu-ray, DVD, and Digital HD on August 12, 2014, in its original 117-minute version, with the deleted scenes used in the previous reconstructed version presented in a separate section on the Blu-ray disc.

==Reception==
===Box office===
By January 1974, the film had grossed $8.25 million in box office rentals from the United States and Canada, with its final domestic rentals totaling $8.5 million. The 1979 re-release increased its North American rentals to $11.4 million.

===Critical reaction===
Vincent Canby of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote that the film is a &quot;tricky, cheerful, aggressively friendly Walt Disney fantasy for children who still find enchantment for pop-up books, plush animals by Steiff and dreams of independent flight.&quot; He further highlighted the Naboombu live-action/animated sequence as &quot;the best of Disney, going back all the way to the first &quot;Silly Symphonies&quot;&quot;. &quot;Variety&quot; wrote that &quot;what it may lack in the charm of [&quot;Mary Poppins&quot;] it more than measures in inventiveness. Indeed, it is doubtful if special effects or animation have been ever bettered or used to greater advantage. Alone they are a reason for seeing the film&quot;, and the reviewer praised the Naboombu sequence as containing &quot;not only sheer delights but technical masterpieces.&quot; Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; awarded the film two-and-a-half stars out of four, claiming that, while the film has the &quot;same technical skill and professional polish&quot; as &quot;Mary Poppins&quot;, &quot;[i]t doesn&#x27;t have much of a heart, though, and toward the end you wonder why the &quot;Poppins&quot; team thought kids would like it much.&quot; Gene Siskel of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; gave &quot;Bedknobs&quot; two stars out of four, calling the film &quot;a mishmash of story ideas and film styles&quot;. He further added that the live action/animated sequence was &quot;one bright spot in the story&quot;, but felt &quot;the difference between scenes of sea horses and storm troopers is so great that probably no story could manage it. &quot;Bedknobs&quot; tries and fails.&quot;

Pauline Kael, reviewing for &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, panned the film, writing that there is &quot;no logic in the style of the movie, and the story dribbles on for so long that it exhausts the viewer before that final magical battle begins.&quot; She concluded her review by stating: &quot;This whole production is a mixture of wizardry and ineptitude; the picture has enjoyable moments but it&#x27;s as uncertain of itself as the title indicates.&quot; Charles Champlin of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; wrote that the film was &quot;pleasant enough and harmless enough. It is also long (almost two hours) and slow. The songs are perfunctory (nothing supercalifragi-whatever) and the visual trickeries, splendid as they are, are sputtery to get the picture truly airborne. By the standards Disney has set for itself, it&#x27;s a disappointing endeavor.&quot;

On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 67% based on 36 reviews, with an average score of 6.1/10; the site&#x27;s &quot;critics consensus&quot; reads: &quot;&quot;Bedknobs and Broomsticks&quot; often feels like a pale imitation of a certain magical guardian and her wards, but a spoonful of Angela Lansbury&#x27;s witty star power helps the derivativeness go down.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a score of 59 out of 100 based on 11 reviews, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;.

===Accolades===
==Music==
===The original cast soundtrack===

The musical score for &quot;Bedknobs and Broomsticks&quot; was composed and adapted by Irwin Kostal, with all songs written by Richard M. Sherman and Robert B. Sherman. This was the Shermans&#x27; third collaboration with Kostal, with the others being &quot;Mary Poppins&quot; (1964), &quot;Chitty Chitty Bang Bang&quot; (1968), &quot;Charlotte&#x27;s Web&quot; (1973), and &quot;The Magic of Lassie&quot; (1978). A soundtrack album was released by Buena Vista Records in 1971. While the film was released in mono sound, the musical score was recorded in stereo, and the soundtrack album was released in stereo. An expanded soundtrack album was released on CD on August 13, 2002.

&quot;The Age of Not Believing&quot; received a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Original Song. &quot;With a Flair&quot;, &quot;Don&#x27;t Let Me Down&quot;, and &quot;Nobody&#x27;s Problems&quot; were cut out in 1971, but are present in the reconstructed version of the film. The footage for &quot;A Step in the Right Direction&quot; is lost. &quot;Solid Citizen&quot; and &quot;The Fundamental Element&quot; had been cut out before the production: the former was replaced by the soccer match, while parts of the latter were incorporated into &quot;Don&#x27;t Let Me Down&quot;.

The songs include:

<text>The Russian Communist Workers&#x27; Party of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (RCWP-CPSU; ; &quot;Rossiyskaya kommunisticheskaya rabochaya partiya v sostave Kommunisticheskoy partii Sovetskogo Soyuza&quot;, &quot;RKRP-KPSS&quot;) is an anti-revisionist Marxist–Leninist communist party in Russia. It is considered the republican branch of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (2001).

The RCWP-CPSU is led by Viktor Tyulkin, who was co-chairman with Anatolii Kriuchkov until the latter died in 2005). It publishes a newspaper called &quot;Trudovaja Rossija&quot; (; &quot;Working People&#x27;s Russia&quot;) and the journal &quot;Sovetskij Sojuz&quot; (; &quot;Soviet Union&quot;).

The RCWP-CPSU claims to have supported all the biggest occupations and strikes in Russia. It has links to the Russian trade union Zashchita. As of 2007, it claims about 50,000 members. The Revolutionary Communist Youth League (Bolshevik) (RCYL(B)), the youth organization of the RCWP-CPSU, is considered one of the most active communist youth organizations in Russia.

== History ==

The party was established in October 2001 under the name Russian Communist Workers&#x27; Party – Revolutionary Party of Communists (; abbreviated , ) through the unification of the Russian Communist Workers&#x27; Party, the Russian Party of Communists and the Union of Communists with the aim of resurrecting socialism and the Soviet Union.

In the 1999 Duma election, the party won 2.2% of the total vote, getting 1,481,890 votes overall. The RCWP-CPSU considers the Communist Party of the Russian Federation (CPRF) to be reformist, but for the occasion of the 2003 Duma election the party leaders decided to make an agreement with the CPRF in order not to disperse the communist vote.

In 2007, the party was de-registered by the Justice Ministry. In 2010, the RCWP-CPSU co-founded Russian registered political party Russian United Labour Front (ROT Front), which is led by Viktor Tyulkin. In April 2012, the party took its current name.

During the protests following the 2020 Belarusian presidential election, RCWP called on the workers of Belarus not to allow the protests turn into a &quot;Belarusian Maidan on the model of Kiev,&quot; referring to 2013–14 Euromaidan protests in Ukraine.

In 2021, Stepan Malentsov was elected the new First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Russian Communist Workers&#x27; Party (RCWP-CPSU) as it was decided at the XII (XXII) Congress that took place in Moscow.

=== Positions on the Ukraine Invasion ===
The party supported the recognition of the Donetsk People&#x27;s Republic and the Luhansk People&#x27;s Republic by Russia, stating that it is a decision taken &quot;much later than it should have been, but better late than never.&quot;

RCWP opposed the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine by announcing: &quot;we have no doubts that the true aims of the Russian state in this war are quite imperialistic — to strengthen the position of imperialist Russia in world market competition...&quot; and the party called for an end to &quot;fratricidal conflicts.&quot; Later the party said the war had a &#x27;positive component&#x27;, assessing Russia&#x27;s actions during the invasion of Ukraine as a fight against fascism and protection of the people of Donbass, yet it still defined the invasion as being imperialism on the part of the Russian Federation.

In 2022, the youth wing of the RCWP split from the party due to its support for the ongoing Russo-Ukrainian War.

<text>The Canadian Federation of Engineering Students (CFES) (&quot;Fédération canadienne étudiante de génie&quot; in French) is the national association of undergraduate engineering student societies in Canada and exists to organize activities, provide services and interact with professional and other bodies at the national and international level for the benefit of Canadian engineering students. The organization is a bilingual non-profit corporation based in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada, managed by a volunteer team of engineering students and recent graduates from across Canada.

==Activities==
===CFES Canadian Engineering Leadership Conference===
The flagship event of the CFES, the Canadian Engineering Leadership Conference (CELC), formerly known as Congress, serves as both the Annual General Meeting of the Federation, as well as a leadership development forum for engineering students from across Canada. Congress is typically held in the first week or January, spanning a full week of leadership development sessions, informational presentations, guest speakers from industry, a career fair and culminating in plenary, the decision making body of the CFES. At congress, the CFES National Executive and other officer positions are elected, and bids are made to host other CFES activities.

===Publications===
The CFES Project Magazine, also known as ProMag, is a magazine published by the CFES and distributed to member schools. In 2012, ProMag was discontinued due to a shifted interest in providing an online journal that is more easily accessible. Additionally, the content of ProMag did not any longer satisfy the desires of CFES members.

Subsequently, Promag was replaced by the CFES Publication (also called the Pub), which is an online publication that is focused on promoting the research and super-curricular activities of Canadian undergraduate engineering students. The Pub is a service provided by the Federation, and is no longer up for bid at Congress. The Pub has since become defunct.

In the 2019-2020 Operating Year, the CFES decided to revive Project Magazine as an in-house online journal, celebrating the different regions of the federation through articles and stories submitted to a Task Force. It exists as a virtual publication.

===Canadian Engineering Competition (CEC)===
The Canadian Engineering Competition (CEC) (&quot;Compétition canadienne d&#x27;ingénierie&quot; in French) is an annual competition involving more than 150 of the best and brightest engineering students from across Canada.

==Services==
===CFES Lean Six Sigma===
The CFES offers a certification course in Lean Six Sigma. Formerly available through a partnership with Canada Post, the service could only be offered in one of Vancouver, Edmonton, Toronto, or Montreal- one of Canada Post&#x27;s major hubs. In 2019, the CFES obtained a partnership agreement with Abacus which re-instated a more nationally available event for members to participate in. Typically, it occurs over the course of two weekends- one in English, and one in French, respectively.

====Host schools====
* 2019 École de technologie supérieure (Montreal, Quebec)
* 2020 York University (Virtual)

===CFES Conference on Diversity in Engineering (CDE)===
The CFES is offers the Conference on Diversity in Engineering (CDE) to its members.

NCWIE began in 1990 as a local conference at Queen&#x27;s University and in 2003 it became a national event. Other Canadian universities were invited to host it after the 2007 conference. The University of Western Ontario was the first school after Queen&#x27;s University to host the event in 2008. Shortly thereafter, NCWIE was made a service of the Canadian Federation of Engineering Students.

The first year that the CFES Conference on Diversity in Engineering is offered is 2015, denoting the end of the National Conference on Women in Engineering.

<text>The Baptist Churches of New Zealand () is an Baptist Christian denomination in New Zealand. Its headquarters are in Auckland, and it is affiliated with the Baptist World Alliance. 

==History==
Several Baptists settled in New Zealand in the 1840s, but the first Baptist minister, Decimus Dolamore from Yorkshire, England, did not arrive until May 1851. Dolamore settled in Nelson and was involved in the formation of the first Baptist Church in New Zealand - Nelson Baptist Church - that same year. He was instrumental in obtaining a change in the law to allow Baptist ministers to perform marriage ceremonies; until 1854, only Catholic and Anglican priests were allowed to do so. Dolamore later went to Christchurch and was the first minister for that congregation.

The Canterbury Baptist Association was formed in 1874. This association started the &quot;New Zealand Baptist&quot; magazine, which has been published monthly since January 1881. The Baptist Union of New Zealand was formed at Wellington in October 1882. At that time, there were 22 Baptist churches, with 1,890 members. The New Zealand Baptist Missionary Society was formed at the 1885 conference of the Baptist Union. At the 1891 conference, the Union established a plan to divide the country into four districts - &quot;Otago/Southland&quot; (org. 1892), &quot;Auckland&quot; (org. 1892), &quot;Canterbury &amp; Westland&quot; (org. 1892), and &quot;Central&quot; (org. 1896). Central District was later divided into the Central District Association and the &quot;Wellington&quot; Association, and &quot;South Auckland&quot; was formed in 1939. South Auckland was later divided into the &quot;Waikato&quot; Association and the &quot;Bay of Plenty&quot; Association (now Bay of Plenty &amp; Eastland). The &quot;Top of the South&quot; Association was formed in 1990. Some groups were called &quot;auxiliary&quot; and some &quot;association&quot;, but in 1957, the term &quot;auxiliary&quot; was dropped in favor of the term &quot;association&quot;. There are currently 9 associations.

According to a census published by the association in 2023, it claimed 240 churches and 20,627 members.

==Beliefs==
Theologically, the Baptist Union member churches are deeply influenced by the charismatic renewal movement, though there is no official position regarding the movement. A study in 1989 indicated that 69% of churches belonging to the Baptist Union identified with the charismatic movement. A smaller portion of member churches are Reformed in doctrine.

== Schools ==
The Union supports education through Carey Baptist College in Penrose, Auckland, and Te Whare Amorangi, designed for Māori men and women, in Papatoetoe, Auckland. 

== Missionary Organization ==
The Convention has a missionary organization, NZBMS 

==Prominent New Zealand Baptists==
*Decimus Dolamore - first Baptist minister in New Zealand
*Thomas Spurgeon - successful evangelist and son of famous English Baptist preacher, Charles Haddon Spurgeon
*Charles Dallaston - &quot;the Father of the Baptist Union&quot;
*John James North - the first principal of the New Zealand Baptist Theological College
*Hopestill Pillow - Baptist Missionary in the Zenana Missions to India.
*Charles Henry Carter (29 October 1828 – 6 July 1914) - a Baptist missionary to Ceylon. Literary Works - Translations. Carter translated directly from the Greek and Hebrew texts, rather than the English. The Sinhalese work was done in vernacular language, that it could embody the message in a dialect that was understood by the people everywhere. His works include:
**Sinhalese New Testament 1855
**Sinhalese Book of Psalms 1863
**Sinhalese Old Testament 1869
**English – Sinhalese Dictionary 1881
**Sinhalese – English Dictionary 1889
Towards the end of his life, Carter became Pastor of the Ponsonby Baptist Church in New Zealand. He was the first president of the Baptist Union of New Zealand.
Bishop Coppelstone, Anglican Primate of India is said to have described Carter as the &quot;foremost Sinhalese scholar of this age&quot;.

<doc id="357537" wikidata="Q874752" url="?curid=357537" title="Lilian Rolfe">
<text>Lilian Vera Rolfe, (26 April 1914 – 5 February 1945), code name Nadine, was an agent of the United Kingdom&#x27;s clandestine Special Operations Executive (SOE) organisation in France during World War II. The purpose of SOE was to conduct espionage, sabotage and reconnaissance in occupied Europe against the Axis powers, especially Nazi Germany. SOE agents in France allied themselves with French Resistance groups and supplied them with weapons and equipment parachuted in from England.

Rolfe was a wireless operator for the Historian Network based in Orleans. After four months of work in France, she was captured by the Germans on 31 July 1944. She was executed in Ravensbrück concentration camp in late January 1945.

==Early life==
Rolfe and her twin sister Helen Fedora Rolfe were the daughters of George Rolfe, a British accountant working in Paris, and a Russian mother. Although she grew up in Paris, Rolfe came to England for a summer in Britain to learn English, but became ill with rheumatic fever. In 1933, when she was nineteen, the family moved to Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Rolfe was working in the press section of the British Embassy when World War II began in 1939. Part of her job was monitoring German ship movements in and out of Rio. In February 1943, Rolfe left Brazil and her family behind to join the war effort in England. Her ship was badly damaged, probably by a German mine, in the ocean crossing. In England she joined the WAAF on 16 May 1943. Her facility with languages brought her to the attention of the SOE and she joined the organization on 24 November 1943. SOE trained her as a wireless operator. She was unhappy during her training because of a failed romance.

==France==
On 5 April 1944, Rolfe was dropped off by Westland Lysander airplane at a clandestine airfield near the village of Azay-sur-Cher (near Tours) in German occupied France. Strapped around her waist was a wireless which weighed only including its carrying case, a vast improvement over the cumbersome B-2 wireless weighing used by previous SOE agents. Rolfe was assigned to work in the Historian network (or circuit) headed by George Alfred &quot;Teddy&quot; Wilkinson and based in the city of Orleans. At the time of her arrival, SOE was infiltrating numerous agents, especially wireless operators, into France in preparation of the Allied invasion of France, (D-day), which would take place on 6 June 1944.

In accordance with SOE doctrine to minimize contact with other agents, Rolfe did not meet with Wilkinson until 2 June. In the meantime, she met and worked with the local French resistance organization, the Maquis, sought out landing sites for clandestine aircraft and parachute drops of supplies, and established safe houses. She sent a total of 67 wireless messages to SOE headquarters in London enabling the SOE to air drop supplies and arms for the Maquis in preparation for their role in hindering the German response to the D-day landings. She moved from place to place and between transmissions hid her radio in various locations. She was involved in a skirmish between the Germans and the Maquis near Olivet.

==Capture and Execution==
Troubles began in late June when Wilkinson was captured (and later executed) by the Germans. Rolfe continued working under a local leader named Pierre Charié. However, on 31 July the retreating Germans swept the town of Nangis to arrest suspected resisters. In one house they anticipated finding a resister, but instead they found Rolfe, an unexpected treasure, a SOE wireless operator. Her documents were suspicious and they soon found her radio.

Rolfe was interrogated at SD headquarters at 84 Avenue Foch in Paris and imprisoned at Fresnes Prison. On 8 August 1944, with the allies advancing on Paris, Rolfe and other captured SOE agents was sent by train to Germany. In late August she reached Ravensbrück concentration camp for women. Along with SOE agents Violette Szabo and Denise Bloch she volunteered for a work party at Torgau in Saxony, where conditions were better than at Ravensbrūck. They attempted to escape but failed. Sent back to Ravensbrück, they were beaten and put in an underground bunker. On 19 October, they were sent to Königsberg in Brandenburg where they were forced to do heavy labor in winter conditions. Recalled to Ravensbrück in late January 1945, they were in pitiful condition. Rolfe was unable to walk and Bloch was &quot;suffering from gangrene.&quot; A few days later they were taken to the courtyard by the crematorium. Camp commandant Fritz Suhren read the order for their execution and they were each shot in the back of the head with a small caliber pistol. Their bodies were cremated. An eyewitness said the women were &quot;very brave&quot; and that Commandant Suhren was annoyed that the Gestapo &quot;did not themselves carry out the execution.&quot;

==Honours==
The name of Lilian Rolfe is engraved on the Runnymede Memorial in Surrey, England. The &quot;Lilian Rolfe House&quot; at the Vincennes Estate, Lambeth was dedicated to her memory. In her honour, the government of France posthumously awarded her the Croix de Guerre. In the town of Montargis in the Loiret département, where she had been active, a street was named for her alias: &quot;Rue Claudie Rolfe&quot;. As one of the SOE agents who died for the liberation of France, she is listed on the &quot;Roll of Honour&quot; on the Valençay SOE Memorial in the town of Valençay, in the Indre departément of France. Like many female agents she was seconded into the First Aid Nursing Yeomanry (FANY) when she joined SOE. Thus she is also commemorated on the FANY memorial at St Paul&#x27;s Church Knightsbridge in London. On 19 August 2021 a plaque was installed on the house Rolfe was born in (32 avenue Duquesne in the 7th arrondissement of Paris) due to the efforts of Barbara Cronk, a member of the Rolfe family.

In the 1958 film Carve Her Name with Pride, the character of Lilian Rolfe was played by Anne Leon.

<doc id="357539" wikidata="Q1902301" url="?curid=357539" title="Petard">
<text>A petard is a small bomb used for blowing up gates and walls when breaching fortifications, originally invented in France in 1579. A typical petard was a conical or rectangular metal device containing of gunpowder, with a slow match for a fuse.

==Etymology==
&quot;Pétard&quot; comes from the Middle French &quot;péter&quot;, to fart, from the root &quot;pet&quot;, expulsion of intestinal gas, derived from the Latin &quot;peditus&quot;, past participle of &quot;pedere&quot;, to break wind. In modern French, a &quot;pétard&quot; is a firecracker (and it is the basis for the word for firecracker in several other European languages).

&quot;Pétardiers&quot; were deployed during sieges of castles or fortified cities. The &quot;pétard&quot;, a rather primitive and exceedingly dangerous explosive device, comprised a brass or iron bell-shaped device filled with gunpowder and affixed to a wooden base called a &quot;madrier&quot;. This was attached to a wall or gate using hooks and rings, the fuse lit and, if successful, the resulting explosive force, concentrated at the target point, would blow a hole in the obstruction, allowing assault troops to enter.

Shakespeare&#x27;s phrase &quot;hoist with his own petard&quot;meaning that one could be lifted (blown) upward by one&#x27;s own bomb, or in other words, be foiled by one&#x27;s own planhas become an idiom that means &quot;to be harmed by one&#x27;s own plan (to harm someone else)&quot; or &quot;to fall into one&#x27;s own trap&quot;.

== Overview ==
Petards were often placed either inside tunnels under walls or directly upon gates. The petard&#x27;s shape allowed the concussive pressure of the blast to be applied entirely towards the destruction of the target structure. Depending on design, a petard could be secured by propping it against the wall or gate using beams, as illustrated, or nailing it in place on a &quot;madrier&quot; (a thick wooden board fixed in advance to the end of the petard).

== Variants ==

In military use, a &quot;petard mortar&quot; was a spigot mortar (a weapon that fires explosive projectiles, known as [&quot;mortar&quot;] &quot;bombs&quot;, at low velocities, short ranges and parabolic ballistic trajectories) of a bore, known to its crews as the &quot;flying dustbin&quot; due to the characteristics of its projectile, an un-aerodynamic charge that could be fired up to . The weapon was carried by the Churchill AVRE tank and was sufficient to breach or demolish many bunkers and earthworks.

In Maltese English, home-made fireworks—a popular and widespread albeit highly dangerous hobby in Malta—are called petards (the word in Maltese, &quot;murtal&quot;, is related to &quot;mortar&quot;). These petards are detonated by the dozen during feasts dedicated to local patron saints. Maltese petards are made by common people without formal education in chemistry, as an exercise in traditional handiwork.

<doc id="357543" wikidata="Q7990769" url="?curid=357543" title="What's Happening!!">
<text>What&#x27;s Happening!! is an American sitcom television series that first aired on ABC from August 5, 1976, premiering as a summer series. It returned as a weekly series from November 1976 until its April 1979 conclusion. &quot;What&#x27;s Happening!!&quot; was loosely based on the Eric Monte-penned film &quot;Cooley High&quot;. From 1985 until 1988, a sequel series titled &quot;What&#x27;s Happening Now!!&quot; aired in first-run syndication, with most of the major cast members reprising their roles.

&quot;What&#x27;s Happening!!&quot; was Bud Yorkin&#x27;s second series after he ended his partnership with Norman Lear and Tandem Productions. The show was produced by TOY Productions, which was formed by Yorkin, Saul Turteltaub, and Bernie Orenstein after their split.

==Production==

The pilot episode, &quot;The Birthday Present&quot;, was videotaped in front of a live audience at ABC Television Studios in the Los Feliz section of Los Angeles on March 16, 1976. Three additional episodes were videotaped that June, with the plan to release &quot;What&#x27;s Happening!!&quot; as a short-duration &quot;summer series&quot; in August, 1976. The first episode aired, &quot;The Runaway&quot;, was actually the second episode taped, but was used as the premiere because it featured Fred Berry&#x27;s dancing skills in a short scene.

The series was picked up after a successful summer run, and additional episodes were ordered for a November, 1976 airdate. Production was moved from ABC to Golden West Videotape Division Studios, an older, but larger facility, where it would remain for the rest of the series.

During the second season, Fred Berry demanded pay increases and improved studio accommodations for the actors by using the show&#x27;s first season&#x27;s success as leverage. The accommodations issue eventually led to a walkout by Berry and Thomas during the second-season episode &quot;If I&#x27;m Elected&quot; (leaving Haywood Nelson to carry the entire episode, with Shirley Hemphill stepping to the forefront, along with Bryan O&#x27;Dell and Debbi Morgan in featured speaking parts). Producer Bud Yorkin, in turn, suspended the pair and forced them to sign $25,000 promissory notes to return to the show and prevent further walkouts.

In addition, Mabel King offered producers input on her character and storylines during the second season, specifically that her character&#x27;s ex-husband, Bill (Thalmus Rasulala), return full-time in order for the children to have (once again) married parents, showcasing what she felt would be a strong Black family. The producers did not incorporate King&#x27;s suggestion, which resulted in additional tension on-set and a much-reduced role for King during the second season. Her character, Mama, was not written out of the show but rather limited to brief appearances on set (where she would say she was &quot;leaving for work&quot; or &quot;going to the store&quot;) or mentioned in passing by other characters as being &quot;at work&quot;.

==Series changes==

The show changed significantly in the third season, with Raj and Rerun graduating high school (Rerun after seven years, ostensibly due to a learning disability), with the two moving into their own apartment near the University of Southern California. Mabel King left the show (her character, in storyline, moved to Phoenix, Arizona, to &quot;tend to a sick relative&quot;), and Shirley moved into the Thomas household as a boarder and Dee&#x27;s guardian. Also, several new recurring characters were introduced. The first was a basketball player whom Roger tutored and nicknamed &quot;The Snake&quot; (played by Leland Smith). The other characters were white police detective &quot;Big Earl&quot; Barnett (played by John Welsh) and his son &quot;Little Earl&quot; Barnett (played by David Hollander), who were neighbors in the apartment building where Roger and Rerun lived.

What became the role of &quot;Little Earl&quot; was initially created to be filled by ten-year-old Gary Coleman at the suggestion of ABC President Fred Silverman. Silverman was a proponent of Coleman and, feeling that breakout stardom was around the corner for the young talent, wanted him added to the show. When Silverman left ABC in 1978 to head rival network NBC, he had &quot;Diff&#x27;rent Strokes&quot; created for Coleman; it ran for eight years and was highly rated.

==Cancellation==
During the third season (1978–79), Berry, still dissatisfied with his pay, again threatened to strike (as a result he did not appear in the third-season episode &quot;Dee, the Cheerleader&quot;). Thomas supported and joined Berry in his efforts which led to a heated meeting with the executive producers, culminating with Berry accusing them of racism. Unable to come to terms, the producers opted to cancel the series.

&quot;What&#x27;s Happening!!&quot; aired its last episode on April 28, 1979. A year later, Hemphill starred in her own sitcom, &quot;One in a Million&quot;, which premiered in January 1980 and ended on July 23, 1980, after being on ABC for several months.

==Ratings==
&quot;What&#x27;s Happening!!&quot; was a modest ratings success.

==Success and &quot;What&#x27;s Happening Now!!&quot;==

&quot;What&#x27;s Happening!!&quot; was widely syndicated in the 1980s. Appealing to both children and adults in a similar way to &quot;The Brady Bunch&quot; and &quot;Happy Days&quot;, it accordingly aired during transitional hours where stations would change their after-school programming from cartoons to evening sitcoms. In many markets, &quot;What&#x27;s Happening!!&quot; garnered higher ratings in reruns than during its initial broadcast. 

With this success in mind, a spinoff of the show was produced entitled &quot;What&#x27;s Happening Now!!&quot;, airing from 1985 to 1988. Over its 66 episodes, the show was a modest success.

==Home media==
Sony Pictures Home Entertainment has released all three seasons of &quot;What&#x27;s Happening!!&quot;

On August 27, 2013, it was announced that Mill Creek Entertainment had acquired the rights to various television series from the Sony Pictures library including &quot;What&#x27;s Happening!!&quot; On September 2, 2014, they re-released the first two seasons on DVD.

On April 21, 2015, Mill Creek released a budget-priced complete series set, a 6-disc set featuring all 65 episodes.

== Episodes ==

==Syndication==
The show was syndicated on many local channels (with all 66 episodes of sequel series &quot;What&#x27;s Happening Now!!&quot; joining the syndication package in the fall of 1988 to total 131 episodes) and continued in an on-again, off-again manner until 2009.

BET reran both series from September 20, 1993, to October 27, 1995.

TV Land reran the show during the 2005–2006 season.

As of March 1, 2013, cable network TV One shows reruns of &quot;What&#x27;s Happening!!&quot;

On December 2, 2013, the newly rebranded Encore Black channel started airing &quot;What&#x27;s Happening!!&quot;

Starting January 2, 2017, the digital broadcast network Antenna TV began airing the original series.

<doc id="357556" wikidata="Q616852" url="?curid=357556" title="Oh Yeah! Cartoons">
<text>Oh Yeah! Cartoons is an American animated anthology series that aired on Nickelodeon. Created by Fred Seibert, it was produced by Frederator Incorporated and Nickelodeon Animation Studio, running as part of Nickelodeon&#x27;s Nicktoons lineup. In the show&#x27;s first season, it was hosted by a variety of schoolchildren, and the second season was hosted by Kenan Thompson of &quot;All That&quot; and &quot;Kenan &amp; Kel&quot;, and later Josh Server of &quot;All That&quot; in the third and final season. Bill Burnett composed the show&#x27;s theme music.

In terms of total volume, &quot;Oh Yeah! Cartoons&quot; remains TV&#x27;s biggest animation development program ever. Giving several dozen filmmakers the opportunity to create 96 seven-minute cartoons, the series eventually yielded three dedicated half-hour spin-off shows produced by Frederator: &quot;The Fairly OddParents&quot;, &quot;ChalkZone&quot;, and &quot;My Life as a Teenage Robot&quot;.

Nickelodeon&#x27;s &quot;Oh Yeah!&quot; featured in its first season a total of 39 brand new seven-minute cartoons, surpassing the number of new cartoons and characters on any other single network. In its full run, &quot;Oh Yeah! Cartoons&quot; featured and produced 96 cartoons.

Many of the animated shorts were created by cartoonists who later became more prominent, including Bob Boyle, Bill Burnett, Jaime Diaz, Greg Emison, John Eng, Thomas R. Fitzgerald, John Fountain, Antoine Guilbaud, Butch Hartman, Larry Huber, Ken Kessel, Alex Kirwan, Steve Marmel, Seth MacFarlane, Zac Moncrief, Carlos Ramos, Rob Renzetti, C. Miles Thompson, Byron Vaughns, Pat Ventura, Vincent Waller, and Dave Wasson.

Many of its animators featured had worked two years earlier on Cartoon Network&#x27;s &quot;What a Cartoon!&quot;, produced in the same concept by Hanna-Barbera and Cartoon Network Studios, which was also created by Seibert while he was president of that historical studio.

==Legacy==
&quot;Oh Yeah! Cartoons&quot; is the second Frederator short cartoon incubator. Frederator Studios has persisted in the tradition of surfacing new talent, characters, and series with several cartoon shorts &quot;incubators,&quot; including (as of 2016): &quot;What A Cartoon!&quot; (Cartoon Network, 1995), &quot;The Meth Minute 39&quot; (Channel Frederator, 2008), &quot;Random! Cartoons&quot; (Nickelodeon/Nicktoons, 2008), &quot;Too Cool! Cartoons&quot; (Cartoon Hangover, 2012), and &quot;GO! Cartoons&quot; (Cartoon Hangover, 2017). These laboratories have spun off notable series like: &quot;Dexter&#x27;s Laboratory&quot;, &quot;The Powerpuff Girls&quot;, &quot;ChalkZone&quot;, &quot;Johnny Bravo&quot;, &quot;Cow and Chicken&quot;, &quot;My Life as a Teenage Robot&quot;, &quot;Courage the Cowardly Dog&quot;, &quot;The Fairly OddParents&quot;, &quot;Nite Fite&quot;, &quot;Fanboy &amp; Chum Chum&quot;, &quot;Adventure Time&quot;, &quot;Bravest Warriors&quot;, &quot;Rocket Dog&quot;, and &quot;Bee and PuppyCat&quot;.

<doc id="357559" wikidata="Q1869896" url="?curid=357559" title="Lord Keeper of the Great Seal">
<text>The Lord Keeper of the Great Seal of England, and later of Great Britain, was formerly an officer of the English Crown charged with physical custody of the Great Seal of England. This position evolved into that of one of the Great Officers of State.

== History ==
The seal was adopted by Edward the Confessor, and its custody was at first entrusted to a chancellor. The office of chancellor from the time of Thomas Becket onwards varied much in importance. The holder being a churchman, he was not only engaged in the business of his diocese, but was sometimes away from England. Consequently, it became not unusual to place the personal custody of the great seal in the hands of a &quot;vice-chancellor&quot; or &quot;keeper&quot;; this was also the practice followed during a temporary vacancy in the chancellorship.

This office gradually developed into a permanent appointment, and the lord keeper acquired the right of discharging all the duties connected with the great seal. He was usually, though not necessarily, a peer, and held office during the king&#x27;s pleasure. He was appointed merely by delivery of the seal, and not, like the chancellor, by patent. His status was definitely fixed (in the case of lord keeper Sir Nicholas Bacon) by the Lord Keeper Act 1562 (5 Eliz 1 c. 18), which declared him entitled to &quot;like place, pre-eminence, jurisdiction, execution of laws, and all other customs, commodities, and advantages&quot; as the Lord Chancellor. In subsequent reigns the lord keeper was generally raised to the chancellorship, and retained the custody of the seal.

The last lord keeper was Robert Henley, afterwards Earl of Northington, who was made chancellor on the accession of George III.

<text>Marc Ferrez (7 December 1843 – 12 January 1923) was a Brazilian photographer active in Rio de Janeiro. He photographed Brazil from south to north, but paid more attention to his home city, Rio de Janeiro. Ferrez is most well known for his albums of railway constructions and the panoramic views of the city of Rio de Janeiro and its development. His other popular works document architecture and Brazil&#x27;s natural features, such as mountains, waterfalls, and jungles. Ferrez is considered by photography historians to be a master at his craft; his work is on the same level as famous photographers William Henry Jackson and Eadweard Muybridge.

== Biography ==
Marc Ferrez was the son of the French sculptor and engraver Zepherin Ferrez who moved to Rio de Janeiro in 1816. Marc Ferrez was born in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. He studied in Paris then came back to Rio as an apprentice to photographer Franz Keller of Germany. In 1865, Ferrez opened his own photography studio where he primarily focused of landscapes and Brazilian nature. His work became so popular that Emperor Dom Pedro II gave him funds to support his art, allowing Ferrez to explore every angle that the camera had to offer. Just eight years after its opening, in 1873, his studio burned down. He returned to France to purchase a new camera, opting for one that had the capability of taking panoramic photos. This was a view of photography that was still in its infancy. When he finally returned to Rio de Janeiro, he focused on rural landscapes and documenting slaves working on the plantations. Between 1875 and 1876, Ferrez joined American Charles Frederick Hartt on a geological and geographic expedition to the inner province of Bahia. It was during this trip that Ferrez photographed the indigenous Botocudo tribe, and widely employed techniques of panoramic photography, of which he would later be regarded as a master.

Ferrez&#x27;s life was dedicated to the art of photography and he is considered one of the greatest photographers of his time. His production was massive, and his photographs document the consolidation of Brazil as a nation and Rio de Janeiro as a metropolis. Emperor Pedro II declared Ferrez the &quot;photographer of the Royal Navy&quot;, because of his superior skill of neutralizing the ships movements. In 1876, he entered his photos with an ethnological interest into the Centennial International Exhibition in Pennsylvania. He won a gold medal. In 1882 he won in the South American Continental Exhibition in Buenos Aires. In 1904, he entered his material into the St. Louis Worlds Fair and was the only photographer to win a gold medal. In 1907, he opened his own picture house in Rio de Janeiro, Pathé Cinema. It was here that he tried out new technology that enhanced the field of photography. 

During the end of his life he focused more on photographing architecture and street scenes in Rio de Janeiro. Ferrez died in 1923 and left thousands of pictures and reproductions of his works.

<doc id="357565" wikidata="Q72501980" url="?curid=357565" title="Potassium sodium tartrate">
<text>Potassium sodium tartrate tetrahydrate, also known as Rochelle salt, is a double salt of tartaric acid first prepared (in about 1675) by an apothecary, Pierre Seignette, of La Rochelle, France. Potassium sodium tartrate and monopotassium phosphate were the first materials discovered to exhibit piezoelectricity. This property led to its extensive use in crystal phonograph cartridges, microphones and earpieces during the post-World War II consumer electronics boom of the mid-20th century. Such transducers had an exceptionally high output with typical pick-up cartridge outputs as much as 2 volts or more. Rochelle salt is deliquescent so any transducers based on the material deteriorated if stored in damp conditions.

It has been used medicinally as a laxative. It has also been used in the process of silvering mirrors. It is an ingredient of Fehling&#x27;s solution (reagent for reducing sugars). It is used in electroplating, in electronics and piezoelectricity, and as a combustion accelerator in cigarette paper (similar to an oxidizer in pyrotechnics).

In organic synthesis, it is used in aqueous workups to break up emulsions, particularly for reactions in which an aluminium-based hydride reagent was used. Sodium potassium tartrate is also important in the food industry. 

It is a common precipitant in protein crystallography and is also an ingredient in the Biuret reagent which is used to measure protein concentration. This ingredient maintains cupric ions in solution at an alkaline pH.

==Preparation==
The starting material is tartar with a minimum 68% tartaric acid content. This is first dissolved in water or in the mother liquor of a previous batch. It is then basified with hot saturated sodium hydroxide solution to pH 8, decolorized with activated charcoal, and chemically purified before being filtered. The filtrate is evaporated to 42 °Bé at 100 °C, and passed to granulators in which Seignette&#x27;s salt crystallizes on slow cooling. The salt is separated from the mother liquor by centrifugation, accompanied by washing of the granules, and is dried in a rotary furnace and sieved before packaging. Commercially marketed grain sizes range from 2000 μm to &lt; 250 μm (powder).

Larger crystals of Rochelle salt have been grown under conditions of reduced gravity and convection on board Skylab.
Rochelle salt crystals will begin to dehydrate when the relative humidity drops to about 30% and will begin to dissolve at relative humidities above 84%.

==Piezoelectricity==

In 1824, Sir David Brewster demonstrated piezoelectric effects using Rochelle salts, which led to him naming the effect pyroelectricity.

In 1919, Alexander McLean Nicolson worked with Rochelle salt, developing audio-related inventions like microphones and speakers at Bell Labs.

==Current Applications==

Rochelle salt-based composites have gained renewed interest for their applications in impact energy absorption and smart sensing technologies.
 Recent research has demonstrated the growth of Rochelle salt crystals within 3D-printed cuttlebone-inspired structures, resulting in multifunctional composites that combine mechanical robustness with piezoelectric properties. The chambered microstructure inspired by cuttlefish bone provides high stiffness and energy absorption capacity, making these composites suitable for protective equipment and structural health monitoring. 
The developed composites exhibit remarkable mechanical performance, with enhanced fracture toughness and resistance to impact. Under cyclic loading, they maintain consistent piezoelectric output for up to 7000 cycles. Impact tests show voltage outputs peaking at approximately 8 V, and a piezoelectric coefficient (d33) around 30 pC/N. These properties enable real-time sensing of impact forces, making the material suitable for use in wearable protective gear, such as smart armor for athletes and fall detection devices for the elderly.
Sustainability and recyclability are notable advantages of this material. The Rochelle salt crystals can be dissolved and re-grown within the structure, allowing the composite to be repaired after damage. Recycled samples retain up to 95% of their original mechanical and piezoelectric performance.
Potential applications extend to sports safety equipment, aerospace structures, military armor, and biomedical monitoring devices, highlighting the versatility and functionality of Rochelle salt composites in modern material science.

<text>The Dominion Land Survey (DLS; ) is the method used to divide most of Western Canada into one-square-mile (2.6 km2) sections for agricultural and other purposes. It is based on the layout of the Public Land Survey System used in the United States, but has several differences. The DLS is the dominant survey method in the Prairie provinces, and it is also used in British Columbia along the Railway Belt (near the main line of the Canadian Pacific Railway), and in the Peace River Block in the northeast of the province. (Although British Columbia entered Confederation with control over its own lands, unlike the Northwest Territories and the Prairie provinces, British Columbia transferred these lands to the federal Government as a condition of the building of the Canadian Pacific Railway. The federal government then surveyed these areas under the DLS.)

== History ==
The survey was begun in 1871, shortly after Manitoba and the North-West Territories became part of Canada, following the purchase of Rupert&#x27;s Land from the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company. Covering about , the survey system and its terminology are deeply ingrained in the rural culture of the Prairies. The DLS is the world&#x27;s largest survey grid laid down in a single integrated system. The first formal survey done in western Canada was by Peter Fidler in 1813.

The inspiration for the Dominion Land Survey System was the plan for Manitoba (and later Saskatchewan and Alberta) to be agricultural economies. With a large number of European settlers arriving, Manitoba was undergoing a large change so grasslands and parklands were surveyed, settled, and farmed. The Dominion Land Survey system was developed because the farm name and field position descriptions used in northern Europe were not organized or flexible enough, and the township and concession system used in eastern Canada was not satisfactory. The first meridian was chosen at 97°27′28.4″ west longitude and was established in 1869. Another six meridians were established after.

A number of places are excluded from the survey system: these include federal lands such as First Nation reserves, federal parks, and air weapon ranges. The surveys do not encroach on reserves because that land was established before the surveys began. When the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company relinquished its title to the Dominion on July 15, 1870, via the Deed of Surrender, it received Section 8 and all of Section 26 excluding the northeast quarter. These lands were gradually sold by the company and in 1984 they donated the remaining to the Saskatchewan Wildlife Association.

The surveying of western Canada was divided into five basic surveys. Each survey&#x27;s layout was slightly different from the others. The first survey began in 1871 and ended in 1879 and covers some of southern Manitoba and a little of Saskatchewan. The second and smallest survey, in 1880, was used in only small areas of Saskatchewan. This system differs from the first survey because rather than running section lines parallel to the eastern boundary they run true north–south. The largest and most important of these surveys was the third, which covers more land than all the others surveys put together. This survey began in 1881. That method of surveying is still used in Saskatchewan and Manitoba. The fourth and fifth surveys were used only in some townships in British Columbia.

The reason that the Canadian government was pushing to subdivide Manitoba, Saskatchewan, and Alberta was to affirm Canadian sovereignty over these lands. The United States was undergoing rapid expansion in the 1860s, and the Canadian government was afraid that the Americans would expand into Canadian territory. Canada&#x27;s introduction of a railway and surveying was a means to discourage American encroachment. Sir John A. Macdonald remarked in 1870 that the Americans &quot;are resolved to do all they can short of war, to get possession of our western territory, and we must take immediate and vigorous steps to counteract them.&quot;

The beginning of the Dominion Land Survey marked a new era for western Canada. Railways were making their way to the West and the population of western regions began to increase. The introduction of the survey system marked the end of the nomadic ways for the First Nations and Metis. This did not go over well and was a catalyst to the events of the Red River Rebellion.

Being a surveyor was not easy. The hours were long, the time away from civilization was longer, and the elements were unforgiving. A survey party generally consisted of up to 20 members, which would include a party chief, chain men, a cook, people to saw trees, a recorder, and people to turn angles. All travel was either on horseback or by foot. To begin surveying a party chief would have to buy approximately $400 worth of instruments. These instruments included an alidade, dumpy level, theodolite, Gunter&#x27;s chain (which was replaced by a steel tape), and a solar compass or a vernier compass.

The Dominion Land Survey system was proposed in 1869 by John Stoughton Dennis. The initial plan, though based on the square townships of the American Public Lands Survey System, involved 9-mile townships divided into sixty-four 800-acre sections consisting of four 200-acre lots each. Work to establish the first meridian and few township outlines began and quickly ended in 1869 when a party of Metis symbolically stepped on a survey chain, beginning the Red River Resistance. Work resumed in 1871; however, the system was redesigned to use 6-mile townships with 640-acre sections based on a suggestion from Lieutenant-Governor of the North-West Territories William McDougall, who advocated that most of the settlers would come from the United States, so it was &quot;advisable to offer them lots of a size to which they have been accustomed.&quot; The Dominion Land Survey System still differed from the Public Land System because it contained road allowances.

The Dominion Land Survey was enormous. Around are estimated to have been subdivided into quarter sections, 27 million of which were surveyed by 1883 (14 years after the system&#x27;s inception). The amount of work undertaken between 1871 and 1930 is given justice by the amount of paperwork submitted: the maps, plans, and memos transferred by the Canadian government to the provinces filled approximately 200 railway cars. This did not include closed or dormant files, which would fill 9,000 filing cabinets and weigh about 227 tons.

Until very recently, surveying to take distance and angular measurements was done with manually controlled instruments. Distance was measured using either a chain or more recently a transit or range finder. To turn angles, a theodolite was used. To find their location, they used astronomical observations, and to find elevation, levels and barometers were used. To see over long distances, towers were constructed from timber in flat and wooded areas.

== Meridians and baselines ==
The most important north–south lines of the survey are the meridians:
* The First (also Principal or Prime) Meridian at 97°27′28.41″ west, just west of Winnipeg, Manitoba. Its southern end is exactly ten miles west of where the Red River crosses the border from the United States into Canada.
* The Second Meridian at 102° west, which forms the northern part of the Manitoba–Saskatchewan boundary.
* The Third Meridian at 106° west, near Moose Jaw and Prince Albert, Saskatchewan.
* The Fourth Meridian at 110° west, which forms the Saskatchewan–Alberta boundary and bisects Lloydminster.
* The Fifth Meridian at 114° west, which runs through Calgary (Barlow Trail is built mostly on the meridian) and Stony Plain, Alberta (48th Street).
* The Sixth Meridian at 118° west, near Grande Prairie, Alberta, and Revelstoke, British Columbia.
* The Seventh Meridian at 122° west, between Hope and Vancouver, British Columbia (Lickman Rd, Chilliwack).
* The Coast Meridian at approximately 122°45′ west, originally established before British Columbia joined the Confederation, was surveyed north from the point where the 49th parallel intersects the sea at Semiahmoo Bay. 168th Street in Surrey is built mainly on the meridian.

The meridians were determined by painstaking survey observations and measurements, and in reference to other benchmarks on the continent, but were determined using 19th-century technology. The only truly accurate benchmarks at that time were near the prime meridian in Europe. Benchmarks in other parts of the world had to be calculated or estimated by the positions of the sun and stars. Consequently, although they were remarkably accurate for the time, today they are known to be several hundred metres in error. Before the survey was even completed it was established that for the purposes of laws based on the survey, the results of the physical survey would take precedence over the theoretically correct position of the meridians. This precludes, for example, any basis for a boundary dispute between Alberta and Saskatchewan on account of surveying errors.

The main east–west lines are the baselines. The First Baseline is at 49° north, which forms much of the Canada–United States border in the West. Each subsequent baseline is about to the north of the previous one, terminating at 60° north, which forms the boundary with Yukon, the Northwest Territories, and Nunavut.

== Townships ==

Starting at each intersection of a meridian and a baseline and working west (also working east of the First Meridian and the Coast Meridian), nearly square townships were surveyed, whose north–south and east–west sides are about in length. There are two tiers of townships to the north and two tiers to the south of each baseline.

Because the east and west edges of townships, called &quot;range lines&quot;, are meridians of longitude, they converge towards the North Pole. Therefore, the north edge of every township is slightly shorter than the south. Only along the baselines do townships have their nominal width from east to west. The two townships to the north of a baseline gradually narrow as one moves north, and the two to the south gradually widen as one moves south. Halfway between two base lines, wider-than-nominal townships abut narrower-than-nominal townships. The east and west boundaries of these townships therefore do not align, and north–south roads that follow the survey system have to jog to the east or west. These east–west lines halfway between baselines are called &quot;correction lines&quot;.

Townships are designated by their &quot;township number&quot; and &quot;range number&quot;. Township 1 is the first north of the First Baseline, and the numbers increase to the north. Range numbers recommence with Range 1 at each meridian and increase to the west (also east of First Meridian and Coast Meridian). On maps, township numbers are marked in Arabic numerals, but range numbers are often marked in Roman numerals; however, in other contexts Arabic numerals are used for both. Individual townships are designated such as &quot;Township 52, Range 25 west of the Fourth Meridian,&quot; abbreviated &quot;52-25-W4.&quot; In Manitoba, the First Meridian is the only one used, so the abbreviations are even more terse, e.g., &quot;3-1-W&quot; and &quot;24-2-E.&quot;. In Manitoba legislation, the abbreviations WPM and EPM are used: &quot;3-1 WPM&quot; and &quot;2N4-2 EPM&quot;.

== Sections ==

Every township is divided into 36 &quot;sections&quot;, each about square. Sections are numbered within townships in a boustrophedon pattern, beginning with the southeast section (in contrast to the US which starts from the northeast), as follows (north at top):
In turn, each section is divided into four &quot;quarter sections&quot; (square land parcels roughly on a side): southeast, southwest, northwest and northeast. This quarter-section description is primarily used by the agricultural industry. The full legal description of a particular quarter section is &quot;the Northeast Quarter of Section 20, Township 52, Range 25 west of the Fourth Meridian&quot;, abbreviated &quot;NE-20-52-25-W4.&quot;

A section may also be split into as many as 16 &quot;legal subdivisions&quot; (LSDs). LSDs are commonly used by the oil and gas industry as a precise way of locating wells, pipelines, and facilities. LSDs can be &quot;quarter-quarter sections&quot; (square land parcels roughly on a side, comprising roughly in area)—but this is not necessary. Many are other fractions of a section (a half-quarter section—roughly in area is common). LSDs may be square, rectangular, and occasionally even triangular. LSDs are numbered as follows (north at top):
Occasionally, resource companies assign further divisions within LSDs such as &quot;A, B, C, D, etc.&quot; for example, to distinguish between multiple sites within an LSD. These in no way constitute an official change to the Dominion Land Survey system, but nonetheless often appear as part of the legal description.

In summary, the hierarchy of the division of Western Canada went as follows:

* Province
** Township (composed of 36 sections)
*** Sections (composed of 4 quarter sections or 16 legal subdivisions)
**** Quarter sections
***: or
**** Legal subdivisions

== Road allowances ==

Between certain sections of a township run &quot;road allowances&quot; (but not all road allowances have an actual road built on them). The road allowances add to the size of the township (they do not cut down the size of the sections): this is the reason base lines are not exactly apart. In townships surveyed from 1871 to 1880 (most of southern Manitoba, part of southeastern Saskatchewan and a small region near Prince Albert, Saskatchewan), there are road allowances of surrounding every section. In townships surveyed from 1881 to the present, road allowances are reduced both in width and in number. They are wide and run north–south between all sections; however, there are only three east–west road allowances in each township, on the north side of sections 7 to 12, 19 to 24 and 31 to 36. This results in a north–south road allowance every mile going west, and an east–west road allowance every two miles going north. This arrangement reduced land allocation for roads, but still provides road-access to every quarter-section. Road allowances are one of the differences between the Canadian DLS and the American Public Land Survey System, which leaves no extra space for roads.

==Special sections==

===Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company===

As part of the deal that transferred Rupert&#x27;s Land from the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company to Canada, the HBC retained five per cent of the &quot;fertile belt&quot; (south of the North Saskatchewan and Winnipeg rivers). Therefore, Section 8 and three-quarters of Section 26 were assigned to the company. Additionally, the fourth quarter of Section 26 in townships whose numbers were divisible by five also belonged to the HBC in order to give the company exactly five per cent. Although the HBC sold all these sections long ago, they are still often locally called &quot;the &quot;Bay section&quot;&quot; today.

===Railroads===

Resulting in a &quot;checkerboard pattern&quot;, odd-numbered sections (except 11 and 29) were often used for railway land-grants. The Prairies could not be settled without railways, so the Dominion government habitually granted large tracts of land to railway companies as an incentive to build lines. Notably, the Canadian Pacific Railway was granted for the construction of its first line from Ontario to the Pacific. These sections are colloquially called &quot;CPR sections&quot; regardless of the railway they were originally granted to.

===Education===

Sections 11 and 29 were &quot;school sections&quot;. When school boards were formed, they gained title to these sections, which were then sold to fund the initial construction of schools. The rural school buildings were as often as not located on school sections; frequently, land trades were made between landowners and the school for practical reasons.

===Homesteads===

The remaining quarter sections were available as &quot;homesteads&quot; under the provisions of the &quot;Dominion Lands Act&quot;, the federal government&#x27;s plan for settling the North-West. A homesteader paid a fee for a quarter section of his choice. If after three years he had cultivated and had built a house (often just a sod house), he gained title to the quarter. Homesteads were available as late as the 1950s, but the bulk of the settlement of the Prairies was 1885 to 1914.

Legal surveys conducted before and after the Dominion Land Survey grid was laid out often have their own legal descriptions and delineations. Early settlement lots still retain their own original legal descriptions, but often have townships superimposed over them for the sake of convenience or for certain tasks. Urban developments superimpose new survey lots and plans over the older section and township grid also.

== Political disputes over the survey ==
Certain areas otherwise within the surveys&#x27; boundaries were not part of the survey grid, or not available for homesteading. These were Indian reserves, pre-existing &quot;settlements&quot; divided into &quot;river lots&quot; based on the French system used in Quebec, and lands around Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company trading posts reserved for the company when it transferred its claim over the West to Canada in 1870.

The rights of the pre-DLS settlers was a major political issue in the West in the late nineteenth century. The settlers claimed squatters&#x27; rights over the land they had already farmed, but the sizes and boundaries of these farms were poorly defined, leading to frequent disputes. As well the Métis in the Southbranch settlements of Saskatchewan were particularly concerned with their land rights given that they had not been well protected by the &quot;Manitoba Act&quot; as they had been promised in 1870. In the case of the closely clustered settlements of Edmonton, St. Albert, and Fort Saskatchewan in the Alberta District, a militant &quot;settlers&#x27; rights&quot; movement developed which demanded action from the federal government to grant the settlers legal title to their land and to end . The movement even resorted to vigilante action against suspected claim jumpers. Most of these grievances were resolved by 1885, which is likely one of the reasons the area never joined the North-West Rebellion despite the fact that St. Albert, and to a lesser extent Edmonton, were largely populated by Métis people.

<text>The Communist Party of Austria (, KPÖ) is a communist party in Austria. Established in 1918 as the Communist Party of German-Austria (KPDÖ), it is one of the world&#x27;s oldest communist parties. The KPÖ was banned between 1933 and 1945 under both the Austrofascist regime and the Nazi German administration of Austria after the 1938 &quot;Anschluss&quot;.

The party currently holds two seats in the Styrian and four seats in the Salzburg (state parliament), but has not had representation in the National Council (, Austria&#x27;s federal parliament) since 1959. In the legislative election held on 29 September 2019, it won only 0.7% of the votes (32,736 out of a total of 4,835,469), well below the 4% minimum to obtain seats in the National Council. The party&#x27;s vote share increased markedly to 2.4% in 2024, although still falling below the threshold. At the local level, the KPÖ has held the mayorship of Graz, Austria&#x27;s second largest city, since 2021, and holds over 130 seats on district and municipal councils across the country.

It is part of the New European Left Forum (NELF) and the Party of the European Left.

== History ==

=== Background and establishment ===
The KPÖ was officially established on 3 November 1918. Due to the Allies&#x27; sea blockade during the First World War, there was a supply shortage in Austria, resulting in workers protests. Such actions included strikes such as the 1918 &quot;&quot;. In 1917, concurrent with the Russian October Revolution, the left wing of the workers&#x27; movement established the KPÖ. Ruth Fischer, Karl Steinhardt, Franz Koritschoner, and Lucien Laurat were among the co-founders.

Attempts to establish a (council republic) in Austria resulted in developments different from those in Germany or Russia, as the were only able to establish themselves in isolated, high-population density areas such as Vienna and the industrial areas of Upper Austria. However, a &quot;Red Guard&quot; (&quot;Rote Garde&quot;) was formed and soon integrated with the (People&#x27;s Resistance Army). On 12 November 1918, the party attempted a coup d&#x27;état, which was not professionally organised. Within hours, the attempt at revolution was defeated.

=== First Republic, Second World War, and resistance to Nazism ===
During the First Republic, the KPÖ had little influence and failed to gain a single mandate in parliament, in part because of the ability of the Social Democratic Party (SPÖ) to unite the workers as an opposition movement. The party was also seriously weakened by internal factional struggles. In parallel with the ascent of Joseph Stalin to General Secretary in the Soviet Union in the early 1920s, the KPÖ was also refashioned in accordance with the principles of democratic centralism, and party discipline was more strictly enforced. Due to these reforms, the party was able to overcome its factional struggles by the late-1920s.

In 1933 the KPÖ was banned by an emergency decree of the Austrofascist government of Engelbert Dollfuss but continued to operate underground. According to internal sources, the KPÖ had been prepared for this situation since the mid-1920s. After the Social Democratic Party was also banned, many former SPÖ supporters and functionaries, such as Ernst Fischer and Christian Broda, worked underground in cooperation with the KPÖ.

The KPÖ took part in the failed workers rebellion on 12 February 1934, which was sparked by the militia (). It marked a last attempt to save Austrian democracy from fascism, but was ill-fated.

The KPÖ held a line which was often in disagreement with the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, such as disagreeing with Stalin&#x27;s branding of social democracy as a form of &quot;social fascism&quot; in the late 1920s. The Austrian communists dissent was avant-garde, with their refusal to condemn Social Democracy reflecting aspects of the 7th World Congress of the Comintern in 1935. The Austrian communists&#x27; tolerant stance opened their party to an influx of more disappointed Social Democrats. After the crushing of the February 1934 uprising by the federal army and the &quot;Heimwehr&quot;, the KPÖ grew rapidly from 4,000 to 16,000 members.

The KPÖ also took an independent stance from the mainstream in its views about nationhood and an Austrian identity separate from Germany, with leading communist intellectual Alfred Klahr writing that the view that the Austrian people were a part of Germany was theoretically unfounded. In contrast, many Austrian Social Democrats regarded the affiliation to the German nation as natural and even desirable. Echoing the thoughts of Klahr, the KPÖ expressed its firm belief in an independent Austria when the country was annexed to Nazi Germany in March 1938. In their historic call (), the party denounced Adolf Hitler&#x27;s dictatorship and called on all people to fight together for an independent Austria.

As a result of the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact of 1939, a number of Austrian communists-in-exile, such as KPÖ founder member Franz Koritschoner, were deported from the Soviet Union and handed over to the Nazis. After war broke out between Germany and the Soviet Union, the Soviets quickly reverted their stance and tried to support the Austrian Communists against Nazi Germany.

During Nazi rule, the KPÖ played an important role in the Austrian resistance, fighting side by side with former political enemies such as Christian socialists, Catholics, Monarchists, and farmers against Hitler&#x27;s regime. The KPÖ took seriously the order of the Allied Powers in the Moscow Declaration from October 1943, which called for Austria&#x27;s &quot;own contribution&quot; to its liberation from fascism as a precondition for the resurrection of their own state. More than 4,000 communists were imprisoned or sent to concentration camps and more than 2,000 lost their lives during the resistance, including 13 members of the KPÖ&#x27;s central committee. There was also an Austrian communist resistance network in Belgium, the ().

There is some disagreement amongst historians if the KPÖ fought the Nazis out of patriotism, or followed the pattern of the ideological fight of communism against fascism in general. Internal party documents show the truth as somewhere in the middle; the KPÖ wanted their country free from German occupation as much as they wanted it to become communist.
=== Second Republic ===
After Austria regained its independence from Germany, the KPÖ reached national importance, as it was, for the most part, able to count on the support of the occupying Soviet authorities. In the first provisional government under Karl Renner, the KPÖ was represented by seven members, along with ten socialists, and nine Christian socialists. Party chairman Johann Koplenig became vice-chancellor, while fellow communists Franz Honner and Ernst Fischer were made ministers responsible for home affairs and education respectively. However, Renner outflanked the Communists by having two powerful undersecretaries in each ministry, to which were appointed anticommunists. During the years of national reconstruction, the KPÖ vehemently criticised the &quot;capitalistic reconstruction at the expense of the working class&quot; and totally rejected the Marshall Plan.

The KPÖ assured the Soviets that they could win as much as 30% of the vote in the first National Council elections in 1945. However, the KPÖ won only 5.4% of the votes (174,257 votes) and was thus represented with only 4 members (out of 165) in the Austrian parliament. Nevertheless, chancellor Leopold Figl (of the right-wing ÖVP) offered the party a ministerial position in the government, and communist Karl Altmann was made Minister for Energy. With the beginning of the Cold War, and the continuing arguments over the Marshall Plan, Altmann resigned from his office in 1947 and the KPÖ became an opposition party.

=== General strikes of 1950 ===

Post-war, the national economy was in ruins, and the ÖVP-led government instituted a severe austerity programme. The planned measures (, ) included substantial price increases but minor wage increases, and large-scale strike movements formed in protest from 26 September to 6 October 1950. This, the largest strike action in the post-war history of Austria, started in the Steyr and Voest factories and the nitrogen plants in the American zone of occupation, and by 10:00 a.m. the number of strikers reached 15,000. Over 120,000 workers participated in the first day of the strike. However, the interruption of the strike to legitimize it with a conference of all Austrian work councils took the momentum out of the movement and in the second phase the concentration of strikes shifted to the Soviet zone of occupation.

In the morning of Wednesday 27 September, thousands of pro-communist strike workers took control over ÖGB regional headquarters in Linz and Graz with their communication infrastructure. Again, the police stayed aside but the Socialists in Vienna scrambled all their resources to weaken the communist influence. By the end of the day police and paramilitary units forced the Communists out of ÖGB buildings in British and American zones. On 28 September, the communists raised seventy volunteers to storm the national ÖGB office in Vienna, and were routed by the police. By 7 p.m. on 27 September, even the Soviets agreed that the strike failed and their radio program instructed Austrian workers to return to work. The ÖGB rejected the strike. The KPÖ took a prominent role in this strike, leading politicians of the incumbent grand coalition to fear a coup d&#x27;état, with the goal of the installation of a people&#x27;s republic. The KPÖ denied these allegations.

A second series of strikes began the following week, in Vienna and Lower Austria, and involved approximately 19% of industrial workforce. The strikers made the impact worse by disrupting railroad traffic. They stormed the Stadlau station in Donaustadt three times, were forced away three times, and then blocked the tracks until the evening. On 5 October, they resumed the blockade of Stadlau from 5 a.m., took control of the Nordbahnhof and threatened the Südbahnhof. With the police disabled, railroads were defended by their employees and the volunteers of the &quot;Olah battalion&quot;. They were armed with clubs, operated in small teams, and engaged the Communists in hand-to-hand fighting at first opportunity. There were reports that the Soviets provided trucks to move communist crews around, but this was as far as the Soviets went in supporting the strike.

On 5 October, the chairman of the Building and Wood workers Trade Union, Franz Olah, succeeded in negotiating the dissolution of the October strikes. Olah organised workers who supported the SPÖ into clashes with the communists, where they were able to outnumber and defeat them. This caused great friction between the KPÖ and many SPÖ members. The fact that the Soviet Red Army did not interfere also brought the strikes to an end.

=== Weaknesses and crises ===
During the 10-year allied occupation from 1945 to 1955, the threat of national division similar to that which befell post-war Germany loomed large. The Iron Curtain was dividing the European continent into two halves. During this period, the KPÖ was in constant contact with the Soviet authorities and Moscow. Following the party&#x27;s poor results in the parliamentary elections on 25 November 1945 (St. Catherine&#x27;s Day, therefore the elections became known as the ), the KPÖ representative in Moscow, Friedrich Hexmann, had to present a report to the Politburo with proposals on how to improve the situation for the party. The problem with the strategy of the communists was identified as being their goal to build a future coalition () with the SPÖ. This required a right-wing shift to the extent that ideological differences between the KPÖ and the SPÖ were not readily apparent.

The closeness of the KPÖ to Moscow also made many voters wary of the party and its aims. In the former territories of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, multiparty democratic systems were slowly but surely being penetrated and undermined by local pro-Soviet communist parties with covert or even overt support of the Soviets, as was observable in Czechoslovakia, Hungary, and Poland. As the Iron Curtain was being drawn closed, Austrians feared the same fate as their neighbours.

Talks between party leader Johann Koplenig and Stalin ( Codename: Gen. ) resulted in proposals of a possible division of Austria between East and West, similar to Germany. Since the KPÖ was constantly losing votes in parliamentary elections, a division and establishment of a communist-led East Austria would have been a practical way to consolidate at least a part of their dwindling power. The Soviet authorities in Moscow showed little interest for such a division for various reasons, namely because the size of a newly established East Austria would have been quite small and may not have been capable of existing without significant Soviet assistance. Already, the situation in the Soviet sector of Austria was difficult as the Soviets confiscated all industries, factories, and goods and transported anything of economic value back to the Soviet Union as part of war-reparations. Strategically, a division of Austria would have ultimately meant that a West Austria, closely linked to NATO, would have provided a connection between West Germany and Italy. A united, neutral Austria however could act as a barrier, together with Switzerland, thereby securing a part of the Central European front for the Soviets. The proposals by the Austrian communists were therefore brushed aside.

Moscow wanted a guarantee of neutrality as a pre-condition for the release of Austria into independence; the country would not be allowed to join either side of the Iron Curtain. As negotiations were underway, the KPÖ changed its tactics. The KPÖ swerved to Moscow&#x27;s stance and supported the idea of neutrality during the negotiations of the Austrian State Treaty. Many members of other parties, such as Leopold Figl, did not want neutrality, but a firm anchoring with the West and NATO. However, the Soviets were able to push this demand through. The Austrian State Treaty was voted upon on 15 May 1955, with the declaration of neutrality proclaimed on 26 October 1955. This was decided in the National Council with the votes of the ÖVP, SPÖ, and the KPÖ; the Federation of Independents (VdU, the forerunner of the FPÖ) voted against neutrality.

Because of the economic recovery and the end of the occupation in 1955, the protective power of the Soviet occupiers was lost to the KPÖ. The party lost a main pillar of support and was shaken by internal crisis. Like many other communist parties around the world, the KPÖ had oriented itself towards Marxism-Leninism of the Stalinist brand, and has closely allied itself at this point with the line of the Soviet Communist Party. The party&#x27;s failure to condemn the bloody suppression of the 1956 Hungarian uprising led to a wave of withdrawals from the party. On 10 May 1959, the KPÖ lost representation in the National Council, receiving 142,578 votes, 3.3% of the total tally and thus missing the 4% election threshold to receive seats.

The invasion of Czechoslovakia by Soviet troops in 1968 during the Prague Spring was at first condemned by the KPÖ. However, in 1971, the party revised its position and swung back to the Soviet line. A critic of these developments, the former KPÖ Minister of Education, Ernst Fischer (who branded it &quot;tank communism&quot;), was expelled from the party, and readmitted only in 1998.

Due to a continuing fall in support in the late 1970s and early 1980s, the party flirted briefly with a rightward move towards eurocommunism and democratic socialism. This, in turn, provoked the protest of the party&#x27;s core supporters, who saw little difference to social democracy, and feared a weakening of the communist cause. Following the reforms, more than one third of the party&#x27;s members left. The leadership of the KPÖ eventually backtracked from these changes, and the party restored the connections to the CPSU.

Having previously had 150,000 members directly following World War II, the party&#x27;s ranks shrank to approximately 35,000 in the 1960s and to a few thousands in the 1970s. As of 2005, membership stands at about 3,500 members.

The KPÖ was represented in the National Council from 1945 until 1959, in the state assemblies (&quot;Landtage&quot;) (with some interruptions) of Salzburg until 1949, in Lower Austria until 1954, in the Burgenland until 1956, in Vienna until 1969 and in Carinthia as well as Styria until 1970. In Upper Austria, the Tyrol and Vorarlberg the KPÖ never held state representation.

=== After the fall of the Socialist Bloc ===
With the fall of communism in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union, the KPÖ saw itself confronted with new challenges regarding its philosophy and future. The experiment with a moderate form of eurocommunism was not well received with its core supporters; however, moderate voters could not be persuaded either. The KPÖ faced difficult times during a period where communist parties throughout the world were receding.

In January 1990 two new leaders, Walter Silbermayr and Susanne Sohn, were appointed to renew the party and uncover errors and mistakes which were made in the past. The attempts by Sohn and Silbermayr to create a leftist alliance (&quot;Wahlbündnis&quot;) for the 1990 National Council elections failed. The party lost about a third of its members during the process. In March 1991, only three months later, both chairpersons resigned, with their course of renewal being insufficiently supported internally by party-members.

The party has consistently been critical of the NATO and the European Union, comparing Austria&#x27;s accession to the EU in 1995 to the by Nazi-Germany. The party campaigned against the European Constitution in its planned form; however, it does not regard leaving the European Union as an immediate priority, but as a long-term goal.

Until 2003, there was an official celebration on the in the Vienna Prater park, normally held each year in the first weekend of September. The celebration was named , after the party&#x27;s former newspaper. Due to financial reasons, the festival was unable to take place in 2004. It has, however, since staged a comeback, being held again in September 2005 and all years since. Today, the KPÖ sees itself as part of the anti-globalisation movement as well as a feminist party. It ran together with LINKE Liste, during the European elections 2004 as part of the Party of the European Left.

==== Financial situation ====
After the collapse of the German Democratic Republic in 1989, there were long court-proceedings for many years concerning the considerable net assets of the company &quot;Novum&quot;. Although the company was an East German one, it was used to siphon money and finance the KPÖ, see also Rudolfine Steindling for further details. The company used to be able to make large amounts of money through GDR foreign trade and the protection of the East German Socialist Unity Party (SED), with the profits used almost exclusively to support the KPÖ. As the successor state, the Federal Republic of Germany laid claim to all the finances of Novum, which was hotly contested by the KPÖ. The German courts decided in 2002, that the former SED-company belonged to the state-assets of the GDR, hence to its successor state the unified Germany. Therefore, these net assets of the KPÖ were confiscated.

Due to the court decision over the Novum holding, the party lost over 250 million euros of its financial assets. The party saw no alternative but to fire all its employees and stop the production of its weekly newspaper (&quot;Voice of the people&quot;, later restarted as .) The continuing existence of the party depends largely on volunteer work of dedicated communists and sympathisers.

Because of the financial problems, the party had to sell the so-called Ernst-Kirchweger-Haus (EKH), which was occupied by the so-called (autonomous) activists since 1990. The sale led to substantial criticism from leftists within and outside Austria, being condemned as &quot;capitalistic&quot;. Critics accused the KPÖ of not having exhausted all possibilities to avoid the sale. The accusation that the private buyer was a right-wing extremist could, however, not be substantiated.

In January 2005 there were several acts of vandalism against cars and private dwellings of KPÖ functionaries as well as the house of the KPÖ chairman. According to media reports the perpetrators outed themselves through the graffiti as EKH sympathisers. The KPÖ defended itself by arguing it had no possible financial means to keep the house. Previously in 2003 the party tried to convince the city of Vienna to buy the building to save it from privatisation; however, city authorities did not respond.

==== Internal party conflict ====
Beginning in 1994 a conflict between the party leadership revolving around chairman Walter Baier and different internal oppositional groups, who had gathered themselves mainly around the newspaper nVs (&quot;neue Volksstimme&quot;, ) and the internet platform Kominform. Internal party critics accused Walter Baier of revisionism and betrayal of Marxism; he in turn accused them of Stalinist tendencies.

This conflict escalated in 2004, when at a party convention it was decided to enter the Party of the European Left. In the elections to the European Parliament the KPÖ ran in a largely self-financed alliance (&quot;&quot;) with Leo Gabriel as the leading candidate. In an interview with the magazine profil, he spoke out against socialism, saying &quot;I want a Europe of solidarity, not a socialist Europe&quot;, which sparked furious criticism from the internal party opposition. A further point of contention for the opposition was that the party, in the course of its entry to the European Left Party, had to drop its previous demand of an Austrian withdrawal from the European Union. Many party organisations therefore boycotted the election campaign. The election result of 0.77% (20,497 votes) was disappointing and meant a drop of 1,466 votes compared to the election results of 1999.

The pressure on the party leadership to convene a party congress rose and as a consequence the leadership, which consisted of Walter Baier and two further members, called up the 33rd Party Congress of the KPÖ for the 11 December and 12 December 2004, as a delegation party congress in Linz-Ebelsberg. With this summoning the leadership ignored a resolution of the 32nd Party Congress (which was held as an &quot;all-members&quot; party congress, not by delegates), which stated that the following 33rd Party Congress would again be held as an &quot;all-member&quot; party congress, somewhere outside Vienna. Since the Party Congress is, according to party statute, the highest committee of the KPÖ, the opposition saw a breach of the statute and called upon the arbitration commission of the party, which is the internal authority in such cases. The arbitration commission decided, however, that no formal breach of the statute was recognisable since, according to statute, the Party Congress cannot decide on the form of a future convening party congress. Some members of the KPÖ branch in Ottakring (Ottakring is a traditional low income worker&#x27;s district in Vienna) tried to convene an all-members party congress of their own, justifying their actions on the statute of the party. This attempt was called off quickly due to threats of legal action from Baier. The delegates Party Congress convened and took place on 4 December and 5 December 2004, with 76 delegates meeting in Ebelsberg. The Party Congress was boycotted by the internal party opposition as well as the KPÖ regional branch in Tyrol, Graz, and Styria. The agenda of the 33rd Party Congress were the rejection of the European constitution and the European Union services guideline, the defence of public property from privatisation, as well as how to celebrate the Austrian jubilee year 2005 (60 years since the end of World War II, 50 years of independence as the Second Republic, 10 years as a member of the European Union).

Walter Baier was re-elected without opposition with 89.4% of the votes. Among other things, the party statute was also changed. Because of the internal conflict, several members of the opposition were expelled from the party. Some critics accused the leadership of undemocratic procedures, and withdrew from the party voluntarily. The relationship to the Communist Youth of Austria - Young Left (KJÖ) was also tense, because of attempts made by the leadership to develop a new youth organisation.

In March 2006 Walter Baier resigned from the presidency of the party for personal and political reasons. He was replaced by Mirko Messner, a Carinthian Slovene and longtime party-activist, and Melina Klaus later that month.

=== Revival and reentrance to Styrian Landtag ===

In the 21st century, the party has seen a revival, particularly in the state of Styria. In the election to the Styrian &quot;Landtag&quot; (state parliament) on 2 October 2005 the KPÖ, with leading candidate Ernest Kaltenegger, were able to win 4 seats (6.34% of the votes.) This was their first return in the Styrian Landtag (or any state parliament) since 1970. The party retained representation in this body since then. In the Styrian capital, Graz, the KPÖ developed into a successful local party (20.75% in the 2005 local council elections). This success was largely attributed to the leadership of popular town councillor Ernest Kaltenegger who raised the profile of housing as a political issue.

The party secured a seat on the city council in 1988, campaigning against rising rents, and the local party established practical support and advice services to assist tenants in dealing with landlords, inspired by a French Communist Party initiative. During the 1990s the KPÖ successfully campaigned for the passage of bill restricting rents in public housing to no more than a third of the tenant&#x27;s income. At the following election in 1998 the party won four seats on the council and secured a seat on the city senate (the council&#x27;s executive), which was taken by Kaltenegger, who was appointed to the city housing department: among other measures he was able to ensure that each public housing unit had its own toilet and bathroom. The KPÖ&#x27;s vote in the next elections in 2003 increased to almost 20 percent. The following year it managed to block an initiative by the other parties on the council to privatise the city&#x27;s housing stock by collecting over 10,000 signatures to trigger a referendum, in which 96 percent of voters opposed privatisation. Traditionally at the end of the year the leaders of the Graz KPÖ reveal their accounts. KPÖ councillors are required to earn the average industrial wage and donate the rest to social programmes in accordance with the basic rules of the KPÖ. The party retained this stronghold in 2012 and in 2017. In the 2021 elections the KPÖ emerged as the party with the most seats on the council, with 29 percent of the vote, and the party&#x27;s Elke Kahr was subsequently elected mayor at the head of a coalition of the Communists, the Social Democrats and the Greens.
In the 2023 Salzburg state election, the KPÖ won 11.7% of the vote (an increase of 11.3% from the previous election in 2018) and four seats. This was the first time the party won seats to the Salzburg Landtag since 1945.

In the 2024 European Parliament election, the KPÖ more than tripled its result of 2019, gaining 104,245 votes (3,0%). 

Despite some polls showing the KPÖ above the electoral threshold for a short period in 2023, the party ended up winning 2.4% of the vote in the 2024 Austrian legislative election, and failed to win any seats. This was still a notable improvement from the previous election and the party&#x27;s best result since 1962. 

== Organization ==

=== Press ===
The party published a newspaper called () between 1945 and 1991 and again since a few years. It also published a theoretical monthly journal called () until 2000.

Another publication which was published by the party was a Czech language newspaper based in Vienna, (&#x27;Pioneer of Freedom&#x27;). It appeared weekly between 1918 and 1926, and bi-weekly 1926–1929.

=== Salary cap ===
Since 1998, elected officials have observed a salary cap set at the wages of a skilled worker. Pay above this amount is donated to people in need. The rationale is to ensure politicians remain attuned to the financial needs of their constituents.

== Popular support ==
The party&#x27;s strongest branch is in Styria, which until the 2023 Salzburg state election was the only state where the party was represented, and their strongest state in national elections. Within Styria, the KPÖ is particularly strong in Graz, the Styrian capital and the second largest city in Austria, where the KPÖ outpolls the SPÖ and Grüne (20.75% in the 2005 local council elections). The party retained this stronghold in 2012. The KPÖ also retains support in their historical industrial strongholds in Vienna, Lower Austria, and Upper Austria.

The KPÖ is strong with younger voters, doubling up their vote share to 1.47% in the 2005 Vienna state election after the voting age was lowered to 16. For the first time since 1991 the KPÖ had seats in the districts. On 23 October 2005, one mandate each was won in the districts of Leopoldstadt and Landstraße, although not in the state &quot;Landtag&quot;. In the remaining 21 districts mandates were narrowly missed.

<text>The Communist Party of Bangladesh (, abbreviated: CPB) is a Marxist–Leninist communist party in Bangladesh.

== History ==
After the partitioning of India in 1947, during the 2nd Congress of the Communist Party of India in Calcutta, the delegates coming from regions within the newly founded state of Pakistan (which included what now constitutes Bangladesh) met on March 6, 1948 in a separate session and decided to form the Communist Party of Pakistan. Nepal Nag became the General Secretary of the party.

The main strength and activity of the newly constituted Party was in the province of East Pakistan (now Bangladesh). This eastern province was geographically separated from the western province by almost 2,000 km of Indian territory. Because of this wide geographical separation along with persecution by Pakistan government and uneven development of democratic movement in the two parts of Pakistan, the communists of East Pakistan felt the need to have an independent centre for further advancing their activities. The 4th Conference of the East Pakistan Provincial Committee of the Party, which met clandestinely in 1968, declared itself to be the 1st Congress of the Communist Party of East Pakistan and elected a Central Committee for the Party. With the emergence of Bangladesh as an independent state in 1971, this Party took its present name of Communist Party of Bangladesh.

The Party played a vital role in the 1969 uprising and also during the nationwide upheaval that followed it including the non co-operation movement of 1971. The CPB also actively participated in the nine months long armed struggle for independence of Bangladesh in 1971. A ‘Special Guerilla Force’ under the direct command of CPB—NAP—BSU fought against the Pakistan army. Communists also took part in the other segments of the armed resistance fighters including the Mukti Bahini and the new Bangladesh Army. Moni Singh, the ex-President of CPB, was elected a member of the Advisory Council of the Provisional Government of Bangladesh.

===independent Bangladesh===
The independence of Bangladesh in 1971 opened up a new chapter in the history of the Communist Party of Bangladesh. The Party began to work legally and openly. The Party formed a Trade Union Centre with a view to mobilizing trade union organizations and movements on revolutionary lines. A Gana Oikya Jote (&quot;Translation:&quot; &#x27;People&#x27;s Unity Alliance&#x27;; &quot;Bengali:&quot; &#x27;গণ ঐক্য জোট&#x27;) was formed on 14 October 1973 consisting of the Bangladesh Awami League, Communist Party and National Awami Party (Muzaffar) with a view to prepare ground for establishing socialism in the country, and a Jote Committee was constituted consisting of 19 members with three members from CPB. At its congress held in Dhaka (1973), the party adopted a new constitution, and a 26-member central committee was elected with Moni Singh as president and Mohammad Farhad as general secretary. On August 15 1975, President Sheikh Mujib was assassinated by a section of the army which ultimately brought the country under a rightist military rule. The CPB leaders and workers were victims to serious repression under the military government in 1975. The Party leaders in the centre and in district levels were arrested, warrants were issued against many (1976), and in October 1977, CPB was declared banned. In 1978 the ban on the party was however withdrawn and its leaders were released. The CPB participated in the general elections of 1978. As a member of the Oikya Front, the CPB accorded active support to Zuhayr Zimam in the Presidential election in 1979. The CPB joined the 15-party alliance in 1983 against the military rule of Hussain Muhammad Ershad. The party participated in the 1986 Jatiya Sangsad elections and secured five seats. The CPB had a vital role in the movement to oust Ershad in 1990.

The CPB faced a great crisis in 1991 in view of the collapse of Soviet-style socialism in Eastern Europe, including the Soviet Union. The party leaders were divided into two camps, one in favour of dissolving the CPB and replacing it with a new platform on democratic lines, and the other in favour of maintaining the party in its original form. This conflict grew to be acute in 1993 when the two opposing groups arranged separate conventions in Dhaka. The Marxist–Leninist group, in their convention held on 15 June 1993, resolved in favour of the independent existence of the Communist Party in Bangladesh, and had their new central executive committee formed with Comrade Shahidulla Chowdhury as president and Comrade Muzahidul Islam Selim as general secretary.

An WPB faction merged with CPB in February 2010.

== Ideology and organization ==
Revolutionary internationalism is a cardinal aspect of its policy principles. Democratic centralism is the guiding organizational principle of CPB. The Party Congress, which is convened every 4 years, is the supreme body of the Party which elects a Central Committee accountable to it. The Central Committee is the highest organ of the Party during the interval between two Congresses.

A 51-member Central Committee was elected by the 9th Congress of the Party (August 2008). A 7-member Presidium including the President and General Secretary were elected by the CC. There is also a national council of 191 members which sits at least once a year to advise and help the CC in implementing the decisions of the Congress. The Congress also elected a 4-member Control Commission.
The CPB has organizations in 62 out of the 64 districts and 275 out of 520 sub-districts in Bangladesh. The district and sub-district committees coordinate and guide the activities of the zonal committees and the primary branches of the Party. Party members are organized in these primary branches, The branches on their part organise ‘activist groups’ which serve to prepare cadres for party membership. Besides party membership, the Party also provides opportunity to include ‘associate members’ from among supporters of the Party. Party members and activists are working in trade unions and mass organizations of agricultural workers, peasants, women, students, youth, children, teachers, doctors, lawyers, professionals, indigenous national minorities and aboriginal, cultural organizations etc. In spite of relatively small number of party members and associate members (taken together they total 25,000), the party is capable of mobilizing several hundreds of thousands of people through its influence in these mass organizations.

The main organ of the party is Ekota (&quot;Translation&quot;: &#x27;Unity&#x27;; &quot;Bengali:&quot; &#x27;একতা&#x27;)

== Strategy and tactics ==
The CPB is working with a strategy of bringing about a &#x27;revolutionary democratic transformation of society and state&#x27; with the ultimate goal of Socialism-Communism. The Party has put forward a 17-point program in consonance with this strategic goal of &#x27;revolutionary democratic transformation&#x27;.

CPB is giving special attention to strengthen the Party and the mass organizations, increase cohesion among the communists and move towards communist unity, strengthen and expand the Left Democratic Front.

CPB has also been working to bring together left-wing forces to provide an alternative to the current two major parties. CPB took active part in setting up an 11-party combination has been set up with this purpose. However, in recent developments the rest of this alliance has aligned within the 14-party alliance led by the Awami League.

<doc id="357581" wikidata="Q233669" url="?curid=357581" title="Lou Henry Hoover">
<text>Lou Henry Hoover (March 29, 1874 – January 7, 1944) was an American philanthropist, geologist, and the first lady of the United States from 1929 to 1933 as the wife of President Herbert Hoover. She was active in community organizations and volunteer groups throughout her life, including the Girl Scouts of the USA, which she led from 1922 to 1925 and from 1935 to 1937. Throughout her life, Hoover supported women&#x27;s rights and women&#x27;s independence. She was a polyglot, fluent in Mandarin and well-versed in Latin, and was the primary translator from Latin to English of the complex 16th-century metallurgy text &quot;De re metallica&quot;.

Hoover was raised in California while it was part of the American frontier. She attended Stanford University, and became the first woman to receive a degree in geology from the institution. She met fellow geology student Herbert Hoover at Stanford, and they married in 1899. The Hoovers first resided in China; the Boxer Rebellion broke out later that year, and they were at the Battle of Tientsin. In 1901 they moved to London, where Hoover raised their two sons and became a popular hostess between their international travels. During World War I, the Hoovers led humanitarian efforts to assist war refugees. The family moved to Washington, D.C. in 1917, when Herbert was appointed head of the Food and Drug Administration, and Lou became a food conservation activist in support of his work.

Hoover became the First Lady of the United States when her husband was inaugurated as president in 1929. Her invitation of Jessie De Priest to the White House for tea was controversial for its implied support of racial integration and civil rights. She refused to give interviews to reporters, but she became the first first lady to give regular radio broadcasts. Hoover was responsible for refurbishing the White House during her tenure, and saw to the construction of a presidential retreat at Rapidan Camp. She minimized her public role as White House hostess, dedicating her time as first lady to her volunteer work.

Hoover&#x27;s reputation declined alongside her husband&#x27;s during the Great Depression as she was portrayed as uncaring of the struggles faced by Americans. Both the public and those close to her were unaware of her extensive charitable work to support the poor while serving as first lady, as she believed that publicizing generosity was improper. After Herbert lost his reelection campaign in 1932, the Hoovers returned to California, and they moved to New York City in 1940. Hoover was bitter about her husband&#x27;s loss, blaming dishonest reporting and underhanded campaigning tactics, and she strongly opposed the Roosevelt administration. She worked to provide humanitarian support with her husband during World War II until her sudden death of a heart attack in 1944.

==Early life and education==

Lou Henry was born in Waterloo, Iowa, on March 29, 1874. Her mother was Florence Ida (née Weed), a former schoolteacher, and her father was Charles Delano Henry, a banker. She was the older of two daughters, raised in Waterloo before moving to Texas, Kansas, and California. Most of her childhood was spent in the California towns of Whittier and Monterey. While she was a child, her father educated her in outdoorsmanship, and she learned to camp and ride. She took up sports, including baseball, basketball, and archery. Her parents taught her other practical skills, such as bookkeeping and sewing. Her family was nominally Episcopalian, but Lou sometimes attended Quaker services.

As a child, Henry attended Bailey Street School in Whittier until 1890. She was well-liked in school, known for the science and literature clubs she organized and for her tendency to ignore gender norms by engaging in athletics and outdoor activities. When she was ten, she was the editor of her school newspaper. She began her postsecondary schooling at the Los Angeles Normal School (now the University of California, Los Angeles). While in Los Angeles, she was a member of the school&#x27;s Dickens Club that studied and collected specimens of plants and animals. She later transferred to San José Normal School (now San José State University), obtaining a teaching credential in 1893. She took a serious interest in politics during her college years; she joined the Republican Party based on its progressive platform, and she strongly supported women&#x27;s suffrage.

After her graduation in 1893, Henry took a job at her father&#x27;s bank as well as working as a substitute teacher. The following year, she attended a lecture by geologist John Casper Branner. Fascinated by the subject, she enrolled in Branner&#x27;s program at Stanford University to pursue a degree in geology. It was there that Branner introduced her to her future husband, Herbert Hoover, who was then a senior. They bonded over their shared Iowa heritage and their common interests in science and outdoorsmanship, and their friendship developed into a courtship. She studied geology with the intention of doing field work, but she and Branner were unable to find any employers willing to accept a female geologist. She maintained her interest in sports while at Stanford, serving as president of the Stanford Women&#x27;s Athletic Club in her final year. In 1898, Hoover became the first woman to receive a bachelor&#x27;s degree in geology from Stanford, and she was one of the first women in the United States to hold such a degree. She continued to work with Branner, conducting research on his behalf and requesting geological samples for Stanford&#x27;s collection. Branner credited her with making it one of the largest collections in the world. After graduating, Henry volunteered with the Red Cross to support American soldiers during the Spanish–American War.

==Marriage and travels==

=== Marriage and travel to China ===
In 1897, Herbert was offered an engineering job in Australia. Before leaving, he had dinner with the Henrys and their engagement was informally agreed upon. Lou and Herbert maintained a long-distance relationship while he was in Australia. Herbert was hired as chief engineer of the Chinese Engineering and Mining Company the following year, and he sent her a marriage proposal by cable, reading &quot;Going to China via San Francisco. Will you go with me?&quot;. They were married in the Henrys&#x27; home on February 10, 1899. Lou also announced her intention to change her religious faith from Episcopalian to her husband&#x27;s Quaker religion, but there was no Quaker Meeting in Monterey. Instead, they were married in a civil ceremony performed by a Spanish Roman Catholic priest.

The day after their marriage, Lou Hoover and her husband boarded a ship from San Francisco, and they briefly honeymooned at the Royal Hawaiian Hotel in Honolulu. While on route, they read extensively about China and its history. They arrived in Shanghai on March 8, spending four days in the Astor House Hotel. Hoover stayed with a missionary couple in the foreign colony in Tientsin (now Tianjin) while her husband was working, and they moved into a home of their own the following September. It was their first home as a married couple, a Western-style brick house at the edge of the colony. It was here that Hoover began homemaking and interior decoration; she managed a staff and entertained for guests. She also took up typing while in China, purchasing a typewriter and writing scientific articles on Chinese mining with her husband. Hoover worked closely with her husband, through both writing and field work. She also started a collection of Chinese porcelain that she would maintain throughout her life.

The Boxer Rebellion began while the Hoovers were in China; despite her husband&#x27;s pleas, Lou refused to leave the country. As foreigners, they were both potential targets of the Boxer movement. During the Battle of Tientsin in 1900, Lou worked as a nurse and managed food supplies while Herbert organized barricades. For a month, Hoover carried a revolver while she ran supplies to soldiers on her bicycle. In one incident, a bullet struck her tire while she was riding. In another, shells struck around her home, but once it was clear the shelling was over, she calmly returned to her game of solitaire. At least one obituary was mistakenly published for her. The Hoovers left China after the end of the Boxer Rebellion that summer, traveling to London to make arrangements regarding control of Chinese mines. They returned to China once more with Lou&#x27;s sister Jean for several months in 1901.

=== London and World War I ===
The Hoovers made their home in London in November 1901 after Herbert was offered a partnership with a British mining company. Their work took them throughout Europe and to many other countries, including Australia, Burma, Ceylon, Egypt, India, Japan, New Zealand, and Russia. Because of their travels, Hoover spent much of her time on steamboats. The trips were relatively comfortable, as they traveled in first class. She passed time on these months-long voyages by reading or by hosting social visits with other travelers using portable tea sets and tables. The Hoovers had two sons who accompanied them as they traveled: Herbert Hoover Jr. was born in 1903, and Allan Hoover was born in 1907.

The Hoovers became extremely wealthy after Herbert&#x27;s decision to become an independent consultant in 1908. Lou&#x27;s expertise in geology allowed her to participate in business talk with Herbert and his colleagues, and she thoroughly enjoyed this. The Hoovers played a role in standardizing the modern mining industry, particularly in regard to human management and business ethics. When they were in London, Lou often entertained large crowds. Their home became a social hub for their fellow expatriates and for Herbert&#x27;s colleagues in the mining industry. The Hoovers engaged in philanthropy during their time in London, and Lou saw to it that her servants had their needs addressed. She joined the Friends of the Poor to work directly with people in poverty, and she joined social clubs such as the Society of American Women, the British affiliate of the General Federation of Women&#x27;s Clubs; she participated in and eventually led the society&#x27;s philanthropic committee.

When World War I began, the Hoovers had already spent time back in the United States and were preparing to move back permanently. Upon hearing that war had broken out, the Hoovers instead became involved with London relief efforts. When Herbert was chosen to direct relief efforts for Belgian refugees, Lou became heavily involved as well. She also reorganized the Society of American Women as a humanitarian group to facilitate the transport of Americans stranded in Britain. She traveled regularly to the United States and back to give speeches and collect donations for relief efforts, despite the danger of crossing the North Atlantic during the war. Her involvement with refugee assistance earned her a position on the American relief committee as the only female member, and she was the chairwoman of the women&#x27;s American relief committee. Other projects of hers included the creation of a Red Cross hospital for British soldiers, a knitting factory in London to provide jobs for displaced women, and a maternity hospital in Belgium. As her humanitarian efforts increased, she found herself responsible for so many projects that she had to delegate several of them to other women. For her work, she was decorated in 1919 by King Albert I of Belgium.

The Hoovers returned to the United States in January 1917. When the U.S. entered World War I three months later, Herbert was appointed head of the Food and Drug Administration, and the Hoovers made their home in Washington, D.C. As with Herbert&#x27;s previous endeavors, Lou worked closely alongside him. She joined her husband in promoting food conservation, traveling to give speeches promoting the cause. The Hoovers effectively became the public faces of the conservation movement. She also organized the construction of a home for her and her husband by Stanford University in Palo Alto, California, but this was seen as selfish by the public amid her humanitarian work, and she delayed the project until the end of the war. The war brought thousands of women to Washington to work as civil servants. The poor economic security of these women led Hoover to found women&#x27;s groups and provide housing for the women that worked in her husband&#x27;s department. She expanded her support for these women&#x27;s groups to include medical treatment during the Spanish flu. Hoover paid for these programs with her own funds, describing them as loans but asking that they be repaid to someone that needed it more. After the war, Hoover continued her fundraising work in the U.S. while her husband was in Europe administrating relief efforts.

The Hoovers returned to Washington when Herbert was appointed Secretary of Commerce in 1921. Drawing from her experience as a hostess, Hoover made their new Washington home into a social hub, allowing her husband to build relationships in the city. She found the practice of calling on her fellow cabinet wives to be a waste of time, and her refusal to do so contributed to the end of the practice. As the wife of a cabinet member, Hoover sought involvement in many women&#x27;s organizations, including the Girl Scouts of the USA, the Camp Fire Girls, the General Federation of Women&#x27;s Clubs, and the League of Women Voters. By the time Hoover was a cabinet wife, she emphasized a distinction between her work and her husband&#x27;s, refusing to answer reporters&#x27; questions about her husband&#x27;s work in Washington. When Calvin Coolidge ascended to the presidency, Hoover became close friends with the new first lady, Grace Coolidge. The two of them began a tradition of exchanging flowers on Easter, and Hoover invited Coolidge to participate in Girl Scouts events.

Hoover had begun her involvement with the Girl Scouts in 1917, wishing to continue her work with children that she had begun in her war relief efforts. She was chosen as the group&#x27;s president in 1922, and she held the position until 1925. She emphasized a &quot;lead from behind&quot; structure for Girl Scout troops in which she recommended that troop leaders &quot;don&#x27;t forget joy&quot;. Hoover&#x27;s reforms, as well as her own personal popularity, led to a significant increase in membership and funds for the organization. She convinced first lady Edith Wilson to accept a position as honorary head of the Girl Scouts, establishing a tradition that Hoover herself would eventually take on as first lady. For girls living in rural areas, she founded the Lone Scout program so they could participate without a troop in their area. She also founded racially integrated Girl Scout troops in Washington and Palo Alto.

Hoover was also heavily involved with the National Amateur Athletic Foundation, and she was the only woman to serve as vice president within the organization. She first began working with the group in 1922, and she played an active role until her husband&#x27;s election as president in 1928. With this position, she created a Women&#x27;s Division that outlasted the original organization. The women&#x27;s division was created with the goal of moving women&#x27;s sports away from the practices of men&#x27;s sports, which they argued were too competitive and failed to prioritize the well-being of the athletes. Hoover believed that sports were essential for one&#x27;s health and she wished to see all young girls participate in a sport. As with her participation in the Girl Scouts, she used her skill for fundraising to greatly expand the organization&#x27;s resources.

When Herbert was considered as a candidate for the 1928 presidential election, Lou did not approve of active campaigning, and Herbert often refrained from political talk when she was present. Though she accompanied her husband on his campaign, she refused to comment on the election or say anything that might be considered political. The 1928 election brought more attention to the candidates&#x27; wives than those of previous years. When her husband was chosen as the Republican Party&#x27;s nominee, she found herself frequently compared to Catherine Smith, the wife of Democratic nominee Al Smith. Hoover was relatively popular compared to Mrs. Smith, who was an urbanite, a Catholic, and an alleged alcoholic—all things that made her unpopular with voters. Hoover was seen as better fit for the role, being athletic and well-traveled. After Herbert was elected president, Lou accompanied him on a goodwill tour of Latin America.

==First Lady of the United States==
=== White House hostess ===
Hoover was not as successful in her role as White House hostess as she was in other projects; she was not eager to participate in Washington society except on her own terms, and her social position became increasingly precarious as the Hoovers&#x27; reputation diminished during the Great Depression. She did not prioritize public presentations as first lady, and when she took up the role, she declined to purchase new clothes or learn any new skills as incoming first ladies often did. She was often reclusive, ending the practice of greeting thousands of people during the New Year&#x27;s Day reception because she deemed it unpleasant. Her husband later said that it was only her &quot;rigid sense of duty&quot; that prevented her from abolishing other receptions as well. She made sure to accommodate pregnant women, rejecting the social expectation of the time that pregnancy not be visible in public.

Hoover was more willing to invite individual guests to the White House, and such guests were present at every meal. Some days included additional teas to accommodate the constant flow of guests to the White House. On several occasions, White House staff found that due to last-minute invitations, they had to prepare and serve meals for several times as many people as originally expected. Unlike previous first ladies, Hoover emphasized political advantage when selecting guests, setting a precedent for future first ladies. At the beginning of her tenure, Hoover spent large sums of money to ensure that the White House had &quot;the best of everything&quot;, using all of the funds allocated by Congress and then supplementing it with the family&#x27;s personal funds. She expressed her love of music by inviting several renowned musicians to the White House, and she introduced the tradition of inviting a guest musician to play for visiting foreign leaders after she had her friend Mildred Dilling play for the King of Siam. The Great Depression brought an end to the White House&#x27;s more extravagant social events as Hoover reduced her spending to serve as an example for the American people.

When African American candidate Oscar Stanton De Priest was elected to Congress, Hoover initiated a meeting for tea at the White House with his wife Jessie De Priest, as was tradition for the wives of all incoming Congressmen. Hoover was responsible for planning the event to ensure its success. She arranged the scheduling so that only women she trusted would attend, and she alerted White House security that Mrs. De Priest was to be expected and not barred entry. Hoover chose not to publicize the details of De Priest&#x27;s attendance until after it occurred so as to avoid interruptions. The event became part of a larger debate on racial issues as Southern voters protested the invitation of a Black woman. It further complicated Hoover&#x27;s relationship with the press, as she deemed Southern newspapers to be responsible for the criticism. The Hoovers reinforced the precedent by inviting other non-white musicians to play at the White House, including the Tuskegee Institute Choir.

=== Management of the White House ===

During her time as first lady, Hoover oversaw refurbishing of the White House, importing art and furniture to decorate the building. She worked in conjunction with a committee that had been formed in the previous administration to decorate the White House, though she sometimes declined to consult them and made her own changes. She hired her own assistant at personal expense to catalogue what already existed in the White House, creating the first full compilation for the history of the White House&#x27;s furnishings. Her refurbishments included the reconstruction of the studies of Abraham Lincoln and James Monroe, which would later be converted into the Lincoln Bedroom and the Treaty Room, respectively. She also had a movie projector installed in the White House. Hoover&#x27;s many projects meant that she frequently held meetings of her own in the White House, and she had bedrooms converted into sitting rooms so she and the president could both see several people each day.

Hoover played a critical role in designing and overseeing the construction of a rustic presidential retreat at Rapidan Camp in Madison County, Virginia. After the location was chosen, the Hoovers discovered the poverty in the area and added the construction of a school building to their project. Once Rapidan Camp was established as a second presidential home, the Hoovers stayed there each weekend. Hoover often practiced horseback riding while at the camp, where she often outpaced the military horsemen that accompanied her. The Hoovers undertook another philanthropic construction project in 1930 to build a Quaker Meeting House in Washington D.C.

The Hoovers&#x27; relationship with their staff is the subject of debate. Memoirs of staff members have portrayed them in a negative light, but it is unclear how much of this depiction originates from the books&#x27; ghostwriters. Hoover required the staff to remain out of sight, and a bell would be rung before she or her husband entered a room, signaling for the staff to leave the area. While managing White House events, she would use hand signals to communicate with the staff. Many innocuous gestures, such as raising a finger or dropping a handkerchief, indicated a command for them to follow. Even slight deviations from expected behavior, such as scraping plates or breaking composure when standing during mealtimes, risked a rebuke. Though she was strict, she also treated the staff generously, frequently paying for their food and other personal expenses. Besides the White House staff, Hoover had her own personal first lady staff. She had four women working directly for her, more than any previous first lady.

=== Politics and activism ===

Hoover was her husband&#x27;s frequent adviser while he was president. Throughout her tenure, she refused to give interviews to the press, seeing them as intrusive and error-prone. Instead, she spoke to the public by giving speeches over the radio, and she was the first woman to make radio broadcasts as first lady. She took pride in her broadcasts, rehearsing them in a dedicated room and practicing her speaking technique. These broadcasts often used plain language and advocated feminist ideals. Hoover continued her involvement with volunteer and activist work, though much of it was reduced or ignored in favor of her responsibilities as first lady. She remained directly active with the Girl Scouts, continuing her oversight of its organizational and financial operations, and she touted it as an example of the volunteerism she felt was necessary to combat the Great Depression. Hoover also became a patron of the arts as first lady, particularly in her support of aspiring musicians. Using her influence as first lady, Hoover encouraged her husband to hire more women in his administration, and she expressed support for an executive order to ban sex discrimination in civil service appointments. She generally avoided any strong political statements or affiliations that might have interfered with her husband&#x27;s administration.

During the Great Depression, Hoover regularly received requests for assistance from citizens who were struggling. She referred each one to a local charity organization or a person who could help so that each would get the needed assistance. Whenever she was unable to find a charity or a donor that could help, she sent her own money. She refused to publicize or draw attention to her charitable work, consistent with her lifelong belief that private generosity should not be promotional. Often she sent the money anonymously through a proxy so her name would not be associated with it. She also became responsible for the financial situation of her and her husband&#x27;s relatives and family friends. Serving as a point of contact between her husband and those suffering poverty, she presented an image of empathy to contrast with the president&#x27;s perceived aloofness. Hoover also helped organize fundraiser concerts for the American Red Cross with pianist Ignacy Jan Paderewski. She was deeply affected by the criticisms leveled against her husband during the Great Depression, furious that a man whom she saw as caring and charitable was being criticized as the opposite. In support of her husband&#x27;s stance on the economy, her radio broadcasts during the Great Depression focused on volunteerism, emphasizing women&#x27;s role in volunteer work. She accompanied her husband on a presidential campaign again in 1932, but he was defeated in the 1932 presidential election.

==Later life and death==
After leaving the White House, the Hoovers took their first true vacation in many years, driving through the Western United States. Hoover continued to receive letters requesting assistance, though far fewer than she had addressed while serving as first lady. She did not share her husband&#x27;s desire to return to politics, but she was active in Republican Party women&#x27;s groups. In 1935, she took up a project to purchase and restore her husband&#x27;s birthplace cottage in Iowa. She also returned to the Girl Scouts the same year to serve as its president for another year. Hoover became involved with the Salvation Army to support its fundraising operations in 1937. The same year, she returned to Stanford University to develop the Friends of Music program, with which she was active for the rest of her life. She also supported a physical therapy program that she hoped would prove beneficial should the United States go to war. She maintained an active lifestyle throughout her later years, including a weeks-long horseback tour of the Cascade Range while she was in her sixties.

Hoover disapproved of the actions of the Roosevelt administration, and she became affiliated with the Pro-America movement that opposed the New Deal. At the onset of World War II, she once again worked to provide relief for war refugees with her husband, reminiscent of their work in World War I. She was enraged by the Japanese invasion of China, a place with which she always felt a personal connection. Despite this, she took an isolationist stance, hoping that the U.S. would not enter the second World War as it had entered the first. During the 1940 presidential election, the Hoovers campaigned on behalf of Republican candidate Wendell Willkie. They moved to New York in December 1940, as Herbert had been spending an increasing amount of time there on business.

Hoover died of a heart attack on January 7, 1944, while staying at the Waldorf Astoria New York. She was found by her husband when he returned to their room. Two services were held for her. The first, a joint Episcopalian-Quaker service in New York, was attended by about one thousand people, including two hundred girl scouts. The second was held in Palo Alto, where she was buried. After her death, her family found many checks she had received to repay her for her charity but which she had declined to cash. She was later reinterred in her husband&#x27;s grave in West Branch, Iowa.

== Political beliefs ==

During her early life and career, Hoover was not politically vocal. She preferred to speak to nonpartisan issues, and she wished to avoid saying anything that might have political ramifications for her husband. To present a unified stance with her husband, she rarely expressed political ideas of her own except on women&#x27;s issues. Hoover supported civil rights and deplored racism, though she was susceptible to the racial stereotyping that was common at the time, and she was unaware of problems faced by the African American community. One of the few issues on which she disagreed with her husband was her support for the prohibition of alcohol. She disposed of her husband&#x27;s wine collection, and she refused to attend any event that served alcohol illegally.

Throughout her life, Hoover worked to support women&#x27;s causes. She was an advocate of women&#x27;s employment, encouraging housewives to start careers as well as keeping house. Her support for women&#x27;s causes came about early in life, and she wrote school essays on the subject. She was a member of several women&#x27;s groups, many of which engaged in philanthropic efforts to support women. When the Nineteenth Amendment guaranteed women&#x27;s suffrage in the United States in 1920, Hoover said that women&#x27;s responsibilities extended to civic duty. She chastised women who lived purely domestic lives as &quot;lazy&quot;, arguing that household chores did not preclude a career. She was also critical of politically active women who focused exclusively on women&#x27;s and children&#x27;s rights issues, believing that women should participate in governance more broadly.

Hoover was a strong believer in philanthropy and business ethics, supporting her husband&#x27;s decision to reimburse his employees at personal expense after a fellow partner defrauded them. She also ensured that the culprit&#x27;s family was cared for financially after he fled the country. She believed that private charity was preferable to public assistance programs. Hoover was not vocal about her beliefs on philanthropy, believing that it was something that should be practiced privately. She opposed publicized philanthropy, and she gave funds to the needy throughout her life without telling others. The full extent of her philanthropy was not known until records were discovered after her death. She held a similar philosophy regarding religion, believing that practice was more important than sectarian identification.

While her husband was the head of the Food and Drug Administration, Hoover took up the cause of food conservation. She began a tradition of leaving one chair empty as a reminder of child starvation whenever she entertained company. In 1918, she invited reporters into her home for a special &quot;Dining with the Hoovers&quot; interview in which she detailed their household&#x27;s dining habits and conservation strategies. The practice of self-imposed dietary restrictions to conserve, such as going one day a week without meat, became known as &quot;Hoovering&quot;. She provided lessons and recipes for Americans that wished to grow or prepare their own food.

Amid the corruption of the Teapot Dome scandal, Hoover took an active stance in favor of government accountability. The scandal led her to call for more women in law enforcement, and she headed the Women&#x27;s Conference on Law Enforcement in 1924. As first lady, Hoover provided indirect support to disabled veterans of the Bonus Army, though she believed that the able-bodied veterans had no claim to the additional support they were requesting. She was highly sensitive to political criticism as first lady, and she was strongly affected by remarks against her husband&#x27;s presidency. Hoover became more conservative after her tenure as first lady, and she was critical of the Roosevelt administration. Hoover had a low opinion of the Roosevelts, believing that they caused her husband to be politically smeared and cost him a second term in the White House. She also felt that many of President Roosevelt&#x27;s actions were unconstitutional. Later in life, she made political statements deploring the spread of communism and fascism.

== Languages ==
Hoover spoke five languages by the time she became first lady. She began her study of Mandarin Chinese while on the ship to China after her marriage. She took up instruction under a Chinese Christian scholar, eventually surpassing him in the Chinese vocabulary. She sometimes served as her husband&#x27;s translator while they lived in China, and she would continue to practice Chinese with him afterward so that he would retain the little that he knew. When she wished to speak privately with her husband in the White House, Hoover would engage with him in Mandarin. Her Chinese name was &#x27;Hoo Loo&#x27; (古鹿; Pinyin: Gǔ Lù【胡潞，Hú Lù】), derived from the sound of her name in English.

Hoover was also well versed in Latin, which she studied while at Stanford. She collaborated with her husband in translating Georgius Agricola&#x27;s &quot;De re metallica&quot;, a 16th-century encyclopedia of mining and metallurgy. Lou was responsible for the translation from the Latin, while Herbert applied his knowledge of the subject matter and carried out physical experiments based on what they discerned from the text. The book had previously been considered unusable due to the difficulty of translating its technical language, some of which had been invented by its author. After its translation, the Hoovers published it at their own expense and donated copies to students and experts of mining. In recognition of their work, they received the gold medal of the Mining and Metallurgical Society of America in 1914. They dedicated the book to Dr. Branner, the instructor who had introduced Lou to geology and to Herbert.

==Legacy==

During her tenure as first lady, Hoover was variously seen as a homemaker, as was common for first ladies, and as an activist. Her reputation, along with that of her husband, languished as the Hoover administration was criticized for its response to the Great Depression. Hoover is often seen as a counterbalance to her husband as she took up the social responsibilities of their work in and out of the White House, her charisma and tact balancing his reputation of being shy and sometimes arrogant. She has since been consistently ranked in the upper half of first ladies in periodic polling of historians.

Hoover set an early precedent for the political role of first ladies in the 20th century by expressing an interest in women&#x27;s issues and supporting her husband&#x27;s platform with her own projects. Despite their political differences, Hoover has been compared to her successor Eleanor Roosevelt in their common approaches to political engagement and women&#x27;s issues. Hoover&#x27;s use of radio broadcasts proved similar to her successor&#x27;s own use of media over the following years.

The first biography about Hoover was &quot;Lou Henry Hoover: Gallant First Lady,&quot; written by her friend Helen B. Pryor in 1969. Her husband requested that her papers remained sealed for twenty years after his own death, preventing any significant scholarly analysis of her life or her role as first lady until then. They were opened in 1985, allowing for increased scholarship on her life and her work. Her papers are relatively comprehensive for historical figures of the period, including over 220,000 items and encompassing every period of her life. Historical study of Hoover has been complicated by her private nature, as she would often refuse media attention and burn personal letters.

The Stanford home that Hoover designed was donated to the university by her husband, who requested that it be named the Lou Henry Hoover House. Two elementary schools were named in her honor: Lou Henry Hoover Elementary School of Whittier, California, in 1938 and Lou Henry Elementary School of Waterloo, Iowa, in 2005. Lou Henry Hoover Memorial Hall was built in 1948 at Whittier College. One of the brick dormitories at San Jose State University was named &quot;Hoover Hall&quot; in her honor until its demolition in 2016. Camp Lou Henry Hoover in Middleville, New Jersey, is named for her.

In May 2017, the Lou Henry Hoover Sculpture Park was dedicated in Waterloo, Iowa on the site of her torn down birthplace home. There are two statues of her in the Sculpture Park, one of her as a child &amp; young lady and one of her as First Lady.

<text>Euteleostomi (&quot;Eu-teleostomi&quot;, where &quot;Eu-&quot; comes from Greek εὖ &#x27;well, good&#x27; or Euteleostomes, also known as &quot;bony vertebrates&quot;) is a successful clade that includes more than 90% of the living species of vertebrates. Both its major subgroups are successful today: Actinopterygii includes most extant bony fish species, and Sarcopterygii includes the tetrapods.

Euteleostomes originally all had an endochondral bone, fins with lepidotrichs (fin rays), jaws lined by maxillary, premaxillary, and dentary bones composed of dermal bone, and lungs. Many of these characters have since been lost by descendant groups, however, such as lepidotrichs lost in tetrapods, and bone lost among the chondrostean fishes. Lungs have been retained in dipnoi (lungfish), and many tetrapods (birds, mammals, reptiles, and some amphibians). In many ray-finned fishes, lungs have evolved into swim bladders for regulating buoyancy, while in others they continue to be used as respiratory gas bladders.

==Euteleostomi vs. Osteichthyes==
In ichthyology the difference between Euteleostomi and Osteichthyes is that the former presents a cladistic view, i.e. that the terrestrial tetrapods evolved from lobe-finned fish (Sarcopterygii). Until recently, the view of most ichthyologists has been that Osteichthyes were paraphyletic and include only bony fishes. However, since 2013 widely cited ichthyology papers have been published with phylogenetic trees that treat the Osteichthyes as a clade including tetrapods, making the terms Euteleostomi and Osteichthyes synonymous.

==Classification==
Euteleostomi (Osteichthyes) contains the following extinct (†) and extant taxa:

Actinopterygii
*Actinopteri
**Chondrostei
**Neopterygii
*Cladistia
**Polypteriformes

*Actinistia
**Coelacanthiformes
*†Onychodontida
*Dipnomorpha
**†Porolepimorpha
**Dipnoi
***Ceratodontimorpha
*†Rhizodontida
*†Osteolepidida
*†Elpistostegalia
*Tetrapoda

<text>The Workers&#x27; Communist Party of Bosnia and Herzegovina ( ) is a communist party from Bosnia and Herzegovina. It was formed in 2000 and strongly opposes the nationalism present in the region and the collapse of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.

Some of their major aims are the introduction of workers&#x27; self-management and participatory democracy, as well as the re-establishment of a socialist federal Yugoslavia. They say they are not motivated by nostalgia, as they are critical of Josip Broz Tito.

They believe that socialism has to be democratic and strongly oppose the system of the former Soviet Union and other former governments. They have been particularly influenced by Rosa Luxemburg and Antonio Gramsci.
