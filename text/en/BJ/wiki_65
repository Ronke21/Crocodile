<text>Charles Alexandre de Calonne (20 January 173430 October 1802), titled Count of Hannonville in 1759, was a French statesman, best known for being Louis XVI&#x27;s Controller-General of Finances (minister of finance) in the years leading up to the French Revolution.

Calonne attempted repeatedly to pass reforms that lowered government spending and implemented property added value tax among other things, but failed due to popular opposition to his policies from the Parlement and the Assembly of Notables. Realizing that the Parlement of Paris would never agree to reform, Calonne handpicked an Assembly of Notables in 1787 to approve new taxes. When they refused, Calonne&#x27;s reputation plummeted and he was forced to leave the country.

==Origins and rise to prominence==
Born in Douai of an upper-class family, he entered the legal profession and became a lawyer to the general council of Artois, procureur to the &quot;parlement&quot; of Douai, &quot;Master of Requests (France)&quot;, intendant of Metz (1768) and of Lille (1774). He seems to have been a man with notable business abilities and an entrepreneurial spirit, while generally unscrupulous in his political actions. In the terrible crisis preceding the French Revolution, when successive ministers tried in vain to replenish the exhausted royal treasury, Calonne was summoned as Controller-General of Finances, an office he assumed on 3 November 1783.

He owed the position to the Comte de Vergennes, who for over three years continued to support him. According to the Habsburg ambassador, Florimond Claude, Comte de Mercy-Argenteau, his public image was extremely poor. Calonne immediately set about remedying the fiscal crisis, and he found in Louis XVI enough support to create a vast and ambitious plan of revenue-raising and administrative centralization. Calonne focused on maintaining public confidence through building projects and spending, which was mainly designed to maintain the Crown&#x27;s capacity to borrow funds. He presented the king with his plan on 20 August 1786. At its heart was a new land value tax that would replace the old vingtième taxes and finally sweep away the fiscal exemptions of the privileged orders. The new tax would be administered by a system of provincial assemblies elected by the local property owners at parish, district and provincial levels. This central proposal was accompanied by other reforms meant to further rationalize the French economy, a package that included free trade in grain and abolition of France&#x27;s myriad internal customs barriers. It was in effect one of the most, if not &quot;the&quot; most, comprehensive attempts at enlightened reform during the reign of King Louis XVI.

==Measures==
After taking office, he discovered the nation had debts of 110 million livres (partly incurred by France&#x27;s involvement in the American Revolution) and no means of paying them. At first he tried to get credit and support the government with loans so as to maintain public confidence in its solvency. In October 1785 he reissued gold coinage and developed the Caisse d&#x27;Escompte (dealing in cash discounts). Knowing the Parlement of Paris would veto a single land tax that all landowners would have to pay, Calonne persuaded Louis XVI to call an assembly of notables to vote on his referendum. Calonne&#x27;s eventual reform package, which was introduced to the Assembly of Notables to impose them, consisted of five major points:

#Cut government spending
#Revive free trade methods
#Authorize the sale of Church property
#Equalize salt and tobacco taxes
#Establish a universal land value tax

All these measures failed because of the powerlessness of the crown to impose them.

As a last resort, Calonne proposed that the king abolish internal customs duties and implement a property tax on nobles and clergy. Anne Robert Jacques Turgot, Baron de Laune, a noted French economist and Jacques Necker, an eminent French banker and former Director-General of Finances, had tried and failed to get these reforms adopted. Calonne attributed their failure to the opposition of the &quot;parlements&quot;, so he called another &quot;Assemblée des notables&quot; in February 1787. After he made a presentation to the assembly on the French deficit and its causes and dangers as he saw them, Calonne proposed the establishment of a &quot;subvention territoriale&quot;, which would be levied on all property without distinction.

==Conflict with the Assembly of Notables of Versailles==

This suppression of privileges was badly received. Calonne&#x27;s spendthrift and authoritarian reputation was well known to the parlements, earning him their enmity. Knowing this, he intentionally submitted his reform programme directly to the king and the hand-picked assembly of notables, not to the sovereign courts or parlements, first. Composed of the old regime&#x27;s social and political elite, however, the assembly of notables balked at the deficit presented to them when they met at Versailles in February 1787, and despite Calonne&#x27;s plan for reform and his backing from the king, they suspected that the controller-general was in some way responsible for the enormous financial strains. Protests against Calonne erupted, supported by the middle and lower-middle classes, who burnt effigies of Calonne in support of the notable assembly&#x27;s resistance to tax. On September 14, 1788, after Guillaume-Chrétien de Lamoignon de Malesherbes retired, there were riots in Paris on Rue Mélée and the Rue de Grenelle, where more figures of Calonne were burned, along with those of Breteuil and the Duchess de Polignac.

Calonne, angered, printed his reports and so alienated the court. Louis XVI dismissed him on 8 April 1787 and exiled him to Lorraine. The joy was general in Paris, where Calonne, accused of wishing to raise taxes, was known as &quot;Monsieur Déficit&quot;.

==Dismissal and exile==

Calonne soon afterwards left for Great Britain, and during his residence there kept up a polemical correspondence with Necker. After being dismissed, Calonne stated, &quot;The King, who assured me a hundred times that he would support me with unshakable firmness, abandoned me, and I succumbed”. He was replaced by Loménie de Brienne, who similarly fared poorly in the political environment.

In 1789, when the Estates-General were about to assemble, he crossed to Flanders in the hope of offering himself for election, but he was forbidden to enter France. In revenge he joined the &quot;émigré&quot; group at Coblenz, wrote in their favour, and spent nearly all the fortune brought him by his wife, a wealthy widow. He was present with the Count of Artois, the reactionary brother of Louis XVI, at Pillnitz in August 1791 at the time of the issuance of the Declaration of Pillnitz, an attempt to intimidate the revolutionary government of France that the Count of Artois pressed for. In 1802, having again settled in London, he received permission from Napoleon Bonaparte to return to France. He died about a month after his arrival in his native country.

==Legacy==
Calonne&#x27;s negative reputation and assumed responsibility for France&#x27;s financial crisis in the years leading to the Revolution of 1789 have been judged unfair by historians such as Munro Price. During his position as controller-general, he had genuinely tried to make amends for his previous spendthrift policies. As a contemporary writer, Nicolas Chamfort, remarked, Calonne was &quot;applauded when he lit the fire, and condemned when he sounded the alarm.&quot; However, economic historians such as Eugene White have stressed the negative role played by Calonne, who continued the restoration of a venal system of financial administration.

His fall had important significance to the fate of the monarchy in France before 1789. The financial strains made apparent through Calonne&#x27;s attempts at reform revealed the instability of the monarchy as a whole, which up until then had been managed on the basis of traditional monarchical absolutism: secretly, hierarchically, without public scrutiny of accounts or consent to taxation. For centuries, the monarchy had controlled fiscal policy on its own terms, and when knowledge of an unmanageable and growing deficit became more widely known, the image was of a failed and, in many ways, corrupt institution. Louis XVI, who had backed Calonne&#x27;s reform programme wholeheartedly, saw its refusal by the notables and the parliament as a personal failure. Conscientious in his attempts to alleviate the suffering of the French people, the king, it is clear, genuinely hoped to implement an enlightened policy with the help of Calonne. Crushed by this opposition to Calonne&#x27;s project, the king withdrew to long hours of hunting and larger meals. Many historians see the ensuing months as the beginning of the king&#x27;s bouts of depression.

<text>André Dacier (; ; 6 April 165118 September 1722) was a French classical scholar and editor of texts. He began his career with an edition and commentary of Festus&#x27;s &quot;De verborum significatione&quot;, and was the first to produce a &quot;readable&quot; text of the 20-book work. His wife was the influential classical scholar and translator, Anne Dacier.

== Life and career ==
Dacier was born at Castres in upper Languedoc. His father, a Protestant lawyer, sent him first to the Academy of Puy Laurens, and afterwards to the Academy of Saumur to study under Tanneguy Le Fèvre here he converted to Catholicism and remained a devout Catholic for the rest of his life. On Lefebvre&#x27;s death in 1672, Dacier moved to Paris, and was appointed an editors of the Delphin Classics series. In 1683 he married Anne Lefèvre, the daughter of his old tutor. Better known by her married name of Madame Dacier, her work as a classicist has been acknowledged by encyclopedia editors to be far superior to his.

In 1695 he was elected to the Academy of Inscriptions, and also to the Académie française; not long after this, as payment for his share in the medallic history of the king&#x27;s reign, he was appointed keeper of the library of the Louvre. He died two years after his wife.

===Work===
The most important of Dacier&#x27;s works were his editions of Pompeius Festus and Verrius Flaccus, and his translations of Horace (with notes), Aristotle&#x27;s &quot;Poetics&quot;, the &quot;Electra&quot; and &quot;Oedipus the King&quot; of Sophocles; Epictetus, Hippocrates and Plutarch&#x27;s &quot;Lives&quot;.

Dacier and his wife Anne together translated &quot;Meditations&quot; by Marcus Aurelius into French in 1690–91, as well as writing an extensive commentary on the work.

In editing Festus, Dacier worked from the proposals of Joseph Scaliger, who provided notes and additions. His stated goal was to produce a &quot;clear and educationally useful text.&quot; Addressing his work to the Dauphin &quot;(in usum Delphini)&quot;, at that time Louis, he was more interested in the of Roman law, treaties, and the foundations of power than in the literary quality of the text or its lack thereof. Dacier&#x27;s work on Festus was first published in Paris, 1681, with subsequent editions in 1692, 1699, and 1700.

<doc id="367321" wikidata="Q3117951" url="?curid=367321" title="Elections in Finland">
<text>There are five types of elections in Finland: elections for the president, the parliament, county councils of the wellbeing services counties, municipal councils and the European Parliament. Normally, all Finnish citizens aged 18 or older are eligible to vote. Some non-citizens may also have the right to vote in municipal, county and European elections.

Finland holds a presidential election every six years to elect the President of Finland. The election uses a two-round system based on a direct popular vote. If no candidate receives more than 50% of the vote in the first round, a runoff is held between the two candidates with the highest number of votes. The same person can serve as president for no more than two consecutive terms.

Parliamentary elections are held every four years to elect members of the parliament. The elections use a system of proportional representation in multi-seat constituencies and allocate seats according to the D&#x27;Hondt method. Finland has a multi-party system making it uncommon for a single party to achieve a majority in parliament. As a result, Finnish governments are typically formed through coalition agreements involving multiple political parties.

County and municipal elections are held every four years at the same time to elect the councils of the 21 wellbeing services counties and 292 municipalities. In Åland, municipal elections are held separately, at the same time as the election of the Parliament of Åland.

European Parliament elections are held every five years. Finland is allocated 15 seats in the European Parliament.

==Presidential elections==
The president of Finland is elected by popular vote for a six-year term and can serve a maximum of two consecutive terms. Since 1988, the election has followed a two-round system. If a candidate receives more than 50% of the vote in the first round, they are elected president. If no candidate achieves a majority, the two candidates with the most votes proceed to a second round, where the candidate with more votes is elected president. The first round is usually held on the fourth Sunday of January in the election year, with the potential second round taking place two weeks later.

Political parties that won at least one seat in the previous parliamentary election are eligible to nominate a presidential candidate. Additionally, candidates can be nominated by constituency associations formed by at least 20,000 eligible voters. These associations must collect and submit the required number of signatures to register their candidate. In 2018, incumbent Sauli Niinistö became the first president elected as a candidate of a constituency association, having previously been elected as the candidate of the National Coalition Party. He also became the first president in Finland to win the election in the first round.

===2024 Presidential election===

An election was last held in 2024, with the first round on 28 January and second round on 11 February. Alexander Stubb won in the second round receiving 51.62% of the votes, facing against independent candidate Pekka Haavisto.

==Parliamentary elections==
Parliamentary elections in Finland take place every four years to elect the 200 members of the Parliament of Finland. Members are chosen from 13 electoral districts, with the number of seats allocated to each district based on population, ranging from 37 seats in Uusimaa to 1 seat in Åland. Elections are typically held on the third Sunday of April in the election year, unless Easter affects the schedule. Under Finland&#x27;s parliamentary system the prime minister can ask the president to dissolve parliament at any time during its 4-year term, which would result in early elections. The most recent dissolution of parliament took place in 1975.

The D&#x27;Hondt method of proportional representation, used in Finland, encourages a multitude of political parties and has resulted in many coalition cabinets. The system, which allocates seats based on party vote shares, tends to favor large, established political parties, although smaller parties also find representation due to the proportional system. In recent elections, around nine parties have won at least one seat in parliament. Unlike many countries, Finland does not impose a fixed nationwide electoral threshold. Instead, the effective threshold varies by district size, making it more challenging for smaller parties to secure seats in districts with fewer available seats.

=== 2023 parliamentary election ===

The National Coalition Party received 20.8% of the vote, securing 48 seats. The Finns Party followed closely with 20.1% of the vote and 46 seats, while the Social Democratic Party received 19.9% of the vote, winning 43 seats. All three parties saw an increase in their share of the vote compared to the previous election, whereas mid-sized and smaller parties saw an overall decline in support.

==Åland&#x27;s parliamentary elections==
Åland is a province that accounts for 0.5% of Finland&#x27;s population, a total population of 27,210. The Åland&#x27;s autonomous political status under the Act on Åland Autonomy gives the Parliament of Åland legislative powers over a number of areas. Aside from these issues, the state of Finland, represented by the Provincial Governor, is sovereign and residents vote in general parliamentary elections for one representative to the Finnish parliament.

Elections in Åland are held every four years at the same time as municipal elections are held in the Municipalities of Åland. A proportional representation system encourages a multitude of political parties and has resulted in many coalition cabinets. Åland has different political parties than continental Finland.

The Premier of the Government of Åland, Lantråd, is appointed by the speaker of the Parliament, based on the vote in the parliamentary elections. Usually the chairman of the biggest party becomes the next prime minister. In the parliamentary elections on 21 October 2007 there were two dominating parties: the Liberals for Åland got 10 seats, and the Åland Centre got 8 seats, in the 30-seat Lagting. These parties then formed a new cabinet led by Viveka Eriksson.

==Municipal elections==
Municipalities of Finland, that include cities and other (rural) municipalities, are the basic local administrative units of the country. Most of basic services are provided by the municipality, and are bound to do so by law. Municipalities have council-manager government, where the council (&quot;valtuusto&quot;) is the highest authority. Every four years, a council is elected.

Councils name a civil servant, the city manager or municipal manager, to conduct day-to-day administration of the municipality. In addition, councils name committees (&quot;lautakunta&quot;) and a municipal executive board (&quot;kunnanhallitus&quot;). Councils meet periodically and decide on major issues. The executive board prepares the bills and is responsible for the administration, finances and supervision of the interests of the municipality. Unlike in central government, executive boards usually consist of all parties represented in the council; there is no opposition.

===2017 municipal elections===

Although municipal elections are local only, and local results vary, they do function as a measure of the sentiments and party strengths also nationally. In the 2017 election, National Coalition was the most-voted party, with Social Democrats second and Center the third. Proportionally, the biggest winner was the Green League, whose share of votes rose to 12.5% from 8.5% in 2012 municipal elections. The biggest losers were the Finns Party, whose share of votes dropped to 8.8% from 12.3% in 2012.

===2021 municipal elections===
===2025 municipal elections===
==European parliament elections==
Finland has participated in European parliament elections since joining the European Union in 1995. The first Finnish election was held in 1996. Currently, Finland is allocated 15 seats in the European Parliament, with all seats elected from a single constituency that encompasses the entire country.

===2024 European elections===

== County elections ==
In Finland, the councils of the 21 wellbeing services counties are elected every four years in county elections. These counties are responsible for the organization of health, social and rescue services. The county councils hold the highest decision-making authority within their respective counties.

Each wellbeing services county forms a single multi-seat electoral district. While councils can determine the number of elected members, a minimum number of seats is required based on the county&#x27;s population. Smallest counties are required to have at least 59 councillors, while in the largest counties the minimum number of councillors is 89.

County elections exclude the region of Åland, where wellbeing services are managed by the parliament of Åland, and the city of Helsinki, where they are handled by the municipal council. The first county elections took place in 2022. Beginning in 2025, these elections will be held simultaneously with municipal elections.

==Referendums==
The Constitution of Finland allows only for a non-binding (consultative) referendum called on by the Parliament (Article 53 of the Constitution).

As of 2013 there have been only two referendums in Finland:
* Finnish prohibition referendum in 1931
* Finnish European Union membership referendum in 1994.
In both cases measures passed, and Parliament acted according to the results of the vote (although the referendum in Finland is non-binding).

Municipal law 30-31 § gives right to Referendum since year 1990. It had been used 56 times between 1990 and 2010. Citizens of Turku collected 15,000 names in one month for referendum against the underground car park. Politicians with in the elections unknown financing from the parking company neglected the citizens opinion. According to International Association of Public Transport UITP parking places are among the most effective ways to promote private car use in the city. Therefore, many European cities have cancelled the expensive underground car parking after the 1990s. The EU recommended actions cover develop guidance for concrete measures for the internalisation of external costs for car traffic also in urban areas. Parking control can only be successful if they are enforceable. In Finland the shops routinely offer free parking for customers which rises the prices of food for all customers, also for those who bicycle or walk.

There were also around 40 municipal referendums in Finland (as of 2006). Most have been about municipal mergers.

If fifty thousand Finnish citizens sign an initiative (for an act or a referendum), the Parliament has to discuss it, but the initiative is not binding, so the parliament does not have to initiate a referendum. This provision entered into force on 1 March 2013, and the first such initiative to reach Parliament was an initiative to ban fur farming, which was rejected by the Parliament. Several other initiatives reached the Parliament in 2013, including &quot;Common Sense in Copyright&quot; initiative, and a gay marriage initiative.

<text>Open Inventor, originally IRIS Inventor, is a C++ object-oriented retained mode 3D graphics toolkit designed by SGI to provide a higher layer of programming for OpenGL. Its main goals are better programmer convenience and efficiency. Open Inventor exists as both proprietary software and free and open-source software, subject to the requirements of the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL), version 2.1.

The primary objective was to make 3D programming accessible by introducing an object-oriented API, allowing developers to create complex scenes without the intricacies of low-level OpenGL. The toolkit incorporated features like scene graphs, pre-defined shapes, and automatic occlusion culling to streamline scene management. While Open Inventor focused on ease of use, the OpenGL Performer project, spawned from the same context, emphasized performance optimization. The two projects later converged in an attempt to strike a balance between accessibility and performance, culminating in initiatives like Cosmo 3D and OpenGL++. These projects underwent various stages of development and refinement, contributing to the evolution of 3D graphics programming paradigms.

==Early history==
Around 1988–1989, Wei Yen asked Rikk Carey to lead the IRIS Inventor project. Their goal was to create a toolkit that made developing 3D graphics applications easier to do. The strategy was based on the premise that people were not developing enough 3D applications with IRIS GL because it was too time-consuming to do so with the low-level interface provided by IRIS GL. If 3D programming were made easier, through the use of an object oriented API, then more people would create 3D applications and SGI would benefit. Therefore, the credo was always “ease of use” before “performance”, and soon the tagline “3D programming for humans” was being used widely.

==Use==
OpenGL (OGL) is a low level application programming interface that takes lists of simple polygons and renders them as quickly as possible. To do something more practical like “draw a house”, the programmer must break down the object into a series of simple OGL instructions and send them into the engine for rendering. One problem is that OGL performance is highly sensitive to the way these instructions are sent into the system, requiring the user to know which instructions to send and in which order, and forcing them to carefully cull the data to avoid sending in objects that aren&#x27;t even visible in the resulting image. For simple programs a tremendous amount of programming has to be done just to get started.

Open Inventor (OI) was written to address this issue, and provide a common base layer to start working with. Objects could be subclassed from a number of pre-rolled shapes like cubes and polygons, and then easily modified into new shapes. The “world” to be drawn was placed in a scene graph run by OI, with the system applying occlusion culling on objects in the graph automatically. OI also included a number of controller objects and systems for applying them to the scene, making common interaction tasks easier. Finally, OI also supplied a common file format for storing “worlds,” and the code to automatically save or load a world from these files. Basic 3D applications could then be written in a few hundred lines under OI, by tying together portions of the toolkit with “glue” code.

On the downside OI tended to be slower than hand-written code, as 3D tasks are notoriously difficult to make perform well without shuffling the data in the scene graph by hand. Another practical problem was that OI could only be used with its own file format, forcing developers to write converters to and from the internal system.

==Performer==
About a year into the Inventor project, a different philosophy began to emerge. Instead of simply making it easy to write applications on SGI systems, the goal was changed to make it difficult to write slow applications. Members of the Inventor team left to form their own group, which founded the basis of the OpenGL Performer project. Performer was also based on an internal scene graph, but was allowed to modify it for better speed as it saw fit, even dropping “less important” objects and polygons in order to maintain guaranteed performance levels. Performer also used a number of processes to run tasks in parallel for added performance, allowing it to be run (in one version) on multiple processors. Unlike Inventor, Performer remained proprietary so that SGI would have the agility to modify the API as needed to keep in step with the latest hardware enhancements.

==Mid 1990s==
At some point in the mid-1990s it was realized that there was no good reason that the two systems could not be combined, resulting in a single high-level API with both performance and programmability. SGI started work on yet another project aimed at merging the two, eventually culminating in Cosmo 3D. However Cosmo had a number of practical problems that could have been avoided with better design.

Eventually all of these ideas would come together to create the OpenGL++ effort, along with Intel, IBM and DEC. Essentially a cleaned up and more “open” version of Cosmo 3D, work on Cosmo ended and SGI turned to OpenGL++ full-time. The OpenGL++ effort would drag on and eventually be killed, and SGI then tried again with Microsoft with the similar Fahrenheit project, which also died. In 1994 SGI licensed Open Inventor to two third-party developers, Template Graphics Software (TGS) and Portable Graphics; in 1996 TGS bought Portable Graphics, making them the sole licensee.

==Recent history==

After many years of being solely available under proprietary licensing from TGS (now FEI), Inventor was released under the LGPL open source license in August 2000 and is available from SGI. Around the same time, the Coin3D API clone library was released by SIM (Systems in Motion). SIM was later acquired by the Kongsberg group and renamed Kongsberg SIM. The Coin library had been written in a clean-room fashion from scratch, sharing no code with the original SGI Inventor library but implementing the same API for compatibility reasons. Kongsberg ended development of Coin3D in 2011, and released the code under the BSD 3-clause license.

The open-source version from SGI is not maintained, and SGI has not indicated a commitment to further develop the library. The open-source release is used in MeVisLab (MeVis Medical Solutions AG and Fraunhofer MEVIS), however, and development of that continues. Thermo Scientific Open Inventor is still being developed, and has added a number of improvements to the original Inventor API for medical imaging, medical image computing, 3D reflection seismology, and petroleum reservoir modeling.

The Open Inventor API is still commonly used for a wide range of scientific and engineering visualization systems around the world for the development of complex 3D application software.
TGS was acquired by Mercury Computer Systems in 2004. It became an independent company, Visualization Sciences Group (VSG), in June 2009. In 2012, VSG was acquired by FEI Company. FEI Company was acquired in 2016 by the Thermo Fisher Scientific Materials &amp; Structural Analysis Division, which continues to develop (and support) Open Inventor.

Somewhat unusual in this era, he educated his daughter Anne Dacier in Greek and Latin, and she subsequently became the notable classical scholar and translator better known as Madame Dacier.

==Life and work==
Le Fèvre was born at Caen. After completing his studies in Paris, he was appointed by Cardinal Richelieu inspector of the printing-press at the Louvre. After Richelieu&#x27;s death, he left Paris, joined the Reformed Church, and in 1651 obtained a professorship at the Academy of Saumur, which he filled with great success for nearly twenty years. His increasing ill-health and a certain moral laxity (as shown in his judgment on Sappho) led to a quarrel with the consistory, as a result of which he resigned his professorship. Several universities were eager to obtain his services, and he had accepted a post offered him by the elector palatine at Heidelberg, when he died suddenly. One of his children, Anne, became the distinguished classical scholar and translator Madame Dacier.

Le Fèvre was a highly cultivated man and a thorough classical scholar. He brought out editions of various Greek and Latin authors: Longinus, Anacreon and Sappho, Virgil, Horace, Lucretius and many others. His most important original works are: &quot;Les Vies des poètes Grecs&quot; (Lives of the Greek Poets, 1665); &quot;Méthode pour commencer les humanités Grecques et latines&quot; (Method to Start the Greek and Latin Humanities, 2nd ed., 1731), of which several English adaptations have appeared, such as Jenkin Thomas Philipps&#x27;s &quot;A Compendious Way of Teaching Ancient and Modern Languages&quot; (1750); and &quot;Epistolae Criticae&quot; (1659).

<text>The University of Bradford is a public research university located in the city of Bradford, West Yorkshire, England. A plate glass university, it received its royal charter in 1966, making it the 40th university to be created in Britain, but can trace its origins back to the establishment of the industrial West Yorkshire town&#x27;s Mechanics Institute in 1832.

The student population includes 11,665 undergraduate and 7,923 postgraduate students. Mature students make up around a third of the undergraduate community. A total of 22% of students are foreign and come from over 110 countries. There were 14,406 applications to the university through UCAS in 2010, of which 3,421 were accepted.

It was the first British university to establish a Department of Peace Studies in 1973, which is currently the world&#x27;s largest university centre for the study of peace and conflict.

== History ==

The university&#x27;s origins date back to &quot;the Mechanics Institute&quot;, founded in 1832, formed in response to the need in the city for workers with skills relevant to the workplace. In 1882, the institute became the &quot;Bradford Technical College&quot;. In 1957, the &quot;Bradford Institute of Technology&quot;, was formed as a &quot;College of Advanced Technology&quot; to take on the running of higher education courses. Construction of the Richmond Building, the largest building on campus, began in 1963. The Horton Building and Chesham Building were subsequently added, on the opposite side of Richmond Road.

The charter of incorporation was granted in 1966, to create the University of Bradford; the then Prime Minister Harold Wilson became the university&#x27;s first chancellor. In 1970s the university became an important international centre in the field of Yugoslav studies with the establishment of the University of Bradford Postgraduate School of Yugoslav Studies serving as a core institution in this effort. Research Unit in Yugoslav Studies at Bradford was established already in 1965 with significant involvement of British geographer Frederick Bernard Singleton. After her exile from South Africa AnnMarie Wolpe gained a post at the Bradford Department of Yugoslav Studies in 1963.

===1980s and 1990s===
Expansion of the main campus continued in the 1970s and onwards, with the addition of the Library and Computer Centre, Communal Building, Pemberton Building and Ashfield Building. An extension to the Library and Computer Centre was completed in the mid-1990s. In 1996, the university joined with the former Bradford and Airedale College of Health, which then became the School of Health Studies within the university. The Department of Physics was closed in the 1980s. The Department of Mathematics was closed to new undergraduates in 1997, with the remaining postgraduate activities and lecture support being integrated into the Department of Computing as the Mathematics Unit. The Department of Mathematics has since been reopened within the School of Computing, Informatics and Media.

In 1987, the university became one of the twelve founding members of the Northern Consortium.

===21st century===
In September 2009, it was announced that the university was to merge with Leeds College of Music. The college had originally announced a merger with Leeds Metropolitan University in April 2009. However, discussions broke down due to issues with the provision of further education courses at the college.
It was later announced that this merger would not go ahead due to financial constraints. LCM&#x27;s degrees are now validated by the University of Hull.

==Campus==

===Facilities===
In 2005, a project to become an &#x27;Ecoversity&#x27; was initiated, along with an £84 million redevelopment of the campus. The university aimed to reduce its environmental footprint by reducing waste and using sustainable materials. As part of this, Bradford became a Fairtrade University in December 2006.

As of 2008, several of the redevelopment projects have been completed. The Richmond Building has been partially re-clad with extra insulation and a new atrium; designed by local Saltaire-based architects Rance Booth &amp; Smith; opened in December 2006, the roof of which uses ETFE – the same material used in the Eden Project. The university&#x27;s cancer therapeutics research centre was moved from a separate site on All Saint&#x27;s Road onto the main campus, into a new building which also provides conference facilities; the buildings on the old site were demolished in February 2008.

Redevelopment of the sports facilities was completed in summer 2009, and a new student village called &quot;The Green&quot; was constructed which opened in September 2011. The Green has the highest ever BREEAM rating for any building. Of the existing halls owned by the university, those on the Laisteridge Lane site were sold to &quot;Corporate Residential Management&quot; in 2005, and Shearbridge Green Halls were demolished in December 2006. Longside Lane halls and Kirkstone Halls were demolished during the first half of 2009.

The university has a &quot;leading-edge 100-seat PC cluster&quot; for teaching, learning and computer-based assessment, and there is an art gallery, theatre and music centre. The £84 million investment in the campus included a major refurbishment of the laboratories in the school of life sciences, creation of a new MBA suite and library at the school of management, refurbishment of the student union building, Student Central.

The university has won its campus the award for &#x27;Outstanding Contribution to Sustainable Development&#x27; in &quot;The Times&quot; Higher Education Awards two years running.

In 2021, university campus buildings underwent a £3.5 million facelift, working on improving energy efficiency and reducing carbon emissions. Upgrades to the campus were performed on the Richmond Building and Horton Building. Additionally, in 2022 the university was donated £2 million by former Intel CTO and Bradford alumni, Dr. Venkata &quot;Murthy&quot; Renduchintala, to develop the &quot;Murthy-Renduchintala Centre for Space AI&quot; and announced plans to launch a prototype PocketQube satellite by 2024.

===J. B. Priestley Library===

The J. B. Priestley library is open 24 hours, 360 days a year. It has 530,000 volumes, more than 1,100 printed periodical titles and approximately 60,000 electronic journals.

The library itself was opened on 18 October 1975 by J.B. Priestley - who the library is named after - as well as the then university chancellor Harold Wilson. At the time, the library boasted an impressive computer centre, occupying a whole floor out of the five available library floors. The library was then expanded further in the 1990s.

===Accommodation===
The Green, which opened September 2011, is a £40 million purpose built student accommodation village. Designed for eco-friendly living, The Green has the highest ever BREEAM rating for any building (95.05%), awarded for sustainable building development and operation. It is also the first BREEAM &#x27;Outstanding&#x27; student accommodation in the country.

===Faculties===
There are four academic faculties. These were previously called &quot;schools&quot; but changed their name in 2014 to avoid confusion with the sub-units also sometimes called schools. Many buildings and facilities, such as lecture theatres, are shared and used by all faculties.

====Engineering &amp; Informatics====

On 1 October 2013, the School of Engineering, Design and Technology and the School of Computing, Informatics and Media were merged to form the Faculty of Engineering and Informatics. Three schools make up this new overarching Faculty: the School of Engineering (Mechanical and Energy Systems Engineering, Biomedical and Electronics Engineering, Civil and Structural Engineering &amp; Chemical Engineering programmes), the School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (Electrical &amp; Electronic Engineering, Computing &amp; Maths programmes) and the School of Media, Design &amp; Technology (Media &amp; Design programmes).

The following describes the former schools of EDT &amp; SCIM:

=====Computing, Informatics and Media=====
The second-largest school in the university consists of the departments of Computing, Bradford Media School (BMS), Creative Technology (CT) and Mathematics.

SCIM offers over 40 undergraduate degrees and postgraduate study in various areas including computing, ICT, robotics, mathematics, media and television. The School has a very lively research culture with over 100 students registered for MPhil/PhD.

The Department of Computing was one of the first in the UK to run an MSc course in Computing in 1967. Undergraduate courses began in 1970.

The EIMC department was founded in 1991 and developed its courses in conjunction with the School of Art, Design &amp; Textiles at Bradford and Ilkley Community College (now known as Bradford College) and the National Museum of Photography, Film and Television (now the National Media Museum). It was one of the first departments to offer BSc courses in media technology, going on to introduce some of the first animation and computer games degrees, and more recently expanding to offer a new range of similar BA courses. Today, SCIM no longer works in association with the college, but has strengthened its relationship with the nearby National Media Museum. In association with the Department of Computing, it obtained a research grade 4 at RAE 2001.

A non-linear video editing / training suite is named in honour of the Shipley born film director Tony Richardson, and was opened by his daughter, the film actress Natasha Richardson in 1996.

In 2007 the School launched a partnership with East Coast Media at the Grimsby Institute and the National Media Museum to bid for Skillset Media Academy status, which was granted in 2008. Accreditation mainly covers courses in the Bradford Media School.

A core part of the school is the Innovations Unit, which offers the expertise of specialists within SCIM to commercial and social enterprises. This collaboration is part of a government initiative called Knowledge Transfer, which also includes partnerships with national and international companies. The IIU is also home to &quot;Simula&quot;, which using knowledge transfer and resources for commercial projects including the school&#x27;s motion capture suite for video games including Driver Parallel Lines, World Snooker Championships and GTR.

=====Engineering, Design and Technology=====
The university inherited several engineering courses from the Bradford Institute of Technology and some of these courses, such as Civil Engineering, are still taught today. All of the engineering courses are accredited by their relevant institute. The school also has a large number of both undergraduate and postgraduate design and technology courses. Its research areas include automotive engineering, polymers, telecommunications and advanced materials engineering.

From the establishment of the university in 1966, the individual branches of engineering were taught in separate departments. When reorganisation of the three faculties of the university took place, a single School of Engineering, Design and Technology was created and incorporated the Department of Mechanical Engineering, the Department of Civil &amp; Structural Engineering, the Department of Electrical &amp; Electronic Engineering and the Department of Industrial Studies. The Department of Chemical Engineering was closed shortly before the creation of the new school. However, in 2010, an undergraduate programme in Chemical Engineering was re-launched in 2010 with support from the Institute of Chemical Engineers – the first graduates from the three year BEng version of this course graduated in June 2013. In 2012 a postgraduate course was also launched.

====Health Studies====
Faculty of Health Studies was formerly the School of Nursing and before that it was the Airedale College of Health, this became part of the university in 1996; previously it was an associate college with the university validating its degrees. The School has moved to the main city campus, into the Horton A building which underwent major refurbishment in 2011. The Horton building was extended and another floor added to accommodate the School of Nursing. The School of Nursing was previously located on a separate site on Trinity Road, about 10 minutes walk from the main campus and near to St Luke&#x27;s Hospital.

It specialises in degrees in nursing, physiotherapy, midwifery, occupational therapy and radiography. A specialist drug therapy course is run by the department and there are also part-time courses in dementia care. The department&#x27;s student demographics are largely female, with a higher proportion of mature students.

The physiotherapy course is ranked 9th and 3rd in the 2014 and 2017 UK complete university guide.
====Life Sciences====
The Faculty of Life Sciences has the most students of all of the schools, with more than 2,000 students admitted to a variety of undergraduate courses in the areas of Biomedical Sciences, Chemical and Forensic Science, Clinical Sciences, Optometry, Pharmacy and Archaeological, Geographical and Environmental Sciences.

The Bradford School of Optometry and Vision Science (BSOVS) has its own Eye Clinic, situated in the DHEZ – Phoenix South West Building, providing Primary Care for the local community in conjunction with a student training facility. BSOVS also provides a variety of other clinical services (e.g. an Electro-diagnostic Unit opened October 2010) that people may be referred to by practitioners.

The Centre for Skin Sciences is one of the largest academic centres in Britain for fundamental and translational skin and hair follicle research.

The Institute of Cancer Therapeutics has an excellent reputation for research and there is very close collaboration with staff from other divisions within the School.

The Division of Archaeological, Geographical and Environmental Sciences is located in refurbished, late 19th century mill buildings, housing extensive specialist facilities. Formerly a separate school, it was merged with Life Sciences in 2006.

====Management, Law, and Social Sciences====
The Faculty of Management, Law, and Social Sciences is a recent merger. Until 2018 Social Sciences was separate. Management and Law, consisting of Bradford School of Management and the Law School was previously located away from the main campus on a parkland campus, Emm Lane. In 2019, the university moved its Faculty of Management, Law and Social Sciences to its main city centre campus. It teaches courses in business, finance, accountancy, management and marketing. As of 2005 the department commenced teaching an accredited LLB law degree. It has a number of master&#x27;s degrees, MBA programmes and doctoral programmes running alongside undergraduate programmes.

Its research is both international and interdisciplinary and has five main research groups covering all the main areas of management, and co-operative links and exchange agreements with 20 universities in America, Australia, Canada, Denmark, France, the Netherlands, Spain and Sweden.

The School of Management has full Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) accreditation for DBA and PhD programmes, portfolio Association of MBAs accreditation for MBA programmes and EQUIS accreditation.

====Social and International Studies====
The School of Social and International Studies covers the areas of development, economics, humanities (including English and history), politics, international relations, peace studies, psychology, criminology and social work. The school offers a range of taught undergraduate and postgraduate courses and has a number of active research areas, especially in conflict resolution. The school is actively engaged in the Programme for a Peaceful City initiative.

It contains six division (some of which were previously called Departments or Schools) Divisions of Economics, Peace Studies, International Development (BCID), Sociology and Criminology, Psychology and finally Social Care and Social Work.

The Centre for Psychology Studies offers a psychology course for undergraduates, accredited by the British Psychological Society. In 2008, Lord Winston officially opened new state of the art psychology laboratories, for teaching and research. One of the university&#x27;s most popular courses, The National Student Survey ranked Psychology at Bradford as being within the Top 5 in the UK with 94% Student Satisfaction.

==Academic profile==

===Motto===
The motto which appears on most current University of Bradford publications is &quot;Making Knowledge Work&quot;, which relates to the institution&#x27;s focus on courses that lead to employment. The university announced in June 2007 it was to use this phrase as a trademark.

However, the motto inscribed beneath the official coat of arms is &quot;Give Invention Light&quot;, which is taken from Shakespeare&#x27;s Sonnet 38. The university has also used the slogans &quot;Be Inspired&quot; and &quot;Confronting Inequality, Celebrating Diversity&quot; in recent promotional material.

===Reputation and rankings===

&quot;The Times&quot; Good University Guide ranked Bradford 7th in UK for graduate employment in 2005 and 2nd in 2006.

The university has a strong reputation for research and knowledge transfer. It is ranked in the Top 50 English Universities based on research funding (HEFCE 2009–10).

Staff-student ratios are amongst the best in the UK (The University of Bradford is in the 2nd quartile for staff-student ratios in &quot;The Independent&quot;, &quot;The Times&quot; and &quot;The Guardian&quot; League Tables). The 2008 RAE reported that 80 per cent of academics at the university who submitted research to the panel are doing international or world-leading research.

==Student life==

===Students&#x27; Union===
Membership at the University of Bradford&#x27;s Students&#x27; Union (UBU), is automatic upon confirmation of enrolment. UBU has advice services, a radio station, and runs many societies and sports clubs. The union is run by an annually elected Council, which includes an executive committee of six full-time sabbatical officers and nine non-sabbatical officers. The sabbaticals are slightly unusual within the sector, in having a &#x27;flat structure&#x27;, lacking a Union President: the post was abolished by then President Shumon Rahman in 2001.

The union is located in the Student Central building on campus, alongside the university bars, a cafe and shop, and the library. Union of Students (UBU) is available to assist students by giving necessary advice and information.

====Activities====
Students may make use of the &#x27;Unique&#x27; centre which is located on campus. Facilities include a fitness suite, an indoor 25-metre swimming pool and a climbing wall.

The largest student involvement in their Union comes in the forms of the sports clubs (through the Athletics Union, commonly known as the AU), and the societies (through the Societies Federation). There is a wide variety of both, including many course related societies such as the Bradford Ophthalmic Optics Student Association. Students are also free to start their own societies.

The Student Union also has Ramair, one of the UK&#x27;s longest running student radio stations, as well as a student newspaper and the long-established Bradford Student Cinema that regularly screens recent releases to students and staff for free. RamAir hosted the Student Radio Conference in 2012 with student Ian Thursfield winning a national award for Radio in 2011.

===University Challenge===
The university were champions of University Challenge in 1979 on 28 January 1979, when Bradford defeated Lancaster University in the third leg by 215 points to 160. It was less successful in 2004, achieving only 35 points, the joint 3rd lowest score ever recorded on the show.

<text>Anne Le Fèvre Dacier (; 1651 – 17 August 1720), better known during her lifetime as Madame Dacier (), was a French scholar, translator, commentator and editor of the classics, including the &quot;Iliad&quot; and the &quot;Odyssey&quot;. She sought to champion ancient literature and used her great capabilities in Latin and Greek for this purpose as well as for her own financial support, producing a series of editions and translations from which she earned her living. She was the dedicatee of Gilles Ménage&#x27;s &quot;Historia mulierum philosopharum,&quot; whose characterisation of her and of Anna Maria van Schurman was used to provide leading examples in treatises arguing for female education across the following centuries.

The exact date of her birth is not known and sources differ in their opinions: 1647 is proposed by Frade and Wyles and also Conley in the &quot;Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy&quot;; the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; suggests 1654; and the &quot;Catholic Encyclopedia&quot; 1651. The only known portrait of her, dated 1854, has her death at the age of 68, suggesting 1651–52. Eliane Itti argues for 1645, on the basis of the parish register at Is-sur-Tille which would set the date of her baptism to 24 December 1645. Dacier was first raised at Preuilly, in Touraine, where her sister Marguerite was born. She spent the rest of her childhood in Saumur, a town in the Loire region of France, and was taught both Latin and ancient Greek by her father, Tanneguy Le Fèvre.

On 29 October 1662, she married Jean Lesnier II. They had a son, Taneguy, born in January 1669, but who died three weeks later. The couple separated around 1670. In 1683, she married one of her father&#x27;s students, André Dacier (also engaged in classical studies and translations albeit his work is considered by encyclopedia editors to be far inferior to hers). 

==Classical editions and translations==
Her father died in 1672, after which she moved to Paris, carrying with her part of an edition of Callimachus, which she published in 1674. She gained further work through a friend of her father, Pierre-Daniel Huet, then assistant tutor to the Dauphin and responsible for the &quot;Ad usum Delphini&quot; series (commonly known as the Delphin Classics) of editions of the Latin classics. He commissioned her to produce editions for the series of Publius Annius Florus (1674), Dictys Cretensis (1680), Sextus Aurelius Victor (1681) and Eutropius (1683).

In 1681, her prose version of Anacreon and Sappho appeared, and in the next few years, she published prose versions of Plautus&#x27; &quot;Amphitryon&quot;, &quot;Epidicus&quot; and &quot;Rudens&quot; (1683), Aristophanes&#x27; &quot;Plutus&quot; and &quot;Clouds&quot; (1684, the first translations of Aristophanes in French) and Terence&#x27;s six comedies (1688). In 1684 she and her husband retired to Castres, with the object of devoting themselves to theological studies. In 1685 the Daciers were rewarded with a pension by Louis XIV of France for their conversion to Roman Catholicism. Anne and André Dacier collaborated on two translations, Marcus Aurelius&#x27; &quot;Meditations&quot; (1691) and Plutarch&#x27;s first six &quot;Parallel Lives&quot; (1694).

In 1699, her prose translation of the &quot;Iliad&quot; appeared, which earned her the esteem in which she is held in French literature. It was followed nine years later by a similar translation of the &quot;Odyssey&quot;, which Alexander Pope found useful. Dacier in turn published in 1724 remarks on Pope&#x27;s translation of the former (1715–20), which gained her some fame in England as well.

==Controversy==
The &quot;Iliad&quot;, which made Homer known for the first time to many French men of letters (including Antoine Houdar de la Motte) gave rise to a famous literary controversy. In 1714, La Motte published a poetical version of the &quot;Iliad&quot;, abridged and altered to suit his own taste, together with a &quot;Discours sur Homère (&quot;Discourse on Homer&quot;)&quot;, stating the reasons why Homer failed to satisfy his critical taste. Dacier replied in the same year in her work, &quot;Des causes de la corruption du goût (&quot;Of the Causes of the Corruption of Taste&quot;).&quot; In defending Homer, Dacier &quot;developed her own philosophical aesthetics. She insists on the centrality of taste as an indicator of the level of civilization, both moral and artistic, within a particular culture.&quot;

La Motte carried on the discussion with light gaiety and &quot;badinage&quot;, and had the happiness of seeing his views supported by the abbé Jean Terrasson, who in 1715 produced two volumes titled &quot;Dissertation critique sur L&#x27;Iliade (&quot;Critical essay on The Iliad&quot;)&quot;, in which he maintained that science and philosophy, and especially the science and philosophy of René Descartes, had so developed the human mind that the poets of the eighteenth century were immeasurably superior to those of ancient Greece.

In the same year, Claude Buffier published &quot;Homère en arbitrage (&quot;Homer in arbitration&quot;)&quot;, in which he concluded that both parties were really agreed on the essential point that Homer was one of the greatest geniuses the world had seen, and that, as a whole, no other poem could be preferred to his; and, soon after (on 5 April 1716) in the house of Jean-Baptiste-Henri de Valincour, Dacier and La Motte met at supper, and drank to the health of Homer.

Like many eighteenth-century intellectual women, she faced sexism and criticism of her work during her lifetime. Enlightenment philosopher Immanuel Kant, in his &quot;Observations on the Feeling of the Beautiful and Sublime&quot;, critiqued learned women of the time, including Mme. Dacier stating: &quot;A Woman who has a head full of Greek, like Mme. Dacier, or who conducts disputations about mechanics, like the Marquise du Châtelet might as well also wear a beard; for that might perhaps better express the mien of depth for which they strive.&quot;

<text>Cockermouth is a market town and civil parish in the Cumberland unitary authority area of Cumbria, England, so named because it is at the confluence of the River Cocker as it flows into the River Derwent. The mid-2010 census estimates state that Cockermouth has a population of 8,204, increasing to 8,761 at the 2011 Census.

Historically a part of Cumberland, Cockermouth is situated outside the English Lake District on its north-west fringe. Much of the architectural core of the town remains unchanged since the basic medieval layout was filled in the 18th and 19th centuries. The regenerated market place is now a central historical focus within the town and reflects events from its 800-year history. The town is prone to flooding and experienced severe floods in 2005, 2009 and 2015.

Mary, Queen of Scots came to Cockermouth in 1568, after her defeat at the Battle of Langside. She is said to have stayed at the house of Henry Fletcher (died 1574), who gave her a velvet gown and she later sent him a letter of thanks. Fletcher&#x27;s son moved from Cockermouth to Moresby Hall in Parton, Cumbria.

==Etymology==
&quot;Cockermouth&quot; is &quot;the mouth of the River Cocker&quot;; the river takes its name from the Brythonic Celtic word , meaning &#x27;the crooked one&#x27;. It has frequently been noted on lists of unusual place names.

==History==
The Romans built a fort at Derventio Carvetiorum, now the adjoining village of Papcastle, to protect the river crossing on a major route for troops heading towards Hadrian&#x27;s Wall.

The main town developed under the Normans who, after occupying the former Roman fort, built Cockermouth Castle closer to the river crossing; little remains today of the castle thanks to the efforts of Robert the Bruce. The market town developed its distinctive medieval layout, of a broad main street of burgesses&#x27; houses, each with a burgage plot stretching to a &quot;back lane&quot;: the Derwent bank on the north and Back Lane (now South Street), on the south. The layout is largely preserved, leading the British Council for Archaeology to say in 1965 that it was &quot;worthy of special care in preservation and development.&quot;

Although Carlisle was considered the county town of Cumberland, Cockermouth shared the county assizes; prior to the Reform Act 1832, it was the usual venue for electing knights of the shire as MPs for Cumberland. Cockermouth borough was also a parliamentary borough from 1641 to 1918, returning two MPs until 1868 and one thereafter.

===Market centre===
The town market pre-dates 1221, when the market day was changed from Saturday to Monday. Market charters were granted in 1221 and 1227 by King Henry III, although this does not preclude the much earlier existence of a market in the town. In recent times, the trading farmers market now only occurs seasonally, replaced by weekend continental and craft markets.

In the days when opening hours of public houses were restricted, the fact that the pubs in Cockermouth could open all day on market days made the town a popular destination for drinkers, especially on Bank Holiday Mondays. The Market Bell remains as a reminder of this period (inset into a wall opposite the Allerdale Hotel), while the 1761 and Castle pub (which spans three floors) have been renovated to reveal medieval stonework and 16th and 18th-century features.

===Flooding===
Cockermouth suffered badly in the nationwide floods of 19 and 20 November 2009. Over 200 people needed to be rescued, with helicopters from RAF Valley, RAF Boulmer and RAF Leconfield retrieving about 50 and the remainder being rescued by boats, including those of the RNLI. Water levels in the town centre were reported to be as high as and flowing at a rate of 25 knots. Many historic buildings on and adjacent to Main Street sustained severe damage, as did a number of bridges in and around the town. Recovery from the devastation was slow, with residents placed in temporary accommodation and some businesses temporarily relocated to Mitchells auction mart. By the summer of 2011, most of the damage had been repaired and buildings re-occupied, though some remained empty or boarded up.

Flooding occurred again in 2015, when the River Derwent burst its banks on 5 December, with several hundred homes and businesses affected.

The rear part of the Old Courthouse collapsed into the River Cocker in October 2023.

===Architecture===
Much of the centre of the town is of medieval origin, substantially rebuilt in Georgian style with Victorian infill. The tree-lined Kirkgate offers examples of unspoilt classical late 17th and 18th-century terraced housing, cobbled paving and curving lanes which run steeply down to the River Cocker. Most of the buildings are of traditional slate and stone construction with thick walls and green Skiddaw slate roofs.

Many of the facades lining the streets are frontages for historic housing in alleyways and lanes (often maintaining medieval street patterns) to the rear. There are examples of Georgian residences near the Market Place, St. Helens Street, at the bottom of Castlegate Drive and Kirkgate.

Cockermouth may have been the first town in Britain to have piloted electric lighting. In 1881, six electric lamps were set up to light the town, together with gas oil lamps in the back streets. The electrical service was intermittent, so the town returned to gas lighting.

In 1964, Cockermouth was named one of 51 &quot;Gem Towns&quot; in the UK, by the Council for British Archaeology. This recognised the importance of the historic buildings and the need for effective traffic management and urban development.

==Geography==
Cockermouth owes its existence to the confluence of the rivers Cocker and Derwent, historically being the lowest point at which the resultant fast flowing river powered by the Lake District could be bridged. Cockermouth is situated a few minutes&#x27; travelling distance from lakes such as Buttermere, Crummock Water, Loweswater and Bassenthwaite.

===Climate===
Cockermouth has a temperate climate that is influenced by the Irish Sea and its low-lying elevation; it receives slightly below average rainfall compared with the UK average. Temperatures are also about average compared with other parts of the UK. The nearest weather station, for which online records are available, is Aspatria, about north-north-east of the town centre.

The hottest temperatures recorded in the area were at Lorton on 19 July 2006 and at Aspatria during August 1990, with the coldest being during January 1982 at Aspatria and at Lorton on 8 December 2010. West Cumbria gets relatively little snow in comparison with the Lake District and Eastern Cumbria, owing to its proximity to the Irish Sea and its low height above sea level.

==Governance==
The town has been part of the Penrith &amp; Solway constituency since 2024 and has been represented by Markus Campbell-Savours of the Labour Party since the 2024 general election. The town was previously part of the parliamentary constituency of Workington, which was abolished in the 2023 boundary review. 

In the December 2019 general election, the Conservative candidate for Workington, Mark Jenkinson, was elected as the Member of Parliament (MP), overturning a 9.4 per cent Labour majority from the 2017 election to eject shadow environment secretary Sue Hayman by a margin of 4,136 votes. Until the December 2019 general election, Labour had won the seat in every general election since 1979; the Conservatives have only been elected in Workington one other time since World War II, at the 1976 by-election, after three decades of service by Fred Peart. The town historically has been a Labour-supporting area.

Prior to Brexit for the European Parliament its residents voted to elect MEPs for the North West England constituency.

Since April 2023, for local administration purposes, Cockermouth is in the Cumberland (unitary authority) area, previously being part of the Allerdale District &amp; Cumbria County Council, which were both abolished on 1 April 2023.

==Present==
The centre of Cockermouth retains much of its historic character and the renovation of Market Place has been completed, now with an artistic and community focus. The Kirkgate Centre is the town&#x27;s major cultural focus and offers regular historical displays by the Cockermouth Heritage Group in addition to holding major cultural events including theatre, international music and world cinema. The tree-lined main street boasts a statue of Lord Mayo, formerly an MP for Cockermouth, who became British Viceroy of India and whose subsequent claim to fame was that he was assassinated.

The renovated arts and cultural zone in the 13th-century Market Place has undergone something of a regeneration following European Union funding; it is now pedestrian-friendly adorned with stone paving and roadways, underground lighting and seating in bright colours to reflect the area&#x27;s facades. Pavement art and stonework commemorate eclectic historical events, John Dalton&#x27;s atomic theory, local dialect, flooding and a curious range other memorabilia.

A shared-use path runs along the former Cockermouth, Keswick and Penrith Railway route and spans a high bridge over the Cocker, affording views of the town and river-scape.

==Landmarks==


Cockermouth Castle is a sizeable but partly ruined Norman castle, formerly the home of the late Pamela, The Dowager Lady Egremont. Built at the confluence of the Rivers Cocker and Derwent, the castle has a tilting tower which hangs Pisa-like over Jennings Brewery buildings. The castle, with its preserved dungeons, is only opened to the public once a year during the annual town festival.

Wordsworth House, the birthplace of William Wordsworth and Dorothy Wordsworth, has been restored following extensive damage during the November 2009 floods; it features a working 18th-century kitchen and children&#x27;s bedroom with toys and clothes of the times. Harris Park offers riverside walks and views down over the historic town.

Jennings Brewery offered regular public tours and occasional carriage rides pulled by a shire horse. However, the brewery was closed in October 2022, with the buildings valued at £750,000 put up for sale.

Cockermouth Town Hall is a former chapel which was converted for municipal use in 1934.

Culturally, the Kirkgate Centre offers international music, heritage, theatre and world cinema (including critically acclaimed and art-house movies on Monday evenings) and the town has an annual festival of concerts and performances each summer. Cockermouth has an annual Easter Fair, fireworks display and carnival. In April 2005, it hosted its first Georgian Fair, which was repeated in 2006, again in May 2008 and 2010, with the next fair on 2 May 2015. At Christmas, the town presents festive lighting throughout its main and subsidiary streets, accompanied by competing shop displays.

The main cemetery on the Lorton Road is something of a walkers&#x27; garden, featuring streams, humped stone bridges and views of the nearby fells.

The adjoining village of Papcastle is also picturesque in its own right and stands on the site of the Roman fort of Derventio (Papcastle), lined with grand 18th- and 19th-century houses.

Located north-west of the town lies Dovenby Hall Estate, a park and woodland estate. Dovenby Hall is the home of the Ford Rally team. The estate was bought in January 1998 by Malcolm Wilson for his &quot;M-Sport&quot; motorsport team and was selected in 1996 by Ford Motorsport to build, prepare and run a fleet of cars for entry into the World Rally Championship.

==Economy and services==
Built as a market town, close to a fast-flowing river in a farming area with a tradition of cloth weaving, Cockermouth became a hub for spinning and weaving. The town had a fulling mill by 1156 and by the mid-19th century there were over forty industrial sites; mills (wool, linen, cotton), hat factories, tanneries and smaller concerns making chairs, churns, mangle rollers, nails and farm machinery.

With the need for steam power, industrialisation declined, but the coming of the railway and the Victorian holiday, together with the power of Wordsworth&#x27;s publications, meant that Cockermouth became an early inland tourist centre. The local economy is still reliant today on farming and tourism, with light industrial facilities servicing local needs. Industrialisation and hence work has moved to the west coast around Carlisle and Workington, and includes servicing the nuclear facilities at Sellafield.

Road haulier Lawsons Haulage Limited is a major employer in the town.

==Education==
Cockermouth has two primary schools: 
* Fairfield Primary School
* All Saints Church of England Primary School

Cockermouth School is a comprehensive secondary school, with around 1,400 pupils including 310 sixth formers. It won the north of England regional championship in the &quot;Kids&#x27; Lit Quiz 2009&quot;, coming first with 92 points.

In 2023, Whitehaven&#x27;s Mayfield School opened its sixth form campus to children with special educational needs and disabilities. The site was previously St Joseph&#x27;s Primary School, which was closed in 2022.

The Cockermouth, Keswick and Penrith Railway once served the town. The original Cockermouth &amp; Workington Railway station was replaced on a new alignment when the Cockermouth railway station opened to passenger traffic on 2 January 1865. The station was immortalised in 1964 in the song &quot;Slow Train&quot; by Flanders and Swann. The station closed on 18 April 1966 and has been completely removed. The site is now occupied by Cockermouth Mountain Rescue and the town&#x27;s fire station, operated by Cumbria Fire and Rescue Service. The old trackbed is now a shared-use path.

=== Buses ===
Bus services in Cockermouth are operated primarily by Stagecoach Cumbria; key routes include the X4 and X5 to Workington and Keswick, and the 600 to Carlisle. Other routes are operated by Ellenvale Coaches, including the 68 to Maryport.

==Sport and leisure==
Cockermouth has a sports centre with swimming pool, two gyms and two parks with riverside walks.

Cockermouth Cricket Club is one of the town&#x27;s most successful and best supported sports teams. They play their home games at the Sandair Ground, located just off Gote Road. The First XI play in the North Lancashire and Cumbria League Premier Division, Second XI in the third tier of the same league. The club&#x27;s Third XI play in the Cumbria Cricket League. The thriving junior section of the club runs from under 11s to 15s.

Cockermouth School has an astroturf pitch used for community football, including the local six-a-side league.

Cockermouth Rugby Football Club is based at the former Cockermouth Grammar School site; in 1987, it played the first ever rugby union league match when they played Kirkby Lonsdale when national and regional leagues were formed, the precursors of what have now become the national and premier leagues.

The town has a youth football club, Cockermouth F.C. In the 2007–2008 season, the Under 12 team were County Cup Champions. Cockermouth beat Allerdale Leisure, from Workington, 1–0 in the final.

<text>Dictys Cretensis, i.e. Dictys of Crete (, ; ) of Knossos was a legendary companion of Idomeneus during the Trojan War, and the purported author of a diary of its events, that deployed some of the same materials worked up by Homer for the &quot;Iliad&quot;. The story of his journal, an amusing fiction addressed to a knowledgeable Alexandrian audience, came to be taken literally during Late Antiquity.

==Literary history==
In the 4th century AD a certain Q. Septimius brought out &quot;Dictys Cretensis Ephemeris belli Trojani&quot; (&quot;Dictys of Crete, chronicle of the Trojan War&quot;) in six books, a work that professed to be a Latin translation of the Greek version. Its chief interest lies in the fact that, as knowledge of Greek waned and disappeared in Western Europe, this and the &quot;De excidio Trojae&quot; of Dares Phrygius were the sources from which the Homeric legends were transmitted to the Romance literature of the Middle Ages.

An elaborate frame story presented in the prologue to the Latin text details how the manuscript of this work, written in Phoenician characters on tablets of limewood or tree bark, survived: it was said to have been enclosed in a leaden box and buried with its author, according to his wishes.
:&quot;There it remained undisturbed for ages, when in the thirteenth year of Nero&#x27;s reign, the sepulchre was burst open by a terrible earthquake, the coffer was exposed to view, and observed by some shepherds, who, having ascertained that it did not, as they had at first hoped, contain a treasure, conveyed it to their master Eupraxis (or Eupraxides), who in his turn presented it to Rutilius Rufus, the Roman governor of the province, by whom both Eupraxis and the casket were despatched to the emperor. Nero, upon learning that the letters were Phoenician, summoned to his presence men skilled in that language, by whom the contents were explained. The whole having been translated into Greek, was deposited in one of the public libraries, and Eupraxis was dismissed loaded with rewards.&quot; (Smith, &quot;Dictionary&quot;)

The Greek &quot;name&quot; Eupraxis simply means &quot;right actions&quot;, a familiar goal in discussions of ethics, and an amusingly apt name for the finder.

The prologue that characterizes one manuscript tradition is substituted in the other main group of manuscripts with a letter as if written by a Q. Septimius Romanus, to a Q. Arcadius Rufus, in which the writer, giving a condensed version of the discovery tale, informs his friend that, the volume having fallen into his hands, he had been induced, for his own amusement and the instruction of others, to convert it into Latin. The modern editor, Werner Eisenhut, surmises that the two groups, neither of which is to be consistently preferred to the other, represent two published editions in Late Antiquity. There are retranslations into Greek of Byzantine date, embodied in universal histories, of which Smith adds, &quot;We may add to this account, that the writers of the Byzantine period, such as Joannes Malelas, Constantinus Porphyrogenitus, Georgius Cedrenus, Constantinus Manasses, Joannes and Isaacus Tzetzes, with others, quote largely from this Dictys as an author of the highest and most unquestionable authority, and he certainly was known as early as the age of Aelian.&quot;

Petrarch&#x27;s own copy of &quot;Ephemeris belli Troiani&quot;, his key to Homer, is now the Codex Parisinus Lat. 5690, in the Bibliothèque nationale. The first printed edition was early, not after 1471.

Modern scholars were in disagreement as to whether any Greek original really existed; but all doubt on the point was removed by the discovery of a fragment in Greek amongst the Tebtunis papyri found by Bernard Grenfell and Arthur Hunt in 1899–1900. It revealed that the Latin was a close translation. The other surprise was the discovery, in the library of conte Aurelio Guglielmo Balleani at Jesi, of a manuscript of Dictys, dating to the latter part of the ninth century, that was described and collated by C. Annibaldi in 1907.

For a medieval source on the Trojan War that is uniquely independent of Dictys and Dares, see the &quot;Rawlinson Excidium Troie&quot;.

<text>The University of Glamorgan () was a public university based in South Wales, that merged with University of Wales, Newport to form the University of South Wales in April 2013. The university was based in Pontypridd, in Rhondda Cynon Taf, with campuses in Trefforest, Glyntaff, Merthyr Tydfil, Tyn y Wern (The Glamorgan Sport Park) and Cardiff. The university had four faculties and was the only university in Wales which had no link with the University of Wales.

The university was founded in 1913 as the South Wales and Monmouthshire School of Mines, serving the large coal mining industry in the South Wales Valleys.

==History==
The University of Glamorgan was founded in 1913 as the South Wales and Monmouthshire School of Mines, a School of Mines based in Trefforest, Pontypridd, serving the large coal mining industry in the South Wales Valleys. The school was owned and funded by the major Welsh coal owners, through a levy of one tenth of a penny on each ton of coal produced by the companies involved. At the outset, the school had 17 mining diploma students, including three from China. The school was taken over by Glamorgan County Council during the Depression, and became Glamorgan Technical College in 1949, reflecting its expanding portfolio, and the Glamorgan College of Technology in 1958. By this time, the institution had expanded to offer a range of full-time, sandwich and part-time courses in science, technology and commerce, to which it added the first &quot;Welsh for Adults&quot; course in 1967. In 1970, the college became a polytechnic. 

In 1914 Glamorgan County Council created Glamorgan Training College to train women to teach. It originally only took women who lived locally but in 1947, when Ellen Evans was the principal, it became co-educational and in 1962 it also accepted male students. Three years later it changed its name to Glamorgan College of Education.

The Glamorgan College of Education in Barry merged with Glamorgan Polytechnic merged and it was re-named the Polytechnic of Wales in 1975, before being awarded university status as the University of Glamorgan in 1992.

Between 2003 and 2013, the university engaged in an active growth strategy by merging with Merthyr Tydfil College in 2004/5 and forming a strategic alliance with the Royal Welsh College of Music and Drama in 2006, so that the Royal College became part of the &#x27;Glamorgan Group&#x27; of institutions. In 2007, &quot;ATRiuM&quot;, a new facility for teaching and research in media, design and the arts was opened in Cardiff city centre. A new Students&#x27; Union building at the Treforest Campus was opened in September 2010.

===Merger===
In July 2012 the University of Glamorgan and the University of Wales, Newport, announced that they had begun talks aimed at integrating the two institutions. On 17 December 2012 it was announced that the new university would be called the University of South Wales. The university at the time of the merger served around 21,500 students, with 10,227 registered as full-time undergraduates. The university offered around 200 courses and in 2009 claimed to have one of the highest graduate employment rates in Wales, reporting that 94.3% of 2007-08 graduates found employment within six months of graduation.

==Campuses==
The university had several campuses:

* Trefforest - the main campus with the majority of academic departments and facilities, including the indoor sports centre and students union.
* Glyntaff - housed the Faculty of Health, Sport and Science. Science and Sport subjects were based here, including Police Sciences and Nursing.
* Partner colleges - The university had specialised &quot;partner colleges&quot; throughout South Wales; for example, Barry College for aeronautical engineering.
* Merthyr Tydfil - Merthyr Tydfil College became part of the University of Glamorgan Group (but not part of the university), although focused on delivering Further Education rather than Higher Education.
*Tyn y Wern - home to the Glamorgan Sport Park.
* ATRiuM - The Cardiff School of Creative and Cultural Industries was based at a Cardiff campus located close to Cardiff Queen Street railway station.

===Facilities===
The following halls of residence were based at the Treforest campus:

* &quot;Glamorgan Court&quot; - Built in 1994, with all the rooms in the hall buildings arranged into clusters of six en-suite bedrooms with a shared kitchen.
* Mountain Halls Accommodation blocks opened in September 2011.
The University of Glamorgan Students&#x27; Union (Glam SU) was the students&#x27; union at the University of Glamorgan, primarily based at the university&#x27;s Treforest campus. The union was an affiliate of National Union of Students of the United Kingdom and part of NUS Wales. It offered representation, support and services to all the students of the university. The Student Union was the home to a number of sports teams, sports clubs and societies as well as TAG, the student newspaper. The Union has also welfare, education and equality support and there was a democratic structure change to Student Council.

The Oriel Y Bont galleries was an art gallery that hosted a collection of Ernest Zobole paintings. The &quot;Learning Resource Centre&quot; was the library of the university.

<doc id="367357" wikidata="Q586389" url="?curid=367357" title="Antoine Houdar de la Motte">
<text>Antoine Houdar de la Motte (18 January 167226 December 1731) was a French author.

De la Motte was born and died in Paris. In 1693 his comedy, &quot;Les Originaux&quot; (Les originaux, ou, l&#x27;Italien), was a complete failure, and so depressed the author that he contemplated joining the Trappists. Four years later he began writing texts for operas and ballets, e.g. &quot;L&#x27;Europe galante&quot; (1697), and tragedies, one of which, &quot;Inès de Castro&quot; (1723), was an immense success at the Theâtre Français. He was a champion of the moderns in the revived controversy of the ancients and moderns. His &quot;Fables nouvelles&quot; (1719) was regarded as a modernist manifesto. Anne Dacier had published (1699) a translation of the &quot;Iliad&quot;, and La Motte, who knew no Greek, made a translation (1714) in verse founded on her work.

He said of his own work: &quot;I have taken the liberty to change what I thought disagreeable in it.&quot; He defended the moderns in the &quot;Discours sur Homère&quot; prefixed to his translation, and in his &quot;Réflexions sur la critique&quot; (1716). Apart from the merits of the controversy, it was conducted on La Motte&#x27;s side with a wit and politeness which compared very favourably with his opponents&#x27; methods. He was elected to the Académie Française in 1710, but soon afterwards went blind. La Motte carried on a correspondence with the duchesse du Maine, and was the friend of Fontenelle. He had the same freedom from prejudice and the same inquiring mind as the latter, and it is on the excellent prose in which his views are expressed that his reputation rests.

His &quot;Œuvres du theâtre&quot; (2 vols.) appeared in 1730, and his &quot;Œuvres&quot; (10 vols.) in 1754. See , &quot;Histoire de la querelle des anciens et des modernes&quot; (1859).

<text>Khujut Rabu&#x27; () is a local area to the South-East of Baghdad, Iraq, near the town of the present-day Salman Pak. Also Khujut Rabua. Until 637 AD, this was the location of Ctesiphon and Seleucia on the Tigris. This area was the capital city of Iran, also known as Persia, and by the Romans as Ariana; during the Selucid, Parthian and Sasanian dynasties. Modern excavations of these two ancient cities have provided many artifacts from ancient times, including the alleged Baghdad Battery. Modern tourists can still visit Taq Kasra (the Arch of Ctesiphon).

<doc id="367361" wikidata="Q7864146" url="?curid=367361" title="UC Berkeley College of Engineering">
<text>The University of California, Berkeley College of Engineering (branded as Berkeley Engineering) is the public engineering school of the University of California, Berkeley (a land-grant research university in Berkeley, California). Established in 1931, it occupies fourteen buildings on the northeast side of the main campus and also operates the Richmond Field Station. It is also considered highly selective and is consistently ranked among the top engineering schools in both the nation and the world.

== Academics ==
The College of Letters and Science (L&amp;S) offers a Bachelor of Arts in Computer Science, which requires many of the same courses as the College of Engineering&#x27;s Bachelor of Science in Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences (EECS) but has different admissions and graduation criteria. It is one of the university&#x27;s most selective undergraduate programs, along with the College of Engineering&#x27;s EECS program; acceptance rates have been at or below 5% for both freshman and transfer applicants in recent years—5.2% for Fall 2020 EECS freshman applicants, which was lower than the MIT acceptance rate. Berkeley&#x27;s chemical and biomolecular engineering departments are under the College of Chemistry.

===Departments===
* Aerospace Engineering (AE)
* Bioengineering (BioE)
* Civil and Environmental Engineering (CEE) 
* Development Engineering (DevEng)
* Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences (EECS) 
* Engineering Science (ES)
** Energy Engineering (EE)
** Engineering Mathematics and Statistics (EMS)
** Engineering Physics (EP)
** Environmental Engineering Science (EES)
* Industrial Engineering and Operations Research (IEOR) 
* Materials Science and Engineering (MSE)
* Mechanical Engineering (ME) 
* Nuclear Engineering (NE)

== Students ==
There are approximately 4,100 undergraduates in the College of Engineering, which for the 2021/22 application cycle had an acceptance rate of 7.6%, while Berkeley as a whole had a 14% acceptance rate. The Management, Entrepreneurship &amp; Technology (M.E.T.) program, a dual-degree track offered in collaboration with the Haas School of Business, is even more selective, with an acceptance rate of less than 3%. Applicants to the college may apply directly to one of the departments and enter with a declared major or may apply as an undeclared matriculant; major declaration is required at the end of sophomore year. Once within the college, it is possible to change majors with the approval of Engineering Student Services but it is difficult for undergraduates in other colleges at Berkeley to transfer into Engineering. The college accepts transfer applications, although only 9% of the over 2,300 junior transfer applicants were admitted for the 2015/16 academic year.

Over 81% of undergraduates receive a bachelor&#x27;s degree in four years, with over 90% doing so within six years. 85% of undergraduates admitted to the college graduate from the college, and 91% graduate from some college at Berkeley. The college has a 4-year graduation policy, with extra semesters approved only in certain cases. Engineering Student Services provides academic advising, peer tutoring, and career services to engineering students. Various student organizations are run in conjunction with the college and many students belong to the student chapters of their corresponding professional organizations. Graduate admissions in the College of Engineering is administered by department. During the 2021/22 academic year, the college had 2,513 graduate students and awarded 228 masters and 244 doctorate degrees as well as 889 professional master&#x27;s degrees. 

The college&#x27;s enrollment is approximately 32% women. Berkeley has one of the oldest, most active and award-winning sections of the Society of Women Engineers (SWE); established in 1975, it has been recognized with the &quot;Outstanding Collegiate Section Gold Mission Award&quot; at the annual SWE national conference, which is the largest gathering for women in engineering and technology. Among Berkeley engineering alumnae are a 2018 Nobel laureate, a 2008 Turing Award winner, a 2012 Turing Award winner, the first woman to receive a bachelor&#x27;s degree in engineering from an American university, and the co-founders of Marvell Technology, Atheros Communications, and many other technology companies.

===Businesses and entrepreneurship===
The school is well-known for producing many successful entrepreneurs; among its alumni are the co-founders and CEOs of the largest companies in the world, including Apple, DoorDash, Coursera, Boeing, Google, Intel, and Tesla. Together with the Haas School of Business (the first American business school at a public university), the college confers joint degrees and advises the university&#x27;s resident start-up incubator. Founded in 2012, Berkeley SkyDeck promotes research and entrepreneurship in Silicon Valley, and has become a top university incubator in the United States.

=== Student organizations ===
*Eta Kappa Nu ()
*Pioneers in Engineering (PiE)
* Out in Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics (oSTEM)
* Design for America (DFA)
* Society of Women Engineers (SWE)
* Black Engineering and Science Student Association (BESSA)
* Robotics @ Berkeley
* Machine Learning @ Berkeley
* Mobile Developers of Berkeley

==Life==
Émile Egger was born in Paris.

From 1840 to 1855, Egger was assistant professor, and from 1855 until his death he was professor of Greek literature in the Faculté des Lettres at Paris University. In 1854 Egger was elected a member of the Académie des Inscriptions and in 1873 of the Conseil supérieur de l&#x27;instruction publique.

Egger was a voluminous writer, a sound and discerning scholar, and his influence was largely responsible for the revival of the study of classical philology in France. His most important works are as follows:
*&quot;Essai sur l&#x27;histoire de la critique chez les Grecs&quot; (1849)
*&quot;Notions élémentaires de grammaire compare&quot; (1852)
*&quot;Apollonius Dyscole, essai sur l&#x27;histoire des théories grammaticales dans l&#x27;Antiquité&quot; (1854)
*&quot;Mémoires de littérature ancienne&quot; (1862)
*&quot;Mémoires d&#x27;histoire ancienne et de philologie&quot; (1863)
*&quot;Les Papyrus grecs du Musée du Louvre et de la Bibliothèque Impériale&quot; (1865)
*&quot;Études sur les traits publics chez les Grecs et les Romains&quot; (1866)
*&quot;L&#x27;Hellénisme en France&quot; (1869)
*&quot;La Littérature grecque&quot; (1890).

He was also the author of &quot;Observations et réflexions sur le développement de l&#x27;intelligence et du langage chez les enfants&quot; (1879).

Egger died in 1885, and was buried at the Cimetière Montparnasse in Paris (facing the western wall, on the far right on entering from the north).

<text>Sextus Aurelius Victor (c. 320 – c. 390) was a historian and politician of the Roman Empire. Victor was the author of a short history of imperial Rome, entitled &quot;De Caesaribus&quot; and covering the period from Augustus to Constantius II. The work was published in 361. Under the emperor Julian (361-363), Victor served as governor of Pannonia Secunda; in 389 he became praefectus urbi (urban prefect), senior imperial official in Rome.

== Works ==
Four small historical works have been ascribed to him, although only his authorship of &quot;De Caesaribus&quot; is securely established:
#&quot;Origo Gentis Romanae&quot;
#&quot;De Viris Illustribus Romae&quot;
#&quot;De Caesaribus&quot; (for which Aurelius Victor used the &quot;Enmannsche Kaisergeschichte&quot;)
#&quot;Epitome de Caesaribus&quot; (attributed)
The four have generally been published together under the name &quot;Historia Romana&quot;. The second was first printed at Naples about 1472, in 4to, under the name of Pliny the Younger, and the fourth in Strasbourg in 1505. 

The first edition of all four books was that of Andreas Schott (8 volumes, Antwerp, 1579). A recent edition of the &quot;De Caesaribus&quot; is by Pierre Dufraigne (Collection Budé, 1975).

<doc id="367370" wikidata="Q507509" url="?curid=367370" title="Sund, Norway">
<text>Sund is a former municipality in the old Hordaland county in Norway. The municipality existed from 1838 until its dissolution in 2020 when it joined Øygarden Municipality in Vestland county. It was located in the traditional district of Midhordland. The administrative centre of the municipality was the village of Skogsvåg. Other larger villages in Sund included Klokkarvik, Tælavåg, Kausland, and Hammarsland.

Sund covered the southern third of the island of Store Sotra, west of the city of Bergen. It also included many smaller, surrounding islands. Sund was a predominantly rural municipality, with no major settlements, the largest being Hammarsland with approximately 900 inhabitants (in 2013). Due to the proximity to the city of Bergen, a large proportion of the population commuted to the city to work.

Prior to its dissolution in 2020, the municipality is the 381st largest by area out of the 422 municipalities in Norway. Sund is the 149th most populous municipality in Norway with a population of 7,058. The municipality&#x27;s population density is and its population has increased by 24.5% over the last decade.

==General information==
The parish of Sund was established as a formannskapsdistrikt (municipality) on 1 January 1838. It originally included many islands to the southwest of the Bergen Peninsula. On 1 January 1886, the southern archipelago in Sund (population: 2,396) was separated to form the new Austevoll Municipality. This left Sund with 2,112 residents.

On 1 January 2020, the three neighboring municipalities of Fjell, Sund, and Øygarden were merged into one large island municipality called Øygarden.

===Name===
The municipality (originally the parish) is named after the old &quot;Sund&quot; farm () since the first Sund Church was built there. The name is identical to the word which means &quot;strait&quot;, &quot;sound&quot;, or &quot;channel&quot;.

===Coat of arms===
The original coat of arms was granted on 26 April 1966 and they were in use until the new arms were approved on 23 March 1988. The blazon is &quot;Azure, two piles in the point argent issuing from each side of the chief and a lighthouse on an island sable over three bars wavy argent&quot;. This means the arms have a blue field (background) and the charge is a black lighthouse on an island over three wavy lines. There are also two triangle-shapes emitting from the lighthouse. The triangles and wavy lines have a tincture of argent which means they are commonly colored white, but if the arms are made out of metal, then silver is used. The arms were designed to look like a lighthouse on an island in the ocean, emitting light to guide travelers.

A new coat of arms was granted on 23 March 1988 and they were in use until 1 January 2020 when the municipality was dissolved (its successor, Øygarden Municipality, adopted these arms starting on that same day). The official blazon is &quot;Argent, a lighthouse couped azure&quot; (). The arms were designed to replace the old &quot;unofficial&quot; arms (since they did not meet the legal requirements for arms). They were designed to be similar to the old arms while meeting the state requirements. The arms have a field (background) has a tincture of argent which means it is commonly colored white, but if it is made out of metal, then silver is used. The charge is the top of a lighthouse. This design was chosen to symbolize the importance of the sea and the alertness of the local population. The arms were designed by Even Jarl Skoglund. The municipal flag has the same design as the coat of arms. 
===Churches===
The Church of Norway had one parish () within the municipality of Sund. It is part of the Vesthordland prosti (deanery) in the Diocese of Bjørgvin.

==Transport==
The Sotra Bridge, opened in 1971, drastically improved travel to and from Sund and it spurred rapid population growth after ages of stagnancy. Due to the rapidly increasing traffic across the bridge and on the highways of Sotra, the Norwegian Public Roads Administration developed plans in the 2000s for a new bridge and highway between Bergen and Sotra. The plans include a new dual carriageway bridge to replace the Sotra Bridge, and new highways that lead northwards to Øygarden and southwards to Sund.

==History==
On 26 April 1942, after having discovered that two men from the Linge company were being hidden in Telavåg, the Gestapo arrived to arrest the Norwegian officers. Shots were exchanged, and two prominent German Gestapo officers, Johannes Behrens and Henry Bertram, and the Norwegian Arne Værum, were shot dead. Reichskommissar Josef Terboven ordered the Gestapo to retaliate, burning all buildings in the village, executing or sending the men to the Sachsenhausen concentration camp, and imprisoning the women and children for two years. In addition, 18 Norwegian prisoners at a Norwegian internment camp were killed as a reprisal. The event has since become known as the &quot;Telavåg tragedy&quot;, and is sometimes compared to similar World War II atrocities, such as the Lidice massacre, with higher death tolls.

==Population==

==Geography==
Sund covered the southern third of the island of Store Sotra, as well as the many islands that surround it. The largest of the smaller islands are Toftøya, Lerøyna, Bjelkarøyna, Tyssøyna, Risøy, Vardøy, Golten, and Viksøy. In total, the municipality encompassed 466 islands and skerries, which gave it a total coastline of about .

The highest peak in Sund was the tall Førdesveten.

The fjord separating Store Sotra from the mainland, Korsfjorden, was historically the most used sea route into the city of Bergen, and is as much as deep in some places. The treacherous waters in the area mean there has been a continuous need for piloting services, and this tradition is kept alive by the &quot;Viksøy Losstasjon&quot;.

===Climate===
On an average, Sotra experiences of rainfall annually, less than the that the nearby city of Bergen receives. The year-round average temperature is , with the coldest month being February, when the average temperature reaches . The warmest month is August, with an average temperature of .

===Settlements===
There were six urban settlements, as defined by Statistics Norway, within the border of the municipality. The largest is Hammarsland in northern Sund, with 875 inhabitants as of 2013. The others are Tælavåg, Skogsvåg, Klokkarvik, Forland, and Glesnes.

==Government==
During its existence, this municipality was governed by a municipal council of directly elected representatives. The mayor was indirectly elected by a vote of the municipal council.

===Municipal council===
The municipal council of Sund was made up of 21 representatives that are elected to four year terms. The party breakdown of the final municipal council was as follows:

<text>The pyrethrins are a class of organic compounds normally derived from &quot;Chrysanthemum cinerariifolium&quot; that have potent insecticidal activity by targeting the nervous systems of insects. Pyrethrin naturally occurs in chrysanthemum flowers and is often considered an organic insecticide when it is not combined with piperonyl butoxide or other synthetic adjuvants. Their insecticidal and insect-repellent properties have been known and used for thousands of years.

Pyrethrins are gradually replacing organophosphates and organochlorides as the pesticides of choice as the latter compounds have been shown to have significant and persistent toxic effects to humans. They first appeared on markets in the 1900s and have been continually used since then in products such as bug bombs, building insect sprays, and even to spray animals so that they do not get infectious diseases.

==Chemistry==

==History==
The pyrethrins occur in the seed cases of the perennial plant pyrethrum (&quot;Chrysanthemum cinerariaefolium&quot;), which has long been grown commercially to supply the insecticide. Pyrethrins have been used as an insecticide for thousands of years. It is believed that the Chinese crushed chrysanthemum plants and used the powder as an insecticide as early as 1000 BC. It was widely known that the Zhou dynasty in China widely used pyrethrin for its insecticide properties. For centuries, crushed Chrysanthemum flowers have been used in Iran to produce Persian Powder, an insecticide for household use. Pyrethrins were identified as the potent chemical in the Chrysanthemum plants responsible for the insecticidal properties in the crushed flowers around 1800 in Asia. In the Napoleonic Wars, French soldiers used the flowers to keep away fleas and body lice. 

==Biosynthesis==

Well after their use as insecticides began, their chemical structures were determined by Hermann Staudinger and Lavoslav Ružička in 1924. Pyrethrin I (CnH28O3) and pyrethrin II (CnH28O5) are structurally related esters with a cyclopropane core. Pyrethrin I is a derivative of (+)-&quot;trans&quot;-chrysanthemic acid. Pyrethrin II is closely related, but one methyl group is oxidized to a carboxymethyl group, the resulting core being called pyrethric acid. Knowledge of their structures opened the way for the production of synthetic analogues, which are called pyrethroids. Pyrethrins are classified as terpenoids. The key step in the biosynthesis of the naturally occurring pyrethrins involves two molecules of dimethylallyl pyrophosphate, which join to form a cyclopropane ring by the action of the enzyme chrysanthemyl diphosphate synthase.

==Production==

Commercial pyrethrin production mainly takes place in mountainous equatorial zones. The commercial cultivation of the Dalmatian chrysanthemum (&quot;C. cinerariifolium&quot;) takes place at an altitude of 1600 to 3000 meters above sea level. This is done because pyrethrin concentration has been shown to increase as elevation increases to this level. Growing these plants does not require much water because semiarid conditions and a cool winter deliver optimal pyrethrin production. The Persian chrysanthemum &quot;C. coccineum&quot; also produces pyrethrins but at a much lower level. Both may be planted in low-altitude zones in dry soil, but the pyrethrin level is lower.

Pyrethrum extracted of the Persian chrysanthemum (&quot;painted daisy&quot;) was already imported to central Europe from Georgia in the middle of the 19th century.
Most of the world&#x27;s supply of pyrethrin and &quot;C. cinerariaefolium&quot; today comes from Kenya, which produces the most potent flowers. Other countries include Croatia (in Dalmatia) and Japan. The flower was first introduced into Kenya and the highlands of Eastern Africa during the late 1920s. Since the 2000s, Kenya has produced about 70% of the world&#x27;s supply of pyrethrum. A substantial amount of the flowers are cultivated by small-scale farmers who depend on it as a source of income. It is a major source of export income for Kenya and source of over 3,500 additional jobs. About 23,000 tons were harvested in 1975. The active ingredients are extracted with organic solvents to give a concentrate containing the six types of pyrethrins: pyrethrin I, pyrethrin II, cinerin I, cinerin II, jasmolin I, and jasmolin II.

Processing the flowers to cultivate the pyrethrin is often a lengthy process, and one that varies from area to area. For instance, in Japan, the flowers are hung upside down to dry which increases pyrethrin concentration slightly. To process pyrethrin, the flowers must be crushed. The degree to which the flower is crushed has an effect on both the longevity of the pyrethrin usage and the quality. The finer powder produced is better suited for use as an insecticide than the more coarsely crushed flowers. However, the more coarsely crushed flowers have a longer shelf life and deteriorate less.

==Use as an insecticide==
Pyrethrin is most commonly used as an insecticide and has been used for this purpose since the 1900s. In the 1800s, it was known as &quot;Persian powder&quot;, &quot;Persian pellitory&quot;, and &quot;zacherlin&quot;. Pyrethrins delay the closure of voltage-gated sodium channels in the nerve cells of insects, resulting in repeated and extended nerve firings. This hyperexcitation causes the death of the insect due to loss of motor coordination and paralysis. Resistance to pyrethrin has been bypassed by pairing the insecticide with synthetic synergists such as piperonyl butoxide. Together, these two compounds prevent detoxification in the insect, ensuring insect death. Synergists make pyrethrin more effective, allowing lower doses to be effective. Pyrethrins are effective insecticides because they selectively target insects rather than mammals due to higher insect nerve sensitivity, smaller insect body size, lower mammalian skin absorption, and more efficient mammalian hepatic metabolism. Also, mammals are able to process pyrethrin quickly and have higher body temperatures which prevent pyrethrin from working effectively 

Although pyrethrin is a potent insecticide, it also functions as an insect repellent at lower concentrations. Observations in food establishments demonstrate that flies are not immediately killed, but are found more often on windowsills or near doorways. This suggests, due to the low dosage applied, that insects are driven to leave the area before dying. Because of their insecticide and insect repellent effect, pyrethrins have been very successful in reducing insect pest populations that affect humans, crops, livestock, and pets, such as ants, spiders, and lice, as well as potentially disease-carrying mosquitoes, fleas, and ticks.

As pyrethrins and pyrethroids are increasingly being used as insecticides, the number of illnesses and injuries associated with exposure to these chemicals is also increasing. However, few cases leading to serious health effects or mortality in humans have occurred, which is why pyrethroids are labeled &quot;low-toxicity&quot; chemicals and are ubiquitous in home-care products. Pyrethrins are widely regarded as better for the environment, and can be harmless if used only in the field with localized sprays, as UV exposure breaks them down into harmless compounds. Additionally, they have little lasting effect on plants, degrading naturally or being degraded by the cooking process.

Specific pest species that have been successfully controlled by pyrethrum include: potato, beet, grape, and six-spotted leafhopper, cabbage looper, celery leaf tier, Say&#x27;s stink bug, twelve-spotted cucumber beetle, lygus bugs on peaches, grape and flower thrips, and cranberry fruitworm.

==Toxicity==
Pyrethrins are among the safest insecticides on the market due to their rapid degradation in the environment.

Similarities between the chemistry of pyrethrins and synthetic pyrethroids include a similar mode of action and almost identical toxicity to insects (i.e., both pyrethrins and pyrethroids induce a toxic effect within the insect by acting on sodium channels).

Some differences in the chemistry between pyrethrins and synthetic pyrethroids have the result that synthetic pyrethroids have relatively longer environmental persistence than do pyrethrins. Pyrethrins have shorter environmental persistence than synthetic pyrethroids because their chemical structure is more susceptible to the presence of UV light and changes in pH.
The use of pyrethrin in products such as natural insecticides and pet shampoo, for its ability to kill fleas, increases the likelihood of toxicity in mammals that are exposed. Medical cases have emerged showing fatalities from the use of pyrethrin, prompting many organic farmers to cease use. One fatal case of an 11-year-old girl with a known asthmatic condition and who used shampoo containing only a small amount (0.2% pyrethrin) to wash her dog was documented.

===Chronic pyrethrin toxicity in humans===
Chronic toxicity in humans occurs most quickly through respiration into the lungs, or more slowly through absorption through the skin. Allergic reactions may occur after exposure, leading to itching and irritated skin as well as burning sensations. These types of reactions are rare because the allergenic component of pyrethrin in semi-synthetic pyrethroids has been removed. The metabolite compounds of pyrethrin are less toxic to mammals than their originators, and compounds are either broken down in the liver or gastrointestinal tract, or excreted through feces; no evidence of storage in tissues has been found .

=== Pyrethrum toxicity===
Exposure to pyrethrum, the crude form of pyrethrin, causes harmful health effects for mammals. Pyrethrum also has an allergenic effect that commercial pyrethroids don&#x27;t have.
In mammals, toxic exposure to pyrethrum can lead to tongue and lip numbness, drooling, lethargy, muscle tremors, respiratory failure, vomiting, diarrhea, seizures, paralysis, and death.
Exposure to pyrethrum in high levels in humans may cause symptoms such as asthmatic breathing, sneezing, nasal stuffiness, headache, nausea, loss of coordination, tremors, convulsions, facial flushing, and swelling. A possibility of damage to the immune system exists that leads to a worsening of allergies following toxicity. Infants are unable to resourcefully break down pyrethrum due to the ease of skin penetration, causing similar symptoms as adults, but with an increased risk of death.

==Environmental effects==

===Aquatic habitats===
In aquatic settings, toxicity of pyrethrin fluctuates, increasing with rising temperatures, water, and acidity. Run-off after application has become a concern for sediment-dwelling aquatic organisms because pyrethroids can accumulate in these areas. Aquatic life is extremely susceptible to pyrethrin toxicity, and has been documented in species such as the lake trout. Although pyrethrins are quickly metabolized by birds and most mammals, fish and aquatic invertebrates lack the ability to metabolize these compounds, leading to a toxic accumulation of byproducts. To combat the accumulation of pyrethroids in bodies of water, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has introduced two labeling initiatives. The Environmental Hazard and General Labeling for Pyrethroid and Synergized Pyrethrins Non-Agricultural Outdoor Products was revised in 2013 to reduce runoff into bodies of water after use in residential, commercial, institutional, and industrial areas. The Pyrethroid Spray Drift Initiative updated language for labeling all pyrethroid products to be used on agricultural crops. Because of its high toxicity to fish and aquatic invertebrates even at low doses, the EPA recommends alternatives such as pesticide-free methods or alternative chemicals that are less harmful to the surrounding aquatic environment.

==== Terrestrial Habitats ====
Pyrethrin is mainly used on land and can also have impacts in the places that it is used. For instance pyrethrin has the ability to be persistent in the fields that it is sprayed on. This persistence in crops can lead to negative effects for meat production.

===Bees===
Pyrethrins are applied broadly as nonspecific insecticides. Bees have been shown to be particularly sensitive to pyrethrin, with fatal doses as small as 0.02 micrograms. Due to this sensitivity and pollinator decline, pyrethrins are recommended to be applied at night to avoid typical pollinating hours, and in liquid rather than dust form.

<text>Claude Buffier (25 May 1661 – 17 May 1737), French philosopher, historian and teacher, was born in Poland of French parents, who returned to France and settled in Rouen soon after his birth.

He was educated at the Jesuit college there, and he was received into the Order at the age of nineteen. A dispute with the archbishop compelled him to leave Rouen. After a short stay in Rome, he returned to Paris to the college of the Jesuits, where he spent the rest of his life. He seems to have been a good teacher and lucid expositor.

==Works==

His goal in the &quot;Traité des premières vérités&quot; (Paris: 1724), his best-known work, was to discover the ultimate principle of knowledge. This he found in the sense we have of our own existence and of what we feel within ourselves. He thus took substantially the same ground as Descartes, but he rejected the &quot;a priori&quot; method. In order to know what exists distinct from the self, common sense is necessary. Common sense he defined as that disposition which nature has placed in all or most men, in order to enable them, when they have arrived at the age and use of reason, to form a common and uniform judgment with respect to objects different from the internal sentiment of their own perception, which judgment is not the consequence of any anterior judgment.

The truths which this disposition of nature obliges us to accept can be neither proved nor disproved; they are practically followed even by those who reject them speculatively. But Buffier did not claim for these truths of common sense the absolute certainty which characterizes the knowledge we have of our own existence or the logical deductions we make from our thoughts; they possess merely the highest probability, and the man who rejects them is to be considered a fool, though he is not guilty of a contradiction.

Buffier&#x27;s aversion to scholastic refinements gives to his writings an appearance of shallowness and want of metaphysical insight, and unquestionably he failed entirely even to indicate the nature of that universality and necessity which he ascribed to his common verities; he was, however, one of the earliest to recognize the psychological as distinguished from the metaphysical side of Descartes&#x27;s principle, and to use it, with no inconsiderable skill, as the basis of an analysis of the human mind, similar to that enjoined by Locke. In this he has anticipated Thomas Reid and the Scottish school. Voltaire described him as the only Jesuit who has given a reasonable system of philosophy.

He also wrote &quot;Elémens de métaphysique&quot; (1725), &quot;Suite de la Grammaire française sur un plan nouveau&quot; (1709) [&quot;Sequel to A New Method of French Grammar&quot;], and a number of historical essays. Most of his works appeared in a collected form in 1732, and an English translation of the &quot;Traité&quot; was published in 1780.

<doc id="367376" wikidata="Q3292858" url="?curid=367376" title="Maria Weston Chapman">
<text>Maria Weston Chapman (July 25, 1806 – July 12, 1885) was an American abolitionist. She was elected to the executive committee of the American Anti-Slavery Society in 1839 and from 1839 until 1842, she served as editor of the anti-slavery journal &quot;The Non-Resistant&quot;.

==Early life==

Maria Weston was born in 1806 in Weymouth, Massachusetts to Captain Warren Richard Weston and Anne (née Bates) Weston. Eventually she had seven younger siblings—five sisters and two brothers. Though the Westons were not wealthy, they were well connected through her uncle&#x27;s patronage. She spent several years of her youth living with family in England, where she received a robust education.

Weston returned to Boston in 1828 to serve as principal of a newly-founded, socially-progressive girls&#x27; high school. She left the field of education two years later to marry.

==Abolitionism==

Maria and her husband Henry were both &quot;Garrisonian&quot; abolitionists, meaning that they believed in an &quot;immediate&quot; and uncompromising end to slavery, brought about by &quot;moral suasion&quot; or non-resistance. They rejected all political and institutional coercion—including churches, political parties and the federal government—as agencies for ending slavery. They did, however, support moral coercion that encompassed &quot;come-outerism&quot; and disunion, both of which opposed association with slaveholders. Gerald Sorin writes, &quot;In [Maria&#x27;s] nonresistance principles and in her &#x27;come-outerism,&#x27; she was rigidly dogmatic and self-righteous, believing that &#x27;when one is perfectly right, one neither asks nor needs sympathy.&#x27;&quot;

===Anti-slavery work===
Though Chapman came to the anti-slavery cause through her husband&#x27;s family, she quickly and stalwartly took up the cause, enduring pro-slavery mobs, social ridicule, and public attacks on her character. Her sisters, notably Caroline and Anne, were also active abolitionists, though Maria is generally considered to be the most outspoken and active among her family. According to Lee V. Chambers, through their &quot;kin-work&quot;, the sisters supported each other through family responsibilities in order to take their active public roles. The Chapmans became central figures in the &quot;Boston Clique,&quot; which primarily consisted of wealthy and socially prominent supporters of William Lloyd Garrison.
In 1835, Chapman assumed the leadership of the Boston Anti-Slavery Bazaar, which had been founded the previous year by Lydia Maria Child and Louisa Loring as a major fundraising event. She directed the fair until 1858, when she unilaterally decided to replace the bazaar with the Anti-Slavery Subscription Anniversary. Chapman said that the fair had become &quot;passé&quot;; she argued that the Anniversary—an exclusive, invitation-only &quot;soirée&quot; featuring music, food and speeches—was more &quot;au courant&quot; and would raise more funds than the bazaar. As described by historian Benjamin Quarles, through these years Chapman and other abolitionists became experienced in using &quot;all the refined techniques of solicitation&quot; in their fundraising for the cause of abolitionism.

In addition to her fair work, between 1835 and 1865, Chapman served on the executive and business committees of the Massachusetts Anti-Slavery Society (MASS), the New England Anti-Slavery Society (NEASS) and the American Anti-Slavery Society (AASS). Through these she was active in the petition campaigns of the 1830s. She wrote the annual reports of the Boston Female Anti-Slavery Society (BFASS) and published tracts to raise public awareness.

For nearly 20 years, between 1839 and 1858, Chapman edited &quot;The Liberty Bell&quot;, an annual anti-slavery gift book sold at the Boston Bazaar as part of fundraising. The giftbook was composed of contributions from various notable figures: Longfellow, Emerson, Elizabeth Barrett Browning, Harriet Martineau, and Bayard Taylor, among others, none of whom was paid for their contributions aside from a copy of &quot;The Liberty Bell&quot;. She also served as editor to &quot;The Liberator&quot; in Garrison&#x27;s absence, and was on the editorial committee of the &quot;National Anti-Slavery Standard&quot;, the official mouthpiece of the AASS. Chapman was also a member of the peace organisation, the Non-Resistance Society, which published &quot;The Non-Resistant&quot;.

Chapman was a prolific writer in her own right, publishing &quot;Right and Wrong in Massachusetts&quot; in 1839 and &quot;How Can I Help to Abolish Slavery?&quot; in 1855. Aside from these works, she published her poems and essays in abolitionist periodicals. In 1840 divisions between Garrisonians and the more political wing of the anti-slavery movement split the AASS and correspondingly the BFASS into two opposing factions. Maria, nicknamed &quot;Captain Chapman&quot; and the &quot;great goddess&quot; by her opponents and &quot;Lady Macbeth&quot; even by her friends, outmaneuvered the opposition. She took control of a resurrected BFASS, which from then on mainly focused on organizing the Boston bazaar as a major fundraiser for abolitionism.

The church she attended, Federal Street Church, Unitarian, is featured on the Boston Women&#x27;s Heritage Trail.

===Travels===
Throughout her three decades of involvement in the anti-slavery movement, Chapman spent considerable amounts of time outside of the United States, first in Haiti (1841-1842) and later in Paris (1848-1855). In spite of her prolonged absences, she still figured centrally in the Boston movement generally and the Boston bazaar particularly. While abroad, she tenaciously solicited support and contributions for the Boston fairs from elite members of British and European society, such as Lady Byron, Harriet Martineau, Alexis de Tocqueville, Victor Hugo, and Alphonse de Lamartine.

When she returned to the U.S. in 1855, &quot;Bloody Kansas&quot; and the rise of the Republican Party brought the issue of slavery to the centre of national debate. It was in this period that Chapman began to manifestly deviate from Garrisonian ideolog, by endorsing the Republican party and later by supporting both the American Civil War and Abraham Lincoln&#x27;s proposal in 1862 for gradual compensated slave emancipation. Unlike many Garrisonians such as Garrison himself, Chapman gave no indication of being conflicted between the principle of non-coercion and the Civil War&#x27;s objective of abolishing slavery through violent force. Characteristically, Chapman was as resolute and unapologetic in her new beliefs as she had been in her old. Yet, in spite of her newly-expressed confidence in the state, Chapman seemingly felt little responsibility to former slaves once they had been freed.

==Personal life==

In 1830, Henry Grafton Chapman (1804–1842), a second-generation abolitionist and wealthy Boston merchant; his parents were enthusiastic abolitionists. By all accounts, the Chapmans had a good marriage that was free from ideological and financial strain. During their 12-year marriage, which ended in Henry&#x27;s death from tuberculosis in 1842, they had four children, one of whom died in early childhood, including:

* Henry Grafton Chapman Jr. (1833–1883), who married Eleanor Kingsland Jay (1839–1921), the daughter of John Jay, the U.S. Minister to Austria-Hungary, granddaughter of William Jay and great-granddaughter of John Jay, Chief Justice of the United States Supreme Court.

In 1863, except for a passing interest in the AASS, Chapman retired from public life, and for the next two decades, until her death in Weymouth on July 12, 1885, she &quot;savored the perceived success of her cause and, equally, her own role in the victory.&quot;

<doc id="367384" wikidata="Q763533" url="?curid=367384" title="Pervigilium Veneris">
<text>Pervigilium Veneris (or The Vigil of Venus) is a Latin poem of uncertain date, variously assigned to the 2nd, 4th or 5th centuries.

It is sometimes thought to have been by the poet Tiberianus, because of strong similarities with his poem &quot;Amnis ibat&quot;, though other scholars attribute it to Publius Annius Florus, and yet others find no sufficient evidence for any attribution. It was written professedly in early spring on the eve of a three-night festival of Venus (probably April 1–3) in a setting that seems to be Sicily. The poem describes the annual awakening of the vegetable and animal world through the &quot;benign post-Lucretian&quot; goddess, which contrasts with the tragic isolation of the silent &quot;I&quot; of the poet/speaker, against the desolate background of a ruined city, a vision that prompts Andrea Cucchiarelli to note the resemblance of the poem&#x27;s construction to the cruelty of a dream. It is notable for its Romanticism which marks a transition between Classical Roman poetry and medieval poetry. It consists of ninety-three verses in trochaic septenarius, and is divided into strophes of unequal length by the refrain:

==The ending==
The poem ends with the nightingale&#x27;s song, and a poignant expression of personal sorrow:

The nightingale and swallow motif refers to the myth of the two sisters Philomela and Procne, one of whom was turned into a nightingale and the other into a swallow. In the myth, Procne was unable to speak, having had her tongue cut out; but when she was transformed into a swallow, she found her voice again.

The words were famously quoted by T. S. Eliot in the ending of his poem &quot;The Waste Land&quot;.

The reference at the end is to a legend that the people of Amyclae, a town near Sparta, made a law that no one was to speak of the Spartans&#x27; approach; so that when the Spartans came to attack the city in the 8th century BC, no one gave a warning; hence the proverb (&quot;more unwilling to speak than Amyclae itself&quot;).

==English verse translations==
There are translations into English verse by the 17th-century poet Thomas Stanley (1651); by the 18th-century &quot;graveyard school&quot; poet Thomas Parnell (1679-1718); by Sir Arthur Quiller-Couch in &quot;The Vigil of Venus and Other Poems by &quot;Q&quot;&quot;; by F.

This new edition, with Latin text based largely on Shackelton Bailey, includes a brief anthology of commentary – from Voltaire to contemporary criticism (pp. 51–60) and an up-to-date bibliography (pp. 61–72). There is also an appendix (pp. 155–65) of texts and Italian translations of some of the most famous poems of late antiquity devoted to the theme of the rose – many from the so-called &quot;Latin Anthology&quot;, a collection of poems from the imperial age thought to have been assembled at Carthage &quot;during the cultural renaissance of Vandalic Africa in the 5th century CE. This appendix highlights the vitality of the rose topos and of the symbolism associated with it, which spread from the ancient world into European literature of all ages, and it offers the reader a welcome opportunity for reading and appreciating, this time in an Italian translation, a series of poems scarcely studied or known.&quot;

==Influence==
John Fowles&#x27; &quot;The Magus&quot; ends indeterminately with the vigil&#x27;s refrain, a passage to which he often directed readers wishing greater clarity about the novel&#x27;s conclusion.

<text>GVB is the municipal public transport operator for Amsterdam, the capital of the Netherlands, operating metro, tram, bus and ferry services in the metropolitan area of Amsterdam.

==History==
The forerunner of the GVB, the &quot;Gemeentetram Amsterdam&quot; (GTA) (Amsterdam Municipal Tramway), was established on 1 January 1900 by the city after it acquired a number of private companies. The first electric tram ran on 14 August 1900. In 1925, the GTA introduced its first bus line. In 1943, Gemeentetram merged with Gemeenteveren Amsterdam (established in 1897), the municipal ferry company, to form Gemeente Vervoerbedrijf Amsterdam (; ). In 1977, the first metro line was introduced.

By 2002, the organization was simply called GVB. In 2007, the GVB became a private corporation under the name GVB Activa B.V., wholly owned by the City of Amsterdam; previously, the GVB was part of the City Of Amsterdam. Between 2006 and 2016, Stadsregio Amsterdam was the authority responsible for all public transport in the greater Amsterdam area; it granted a concession (contract) to the GVB to provide public transport services. In 2010, Stadsregio Amsterdam extended the concession of the GVB for the period 2012–2017, and at the end of 2013, further extended it until 2024. On 1 January 2017, Vervoerregio Amsterdam replaced Stadsregio Amsterdam as the public transport authority for the greater Amsterdam area.

==Network==
The GVB operates a number of public transportation networks in and around the city of Amsterdam, including:
* 5 metro lines, partly elevated, no level crossings.
* 14 tram routes, on street, partly mixed with all other traffic, partly on lanes shared with buses and taxis, and partly on separate lanes.
* 46 bus routes; buses often mix with other traffic, but sometimes on lanes shared with trams and taxis, or for buses only.
* 10 Ferry routes across the IJ; at least one is frequent, operating 24 hours a day, free of charge.

The newest metro line is the North/South line, which was opened on 22 July 2018.

==Metro==

Until 3 March 2019, line 51 to Amstelveen was a metro service between Central Station and Station Zuid. At Station Zuid it switched from third rail to pantograph and catenary wires. From there to Amstelveen Centrum it shared its track with tram line 5. The light rail vehicles on this line were capable of using both 600V (overhead) and 750V DC (third rail) power supplies.

==Buses==

, GVB bus services had 22 regular daytime routes (numbered between 15–68), 8 rush-hour routes (200-series route numbers), 11 night routes (numbered as &quot;N&quot; plus two digits) of which just 2 routes run seven days a week. One route (369) runs between Schiphol Airport and Sloterdijk station (railway and metro connections).
 Three routes (461, 463, 464) offer free rides to the Gelderlandplein shopping centre in the Buitenveldert neighbourhood of Amsterdam.

, there were 233 buses in the fleet of which 31 were electric.

The busiest bus route as of 2017, is bus route 21, running every 8 minutes or less, seven days a week.

=== Bus routes ===

===Night bus routes===

These routes operate as a hub and spoke model. Hours of operation are extended longer on Saturday and Sunday mornings due to a later start of service for daytime routes.

==Ferries==

Since 1 July 2013, GVB Veren (&quot;veren&quot; meaning ferries) has been operating ferry services crossing both the IJ and the North Sea Canal on behalf of the City of Amsterdam. Most of these ferries offer free rides for pedestrians and cyclists. Within the City of Amsterdam, there are seven ferry routes across the IJ, two of which operate overnight. Outside of Amsterdam, the GVB operates three ferry routes across the North Sea Canal at Zaandam, Velsen and Assendelft. The GVB has 19 ferry boats servicing these routes, and is replacing diesel-powered ferries with electrically-operated vessels. The ferries have a maximum speed of .

Ferry routes crossing the IJ are:
* F1: Azartplein to Zamenhofstraat
* F2: Central Station to IJplein
* F3: Central Station to Buiksloterweg (24/7 with a 12-minute frequency between 12:00am and 6:24am)
* F4: Central Station to NDSM
* F5: Central Station to NDSM via Pontsteiger
* F6: Pontsteiger to Distelweg
* F7: Pontsteiger to NDSM
* F9: Zeeburgereiland to Sporenburg

Ferry routes crossing the North Sea Canal are:
* F20 Hempontplein to Zaandam
* F21 Spaarndam to Assendelft (24/7)
* F22 Velsen Zuid to Velsen Noord (24/7)

==Ticketing==
The Amsterdam public transport network falls under the National Tariff System of the Netherlands and the GVB has a few of its own tickets, notably the 24-, 48- and 72- hour tickets. The electronic OV-chipkaart has been the only ticketing system valid in the Amsterdam metro since the summer of 2009, and in the rest of the network (tram, bus) since June 2010. Most trams carry conductors, but as they no longer stamp passengers&#x27; &quot;strippenkaarten&quot; their role has been deskilled; it now consists in ensuring security along with selling the occasional &quot;OV-chipkaart&quot; and optionally announcing the stops.

<doc id="367399" wikidata="Q412424" url="?curid=367399" title="Safrole">
<text>Safrole is an organic compound with the formula CH2O2C6H3CH2CH=CH2. It is a colorless oily liquid, although impure samples can appear yellow. A member of the phenylpropanoid family of natural products, it is found in sassafras plants, among others. Small amounts are found in a wide variety of plants, where it functions as a natural antifeedant. &quot;Ocotea pretiosa&quot;, which grows in Brazil, and &quot;Sassafras albidum&quot;, which grows in eastern North America, are the main natural sources of safrole. It has a characteristic &quot;sweet-shop&quot; aroma.

It is a precursor in the synthesis of the insecticide synergist piperonyl butoxide, the fragrance piperonal via isosafrole, and the empathogenic/entactogenic substance MDMA.

== History ==
Safrole was obtained from a number of plants, but especially from the sassafras tree (&quot;Sassafras albidum&quot;), which is native to North America, and from Japanese star anise (&quot;Illicium anisatum&quot;, called &quot;shikimi&quot; in Japan). In 1844, the French chemist Édouard Saint-Èvre (1817–1879) determined safrole&#x27;s [[empirical formula]. In 1869, the French chemists [[Édouard Grimaux]] (1835–1900) and J. Ruotte investigated and named safrole. They observed its reaction with bromine, suggesting the presence of an [[allyl group]]. By 1884, the German chemist [[Theodor Poleck]] (1821–1906) suggested that safrole was a derivative of [[benzene]], to which two oxygen atoms were joined as [[epoxide]]s (cyclic ethers).

In 1885, the Dutch chemist [[Johann Frederik Eijkman]] (1851–1915) investigated shikimol, the essential oil that is obtained from Japanese star anise, and he found that, upon oxidation, shikimol formed piperonylic acid, whose basic structure had been determined in 1871 by the German chemist [[Wilhelm Rudolph Fittig]] (1835–1910) and his student, the American chemist [[Ira Remsen]] (1846–1927). Thus Eijkman inferred the correct basic structure for shikimol. He also noted that shikimol and safrole had the same empirical formula and had other similar properties, and thus he suggested that they were probably identical. In 1886, Poleck showed that upon oxidation, safrole also formed piperonylic acid, and thus shikimol and safrole were indeed identical. It remained to be determined whether the molecule&#x27;s C3H5 group was a [[propenyl|propenyl group]] (R−CH=CH−CH3) or an [[allyl group]] (R−CH2−CH=CH2). In 1888, the German chemist Julius Wilhelm Brühl (1850–1911) determined that the C3H5 group was an allyl group.

== Natural occurrence ==
Safrole is the principal component of brown [[camphor]] oil made from &quot;[[Ocotea pretiosa]]&quot;, a plant growing in [[Brazil]], and sassafras oil made from &quot;[[Sassafras albidum]]&quot;.

In the United States, commercially available [[Sassafras albidum#Safrole oil, aromatic uses, MDMA|culinary sassafras oil]] is usually devoid of safrole due to a rule passed by the U.S. FDA in 1960.

Safrole can be obtained through natural [[Extraction (chemistry)|extraction]] from &quot;[[Sassafras albidum]]&quot; and &quot;[[Ocotea cymbarum]]&quot;. Sassafras oil for example is obtained by [[steam distillation]] of the root bark of the sassafras tree. The resulting steam distilled product contains about 90% safrole by weight. The oil is dried by mixing it with a small amount of [[Calcium chloride|anhydrous calcium chloride]]. After filtering-off the calcium chloride, the oil is vacuum distilled at 100 °C under a vacuum of or frozen to crystallize the safrole out. This technique works with other oils in which safrole is present as well.

Safrole is typically extracted from the root-bark or the fruit of &quot;[[Sassafras albidum]]&quot; (native to eastern North America) in the form of sassafras oil, or from &quot;[[Ocotea odorifera]]&quot;, a Brazilian species. Safrole is also present in certain essentials oils and in brown [[Camphor|camphor oil]], which is present in small amounts in many plants. Safrole can be found in [[anise]], [[nutmeg]], [[cinnamon]], and [[black pepper]]. Safrole can be detected in undiluted liquid beverages and pharmaceutical preparations by [[high-performance liquid chromatography]].

== Applications ==

Safrole is a member of the methylenedioxybenzene group, of which many compounds are used as [[insecticide]] synergists; for example, safrole is used as a precursor in the synthesis of the insecticide [[piperonyl butoxide]]. Safrole is also used as a precursor in the synthesis of the drug [[ecstasy (drug)|ecstasy]] ([[MDMA]], 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine). Before safrole was banned by the [[Food and Drugs Administration|US FDA]] in 1960 for use in food, it was used as a [[Artificial flavor|food flavor]] for its characteristic &#x27;candy-shop&#x27; aroma. It was used as an additive in [[root beer]], [[chewing gum]], [[toothpaste]], [[soap]]s, and certain pharmaceutical preparations.

Safrole exhibits [[Antibiotics|antibiotic]] and [[Angiogenesis inhibitor|anti-angiogenic]] functions.

== Synthesis ==
It can be synthesized from [[catechol]] first by conversion to methylenedioxybenzene, which is brominated and coupled with [[allyl bromide]].

Safrole is a versatile precursor to many compounds. Examples are &quot;N&quot;-acylarylhydrazones, isosters, aryl-sulfonamide derivatives, acidic sulfonylhydrazone derivatives, benzothiazine derivatives. and many more.

==Isosafrole==

Isosafrole is produced synthetically from safrole. It is not found in nature. Isosafrole comes in two forms, &quot;trans&quot;-isosafrole and &quot;cis&quot;-isosafrole. Isosafrole is used as a precursor for the psychoactive drug [[MDMA]] (ecstasy). When safrole is metabolized several metabolites can be identified. Some of these metabolites have been shown to exhibit toxicological effects, such as 1′-hydroxysafrole and 3′-hydroxysafrole in rats. Further metabolites of safrole that have been found in urine of both rats and humans include 1,2-dihydroxy-4-allylbenzene or 1(2)-methoxy-2(1)hydroxy-4-allylbenzene.

== Metabolism ==
Safrole can undergo many forms of metabolism. The two major routes are the oxidation of the [[allyl]] side chain and the oxidation of the methylenedioxy group. The oxidation of the allyl side chain is mediated by a [[cytochrome P450]] complex, which will transform safrole into 1′-hydroxysafrole. The newly formed 1′-hydroxysafrole will undergo a phase II [[drug metabolism]] reaction with a [[sulfotransferase]] enzyme to create 1′-sulfoxysafrole, which can cause [[DNA adducts]]. A different oxidation pathway of the allyl side chain can form [[safrole epoxide]]. So far, this has only been found in rats and guinea pigs. The formed epoxide is a small metabolite due to the slow formation and further metabolism of the compound. An [[epoxide hydratase]] enzyme will act on the epoxide to form dihydrodiol, which can be secreted in urine.

The metabolism of safrole through the oxidation of the methylenedioxy proceeds via the cleavage of the methylenedioxy group. This results in two major metabolites: [[allylcatechol]] and its isomer, [[propenylcatechol]]. [[Eugenol]] is a minor metabolite of safrole in humans, mice, and rats. The intact allyl side chain of allylcatechol may then be oxidized to yield 2′,3′-epoxypropylcatechol. This can serve as a substrate for an epoxide hydratase enzyme, and will hydrate the 2′,3′-epoxypropylcatechol to 2′,3′-dihydroxypropylcatechol. This new compound can be oxidized to form [[propionic acid]] (PPA), which is a substance that is related to an increase in oxidative stress and [[Glutathione S-transferase|glutathione &quot;S&quot;-transferase]] activity. PPA also causes a decrease in glutathione and [[Glutathione peroxidase]] activity. The epoxide of allylcatechol may also be generated from the cleavage of the methylenedioxy group of the safrole epoxide. The cleavage of the methylenedioxy ring and the metabolism of the allyl group involve hepatic microsomal mixed-function oxidases.

==Toxicity==
Toxicological studies have shown that safrole is a weak [[Hepatocellular carcinoma|hepatocarcinogen]] at higher doses in rats and mice. Safrole requires metabolic activation before exhibiting toxicological effects. [[Metabolism|Metabolic]] conversion of the [[allyl group]] in safrole is able to produce intermediates which are directly capable of binding covalently with [[DNA]] and [[protein]]s. Metabolism of the [[methylenedioxy]] group to a [[carbene]] allows the molecule to form [[Ligand (biochemistry)|ligand complexes]] with [[cytochrome P450]] and [[cytochrome P448|P448]]. The formation of this complex leads to lower amounts of available free cytochrome P450. Safrole can also directly bind to cytochrome P450, leading to [[competitive inhibition]]. These two mechanisms result in lowered mixed function [[oxidase]] activity.

Furthermore, because of the altered structural and functional properties of cytochrome P450, loss of [[ribosome]]s which are attached to the [[Endoplasmic reticulum|endoplasmatic reticulum]] through cytochrome P450 may occur. The allyl group thus directly contributes to [[mutagen]]icity, while the methylenedioxy group is associated with changes in the cytochrome P450 system and epigenetic aspects of carcinogenicity. In rats, safrole and related compounds produced both benign and malignant [[tumor]]s after intake through the mouth. Changes in the liver are also observed through the enlargement of [[liver cell]]s and [[cell death]].

In the [[United States]], it was once widely used as a food additive in [[root beer]], sassafras tea, and other common goods, but was banned for human consumption by the [[Food and Drug Administration|FDA]] after studies in the 1960s suggested that safrole was [[carcinogenic]], causing permanent liver damage in rats; food products sold there purporting to contain sassafras instead contain a safrole-free sassafras extract. Safrole is also banned for use in [[soap]] and [[perfume]]s by the [[International Fragrance Association]].

According to a 1977 study of the metabolites of safrole in both rats and humans, two carcinogenic metabolites of safrole found in the urine of rats, 1′-hydroxysafrole and 3′-hydroxyisosafrole, were not found in human urine. The European Commission on Health and consumer protection assumes safrole to be genotoxic and carcinogenic. It occurs naturally in a variety of spices, such as [[cinnamon]], [[nutmeg]], and [[black pepper]], and herbs such as [[basil]]. In that role, safrole, like many naturally-occurring compounds, may have a small but measurable ability to induce cancer in rodents. Despite this, the effects in humans were estimated by the [[Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory]] to be similar to risks posed by breathing indoor air or drinking municipally supplied water.

== Adverse effects ==
Besides being a hepatocarcinogen, safrole exhibits further adverse effects in that it will induce the formation of hepatic lipid hydroperoxides. Safrole also inhibits the defensive function of [[neutrophil]]s against bacteria. In addition to the inhibition of the defensive function of neutrophils, it has also been discovered that safrole interferes with the formation of superoxides by neutrophils. Furthermore, safrole oxide, a metabolite of safrole, has a negative effect on the [[central nervous system]]. Safrole oxide inhibits the expression of integrin β4/SOD, which leads to [[apoptosis]] of the [[nerve cell]]s.

==Use in MDMA manufacture==

Safrole is listed as a Table I [[Precursor (chemistry)|precursor]] under the [[United Nations Convention Against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances]].
Due to their role in the manufacture of [[MDMA]], safrole, [[isosafrole]], and [[piperonal]] are Category I precursors under regulation no. 273/2004 of the [[European Community]]. In the United States, safrole is currently a [[DEA list of chemicals|List I chemical]].

The root bark of American [[sassafras]] contains a low percentage of steam-volatile oil, which is typically 75% safrole. Attempts to refine safrole from sassafras bark in mass quantities are generally not economically viable due to low yield and high effort. However, smaller quantities can be extracted quite easily via [[steam distillation]] (about 10% of dry sassafras root bark by mass, or about 2% of fresh bark). Demand for safrole is causing rapid and illicit harvesting of the &quot;[[Cinnamomum parthenoxylon]]&quot; tree in [[Southeast Asia]], in particular the [[Cardamom Mountains]] in [[Cambodia]]. However, it is not clear what proportion of illicitly harvested safrole is going toward MDMA production, as over 90% of the global safrole supply (about per year) is used to manufacture pesticides, fragrances, and other chemicals. Sustainable harvesting of safrole is possible from leaves and stems of certain plants, including the roots of camphor seedlings.

<text>The Lena is a river in the Russian Far East and is the easternmost river of the three great rivers of Siberia, including the Ob River and the Yenisey River, which flow into the Arctic Ocean. The Lena river is long and has a capacious drainage basin of ; thus the Lena is the eleventh-longest river in the world and the longest river entirely within Russia. Geographically, permafrost is the type of soil that underlies most of the Lena River&#x27;s catchment, twenty per cent (20%) of which is continuous.

==Course==
The Lena originates at of elevation in the Baikal Mountains, west of Lake Baikal, south of the Central Siberian Plateau. The Lena flows north-east and traverses the Lena-Angara Plateau, then is joined by three tributary rivers: (i) the Kirenga, (ii) the Vitim, and (iii) the Olyokma. From Yakutsk, the Lena River enters the Central Yakutian Lowland and flows north until joined by the eastern tributary, the Aldan River, and the western tributary, the Vilyuy River. Afterwards, the Lena bends westwards and northwards, flowing between the mountains of the Kharaulakh Range to the east (part of the Verkhoyansk Range) and the mountains of the Chekanovsky Ridge to the west. Travelling approximately due north, the Lena widens into a great river delta that merges into the Laptev Sea, a marginal region of the Arctic Ocean, south-west of the New Siberian Islands. The Lena Delta is in area, being traversed by seven main branches, the most important being the Bykovsky channel, farthest east.
The Lena is navigable over a length of 3540 kilometres. The annual navigation period, when ice is minimally present or absent, lasts about 70 days in the estuarine region and 125 days elsewhere.

==Basin==
The area of the Lena River basin is calculated at and the mean annual discharge is 489 cubic kilometers per year. Gold is washed out of the sands of the Vitim and the Olyokma, and mammoth tusks have been dug out of the delta. There are numerous lakes in the floodplain of the river. Lakes Nedzheli and Ulakhan-Kyuel are the largest in the basin of the Lena.

===Tributaries===
The Kirenga flows north between the upper Lena River and Lake Baikal. The Vitim drains the area northeast of Lake Baikal. The Olyokma flows north. The Amga makes a long curve southeast and parallel to the Lena and flows into the Aldan. The Aldan also curves roughly parallel to the Lena until it turns east and flows into the Lena north of Yakutsk. The Maya, a tributary of the Aldan, drains an area almost to the Sea of Okhotsk. The T-shaped Chona-Vilyuy system drains most of the area to the west.

The main tributaries of the Lena are, from source to mouth:

* Tutura (right)
* Ilga (left)
* Kuta (left)

==History==
It is commonly believed that the Lena derives its name from the original Even-Evenk name &quot;Elyu-Ene&quot;, which means &quot;the Large River&quot;.

According to folktales related a century later, in the years 1620–1623 a party of Russian fur hunters under the leadership of Demid Pyanda sailed up Nizhnyaya Tunguska, discovered the Lena, and either carried their boats there or built new ones. In 1623 Pyanda explored some of the river from its upper reaches to the central Yakutia. In 1628 Vasily Bugor and 10 men reached the Lena, collected &#x27;yasak&#x27; (tribute) from the &#x27;natives&#x27; and then founded Kirinsk in 1632. In 1631 the &quot;voyevoda&quot; of Yeniseysk sent Pyotr Beketov and 20 men to construct a fortress at Yakutsk (founded in 1632). From Yakutsk other expeditions spread out to the south and east. The Lena delta was reached in 1655.

Two of the three groups of survivors of the ill-fated Jeannette expedition reached Lena Delta in September, 1881. The one led by engineer George W. Melville was rescued by native Tungus huntsmen. Of the group led by Captain George W. De Long, only two of the men survived; the others died of starvation.

Baron Eduard Von Toll, accompanied by Alexander von Bunge, led an expedition that explored the Lena delta and the islands of New Siberia on behalf of the Russian Imperial Academy of Sciences in 1885. In 1886 they investigated the New Siberian Islands and the Yana River and its tributaries. During one year and two days the expedition covered , of which were up rivers, carrying out geodesic surveys en route.

The Lena massacre was the name given to the 1912 shooting-down of striking goldminers and local citizens who protested at the working conditions in the mine near Bodaybo in northern Irkutsk. The incident was reported in the Duma (parliament) by Kerensky and is credited with stimulating revolutionary feeling in Russia.

Vladimir Ilyich Ulyanov, when he was exiled to the Central Siberian Plateau, may have taken his alias, &quot;Lenin&quot;, from the Lena River.

==Delta==
At the end of the Lena River there is a large delta that extends into the Laptev Sea and is about wide. The delta is frozen tundra for about seven months of the year, but in May the region is transformed into a lush wetland for a few months. Part of the area is protected as the Lena Delta Wildlife Reserve. Fyodor Matisen mapped the delta.

The Lena Delta divides into a multitude of flat islands. The most important are (from west to east): Chychas Aryta, Petrushka, Sagastyr, Samakh Ary Diyete, Turkan Bel&#x27;keydere, Sasyllakh Ary, Kolkhoztakh Bel&#x27;keydere, Grigoriy Diyelyakh Bel&#x27;kee (Grigoriy Islands), Nerpa Uolun Aryta, Misha Bel&#x27;keydere, Atakhtay Bel&#x27;kedere, Arangastakh, Urdiuk Pastakh Bel&#x27;key, Agys Past&#x27; Aryta, Dallalakh Island, Otto Ary, Ullakhan Ary and Orto Ues Aryta.

Turukannakh-Kumaga is a long and narrow island off the Lena Delta&#x27;s western shore.

One of the Lena delta islands, Ostrov Amerika-Kuba-Aryta or Ostrov Kuba-Aryta, was named after the island of Cuba during Soviet times. It is on the northern edge of the delta.

==Fish==
As Lena is located at remote and undeveloped regions of the Russian Far East, its fish resource is very well preserved. Some of the species found in the river include: Siberian taimen, Siberian sturgeon, Upper Yenisei grayling.

<text>Leighton Buzzard ( ) is a market town in Bedfordshire, England, in the southwest of the county and close to the Buckinghamshire border. It lies between Aylesbury, Tring, Luton/Dunstable and Milton Keynes, near the Chiltern Hills.

It is northwest of Central London and linked to the capital by the Grand Union Canal and the West Coast Main Line. The built-up area extends on either side of the River Ouzel (here about 2 metres wide) to include its historically separate neighbour Linslade, and is administered by Leighton-Linslade Town Council.

==History==
===Foundation and development===

It is unclear when the town was initially founded, although some historians believe that there may have been settlement in the area from as early as 571. There are a number of theories concerning the derivation of the town&#x27;s name: ‘Leighton’ came from Old English &quot;Lēah-tūn&quot;, meaning &#x27;farm in a clearing in the woods&#x27;, and one version of the addition of ‘Buzzard’ was that it was added by the Dean of Lincoln, in whose diocese the town lay in the 12th century, from &quot;Beau-desert&quot;. Another version is that having two communities called ‘Leighton’ and seeking some means of differentiating them the Dean added the name of his local Prebendary or representative to that of the town. At that time it was Theobald de Busar and so over the years the town became known as Leighton Buzzard. The other Leighton became Leighton Bromswold. In the Domesday Book of 1086, Leighton Buzzard and Linslade were both called Leestone.
A further variation may be seen in a legal record of 1424, where &quot;William Dagenale of Leytun Busherd, Beds&quot; appears as a defendant.

Leighton Buzzard developed into a thriving market town supported by good road, canal and, later, rail links to the agricultural hinterland and London. The town&#x27;s market charter was granted in 1086 and is still active today. The High Street has numerous historical buildings, more than 70 of which are listed. They include the notable Bank Building on the Market Square (now home to Barclays Bank), designed by the eminent architect Alfred Waterhouse, designer of London&#x27;s Natural History Museum, London. They also include the Old Town Hall, later used as a fire station and now as a restaurant.

===Relationship to Linslade===
The Grand Junction Canal opened in 1800. It skirted the western edge of the town, but lay just over the parish and county boundary (the River Ouzel), being in the neighbouring parish of Linslade in Buckinghamshire. The London and Birmingham Railway was built in the 1830s and passed just over half a mile west of the centre of Leighton Buzzard; Leighton railway station opened with the line in 1838. Although named after Leighton Buzzard, the station (like the canal) was actually in the parish of Linslade. When built, the station was in open countryside, with Linslade village lying north of the station at what is now known as Old Linslade. New development was subsequently laid out between the station and the canal, known initially as Chelsea or New Linslade, before assuming the name Linslade.

Linslade has always had Leighton Buzzard postal addresses, forming part of the Leighton Buzzard post town. Linslade remained administratively separate from Leighton Buzzard until 1965, when it was transferred from Buckinghamshire to Bedfordshire, and the urban districts of Leighton Buzzard and Linslade merged into a single Leighton-Linslade Urban District. The Office for National Statistics uses the name Leighton Buzzard for the whole built-up area, including Linslade.

===Rothschild family===
The town has had a long association with the Rothschild family, since Lionel de Rothschild bought neighbouring farmlands to the west of the town in 1873. Over time the farm developed into the Ascott House estate located less than from the town. In the late 19th century, Baron Ferdinand de Rothschild used the now demolished Leighton House and its stabling, on the High Street, as a hunting box. The family still maintain links with the town through their ownership of Southcourt Stud in Southcote.

===Non-conformism===
The town has a strong history of dissenters and is home to one of the oldest Friends meeting houses in the region. Established in the 18th century, local Quakers continue to meet in the Meeting House on North Street.

===Poor law union===
After the Poor Law Amendment Act 1834 Leighton Buzzard became the centre of a poor law union that consisted of 15 surrounding parishes with the union workhouse (still standing) being sited in Grovebury Road.
In 1847, additional land was obtained adjacent to the workhouse on which to build an isolation hospital. It had twenty beds over three wards, one each for patients with Diphtheria, Scarlet Fever and Typhoid. Jane Sarah Downer was appointed Nurse-Matron of the Isolation Hospital in 1899, and worked there until at least 1911. Downer had trained under Eva Luckes at The London Hospital between 1895 and 1897, and then worked on the Private Nursing Staff for one year, before her appointment as Matron in Leighton Buzzard.

===World War II===
During World War II, RAF Leighton Buzzard, a secret communications facility described as &quot;the largest telephone exchange in the world&quot;, was located to the south of Stanbridge Road. Also the headquarters of No. 60 Group RAF, which controlled the air defence radar network across Britain, operated from Oxenden House (now demolished) off Plantation Road.
===The Great Train Robbery===
The Great Train Robbery took place in 1963 at Bridego Bridge just outside Leighton Buzzard. The robbers were held at the Old Police Station on Wing Road Linslade while waiting to be seen by the local magistrate after being captured a month after the robbery.

Leighton Buzzard station was the location for part of the film &quot;Robbery&quot;, which is based on the ‘Great Train Robbery’.

===Telephone exchange===

The UK&#x27;s first and only TXE1 electronic telephone exchange went into service here in 1968. The large building, built on the site of the former Lake House, that housed this and later exchanges, can be found in Lake Street.

===Expansion===
The population of Leighton-Linslade was originally recorded in the 2001 census as 32,417. Part of Billington parish was transferred in 2003 to Leighton-Linslade, and the revised census result including this area was 32,753. At the 2011 census, the population of the Leighton-Linslade built-up area was recorded by the Office for National Statistics as 37,469, and was estimated to have reached 43,203 in 2020.

The town is expanding southwards, with the development of sites in southern Leighton Buzzard through the Southern Leighton Buzzard Development Brief. It is also expanding eastwards, with several developments forming the Eastern Leighton Linslade Urban Extension Scheme.

==Governance==

There are two tiers of local government covering Leighton Buzzard, at civil parish (town) and unitary authority level: Leighton-Linslade Town Council and Central Bedfordshire Council. The town council is based at the White House on Hockliffe Street.

===Administrative history===
Leighton Buzzard was an ancient parish. The parish historically comprised five townships, being Billington, Eggington, Heath and Reach, Stanbridge and a Leighton Buzzard township covering the town itself and adjoining areas. Such townships were all reclassified as civil parishes in 1866.

In 1891 the civil parish of Leighton Buzzard was made a local government district, administered by an elected local board. Such local government districts were reconstituted as urban districts under the Local Government Act 1894.

The Leighton Buzzard Urban District was abolished in 1965, merging with Linslade Urban District to become Leighton-Linslade Urban District. The merged council was based at the White House, which had previously been the headquarters of the Leighton Buzzard Urban District Council. In 1961 (the last census before the merger) the parish and urban district of Leighton Buzzard had a population of 11,745.

Leighton-Linslade Urban District only existed for nine years; it was abolished in 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972. District-level functions passed to South Bedfordshire District Council, which in turn was replaced by the unitary Central Bedfordshire Council in 2009, which also took over the functions of the abolished Bedfordshire County Council. A successor parish covering the abolished urban district of Leighton-Linslade was created in 1974, with its council taking the name Leighton-Linslade Town Council.

<doc id="367413" wikidata="Q742345" url="?curid=367413" title="Demetrius the Cynic">
<text>Demetrius (; fl. 1st century), a Cynic philosopher from Corinth, who lived in Rome during the reigns of Caligula, Nero and Vespasian (37–71 AD).

==Biography==
Demetrius was the intimate friend of Seneca, who wrote about him often, and who describes him as the perfect man:
Demetrius, who seems to have been placed by nature in our times that he might prove that we could neither corrupt him nor be corrected by him; a man of consummate wisdom, though he himself disclaimed it, constant to the principles which he professed, of an eloquence worthy to deal with the mightiest subjects, scorning mere prettinesses and verbal niceties, but expressing with infinite spirit, the ideas which inspired it. I doubt not that he was endowed by divine providence with so pure a life and such power of speech in order that our age might neither be without a model nor a reproach.

His contempt for worldly riches is shown by his reply to Caligula who, wishing to corrupt him, offered him two hundred thousand sesterces. Demetrius replied, &quot;If he meant to tempt me, he ought to have tried to do so by offering his entire kingdom.&quot;

He was also a friend of Thrasea Paetus and was with him when Thrasea was condemned to death (66 AD). We hear of him again in the reign of Vespasian (c. 70 AD), when, curiously, he defended Publius Egnatius Celer against the charges brought against him by Musonius Rufus. He was exiled from Rome in 71 AD, by Vespasian, along with all other philosophers.

Demetrius is sometimes identified with the Demetrius of Sunium mentioned by Lucian. However, Demetrius was a very common name in the Roman world, and Demetrius of Sunium was probably, (but not certainly), a different, later Cynic.

==Quotations of Demetrius==
*&quot;An easy existence, untroubled by the attacks of Fortune is a Dead Sea&quot;
*&quot;The talk of the ignorant is like the rumblings which issue from the belly.&quot;

<doc id="367419" wikidata="Q5255305" url="?curid=367419" title="Demetrius of Alopece">
<text>Demetrius of Alopece () was a Greek sculptor of the early part of the 4th century BC, who is said by ancient critics to have been notable for the lifelike realism of his statues. His portrait of Pellichus, a Corinthian general, &quot;with fat paunch and bald head, wearing a cloak which leaves him half exposed, with some of the hairs of his head flowing in the wind, and prominent veins&quot;, was admired by Lucian. He was contrasted with Cresilas, an idealizing sculptor of the generation before. Since, however, the peculiarities mentioned by Lucian do not appear in Greek portraits before the 3rd century BC, and since the Greek art of the 4th century consistently idealizes the images concerned, there would seem to be a difficulty to explain.

The date of Demetrius given above is confirmed by inscriptions found on the Athenian Acropolis.

<text>Tom Servo is a fictional character from the American science fiction comedy television show &quot;Mystery Science Theater 3000&quot; (&quot;MST3K&quot;). Tom is one of two wise-cracking, robotic main characters of the show, built by Joel Robinson to act as a companion and help stave off madness as he was forced to watch low-quality films (Tom and the other bots, Crow, Gypsy, and Cambot, are made from parts that would have otherwise allowed Joel to actually control the film). At least during the Comedy Central era, he was somewhat more mature than his theatre companion, Crow T. Robot. Tom, more often than the others, signals the need to exit the theater to perform host segments.

==Overview==
Tom Servo is a red puppet that has a gumball machine (Carousel Executive Snack Dispenser) for a head, a body composed of a toy &quot;Money Lover Barrel&quot; coin bank and a toy car engine block, and a bowl-shaped hovercraft skirt (a Halloween &quot;Boo Bowl&quot;) instead of legs. His arm assembly (according to the 1998 MST3K Official Bot Builders Booklet Workbench Edition) is from a Mr Moonie doll. Mr Moonie (sometimes known as &quot;Seymour Bunz&quot; or &quot;C More Bunz&quot;) was a gag doll popular during the time of filming, usually found suction cupped to people&#x27;s car windows to moon other drivers. The doll would drop its pants and moon people when a rubber bladder was squeezed. The entire assembly, including the rubber bladder, were kept intact when installed into Tom&#x27;s barrel body. The hands were apparently from a clown or hobo doll figure, but are now made from a mold. The springs were custom made by a local manufacturer, which were attached with glue to the wrists and arms. His arms would spring up and down whenever the clear balloon inside was gripped by Kevin, as shown in pictures from The Colossal Episode Guide or The Scrapbook tape. The Patrick Swayze Christmas segment shows Kevin in the puppet trench working Tom Servo with bladder in each hand. Although the other characters comment occasionally throughout the series that his arms are not functional, they actually do move up and down due to the Mr Moonie doll bladder inside Tom, and can be seen moving up and down in a fair few episodes as early as season 2. His shoulders are made from the front of an Eveready Floating Lantern. Because Servo&#x27;s head is transparent, chromakeyed images appear projected through it, and thus a second puppet was built for use in the theater segments, entirely spray-painted black. This black Servo also appeared in a host segment in episode #609, &quot;The Skydivers&quot;. Tom moves about by hovering. In seasons one through ten he is unable to hover much higher than the ground, however in season eleven (and briefly in the film version) he is capable of hovering at apparently any height and with great agility. In episode #413 &quot;Manhunt in Space&quot; it is revealed that Servo suffers from red-green colorblindness.

Servo&#x27;s appearance has changed over time. In the pilot for &quot;MST3K&quot;, the robot who would become Servo was named &quot;Beeper&quot;, who just spoke in beeps that only Crow could understand (similar to R2-D2 and C-3PO from the &quot;Star Wars&quot; films). He was an all-silver robot vaguely shaped like the ultimate Servo, with funnel-shaped shoulders, silver rubber tube arms, a plastic flowerpot for a hoverskirt, and a small fishbowl for a head. He was renamed &#x27;Servo&#x27; after a vending machine called the Servotron. The character was absent in K01: &quot;Invaders from the Deep&quot;, but re-appeared again for the remainder of the KTMA series as the now-familiar Servo puppet with the gumball machine head in K02: &quot;Revenge of the Mysterons from Mars&quot;.

In Season 1 on the Comedy Channel, he was given a red color, longer black tube arms, squared white shoulders, a different hoverskirt, and the Carousel Snack Dispenser gumball machine head with a white beak. Around episode 105: &quot;The Corpse Vanishes&quot;, Servo&#x27;s head was replaced with a slightly modified version of his &quot;Carousel&quot; head. The &quot;neck&quot; was slightly wider and the beak (now silver at this point) appeared smaller. This version of Servo&#x27;s head would be used for the remainder of Season 1. For Season 2, the black tubing used for his arms was replaced by a pair of small silver springs and the more familiar Carousel Dispenser head design (KTMA/pre episode 105) returned with a silver beak. This physical form was pretty much the same throughout the remainder of the series, save for a brief flirtation (during episodes #205: Rocket Attack USA and #206: Ring of Terror) with a slim cylindrical gumball-machine head to try to reduce the screen area Servo&#x27;s head obscured. It was introduced as a &quot;haircut&quot; that Joel gave Servo, but was quickly abandoned. By mid season 3 an extra cap from another Carousel Dispenser was added just below the &quot;bubble&quot; making Tom&#x27;s head appear slightly taller and slimmer. Briefly in early season 4, Servo&#x27;s white hands were changed to beige before returning to white after only a few episodes. During a host segment in the Sci-Fi era, he briefly acquired the body of a &quot;beautiful butterfly.&quot;

Servo&#x27;s voice and personality also changed during the show&#x27;s early years. While Josh Weinstein operated Servo during the KTMA season, Servo originally spoke with a sleazy, Bullwinkle-type voice in episode K02 (the earliest seen of the regular Servo puppet), then a rather slow squeaky voice from K03–K05, and was somewhat immobile during host segments but oddly very active in the theater. In episode K06, Weinstein switched to a lower voice that Servo repeatedly proclaimed as his new &quot;MIGHTY VOICE!&quot; When Weinstein left at the end of Season 1, Kevin Murphy took over Servo&#x27;s operation and tried to match Weinstein&#x27;s Servo voice and personality, but gradually developed a somewhat new Servo sound and character (though Murphy has a fairly deep voice himself). This was explained as tinkering by Joel. During Murphy&#x27;s tenure, Servo took many opportunities to showcase his excellent singing. He also has an extensive underwear collection (as seen in &quot;Mystery Science Theater 3000: The Movie&quot;), as well as a large number of duplicates of himself that he made in episode #420: &quot;The Human Duplicators&quot; (also seen in episode #612: &quot;The Starfighters&quot;, episode #910: &quot;The Touch of Satan&quot;, episode #913: &quot;Quest of the Delta Knights&quot;, episode #1003: &quot;Merlin&#x27;s Shop of Mystical Wonders&quot;, episode #1004: &quot;Future War&quot;, and episode #1013: &quot;&quot;). Female Servo duplicates were featured in The Touch of Satan and Quest of the Delta Knights.

Whenever a member of the cast is required to dress in drag for a sketch, Servo usually does the honors. This is both because of the dichotomy of women&#x27;s clothes amusingly contrasted with puppeteer Murphy&#x27;s strong baritone voice and because, in Murphy&#x27;s words, &quot;Servo looks better in a dress than Crow.&quot; Also, Servo is the only robot (other than Cambot in seasons 5–10) whose entire body can be seen on the show, since Crow&#x27;s legs are behind the desk and Gypsy&#x27;s body is several yards long.

Servo normally has a condescending personality and at times can make literary and technical references that are above his companions&#x27; heads. He frequently attempts to seem physically imposing to others, once acquiring &quot;lifts&quot; for his hover skirt to increase his size (accused by Mike of suffering &quot;short man&#x27;s disease&quot;) and on another occasion showing off a small arsenal he had acquired while drifting through space. Almost invariably, however, any attempts at confronting danger or displaying his intellectual skill cause him such frustration that he ends up crying, often needing consolation from Joel or Mike. He also has demonstrated a tendency to take jokes and skits way over the top, having to be brought back down to earth by the others.

Furthermore, he&#x27;s easily rattled by sarcastic remarks made from Crow, such as the time when he made fun of his infatuation with a boy&#x27;s pet turtle Tibby in the episode &#x27;Gamera&#x27;.

He does have a good understanding and intellect in spite of his sensitivity and frustration, and revealed in the episode &quot;The Gunslinger&quot; that he&#x27;s able to teleport at will, even though he only demonstrates this on rare other occasions.

In Season 11 Tom received many upgrades, including the ability to fly or hover as seen many times. Also he seems to have working hands and arms now as he is shown being able to wield a baseball bat. The original Servo is apparently destroyed in Episode 1101 &quot;Reptilicus&quot;, but a clone identical to the original Servo in every way remains behind, taking his place. In Season 13, where the Satellite of Love set is green screen, Servo&#x27;s head is permanently clouded to avoid chroma-key problems.

<text>The Feri Tradition is an American neo-pagan tradition related to Neopagan witchcraft. It was founded in the West Coast of the United States between the 1950s and 1960s by Victor Henry Anderson and his wife, Cora Anderson. Practitioners have described it as an ecstatic tradition, rather than a fertility tradition. Strong emphasis is placed on sensual experience and awareness, including sexual mysticism, which is not limited to heterosexual expression.

==History==

Anderson met Cora Ann Cremeans in Bend, Oregon, in 1944; they married three days later, on 3 May, claiming that they had encountered each other many times before in the astral realm. Born in Nyota, Alabama, in January 1915, Cora had been exposed to folk magic practices from childhood; reputedly, her Irish grandfather was a &quot;root doctor&quot; who was known among locals as the &quot;druid&quot;. The Andersons claimed that one of their first acts after their marriage was the erection of an altar. The following year, a son was born, and they named him Victor Elon, with the latter being the Hebrew word for oak; Cora stated that she had received the name in a dream. After the birth, a ritual was held to dedicate the infant to the Goddess. In 1948, the family moved to Niles, California, later that year purchasing a home in San Leandro. There, Anderson became a member of the Alameda Lodge of the Fraternal Order of Eagles, and he subsequently remained so for forty years. Victor earned his living as a musician, playing the accordion at events, while Cora worked as a hospital cook. It has been claimed that Anderson could speak Hawaiian, Spanish, Creole, Greek, Italian, and Gothic.

In the mid-1950s Victor and Cora read &quot;Witchcraft Today&quot;, a 1954 book by English Wiccan Gerald Gardner, with Cora claiming that Victor corresponded with Gardner for a time. The Pagan studies scholar Chas S. Clifton has suggested that the Andersons used Gardner&#x27;s work as a &quot;style guide&quot; for the development of their own tradition of modern Pagan Witchcraft. Similarly, Kelly stated that the Andersons&#x27; tradition &quot;began to more and more resemble that of the Gardnerians&quot; as the couple learned more about the latter, adopting elements from it.
Anderson was in correspondence with the Italian-American Wiccan Leo Martello, who encouraged Anderson to found his own coven. Circa 1960, the Andersons founded a coven, naming it Mahealani, after the Hawaiian word for the full moon. Throughout the late 1950s and early 1960s, the Andersons initiated a number of individuals into the coven. One of these was Gwydion Pendderwen, a friend of their son who shared their interest in the esoteric. Pendderwen contributed to the development of what came to be known as the Feri tradition, with some members of the lineage viewing him as one of its co-founders, along with Victor and Cora. Pendderwen noted that he had first met the family when, aged thirteen, he got into a fistfight with Victor Elon, although the two later became friends. Pendderwen was particularly influenced by Welsh mythology, and on a visit to Britain he spent time with the Alexandrian Wiccans Alex Sanders and Stewart Farrar, subsequently introducing various Alexandrian elements into Feri. In the early 1970s, the Andersons established a new coven with Pendderwen and his initiate, Alison Harlow. After Pendderwen married, his wife also joined this coven, although it disbanded in 1974.

===Andersons&#x27; teaching===

Over the next four decades, the Andersons would initiate between twenty-five and thirty people into their tradition.
Anderson has been described as the &quot;founding teacher&quot; and the &quot;seminal voice&quot; of the Feri tradition. The original word that the Andersons used for their tradition was &quot;Vicia&quot;, which Cora was known to say was Italian. She added that &quot;the name Fairy became accidentally attached to our tradition because Victor so often mentioned that word in speaking of nature spirits and Celtic magic.” Early initiates alternately spelled the name of the tradition as &quot;Fairy&quot;, &quot;Faery&quot;, or &quot;Faerie&quot;, although Anderson began using the spelling &quot;Feri&quot; during the 1990s to more easily differentiate it from other Wiccan traditions of the same or similar names; not all practitioners followed his example. Cora claimed that &quot;Feri&quot; was the word&#x27;s original spelling, adding that it meant &quot;the things of magic&quot;. Anderson also referred to it as the &quot;Pictish&quot; tradition. In their writing, the Andersons mixed terminology adopted from Huna, Gardnerian Wicca, and Vodou, believing that all reflected the same underlying magico-religious tapestry. It drew heavily upon the huna system developed by Max Freedom Long. According to one Feri initiate, Corvia Blackthorn:

According to Kelly:

According to one initiate, Jim Schuette, Anderson was &quot;a taskmaster. He took pride in testing his students.&quot;
One of those initiated into the Andersons&#x27; Feri tradition was Starhawk, who incorporated ideas from the Feri tradition when creating Reclaiming. She also included aspects from it in her 1979 book, &quot;The Spiral Dance&quot;, including mention of the Iron and Pearl Pentagram and the three souls, all of which originated within Feri.
Another prominent initiate was Gabriel Carillo (Caradoc ap Cador), who in the late 1970s developed a written body of Feri teachings, and began offering paid classes in the tradition in the 1980s, generating the Bloodrose lineage; doing so generated controversy among Feri initiates, with critics believing that it was morally wrong to charge for teaching.

<doc id="367428" wikidata="Q275115" url="?curid=367428" title="Backstroke">
<text>Backstroke or back crawl is one of the four swimming styles used in competitive events regulated by FINA, and the only one of these styles swum on the back. This swimming style has the advantage of easy breathing, but the disadvantage of swimmers not being able to see where they are going. It also has a different start from the other three competition swimming styles. The swimming style is similar to an &quot;upside down&quot; front crawl or freestyle. Both backstroke and front crawl are long-axis strokes. In individual medley backstroke is the second style swum; in the medley relay it is the first style swum.

==History==
Backstroke is an ancient style of swimming, popularized by Harry Hebner. It was the second stroke to be swum in competitions after the front crawl. The first Olympic backstroke competition was the 1900 Paris Olympics men&#x27;s 200 meter.

==Technique==

In the initial position, the swimmer performing backstroke lies flat on the back; arms stretched with extended fingertips, and legs extended backwards.

===Arm movement===

In backstroke, the arms contribute most of the forward movement. The arm stroke consists of two main parts: the power phase (consisting of three separate parts) and the recovery. The arms alternate so that one arm is always underwater while the other arm is recovering. One complete arm turn is considered one cycle. From the initial position, one arm sinks slightly under water and turns the palm outward to start the catch phase (first part of the power phase). The hand enters downward (pinkie finger first) then pulling out at a 45-degree angle, catching the water.

During the power phase the hand follows a semi-circular path from the catch to the side of the hip. The palm is always facing away from the swimming direction, while remaining straight as an extension of the arm, and the elbow always points downward towards the bottom of the pool. This is done so that both the arms and the elbow can push the maximum amount of water back in order to push the body forward. At the height of the shoulders, the upper and lower arms should have their maximum angle of about 90 degrees. This is called the Mid-Pull of the power phase.

The Mid-Pull phase consists of pushing the palm of the hand as far down as possible with the fingers pointing upward. Again, the goal is to push the body forward against the water. At the very end of the Mid-Pull, the palm flaps down for a last push forward down to a depth of 45 cm, creating the finish of the power phase. Besides pushing the body forward, this also helps with the rolling back to the other side as part of the body movement. During the power phase, the fingers of the hand can be slightly apart, as this will increase the resistance of the hand in the water due to turbulence.

To prepare for the recovery phase, the hand is rotated so that the palms point towards the legs and the thumb side points upwards. At the beginning of the recovery phase of the one arm, the other arm begins its power phase. The recovering arm is moved in a semicircle straight over the shoulders to the front. During this recovery, the palm rotates so that the small finger enters the water first, allowing for the least amount of resistance, and the palms point outward. After a short gliding phase, the cycle repeats with the preparation for the next power phase.
====Variants====
A variant is to move both arms synchronized and not alternating, similar to an upside down breast stroke. This is easier to coordinate, and the peak speed during the combined power phase is faster, yet the speed is much slower during the combined recovery. The average speed will usually be less than the average speed of the alternating stroke. This stroke is commonly called the elementary backstroke. This elementary backstroke swim was used in the 1900 and 1908 Olympics. The backcrawl swim supplanted the elementary backstroke swim after 1908 as the competitive back swim and it is now referred to as the backstroke.

Another variant is the old style of swimming backstroke, where the arm movement formed a complete circle in a windmill type pattern. However, this style is not commonly used for competitive swimming, as a lot of energy is spent on pushing the body up and down instead of forward. Furthermore, the added strain on the shoulder is considered less than ideal and can lead to injuries.

It is also possible to move only one arm at a time (paused stroke), where one arm moves through the power and recovery phases while the other arm rests. This is slow, but it is used frequently to teach students the movement, as they have to concentrate on only one arm. This drill technique can work well with the swimmer holding a float, however it is important not to overuse this drill as a &quot;paused stroke&quot; can easily become habitual and can be challenging to unlearn.

===Leg movement===
The leg movement in backstroke is similar to the flutter kick in front crawl. The kick makes a large contribution to the forward speed, while significantly stabilizing the body.

The leg stroke alternates, with one leg sinking down straight to about 30 degrees. From this position, the leg makes a fast kick upward, slightly bending the knee at the beginning and then stretching it again in the horizontal. However, there are also frequent variants with four or only two kicks per cycle. Usually, sprinters tend to use 6 kicks per cycle, whereas long-distance swimmers may use fewer.
====Variants====
It is also possible to use a butterfly kick, although this is rare except after the initial start and after turns. The dolphin kick is essential for many top athletes because it is the fastest part of the race. It may also constitute the majority of the race (i.e., in the 100 yard backstroke the swimmer may kick underwater dolphin for 15 yards per length which equates to as much as 60 yards kicking in a 100 yd race). A great example of this is Olympic gold medallist Natalie Coughlin. Breaststroke kicks are most comfortable if the arms are used synchronized, as the breaststroke kick makes it more difficult to compensate for the rolling movement with alternating arm cycles. The butterfly kick can be done slightly to one side depending on the rolling motion of the body.

===Breathing===
Breathing in backstroke is easier than in other strokes, as the mouth and nose are usually above water. Competitive swimmers breathe in through the mouth during the recovery of one arm, and breathe out through the mouth and nose during the pull and push phase of the same arm. This is done to clear the nose of water.

===Body movement===
Due to the asynchronous movement of the arms, the body tends to roll around its long axis. By taking advantage of this rolling motion, swimmers can increase their effectiveness while swimming backstroke. The overall position of the body is straight in the horizontal to reduce drag. Beginners frequently let their posterior and thighs sink too low, which increases drag. To avoid this, the upper legs have to be moved to the extreme down position at each kick even with a little help by the back and the foot tips have to be fixed in the extreme lower position and the head is held out of the water to act as a counter-weight.

===Start===

The backstroke start is the only start from the water. The swimmer faces the wall and grabs part of the start block or the wall with their hands. Ideally, there are grips on the block for this purpose. The legs are placed shoulder width apart on the wall with both heels slightly off the wall. Just before the starting signal, the swimmer pulls their head closer to the start block, while keeping the knees bent at a 90-degree angle. Some swimmers prefer to keep one foot slightly lower than the other during the start.

For the takeoff, the swimmer pushes their hands away from the block and swings their arms around sideways to the front. At the same time, the swimmer throws their head to the back. The swimmer then pushes away from the wall with their feet. Ideally, the swimmer&#x27;s back is arched during the airborne phase so that only the feet and the hands touch the water while the rest of the body is above the water line. This reduces drag and permits a faster start. On September 21, 2005, FINA modified the backstroke start rule regarding toes below the water line. The feet can now be above the water, but not above or curled over the lip of the pool gutter.

After the start, the swimmer is completely underwater. Due to increased resistance at the surface, experienced swimmers usually swim faster underwater than at the surface. Therefore, most experienced swimmers in backstroke competitions stay under water up to the limit set by FINA (15 meters after the start and after every turn). Most swimmers use a butterfly kick underwater, as this provides more forward movement than the flutter kick. The underwater phase includes the risk of water entering the nose, so most swimmers breathe out through the nose to stop water from entering.

The swimmer&#x27;s head must break the surface before 15 m under FINA rules. The swimmer starts swimming with one arm, followed by the other arm with half a cycle delay. The swimmer continues in regular swimming style, staying on the back for the entire time except the turns.

===Turn and finish===

Approaching the wall presents swimmers with the problem of not seeing where they are going. Most competitive swimmers know how many strokes they need for a lane, or at least how many strokes after the signal flags or the change in color of the separating lines. Turning the head is also possible, but slows the swimmer down.

Prior to September 1992 swimmers had to touch the wall on their back before initiating the turn or rolling off their back in order to turn. After September 1992 when approaching the wall, the swimmer is allowed to turn to their breast and make one push/pull phase with one arm or simultaneous double arm pull. Next, the swimmer makes half a tumble turn forward, resting the feet against the wall. The arms are in the forward position at this time, and the swimmer pushes their body off the wall. Similar to the start, the swimmer can remain up to 15 m under water, with most swimmers using a butterfly kick for speed. This rule change allowed for faster turns.

For the finish, the swimmer must touch the wall while lying on their back, less than 90 degrees out of the horizontal, and must not be completely submerged.
2020 USA Swimming Rulebook, 101.4 BACKSTROKE, Finish — Upon the finish of the race, the swimmer must touch the wall while on the back.

==Competitions==
There are three common distances swum in competitive backstroke swimming, both over either a long course (50 m pool) or a short course (25 m pool). The United States also employs short-course yards (25-yard pool).
* 50 m backstroke
* 100 m backstroke
* 200 m backstroke
Other distances are also swum on occasions.

Backstroke is also part of the medley over the following distances:
* 100 m individual medley (short course 25 m pool only)
* 200 m individual medley
* 400 m individual medley
* 4 × 100 m medley relay

Below are the official FINA rules which apply to swimmers during official competitions.
* Before the starting signal, the swimmers shall line up in the water facing the starting end, with both hands holding the starting grips. Standing in or on the gutter or bending the toes over the lip of the gutter is prohibited.
* At the signal for starting and after turning, the swimmer shall push off and swim upon his back throughout the race except when executing a turn as set forth in SW 6.4. The normal position on the back can include a roll movement of the body up to, but not including 90 degrees from horizontal. The position of the head is not relevant.
* Some part of the swimmer must break the surface of the water throughout the race. It shall be permissible for the swimmer to be completely submerged during the turn, and for a distance of not more than 15 meters after the start and each turn. By that point, the head must have broken the surface.
* During the turn, the shoulders may be turned over the vertical to the breast after which a continuous single arm pull or a continuous simultaneous double arm pull may be used to initiate the turn. Once the body has left the position on the back, any kick or arm pull must be part of the continuous turning action. The swimmer must have returned to the position on the back upon leaving the wall. When executing the turn there must be a touch of the wall with some part of the swimmer&#x27;s body.
* Upon the finish of the race, the swimmer must touch the wall while on the back in his/her respective lane. Competitive swimmers frequently swing their arm back and down into the water, bringing the head and upper body with it. This creates a large amount of forward momentum into the wall. A single dolphin kick can be used to keep the some part of the swimmer above water, and therefore, legal.

<doc id="367431" wikidata="Q844289" url="?curid=367431" title="Sicilian Expedition">
<text>The Sicilian Expedition was an Athenian military expedition to Sicily, which took place from 415–413 BC during the Peloponnesian War between Athens on one side and Sparta, Syracuse and Corinth on the other. The expedition ended in a devastating defeat for the Athenian forces, severely affecting Athens. 

The expedition was hampered from the outset by uncertainty in its purpose and command structure—political maneuvering in Athens swelled a lightweight force of twenty ships into a massive armada, and the expedition&#x27;s primary proponent, Alcibiades, was recalled from command to stand trial before the fleet even reached Sicily. Still, the Athenians achieved early successes. Syracuse, the most powerful state in Sicily, responded exceptionally slowly to the Athenian threat and, as a result, was almost completely invested before the arrival of back-up in the form of Spartan general Gylippus, who galvanized its inhabitants into action. From that point forward, however, as the Athenians ceded the initiative to their newly energized opponents, the tide of the conflict shifted. A massive reinforcing armada from Athens briefly gave the Athenians the upper hand once more, but a disastrous failed assault on a strategic high point and several crippling naval defeats damaged the Athenian soldiers&#x27; ability to continue fighting and maintain morale. The Athenians attempted a last-ditch evacuation from Syracuse. The evacuation failed, and nearly the entire expedition was captured or was destroyed in Sicily.

The effects of the defeat were immense. Two hundred ships and thousands of soldiers, an appreciable portion of Athens&#x27; total manpower, were lost in a single stroke. The city&#x27;s enemies on the mainland and in Persia were encouraged to take action, and rebellions broke out in the Aegean. Some historians consider the defeat to have been the turning point in the war, though Athens continued to fight for another decade. Thucydides observed that contemporary Greeks were shocked not that Athens eventually fell after the defeat, but rather that it fought on for as long as it did, so devastating were the losses suffered. Athens managed to recover remarkably well from the expedition materially, the principal issue being the loss of manpower rather than the loss of ships.

==Background==

===Athens and Sicily===
Although Athens had never involved itself deeply in Sicilian affairs, it had ties there before the onset of the Peloponnesian War, dating back to at least the mid-5th century BC. To small Sicilian cities, Athens was a potential counter to the powerful city of Syracuse, which was strong enough to potentially dominate the island. Syracuse, like Sparta and its Peloponnesian allies, was a Dorian city, while most of Athens&#x27;s allies on the island were Ionian. Another source of conflict was the close relationship of Syracuse and other Dorian cities of the west to Athens&#x27;s great commercial rival, Corinth. To the Athenians, Sicily was a threat—an unencumbered Syracuse might send grain or other aid to the Peloponnesians—as well as a venue for possible conquests.

In 427 BC, Athens had sent twenty ships, under the command of Laches, in response to an appeal for help from Leontini. That expedition, operating from a base at Rhegium, remained in the area for several years, fighting alongside Athens&#x27;s local allies against the Syracusans and their allies, without achieving any dramatic successes. In 425, the Athenians planned to reinforce their contingent with an additional forty triremes, but that fleet never reached Sicily, as it became caught up in the pivotal Battle of Pylos on the way there. By the time that fleet reached Sicily in late summer, Athens&#x27;s Sicilian allies had grown weary of stalemated warfare, and agreed to negotiate with Syracuse and its allies. At the Congress of Gela, the Sicilian cities made peace on the basis of &quot;Sicily for the Sicilians&quot;, and the Athenian fleet left for home.
===State of the War===
In 415, Athens and Sparta had been formally at peace since 421, when the Peace of Nicias had brought the Archidamian War to a close. The terms of that peace, however, had never been fulfilled; Sparta had never surrendered Amphipolis to Athens, as required by the treaty, and in return the Athenians had held Pylos. More recently, Athenian and Spartan troops had fought at the Battle of Mantinea in 418, with Athens supporting Argos, Mantinea, and other Peloponnesian cities in an attempt to establish a stable anti-Spartan alliance in the Peloponnese. That attempt, largely orchestrated by the Athenian nobleman Alcibiades, would have destroyed Sparta&#x27;s control over the Peloponnesian League had it succeeded. Alcibiades rebounded politically from this defeat, and was elected as a general in the spring of 417. Control of Athens&#x27; foreign policy remained divided between a &quot;peace party&quot; (or pro-Spartan party) led by Nicias, and a &quot;war party&quot; led by Alcibiades.

==Dispatch of the expedition==
===Appeal from Segesta===
The peace established in Sicily at the Congress of Gela did not last long. Shortly after the Congress, Syracuse intervened in an episode of civil strife between the democratic and oligarchic parties in Leontini, supporting the oligarchs. Before too long, the prospect of foreign domination had united the Leontinians, and the two parties united in war against Syracuse. Athens had sent an emissary to Sicily in 422 to sound out the possibility of renewing the war against Syracuse, but achieved nothing. In 416, however, a second Sicilian conflict provided the invitation Athens had sought in 422. The city of Segesta—an Athenian ally in the 420s—went to war against Selinus and, after losing an initial battle, sent to Athens for help. In order to win the Athenians&#x27; support, the Segestaeans claimed that they were capable of funding much of the cost of sending a fleet, offering 60 talents of uncoined silver up front, and tricking Athenian ambassadors into believing that the city was more prosperous than it actually was, by making sure that the ambassadors saw all their golden and other valuable objects in a way as if these were just part of what they had.

===The debate===
At Athens, the Segestan ambassadors presented their case for intervention to the assembly, where debate over the proposal quickly divided along traditional factional lines. The assembly eventually approved an expedition composed of sixty triremes, without hoplite accompaniment, commanded by Nicias, Alcibiades, and Lamachus. Thucydides reports that Nicias had been appointed against his preference, but offers no further detail regarding that debate.

Five days after that first debate, a second assembly was held to arrange the logistics of the expedition. There, Nicias attempted to persuade the assembly to overturn its previous decision regarding whether to send an expedition at all. Over the course of several speeches, Nicias raised a series of different arguments against the expedition. He reminded the Athenians that they would be leaving powerful enemies behind them if they sent a force to Sicily, and warned that they would be opening hostilities with enemies too difficult and numerous to conquer and rule. Nicias also attacked Alcibiades&#x27;s credibility, claiming that he and his allies were inexperienced and self-aggrandizing young men eager to lead Athens into war for their own ends.

In response, Alcibiades dismissed the attack on himself by pointing to the good he had done for Athens as a private citizen and public leader. He rebutted Nicias&#x27;s warnings about the plan for the expedition by reminding the Athenians of their obligation to their Sicilian allies, appealing to the enterprising spirit that had won Athens her empire, and pointing out that many states on Sicily would support Athens in her operations there.

The assembly was clearly leaning towards Alcibiades&#x27;s side, so Nicias, judging them unlikely to cancel the expedition if he argued against it directly, chose a different tactic. He described the wealth and power of the Sicilian cities Athens would be challenging, and stated that a larger expedition than previously approved would be required, expecting that the prospect of approving such a massive expenditure would prove unappealing to the citizenry. Contrary to Nicias&#x27;s plan, the assembly enthusiastically embraced his proposal, and passed a motion allowing the generals to arrange for a force of over 100 ships and 5,000 hoplites. Nicias&#x27;s ploy had failed badly. His misreading of the assembly had altered the strategic situation; whereas the loss of 60 ships would have been painful but bearable, the loss of the larger force would be catastrophic. &quot;Without Nicias&#x27;s intervention,&quot; wrote Donald Kagan, &quot;there would have been an Athenian expedition against Sicily in 415, but there could not have been a disaster.&quot;

===Destruction of the Hermai===

After lengthy preparations, the fleet was ready to sail. The night before they were to leave, someone destroyed many of the hermai—the stone markers representing Hermes, placed around the city for good luck. This event was taken very seriously by the Athenian people as it was considered a bad omen for the expedition, as well as evidence of a revolutionary conspiracy to overthrow the government. According to Plutarch, Androcles, a political enemy of Alcibiades, used false witness to claim that Alcibiades and his friends were responsible. Alcibiades volunteered to be put on trial under penalty of death in order to prove his innocence (wanting to avoid his enemies charging him, in his absence, with more false information), but this request was denied.

He was otherwise extremely popular and had the support of the entire army; he had also gained the support of Argos and Mantinea during the preparations. He was not charged, and the fleet sailed the next day. His opponents, however, waited for Alcibiades to set sail before they leveled the charges against him. This was because the army, his main source of support, would be absent, and his supporters would be outnumbered when the votes were cast.

===Reaction in Syracuse===
Many people in Syracuse, the richest and most powerful city of Sicily, felt that the Athenians were in fact coming to attack them under the pretense of aiding Segesta in a minor war. The Syracusan general Hermocrates suggested that they ask for help from other Sicilian cities, and from Carthage. He also wanted to meet the Athenian fleet in the Ionian Sea before they arrived. Others argued that Athens was no threat to Syracuse, and some people did not believe there was a fleet at all, because Athens would not be so foolish as to attack them while they were still at war with Sparta. Athenagoras accused Hermocrates and others of attempting to instill fear among the population and trying to overthrow the government.

===Three generals, three strategies===
At the first assembly that authorized the expedition, the Athenians named Nicias, Alcibiades, and Lamachus as its commanders; that decision remained unchanged at the second assembly. Alcibiades was the expedition&#x27;s leading proponent, and the leader of the war party, Nicias its leading critic and the leader of the peace party. Lamachus, meanwhile, was a fifty-year-old career soldier, of whom the longest extant portrayal is a series of scenes in Aristophanes&#x27; &quot;The Acharnians&quot; that satirize him as a braggadocious, perpetually impoverished warrior. The reasons for the Athenians&#x27; choice are not recorded, but the assembly may have been seeking to balance the aggressive young leader with a more conservative older figure, with Lamachus added for his military expertise.

In practice, each of the three generals proposed a different strategy. Nicias proposed a narrowly circumscribed expedition; he felt that the fleet should sail to Selinus and force a settlement between Selinus and Segesta. After that, he proposed to briefly around Sicily and then return home, unless the Segestans were willing to pay for the full cost of the expanded expedition. Alcibiades proposed to first attempt to win over allies on the island through diplomacy, and then attack Selinus and Syracuse. Lamachus, meanwhile, proposed taking advantage of the element of surprise by sailing directly to Syracuse and giving battle outside the city. Such a sudden attack, he felt, would catch the Syracusans off guard and possibly induce their quick surrender. Eventually, however, Lamachus settled the three-way division of opinion by endorsing Alcibiades&#x27;s plan.
==Course of the Expedition==
===Athenian landing===
The Athenian fleet first sailed to Corcyra to meet up with their allies, and the ships were divided into three sections, one for each commander. Three of the ships were sent ahead to look for allies in Sicily. The fleet at this point consisted of 134 triremes (100 of which were from Athens), 5,100 hoplites (of which 2,200 were Athenians), 480 archers, 700 slingers, 120 other light troops, and 30 cavalry, as well as 130 other supply ships and all the crews of the triremes and other non-combatants.

They had little luck finding allies along the coast of southern Italy and, when the three other ships returned, they learned that Segesta did not have the money they promised. Nicias had expected this, but the other commanders were dismayed. Nicias suggested they make a show of force and then return home, while Alcibiades said they should encourage revolts against Syracuse, and then attack Syracuse and Selinus. Lamachus said they should attack Syracuse right away, as it was the predominant city-state in Sicily.

The fleet proceeded to Catania, where an Athenian ship arrived to inform Alcibiades that he was under arrest, not only for the destruction of the hermai, but also for supposedly profaning the Eleusinian Mysteries. Alcibiades agreed to return in his ship, but when they stopped in southern Italy at Thurii, he escaped and sailed to the Peloponnese, where he sought refuge in Sparta. Athens passed a death sentence &quot;in absentia&quot;, his guilt seemingly proven. In Sparta, Alcibiades gave the members of the Peloponnesian League critical information on the Athenian Empire.

In Sicily, the fleet was redivided into two parts. The first contingent, commanded by Nicias, sailed to Segesta and forced the Segestans to pay the thirty talents they had promised the Athenians for their assistance against their rival Selinus. The second contingent, under Lamachus, sailed to and stormed Hyccara, a small city allied to Selinus, and enslaved its populace. The Athenian army then marched through the Sicilian interior, to impress and negotiate with the Sicels, and returned to Catania. There they wintered and made preparations for their upcoming siege of Syracuse. When the campaigning season started, the Syracusans moved against the Athenians while they were still encamped at Catania. While the Syracusans were marching to Catania, they learned the Athenians had boarded their ships and sailed into the Great Harbour at Syracuse. The Syracusans quickly hurried back and prepared for battle.

===First Battle of Syracuse===
The Athenian army landed to the south of Syracuse and fortified their position. When the Syracusan army finally arrived both sides waited for the other to make the first move. Eventually the Syracusans withdrew and made camp for the night. The next morning the Athenians lined up eight men deep, with the Argives and Mantineans on the right, the rest of the allies on the left, and the Athenians themselves in the centre. The Syracusans were deployed sixteen men deep, in order to offset the advantage of the Athenians in experience. They also had 1,200 cavalry, vastly outnumbering the Athenian cavalry, although the total numbers of men were about the same. The Athenians attacked first, believing themselves to be the stronger and more experienced army, and after some unexpectedly strong resistance, the Argives pushed back the Syracusan left wing, causing the rest to flee. The Syracusan cavalry prevented the Athenians from chasing them, thereby averting a catastrophe for the Syracusans, who lost about 260 men, and the Athenians about 50. The Athenians then sailed back to Catania for the winter.

===Winter of 415 – spring of 414 BC===
Hermocrates suggested that the Syracusans reorganize their army. He wanted to reduce the number of generals from fifteen to three; Hermocrates, Heraclides, and Sicanus were elected and Hermocrates sent for help from Corinth and Sparta. During the winter the Athenians also sent for more money and cavalry, while the Syracusans built some forts, and a wall extending the territory of the city.

Meanwhile, diplomats from both camps went to Camarina in an attempt to form an alliance with that city. Hermocrates wanted Camarina and the other cities to unite with Syracuse against Athens, but Euphemus, the representative for the Athenians, said Syracuse only wanted to rule Camarina, and they should join with Athens if they wanted to remain free. The Camarinans decided not to join either side, although they quietly sent aid to the Syracusans, whose greater proximity and potential victory they feared more than that of the Athenians.

Athens then sent for help from the Carthaginians and the Etruscans, as both were long-standing opponents of Syracuse. Carthage opted to stay out of the conflict, but several Etruscan cities banded together and organized a small force to aid Athens. Though the Etruscan force only included three large warships and a number of warriors, it provided crucial support to the Athenians. Athens and Syracuse also tried to gain assistance from the Greek cities in Italy. In Corinth, representatives from Syracuse met with Alcibiades, who was working with Sparta. Alcibiades informed Sparta that there would be an invasion of the Peloponnese if Sicily was conquered, and that they should send help to Syracuse and also fortify Decelea near Athens. The Athenians, he said, feared nothing more than the occupation of Decelea. The Spartans took this advice into consideration, and appointed Gylippus to command their fleet.

In the spring of 414 BC, reinforcements arrived from Athens, consisting of 250 cavalry, 30 mounted archers, and 300 talents of silver, which was used to pay for 400 more cavalry from their Sicilian allies. In the summer, they landed on the Epipolae, the cliff above Syracuse, which was defended by Diomilus and 600 Syracusans. In the attack, Diomilus and 300 of his men were killed.

Both sides then began building a series of walls. The Athenian circumvallation, known as &quot;the Circle&quot;, was meant to blockade Syracuse from the rest of the island, while the Syracusans built a number of counter-walls from the city to their various forts. A force of 300 Athenians destroyed part of the first counter-wall, but the Syracusans began to build another one, this time with a ditch, blocking the Athenians from extending their wall to the sea. Another 300 Athenians attacked this wall and captured it, but were driven off by a Syracusan counter-attack in which Lamachus was killed, leaving only Nicias from the three original commanders. The Syracusans destroyed 300 m (1,000 feet) of the Athenian wall, but could not destroy the Circle, which was defended by Nicias. After Nicias defeated the attack, the Athenians finally extended their wall to the sea, completely blockading Syracuse by land, and their fleet entered the harbour to blockade them from sea. The Syracusans responded by removing Hermocrates and Sicanus as generals and replacing them with Heraclides, Eucles, and Tellias.

===Spartan intervention===
Soon after this, the Spartan general Gylippus, responding to the call for help, landed at Himera. He marched towards Syracuse with 700 armed sailors, 1,000 hoplites from Himera and Selinus, 100+ cavalry, and 1,000 Sicels. They built another counter-wall on the Epipolae, but were driven back by the Athenians; in a second battle, however, Gylippus defeated the Athenians by making better use of his cavalry and javelin-throwers. The Syracusans completed their counter-wall, making the Athenian wall useless. The Corinthian fleet also arrived, under the command of Erasinides.

Nicias, exhausted and suffering from illness, now believed it would be impossible to capture Syracuse. He wrote a letter to Athens, not trusting messengers to give an accurate report, and suggested that they either recall the expedition or send out massive reinforcements. He hoped they would choose to recall him, if not the whole expedition, but instead they chose to send reinforcements, under Demosthenes and Eurymedon. Eurymedon left immediately with ten ships, and Demosthenes left sometime later with a much larger force. Meanwhile, in early 413 BC Sparta acted on Alcibiades&#x27;s advice to fortify Decelea, and the Athenian force sent to relieve it was destroyed.

While Eurymedon was sailing, Gylippus&#x27;s 80 Syracusan ships, including 35 triremes, attacked 60 of the Athenian ships (25 of which were triremes) in the harbour. Gylippus commanded a simultaneous attack on the Athenian land forces. In the harbour, the Athenians were successful, losing only three ships while the Syracusans lost eleven. However, Gylippus defeated the Athenians on land and captured two Athenian forts. Afterwards, Gylippus succeeded in convincing all the neutral cities on Sicily to join him, but the allies of Athens killed 800 Corinthians, including all but one of the Corinthian ambassadors.

===Demosthenes&#x27; arrival===
Demosthenes and Eurymedon then arrived with 73 ships and 5,000 hoplites. On their arrival, 80 Syracusan ships attacked 75 of the Athenian ships in their harbour. This battle went on for two days with no result, until the Syracusans pretended to back away and attacked the Athenians while they were eating. However, only seven Athenian ships were sunk.

Demosthenes landed his forces and attacked the Syracusan counter-wall on Epipolae in a risky night engagement (against the advice of Nicias). He succeeded in breaching the wall, routing or killing some of the first Syracusan defenders but was defeated by a force of Boeotians in the Spartan contingent. Many Athenians fell off the cliff to their deaths, and some of the rest were killed as they fled down the slope. Plutarch claims the casualties from this action numbered 2,000.

Demosthenes&#x27; arrival provided little relief to the other Athenians. Their camp was located near a marsh and many of them had fallen ill, including Nicias. Seeing this, Demosthenes thought they should all return to Athens to defend Attica against the Spartan invasion that had taken Decelea. Nicias, who had opposed the expedition at first, now did not want to show any weakness either to the Syracusans and Spartans, or to the Athenians at home who he thought would have him executed, stating he would rather die by the hands of the enemy than by those of his countrymen. He hoped the Syracusans would soon run out of money, and he had also been informed that there were pro-Athenian factions in Syracuse who were ready to turn the city over to him. Demosthenes and Eurymedon reluctantly agreed that Nicias might be right, but when reinforcements from the Peloponnese arrived, Nicias agreed that they should leave.

===Second Battle of Syracuse===

Just as the Athenians were preparing to sail home, on 28 August, there was a lunar eclipse, and Nicias, described by Thucydides as a particularly superstitious man, asked the priests what he should do. They suggested the Athenians wait for another 27 days, and Nicias agreed.

The Athenians were now in a desperate situation. On 3 September, the Syracusans began to completely blockade the entrance to the port, trapping the Athenians inside. Outside Syracuse, the Athenians built a smaller walled enclosure for their sick and injured, and put everyone else (including many of the soldiers remaining on land) on their ships for one last battle, on 9 September. The fleet was now commanded by Demosthenes, Menander, and Euthydemus, while the Syracusan fleet was led by Sicanus and Agatharchus of Syracuse on the wings and Pythen from Corinth in the centre. Each side had about 100 ships participating.

The Athenian ships were extremely cramped and had no room to manoeuvre. Collisions were frequent, and the Syracusans could easily ram the Athenian ships head-on, without the Athenians being able to move to ram them broadside, as they preferred. Javelin throwers and archers shot from each ship, but the Syracusans deflected Athenian grappling hooks by covering their decks with animal hides.

The battle went on for some time with no clear victor, but the Athenian center under Menander eventually broke and was routed. Instead of pursuing their fleeing opponents, Pythen turned his Corinthian ships to attack the now-vulnerable Athenian right wing under Euthydemus. Beset from multiple sides, the right wing was defeated and largely destroyed; Euthydemus was killed as he tried to escape on the nearby shore. The destruction of Euthydemus&#x27; contingent shattered what remained of the Athenian fleet&#x27;s order. The Athenian ships were subsequently pushed toward the coast; most Athenian crews abandoned their trapped vessels and fled to the camp behind their wall. Seeing the vulnerable Athenians running from their beached vessels, Gylippus ordered a furious but disorganized attack on land to catch his enemies before they could reach their base. However, the Spartan-led force was confronted by the small unit of Etruscans who had been sent to aid Athens; these warriors managed to stop Gylippus&#x27;s assault. Using this respite, the Athenians rallied and returned to fight alongside the Etruscans, securing several of their ships on the beach and preventing a complete catastrophe. Historian David Abulafia concluded that the Etruscans had &quot;saved the day&quot; for the Athenians.

Demosthenes suggested that they man the ships again and attempt to force their way out, as now both fleets had lost about half their ships and Nicias agreed. The men themselves did not want to board the ship because they were afraid. They then decided to retreat by land. Hermocrates sent some supposed informers to the Athenians to falsely report that there were spies and roadblocks further inland, so the Athenians would be safer if they did not march away. Gylippus used this delay to build the roadblocks that did not yet exist, and the Syracusans burned or towed away the Athenian ships on the beach, so that they had no way off the island.

===Final Syracusan victory===

On 13 September, the Athenians left camp leaving their wounded behind and their dead unburied. The survivors, including all the non-combatants, numbered 40,000, and some of the wounded crawled after them as far as they could go. As they marched they defeated a small Syracusan force guarding the river Anapus, but other Syracusan cavalry and light troops continually harassed them. Near the Erineus river, Demosthenes and Nicias became separated, and Demosthenes was attacked by the Syracusans and forced to surrender his 6,000 troops. The rest of the Syracusans followed Nicias to the Assinarus river, where Nicias&#x27;s troops became disorganized in the rush to find drinking water. Many Athenians were trampled to death and others were killed while fighting with fellow Athenians. On the other side of the river a Syracusan force was waiting, and the Athenians were almost completely massacred, by far the worst defeat of the entire expedition in terms of lives lost. Nicias personally surrendered to Gylippus, hoping the Spartan would remember his role in the peace treaty of 421. The few who escaped found refuge in Catana.

The prisoners, now numbering only 7,000, were held in the stone quarries near Syracuse which were considered the safest prison for such a number of men. Demosthenes and Nicias were executed, against the orders of Gylippus. The rest spent ten weeks in horrible conditions in their makeshift prison, until all but the Athenians, Italians, and Sicilians were sold as slaves. The remaining Athenians were left to die slowly of disease and starvation in the quarry. In the end some of the very last survivors managed to escape and eventually trickled to Athens, bringing first-hand news of the disaster. The specific fate of Nicias and Demosthenes is not clearly recorded, but according to Thucydides&#x27; account, both were executed after their surrender, Demosthenes due to his earlier role in the war at Pylos, Nicias due to worries of a possibility of escape through bribery and possibility of causing later harm.

==Causes of the failure==
Some historians have said that the Sicilian expedition was fatally flawed from the outset, that the Athenian attempt to conquer Sicily was an example of mad arrogance. Others however argue that there was nothing inherently wrong with the plan strategically, and that it would have succeeded if the Athenian leadership had not made a succession of bad tactical decisions. J. B. Bury judged that by far the biggest single reason for the expedition&#x27;s catastrophic failure was the incompetence of Nicias, aggravated by the recall of Alcibiades.

== Aftermath ==
For Athens, the expedition was a &quot;human disaster as painful as the plague [as well as a] political disaster&quot; which severely harmed the city&#x27;s war efforts and hegemony over its allies. Sparta exploited this weakness to greatly increase the pressure on its rival over the next years, though it could not achieve a strategic breakthrough. In contrast, the Etruscans who had fought alongside the Athenians were proud of their role in the conflict. For instance, the Spurinna family of Tarquinia possibly continued to honor their involvement in the Sicilian Expedition for centuries.

===Athenian reaction===

In Athens, the citizens did not, at first, believe the defeat. Plutarch, in his &quot;Life of Nicias&quot;, recounts how the news reached the city:

It is said that the Athenians would not believe their loss, in a great degree because of the person who first brought them news of it. For a certain stranger, it seems, coming to Piraeus, and there sitting in a barber&#x27;s shop, began to talk of what had happened, as if the Athenians already knew all that had passed; which the barber hearing, before he acquainted anybody else, ran as fast as he could up into the city, addressed himself to the Archons, and presently spread it about in the marketplace. On which, there being everywhere, as may be imagined, terror and consternation, the Archons summoned a general assembly, and there brought in the man and questioned him how he came to know. And he, giving no satisfactory account, was taken for a spreader of false intelligence and a disturber of the city, and was, therefore, fastened to the wheel and racked a long time, till other messengers arrived that related the whole disaster particularly. So hardly was Nicias believed to have suffered the calamity which he had often predicted.

When the magnitude of the disaster became evident, there was a general panic. Attica seemed free for the taking, as the Spartans were so close by in Decelea.
The defeat caused a great shift in policy for many other states, as well. States which had until now been neutral joined with Sparta, assuming that Athens&#x27;s defeat was imminent. Many of Athens&#x27; allies in the Delian League also revolted, and although the city immediately began to rebuild its fleet, there was little they could do about the revolts for the time being. The expedition and consequent disaster left Athens reeling. Some 10,000 hoplites had perished and, though this was a blow, the real concern was the loss of the huge fleet dispatched to Sicily. Triremes could be replaced, but the 30,000 experienced oarsmen lost in Sicily were irreplaceable and Athens had to rely on ill-trained slaves to form the backbone of her new fleet.

In 411 BC, the Athenian democracy was overthrown in favour of an oligarchy, and Persia joined the war on the Spartan side. Although things looked grim for Athens, they were able to recover for a few years. The oligarchy was soon overthrown, and Athens won the Battle of Cynossema; however, the defeat of the Sicilian expedition was essentially the beginning of the end for Athens. In 404 BC they were defeated and occupied by Sparta.

==In popular culture==
John Fletcher&#x27;s 90 minute radio play &quot;The Sicilian Expedition – Ancient Athenian War Drama with Iraq War&quot;, which was broadcast on BBC Radio 3 in December 2005, is based on real events from the Peloponnesian War, particularly the Sicilian Expedition. Fletcher implies a parallel between U.S. involvement in the Iraq war and the Athenian aggression against Sicily, which in his view were both disastrous abroad and at home.

This expedition is portrayed in the real-time strategy video game Age of Empires II DE and its DLC &quot;Chronicles: Battle for Greece.&quot;

<doc id="367433" wikidata="Q2555402" url="?curid=367433" title="Askern">
<text>Askern () is a town and civil parish within the City of Doncaster, in South Yorkshire, England. It is on the A19 road between Doncaster and Selby. Historically part of the West Riding of Yorkshire, it had a population of 5,570 at the 2011 Census. Askern was also known in for its Greyhound Stadium, which closed in 2022.

==History==
The town&#x27;s name derives from the Old English &quot;askr-ærn&quot; meaning &#x27;building made of ash&#x27; or &#x27;building surrounded by ash trees&#x27;. Historically in the parish of Campsall, the town lies south of Pontefract, and north of Doncaster. Up until the middle of the 19th century, the town was in the wapentake of Osgoldcross in the West Riding of Yorkshire.

The history of Askern can be traced back to the reign of Edward III. The people of Norton complained to the Sheriff of Osgoldcross that the people of Askern had failed to keep part of Askern Pool in a clean state. As a result, the King&#x27;s highway had been &quot;overflowed and drowned so that neither horse nor foot passengers could use it&quot;.

The parish church of St Peter&#x27;s dates back to 1852.

===Spa===
In the 19th century, Askern was a popular spa resort. The sulphurous nature of Askern Lake had long been recognised, and the first bathing house opened in 1786. In the 1820s and 1830s several hotels opened in the village, turning it into a small spa town. Visitor numbers increased when the railway station opened in 1848. By the 20th century the resort&#x27;s popularity had declined, and the coming of coal mining permanenty changed the character of the town. The last bathhouse was demolished in the 1960s.

===Coal mining===
Then in the early years of the 20th century the quest for coal identified a good seam of coal near Askern. It was decided to access the coal from a mine built above the village, in 1911. As the mine opened the new houses were built for the workers and their families in the village. The pit was closed in 1991 due to a low in the price of coal, and the surface buildings were demolished in 1993.

== Railway ==
Askern is on the former Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway line between Doncaster and Wakefield Kirkgate, though Askern railway station closed in 1947. The line is used mainly by goods services, as well as the four-times daily Grand Central passenger services from Bradford Interchange to London King&#x27;s Cross. There have been proposals to re-open Askern railway station to passenger trains.

== Bus services ==

Askern is served by bus service 51 to Doncaster, Carcroft, Skellow and Norton. There are also two school bus services from the town.

<text>This is a list of Swedish companies owned by the state.

State-owned companies are legally in a form of aktiebolag but mainly or fully state-owned. They are expected to be funded by their sales, and not be given direct tax money. A big customer might be the state or a government agency.

Many companies originate from a former government agency. Government agencies are something different, usually funded by tax money but do also sell services, and are not an authority. The government has tried to avoid having agencies doing commercial activities, by separating out areas that compete with private companies into government-owned companies, for example within road construction. The reason is both to avoid unfair competition (because it could mean using tax money to beat private companies), and a wish to have a market economy instead of a planned economy as much as possible. Based on the tradition of avoiding &quot;ministerial rule&quot;, the government has avoided interfering with the business of the companies, and allowed them to go international. This has been somewhat controversial. For example, Akademiska Hus which owns buildings used by universities is claiming commercial rent levels, much higher than traditionally, causing trouble for higher education.

<doc id="367435" wikidata="Q41588" url="?curid=367435" title="Indonesian rupiah">
<text>The rupiah (symbol: Rp; currency code: IDR) is the official currency of Indonesia, issued and controlled by Bank Indonesia. Its name is derived from the Sanskrit word for silver, (). Sometimes, Indonesians also informally use the word ( in Indonesian) in referring to rupiah in coins. The rupiah is divided into 100 cents (), although high inflation has rendered all coins and banknotes denominated in cents obsolete.

The rupiah was introduced in 1946 by Indonesian nationalists fighting for independence. It replaced the Japanese-issued version of the Netherlands Indies gulden which had been introduced during the Japanese occupation in World War II. In its early years, the rupiah was used in conjunction with other currencies, including a new version of the gulden introduced by the Dutch. The Riau Islands and the Indonesian half of New Guinea (&quot;Irian Barat&quot;) had their own variants of the rupiah in the past, but these were subsumed into the national rupiah in 1964 and 1971, respectively (see Riau rupiah and West Irian rupiah).

== Redenomination ==
A long-running proposal to redenominate the rupiah has yet to receive formal legislative consideration. Since 2010, Bank Indonesia, as the monetary authority of Indonesia, has repeatedly urged the elimination of the final three zeroes of the currency to facilitate transaction handling, saying the move would not affect its value and significance. In 2015, the government submitted a rupiah redenomination bill to the House of Representatives, but it has not yet been deliberated. In 2017, Bank Indonesia Governor Agus Martowardojo reiterated the call, saying that if redenomination started immediately, the process could be complete by 2024 or 2025.

== Current legal tender ==
The current rupiah consists of coins from Rp50 up to Rp1,000 (Rp1 coins officially remain legal tender but are effectively worthless and are not encountered in circulation) and banknotes of Rp1,000 up to Rp100,000. With US$1 worth Rp15,107.5 as of 3 May 2023, the largest Indonesian banknote is worth about US$6.27.
== Coins ==

Presently, two series of coins are circulating: aluminum, and nickel coins dated between 1999, 2003, and 2010, and a new series of coins featuring Indonesia&#x27;s national heroes were issued in 2016. These come in denominations of Rp100, Rp200, Rp500, and Rp1,000. Coins in circulation are mostly Rp500 and Rp1,000, whereas the smaller-denominated coins (Rp100 and Rp200) are rarely used, except in shops whose pricing requires them.
== Banknotes ==
Currently circulating Indonesian banknotes date from 2000 (Rp1,000), 2001 (Rp5,000), 2004 (Rp20,000 and Rp100,000), 2005 (Rp10,000 and Rp50,000), 2009 (the new denomination of Rp2.000), 2010 (revised version of the Rp10,000), 2011 (revised versions of the Rp20,000, Rp50,000 and Rp100,000) and 2020 (the commemorative Rp75,000 denomination issued 2020). Notes issued in 1998–1999 ceased to be legal tender since 31 December 2008 and were exchangeable until 30 December 2018 at Bank Indonesia. Earlier notes are also no longer legal tender, due to the lack of security features and association with the Suharto regime (especially 1993 and 1995 note of the 50,000 rupiah), but could be exchanged in Bank Indonesia offices until 20 August 2010.

As the smallest current note is worth approximately US$0.067, even small transactions such as bus fares are typically conducted with notes and the Rp1,000 coin is far more common than the Rp1,000 note. The government initially announced that this would change, with a Rp2,000 note to replace the Rp1,000, with that denomination fully replaced by the equivalent coin. After a long delay, this proposal was revised so that the Rp2,000 banknotes were launched by Bank Indonesia (BI) on 9 July 2009, with the banknotes circulating as legal tender from 10 July 2009, but without withdrawing the 1,000-rupiah note.

=== 2016 series ===
Following the issuance of Presidential Decree No. 31 of 5 September 2016, BI introduced seven new banknote designs featuring national heroes:

On 17 August 2020, Bank Indonesia officially introduced a Rp75,000 banknote to commemorate the 75th Independence Day of Indonesia. The note featured the proclamators of Indonesia&#x27;s Independence, Sukarno and Mohammad Hatta (who were also featured in the Rp100,000 note). In 2022, the BI predicts that banknotes of this series will cease to be legal tender in 2025 or 2026, with all circulating 2016-series banknotes replaced by newer 2022-series banknotes.

=== 2022 series ===
Bank Indonesia introduced a new family of banknotes on 18 August 2022. Officially they were retroactively issued as legal tender on 17 August 2022 to commemorate the 77th Independence Day of Indonesia. Similar to the 2016 series, the Indonesian dances and national heroes are still featured on the notes, with some notable changes.
=== Security features ===

* The basic materials of the banknotes is cotton fiber, because it is more flexible and not easily ripped. However, the preferable material is abacá, which is naturally plentiful in Indonesia, especially in the Talaud Islands. and is believed to increase the durability of the banknotes. In 2014, Bank Indonesia planned to use this material, but in the 2016 series, decided to print using paper which was also used to print banknotes from previous editions.
* The minimum security features visible to the naked eye are watermarks, electrotypes and security threads with colour fibres. Extra features may be included, such as holograms, Irisafe, iridescent stripes, clear windows, metameric windows and gold patches.
** Watermark and electrotype are made by controlling the gap of density of the fibres, which create certain images for the banknotes. This is done to raise the aesthetic quality of the notes.
** Security threads are inserted into the note so that horizontal and vertical lines are shown from top to bottom. The threads can be varied in materials, size, colour and design.
** Intaglio printing is used for the denomination numbers in the banknote, to help blind people recognise genuine notes and their denomination.
* The 2010 and 2011 revised-2004/2005 note series of Rp10,000, Rp20,000, Rp50,000 and Rp100,000 introduced several new security features: use of EURion constellation rings, rainbow printing designed to change colour when viewed from different angles and tactile features for blind people and those with visual difficulties to recognise the different denominations of the notes.

== Digital rupiah ==
Bank Indonesia initiated the Garuda Project, a project to develop Indonesia&#x27;s central bank digital currency on 30 November 2022 crypto. through a white paper on its development. By passage of the omnibus law, the digital rupiah is legalised as a form of the rupiah.

== History ==

Historically, currencies of Indonesia have been influenced by the spread of Indian and Chinese cultures. During colonial times, the currency used in what is now Indonesia was the Netherlands Indies gulden. The country was invaded in 1942 by Japan, which began printing its own version of the gulden, which remained in use until March 1946. The Netherlands authorities and the Indonesian nationalists, who were fighting for independence, both introduced rival currencies in 1946 with the Dutch printing a new gulden, and the Indonesians issuing the first version of the rupiah on 3 October 1946. Between 1946 and 1950 a large number of currencies circulated in Indonesia, with the Japanese gulden still remaining prevalent alongside the two new currencies and various local variants. This situation ended when the federal government, now in complete control following the Dutch recognition of its independence, initiated currency reforms between 1950 and 1951. The rupiah was declared the sole legal currency, with other currencies being exchanged for rupiah at rates which were often unfavourable to the holders.

== Exchange rate and inflation ==
The rupiah has been subject to high inflation for most of its existence (which as an internationally recognised currency should be dated to 1950). Various attempts have been made to maintain the value of the currency, but all were abandoned.

=== 1946–1949 revolutionary period ===
In the period from October 1946 to March 1950, Indonesian currency had no international recognition. Its value was determined on the black market.

=== 1949–1965 foreign exchange restrictions ===
The exchange rate determined upon the international recognition of Indonesia&#x27;s independence in 1949 was Rp3.8 to US$1. Lembaga Alat-Alat Pembayaran Luar Negeri Publication No. 26 on 11 March 1950 (effective 13 March 1950) established the Foreign Exchange Certificate System (FECS). By the trade-in certificates an export rate of Rp7.6 and an import rate of Rp11.4 was established.

The FECS was scrapped on 4 January 1952, by which time the government had been able to reduce its deficit by 5.3 billion rupiah through the exchange differential. The system was scrapped because domestic prices were being determined by the import rate, which were hurting profits from exports earned at the lower rate. Hence, the effective Rp7.6/11.4 exchange rate reverted to Rp3.8.

The ending of what amounted to an export tariff severely damaged government revenues, and as of 4 February 1952, the rupiah was officially devalued to Rp11.4, with export tariffs of 15–25% on commodities in which Indonesia was strong. Weaker commodities were not subject to tariffs, and from 1955 were actually given a premium of 5–25% to boost their export.

To control foreign exchange, the government brought in a number of measures. About 40% of the foreign-exchange requirements of importers were required to be paid to the government from April 1952, while as from September 1952, the government decided to provide only a limited amount of foreign exchange, made available every four months. These foreign-exchange restrictions, designed to provide the government with much-needed reserves, meant that some companies were operating at as low as 20% of capacity, due to lack of needed imported materials.

Further foreign-exchange restrictions were introduced over 1953–1954, with April 1953, the foreign-exchange downpayment was increased to 75%, except for raw materials at 50%. Foreign companies and their workers were placed under restrictions as to the amount of foreign exchange that could be sent home, with the amounts allowed out subject to fees of %. As of November 1954, exporters were required to sell 15% of their foreign exchange earned to the government.

An increasingly complex set of tariffs on imports was unified in September 1955 with a set of extra import duties, requiring down payments to the government of 50, 100, 200, or 400% of the value of the goods.

The official Rp11.4 rate, which massively overvalued the rupiah, was a major incentive to black-market traders, and also contributed to anti-Java feeling, given that those producing raw materials on the large material-rich outer islands were not receiving fair value from their goods due to the exchange rate, diverting funds to the government in Java. The black-market rate at the end of 1956 was Rp31 to US$1, falling to Rp49 at the end of 1957, and Rp90 by the end of 1958.

In response to Sumatra and Sulawesi refusing to hand over their foreign exchange, in June 1957, a new system for foreign exchange was introduced; exporters received export certificates (BE) representing the foreign currency earned and could sell them to importers on the free market (but subject to a 20% tax). This effectively created a freely floating rupiah. The price of the certificates quickly reached 332% of face value by April 1958, i.e. Rp38, a rate at which the government chose to end the free market, fixing the price at 332% of face value.

The currency devaluation of large notes in 1959 had the official exchange rate devalued to Rp45 as of August 1959. Despite this, the fundamental issues with the fixed-exchange-rate system and severe import controls (which had cotton mills running at only 11% of capacity due to lack of imported raw materials) were not addressed, and smuggling grew, often backed by the army, while assets were moved offshore by over-invoicing.

The government maintained price controls over goods and raw materials, with the official oil price unchanged from 1950 to 1965.

After the 1959 devaluation, inflation, which had been running at 25% per annum 1953–1959, grew exponentially, with rates over 100% in 1962, 1963, and 1964, and 600% in 1965. Despite the official Rp45 to US$1 rate, two further export certificate trading systems, of March 1962 – May 1963, and then from April 1964 onwards, showed premiums of 2,678% July 1962 (an effective rate of Rp1,205), 5,100% August 1965 (Rp2,295) and 11,100% in November 1965 (Rp4,995).

=== 1966–1971 stabilisation and growth ===
The last demonetisation of rupiah notes occurred in late 1965 when inflation was ravaging the economy: exports had dropped 24% in 1959–1965, real GDP growth was below population growth, and the foreign exchange reserves had fallen by over 90%. Inflation in 1965 was 635%. In late 1965, the &#x27;new rupiah&#x27; was brought in, at 1 new rupiah to 1,000 old rupiah. The official exchange rate was set initially at Rp0.25 to US$1 as of 13 December 1965, a rate that did not represent reality, as the multiple exchange-rate system remained in place for the time being.

This was followed by the emergence of Suharto, who as of 11 March 1966, acquired executive control of Indonesia.

Suharto quickly made economic changes, establishing his &quot;New Order&quot;, with the economic policy set by the Berkeley Mafia, his team of US-educated neoclassical economists. The policy began to be set out in November 1966, following the reaching of agreement with Indonesia&#x27;s creditors in October 1966 on debt relief and loan restructuring. Economic policies were put in place to require adequate bank reserves, ending subsidies on consumer goods, end import restrictions, and to devalue the rupiah.

The 1966–1970 stabilisation program was a great success, resulting in higher economic growth, boosting legal exports (which grew 70% in US$ terms over the period), and increasing output (for instance the price of oil rose 250 times when the 1950 prices were abandoned, incentivising new exploration). By 1971, inflation had fallen to just 2%.

Despite the liberalisation efforts, Indonesia still had multiple exchange rates. A more realistic exchange rate was finally established of 378 (new) rupiah to US$1 as of April 1970. In August 1971, the exchange rate was devalued slightly, to Rp415 to US$1.

=== Fixed rate period 1971–1978 ===

The exchange rate of 415 rupiah to the US dollar, which had been established in August 1971, was maintained by government intervention in the currency market, buying and selling currency as needed.

Despite the fixed exchange rate, the failure of the rice crop in 1972, exacerbated by high world rice prices and underordering by the government rice cartel, along with rising commodity prices, caused inflation to rise above 20% in 1972, peaking at over 40% in 1974. The M1 money supply increased sharply over the period due to lax credit controls, which was channelled towards favoured groups, such as &quot;pribumi&quot;, as well as corrupt government-linked businesses.

Despite the high inflation of the period, the exchange rate, which had essentially been preserved using the country&#x27;s oil exports, was maintained at Rp415 until 15 November 1978.

=== Managed float period 1978–1997 ===

==== 1978–1986 devaluations ====
By 1978, the combination of a fall in oil prices and a decrease in foreign reserves meant that the rupiah was devalued 33% to Rp. 625 to US$1 on 16 November 1978 (although prices had increased nearly fourfold over the period).

The government abandoned the fixed exchange rate, and altered economic policy to a form of a managed float. The exchange rate was published each day. At the point of devaluation (November 1978), the trade-weighted real (local price adjusted) effective exchange rate of the rupiah against major world currencies was just over twice as high as it was in 1995 (prior to the Asian economic crisis, and free fall of the rupiah), i.e. the rupiah was highly overvalued at this point. By March 1983, the managed float had brought only an 11% fall in three and a half years to Rp702.

The continued overvaluation of the rupiah meant that Indonesia was beginning to suffer a trade deficit, as well as falling foreign exchange reserves. The government responded by devaluing the currency on 30 March by 28% to Rp970.

At this time, the 1980s oil glut put the Indonesian economy under pressure, with exports uncompetitive as a result of the overvalued currency, and oil contributing less as a result of lower global prices. On 1 June 1983, &#x27;Pakjun 1983&#x27; brought deregulation of the banking system, and the end of the meaningless 6% official deposit rate, with a more market-based financial system. Credit ceilings were removed. Interest rates, initially 18%, remained above 15% over the period.

By September 1986, the currency had been allowed to steadily fall to 1,134 rupiah, a rate which had largely maintained purchasing power over the period. Despite this, the currency was devalued 30% on 12 September 1986 to 1,664 rupiah to US$1. As in 1983, this had been intended to boost the balance of trade: oil prices, US$29 in 1983, fell by 50% in 1986 alone, to below US$9 per barrel.

Thus, in the period from 1978 to 1986, the real exchange rate of the Indonesian rupiah fell by more than 50%, providing significant boosts to the competitiveness of Indonesia&#x27;s exports.

==== October 1986 – June 1997: US$ real exchange parity ====

Although the devaluations of 1978, 1983, and 1986 had each successfully boosted the competitiveness of exports, devaluations have a destabilising effect, and the September 1986 devaluation was the last carried out by Indonesia.

According to research, despite an official seven-currency exchange basket, empirical evidence suggests that the rupiah was controlled by BI against the US$ alone, and indeed since the 1986 devaluation, the currency maintained near-constant purchasing power against the dollar until the 1997 crisis, the steady fall of the rupiah against the dollar essentially representing the difference between Indonesian inflation and US inflation; hence, by June 1997, the rupiah had fallen from its post-evaluation rate of Rp1,664 to Rp2,350, an annualized decline slightly over 3%.

=== Asian financial crisis (and response) 1997–1999 ===

==== First stage of the crisis – limited initial falls ====
The Asian financial crisis of 1997 began in Thailand in May 1997, where the government found it harder to maintain the Thai baht peg at ฿25 to US$1. By 2 July 1997, Thailand abandoned its defence of the baht, allowing it to float freely. Indonesia, which had massive foreign reserves and was seen as having a strong economy, responded on 11 July 1997, by widening its exchange rate band from 8 to 12%. Indonesia had taken similar actions in the years leading up to the crisis, in December 1995 from 2 to 3%, in response to the Mexican financial crisis, and in June and September 1996, from 3 to 5% and then 5 to 8%. These actions had been successful in the past in defending the rupiah, but on this occasion, a more serious crisis of confidence arose.

The rupiah immediately fell 7%, with foreign money quickly leaving the country. The investor confidence in Indonesia was shaken, and due to previous deregulations, much of the Indonesian stock market was owned by foreign investors. Local confidence in the currency was also undermined as the population followed suit, selling rupiah for dollars. The spot rate soon fell below the selling rate (i.e. outside the 12% exchange rate band). BI attempted to intervene but eventually abandoned the managed float on 14 August 1997, leaving the rupiah to float freely. The rupiah–dollar rate was at Rp2,436 to one dollar on 11 July. It fell to Rp2,663 by 14 August and Rp2,955 by 15 August – a 122% fall. Government debt (Bank Indonesia Certificates or SBI) rose from 12% to 30%, and overnight call rates reached 81% (per annum).

==== Response to the falls – crisis ====
At this stage, the crisis was a limited one; while the currency had fallen, the extent of the fall did not appear catastrophic. The government announced its response in September, calling for the restructuring of the banking sector, cancellation of government projects, and supporting some banks with their own liquidity. The SBI rate was reduced three times in September to around 20%. As of 24 September, the exchange rate still lingered at Rp. 2,990 per dollar.

The government response to the crisis sent mixed messages, with falling interest rates doing nothing to support confidence in the rupiah, and the rupiah continued to be sold, as companies that had been borrowing heavily in dollars had to meet their obligation. By 4 October, the currency had collapsed a further 19%, falling to Rp3,690 per dollar. It had now lost a third of its value, and now a full-blown &#x27;crisis&#x27; existed in Indonesia.

On 8 October with the rupiah at Rp3,640 per dollar, the government decided to seek the support of the International Monetary Fund. During the month, the rupiah fluctuated in the Rp3,300–3,650 range. IMF&#x27;s response was announced on 1 November 1997. Sixteen small and insolvent banks, holding a market share of 2.5%, would be closed. Private banks would be subject to improved monitoring, and some state banks would be merged. Deposits would be underwritten up to Rp20 million (about US$5,500). About 90% of all depositors held less than this amount in their bank accounts.

After this announcement, the rupiah immediately gained almost 10%, to around Rp3,300 per dollar. Soon after, however, confidence began to fall. The IMF response had only been published in summary form from the government and BI, the choice of the 16 banks being closed appeared arbitrary, and the details of the 34 others subject to special measures were not announced. The deposit guarantee was seen as inadequate, and funds were moved from private to state banks, exchanged for dollars, or transferred offshore, as confidence in the plan began to evaporate.

The rupiah steadily weakened from the middle of November, standing at Rp3,700 per dollar at the end of the month. In December, the crisis turned into a disaster. Much of the Indonesian economy was controlled by relatives of President Suharto, and of the 16 banks to be liquidated, 25% of PT Bank Andromeda was owned by Bambang Trihatmodjo, the second son of Suharto, PT Bank Jakarta was part-owned by Probosutedjo, the President&#x27;s half-brother and 8% of PT Bank Industri was owned by the President&#x27;s second daughter, Siti Hediati Prabowo.

The President and his family were opposed to the reforms, with Bambang Trihatmodjo beginning legal action against the government to keep his bank, particularly as directors of the insolvent banks were, if culpable, to be added to a Disgraced person&#x27;s List, ineligible to work in the banking sector. Although the bank had violated its BMPK (credit limit), Bambang was given permission by BI to buy Bank Alfa, another bank, seen by many as a reward for withdrawing his lawsuit. In effect, the failed bank was reopened under a different name.

Cronyism and corruption of Indonesia clearly were winning over IMF reforms. The rupiah fell from Rp4,085 to Rp5,650 per dollar in the space of a single week. By the middle of the month, 154 banks, comprising half of the banking system, had suffered bank runs. By Christmas Eve, the rupiah stood at 5,915 per dollar, a fall of 60% since July.

The New Year had the rupiah begin at Rp5,447 per dollar. On 15 January, the second letter of intent was signed with the IMF, agreeing an accelerated reform package in return for US$43 billion of aid. The rupiah had strengthened from an all-time low of Rp9,100 per dollar on 23 January to Rp. 7,225 per dollar on 15 January. However, as it became clear Suharto had no intention of fulfilling the agreement, the rupiah plummeted by more than 50%, bottoming out at Rp14,800 per dollar on 23 January. By now, the government had issued more than Rp60 trillion, causing money supply increases and worsening inflation.

The government announced a rescue package on 26 January, ensuring that it would guarantee all existing deposits. The Indonesian Bank Restructuring Agency was set up with the goal of merging, closing, or recapitalising (before sale) banks. Four state and 50 private banks, representing nearly 40% of the sector, were placed under IBRA supervision in February 1998, resulting in the rupiah strengthening to 7,400 per dollar.

Despite the improvements, political instability quickly increased. The currency fell to around Rp10,000 per dollar.

Indonesian government began to take more drastic action, doubling its SBI rates to 45% (increasing the cost of its lending), and in April, has signed a third letter of intent with the IMF, the IBRA took over the major private banks, twinning the banks with state banks, and suspending the owners&#x27; control. The rupiah, which had strengthened to around Rp8,000, depreciated in the wake of the Jakarta riots of May 1998, and in particular the run on the Bank Central Asia, Indonesia&#x27;s largest private bank, that ensued, causing the bank to be taken over by IBRA on 29 May. The SBI rate was increased to 70% in the wake of massive inflation.

The end of Suharto&#x27;s rule brought a new president, B. J. Habibie, to power on 21 May 1998. Little action was seen immediately, and by 17 June, the rupiah had bottomed out at Rp16,800 per dollar. On 25 June 1998, the fourth letter of intent was signed with the IMF, which was refusing to provide aid due to breaches of its original agreement. The IMF agreed to provide an immediate US$5 billion of aid to cover basic necessities.

Audits of the banks that had been taken over showed massive bad debts, exceeding 55%. Further audits showed that the other banks were also fundamentally weak. Banking reform continued throughout 1999, with the merger of four state banks in July 1999 into Bank Mandiri, the closure of 38 banks, recapitalisation of nine, and takeover of seven more in March 1999. By this point, the total bank capital had reached a negative 245 trillion rupiah. Twenty-three further banks were recapitalised in May, and in October 1999, Bank Mandiri itself was recapitalised. Interest rates fell steadily in 1999, to an SBI of 13.1% in October. The rupiah finished the year at Rp7,900 to the US dollar.

Despite the fall of the currency of about 70% from June 1997 to December 1998, inflation of 60–70% in 1998 (which caused riots and the end of the Suharto regime after 30 years in power) meant that the real exchange rate fell only slightly.

=== Rupiah since 1999: relative stability ===

The rupiah declined from its relatively strengthened position at the end of the financial crisis, with the rupiah seeing the start of 2000 at Rp7,050 to the US dollar, but declining to Rp9,725 by the end of 2000, and reaching a low of Rp12,069 on 27 April 2001. The currency strengthened to Rp8,500 later in 2001 but ended 2001 at Rp10,505. March 2002 had the currency break below Rp10,000, from which point the currency maintained a rate in the Rp8,000s and Rp9,000s until August 2005, and in the latter half of that year, the trading range extended towards Rp11,000, but ending the year just below Rp10,000. In 2006 and 2007, the currency trade was in a relatively narrow range against the US dollar (which itself was depreciating against other currencies), of Rp8,500–9,900. This trend continued into 2008, with the currency trading between Rp9,000 and Rp9,500.

The financial crisis of 2007–2008 with the collapse in the commodities market had the US$ gain strongly against currencies backed by weakening commodities exports. With palm oil and rubber prices falling from their peak by more than half, the rupiah came under pressure, Bank Indonesia spent US$7 billion of its US$57 billion reserves in October defending the currency. Despite this, the rupiah slipped below Rp10,000 on 23 October for the first time since 2005, and then below Rp11,000 on 2 November, a mark last reached in 2001. On 13 November, BI introduced new regulations requiring foreign currency purchases over US$100,000 a month to be backed by documentation of an underlying transaction and a tax number. The rupiah closed below Rp12,000 for the first time since 1998 on 20 October, with intraday lows below Rp13,000. Subsequently, however, the cut in the Federal Reserve rate to 0–0.25% and BI support for the currency, had the rupiah strengthen slightly to a range around Rp11,000.

The catastrophic damage to the rupiah caused in 1997–1998 severely damaged confidence in the currency. Though the rupiah is a freely convertible currency, it is still regarded as a risky currency to hold. As of September 2018, the rupiah had fallen to its weakest position since the 1998 crisis with one US dollar being worth roughly Rp14,880, peaking at Rp. 15,009 on 4 September. By the time COVID-19 pandemic hit the country in March 2020, it fell even further to nearly Rp. 16,650, nearly reaching the 1998 crisis value, although it recovered as the year progressed. In April 2024, the rupiah fell again to Rp 16,000 level. It is one of the least valued currency units in the world, after the Venezuelan bolivar, Iranian rial and Vietnamese đồng.

In present-day Indonesia, when mentioning an amount of money in everyday life, the currency name is rarely used, and instead replaced by the words &quot;thousand&quot;, &quot;million&quot;, and &quot;billion&quot;.

<doc id="367436" wikidata="Q2356817" url="?curid=367436" title="Alexandrian Wicca">
<text>Alexandrian Wicca or Alexandrian Witchcraft is a tradition of the Neopagan religion of Wicca, founded by Alex Sanders (also known as &quot;King of the Witches&quot;) who, with his wife Maxine Sanders, established the tradition in the United Kingdom in the 1960s. Alexandrian Wicca is similar in many ways to Gardnerian Wicca, and receives regular mention in books on Wicca as one of the religion&#x27;s most widely recognised traditions.

==Origins and history==
The tradition is based largely upon Gardnerian Wicca, in which Sanders was trained, and initiated, and also contains elements of ceremonial magic and Qabalah, which Sanders had studied independently.

Maxine Sanders recalls that the name was chosen when Stewart Farrar, a student of the Alex Sanders&#x27;, began to write &quot;What Witches Do&quot;. &quot;Stewart asked what Witches who were initiated via our Covens should be called; after much discussion, he came up with &quot;Alexandrian&quot; which both Alex and I rather liked. Before this time we were very happy to be called Witches&quot;. Conversely, the most recent edition of &quot;What Witches Do&quot; (2010) includes previously published interviews between Sanders and Farrar.

Alexandrian Wicca is practised outside of Britain, including Canada, Ireland, Portugal, Spain, the United States, Brazil and South Africa.

==Practices==
Alexandrian Wicca, in similarity with other traditional Wiccan practices, emphasises gender polarity. This emphasis can be seen in the Sabbat rituals, which focus on the relationship between the Wiccan Goddess and God.

As compared to Gardnerian Wicca, Alexandrian Wicca is &quot;somewhat more eclectic&quot;, according to &quot;The Encyclopedia of Modern Witchcraft and Neo-Paganism&quot;. Maxine Sanders notes that Alexandrians take the attitude &quot;If it works use it&quot;. Tool use and deity and elemental names also differ from the Gardnerian tradition. Skyclad practice, or ritual nudity, is practiced within the tradition, training is emphasized, and ceremonial magic practices, such as those derived from Hermetic Qabalah and Enochian magic may be part of ritual. Alex&#x27;s work on his &quot;Book of Shadows&quot; continued up until his death resulting, like the Gardnerian in several different versions. Some of these derived from his teaching notes that his students received in the late 1960s and early 1970s. It is not unusual to find that earlier initiates did not receive the same books as later ones although they obtained all the information in dictated form, Sander&#x27;s preferred mode of teaching.

Alexandrian covens meet on new moons, full moons and during Sabbat festivals.

==Ranks and degrees==
Alexandrian Wicca shares with other traditional Wicca systems the belief that &quot;only a witch can make another witch&quot;. The process through which an individual is made a witch is called &quot;initiation&quot;. As in Gardnerian Wicca, there are three levels, or &quot;degrees&quot;, of initiation, commonly referred to as &quot;first&quot;, &quot;second&quot;, and &quot;third&quot; degree. Only a second or third degree witch can initiate another into witchcraft, and only a third degree witch can initiate another to third degree. A third degree initiate is referred to as a &quot;High Priestess&quot; or &quot;High Priest&quot;. The Farrars published the rituals for the three ceremonies of initiation in &quot;Eight Sabbats for Witches&quot;.

Some Alexandrians have instituted a preliminary rank called &quot;neophyte&quot; or &quot;dedicant.&quot; In these Alexandrian covens, a neophyte is not bound by the oaths taken by initiates, and thus has an opportunity to examine the tradition before committing to it. Neophytes are not, however, considered to have actually joined the tradition until they do take first degree. As such they would not experience certain aspects of rituals that were considered oathbound.

==Relationship to other traditions==
Historian Ronald Hutton records comments from British practitioners of Gardnerian and Alexandrian Wicca that distinctions between the two traditions have blurred in the last couple of decades, and some initiates of both traditions have recognized initiation within one as qualification for the other. Author Vivianne Crowley often trains her students in both traditions. In the United States, Alexandrian priestess Mary Nesnick, an initiate of both traditions, created a deliberate fusion of the two, which she named the Algard Tradition.

Janet and Stewart Farrar, both of whom were initiated into the Alexandrian tradition by the Sanderses, describe themselves as having left the tradition after the release of &quot;Eight Sabbats for Witches&quot;. They were later referred to as &quot;Reformed Alexandrian&quot;, a description that Janet Farrar does not use preferring just to refer to herself and her initiates as witches. Chthonioi Alexandrian Wicca and the &quot;Starkindler Line&quot; are derived from Alexandrian Wicca, and Alexandrian Wicca was a major influence on Blue Star Wicca and Odyssean Wicca.

The High Magical and Qabalistic strands of the Alexandrian tradition also informed the &quot;Ordine Della Luna in Constantinople&quot; which, from 1967 onwards, Sanders operated as a &#x27;side-degree&#x27; or ancillary rite to Alexandrian Wicca, most notably in collaboration with Derek Taylor in the 1980s.

<text>The A46 is a major A road in England. It starts east of Bath, Somerset and ends in Cleethorpes, Lincolnshire, but it does not form a continuous route. Large portions of the old road have been lost, bypassed, or replaced by motorway development. Between Leicester and Lincoln the road follows the course of the Roman Fosse Way, but between Bath and Leicester, two cities also linked by the Fosse Way, it follows a more westerly course.

==History==
The original (1923) route of the A46 was from Bath to Laceby, passing through Cheltenham, Broadway, Stratford-on-Avon, Coventry, Leicester, Newark and Lincoln. Unusually for such a long road, no changes were made to its route until the 1970s. In recent years the central sections of the road have been rerouted and renumbered substantially, and there are now two sections where there are gaps of over where the road does not exist at all. The A46 has also been extended from Laceby to Grimsby and Cleethorpes – the road between Laceby and Grimsby was originally part of the A18.

The major realignments have been
*Between Coventry and Leicester the original road was downgraded to the B4065 and the B4114 as a result of the opening of the M69 motorway in 1977.
*Between Cheltenham and Stratford-on-Avon the road was realigned in the 1980s through Evesham on the former route of the A435 and A439. The original route through some of the most picturesque parts of the Cotswold Hills was downgraded to the B4632.
*The route was subsequently cut between Cheltenham and Teddington and that section became the A435 again. The A46 was diverted to connect with the M5 motorway on part of the former route of the A438.
*Between Evesham and north of Stratford the route was again realigned to run by Alcester and by-pass Stratford, partly on the former line of the A422. The previous route through Bidford-on-Avon to Stratford became the B439, and north of Stratford the old route became the A439.
*A new alignment was built from Junction 21a of the M1 to by-pass Leicester to the north. The old route through Leicester was redesignated the A5460 (Narborough Road, in the southwest) and A607 (Belgrave Road/Melton Road, in the northeast). The A607 deviates from the straight course of the Fosse Way, bypassing the village centres of Thurmaston and Syston.
*The A46 was realigned to by-pass Warwick, Kenilworth and Coventry, and the old route was redesignated the A429 and the A4600. It opened in June 1974.

Bypasses were also built around Market Rasen, Lincoln and Newark.

==Route==

===Cleethorpes – A1 (Newark)===
The A46 starts at Isaac&#x27;s Hill roundabout with the A1098 and the A180. It meets the A1031 at a roundabout and passes the King George V Stadium on the right. It meets the B1213 from the right, then crosses the A16 Peaks Parkway where it gains primary status. It heads into Grimsby, meeting the A1243 Bargate (former A16). It meets the B1444 where the road becomes a dual carriageway. It meets the A18 at a roundabout. This was the old terminus of the A46, and what is now the A46 heading east into Grimsby used to be the A18. The road becomes the single carriageway road once again and runs alongside the north part of the Lincolnshire Wolds. It bypasses Irby upon Humber and enters the East Midlands. It bypasses Swallow to the North. It climbs a hill to meet the B1225, A1173, and A1084 just east of Caistor. The road crosses the Nottingham – Grimsby railway at a level crossing. The road becomes very straight and flat, passing through Middle Rasen Plantation and meets the A1103 from the right. The A631 leaves to the right at a T junction. The road bypasses Dunholme to the south then it passes close to the former RAF Dunholme Lodge. It passes the headquarters for Lincolnshire Police on the left. It meets the A158 (for Skegness) and the B1182 (former route into Lincoln) at a roundabout.

The A46 Lincoln Relief Road is coincident with the A15. The A15 leaves to the right at a roundabout. The road becomes dual carriageway and traverses the Lincoln Cliff. It meets the A57 at the Carholme roundabout and crosses the Lincoln – Gainsborough railway. After bypassing Lincoln, it starts following the route of the old Fosse Way (bar bypasses). The A46 passes the former airfield of RAF Swinderby. The road becomes the boundary of Lincolnshire and Nottinghamshire for . The road enters Nottinghamshire and the road bypasses Brough. The new section of road finishes at the roundabout with the A1133. The A17 joins from the left at a roundabout.

===A1 (Newark) – M1 (Leicester)===

The road crosses the A1. Newark is bypassed to the North and West ending on a roundabout with the B6166. The road continues south-west, meeting the A6097 and A52 near Bingham. The single carriageway section between Newark and the Widmerpool A606 junction was replaced by a new dual carriageway road which was completed in April 2012. Heading South from the A606 junction, the existing dual carriageway still following the route of the Fosse Way. The road crosses the A6006 North of Six Hills. Syston is bypassed to the West, and at a roundabout with the A607 the route continues in a Westerly direction onto the Leicester Western Bypass. There are grade separated junctions with the A6, A5630 and A50. This section of the road ends at a junction with the B5380, with the forward route flowing on to the M1. It originally continued towards Coventry until the opening of the M69 motorway in the 1970s, which replaced the A46 as the main route between Leicester and Coventry, with the former A46 being downgraded.

===M6 (Coventry) – M5 (Tewkesbury)===
The A46 reappears at Coventry at junction 2 of the M6, it follows the boundary between the district of Rugby and the borough of Coventry, always staying inside Warwickshire. At Binley Woods the A428 is crossed at a roundabout. The next roundabout is the signal controlled Tollbar Roundabout, where there are exits for the A45 and Coventry Airport. There is a break in the road here, and it resumes again at Festival Island where it takes the southern exit on to the three-lane Kenilworth bypass. Along the bypass there are exits for Stoneleigh and the University of Warwick, Kenilworth and Leamington Spa (A452). At the Warwick (A429) exit, the bypass drops down to two lanes, closely followed by an exit for the A4177 and Warwick Parkway railway station. The M40 is passed over west of Longbridge roundabout, as a new bypass now brings the mainline carriageway away from Junction 15, the A46 meets a small roundabout, connecting with the B4463 and a link to Junction 15 for northbound A46 traffic to access the M40 and A429 respectively.

The dual carriageway section south of the improved Longbridge island is the only part of the A46 on its original routing between Leicester and Cheltenham. Stratford is bypassed to the north as a single carriageway road, crossing the A3400 and meeting the A422. Between here and Alcester the A46 is coincident with the A422, with the A46 taking priority. Alcester is bypassed to the south of the town. At a roundabout the A435 leaves to the North for Redditch and Birmingham. The A46 takes a dual carriageway route to the south towards Evesham, meeting the B439 at a roundabout near Bidford on Avon. Almost immediately after the roundabout, the road enters Worcestershire and Wychavon district, then goes back into Warwickshire, before going back into Worcestershire Near Harvington. At the northern end of the Evesham bypass, the A44 joins at a roundabout and becomes coincident with the A46. The next roundabout on the bypass is the B4035, followed by the A44 (for Oxford), The final roundabout on the bypass is with the A4184 and the A46 continues to head south. The villages of Sedgeberrow (bypassed) and Beckford are on the route. At the Teddington Hands roundabout, the A435 heads south to Cheltenham, while the A46 heads west. It passes Ashchurch close to Ashchurch for Tewkesbury railway station. This section of the A46 ends on the M5 roundabout at junction 9.

===Cheltenham – Bath===
After a gap filled in by the A435, the A46 reappears on its original route in the centre of Cheltenham. It then heads through Brockworth, Stroud, through Nailsworth, to the M4 motorway, where since 2003 access to the roundabout has been controlled by traffic lights. From the M4, the A46 heads to Bath, ending at its junction with the A4 to the east of the city. From here there is a continuous route to Southampton via the A36 and to Poole via the A350.

The £45 million dual-carriageway Batheaston/Swainswick Bypass, opened in summer 1996, contains of the A46. In February 1994, a camp was set up on Solsbury Hill, to protest the Batheaston bypass, however this was ultimately unsuccessful and construction was completed by November 1995.

A small section of the A46 between Painswick and Stroud subsided during the floods on Friday 29 July 2007 and was shut for over 6 months, causing quite an impact on the local area. The road re-opened on 15 February 2008.

* Coventry (Bypassed; northern section A4600; southern section now A429 [pre-1974 route], &lt;br&gt;or A444 and A4114 [1974 — 1989 route])
* Kenilworth and Warwick (Bypassed, now A429)
* Stratford (Bypassed, now A439 and B439)

===Downgrading===
* Leicester – Coventry (Downgraded to B4114 upon opening of the M69)
* Stratford – Cheltenham (Downgraded to B4632 upon diversion of route via Alcester and Evesham)

==Improvements==
* The M40 Longbridge Island bypass, a dual carriageway road which bypassed the M40 Junction 15 interchange, opened in December 2009, providing much needed relief for the junction.
* The Newark to Widmerpool Improvement is now complete and provides a new high quality grade-separated dual-carriageway which closes the gap in the corridor. Spring 2012 saw peripheral works progress and the entire project was completed by Summer 2012.
* The A45/A46 Tollbar End improvement is now complete and provides a grade separated junction, as well as improvements to the Stonebridge Highway. The project was open to traffic in December 2016.
* The A46/A428 Binley Junction Upgrade will provided a grade separated junction.
* The junction with Lincoln Road near Welton was replaced with a three-armed roundabout, primarily to reduce its high accident rate. Work was completed in June 2021.

===Proposed===

* The Sub-national Transport Body Midlands Connect prioritised the upgrading of the A46 in the Midlands Connect Strategy, published in March 2017, including a strategic study for a potential expressway route between the M5 and M40. In July 2018, Midlands Connect released &quot;Our Routes to Growth&quot; in which it described the first stage of its A46 corridor study, referring to the road as a &quot;national and international economic driver that connects the East and West Midlands to the South West and the North. Investing in infrastructure improvements along this route will create a resilient alternative to the existing motorway network for businesses and freight traffic.&quot; It reiterated the development a business case for upgrades to the A46 from the M40 to Syston and a strategic study for making the A46 an expressway between the M5 and M40. The first stage of this A46 study will be released before the end of 2018, with the second stage examining specific sections for more detailed development of possible improvements.

===Upcoming===

*Newark Bypass – will upgrade road to dual carriageway. Scheme expected to be completed by 2030.

<doc id="367448" wikidata="Q19775" url="?curid=367448" title="Potters Bar">
<text>Potters Bar is a town in Hertfordshire, England, north of central London. In 2011, it had a population of 21,882. In the 2021 census, the four wards that make up Potters Bar - Bentley Heath &amp; The Royds, Furzefield, Oakmere and Parkfield - had a combined population of 22,536; this includes several smaller outlying hamlets contained in the Bentley Heath &amp; The Royds ward, such as Bentley Heath and Ganwick Corner. In 2022, the population was around 23,325.

Within the historic county of Middlesex until 1965, the town dates to the early 13th century but remained a small, mainly agricultural, settlement until the arrival of the Great Northern Railway in 1850. It is now part of the London commuter belt.

==Etymology==
The origin of the &quot;Potters&quot; element of the town&#x27;s name is uncertain; it is generally thought to be either a reference to a Roman pottery, believed to have been sited locally, or alternatively to the &quot;Pottere&quot; family who lived in neighbouring South Mimms parish. 

The &quot;Bar&quot; is thought to refer to the gates leading from the South Mimms parish and into the Enfield Chase parish; it could possibly hail from a toll on the Great North Road, said to have been by what is now the disused &quot;Green Man&quot; pub or at the current entrance to Morven House.

==History==
Potters Bar is located on the Great North Road, one of two road routes from the City of London to the north of England. The road was originally numbered as the A1 and later the A1000.

Potters Bar was historically part of Middlesex and formed the Potters Bar Urban District of that county from 1934. From 1894 to 1934 its area had formed the South Mimms Rural District. In 1965, the district was transferred to Hertfordshire County Council, while most of the rest of Middlesex County Council became part of Greater London.

The urban district covered an area of . In 1939, it had a population of 13,681, increasing to 24,613 in 1971. In 1974, the urban district was abolished and the area became part of the borough of Hertsmere. Having been part of Middlesex, the area continued to form part of the Metropolitan Police District; with the creation of the Greater London Authority, it was transferred to the Hertfordshire Constabulary in 2000.

===Byng family===
Wrotham Park estate, home of the Byng family, sits within Potters Bar and Barnet on 2,500 acres of land. The Byng family still own a lot of land in the Potters Bar area; &quot;The Admiral Byng&quot; pub in Darkes Lane is named after Admiral John Byng, who was executed for failing to obey orders in the Minorca campaign.

===Zeppelin L31===
In the early hours of 1 October 1916, Lieutenant Wulstan Tempest shot down Germany&#x27;s most famous zeppelin, the L31. It was captained by Heinrich Mathy with his crew of 18. All were killed when the flaming zeppelin fell into an ancient oak tree on the Oakmere Estate, Oakmere House at the time being rented by Mrs Forbes. The deadly raids over England declined after this. The 19 German sailors (zeppelins were naval) were buried in the local cemetery and, decades later, reinterred at Cannock Chase German Military Cemetery. The Potters Bar Museum has a Zeppelin display, with relics of the L31.

==Demographics==
As of the 2021 census, Potters Bar still had a Christian majority, making it more Christian than both England and Wales as a whole and the rest of Hertsmere. Potters Bar has a significant Jewish community and an Orthodox synagogue but, as a percentage of the overall population, the Jewish community, which numbers over 600, pales in comparison to every other settlement in Hertsmere, the most Jewish borough in the country.

==Geography==
===Climate===
Potters Bar experiences an oceanic climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Cfb&quot;) similar to almost all of the United Kingdom.
==Transport==
===Roads===
The A1 was built as a major arterial road and a crossroads at Bignells Corner linked it to the Barnet–St Albans road. Potters Bar is now also served by junctions 23 and 24 of the M25 motorway.

===Railway===
Potters Bar railway station is sited on the East Coast Main Line. Govia Thameslink Railway operates services on the Great Northern Route under two sub-brands:
* Great Northern:
** , and to 
** to 
* Thameslink, at peak hours only:
** Welwyn Garden City to , via , and .

Potters Bar was the location of two major rail accidents in 1946 and 2002.

The nearest London Underground station is at Cockfosters, on the Piccadilly line; it is approximately south on the A111 from junction 24 of the M25.

===Buses===
Potters Bar has a bus depot that services local and London bus routes. Key routes include:

==Churches==
There are eight churches in Potters Bar. These include St Mary the Virgin and All Saints&#x27; Church at the top of the Walk, the first Anglican parish in the town created from the parish of South Mimms in the 1800s. The Church contains stained glass including some &quot;fine portraits&quot; of several saints as well as tributes to John Keble, and Randall Davidson. There is a Madonna Window in memory of John Goodacre, a long-time schoolmaster at Potters Bar. Other churches include Our Lady and St Vincent (Roman Catholic), King Charles the Martyr, Christ Church, Potters Bar Baptist Church, St John&#x27;s Methodist Church and the Causeway Free Church. Potters Bar Spiritualist Church is on Hill Rise. There was briefly a Salvation Army in Station Road. There is also the Jain Temple at the Oshwal Centre, which &quot;recreates a general Māru-Gurjara aesthetic&quot;.

==Education==
There are six primary and infant state schools in Potters Bar and the surrounding area; they are Cranborne School, Ladbrooke JMI, Little Heath Primary, Oakmere Primary, Pope Paul RC Primary and Wroxham School.

<doc id="367453" wikidata="Q215754" url="?curid=367453" title="Energy drink">
<text>An energy drink is a type of functional beverage containing stimulant compounds, usually caffeine, which is marketed as providing mental and physical stimulation (marketed as &quot;energy&quot;, but distinct from food energy). They may or may not be carbonated and may also contain sugar, other sweeteners, or herbal extracts, among numerous other possible ingredients.

They are a subset of the larger group of energy products, which includes bars and gels, and distinct from sports drinks, which are advertised to enhance sports performance. There are many brands and varieties in this drink category.

Energy drinks have the effects of caffeine and sugar, but there is little or no evidence that the wide variety of other ingredients have any effect. Most effects of energy drinks on cognitive performance, such as increased attention and reaction speed, are primarily due to the presence of caffeine. Other studies ascribe those performance improvements to the effects of the combined ingredients.

Advertising for energy drinks usually features increased muscle strength and endurance, but there is no scientific consensus to support these claims. Energy drinks have been associated with many health risks, such as an increased rate of injury when usage is combined with alcohol, and excessive or repeated consumption can lead to cardiac and psychiatric conditions. Populations at risk for complications from energy drink consumption include youth, caffeine-naive or caffeine-sensitive, pregnant, competitive athletes and people with underlying cardiovascular disease.

==Ingredients and uses==
Energy drinks are usually marketed to young people and provide the health effects of caffeine. Health experts agree that energy drinks which contain caffeine do improve alertness.

There is no reliable evidence that other ingredients in energy drinks provide further benefits, even though the drinks are frequently advertised in a way that suggests they have unique benefits. The dietary supplements in energy drinks may be purported to supply benefits, such as for vitamin B12, but no claims of using supplements to enhance health in otherwise normal people have been verified scientifically.

Marketing of energy drinks has been particularly directed towards teenagers, with manufacturers sponsoring or advertising at extreme sports events and music concerts, and targeting a youthful audience through social media channels.

== Effects ==
Energy drinks have the effects caffeine and sugar provide, but there is little or no evidence that the wide variety of other ingredients have any effect. Most of the effects of energy drinks on cognitive performance, such as increased attention and reaction speed, are primarily due to the presence of caffeine. Advertising for energy drinks usually features increased muscle strength and endurance, but there is little evidence to support this in the scientific literature.

According to the Mayo Clinic, it is safe for the typical healthy adult to consume a total of 400 mg of caffeine a day. This has been confirmed by a panel of the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), which also concludes that a caffeine intake of up to 400 mg per day does not raise safety concerns for adults. According to the EFSA this is equivalent to 4 cups of coffee (90 mg each) or 2 1/2 standard cans (250 ml) of energy drink (160 mg each/80 mg per serving). Adverse effects associated with caffeine consumption in amounts greater than 400 mg include nervousness, irritability, sleeplessness, increased urination, abnormal heart rhythms (arrhythmia), and dyspepsia. In the United States, caffeine dosage is not required to be displayed on product labels for food. However, companies often place the caffeine content of their drinks on the label regardless, and some advocates are urging the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to change this practice.

=== Health problems ===
Excessive consumption of energy drinks can have serious health effects resulting from high caffeine and sugar intakes, particularly in children, teens, and young adults. Excessive energy drink consumption may disrupt teens&#x27; sleep patterns and may be associated with increased risk-taking behavior. Excessive or repeated consumption of energy drinks can lead to cardiac problems, such as arrhythmias and heart attacks, and psychiatric conditions such as anxiety and phobias. The consumption of caffeinated energy drinks has been associated with adverse effects on cardiovascular health, including increased heart rate and blood pressure, which can pose risks for individuals with underlying heart conditions. In Europe, energy drinks containing sugar and caffeine have been associated with the deaths of athletes. Reviews have noted that caffeine content was not the only factor, and that the cocktail of other ingredients in energy drinks made them more dangerous than drinks whose only stimulant was caffeine; the studies noted that more research and government regulation were needed.

The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that children not consume caffeinated energy drinks.

==History==

Dr. Enuf, an &quot;energy building&quot; soft drink containing caffeine and B vitamins, was created in the United States in 1949. &quot;The New York Times&quot; states that &quot;the energy drink, as we know it&quot;, however, was born in post World War II Japan. In 1962, Taisho Pharmaceutical produced Lipovitan D, a herbal &quot;energizing tonic&quot; that was sold in minibar-sized bottles. The tonic was originally marketed towards truck drivers and factory workers who needed to stay awake for long shifts. However, in Japan, most of the products of this kind bear little resemblance to soft drinks, and are sold instead in small brown glass medicine bottles, or cans styled to resemble such containers. These (literally, ) are marketed primarily to &quot;salarymen&quot;. Bacchus-F, a South Korean drink closely modeled after Lipovitan, also appeared in the early 1960s and targets a similar demographic.

In Europe, Dietrich Mateschitz, an Austrian entrepreneur, introduced the Red Bull product, a worldwide bestseller in the 21st century. Mateschitz developed Red Bull based on the Thai drink Krating Daeng, itself based on Lipovitan. Red Bull became the dominant brand in the US after its introduction in 1997, with a market share of approximately 47% in 2005.

In New Zealand and Australia, the leading energy drink product in those markets, V, was introduced by Frucor Beverages. The product now represents over 60% of market in New Zealand and Australia.

In 2002, Hansen Natural Company introduced the energy drink Monster Energy. Hansen Natural Company changed their name to Monster Beverage Corporation after an agreement by shareholders to change the name after Monster Energy became the largest source of revenue. The company&#x27;s previous beverages were taken ownership of by the Coca-Cola Company.

The energy shot product, an offshoot of the energy drink, was launched in the US with products such as 5-Hour Energy, which was first released onto the market in 2004. A consumer health analyst explained in a March 2014 media article: &quot;Energy shots took off because of energy drinks. If you&#x27;re a white collar worker, you&#x27;re not necessarily willing to down a big Monster energy drink, but you may drink an energy shot.&quot;

In 2007, energy drink powders and effervescent tablets were introduced, whereby either can be added to water to create an energy drink.

On 14 August 2012, the word &quot;energy drink&quot; was listed for the first time in the Merriam-Webster&#x27;s &quot;Collegiate Dictionary&quot;.

==Variants==
===By concentration===
====Energy shots====

Energy shots are a specialized kind of energy drink. Whereas most energy drinks are sold in cans or bottles, energy shots are usually sold in smaller 50ml bottles. Energy shots can contain the same total amount of caffeine, vitamins or other functional ingredients as their larger versions, and may be considered concentrated forms of energy drinks. The marketing of energy shots generally focuses on their convenience and availability as a low-calorie &quot;instant&quot; energy drink that can be taken in one swallow (or &quot;shot&quot;), as opposed to energy drinks that encourage users to drink an entire can, which may contain 250 calories or more. A common energy shot is 5-hour Energy which contains B vitamins and caffeine, with caffeine content in an amount similar to that in a cup of coffee.

===By ingredient===

==== Caffeinated alcoholic drink ====

Energy drinks such as Red Bull are often used as mixers with alcoholic drinks, producing mixed drinks such as Vodka Red Bull which are similar to but stronger than rum and coke with respect to the amount of caffeine that they contain. Sometimes this is configured as a bomb shot, such as the Jägerbomb or the &quot;F-Bomb&quot;—Fireball Cinnamon Whisky and Red Bull.

Caffeinated alcoholic drinks are also sold in some countries in a wide variety of formulations. The American products Four Loko and Joose originally combined caffeine and alcohol before caffeinated alcoholic drinks were banned in the US in 2010.

==Chemistry==

Energy drinks generally contain methylxanthines (including caffeine), B vitamins, carbonated water, and high-fructose corn syrup or sugar (for non-diet versions). Other common ingredients are guarana, yerba mate, açaí, and taurine, plus various forms of ginseng, maltodextrin, inositol, carnitine, creatine, glucuronolactone, sucralose or ginkgo biloba.

In the United States, the caffeine content of energy drinks is in the range of 40 to 250 mg per 8 fluid ounce (237 ml) serving. The FDA recommends that 400 mg per day is safe for adults, while 1200 mg per day can be toxic.

==Demographics==
Globally, energy drinks are typically attractive to youths and young adults.

==Sales and trends==
In 2017, global energy drink sales were about 44 billion euros. In 2017, manufacturers were modifying the composition of energy drinks for reduced or no sugar content and lower calories, caffeine content, &quot;clean&quot; labels to reflect the use of organic ingredients, exotic flavors, and ingredients that may affect mood.

=== Market share ===
In 2020, Red Bull had the largest global market share among energy drinks, at 43%, followed by Monster Energy at 39%, Rockstar Energy at 10%, and Amp and NOS, at 3% each.

==Regulations==

Some countries have certain restrictions on the sale and manufacture of energy drinks. A ban was challenged in the European Court of Justice in 2004 and consequently lifted.

===Australia and New Zealand===
In Australia and New Zealand, energy drinks are regulated under the Australia New Zealand Food Standards Code; limiting the caffeine content of &#x27;formulated caffeinated beverages&#x27; (energy drinks) at 320 mg/L (9.46 mg/oz) and soft-drinks at 145 mg/L (4.29 mg/oz). Mandatory caffeine labeling is issued for all food products containing guarana in the country, and Australian energy drink labels warn consumers to drink no more than two cans per day.
Bridgetown in Western Australia became the first place in Australia to ban the sale of energy drinks to persons under 18 years for four months as of February 2023.

===Canada===
Canada limits the amount of caffeine per serving to 180 mg. Energy drinks are also subject to certain labelling requirements. Some imported energy drinks have surpassed the legal limit and were recalled. The Canada Border Services Agency is supposed to stop such products from entering the country but does not often patrol energy drinks to verify that they meet regulations.

===Colombia===
In 2009 under the Ministry of Social Protection, Colombia prohibited the sale and commercialization of energy drinks to minors under the age of 14.

=== Denmark ===
In 1997, Denmark banned the sale of Red Bull. The Danish Veterinary and Food Administration criticized the functional beverages&#x27; added ingredients such as B vitamins, inositol, glucuronolactone, and taurine. It argued that nutritional supplements should be added to foods only when necessary for public health, such as in the case of iodised salt. High caffeine content was also stated as an issue – only amounts up to 150 mg/L were allowed in beverages; in 2009 the limit was raised to 320 mg/L and taurine and glucuronolactone were approved as ingredients, making energy drinks legal. , the Danish Veterinary and Food Administration advises against energy drink consumption for children; with only limited consumption of energy drinks ( per day, assuming no other caffeine intake) for children between 15 and 17 years old.

===Latvia===
In June 2016, Latvia banned the sale of energy drinks containing caffeine or stimulants like taurine and guarana to people under the age of 18.

===Lithuania===
In November 2014, Lithuania became the first country in the EU to ban the selling of energy drinks to anyone under the age of 18. The Baltic state placed the ban in reaction to research showing how popular energy drinks were among minors. According to the AFP reports roughly 10% of school-aged Lithuanians say they consume energy drinks at least once a week.

===Norway===
Norway did not allow Red Bull for a time due to the high caffeine and taurine content. Classified as a drug, only limited amounts were allowed to be imported for personal use. In May 2009, it became legal to sell in Norway as the ban was in conflict with the European Economic Area&#x27;s laws on free competition. The Norwegian version has reduced levels of vitamin B6. The Norwegian Food Safety Authority initially recommended an age limit on the sale of energy drinks in 2019. In 2024 the Norwegian Consumer Council called for an age limit after seeing energy drink sales increase dramatically since 2019. The Food Safety Authority, , now disagrees with an age limit as it states it is hard to ascertain if children, specifically, are drinking more energy drinks. A majority of Norwegians support an age limit on energy drink purchases.

===Poland===
Since 1 January 2024, the purchase of energy drinks has been prohibited for individuals under the age of 18.

===Russia===
In November 2012, President Ramzan Kadyrov of Chechnya (Russian Federation) ordered his government to develop a bill banning the sale of energy drinks, arguing that as a form of &quot;intoxicating drug&quot;, such drinks were &quot;unacceptable in a Muslim society&quot;. Kadyrov cited reports of one death and 530 hospital admissions in 2012 due to &quot;poisoning&quot; from the consumption of such drinks. A similar view was expressed by Gennady Onishchenko, Chief Sanitary Inspector of Russia.

===United Kingdom===
In 2001, the UK Committee on Toxicity investigated Red Bull, finding it safe but issuing a warning against its consumption by children and pregnant women.

In 2009, a school in Hove, England, requested that local shops refrain from selling energy drinks to students. Headteacher Falklanda Sanders added that &quot;This was a preventative measure, as all research shows that consuming high-energy drinks can have a detrimental impact on the ability of young people to concentrate in class.&quot; The school negotiated for their local branch of the Tesco supermarket to display posters asking students not to purchase the products. Similar measures were taken by a school in Oxted, England, which banned students from consuming drinks and sent letters to parents.

While not yet age-restricted by legislation, all major UK supermarkets have agreed to voluntarily stop the sale of energy drinks to under-16s. The UK government plans to end the sale of energy drinks to under-16s in the future.

In January 2018, many United Kingdom supermarkets banned the sale of energy drinks containing more than 150 mg of caffeine per liter to people under 16 years old; this was followed by the UK government announcing that it planned to ban all sales of energy drinks to minors in 2019. However, in 2022 such plans were reported to have been scrapped by Health Secretary Sajid Javid.

===United States===
As of 2013 in the United States, some energy drinks, including Monster Energy and Rockstar Energy, were reported to be rebranding their products as drinks rather than as dietary supplements. As drinks they would be relieved of FDA reporting requirements with respect to deaths and injuries and can be purchased with food stamps, but must list ingredients on the can.

Some places ban the sale of prepackaged caffeinated alcoholic drinks, which can be described as energy drinks containing alcohol. In response to these bans, the marketers can change the formula of their products.

===Uzbekistan===
In January 2019, President Shavkat Mirziyoyev of Uzbekistan signed a law that imposes a number of restrictions on energy drinks. To protect the younger generation, a rule was introduced prohibiting the sale of energy drinks to persons under the age of 18. Advertising of energy drinks was prohibited on television and radio from 7:00 to 22:00. It was also completely banned in printed publications intended primarily for children and adolescents, in medical, sports and educational institutions.

===India===
In India, the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) regulates the manufacturing, packaging, labeling, and sale of energy drinks. As recommended by FSSAI, taurine is limited to 2000 mg/day, D-glucuronic-Y-lactone is limited to 1200 mg/day, Inositol is limited to 100 mg/day, and pantothenic acid is limited to 10 mg/day.

=== Germany ===
There is no law regulating the sale of energy drinks in Germany, though several German consumer organizations and the Federal Institute for Risk Assessment are calling for a ban on the sale of soft drinks to minors with a caffeine content exceeding 150 milligrams per liter. In addition, retailers can decide for themselves to restrict the sale of energy drinks.

<text>Oenanthe, known as water dropworts, oenanthes, water parsleys, and water celeries, are a genus of plants in the family Apiaceae. Most of the species grow in damp ground, such as in marshes or in water.

Several of the species are extremely poisonous, the active poison being oenanthotoxin. The most notable of these is &quot;O. crocata&quot;, which lives in damp, marshy ground, and resembles celery with roots like a bunch of large white carrots. The leaves may be eaten safely by livestock, but the stems, and especially the carbohydrate-rich roots are much more poisonous. Animals familiar with eating the leaves may eat the roots when these are exposed during ditch clearance: one root is sufficient to kill a cow, and human fatalities are also known. It has been referred to as the most poisonous of all British plants, and is considered particularly dangerous because of its similarity to several edible plants.

The species &quot;O. javanica&quot;, commonly known as Chinese celery or Japanese parsley (&quot;seri&quot;; not to be confused with &quot;mitsuba&quot; or Japanese wild celery, &quot;Cryptotaenia japonica&quot;) is edible and grown in several countries of eastern Asia, as well as in Italy and India, where the spring growth is relished as a vegetable.

==Taxonomy and naming==
The name &quot;Oenanthe&quot; was used in ancient times to refer to several different plants, one of which was described by Pedanius Dioscorides as having &quot;white flowers... and many round heads.&quot; This was [mis]interpreted by medieval herbalists as dropwort or an umbellifer. By the 18th century it was being widely used for water-dropworts. For example, in Hortus Cliffortianus hemlock water-dropwort was called &quot;Oenanthe foliis omnibus multifidis obtusis subaequalidus&quot;. Linnaeus formalised it as a generic name in &quot;Species Plantarum&quot; in 1753.

Although the word is ultimately derived from the Ancient Greek οίνος, &quot;wine&quot; and άνθος, &quot;flower&quot;, this has no meaning when applied to the water-dropworts other than as an arbitrary name for the genus. Subsequent speculation that it refers to the smell of the flowers or intoxication caused by these plants are probably mistaken.

The word &quot;dropwort&quot; refers to the tubers produced amongst the roots of certain species in the genus.

===Species===
, Kew&#x27;s Plants of the World Online accepts 33 species of &quot;Oenanthe&quot;:
==Identification==

The following simplified key can be used to distinguish the six British water-dropworts, by eliminating them one by one. To use the key, a few terms are needed: bracts are small, leaf-like appendages at the bottom of the primary umbels; rays are the branches of the primary umbels; petioles are leaf stalks. Refer to the notes on the species pages to confirm the identification.

1. Plants with bracts and ovate leaflets... O. crocata

2. Plants with bracts and narrow leaflets, rays thickening in fruit... O. pimpinelloides

3. Plants with bracts and narrow leaflets, rays not thickening in fruit... O. lachenalii

4. No bracts, upper leaves with ovate segments... O. aquatica

5. No bracts, upper leaves with narrow segments, petiole hollow... O. fistulosa

6. No bracts, upper leaves with narrow segments, petiole solid, rays thickening in fruit... 
O. silaifolia

7. No bracts, upper leaves with narrow segments, petiole solid, rays not thickening in fruit... O. lachenalii

==Sardonic grin==
Scientists at the University of Eastern Piedmont wrote that they had identified hemlock water dropwort (&quot;Oenanthe crocata&quot;) as the plant responsible for producing the sardonic grin. This plant is a possible candidate for the &quot;sardonic herb&quot;, which was a neurotoxic plant referred to in ancient histories. It was purportedly used for the ritual killing of elderly people and criminals in Nuragic Sardinia, in which they were intoxicated with the herb and then dropped from a high rock or beaten to death.

==Fossil record==
&quot;Oenanthe aquatica&quot; fossil fruit halves have been recorded from Upper Miocene of Bulgaria, Pliocene of Thuringia and the Pliocene and Pleistocene of Poland.

<text>The London metropolitan area is the metropolitan area of London, England. It has several definitions, including the London Travel to Work Area, and usually consists of the London urban area, settlements that share London&#x27;s infrastructure, and places from which it is practicable to commute to work in London. It is also known as the London commuter belt, or Southeast metropolitan area.

==Scope==
The boundaries are not fixed; they expand as transport options improve and affordable housing moves further away from the city centre. The belt currently covers much of the South East region and part of the East of England region, including the home counties of Hertfordshire, Buckinghamshire, Berkshire, Surrey, Kent and Essex, and, by several definitions, Hampshire, West Sussex, East Sussex, Bedfordshire.

The resident population of Greater London and those counties (partly) within the Metropolitan Green Belt was 18,868,800 in 2011. Much of the undeveloped part of this area lies within the designated belt, which, save as to existing buildings, yards and gardens, covers nearly all of Surrey, eastern Berkshire, southern Buckinghamshire, southern and mid Hertfordshire, southern Bedfordshire, south-west Essex, and north-western Kent. Largely in these counties, three Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty (the Chiltern Hills, Surrey Hills and North Downs AONBs) surrounding the Thames basin are within the commuter belt.

==Definitions==
===Travel to work area===

The London travel to work area, defined by the Office for National Statistics as the area for which &quot;of the resident economically active population, at least 75% actually work in the area, and also, that of everyone working in the area, at least 75% actually live in the area.&quot; has a population of 9,294,800 (2005 estimate).

This TTWA excludes some parts of Greater London such as Uxbridge, Hounslow and Kingston which form part of the Heathrow TTWA. Conversely it includes areas beyond Greater London such as Rickmansworth, Broxbourne, Grays, Dartford, Gravesend and Epsom.

===Environs of Greater London===
There are 17 local government districts that share a boundary with Greater London, in the East and South East regions. Most districts are entirely, or have sections, within the M25 motorway or are within of Charing Cross.

Adjacent districts often share characteristics of Outer London, such as forming part of the continuous urban sprawl, being served by the London Underground, being covered by the London telephone area code, (until 2000) forming part of the Metropolitan Police District and having a relatively high employed population working in London.

===London&#x27;s Larger Urban Zone===
Larger Urban Zone is a definition created in 2004 by Eurostat that measures the population and expanse of metropolitan areas across European countries. Based on the 2001 census, the population of London&#x27;s Larger Urban Zone was 11.9 million, ranking it as the most populous metropolitan area in the European Union until Brexit. The districts that are considered parts of this Larger Urban Zone are listed here: (no district in Bedfordshire, Hampshire, or Sussex is included). Several large conurbations fall just outside the zone: Reading, Luton, High Wycombe and significant parts of the Aldershot and Crawley Urban Areas.

===Urban areas within the commuter belt===

The following table lists urban areas (also known as built-up areas) considered part of the London Commuter Belt with populations over 20,000. The commuter belt contains all urban areas within an approximate 40 mile (64 km) radius of Charing Cross. Some of the outermost towns include Aylesbury, Reading, Aldershot and Maidstone.


===Outer commuter belt===
Some estate agents, including James Pendleton and Savills, have defined a &#x27;second commuter belt&#x27; further away from London. The definition includes places up to approximately 55 miles (89 km) from central London, including Bedford, Brighton, Cambridge, Hastings, Margate, Milton Keynes and Oxford.

<doc id="367461" wikidata="Q10995" url="?curid=367461" title="Pholcidae">
<text>The Pholcidae are a family of araneomorph spiders. The family contains more than 1,800 individual species of pholcids, including those commonly known as cellar spider, daddy long-legs spider, carpenter spider, daddy long-legger, vibrating spider, gyrating spider, long daddy, and angel spider. The family, first described by Carl Ludwig Koch in 1850, is divided into 94 genera.

The common name &quot;daddy long-legs&quot; is used for several species, especially &quot;Pholcus phalangioides&quot;, but is also the common name for several other arthropod groups, including harvestmen and crane flies.

==Appearance==
Pholcids have extremely long and thin legs with flexible tarsi. They can be distinguished from other long-legged spiders by the eye arrangement: Pholcidae have two groups of three eyes each, and there may be a pair of small eyes in between them. Most have this middle pair present for a total of eight eyes, but some genera (e.g. &quot;Modisimus&quot;, &quot;Spermophora&quot;, &quot;Spermophorides&quot;) lack this pair and have a total of six eyes. The body is often whitish or grey in colour. Harvestmen (Opiliones), which share the name &quot;daddy longlegs&quot;, also have long and thin legs but have only one pair of eyes, and their body appears to be a single segment.

Like other spiders, pholcids have two body segments, the prosoma and opisthosoma. The prosoma may be evenly domed (e.g. &quot;Pholcus&quot;, &quot;Micropholcus&quot;) or have a furrow or pit in the middle. The opisthosoma may be long and cylindrical (e.g. &quot;Pholcus&quot;, &quot;Holocnemus&quot;), long and pointed dorso-posteriorly (e.g. &quot;Crossopriza&quot;) or short (e.g. &quot;Micropholcus&quot;).

There is variation in size, ranging from just over 1 millimetre (&quot;Spermophorides lascars&quot;) to 11 mm (&quot;Artema atlanta&quot;) in body length.

==Habitat==
Pholcids are found in every continent in the world except Antarctica. Pholcids hang inverted in their messy and irregular-shaped webs. These webs are constructed in dark and damp recesses such as in caves, under rocks and loose bark, and in abandoned mammal burrows. In areas of human habitation pholcids construct webs in undisturbed areas in buildings such as high corners, attics and cellars, hence the common name &quot;cellar spider&quot;.

==Behavior==
===Trapping===
The web of pholcids has no adhesive properties and instead relies on its irregular structure to trap prey. When pholcid spiders detect prey within their webs the spiders quickly envelop prey with silk-like material. The prey may be eaten immediately or stored for later. When finished feeding they will clean the web by unhooking the remains of the prey and letting the carcass drop from the web. They are passive against humans.

===Threat response===
Some species of Pholcidae exhibit a threat response when disturbed by a touch to the web or entangled large prey. The arachnid responds by vibrating rapidly in a gyrating motion in its web, which may sometimes fall into a circular rhythm. It may oscillate in tune with the elasticity of the web causing an oscillation larger than the motion of the spider&#x27;s legs. While other species of spider exhibit this behaviour, such behavior by the Pholcidae species has led to these spiders sometimes being called &quot;vibrating spiders&quot;. There are several proposed reasons for this threat response. The movement may make it difficult for a predator to locate or strike the spider, or may be a signal to an assumed rival to leave. Vibrating may also increase the chances of capturing insects that have just brushed their web and are still hovering nearby, or further entangle prey that may have otherwise been able to free itself. If the spider continues to be disturbed it will retreat into a corner or drop from its web and escape.

===Diet===
Although they do eat insects, certain species of these spiders invade webs of other spiders to eat the host, the eggs, or the prey. In some cases the spider vibrates the web of other spiders, mimicking the struggle of trapped prey to lure the host closer. Pholcids prey on &quot;Tegenaria&quot; funnel weaver spiders, and are known to attack and eat redback spiders, huntsman spiders and house spiders.
Pholcids may be beneficial to humans living in regions with dense hobo spider populations as predation on &quot;Tegenaria&quot; may keep populations in check. They have also been observed to feed on the spider &quot;Steatoda nobilis&quot; in countries like Ireland and England.

===Gait===
&quot;Pholcus phalangioides&quot; often uses an alternating tetrapod gait (first right leg, then second left leg, then third right leg, etc.), which is commonly found in many spider species. However, frequent variations from this pattern have been documented during observations of the spiders&#x27; movements.

==Misconceptions==
There is an urban legend that daddy long-legs spiders have the most potent venom of any spider but that their fangs are either too small or too weak to puncture human skin; the same legend is also repeated of the harvestman and crane fly, also known as daddy long-legs in some regions. This is not true for any of the three. Pholcidae are indeed capable of biting humans and their venom is not medically significant, and neither harvestmen nor crane flies have any venom or fangs to speak of. Indeed, pholcid spiders do have a short fang structure (called uncate due to its &quot;hooked&quot; shape). Brown recluse spiders also have uncate fang structure, but are able to deliver medically significant bites.

Possible explanations include: pholcid venom is not toxic to humans; pholcid uncate are smaller than those of brown recluse; or there is a musculature difference between the two arachnids, with recluses, being hunting spiders, possessing stronger muscles for fang penetration. According to Rick Vetter of the University of California, Riverside, the daddy long-legs spider has never harmed a human, and there is no evidence that they are dangerous to humans.

The legend may result from the fact that the daddy long-legs spider preys upon deadly venomous spiders, such as the redback, and other members of the true widow genus &quot;Latrodectus&quot;. To the extent that such arachnological information was known to the general public, it was perhaps thought that if the daddy long-legs spider could kill a spider capable of delivering fatal bites to humans, then it must be more venomous, and the uncate fangs were regarded as prohibiting it from killing people. In reality, it is able to cast lengths of silk onto its prey, incapacitating them from a safe distance.

===&quot;Mythbusters&quot; experiment===
During 2004, the Discovery Channel television show &quot;MythBusters&quot; tested the daddy long-legs venom myth in episode 13, &quot;Buried in Concrete&quot;. Hosts Jamie Hyneman and Adam Savage first established that the spider&#x27;s venom was not as toxic as other venoms, after being told about an experiment whereby mice were injected with venom from both a daddy long-legs and a black widow, with the black widow venom producing a much stronger reaction. After measuring the spider&#x27;s fangs at approximately 0.25 mm, Adam Savage inserted his hand into a container with several daddy-long-legs, and reported that he felt a bite which produced a mild, short-lived burning sensation. The bite did in fact penetrate his skin, but did not cause any notable harm. Additionally, recent research has shown that pholcid venom is relatively weak in its effects on insects.

<text>The Bruneau River is a tributary of the Snake River in the western United States, located in Idaho and Nevada. It runs through a narrow canyon cut into ancient lava flows in southwestern Idaho. The Bruneau Canyon, which is up to deep and long, features rapids and hot springs, making it a popular whitewater trip.

The Bruneau River&#x27;s drainage basin is bounded by the Jarbidge Mountains to the southeast, the Owyhee Mountains and Chalk Hills to the west, and the Bruneau Plateau to the east.

==Course==

The Bruneau River system originates within and near the Jarbidge and Mountain City Ranger Districts of the Humboldt–Toiyabe National Forest in northern Elko County. The three main streams are the East Fork Bruneau River, the West Fork Bruneau River, and the Jarbidge River, all of which flow generally north. The Jarbidge River joins the West Fork, then the East and West Forks join to form the mainstem Bruneau River. Sheep Creek and Jacks Creek join from the west, and Clover Creek joins from the east. Most of the watershed is characterized by high plateaus through which the Bruneau and its tributaries cut deep, sheer canyons, especially along the middle Bruneau River and the lower reaches of the Jarbidge River, Sheep Creek, and the East Fork Bruneau.

The Bruneau River emerges from the plateau and canyon region upstream from its mouth at the Snake River&#x27;s C. J. Strike Reservoir. At this point, the river enters the broad and fertile Snake River Plain. This lower section of the watershed is occupied by farms and ranches, and the town of Bruneau.

==River modifications==

The Bruneau River is used for irrigation purposes near the Snake River. Irrigation withdrawals result in a number of its tributary streams being largely dewatered annually.

==History==
The Bruneau River region was historically occupied by the Northern Shoshone, Northern Paiute, and Bannock tribes

The Bruneau River was given its name sometime before 1821 by French Canadian Pierre Bruneau (1796–1873) voyageurs working for the Montreal-based fur trading North West Company. The name is derived from the French meaning &quot;dark water&quot;.

Bruneau jasper, a semi-precious gemstone, was discovered near the bottom of the Bruneau River canyon walls and named after the river.

==Recreation and protected areas==

Much of the mainstem Bruneau River above Hot Spring is designated as a Wild and Scenic River, as are parts of the West Fork and East Fork and some of Sheep Creek. The Jarbidge Wilderness covers a portion of the southern end of the Bruneau watershed. The Bruneau River is protected in the new Bruneau - Jarbidge Rivers Wilderness, which was created by the Omnibus Public Land Management Act of 2009 and signed into law on March 30, 2009. The new wilderness area includes the Bruneau from about five miles upstream of the Jarbidge River confluence down nearly to the confluence with Hot Creek, as well as portions of Sheep Creek and Clover Creek.

Whitewater rafting and kayaking opportunities exist on the Bruneau and Jarbidge Rivers. The Jarbridge canyon contains stretches of whitewater with class 5 and class 6 rapids from both recent and distant canyon wall collapses. From the bridge below the confluence of West Fork at Indian hot spring to the take out, it is class 3 dominant with just a couple rapids that reach class 4 at flows between 1600–3000 cfs.

<text>The City of London Corporation, officially and legally the Mayor and Commonalty and Citizens of the City of London, is the local authority of the City of London, the historic centre of London and the location of much of the United Kingdom&#x27;s financial sector.

In 2006, the name was changed from Corporation of London as the corporate body needed to be distinguished from the geographical area to avoid confusion with the wider London local government, the Greater London Authority. It is a corporation in the sense of being a municipal corporation rather than a company; it is deemed to be the citizens and other eligible parties acting as one corporate body to manage the City&#x27;s affairs.

Both businesses and residents of the City, or &quot;Square Mile&quot;, are entitled to vote in corporation elections. In addition to its functions as the local authority (analogous to those undertaken by the 32 boroughs that administer the rest of Greater London) the City of London Corporation takes responsibility for supporting the financial services industry and representing its interests. The corporation&#x27;s structure includes the Lord Mayor, the Court of Aldermen, the Court of Common Council, and the Freemen and Livery of the City.
The &quot;Liberties and Customs&quot; of the City of London are guaranteed in Magna Carta&#x27;s clause IX, which remains in statute.

== History ==

In the Anglo-Saxon period, consultation between London&#x27;s rulers and its citizens took place at the Folkmoot. Administration and judicial processes were conducted at the Court of Husting and the administrative part of the court&#x27;s work evolved into the Court of Aldermen.

There is no surviving record of a charter first establishing the corporation as a legal body, but the City is regarded as incorporated by prescription, meaning that the law presumes it to have been incorporated because it has for so long been regarded as such (e.g. Magna Carta states that &quot;the City of London shall have/enjoy its ancient liberties&quot;). The City of London Corporation has been granted various special privileges since the Norman Conquest, and the Corporation&#x27;s first recorded royal charter dates from around 1067, when William the Conqueror granted the citizens of London a charter confirming the rights and privileges that they had enjoyed since the time of Edward the Confessor. Numerous subsequent royal charters over the centuries confirmed and extended the citizens&#x27; rights.

Around 1189, the City gained the right to have its own mayor, later being advanced to the degree and style of Lord Mayor of London. Over time, the Court of Aldermen sought increasing help from the City&#x27;s commoners and this was eventually recognised with commoners being represented by the Court of Common Council, known by that name since at least as far back as 1376. The earliest records of the business habits of the City&#x27;s chamberlains and common clerks, and the proceedings of the courts of Common Council and Aldermen, begin in 1275, and are recorded in fifty volumes known as the Letter-Books of the City of London.

The City of London Corporation had its privileges stripped by a writ &quot;quo warranto&quot; under Charles II in 1683, but they were later restored and confirmed by Act of Parliament under William III and Mary II in 1690, after the Glorious Revolution.

With growing demands on the Corporation and a corresponding need to raise local taxes from the commoners, the Common Council grew in importance and has been the principal governing body of the City of London since the 18th century.

In January 1898, the Common Council gained the full right to collect local rates when the City of London Sewers Act 1897 transferred the powers and duties of the Commissioners of Sewers of the City of London to the Corporation. A separate Commission of Sewers was created for the City of London after the Great Fire in 1666, and as well as the construction of drains it had responsibility for the prevention of flooding; paving, cleaning and lighting the City of London&#x27;s streets; and churchyards and burials. The individual commissioners were previously nominated by the Corporation, but it was a separate body. The Corporation had earlier limited rating powers in relation to raising funds for the City of London Police, as well as the militia rate and some rates in relation to the general requirements of the Corporation.

The Corporation is unique among British local authorities for its continuous legal existence over many centuries, and for having the power to alter its own constitution, which is done by an Act of Common Council.

== Local authority role ==

Local government legislation often makes special provision for the City to be treated as a London borough and for the Common Council to act as a local authority. The Corporation does not have general authority over the Middle Temple and the Inner Temple, two of the Inns of Court adjoining the west of the City which are historic extra-parochial areas, but many statutory functions of the Corporation are extended into these two areas.

The chief executive of the administrative side of the Corporation holds the ancient office of Town Clerk of London.

== High Officers and other officials ==

Because of its accumulated wealth and responsibilities, the Corporation has a number of officers and officials unique to its structure who enjoy more autonomy than most local council officials, and each of whom has a separate budget:
#The Town Clerk, who is also the chief executive.
#The Chamberlain, the City Treasurer and Finance Officer.
#The City Remembrancer, who is responsible for protocol, ceremonial, and security issues as well as legislative matters that may affect the Corporation and is legally qualified (usually a barrister).
#The City Surveyor, who is responsible for the central London commercial property portfolio 
#The Comptroller and City Solicitor; legal officer.
#The Recorder of London, the senior judge at the Central Criminal Court &#x27;Old Bailey&#x27; who is technically a member of the Court of Aldermen; but without precedence, he processes between the senior aldermen, i.e. former lord mayors, and the junior aldermen.
#The Common Serjeant, the second senior judge at the Central Criminal Court (&#x27;Old Bailey&#x27;), technically the legal adviser to the Common Council (&quot;i.e.&quot;, Serjeant at Law to the Commoners).
There are others:

== Elections ==

The first direct elections to Common Council took place in 1384. Before that date the representatives of the wards had been elected by the livery companies; originally they were merely appointed by the aldermen.

The City of London Corporation was not reformed by the Municipal Corporations Act 1835, because it had a more extensive electoral franchise than any other borough or city; in fact, it widened this further with its own equivalent legislation allowing one to become a freeman without being a liveryman. In 1801, the City had a population of about 130,000, but increasing development of the City as a central business district led to this falling to below 5,000 after the Second World War. It has risen slightly to around 9,000 since, largely due to the development of the Barbican Estate. As it has not been affected by other municipal legislation over the period of time since then, its electoral practice has become increasingly anomalous.

Therefore, the non-residential vote (or business vote), abolished in the rest of the country in 1969, became an increasingly large part of the electorate. The non-residential vote system used disfavoured incorporated companies. The City of London (Ward Elections) Act 2002 greatly increased the business franchise, allowing many more businesses to be represented. In 2009, the business vote was about 24,000, greatly exceeding residential voters.

=== Voters ===
Eligible voters must be at least 18 years old and a citizen of the United Kingdom, or a Commonwealth country, and either:
* A resident;
* A sole trader, or a partner in an unlimited partnership, or;
* An appointee of a qualifying body.

Each body or organisation, whether unincorporated or incorporated, whose premises are within the City of London may appoint a number of voters based on the number of workers it employs. Limited liability partnerships fall into this category.

Bodies employing fewer than ten workers may appoint one voter, those employing ten to fifty workers may appoint one voter for every five; those employing more than fifty workers may appoint ten voters and one additional voter for every fifty workers beyond the first fifty.

Though workers count as part of a workforce regardless of nationality, only certain individuals may be appointed as voters. Under section 5 of the City of London (Ward Elections) Act 2002, the following are eligible to be appointed as voters (the qualifying date is 1 September of the year of the election):
*Those who have worked for the body for the past year at premises in the City;
*Those who have served on the body&#x27;s board of directors for the past year at premises in the City;
*Those who have worked in the City for the body for an aggregate total of five years;
*Those who have worked mainly in the City for a total of ten years and still do so or have done within the last five years.

Voters appointed by businesses who are also entitled to vote in a local authority district other than the City, due to their residence in that district, maintain the right to vote in their &#x27;home&#x27; district.

=== Wards ===

The City of London is divided into twenty-five wards, each of which is an electoral division, electing one alderman and a number of councilmen based on the size of the electorate. The numbers below reflect the changes caused by the &quot;City of London (Ward Elections) Act&quot; and a recent ward boundary review.

=== Livery companies ===
There are over one hundred &quot;livery companies&quot; in London. The companies originated as guilds or trade associations. The senior members of the livery companies, known as liverymen, form a special electorate known as Common Hall. Common Hall is the body that chooses the lord mayor, the sheriffs and certain other City officers.

== Court of Aldermen ==

Wards originally elected aldermen for life, but the term is now only six years. Aldermen may, if they so choose, submit to an election before the six-year period ends. In any case, an election must be held no later than six years after the previous election. The sole qualification for the office is that aldermen must be &quot;Freemen of the City&quot;; candidates are not required to be a resident, leaseholder or freehold owner of land in the ward in which they seek to run, nor even of the City of London.

Alderman serve on the Court of Common Council concurrent with their service on the Court of Alderman. Additionally, they select the Recorder of London, the senior Circuit judge on the Central Criminal Court, who sits on the Court of Alderman, and serve of boards as governors and trustees for various institutions with connections to the city. Alderman are also &quot;ex officio&quot; justices of the peace.

== Court of Common Council ==

The Court of Common Council, also known as the Common Council of the City of London, is formally referred to as the Mayor, Aldermen, and Commons of the City of London in Common Council assembled. The &quot;Court&quot; is the primary decision-making body of the City of London Corporation and meets nine times per year, though most of its work is carried out by committees.

The Common Council is the police authority for the City of London, a police area that covers the City including the Inner Temple and Middle Temple and which has its own police force – the City of London Police – separate from the Metropolitan Police, which polices the remainder of Greater London.

Each ward may choose a number of common councilmen. A common councilman must be a registered voter in a City ward, own a freehold or lease land in the City, or reside in the City for the year prior to the election. The individual must also be over 21; a Freeman of the City; and a British, Irish, Commonwealth or EU citizen. Common Council elections are held every four years, most recently in March 2022. Common councilmen may use the postnominals CC.

==The Chief Commoner==

Each year, the common councilmen elect one of their number to serve as Chief Commoner, an honorific office which &#x27;serves to recognise the distinguished contribution the office holder is likely to have made to the City Corporation over a period of years.&#x27; The Chief Commoner is expected to champion the Court of Common Council, to work to uphold its rights and privileges, and to offer advice and counsel to its members. They also represent the court on various different committees, support the lord mayor in the business of the Corporation and are prominently present on ceremonial occasions. The Chief Commoner is elected in October of each year and holds office for one year from the following April.

== The Lord Mayor and the Sheriffs ==
The Lord Mayor of London and the two Sheriffs are chosen by liverymen meeting at Common Hall. Sheriffs, who serve as assistants to the Lord Mayor, are chosen on Midsummer Day. The Lord Mayor, who must have previously been a Sheriff, is chosen on Michaelmas. Both the Lord Mayor and the Sheriffs are chosen for terms of one year.

The Lord Mayor fulfils several roles:
*Chairs the Court of Aldermen and the Common Council
*Represents the City to foreign dignitaries
*Heads the Commission of Lieutenancy of the City
*Chief Magistrate of the City
*Admiral of the Port of London
*Chancellor of the City University
*President of Gresham College
*Trustee of Saint Paul&#x27;s Cathedral

The ancient and continuing office of Lord Mayor of London (with responsibility for the City of London) should not be confused with the office of Mayor of London (responsible for the whole of Greater London and created in 2000).

==Policy chairman==
The role of Lord Mayor of London is largely ceremonial. Political leadership on the corporation is instead provided by the chair of the policy and resources committee (also known as the policy chairman), who is sometimes described as the &quot;de facto political leader&quot;. The policy chairman represents the City on the leaders&#x27; committee of London Councils, alongside the leaders of the 32 London Boroughs.

Since 1984, the policy chairmen have been:
== Ceremonies and traditions ==

Stuart Fraser, the Corporation&#x27;s Deputy Policy chairman wrote in 2011 &quot;it is undoubtedly the case that we have more tradition and pageantry than most&quot;, for example the yearly Lord Mayor&#x27;s Show.

There are eight formal ceremonies involving the Corporation:

#Midsummer Common Hall for the election of the sheriffs (24 June or nearest weekday);
#Admission of the Sheriffs, their oath-taking (the nearest weekday to the Michaelmas date);
#Michaelmas Common Hall for the election of the lord mayor (29 September or nearest weekday);
#Admission of the Lord Mayor, the so-called &quot;Silent Ceremony&quot; (Friday before the Lord Mayor&#x27;s Show);
#Lord Mayor&#x27;s Show; formally, &quot;the Procession of the Lord Mayor for Presentation to the Lord Chief Justice and King&#x27;s Remembrancer at the Royal Courts of Justice&quot; (the Saturday after the second Friday in November);
#The Ward Motes; elections in the City wards and general meeting of the ward in non-election years (third Friday in March);
#The Spital Sermon; literally a sermon given in the Guildhall church (St Lawrence Jewry next Guildhall), delivered by a senior cleric on behalf of the Christ&#x27;s Hospital and Bridewell Hospital (now King Edward&#x27;s School, Witley) (a day in school term between March and May);
#United Guilds Service involves all of the livery company masters, the lord mayor, sheriffs, the aldermen and high officers. This is the newest having been instituted in 1943, it is the responsibility of a special trust fund operating from Fishmongers&#x27; Hall (usually in March but so long as not conflicting with Holy Week).

=== Temple Bar Ceremony ===
The historic ceremony of the monarch halting at Temple Bar and being met by the lord mayor, also called the &quot;Pearl Sword Ceremony&quot;, has often featured in art and literature. It is commented on in televised coverage of modern-day royal ceremonial processions.

Tax journalist Nicholas Shaxson described the ceremony in an article in the &quot;New Statesman&quot;:
Both the Guildhall Historical Association and Paul Jagger, author of &quot;The City of London Freeman&#x27;s Guide&quot; and &quot;City of London: Secrets of the Square Mile&quot; explain that it is incorrect to say that this is a symbol of the submission of the Crown to the City, with Jagger writing:

===Freedom of the City of London===
The giving of the freedom of the city dates back to 1237. It is awarded to those who have significantly contributed to London and broader public life or to recognise significant achievements. One of the most recent persons to receive the award was Anna Landre in 2024, recognising her work in computer science and her disability campaigning.

== Conservation areas and green spaces ==

The City of London Corporation maintains around of public green spaces – mainly conservation areas / nature reserves – in Greater London and the surrounding counties. The most well-known of the conservation areas are Hampstead Heath and Epping Forest. Other areas include Ashtead Common, Burnham Beeches, Highgate Wood and the City Commons (seven commons in south London).

The Corporation also runs the unheated Parliament Hill Lido, in Hampstead Heath which the London Residuary Body with the agreement of the London Boroughs gave into the safekeeping of the City, for the benefit of the public, in 1989.

The City also owns and manages two traditional inner city parks: Queen&#x27;s Park and West Ham Park as well as over 150 smaller public green spaces. All these green spaces are funded principally by the City of London.

== Education ==
The City of London has a single primary school, The Aldgate School (ages 4 to 11), which is voluntary aided by the Church of England and maintained by the Education Service of the City of London.

City of London residents may send their children to schools in neighbouring local education authorities (LEAs). Some secondary school children enrol in schools in Islington, Tower Hamlets, Westminster or Southwark. Children who are permanent residents of the City of London are eligible for transfer to the City of London Academy, Southwark, a state-funded secondary school sponsored by the City of London located in Bermondsey. The City of London Corporation also sponsors City Academy, Hackney and City of London Academy Islington.

The City of London controls three other private schools – the City of London School (for boys), the City of London School for Girls, and the co-educational City of London Freemen&#x27;s School. The Lord Mayor also holds the posts of Rector of City University and President of Gresham College, an educational institution for advanced study.

The Guildhall School of Music and Drama is owned and funded by the Corporation.

== Criticism ==
Writing in &quot;The Guardian&quot;, George Monbiot claimed that the corporation&#x27;s power &quot;helps to explain why regulation of the banks is scarcely better than it was before the crash, why there are no effective curbs on executive pay and bonuses and why successive governments fail to act against the UK&#x27;s dependent tax havens&quot; and suggested that its privileges could not withstand proper &quot;public scrutiny&quot;.

In December 2012, following criticism that it was insufficiently transparent about its finances, the City of London Corporation revealed that its &quot;City&#x27;s Cash&quot; account – an endowment fund built up over the past 800 years that it says is used &quot;for the benefit of London as a whole&quot; – holds more than £1.3bn. , it had net assets of £2.3bn. The fund collects money made from the corporation&#x27;s property and investment earnings.

<text>Harry S. Truman&#x27;s inaugural address, known as the Four Point Speech, was delivered by United States president Harry S. Truman, on Thursday, January 20, 1949.

In a world only recently emerged from the shadow of World War II, in which freedom and human rights seemed under threat from many sides, this was Truman&#x27;s response.

He challenged both Democrats and Republicans to assist people around the world struggling for freedom and human rights; to continue programs for world economic recovery; to strengthen international organizations; and to draw on the expertise of the United States to help people across the world help themselves in the struggle against ignorance, illness and despair.

==The four points==

* First, &quot;we will continue to give unfaltering support to the United Nations and related agencies, and we will continue to search for ways to strengthen their authority and increase their effectiveness.&quot;
* Second, &quot;we will continue our programs for world economic recovery.&quot;
* Third, &quot;we will strengthen freedom-loving nations against the dangers of aggression.&quot;
* Fourth, &quot;we must embark on a bold new program for making the benefits of our scientific advances and industrial progress available for the improvement and growth of underdeveloped areas.&quot;

<text>The M69 is a dual three-lane dual carriageway motorway in Leicestershire and Warwickshire, England. It runs between junction 21 of the M1 near Leicester and junction 2 of the M6 near Coventry. It opened in 1977.

==History==
The motorway, also known at the time as the &#x27;Coventry – Leicester Motorway&#x27; was completed in 1977 following a public inquiry in 1972. It took traffic from the A46, which was subsequently downgraded.

==Route==
Starting at the north-eastern suburbs of Coventry at junction 2 of the M6, the motorway crosses the Coventry Canal and then continues north-east past Bulkington and west of Wolvey before turning more easterly to run south of Hinckley (junction 2, known locally as &#x27;Reacharound Island&#x27; because of the limited slip roads). It then crosses the Birmingham to Peterborough railway line terminating in the vicinity of suburban Enderby and Braunstone to the south-west of Leicester junction 3, where it meets the M1 with continuation along the A5460/A563 towards Leicester.

The M69 has no motorway service area given that this function is fulfilled at present by Leicester Forest East services and Corley services in close proximity to the start and end points of this relatively short motorway.

==Proposed developments==

There is an aspiration to construct a new slip road and road bridge for traffic travelling southbound on the M1 to join the M69.

Plans for a service station were announced in November 2023, to be located at junction one at the Stretton Baskerville roundabout. Welcome Break&#x27;s application will be the first service station for the route. The route has been without services for over 50 years and currently has a 26-mile unserviced stretch, which exceeds the government&#x27;s maximum recommendation of 14 miles between heavy goods vehicle stations.

<doc id="367487" wikidata="Q482925" url="?curid=367487" title="Nike Hercules">
<text>The Nike Hercules, initially designated SAM-A-25 and later MIM-14, was a surface-to-air missile (SAM) used by U.S. and NATO armed forces for medium- and high-altitude long-range air defense. It was normally armed with the W31 nuclear warhead, but could also be fitted with a conventional warhead for export use. Its warhead also allowed it to be used in a secondary surface-to-surface role, and the system also demonstrated its ability to hit other short-range missiles in flight.

Hercules was originally developed as a simple upgrade to the earlier MIM-3 Nike Ajax, allowing it to carry a nuclear warhead in order to defeat entire formations of high-altitude supersonic targets. It evolved into a much larger missile with two solid fuel stages that provided three times the range of the Ajax. Deployment began in 1958, initially at new bases, but it eventually took over many Ajax bases as well. At its peak, it was deployed at over 130 bases in the US alone.

Hercules was officially referred to as &quot;transportable&quot;, but moving a battery was a significant operation and required considerable construction at the firing sites. Over its lifetime, significant effort was put into the development of solid state replacements for the vacuum tube-based electronics inherited from the early-1950s Ajax, and a variety of mobile options. None of these were adopted, in favor of much more mobile systems like the MIM-23 Hawk. Another development for the anti-ballistic missile role later emerged as the much larger LIM-49 Nike Zeus design. Hercules would prove to be the last operational missile from Bell&#x27;s Nike team; Zeus was never deployed, and Hercules&#x27;s replacements were developed by different teams.

Hercules remained the US&#x27;s primary heavy SAM until it began to be replaced by the higher performance and considerably more mobile MIM-104 Patriot in the 1980s. Patriot&#x27;s much higher accuracy allowed it to dispense with the nuclear warhead, and Hercules was the last US SAM to use this option. The last Hercules missiles were deactivated in Europe in 1988, without ever being fired in a military conflict.

==Development and deployment==

===Project Nike===
During World War II, the US Army Air Force (USAAF) concluded that existing anti-aircraft guns, only marginally effective against existing generations of propeller-driven aircraft, would not be effective at all against the emerging jet-powered designs. Like the Germans and British before them, they concluded the only successful defence would be to use guided weapons.

As early as 1944 the US Army started exploring anti-aircraft missiles, examining a variety of concepts. They split development between the Army Air Force or the Ordnance Department based on whether or not the design &quot;depend[ed] for sustenance primarily on the lift of aerodynamic forces&quot; or &quot;primary on the momentum of the missile&quot;. That is, whether the missile operated more like an aircraft (Air Force) or a rocket (Ordnance).

Official requirements were published in 1945; Bell Laboratories won the Ordnance contract for a short-range line-of-sight weapon under Project Nike, while a team of players led by Boeing won the contract for a long-range design known as Ground-to-Air Pilotless Aircraft, or GAPA. GAPA moved to the US Air Force when that branch was formed in 1947. In 1946, the USAAF also started two early research projects into anti-missile systems in Project Thumper (MX-795) and Project Wizard (MX-794).

In 1953, Project Nike delivered the world&#x27;s first operational anti-aircraft missile system, known simply as Nike. Nike tracked both the target and the missile using separate radars, compared the locations in a computer, and sent commands to the missile to fly to a point in the sky to intercept the target. To increase range, the missile was normally boosted above the target into the thinner air and then descended on it in a gliding dive. Nike was initially deployed at military bases starting in 1953, especially Strategic Air Command bomber airfields, and general deployment then followed at US cities, important industrial sites, and then overseas bases. Similar systems quickly emerged from other nations, including the S-75 Dvina (SA-2) from the USSR, and the English Electric Thunderbird in the UK.

===Ajax and Hercules===
Even as the Nike was undergoing testing, planners grew concerned about the missile&#x27;s ability to attack formations of aircraft. Given the low resolution of the tracking radars available at the time, a formation of aircraft would appear on the radars as a single larger return. Launched against such a formation, the Nike would fly towards the center of the composite return. Given the Nike warhead&#x27;s relatively small lethal radius, if the missile flew into the middle of the formation and exploded, it would be highly unlikely to destroy any of the aircraft.

Improving performance against such targets would require either much higher resolution radars or much larger warheads. Of the two, the warhead seemed like the simplest problem to address. Like almost any thorny military problem of the 1950s, the solution was the application of nuclear bombs. In May 1952, Bell was asked to explore such an adaptation to the Nike. They returned two design concepts.

&quot;Nike Ajax&quot; used a slightly modified Nike missile, largely a re-arrangement of the internal components, making room for the WX-9 &quot;gun-type&quot; warhead also being developed as an artillery round. The WX-9, like all gun-type designs, was long and thin, originally designed to be fired from an artillery piece, and easily fit within the Nike fuselage.

The competing implosion-type design is considerably more efficient and uses much less nuclear fuel to reach any given explosive power. Bell proposed a much more modified design known as &quot;Nike Hercules&quot; with an enlarged upper fuselage able to carry the XW-7 warhead of up to that wouldn&#x27;t fit in the existing fuselage. In spite of the greatly increased explosive power, the WX-7 was only slightly heavier than the WX-9, about for common XW-7 versions, as opposed to for the XW-9.

At the same time, there were increasing concerns that higher speed aircraft would be able to launch their warheads at the extreme range of the Nike bases. This was a common complaint by the Air Force, who noted that bombers had the ability to attack from as much as while the Nike was only comfortable launching at about . This could be increased even further using stand-off missiles, like those currently under development by all of the nuclear-armed forces for just this reason. A larger Nike with greatly improved range would not only help address this sort of attack, but also allow a single base to defend a much larger area, lowering the overall costs of deploying a widespread defensive system.

As the larger Hercules would be easier to adapt to a longer-range form, the Army selected it as the winning design. Bell began working on the new design in concert with the Nike partners, Western Electric and Douglas Aircraft Company. Instead of the basic W-7, development of an improved boosted fission design known as W31. This used much less fissile material and was thus considerably less expensive. Developed by Sandia Laboratories in Albuquerque and at Los Alamos, it was given 1A priority by the Joint Chiefs of Staff in March 1953.

===Solid fuel===
Soon after design work started, the Army requested that the existing liquid fuel engine be replaced with a solid fuel design, for a variety of reasons. Primary among these was that the Ajax fuels were hypergolic, igniting on contact. Due to the nature of these fuels, extreme caution had to be used whenever the missiles were moved or unloaded for maintenance. This was carried out in a protected area behind a large berm, in order to protect the rest of the site from an accidental explosion during fueling. This complexity added enormously to the cost and time required to maintain the missiles.

Solid fuel rockets can remain stored for years and are generally very difficult to ignite without an extended period of applied flame. This means they can be manhandled safely and maintained with the rocket motor installed. However, the lower specific impulse of these engines, combined with the requirement for longer range, demanded a much larger fuselage to store the required fuel. Hercules, still known officially as &quot;Nike B&quot; at this point, grew to become a much larger design. This, in turn, required a much larger booster to loft it, but this was solved by strapping together four of the existing Nike boosters to form a cluster known as the XM-42, with the only modification to the original M5 engine design being the addition of new holes to bolt them together, creating the M5E.

During this period, some effort was put into a &quot;frangible booster&quot; for the Ajax. Ajax&#x27;s boosters were housed in steel tubes that fell near the base, presenting a serious range safety concern. Martin produced the T48E1 and E2 designs for Ajax used a fiberglass casing that was destroyed by small explosives, but this proved overweight and did not boost the Ajax to the required speed. Redstone Arsenal then presented the T48E3 which was somewhat larger and longer to reach reasonable performance, but only at the cost of having to modify all of the Ajax launcher rails. The Army eventually decided not to proceed with any Ajax modifications as Hercules would be arriving shortly anyway. Similar experiments for Hercules boosters led to the XM-61 single-chamber booster, but when the XM-42 cluster proved to be even less expensive than expected, this effort was also dropped.

As part of the upgrade project, the original missile became known as &quot;Nike I&quot;. On 15 November 1956, the new missile was officially renamed as the Nike Hercules, as part of DA Circular 700-22, while the Nike I becoming Nike Ajax.

The new design ultimately provided effective ranges on the order of and altitudes ranging from . Minimum range had a ground radius of approximately and an altitude of approximately 20,000 ft.

===Bomarc / Hercules controversy===

Throughout the early Nike evolution, the then-new Air Force had been encouraged by the deployment of the missile systems. They saw this as an extension of the Army&#x27;s existing &quot;point defence&quot; role, and as a valuable backup to their own manned interceptors. There were concerns about the possibility of Air Force fighters being attacked by Army missiles, but the two forces improved co-ordination between the Army&#x27;s ARAACOM and the Air Force&#x27;s Air Defense Command (ADC) to the point where it was no longer a serious concern. Nevertheless, when the Army first released information about Ajax to the press in 1953, the Air Force quickly responded by leaking information about BOMARC to Aviation Week, and continued to denigrate Nike in the press over the next few years.

Things changed dramatically with the development of Hercules. By the early 1950s, the Air Force was still struggling with their own long-range weapon systems, originally started in the 1940s in the GAPA project. The project had moved several times, and was now in late development as the BOMARC. BOMARC proved extremely expensive, difficult to maintain in operational readiness, had questionable performance, and was displaying a continued inability to reach operational status. Instead of de-emphasizing BOMARC in favor of Hercules, inter-service rivalry became rampant, and the Air Force began a policy of denigrating Hercules and the Army using policy by press release.

In a famous event, the Air Force interviewed for an article that appeared in the &quot;New York Times&quot; entitled &quot;Air Force Calls Army Nike Unfit To Guard Nation&quot;. This was answered most forcibly not by the Army, but the Defense Secretary Charles Erwin Wilson, who wrote in &quot;Newsweek&quot; that &quot;one hard solid fact remerges above them all: no matter what the Nike is or isn&#x27;t, it&#x27;s the only land-based operational anti-aircraft missile that the U.S. has.&quot; By the time early Hercules deployments were starting in 1958, BOMARC was still nowhere near operational.

All of this was part of a larger fight going on over the Army&#x27;s Jupiter missile, which the Air Force stated should be their mission. Wilson attempted to address the inter-service rivalries by enforcing a strict limit on the range of Army systems. In his 26 November 1956 memorandum, he limited the Army to weapons with range, and those involved in ground-to-air defense to only . This forced the Army to turn its Jupiter IRBM systems to the Air Force, and to limit the range of their ABM developments.

This did not do much to stop the squabbling, nor did it solve the problems that led to the issues in the first place – the fight over Hercules and BOMARC and related anti-missile developments. Nor did it stop the fighting in the press. Army Colonel John C. Nickerson Jr. publicly denounced Wilson, while leaking details of their latest missile design, the Pershing missile. The resulting flap led to calls for Nickerson to be court-martialed and was compared to the Billy Mitchell court-martial in the 1920s.

It did, however, allow development of Hercules to continue, and the system was soon preparing to deploy. In 1958 an article appeared in the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; in which various Air Force officials complained that the Hercules was ineffective. Chicago was slated to shortly begin receiving its Hercules upgrades. Similar articles began appearing in papers around the country, invariably just before that city was to begin receiving their missiles. This prompted ARAACOM commander Charles E. Hart to petition the Secretary of Defense to order the Air Force to stop the well organized campaign against Hercules. The Army then began its own series of press releases under what they called &quot;Project Truth&quot;.

Eventually, in November the new Secretary of Defense, Neil H. McElroy announced both systems would be purchased. Both forces, and their congressional supporters, realized that splitting the budget would mean neither force would be funded to the level required to fulfill the defence mission. In 1959 both the House and Senate debated the systems, with the Senate recommending cutting funding for Hercules and the House stating the opposite. The House eventually came to support the Defense Secretary&#x27;s position as stated in the Master Air Defense Plan, retaining Hercules while reducing BOMARC and SAGE.

Meanwhile, the Air Force scrambled to bring BOMARC to operational status, and on 1 September 1959 declared the 46th Air Defense Squadron at McGuire Air Force Base operational. It was later revealed that only one of the 60 missiles at the site was actually functional at that time. Engineers continued work on getting a second missile operational at McGuire, but the Air Force went ahead with plans to open the Suffolk County Missile Annex by 1 January 1960. In January, only four missiles were operational at Suffolk, and during House appropriation hearings that month, the DoD proved rather subdued when Congress attacked the design, especially in light of several failed tests of the BOMARC B missile. In February, Air Force Chief of Staff Thomas D. White shocked everyone when he requested that BOMARC deployments be reduced to eight US and two Canadian sites, essentially killing the program.

In the aftermath of the Hercules/BOMARC debates, retired Army Brigadier General Thomas R. Phillips wrote an article for the &quot;St. Louis Post-Dispatch&quot; that BOMARC and SAGE had been the &quot;most costly waste of funds in the history of the Defense Department.&quot;

===Operation SNODGRASS===
Plans had been made to test the Hercules&#x27;s W-7 warhead in a live-fire exercise in 1959 as part of &quot;Operation SNODGRASS&quot;. However, as rumours of a ban on atmospheric testing of nuclear weapons spread, SNODGRASS became a crash project to be completed before 1 September 1958 at any available site – the Nevada Test Site was fully booked with the existing Project AMMO testing series. Part of the rush was due to the newly evolving understanding of the effects of nuclear weapons on radar systems, which led to serious concerns about various weapon&#x27;s systems ability to operate after nearby nuclear explosions. Testing of the W-7 was put into AMMO, while the SNODGRASS series was moved to an Army-Air Force test at Eglin Air Force Base with tests of both the conventional T45 and nuclear W-7 warheads. A variety of problems, including one found in the W-7 warhead, caused delays in the testing programs, so a single launch of the T45-equipped Hercules was also added to the AMMO project.

The AMMO shot took place on 1 July 1958, successfully intercepting a simulated target flying at an altitude of and a slant range of . The first SNODGRASS round was launched on 14 July with its warhead replaced by an instrument package and launched against a Q2A Ryan Firebee I drone. A similar test on 17 July against a Q2A destroyed the target with the T45. A dual-launch followed on 24 July, with the first round destroying its target with the T45, and the second with the instrument package flying one second behind. A similar test on 29 July launched two missiles against three F-80 Shooting Star drones flying in formation, the first missile destroyed the lead aircraft while the second passed within lethal range of a second. Testing was unexpectedly cancelled before the W-7 could be fired.

===Deployment===
Hercules was designed from the start to operate from Ajax bases. However, as it protected a much greater area, not as many sites were needed to provide coverage of potential targets. Early deployments starting in 1958 were on new sites, but Ajax units started converting as well. Conversions were largely complete by 1960, leaving only a few Ajax sites in use. The last active Nike Ajax batteries were relieved of their mission in December 1961, followed by the last Army National Guard unit in May 1964.

Nuclear-armed Nike Hercules missiles were deployed in the United States, Greece, Italy, Korea and Turkey, and with Belgian, Dutch, and U.S. forces in West Germany. Conventionally armed Nike Hercules missiles also served in the United States, Spain, Germany, Denmark, Japan, Norway, and Taiwan. The first deployments in Europe began in 1959.

===Improved Nike Hercules===
Even before deployment of Hercules began, studies on improvements to the system had been identified. A 23 October 1954 report stated that &quot;Concurrent with the prosecution of the NIKE I and NIKE B programs, studies and research and development must be conducted to insure that the NIKE equipment is modernized to the maximum extent within the limits of current technology and economics of improvement as compared to investment in a new system ...&quot;. Three key elements were identified; the need to attack formations without nuclear warheads, operations against low-altitude targets, and better traffic-handling capabilities to handle larger raids.

In early 1956, Bell began studies of the Improved Nike Hercules (INH) concept by considering the predicted threat for the 1960-65 period. This was aircraft with speeds up to Mach 3, a wide range of radar cross sections, and powerful electronic countermeasures. IRBMs and ICBMs were also a consideration, but these were being addressed by the Nike Zeus concept, leaving only short-range weapons as an issue Hercules might need to address. To address this whole range of issues, Bell proposed a series of changes:

# improvements to the X-band TTR/MTR radars to increase range
# the addition of the long-range L-band &quot;High Power Acquisition Radar&quot; (HIPAR) to detect small, high-speed targets
# the addition of the wide-frequency Ku-band Target Ranging Radar (TRR) to provide ranging in a heavy ECM environment
# the addition of an active seeker on the missile to improve performance against low-altitude targets

The addition of the TRR solved a problem with early pulse radar units. It is relatively easy to jam a conventional radar by sending out additional pulses of radio signal on the same frequency. Unless the transmitter has encoded some additional form of information in the signal, the receiver cannot determine which pulse it sent out and which is from the jammer. Note that this has no effect on the determination of the &quot;direction&quot; to the target, which is the same for both the original and jammer pulses. However, it makes the determination of range difficult or impossible. The TRR solves this problem by providing a separate ranging system on another frequency. By making the signal wide-frequency, the jammer has to likewise broadcast across a similar bandwidth, limiting the energy in any one frequency and allowing the operator to tune the receiver to find an unjammed band. Combining range from the TRR and direction from the TTR provided complete information on the target.
The changes were designed to be upgradable without major changes to the deployed system – the TTR/MTR could be replaced at any time, the HIPAR used its own displays and therefore required no changes in the missile launch equipment, the TRR was slaved to the TTR and simply updated range readings, and the new seeker could be retrofitted at any time. The original Ajax detection radar retroactively became known as LOPAR, and remained in use as the main target selection radar in the missile control van. HIPAR would detect targets separately and &quot;hand off&quot; to the LOPAR and TTR so those systems could remain largely unchanged and able to launch either Hercules or Ajax.

These changes were presented on 24 August 1956, and accepted by both CONARC and ARADCOM. The active seeker system was later dropped to lower costs. Engineering was complete in 1958 and entered low-rate production in May 1959. The first HIPAR was tested at White Sands between 14 April 1960 and 13 April 1961, starting with two Ajax launches that passed 14 yards and 18 yards from the drone targets, and a further 17 Hercules launches that were generally successful. Among the various test targets were a Mach 3 Lockheed AQM-60, a drone, and a Corporal missile. Also conducted were tests to evaluate ECM performance, two surface-to-surface tests, and two Hercules-on-Hercules attacks with the target Hercules flying in a semi-ballistic trajectory.

Deployment of the INH upgrade kits began on 10 June 1961 at the BA-30 site in the Washington–Baltimore defense area, and continued into September 1967. HIPAR was a large system and generally deployed under a dome on top of a concrete platform that raised it above any local obstructions. To provide the same range of view, the tracking radars were also often placed on concrete platforms of their own, although these were much smaller.

The Hercules missile systems sold to Japan (Nike J) were subsequently fitted with upgraded internal guidance systems, the original vacuum tube systems being replaced with transistorized ones.

===Anti-missile upgrades===
Although Hercules had demonstrated its ability to successfully engage short-range missiles, the capability was not considered very important. During development the Air Force continued its Project Wizard while the Army started its Project Plato studies for dedicated anti-missile systems. By 1959, Plato was still very much a paper project when news of large deployments of short-range missiles in the Warsaw Bloc became a clear threat. Plato was cancelled in February 1959, replaced in the short term by further upgrades to Hercules, and in the longer term by the FABMDS program. FABMDS would have performance against any credible &quot;theatre&quot; ranged missile or rocket system, as well as offer anti-aircraft capabilities, the ability to attack four targets at once, and be relatively mobile.

The Hercules system was compared to threats ranging from the relatively short-range Little John, Honest John and Lacrosse through medium-range systems like Corporal, Sergeant and Lance, and finally the long-range (for battlefield concerns) Redstone. Of these threats, Redstone was considered just within the Hercules&#x27;s capabilities, able to defend against such a target over a relatively limited range. Increasing performance against these longer-range &quot;theatre&quot; weapons would require more extensive upgrades that would have pushed the time-frame out to the range when FABMDS was expected.

The primary change to create the resulting &quot;Improved EFS/ATBM Hercules&quot; was a modified version of the HIPAR. The antenna was modified to give it the ability to see higher angles, while the Battery Control Console was upgraded with dual PPI displays for short- and long-range work, and the data link to the missile van was upgraded. Additionally the radar was given the &quot;Electronic Frequency Selection&quot; (EFS) system which allowed operators to quickly switch between a selection of operating frequencies at about 20 microseconds, while the earlier system required manual switching that took about 30 seconds.

The first EFS sets arrived at White Sands late in 1962 and started testing in April 1963. In testing the system was successful against all manner of short-range rockets and missiles, and successfully tracked the Redstone on 23 September and 5 October 1963, but failed to achieve a &quot;kill&quot; in either test due to unrelated problems. A test against the much higher performance Pershing was carried out on 16 October 1963, and while the HIPAR was able to detect the missile, the tracking system was unable to track it.

The first deployment of the EFS/ATBM HIPAR was carried out between February and 20 April 1963, but during this time the Army decided not to deploy these systems in the United States. Further deployments to allied units and US units in Alaska were carried out between November 1963 and the summer of 1965.

===Mobile Hercules===

As Hercules had evolved from the fixed-base Ajax system, early deployments offered no mobility. However, both Ajax and Hercules systems in Europe had to be able to move as US forces shifted. This led to the use of semi-trailer systems for the fire control systems, which could be easily moved and re-positioned as required. LOPAR was relatively small, and the TTR/MTR were always trailer based, so these systems were also fairly mobile. The problem was the missile launcher itself, and especially the large HIPAR radar, which presented a formidable mobility problem.

Starting in April 1960, considerable effort was put into a fully mobile &quot;Cross-Country Hercules&quot; launcher based on the M520 Goer vehicle, an articulated prime mover that saw considerable service during the Vietnam War. This system was successfully tested at White Sands on 1 October 1961. In spite of this success, the GOER-based Hercules would not be used operationally.

Efforts to mount the HIPAR on the same platform between March and December 1962 were not nearly as successful, and on 18 December 1962 the concept was abandoned in favor of an &quot;airmobile&quot; solution using conventional M52 trucks and modified trailers. The resulting system used six semi-trailers: four to carry HIPAR electronic gear, one to carry the antenna, and one to carry the generators. General Electric demonstrated a prototype on 11 February 1964. The AN/MPQ-43 Mobile HIPAR was made part of Hercules Standard A in August 1966 and began operational deployment in Europe on 12 April 1967.

===Deactivation===
Soviet development of ICBMs and the de-emphasis of their bomber force decreased the value of the Hercules system. Beginning around 1965, the number of Nike batteries was reduced. Thule&#x27;s air defense was reduced during 1965, and SAC air base defense during 1966, reducing the number of batteries to 112. Budgetary cuts reduced that number to 87 in 1968, and 82 in 1969. Nike Hercules was included in SALT I discussions as an ABM.
All CONUS Hercules batteries, with the exception of the ones in Florida and Alaska, were deactivated by April 1974. The remaining units were deactivated during the spring of 1979. Dismantling of the sites in Florida – Alpha Battery in Everglades National Park, Bravo Battery in Key Largo, Charlie Battery in Carol City and Delta Battery, located on Krome Avenue on the outskirts of Miami – started in June 1979 and was completed by early autumn of that year. The buildings that once housed Delta Battery became the original structures used for the Krome Avenue Detention Facility, a federal facility used primarily to hold illegal aliens awaiting immigration hearings. In Anchorage, Alaska, Site Point (A Battery) was converted into a ski chalet for Kincaid Park. Site Summit (B Battery) still sits above Eagle River, its IFC buildings and clamshell towers easily visible when driving towards Anchorage. Site Bay (C Battery), across Cook Inlet from the others, has been mostly demolished, with only burned out shells of the batteries remaining, as well as a few storage bunkers. The large airstrip remains, and is often used by locals for flight instruction and practice.

Hercules remained a major front-line weapon in Europe into the 1980s. Over the years, the vacuum-tube guidance system, as well as the complex fire control systems&#x27; radars, suffered from diminishing manufacturing source (DMS) issues. In part because of less parts supportability, Western European (Fourth Allied Tactical Air Force (4 ATAF) and Second Allied Tactical Air Force (2 ATAF) sites essentially became fixed sites and were no longer considered capable of a mobile role. During the last years of their deployment in Europe, the issue at hand was more about maintaining security of the nuclear capable missiles, rather than mobility. The DoD invested considerably in upgrading the security of the storage areas of the launcher sections, ultimately installing significant towers that were capable of watching over all three sections within the &quot;exclusion area&quot;.

The U.S. Army continued to use Hercules as a front-line air defense weapon in Europe until 1983, when Patriot missile batteries were deployed. NATO units from West Germany, the Netherlands, Denmark, Belgium, Norway, Greece and Turkey continued to use the Hercules for high-altitude air defense until the late 1980s. With the collapse of communism in Eastern Europe, the units were deactivated in 1988. The last Hercules missile was launched in the Sardinian range of Capo San Lorenzo in Italy on November 24, 2006.

Approximately 25,000 Nike Hercules were manufactured. Early models cost about each, while most recent cost estimate, from Japan, was million.

==Description==
The Nike Hercules was a command-guided, long-range, high-altitude anti-aircraft missile. It was normally deployed in fixed bases with a central radar and control site (Integrated Fire Control area or IFC) separated from the launcher area (LA). Hercules batteries in the US were generally placed in older Ajax bases, using their underground storage and maintenance buildings. 145 missile batteries were deployed during the cold war.

===Sites===
Each Nike battery consisted of two or three areas: IFC, LA, and general. The LA consisted to a maximum of four launching sections, each section consisted of an underground storage area, an elevator to move missiles to and from the surface launchers, and four aboveground firing locations. One of these locations was directly above the elevator, the others were reached by manually pushing the missiles off the elevator to the launcher along rails. The LA also had a control van to control and monitor the LA activities and maintenance facilities.
The IFC contained the search and tracking radars and control center (operators, computer, etc.), and various related offices and communications centres for general operations. To operate the Nike Hercules system on the IFC the crew consisted of about nine operators under command of the Battery Control Officer (BCO). The crew on the LA, also under command of the BCO, was responsible for preparing and erecting the missile. On both the IFC and the LA maintenance people were available.

The battery crew was housed on-site, either at the IFC, or sometimes, together with administrative offices and general services on a separate area.

Any single battery could only launch a single missile at a time, due to the limited number of radars, computers and operators. Four Nike batteries were normally organized into a single battalion.

===Missile===

When mounted on its booster pack, the Hercules missile was long with a wingspan of (one side only). The upper stage alone was long. The fuselage had a bullet-like shape (Sears–Haack body), but this was difficult to make out due to the presence of the four large delta wings running almost the entire length of the fuselage. Each wing ended with a control flap which was separated from the wing by a short distance, leaving a gap. The back of the controls were even with the extreme rear of the missile. Smaller deltas in front of the main wings, and blended into them, provided roll control with very small flaps mounted to pivot along a line roughly 45 degrees from the line of the fuselage. These smaller wings also housed the antennae of the transponder.

The booster was formed from four of the earlier Ajax M5E1 boosters held together in a frame. Each of these was a steel tube, and held together in this fashion they presented a considerable range safety issue when they fell back to the ground after launch. The boosters were equipped with four large swept-wing fins at the extreme rear, behind the rocket exhaust, using a diamond cross-section suitable for supersonic lift.

Hercules could carry either a nuclear warhead or a conventional high-explosive warhead (T-45 fragmentation type). Initially the nuclear-armed version carried the W-7 Mod 2E nuclear warhead, with yields of 2.5 or 28 kt. Beginning in FY 1961 the older warheads were replaced by W-31 Mod 0 warheads, with yields of 2 kt (Y1) or 30 kt (Y2). The last versions carried the W31 Mod 2 warhead, with yields of 2 or 20 kt.

Approximately 25,000 Nike Hercules were manufactured. Three versions were produced, MIM-14A, B and C. The differences between these versions are not known. There are slight differences in dimensions as reported in different sources, it is not known if this is due to different versions.

===Detection and tracking===
Interceptions with the Hercules system would typically start with targets being detected and identified on the HIPAR system, if this was in use. Otherwise the LOPAR was used. In order to simplify the upgrades at Ajax sites, HIPAR did not replace the earlier ACQ radar from Ajax, which was retained and now known as LOPAR. HIPAR used its own displays and operators, and forwarded targeting information to the LOPAR operators who would then pick up those same targets on their own display.

Once a target was found on the LOPAR, it could be identified with aid of an Identification friend or foe system. The LOPAR provided rough range, azimuth and limited altitude or elevation information to the operators of the Target Tracking Radar (TTR), who would manually slew the TTR onto the target. Once locked-on, tracking was automatic.

New to the Hercules system was the Target Ranging Radar, or TRR. It is relatively easy to jam range information on monopulse radars like the TTR by sending out false return signals. The radar can continue to locate the target in elevation or azimuth because all of the signals come from the same location, but the receiver cannot easily determine which pulse was sent by the radar and which was sent by the electronic countermeasures (ECM) on the target aircraft, which is needed to measure the time-of-flight. The TRR system combatted this by allowing switching between two very different set of frequencies. This signal would be very difficult to jam because the jammer would have to broadcast across a wide set of frequencies in order to ensure they were returning on the frequency the receiver had actually selected. Meanwhile, the TTR can continue offering location information, and in the case that is also jammed (difficult but possible), was upgraded to offer a home-on-jam mode that used the ECM system&#x27;s own broadcasts as a location source. Skilled operators could also try to track the target in a manual tracking mode.

===Guidance===
As soon as the TTR was locked on to a target, an analog computer (later digital) continually computed a suitable intercept point in the sky and an expected &#x27;time to fly&#x27; of the missile based on information from the TTR and basic performance information about the missile. This information was displayed on plotting boards.

Prior to launch, the Missile Tracking Radar (MTR) locked on to the transponder in the selected missile. Like the Ajax, the Hercules used a transponder in the missile. A short period after launch the actual location, i.e. azimuth, elevation and range of the missile were displayed on the plotting boards. The firing or launch command was given manually by the Battery Control Officer based on orders or Rules of Engagements. To ensure the MTR could see and track the missile during its initial rapid ascent as it launched, the IFC was normally located about from the &quot;Launching Area&quot; (LA). In the case of Hercules, all of the radars were typically mounted on (concrete) elevated platforms to improve their line-of-sight.

Information from the MTR and TTR continued to be fed to the computer for updating the intercept point based on any actual changes in either the missile or the target location, speed or direction. The guidance commands were sent to the missile by modulating the MTR transmit signal. When the missile neared the intercept point a command signal was sent to the missile to explode.

===Launch sequence===
Hercules missiles were normally stored in a &quot;safe&quot; mode, using various keys and pull-to-arm pins. During an alert, the site would go on &quot;blue alert&quot;, at which time the LA crew would arm and erect the missiles and then retreat to safety. As the missiles were brought to readiness, a light board in the LA control van lit up with a series of amber lights for each launcher area, and green lights for each missile. On the IFC the status of the selected missile was given.

When the battery was given orders to attack a target, the alert status lamp changed from blue to red. When the TTR and MTR radars were locked, the computer had a firing solution and the missile reported active, the LA lamp changed from amber to green, indicating the ability to fire. At this time the target information and the intercept point were displayed on the plotting boards and the BCO selected the right time to manually fire.

The entire sequence of events from decision to launch to actual launch normally took about 36 seconds. This included about 30 seconds to develop a track for a target; 4 seconds for computer to develop a firing solution, and 2 seconds between the initial fire order command and missile launch. There was a 5-second allowance for the missile to launch, if it failed to do so it was marked &quot;rejected&quot; and another missile selected. A new missile could be launched about 11 seconds after detonation or rejecting the previous missile. Based on the &#x27;time to fly&#x27; of the missile this limited overall battery rates to about one launch every couple of minutes.

===Surface-to-surface mode===
Hercules also offered the ability to attack pre-located ground targets, after feeding in the coordinates in an operation that took about five minutes. For these missions the computer used the MTR to guide the missile to a point above the target, then commanded it to dive vertically while measuring any changes in trajectory as it fell. The missile would eventually pass out of line-of-sight with the MTR, so final arming information was provided during the dive, and the warhead was triggered by a barometric fuse.

==Accidental launches==
* Naha AFB, Okinawa June or July 1959, an incident occurred concerning a Hercules anti-aircraft missile on Okinawa which according to some witnesses, was complete with a nuclear warhead, and was accidentally fired from the Nike site 8 battery at Naha Air Base. While the missile was undergoing continuity testing of the firing circuit, known as a squib test, stray voltage caused a short circuit in a faulty cable that was lying in a puddle and allowed the missile&#x27;s booster to ignite with the launcher still in a horizontal position. The Nike missile left the launcher and smashed through a fence and down into a beach area skipping the warhead out across the water &quot;like a stone.&quot; The exhaust blast killed two Army technicians and injured one.
* Inchon, South Korea. Reported in &quot;The Washington Post&quot; of December 5, 1998, the missile inadvertently launched from a Nike missile site near the summit of Mount Bongnaesan where it exploded above some reclaimed land off Songdo (now Songdo International Business District), showering residential areas with debris, destroying parked cars and breaking windows.

<text>A water gun (or water pistol, water blaster, or squirt gun) is a type of toy gun designed to shoot jets of water. Similar to water balloons, the primary purpose of the toy is to soak another person in a recreational game such as a water fight. 

Historically, water guns were made of metal and used rubber squeeze bulbs to load and propel water through a nozzle like a Pasteur pipette. While the oldest surviving example of a squirt gun dates to J.W. Wolff&#x27;s June 30, 1896 patent, the oldest known reference to a squirt gun is dated thirty-five years prior, with General William T. Sherman&#x27;s 1861 quote regarding the effort to quell secession: &quot;Why, you might as well attempt to put out the flames of a burning house with a squirt-gun.&quot;

For several years in the United States and Canada, import regulations and domestic laws have required &quot;squirt guns&quot; to be made of clear or tinted transparent plastic to make them harder to mistake for actual firearms.

==Types==

===Squeeze bulbs===
Akin to water droppers, the oldest known manufactured water guns utilized a simple rubber squeeze bulb into which water could be drawn, then forcibly expelled out the nozzle by squeezing the bulb rapidly. This design has inherent limitations regarding the amount of pressure that one can achieve (fully dependent on the user&#x27;s hand gripping strength) as well as the need to refill after each shot.

===Piston/squirt gun===
Many early small water guns used the same trigger based pumping mechanism used for spray bottles. In this type of device, the trigger actuates a positive displacement pump shaft. With the aid of two check valves, often using small ball bearings, fluid is drawn into the pump from a reservoir, then forced out the nozzle upon squeezing the trigger. The simplicity of the spraying mechanism allowed these toys to be manufactured cheaply, and allowed the majority of the body to be used as the reservoir. The primary limitation with this design is the volume of water that can be effectively moved per pump. Increasing pump volume would require more user effort to push the fluid out, making larger designs impractical. However, this technology remains widely used today both in spray bottles as well as small water guns that can be found in a wide variety of shapes and colors.

A piston pumper is another version of this system. They are generally bigger than squirt guns and spray bottles. Piston pumpers do not have triggers. Instead, they fire by moving the pump back and forth. Although the piston pumper has greater output than squirt guns, they tend to be less powerful than pressurized water guns.

===Syringe/piston===
Another simple method employed is a syringe or piston type. In essence, the water gun is made up primarily (sometimes exclusively) of the pumping mechanism that comprises an outer pump shaft with an inner pump-rod and water-tight seal. This allows water to be drawn into the pump as the pump is extended, then forcibly ejected out as the pump is compressed. Stream performance is dependent on the user&#x27;s strength. Some models, like the Super Soaker Power Soaker Jr. and Stream Machines draw in and expel water from their nozzles. This design requires a bucket-type filling source. Other models, like the Super Soaker Power Soaker Mighty Cannon and Water Warriors Steady Stream, have check valves and a reservoir for portability.

===Motorized small piston===
During the 1980s, the motorized water gun was perhaps at its most prolific. Companies such as Entertech and Larami created water guns modeled after guns popularized in movies such as &quot;Rambo&quot;. At the heart of these devices was a small motor and crankshaft that converted a rotary motion into a forward-backward pumping motion to drive a small pump akin to those found in the small spray bottle-type squirt pistols. Stream performance was often not improved, but the motor removed the need to pump, which made the toys popular. The greatest fallbacks were that they wore out batteries quickly and that many trigger action blasters could outdo them, making motorized blasters the lowest class. However, their main strength—and consequent reason for dismissal—was their realistic styling. After some of these realistic-shaped water guns caused accidental shootings by police, stricter rules regarding shapes and coloring of water guns were drafted in the United States.

===Air pressurized reservoir===

The air pressurized reservoir was introduced by the Cosmic Liquidator but made famous by the Super Soaker brand of water guns. In this device, a pump is used to push air into a partially water-filled reservoir. The reservoir is otherwise air-tight, but it has one valve to let the incoming air in from the pump as well as a manually controlled valve operated by the user, commonly activated by pulling on a trigger. As more air is pumped in, the air in the reservoir is compressed, increasing in pressure; the water is under pressure by the now compressed air. Upon opening the nozzle valve, the water is pushed out through the nozzle as the pressurized air attempts to re-equilibrate with atmospheric pressure. This system allows pumping energy to be stored and used as needed. As well, unlike the methods noted above, this air pressure system allows production of a uniform, continuous stream of water.

The limitation of this design is the need for a large number of strokes to pressurize a larger reservoir. As well, poorly sealed reservoirs would render a water gun useless. Moreover, these water guns cannot be refilled unless emptied and depressurized. Opening a pressurized reservoir blaster while there is pressure remaining in the system can result in copious local water spray or even an unexpected launch of the water gun and/or reservoir out of one&#x27;s hands.

===Air separate pressure/firing chamber===
The air-based separate pressure chamber or firing chamber system works on the same physical principle as the pressurized reservoir system, but instead of pressurizing the reservoir, a separate, fixed volume chamber is included on the water gun into which water is pumped, compressing the air inside. This technology was first used on the Super Soaker SS 100. This allows the reservoir to be removed/opened at any time for refilling since the reservoir is not pressurized. As well, the typically smaller size of the pressure chamber and the fact that water is typically pumped, as opposed to air, reduces the average number of pumps needed to achieve functional pressure. For improved performance, some users opt to pre-pressurize the firing chamber by pumping in air first. This increases the starting pressure within the chamber, thus increasing the overall average pressure experienced by the water when it is pumped into the pressure chamber.

===Split air vs water pressure chamber===
While air based, the split air vs water pressure chamber has a sliding plunger that separates the compressed air from the water. This technology has so far only been seen on the Water Warriors Aqua Master PreCharger Series. A button or lever is used to toggle whether the pump is priming/pre-pressurizing the pressure chamber with air or whether the pump is moving water into the pressure chamber. Akin to pre-pressurizing the Separate Pressure Chamber water guns, the split air/water pressure chamber takes this one step further by preventing the accidental, undesired release of the pre-pressurized air by keeping it separated from the water by a sliding piston divider. After all the water is expelled from the pressure chamber, the sliding piston prevents loss of the pressurized air, thus reducing the number of times the water gun must be pumped in order to achieve optimal firing pressure.

===Rubber diaphragm/hydro power===
&quot;Hydro Power&quot; is a term coined by Buzz Bee Toys, referring initially to their series of water guns that employed an elastic rubber bladder to pressurize water. Similar to the Larami Constant Pressure System (CPS), the rubber diaphragm system can be considered basically half of a CPS-pressure chamber. A sheet of elastic material (typically rubber) is clamped against a housing unit. Water is pumped into the chamber, expanding the bladder that pressurizes the water within. However, due to the shape of the bladder, its expansion is not as uniform as in the CPS system, thus it experiences more significant pressure dropoff as the pressure chamber empties. Spyra GmbH uses an elongated bladder in its water blasters which, in combination with a special valve, enables shooting short bursts of water providing the impression of water bullets. The cylindrical bladder shape allows the pressure to be kept constant. 

===Springs===
Another means of pressurizing or propelling water used in some water guns is the use of metal springs. Though uncommon, there are blasters that utilize this technique. The Waterball series has a spring-based catapult mechanisms for launching balls of water out of its nozzle. The Water Warriors Steady Stream uses a spring-based mechanisms as a sort of water capacitor to allow this otherwise piston-based water gun to produce a constant stream of water so long as the user pumps quickly enough. Additionally, the Super Soaker Quick Blast employs a spring-based firing chamber to propel its stream forward.

===Peristaltic pumps===
Peristaltic pump systems have also been used in some water guns models, most notably the original Shield Blaster water guns by Mattel In this system, a rotary pump is used to move rollers along a compressible piece of tubing. As the rollers move, they push water along the tubing. The force exerted by the pump is dependent both on the speed of rotation as well as the thickness of tubing used. True continuous streams cannot be produced since the physical presence of the rollers means there will be partial gaps in the flow. However, if pumping is done quickly enough, the end result is a virtually smooth stream.

===Hybrid systems===
There are also a number of water guns that employ a variety of pressurization systems to propel water.

<doc id="367492" wikidata="Q853800" url="?curid=367492" title="Trace fossil">
<text>A trace fossil, also known as an ichnofossil (; from &quot;ikhnos&quot; &quot;trace, track&quot;), is a fossil record of biological activity by lifeforms but not the preserved remains of the organism itself. Trace fossils contrast with body fossils, which are the fossilized remains of parts of organisms&#x27; bodies, usually altered by later chemical activity or by mineralization. The study of such trace fossils is ichnology - the work of ichnologists.

Trace fossils may consist of physical impressions made on or in the substrate by an organism. For example, burrows, borings (bioerosion), urolites (erosion caused by evacuation of liquid wastes), footprints, feeding marks, and root cavities may all be trace fossils.

The term in its broadest sense also includes the remains of other organic material produced by an organism; for example coprolites (fossilized droppings) or chemical markers (sedimentological structures produced by biological means; for example, the formation of stromatolites). However, most sedimentary structures (for example those produced by empty shells rolling along the sea floor) are not produced through the behaviour of an organism and thus are not considered trace fossils.

The study of traces – ichnology – divides into &quot;paleoichnology&quot;, or the study of trace fossils, and &quot;neoichnology&quot;, the study of modern traces. Ichnological science offers many challenges, as most traces reflect the behaviour – not the biological affinity – of their makers. Accordingly, researchers classify trace fossils into form genera based on their appearance and on the implied behaviour, or ethology, of their makers.

==Occurrence==

Traces are better known in their fossilized form than in modern sediments. This makes it difficult to interpret some fossils by comparing them with modern traces, even though they may be extant or even common. The main difficulties in accessing extant burrows stem from finding them in consolidated sediment, and being able to access those formed in deeper water.

Trace fossils are best preserved in sandstones; the grain size and depositional facies both contributing to the better preservation. They may also be found in shales and limestones.

==Classification==

Trace fossils are generally difficult or impossible to assign to a specific maker. Only in very rare occasions are the makers found in association with their tracks. Further, entirely different organisms may produce identical tracks. Therefore, conventional taxonomy is not applicable, and a comprehensive form of taxonomy has been erected. At the highest level of the classification, five behavioral modes are recognized:
* Domichnia, dwelling structures reflecting the life position of the organism that created it.
* Fodinichnia, three-dimensional structures left by animals which eat their way through sediment, such as deposit feeders;
* Pascichnia, feeding traces left by grazers on the surface of a soft sediment or a mineral substrate;
* Cubichnia, resting traces, in the form of an impression left by an organism on a soft sediment;
* Repichnia, surface traces of creeping and crawling.

Fossils are further classified into form genera, a few of which are even subdivided to a &quot;species&quot; level. Classification is based on shape, form, and implied behavioural mode.

To keep body and trace fossils nomenclatorially separate, &quot;ichnospecies&quot; are erected for trace fossils. Ichnotaxa are classified somewhat differently in zoological nomenclature than taxa based on body fossils (see trace fossil classification for more information). Examples include:
*Late Cambrian trace fossils from intertidal settings include &quot;Protichnites&quot; and &quot;Climactichnites&quot;, amongst others
*Mesozoic dinosaur footprints including ichnogenera such as &quot;Grallator&quot;, &quot;Atreipus&quot;, and &quot;Anomoepus&quot;
*Triassic to Recent termite mounds, which can encompass several square kilometers of sediment

== Information provided by ichnofossils ==

Trace fossils are important paleoecological and paleoenvironmental indicators, because they are preserved in situ, or in the life position of the organism that made them. Because identical fossils can be created by a range of different organisms, trace fossils can only reliably inform us of two things: the consistency of the sediment at the time of its deposition, and the energy level of the depositional environment. Attempts to deduce such traits as whether a deposit is marine or non-marine have been made, but shown to be unreliable.

=== Paleoecology ===
Trace fossils provide us with indirect evidence of life in the past, such as the footprints, tracks, burrows, borings, and feces left behind by animals, rather than the preserved remains of the body of the actual animal itself. Unlike most other fossils, which are produced only after the death of the organism concerned, trace fossils provide us with a record of the activity of an organism during its lifetime. Unlike body fossils, which can be transported far away from where an individual organism lived, trace fossils record the type of environment an animal actually inhabited and thus can provide a more accurate palaeoecological sample than body fossils.

Trace fossils are formed by organisms performing the functions of their everyday life, such as walking, crawling, burrowing, boring, or feeding. Tetrapod footprints, worm trails and the burrows made by clams and arthropods are all trace fossils.

Perhaps the most spectacular trace fossils are the huge, three-toed footprints produced by dinosaurs and related archosaurs. These imprints give scientists clues as to how these animals lived. Although the skeletons of dinosaurs can be reconstructed, only their fossilized footprints can determine exactly how they stood and walked. Such tracks can tell much about the gait of the animal which made them, what its stride was, and whether the front limbs touched the ground or not.

However, most trace fossils are rather less conspicuous, such as the trails made by segmented worms or nematodes. Some of these worm castings are the only fossil record we have of these soft-bodied creatures.
=== Paleoenvironment ===

Fossil footprints made by tetrapod vertebrates are difficult to identify to a particular species of animal, but they can provide valuable information such as the speed, weight, and behavior of the organism that made them. Such trace fossils are formed when amphibians, reptiles, mammals, or birds walked across soft (probably wet) mud or sand which later hardened sufficiently to retain the impressions before the next layer of sediment was deposited. Some fossils can even provide details of how wet the sand was when they were being produced, and hence allow estimation of paleo-wind directions.

Assemblages of trace fossils occur at certain water depths, and can also reflect the salinity and turbidity of the water column.

=== Stratigraphic correlation ===
Some trace fossils can be used as local index fossils, to date the rocks in which they are found, such as the burrow &quot;Arenicolites franconicus&quot; which occurs only in a layer of the Triassic Muschelkalk epoch, throughout wide areas in southern Germany.

The base of the Cambrian period is defined by the first appearance of the trace fossil &quot;Treptichnus pedum&quot;.

Trace fossils have a further utility, as many appear before the organism thought to create them, extending their stratigraphic range.

== Ichnofacies ==

Ichnofacies are assemblages of individual trace fossils that occur repeatedly in time and space. Palaeontologist Adolf Seilacher pioneered the concept of ichnofacies, whereby geologists infer the state of a sedimentary system at its time of deposition by noting the fossils in association with one another. The principal ichnofacies recognized in the literature are &quot;Skolithos&quot;, &quot;Cruziana&quot;, &quot;Zoophycos&quot;, &quot;Nereites, Glossifungites, Scoyenia, Trypanites, Teredolites,&quot; and &quot;Psilonichus&quot;. These assemblages are not random. In fact, the assortment of fossils preserved are primarily constrained by the environmental conditions in which the trace-making organisms dwelt. Water depth, salinity, hardness of the substrate, dissolved oxygen, and many other environmental conditions control which organisms can inhabit particular areas. Therefore, by documenting and researching changes in ichnofacies, scientists can interpret changes in environment. For example, ichnological studies have been utilized across mass extinction boundaries, such as the Cretaceous–Paleogene mass extinction, to aid in understanding environmental factors involved in mass extinction events.

== Inherent bias ==
Most trace fossils are known from marine deposits. Essentially, there are two types of traces, either exogenic ones, which are made on the surface of the sediment (such as tracks) or endogenic ones, which are made within the layers of sediment (such as burrows).

Surface trails on sediment in shallow marine environments stand less chance of fossilization because they are subjected to wave and current action. Conditions in quiet, deep-water environments tend to be more favorable for preserving fine trace structures.

Most trace fossils are usually readily identified by reference to similar phenomena in modern environments. However, the structures made by organisms in recent sediment have only been studied in a limited range of environments, mostly in coastal areas, including tidal flats.

== Evolution ==

The earliest complex trace fossils, not including microbial traces such as stromatolites, date to . This is far too early for them to have an animal origin, and they are thought to have been formed by amoebae.
Putative &quot;burrows&quot; dating as far back as may have been made by animals which fed on the undersides of microbial mats, which would have shielded them from a chemically unpleasant ocean; however their uneven width and tapering ends make a biological origin so difficult to defend that even the original author no longer believes they are authentic.

The first evidence of burrowing which is widely accepted dates to the Ediacaran (Vendian) period, around . During this period the traces and burrows basically are horizontal on or just below the seafloor surface. Such traces must have been made by motile organisms with heads, which would probably have been bilateran animals. The traces observed imply simple behaviour, and point to organisms feeding above the surface and burrowing for protection from predators. Contrary to widely circulated opinion that Ediacaran burrows are only horizontal the vertical burrows &quot;Skolithos&quot; are also known. The producers of burrows &quot;Skolithos declinatus&quot; from the Vendian (Ediacaran) beds in Russia with date have not been identified; they might have been filter feeders subsisting on the nutrients from the suspension. The density of these burrows is up to 245 burrows/dm2. Some Ediacaran trace fossils have been found directly associated with body fossils. &quot;Yorgia&quot; and &quot;Dickinsonia&quot; are often found at the end of long pathways of trace fossils matching their shape. The feeding was performed in a mechanical way, supposedly the ventral side of body these organisms was covered with cilia. The potential mollusc related &quot;Kimberella&quot; is associated with scratch marks, perhaps formed by a radula, further traces from appear to imply active crawling or burrowing activity.

As the Cambrian got underway, new forms of trace fossil appeared, including vertical burrows (e.g. &quot;Diplocraterion&quot;) and traces normally attributed to arthropods. These represent a &quot;widening of the behavioural repertoire&quot;, both in terms of abundance and complexity.

Trace fossils are a particularly significant source of data from this period because they represent a data source that is not directly connected to the presence of easily fossilized hard parts, which are rare during the Cambrian. Whilst exact assignment of trace fossils to their makers is difficult, the trace fossil record seems to indicate that at the very least, large, bottom-dwelling, bilaterally symmetrical organisms were rapidly diversifying during the early Cambrian.

Further, less rapid diversification occurred since, and many traces have been converged upon independently by unrelated groups of organisms.

Trace fossils also provide our earliest evidence of animal life on land. Evidence of the first animals that appear to have been fully terrestrial dates to the Cambro-Ordovician and is in the form of trackways. Trackways from the Ordovician Tumblagooda sandstone allow the behaviour of other terrestrial organisms to be determined. The trackway &quot;Protichnites&quot; represents traces from an amphibious or terrestrial arthropod going back to the Cambrian.

== Common ichnogenera ==


*&quot;Anoigmaichnus&quot; is a bioclaustration. It occurs in the Ordovician bryozoans. Apertures of &quot;Anoigmaichnus&quot; are elevated above their hosts&#x27; growth surfaces, forming short chimney-like structures.
* &quot;Arachnostega&quot; is the name given to the irregular, branching burrows in the sediment fill of shells. They are visible on the surface of steinkerns. Their traces are known from the Cambrian period onwards.
* &quot;Asteriacites&quot; is the name given to the five-rayed fossils found in rocks and they record the resting place of starfish on the sea floor. &quot;Asteriacites&quot; are found in European and American rocks, from the Ordovician period onwards, and are numerous in rocks from the Jurassic period of Germany.
* &quot;Burrinjuckia&quot; is a bioclaustration. &quot;Burrinjuckia &quot;includes outgrowths of the brachiopod&#x27;s secondary shell with a hollow interior in the mantle cavity of a brachiopod. 
* &quot;Chondrites&quot; (not to be confused with stony meteorites of the same name) are small branching burrows of the same diameter, which superficially resemble the roots of a plant. The most likely candidate for having constructed these burrows is a nematode (roundworm). &quot;Chondrites&quot; are found in marine sediments from the Cambrian period of the Paleozoic onwards. They are especially common in sediments which were deposited in reduced-oxygen environments.
* &quot;Climactichnites&quot; is the name given to surface trails and burrows that consist of a series of chevron-shaped raised cross bars that are usually flanked on either side by a parallel ridge. They somewhat resemble tire tracks, and are larger (typically about wide) than most of the other trace fossils made by invertebrates. The trails were produced on sandy tidal flats during Cambrian time. While the identity of the animal is still conjectural, it may have been a large slug-like animal – its trails produced as it crawled over and processed the wet sand to obtain food.
* &quot;Cruziana&quot; are excavation trace marks made on the sea floor which have a two-lobed structure with a central groove. The lobes are covered with scratch marks made by the legs of the excavating organism, usually a trilobite or allied arthropod. &quot;Cruziana&quot; are most common in marine sediments formed during the Paleozoic era, particularly in rocks from the Cambrian and Ordovician periods. Over 30 ichnospecies of &quot;Cruziana&quot; have been identified. See also Isopodichnus.
* &quot;Entobia&quot; is a boring produced by endolithic clionaid sponges consisting of galleries excavated in a carbonate substrate; often has swollen chambers with connecting canals.
* &quot;Gastrochaenolites&quot; are clavate (club-shaped) borings also produced in calcareous hard substrates, usually by bivalves.
* &quot;Oikobesalon&quot; is an unbranched, elongate burrow with single-entrance and circular cross-section produced by terebellid polychaetes. They are covered with thin lining which has a transverse ornamentation in the form of fusiform annulation.
* &quot;Petroxestes&quot; is a shallow groove boring produced by mytilacean bivalves in carbonate hard substrates.
* &quot;Planolites&quot; is a small, 1-5mm (0.039–0.197 in), unlined and rarely branched, elongate burrow with fill that differs from the host rock, and is found throughout the Ediacaran and the Phanerozoic.
* &quot;Protichnites&quot; consists of two rows of tracks and a linear depression between the two rows. The tracks are believed to have been made by the walking appendages of arthropods. The linear depression is thought to be the result of a dragging tail. The structures bearing this name were typically made on the tidal flats of Paleozoic seas, but similar ones extend into the Cenozoic.
* &quot;Rhizocorallium&quot; is a type of burrow, the inclination of which is typically within 10° of the bedding planes of the sediment. These burrows can be very large, over a meter long in sediments that show good preservation, e.g. Jurassic rocks of the Yorkshire Coast (eastern United Kingdom), but the width is usually only up to , restricted by the size of the organisms producing it. It is thought that they represent fodinichnia as the animal (probably a nematode) scoured the sediment for food.
* &quot;Rogerella&quot; is a small pouch-shaped boring with a slit-like aperture currently produced by acrothoracican barnacles.
* &quot;Rusophycus&quot; are bilobed &quot;resting traces&quot; associated with trilobites and other arthropods such as horseshoe crabs.
* &quot;Skolithos&quot;: One well-known occurrence of Cambrian trace fossils from this period is the famous &#x27;Pipe Rock&#x27; of northwest Scotland. The &#x27;pipes&#x27; that give the rock its name are closely packed straight tubes- which were presumably made by some kind of worm-like organism. The name given to this type of tube or burrow is &quot;Skolithos&quot;, which may be in length and between in diameter. Such traces are known worldwide from sands and sandstones deposited in shallow water environments, from the Cambrian period (542–488 Ma) onwards.
* &quot;Thalassinoides&quot; are burrows which occur parallel to the bedding plane of the rock and are extremely abundant in rocks, worldwide, from the Jurassic period onwards. They are repeatedly branched, with a slight swelling present at the junctions of the tubes. The burrows are cylindrical and vary from in diameter. &quot;Thalassinoides&quot; sometimes contain scratch marks, droppings or the bodily remains of the crustaceans which made them.
* &quot;Teichichnus&quot; has a distinctive form produced by the stacking of thin &#x27;tongues&#x27; of sediment, atop one another. They are again believed to be fodinichnia, with the organism adopting the habit of retracing the same route through varying heights of the sediment, which would allow it to avoid going over the same area. These &#x27;tongues&#x27; are often quite sinuous, reflecting perhaps a more nutrient-poor environment in which the feeding animals had to cover a greater area of sediment, in order to acquire sufficient nourishment.
* &quot;Tremichnus&quot; is an embedment structure (i.e. bioclaustration) formed by an organism that inhibited growth of the crinoid host stereom.
* &quot;Trypanites&quot; are elongated cylindrical borings in calcareous substrates such as shells, carbonate hardgrounds, and limestones. Usually produced by worms of various types and sipunculids.

==Other notable trace fossils==
Less ambiguous than the above ichnogenera, are the traces left behind by invertebrates such as &quot;Hibbertopterus&quot;, a giant &quot;sea scorpion&quot; or eurypterid of the early Paleozoic era. This marine arthropod produced a spectacular track preserved in Scotland.

Bioerosion through time has produced a magnificent record of borings, gnawings, scratchings and scrapings on hard substrates. These trace fossils are usually divided into macroborings and microborings. Bioerosion intensity and diversity is punctuated by two events. One is called the Ordovician Bioerosion Revolution (see Wilson &amp; Palmer, 2006) and the other was in the Jurassic. For a comprehensive bibliography of the bioerosion literature, please see the External links below.

The oldest types of tetrapod tail-and-footprints date back to the latter Devonian period. These vertebrate impressions have been found in Ireland, Scotland, Pennsylvania, and Australia. A sandstone slab containing the track of tetrapod, dated to 400 million years, is amongst the oldest evidence of a vertebrate walking on land.

Important human trace fossils are the Laetoli (Tanzania) footprints, imprinted in volcanic ash 3.7 Ma (million years ago) – probably by an early Australopithecus.

== Confusion with other types of fossils ==

Trace fossils are not body casts. The Ediacara biota, for instance, primarily comprises the casts of organisms in sediment. Similarly, a footprint is not a simple replica of the sole of the foot, and the resting trace of a seastar has different details than an impression of a seastar.

Early paleobotanists misidentified a wide variety of structures they found on the bedding planes of sedimentary rocks as fucoids (Fucales, a kind of brown algae or seaweed). However, even during the earliest decades of the study of ichnology, some fossils were recognized as animal footprints and burrows. Studies in the 1880s by A. G. Nathorst and Joseph F. James comparing &#x27;fucoids&#x27; to modern traces made it increasingly clear that most of the specimens identified as fossil fucoids were animal trails and burrows. True fossil fucoids are quite rare.

Pseudofossils, which are &quot;not&quot; true fossils, should also not be confused with ichnofossils, which are true indications of prehistoric life.

==History==
Charles Darwin&#x27;s &quot;The Formation of Vegetable Mould through the Action of Worms&quot; is an example of a very early work on ichnology, describing bioturbation and, in particular, the burrowing of earthworms.

<text>The Drottningholm Palace Theatre () is an opera house located at Drottningholm Palace in Stockholm, Sweden. It is one of the few 18th century theatres in Europe that is still used as a theatre with its original stage machinery.

Currently, the reinvigorated theatre has acquired a growing international reputation as a summer opera festival theatre by focusing on works by Haydn, Handel, Gluck and Mozart and emphasis on authentic performance. The theatre has also had guest performances by the Royal Swedish Opera.

==History==


The first theatre to be built on the Drottningholm site was built at the behest of Queen Lovisa Ulrika by the German master builder, (1718 or 1719–1779). The theatre opened in 1754 and hosted a new troupe of French actors, the Du Londel Troupe, that had been engaged by the court a year earlier and was to use the theatre until 1771. The troupe used the theatre in the summer months to show French theatre and Italian opera for the Queen and her court.

When the original theatre burned down on 27 August 1762 during the performance of a comic opera, Queen Lovisa Ulrika quickly decided to rebuild a theatre for the Drottningholm Palace court, commissioning a replacement opera house by Carl Fredrik Adelcrantz. Work began on the building in 1764, and it eventually included the theatre as well as a complex of smaller chambers off the main auditorium to house members of the court who did not stay at the palace, including Adelcrantz, the master of the revels, the noble chambermaids, the actors and staff of the theatre, and young aristocrats. The building that Adelcrantz created was unusual architecturally in several respects. Most notably, although the theatre was intended to mimic Versailles&#x27;s artistic style, the lack of funds of the Swedish Treasury forced a much sparser style. The exterior of the building is very plain in comparison to other palatial theatres, in the style of a country manor with no indication from the exterior that an opera house is inside. The interior, decorated by Adrien Masreliez, uses trompe l&#x27;oeil, papier-mâché, and stucco to imitate more expensive materials like marble and gold. The theatre is also architecturally unusual for its shape, since the auditorium is shaped like a T with the two thrones for the reigning monarchs placed in the cross of the T in front of the stage and the rest of the court seated on wooden benches. The stage is also unusually deep, , which helped the set designers to create optical illusions of great distance on the stage.

For scholars, the most important part of the theatre, however, is not the architectural uniqueness of the space, but instead the stage machinery that is a rare surviving example of common stage effects from its time. The machinery for the theatre was possibly designed by the Italian Donato Stopani, although some historians think the designer may have been George Fröman, master builder for the court who studied similar stage machinery when he travelled through Europe in 1755. One of the stage machines that is still intact and in use in the theatre is the chariot-and-pole system, which helps to change scenes quickly by sliding the wings with wheels (&quot;chariots&quot;) on tracks in the floor, controlled by a capstan under the stage (&quot;pole&quot;). The theatre has an unusually large number of wings, with a total of four possible scene changes in a single performance, but the chariot-and-pole system allows a scene change in as little as six seconds. Other machines that are still used in the theatre are purely for special effects, including a wave machine consisting of giant painted corkscrews that are turned to simulate a rough sea, a thunder machine to create storm sound effects, and a flying chair which is often used for &quot;deus ex machina&quot; effects. Lighting is controlled by turning metal sconces and their candles toward or away from the stage.

In 1766, the theatre was opened by Queen Lovisa Ulrika, and there were several performances that included court members and the royal family as actors celebrating the occasion. The theatre was used every summer by the court until 1771, when Adolf Frederik died and the French acting troupe he had imported was dismissed. The theatre remained unused until 1777, when Queen Lovisa Ulrika gave it to her son King Gustav III. King Gustav was deeply interested in the theatre, hiring an acting troupe, and even writing and directing several works at Drottningholm. The theatre that was performed under King Gustav was a departure from the theatre of his predecessors, since although French and Italian theatre was still performed, he encouraged the use of Swedish stories and language to create a new operatic tradition. He also made some alterations to the theatre building itself, adding the Dejeuner Salon that is used as the foyer today. After the assassination of King Gustav III in 1792 (which is the basis of the Giuseppe Verdi opera, &quot;Un ballo in maschera&quot;), the theatre was used as a storage room for Drottningholm Palace&#x27;s unused furniture.

==20th-century restoration and revival==
In 1921, Swedish theatre historian rediscovered Drottningholm Theatre and, with royal permission, preserved what was left of the theatre&#x27;s interior and stage machinery. Some small changes were made, including the addition of electric lights, which were designed to flicker like candles, the replacement of the original ropes that moved the machinery, and the substitution of replicas for delicate backdrops. Most of the theatre, however, was unchanged from the original design, and much of the stucco work and original wallpaper remains today. The theatre re-opened on 19 August 1922. Until 1935, performances were limited to occasional showcases for visiting scholars, usually including dances performed by the Swedish Ballet School. In 1935, the theatre began to host seasonal performances, starting with three ballad operas by , Joseph Martin Kraus and Carl Michael Bellman. In 1951, the Royal Swedish Opera became the permanent company performing in Drottningholm Theatre, using the space for their summer performances. In 1953, the Royal Swedish Ballet joined in partnership with the Opera, and the company&#x27;s new director, Mary Skeaping, pushed the dancers to revive the 17th and 18th century court ballet style. In August 1998, a Gluck programme was staged, including &quot;Paris and Helen&quot; with Magdalena Kožená singing Paris, &quot;Alceste&quot; in the Italian version and the ballet &quot;Don Juan&quot;. The first new opera to be premiered at the theatre in modern times was Jonas Forssell&#x27;s &quot;Trädgården&quot; (The Garden) in July 1999, conducted by Roy Goodman, with Malena Ernman in the trouser role of Ziöberg.

Today, a private foundation, the Drottningholm Theatre Museum, funded by government and private grants, runs the theatre, performing operas in the summer months. The operas are often performed by musicians wearing period costume, and the orchestra performs using period or copies of authentic instruments. Most productions demonstrate some of the possible stage effects using the original equipment. The theatre remains a place to train musicians, dancers, and opera singers in Baroque style.

In 1991, the theatre, along with the Drottningholm Palace (the residence of the Swedish royal family), the Chinese Pavilion and the surrounding park, became the first Swedish patrimony to be inscribed in the UNESCO list of World Heritage Sites. Parts of the palace, the pavilion and the theatre are open to the public for tours.

Recent artistic directors of the theatre are Arnold Östman (1980–92), Elisabeth Söderström (1993–96), Per-Erik Öhrn (1996–2006). Mark Tatlow (2007–2013). , the theatre&#x27;s managing director from 2011, took over as artistic director in 2013. It is under her direction that took place a widely acclaimed (then touring) &quot;Mozart – Da Ponte Trilogy&quot; conducted by Marc Minkowski and staged by . Mezzo-soprano Ann Hallenberg was artist in residence in 2019 and 2020. Her choice of repertoire for 2019 was &quot;Ariodante&quot; conducted by Ian Page.

==As featured in Bergman&#x27;s &quot;The Magic Flute&quot;==
A copy of the theatre is visible in Ingmar Bergman&#x27;s 1975 film version of &quot;The Magic Flute&quot;. According to film historian Peter Cowie&#x27;s notes for the DVD release of the film, Bergman wanted to recreate as closely as possible the original 1791 production in the Theater auf der Wieden in Vienna, and originally hoped to film in the Drottningholm Theatre. However, &quot;the scenery was considered too fragile to accommodate a film crew. So the stage – complete with wings, curtains, and wind machines – was painstakingly copied and erected in the studios of the Swedish Film Institute&quot;. Introductory exterior shots of the theatre are, however, visible in the film.

<text>Pseudofossils are inorganic objects, markings, or impressions that might be mistaken for fossils. Pseudofossils may be misleading, as some types of mineral deposits can mimic lifeforms by forming what appear to be highly detailed or organized structures. One common example is when manganese oxides crystallize with a characteristic tree-like or dendritic pattern along a rock fracture. The formation of frost dendrites on a window is another common example of this crystal growth. Concretions are sometimes thought to be fossils, and occasionally one contains a fossil, but are generally not fossils themselves. Chert or flint nodules in limestone can often take forms that resemble fossils.
==Background==
Pyrite disks or spindles are sometimes mistaken for fossils of sand dollars or other forms (see marcasite). Cracks, bumps, gas bubbles, and such can be difficult to distinguish from true fossils. Specimens that cannot be attributed with certainty to either fossils or pseudofossils are treated as dubiofossils. Debates on whether specific forms are pseudo or true fossils can be lengthy and difficult. For example, &quot;Eozoön&quot; is a complex laminated form of interlayered calcite and serpentine originally found in Precambrian metamorphosed limestones (marbles). It was at first thought to be the remains of a giant fossil protozoan (Dawson, 1865), then by far the oldest fossil known. Similar structures were subsequently found in metamorphosed limestone blocks ejected during an eruption of Mount Vesuvius. It was clear that high-temperature physical and chemical processes were responsible for the formation of &quot;Eozoön&quot; in the carbonate rock (O&#x27;Brien, 1970). The debate over the interpretation of &quot;Eozoon&quot; was a significant episode in the history of paleontology (Adelman, 2007).

Chemical gardens can produce branching microtubuli of 2-10 μm in diameter and can resemble very closely the shapes of fossilized primitive fungi or microorganisms. It has been proposed that ancient, Precambrian, structures that have been identified as the evidence for the first fungi or even the first life, are more probably products of ancient natural chemical gardens.

<text>A concretion is a hard and compact mass formed by the precipitation of mineral cement within the spaces between particles, and is found in sedimentary rock or soil. Concretions are often ovoid or spherical in shape, although irregular shapes also occur. The word &quot;concretion&quot; is borrowed from Latin , itself derived from &quot;concrescere&quot; , from &quot;con-&quot; and &quot;crescere&quot; . 

Concretions form within layers of sedimentary strata that have already been deposited. They usually form early in the burial history of the sediment, before the rest of the sediment is hardened into rock. This concretionary cement often makes the concretion harder and more resistant to weathering than the host stratum.

There is an important distinction to draw between concretions and nodules. Concretions are formed from mineral precipitation around some kind of nucleus while a nodule is a replacement body.

Descriptions dating from the 18th century attest to the fact that concretions have long been regarded as geological curiosities. Because of the variety of unusual shapes, sizes and compositions, concretions have been interpreted to be dinosaur eggs, animal and plant fossils (called pseudofossils), extraterrestrial debris or human artifacts.

==Origins==

Detailed studies have demonstrated that concretions form after sediments are buried but before the sediment is fully lithified during diagenesis. They typically form when a mineral precipitates and cements sediment around a nucleus, which is often organic, such as a leaf, tooth, piece of shell or fossil. For this reason, fossil collectors commonly break open concretions in their search for fossil animal and plant specimens. Some of the most unusual concretion nuclei are World War II military shells, bombs, and shrapnel, which are found inside siderite concretions found in an English coastal salt marsh.

Depending on the environmental conditions present at the time of their formation, concretions can be created by either concentric or pervasive growth. In concentric growth, the concretion grows as successive layers of mineral precipitate around a central core. This process results in roughly spherical concretions that grow with time. In the case of pervasive growth, cementation of the host sediments, by infilling of its pore space by precipitated minerals, occurs simultaneously throughout the volume of the area, which in time becomes a concretion. Concretions are often exposed at the surface by subsequent erosion that removes the weaker, uncemented material.

==Appearance==

Concretions vary in shape, hardness and size, ranging from objects that require a magnifying lens to be clearly visible to huge bodies three meters in diameter and weighing several thousand pounds. The giant, red concretions occurring in Theodore Roosevelt National Park, in North Dakota, are almost in diameter. Spheroidal concretions, as large as in diameter, have been found eroding out of the Qasr el Sagha Formation within the Faiyum depression of Egypt. Concretions occur in a wide variety of shapes, including spheres, disks, tubes, and grape-like or soap bubble-like aggregates.

==Composition==

Concretions are commonly composed of a mineral present as a minor component of the host rock. For example, concretions in sandstones or shales are commonly formed of a carbonate mineral such as calcite; those in limestones are commonly an amorphous or microcrystalline form of silica such as chert, flint, or jasper; while those in black shale may be composed of pyrite. Other minerals that form concretions include iron oxides or hydroxides (such as goethite and hematite), dolomite, siderite, ankerite, marcasite, barite, and gypsum.

Although concretions often consist of a single dominant mineral, other minerals can be present depending on the environmental conditions that created them. For example, carbonate concretions, which form in response to the reduction of sulfates by bacteria, often contain minor percentages of pyrite. Other concretions, which formed as a result of microbial sulfate reduction, consist of a mixture of calcite, barite, and pyrite.

==Occurrence==

Concretions are found in a variety of rocks, but are particularly common in shales, siltstones, and sandstones. They often outwardly resemble fossils or rocks that look as if they do not belong to the stratum in which they were found. Occasionally, concretions contain a fossil, either as its nucleus or as a component that has been incorporated during its growth but concretions are not fossils themselves. They appear in nodular patches, concentrated along bedding planes, or protruding from weathered cliffsides.

Small hematite concretions or Martian spherules have been observed by the &quot;Opportunity&quot; rover in the Eagle Crater on Mars.

==Types of concretion==
Concretions vary considerably in their compositions, shapes, sizes and modes of origin.

===Septarian concretions===

 Septarian concretions (or septarian nodules) are carbonate-rich concretions containing angular cavities or cracks (septaria; &quot;&quot;, from the Latin &quot;partition, separating element&quot;, referring to the cracks or cavities separating polygonal blocks of hardened material). Septarian nodules are characteristically found in carbonate-rich mudrock. They typically show an internal structure of polyhedral blocks (the &quot;matrix&quot;) separated by mineral-filled radiating cracks (the septaria) which taper towards the rim of the concretion. The radiating cracks sometimes intersect a second set of concentric cracks. However, the cracks can be highly variable in shape and volume, as well as the degree of shrinkage they indicate. The matrix is typically composed of argillaceous carbonate, such as clay ironstone, while the crack filling is usually calcite. The calcite often contains significant iron (ferroan calcite) and may have inclusions of pyrite and clay minerals. The brown calcite common in septaria may also be colored by organic compounds produced by bacterial decay of organic matter in the original sediments.

Septarian concretions are found in many kinds of mudstone, including lacustrine siltstones such as the Beaufort Group of northwest Mozambique, but are most commonly found in marine shales, such as the Staffin Shale Formation of Skye, the Kimmeridge Clay of England, or the Mancos Group of North America.

It is commonly thought that concretions grew incrementally from the inside outwards. Chemical and textural zoning in many concretions are consistent with this &quot;concentric&quot; model of formation. However, the evidence is ambiguous, and many or most concretions may have formed by &quot;pervasive&quot; cementation of the entire volume of the concretion at the same time. For example, if the porosity after early cementation varies across the concretion, then later cementation filling this porosity would produce compositional zoning even with uniform pore water composition. Whether the initial cementation was concentric or pervasive, there is considerable evidence that it occurred quickly and at shallow depth of burial. In many cases, there is clear evidence that the initial concretion formed around some kind of organic nucleus.

The origin of the carbonate-rich septaria is still debated. One possibility is that dehydration hardens the outer shell of the concretion while causing the interior matrix to shrink until it cracks. Shrinkage of a still-wet matrix may also take place through syneresis, in which the particles of colloidal material in the interior of the concretion become gradually more tightly bound while expelling water. Another possibility is that early cementation reduces the permeability of the concretion, trapping pore fluids and creating excess pore pressure during continued burial. This could crack the interior at depths as shallow as . A more speculative theory is that the septaria form by brittle fracturing resulting from earthquakes. Regardless of the mechanism of crack formation, the septaria, like the concretion itself, likely form at a relatively shallow depth of burial of less than and possibly as little as . Geologically young concretions of the Errol Beds of Scotland show texture consistent with formation from flocculated sediments containing organic matter, whose decay left tiny gas bubbles (30 to 35 microns in diameter) and a soap of calcium fatty acids salts. The conversion of these fatty acids to calcium carbonate may have promoted shrinkage and fracture of the matrix.

One model for the formation of septarian concretions in the Staffin Shales suggests that the concretions started as semirigid masses of flocculated clay. The individual colloidal clay particles were bound by extracellular polymeric substances or EPS produced by colonizing bacteria. The decay of these substances, together with syneresis of the host mud, produced stresses that fractured the interiors of the concretions while still at shallow burial depth. This was possible only with the bacterial colonization and the right sedimentation rate. Additional fractures formed during subsequent episodes of shallow burial (during the Cretaceous) or uplift (during the Paleogene). Water derived from rain and snow (meteoric water) later infiltrated the beds and deposited ferroan calcite in the cracks.

Septarian concretions often record a complex history of formation that provides geologists with information on early diagenesis, the initial stages of the formation of sedimentary rock from unconsolidated sediments. Most concretions appear to have formed at depths of burial where sulfate-reducing microorganisms are active. This corresponds to burial depths of , and is characterized by generation of carbon dioxide, increased alkalinity and precipitation of calcium carbonate. However, there is some evidence that formation continues well into the methanogenic zone beneath the sulfate reduction zone.

A spectacular example of boulder septarian concretions, which are as much as in diameter, are the Moeraki Boulders. These concretions are found eroding out of Paleocene mudstone of the Moeraki Formation exposed along the coast near Moeraki, South Island, New Zealand. They are composed of calcite-cemented mud with septarian veins of calcite and rare late-stage quartz and ferrous dolomite. The much smaller septarian concretions found in the Kimmeridge Clay exposed in cliffs along the Wessex coast of England are more typical examples of septarian concretions.

===Cannonball concretions===

Cannonball concretions are large spherical concretions, which resemble cannonballs. These are found along the Cannonball River within Morton and Sioux Counties, North Dakota, and can reach in diameter. They were created by early cementation of sand and silt by calcite. Similar cannonball concretions, which are as much as in diameter, are found associated with sandstone outcrops of the Frontier Formation in northeast Utah and central Wyoming. They formed by the early cementation of sand by calcite. Somewhat weathered and eroded giant cannonball concretions, as large as in diameter, occur in abundance at &quot;Rock City&quot; in Ottawa County, Kansas. Large and spherical boulders are also found along Koekohe beach near Moeraki on the east coast of the South Island of New Zealand. The Moeraki Boulders, Ward Beach boulders and Koutu Boulders of New Zealand are examples of septarian concretions, which are also cannonball concretions. Large spherical rocks, which are found on the shore of Lake Huron near Kettle Point, Ontario, and locally known as &quot;kettles&quot;, are typical cannonball concretions. Cannonball concretions have also been reported from Van Mijenfjorden, Spitsbergen; near Haines Junction, Yukon Territory, Canada; Jameson Land, East Greenland; near Mecevici, Ozimici, and Zavidovici in Bosnia-Herzegovina; in Alaska in the Kenai Peninsula Captain Cook State Park on north of Cook Inlet beach and on Kodiak Island northeast of Fossil Beach. This type of concretion is also found in Romania, where they are known as &quot;trovants&quot;.

===Hiatus concretions===
Hiatus concretions are distinguished by their stratigraphic history of exhumation, exposure and reburial. They are found where submarine erosion has concentrated early diagenetic concretions as lag surfaces by washing away surrounding fine-grained sediments. Their significance for stratigraphy, sedimentology and paleontology was first noted by Voigt who referred to them as &quot;Hiatus-Konkretionen&quot;. &quot;Hiatus&quot; refers to the break in sedimentation that allowed this erosion and exposure. They are found throughout the fossil record but are most common during periods in which calcite sea conditions prevailed, such as the Ordovician, Jurassic and Cretaceous. Most are formed from the cemented infillings of burrow systems in siliciclastic or carbonate sediments.

A distinctive feature of hiatus concretions separating them from other types is that they were often encrusted by marine organisms including bryozoans, echinoderms and tube worms in the Paleozoic and bryozoans, oysters and tube worms in the Mesozoic and Cenozoic. Hiatus concretions are also often significantly bored by worms and bivalves.

===Elongate concretions===
Elongate concretions form parallel to sedimentary strata and have been studied extensively due to the inferred influence of phreatic (saturated) zone groundwater flow direction on the orientation of the axis of elongation. In addition to providing information about the orientation of past fluid flow in the host rock, elongate concretions can provide insight into local permeability trends (i.e., permeability correlation structure; variation in groundwater velocity, and the types of geological features that influence flow.

Elongate concretions are well known in the Kimmeridge Clay formation of northwest Europe. In outcrops, where they have acquired the name &quot;doggers&quot;, they are typically only a few meters across, but in the subsurface they can be seen to penetrate up to tens of meters of along-hole dimension. Unlike limestone beds, however, it is impossible to consistently correlate them between even closely spaced wells.

===Moqui Marbles===

Moqui Marbles, also called Moqui balls or &quot;Moki marbles&quot;, are iron oxide concretions which can be found eroding in great abundance out of outcrops of the Navajo Sandstone within south-central and southeastern Utah. These concretions range in shape from spheres to discs, buttons, spiked balls, cylindrical forms, and other odd shapes. They range from pea-size to baseball-size.

The concretions were created by the precipitation of iron, which was dissolved in groundwater. The iron was originally present as a thin film of iron oxide surrounding sand grains in the Navajo Sandstone. Groundwater containing methane or petroleum from underlying rock beds reacted with the iron oxide, converting it to soluble reduced iron. When the iron-bearing groundwater came into contact with more oxygen-rich groundwater, the reduced iron was converted back to insoluble iron oxide, which formed the concretions. It is possible that reduced iron first formed siderite concretions that were subsequently oxidized. Iron-oxidizing bacteria may have played a role.

===Kansas pop rocks===

Kansas pop rocks are concretions of either iron sulfide, &quot;i.e.&quot; pyrite and marcasite, or in some cases jarosite, which are found in outcrops of the Smoky Hill Chalk Member of the Niobrara Formation within Gove County, Kansas. They are typically associated with thin layers of altered volcanic ash, called bentonite, that occur within the chalk comprising the Smoky Hill Chalk Member. A few of these concretions enclose, at least in part, large flattened valves of inoceramid bivalves. These concretions range in size from a few millimeters to as much as in length and in thickness. Most of these concretions are oblate spheroids. Other &quot;pop rocks&quot; are small polycuboid pyrite concretions, which are as much as in diameter. These concretions are called &quot;pop rocks&quot; because they explode if thrown in a fire. Also, when they are either cut or hammered, they produce sparks and a burning sulfur smell. Contrary to what has been published on the Internet, none of the iron sulfide concretions, which are found in the Smoky Hill Chalk Member were created by either the replacement of fossils or by metamorphic processes. In fact, metamorphic rocks are completely absent from the Smoky Hill Chalk Member. Instead, all of these iron sulfide concretions were created by the precipitation of iron sulfides within anoxic marine calcareous ooze after it had accumulated and before it had lithified into chalk.
Iron sulfide concretions, such as the Kansas Pop rocks, consisting of either pyrite and marcasite, are nonmagnetic. On the other hand, iron sulfide concretions, which either are composed of or contain either pyrrhotite or smythite, will be magnetic to varying degrees. Prolonged heating of either a pyrite or marcasite concretion will convert portions of either mineral into pyrrhotite causing the concretion to become slightly magnetic.

=== Claystones, clay dogs, and fairy stones ===
Disc concretions composed of calcium carbonate are often found eroding out of exposures of interlaminated silt and clay, varved, proglacial lake deposits. For example, great numbers of strikingly symmetrical concretions have been found eroding out of outcrops of Quaternary proglacial lake sediments along and in the gravels of the Connecticut River and its tributaries in Massachusetts and Vermont. Depending the specific source of these concretions, they vary in an infinite variety of forms that include disc-shapes; crescent-shapes; watch-shapes; cylindrical or club-shapes; botryoidal masses; and animal-like forms. They can vary in length from to over and often exhibit concentric grooves on their surfaces. In the Connecticut River Valley, these concretions are often called &quot;claystones&quot; because the concretions are harder than the clay enclosing them. In local brickyards, they were called &quot;clay-dogs&quot; either because of their animal-like forms or the concretions were nuisances in molding bricks. Similar disc-shaped calcium carbonate concretions have also been found in the Harricana River valley in the Abitibi-Témiscamingue administrative region of Quebec, and in Östergötland county, Sweden. In Scandinavia, they are known as &quot;marlekor&quot; (&quot;fairy stones&quot;).

 are sandstone concretions found in Oligocene (~30 million years) aged sediments near Fontainebleau, France. Gogottes have fetched high prices at auction due to their sculpture-like quality.

<doc id="367518" wikidata="Q2607385" url="?curid=367518" title="Simone Melchior">
<text>Simone Cousteau (née Melchior; 19 January 1919 – 1 December 1990) was a French explorer. She was the first woman scuba diver and aquanaut, and wife and business partner of undersea explorer Jacques-Yves Cousteau.

Although never visible in the &quot;Undersea World of Jacques Cousteau&quot; series, Simone played a key role in the operation at sea. Acting as mother, healer, nurse and psychiatrist to the all-male crew for 40 years, her nickname was &quot;La Bergère&quot;, the Shepherdess. She led Jacques to the men and money who would build his scuba invention, she helped buy their beloved ship Calypso, saved the ship during a storm, and made sure each exploration achieved its objective.

==Life and career==
Simone was born on 19 January 1919 in Toulon, France. Her father Henri Melchior and both grandfathers Jules Melchior (paternal) and Jean Baehme (maternal) were admirals in the French Navy. Simone&#x27;s mother was Marguerite Melchior (née Baehme), affectionately called Guitte. She had two brothers: Maurice, and Simone&#x27;s twin, Michel.

In 1924, Henri Melchior, as a director with Air Liquide (France&#x27;s main producer of industrial gases), moved his family to Kobe, Japan. Simone learned Japanese at the age of five years.

Simone met her future husband, Jacques, at a cocktail party in 1937. He was a naval officer of 26 and she was 17. They were married at Saint-Louis-des-Invalides, in Paris, on 12 July 1937.

After a honeymoon in Switzerland and Italy the Cousteaus settled in Le Mourillon, a district of Toulon. They had two sons, Jean-Michel (born 6 May 1938) and Philippe Pierre (30 December 1940 – 28 June 1979). Both sons were born on the family&#x27;s kitchen table.

In 1942, Simone&#x27;s father provided financing and the manufacturing expertise of Émile Gagnan at Air Liquide to build Jacques Cousteau&#x27;s aqua-lung. Simone was indirectly to hold the key to this significant step in diving history. She was present in 1943 at the testing of the prototype for the aqua-lung, in the Marne River outside Paris. The new invention was employed to locate and remove enemy mines after World War II.

The Cousteau family&#x27;s underwater investigation and exploration led to the purchase of the minesweeper &quot;Calypso&quot; on 19 July 1950. Thomas Loel Guinness bought the ship and leased it to Jacques for a dollar a year. Simone sold her family jewels for the &quot;Calypso&quot;&#x27;s fuel, and her fur to buy a compass and gyroscope. The &quot;Calypso&quot; set off in 1952 on her maiden voyage, to the Red Sea. Simone was the only woman on board.

In 1963, Simone became the world&#x27;s first female aquanaut by living in Starfish House, an underwater habitat, for the final four days of the Conshelf II project.

Describing his wife, Jacques Cousteau said, &quot;She was the happiest out of camera range, in the crow&#x27;s nest of &quot;Calypso&quot;, for example, scanning the sea for whales. Nothing would get by her.&quot; He continued, &quot;She lives to spend hour after hour in the wind and the sun, watching, thinking, trying to unravel the mystery of the sea.&quot; Simone died in 1990 of cancer. She received a full military funeral, during which her ashes were scattered over the Sea of Monaco.

==Grant==

On 8 March 2021, the Women Divers Hall of Fame announced on International Women&#x27;s Day, that a new research grant in the name of the French diver, Simone Melchior-Cousteau was being launched.

<text>Prey is the thirteenth novel by Michael Crichton under his own name and his twenty-third novel overall. It was first published in November 2002, making it his first novel of the twenty-first century. An excerpt was first published in the January–February 2003 issue of &quot;Seed&quot; magazine&quot;.&quot; &quot;Prey&quot; brings together themes from two earlier Crichton best-selling novels, &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; and &quot;The Andromeda Strain&quot; and serves as a cautionary tale about developments in science and technology, in particular, nanotechnology, genetic engineering, and distributed artificial intelligence.

The book features relatively new advances in the computing/scientific community, such as artificial life, emergence (and by extension, complexity), genetic algorithms, and agent-based computing. Fields such as population dynamics and host-parasite coevolution are also at the heart of the novel.

Film rights to the book were purchased by 20th Century Fox.

==Plot summary==

The novel is narrated by protagonist Jack Forman, an unemployed software programmer who is a stay-at-home husband. His wife, Julia, serves as an executive for a nanorobotics company called Xymos, and claims to be working on revolutionary imaging technology, which takes up most of her time. This leads to Jack being suspicious of her having an affair.

In the novel, Julia shows Jack a video of Xymos nanobots being injected into a human test subject leaving Jack impressed yet suspicious of the new technology. The couple&#x27;s baby Amanda awakens in agony, but is cured instantly after an emergency room MRI is performed that same night. 

Julia begins to display strange and abusive behavior toward her family until she&#x27;s injured in a car crash, leaving Jack to consult Xymos where project manager Ricky is struggling with the nanobots.

Jack is taken to the Xymos research facility in Nevada&#x27;s Basin Desert, where he is given a tour of the lab and introduced to the programming team (Mae, Charley, David, Rosie, Bobby and Vince). He is shown a machine used to make nanobot assemblers from bacteria, though he isn&#x27;t shown the source code for said nanobots. Ricky claims that contractors improperly installed filters in a vent, causing assemblers, bacteria, and nanobots to be blown into the desert, where they began forming into autonomous swarms. These &quot;swarms&quot; appear to be clouds of solar-powered self-sufficient nanobots, reproducing and evolving (necroevolution) at rapid speeds. The swarms exhibit predatory behavior, killing wild animals through the use of code that Jack had worked on. Jack learns Julia was helping to make the swarms more benign, but they regressed when she stopped coming to the facility. 

Persuaded by Jack, the team decides to destroy the swarms, but are overwhelmed and retreat after the swarms kill David and Rosie. As night falls, Jack, Mae, and Bobby set out to find the swarms. While searching, they discover that the swarms are dragging Rosie&#x27;s corpse through the desert. The team is also shocked to discover that the swarms can replicate the physical features, perceptions, and motions of humans when they see the swarms form replicas of Ricky, David, and Rosie. The group follows Rosie&#x27;s body and find the swarms nesting in a cave and destroy the swarms, their nest, and their organic assembly plant using explosive thermite caps.

Returning to the plant, Jack, Mae, and Bobby are greeted by Julia, who had discharged herself from the hospital and acts strangely as the remaining team looks for the cause of the nanobots&#x27; escape. Mae discovers security footage of when they were in the desert. To Jack&#x27;s horror, the video reveals that Julia and Ricky had an affair, and shows Charley engaging in a vicious fight with Ricky and Vince before being killed by Julia, who transfers a swarm into his mouth by kissing him. Jack and Mae realize that Julia, Ricky, Vince and Bobby have all been infected by a symbiotic version of the nanobot swarms. These swarms do not show aggressive predatory behavior; instead, they take over human hosts, affecting their decision-making, and slowly devour them over time to produce more nanobots. This allows the swarms to remain hidden, while also allowing them to spread and contaminate other humans.

Jack comes up with a plan to destroy this new strain. He and Mae drink vials containing a form of phage that kills the nanobot-producing &quot;E. coli&quot; bacteria, thereby protecting them from infection by the nanobots. Jack then takes a sample of the phage and plans to pour it into the sprinkler system to vaccinate everyone in the facility. He has Mae alert Julia and the infected team, who set out to stop Jack. In the struggle that ensues, Jack is captured and thrown into a magnetic chamber. Jack feigns surrender when Julia walks in to interrogate him, but reactivates the magnetic chamber, remembering the incident with Amanda in the MRI. Julia&#x27;s swarm is pulled away by the magnetic field to temporarily reveal the real Julia, who is gradually being consumed by the parasitic swarm. Before the swarm can repossess her body, Julia begs Jack to forgive her, says she loves him, and tells him to stop the swarms and save their children, as they have been infected too. Motivated, Jack runs to the roof, fights off the infected team, and finally manages to place the sample into the sprinkler system.

Jack and Mae are able to distribute the phage around the facility, destroying the infected. They escape the facility in a helicopter shortly before the facility explodes due to a methane gas leak combined with thermite that Mae had placed in the building. 

After returning home, Jack doses his children and sister with the phage, curing them as well. While Mae calls the U.S. Army and sends a sample of the phage to her lab, Jack discovers that Xymos had intentionally released the swarm into the desert so that it would evolve to stay in a cohesive group in the wind, but called him in to destroy the wild strain once it became uncontrollable.

==Reception==
In writing for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Jim Holt found the book &quot;absurd&quot; but exciting, and said that he &quot;kept turning the pages feverishly&quot;.

Peter Guttridge, writing for &quot;The Observer&quot;, said that it finds Crichton &quot;doing what he does best&quot;, in that he takes &quot;the very latest scientific advances&quot; and shows &quot;their potentially terrifying underbelly&quot;.

Even while pointing out the flaws in Crichton&#x27;s science, in &quot;Prey&quot;, multiple critics have praised the book&#x27;s impact and overall message.

<text>The Idle Race were a British rock group from Birmingham who in the late 1960s and early 1970s had a cult following but never enjoyed mass commercial success. In addition to being the springboard for Jeff Lynne, the band holds a place of significance in British Midlands&#x27; pop-rock history as a link between the Move, Electric Light Orchestra, the Steve Gibbons Band and Mike Sheridan &amp; The Nightriders.

==Band history==
===The Nightriders (1959–1966)===
The band was initially formed in 1959, under the name Billy King and the Nightriders, and consisted of the core members Dave Pritchard on rhythm guitar and Roger Spencer on drums, along with vocalist Billy King, bass guitarist Brian Cope, and lead guitarist Al Johnson. In 1962, King departed the band and was replaced by Mike Tyler, who changed his surname to Sheridan for performance purposes. This change coincided with the band&#x27;s rise (as Mike Sheridan and the Nightriders), culminating with a record deal with EMI in 1964. By this time Cope had been replaced by Greg Masters, and Johnson by lead guitarist and composer Roy Wood, in 1963 and 1964, respectively. Wood, who went on to find greater success in his subsequent bands, had his first commercially released composition with The Nightriders, &quot;Make Them Understand&quot;, which appeared as the B-side of a 1965 single.

By December 1965, Wood had joined forces with other musicians to form the Move, leading to his departure from the Nightriders in January 1966, when the Move started touring. Wood&#x27;s place in the Nightriders was filled by Johnny Mann, who had previously performed with Wood&#x27;s new bandmate in the Move, Carl Wayne, in Wayne&#x27;s previous band the Vikings. Sheridan, feeling that the band had come full circle, decided to depart the group shortly thereafter—although Sheridan later toured with various musicians using the Nightriders&#x27; moniker. The losses of Sheridan and Wood led the band to change direction. The band shortened their name to the Nightriders (dropping Sheridan&#x27;s name), reflecting the fact that the band was now going to lack a dedicated frontman and would feature various members performing lead vocals. Shortly after signing a new recording contract with Polydor Records, Mann departed and was replaced by Jeff Lynne, who at the time was an unknown guitar prodigy from the Birmingham district of Shard End. Their time at Polydor was short, and they recorded only one single, &quot;It&#x27;s Only The Dog&quot;/&quot;Your Friend&quot;, released in November 1966, with Lynne on lead guitar. Spencer sang lead on the A-side while the B-side was written and sung by Pritchard.

===The Idle Race (1966–1972)===
Eager to showcase Lynne&#x27;s vocal and guitar skills as well as his growing cache of catchy Beatlesque songs, and wishing to embrace the new psychedelic movement, the group changed its name again, first to the Idyll Race and then to the Idle Race. Wood, now a major star as the Move became a successful chart act, helped arrange a partnership with pop producers Eddie Offord and Gerald Chevin for the Idle Race. In 1967, the band were the first major signing by the new British arm of Liberty Records. Only their first single (not issued in the UK) and their first album got released in the US on Liberty.

The group were well received by the music press for their melodies, whimsical lyrics, and inventive production. They often appeared on the same bill with such bands as the Spencer Davis Group, the Who, Small Faces, Pink Floyd, the Moody Blues, Status Quo, Tyrannosaurus Rex, Yes, Free, and the Move. In addition to original material, their set list included extended covers of Steppenwolf&#x27;s &quot;Born to Be Wild&quot;, the Jimi Hendrix Experience&#x27;s &quot;Purple Haze&quot;, Moby Grape&#x27;s &quot;Hey Grandma,&quot; The Lemon Pipers&#x27; &quot;Blueberry Blue,&quot; The Doors&#x27; &quot;Love Me Two Times&quot;, and an electric version of &quot;Debora&quot; by Tyrannosaurus Rex.

BBC disc jockeys such as John Peel and Kenny Everett were big boosters of the group. But despite critical respect and famous admirers such as The Beatles and Marc Bolan, Idle Race failed to catch on with the public.

Bad luck sabotaged efforts from the start. Their debut single on Liberty, a cover of Wood&#x27;s &quot;Here We Go &#x27;Round the Lemon Tree&quot;, was scheduled for release and heavily promoted in September 1967. When the Move&#x27;s version began getting national airplay around the UK as the B-side of the hit &quot;Flowers In The Rain,&quot; Liberty abruptly pulled the single in the UK. It was, however, released by Liberty in the US. The record company replaced it in the UK with Lynne&#x27;s &quot;Impostors of Life&#x27;s Magazine&quot; in October.

&quot;The Skeleton and the Roundabout&quot; (February 1968) and &quot;The End of the Road&quot; (June 1968) suffered similar fates. Work continued throughout the year on the Idle Race&#x27;s debut album, the group commuting in from Birmingham to London on Sundays, when they were granted free studio time at Advision. The resulting album, &quot;The Birthday Party&quot;, was released in October of that year.

Lynne and Wood&#x27;s mutual respect and friendship deepened. The demo for the Move hit &quot;Blackberry Way&quot; was recorded in Lynne&#x27;s front room and borrowed motifs from the Idle Race; the chorus of Lynne&#x27;s 1969 song &quot;Days of the Broken Arrows&quot; lifted part of a riff from the Move&#x27;s &quot;Wild Tiger Woman&quot;.

Lynne received an offer to replace Trevor Burton in the Move in February 1969 but declined with hopes of steering The Idle Race to commercial success — and producing the band&#x27;s second LP for Liberty.

The self-titled &quot;Idle Race&quot; was released in September 1969 in the UK with sleeve photography and design by Michael Hasted. The two Lynne-penned and produced singles that preceded the LP, &quot;Days of the Broken Arrows&quot; (April 1969) and &quot;Come With Me&quot; (July 1969) also failed to chart. &quot;Idle Race&quot;, the first album to be produced by Lynne, flopped.

In January 1970, Lynne accepted a second offer by Wood to join the Move, on condition that they would eventually retire that band and concentrate on a new venture, Electric Light Orchestra.

Lynne made two albums, &quot;Looking On&quot; and &quot;Message from the Country&quot;, and a handful of singles with the Move, including the first version of &quot;Do Ya&quot;, as work on the first ELO album continued in the studio throughout 1970 and 1971. The Move, now comprising just Wood, Lynne and drummer Bev Bevan, ceased touring in 1970, and adopted the name ELO permanently in 1972.

Meanwhile, Mike Hopkins (guitar) and Dave Walker (vocals) were hired to replace Lynne in the Idle Race. A cover of Mungo Jerry&#x27;s &quot;In the Summertime&quot; on Liberty in 1970 finally got them into the top 10 in Argentina. A cover of Hotlegs&#x27; &quot;Neanderthal Man&quot; did not fare as well. In 1971 the band produced their final album, &quot;Time Is&quot;, for Regal Zonophone (UK only); despite this, the band collapsed shortly thereafter with the departures of remaining founding members Pritchard and Spencer (who later became comic &quot;Ollie Spencer&quot;), along with Hopkins and Walker. Sole remaining member Greg Masters built another version of the band with guitarists Dave Carroll and Bob Wilson and drummer Bob Lamb, with Steve Gibbons being recruited later as front-man. Ultimately, this lineup was short-lived: Masters himself departed in February 1972 and was replaced by Bob Griffin, whose tenure in the band was brief and who was replaced by former the Move member Trevor Burton. The Idle Race then, finally, disbanded, with the final lineup becoming the founding lineup of the Steve Gibbons Band.

<doc id="367526" wikidata="Q549586" url="?curid=367526" title="Nemo me impune lacessit">
<text> () is the national motto of Scotland. It also served as the national motto of the historic Kingdom of Scotland prior to the Treaty of Union 1707. 

The motto was the Latin motto of the Royal Stuart dynasty of Scotland from at least the reign of James VI when it appeared on the reverse side of merk coins minted in 1578 and 1580. It is the adopted motto of the Order of the Thistle and of three Scottish regiments of the British Army. 

The motto also appears, in conjunction with the collar of the Order of the Thistle, in later versions of the royal coat of arms of the Kingdom of Scotland and subsequently in the version of the royal coat of arms of the United Kingdom used in Scotland. It has been loosely rendered in Scots as (in Scottish Gaelic , ). It more or less translates as &#x27;No one can harm me without (detrimental) consequence&#x27; or &#x27;Whatever harm comes to me, shall be returned&#x27;.

== Possible origin of the motto==
According to legend, the &quot;guardian thistle&quot; (see Cirsium vulgare) played a vital part in Alexander III, King of Scots&#x27; defence of the Kingdom of Scotland against a night-time raiding party of Vikings under King Haakon IV of Norway, prior to the Battle of Largs (1263): one or more raiders let out a yell of pain when stepping on a prickly thistle, thus alerting the Scots. In the motto &quot;No one harasses me with impunity&quot; (Latin: ), &quot;me&quot; was therefore originally the thistle itself, but by extension now refers to the Scottish regiments which have adopted it.

The modern form of the motto was used by Francesco I, Duke of Milan and had been used in Britain on the colours of the Scottish Royalist officer John Urry during the English Civil War. It was also used by the Parliamentarian propagandist Marchamont Nedham as the motto for his newsletters.

Another traditional source appears in the form of a Scots proverb, &quot;Ye maunna tramp on the Scotch thistle, laddie&quot;, this being immortalised in marble by Glasgow monumental sculptors James Gibson &amp; Co. for the Kelvingrove International Exhibition of 1888. The phrase &quot;Wha daur meddle wi&#x27; me?&quot; also appears in a traditional border ballad entitled &quot;Little Jock Elliot&quot;, which recalls the exploits of a 16th-century Border Reiver (&quot;John Elliot of the Park&quot;), with particular reference to an infamous encounter in the summer of 1566 with James Hepburn, 4th Earl of Bothwell, the third husband of Mary, Queen of Scots.

The French city of Nancy has a similar motto, &quot;Non inultus premor&quot; (&quot;I cannot be touched unavenged&quot;), also a reference to the thistle, which is the symbol of the region of Lorraine.

==Present and historical use of the motto==

===In the British Isles and Commonwealth===
The motto of the Most Ancient and Most Noble Order of the Thistle, the Scottish chivalrous order, is also that of the British Army regiments The Royal Regiment of Scotland, Scots Guards and Royal Scots Dragoon Guards. It was also the motto of several former units of the British Army, including the Royal Scots, Royal Scots Greys, Royal Highland Fusiliers and Black Watch, some of which went on to be amalgamated to form the Royal Regiment of Scotland in 2006. The motto is also that of the Royal Company of Archers and has been displayed upon the unit&#x27;s second standard since 1713, following the grant of a Royal charter by Queen Anne.

During the reign of Charles II, the motto, appearing on a scroll under the shield and overlying the compartment, was added to the Royal coat of arms of Scotland, as displayed in relief above the entrance to Holyrood Palace. Since 1707 it has appeared in the Scottish version of the arms of British Monarchs, including the present Royal coat of arms of the United Kingdom used in Scotland. The motto appears in conjunction with the collar of the Order of the Thistle, which is placed around the shield. (The collar of the order appears in earlier versions of the Royal coat of arms of Scotland, but without the order motto.)

The motto of the Order of the Thistle () should not be confused with the motto of the Royal arms (&quot;In Defens&quot;), which appears on an escroll above the crest in the tradition of Scottish heraldry (&quot;In Defens&quot; being an abbreviated form of the full motto &quot;In My Defens God Me Defend&quot;). is displayed prominently above the Gatehouse entrance added to Edinburgh Castle in 1888.

Armed forces units elsewhere have also adopted this historic motto. In Australia, members of Heavy Weapons Platoon (DFSW) of the 3rd battalion (PARA) Royal Australian Regiment proudly use this motto as a symbol of platoon brotherhood and bonds forged in service together, the motto was also used by the Victoria Scottish Regiment, which subsequently became 5th Battalion Royal Victoria Regiment (RVR) which now forms one of the rifle companies of the RVR. (The motto is also used by the RVR Pipes and Drums Association). The Black Watch (Royal Highland Regiment) of Canada, a reserve infantry regiment of the Canadian Forces, also bears this motto (the motto appearing upon the regimental cap badge).

The motto is also that of the Cape Town Highlanders Regiment, a reserve mechanised infantry unit of South African Army.

The Caledonian Railway used the motto as part of its crest, until &quot;grouped&quot; into the London, Midland and Scottish railway in 1923.

The motto (with the verb in the future tense [lacesset]: &quot;Nemo Me Impune Lacesset&quot;) appears as a reverse inscription on the Scottish &quot;Bawbee&quot; (6 pence) coin of King Charles II surrounding a crowned thistle. Examples exist for 1677, 1678 and 1679. The coin is scarce but not considered rare. This coin is of copper, and was later revalued as a half penny.

The motto appears as an inscription on the rim of both the 1984 (and 1989) &quot;Thistle and royal diadem&quot; and the 1994 (and 1999) &quot;Lion rampant&quot; designs of the &quot;Scottish&quot; themed editions of the British one pound coin, and again on the rim of one of two new &quot;floral&quot; designs for 2014.

Union College, University of Queensland, Australia, also adopted the motto.

The motto also appears on the back collar of Edinburgh Rugby official kit.

===In continental Europe===
In Belgium, the 1st Squadron of the Belgian Air Force bears the motto.

The motto was also used by the Italian noble family Malacrida, of Como.

Wilhelm II, German Emperor used the motto in a telegram to Foreign Minister Bernhard von Bülow on 7 November 1897 following the Kiautschou Bay concession, arguing that Chinese aggression towards Catholic missionaries would no longer be tolerated, and would be met with swift military action.

The motto also appears above the entrance of a gate in Gent (see :nl:Citadel van Gent).

It was the motto of the Swedish &quot;Tre Kronor&quot;-class cruiser HSwMS &quot;Göta Lejon&quot;.

It&#x27;s the motto of Smålands Nation in Uppsala.

===In North America===

The 1st Battalion, 24th Marines of the United States Marine Corps uses the phrase as its motto.

It is also referred to in the Edgar Allan Poe story &quot;The Cask of Amontillado&quot; (Poe was adopted by a Scottish merchant), and in Stanisław Lem&#x27;s &quot;Fiasco&quot;.

The motto also appears (with the verb in the future tense: &quot;Nemo Me Impune Lacesset&quot;) above an American timber rattlesnake on a 1778 $20 bill from Georgia as an early example of the colonial use of the coiled rattlesnake symbol, which later became famous on the Gadsden flag. The phrase also occasionally appears on mourning bands worn over the badges of law enforcement officers in the United States.

 is the motto of Dartmouth College&#x27;s independent conservative newspaper, &quot;The Dartmouth Review&quot;.

The motto also appears on the crest of the Grand National Curling Club.

The motto is adopted by the eponymous heroine of Fran Ross&#x27;s 1974 novel, Oreo, republished in 2000 by Northeastern University Press&quot;.&quot;

The motto was seemingly adopted by Elon Musk in a January 2025 post pinned to his X account, erroneously attributing the saying to Sulla.

=== In India ===
On 10 December 1992, addressing Gentleman Cadets at the Indian Military Academy, India&#x27;s Field Marshal Sam Manekshaw conveyed the motto from a regiment he had served in Scotland, first conveying the Latin form, &quot;Nemo me impune lacessit&quot; and then translating it for the GCs:
===In fiction===
* In the short story &quot;The Cask of Amontillado&quot; by Edgar Allan Poe, is the motto on the family coat of arms of the character Montresor.
* In the 1986 science fiction novel &quot;Fiasco&quot; by Stanislaw Lem, is quoted on several occasions in response to hostile acts during attempted contacts with an alien civilisation
* In the 1994 novel &quot;Mortal Causes&quot; by Ian Rankin, the motto is a clue in solving a young man&#x27;s murder.
* In the miniature wargame &quot;Warhammer 40,000&quot;, the motto is used by the Raven Guard
* In the miniature wargame &quot;Battletech&quot;, the motto is used by the Black Watch, the elite guard of the Star League Defense Force.

<doc id="367532" wikidata="Q1070440" url="?curid=367532" title="Scum (Napalm Death album)">
<text>Scum is the debut studio album by English grindcore band Napalm Death, released on 1 July 1987 by Earache Records. The two sides of &quot;Scum&quot; were recorded by two different lineups in sessions separated by about a year; the only musician in both incarnations was drummer Mick Harris.

&quot;Scum&quot; sold over 10,000 copies in its first year of release, reaching number four on the UK Indie chart. Since then, it has become known as a formative release in the grindcore genre. In 2005, &quot;Scum&quot; was voted the 50th best British album of all time by &quot;Kerrang!&quot; readers, and in 2009, it was ranked number five in &quot;Terrorizer&quot;&#x27;s list of essential European grindcore albums; it is also listed in Robert Dimery&#x27;s book &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;. Loudwire put it in the list of the best 10 metal albums of 1987.

==Style==
The two sides are very different, and the two taken together serve to bridge stylistic elements of heavy metal and punk rock. While the songs on the A-side are influenced heavily by hardcore punk and anarcho-punk, the vocals and lower-tuned electric guitars on the B-side anticipate subsequent developments in extreme metal. Additionally, the album contains elements of jazz and noise music. The album has been described as &quot;rock &amp; roll kicks taken to an almost ridiculous extreme.&quot; The album features extremely brief compositions and exceedingly fast tempos, with some songs using quadruple-time beats. The album makes use of &quot;raspy,&quot; &quot;deep, grunted vocals&quot;, or death growls. Lyrical themes on the album include left-wing politics.

According to AllMusic, the album&#x27;s songs are structured around &quot;hyperconcentrated Black Sabbath-via-Motörhead-and-Metallica approaches as starting points,&quot; eventually exploding into blast beats and noise when &quot;everyone concentrates on nothing but speed itself.&quot; 

==Recording and release==

===Background===

Napalm Death formed in 1981. After various personnel changes, demo recordings, and a period of dormancy, they had returned to activity in 1985 with a lineup of Nicholas Bullen (vocals, bass), Justin Broadrick (guitar), and Miles Ratledge (drums). Around this time, Daz Russell, promoter of the club The Mermaid in Birmingham, had essentially made Napalm Death the punk &quot;house band&quot; of his club. Due to the local popularity of the band, this arrangement secured him the visitor numbers sufficient to generate enough revenue to pay the foreign bands playing at the club. Napalm Death therefore supported all the hardcore punk bands that Russell booked, including Anti Cimex, Sacrilege, Heresy, Concrete Sox, and The Varukers. Bassist Peter Shaw also briefly played with the band while Bullen sang exclusively. After recording their demo &quot;Hatred Surge&quot;, Shaw and founding drummer Ratledge departed, and the latter was replaced by Mick Harris in November 1985. Harris aspired to play faster than any other drummer, citing U.S. hardcore bands Siege and Deep Wound as influences. The first live appearances with this lineup took place in January 1986 with Amebix and Instigators, and the new lineup had allowed the band to become more musically adept. In March 1986, the group entered Flick Studios and recorded the demo &quot;From Enslavement to Obliteration&quot;, combining their initial anarcho-punk influences with riffs akin to those of Celtic Frost and extremely fast drumming.

===Recording of the A-side===

Napalm Death intended to record another demo in 1986, as no record label had yet shown interest in the band. Russell offered to release either a single or split for the band on his newly formed independent label. The band thus entered the Rich Bitch studio in Birmingham to record a set of songs. The recordings took place over two days, with sessions happening at night due to the studio charging a lower hourly recording rate during this time. Around 20 friends of the band were present for the sessions. These included the members of the bands Head of David and Unseen Terror, who are listed on the record as producers, as well as Damian Thompson of Sacrilege, from whom Broadrick had borrowed an effects pedal.

The songs came from different phases of the band&#x27;s development. Some material was based on ideas from Justin Broadrick dating to 1983, while others derived from material written by Broadrick and Ratledge for the &quot;Hatred Surge&quot; demo. The songs &quot;The Kill&quot;, &quot;You Suffer&quot;, and &quot;Death by Manipulation&quot; were included on &quot;Scum&quot;, but the versions of the songs recorded during this session were faster than the originals. Russell paid the initial studio costs, but Napalm Death decided not to give him the master tapes because he had never paid them for their appearances at The Mermaid.

===Line-up changes===
After the recording sessions, there was tension in the band. Bullen attributed this to the fact that every band member wanted to take over the leading role. In September 1986, Jim Whiteley joined as bass player while Bullen switched to singing exclusively. This coincided with Bullen&#x27;s loss of interest in Napalm Death and music more generally. After a concert in Leeds with Sacrilege, Broadrick left the band to play drums in Head of David, which was at the time more successful than Napalm Death after having released an album for Blast First, the label of Sonic Youth. Broadrick was initially replaced by Frank Healy, and later by the 16-year-old Bill Steer. Soon thereafter, Bullen left Napalm Death to pursue his studies of English literature and philosophy at the university. Lee Dorrian joined as the band&#x27;s new singer. The new lineup&#x27;s sound reflected an increasing interest in heavy metal while remaining rooted in anarcho-punk.

===Recording of the B-side===

In late 1986, the band came into contact with Digby Pearson, who had just founded Earache Records. Pearson had learned of the band after receiving the recordings from Broadrick. In March 1987, Napalm Death signed a contract with Pearson, who bought the master tape from the 1986 recordings and booked the Rich Bitch Studio to record further material. Harris had written 16 songs with Steer in his parents&#x27; house in Liverpool. Two songs were written by Steer, and Whiteley was involved in some of the arrangements. Harris had written tracks on a guitar despite not being able to play the instrument. He did this simply by tuning the A and E strings down and removing the others, recording the guitar parts on a tape recorder. The lyrics were written by Whiteley, while Dorrian added some material on the night before the recordings. The band had only one three-hour rehearsal before entering the studio in May 1987.

The recordings took place under the direction of sound engineer Mike Ivory. As was the case for the recording sessions yielding the A-side, the B-side recording sessions were held overnight for reasons related to cost. The recordings were difficult, especially for Dorrian, who was in a recording studio for the first time. Harris had to signal to Dorrian to indicate the moments at which he was to begin singing. The band was not satisfied with the initial mix, particularly due to the drum sound. Pearson organized a final studio mixing session, which took place from 4 to 8 o&#x27;clock in the morning, to fix the initial mixes.

===Initial release===
Pearson wanted to release Napalm Death&#x27;s debut not as a mini-album and not as a split, but instead as a complete album. He did not believe, however, that the current lineup, which had not been active for long, could write enough songs for an album in a reasonable time. He therefore decided to use the previously unused recordings from August 1986 as an A-side for an album. There was little reason to expect the record to achieve commercial success, and for this reason, the budget for the record&#x27;s production was very low. Pearson spent nearly all of his savings for the recording, production, and promotion of the album. It was his label&#x27;s third release, and the album&#x27;s failure would have potentially spelled bankruptcy. In June 1987, the album was released in a pressing of 2000 copies.

==Reception==
===Commercial success===
Earache Records secured a contract with Revolver Records and thus was able to ensure the nationwide distribution of its releases, so that the first edition of the album sold out within a few weeks. Simultaneously, Napalm Death embarked upon the first tour in their history along with Ripcord. The most decisive cause of the commercial success of &quot;Scum&quot; came when radio host John Peel played songs from the album on his radio show BBC Radio 1 and subsequently invited the band to perform a Peel Session. On 13 September 1987, Napalm Death recorded twelve tracks with a total playing time of 5 minutes and 40 seconds, which were first broadcast on 22 September 1987. The broadcast gave the album national attention, and Earache Records thus pressed another edition. This sold well, leading Napalm Death to procure the number 8 spot on the UK Indie Charts. Within a few weeks of the first Peel Session, about 10,000 units of the album had been sold.

===Later releases and legacy===
The first pressing of the CD (1988) included 54 tracks, adding the &quot;From Enslavement to Obliteration&quot; album and four bonuses. In 1994, the first two albums were re-released separately. A remastered version was released on 27 January 2012. The album cover was designed by Bill Steer&#x27;s Carcass bandmate Jeffrey Walker. The album covers came in varied colours: orange, gold, green, blue, and yellow.

The album stands as a landmark achievement. Natalie J. Purcell described the album a formative influence on the European grindcore, while Ian Christe called &quot;Scum&quot; the conclusion of a ten-year competition for the fastest and hardest sound, marking the point from which neither speed nor intensity could increase. The album is regarded as the &quot;central release of grindcore&quot; both musically and lyrically, marking &quot;the height of the discourse of extremization&quot; within the British punk scene. The song &quot;You Suffer&quot; was listed in the &quot;Guinness Book of Records&quot; as the world&#x27;s shortest song; the track is precisely 1.316 seconds long.

Napalm Death remained active in the years that followed, but by the 1991 departure of Mick Harris, all members that had played on either side of &quot;Scum&quot; had been replaced by new members.

AllMusic said the album takes …

<text>Norbert Jokl (February 25, 1877 – probably May 1942) was an Austrian Albanologist of Jewish descent who has been called the father of Albanology.

== Early life ==
Jokl was born in Bzenec (then Bisenz), Southern Moravia (now the Czech Republic), to Heinrich, a merchant, and Emilie née Haas. His older brother, Willhlem, died in 1895 at the age of 21. He graduated from high school cum laude and entered the University of Vienna to study law. He graduated summa cum laude on June 23, 1901.

== Further education ==
Eventually Jokl abandoned his pursuit of legal training, and he decided to devote himself to linguistics. He studied Indo-European linguistics, Slavistics, and Romanistics, eventually receiving a &quot;cum laude&quot; degree.

In the late autumn of 1903, he started training in the library of the University of Vienna, where he would work until 1938. 
At the age of 30, he began to actively study the Albanian language, a linguistic field that had not been widely studied at the time.

== Career ==
From 1913, he was a Privatdozent whose field was &quot;Indo-European linguistics with special consideration to Albanian, Baltic and Slavic languages“. In 1923, he became a &quot;Professor extraordinarius&quot;, and in 1937 a Hofrat. He wrote numerous works on Albanology and became a renowned specialist. In April 1933, the paleontologist and Albanologist Franz Nopcsa (Ferenc Nopcsa) shot his secretary and himself, leaving his Albanological papers to Jokl.

After Adolf Hitler came to power in Germany, Jokl&#x27;s manuscripts started being rejected and he was no longer invited to conferences. On May 20, 1938, he was discharged as a result of the Anschluss of Austria and was prohibited from entering his former place of work. The Dean of the Faculty of Philosophy, Viktor Christian, tried to save Jokl&#x27;s job, but this was in vain. Later that year, Jokl submitted an application (supported by the Dean) to be equalized with &quot;persons of mixed blood of 1st degree“ in order to have admittance to libraries. The application was rejected.

Georg Solta, who went on to become a professor of Indo-European linguistics, would often visit him during the following four years, in order to further his studies and to maintain personal interaction with his mentor. Solta says that Jokl lived alone ascetically, though a maid would prepare food for him. Two rooms were filled with books and all of his free time was dedicated to research.

Jokl tried to find a job abroad, but this was also in vain. His last chance was a librarian position that was created for him in Albania with a monthly salary of 600 Albanian franks. Franciscan priest and Albanian national writer, Gjergj Fishta, intervened through a letter, dated 23 September 1939 to Francesco Jacomoni, vice-regent in Albania to make Italy intervene with the Third Reich in order to allow Jokl transfer to Albania. Jokl himself wanted to emigrate to Albania. However, neither the efforts of Gjergj Fishta, nor those of Carlo Tagliavini, a professor of the University of Padua, nor the appeal of Galeazzo Ciano, Minister of Foreign Affairs of Italy, to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Germany, yielded the necessary permission for him to emigrate to Albania. In one of his applications, he also asked for permission to take along his library, but was opposed by Dean Christian, who was very interested in keeping Jokl&#x27;s extensive collection at the University. Jokl&#x27;s library also contained his life work and the handwritten supplements to the Albanian vocabulary by Gustav Meyer.

== Arrest and death ==
On March 4, 1942, Jokl was arrested by the Gestapo and transferred to the collection camp (&quot;Sammellager&quot;). Georg Solta, trying to save his teacher, appealed for Jokl&#x27;s freedom to Ernst Kaltenbrunner, the &quot;SS Gruppenführer&quot; in Vienna who had also been Solta&#x27;s schoolmate. However, Kaltenbrunner argued he had no power to save Jokl from deportation.

There is contradictory information as to Jokl&#x27;s death. It was reported that on May 6, 1942, he was taken to Maly Trostenets near Minsk, where he was murdered. However, according to another version, he died from mistreatment in a barracks in Roßau, Vienna.

After Jokl&#x27;s arrest, his former employer tried to ensure that Jokl&#x27;s library would be given to the University in case Jokl was not allowed to go to Albania. However, the Dean preferred that Jokl be sent to a concentration camp, as that would make acquisition of his works much easier. Paul Heigl, the director general of the National Library of Austria, also applied for custodianship of the collection. Despite Jokl&#x27;s bequeathing the library to Albania, it was confiscated on April 27, 1942 and sent to the National Library. In 1946, the Austrian National Library retained the holdings on the grounds that Jokl had not left any eligible relatives. Of the original more than 3,000 books, only about 200 can now be identified. Jokl&#x27;s life&#x27;s work, an edition of the &quot;Etymological Dictionary of Albanian&quot; by Gustav Meyer, with handwritten addendas, is untraceable.

== Posthumous honors ==
On April 29, 1982, the Senate of the University of Vienna decided to inscribe Norbert Jokl&#x27;s name to the board of honour of the University.

In 2012, Posta Shqiptare, the national postal service of Albania, honored Jokl with a postage stamp in a series commemorating foreign Albanologists, linguists who have studied the Albanian language. Also honored in the series were Eric Hamp and Holger Pedersen.

<text>Frank is a 
Scandal or satirical magazine founded in 1987 in Halifax, Nova Scotia.

A separate publication in Ottawa, Ontario, of the same name was published from 1989 to 2004, revived from 2005 to 2008 and began publication again in 2013. This publication was a legally separate entity, although it spawned from the Halifax publication.

The Halifax edition and Ottawa edition joined forces in early 2023, following a brief closure of the Halifax Frank in September 2022.

Both are now published out of Ottawa, with contributions from reporters in Vancouver, Ottawa and Halifax.

==Halifax edition==
The idea for &quot;Frank&quot; can be traced to Halifax-area newspaper publisher David Bentley. Using money he received from the sale of &quot;The Daily News&quot;, Bentley, along with Lyndon Watkins and Dulcie Conrad, started a bi-weekly &quot;gossip rag&quot; or &quot;scandal magazine&quot; which they gave the name &quot;Frank&quot;.

The first issue was published in November 1987 and focused on gossip about the private lives of the rich, famous and politically connected in the Maritimes. It was designed to sell the sensational news coverage that mainstream press in the Maritimes was averse to covering and was somewhat of an extension to Bentley&#x27;s vision for &quot;The Daily News&quot; during the 1970s and early 1980s.

Bentley followed a successful formula with &quot;Frank&quot; by feeding the need for sensational gossip among the rich and powerful as well as the average citizen. The publication found its niche in a Canadian media which was traditionally reluctant to pry into the personal lives of politicians and other notables, often covering material found nowhere else. All articles in &quot;Frank&quot; are published anonymously although some of its contributors have at times been revealed to be reporters working for more mainstream media outlets.

Unusually, the magazine had no real advertising and operated solely from its subscriptions, although it does contain a great deal of satirical &quot;advertising&quot;.

Bentley expanded the &quot;Frank&quot; franchise to include an Ottawa edition in 1989 with the help of former Canadian Press reporter Michael Bate, while continuing with his publication of the Halifax edition. The Halifax edition of &quot;Frank&quot; gained considerable coverage after scooping local and national media to reveal the charges of sexual assault against former Premier of Nova Scotia and Trudeau-era cabinet minister Gerald Regan. Regan was subsequently acquitted. Local targets of the magazines satire and gossip have frequently included members of the billionaire Sobey, Irving and McCain families, as well as prominent local media personalities and politicians in all three provinces.

Dulcie Conrad sold her share of the Halifax edition of &quot;Frank&quot; in the mid-1990s to Bentley and Watkins. In September 2000, Bentley and Watkins sold an equity stake in the Maritime edition of &quot;Frank&quot; to one of the magazine&#x27;s reporters, Clifford Boutilier.

From 2002 to 2004, David Bentley&#x27;s daughter Carolyn Wood was the editor/publisher of the Maritime edition.

In 2004, Wood handed control of the magazine to John Williams, previously a &quot;Frank&quot; staff reporter. No money changed hands.

Williams sold &quot;Frank&quot; Magazine to Cape Breton-born businessman Douglas Rudderham for an undisclosed sum in November 2010, in order to concentrate efforts on his gay publication, &quot;Gaze&quot; Magazine.
Based in Montreal, Rudderham is also the president and CEO of Pharmacy Wholesale Services, primarily a supplier of diabetic supplies.

In June 2011 conventional media outlets such as CBC and &quot;The Chronicle Herald&quot; reported that the publication&#x27;s newsroom underwent a massive shakeup when four of its five reporters left, three having been fired by managing editor Andrew Douglas and one resigning. CBC reported that the first reporter to be fired, Mairin Prentiss, occurred after she had questioned a recent column on sexism. The firing of Prentiss apparently triggered Walsh&#x27;s resignation, which was followed by terminations for Neal Ozano and Jacob Boon who allegedly acted insubordinately.

==Ottawa edition==

Bentley&#x27;s expansion of the &quot;Frank&quot; franchise from its Halifax base to include an Ottawa edition in 1989, with the help of Michael Bate, proved extremely successful during its first decade of publication, as the edition quickly outsold its Maritime cousin by feeding off the void of gossip news among mainstream media in the nation&#x27;s capital.

Bate subsequently bought out Bentley and his other partners to make the Ottawa edition of &quot;Frank&quot; independent of its Halifax roots, although both magazines maintained similar coverage and continued much as before.

Bate did make several changes including adding a &quot;Remedial Media&quot; section which printed gossip tidbits on the internal politics of Canadian media outlets. Michael Coren, whose humour column &quot;Aesthete&#x27;s Diary&quot; was retitled &quot;Michael Coren&#x27;s Diary&quot; after he revealed his true identity, was one of the few contributors ever to use his real name in the magazine.

The final page of the Ottawa edition of &quot;Frank&quot; also featured a humour column, usually satirizing the point of view of a real Canadian political figure such as Sheila Copps or Preston Manning. In later years, the back page column was titled &quot;Dick Little&#x27;s Canadian Beef&quot;. Little was not a real figure, but a curmudgeonly caricature holding mostly conservative views meant to satirize a typical &quot;angry Canadian.&quot;

The Ottawa edition of &quot;Frank&quot; received notoriety in 1991 when the magazine ran a satirical advertisement for a contest inviting young Tories to &quot; Caroline Mulroney.&quot; Mulroney&#x27;s father, then-Prime Minister Brian Mulroney, was upset and threatened to &quot;take a gun and go down there and do serious damage to these people&quot; on television. Bate would call the spoof &quot;clumsy&quot;, and state that it was intended to target Brian, rather than Caroline, though not regretting the incident as a whole.

The Ottawa edition of &quot;Frank&quot; broke a number of notable stories, including being the first to publish the tale of Mel Lastman&#x27;s wife&#x27;s shoplifting arrest and was the only Canadian publication to cover the divorce trial of cabinet minister Paul Dick. Other &quot;Frank&quot; targets included serial killer Karla Homolka, CBC Radio host Peter Gzowski, and comedian Dan Aykroyd. &quot;Frank&quot; continuously followed the marriages of personalities, such as CBC Television news anchor Peter Mansbridge with fellow journalist Wendy Mesley then with actress Cynthia Dale, and Bank of Montreal CEO Matthew Barrett with pin-up model Anne Marie Sten. The magazine was also known for outing public figures as gay, lesbian or bisexual; most notably, a 1996 cover story on musician Ashley MacIsaac&#x27;s sexuality spurred MacIsaac to come out.

Other regular features of the magazine included parody movie or television advertisements and a two-page fumetti comic which used television screenshots, usually of newscasts, to mock journalists and politicians through the use of satirical dialogue balloons.

Many of those who had been written about or &quot;Franked,&quot; threatened lawsuits, and many issues toward the end of Michael Bate&#x27;s ownership contained printed apologies as a means to warding off the expense of lawyers&#x27; fees. The magazine bit the bullet on only two legal battles—one to a Quebec judge and one to Mike Duffy, a Canadian television journalist whom the magazine deemed a &quot;fat-faced liar&quot; and had called &quot;Mike Puffy&quot; (in reference to his physical appearance). Although the magazine settled on the latter case, the legal expenses launched the Ottawa edition into a downward financial spiral.

In 2002 Bate made it known that he was looking for a buyer. A bid was soon on offer by Theo Caldwell, who had no publishing background and was apparently returning to Canada after a bid to become a Hollywood actor. Caldwell offered $150,000 for the company, and claimed to be interested in making &quot;Frank&quot; a &quot;kinder, gentler&quot; magazine. Bate rebuffed the offer due to his rejection of Caldwell&#x27;s vision for the publication.

The next year, another offer was made by a group of Toronto investors led by Fabrice Taylor, former business reporter for &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot;. After a reportedly bizarre meeting at Bate&#x27;s house, he sold the magazine to Taylor&#x27;s group. Taylor moved the magazine to Toronto and relaunched it in late 2003 — however, circulation dropped dramatically, and lingering financial difficulties resulting from libel lawsuits ended with the final issue on December 3, 2004. The Halifax edition was unaffected and continued publishing.

The Ottawa edition of &quot;Frank&quot; was resurrected after Bate reportedly reacquired the property from Taylor, returning the satire magazine to the nation&#x27;s capital. The new ownership created an online magazine using the name efrank.ca, with the first issue publishing on September 27, 2005. Several features from the original printed version of the Ottawa edition were retained and a full print version returned to newsstands in late November 2005 (issues are numbered as &quot;Volume 2&quot;). With the print version, subscription-by-mail again became available.

An announcement was sent on October 28, 2008 that the print and web versions of the publication were ceasing publication.

In May 2013, Bate announced an intention to revive &quot;Frank&quot; as an online publication in September or October 2013. &quot;Frank&quot; relaunched as a digital publication on October 1 with a metered paywall, in a blog format described as similar to Andrew Sullivan’s &quot;The Dish&quot;, with a subscription price between $10–15 per month.
It came out in December 2013 and biweekly after that in both digital and print editions.
