<text>The Labor Right (LR), also known as Labor Forum, Labor Unity or simply Unity, is one of the two major political factions within the Australian Labor Party (ALP). It is nationally characterised by liberal economic policies, and competes with the Labor Left faction, which leans toward democratic socialism.

Labor Right is composed of autonomous groups in each state and territory of Australia. The groups within the Labor Right come together as a broad alliance at the national level. The faction includes members with a range of political perspectives, including centrism, partial privatisation, Keynesianism, Labourism, and as a minority, social conservatism.

== State branches ==
Factional power usually finds expression in the percentage vote of aligned delegates at party conferences. The power of the Labor Right varies from state to state, but it usually relies on certain trade unions, such as the Australian Workers&#x27; Union (AWU), Transport Workers Union (TWU), the Shop, Distributive and Allied Employees Association (SDA), Plumbing and Pipe Trades Employees Union (PPTEU) and the Health Services Union (HSU). These unions send delegates to the conferences, with delegates usually coming from the membership, the administration of the union or local branches covered by their activists.

State-based factions (national sub-factions) which make up Labor Right include:
===New South Wales===
* Centre Unity
===Queensland===
* Labor Forum (dominated by the AWU)

===Australian Capital Territory===
* Centre Coalition
===Victoria===
* Labor Centre Unity (AWU: Consisting of Branch Members, Student Clubs, both federal and state members of parliament aligned with the Victorian branch of the Australian Workers&#x27; Union, and representatives from the Plumbing and Pipe Trades Employees Union)
* Labor Progressive Unity (The Cons: Consisting largely of Branch Members aligned to and supporters of Labor Deputy Leader Richard Marles and the Transport Workers Union)
* Labor Unity (The Shoppies: Consisting largely of branch members aligned to and supports of the Shop, Distributive and Allied Employees Association)
===Western Australia===
*WA Labor Unity (AWU, SDA, TWU).
*Progressive Labor (Consists of AWU, SDA, TWU and CFMEU) An alliance between WA Labor Unity and the &#x27;Industrial left&#x27; unions of WA, formed in 2019 for the purpose of binding at State conferences against some subgroups within WA&#x27;s Broad left; such as the UWU. Historically, the MUA and CFMEU have voted at State conferences in alignment with the Broad left.
===Northern Territory===
* Labor Unity
===South Australia===
* Labor Unity (dominated by the SDA).
===Tasmania===
* Labor Unity

== Political views ==
The faction is most famous for its support of Third Way policies such as the economic rationalist policies of the Bob Hawke and Paul Keating governments, including floating the Australian dollar in December 1983, reductions in trade tariffs, taxation reforms such as the introduction of dividend imputation to eliminate double-taxation of dividends and the lowering of the top marginal income tax rate from 60% in 1983 to 47% in 1996, changing from centralised wage-fixing to enterprise bargaining, the privatisation of Qantas and Commonwealth Bank, making the Reserve Bank of Australia independent, and deregulating the banking system.

<text>The Labor Left (LL), also known as the Progressive Left, Socialist Left or simply the Left, is one of the two major political factions within the Australian Labor Party (ALP). It is nationally characterised by social progressivism and democratic socialism and competes with the more economically liberal Labor Right faction.

The Labor Left operates autonomously in each state and territory of Australia, and organises as a broad alliance at the national level. Its policy positions include party democratisation, economic interventionism, progressive tax reform, refugee rights, gender equality and same-sex marriage. The faction includes members with a range of political perspectives, including Keynesianism, trade union militancy, Fabian social democracy, New Leftism, and democratic socialism.

== Factional activity ==

Most political parties contain informal factions of members who work towards common goals, however, the Australian Labor Party is noted for having highly structured and organised factions across the ideological spectrum.

Labor Left is a membership-based organisation which has internal office bearers, publications, and policy positions. The faction coordinates political activity and policy development across different hierarchical levels and organisational components of the party, negotiates with other factions on political strategy and policy, and uses party processes to try to defeat other groups if consensus cannot be reached.

Many members of parliament and trade union leaders are formally aligned with the Left and Right factions, and party positions and ministerial allocations are negotiated and divided between the factions based on the proportion of Labor caucus aligned with that faction.

== History ==
=== Labor left factions before the 1950s ===
Historian Frank Bongiorno has noted that there had been several organisations associated with the left wing of Labor before the 1950s, from the Australian Socialist League in the 1890s, the industrial left which emerged during World War I, the early supporters of Jack Lang, and the State Labor Party of the 1940s.

=== Labor Party split of 1955 ===
The modern Labor Left emerged from the Labor Party split of 1955, in which anti-communist activists associated with B. A. Santamaria and the Industrial Groups formed the Democratic Labor Party while left-wing parliamentarians and unions loyal to H. V. Evatt and Arthur Calwell remained in the Australian Labor Party. The earliest formal factional organization was the NSW Combined Unions and Branches Steering Committee (later known as the NSW Socialist Left), which was formed in January 1955.

The split played out differently across the country, with anti-communists leaving the party in Victoria and Queensland but remaining within in most other states. This created a power vacuum which allowed the Left to take control of the Federal Executive and Victorian state branch, while its opponents were preserved elsewhere. Tom Uren described the left of the Labor Party Caucus upon his election to Parliament in the late 1950s as &quot;a loosely knit grouping... consist[ing] mostly of anti-Catholics, although some members were militants or socialists&quot;.

From 1965, organised internal groups emerged to challenge the control of the Left, supported by figures such as John Button and Gough Whitlam. After the Victorian branch lost the 1970 state election in the midst of a public dispute with Whitlam over state aid for private schools, the South Australian Left, led by Clyde Cameron, and New South Wales Left, led by Arthur Gietzelt, agreed to support an intervention which saw the Victorian state branch abolished and subsequently reconstructed without Left control. Leftists in the Victorian party subsequently regrouped as the formally organized Socialist Left faction. In Queensland, the left coalesced around senator George Georges. Despite an increasing level of organisation in the grassroots party, this was not reflected within the Parliamentary caucus: Ken Fry noted that when he was elected to Parliament in 1974, meetings of left MPs were irregular and they responded to events in an ad hoc manner. The Labor Left suffered the loss of two of its key leaders in the mid-1970s with the downfall of Jim Cairns and the elevation of Lionel Murphy to the High Court of Australia, yet it continued to make advances in terms of nationwide organisation: right-wing power broker Graham Richardson has acknowledged that &quot;at the beginning of the 1980s the Left was the only national faction&quot;.

===Labor Left split in the 1980s===
Labor leftists continued to formalise their organisation into the 1980s. In New South Wales, the Steering Committee (which later became known as the Socialist Left in 1989) made advances in branches across the state in the late 1970s and early 1980s under the leadership of Peter Baldwin, initially in the suburbs of Sydney before spreading to the inner cities. This culminated in the deselection of the right-aligned MP for Sydney, Les McMahon, and the selection of Baldwin as Labor candidate for the seat. This was followed by other Labor Right MPs in Sydney&#x27;s Inner West similarly being usurped by left candidates.

In Tasmania, the Broad Left formalised itself in 1983, having taken control of the state party after reforms democratised it in 1976. In the Australian Capital Territory, the Left Caucus was founded after a left candidate was not preselected in 1982. However, the Left was unable to translate their organisational advances into a presence in the Hawke government: although about a third of the Parliamentary caucus were aligned with the Left at the time, only one member was appointed to Hawke&#x27;s first cabinet, Stewart West: leading left-winger Brian Howe placed high in the ministry ballot, but was relegated to a junior ministerial position. This came against the background of an increasing factionalising across the party and the emergence of a centre-left faction which joined with the Labor Right to dominate the Hawke government. Left influence was also restricted by the ALP&#x27;s binding pledge committing legislators to accept caucus discipline, allowing members little freedom to dissent. Left influence also declined at the national conference, with the faction losing its conference majority in the early 1980s.

During the 1980s, prolonged disputes over tactical issues and personality conflicts resulted in a split occurring within the New South Wales Labor Left, creating two sub-factional groupings; the &#x27;Hard Left&#x27; and the &#x27;Soft Left&#x27;, the latter of which was the successor of the Baldwinites. A significant event which caused the split was the election of the Secretary Assistant of the New South Wales Labor Party, where the Hard Left faction supported Anthony Albanese while the Soft Left faction supported Jan Burnswoods. The Hard Left faction was more closely aligned with left-wing groups external to the Labor Party, maintaining &quot;closer links with broader left-wing groups, such as the Communist Party of Australia, People for Nuclear Disarmament and the African National Congress&quot; as well as trade union officials, political staffers, lobbyists and student politicians, while the Soft Left&#x27;s main base of support was among rank-and-file party branch members. In terms of tactics, the Hard Left favoured a top-down approach of transactional negotiation with the Labor Right, whilst the Soft Left advocated a continuation of the Baldwinite bottom-up strategy of mobilising the grassroots membership to win party positions. This difference in approach led to struggles between the two factions over candidate selections, with the Hard Left using their control over the party apparatus in tandem with sections of the Right to deselect Soft Left MPs across the state, particularly in western Sydney, Newcastle and Wollongong. For example, in Newcastle Bryce Gaudry was deselected in favour of the Right&#x27;s Jodi McKay, following which about 130 members resigned or were expelled from the city&#x27;s ALP branches, previously the largest in the state. The factions also had differing views on policy. While members of both the Soft and Hard Left opposed the Hawke/Keating government&#x27;s privatisation of the Commonwealth Bank and Qantas, the Hard Left was seen as being more staunchly resistant to these changes.

=== Post 1990s ===
Lindsay Tanner, writing in the early 1990s, argued that the principal &quot;axis of division&quot; with the ALP cut across the traditional left-right divide, namely the opposition of &quot;rationalists&quot; and &quot;traditionalists&quot;, with the former supporting the Prices and Incomes Accord and union mergers, and abandoning or watering down their commitment to traditional Labor objectives such as public ownership, non-interventionism in foreign policy, and maintenance of working-class living standards, whilst the latter were negative towards the Accord, opposed to union mergers, sympathetic toward economic autarky, and attached to traditional Labor policy objectives. This divide can be seen through the career of Joan Kirner, who served as Premier of Victoria between 1990 and 1992 and was the first member of the modern Labor Left to lead a government, who supported the ascent of Paul Keating to the post of Prime Minister and his decision to privatise Commonwealth Bank to finance a bailout for the ailing State Bank of Victoria. This resulted in the formation of a splinter group from the Socialist Left, the Pledge faction, which opposed privatisation: in 1996, Pledge allied with another left split, the Labour Renewal Alliance, and the right-wing Labor Unity faction to take control of the party away from the Socialist Left.

<doc id="366534" wikidata="Q634885" url="?curid=366534" title="Ozma of Oz">
<text>Ozma of Oz was the third book of L. Frank Baum&#x27;s Oz series, published in 1907.

==Publication==
The full title of the first edition read &quot;Ozma of Oz: A Record of Her Adventures with Dorothy Gale of Kansas, Billina the Yellow Hen, the Scarecrow, the Tin Woodman, the Cowardly Lion and the Hungry Tiger; Besides Other Good People Too Numerous to Mention Faithfully Recorded Herein&quot;. The book was illustrated throughout in color by artist John R. Neill. It bore the following dedication: &quot;To all the boys and girls who read my stories – and especially to the Dorothys – this book is lovingly dedicated.&quot;

== Plot summary ==

On an ocean voyage with her uncle Henry to Australia, Dorothy is blown into the sea by a storm. She takes refuge on a floating chicken-coop, which washes ashore, along with the coop and a hen in it. The hen is able to speak; Dorothy gives it the name &quot;Billina&quot;. Exploring the land, Dorothy and Billina are menaced by a tribe of brightly dressed &quot;Wheelers&quot;, who have wheels instead of hands and feet. They also find a clockwork man named Tik-Tok (one of the first intelligent humanoid automata in literature), who joins them.

Tik-Tok informs Dorothy and Billina that they are in the Land of Ev, which currently has no competent ruler, its king having committed suicide after selling his family to the Nome King. The three visit the castle of Princess Langwidere, who has many exchangeable, detachable heads. When Dorothy refuses to let Langwidere take her head and add it to her collection, Langwidere has a tantrum and locks Dorothy in a high tower within the palace.
Luckily, Princess Ozma and her Royal Court of Oz (many of whom appeared in the two previous &quot;Oz&quot; books) just happen to cross over the Deadly Desert on a mission to free the royal family from the Nome King. Upon arriving, Ozma takes charge and has Dorothy, Billina and Tik-Tok released from Langwidere&#x27;s custody. The three join Ozma&#x27;s expedition to the Kingdom of the Nomes.

When they arrive, the Nome King reveals that he has magically transformed the royal family into ornaments. When Ozma asks him to release them, he offers a bargain: the Oz people may enter his chambers and try to guess which of the Nome King&#x27;s many ornaments they are, but if they fail to guess correctly, they will also become ornaments themselves. Ozma, the Tin Woodman, the twenty-seven soldiers of the Royal Army of Oz, Tik-Tok, and the Scarecrow all suffer this bizarre fate. Dorothy luckily selects one ornament which turns out to be one of the royal family&#x27;s young princes. 

Having overheard the Nome King discussing his transformations with another Nome, Billina knows how to recognize, by color, which ornaments are transformed people. She also knows that the King&#x27;s magic powers come from the Magic Belt that he wears. She is, therefore, able to free all the transformations. By exploiting the Nomes&#x27; fear of eggs, the Oz people are able to capture the magic belt and escape the Nome Kingdom with the royal family of Ev.

After returning the royal family of Ev to their throne, Ozma, Dorothy, and the others finally return to the country of Oz where a great victory celebration is held in the Emerald City&#x27;s royal palace. Dorothy is officially made a Princess of Oz, Billina elects to remain in Oz, and Ozma uses the magic belt to send Dorothy to Australia where she is happily reunited with her Uncle Henry.

== Themes ==
This is the first Oz book where the majority of the action takes place outside of the Land of Oz. Only the final two chapters take place in Oz itself. This reflects a subtle change in theme: in the first book, Oz is the dangerous land through which Dorothy must win her way back to Kansas; in the third, Oz is the end and aim of the book. Dorothy&#x27;s desire to return home is not as desperate as in the first book, and it is her uncle&#x27;s need for her rather than hers for him that makes her return. This is the first book to mention Dorothy&#x27;s last name, Gale.

== Adaptations ==
L. Frank Baum revisited this story for the plot of his 1913 musical &quot;The Tik-Tok Man of Oz&quot;, starring James C. Morton and Fred Woodward. Aside from Tik-Tok, a princess named Ozma, and a visit to the Nome King&#x27;s domain, the similarities between the book and the finished play were minimal, allowing Baum to re-adapt the latter as the eighth Oz book, &quot;Tik-Tok of Oz&quot;, in 1914.

A theatrical adaptation called &quot;Ozma of Oz: A Tale of Time&quot;, written by Susan Zeder with music by Richard Gray, premiered at the Poncho Theatre in Seattle, Washington, in 1979. On its 20th anniversary in 1999, it was revived with the addition of further songs and titled, &quot;Time Again in Oz.&quot;

Elements from &quot;Ozma of Oz&quot; and the previous novel, &quot;The Marvelous Land of Oz&quot;, were incorporated into the 1985 film &quot;Return to Oz&quot;, featuring Fairuza Balk as Dorothy. Although most of the plot was taken from &quot;Ozma&quot;, the action was chiefly relocated to the derelict Emerald City, ruled by Princess Mombi (Princess Langwidere in all but name, as well as keeping Ozma as her slave) and her Wheelers. In the second half of the film, Dorothy, Billina, Tik-Tok, Jack Pumpkinhead, and the Gump travel to the Nome King&#x27;s mountain, to rescue the Scarecrow from the King&#x27;s ornament collection, his item form being emerald green, unlike the book&#x27;s royal purple. The 1939 film&#x27;s famous ruby slippers were used in place of the Magic Belt.

The 1986 anime adaptation of the first novel included this story. It was later shortened and edited into a single feature for United States VHS and LaserDisc (and later DVD) release.

The book was also made into a Canadian animated feature film in 1987 called &quot;Dorothy Meets Ozma of Oz&quot;. It is a condensed version, running only 28 minutes. A video release features a live introduction by actor Michael Gross.

<doc id="366536" wikidata="Q1148782" url="?curid=366536" title="Kumamoto University">
<text>, abbreviated to &quot;Kumadai&quot; (熊大), is a Japanese national university located in Kumamoto, Kumamoto Prefecture in the Kyushu region of Japan. It was established on May 31, 1949, at which time the following institutions were subsumed into it; Kumamoto Teachers College (established in 1874), Kumamoto Pharmaceutical College (1885), the Fifth High School (1887), Kumamoto Medical College (1896), and Kumamoto Technical College (1906).

Currently, the university has seven faculties and eight graduate schools with a total of around 10,000 Japanese students and 500 international students from Asia, North America, South America, Europe, Africa, and Oceania. It is involved in the Top Global University Project, selected by the Japanese Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT), which aims to improve education in Japanese universities in order to increase global recognition and compete with the rest of the world.

The university was chartered by the Showa government on May 31, 1949, under a new Japanese education system reforming older system, merging five institutions of higher education in the city of Kumamoto which includes Kumamoto Teachers College ( &quot;Kumamoto shihan gakkō&quot;) established in 1887, Kumamoto Pharmaceutical College ( &quot;Kumamoto yakugaku semmon gakkō&quot;) established in 1885, the Fifth High School ( &quot;Dai-go kōtō gakkō&quot;) established in 1887, Kumamoto Medical College ( &quot;Kumamoto ika daigaku&quot;) established in 1896 and Kumamoto Technical College ( &quot;Kumamoto kōtō kōgyō gakkō&quot;) established in 1897 though the precursor of the university was founded in 1925 as a prefectural university of Kumamoto and subsequently it was reorganized as a national university in 1929.

Shinji appears in the franchise&#x27;s feature films and related media, video games, the manga &quot;Petit Eva: Evangelion@School&quot;, the &quot;Rebuild of Evangelion&quot; films, and the manga adaptation by Yoshiyuki Sadamoto.

Director Hideaki Anno conceived Shinji as a representation of himself, reflecting his four-year depression after the airing of his previous work, &quot;&quot;. Shinji&#x27;s insecurity and torment are explored through streams of consciousness and inner monologues, with episodes focusing on his introspection. Anno used psychoanalytical theories for his characterization, including the Freudian psychosexual development model. His design was created by Sadamoto. Shinji is voiced by Megumi Ogata in Japanese and by Spike Spencer and Casey Mongillo in English.

Shinji has received mixed responses from anime and manga publications. Although his complexity and realism have been praised, he is criticized for his insecurity and weaknesses. However, Shinji&#x27;s characterization in the spin-offs and the &quot;Rebuild of Evangelion&quot; films has been received more positively because of his courageous and self-confident personality, especially in the second installment, &quot;&quot;. Shinji has ranked highly in popularity polls and has been the subject of scholarly studies. Merchandise based on the character, such as action figures and perfumes, has been marketed.

== Conception ==
=== Design ===
&quot;Neon Genesis Evangelion&quot; character designer Yoshiyuki Sadamoto drew Shinji in an ordinary summer school uniform with a white shirt, making him &quot;an average character&quot;. He wanted a &quot;realistic and ordinary&quot; boy, a character &quot;that&#x27;ll be hard for others to make&quot;. Since Shinji lacks the enthusiasm and courage of other robot-anime heroes, Sadamoto gives him a different interpretation of heroism: &quot;Rather than a reflection of a hero, sort of a refraction of a hero&quot;. At first, he tried to create a character &quot;that would tap into the consciousness of today&#x27;s anime fans&quot;.

In one of Sadamoto&#x27;s original proposals, Shinji had long hair, which would have covered his face or fluttered in the wind during the dramatic scenes. However, Sadamoto changed his mind, finding his original design &quot;too wild&quot;. He tried for a look where one could see the forehead through the bangs, &quot;the look of a boyish young girl&quot;, giving him girl&#x27;s eyes. He modeled this version of Shinji on the titular Nadia from &quot;&quot;, and his face was designed to be almost identical to Nadia&#x27;s but with a different hairstyle. Furthermore, writer Andrew C. McKevitt described Shinji&#x27;s design, with his brown hair and blue eyes, as an example of , a deliberate lack of ethnic features included in the character design of Japanese fictional characters which &quot;allowed Japanese creations to be simultaneously Western and transnational&quot;.

===Development===
&quot;Neon Genesis Evangelion&quot; director Hideaki Anno was depressed for four years before the series began production. After the failure of &quot;Royal Space Force: The Wings of Honnêamise&#x27;s&quot; sequel, &quot;Aoki Uru&quot;, Gainax started planning a new series. According to Gainax co-founder Yasuhiro Takeda, ideas from &quot;Aoki Uru&quot; were borrowed for the new project, including the concept of &quot;not running away&quot;. For Takeda, the passage was &quot;something more than just transposing one show&#x27;s theme onto another... Anno inherited something from &quot;Aoki Uru&quot; — the determination not to run away from problems — and what we saw in &quot;Evangelion&quot; was maybe just a reflection of those feelings&quot;.

According to Hiroki Satō, the head of Gainax&#x27;s public relations office, the staff decided that the series would focus on &quot;how Shinji deals with things going on inside himself&quot;. According to Max Covill, Noriko Takaya, the protagonist from Anno&#x27;s directorial debut and one of Gainax&#x27;s previous works, &quot;Gunbuster&quot;, would have her moments of self-doubt and anxiety influence those of Shinji. Matthew Magnus Lundeen notes that Noriko could be seen as what would become Shinji based on how she behaves in the first four episodes of &quot;Gunbuster&quot;. Anno reflected his depression in the series, conceiving a world &quot;drenched in a vision of pessimism&quot;; he also began production &quot;with the wish that once the production complete, the world and the heroes would change&quot;. He originally proposed a character similar to Asuka Langley Soryu as the protagonist, following Gainax&#x27;s tradition of a female protagonist like in &quot;Gunbuster&quot; and &quot;&quot;. Sadamoto objected to a new female protagonist, saying that &quot;a robot should be piloted by a trained person, and if that person just happens to be a girl, then that is fine&quot;. However, he did not understand why a young girl &quot;would pilot a robot&quot;. He eventually suggested a boy as the main character; his relationship with Asuka, who became another primary character, was modeled after Nadia&#x27;s relationship with Jean. After accepting Sadamoto&#x27;s proposals, Anno suggested a male protagonist after Ryū Murakami&#x27;s works featured two fellow female pilots. He also gave Shinji two male friends, Tōji Suzuhara and Kensuke Aida, whose names were borrowed from Murakami&#x27;s novel &quot;Ai to gensō no fascism&quot;. Anno named Shinji after two of his friends, including &quot;Neon Genesis Evangelion&quot; animator Shinji Higuchi. For his last name, he chose the Japanese word &quot;Ikari&quot; (&quot;anchor&quot;), with the names of other characters in the series coming from nautical jargon or Japanese Imperial Navy warships.

Shinji was first conceived with slightly different features, which were changed over time. Originally, he was more mature, robust, and less introverted than in the final version; he was also portrayed as a studious boy, a &quot;quiet A-student&quot;. His scholastic conduct would not be seen positively but as a sign of passivity. According to Michael House, who was a former member of Gainax and a translator, Anno tried to find a way to end the series with a smiling Shinji and with more positive and communicative characters. However, he realized that &quot;the characters he&#x27;d created weren&#x27;t capable of whatever positive change&quot; and reach the result he had initially imagined, adjusting his original plans.

Anno fixed the protagonist at &quot;age fourteen&quot; since he considered it the age when &quot;independence of mind starts manifesting&quot;. Shinji&#x27;s character was conceived to reflect Anno&#x27;s personality &quot;both in conscious and unconscious part&quot;. He was, therefore, represented as &quot;a melancholic oral-dependent type&quot; caught &quot;in [an] oral stage&quot;, as Anno considered himself. Seeing Shinji as a reflection of Anno, assistant director Kazuya Tsurumaki avoided depicting him as a brave character since &quot;Anno isn&#x27;t that much of a hero&quot;. He stated that &quot;Shinji was summoned by his father to ride a robot, Anno was summoned by Gainax to direct an animation&quot;. Like other male protagonists in Gainax&#x27;s series, Shinji was conceived with a weak and insecure personality. Gainax wanted to reflect the psychological state of animation fans and Japanese society, in which fathers are always at work and emotionally absent.

=== Voice ===
Shinji is voiced by Megumi Ogata in the original Japanese version as well as in the films, spin-offs, video games, and the &quot;Rebuild of Evangelion&quot; film series. Ogata&#x27;s agent initially refused her participation in &quot;Evangelion&quot;, and she agreed due to her status as a newcomer, but Anno directly insisted on her. She also described Shinji as one of the &quot;most memorable&quot; roles of her career. His characterization required considerable physical and psychological effort. For example, in the eighteenth episode, Shinji cries and gasps during a fight; Ogata felt like her &quot;whole body [was] aching&quot;. She stated, &quot;Every time a new script arrived, every time I turned a new page, I was torn apart by a new pain&quot;. While dubbing the film &quot;The End of Evangelion&quot; (1997), she tried to achieve &quot;a higher synchronization rate with the general director than the TV series&quot;.

The &quot;Rebuild of Evangelion&quot; dub also presented obstacles. On the last day of recording for the film &quot;&quot; (2009), Ogata was forced to scream; she collapsed on the studio floor, and Anno sat with her. He praised her work and shook her hand, thanking her for &quot;keeping the character&#x27;s feelings unchanged&quot; and for adding her thirteen years of experience &quot;to the current Shinji&quot;.

In the following film, &quot;&quot; (2012), in which Shinji is treated coldly by the rest of the cast, Ogata stated that she felt like him and experienced emotional pain. She first saw the scene in which Kaworu Nagisa reveals to Shinji the conditions of planet Earth in her home when it was not yet animated. The recordings took place in March 2012, and she associated the destroyed landscape of the film with images of the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami, imagining that the catastrophe was her fault. During the pre-score, the drawings for Kaworu&#x27;s death scene were unclear in the animatic, and the staff animated the keyframes during the recording touch-ups. Ogata was shocked when she performed the scene and stated that her interpretation could reflect her emotional state, resulting &quot;kind of traumatic&quot;.

For the final installment, &quot;&quot; (2021), Ogata was involved more heavily in the plot&#x27;s development. Anno felt he could no longer understand Shinji since his current self was closer to Gendo, so he needed Ogata&#x27;s input. He also thought that the only people who could recognize Shinji&#x27;s feelings were Ogata herself and his assistant, Ikki Todoroki. Ogata also recounted that Anno had asked her what sort of ending she would prefer &quot;as Shinji&quot;. His adult self in the film is voiced by Ryūnosuke Kamiki, while Spike Spencer and Casey Mongillo voiced him in the ADV and Netflix English dubs, respectively.

== Appearances ==
=== &quot;Neon Genesis Evangelion&quot; ===
Shinji is the only child of Gendo Rokubungi and Yui Ikari, a student at Kyoto University who became a researcher. When he was three, Yui brought Shinji to the Gehirn research center in Hakone to see Evangelion 01&#x27;s first activation test. But in the ensuing accident, his mother disappeared before his eyes; after the accident, Gendo left Shinji with a guardian for about ten years. After becoming commander of the Nerv special agency, he invites Shinji to Tokyo-3 to pilot Evangelion Unit-01 and protect the city from creatures called Angels. Shinji reluctantly agrees and fights against the Angel Sachiel. After the Angel attack, Shinji starts to live with Misato Katsuragi, a Nerv officer and his new guardian, and attends school in Tokyo-3; after his arrival, he gradually changes and meets and befriends Toji Suzuhara and Kensuke Aida. When the Angel Ramiel tries to destroy Nerv headquarters, Shinji and fellow pilot Rei Ayanami work together to kill him. After Ramiel&#x27;s defeat, a nuclear-powered machine intended to fight the Angels called Jet Alone runs amok, and he and Misato stop it; during this time, Shinji gradually changes his attitude, trying to be more open and spontaneous. He also meets Asuka Langley Soryu, an Eva pilot from Germany, and in the eighth episode, they defeat the Angel Gaghiel together.

In the second third of the series, Shinji, Rei, and Asuka face more Angels, and Shinji begins bonding with his peers, especially Asuka, becoming more confident and assertive. When they are sent to fight the Angel Leliel, Shinji, receiving praise from Gendo and improving his synchronization scores, accepts his role as an Evangelion pilot. He decides to attack on his own but is sucked into a parallel universe by Leliel called the Dirac Sea, and within it, he confronts the Angel and his inner self; he is freed from the Angel by Yui, whose soul is within the Eva.

After Shinji is forced to fight Eva-03, controlled by the Angel Bardiel, with his classmate Toji Suzahara trapped inside, he decides to quit Nerv. Meanwhile, Angel Zeruel mutilates the other Evangelion units and defeats Rei and Asuka. After talking with his mentor and Misato&#x27;s lover, Ryoji Kaji, Shinji returns to Nerv to protect the city. He merges with its unit and frees the Evangelion; however, he is trapped in its core for a month. Rei sacrifices herself in the battle against the Angel Armisael to save Shinji, and she is later revived through one of her clones. Asuka runs away and falls into a coma, and Toji and Kensuke flee Tokyo-3. These events cause Shinji to fall into depression. In the twenty-fourth episode, he meets Kaworu Nagisa, Asuka&#x27;s substitute pilot, and they bond. Kaworu turns out to be the final Angel, and Shinji is forced to kill him. After Kaworu&#x27;s death, Instrumentality begins, and the souls of humanity unite in a collective consciousness. Shinji confronts his traumas and why he acts the way he does. After talking with most of the &quot;Evangelion&quot; cast and seeing a version of himself in a world where he leads a normal life, Shinji becomes aware of his potential and realizes the importance of his thoughts. He is congratulated by the rest of the cast.

=== &quot;The End of Evangelion&quot; ===
The 1997 film &quot;The End of Evangelion&quot; continues Shinji&#x27;s story, portraying his downward spiral into depression and the loss of his will to live. Shinji visits a comatose Asuka in the hospital, and when his pleas for attention go unanswered, he masturbates over her body. He remains catatonic while all Nerv personnel, including Misato, are killed during an attack. He then decides to pilot the Eva to save those still alive while Asuka is on the surface fighting the Mass Production Evas. However, he cannot reach her in time, and when he learns about Asuka&#x27;s defeat, the Evangelion moves on its own to let him reenter it. After seeing the mutilated corpse of Asuka&#x27;s Unit-02, Shinji&#x27;s intense emotions summon a spear called the Lance of Longinus to Earth, and the Eva becomes a tree of life.

Shinji then has long dreamlike exchanges with Misato, Rei, and Asuka about the pain of reality and his tensions with them. When he begs for Asuka&#x27;s attention, and she refuses him, arguing he only wants to use her as a crutch, Shinji begins Instrumentality, and humanity&#x27;s souls are united into one existence. After re-evaluating his position, he decides to live in a world where other people exist and returns to Earth, allowing other humans to return. Shinji, having placed grave markers in memory of most of the other characters, awakens sometime later, with Asuka lying next to him. He suddenly tries to strangle her but stops and breaks down when she regains consciousness and caresses his face.

=== &quot;Rebuild of Evangelion&quot; ===
In &quot;Rebuild of Evangelion&quot;, Shinji returns as the central protagonist; in &quot;&quot; (2007), the first installment of the saga, his role is similar to that of the anime series. He is assigned to pilot Unit-01 and works with Rei to defeat the Angel Ramiel. In the second installment, &quot;&quot; (2009), Shinji reluctantly continues his duties as the pilot of Unit-01. After the battle with the Angel Bardiel, when his father forces his Unit-01 to injure Asuka critically, Shinji retires from his duties and leaves Nerv. When the Angel Zeruel consumes Rei, Shinji returns and defeats the Angel; however, his decisions trigger the Third Impact. Shinji seemingly saves Rei by fusing with the Evangelion.

In the third film, &quot;&quot; (2012), set fourteen years later, Shinji awakens to a world completely changed by the Third Impact, and Misato and the others treat him with hostility. They place an explosive device named DSS Choker on his neck, which they will activate if he comes close to starting another Impact. After learning from Misato that they are part of Wille, a new organization fighting Nerv, Shinji leaves when Rei appears. At the remnants of Nerv, he is approached by Kaworu Nagisa, the pilot of Eva-13, who befriends him. He becomes despondent after Kaworu tells him that humanity holds him responsible for initiating the Third Impact. After Shinji realizes that he failed to save Rei and that the new Rei is a clone, Nagisa convinces him to pilot Eva-13 with him. While confronting Asuka and Mari, Shinji begins a Fourth Impact; Eva-13 eats the twelfth Angel and ascends to divinity. Kaworu is killed by the DSS Choker he took from Shinji to stop the Fourth Impact. Devastated by these events, Shinji loses his will to live. Asuka rescues him from his Entry Plug, berating him for acting &quot;like a baby&quot;. The Rei clone appears and follows them as they head to the ruins of Tokyo-3 to be rescued by Wille.

In &quot;&quot; (2021), the last installment of the saga, Shinji, still distraught over Kaworu&#x27;s death, wanders without a will to live with Asuka and Rei. With the two companions, he reaches a protected citadel called Village-3, which is inhabited by survivors of the various Impacts and is isolated from the outside world. Shinji meets his old classmates, Toji, Kensuke, and Hikari Horaki, and, with help from Asuka and Rei, gradually regains the will to live. He then decides to leave with Asuka and the other members of Wille for Antarctica, where he boards Eva-01 to face his father, Gendo, and his Eva-13. As he cannot defeat him with brute force, he decides to talk to him instead. Gendo apologizes to Shinji and embraces him, and Shinji finds himself in a reborn world. On a beach, he meets Mari Illustrious Makinami, saying goodbye to all the Evangelions. Shortly after, a visibly grown Shinji can be seen in a station; Mari comes to meet him, and the two of them walk together into a new world, holding hands.

=== Manga ===
In Yoshiyuki Sadamoto&#x27;s &quot;Neon Genesis Evangelion&quot; manga adaptation, Shinji&#x27;s characterization differs. Sadamoto tried to portray him as more of a misfit, a young teenager who is more stubborn, rebellious, juvenile, and apathetic than Hideaki Anno&#x27;s insecure character. In the anime&#x27;s fourth episode, &quot;Hedgehog&#x27;s Dilemma&quot;, Shinji runs away from home because he is overwhelmed by responsibility; in the manga, he runs away because he realizes that Misato is spying on him and documenting his every move. After the battle against Bardiel, in which his friend Toji dies following an order from Commander Ikari, Shinji tries to punch his father. He has a close relationship with Rei in the manga, and Kaji is more of a mentor to him.

Shinji&#x27;s relationship with Kaworu is troubled in the manga; he accuses Kaworu of being cynical and strange. His backstory is also modified, with an unnamed aunt, uncle, and cousins, and memories of his childhood away from Gendo are shown. A different Instrumentality is also depicted, with Shinji saving Asuka during her fight against the Mass Production Evangelions. In the end, he is seen leading a normal life in a reformed world and sees Asuka while waiting for a train, although they only have a faint recollection of one another.

Sadamoto decided to work on an &quot;Evangelion&quot; manga when he saw Shinji in the first episodes of the original series. He wondered &quot;what the world looked like through Shinji&#x27;s eyes&quot;. In the anime, Shinji&#x27;s motto is &quot;I must not run away&quot;, but Sadamoto chose &quot;being honest with themselves&quot; as the main theme for the manga. This led Sadamoto to change Shinji&#x27;s characterization and psychology. He wanted to reflect contemporary teenagers in the character and was influenced by the Gulf War, wondering how a 14-year-old would have behaved on a helicopter. Sadamoto also drew upon his experiences as an adolescent, saying that his characterization was &quot;more like a flunk-out&quot; than Anno&#x27;s version. He conceived Shinji with a &quot;clean image that a woman tends to project&quot; in his mind, portraying him as a &quot;cold, unambitious&quot; character, &quot;the type who would commit suicide but can&#x27;t bring himself to do it&quot; and trying to design a character from the more stoic part of himself. He stated, &quot;It was my intention to create a wistful character who had given up on life&quot;. According to Anno&#x27;s thought process, a twisted person puts on a &quot;cool face&quot; to hide their insanity. Sadamoto perceived his approach as the opposite; Sadamoto described his characters as stoic and earnest but with a twisted outside, &quot;just like a child&quot;. He also described his Shinji as a character who refuses to listen but &quot;still makes the right decision&quot;.

=== In other media ===
In a scene from the last episode of the series, an alternate universe is presented, which has a different story from the previous episodes; in this parallel reality, Shinji lives with both his parents and is a normal middle-school student. He is also a protagonist in &quot;Shinji Ikari Raising Project&quot; and &quot;Neon Genesis Evangelion: Angelic Days&quot;, where he is portrayed as happier and more stable than his anime counterpart. This characterization is also found in &quot;Neon Genesis Evangelion: Girlfriend of Steel 2nd&quot;.

Some spin-offs and video games have the option of pairing Shinji romantically with Asuka Langley Soryu, Rei Ayanami, Kaworu, and other characters, including his classmate Hikari Horaki and original characters such as Mana Kirishima, an extrovert transfer student first introduced in the video game &quot;Neon Genesis Evangelion: Girlfriend of Steel&quot;, and Mayumi Yamagishi, an introverted girl in the video game &quot;Neon Genesis Evangelion: 2nd Impression&quot;. In &quot;Neon Genesis Evangelion: Shinji Ikari Raising Project&quot;, he is presented as a childhood friend of Asuka and a distant cousin of Rei Ayanami. In &quot;Petit Eva: Evangelion@School&quot;, Shinji is portrayed as a boy &quot;frightened by the idea of growing up&quot; but popular among the students of Tokyo-3&#x27;s Municipal Nerv High School. In &quot;Evangelion: Detective Shinji Ikari&quot;, Kaji and Kaworu are portrayed as private investigators whom Shinji asks for help and investigates a mysterious case.

In &quot;Neon Genesis Evangelion: Anima,&quot; set three years after &quot;The End of Evangelion&quot; with a different Instrumentality scenario, Shinji is 17 years old; he lets his hair grow and is a good friend of Rei and Asuka. He first pilots the Evangelion Unit-01 Type-F and, after the attack of Eva0.0 (Quatre) and the unification of his soul with Eva-01, pilots the mecha Super Evangelion and its upgrades. In addition to video games based on the original animated series, Shinji appears in media outside the &quot;Evangelion&quot; franchise, such as &quot;Monster Strike&quot;, &quot;Tales of Zestiria&quot;, &quot;Puzzle &amp; Dragons&quot;, &quot;The Battle Cats&quot;, and a crossover episode of &quot;Shinkansen Henkei Robo Shinkalion&quot;, in which he is voiced by Ogata and pilots a 500 Type Eva transformable train. For &quot;Shinkalion&quot;, Ogata voiced him as a more &quot;level-headed&quot; character. He is a playable character in the &quot;Super Robot Wars&quot; crossover video-game franchise, where he and other &quot;Evangelion&quot; characters work with characters from other mecha series. Shinji has crushes on different characters, such as Lynn Minmay, sparking jealousy in Asuka, who tries to recapture his attention. In other games, Eva Unit-01 goes berserk after fighting the fourth Angel, and he fights Koji Kabuto and Mazinger Z. He later rejoins the battle against the Angels with Rei Ayanami.

== Characterization and themes ==
Shinji is a dependent and introverted boy with few friends, reluctant and unable to communicate with others. He tends to be apologetic and passive in his relationships and is frightened by contact with strangers. He also avoids choosing his clothes and instead wears clothes provided by others. Unlike a stereotypical hero, particularly of the mecha genre, Shinji is more apathetic and reluctant than courageous. According to his voice actress, Megumi Ogata, &quot;he didn&#x27;t act like an anime character, but typically talked very quietly and sparingly, and it was like he was suddenly thrust into an anime world&quot;. Character designer Sadamoto conceived him as &quot;the kind of character who would encase himself in a shell of his own making&quot;. Director Hideaki Anno described him as a &quot;cowardly young man&quot; who has convinced himself that &quot;he is a completely unnecessary person&quot; after his father, Gendo, abandoned him.

According to writer Gerald Alva Miller, Shinji craves acceptance and is concerned about how others perceive him, but &quot;he also remains incapable of accepting love from others&quot;. His childhood trauma leads him to doubt the value of his existence, to be disheartened, and to seek a &quot;raison d&#x27;être&quot;; he also insistently wonders about why he pilots Eva-01 in the latter part of the series. In a stream of consciousness from the last two episodes, which focus on his path and psyche, he admits being afraid of himself and his father. Despite the tension between him and his father, however, Shinji yearns to trust him. He also pilots Eva-01 for the approval of others, particularly Gendo, rather than out of heroism or idealism. Despite this, assistant director Kazuya Tsurumaki noted that Shinji acts in opposition to the conventional impression of him: &quot;He is not cowardly and indecisive; he is obstinate and doesn&#x27;t pay any mind to other people.&quot; Anno described him as &quot;both an introvert and righteous&quot; boy who tends to categorize things, a character who tends to hide something &quot;like a way to escape from that closure&quot;. Furthermore, according to Sadamoto, he is not as dark as perceived by fans; except for &quot;The End of Evangelion&quot;, in which he is portrayed as &quot;pretty dark and introspective&quot;, he never got the impression of a dark character in the original series. According to Ogata, at the film&#x27;s end, Shinji grows up, naturally closing his path from childhood to adulthood.

Writer Paul M. Malone compared him to the German jurist and writer Daniel Paul Schreber, noting &quot;a surprising degree of intertextuality&quot; with his &quot;Memoirs of My Nervous Illness&quot;. However, he did not consider &quot;Evangelion&quot; to be based directly on his &quot;Memoirs&quot;. Malone, following Japanese critic and writer Kotani Mari, described Shinji as an effeminate and androgynous character. According to Mari, Shinji becomes effeminate throughout the story, and she characterized him as a &quot;female savior&quot;. Other critics described him as a messianic figure and likened him to Jesus Christ, who in Japanese is known by the epithet of , &quot;God-man&quot;. He has also been likened to Oedipus. Writer and animation critic Patrick Drazen similarly compared the dilemma faced by Shinji in the twenty-fourth episode against the Angel Tabris to Hamlet, the protagonist of Shakespeare&#x27;s tragedy of the same name.

For the Japanese sociologist Tsutomu Hashimoto, Shinji could be seen as an heir of the Japanese society of the seventies and eighties, engaged in the search for freedom from social constraints and the figures of authoritarian family fathers; the sociologist cited the musician Yutaka Ozaki as a symbol of this search for freedom since he tried to escape from the impositions of the school system and he eventually &quot;returned&quot; to the mother figure. Hashimoto compared Shinji&#x27;s final choice, in which he rejects the Instrumentality Project desired by the authoritarian father Gendo, to the concept of liberalism, which prescribes respect for any individual identity. Other critics associated the character with the youth and climate of 1990s Japan, shaken by the Tokyo subway sarin attack operated by the Japanese sect Aum Shinrikyō, the Great Hanshin earthquake, and the bursting of the Japanese asset price bubble.

After he arrives in Tokyo-3, Shinji repeats, &quot;I mustn&#x27;t run away&quot; to face his responsibilities, and the sentence becomes a typical mantra of the character. In the twentieth episode, he remembers escaping from the experimental site where his mother died. This event generated in him the idea of &quot;not running away&quot;, which an official pamphlet describes as &quot;compulsive&quot;. In an interview, Anno said that contrary to the interpretation by fans, the theme of the series is not about &quot;not having to run away&quot;, but &quot;It&#x27;s ok to run away&quot;; according to him, &quot;it&#x27;s perfectly fine&quot; to run away sometimes and that &quot;There are things that you gain and things that you lose running away, after all. Although, if you don&#x27;t pick something, then there are times when you get neither. That&#x27;s the same as with dying&quot;. Hiroki Azuma, a Japanese philosopher and cultural critic, speaking of his motto, &quot;I mustn&#x27;t run away&quot;, described &quot;Evangelion&quot; as a story that depicts &quot;anxiety without a cause&quot;, linking this feeling to the repercussions after the Aum Shinrikyō attack. Azuma also described Shinji and other characters in the series as &quot;stereotypical characters&quot; through which Anno succeeded in portraying the nineties. Psychiatrist Kōji Mizobe indicated him as a dependent boy unable to communicate but also argued that the fundamental characteristic of Shinji is sociability, describing him as a &quot;sympathetic person&quot; who accepts and imitates others. Mizobe interpreted a scene from the ninth episode, in which he synchronizes with Asuka&#x27;s movements during a train, as proof of this ability. He also interpreted &quot;Evangelion&quot; as a story in which the main characters try to build their stable identity, saying that Shinji and Asuka&#x27;s communication problems are why, even years after the first airing, younger Japanese viewers identify themselves with the characters.

Critics interpreted Shinji as an alter ego of the series director, Hideaki Anno, and as an &quot;otaku&quot;. &quot;IGN&quot;&#x27;s Ramsey Isler interpreted his feelings as a reflection of Anno&#x27;s mood; according to him, Anno &quot;went through a serious bout of depression while making the show and, like a true artist, he poured all of that emotion and despair into his work&quot;. Isler also interpreted his characterization and battles against the Angels as a metaphor for Anno&#x27;s attempts &quot;to defeat his own personal demons&quot;. Assistant director Tsurumaki gave a similar interpretation, working on the series with the idea that Shinji&#x27;s emotions are a reflection of Anno&#x27;s feelings: &quot;That&#x27;s why in the scenario planning sessions, I was always saying something like, &#x27;Isn&#x27;t that a little too hero-like for Shinji to say? Hideaki Anno isn&#x27;t that much of a hero&#x27;&quot;. Tsurumaki also thought that Shinji could only be understood by &quot;Japanese fans of this generation&quot;.

Critics analyzed the conflictual relationship between him and his father, comparing him with the protagonists of the works by director Yoshiyuki Tomino, especially Amuro Ray, the main character in &quot;Mobile Suit Gundam&quot;. Artist Takashi Murakami interpreted Shinji&#x27;s interior drama as &quot;the endpoint of the postwar lineage of &quot;otaku&quot; favorites&quot;, such as &quot;Godzilla&quot;, the series of the &quot;Ultra&quot; franchise, &quot;Space Battleship Yamato&quot; or &quot;Gundam&quot;, in which hero-figures increasingly question and agonize over their missions to defend Earth and humanity. According to Toshio Okada, former president of Gainax and an acquaintance of Hideaki Anno, &quot;Evangelion&quot; and &quot;Gundam&quot; are completely different; for Okada, one thrust of the story of &quot;Gundam&quot; is &quot;the main character&#x27;s desire to be recognized by others&quot; since in mecha anime, the characters generally try to change the world. At the same time, &quot;Evangelion&quot; &quot;complicated the whole thing, raising issues&quot; since no one can save the world. According to Italian researcher Fabio Bartoli, Shinji is a &quot;perfect representative&quot; of the &quot;otaku&quot; generation. He described him as &quot;a young man with relationship difficulties, accustomed to spending a lot of time at home&quot;. Bartoli wrote that the last scene of the anime, in which the boy&#x27;s glass prison shatters, ending his psychoanalytic session, may allude to the , the Japanese generation born in the 1970s, which is also known as . Writer Andrea Fontana agreed, seeing him as a representation of &quot;otaku&quot; and their inability to relate to others. Fontana also saw in Shinji&#x27;s character &quot;an exhortation&quot; by Anno to &quot;otaku&quot;, Japanese society, and young people &quot;to break the crystal cage in which they locked themselves up, looking confidently at their neighbor&quot;.

=== Psychoanalysis ===
Shinji&#x27;s personality traits have been linked to psychiatric conditions, such as depressive disorder, anxiety, social phobia, and borderline personality disorder. Walter Veit of &quot;Psychology Today&quot; linked his passive attitude in the first episodes to Jean-Paul Sartre&#x27;s existentialist concept of bad faith and Albert Camus&#x27;s &quot;philosophical suicide&quot;. Gualtiero Cannarsi, editor of the Italian adaptation of the series, noticed that Shinji struggles to make friends and has a cold, reserved attitude in the third episode, &quot;A Transfer&quot;. Like the porcupines of Arthur Schopenhauer&#x27;s &quot;Parerga and Paralipomena&quot;, Shinji is afraid to be hurt and withdraws from human contact; he suffers, in fact, from the porcupine&#x27;s dilemma. Shinji&#x27;s relationship with Misato Katsuragi follows Schopenhauer&#x27;s concept; Cannarsi also noticed that in the fourth episode, &quot;Hedgehog&#x27;s Dilemma&quot;, the characters get closer without hurting each other. Schopenhauer originally named his concept after the porcupine, or Hystricidae (&quot;Stachelschweine&quot; in German). Still, staff chose an alternative translation for the installment&#x27;s title since they wanted to portray Shinji as a hedgehog, an animal with smaller, blunter spines than a porcupine, suggesting more delicacy for the character.

Critics noticed that, since he lost his mother traumatically, Shinji seeks a substitute in the women around him and in Eva-01, which contains her soul. Academic Susan J. Napier also interpreted the Angels as &quot;father figures, whom Shinji must annihilate&quot;. Anime News Network reviewer Mike Crandol noticed that Shinji depends on Unit-01 in the first part of the series, becoming negatively affected by the symbiotic relationship. Crandol described his entry into Eva-01 as a Freudian &quot;return to the womb&quot; and his struggle to be free of the Eva as his &quot;rite of passage&quot; into manhood. Anno also described Shinji as a boy with a strong Oedipus complex for his father, Gendo. The Oedipal triangle is completed by their common interest in Rei Ayanami, a genetic clone of Yui Ikari. According to him, Shinji symbolically &quot;kills&quot; his father &quot;and steals his mother from him&quot;.

Yūichirō Oguro, the editor of supplemental materials included in the Japanese edition of the series, interpreted &quot;Neon Genesis Evangelion&quot;&#x27;s plot as an Oedipal story. Eva-01 can be seen as a motherly breast and a source of ambivalence for the character. To manage this ambivalence, Shinji &quot;split the breast&quot; into a good and a bad breast. Oguro described berserk Unit-01 as a &quot;bad breast&quot;; conversely, he interpreted Yui as a &quot;good breast&quot; that eventually saves Shinji during the battles with the Angels, like in the fights against Leliel in the sixteenth episode, named &quot;Splitting of the Breast&quot; in reference to psychoanalytic theory.

In the twentieth episode, &quot;Weaving a Story 2: oral stage&quot;, Shinji is trapped in Eva-01, dissolving into its cockpit; in a stream of consciousness, he has visions linked with the Freudian oral stage, which include breastfeeding by Yui. With his mother&#x27;s help, Shinji is symbolically reborn, finding the will to live and regaining his body. He also displays features linked with oralism, a personality of dependent, weak individuals who see other people as tools to satisfy them. According to Freudian theory, oral personalities were not adequately fed during weaning. For Oguro, Shinji resolves his oral fixation with the vision of his mother&#x27;s breast, becoming a more self-conscious individual. In the last two episodes, he also sees the good and bad sides of other people; Anno himself compared him to a child and his ambivalent relationship with the mother during the oral stage. Shinji&#x27;s Oedipus complex then resolves in the final episode, which ends with the captions &quot;To my father, thank you&quot; and &quot;To my mother, goodbye&quot;, indicating his entry into adulthood. In &quot;The End of Evangelion&quot;, he also chooses to live with other human beings, rejecting Human Instrumentality and accepting others.

== Cultural impact ==
=== Popularity ===
Shinji&#x27;s character has been popular in Japan. The character&#x27;s appreciation was also reflected in popularity polls, even years after the anime&#x27;s first airing. After the series&#x27; first run, Shinji ranked second among the &quot;most popular male characters of the moment&quot; in an &quot;Animage&quot; magazine Grand Prix poll. In the following two years&#x27; rankings, he rose to first place. In the 1997 Anime Grand Prix, Shinji received around 1,200 votes, more than double those of the second character. Megumi Ogata finished second in the voice-actor rankings for three years. Shinji also appeared in the magazine&#x27;s monthly surveys, remaining in the top 20 in 1996, 1997, and 1998. In 1998, &quot;Animage&quot; ranked him 21st among the 100 most popular anime characters and 55th in 1999.

In 1998, Shinji emerged in first place among the best &quot;dark characters&quot; in a survey by &quot;Animedia&quot; magazine, and the magazine itself praised its complexity. For several years, he also appeared in the periodical&#x27;s annual popularity rankings, usually among the top ten. He placed 77th in a 2002 TV Asahi poll ranking the most popular anime characters of all time and 25th in a 2007 list of most popular male heroes. Shinji also topped &quot;Newtype&quot; magazine&#x27;s popularity charts, finishing third and first in August and September 2009. He finished third in October, becoming the most popular &quot;Evangelion&quot; male character on the list. In March 2010, a new &quot;Newtype&quot; survey decreed him the most popular male character of the nineties.

In 2014, foreigners living in Japan were asked: &quot;Which character do you aspire to look like?&quot;. Amid a wide variety of answers, Shinji finished seventh. In 2012, Fuji TV asked about 14,000 fans to name the &quot;best anime hero&quot;, and Shinji finished twentieth. In 2016, he finished thirteenth in an Anime News Network poll of the &quot;strongest pilots&quot; in Japanese animation. In April 2021, after the release of the final &quot;Rebuild&quot; film, he finished as the second most popular male character in a &quot;Newtype&quot; poll, taking fifth place in May and first place in June.

=== Critical reaction ===
The character evoked mixed opinions, dividing anime critics. Some criticized Shinji&#x27;s insecurities, vulnerability, and lack of temper and resoluteness. Pete Harcoff, a reviewer for the Anime Critic website, praised &quot;Neon Genesis Evangelion&quot; but criticized Shinji as ineffective and disappointing. THEM Anime Reviews noticed the character&#x27;s constant angst in the television series as a negative trait. Raphael See found &quot;Evangelion&quot; &quot;a little cliche, or just plain irritating at times&quot; and criticized Shinji&#x27;s pessimism. &quot;Japanator&quot; listed him among &quot;characters with no chance in reality&quot;, saying that &quot;he really sucks as an Eva pilot, and he has the spine of a jellyfish&quot;. Comic Book Resources also criticized Shinji as a stereotypical talented male protagonist with a harem.

Other critics praised the character&#x27;s realism. For Anime News Network&#x27;s Nick Creamer, &quot;every element of Shinji&#x27;s emotional journey is conveyed with clear sympathy and brutal specificity&quot;. According to Susan J. Napier, Shinji &quot;still wins the championship for most psychologically complex (or just plain neurotic) male character ever created&quot;. Critics also described him as one of the most relatable male anime characters. &quot;IGN&quot; editor Chris Mackenzie ranked him the twenty-fifth best anime character ever. Similarly, &quot;Anime Invasion&quot; magazine&#x27;s Jen Contino praised Shinji&#x27;s characterization and rated him the ninth-best anime character ever.

In 2013, Anime News Network editor Lynzee Lam ranked him first among seven &quot;crybaby heroes&quot; in Japanese animation but praised his motivation and psychological realism. &quot;IGN&quot;″s Ramsey Isler called him the &quot;greatest anime character&quot; of all time, praising his originality and realistic characterization. Isler concluded, &quot;He&#x27;s a character that challenges the audience by not giving them a superficial, vicarious power fantasy like you&#x27;d get from so many other anime. He is pathetic, but that is what makes him great. That is what makes him a genuine work of art&quot;.

Shinji&#x27;s role in the &quot;Rebuild of Evangelion&quot; films was better received, with reviewers praising its more open character. Martin Theron of Anime News Network, reviewing &quot;Evangelion 1.0: You Are (Not) Alone&quot;, praised Shinji&#x27;s realism. Theron called the scene in &quot;&quot; where Shinji saves Rei the &quot;Best Scene&quot; in the website&#x27;s &quot;Best (and Most Notable) of 2011&quot;: &quot;This is the first time in the entire franchise that he whole-heartedly goes after something because he &quot;wants&quot; it, rather than because he&#x27;s expected to or has no choice.&quot; Despite criticizing the , several reviewers praised Shinji&#x27;s interactions with Kaworu. Nicole MacLean of THEM Anime Reviews criticized their relationship, finding it &quot;rushed&quot;, artificial, and unclear. Comic Book Resources writer Daniel Kurland also praised his role in the final installment, &quot;Evangelion: 3.0+1.0 Thrice Upon a Time&quot;, writing: &quot;Shinji deserves happiness, and it makes &quot;Thrice Upon A Time&quot; the more powerful conclusion that it finally allows Shinji to reach this point and not leave him in existential dread&quot;.

=== Legacy ===
Shinji-themed merchandise has been released, including clothing, action figures, collectible models, perfumes, and drinks. The character has been used for Japan Racing Association advertising campaigns and for a culinary company specializing in &quot;miso&quot; soups; the &quot;Shijimi from Lake Shinji&quot; campaign also proved successful. Movic has also released a cassette drama featuring him as part of its &quot;Animate&quot; series featuring other popular works.

With Shinji Ikari, according to Comic Book Resources, &quot;Neon Genesis Evangelion&quot; had a significant influence on Japanese animation, showing a more realistic, insecure, and fragile protagonist than other past mecha series. &quot;Guilty Crown&quot; staff member Ryo Ōyama compared Shū Ōma, the series&#x27; main character, to Shinji because: &quot;They&#x27;re both in their own world, and they don&#x27;t come out from that world&quot;. According to Ōyama, Shū is &quot;a 2011 version of Shinji&quot;, but Shinji has a &quot;more passive&quot;, pessimistic attitude. Similarly, Asa Butterfield compared Shinji to Ender Wiggin in &quot;Ender&#x27;s Game&quot;, whom he played. According to Butterfield, both characters &quot;withdraw from the world&quot;, face new experiences, and fight against unknown enemies. His Japanese voice actress Ogata likened Makoto Naegi from the &quot;Danganronpa&quot; franchise, which she played, to Shinji because they are both ordinary boys &quot;put in terrible situations&quot;.

Lain Iwakura from &quot;Serial Experiments Lain&quot;, Simon from &quot;Gurren Lagann&quot;, Daisuke Dojima from &quot;Revisions&quot;, Kōji Aiba from &quot;Infinite Ryvius&quot;, Cloud Strife from &quot;Final Fantasy VII,&quot; and the main character of &quot;Cyborg She&quot; were also compared with him by anime critics. In the fourth episode of the dorama &quot;Nigeru wa Haji da ga Yaku ni Tatsu&quot;, a character named Shinji after him appears. Shinji is also referenced by Steven Universe in the show of the same name, which parodies the series&#x27; final scene. The British group Fightstar included a track named &quot;Shinji Ikari&quot; on the deluxe-edition bonus disc of their album, &quot;One Day Son, This Will All Be Yours&quot;. Open Mike Eagle called a song from his album &quot;Anime, Trauma and Divorce&quot;, &quot;Headass (Idiot Shinji)&quot;. &quot;&quot; director Jordan Vogt-Roberts also named the character Gunpei Ikari after him.

<doc id="366540" wikidata="Q1171061" url="?curid=366540" title="James Tallmadge Jr.">
<text>James Tallmadge Jr. (January 28, 1778 – September 29, 1853) was a United States lawyer, and politician who served as a United States Representative from New York&#x27;s 4th congressional district.

==Early life==
James Tallmadge Jr. was born on January 28, 1778, in Stanford, Dutchess County, New York. His father, Colonel James Tallmadge (1744–1821), led a company of volunteers at the capture of General John Burgoyne. He graduated from Brown University, Providence, Rhode Island in 1798.

==Career==
From 1798 to 1800, following his graduation from Brown, Tallmadge was secretary to New York Governor George Clinton. He studied law and was admitted to the bar in 1802, after which he practiced in Poughkeepsie and in New York City. He was Surrogate of Dutchess County from 1804 to 1810.

He served in the War of 1812 and commanded a company of home guards in defense of New York.

===U.S. House of Representatives===

Representative-elect Henry B. Lee died on September 16, 1816. In the special election to replace him, Tallmadge was elected as a Democratic-Republican to the Fifteenth Congress. He served from June 6, 1817, to March 3, 1819. In the House, he defended General Andrew Jackson&#x27;s course in the Seminole War.

His most famous action in Congress was the Tallmadge Amendment to the bill for Missouri statehood. It would have restricted slavery in Missouri and provided for its future termination. It read as follows:

And provided, That the further introduction of slavery or involuntary servitude be prohibited, except for the punishment of crimes, whereof the party shall have been fully convicted; and that all children born within the said State, after the admission thereof into the Union, shall be free at the age of twenty-five years.

In support of this amendment, on February 16, 1819, he delivered a powerful speech in opposition to the extension of slavery. This speech was widely circulated, and was translated into German. The House adopted the Tallmadge Amendment, but the Senate rejected it.

===Later career===
Tallmadge declined to run for a second term in the House. He continued the practice of law in New York City, and took a prominent role in civic affairs. He was a delegate to the Constitutional Convention of 1821, a member of the New York State Assembly in 1824, and Lieutenant Governor of New York from 1825 to 1826.

In 1836, he visited Russia, and helped introduce into that country several American mechanical inventions, especially cotton-spinning machinery. He was a delegate to the New York Constitutional Convention of 1846.

==Personal life==
Tallmadge married Laura Tallmadge (1788–1824), his paternal second cousin. She was the daughter of John Tallmadge (1757–1823) and Phebe Pomeroy (1766–1842). Together, they had six children, only one who survived to adulthood.
*John James Tallmadge (1811–1819)
*Mary Rebecca Tallmadge (1817–1872), who was regarded as one of the most beautiful women in the country, and accompanied her father to Russia. She married Philip Stephen Van Rensselaer (1806–1871), third son of Stephen Van Rensselaer III, patroon of the Rensselaerswyck.

Tallmadge died on September 29, 1853, in New York City. He is buried at the New York Marble Cemetery.

His first cousin was United States Senator and Wisconsin Territorial Governor Nathaniel P. Tallmadge. His first cousin, once removed was Benjamin Tallmadge, United States Congressman from Connecticut and spy for George Washington during the American Revolutionary War. His sister, Rebecca, married Theodorus Bailey, a United States Congressman and United States Senator from New York.

==Legacy==
He assisted in the founding of New York University in 1831. The university conferred an honorary LL.D. on him in 1838. He was also one of the founders of the American Institute, a New York society for the promotion of inventions and technical education, and was its president from 1831 to 1850.

His only surviving grandchild, James Tallmadge Van Rensselaer, was a well-known lawyer in New York City.

<text>In mathematics, a frame bundle is a principal fiber bundle formula_1 associated with any vector bundle &quot;formula_2&quot;. The fiber of formula_1 over a point &quot;formula_4&quot; is the set of all ordered bases, or &quot;frames&quot;, for &quot;formula_5&quot;. The general linear group acts naturally on formula_1 via a change of basis, giving the frame bundle the structure of a principal &quot;formula_7&quot;-bundle (where &quot;k&quot; is the rank of &quot;formula_2&quot;).

The frame bundle of a smooth manifold is the one associated with its tangent bundle. For this reason it is sometimes called the tangent frame bundle.

==Definition and construction==
Let &quot;formula_9&quot; be a real vector bundle of rank &quot;formula_10&quot; over a topological space &quot;formula_11&quot;. A frame at a point &quot;formula_12&quot; is an ordered basis for the vector space &quot;formula_5&quot;. Equivalently, a frame can be viewed as a linear isomorphism
:formula_14
The set of all frames at &quot;formula_4&quot;, denoted &quot;formula_16&quot;, has a natural right action by the general linear group &quot;formula_7&quot; of invertible &quot;formula_18&quot; matrices: a group element &quot;formula_19&quot; acts on the frame &quot;formula_20&quot; via composition to give a new frame
:formula_21
This action of &quot;formula_7&quot; on &quot;formula_16&quot; is both free and transitive (this follows from the standard linear algebra result that there is a unique invertible linear transformation sending one basis onto another). As a topological space, &quot;formula_16&quot; is homeomorphic to &quot;formula_7&quot; although it lacks a group structure, since there is no &quot;preferred frame&quot;. The space &quot;formula_16&quot; is said to be a &quot;formula_7&quot;-torsor.

The frame bundle of &quot;formula_2&quot;, denoted by formula_1 or formula_30, is the disjoint union of all the &quot;formula_16&quot;:
:formula_32
Each point in formula_1 is a pair (&quot;x&quot;, &quot;p&quot;) where &quot;formula_4&quot; is a point in &quot;formula_11&quot; and &quot;formula_20&quot; is a frame at &quot;formula_4&quot;. There is a natural projection formula_38 which sends formula_39 to &quot;formula_4&quot;. The group &quot;formula_7&quot; acts on formula_1 on the right as above. This action is clearly free and the orbits are just the fibers of formula_43.

=== Principal bundle structure ===
The frame bundle formula_1 can be given a natural topology and bundle structure determined by that of &quot;formula_2&quot;. Let formula_46 be a local trivialization of &quot;formula_2&quot;. Then for each &quot;x&quot; ∈ &quot;U&quot;&quot;i&quot; one has a linear isomorphism formula_48. This data determines a bijection
:formula_49
given by
:formula_50
With these bijections, each formula_51 can be given the topology of &quot;formula_52&quot;. The topology on formula_1 is the final topology coinduced by the inclusion maps formula_54.

With all of the above data the frame bundle formula_1 becomes a principal fiber bundle over &quot;formula_11&quot; with structure group &quot;formula_7&quot; and local trivializations formula_58. One can check that the transition functions of formula_1 are the same as those of &quot;formula_2&quot;.

The above all works in the smooth category as well: if &quot;formula_2&quot; is a smooth vector bundle over a smooth manifold &quot;formula_62&quot; then the frame bundle of &quot;formula_2&quot; can be given the structure of a smooth principal bundle over &quot;formula_62&quot;.

==Associated vector bundles==
A vector bundle &quot;formula_2&quot; and its frame bundle formula_1 are associated bundles. Each one determines the other. The frame bundle formula_1 can be constructed from &quot;formula_2&quot; as above, or more abstractly using the fiber bundle construction theorem. With the latter method, formula_1 is the fiber bundle with same base, structure group, trivializing neighborhoods, and transition functions as &quot;formula_2&quot; but with abstract fiber &quot;formula_7&quot;, where the action of structure group &quot;formula_7&quot; on the fiber &quot;formula_7&quot; is that of left multiplication.

Given any linear representation &quot;formula_74&quot; there is a vector bundle
:formula_75
associated with formula_1 which is given by product formula_77 modulo the equivalence relation formula_78 for all &quot;formula_79&quot; in &quot;formula_7&quot;. Denote the equivalence classes by formula_81.

The vector bundle &quot;formula_2&quot; is naturally isomorphic to the bundle formula_83 where formula_84 is the fundamental representation of &quot;formula_7&quot; on formula_86. The isomorphism is given by
:formula_87
where formula_88 is a vector in formula_86 and formula_90 is a frame at &quot;formula_4&quot;. One can easily check that this map is well-defined.

Any vector bundle associated with &quot;formula_2&quot; can be given by the above construction. For example, the dual bundle of &quot;formula_2&quot; is given by formula_94 where formula_95 is the dual of the fundamental representation. Tensor bundles of &quot;formula_2&quot; can be constructed in a similar manner.

==Tangent frame bundle==
The tangent frame bundle (or simply the frame bundle) of a smooth manifold &quot;formula_62&quot; is the frame bundle associated with the tangent bundle of &quot;formula_62&quot;. The frame bundle of &quot;formula_62&quot; is often denoted &quot;formula_100&quot; or &quot;formula_101&quot; rather than &quot;formula_102&quot;. In physics, it is sometimes denoted &quot;formula_103&quot;. If &quot;formula_62&quot; is &quot;formula_105&quot;-dimensional then the tangent bundle has rank &quot;formula_105&quot;, so the frame bundle of &quot;formula_62&quot; is a principal &quot;formula_108&quot; bundle over &quot;formula_62&quot;.

===Smooth frames===
Local sections of the frame bundle of &quot;formula_62&quot; are called smooth frames on &quot;formula_62&quot;. The cross-section theorem for principal bundles states that the frame bundle is trivial over any open set in &quot;formula_112&quot; in &quot;formula_62&quot; which admits a smooth frame. Given a smooth frame &quot;formula_114&quot;, the trivialization &quot;formula_115&quot; is given by
:formula_116
where &quot;formula_20&quot; is a frame at &quot;formula_4&quot;. It follows that a manifold is parallelizable if and only if the frame bundle of &quot;formula_62&quot; admits a global section.

Since the tangent bundle of &quot;formula_62&quot; is trivializable over coordinate neighborhoods of &quot;formula_62&quot; so is the frame bundle. In fact, given any coordinate neighborhood &quot;formula_112&quot; with coordinates &quot;formula_123&quot; the coordinate vector fields
:formula_124
define a smooth frame on &quot;formula_112&quot;. One of the advantages of working with frame bundles is that they allow one to work with frames other than coordinates frames; one can choose a frame adapted to the problem at hand. This is sometimes called the method of moving frames.

===Solder form===
The frame bundle of a manifold &quot;formula_62&quot; is a special type of principal bundle in the sense that its geometry is fundamentally tied to the geometry of &quot;formula_62&quot;. This relationship can be expressed by means of a vector-valued 1-form on &quot;formula_100&quot; called the solder form (also known as the fundamental or tautological 1-form). Let &quot;formula_4&quot; be a point of the manifold &quot;formula_62&quot; and &quot;formula_20&quot; a frame at &quot;formula_4&quot;, so that
:formula_133
is a linear isomorphism of formula_134 with the tangent space of &quot;formula_62&quot; at &quot;formula_4&quot;. The solder form of &quot;formula_100&quot; is the formula_134-valued 1-form &quot;formula_139&quot; defined by
:formula_140
where ξ is a tangent vector to &quot;formula_100&quot; at the point &quot;formula_39&quot;, and &quot;formula_143&quot; is the inverse of the frame map, and &quot;formula_144&quot; is the differential of the projection map &quot;formula_145&quot;. The solder form is horizontal in the sense that it vanishes on vectors tangent to the fibers of &quot;formula_43&quot; and right equivariant in the sense that
:formula_147
where &quot;formula_148&quot; is right translation by &quot;formula_149&quot;. A form with these properties is called a basic or tensorial form on &quot;formula_100&quot;. Such forms are in 1-1 correspondence with &quot;formula_151&quot;-valued 1-forms on &quot;formula_62&quot; which are, in turn, in 1-1 correspondence with smooth bundle maps &quot;formula_153&quot; over &quot;formula_62&quot;. Viewed in this light &quot;formula_139&quot; is just the identity map on &quot;formula_151&quot;.

As a naming convention, the term &quot;tautological one-form&quot; is usually reserved for the case where the form has a canonical definition, as it does here, while &quot;solder form&quot; is more appropriate for those cases where the form is not canonically defined. This convention is not being observed here.

==Orthonormal frame bundle==
If a vector bundle &quot;formula_2&quot; is equipped with a Riemannian bundle metric then each fiber &quot;formula_5&quot; is not only a vector space but an inner product space. It is then possible to talk about the set of all orthonormal frames for &quot;formula_5&quot;. An orthonormal frame for &quot;formula_5&quot; is an ordered orthonormal basis for &quot;formula_5&quot;, or, equivalently, a linear isometry
:formula_162
where &quot;formula_86&quot; is equipped with the standard Euclidean metric. The orthogonal group &quot;formula_164&quot; acts freely and transitively on the set of all orthonormal frames via right composition. In other words, the set of all orthonormal frames is a right &quot;formula_164&quot;-torsor.

The orthonormal frame bundle of &quot;formula_2&quot;, denoted &quot;formula_167&quot;, is the set of all orthonormal frames at each point &quot;formula_4&quot; in the base space &quot;formula_11&quot;. It can be constructed by a method entirely analogous to that of the ordinary frame bundle. The orthonormal frame bundle of a rank &quot;formula_10&quot; Riemannian vector bundle &quot;formula_9&quot; is a principal &quot;formula_164&quot;-bundle over &quot;formula_11&quot;. Again, the construction works just as well in the smooth category.

If the vector bundle &quot;formula_2&quot; is orientable then one can define the oriented orthonormal frame bundle of &quot;formula_2&quot;, denoted &quot;formula_176&quot;, as the principal &quot;formula_177&quot;-bundle of all positively oriented orthonormal frames.

If &quot;formula_62&quot; is an &quot;formula_105&quot;-dimensional Riemannian manifold, then the orthonormal frame bundle of &quot;formula_62&quot;, denoted &quot;formula_181&quot; or &quot;formula_182&quot;, is the orthonormal frame bundle associated with the tangent bundle of &quot;formula_62&quot; (which is equipped with a Riemannian metric by definition). If &quot;formula_62&quot; is orientable, then one also has the oriented orthonormal frame bundle &quot;formula_185&quot;.

Given a Riemannian vector bundle &quot;formula_2&quot;, the orthonormal frame bundle is a principal &quot;formula_164&quot;-subbundle of the general linear frame bundle. In other words, the inclusion map
:formula_188
is principal bundle map. One says that &quot;formula_167&quot; is a reduction of the structure group of &quot;formula_30&quot; from &quot;formula_108&quot; to &quot;formula_164&quot;.

==&quot;G&quot;-structures==
If a smooth manifold &quot;formula_62&quot; comes with additional structure it is often natural to consider a subbundle of the full frame bundle of &quot;formula_62&quot; which is adapted to the given structure. For example, if &quot;formula_62&quot; is a Riemannian manifold we saw above that it is natural to consider the orthonormal frame bundle of &quot;formula_62&quot;. The orthonormal frame bundle is just a reduction of the structure group of &quot;formula_197&quot; to the orthogonal group &quot;formula_198&quot;.

In general, if &quot;formula_62&quot; is a smooth &quot;formula_105&quot;-manifold and &quot;formula_201&quot; is a Lie subgroup of &quot;formula_108&quot; we define a &quot;G&quot;-structure on &quot;formula_62&quot; to be a reduction of the structure group of &quot;formula_197&quot; to &quot;formula_201&quot;. Explicitly, this is a principal &quot;formula_201&quot;-bundle &quot;formula_207&quot; over &quot;formula_62&quot; together with a &quot;formula_201&quot;-equivariant bundle map
:formula_210
over &quot;formula_62&quot;.

In this language, a Riemannian metric on &quot;formula_62&quot; gives rise to an &quot;formula_198&quot;-structure on &quot;formula_62&quot;. The following are some other examples.

*Every oriented manifold has an oriented frame bundle which is just a &quot;formula_215&quot;-structure on &quot;formula_62&quot;.
*A volume form on &quot;formula_62&quot; determines a &quot;formula_218&quot;-structure on &quot;formula_62&quot;.
*A &quot;formula_220&quot;-dimensional symplectic manifold has a natural &quot;formula_221&quot;-structure.
*A &quot;formula_220&quot;-dimensional complex or almost complex manifold has a natural &quot;formula_223&quot;-structure.
In many of these instances, a &quot;formula_201&quot;-structure on &quot;formula_62&quot; uniquely determines the corresponding structure on &quot;formula_62&quot;. For example, a &quot;formula_218&quot;-structure on &quot;formula_62&quot; determines a volume form on &quot;formula_62&quot;. However, in some cases, such as for symplectic and complex manifolds, an added integrability condition is needed. A &quot;formula_221&quot;-structure on &quot;formula_62&quot; uniquely determines a nondegenerate 2-form on &quot;formula_62&quot;, but for &quot;formula_62&quot; to be symplectic, this 2-form must also be closed.

<text>Francis William Mahovlich (born January 10, 1938) is a Canadian former professional ice hockey player and a former Liberal Senator in the Canadian Senate. He played on six Stanley Cup-winning teams and is an inductee of the Hockey Hall of Fame. In 2017 Mahovlich was named one of the &#x27;100 Greatest NHL Players&#x27; in history. Mahovlich was inducted into the Ontario Sports Hall of Fame in 1999. His brother Peter also played in the NHL. His nickname is &quot;The Big M&quot;.

==Playing career==
Mahovlich is the son of Croatian immigrants. He was scouted by several National Hockey League teams while playing for the Schumacher Lions of the Northern Ontario Hockey Association. He signed with the Toronto Maple Leafs, who sent him to one of their Ontario Hockey Association affiliates, the Toronto St. Michael&#x27;s Majors. Mahovlich played there while attending St. Michael&#x27;s College School from 1954 to 1957. While at St. Michael&#x27;s, he received instruction from Joe Primeau, who Mahovlich would later call the best coach he ever had. Mahovlich received the Red Tilson Trophy as the top player in the OHA for the 1956–57 season, in which he scored 52 goals in 49 games.

He joined the Leafs in 1957 and was a 20-goal scorer in his first season, winning the Calder Memorial Trophy as rookie of the year in what was otherwise a rough season with the last-place Leafs. During the off-season, he took courses at Assumption University in Windsor, Ontario. At the same time, Punch Imlach was hired to run the Leafs and soon became head coach and general manager.

In the 1960–61 season, Imlach put Mahovlich on a line with Red Kelly and Bob Nevin. The three immediately clicked and were the team&#x27;s top three scorers that year, led by Mahovlich&#x27;s 48 goals—a Leaf record that would stand for 21 years. The following season, the Leafs won the Stanley Cup, and repeated as champions in 1963 and 1964. Mahovlich led the team in goals scored in all three seasons.

Initially, Mahovlich and Imlach got along well, but their relationship deteriorated after winning the 1962 Stanley Cup, particularly when Mahovlich&#x27;s contract was up for renewal at the end of the 1962 season. He felt the Leafs gave him a low-ball offer and walked out on the team during training camp in September. Red Burnett at the &quot;Toronto Star&quot; described the situation as a &quot;cold war&quot; between Imlach and Mahovlich.

At that time, the National Hockey League All-Star Game was played at the beginning of the season, and during a reception in Toronto attended by team executives in the days before the 1962 game, Chicago Black Hawks owner James D. Norris offered the Leafs $1 million for Mahovlich. He believed he had an agreement with Leafs co-owner Harold Ballard and paid $1,000 as a deposit with the balance to be delivered by cheque the next morning. The next day, the Leafs gave Mahovlich the money he had been asking for and told the Black Hawks that their apparent agreement the night before had been a misunderstanding. The Leafs returned the $1,000 deposit. The Black Hawks accused the Leafs of reneging on a deal. Conn Smythe, at this point a minority shareholder in the Leafs, was adamant that the deal should be rejected. Mahovlich eventually spoke out publicly and reaffirmed his commitment to the Leafs.

Mahovlich also had a rocky relationship with fans at Maple Leaf Gardens and was often booed at home games. Imlach—who mispronounced Mahovlich&#x27;s name for years—became a constant critic and, under pressure from fans and management, Mahovlich was admitted to Toronto General Hospital in November 1964, suffering from what was publicly described as &quot;constant fatigue&quot; but diagnosed as acute depression. Mahovlich was flooded with well-wishes from fans during his time off. He returned to the lineup a month later and was still able to lead the Leafs in scoring in the 1964–65 season, despite missing 11 games. Mahovlich led the Leafs in scoring again in the 1965–66 season.

The Leafs won the Stanley Cup in the 1966–67 season, with Mahovlich having his lowest-scoring year in seven seasons. Early into the next season, Mahovlich was again admitted to hospital, although this time it was acknowledged publicly as depression and tension. &quot;Mahovlich is a sensitive, easily-bruised individual,&quot; wrote Milt Dunnell in a page-one story in the &quot;Toronto Star&quot;.

Mahovlich was part of a six-player blockbuster transaction in which he was traded along with Pete Stemkowski and Garry Unger from the Maple Leafs to the Detroit Red Wings for Norm Ullman, Paul Henderson and Floyd Smith on March 4, 1968. The Maple Leafs and Red Wings were in fifth and sixth place respectively at the bottom of the East Division standings. He had 19 goals and 17 assists in 50 games that season and was the leading goalscorer in Maple Leafs franchise history with 296 at the time of the deal. He joined a Red Wings team that also featured his younger brother Pete. He said in a press conference announcing the trade, &quot;Business is business and if I can&#x27;t please them here, maybe I&#x27;ll be able to please them there.&quot;

Mahovlich had a strong finish to the season with the Red Wings, and the following year put up his best point totals in eight seasons, playing on a line with Gordie Howe and Alex Delvecchio, and setting his record for goals in a season with 49. Initially, one of his teammates on the Red Wings was his younger brother, Peter Mahovlich, who split his time between the Wings and their minor league affiliate.

In 1970–71, Red Wings general manager Sid Abel wanted to get rid of coach Ned Harkness and was overruled by team owner Bruce Norris. Once Harkness took over as general manager, he got rid of players he deemed a threat to him. On January 13, 1971, Mahovlich was traded to the Montreal Canadiens for Mickey Redmond, Guy Charron, and Bill Collins. He was reunited with his brother, who had become a star player himself with the Canadiens. Mahovlich spent three-and-a-half seasons in Montreal, playing on the Stanley Cup-winning teams of 1971 and 1973. During the 1971–72 season, Mahovlich scored a career-high 96 points, which he nearly matched the following season with 93 points.

He also was a member of Team Canada for the 1972 Summit Series against the Soviet Union. In 1974, he left the NHL for the World Hockey Association and represented Canada again at the 1974 Summit Series. In the WHA, he played for the Toronto Toros and the Birmingham Bulls until his retirement in 1979 at the age of 41. While with the Bulls, Mahovlich was placed on an unproductive line with enforcers Frank Beaton and Dave Hanson, one of the Hanson Brothers who had been in the movie &quot;Slap Shot&quot;. According to John Brophy, when a reporter asked Mahovlich what was wrong, he replied, &quot;I don&#x27;t know, but I seem to play a lot better with Howe and Delvecchio.&quot;

He attempted an NHL comeback with the Detroit Red Wings in 1979, but it was unsuccessful, and he formally retired on October 7, 1979.

In an NHL documentary about the Stanley Cup, Mahovlich claimed credit for being the first player to hoist the Stanley Cup above his head. After the Leafs&#x27; victory in the 1962 Cup Finals, in the team locker room, Mahovlich said he held the Cup, felt how light it was, and hoisted it above his head, which was then photographed.

<doc id="366555" wikidata="Q206229" url="?curid=366555" title="Biomolecule">
<text>A biomolecule or biological molecule is loosely defined as a molecule produced by a living organism and essential to one or more typically biological processes. Biomolecules include large macromolecules such as proteins, carbohydrates, lipids, and nucleic acids, as well as small molecules such as vitamins and hormones. A general name for this class of material is &quot;biological materials&quot;. Biomolecules are an important element of living organisms. They are often endogenous, i.e. produced within the organism, but organisms usually also need exogenous biomolecules, for example certain nutrients, to survive.

Biomolecules and their reactions are studied in biology and its subfields of biochemistry and molecular biology. Most biomolecules are organic compounds, and just four elements—oxygen, carbon, hydrogen, and nitrogen—make up 96% of the human body&#x27;s mass. But many other elements, such as the various biometals, are also present in small amounts.

The uniformity of both specific types of molecules (the biomolecules) and of certain metabolic pathways are invariant features among the wide diversity of life forms; thus these biomolecules and metabolic pathways are referred to as &quot;biochemical universals&quot; or &quot;theory of material unity of the living beings&quot;, a unifying concept in biology, along with cell theory and evolution theory.

==Types of biomolecules==
A diverse range of biomolecules exist, including:

* Small molecules:
** Lipids, fatty acids, glycolipids, sterols, monosaccharides 
** Vitamins
** Hormones, neurotransmitters 
** Metabolites
* Monomers, oligomers and polymers:

==Nucleosides and nucleotides==
Nucleosides are molecules formed by attaching a nucleobase to a ribose or deoxyribose ring. Examples of these include cytidine (C), uridine (U), adenosine (A), guanosine (G), and thymidine (T).

Nucleosides can be phosphorylated by specific kinases in the cell, producing nucleotides. 
Both DNA and RNA are polymers, consisting of long, linear molecules assembled by polymerase enzymes from repeating structural units, or monomers, of mononucleotides. DNA uses the deoxynucleotides C, G, A, and T, while RNA uses the ribonucleotides (which have an extra hydroxyl(OH) group on the pentose ring) C, G, A, and U. Modified bases are fairly common (such as with methyl groups on the base ring), as found in ribosomal RNA or transfer RNAs or for discriminating the new from old strands of DNA after replication.

Each nucleotide is made of an acyclic nitrogenous base, a pentose and one to three phosphate groups. They contain carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, hydrogen and phosphorus. They serve as sources of chemical energy (adenosine triphosphate and guanosine triphosphate), participate in cellular signaling (cyclic guanosine monophosphate and cyclic adenosine monophosphate), and are incorporated into important cofactors of enzymatic reactions (coenzyme A, flavin adenine dinucleotide, flavin mononucleotide, and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate).

===DNA and RNA structure===
DNA structure is dominated by the well-known double helix formed by Watson-Crick base-pairing of C with G and A with T. This is known as B-form DNA, and is overwhelmingly the most favorable and common state of DNA; its highly specific and stable base-pairing is the basis of reliable genetic information storage. DNA can sometimes occur as single strands (often needing to be stabilized by single-strand binding proteins) or as A-form or Z-form helices, and occasionally in more complex 3D structures such as the crossover at Holliday junctions during DNA replication.
RNA, in contrast, forms large and complex 3D tertiary structures reminiscent of proteins, as well as the loose single strands with locally folded regions that constitute messenger RNA molecules. Those RNA structures contain many stretches of A-form double helix, connected into definite 3D arrangements by single-stranded loops, bulges, and junctions. Examples are tRNA, ribosomes, ribozymes, and riboswitches. These complex structures are facilitated by the fact that RNA backbone has less local flexibility than DNA but a large set of distinct conformations, apparently because of both positive and negative interactions of the extra OH on the ribose. Structured RNA molecules can do highly specific binding of other molecules and can themselves be recognized specifically; in addition, they can perform enzymatic catalysis (when they are known as &quot;ribozymes&quot;, as initially discovered by Tom Cech and colleagues).

==Saccharides==
Monosaccharides are the simplest form of carbohydrates with only one simple sugar. They essentially contain an aldehyde or ketone group in their structure. The presence of an aldehyde group in a monosaccharide is indicated by the prefix &quot;aldo-&quot;. Similarly, a ketone group is denoted by the prefix &quot;keto-&quot;. Examples of monosaccharides are the hexoses, glucose, fructose, Trioses, Tetroses, Heptoses, galactose, pentoses, ribose, and deoxyribose. Consumed fructose and glucose have different rates of gastric emptying, are differentially absorbed and have different metabolic fates, providing multiple opportunities for two different saccharides to differentially affect food intake. Most saccharides eventually provide fuel for cellular respiration.

Disaccharides are formed when two monosaccharides, or two single simple sugars, form a bond with removal of water. They can be hydrolyzed to yield their saccharin building blocks by boiling with dilute acid or reacting them with appropriate enzymes. Examples of disaccharides include sucrose, maltose, and lactose.

Polysaccharides are polymerized monosaccharides, or complex carbohydrates. They have multiple simple sugars. Examples are starch, cellulose, and glycogen. They are generally large and often have a complex branched connectivity. Because of their size, polysaccharides are not water-soluble, but their many hydroxy groups become hydrated individually when exposed to water, and some polysaccharides form thick colloidal dispersions when heated in water. Shorter polysaccharides, with 3 to 10 monomers, are called oligosaccharides.
A fluorescent indicator-displacement molecular imprinting sensor was developed for discriminating saccharides. It successfully discriminated three brands of orange juice beverage. The change in fluorescence intensity of the sensing films resulting is directly related to the saccharide concentration.

==Lignin==
Lignin is a complex polyphenolic macromolecule composed mainly of beta-O4-aryl linkages. After cellulose, lignin is the second most abundant biopolymer and is one of the primary structural components of most plants. It contains subunits derived from &quot;p&quot;-coumaryl alcohol, coniferyl alcohol, and sinapyl alcohol, and is unusual among biomolecules in that it is racemic. The lack of optical activity is due to the polymerization of lignin which occurs via free radical coupling reactions in which there is no preference for either configuration at a chiral center.

==Lipid==
Lipids (oleaginous) are chiefly fatty acid esters, and are the basic building blocks of biological membranes. Another biological role is energy storage (e.g., triglycerides). Most lipids consist of a polar or hydrophilic head (typically glycerol) and one to three non polar or hydrophobic fatty acid tails, and therefore they are amphiphilic. Fatty acids consist of unbranched chains of carbon atoms that are connected by single bonds alone (saturated fatty acids) or by both single and double bonds (unsaturated fatty acids). The chains are usually 14-24 carbon groups long, but it is always an even number.

For lipids present in biological membranes, the hydrophilic head is from one of three classes:

* Glycolipids, whose heads contain an oligosaccharide with 1-15 saccharide residues.
* Phospholipids, whose heads contain a positively charged group that is linked to the tail by a negatively charged phosphate group.
* Sterols, whose heads contain a planar steroid ring, for example, cholesterol.

Other lipids include prostaglandins and leukotrienes which are both 20-carbon fatty acyl units synthesized from arachidonic acid.
They are also known as fatty acids

==Amino acids==
Amino acids contain both amino and carboxylic acid functional groups. (In biochemistry, the term amino acid is used when referring to those amino acids in which the amino and carboxylate functionalities are attached to the same carbon, plus proline which is not actually an amino acid).

Modified amino acids are sometimes observed in proteins; this is usually the result of enzymatic modification after translation (protein synthesis). For example, phosphorylation of serine by kinases and dephosphorylation by phosphatases is an important control mechanism in the cell cycle. Only two amino acids other than the standard twenty are known to be incorporated into proteins during translation, in certain organisms:

* Selenocysteine is incorporated into some proteins at a UGA codon, which is normally a stop codon.
* Pyrrolysine is incorporated into some proteins at a UAG codon. For instance, in some methanogens in enzymes that are used to produce methane.

Besides those used in protein synthesis, other biologically important amino acids include carnitine (used in lipid transport within a cell), ornithine, GABA and taurine.

===Protein structure===

The particular series of amino acids that form a protein is known as that protein&#x27;s primary structure. This sequence is determined by the genetic makeup of the individual. It specifies the order of side-chain groups along the linear polypeptide &quot;backbone&quot;.

Proteins have two types of well-classified, frequently occurring elements of local structure defined by a particular pattern of hydrogen bonds along the backbone: alpha helix and beta sheet. Their number and arrangement is called the secondary structure of the protein. Alpha helices are regular spirals stabilized by hydrogen bonds between the backbone CO group (carbonyl) of one amino acid residue and the backbone NH group (amide) of the i+4 residue. The spiral has about 3.6 amino acids per turn, and the amino acid side chains stick out from the cylinder of the helix. Beta pleated sheets are formed by backbone hydrogen bonds between individual beta strands each of which is in an &quot;extended&quot;, or fully stretched-out, conformation. The strands may lie parallel or antiparallel to each other, and the side-chain direction alternates above and below the sheet. Hemoglobin contains only helices, natural silk is formed of beta pleated sheets, and many enzymes have a pattern of alternating helices and beta-strands. The secondary-structure elements are connected by &quot;loop&quot; or &quot;coil&quot; regions of non-repetitive conformation, which are sometimes quite mobile or disordered but usually adopt a well-defined, stable arrangement.

The overall, compact, 3D structure of a protein is termed its tertiary structure or its &quot;fold&quot;. It is formed as result of various attractive forces like hydrogen bonding, disulfide bridges, hydrophobic interactions, hydrophilic interactions, van der Waals force etc.

When two or more polypeptide chains (either of identical or of different sequence) cluster to form a protein, quaternary structure of protein is formed. Quaternary structure is an attribute of polymeric (same-sequence chains) or heteromeric (different-sequence chains) proteins like hemoglobin, which consists of two &quot;alpha&quot; and two &quot;beta&quot; polypeptide chains.

====Apoenzymes====
An apoenzyme (or, generally, an apoprotein) is the protein without any small-molecule cofactors, substrates, or inhibitors bound. It is often important as an inactive storage, transport, or secretory form of a protein. This is required, for instance, to protect the secretory cell from the activity of that protein.
Apoenzymes become active enzymes on addition of a cofactor. Cofactors can be either inorganic (e.g., metal ions and iron-sulfur clusters) or organic compounds, (e.g., [Flavin group|flavin] and heme). Organic cofactors can be either prosthetic groups, which are tightly bound to an enzyme, or coenzymes, which are released from the enzyme&#x27;s active site during the reaction.

====Isoenzymes====
Isoenzymes, or isozymes, are multiple forms of an enzyme, with slightly different protein sequence and closely similar but usually not identical functions. They are either products of different genes, or else different products of alternative splicing. They may either be produced in different organs or cell types to perform the same function, or several isoenzymes may be produced in the same cell type under differential regulation to suit the needs of changing development or environment. LDH (lactate dehydrogenase) has multiple isozymes, while fetal hemoglobin is an example of a developmentally regulated isoform of a non-enzymatic protein. The relative levels of isoenzymes in blood can be used to diagnose problems in the organ of secretion .

<text>Hearst Castle, known formally as La Cuesta Encantada (Spanish for &quot;The Enchanted Hill&quot;), is a historic estate in San Simeon, located on the Central Coast of California. Conceived by William Randolph Hearst, the publishing tycoon, and his architect Julia Morgan, the castle was built between 1919 and 1947. Today, Hearst Castle is a museum open to the public as a California State Park and registered as a National Historic Landmark and California Historical Landmark.

George Hearst, William Randolph Hearst&#x27;s father, had purchased the original estate in 1865 and Camp Hill, the site for the future Hearst Castle, was used for family camping vacations during Hearst&#x27;s youth. In 1919, William Randolph inherited some $11,000,000 () and estates including the land at San Simeon. He used his fortune to further develop his media empire of newspapers, magazines and radio stations, the profits from which supported a lifetime of building and collecting. Within a few months of the death of his mother, Phoebe Hearst, he had commissioned Julia Morgan to build &quot;something a little more comfortable up on the hill&quot;, the genesis of the present castle. Morgan was an architectural pioneer; &quot;America&#x27;s first truly independent female architect&quot;, she was the first woman to study architecture at the School of Beaux-Arts in Paris, the first to have her own architectural practice in California and the first female winner of the American Institute of Architects Gold Medal. She worked in close collaboration with Hearst for over twenty years, and the castle at San Simeon is her best-known creation.

In the Roaring Twenties and into the 1930s, Hearst Castle reached its social peak. Originally intended to be a family home for Hearst, his wife Millicent and their five sons, by 1925 Hearst&#x27;s marriage was effectively over and San Simeon became his domain and that of his mistress, the actress Marion Davies. Their guest list included many of the Hollywood stars of the period; Charlie Chaplin, Cary Grant, the Marx Brothers, Greta Garbo, Buster Keaton, Mary Pickford, Jean Harlow and Clark Gable all visited, some on multiple occasions. Political luminaries encompassed Calvin Coolidge and Winston Churchill while other notables included Charles Lindbergh, P. G. Wodehouse and Bernard Shaw. Visitors gathered each evening at Casa Grande for drinks in the assembly room, dined in the refectory and watched the latest movie in the theater before retiring to the luxurious accommodation provided by the guest houses of Casa del Mar, Casa del Monte and Casa del Sol. During the days, they admired the views, rode, played tennis, bowled or golfed and swam in the &quot;most sumptuous swimming pool on earth&quot;. While Hearst entertained, Morgan built; the castle was under almost continual construction from 1920 until 1939, with work resuming after the end of World War II until Hearst&#x27;s final departure in 1947.

Hearst, his castle and his lifestyle were satirized by Orson Welles in his 1941 film &quot;Citizen Kane&quot;. In the film, which Hearst sought to suppress, Charles Foster Kane&#x27;s palace Xanadu is said to contain &quot;paintings, pictures, statues, the very stones of many another palace – a collection of everything so big it can never be cataloged or appraised; enough for ten museums; the loot of the world&quot;. Welles&#x27;s allusion referred to Hearst&#x27;s mania for collecting; the dealer Joseph Duveen called him the &quot;Great Accumulator&quot;. With a passion for acquisition almost from childhood, he bought architectural elements, art, antiques, statuary, silverware and textiles on an epic scale. Shortly after starting San Simeon, he began to conceive of making the castle &quot;a museum of the best things that I can secure&quot;. Foremost among his purchases were architectural elements from Western Europe, particularly Spain; over thirty ceilings, doorcases, fireplaces and mantels, entire monasteries, paneling and a medieval tithe barn were purchased, shipped to Hearst&#x27;s Brooklyn warehouses and transported on to California. Much was then incorporated into the fabric of Hearst Castle. In addition, he built up collections of more conventional art and antiques of high quality; his assemblage of ancient Greek vases was one of the world&#x27;s largest.

In May 1947, Hearst&#x27;s health compelled him and Marion Davies to leave the castle for the last time. He died in Los Angeles in 1951. Morgan died in 1957. The following year, the Hearst family gave the castle and many of its contents to the State of California and the mansion was opened to the public in June 1958. It has since operated as the Hearst San Simeon State Historical Monument and attracts about 750,000 visitors annually. The Hearst family retains ownership of the majority of the wider estate of and, under a land conservation agreement reached in 2005, has worked with the California State Parks Department and American Land Conservancy to preserve the undeveloped character of the area; the setting for the castle which Bernard Shaw is said to have described as &quot;what God would have built if he had had the money&quot;.
== History ==

===Early history: to 1864===

The coastal range of Southern California has been occupied since prehistoric times. The indigenous inhabitants were the Salinans and the Chumash. In the late 18th century, Spanish missions were established in the area to convert the Native American population. Mission San Miguel Arcángel, one of the largest, opened in what is now San Luis Obispo county in 1797. By the 1840s, the mission had declined and the priests departed. In that decade, the governors of Mexican California distributed the mission lands in a series of grants. Three of these were Rancho Piedra Blanca, Rancho Santa Rosa and Rancho San Simeon. The Mexican–American War of 1846–1848 saw the area pass into the control of the United States under the terms of the Mexican Cession. The California gold rush of the next decade brought an influx of American settlers, among whom was the 30-year old George Hearst.

===Buying the land: 1865–1919===
Born in Missouri in 1820, Hearst made his fortune as a miner, notably at the Comstock Lode and the Homestake Mine. He then undertook a political career, becoming a senator in 1886, and bought &quot;The San Francisco Examiner&quot;. Investing in land, he bought the Piedra Blanca property in 1865 and subsequently extended his holdings with the acquisition of most of the Santa Rosa estate, and much of the San Simeon lands. In the 1870s George Hearst built a ranch house on the estate, which remains a private property maintained by the Hearst Corporation, and the San Simeon area became a site for family camping expeditions, including his young son, William. A particularly favored spot was named Camp Hill, the site of the future Hearst Castle. Years later Hearst recalled his early memories of the place. &quot;My father brought me to San Simeon as a boy. I had to come up the slope hanging on to the tail of a pony. We lived in a cabin on this spot and I could see forever. That&#x27;s the West – forever.&quot; George Hearst developed the estate somewhat, introducing beef and dairy cattle, planting extensive fruit orchards, and expanding the wharf facilities at San Simeon Bay. He also bred racehorses. While his father developed the ranch, Hearst and his mother traveled, including an eighteen-month tour of Europe in 1873, where Hearst&#x27;s lifelong obsession with art collecting began.

At George Hearst&#x27;s death in 1891, he left an estate of $18 million to his widow including the California ranch. Phoebe Hearst shared the cultural and artistic interests of her son, collecting art and patronizing architects. She was also a considerable philanthropist, founding schools and libraries, supporting the fledgling University of California, Berkeley, including the funding of the Hearst Mining Building in memory of her husband, and making major donations to a range of women&#x27;s organizations, including the YWCA. During this period, probably in the late 1890s, Mrs Hearst encountered Julia Morgan, a young architecture student at Berkeley. On Phoebe Hearst&#x27;s own death in 1919, Hearst inherited the ranch, which had grown to and of coastline, as well as $11 million. Within days, he was at Morgan&#x27;s San Francisco office.

===Morgan and Hearst: &quot;a true collaboration&quot;===

Julia Morgan, born in 1872, was forty-seven when Hearst entered her office in 1919. Her biographer Mark A. Wilson has described her subsequent career as that of &quot;America&#x27;s first independent full-time woman architect&quot;. After studying at Berkeley, where she worked with Bernard Maybeck, in 1898 she became the first woman to win entry to the prestigious École des Beaux-Arts in Paris. Passing out from the École in 1902, Morgan returned to San Francisco and took up a post at the architectural practice of John Galen Howard. Howard recognized Morgan&#x27;s talents, but also exploited them – &quot;... the best thing about this person is, I pay her almost nothing, as it is a woman&quot; – and in 1904, she passed the California architects&#x27; licensing examination, the first woman to do so, establishing her own office at 456 Montgomery Street in 1906. During her time with Howard, Morgan was commissioned by Phoebe Hearst to undertake work at her Hacienda del Pozo de Verona estate at Pleasanton. This led to work at Wyntoon and to a number of commissions from Hearst himself; an unexecuted design for a mansion at Sausalito, north of San Francisco, a cottage at the Grand Canyon, and the Los Angeles Examiner Building.

In 1919, when he turned up at Morgan&#x27;s office, Hearst was fifty-six years old and the owner of a publishing empire that included twenty-eight newspapers, thirteen magazines, eight radio stations, four film studios, extensive real-estate holdings and thirty-one thousand employees. He was also a significant public figure: although his political endeavors had proved largely unsuccessful, the influence he exerted through his very direct control of his media empire attracted fame and opprobrium in equal measure. In 1917, one biographer described him as &quot;the most hated man in the country&quot;. The actor Ralph Bellamy, a guest at San Simeon in the mid-1930s, recorded Hearst&#x27;s working methods in a description of a party in the assembly room: &quot;the party was quite gay. And in the midst of it, Mr Hearst came in. There was a (teletype machine) just inside and he stopped and he read it. He went to a table and picked up a phone. He asked for the editor of (his) San Francisco newspaper and he said, &#x27;Put this in a two-column box of the front pages of all the newspapers tomorrow morning.&#x27; And without notes he dictated an editorial&quot;.

Morgan and Hearst&#x27;s partnership at San Simeon lasted from 1919, until his final departure from the castle in 1947. Their correspondence, preserved in the Julia Morgan archive in the Robert E. Kennedy Library at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo, runs to some 3,700 letters and telegrams. Victoria Kastner, Hearst Castle&#x27;s in-house custodian, has described the partnership as &quot;a rare, true collaboration&quot; and there are many contemporary accounts of the closeness of the relationship. Walter Steilberg, a draughtsman in Morgan&#x27;s office, once observed them at dinner; &quot;The rest of us could have been a hundred miles away; they didn&#x27;t pay any attention to anybody ... these two very different people just clicked&quot;. Thomas Aidala, in his 1984 history of the castle, made a similar observation: &quot;seated opposite each other, they would discuss and review work, consider design changes, pass drawings back and forth ... seemingly oblivious of the rest of the guests&quot;.

===Having a ball: 1925–1938===
Hearst and his family occupied Casa Grande for the first time at Christmas, 1925. Thereafter, Hearst&#x27;s wife, Millicent, went back to New York, and from 1926 until they left for the last time in 1947, Hearst&#x27;s mistress Marion Davies acted as his chatelaine at the castle. The Hollywood and political elite often visited in the 1920s and 1930s. Among Hearst&#x27;s guests were Calvin Coolidge, Winston Churchill, Charlie Chaplin, Cary Grant, the Marx Brothers, Charles Lindbergh, Jean Harlow and Clark Gable. Churchill described his host, and Millicent Hearst and Davies, in a letter to his own wife; &quot;a grave simple child – with no doubt a nasty temper – playing with the most costly toys ... two magnificent establishments, two charming wives, complete indifference to public opinion, oriental hospitalities&quot;. In another letter to Clementine, Churchill dismissed criticism of San Simeon; &quot;his house is rudely described as Monte Carlo Casino on top of the Rock of Gibraltar - but it is better than this.&quot; Weekend guests were either brought by private train from Glendale Station north of Los Angeles, and then by car to the castle, or flew into Hearst&#x27;s airstrip, generally arriving late on Friday evening or on Saturday. Cecil Beaton wrote of his impressions during his first visit for New Year&#x27;s Eve in 1931: &quot;we caught sight of a vast, sparkling white castle in Spain. It was out of a fairy story. The sun poured down with theatrical brilliance on tons of white marble and white stone. There seemed to be a thousand statues, pedestals, urns. The flowers were unreal in their ordered profusion. Hearst stood smiling at the top of one of the many flights of garden steps&quot;.

Guests were generally left to their own devices during the day. Horse-riding, shooting, swimming, golf, croquet and tennis were all available, while Hearst would lead mounted parties for picnics on the estate. The only absolute deadline was for cocktails in the assembly room at 7.30 on Saturday night. Alcohol was rationed; guests were not permitted to have liquor in their rooms, and were limited to one cocktail each before dinner. This was due not to meanness on Hearst&#x27;s part but to his concerns over Davies&#x27;s alcoholism, though the rule was frequently flouted. The actor David Niven later reflected on his supplying illicit alcohol to Davies; &quot;It seemed fun at the time to stoke up her fire of outrageous fun and I got a kick out of feeling I had outwitted one of the most powerful and best informed men on earth, but what a disloyal and crummy betrayal of (him) and what a nasty potential nail to put in her coffin&quot;. Dinner was served at 9.00 in the refectory. Wine came from Hearst&#x27;s 7,000-bottle cellar. Charlie Chaplin commented on the fare; &quot;dinners were elaborate, pheasant, wild duck, partridge and venison&quot; but also the informality, &quot;amidst the opulence, we were served paper napkins, it was only when Mrs. Hearst was in residence that the guests were given linen ones&quot;. The informality extended to the ketchup bottles and condiments in jars which were remarked on by many guests. Dinner was invariably followed by a movie; initially outside, and then in the theater. The actress Ilka Chase recorded a showing in the early 1930s; &quot;the theater was not yet complete – the plaster was still wet – so an immense pile of fur coats was heaped at the door and each guest picked one up and enveloped himself before entering...Hearst and Marion, close together in the gloom and bundled in their fur coats, looked for all the world like the big and baby bears&quot;. Movies were generally films from Hearst&#x27;s own studio, Cosmopolitan Productions, and often featured Marion Davies. Sherman Eubanks, whose father worked as an electrician at the castle, recorded in an oral history: &quot;Mr Hearst would push a button and call up to the projectionist and say &#x27;Put on Marion&#x27;s &quot;Peg o&#x27; My Heart&quot;&#x27;. So I&#x27;ve seen &quot;Peg o&#x27; My Heart&quot; about fifty times. This is not being critical. I&#x27;m simply saying that&#x27;s the way it was&quot;. Chase noted that this repetition tended to &quot;put a slight strain on the guests&#x27; gratitude&quot;.

In 1937, Patricia Van Cleeve married at the castle, the grandest social occasion there since the visit of President and Mrs Coolidge in February 1930. Ken Murray records these two events as the only occasions when formal attire was required of guests to the castle. Van Cleeve, who married the actor, Arthur Lake, was always introduced as Marion Davies&#x27; favorite niece. It was frequently rumored that she was in fact Davies and Hearst&#x27;s daughter, something she herself acknowledged just before her death in 1993. In February 1938, a plane crash at the San Simeon airstrip led to the deaths of Lord and Lady Plunket, who were traveling to the castle as Hearst&#x27;s guests, and the pilot Tex Phillips. The only other passenger, the bobsledding champion, James Lawrence, survived.

===The specter at the feast: Hearst, Welles and Xanadu===

Hearst Castle was the inspiration for Xanadu, and Hearst himself the main model for Charles Foster Kane in Orson Welles&#x27;s 1941 film &quot;Citizen Kane&quot;. Having made his name with the Mercury Theatre production of &quot;The War of the Worlds&quot; in 1938, Welles arrived in Hollywood in 1939 to make a film version of Joseph Conrad&#x27;s novel, &quot;Heart of Darkness&quot; for RKO Pictures. That film was not made and Welles began a collaboration with the screenwriter Herman J. Mankiewicz on a screenplay originally entitled &quot;American&quot;. The film tells the stories of Kane, a media magnate and aspiring politician, and of his second wife Susan Alexander, a failed opera singer driven to drink, who inhabit a castle in Florida, filled with &quot;paintings, pictures, statues, the very stones of many another palace – a collection of everything so big it can never be cataloged or appraised; enough for ten museums; the loot of the world&quot;. Filming began in June 1940 and the movie premiered on 1 June 1941. Although at the time Welles, and RKO, denied that the film was based on Hearst, his long-time friend and collaborator, John Houseman was clear, &quot;the truth is simple: for the basic concept of Charles Foster Kane and for the main lines and significant events of his public life, Mankiewicz used as his model the figure of William Randolph Hearst&quot;. Told of the film&#x27;s content before its release – his friends, the gossip columnists Hedda Hopper and Louella Parsons having attended early screenings – Hearst made strenuous efforts to stop the premiere. When these failed, he sought to damage the film&#x27;s circulation by alternately forbidding all mention of it in his media outlets, or by using them to attack both the movie and Welles. Hearst&#x27;s assault damaged the film at the box office, and harmed Welles&#x27; subsequent career. Since its inception in 1952 through to 2012, the Sight and Sound Critics&#x27; Poll voted &quot;Citizen Kane&quot; the greatest film of all time in every decade of polling. On 9 March 2012, the film was screened in the movie theater at Hearst Castle for the first time as part of the San Luis Obispo International Film Festival.

===Depression, death and after: 1939–present===

By the late 1930s the Great Depression and Hearst&#x27;s profligacy had brought him to the brink of financial ruin. Debts totaled $126 million. He was compelled to cede financial control of the Hearst Corporation, newspapers and radio stations were sold, and much of his art collection was dispersed in a series of sales, often for considerably less than he had paid. Hearst railed against his losses, and the perceived incompetence of the sales agents, Parish-Watson &amp; Co.: &quot;they greatly cheapened them and us, (he) advertises like a bargain basement sale. I am heartbroken&quot;. Construction at Hearst Castle virtually ceased. After Pearl Harbor the castle was closed up and Hearst and Davies moved to Wyntoon which was perceived to be less vulnerable to enemy attack. They returned in 1945 and construction on a limited scale recommenced, finally ending in 1947. In early May of that year, with his health declining, Hearst and Davies left the castle for the last time. The pair settled in at 1007 North Beverly Drive in Beverly Hills. Hearst died in 1951, his death abruptly severing him from Davies, who was excluded from the funeral by Hearst&#x27;s family – &quot;For thirty-two years I had him, and they leave me with his empty room&quot;. In 1950 Julia Morgan closed her San Francisco office after a career of forty-two years. Ill health circumscribed her retirement and she died, a virtual recluse, in early 1957.

In 1958 the Hearst Corporation donated Hearst Castle, its gardens, and many of its contents, to the state of California. A dedicatory plaque at the castle reads: &quot;La Cuesta Encantada presented to the State of California in 1958 by the Hearst Corporation in memory of William Randolph Hearst who created this Enchanted Hill, and of his mother, Phoebe Apperson Hearst, who inspired it&quot;. The castle was opened to the public for the first time in June 1958. Hearst Castle was added to the National Register of Historic Places on June 22, 1972, and became a United States National Historic Landmark on May 11, 1976. Hearst was always keen to protect the mystique of his castle. In 1926, he wrote to Morgan to congratulate her after a successful party was held on the hill: &quot;those wild movie people said it was wonderful and that the most extravagant dream of a movie picture fell far short of this reality. They all wanted to make a picture there but they are NOT going to be allowed to do this...&quot;. Commercial filming at the castle is still rarely allowed; since 1957 only two projects have been granted permission. Stanley Kubrick&#x27;s 1960 film &quot;Spartacus&quot; used the castle to stand in as Crassus&#x27; villa, and in 2014, Lady Gaga&#x27;s music video for &quot;G.U.Y.&quot; was filmed at the Neptune and Roman Pools.

On February 12, 1976, the Casa del Sol guesthouse was damaged by a bomb. The device was placed by allies of the Symbionese Liberation Army (SLA), in retaliation for Patty Hearst, Hearst&#x27;s granddaughter, testifying in court at her trial for armed robbery, following her kidnapping by the SLA in 1974. On December 22, 2003, an earthquake occurred with its epicenter some three miles north of the castle. With a magnitude of 6.5, it was the largest earthquake recorded at San Simeon - the very limited structural damage which resulted was a testament to the quality of the castle&#x27;s construction. Since its opening, the castle has become a major California tourist attraction, attracting over 850,000 visitors in 2018. Changes to the tour arrangements in 2019 allowed visitors time to explore the grounds independently, at the conclusion of the conducted tours. The Hearst family maintains a connection with the castle, which was closed for a day in early August 2019 for the wedding of Amanda Hearst, Hearst&#x27;s great-granddaughter.

The castle closed in March 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Many projects and repairs that would have been impossible to undertake with the castle open to tourists were completed during the closure. The castle reopened on May 11, 2022.

== Architecture ==

=== Design ===
Hearst first approached Morgan with ideas for a new project in April 1919, shortly after the death of his mother had brought him into his inheritance. His original idea was to build a bungalow, according to Walter Steilberg, one of Morgan&#x27;s draftsmen who recalled Hearst&#x27;s words from the initial meeting: &quot;I would like to build something up on the hill at San Simeon. I get tired of going up there and camping in tents. I&#x27;m getting a little too old for that. I&#x27;d like to get something that would be a little more comfortable&quot;.

Within a month, Hearst&#x27;s original ideas for a modest dwelling had greatly expanded. Discussion on the style began with consideration of &quot;Jappo-Swisso&quot; themes. Then the Spanish Colonial Revival style was favored. Morgan had used this style when she worked on Hearst&#x27;s &quot;Los Angeles Herald Examiner&quot; headquarters in 1915. Hearst appreciated the Spanish Revival but was dissatisfied with the crudeness of the colonial structures in California. Mexican colonial architecture had more sophistication, but he objected to its abundance of ornamentation. Thomas Aidala, in his 1984 study of the castle, notes the Churrigueresque influence on the design of the main block, &quot;flat and unembellished exterior surfaces; decorative urges are particularized and isolated, focused mainly on doorways, windows (and) towers&quot;. The 1915 Panama–California Exposition in San Diego held the closest approximations in California to the approach Hearst desired. But his European tours, and specifically the inspiration of the Iberian Peninsula, led him to Renaissance and Baroque examples in southern Spain that more exactly suited his tastes. He particularly admired a church in Ronda, Spain and asked Morgan to model the Casa Grande towers after it. In a letter to Morgan dated December 31, 1919, Hearst wrote, &quot;The San Diego Exposition is the best source of Spanish in California. The alternative is to build in the Renaissance style of southern Spain. We picked out the towers of the church at Ronda... a Renaissance decoration, particularly that of the very southern part of Spain, could harmonize well with them. I would very much like to have your views on... what style of architecture we should select.&quot; This blend of Southern Spanish Renaissance, Revival and Mediterranean examples became San Simeon&#x27;s defining style; &quot;something a little different than other people are doing out in California&quot;. The architectural writers Arrol Gellner and Douglas Keister describe Casa Grande as &quot;a palatial fusion of Classicism and Mediterranean architecture... [that] transcended the Mission Revival era and instead belonged to the more archaeological Period Revival styles that gained favor after the Panama–California Exposition of 1915&quot;.

Hearst Castle has a total of 42 bedrooms, 61 bathrooms, 19 sitting rooms, of gardens, indoor and outdoor swimming pools, tennis courts, a movie theater, an airfield and, during Hearst&#x27;s lifetime, the world&#x27;s largest private zoo. Hearst was an inveterate rethinker who would frequently order the redesign of previously agreed, and often built, structures: the Neptune Pool was rebuilt three times before he was satisfied. He was aware of his propensity for changing his mind; in a letter dated 18 March 1920, he wrote to Morgan; &quot;All little houses stunning. Please complete before I can think up any more changes&quot;. As a consequence of Hearst&#x27;s persistent design changes, and financial difficulties in the early and later 1930s, the complex was never finished. By late summer 1919, Morgan had surveyed the site, analyzed its geology, and drawn initial plans for Casa Grande. Construction began in 1919 and continued through 1947 when Hearst left the estate for the last time. During the early years of construction, until Hearst&#x27;s stays at San Simeon became longer and more frequent, his approval for the ongoing design was obtained by Morgan sending him models of planned developments. By the late 1920s the main model, designed by another female architect Julian C. Mesic, had become too large to ship and Mesic and Morgan would photograph it, hand color the images, and send these to Hearst.

=== Construction ===
The castle&#x27;s location presented major challenges for construction. It was remote; when Morgan began coming to the estate for site visits in 1919, she would leave her San Francisco office on Friday afternoon and take an eight-hour, 200-mile (320 km) train journey to San Luis Obispo, followed by a fifty-mile (80 km) drive to San Simeon. The relative isolation made recruiting and retaining a workforce a constant difficulty. In the early years, the estate lacked water, its limited supplies coming from three natural springs on Pine Mountain, a peak seven miles (11 km) east of Hearst Castle. The issue was addressed by the construction of three reservoirs and Morgan devised a gravity-based water delivery system that transported water from the nearby mountain springs to the reservoirs, including the main one on Rocky Butte, a knoll less than a mile southeast from Hearst Castle. Water was of particular importance; as well as feeding the pools and fountains Hearst desired, it provided electricity, by way of a private hydroelectric plant, until the San Joaquin Light and Power Corporation began service to the castle in 1924. The climate presented a further challenge. The proximity to the coast brought strong winds in from the Pacific Ocean and the site&#x27;s elevation meant that winter storms were frequent and severe.
Water was also essential for the production of concrete, the main structural component of the houses and their ancillary buildings. Morgan had substantial experience of building in steel-reinforced concrete and, together with the firm of consulting engineers Earl and Wright, experimented in finding suitable stone, eventually settling on that quarried from the mountain top on which the foundation platform for the castle was built. Combining this with desalinated sand from San Simeon Bay produced concrete of exceptionally high quality. Later, white sand was brought in from Carmel. Material for construction was transported either by train and truck, or by sea into a wharf built in San Simeon Bay below the site. In time, a light railway was constructed from the wharf to the castle, and Morgan built a compound of warehouses for storage and accommodation for workers by the bay.
Brick and tile works were also developed on site as brick was used extensively and tiling was an important element of the decoration of the castle. Morgan used several tile companies to produce her designs including Grueby Faience, Batchelder, California Faience and Solon &amp; Schemmel. Albert Solon and Frank Schemmel came to Hearst Castle to undertake tiling work and Solon&#x27;s brother, Camille, was responsible for the design of the mosaics of blue-and-gold Venetian glass tile used in the Roman pool and the murals in Hearst&#x27;s Gothic library.

Morgan worked with a series of construction managers; Henry Washburn from 1919 to 1922, then Camille Rossi from 1922, until his firing by Hearst in 1932, and finally George Loorz until 1940. From 1920 to 1939, there were between 25 and 150 workmen employed in construction at the castle.

=== Costs ===

The exact cost of the entire San Simeon complex is unknown. Kastner makes an estimate of expenditure on construction and furnishing the complex between 1919 and 1947 as &quot;under $10,000,000&quot;. Thomas Aidala suggests a slightly more precise figure for the overall cost at between $7.2 and $8.2 million. Hearst&#x27;s relaxed approach to using the funds of his companies, and sometimes the companies themselves, to make personal purchases made clear accounting for expenditure almost impossible. In 1927 one of his lawyers wrote, &quot;the entire history of your corporation shows an informal method of withdrawal of funds&quot;. In 1945, when the Hearst Corporation was closing the Hearst Castle account for the final time, Morgan gave a breakdown of construction costs, which did not include expenditure on antiques and furnishings. Casa Grande&#x27;s build cost is given as $2,987,000 and that for the guest houses, $500,000. Other works, including nearly half a million dollars on the Neptune pool, brought the total to $4,717,000. Morgan&#x27;s fees for twenty-odd years of almost continuous work, came to $70,755. Her initial fee was a 6% commission on total costs. This was later increased to 8.5%. Many additional expenses, and challenges in getting prompt payment, led her to receive rather less than this. Kastner suggests that Morgan made an overall profit of $100,000 on the entire, twenty-year, project. Her modest remuneration was unimportant to her. At the height of Hearst&#x27;s financial travails in the late 1930s, when his debts stood at over $87 million, Morgan wrote to him, &quot;I wish you would use me in any way that relieves your mind as to the care of your belongings. There never has been nor will there be, any charge in this connection, [it is] an honor and a pleasure&quot;.

===Plan of the castle complex===
=== Casa del Mar ===
Casa del Mar, the largest of the three guest houses, provided accommodation for Hearst himself until Casa Grande was ready in 1925. He stayed in the house again in 1947, during his last visit to the ranch. Casa del Mar contains 5,350 square feet (546 m2) of floor space. Although luxuriously designed and furnished, none of the guest houses had kitchen facilities, an omission that sometimes irritated Hearst&#x27;s guests. Adela Rogers St. Johns recounted her first visit: &quot;I rang and asked the maid for coffee. With a smile, she said I would have to go up to the castle for that. I asked Marion Davies about this. She said W. R. (Hearst) did not approve of breakfast in bed.&quot; Adjacent to Casa del Mar is the wellhead () from Phoebe Hearst&#x27;s Hacienda del Pozo de Verona, which Hearst moved to San Simeon when he sold his mother&#x27;s estate after her death in 1919.

=== Casa del Monte ===

Casa del Monte was the first of the guest houses, originally entitled simply Houses A (del Mar), B (del Monte) and C (del Sol), built by Morgan on the slopes below the site of Casa Grande during 1920–1924. Hearst had initially wanted to begin work with the construction of the main house but Morgan persuaded him to begin with the guest cottages because the smaller structures could be completed more quickly. Each guest house faces the Esplanade and appears as a single story at its front entrance. Additional stories descend rearward down the terraced mountain side. Casa del Monte has of living space.

=== Casa del Sol ===

The decorative style of the Casa del Sol is Moorish, accentuated by the use of antique Persian tiles. A bronze copy of Donatello&#x27;s David stands atop a copy of an original Spanish fountain. The inspiration for the fountain came from an illustration in a book, &quot;The Minor Ecclesiastical, Domestic and Garden Architecture of Southern Spain&quot;, written by Austin Whittlesey and published in 1919. Hearst sent a copy to Morgan, while retaining another for himself, and it proved a fertile source of ideas. The size of the house is 3,620 square feet (242 m2). Morgan&#x27;s staff were responsible for the cataloguing of those parts of Hearst&#x27;s art collection which were shipped to California and an oral record made in the 1980s indicates the methodology used for furnishing the buildings at San Simeon. &quot;We would set (the object) up and then I would stand with a yardstick to give it scale. Sam Crow would take a picture. Then we would give it a number and I would write a description. These were made into albums. When Mr Hearst would write and say &#x27;I want a Florentine mantel in Cottage C in Room B, and four yards of tiles&#x27;, then we would look it up in the books and find something that would fit.&quot;

=== Casa Grande ===
Construction of Casa Grande began in April 1922. Work continued almost until Hearst&#x27;s final departure on May 2, 1947, and even then the house was unfinished. The size of Casa Grande is 68,500 square feet (5,634 m2). The main western facade is four stories, the entrance front, inspired by a gateway in Seville, is flanked by twin bell towers modeled on the tower of the church of Santa Maria la Mayor. The layout of the main house was originally to a &quot;T&quot;-plan, with the assembly room to the front, and the refectory at a right angle to its center. The subsequent extensions of the North and South wings modified the original design. As elsewhere, the core construction material is concrete, though the façade is faced in stone. In October 1927 Morgan wrote to Arthur Byne; &quot;We finally took the bull by the horns and are facing the entire main building with a Manti stone from Utah.&quot; Morgan assured Hearst that it would be &quot;the making of the building&quot;. A cast-stone balcony fronts the second floor, and another in cast-iron the third. Above this is a large wooden overhang or gable. This was constructed in Siamese teak, originally intended to outfit a ship, which Morgan located in San Francisco. The carving was undertaken by her senior carver Jules Suppo. Sara Holmes Boutelle suggests Morgan may have been inspired by a somewhat similar example at the Mission San Xavier del Bac in Arizona. The façade terminates with the bell towers, comprising the Celestial suites, the carillon towers and two cupolas.

The curator Victoria Kastner notes a particular feature of Casa Grande, the absence of any grand staircases. Access to the upper floors is either by elevators or stairwells in the corner turrets of the building. Many of the stairwells are undecorated and the plain, poured concrete contrasts with the richness of the decoration elsewhere. The terrace in front of the entrance, named Central Plaza, has a quatrefoil pond at its center, with a statue of Galatea on a Dolphin. The statue was inherited, having been bought by Phoebe Hearst when her son was temporarily short of money. The doorway from the Central Plaza into Casa Grande illustrates Morgan and Hearst&#x27;s relaxed approach to combining genuine antiques with modern reproductions to achieve the effects they both desired. A 16th-century iron gate from Spain is topped by a fanlight grille, constructed in a matching style in the 1920s by Ed Trinkeller, the castle&#x27;s main ironmonger.

The castle made use of the latest technology. Casa Grande was wired with an early sound system, allowing guests to make music selections which were played from a Capehart phonograph located in the basement, and piped into rooms in the house through a system of speakers. Alternatively, six radio stations were available. The entire estate was also equipped with 80 telephones, operated through a PBX switchboard, which was staffed 24 hours a day, and ran under the exclusive exchange &#x27;Hacienda&#x27;. &quot;Fortune&quot; recorded an example of Hearst&#x27;s delighting in the ubiquitous access the system provided - &quot;(a guest) fell to wondering how a ball game came out while seated by a campfire with Mr Hearst, a day&#x27;s ride from the castle. &#x27;I&#x27;ll tell you&#x27; volunteers Mr Hearst and, fumbling with the rock against which he was leaning, pulls from there a telephone, asks for New York, and relieves his guest&#x27;s curiosity&quot;.

==== Assembly room ====
The assembly room is the main reception room of the castle, described by Taylor Coffman, in his 1985 study, &quot;Hearst Castle: The Story of William Randolph Hearst and San Simeon&quot;, as &quot;one of San Simeon&#x27;s most magnificent interiors&quot;. The fireplace, originally from a Burgundian chateau in Jours-lès-Baigneux, is named the Great Barney Mantel, after a previous owner, Charles T. Barney, from whose estate Hearst bought it after Barney&#x27;s suicide. The mantel had been acquired for Barney by society architect Stanford White and Kastner notes the major influence of White&#x27;s style on a number of rooms at Hearst Castle, in particular the assembly room and the main sitting room in Casa del Mar. The ceiling is from an Italian palazzo. A concealed door in the paneling next to the fireplace allowed Hearst to surprise his guests by entering unannounced. The door opened off an elevator which connected with his Gothic suite on the third floor. The assembly room, completed in 1926, is nearly 2,500 square feet in extent and was described by the writer and illustrator Ludwig Bemelmans as looking like &quot;half of Grand Central station&quot;.

The room held some of Hearst&#x27;s best tapestries. These include four from a set celebrating the Roman general Scipio Africanus, designed by Giulio Romano, and two copied from drawings by Peter Paul Rubens depicting &quot;The Triumph of Religion&quot;. The need to fit the tapestries above the paneling and below the roof required the installation of the unusually low windows. The room has the only piece of Art Nouveau decorative art in the castle, the &quot;Orchid Vase&quot; lamp, made by Tiffany for the Exposition Universelle held in Paris in 1889. Bought by Phoebe Hearst, who had the original vase converted to a lamp, Hearst placed it in the assembly room in tribute to his mother.

==== Refectory ====
The refectory was the only dining room in the castle, and was built between 1926 and 1927. The choir stalls which line the walls are from the La Seu d&#x27;Urgell Cathedral in Catalonia, Spain, and the silk flags mounted on the walls are Palio banners from Siena, Italy. Hearst originally intended a &quot;vaulted Moorish ceiling&quot; for the room but, finding nothing suitable, he and Morgan settled on the Italian Renaissance example, dating from around 1600, which Hearst purchased from a dealer in Rome in 1924. Victoria Kastner considered that the flat roof, with life-size carvings of saints, &quot;strikes a discordant note of horizontality among the vertical lines of the room&quot;. The style of the whole is Gothic, in contrast to the Renaissance approach adopted in the preceding assembly room. The refectory is said to have been Morgan&#x27;s favorite interior within the castle. The design of both the refectory and the assembly room was greatly influenced by the monumental architectural elements, especially the fireplaces and the choir stalls used as wainscoting, and works of art, particularly the tapestries, which Hearst determined would be incorporated into the rooms. The central table provided seating for 22 in its usual arrangement of two tables, which could be extended to three or four, on the occasion of larger gatherings. The tables were sourced from an Italian monastery and were the setting for some of the best pieces from Hearst&#x27;s collection of silverware. One of the finest is a wine cooler dating from the early 18th century and weighing 14.2 kg by the Anglo-French silversmith David Willaume.

==== Library ====
The library is on the second floor, directly above the assembly room. The ceiling is 16th century Spanish, and a remnant is used in the library&#x27;s lobby. It comprises three separate ceilings, from different rooms in the same Spanish house, which Morgan combined into one. The fireplace is the largest Italian example in the castle. Carved from limestone, it is attributed to the medieval sculptor and architect Benedetto da Maiano. The room contains a collection of over 5,000 books, with another 3,700 in Hearst&#x27;s study above. The majority of the library collections were sold at sales at Parke-Bernet at 1939 and Gimbels in 1941. The sales saw the disposal of some of the best items, including sets, often signed, of first editions by Charles Dickens, Hearst&#x27;s favorite author. The library is also the location for much of Hearst&#x27;s important holding of antique Greek vases.

==== Cloisters and the Doge&#x27;s Suite ====

The cloisters form a grouping of four bedrooms above the refectory and, along with the doge&#x27;s suite above the breakfast room, were completed in 1925–1926. The doge&#x27;s suite was occupied by Millicent Hearst on her rare visits to the castle. The room is lined with blue silk and has a Dutch painted ceiling, in addition to two more of Spanish origin, which was once the property of architect Stanford White. Morgan also incorporated an original Venetian loggia in the suite, refashioned as a balcony. The suite leads on to Morgan&#x27;s inventive North and South Duplex apartments, with sitting areas and bathrooms at entry level and bedrooms on mezzanine floors above.

==== Gothic suite ====
The gothic suite was Hearst&#x27;s private apartment on the third floor. He moved there in 1927. It comprises the gothic study or library and Hearst&#x27;s own gothic bedroom and private sitting room. The ceiling of the bedroom is one of the best Hearst bought; Spanish, of the 14th century, it was discovered by his Iberian agent Arthur Byne who also located the original frieze panels which had been detached and sold some time before. The whole was installed at the castle in 1924. The space originally allocated for the study was too low to create the impression desired by Morgan and Hearst, a difficulty Morgan surmounted by raising the roof and supporting the ceiling with concrete trusses. These, and the walls, were painted with frescoes by Camille Solon. Light was provided by two ranges of clerestory windows. The necessity of raising the roof to incorporate the study occasioned one of the few instances where Hearst hesitated, &quot;I telegraphed you my fear of the cost...I imagine it would be ghastly&quot;, and Morgan urged further changes and expense. The result vindicated Morgan. The study, completed in 1931, is dominated by a portrait of Hearst at age 31, painted by his life-long friend, Orrin Peck.

==== Celestial suites ====

The celestial bedrooms, with a connecting, shared, sitting room, were created between 1924 and 1926. The bell towers were raised to improve the proportions of the building, and the suites constructed in the spaces created below. The relatively cramped spaces allowed no room for storage, and en-suite bathrooms were &quot;awkwardly squeezed&quot; into lower landings. Ludwig Bemelmans, a guest in the 1930s, recalled; &quot;there was no place to hang your clothes, so I hung mine on wire coat hangers that a former tenant had left hanging on the arms of two six-armed gold candelabra, the rest I put on the floor&quot;. The sitting room contains one of the most important paintings in Hearst&#x27;s collection, &quot;Bonaparte Before the Sphinx&quot; (1886) by Jean-Léon Gérôme. The suites are linked externally by a walkway, the celestial bridge, which is decorated with elaborate tiling.

==== North and South wings ====
The north, or billiard, and the south, or service, wings complete the castle and were begun in 1929. The north wing houses the billiard room on the first floor, which was converted from the original breakfast room. It has a Spanish antique ceiling and a French fireplace and contains the oldest tapestry in the castle, a Millefleur hunting scene woven in Flanders in the 15th century. The spandrel over the doorcase is decorated with a frieze of 16th century Persian tiles depicting a battle. The 34 tiles originate from Isfahan and were purchased by Hearst at the Kevorkian sale in New York in 1922. The theater, which leads off the billiard room, was used both for amateur theatricals and the showing of movies from Hearst&#x27;s Cosmopolitan Studios. The theater accommodated fifty guests and had an electric keyboard that enabled the bells in the carillon towers to be played. The walls are decorated in red damask, which originally hung in the assembly room, and feature gilded caryatids.

The upper stories of the north wing were the last to be worked upon and were never completed. Activity recommenced in 1945 and Morgan delegated the work to her assistant, Warren McClure. Many of the rooms are unfinished but Aidala considers that the bathrooms in the wing represent &quot;first-rate examples of streamline design. The service wing contains the kitchen. The hotel-scale units and worktops are constructed in Monel Metal, an expensive form of nickel alloy invented in 1901. The wing contains further bedroom suites, a staff dining room and gives entry to the 9,000-square-foot basement which contained a wine cellar, pantries, the boiler plant which heated the main house, and a barber/hairdressing parlour, for the use of Hearst&#x27;s guests.

=== Planned but uncompleted elements ===

Hearst and Morgan intended a large ballroom or cloister to connect the North and South wings at the rear of Casa Grande and unify the whole composition but it was never undertaken. In 1932, Hearst contemplated incorporating the reja (grille) he had acquired from Valladolid Cathedral in 1929 into this room. He described his vision in a letter to Morgan dated that year; &quot;A great ballroom and banqueting hall, that is the scheme! Isn&#x27;t it a pippin.&quot; The letter was signed &quot;Sincerely, Your Assistant Architect&quot;. Other structures that did not develop beyond drawings and plans included two more guest houses, in English and Chinese architectural styles.

== Collections ==
Hearst was a voracious collector of art, with the stated intention of making the castle &quot;a museum of the best things that I can secure&quot;. The dealer Joseph Duveen, from whom Hearst bought despite their mutual dislike, called him the &quot;Great Accumulator&quot;. His robust approach to buying, particularly the purchase and removal of entire historic structures, generated considerable ill-feeling and sometimes outright opposition. His deconstruction and removal of the 14th century Bradenstoke Priory in England led the Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings to organize a campaign which used language so violent that its posters had to be pasted over for fear of a libel suit. Hearst sometimes encountered similar opposition elsewhere. In 1919 he was writing to Morgan about; &quot;the patio from Bergos (&quot;sic&quot;) which, by the way, I own but cannot get out of Spain&quot;. The dismantling of a monastery in Sacramenia, which Hearst bought in its entirety in the 1920s, saw his workmen attacked by enraged villagers. Hearst&#x27;s tardiness in paying his bills was another less attractive feature of his purchasing approach; in 1925 Morgan was obliged to write to Arthur Byne, &quot;Mr. Hearst accepts your dictum – cash or nothing&quot;.

Some of the finest pieces from the collections of books and manuscripts, tapestries, paintings, antiquities and sculpture, amounting to about half of Hearst&#x27;s total art holdings, were sold in sales in the late 1930s and early 1940s, when Hearst&#x27;s publishing empire was facing financial collapse, but a great deal remains. His art buying had started when he was young and, in his tested fashion, he established a company, the International Studio Arts Corporation, as a vehicle for purchasing works and as a means of dealing with their export and import. The curator Mary Levkoff divides the collection into four parts, the antiquities, the sculptures, the tapestries and the paintings, of which she considers the last of least significance. In 1975, the Hearst Corporation donated the archive of Hearst&#x27;s Brooklyn warehouses, the gathering point for almost all of his European acquisitions before their dispersal to his many homes, to Long Island University. As of 2015, the university has embarked on a digitization project which will ultimately see the 125 albums of records, and sundry other materials, made available online.

=== Antiquities ===
The ancient Egyptian, Greek and Roman antiquities are the oldest works in Hearst&#x27;s collection. The oldest of all are the stone figures of the Egyptian goddess Sekhmet which stand on the South Esplanade below Casa Grande and date from the Eighteenth and Nineteenth Dynasties, approximately 1550 to 1189 BC. Morgan designed the pool setting for the pieces, with tiling inspired by ancient Egyptian motifs. In the courtyard of Casa del Monte is one of a total of nine Roman sarcophagi collected by Hearst, dated to 230 AD and previously held at the Palazzo Barberini, which was acquired at the Charles T. Yerkes sale in 1910. The most important element of the antiquities collection is the holding of Greek vases, on display in the second-floor library. Although some 65 vases were purchased by the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York after Hearst&#x27;s death, those which remain at the castle still form one of the world&#x27;s largest groups. Hearst began collecting vases in 1901, and his collection was moved from his New York homes to the castle in 1935. At its peak, the collection numbered over 400 pieces. The vases were placed on the tops of the bookshelves in the library, each carefully wired in place to guard against vibrations from earthquakes. At the time of Hearst&#x27;s collecting, many of the vases were believed to be of Etruscan manufacture, but later scholars ascribe all of them to Greece.

=== Sculptures ===
Hearst often bought multiple lots from sales of major collections; in 1930 he purchased five antique Roman statues from the Lansdowne sale in London. Four are now in the collection of the Los Angeles County Museum of Art and one in the Metropolitan. He collected bronzes as well as marble figures; a cast of a stone original of Apollo and Daphne by Bernini, dating from around 1617, stands in the Doge&#x27;s suite.

In addition to his classical sculptures, Hearst was content to acquire 19th century versions, or contemporary copies of ancient works; &quot;if we cannot find the right thing in a classic statue we can find a modern one&quot;. He was a particular patron of Charles Cassou and also favored the early 19th century Danish sculptor Bertel Thorvaldsen whose &quot;Venus Victorious&quot; remains at the castle. Both this, and the genuinely classical &quot;Athena&quot; from the collection of Thomas Hope, were displayed in the Assembly room, along with the &quot;Venus Italica&quot; by Antonio Canova. Other works by Thorvaldsen include the four large marble medallions in the Assembly room depicting society&#x27;s virtues. Two 19th century marbles are in the anteroom to the Assembly room, &quot;Bacchante&quot;, by Frederick William MacMonnies, a copy of his bronze original and &quot;Pygmalion and Galatea&quot; by Gérôme. A monumental statue of &quot;Galatea&quot;, attributed to Leopoldo Ansiglioni and dating from around 1882, stands in the center of the pool on the plaza in front of Casa Grande.

=== Textiles ===
Tapestries include the Scipio set after Giulio Romano in the assembly room, two from a set telling the Biblical story of Daniel in the morning room, and the millefleur hunting scene in the Billiard room. The last is particularly rare, one of only &quot;a handful from this period in the world&quot;. Hearst also assembled and displayed an important collection of Navajo textiles at San Simeon, including blankets, rugs and serapes. Most were purchased from Herman Schweizer, who ran the Indian Department of the Fred Harvey Company. Originally gathered at Hearst&#x27;s hacienda at Jolon, they were moved to Wyntoon in 1940 before being brought to San Simeon and finally being donated to the Los Angeles County Museum of Art in 1942. Hearst was always interested in pieces that had historical and cultural connections to the history of California and Central and Latin America; the North Wing contains two Peruvian armorial banners. Dating from the 1580s, they show the shields of Don Luis Jerónimo Fernández Cabrera y Bobadilla, Count of Chinchón and viceroy of Peru. Nathaniel Burt, the composer and critic evaluated the collections at San Simeon thus; &quot;Far from being the mere kitsch that most easterners have been led to believe, [San Simeon is] full of real beauties and treasures&quot;.

=== Paintings ===
The art collection includes works by Tintoretto, whose portrait of Alvisius Vendramin hangs in the Doge&#x27;s suite, Franz Xaver Winterhalter who carried out the double portraits of Maximilian I of Mexico and his empress Carlota, located in Casa del Mar and two portraits of Napoléon by Jean-Léon Gérôme. Hearst&#x27;s earliest painting, a &quot;Madonna and Child&quot; from the school of Duccio di Buoninsegna, dates from the early 14th century. A gift from his friend, the editor Cissy Patterson, the painting hangs in Hearst&#x27;s bedroom. &quot;Portrait of a Woman&quot;, by Giulio Campi, hangs in a bedroom in the north wing. In 1928 Hearst acquired the &quot;Madonna and Child with Two Angels&quot;, by Adriaen Isenbrandt. The curator Taylor Coffman describes this work, which hangs in the Casa del Mar sitting room, as perhaps &quot;San Simeon&#x27;s finest painting&quot;. In 2018, a previously unattributed &quot;Annunciation&quot; in the assembly room was identified as a work of 1690 by Bartolomé Pérez.

== Gardens and grounds ==
The Esplanade, a curving, paved walkway, connects the main house with the guest cottages; Hearst described it as giving &quot;a finished touch to the big house, to frame it in, as it were&quot;. Morgan designed the pedestrianized pavement with great care, to create a &quot;&quot; for guests, desiring &quot;a strikingly noble and saississant effect be impressed upon everyone on arrival&quot;. Hearst concurred: &quot;Heartily approve. I certainly want that saississant effect. I don&#x27;t know what it is but I think we ought to have at least one such on the premises&quot;. A feature of the gardens are the lampposts topped with alabaster globes; modeled on &quot;janiform hermae&quot;, the concept was Hearst&#x27;s. The Swan lamps, remodeled with alabaster globe lights to match the hermae, were designed by Morgan&#x27;s chief draftsman, Thaddeus Joy. Others whose ideas and approach influenced Hearst and Morgan in their landscaping include Charles Adams Platt, an artist and gardener who had made a particular study of the layout and planting of Italian villas; Nigel Keep, Hearst&#x27;s orchardman, who worked at San Simeon from 1922 to 1947, and Albert Webb, Hearst&#x27;s English head gardener who was at the hill during 1922–1948.

=== Neptune Pool ===

The Neptune pool, described by Ginger Wadsworth in her biography of Morgan as &quot;the most sumptuous swimming pool on earth&quot;, is located near the edge of the hilltop and is enclosed by a retaining wall and underpinned by a framework of concrete struts to allow for movement in the event of earthquakes. The pool is often cited as an example of Hearst&#x27;s changeability; it was reconstructed three times before he was finally satisfied. Originally begun as an ornamental pond, it was first expanded in 1924 as Millicent Hearst desired a swimming pool. It was enlarged again during 1926–1928 to accommodate Cassou&#x27;s statuary. Finally, in 1934, it was extended again to act as a setting for a Roman temple, in part original and in part comprising elements from other structures which Hearst transported from Europe and had reconstructed at the site. The tiling was undertaken by Solon and Schemmel.

The pool holds 345,000 gallons of water and is equipped with seventeen shower and changing rooms. It was heated by oil-fired burners. In early 2014, the pool was drained due to drought conditions and leakage. After a long-term restoration project to fix the leaking, the pool was refilled in August 2018. The restoration of the pool was recognized with a Preservation Design Award for Craftsmanship from the California Preservation Foundation in 2019. The pool is well-supplied with sculpture, particularly works by Charles Cassou. His centerpiece, opposite the Roman temple, is &quot;The Birth of Venus&quot;. An even larger sculptural grouping, depicting Neptune in a chariot drawn by four horses, was commissioned to fill the empty basin above the Venus. Although carved, it was never installed.

=== Roman Pool ===
The Roman pool, constructed under the tennis courts, provided an indoor alternative to the Neptune pool. Originally mooted by Hearst in 1927, construction did not begin until 1930 and the pool was not completed until 1935. Hearst initially wanted the pool to be fed by salt-water but the design challenges proved to be insuperable. A disastrous attempt to fulfill Hearst&#x27;s desires by pouring 20 tons of washed rock salt into the pool saw the disintegration of the cast-iron heat exchanger and pump. Inspiration for the mosaic decoration came from the Mausoleum of Galla Placidia in Ravenna. The tiles are of Murano glass, with gold-leaf, and were designed by Solon and manufactured in San Francisco. Although a pool of &quot;spectacular beauty&quot;, it was little used being located in a less-visited part of the complex.

=== Pergola and zoo ===

Two other major features of the grounds were the pergola and the zoo. The pergola, an ornamental bridleway, runs to the west of Casa Grande. Comprising concrete columns, covered in espaliered fruit trees, Morgan ensured that it was built to a height sufficient to allow Hearst, &quot;a tall man with a tall hat on a tall horse&quot;, to ride unimpeded down its mile-long length. Plans for a zoo, to house Hearst&#x27;s large collection of wild animals, were drawn up by Morgan and included an elephant house and separate enclosures for antelopes, camels, zebras and bears. This was never constructed, but a range of shelters and pits were built, sited on Orchard Hill.

== Estate ==
Hearst Castle is located near the town of San Simeon, California, approximately from both Los Angeles and San Francisco, and from San Luis Obispo at the northern end of San Luis Obispo County. The estate itself is five miles (eight km) inland atop a hill of the Santa Lucia Range at an altitude of . The region is sparsely populated because the Santa Lucia Range abuts the Pacific Ocean, which provides dramatic vistas but offers few opportunities for development and hampers transportation. The surrounding countryside remains largely undeveloped. The castle&#x27;s entrance is approximately five miles north of Hearst San Simeon State Park.

At the height of Hearst&#x27;s ownership, the estate totaled more than 250,000 acres. W. C. Fields commented on the extent of the estate while on a visit; &quot;Wonderful place to bring up children. You can send them out to play. They won&#x27;t come back till they&#x27;re grown&quot;. The gardens and terraces immediately surrounding the castle total roughly 22 acres (88305 sqm), [see plan]. Some 23 miles to the north of the castle, Morgan constructed the Milpitas Hacienda, a ranchhouse that acted as a trianon to the main estate, and as a focus for riding expeditions. In 1957, the castle and its contents, with 120 acres of the gardens, were transferred to the guardianship of the California State Parks Department. In 2005, the wider setting for the castle was protected by a conservation arrangement between the department, American Land Conservancy and the Hearst Corporation which aimed to preserve the undeveloped character of the coast. Years earlier, the writer Henry Miller had described the Big Sur area as &quot;the California that men dreamed of ... the face of the earth as the Creator intended it to look&quot;. Miller&#x27;s comment echoes an earlier observation on San Simeon made by Bernard Shaw; &quot;This is what God would have built if he had had the money&quot;. The agreement reached between the state and the family has not been without controversy. The deal, which saw the Hearst family receive $80 million in cash together with $15 million in state tax credits in exchange for ceding development rights on the majority of the estate, has been criticized as being too generous to the Hearsts, and for restricting public access to the estate. The deal&#x27;s sponsors disagreed, Mike Chrisman, California&#x27;s then Secretary for Resources, describing the agreement as &quot;a landmark effort ... and a big deal for the state, for Hearst Corp. and the family and the public&quot;.

== Appreciation ==
As with Hearst himself, Hearst Castle and its collections have been the subject of considerable criticism. From the 1940s the view of Hearst and Morgan&#x27;s most important joint creation as the phantasmagorical Xanadu of Orson Welles&#x27;s imagination has been commonplace. Although some literary depictions were gently mocking; P. G. Wodehouse&#x27;s novel of 1953, &quot;Ring for Jeeves&quot;, published in America in 1954 as &quot;The Return of Jeeves&quot;, has a character describe her stay, &quot;I remember visiting at San Simeon once, and there was a whole French Abbey lying on the grass&quot;; others were not. John Steinbeck&#x27;s unnamed description was certainly of Hearst; &quot;They&#x27;s a fella, newspaper fella near the coast, got a million acres. Fat, sof&#x27; fella with little mean eyes an&#x27; a mouth like a ass-hole&quot;. The writer John Dos Passos went further, explicitly referencing Hearst in the third volume of his 1938 &quot;U.S.A&quot; trilogy. &quot;The emperor of newsprint retired to his fief of San Simeon where he built an Andalusian palace and there spends his last years amid the relaxing adulations of screenstars, admen, screenwriters, publicity-men, columnists, Until he dies, a spent Caesar grown old with spending.&quot; The English architectural writer Clive Aslet was little more complimentary about the castle. Disliking its &quot;unsympathetic texture (of) poured concrete&quot;, he described it as &quot;best seen from a distance&quot;. The unfinished, and unresolved, rear façade of Casa Grande has been the subject of particular negative comment; Carleton Winslow and Nicola Frye, in their history from 1980, suggest the flanking north and south wings &quot;compete rather disastrously&quot; with the central doge&#x27;s suite block. Others questioned the castle&#x27;s very existence; the architect Witold Rybczynski asking, &quot;what is this Italian villa doing on the Californian Coastal Range? ... a costly piece of theatrical décor that ignores its context (and) lacks meaning&quot;. Hearst&#x27;s collections were similarly disparaged, the art historian William George Constable echoed Joseph Duveen when he assessed Hearst as &quot;not a collector but a gigantic and voracious magpie&quot;.

Later decades after Hearst&#x27;s death have seen a more sympathetic and appreciative evaluation of his collections, and the estate he and Morgan created to house them. The director of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Thomas Hoving, although listing Hearst only at number 83 in his evaluation of America&#x27;s top 101 art collectors, wrote, &quot;Hearst is being reevaluated. He may have been much more of a collector than was thought at the time of his death&quot;. The curator Mary Levkoff, in her 2008 study, &quot;Hearst the Collector&quot;, contends that he was, describing the four separate &quot;staggeringly important&quot; collections of antique vases, tapestries, armor and silver which Hearst brought together, and writing of the challenge of bringing their artistic merit to light from under the shadow of his own reputation. Of Morgan&#x27;s building, its stock has risen with the re-evaluation of her standing and accomplishments, which saw her inducted into the California Hall of Fame in 2008, become the first woman to receive the American Institute of Architects Gold Medal in 2014, and to have an obituary in &quot;The New York Times&quot; as recently as 2019. The writer John Julius Norwich recorded his personal recantation after a visit to the castle; &quot;I went prepared to mock; I remained to marvel. Hearst Castle (is) a palace in every sense of the word&quot;. Victoria Kastner, for many years the in-house historian of Hearst Castle and author of a number of books on its design and history, concludes her history of the castle with an assessment of San Simeon as &quot;the quintessential twentieth-century American country house&quot;.

<doc id="366563" wikidata="Q1342970" url="?curid=366563" title="Ferula">
<text>Ferula (from Latin &quot;ferula&quot; ) is a genus of about 220 species of flowering plants in the family Apiaceae, native to the Mediterranean region east to central Asia, mostly growing in arid climates. Many plants of this genus, especially &quot;F. communis&quot;, are referred to as &quot;giant fennel&quot;, although they are not fennel in the strict sense. 

==Description==

They are herbaceous perennial plants growing to 1–4 m tall, with stout, hollow, somewhat succulent stems. The leaves are tripinnate or even more finely divided, with a stout basal sheath clasping the stem. The basal sheaths of &quot;Ferula oopoda&quot;, for example, are up to six inches (15 cm) long and form a cup holding about a cup of rainwater. The flowers are usually yellow, rarely white, produced in large umbels. 

==Selected species==

==Uses==

The Roman spice laserpicium probably came from a species of &quot;Ferula&quot;, either an extinct one or &quot;Ferula tingitana&quot;, though other identities have been suggested. The Romans called the hollow light rod made from this plant a &quot;ferula&quot; (compare also fasces, judicial birches). Such rods were used for walking sticks, splints, for stirring boiling liquids, and for corporal punishment.

The gummy resin of many species of &quot;Ferula&quot; is used for various purposes:
*&quot;Ferula foetida&quot;, &quot;Ferula assa-foetida&quot; and some other species are used to make the spice asafoetida, or &quot;hing&quot;
*&quot;Ferula gummosa&quot; makes galbanum
*&quot;Ferula hermonis&quot; makes zallouh
*&quot;Ferula moschata&quot; makes sumbul
*&quot;Ferula persica&quot; or &quot;F. szowitziana&quot; makes sagapenum
*&quot;Ferula marmarica&quot; makes &quot;Cyrenaican ammoniacum&quot;
*&quot;Ferula ammoniacum&quot; makes &quot;Persian ammoniacum&quot;
*&quot;Ferula communis&quot; subsp. &quot;brevifolia&quot; makes &quot;Moroccan ammoniacum&quot;

<doc id="366567" wikidata="Q316874" url="?curid=366567" title="Dagobert II">
<text>Dagobert II (; ; died 679) was a Merovingian king of the Franks, ruling in Austrasia from 675 or 676 until his death. He is one of the more obscure Merovingians. He has been considered a martyr since at least the ninth century.

None of the narrative histories of the Merovingian period give an account of Dagobert&#x27;s reign, which must be reconstructed from several different sources. Upon the death of his father in 656, he was deprived of the succession and exiled to Ireland to live as a monk. His return to Austrasia was arranged by Wilfrid, bishop of York. 

He ascended the throne during the civil war caused by the assassination of Childeric II in 675. During his brief reign, he was at war with Neustria, signed a peace treaty with the Lombard Kingdom in Italy and reintroduced gold coinage.

The near-contemporary &quot;Life of Wilfrid&quot; portrays Dagobert as a tyrant who antagonized the bishops and imposed new taxes. He was assassinated by a conspiracy of the highest nobility and was succeeded by his cousin, Theuderic III, king of Neustria, against whom he had previously warred.

==Exile==
Dagobert was the son of Sigebert III (ruled 632–51/6) and an unknown woman. It is unlikely that he was a son of Sigebert&#x27;s only known wife, Chimnechild, who survived him. He was thus the half-brother of Bilichild, Chimnechild&#x27;s daughter by Sigebert. He was named for his grandfather, Dagobert I (623–639).

According to the &quot;Book of the History of the Franks&quot;, which dates to 727, after Sigebert&#x27;s death, Grimoald, the mayor of the palace and the most powerful official under the king, arranged for Dagobert to be tonsured and placed in the custody of Dido, bishop of Poitiers. Tonsuring rendered Dagobert unfit for the throne since Merovingian kings always wore their hair long. Dido then sent Dagobert to Ireland. The dating of these events is uncertain. They are usually placed in 656, but a date as early as 651 has also been proposed.

No contemporary source describes Dagobert&#x27;s time in Ireland. The eighteenth-century antiquary Mervyn Archdall was the first to record the association of Dagobert with a specific place in Ireland. He wrote that a local oral tradition current at that time put Dagobert in the monastery of Slane, a conclusion accepted by some modern scholars.

Grimoald placed his son, Childebert, on the Austrasian throne, but the Neustrians under Clovis II (639–657) had Grimoald arrested and brought to Paris, where he was executed &quot;because he had acted against his lord&quot;, that is, the rightful Merovingian claimant. Clovis&#x27;s second son, Childeric II, who was still a minor, was placed on the Austrasian throne in 662. He was married to Bilichild, Dagobert&#x27;s half-sister, and placed under the regency of Chimnechild. He was assassinated, along with his queen and his son, in 675.

The murder of Childeric provided the occasion for Dagobert&#x27;s return, but its immediate result was a civil war. The former mayor of the palace, Ebroin, declared a certain Clovis III, son of the Neustrian king Chlothar III (658–673), as king in Austrasia, while Clovis II&#x27;s third son, Theuderic III, was placed on the Neustrian throne by Leodegar. After Leodegar&#x27;s capture, Ebroin abandoned Clovis for Theuderic, and in so doing lost his Austrasian allies. In this situation, Dagobert was recalled from his Irish exile.

==Return from exile==
While the &quot;Book of the History of the Franks&quot; is the only source to describe the circumstances of Dagobert&#x27;s exile, the &quot;Life of Wilfrid&quot; is the only one to describe his return. This biography of the English bishop Wilfrid was composed in the first decades of the eighth century by Stephen of Ripon. According to Stephen, Dagobert was exiled to Ireland &quot;in his youth&quot; and when his friends and relatives later learned that he was still living they asked Wilfrid to bring him to England and from there send him on to Austrasia.

The &quot;Life of Wilfrid&quot; does not specify who was responsible for recalling Dagobert, only that it was &quot;friends&quot; (&quot;amici&quot;) and &quot;relatives&quot; (&quot;proximi&quot;). The relatives may have been on his mother&#x27;s side. There is little consensus on who the friends could have been, possibly Wulfoald, the mayor of the palace under Childeric II or Pippin of Herstal and Martin of Laon, who came to power, according to the &quot;Book of the History of the Franks&quot;, after &quot;the deaths of kings&quot;, perhaps in 675; or even Ultan, abbot of Saint-Maur-des-Fossés, who was Irish himself and had connections in Ireland.

The exact date of Dagobert&#x27;s accession is not known. Childeric II was killed in 675 and Dagobert was on the throne by July 676.

==Reign==

Dagobert&#x27;s reign is sparsely recorded. The &quot;Book of the History of the Franks&quot;, which has a Neustrian perspective, does not mention him again after describing his exile. The historian Richard Gerberding says of the &quot;History&quot;&#x27;s author, &quot;Either he did not believe that Dagobert had returned to become king or he did not want us to know of it&quot;. Paul Fouracre suggests that he did not regard Dagobert as a legitimate king, either because he had not been chosen with the support of the Neustrians; because he was considered a foreigner after his long exile; or because he was not considered throneworthy on account of the circumstances of his birth, his mother having been a concubine.

Only one seventh-century work from within the Merovingian kingdoms, the &quot;Life of Abbess Sadalberga of Laon&quot;, mentions the reign of Dagobert, and then only in passing. It records that Sadalberga moved her convent from the suburbs of Langres in northern Burgundy to the city of Laon because of forebodings, later proven true by &quot;recent fighting between Kings Dagobert and Theuderic&quot;. This is the only mention of a war between Dagobert and his first cousin, Theuderic III of Neustria. It is an indication of the continuing animosity between Ebroin and the Austrasians, although it may have begun as a border dispute in the Champagne.

That the war was waged deep in Burgundy, which was under Neustrian rule, suggests that Dagobert for a time had the initiative. It may be during this war that Pippin and Martin launched the attack on Theuderic III that was defeated by Ebroin at the famous Battle of Lucofao, resulting in Martin&#x27;s death. While this battle may have taken place after Dagobert&#x27;s death, a more likely date is September 679, when Dagobert was still alive and able to issue orders for the raising of levies. The war mentioned in the &quot;Life of Sadalberga&quot;, however, cannot be dated precisely. It may have ended as early as September 677.

In 676, Dagobert signed a &quot;most firm pact of peace&quot; with the Lombards. This event can be dated precisely because the only other source for it, the &quot;History of the Lombards&quot; written by Paul the Deacon towards the end of the eighth century, reports the appearance of a comet in August the same year. This comet was widely reported across the world from Ireland to Japan. Paul, however, mistakenly places the pact in the reign of the Lombard king Grimoald, who died in 671, before Dagobert had even returned from Ireland. The Lombard king at the time of the comet was actually Perctarit.

The only surviving authentic charter issued by Dagobert confirms the possessions of the monastery of Stavelot-Malmedy. In the charter, Dagobert refers to the donations made by his father, but does not mention that the monastery was founded by Grimoald, the man who had exiled him.

Dagobert reintroduced the minting of gold, which had apparently been suspended by Childeric II around 670. His gold &quot;tremissis&quot; broke with the old Frankish style and copied the cross potent on three steps of contemporary Byzantine &quot;solidi&quot;. Dagobert was also the last king in whose name coins were struck in Marseille. The important royal coinage of Marseille, lasting from 613 until 679, was always struck with the name of a king, which was unusual since Frankish coins typically contain only the names of the moneyer and the mint.

In 679, while on his way to Rome to attend a church council, Wilfrid stayed at the court of Dagobert, who was grateful to the bishop for having facilitated his return from Ireland. Dagobert offered to appoint Wilfrid to the diocese of Strasbourg, which the &quot;Life of Wilfrid&quot; calls the &quot;chief bishopric of his realm&quot;, but Wilfrid declined. Dagobert provided him with arms and companions for the rest of his journey to Rome. In Italy, Wilfrid stayed for a time at the court of Dagobert&#x27;s new ally, Perctarit.

In late 679, shortly after Wilfrid&#x27;s visit, Dagobert was assassinated. The &quot;Life of Wilfrid&quot; claims that this was engineered by &quot;treacherous dukes&quot; with the consent of the bishops. According to a late tradition, he was killed by his own godson, John, while hunting in the Woëvre. The traditional date of his death, 23 December, is likewise based on late sources but widely accepted.

Following Dagobert&#x27;s death, Ebroin managed to extend Theuderic III&#x27;s authority over Austrasia. On Wilfrid&#x27;s return trip through Austrasia in 680, he was arrested by Ebroin&#x27;s men, who blamed him for having arranged Dagobert&#x27;s return. According to the report in the &quot;Life of Wilfrid&quot;, Dagobert was a &quot;destroyer of cities, despising the counsels of the magnates, reducing the people with taxation ... being contemptuous of God&#x27;s churches and their bishops.&quot; It is possible that the reference to the destruction of cities refers to Dagobert&#x27;s failure to protect them when Ebroin devastated the land after his victory at Lucofao.

==Martyr cult==

The &quot;Life of Wilfrid&quot; is the only source to record Dagobert&#x27;s assassination, but some corroboration comes from the fact that he was revered as a martyr in the Ardennes region before the end of the ninth century.

There are conflicting claims about where Dagobert was buried. According to the &quot;Life&quot; of Bishop Audoin of Rouen, written in the early eighth century, Dagobert was buried in the church of Saint Peter in Rouen alongside his predecessor, Childeric II, and Childeric&#x27;s queen, Bilichild, and infant son, also named Dagobert. This source refers to the &quot;Dagobert whom Grimoald tonsured&quot; without mentioning his exile, return or reign.

The &quot;Life of Dagobert&quot;, on the other hand, says that Dagobert was buried at Stenay in the church dedicated to Saint Remigius. This is not implausible, since Stenay was in the centre of Austrasia. The source, however, dates to the 890s and confuses Dagobert II and Dagobert III (711–715), who died of illness.

In 872, the cult of Dagobert was brought to life (or revived) by Charles the Bald, king of West Francia (840–877), who had his relics translated to a specially built basilica in Stenay staffed with its own canons. The timing seems to indicate that Charles was trying to establish himself in that part of Lotharingia that he had only acquired in 870 by the Treaty of Meerssen. The translation of the relics is mentioned in the &quot;Life of Dagobert&quot; and in a charter preserved in the cartulary of the Abbey of Gorze, which provides the date.

The endowment of the Basilica of Saint Dagobert is known from a charter of 1124, also in the cartulary of Gorze. The endowment had passed at some point to Beatrice, wife of Godfrey III, Duke of Lower Lorraine, who in 1069 left it to the abbey of Gorze. The canons having grown lax, the monks turned it into a Benedictine priory.

Dagobert&#x27;s feast day was 23 December. This day is given in the &quot;Life of Dagobert&quot;; in the now lost calendar of saints made for Emma, wife of King Lothair of France (954–986); and in the &quot;auctaria&quot; (local additions) to the Martyrology of Usuard from the area of modern Belgium. One &quot;auctarium&quot;, however, places his feast on 11 September. A Liège manuscript of the martyrology of Ado of Vienne also places Dagobert&#x27;s death on 23 December.

Dagobert&#x27;s festival was never widespread outside of Stenay. Generally, it became associated with places associated with Dagobert I. It was still being celebrated at Verdun as late as the sixteenth century. The prior of Stenay was suppressed in 1580 and in 1591 the buildings were sacked by Protestants. Dagobert&#x27;s relics were dispersed, with some ending up in Saint-Ghislain.

<text>Silphium is a genus of North American plants in the tribe Heliantheae within the family Asteraceae.

Members of the genus, commonly known as rosinweeds, are herbaceous perennial plants growing to to more than tall, with yellow (rarely white) flowerheads that resemble sunflowers. In the rosinweeds, the ray florets in the head are female and the disc florets are male; this differs from sunflowers, where ray florets are sterile and disc florets are perfect, capable of producing both pollen and seeds.

The name of the genus comes from the Ancient Greek word for a North African plant whose identity has been lost, though it is known its gum or juice was prized by the ancients as a medicine and a condiment.

<text>The Columbia Center or Columbia Tower, formerly named the Bank of America Tower and Columbia Seafirst Center, is a skyscraper in downtown Seattle, Washington, United States. The 76-story structure is the tallest building in the state of Washington, reaching a height of . At the time of its completion in 1985, the Columbia Center was the tallest structure on the West Coast; , it is the fourth-tallest, behind buildings in Los Angeles and San Francisco.

The Columbia Center, developed by Martin Selig and designed by Chester L. Lindsey Architects, began construction in 1982 and was completed in 1985. The building is primarily leased for class-A office spaces by various companies, with the lower floors including retail space and the upper floors featuring a public observatory and private club lounge. The tower has the highest public viewing area west of the Mississippi River. It occupies most of the block bounded by Fourth and Fifth Avenues and Cherry and Columbia Streets.

==Design==
Columbia Center was designed by Washington architect Chester L. Lindsey. The base of the building is clad in Rosa Purino Carnelian granite. The building&#x27;s structure is composed of three geometric concave facades with two setbacks, causing the building to appear like three towers standing side by side.

Ground level elevation on the Fifth Avenue side of the building is higher than on the Fourth Avenue side; the part of Cherry Street it faces was identified as one of the steepest streets in the Central Business District with a slope of 17.1%. The tower was originally designed to be about , but federal regulations by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) would not allow it to be that tall so close to the nearby Sea-Tac Airport. Although city land use regulations at the time were intended to limit skyscrapers to about 50 stories, the developer, Martin Selig, obtained the necessary permits for a 76-story skyscraper due to a part of the law that allowed bonus height for providing retail space with street access. Because three separate stories could access the street on the sloped site, the developers were allowed a bonus for each of the three stories they set aside for retail, which was reportedly an unintended loophole in the law. There is an observation deck on the 73rd floor which offers views of Seattle and environs. The top two floors of the building (75th and 76th) are occupied by the private Columbia Tower Club, which houses a restaurant, bar, library, and meeting rooms. An underground concourse connects the building to the nearby Seattle Municipal Tower and Bank of America Fifth Avenue Plaza.

The tower, originally proposed as Columbia Center, opened under the name Columbia Seafirst Center after its largest tenant and financier, Seafirst Bank, and then changed to the Bank of America Tower, when Seafirst, which had been owned by Bank of America since 1983, was fully integrated into Bank of America. That name gave it the nickname &quot;BOAT&quot; (Bank of America Tower). In November 2005, the building&#x27;s name was changed back to Columbia Center after the bank reduced its presence in the building. Bank of America still maintains office space within the building, but has since closed the bank branch at the base of the tower.

==History==

===Development and construction===
Martin Selig, a local real estate developer who had recently opened the Fourth and Blanchard Building, announced plans for a 75-story office building at 4th Avenue and Columbia Street in October 1980. The $120 million project, named the &quot;Columbia Center&quot;, would be funded by the Seafirst Mortgage Company and constructed by Howard S. Wright. Selig borrowed $205 million in 1981 to develop the property. The Columbia Seafirst Center, as it came to be known, was constructed by Howard S. Wright starting in 1982 with a deep excavation hole that required of dirt and soil to be removed. This was one of the largest foundations for a building in Seattle along with concrete footings extending below street level. While the structural steel of the building was built at a rate of 2 floors per week, the building itself was completed on January 12, 1985, and opened on March 2 of that same year. U.S. Steel Corporation was contracted to provide of steel for construction. It was approximately 50% taller than the previous tallest skyscraper in Seattle, the Seattle First National Bank Building (now Safeco Plaza) that opened in 1969.

===Financial issues and height controversy===
Selig continued to own and manage the building until 1989 when financial problems forced him to sell it to Seafirst Corporation for $354 million. Management was taken over by the Tishman West Company of Los Angeles.

Controversy regarding the skyscraper&#x27;s size contributed to the passage of a 1989 law called the Citizen&#x27;s Alternative Plan (CAP) that enforced more stringent restrictions on the size of buildings in Downtown Seattle. In 1990, after rejecting earlier plans for antennas, Seattle and the FAA granted permission to erect two antennas on top of Columbia Center, which were expected to be used for broadcasting radio and television throughout the region. Though the FAA was originally worried about the tower&#x27;s height encroaching the airspace, they deemed the addition of the antennas not problematic. The antennas were not built before the permits expired in 1994, however.

===Ownership changes===

EQ Office bought Columbia Center from Seafirst in 1998 for $404 million. The New York State Common Retirement Fund bought a 49.9% stake in the building and then several years later sold its share back to EQ Office. In 2007, Columbia Center was sold by EQ Office to Boston-based Beacon Capital Partners for $621 million; Beacon later defaulted on a loan in 2010, the height of the Great Recession, at a time when vacancies reached 40%. On August 7, 2015, Hong Kong-based Gaw Capital Partners purchased the building for $711 million.

===Renovations===
On July 1, 2013, the Columbia Center&#x27;s observation deck, known as the Sky View, was remodeled from 270 degrees to a 360-degree viewing area. The observation deck underwent further renovations in 2018, adding two express elevators and a new lounge. The 4th Avenue entrance was also renovated.

===September 11 attacks===
On June 16, 2004, the 9/11 Commission reported that the original plan for the September 11 attacks called for the hijacking of 10 planes, to be crashed into targets including the &quot;tallest buildings in California and Washington state,&quot; which would have been the Columbia Center and the U.S. Bank Tower in Los Angeles, respectively. However, the attacks occurred in Washington, D.C.; New York City; and Shanksville, Pennsylvania, instead.

==Events==
Columbia Center plays host to the largest on-air firefighter competition in the world, the LLS Firefighter Stairclimb. About 2,000 firefighters from around the world yearly make the trek up 69 floors and 1,311 steps in full structural turnout gear while on air. This event benefits the Washington/Alaska chapter of the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society.

Big Climb is the sister event to the LLS Firefighter Stairclimb. About 6,000 participants race and climb to the top of Columbia Center, raising more than $3 million for the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society. This event is open to the public and anyone 8 years of age or older can participate.

<text>Edward King Gaylord (March 5, 1873 – May 30, 1974), often referred to as E.K. Gaylord, was the owner and publisher of &quot;The Daily Oklahoman&quot; newspaper (now &quot;The Oklahoman&quot;), as well as a radio and television entrepreneur. A native of Kansas and educated in Colorado, he worked on several publications before moving to Oklahoma and buying an interest in &quot;The Daily Oklahoman&quot;. He built the publication into a statewide newspaper and took over its parent company, the Oklahoma Publishing Company (OPUBCO), in 1918.

After his death in 1974, Gaylord&#x27;s family continued to run the newspaper until OPUBCO was sold to The Anschutz Corporation in 2011.

==Early life and career==
Born on a farm near Muscotah in Atchison County, in eastern Kansas, Gaylord attended Colorado College in Colorado Springs, Colorado. His older brother, Lewis, talked him into buying the &quot;Colorado Springs Telegraph&quot; and later got him to work as the business manager of the &quot;St. Joseph Dispatch&quot; in Missouri.

==Oklahoma==
Gaylord came to Oklahoma City in December 1902 and bought an interest in &quot;The Daily Oklahoman&quot;, which had been founded in 1889. He became the paper&#x27;s business manager in January 1903. Gaylord married Inez Kinney of New York City in 1914. In 1918, he became president of OPUBCO, the newspaper&#x27;s parent company.

He built &quot;The Daily Oklahoman&quot; into a statewide newspaper, took part in the statehood movement, and was responsible for building a small experimental radio operation into the state&#x27;s first major radio station, WKY. He also established the state&#x27;s first television station, WKY-TV.

Gaylord died of a heart attack at his Oklahoma City home on May 30, 1974.

==Gaylord family==
Gaylord&#x27;s daughter, Edith Kinney Gaylord, enjoyed a storied career as a journalist before devoting her life to charitable giving. In 1982, she founded both Inasmuch Foundation and Ethics and Excellence in Journalism Foundation (EEJF) to carry out her giving. In 2014, the corporate entities merged and EEJF became a wholly owned subsidiary of Inasmuch Foundation.

His son, Edward Gaylord, inherited controlling interest but not complete ownership of &quot;The Daily Oklahoman&quot; and other family assets worth $50 million in 1974. Educated in business at Stanford University, Edward L. increased the family fortune by a factor of forty, to $2 billion at his death in 2003. The younger Gaylord purchased the Grand Ole Opry in Nashville, Tennessee. He also created the cable television channels The Nashville Network (TNN) and Country Music Television (CMT).

&quot;The Daily Oklahoman&quot; newspaper, renamed &quot;The Oklahoman&quot; in 2003, remained owned by the Gaylord family until the sale to Anschutz. Although a respected newspaper during E.K. Gaylord&#x27;s tenure, it became unabashedly partisan after Edward L. became its publisher; in Oklahoma some critics would satirize the paper as &quot;The Daily Disappointment,&quot; and the &quot;Columbia Journalism Review&quot; dubbed it &quot;The Worst Newspaper in America&quot; in 1999.

From Edward L.&#x27;s death until the 2011 sale, the newspaper was led by his daughter Christy Gaylord Everest. She led a major visual modernizing of the newspaper and was assisted in its operation by her sister, Louise Gaylord Bennett.

The Gaylord family have frequently provided selected philanthropic contributions, including major support to the National Cowboy Hall of Fame in Oklahoma City, and have given the University of Oklahoma contributions totaling over $50 million, resulting in a large proportion of the buildings on campus being named after one family member or another. They provided seed money for the university&#x27;s Gaylord College of Journalism and Mass Communication, which then constructed a new facility thanks in a large part to Gaylord donations.

<text>Æthelthryth (or Æðelþryð or Æþelðryþe; 23 June 679) was an East Anglian princess, a Fenland and Northumbrian queen and Abbess of Ely. She is an Anglo-Saxon saint, and is also known as Etheldreda or Audrey, especially in religious contexts. She was a daughter of Anna, King of East Anglia, and her siblings were Wendreda and Seaxburh of Ely, both of whom eventually retired from secular life and founded abbeys.

== Life ==
Æthelthryth was probably born in Exning, near Newmarket in Suffolk. She was one of the four saintly daughters of Anna of East Anglia, including Wendreda and Seaxburh of Ely, all of whom eventually retired from secular life and founded abbeys.

Æthelthryth made an early first marriage in around 652 to Tondberct, chief or prince of the South Gyrwe. She managed to persuade her husband to respect her vow of perpetual virginity that she had made prior to their marriage. Upon his death in 655, she retired to the Isle of Ely, which she had received from Tondberct as a morning gift.

Æthelthryth was subsequently remarried for political reasons in 660, this time to Ecgfrith of Northumbria, who was fourteen or fifteen at the time. Shortly after his accession to the throne in 670, Æthelthryth wished to become a nun. This step possibly led to Ecgfrith&#x27;s long quarrel with Wilfrid, bishop of York, who was her spiritual counsellor. One account relates that while Ecgfrith initially agreed Æthelthryth should continue to remain a virgin, about 672 he appealed to Wilfrid for the enforcement of his marital rights as against Etheldreda&#x27;s religious vocation. The bishop succeeded at first in persuading the king to consent that Etheldreda should live for some time in peace as a sister of the Coldingham nunnery, founded by his aunt, Æbbe of Coldingham. Eventually, in light of the danger of being forcibly carried off by the king, Æthelthryth then fled back to the Isle of Ely with two nuns as companions. They managed to evade capture, thanks in part to the rising of the tide.

Another version of the legend related that she halted on the journey at &#x27;Stow&#x27; and sheltered under a miraculously growing ash tree which came from her staff planted in the ground. Stow came to be known as &#x27;St Etheldred&#x27;s Stow&#x27;, when a church was built to commemorate this event. It is more likely that this &#x27;Stow&#x27; actually refers to another fair, near Threekingham. Ecgfrith later married Eormenburg and expelled Wilfrid from his kingdom in 678. According to the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot;, Æthelthryth founded Ely Abbey, a double monastery at Ely in 673, which was later destroyed in the Danish invasion of 870.

== Death and burial ==
According to Bede, Æthelfryth died of a neck tumour, which she interpreted as sent by God in his goodness to relieve her of guilt for her vanity in having worn heavy necklaces in her youth. Bede states that after her death, her bones were disinterred by her sister and successor, Seaxburh and that her uncorrupted body was later buried in a white, marble coffin. In 695, Seaxburh translated the remains of her sister Æthelthryth, who had been dead for sixteen years, from a common grave to the new church at Ely. The &quot;Liber Eliensis&quot; describes these events in detail. When her grave was opened, Æthelthryth&#x27;s body was discovered to be uncorrupted and her coffin and clothes proved to possess miraculous powers. A sarcophagus made of white marble was taken from the Roman ruins at Grantchester, which was found to be the right fit for Æthelthryth. Seaxburh supervised the preparation of her sister&#x27;s body, which was washed and wrapped in new robes before being reburied. She apparently oversaw the translation of her sister&#x27;s remains without the supervision of her bishop, using her knowledge of procedures gained from her family&#x27;s links with the Faremoutiers Abbey as a basis for the ceremony.

After Seaxburh, Æthelthryth&#x27;s niece and her great-niece, both of whom were royal princesses, succeeded her as abbess of Ely.

==Legacy==
Etheldreda is remembered in the Church of England with a Lesser Festival on 17 October according to Book of Common Prayer tradition, and alternatively 23 June in the Common Worship calendar of Saints.

St Etheldreda&#x27;s Church in Ely Place in Holborn is dedicated to the saint. It was originally part of the London palace of the bishops of Ely. After the English Reformation, part was briefly used by a Spanish ambassador for Roman Catholic worship. The chapel was purchased by the Catholic Church in 1874 and is one of the oldest churches in England to be in current use by the Catholic Church.

St Etheldreda&#x27;s Church, Hatfield is 13th century and was originally Anglo-Saxon. It was named for St Etheldreda because it was adjacent to a palace of the Bishops of Ely who held her as their patron saint.

St Etheldreda&#x27;s is a Roman Catholic parish church in Ely, Cambridgeshire. It is part of the Diocese of East Anglia within the Province of Westminster. The church contains the shrine and relics of Æthelthryth, including her hand.

St Etheldreda&#x27;s Church in White Notley, Essex, is a Church of England parish church, of Anglo-Saxon construction, built on the site of a Roman temple, with a large quantity of Roman brick in its fabric. The church has a small Mediaeval English stained-glass window, depicting St Etheldreda, which is set in a stone frame made from a very early Insular Christian Roman Chi Rho grave marker.

The church of St Etheldreda Histon was demolished, it is commemorated in a stained glass window.

The common version of Æthelthryth&#x27;s name was St Audrey, which is the origin of the word &quot;&quot;, which derived from the fact that her admirers bought modestly concealing lace goods at an annual fair held in her name in Ely. By the 17th century, this lacework had become seen as old-fashioned, vain, or cheap and of poor quality, at a time when the Puritans of eastern England disdained ornamental dress.

== Hagiography ==
There are a number of accounts of Æthelthryth&#x27;s life in Latin, Old English, Old French, and Middle English. According to Jocelyn Wogan-Browne, &quot;more medieval vernacular lives [about Æthelthryth] were composed in England than any other native female saint&quot;. Æthelthryth appears in Bede&#x27;s &quot;Ecclesiastical History of the English People&quot;, Ælfric&#x27;s &quot;Lives of Saints&quot;, Goscelin of Saint-Bertin&#x27;s &quot;Lives of Female Saints&quot;, the &quot;Liber Eliensis&quot;, Marie de France&#x27;s &quot;La vie seinte Audree&quot;, the &quot;South English Legendary&quot;, and a Middle English life in BL Cotton Faustina B.iii, among others. A modern fictional account has been written by Moyra Caldecott.

<doc id="366589" wikidata="Q1081093" url="?curid=366589" title="Lithotomy position">
<text>The lithotomy position is a common position for surgical procedures and medical examinations involving the pelvis and lower abdomen, as well as a common position for childbirth in Western nations. The lithotomy position involves the positioning of an individual&#x27;s feet above or at the same level as the hips (often in stirrups), with the perineum positioned at the edge of an examination table. References to the position have been found in some of the oldest known medical documents including versions of the Hippocratic oath (see lithotomy); the position is named after the ancient surgical procedure for removing kidney stones and bladder stones via the perineum. The position is perhaps most recognizable as the &#x27;often used&#x27; position for childbirth: the patient is laid on the back with knees bent, positioned above the hips, and spread apart through the use of stirrups.

The position is frequently used and has many obvious benefits from the doctor&#x27;s perspective. Most notably the position provides good visual and physical access to the perineal region. The position is used for procedures ranging from simple pelvic exams to surgeries and procedures including those involving reproductive organs, urology, and gastrointestinal systems. New observations and scientific findings, combined with a greater sensitivity to patient needs have raised awareness of the physical and psychological risks the position may pose for prolonged surgical procedures, pelvic examinations, and, most notably, childbirth.

==Use for prolonged surgical procedures==
Some studies have found a significant relationship between prolonged surgical procedures with the patient in the lithotomy position and a circulatory complication known as compartment syndrome. Nerve injury by pressure is also possible, the femoral or peroneal nerve are at risk.

==Use for childbirth==
A Cochrane Review found that the lithotomy position may not be the ideal position for childbirth, noting that while it makes care easier for physicians by placing the patient in an easily accessible position, it is often harder on the patient as use of the lithotomy position can narrow the birth canal by up to a third. In lieu of the lithotomy position, the Cochrane Review recommended women make informed choices about birthing positions and find the position that is most comfortable for them.

==Use for pelvic examinations==
Patients have reported feeling a loss of control and increased sense of vulnerability when examined in the lithotomy position because they cannot see the area being examined. Other, equally effective positions have been suggested for examinations of conscious patients.

MacKay won the Distinguished Service Order in 1916 at the Battle of the Somme and in 1918 was seriously wounded at Arras. He left the military after the war but was involved in the formation of the Royal Canadian Legion in 1925 and was its first National Vice-Chairman. He was a freemason and was initiated in 1925 to Ionic Lodge, #25 G.R.C.

===Law and politics===
Known as J. Keiller MacKay, he was called to the Nova Scotia bar in 1922 and the Ontario bar in 1923. He was a senior partner in the law firm of MacKay, Matheson &amp; Martin in Toronto, and he became a specialist in criminal law. He was appointed a King&#x27;s Counsel in 1933. He was appointed to Ontario&#x27;s High Court of Justice (now the Ontario Superior Court of Justice) in 1935.

As a judge on the High Court, MacKay wrote the judgment in &quot;Re Drummond Wren&quot;, a landmark 1945 decision overturning an anti-Semitic restrictive covenant in Toronto. A local labour organization, the Workers&#x27; Education Association (WEA), had purchased a property on O&#x27;Connor Drive, east of Broadview Avenue in Toronto, for the purpose of building a model &quot;workingman&#x27;s home&quot;, offered as a potential solution to the city&#x27;s shortage of affordable housing. After buying the property, the WEA discovered there was a restrictive covenant on the deed preventing the land from being sold to &quot;Jews or persons of objectionable nationality&quot;. The WEA and the Canadian Jewish Congress launched a court action to strike down the restriction and in his decision, issued on October 31, 1945, Mackay declared the covenant illegal and &quot;injurious to the public good&quot;. Five years later, in March 1950, the Legislative Assembly of Ontario unanimously adopted legislation banning restrictive covenants, with Ontario Premier Leslie Frost declaring &quot;There is no place in Ontario&#x27;s way of life for restrictive covenants&quot;.

MacKay was appointed to the Court of Appeal for Ontario in 1950 and remained on the court until 1957, when he was named the lieutenant governor of Ontario. He served as lieutenant governor until 1963, and he opened the lieutenant governor&#x27;s New Year&#x27;s Levee to the general public for the first time.

In 1964, he was a founder of the Canadian Civil Liberties Association, serving as honorary president.

In 1967, he was made an Officer of the Order of Canada. He was also a Knight of Grace of the Venerable Order of St. John and was responsible for bringing the Order of Saint Lazarus to Canada in 1962.

==Personal life==
He was married to Katherine &quot;Kay&quot; Jean MacLeod and had three sons. He died in Toronto on June 12, 1970, and is buried in Mount Pleasant Cemetery, Toronto (section Q-154).

<doc id="366603" wikidata="Q838080" url="?curid=366603" title="Lake Natron">
<text>Lake Natron is a salt or alkaline lake located in north Ngorongoro District of Arusha Region in Tanzania at the border with Kenya. It is in the Gregory Rift, which is the eastern branch of the East African Rift. The lake is within the Lake Natron Basin, a Ramsar Site wetland of international significance. It is the only regular breeding area for Africa&#x27;s lesser flamingoes, although this habitat is not protected and is under threat from planned development projects.

== Description ==
This lake is fed principally by the Southern Ewaso Ng&#x27;iro River, which rises in central Kenya, and by mineral-rich hot springs. It is quite shallow, less than deep, and varies in width depending on its water level. The lake is a maximum of long and wide. The surrounding area receives irregular seasonal rainfall, mainly between December and May totalling per year. Temperatures at the lake are frequently above .

High levels of evaporation have left behind natron (sodium carbonate decahydrate) and trona (sodium sesquicarbonate dihydrate). The alkalinity of the lake can reach a pH of greater than 12. The surrounding bedrock is composed of alkaline, sodium-dominated trachyte lavas that were laid down during the Pleistocene period. The lavas have significant amounts of carbonate but very low calcium and magnesium levels. This has allowed the lake to concentrate into a caustic alkaline brine.

The chemical properties of the water are known to calcify the bodies of any living thing that died in the lake.

==Flora==
The colour of the lake is characteristic of those where very high evaporation rates occur. As water evaporates during the dry season, salinity levels increase to the point that salt-loving microorganisms begin to thrive. Such halophile organisms include some cyanobacteria that make their own food with photosynthesis as plants do. The red accessory photosynthesizing pigment in the cyanobacteria produces the deep reds of the open water of the lake and the orange colours of the shallow parts of the lake. The alkali salt crust on the surface of the lake is also often coloured red or pink by the halophilic microorganisms that live there.
Salt marshes and freshwater wetlands around the edges of the lake do support a variety of plants.

==Fauna==
Most animals find the lake&#x27;s high temperature (up to ) and its high and variable salt content inhospitable. Nonetheless, Lake Natron is home to some endemic algae, invertebrates, and birds. In the slightly less salty water around its margins, some fish can also survive.

The lake is the only regular breeding area in East Africa for the 2.5 million lesser flamingoes, whose status of &quot;near threatened&quot; results from their dependence on this one location. When salinity increases, so do cyanobacteria, and the lake can also support more nests. These flamingoes, the single large flock in East Africa, gather along nearby saline lakes to feed on &quot;Spirulina&quot; (a blue-green algae with red pigments). Lake Natron is a safe breeding location because its caustic environment is a barrier against predators trying to reach their nests on seasonally forming evaporite islands. Greater flamingoes also breed on the mud flats.

The lake has inspired the nature documentary &quot;The Crimson Wing: Mystery of the Flamingos&quot; by Disneynature, for its close relationship with the Lesser flamingoes as their only regular breeding area.

Two endemic fish species, the alkaline tilapias &quot;Alcolapia latilabris&quot; and &quot;A. ndalalani&quot;, also thrive in the waters at the edges of the hot spring inlets. &quot;A. alcalica&quot; is also present in the lake, but is not endemic.

==Threats and preservation==
The area around the salt lake is not inhabited but there is some herding and some seasonal cultivation. Threats to the salinity balance from increased siltation influxes will come from more projected logging in Natron watersheds and a planned hydroelectric power plant on the Ewaso Ng&#x27;iro across the border in Kenya. Although development plans include constructions of a dike at the north end of the lake to contain the freshwater, the threat of dilution to this breeding ground may still be serious. There is no formal protection.

A new threat to Lake Natron is the proposed development of a soda ash plant on its shores. The plant would pump water from the lake and extract the sodium carbonate to convert to washing powder for export. Accompanying the plant would be housing for over 1000 workers, and a coal-fired power station to provide energy for the plant complex. In addition, there is a possibility the developers may introduce a hybrid brine shrimp to increase the efficiency of extraction.

According to Chris Magin, the RSPB&#x27;s international officer for Africa, &quot;The chance of the lesser flamingoes continuing to breed in the face of such mayhem are next to zero. This development will leave lesser flamingoes in East Africa facing extinction&quot;. Seventy-five percent of the world&#x27;s lesser flamingoes are born on Lake Natron. Currently a group of more than fifty East African conservation and environmental institutions are running a worldwide campaign to stop the planned construction of the soda ash factory by Tata Chemicals Ltd of Mumbai, India, and National Development Corporation of Tanzania. The group working under the umbrella name Lake Natron Consultative Group is being co-ordinated by Ken Mwathe, Conservation Programme Manager at BirdLife International&#x27;s Africa Secretariat.

As per communication in June 2008, Tata Chemicals shall not proceed with the Natron Project and further re-examination of this project will be subject to the Ramsar Wetlands plan, which is currently under preparation.

Because of its unique biodiversity, Tanzania named the Lake Natron Basin to the Ramsar List of Wetlands of International Importance on 4 July 2001. The lake is also the World Wildlife Fund East African halophytics ecoregion.

==Visiting the area==
There are a number of campgrounds near the lake, which is also the base for climbing Ol Doinyo Lengai. Lake Natron has tourist attraction potentials that are important for ecotourism development. However, lack of a general management plan, inadequate funding at the operational level, lack of mechanisms to secure a fair distribution of ecotourism benefits, and poorly developed tourism infrastructural facilities to support diverse segments of tourists were identified as the main challenges associated with the management of ecotourism in the area. The lake can also be accessed from Shompole Conservancy Kenya.

<text>Louis Orville Breithaupt (28 October 1890 – 6 December 1960) served as the 18th Lieutenant Governor of Ontario, Canada, from 1952 to 1957.

==Life and career==
Born in Berlin (later Kitchener), Ontario, the son of Emma Alvarine (Devitt) and Louis Jacob Breithaupt, he was educated at the University of Toronto. He became head of his family&#x27;s leather business, Breithaupt Leather Company, in Kitchener. He was a Kitchener alderman for four years, and in 1923 became the youngest mayor in the city&#x27;s history. He was a Liberal Member of Parliament from 1940 to 1952.

Breithaupt was appointed Lieutenant Governor of Ontario in 1952 and served until 1957.

In 1953, he was awarded an honorary LL.D from McMaster University.

Breithaupt was active in many service organizations, such as the YMCA and Rotary Club. In 1959, he became Chancellor of Victoria University. Breithaupt died in Toronto in 1960 at the age of 70. He was buried along with the rest of his family at Kitchener&#x27;s Mount Hope Cemetery.

<text>Frank Ray Lawson (August 30, 1886 – April 4, 1980), was the 17th Lieutenant Governor of Ontario, Canada, from 1946 to 1952.

Born in London, Ontario, he was the son of Francis Edgar (&quot;Frank&quot;) Lawson, a former newspaper reporter, and Lorena Hodgins, a former teacher. He studied at London Collegiate and attended Woodstock College in 1902, but left after less than a year, eager to begin a business career. At age 17, he began working as a clerk in a London dry goods business, and later worked as a traveling salesman for a wholesale jeweler, before becoming a traveling salesman for Lawson &amp; Jones Limited, the printing firm co-founded by his father. In 1909 he married Helen Newton and they later had five children.

In 1911, following the sudden death of his father, Lawson returned to London and assumed his father&#x27;s position with Lawson &amp; Jones. In 1913, he borrowed heavily to purchase the shares held by the Jones family and, at the age of 26, became the company&#x27;s president, director and major shareholder. In addition to printing druggists&#x27; labels and calendars, in 1916 Lawson &amp; Jones entered into a profitable arrangement to manufacture cigarette packaging for Imperial Tobacco. By 1920, Lawson had retired the debt he incurred and throughout the depression the company grew by acquiring and consolidating other printing concerns.

When war broke out in 1939, Lawson went to work for C.D. Howe, Canadian Federal Minister of Munitions and Supply, as a &quot;dollar-a-year-man&quot;, and was appointed president of Federal Aircraft Limited, a crown corporation established in Montreal to manufacture the Avro Anson trainer for the British Commonwealth Air Training Plan. He was named an Officer of the Order of the British empire in 1942.

During his career, Lawson was a senior executive or director of 20 Canadian companies, including: president, Lawson &amp; Jones Ltd., president, Canadian Containers; president, Midland Securities, Ltd.; vice-president and director, The Royal Bank of Canada; director, Traders Finance Corporation Limited; director, London &amp; Western Trust Co. Ltd.; vice-president and director, Canada Trust Company Ltd.; director, Huron &amp; Erie Loan and Savings Company; director, Northern Life Assurance Co. of Canada; director, Toronto General Insurance; director, Great Lakes Paper. Eight universities conferred honorary degrees on him.
Ray Lawson was Lieutenant Governor of Ontario from 1946 to 1952. He was later Canadian Consul-General in New York City from 1953 to 1955. From 1948 to 1956, he was the Chancellor of University of King&#x27;s College, Halifax, Nova Scotia.

In 1947, Lawson purchased the Oakville lakeshore estate, “Ballymena” that was previously owned by William Fletcher Eaton, to have a suitable residence close to Toronto and for use in his capacity as Lieutenant Governor. It became his permanent home.

Lawson was an active philanthropist most of his life, having sponsored the building of a library at the University of Western Ontario as early as 1933, and over the years creating various scholarships, trusts and contributing to charitable societies. In 1956, he established the Lawson Foundation, with assets of $2,000,000. The Foundation has since donated over $50 million to charities across Canada and in 2005 had an endowment of over $90 million.

Ray Lawson died in 1980 and was buried at Woodland Cemetery, London, Ontario.

His descendants currently reside all over the world, including Australia, Japan and South Africa. They continue to participate in and volunteer with the Lawson Foundation.

Has a street and public elementary school named after him in Brampton, ON and a street in Montreal, QC (Anjou borough).

<doc id="366610" wikidata="Q1888930" url="?curid=366610" title="Vector Markup Language">
<text>Vector Markup Language (VML) is an obsolete XML-based file format for two-dimensional vector graphics. It was specified in Part 4 of the Office Open XML standards ISO/IEC 29500 and ECMA-376. According to the specification, VML is a deprecated format included in Office Open XML for legacy reasons only.

VML was used extensively in MS Office 2007 Word, Excel and PowerPoint documents. In 2012, with the release of Internet Explorer 10, VML became obsolete and is no longer supported by Internet Explorer standard mode. It is a legacy feature that is available in Internet Explorer 10 only when the browser is set to run in modes that emulate the functionality of previous versions of Internet Explorer 6, 7, 8, and 9.

== History ==

VML was submitted to the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) in 1998 by Autodesk, Hewlett-Packard, Macromedia, Microsoft, and Vision. Around the same time other competing W3C submissions were received in the area of web vector graphics, such as Precision Graphics Markup Language (PGML) from Adobe Systems, Sun Microsystems, and others. As a result of these submissions, a new W3C working group was created, which produced Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG). SVG became a W3C Recommendation in 2001 as a language for describing two-dimensional vector and mixed vector/raster graphics in XML. VML has been largely deprecated in favor of other formats, such as SVG. SVG is not compatible with VML.

Development of the format ceased in 1998. VML is implemented in Internet Explorer from version 5 to version 9 and in Microsoft Office 2000. VML is no longer available in Internet Explorer 10. Microsoft expects web sites to transition to SVG. Version 2 of the Google Maps JavaScript API used to use VML for vector paths on Internet Explorer 5.5+, but has been officially deprecated in favour of version 3, which does not.

== Syntax ==
Below is a VML instance as produced by Microsoft Excel 2010:

 &lt;v:textbox style=&#x27;mso-direction-alt:auto&#x27;&gt;
 &lt;div style=&#x27;text-align:left&#x27;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
 &lt;/v:textbox&gt;

 &lt;x:SizeWithCells/&gt;
 &lt;x:Anchor&gt;

 &lt;x:AutoFill&gt;False&lt;/x:AutoFill&gt;
 &lt;x:Row&gt;6&lt;/x:Row&gt;
 &lt;x:Column&gt;3&lt;/x:Column&gt;
 &lt;/x:ClientData&gt;
 &lt;/v:shape&gt;
&lt;/xml&gt;
Note that, by specifying a root element named &quot;xml&quot;, VML contravenes the XML Recommendation of the W3C, which states that names beginning &#x27;x&#x27; &#x27;m&#x27; &#x27;l&#x27; are &quot;reserved for standardization in this or future versions of this specification&quot;.


VML, when embedded within HTML markup, is read and processed by Microsoft Internet Explorer (but not other browsers); for example, the following example displays a solid blue oval:
&lt;html xmlns:v&gt;
&lt;style&gt;v\:*{behavior:url(#default#VML);position:absolute}&lt;/style&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
&lt;v:oval style=&quot;left:0;top:0;width:100;height:50&quot; fillcolor=&quot;blue&quot; stroked=&quot;f&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
== Implementations ==

VML is used by most Microsoft Office applications, such as Microsoft Word and Microsoft Visio, within HTML files created using the &#x27;codice_1&#x27; option (plain HTML or MHT). Such files retain complete vector information, and can be reopened for editing using other Microsoft applications, such as Microsoft PowerPoint. VML was natively supported by Microsoft&#x27;s Internet Explorer up to version 9 inline within HTML, using an undefined version of SGML namespaces. Support for VML was dropped in Internet Explorer 10 and subsequent versions.

Support for &quot;ink annotations&quot; in Office Open XML files was added to LibreOffice during the 3.7 development cycle.

VML is not natively supported by most web browsers. Web browsers such as Mozilla Firefox, Opera, Safari or Google Chrome support Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) instead of VML.

== Microsoft Outlook HTML email rendering==
Though VML is deprecated as a standard in Internet Explorer, it is most commonly used in relation to the development of HTML emails rendered in Microsoft Outlook 2007, 2010, and 2013. The use of background-images in email campaigns requires the use of VML to be displayed in Outlook because Outlook does not support the CSS or HTML attributes for background-images. However using VML for content rather than its intended purpose as an image format comes with a number of accessibility issues.

<doc id="366612" wikidata="Q5149747" url="?curid=366612" title="Columbia Journalism Review">
<text>The Columbia Journalism Review (CJR) is a biannual magazine for professional journalists that has been published by the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism since 1961. Its original purpose was &quot;to assess the performance of journalism in all its forms, to call attention to its shortcomings and strengths, and to help define—or redefine—standards of honest, responsible service.&quot; Its contents include news and media industry trends, analysis, professional ethics, and stories behind news.

In October 2015, it was announced that the publishing frequency of the print magazine was being reduced from six to two issues per year in order to focus on its digital operations.

== Organization board ==
The current chairman is Stephen J. Adler, previously editor-in-chief at Reuters from 2011 to 2021.

The previous chairman of the magazine was Victor Navasky, a professor at the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism and former editor and publisher of the politically progressive &quot;The Nation&quot;. According to Executive Editor Michael Hoyt, Navasky&#x27;s role is &quot;99% financial&quot; and &quot;he doesn&#x27;t push anything editorially.&quot; Hoyt also has stated that Navasky has &quot;learned how to get a small magazine of ideas into the black, and he&#x27;s trying to come up with some strategies for us.&quot;

== Finances ==
&quot;CJR&quot; is a nonprofit entity and relies on fundraising to fund its operations. In August 2007, Mike Hoyt, the executive editor of &quot;CJR&quot; since 2003, said the magazine&#x27;s income in 2007 would exceed expenses by about $50,000, with estimates of a $40,000 surplus in 2008. Hoyt attributed the surpluses to a mix of some staff cuts, such as not replacing three editors who left, and fundraising increases. Donations to the &quot;CJR&quot; in the past three years have included about $1.25 million from a group of news veterans headed by former &quot;Philadelphia Inquirer&quot; executive editor Gene Roberts.

As of mid-2007, the &quot;CJR&quot; had an eight-person staff, an annual budget of $2.3 million, and a paper circulation of approximately 19,000, including 6,000 student subscriptions. Subscriptions to an Internet newsletter entitled &quot;The Media Today&quot; have begun, but as of 2017, enrollment numbers are not available and do not contribute to these circulation figures.

== Editor ==
In 2016, Kyle Pope, who had served as the editor in chief of &quot;The New York Observer&quot;, was announced as the new editor and publisher of &quot;CJR&quot;, replacing Elizabeth Spayd, when she was announced as the sixth public editor of &quot;The New York Times&quot;.

On 24 July 2017, in Washington, D.C., Pope addressed the House Judiciary Committee bipartisan Forum on Press Freedoms regarding concerns that the actions of Donald Trump during his campaign for and following election as President of the United States undermine the constitutional freedom of the press.

In June 2024, Sewell Chan was appointed to be the executive editor of &quot;CJR&quot;, effective September 16.

<text>Sir John Morison Gibson (January 1, 1842 – June 3, 1929) was a Canadian politician and the tenth Lieutenant Governor of Ontario.

== Biography ==

John Morison Gibson, the son of Scottish immigrants, was born in 1842, in Toronto. He grew up on a farm in Caledonia, Ontario, went to Hamilton Central School, in Hamilton, and went on to be educated at the University of Toronto, as a lawyer. In 1860 he joined the university company of the 2nd Battalion Volunteer Militia of The Queen&#x27;s Own Rifles of Canada and was a Wimbledon marksman in 1874. He became a company director and developed a keen interest in music and art. On his return to Hamilton in 1864, he enlisted in the 13th Battalion as an ensign. In 1866, he was a lieutenant in the 13th Battalion, and fought at the Battle of Ridgeway, defending against the Fenian raids. He rose through the ranks of the 13th Battalion and was Commanding Officer from 1886 to 1895 (see regimental history Royal Hamilton Light Infantry (Wentworth Regiment)). He was a Member of the Legislature from 1879 to 1905 and held the posts of Provincial Secretary, Commissioner of Crown Lands and Attorney General of Ontario. Gibson was appointed Lieutenant Governor of Ontario in 1908, and was knighted in 1912. During his mandate, the new Government House in Chorley Park (now demolished) was completed. Gibson served as Lieutenant Governor until 1914. He was one of Hamilton&#x27;s &quot;5 Johns&quot;, who, in 1896, formed the Dominion Power and Transmission Company, that brought hydroelectric power, for the first time, to Hamilton, from their plant, at DeCew Falls. John Dickenson was another of the 5 Johns.

&quot;One big reason&quot; for almost 75% increase in the population of Hamilton between 1901 and 1912, boasted Sir John Morison Gibson of &quot;Dominion Power and Transmission Company&quot;, was &quot;Cheap Electric Power Furnished By Us.&quot; This simplistic explanation for the development of Hamilton in the early twentieth century leaves much unexamined, but one conclusion cannot be disputed. In the perception of the Hamilton public, a view certainly fostered by Gibson and his fellow hydroelectric promoters, Hamilton was no longer regarded the Birmingham or the Pittsburgh of Canada Hamilton was now, as the title of a 1906 promotional booklet on the city proudly proclaimed, &quot;The Electric City.&quot; 

After receiving a grant from Andrew Carnegie of New York the city of Hamilton built a brand new Library on the south side of Main Street West, across the street from the old Library. It was officially opened by the Lieutenant Governor Sir John Morison Gibson on May 5, 1913. He was active in many charities, especially the Red Cross and child welfare. He died in Hamilton, Ontario in 1929.

Gibson was a Freemason. He was the Grand Master of the Grand Lodge of Canada in the Province of Ontario and on two occasions the Sovereign Grand Commander of the Supreme Council of the Scottish Rite in Canada.

== Tribute ==

The Gibson neighbourhood in Hamilton is named after him. it is bounded by Barton Street East (north), Main Street East (south), Wentworth Street (west) and Sherman Avenue (east). Landmarks in this neighbourhood include Cathedral High School, &quot;Budget Motor Inn&quot;, &quot;Barton Library&quot;, &quot;Hamilton-Wentworth District School Board&quot;, &quot;Hamilton-Wentworth Catholic District School Board&quot;, &quot;Powell Park&quot; and &quot;Woodland Park&quot;. Gibson Avenue, found in this neighbourhood, is also named after him.

<text>The Jaú National Park () is a national park located in the state of Amazonas, Brazil.
It is one of the largest forest reserves in South America, and part of a World Heritage Site.

==Location==

The name &quot;Jaú&quot; comes from that of one of the largest fish in Brazil, the gilded catfish or jau (&quot;Zungaro zungaro&quot;), after which the main river of the park is named.
The park is in the Amazon biome in the Japurá-Solimões-Negro moist forests ecoregion.
It covers an area of .
It was created by decree 85.200 of 24 September 1980.
It is administered by the Chico Mendes Institute for Biodiversity Conservation.
It covers parts of the municipalities of Barcelos, Codajás and Novo Airão in the state of Amazonas.

The park is one of the largest protected areas in Brazil.
It is about northwest of Manaus and contains the entire Jaú River basin between the Unini River to the north and the Carabinani River to the south. All three rivers flow east to enter the right bank of the Rio Negro.
The eastern part of the park adjoins the Rio Unini Extractive Reserve to the north, which runs along the opposite bank of the Unini River.
The park is bounded to the northwest by the Amanã Sustainable Development Reserve.
To the east, near the Rio Negro, the park adjoins the Rio Negro State Park North Section to the south.

==Environment==

The park&#x27;s terrain is representative of the Negro-Solimões interfluvial plateau.
It has two main areas: the Trombetas/Negro plateau and the lower western Amazon plateau.
The higher area has hills with flat tops at cut by valleys, while the lower area has altitudes of about .
There are large areas of seasonally flooded land with poor drainage, and some permanent lakes.
Average annual rainfall is over , and the wettest months occur in March and September, when maximum short wave solar radiation is being received and so maximum convectional rainfall occurs.
Temperatures range from with an average of .

Vegetation types are dense rainforest (77%), open rainforest (14%), transition from rainforest to campinarana (7%) and campinarana (2%).
Botanists have catalogued about 400 plant species, several of which are restricted to certain environments such as the uplands and the flooded areas.
263 species of fish have been recorded, some new to science.

==Conservation==

The park is classed as IUCN protected area category II (national park).
The objective is to preserve an Amazonian black water ecosystem for environmental education, interaction with local communities, sustainable tourism and the research. 
The park is designed as a mega-reserve and world heritage site for present and future generations.
Protected species in the park include the margay (Leopardus wiedii), jaguar (Panthera onca), giant otter (Pteronura brasiliensis) and Amazonian manatee (Trichechus inunguis).

Jaú National Park was inscribed by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site in 2000.
It became part of the Central Amazon Ecological Corridor, established in 2002.
In 2003 the property was expanded by the addition of the Anavilhanas National Park, Amanã Sustainable Development Reserve and Mamirauá Sustainable Development Reserve to form the Central Amazon Conservation Complex, a larger World Heritage Site.
The park became part of the Lower Rio Negro Mosaic, created in 2010.
The conservation unit is supported by the Amazon Region Protected Areas Program.

<text>Sir Casimir Stanislaus Gzowski, (born Kazimierz Stanisław Gzowski; March 5, 1813 – August 24, 1898), was a Polish-Canadian engineer who was known for his work on a wide variety of Canadian railways, as well as work on the Welland Canal. He also served as acting Lieutenant Governor of Ontario from 1896 to 1897.

==Life and career==
Gzowski was born in Saint Petersburg to a noble Polish father, Count Stanisław Gzowski, who was then serving as a captain in the Russian Imperial Guard. During the Polish November Uprising, he served as a combat engineer with the rank of &quot;podporuchik&quot; in the Polish army under the command of Józef Dwernicki against the Russians. After their defeat, he escaped to Austria, but as an unwanted political prisoner, he was deported by the Austrians to the USA. Later, his family also emigrated. He knew no English but began to study law and was admitted into practice. His father was an engineer, and as this became his primary interest, Kazimierz became involved in railway construction in the United States. Eventually, he was hired as an engineer to help in the construction of the New York and Erie Railway.

In 1841, he moved to Canada to work on the Welland Canal. He also helped finish the building of Yonge Street and did other projects for the Department of Public Works in southern Ontario. He settled in London.

In 1849, Gzowski was hired as a railway contractor by the St. Lawrence and Atlantic Railroad. The new president of this reorganized company, Alexander Tilloch Galt, and other directors were dissatisfied with the work of the Montreal contractors. Accepting Galt&#x27;s offer to be Chief Engineer, in charge of construction, Gzowski moved his family to Sherbrooke.

The purpose of the St. Lawrence and Atlantic Railway, along with its American partner, the Atlantic and St. Lawrence Railway, was to provide a route for the traffic of the St. Lawrence River and Ottawa River at the port of Montreal to the ice-free Atlantic port of Portland, Maine. By 1850, however, promoters of this project learned of plans by Boston interests to build a railway from Lake Champlain to Ogdensburg, opposite Prescott, on the route of the projected Bytown &amp; Prescott Railway.

In 1850, Galt, along with Luther Hamilton Holton, David Lewis Macpherson and other directors of the St. Lawrence and Atlantic, formed a committee which took steps to secure a charter for the building of a railway between Montreal and Kingston. Several possible routes were considered. At a public meeting held in Montreal, the committee delegated Gzowski to make a detailed survey of two routes. One ran through the Ottawa River valley, and the other was about 15 miles inland from the St. Lawrence River.

In 1851. the Montreal and Kingston Railway Committee commissioned another well-known Canadian engineer and future associate of Gzowski, Walter Shanly, to make another survey of the Montreal-Kingston route. He decided in favour of the line closely paralleling the shore of the St. Lawrence River and running through Cornwall and Prescott. This was the route adopted by the Grand Trunk Railway between Montreal, Kingston and Toronto.

The idea of a railway through the Province of Canada had been on the minds of Canadians for some time. The government proposed to build a line from Montreal to Windsor or to Sarnia. For that part of the route east of Montreal, Premier Francis Hincks turned the first sod on the Quebec Richmond Railway on January 7, 1852. The government intended to close the gap between Richmond and Montreal by using the St. Lawrence and Atlantic Railway. Galt and his associates from Montreal obtained a charter for their Montreal and Kingston Railway on August 30, 1851.

Francis Hincks turned the plans for the railway scheme over to private interests in 1852, awarding contracts for the Kingston to Toronto section and Montreal to Kingston railway to the British contracting firm Peto, Brassey Jackson and Betts, a move that led to the formation of the Grand Trunk Railway. While Galt had intended to secure the funds to build the Montreal and Kingston Railway, he did not have the resources to compete with Peto, Brassey Jackson and Betts.

Galt and his partners saw great possibilities in the construction of a railway west of Toronto. In 1852, through some skillful financial manipulation, they managed to get control of most of the stock in the Toronto and Guelph Railway, chartered in 1851. Gzowski &amp; Co. were contractors of the line between Guelph and Sarnia, as well as other sections of the GTR in Ontario and Michigan.

In 1856, Gzowski &amp; Co. was granted the right to cut timber on the Moon River in Muskoka, likely as a source of materials for railway construction. In 1858, Gzowski was granted timber licences on the Whitefish River and on the South River in Northeastern Ontario. Some of these licence records show Gzowski and Macpherson were in partnership with another Muskoka lumberman, Walter Moberly.

As president of the Toronto Turf Club, in 1859 Gzowski was a prime factor in the creation of the Queen&#x27;s Plate, the first organized Thoroughbred horse race in North America. Gzowski was instrumental in organizing the Canadian Society of Civil Engineers, where he served as its first president from 1889 until 1891, and he founded Canada&#x27;s first rifle association. He was also the first Commissioner of the Niagara Parks Commission.

Gzowski was appointed an honorary aide-de-camp to the Queen in 1879 and was knighted by Queen Victoria in 1890. As a personal friend of Sir John A. Macdonald, Gzowski was linked to the Conservative Party, even acting as an interim Lieutenant Governor before Oliver Mowat took office in 1897. He died in 1898 in Toronto.

==Legacy==
Casimir Gzowski Park, on Toronto&#x27;s waterfront, commemorates him and includes a monument with some information about his career.

On 5 March 1963, the Canadian post office issued a commemorative stamp featuring Gzowski on the 150th anniversary of his birth.

Gzowski was the great-great-grandfather of CBC radio personality Peter Gzowski.

<text>Sir George Airey Kirkpatrick (September 13, 1841 – December 13, 1899) was a Canadian politician from Ontario, Canada.

Born in 1841 in Kingston, the son of Thomas Kirkpatrick, George Kirkpatrick was educated at Trinity College Dublin.

==Career==
Kirkpatrick joined the Canadian Militia as a private in 1861 during the Trent Affair and later as an officer and the adjutant in the 14th Battalion of Rifles saw active service during the Fenian Raids in 1866. In 1867, he was promoted to major and joined the newly formed 47th Frontenac Battalion of Infantry and was promoted to lieutenant colonel in 1872. He retired from the militia in 1890. In 1876, he would command the Canadian rifle team at Wimbledon (London), England, and he was president of the Dominion Rifle Association through the 1880s.

He was called to the bar in 1865 and served as a Conservative member of Parliament (MP) in the House of Commons from 1870 to 1892 taking over the Frontenac seat held by his late father.

He was a supporter of Sir John A. Macdonald&#x27;s National Policy but was also a friend of Liberal leader Edward Blake whom he supported on issues such as proportional representation. Kirkpatrick considered joining the Liberal Party over the Pacific Scandal but decided to remain with the Conservatives.

In 1875, Kirkpatrick contested the Governor General&#x27;s right to pardon Louis Riel without the consent of the Canadian Cabinet. As a result of his arguments, the Colonial Office issued new instructions that future Governors General not act without the advice of his ministers in such matters.

Kirkpatrick also argued in favour of protection of sailors from ship-owners who went bankrupt.

Following the 1882 election, Prime Minister Macdonald nominated Kirkpatrick as 4th speaker of the House of Commons. He was unenthusiastic about the position, but was nevertheless considered to be the most impartial Canadian Speaker of the nineteenth century. The Conservative government was unimpressed with his lack of partisanship, and he was not renominated for the position following the 1887 election. He returned to the backbenches where he remained until 1892 when he was appointed the seventh Lieutenant Governor of Ontario by Sir John Abbott.

During his time in office, Kirkpatrick made a special effort to visit and support the rural areas of the province. He served until 1896, and was knighted the same year. Sir Mackenzie Bowell offered Kirkpatrick a position in the Cabinet, but by this time, he had lost interest in politics. He died in Toronto in 1899.

==Family==

In 1865, Kirkpatrick married Frances Macauley, and after her death, married Isabel Macpherson at Paris, France, September 26, 1883. Isabel Louise Macpherson, was the daughter of Hon. Sir D. L. Macpherson, P.C., K.C.M.G., and his wife, Elizabeth Sarah, daughter of William Molson, Esquire, of Montreal. She was born in Toronto, and educated in England. While first lady of Ontario, she secured funds for the presentation of a wedding gift to the present Prince and Princess of Wales and assisted in securing the establishment in Canada of a branch of the St. John Ambulance Association. In 1898 she was selected to present colours to the Army and Navy Veterans.

His son was General Sir George Macaulay Kirkpatrick Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath, Knight Commander of the Order of the Star of India.

==Legacy==
Upper Canada College has a chair that once belonged to George Airey Kirkpatrick.

<doc id="366645" wikidata="Q257441" url="?curid=366645" title="Emi Koussi">
<text>Emi Koussi (also known as Emi Koussou) is a high pyroclastic shield volcano that lies at the southeast end of the Tibesti Mountains in the central Sahara, in the northern Borkou Region of northern Chad. The highest mountain of the Sahara, the volcano is one of several in the Tibesti range, and reaches an elevation of , rising above the surrounding sandstone plains. The volcano is wide and has a volume of .

Two nested calderas cap the volcano, the outer one being about in size. Within it on the southeast side is a smaller caldera known as Era Kohor, about wide and deep. Numerous lava domes, cinder cones, maars, and lava flows are found within the calderas and along the outer flanks of the shield. Era Kohor contains trona deposits, and Emi Koussi has been studied as an analogue of the Martian volcano Elysium Mons. Emi Koussi was active more than one million years ago, but some eruptions may be more recent, and there is ongoing fumarolic and hot spring activity.

== Geography and geomorphology ==

Emi Koussi lies in Chad, Africa, and is part of the Tibesti Mountains as well as its highest peak and thus of the Sahara; many peaks of the Tibesti exceed in height. These mountains are formed by a group of volcanoes that grew on top of a large dome of Earth&#x27;s surface. Volcanism in this area is poorly studied; as the region is remote and access difficult for political reasons. Dirt roads cross the western and eastern margins of the summit caldera, and according to historical reports the Tibu people lived in its summit caldera and in artificial caves. In the Tedaga language, means &quot;mountains&quot;, &quot;massif&quot;. The mountain has played an important role in the research and discovery history of the Tibesti.

Emi Koussi rises to a height of on the southern side of the volcano, towering above the surrounding terrain. It is considered by some astronauts to be the most recognizable landmark on Earth, as seen from orbit. Supposedly the entire Tibesti can be seen from the northern summits.

It is a shield volcano with a diameter of or and an estimated volume of . The summit of Emi Koussi is formed by two overlapping calderas, which together form a wide elliptical caldera that extends from northwest to southeast. The northern caldera formed first, then the southern caldera which is about deeper below the northern one. high scarps form the inner margin of the southern caldera, with the floor at an elevation of . Before the formation of the calderas, the volcano may have reached a height of . Emi Koussi has been compared to a Martian volcano, Elysium Mons. The caldera rim is cut by one outlet, the Porte de Modiounga, from which gorges emanate into the caldera. The highest point of Emi Koussi lies on the southern rim of the caldera.

Nested within this combined caldera is the Era Kohor caldera, which is deep and wide, having the appearance of a giant hole. This caldera is also known as Natron Hole or Trou au Natron. Trachytic lava flows are exposed in its walls, and sodium carbonate has been deposited on its floor, which lies at an elevation of and contains a salt lake. The floor of Era Kohor is thus deep white. Three maars and several scoria cones are also nested within the combined caldera, along with lava domes and lava flows. Debris from explosive eruptions fills the calderas.

The Kohor pumices and two sets of ignimbrites cover the flanks of Emi Koussi, which steepen as they approach the summit. Scoria cones on the slopes are accompanied by lava flows. On the upper sectors of the volcano, lavas are crisscrossed by cracks, which are known as &quot;lappiaz&quot;. Sandstone crops out on the terrain surrounding the volcano. North of Emi Koussi lie other volcanoes, such as Tarso Ahon and Tarso Emi Chi, the former of which is connected to Emi Koussi by a narrow ridge.

== Geology ==

Tectonic activity appears to have occurred in the Tibesti already between the Carboniferous and the Cretaceous, that is between 358.9 ± 0.4 and 66 million years ago. During the earliest stage of volcanism on Tibesti, alkali basalts formed large plateaus. Later, the central volcanoes developed on top of these plateaus. Volcanism in Tibesti has been explained with a mantle plume, as has been proposed for other African volcanoes, although recently tectonic effects of the collision between Africa and Europe and their effects at a distance have also been advanced as an explanation.

The oldest rocks below the Tibesti are Precambrian diorites, granites and schists, which are probably of Neoproterozoic age and are differentiated into two units. The volcanic rocks rest on an uplifted basement formed by Cretaceous and Paleozoic sandstone. The latter crop out at the southwestern foot of Emi Koussi, while volcanic rocks dominate north of the volcano, and the Tibesti massif is prevalent east and southeast of Emi Koussi. Older volcanic rocks are exposed in valleys.

Emi Koussi has erupted phonolite, trachyandesite and trachyte, as well as mafic rocks like basanite and tephrite. The erupted rocks define two alkaline suites. Phenocryst chemistry and content varies between the various rocks; among the minerals are alkali feldspar, amphibole, biotite, clinopyroxene, olivine, oxides and plagioclase. Alkali feldspar, apatite, clinopyroxene, olivine, magnetite, mica, nepheline, oxides, plagioclase, quartz, sodalite, titanite and zircon also form the groundmass of microliths in erupted rocks. Magma genesis mainly involved fractional crystallization processes. Rocks from Emi Koussi were used as raw material by Neolithic societies of the region.

During the early Holocene, Era Kohor was filled with a deep, circular lake. Diatom beds have been found above the floor of Era Kohor and in depressions without outlet elsewhere in the caldera, they reach thicknesses of . Farther down on the mountain, gullies start appearing at elevation and become deep gorges by elevation. Elleboe wadi originates on Emi Koussi, and several streams on the western flank join into the Enneri Miski which drains southwards and disappears south of the mountains. Small pools of water are found around Emi Koussi.

== Eruptive history ==

Emi Koussi erupted between 2.4 and 1.3 million years ago; it is considered to be of Pliocene-Quaternary age. The volcano was constructed mainly during the Miocene within about one million years. Radiometric dating has yielded ages of 2.42 ± 0.03 - 2.33 ± 0.09 million years ago for the oldest Emi Koussi stage. The third stage has yielded ages of 1.4 ± 0.3 - 1.32 ± 0.2 million years ago; formerly Era Kohor was considered to be a Holocene centre.

During the first stage, Emi Koussi erupted trachytes and trachyandesites in the form of ignimbrites and basaltic lapilli. This was followed in the second stage by trachytic, green or grey ignimbrites, trachytic and phonolitic lava domes and additional basaltic lava flows. The second stage ignimbrites can be found within the northern caldera and on the southern flank of the volcano. The third stage was dominantly phonolitic, with breccia, tuffs and ignimbrites including the Kohor ignimbrite. The various ignimbrites contain fiamme and often look like lava flows. Each stage was accompanied by the formation of a caldera, and basaltic volcanism continued through all three stages. Phreatic explosions associated with Era Kohor have deposited large blocks within the summit caldera, including beautifully coloured syenite blocks.

Quaternary volcanism gave rise to the cones on the slopes of Emi Koussi, and the three maars are the most recent vents in the combined caldera, while long lava flows have been interpreted to be the youngest volcanism at Emi Koussi. The most recent volcanic vents show little erosion. Early in the Pleistocene, erosion took place on the flanks of Emi Koussi, and carbonates were deposited in Era Kohor until recent times.

On the southern foot of the volcano, fumaroles are active such as at Yi Yerra at elevation on the southern flanks. At Yi Yerra, hot springs produce water with temperatures of . Emi Koussi is considered to be a Holocene volcano. Lava flows have buried Holocene diatoms beds in its caldera; dates of 14,790 ± 400 - 12,400 ± 400 years before present have been obtained by radiocarbon dating on diatom beds which have been penetrated or buried by lava flows.

== Climate and vegetation ==

The Tibesti mountains feature a desert mountain climate. There are no weather stations close to Emi Koussi and the stations at lower elevations likely underestimate precipitation at higher elevations, but based on cloud cover data, a yearly precipitation of has been estimated for Emi Koussi; in the past it was wetter than this. The climate reflects both northerly and southerly influences and is distinct from that of the surrounding deserts. There is no evidence of nivation forms on Emi Koussi and the identification of periglacial landforms is questionable, although periglacial activity likely occurred in the Pleistocene and may continue to the present-day. Even during the Pleistocene, no part of the mountain had sub-freezing temperatures through the entire year.

A number of diatom species have been identified in sediments left by the Era Kohor lake, including &quot;Cocconeis placentula&quot;, &quot;Cyclotella cyclopuncta&quot;, &quot;Cyclotella ocellata&quot;, &quot;Cymbella cistula&quot;, &quot;Cymbella leptoceros&quot;, &quot;Cymbella muelleri&quot;, &quot;Epithemia adnata&quot;, &quot;Fragilaria construens&quot;, &quot;Fragilaria pinnata&quot;, &quot;Gomphonema affine&quot;, &quot;Gomphonema parvulum&quot;, &quot;Navicula oblonga&quot; and &quot;Rhopalodia gibba&quot;. The diatom fauna appears to be unusual in comparison to other Saharan paleolakes, probably owing to the high elevation of the Emi Koussi lake. Cattail and water milfoil grew around the lake.

Generally, in the Tibesti vegetation occurs in five different belts depending on elevation. On Emi Koussi, &quot;Erica arborea&quot; is found up to elevations of , in the past it was probably more widespread. The summit region features montane vegetation, including &quot;Artemisia&quot;-&quot;Ephedra&quot; steppes which cover large parts of the caldera floor and may have been used as pastures. The lava flows high on the mountain have characteristic environmental traits which allow the development of a particular vegetation. This vegetation encompasses &quot;Dichrocephala&quot;, &quot;Eragrostis&quot;, &quot;Erodium&quot;, &quot;Helichrysum&quot; as well as ferns, liverworts and mosses. &quot;Oldenlandia&quot; and &quot;Selaginella&quot; species grow at fumaroles. The caldera floor was used as a pasture for camels and goats.

The wood rush &quot;Luzula tibestica&quot; is endemic on Emi Koussi. The fern &quot;Asplenium quezelii&quot; was discovered on Emi Koussi and at first thought to be endemic there before it was found to be identical to &quot;Asplenium daghestanicum&quot;, a species also previously considered to be endemic to Dagestan, more than away from Emi Koussi.

<text>Xara Flare Open Vector File Format is a format that was introduced in 1997 by XARA to compete with the Macromedia Flash format. The format was open and developers could export from their products to this format, royalty free and without the need of any permission. The key characteristic and design goal was for a file format that was very compact for fast download over the internet. It supports a rich set of vector graphic primitives including a wide variety of graduated shading and graduated transparency.

The Xara Flare format was also the native file format used in the Xara X vector graphics software. In 2004, it was updated and renamed the Xar file format.

<doc id="366647" wikidata="Q459742" url="?curid=366647" title="Samut Songkhram province">
<text>Samut Songkhram (, ) is one of the central provinces (&quot;changwat&quot;) of Thailand.

Neighbouring provinces are (from the south clockwise) Phetchaburi, Ratchaburi and Samut Sakhon. Local people call Samut Songkhram Mae Klong. The province is the smallest in area of all Thai provinces. Chang and Eng Bunker, the famous Siamese twins were born here on 11 May 1811.

==Toponymy==
The word &quot;samut&quot; originates from the Sanskrit word समुद्र &quot;samudra&quot; meaning &#x27;ocean&#x27;, and the word &quot;songkhram&quot; from Sanskrit संग्राम &quot;saṃgrāma&quot; meaning &#x27;war&#x27;. Hence the name of the province literally means &#x27;war ocean&#x27;.
However, this province is colloquially known as &quot;Mae Klong&quot; after the name of the main river that flows past the area.

==Geography==

Samut Songkhram is at the mouth of the Mae Klong River to the Bay of Bangkok (upper Gulf of Thailand). With several canals (&quot;khlong&quot;) the water of the river is spread through the province for irrigation. At the coast are many lakes for producing sea salt. The sandbar Don Hoi Lot at the mouth of the river is famous for its endemic shell population of &quot;Solen regularis&quot;.

It covers a total area of 416.7 km2 (about 160.9 sq mi). It can be considered the smallest province in Thailand. The total forest area is or 7.3 percent of provincial area.

This province is home to places of worship of the three major religions. There are 110 Buddhist temples, two Christian churches and one mosque. Additionally, Samut Songkhram is also home to the oldest Chinese joss house and almshouse in Thailand, which is over 215 years old.

==History==
Samut Songkhram or Mae Klong or Suan Nok (outside garden) was a part of Mueang Ratchaburi in the past. The old name of Mae Klong is Bang Chang which was centered at Tambon Amphawa, Samut Songkhram (from the district at present). During the transition from the Ayutthaya to the Thon Buri periods, it was separated from Ratchaburi and named Mueang Mae Klong.

Samut Songkhram was historically important during the establishment of Thon Buri as the kingdom’s capital by King Taksin the Great. When the Burmese led an army to Tambon Bang Kung, the king gathered the people to build a fort and prevent the city from capture by the Burmese troops. This was an important act against the Burmese invaders at that time.

Mueang Mae Klong (actually pronounced &quot;Mae Glawng&quot;), changed its name into Samut Songkhram but the actual year is not known. It is assumed it occurred in 1752 to 1756 because the name of the province first appeared in the evidence from the first Thai enacted law: Later, a decree was found,issued from the reign of King Borom Urn Baromgoate in 1756 and was identified as ordered to The Lord Rattanathibet, the Grand marshal of the Court. Apparently Kun Wisetvanish (Chean Ar Pan Teck), Kun Thip, and Meun Rukka Auksorn were daring ask to establish casinos in Samut Songkhram, Ratchaburi and Samut Prakan.

Samut Songkhram is the birthplace of many famous Thai people whether King Rama II who was born in 1767 in Amphawa District or Chang and Eng Bunker who were born in 1811.

==Symbols==
The provincial seal shows a drum over a river. The Thai word for drum is &quot;klong&quot;, thus refers to the Mae Klong River, as well as the old name of the province, Mae Klong. On both sides of the river coconut trees are displayed as one of the main products of the province.

The provincial tree is &quot;Casuarina equisetifolia&quot;. Siamese giant carp (&quot;Catlocarpio siamensis&quot;) is the provincial fish.

The provincial slogan is &quot;City of razor shells. Tops of the lychee trees. King Rama II Park. Passage of the Maeklong river. Worship the Buddhist image of Luang Pho Ban Laem.&quot;
==Administrative divisions==

===Provincial government===
The province is divided into three districts (&quot;amphoe&quot;). The districts are further divided into 36 subdistricts (&quot;tambons&quot;) and 284 villages (&quot;mubans&quot;).

As of December 2023 there are: one Samut Songkhram provincial administrative organization - PAO (&quot;&quot;) and nine municipal (&quot;thesaban&quot;) areas in the province. The capital Samut Songkhram has town (&quot;thesaban mueang&quot;) status and eight are subdistrict municipalities (&quot;thesaban tambon&quot;). 

The non-municipal areas are administered by 26 subdistrict administrative organizations (SAO) (&quot;ongkan borihan suan tambon&quot;).


==Economy==
Samut Songkhram is a leader in Thai salt production, with 4,535 rai worked in 2011 by 111 households to produce salt.

Aside from salt Samut Songkhram is also known for the variety of fruits, especially lychee, pomelo and coconut.

&quot;Pla thu&quot; (ปลาทู, &#x27;short mackerel&#x27;) is regarded as an important commercial fish and the most famous product of the province. Mackerel of Samut Songkhram is well known as &quot;Pla thu Mae Klong&quot;. Because the area of the province borders the Bay of Bangkok which is rich in plankton, they are regarded as the staple food of this fish species. Therefore, short mackerel of Samut Songkhram has a large body size and the meat is delicious. They can be cooked to a variety of foods such as &quot;Pla thu tom madan&quot; (ปลาทูต้มมะดัน, &#x27;Pla thu in spicy and sour soup&#x27;), &quot;Chu chee pla thu&quot; (ฉู่ฉี่ปลาทู, &#x27;Pla thu in red curry sauce&#x27;), &quot;Pla thu sa tia&quot; (ปลาทูซาเตี๊ยะ, Pla thu in sweet black soup), burger Pla thu, Pla thu meat, made into a burger filling which can be eaten only in Samut Songkhram. And exclusive &quot;Khao tom sam kasat&quot; (ข้าวต้มสามกษัตริย์, lit: &quot;three kings porridge&quot;), porridge with the main ingredients, Pla thu, prawn and fresh squid, recount that this menu has its origin from the King Rama V visiting the people at Mae Klong. He has prepared this menu based on his own original ideas until it became a legendary food.

<text>The Schwarzenau Brethren, the German Baptist Brethren, Dunkers, Dunkard Brethren, Tunkers, or sometimes simply called the German Baptists, are an Anabaptist group that dissented from Roman Catholic, Lutheran and Reformed European state churches during the 17th and 18th centuries. German Baptist Brethren emerged in some German-speaking states in western and southwestern parts of the Holy Roman Empire as a result of the Radical Pietist revival movement of the late 17th and early 18th centuries, where people began to read and study their Bibles on their own- rather than just being told by the Church what to believe and do.

Hopeful of the imminent return of Christ and desiring to follow Jesus in their daily life, the founding Brethren abandoned State churches and officially formed a new church in 1708. They thereby attempted to translate the New Testament idea of brotherly love into concrete congregational ordinances for all the members. The Brethren rejected some Radical Pietists’ focus on emotionalism and direct revelation, and emphasized early (&quot;Apostolic&quot; or &quot;primitive&quot;) New Testament Christianity as the binding standard for congregational practices. Founding and early Schwarzenau Brethren were also in fellowship with other Anabaptists such as the Mennonites and the River Brethren, and influenced by their writings.

As with many other Anabaptist traditions, the Schwarzenau Brethren are divided into Old Order groups (such as the Old Brethren German Baptist) who practice a lifestyle without certain elements of modern technology, Conservative groups (such as the Dunkard Brethren Church and the Old Brethren Church) who preserve traditional theological distinctives while allowing for the usage of modern conveniences, and mainline groups (such as the Church of the Brethren and the Brethren Church) who are assimilated into popular culture and society. 

In German-speaking Europe, the Brethren became known as , in distinction from the English Baptist groups with whom they had no formal ties. In the United States, they became popularly known as &quot;Dunkers&quot;, &quot;Dunkard Brethren&quot;, or &quot;Tunkers&quot;, terms that stem from the German verb (), .

==History==
The Schwarzenau Brethren were first organized in 1708 under the leadership of Alexander Mack (1679–1735) in the Schwarzenau, Wittgenstein community of modern-day Bad Berleburg, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany. They believed that the Roman Catholic, Lutheran and Reformed churches were taking extreme liberties with the true, pure message of Christianity as revealed in the New Testament. As they began to have the New Testament available in German and read it for themselves, they rejected the established state church liturgies and sacraments, including infant baptism and Eucharistic practices in favor of following plain New Testament practices. The founding Brethren were broadly influenced by Radical Pietism understandings of an invisible church of awakened Christians who would fellowship together in purity and love, reaching out to the lost and hurting in Jesus&#x27; name and working together as equal brethren while awaiting Christ&#x27;s return.

A notable influence was Ernst Christopher Hochmann von Hochenau, a traveling Pietist minister. While living in Schriesheim, his home town, Mack invited Hochmann to come and minister there. Like others who influenced the Brethren, Hochmann considered the pure church to be spiritual, and did not believe that an organized church was necessary. By 1708, the date of the first Brethren baptisms, Mack had rejected this position in favor of forming a separate church with visible rules and ordinances—including threefold baptism of repentant adults by immersion, a Love Feast (that combined communion with feetwashing and an evening meal), anointing, and church discipline according to Matthew 18 culminating in use of the &quot;ban&quot; against members who fall into sin and refuse to repent.

Religious persecution drove the Brethren to take refuge in Friesland, the Netherlands. In 1719 Peter Becker brought a group to Pennsylvania. In 1720 forty Brethren families settled in Surhuisterveen in Friesland. They settled among the Mennonites and remained there until 1729, when all but a handful emigrated to America, in three separate groups from 1719 to 1733.

Peter Becker organized the first American congregation at Germantown, Pennsylvania, on December 25, 1723. In 1743 Christoph Sauer, an early pastor and a printer by trade, printed a Bible in German, the first published in a European language in North America.

Many members of the Schwarzenau Brethren came from the Southwest of Germany, the same region where the Pennsylvania German dialect originated. Because they settled in Pennsylvania among other Germans, who mainly came from the Palatinate and adjacent regions, they took part in the dialect leveling, that was the cradle of Pennsylvania German. Their language therefore was or soon became what today is called Pennsylvania Dutch or sometimes Pennsylvania German.

In 1782 the Brethren forbade slaveholding by its members. In 1871 these Brethren adopted the title German Baptist Brethren at their Annual Meeting. The group continued to expand and from Pennsylvania, they migrated chiefly westward. By 1908 they were most numerous in Pennsylvania, Maryland, Virginia, Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Iowa, Missouri, Nebraska, Kansas, North Dakota Arkansas, and California.

== Beliefs and practices ==


The beliefs of the &quot;Schwarzenau Brethren&quot; include triple or trine immersion baptism, which provides that the candidate kneel in water and be immersed, face first, three times in the name of God the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit; the New Testament as the infallible guide in spiritual matters; communion service celebrated in the evening, accompanied by the love feast; the ceremony of the washing of feet; the salutation of the holy kiss; prayer and anointing with oil over the sick; and nonresistance. See also The Brethren Card.

Some of the early &quot;Schwarzenau Brethren&quot; believed in &quot;universal restoration&quot;, a variant of universal salvation that foretold that after the judgment and harsh punishment described in the New Testament, God&#x27;s love would one day restore all souls to God. Brethren typically kept this teaching to themselves, and it was largely abandoned by the late nineteenth century. They were among the first to take Christian universalism to America when they emigrated there.

The church leaders are ministers, teachers, and deacons, though the name of these servant positions may differ slightly in the various branches. The official role of elder, while no longer recognized in many congregations, was formerly the most respected position in the church and performed the overseeing function that other churches may call Bishop. Ministers and deacons are elected by the members of the congregation in which they hold membership. Ministers preach the Word, baptize, assist deacons in anointing, solemnize marriages, and officiate at communion. Deacons serve the church by reading Scripture, leading in song and prayer, arranging for visitation to members or their families during illness or crisis, and often function in the capacity of stewards.

== Divisions ==
=== Early schisms ===
The first schism from the general body of German Baptist Brethren occurred in 1728. There were more divisions after the American Revolution, as different groups sought their own ways. The first separatists became the Seventh Day Dunkers, whose distinctive principle was that they believed that Saturday was true Sabbath. They were founded by German immigrant Johann Conrad Beissel (1690–1768).

In 1732, Beissel led establishment of a semi-monastic community with a convent and a monastery at Ephrata in what is now Lancaster County, Pennsylvania. While celibate, the community also welcomed believing families; they lived nearby and participated in joint worship. The monastic features and celibacy were gradually abandoned after the American Revolution.

In 1745, brothers Samuel, Israel and Gabriel Eckerlin protested against Beissel&#x27;s leadership after Beissel condemned them for having planted an orchard, built a mill and started a textile-manufacturing workshop in an effort to make the community economically self-sufficient. The Eckerlins and Mack left Ephrata in September to establish Mahanaim (Dunkard&#x27;s Bottom, Virginia) on the New River in western Virginia.

In 1814 the Society was incorporated as the Seventh Day Baptists or Seventh Day German Baptist Church. Several branches were established, some of which still exist. A group called the Church of God or &quot;New Dunkers&quot; withdrew in 1848. They disbanded in August 1962.

=== Old Order, Conservative, and mainline Schwarzenau Brethren ===
The Old Order Schwarzenau Brethren opposed 19th-century Brethren adoption of innovations in the United States such as revival meetings, Sunday Schools, and foreign missionary work. Stressing church discipline, Annual Meeting authority, and the preservation of the &quot;ancient order&quot; of church ordinances, worship, and simple unfashionable dress, they formed the Old German Baptist Brethren (OGBB) in 1881.

In 1882 the Progressives, who stressed outreach evangelism and objected to plain, distinctive dress and strong Annual Meeting authority, formed The Brethren Church, at the time of H. R. Holsinger. The largest body continued as German Baptist Brethren until 1908, when they adopted the title Church of the Brethren. Both the Brethren Church and the Church of the Brethren would be considered as mainline Schwarzaneu Brethren fellowships today.

The Dunkard Brethren Church, a conservative Schwarzenau Brethren denomination, maintains traditional theological beliefs and practices (such as plain dress and headcovering), while widely using modern conveniences. It was formed when conservative Schwarzenau Brethren withdrew from the Church of the Brethren in 1926 and established the Dunkard Brethren Church. As such, the Dunkard Brethren Church would fall in between Old Order Brethren (such as the Old Brethren German Baptist) and mainline Brethren denominations (such as The Brethren Church).

==== Divisions within Old Order fellowships ====
In 1913 and 1915 the Old Brethren, centered in Salida, California, Dayton, Ohio and Camden, Indiana, withdrew from the Old German Baptist Brethren (OGBB). In 1921, the Old Order German Baptist Brethren, centered in Dayton, Ohio broke with the OGBB. Attempts in 1929–1930 to reunite the Old Brethren and OGBB were unsuccessful.

The Old Brethren subsequently divided into two groups, the Old Order of which took the name of Old Brethren German Baptists and was centered in Camden, Indiana and Missouri.

After 1996, a small conservative group calling themselves The German Baptist Brethren split from the OGBB. The most recent split came in 2009, with the establishment of the Old German Baptist Brethren, New Conference, parishioners who left the OGBB.

==== Divisions within progressives ====
In 1939 the &quot;Progressive&quot; Brethren Church experienced another schism. Those seeking an open position to the issue of eternal security maintained the name Brethren Church, with headquarters in Ashland, Ohio (the traditional Anabaptist doctrine has been conditional security). Those supporting a Calvinistic firm affirmation of eternal security became the National Fellowship of Brethren Churches, since renamed Fellowship of Grace Brethren Churches (FGBC). It is commonly called the Grace Brethren Church, and is headquartered in Winona Lake, Indiana.

In 1992, because of doctrinal disagreements within the FGBC (primarily related to the connection between water baptism and church membership), the Conservative Grace Brethren Churches, International (CGBCI) was formed. It has no centralized headquarters at this time.

==== Divisions within conservatives ====
The paradigmatic conservative Schwarzenau Brethren denomination remains the Dunkard Brethren Church, in that they have preserved the distinctives of plain dress and headcovering while widely using modern conveniences. The Dunkard Brethren Church withdrew from the Church of the Brethren in 1926 because of what some believed was a gradual drift away from apostolic standards.

In 2019, after years of disagreement over New Testament standards of personal morality, some conservative congregations who were leaving the Church of the Brethren chose to form a new denomination called the Covenant Brethren Church. This fellowship has member congregations in Africa and Guatemala as well as the US states of Indiana, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Virginia, Washington and West Virginia. Unlike the Dunkard Brethren Church that formed in 1926, the Covenant Brethren Church encourages but does not universally practice traditional Brethren distinctives such as the veiling or nonresistance (nonparticipation in the military).

* Covenant Brethren Church (2019–)

Other associated churches which associate with the term German Baptist include:
*Brethren Reformed Church

== Brethren World Assembly ==
As of 2003, six Brethren bodies meet together in the Brethren World Assembly: Church of the Brethren, Conservative Grace Brethren Churches, International, Dunkard Brethren Church, Fellowship of Grace Brethren Churches, Old German Baptist Brethren, and The Brethren Church. The first Assembly was held in Pennsylvania in 1992. They met at Elizabethtown College and celebrated the 250th anniversary of the first known Brethren Annual Meeting in 1742. That first meeting gathered near Conestoga in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania. The second Assembly met in 1998 at Bridgewater College in Bridgewater, Virginia. The third Assembly was held by Grace College in Winona Lake, Indiana, in 2003. The Assembly represents some 600,000 members around the world.

== The Brethren&#x27;s Card ==
Brethren are noncreedal, but have summarized their beliefs in a variety of ways for the purpose of evangelical outreach. One such statement, developed and distributed during the late nineteenth century was the &quot;Brethren&#x27;s Card&quot;. A later version was endorsed for general distribution by the 1923 Church of the Brethren Annual Conference. Variations on the Card were used by both the Old German Baptist Brethren and the Church of the Brethren. This is an early version that was widely circulated:

Be it known unto all men,
#That there is a people who, as little children (), accept the Word of the New Testament as a message from heaven (Hebrews 1:1–2), and teach it in full (2 Timothy 4:1–2, Matthew 28:20).
#They baptize believers by trine immersion (Matthew 28:19), with a forward action (), and for the remission of sins (Acts 2:38), and lay hands on those baptized, asking upon them the gift of God&#x27;s Spirit (Acts 19:5–).
#They follow the command and example of washing one another&#x27;s feet ().
#They take the Lord&#x27;s Supper at night (), at one and the same time, tarrying one for another ().
#They greet one another with a holy kiss (, ).
#They take the communion at night, after supper, as did the Lord (, ).
#They teach all the doctrines of Christ, peace (), love (1 Corinthians 13), unity (Ephesians 4), both faith and works following (, Ephesians 2:8–10).
#They labor for nonconformity to the world in its vain and wicked customs (Romans 12:2).
#They advocate nonswearing (Matthew 5:34, 37), anti-secretism (2 Corinthians 6:14, 17), opposition to hatred, violence and war (Matthew 5:21–25 and 5:43–48, ), doing good unto all men (Matthew 5:44, 46).
#They anoint and lay hands on the sick ().
#They give the Bread of Life, the message of the common salvation offered unto all mankind without money or price ().
#Dear reader, for the above we contend earnestly, and you, with all men, are entreated to hear, to examine and accept it as the word, which began to be spoken by the Lord, and the faith once delivered to the saints ().

The 1923 version, influenced by both increasing formalism and by the Fundamentalist-modernist controversy of the 1910s differed in both tone and content:

#This body of Christians known as Brethren originated early in the eighteenth century: the church being a natural outgrowth of the Pietistic movement following the Reformation.
#Firmly accepts and teaches the fundamental evangelical doctrines of the inspiration of the Bible, the personality of the Holy Spirit, the virgin birth, the deity of Christ, the sin-pardoning value of his atonement, his resurrection from the tomb, ascension and personal and visible return; and the resurrection, both of the just and unjust (; ).
#Observes the following New Testament rites: Baptism of repentant believers by trine immersion for the remission of sins (Matthew 28:19, Acts 2:38); feet-washing (, ); love feast (, , , ); communion (); the holy Christian greeting or salutation (, ); proper modest appearance in worship (); the anointing with oil for healing in the name of the Lord (, ); laying on of hands (, ; ). These rites are representative of spiritual facts which obtain in the lives of true believers, and as such are essential factors in the development of the Christian life.
#Emphasizes: daily devotion for the individual, and family worship for the home (, ); stewardship of time, talents and money (); taking care of the fatherless, widows, poor, sick and aged ().
#Opposes on Scriptural grounds: War and the taking of human life (the Antithesis of the Law; , ); violence in personal and industrial controversy (Matthew 7:12, ); intemperance in all things (, , ); going to law, especially against our Christian brethren (); divorce and remarriage, (, , 1 Corinthians 7); every form of oath (Matthew 5:33–37, ); membership in secret societies (2 Corinthians 6:14–); games of chance and sinful amusements (, , ); extravagant and immodest dress (, ).
#Labors earnestly, in harmony with the Great Commission, for the evangelization of the world; for the conversion of men to Jesus Christ; and for the realization of the life and love of Jesus Christ living in every true believer (Matthew 28:18–20, , ).
#Maintains the New Testament as its only creed, in harmony with which the above brief doctrinal statement is made.

This version was officially circulated by the Church of the Brethren in its publications until the middle part of the twentieth century, and it continues to be issued through the efforts of Brethren Revival Fellowship.

The teachings of some other groups are similar to this, but can differ widely in emphasis and scope. For example, the Grace Brethren are varied on the requirement of trine immersion, do not practice the Christian salutation, do not oppose war, and do not formally adhere to plain dress or modesty. Only the Conservative Grace Brethren Churches have retained a published use of the motto, &quot;The Bible, the whole Bible, and nothing but the Bible&quot;.

In the progressive and liberal Church of the Brethren, significant emphasis is placed on social action issues. In the Brethren (Ashland) and Grace Brethren groups, significant emphasis is placed on exegesis of the Bible. Several of the groups maintain a larger &quot;Doctrinal Statement&quot; or treatise, but only for the purpose of clarifying their Biblical position.

Most Brethren groups maintain that the Bible is the sole authority and will revise their statement of faith if they perceive any difference between it and sound Biblical doctrine. Some of the Old Order groups incorporate church authority as a mechanism for unifying the interpretation and application of Biblical teachings.

== Unrelated groups ==

There are several religious groups named Brethren that are not related to the Schwarzenau Brethren movement. The Moravian Brethren, Hutterian Brethren and Swiss Brethren are not related to the Schwarzenau Brethren, except as inspirational examples. The Plymouth Brethren arose in England and Ireland early in the 19th century. The United Brethren originated in 18th-century Pennsylvania with William Otterbein and Martin Boehm. The River Brethren movement adopted the view of trine immersion and most other Anabaptist beliefs and practices from the Schwarzenau Brethren. Today, the Old Order River Brethren are very similar to the Old Brethren—both being part of the Anabaptist tradition. 

The Apostolic United Brethren is a group within the Latter Day Saint movement and is not related to the Schwarzenau Brethren.

Schwarzenau Brethren (German Baptists), an Anabaptist tradition, are not to be confused with non-Anabaptist groups such as Primitive, Separate, Southern, Particular, who are categorized as Baptists. Although both Anabaptists and Baptists agree on rudimentary doctrines such as believer&#x27;s baptism and separation of church and state, they would have conflicting views in other areas, such as non-resistance, separation from worldly entertainment, literal interpretation of the Sermon on the Mount, etc. In addition, Schwarzenau Brethren are not to be confused with a recent, small, renewal movement of &quot;Plain,&quot; or &quot;Covered&quot; Baptists, who share many comparable beliefs and practices with the historic German Baptists, but are of different origins.

<text>Hanna Holborn Gray (born October 25, 1930) is an American historian of Renaissance and Reformation political thought and Professor of History &quot;Emerita&quot; at the University of Chicago. She served as president of the University of Chicago, from 1978 to 1993, having earlier served as president pro tempore of Yale University in 1977–1978. At both schools, she was the first woman to hold their highest executive office. When named to the post in Chicago, she became one of the first women in the United States to hold the full presidency of a major university.

==Biography==
Holborn was born in Heidelberg, Germany, the daughter of Hajo Holborn, a professor of European history at Yale who fled to America from Nazi Germany, and Annemarie Bettmann, a philologist. Her older brother, Frederick, became a White House aide and professor of foreign policy at Johns Hopkins&#x27; School of Advanced International Studies. 

Gray attended The Foote School in New Haven, Connecticut (graduated 1943), Sidwell Friends School in Washington, D.C., Hopkins School in New Haven, then Bryn Mawr College in suburban Philadelphia, from which she graduated in 1950. She traveled to Oxford as a Fulbright Scholar. She earned a PhD from Harvard University in 1957, and taught there, becoming an assistant professor in 1959. At Harvard, her experiences were circumscribed by her &quot;outsider status&quot; as a woman. Although technically coeducational in some graduate programs by the 1950s, women were mostly relegated to the &quot;separate, but not equal&quot; Radcliffe College. When Gray became the first and only woman tutor in history and literature, she was reluctantly allowed into the tutor&#x27;s dining society but was distinctly unwelcome by the other tutors. Similarly, when Gray advanced to instructor, as a woman, she was forbidden in the main faculty hall and was required to enter through the side door, although she decided to just go in the front door, anyway. (She took her cue from Harvard professor, Helen Maud Cam, who earlier in the decade became the first woman to attend faculty morning services in the over 300 years of the institution just by showing up every day and sitting down).

Gray moved to Chicago when her husband was appointed to a position at the University of Chicago. She spent her first year as a research fellow at the Newberry Library, and then began teaching history at Chicago earning tenure in 1964. From 1966 to 1970, she was co-editor of the &quot;Journal of Modern History&quot; with her husband. Gray was named dean of the College of Arts and Sciences at Northwestern University in 1972 and became professor of history and provost at Yale University in 1974. She served as acting president of Yale for fourteen months after President Kingman Brewster unexpectedly accepted an appointment as United States Ambassador to the Court of St. James&#x27;s. 

Gray then returned to the University of Chicago, serving as president from 1978 to 1993, the first female (full) president of a major university in the United States. In 1991, she was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom. She retired in June 1993 but remains &quot;Harry Pratt Judson Distinguished Service Professor Emerita&quot;.

Gray has also served as a director, board member or trustee of the Harvard Corporation, the Yale Corporation, the Smithsonian Institution, JP Morgan Chase, the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, the Marlboro School of Music, the Council on Foreign Relations, the Concord Coalition, the Mayo Clinic, the Brookings Institution, and Bryn Mawr College. Gray has received honorary degrees from more than sixty institutions, including the University of Chicago, The College of William and Mary, Harvard, Oxford, Yale, Brown, Columbia, Princeton, and Duke. She served as chairman of the board of the second largest foundation in America, the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, until 2010. The portrait of Gray that hangs at the University of Chicago has been &quot;stolen&quot; (and returned) on more than one occasion as a student prank. Gray published a memoir, &quot;An Academic Life&quot;, in 2018.

<doc id="366656" wikidata="Q1628849" url="?curid=366656" title="USS Wahoo (SS-238)">
<text>USS &quot;Wahoo&quot; (SS-238) was a , the first United States Navy ship to be named for the wahoo. Construction started before the U.S. entered World War II, and she was commissioned after entry. &quot;Wahoo&quot; was assigned to the Pacific theatre. She gained fame as an aggressive and highly successful submarine after Lieutenant Commander Dudley Walker &quot;Mush&quot; Morton became her skipper. She was sunk by Japanese aircraft in October 1943 while returning home from a patrol in the Sea of Japan.

== Construction ==

&quot;Wahoo&quot;″s keel was laid down 28 June 1941 at the Mare Island Navy Yard, Vallejo, California. She was launched on 14 February 1942 (sponsored by Mrs. William C. Barker Jr.), and commissioned on 15 May 1942 with Lieutenant Commander (LCDR) Marvin G. &quot;Pinky&quot; Kennedy (Class of 1929) in command. Lieutenant Richard O&#x27;Kane joined the precommissioning crew and served as her executive officer (XO) on five war patrols under Kennedy and Morton (O&#x27;Kane later received a Medal of Honor for his service in ).

Following fitting out and initial training along the California coast (which took her as far south as San Diego), &quot;Wahoo&quot; departed Mare Island on 12 August for Hawaii. She arrived at Pearl Harbor on 18 August and underwent exercise training until 21 August.

== First patrol, August – October 1942 ==
On 23 August 1942 &quot;Wahoo&quot; got underway for her first war patrol, seeking Japanese shipping in waters west of Truk, particularly in the area between the Hall Islands and the Namonuito Atoll. On 6 September, her third day in the area, &quot;Wahoo&quot; fired three Mark 14 torpedoes at her first target, a lone freighter; all missed, and the ship turned toward &quot;Wahoo&quot;, apparently with the intent to ram. The submarine dodged, fearful of counterattack from the air.

She continued to patrol the Truk area until 20 September, when she decided to leave the southwest part of the patrol area and explore south of the Namonuito Atoll. Under a bright moon and clear sky, the submarine sighted a freighter and her escort. &quot;Wahoo&quot; fired three torpedoes; all missed. A fourth hit the target, which was thought to take a port list and settled by the stern. Four minutes later, a series of three underwater explosions wracked the freighter. &quot;Wahoo&quot; was chased by the escort but escaped by radically changing course in a rain squall. Though credited at the time with a freighter of , postwar analysis of Japanese shipping records by JANAC showed no sinking at this time or place.

&quot;Wahoo&quot; continued her patrol and sighted several airplanes, a patrol boat, and a tender but was unable to close on any possible targets. On 1 October 1942, the submarine extended her patrol to Ulul Island, where she sighted several fishing boats. Within the next few days, &quot;Wahoo&quot; missed two of her best targets of the war. The first was (listed as a seaplane tender, she was in fact a mother ship to midget submarines), sailing without escort; &quot;Wahoo&quot; proved unable to reach a firing position. On 5 October, she sighted an aircraft carrier, believed to be , escorted by two destroyers. (In fact, &quot;Ryūjō&quot; had been sunk six weeks earlier in the Solomon Islands). Due to an approach lacking aggressiveness and skill, the target sailed away untouched. Two days later, &quot;Wahoo&quot; departed the patrol area. On 16 October, she made rendezvous with her escort and proceeded to Pearl Harbor, where she ended her first patrol on 17 October 1942.

She commenced refit the following day alongside submarine tender . &quot;Wahoo&quot; then shifted to Submarine Base Pearl Harbor for overhaul. There, a gun and two 20 mm guns were installed. Overhaul was completed on 2 November and, after three days&#x27; training, &quot;Wahoo&quot; was again ready for sea.

== Second patrol, November – December 1942 ==
On 8 November 1942, &quot;Wahoo&quot; got underway for her second war patrol, with Lieutenant Commander Dudley Walker &quot;Mush&quot; Morton also aboard for his prospective commanding officer (PCO) patrol. She arrived at her assigned area in the Solomon Islands, keeping Bougainville and Buka Island in sight. On 30 November, the submarine spotted smoke at a distance of ; it was a lightly loaded freighter or transport with an escorting destroyer on the port bow. &quot;Wahoo&quot;″s approach was unsuccessful, and she proceeded east of Cape Hanpan.

Having patrolled the Buka-Kilinailau Channel for 17 days, on 7 December, Kennedy decided to patrol the direct route between Truk and the Shortland Islands for a few days. This proved fruitless, and &quot;Wahoo&quot; returned to her former hunting grounds, the Buka-Kilinailau Channel. On 10 December, while making her return trip, &quot;Wahoo&quot; ran across a convoy of three heavily loaded cargo ships escorted by a destroyer. She chose the destroyer as the first target, but proved unable to attain a firing position. Instead, she fired a spread of four torpedoes at the largest tanker, from a range of . Although three hit, it took two hours for &quot;Kamoi Maru&quot; () to sink. The destroyer got too close and &quot;Wahoo&quot; started down before another attack could be launched. The destroyer dropped approximately 40 depth charges, none close. Rather than use the new SJ radar to mount a second attack, which might well sink the freighter (then stopped to pick up survivors), and possibly even the destroyer, &quot;Wahoo&quot; let them go on a northeasterly course and moved into a new area.

Four days later, a hospital ship was sighted headed for the Shortland Islands. Shortly after, &quot;Wahoo&quot; claimed to have sunk a submarine that Kennedy (mistakenly) identified as . On 15 December, &quot;Wahoo&quot; left the area and looked into Kieta Harbor, Buka Island, and passed Moreton Light on 26 December for entrance into Brisbane, Australia, where she commenced refit the following day. On 31 December 1942, Lt. Cmdr. Kennedy was relieved as commanding officer; Morton replaced him.

== Third patrol, January – February 1943 ==

Prior to his first patrol as &quot;Wahoo&quot;&#x27;s commanding officer, Morton gave a brief but legendary address to the crew. He declared the &quot;Wahoo&quot; to be expendable, and that any crew member who wanted to remain in Brisbane had half an hour to notify the yeoman for a transfer. There would be no negative word said about anyone who stayed behind. None of the crew accepted the offer to stay behind.

&quot;Wahoo&quot; was ready for sea again on 16 January 1943. She performed sonar tests in Moreton Bay with the destroyer before beginning her third war patrol. Three days later, the submarine passed into Vitiaz Strait &quot;en route&quot; to her patrol area. &quot;Wahoo&quot;″s orders were to reconnoiter Wewak, a Japanese supply base on the north coast of New Guinea between Kairiru Island and Mushu Island. There was one large problem: &quot;Wahoo&quot; had no charts of the harbor. However, it turned out that Motor Machinist&#x27;s Mate Dalton &quot;Bird Dog&quot; Keeter had bought a cheap school atlas while in Australia. It had a map of New Guinea with a small indentation labeled &quot;Wewak&quot;. With that as a reference, a blowup of the Navy chart was made.

On 24 January 1943, &quot;Wahoo&quot; dove north of Kairiru Island and proceeded around the western end to penetrate Victoria Bay. She sighted the Japanese destroyer with &quot;RO&quot;-class submarines nested alongside. The destroyer was getting underway, so &quot;Wahoo&quot; fired a spread of three torpedoes at the moving target from ; all missed aft. Another torpedo was fired, which the destroyer avoided by turning away, continuing through 270 degrees of a circle and headed straight for &quot;Wahoo&quot;, whose position was marked by the wakes of the steam torpedoes. At a range of she fired her last bow torpedo. This hit amidships, breaking the destroyer&#x27;s back.&quot;Apparently her skipper had lost his nerve when he saw our last torpedo heading toward him and put the rudder over to try to miss it, and by swinging himself broadside to it he signed the destroyer&#x27;s death warrant.&quot; &quot;Wahoo&quot; had no difficulty escaping from the area. Despite heavy damage, &quot;Harusame&quot; was beached and repaired.

The next day, &quot;Wahoo&quot; changed course for Palau. On 26 January, the submarine sighted the smoke of two ships. &quot;Wahoo&quot; obtained a position, launched two torpedoes at the leading ship and, 17 seconds later, two at the second ship. The first two torpedoes hit the &quot;Fukuei Maru&quot;. The third passed ahead of the second freighter, the fourth hit. Upon observing the damage, &quot;Wahoo&quot; discovered there were two more ships; a huge transport, &quot;Buyo Maru&quot;, and a tanker. &quot;Fukuei Maru&quot; was listing badly to starboard and sinking by the stern; the second ship was headed directly for &quot;Wahoo&quot;, at a slow speed. Ignoring this, &quot;Wahoo&quot; fired a three-torpedo spread at the transport; the second and third hit and stopped her.

Turning her attention to the second target, which was still headed for her, &quot;Wahoo&quot; fired two bow tubes &quot;down the throat&quot; to stop her. The second torpedo hit, but the target kept coming and forced the submarine to turn hard to port at full speed to avoid being rammed. There followed so many explosions that it was hard to tell what was happening. Returning to periscope depth, &quot;Wahoo&quot; observed &quot;Fukuei Maru&quot; had sunk; the second target was still moving, evidently with steering trouble; and &quot;Buyo Maru&quot; was stopped but still afloat.

&quot;Wahoo&quot; headed for the transport and fired a bow tube; the torpedo passed directly under the middle of the ship but failed to explode. The sub then fired another torpedo which headed right for the stack and blew the target apart midships. The submarine then headed for the crippled freighter, which had formed up with a tanker, and both ships were moving away. &quot;Wahoo&quot; decided to let these two ships get over the horizon, while she surfaced to charge her batteries and attack the shipwrecked Japanese now sitting in about twenty lifeboats. Controversy still attaches to this action in that troops in the water may have been deliberately targeted by &quot;Wahoo&quot;. Vice Admiral Charles A. Lockwood, then COMSUBPAC, asserts that the survivors were army troops and turned machinegun and rifle fire on &quot;Wahoo&quot; while she maneuvered on the surface, and that such resistance was common in submarine warfare. Richard O&#x27;Kane stated that the fire from &quot;Wahoo&quot; was intended to force the troops to abandon their boats and no troops were deliberately targeted. Clay Blair states that Morton opened fire first and the shipwrecked returned fire with handguns.

The report for Patrol Three described the events as follows:At 1115 ...Decided to let these two ship[s] get over the horizon while we surfaced to charge batteries and destroy the estimate[d] twenty troop boats now in the water. These boats were of many types, scows, motor launches, cabin cruisers and other nondescript varieties.

At 1315 made battle surface and manned all guns. Fired gun at largest scow loaded with troops. Although all troops in this boat apparently jumped in the water our fire was returned by small caliber machine guns. We then opened fire with everything we had...Whatever the case, &quot;Wahoo&quot; had misidentified the survivors as Japanese. In fact, they were mainly Indian POWs of 2nd Battalion, 16th Punjab Regiment, plus escorting forces from the Japanese 26th Field Ordnance Depot. Of 1,126 men aboard &quot;Buyo Maru&quot;, 195 Indians and 87 Japanese died in all, including those killed in the initial sinking. The low number suggests O&#x27;Kane&#x27;s defense, that Morton fired only on the boats, may be correct. It proved a rare occurrence in any event.

After some time, &quot;Wahoo&quot; moved away to intercept the two fleeing ships. She decided to attack the tanker first since she was as yet undamaged. With only four torpedoes left, the submarine fired two at the tanker, the second hitting her just abaft of midships, breaking her back; she went down almost instantly. &quot;Wahoo&quot; then turned her attention to the freighter and fired her last two torpedoes without a spread. They both hit. Fifteen minutes later, the freighter sank, having absorbed four hits from three separate attacks. &quot;Wahoo&quot; then set a course for Fais Island. Postwar, JANAC credited &quot;Wahoo&quot; with only three sinkings: the transport, &quot;Buyo Maru&quot; (5,300 tons), &quot;Fukuei Maru&quot; (), and an unknown &quot;maru&quot; ().

On 27 January 1943, &quot;Wahoo&quot; made contact with a convoy of eight ships, including two freighters and a tanker. Morton proposed a novel attack. The tanker was unarmed and appeared to be having trouble maintaining convoy speed. Morton decided to surface astern of this ship, which would panic the convoy and cause it to scatter. After the convoy broke up, &quot;Wahoo&quot; would use her deck gun to sink the tanker.

Morton&#x27;s plan worked, up to a point. She surfaced and the convoy scattered, but before Morton could have the deck gun manned a Japanese destroyer escort charged out of a rain squall onto the scene, forcing &quot;Wahoo&quot; to run for it. The submarine had no option but to retreat since she had previously expended all torpedoes. After coming into firing range and opening fire on &quot;Wahoo&quot;, forcing her under, the persistent destroyer escort dropped six depth charges, none close. It was on this occasion that Morton transmitted the famous message: &quot;Another running gun battle today. Destroyer gunning, &quot;Wahoo&quot; running&quot;.

The next day, &quot;Wahoo&quot; sighted Fais Island, and her plan to shell a phosphorite refinery was scrapped due to the untimely appearance of an inter-island steamer.

The submarine left station and arrived at Pearl Harbor on 7 February, only 23 days after leaving Brisbane (most patrols were in the 60‑ to 75‑day range). Prior to entering the naval base, &quot;Wahoo&quot; donned topside embellishments to celebrate her victory. A straw broom was lashed to her periscope shears to indicate a clean sweep. From the signal halyard fluttered eight tiny Japanese flags, one for each Japanese ship believed to have been sunk by &quot;Wahoo&quot; to that point in the war.

&quot;Wahoo&quot; commenced refit by a tender relief crew and the ship&#x27;s crew. On 15 February, refit was completed, and the submarine was declared ready for sea on 17 February. She then conducted two days of training and was drydocked at the Submarine Base, Pearl Harbor, on 21 February.

== Fourth patrol, February – April 1943 ==
On 23 February 1943, &quot;Wahoo&quot; got underway for Midway Island, where she arrived four days later, topped off her fuel tanks, and headed for her patrol area. For &quot;Wahoo&quot;″s fourth patrol, Morton was assigned to the extreme northern reaches of the Yellow Sea, in the vicinity of the Yalu River and Dairen, an area never before patrolled by U.S. submarines. One reason for this was the water was shallow, averaging . While &quot;en route&quot; to her patrol area, she conducted training dives, fire control drills, and battle surface drills. She had the unique experience of making the entire passage to the East China Sea without sighting a single aircraft, thus making most of the trip surfaced. On 11 March, &quot;Wahoo&quot; arrived in her assigned area along the Nagasaki-Formosa and Shimonoseki-Formosa shipping routes.

On 19 March 1943, the shooting began with a freighter identified as &quot;Zogen Maru&quot;. A single torpedo hit broke the target in two; the aft end sank immediately, and the bow sank two minutes later. There were no survivors. Four hours later, &quot;Wahoo&quot; sighted another freighter, &quot;Kowa Maru&quot;, and launched two torpedoes. The first hit under the target&#x27;s foremast with a terrific blast, leaving a tremendous hole in her side, but the bow remained intact. The second torpedo hit amidships, but it was a dud and did not explode. Two more torpedoes were fired, but the freighter maneuvered to avoid them.

&quot;Wahoo&quot; then patrolled off the Korean coast, just south of Chinnampo. On 21 March, she sighted a large freighter identified as &quot;Hozen Maru&quot;. She launched three torpedoes; the third hit the target amidships. She went down by the bow, sinking in four minutes, leaving approximately 33 survivors clinging to the debris.

Four hours later, &quot;Wahoo&quot; sighted the freighter &quot;Nittsu Maru&quot;. The submarine fired a spread of three torpedoes; two hit, one under the bridge and the other under the mainmast. The ship went down in three minutes. &quot;Wahoo&quot; surfaced and ran over one of the lifeboats, knocking the survivors into the frigid waters. A deck gun was used to kill the swimmers. Four survivors ignored all efforts to rescue them. After collecting a few souvenirs from the scattered wreckage, &quot;Wahoo&quot; commenced a surfaced patrol, heading for Shantung Promontory. On 22 March, the submarine headed for the Laotiehshan Promontory, close to Port Arthur.

The following day, as &quot;Wahoo&quot; patrolled Laotiehshan Channel (also known as &quot;Sampan Alley&quot;), she found herself surrounded by targets. &quot;Wahoo&quot; sighted a medium-size ship, apparently a freighter, the collier &quot;Katyosan Maru&quot;, and launched one torpedo. This hit the target just under her bridge, immediately enveloping the target in a screen of coal dust. The &quot;maru&quot; settled fast and slowed down, vanishing in 13 minutes.

&quot;Wahoo&quot; set course for a point to the northeast of Round Island, in Korea Bay, 50 km southeast of Dairen. In the vicinity of the approaches to this port, the deepest water is about , with an average depth of only .

At 12:47 on 24 March, &quot;Wahoo&quot; sighted smoke and began to make her approach. At 19:49, she fired a spread of three torpedoes at a large tanker (identified as &quot;Takaosan Maru&quot;) which was fully loaded with fuel oil. The first two torpedoes exploded prematurely, and the third one missed. &quot;Wahoo&quot; fired a fourth torpedo which also missed. The target commenced firing deck guns at the American warship. The submarine surfaced after 14 minutes of ducking shots, gained position ahead, and dove. She fired another three-torpedo spread. One hit the engine room and sank the ship in four minutes.

The next day, &quot;Wahoo&quot; sighted the freighter &quot;Satsuki Maru&quot;. She launched two torpedoes; when both exploded prematurely, &quot;Wahoo&quot; &quot;battle surfaced&quot; to use her deck guns. She closed the target, raked her with 20 mm shells and struck her with almost 90 rounds of four-inch shells. The target caught fire in several places and sank in about one hour.

&quot;Wahoo&quot; left the following morning to investigate a ship on the horizon. This target proved to be a small diesel-driven freighter. The submarine commenced firing with her 20 mm and four-inch deck guns. The freighter tried to ram her, but &quot;Wahoo&quot; maneuvered clear, and then continued firing at the target, setting her ablaze from stem to stern, and leaving her dead in the water. The crew took turns looking through the periscope as the freighter sank.

Later that day, &quot;Wahoo&quot; sighted a trawler Bonshu Maru 95 and again attacked with her deck guns. When all three of her 20 mm guns jammed, the &quot;Wahoo&quot; went alongside the riddled trawler and the sailors of &quot;Wahoo&quot; hurled homemade Molotov cocktails (gifts from the U.S. Marines at Midway Atoll) onto the trawler. &quot;Wahoo&quot; departed, leaving the fishing boat wrecked, spouting flame and smoke.

On 28 March, while on the surface astride the Shimonoseki-Formosa shipping route, &quot;Wahoo&quot; opened fire with two 20 mm guns on two motor sampans. The targets did not sink but they were also left in a wrecked condition.

On the following day, &quot;Wahoo&quot; sighted the freighter &quot;Yamabato Maru&quot; and fired two of her stern torpedo tubes. The first torpedo hit at the point of aim under the mainmast and completely disintegrated everything abaft her stack. The forward section sank in two minutes. The second torpedo was aimed at the foremast, but it missed because the first torpedo stopped the freighter in her tracks.

&quot;Wahoo&quot; surfaced, transited the Collnett Strait, and headed home, concluding a war patrol which topped the record to date in number of ships sunk. The American submarine command in Pearl Harbor reported that the &quot;Japanese think a submarine wolf pack operating in Yellow Sea. All shipping tied up.&quot;

Meanwhile, the United States mounted its offensive against Attu, and Admiral Mineichi Koga returned his major units from Truk to Tokyo Bay via a sortie to Alaska. Forewarned by American codebreakers that the Japanese intended to counter the invasion of Attu by a major sortie of the I.J.N. fleet, sent his top sub, &quot;Wahoo&quot;, to the Kuril Islands to intercept it.

On 6 April 1943, &quot;Wahoo&quot; arrived at Midway, and she commenced a refit on the following day. On 21–22 April, she conducted training underway and was declared ready for sea on 25 April.

== Fifth patrol, April – May 1943 ==
&quot;Wahoo&quot; began her fifth war patrol on 25 April, departing Midway under air escort for patrol areas via the Kuril Islands. The following day, she patrolled the surface and reconnoitered Matsuwa, taking photographs of the enemy installations, exploring southwest along the island chain and finding the islands barren and completely covered with snow and ice.

On 4 May, &quot;Wahoo&quot; proceeded to reconnoiter the northeast tip of Etorofu Island; she found nothing and changed course to the southeast. Morton positioned the boat to intercept the seaplane tender . The submarine submerged and fired a spread of three torpedoes. The first hit between the stack and bridge; the other two missed. &quot;Kimikawa&quot; turned away and was making , with a slight list. The ship is sometimes misidentified as . &quot;Wahoo&quot; continued on an easterly course, surfaced and continued her patrol of the Kurils southward.

Three days later, &quot;Wahoo&quot; sighted two ships hugging the shoreline on a northerly course, off the Benten Saki coast, and dove. She launched two torpedoes at the leading ship, followed immediately by a spread of four at the escort. The first torpedo hit the leading ship, &quot;Tamon Maru #5&quot;, under the stack and broke her back; the second missed ahead. The escort successfully avoided all four torpedoes fired at her and then escaped. The &quot;Tamon Maru&quot; () sank, and &quot;Wahoo&quot; proceeded down the coast.

The submarine submerged off Kobe Zaki and sighted a three-ship convoy consisting of two escort vessels and a large naval auxiliary. &quot;Wahoo&quot; fired a spread of three torpedoes; two exploded prematurely, the third failed to explode. This ship got away, and &quot;Wahoo&quot; was forced down by the escorts.

On the night of 9 May 1943, &quot;Wahoo&quot; proceeded up the coast with the intention of closing Kone Saki. Radar picked up two targets, soon identified as a large tanker and a freighter in column, evidently making the night run between ports without an escort. The submarine fired a spread of three torpedoes at the tanker and immediately thereafter a three torpedo spread at the freighter. &quot;Wahoo&quot; had two successful hits, and both ships went down; &quot;Takao Maru&quot; () and &quot;Jinmu Maru&quot; ().

&quot;Wahoo&quot; cleared the area to the northeast in order to patrol the Tokyo-Paramushiro route; on 12 May, she sighted two freighters. She dove to gain position for a &quot;two ship&quot; shot where they would come by in column. She launched four torpedoes from , but got only one hit. Morton fired his last two torpedoes. Nothing was seen of the first. The second hit under the bridge with a dull thud, much louder than the duds heard only on sonar but lacking the &quot;whacking&quot; noise which accompanies a wholehearted explosion. The other freighter opened fire with their deck guns and charged &quot;Wahoo&quot;. Both ships got away. &quot;Wahoo&quot; cleared the area to the east and set course for Pearl Harbor.

&quot;Wahoo&quot;&#x27;s fifth war patrol was again considered outstanding in aggressiveness and efficiency. In ten action-packed days &quot;Wahoo&quot; delivered ten torpedo attacks on eight different targets. However, faulty torpedo performance cut positive results by as much as one-half.

In these last three patrols, &quot;Wahoo&quot; established a record not only in damage inflicted on the enemy for three successive patrols, but also for accomplishing this feat in the shortest time on patrol: a total of sunk and damaged in only 25 patrol days.

&quot;Wahoo&quot; arrived at Pearl Harbor on 21 May 1943. The next day, Admiral Chester W. Nimitz, the CINCPAC, came on board and presented awards. Two days later, the submarine departed for the Mare Island Navy Yard, where she arrived 29 May to commence overhaul. From 11–20 July, the submarine underwent intensive post-repair trials and training. On 20 July, squadron commander Captain John B. Griggs, Jr., came aboard and presented more awards. On the following day, &quot;Wahoo&quot; departed for Pearl Harbor, furnishing services for surface and air forces while &quot;en route&quot;. She arrived at Hawaii on 27 July 1943 and departed on 2 August for her patrol area. Four days later, &quot;Wahoo&quot; arrived at Midway Island, but she left on the same day.

== Sixth patrol, August 1943 ==
On 13 August, &quot;Wahoo&quot; entered the Sea of Okhotsk, having completed the passage through the Etorofu Strait. She arrived in the Sea of Japan the following day and sighted three medium freighters headed south. The submarine launched one torpedo at the trailing ship; it missed. The next day (15 August), while still on the trail of those three freighters, &quot;Wahoo&quot; sighted a large freighter on a northerly course. Deciding to attack the larger, single target, the submarine broke off the pursuit of the three freighters, surfaced, and commenced tracking the new target, diving to make a submerged approach. &quot;Wahoo&quot; launched one torpedo; it hit at the point of aim but was a dud. She fired two more torpedoes. Both missed. &quot;Wahoo&quot; then swung around to bring her stern torpedo tubes to bear and headed directly for the target. The submarine fired another torpedo which missed and must have broached and exploded before the end of the run. &quot;Wahoo&quot; soon sighted an &quot;Otori&quot;-class torpedo boat and commenced evasive action, letting the large freighter escape. She decided to move over on the Hokkaidō-Korea shipping route and spend the night and the following day transiting to that area.

On 16 August, &quot;Wahoo&quot; sighted a freighter headed south, but made another contact in a better position for attack. Shifting targets, she launched one torpedo at a medium-sized freighter. It missed. The next day, the scene was repeated with the same results. No pursuit was undertaken, in hopes of a loaded target heading south. However, &quot;Wahoo&quot; sighted a freighter heading north in ballast and commenced a submerged approach. Morton launched one torpedo which missed. Just as the torpedo left its tube, a southbound freighter passed close aboard this target, but the torpedo missed. &quot;Wahoo&quot; then surfaced and chased the southbound freighter. While pursuing this ship, the submarine sighted another target well ahead and away from the coast, so she again shifted targets. While tracking this new target, she passed two small northbound ships – one looked like a tug and the other resembled a tanker. &quot;Wahoo&quot; made a submerged approach and launched a torpedo at the medium-sized freighter. It was a miss. She fired again; still a miss, but this torpedo, probably broaching, exploded. The submarine surfaced and headed further out to sea.

Within four days, twelve Japanese vessels were sighted; nine were hunted down and attacked to no avail. Ten torpedoes broached, made erratic runs, or were duds. In light of the poor torpedo performance, ComSubPac ordered &quot;Wahoo&quot; to return to base.

On 19 August, the submarine sighted a ship and commenced tracking, but she withheld her fire when her crew recognized the flag as Soviet (an ally of the United States at the time). &quot;Wahoo&quot; made for La Perouse Strait. The next day, she sighted a sampan and fired warning shots across the bow. When the sampan failed to stop, the submarine opened up on it with her 20 mm and four-inch guns. The sampan was soon a wreck. Six Japanese fishermen surrendered and were taken on board as prisoners of war. Eight hours later, &quot;Wahoo&quot; opened fire on two more sampans, enveloping them in flames. Members of the crews jumped overboard but showed no desire to be rescued. &quot;Wahoo&quot; completed the passage of Etorofu Strait, and then arrived at Midway on 25 August. She immediately got underway for Pearl Harbor, and she arrived there on 29 August.

== Seventh patrol and loss, September–October 1943 ==
Morton, smarting from that last luckless patrol, asked to return to the Sea of Japan, and permission was granted. He elected to take a full load of the newly arrived Mark 18 electric torpedo rather than take the risk that further production runs of the Mark 14 steam torpedoes might still be defective. &quot;Wahoo&quot; got underway from Pearl Harbor, topped off fuel and supplies at Midway on 13 September, and headed for La Perouse Strait. The plan was to enter the Sea of Japan first, on or about 20 September, with following by a few days. At sunset on 21 October, &quot;Wahoo&quot; was supposed to leave her assigned area, south of the 43rd parallel, and head for home. She was instructed to report by radio after she passed through the Kurils. Nothing further was ever heard from &quot;Wahoo&quot;.

On 25 September 1943 the &quot;Taiko Maru&quot; was torpedoed in the Sea of Japan; mistakenly credited to the , she was apparently sunk by &quot;Wahoo&quot;.
On 5 October, the Japanese news agency Domei announced to the world that a steamer, the &quot;Konron Maru&quot;, was sunk by an American submarine off the west coast of Honshū near Tsushima Strait, with the loss of 544 lives. The victims included two Japanese congressmen of the House of Representatives, Choichi Kato and Keishiro Sukekawa. Postwar reckoning by JANAC showed &quot;Wahoo&quot; sank three other ships for 5,300 tons, making a patrol total of four ships of about 13,000 long tons. The sinking of &quot;Konron Maru&quot; enraged the Japanese navy, and the Maizuru Naval District ordered a &#x27;search and destroy&#x27; operation for US submarines.

Japanese records also reported that on 11 October, the date &quot;Wahoo&quot; was due to exit through La Pérouse Strait in the morning, &quot;Wahoo&quot; was bombarded from Cape Sōya. An antisubmarine aircraft (likely an Aichi E13A floatplane) sighted a wake and an apparent oil slick from a submerged submarine. The Japanese initiated a combined air and sea attack with numerous bombs and depth charges throughout the day. &quot;Sawfish&quot; had been depth-charged by a patrol boat while transiting the strait two days before, and the enemy&#x27;s antisubmarine forces were on the alert; their attacks fatally holed &quot;Wahoo&quot;, and she sank with all hands. She was declared overdue on 2 December 1943 and stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 6 December 1943.

After the loss of &quot;Wahoo&quot;, no US submarines ventured into the Sea of Japan until June 1945, when special mine-detecting equipment became available.

&quot;Wahoo&quot; earned six battle stars for World War II service.

== The search for and discovery of &quot;Wahoo&quot; ==
&quot;Wahoo&quot; had long been believed to be resting in the Soya (La Pérouse) Strait between Hokkaidō, Japan and Sakhalin, Russia. Beginning in 1995, the Wahoo Project Group (an international team of Americans, Australians, Japanese, and Russians, and led by a relative of Commander Morton) searched for her based on the available evidence. Japanese Vice Admiral Kazuo Ueda, working with the Wahoo Project Group, examined the historical record and correctly predicted the location of &quot;Wahoo&quot; in 2006.

In 2005, electronic surveys in the region yielded what turned out to be a U.S. &quot;Gato&quot;-class submarine in the Strait; in July 2006, the Russian team &quot;Iskra&quot; investigated the site which contributed further evidence of location of &quot;Wahoo&quot;.

On 31 October 2006, the U.S. Navy confirmed that the images provided by the &quot;Iskra&quot; team are of &quot;Wahoo&quot;, the wreckage lying intact in about of water in the La Pérouse (Soya) Strait. The submarine was sunk by a direct hit from an aerial bomb near the conning tower.

On 8 July 2007, the U.S. Navy conducted a wreath-laying ceremony at sea for the crew of &quot;Wahoo&quot;. The ceremony was held on the confirmed site of the sinking of the submarine as a joint exercise with the Navy of the Russian Federation.

On 11 October 2007, the U.S. Navy held an official remembrance ceremony for the crew of &quot;Wahoo&quot;, conducted at the Submarine Museum and Park at Pearl Harbor, and followed by a presentation of the history of &quot;Wahoo&quot; search and discovery by the Wahoo Project Group.

In May 2024, the Russian Geographical Society demonstrated a video of the wreckage of the submarine and installed a commemorative underwater plaque, as well as a wreath with the inscription &quot;Russians remember&quot;.

<text>Jacobean embroidery refers to embroidery styles that flourished in the reign of King James I of England in first quarter of the 17th century.

The term is usually used today to describe a form of crewel embroidery used for furnishing characterized by fanciful plant and animal shapes worked in a variety of stitches with two-ply wool yarn on linen. Popular motifs in Jacobean embroidery, especially curtains for bed hangings, are the Tree of Life and stylized forests, usually rendered as exotic plants arising from a landscape or &quot;terra firma&quot; with birds, stags, squirrels, and other familiar animals.

==Origins==
Early Jacobean embroidery often featured scrolling floral patterns worked in colored silks on linen, a fashion that arose in the earlier Elizabethan era. Embroidered jackets were fashionable for both men and women in the period 1600-1620, and several of these jackets have survived.

==Designs==

Often based on tree of life imagery, curving branches with large flowers were a typical design. Early crewel embroideries exclusively used wool thread on linen (modern crewel embroidery encompasses a broader range with the only requirement being extensive use of crewel stitch variations).

==Legacy==
Jacobean embroidery was carried by British colonists to Colonial America, where it flourished. The Deerfield embroidery movement of the 1890s revived interest in colonial and Jacobean styles of embroidery.

<doc id="366662" wikidata="Q413690" url="?curid=366662" title="Acetazolamide">
<text>Acetazolamide, sold under the trade name Diamox among others, is a medication used to treat glaucoma, epilepsy, acute mountain sickness, periodic paralysis, idiopathic intracranial hypertension (raised brain pressure of unclear cause), heart failure and to alkalinize urine. It may be used long term for the treatment of open angle glaucoma and short term for acute angle closure glaucoma until surgery can be carried out. It is taken by mouth or injection into a vein. Acetazolamide is a first generation carbonic anhydrase inhibitor and it decreases the ocular fluid and osmolality in the eye to decrease intraocular pressure.
Common side effects include numbness, ringing in the ears, loss of appetite, vomiting, and sleepiness. It is not recommended in those with significant kidney problems, liver problems, or who are allergic to sulfonamides. Acetazolamide is in the diuretic and carbonic anhydrase inhibitor families of medication. It works by decreasing the formation of hydrogen ions and bicarbonate from carbon dioxide and water.
Acetazolamide came into medical use in 1952. It is on the World Health Organization&#x27;s List of Essential Medicines. Acetazolamide is available as a generic medication.

==Medical uses==
It is used in the treatment of glaucoma, drug-induced edema, heart failure-induced edema, epilepsy and in reducing intraocular pressure after surgery. It has also been used in the treatment of altitude sickness, Ménière&#x27;s disease, increased intracranial pressure and neuromuscular disorders. Acetazolamide is also used in the critical care setting to stimulate respiratory drive in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease as an off-label indication.

In epilepsy, the main use of acetazolamide is in menstrual-related epilepsy and as an add on to other treatments in refractory epilepsy. Though various websites on the internet report that acetazolamide can be used to treat dural ectasia in individuals with Marfan syndrome, the only supporting evidence for this assertion exists from a small study of 14 patients which was not peer-reviewed or submitted for publication. Several published cases of intracranial hypotension related to Marfan syndrome would warrant caution in using acetazolamide in these patients unless there is a clear indication, as it could lower intracranial pressure further. A 2012 review and meta-analysis found that there was &quot;limited supporting evidence&quot; but that acetazolamide &quot;may be considered&quot; for the treatment of central (as opposed to obstructive) sleep apnea.

It has also been used to prevent methotrexate-induced kidney damage by alkalinizing the urine, hence speeding up methotrexate excretion by increasing its solubility in urine. There is some evidence to support its use to prevent hemiplegic migraine.

===High altitude sickness===
Acetazolamide is also used for the treatment of acute mountain sickness. In the prevention or treatment of mountain sickness, acetazolamide inhibits the ability of the kidneys to reabsorb bicarbonate, the conjugate base of carbonic acid. Increasing the amount of bicarbonate excreted in the urine leads to acidification of the blood. Because the body senses CO2 concentration indirectly via blood pH (increase in CO2 causes a decrease in pH), acidifying the blood through decreased renal reabsorption of bicarbonate is sensed as an increase in CO2. This, in turn, causes the body to increase minute ventilation (the amount of air breathed per minute) in order to &quot;breathe off&quot; CO2, which in turn increases the amount of oxygen in the blood. Acetazolamide is not an immediate cure for acute mountain sickness; rather, it speeds up (or, when taking before traveling, forces the body to early start) part of the acclimatization process which in turn helps to relieve symptoms. Acetazolamide is still effective if started early in the course of mountain sickness. As prevention, it is started one day before travel to altitude and continued for the first two days at altitude.

===Pregnancy and lactation===
Acetazolamide is pregnancy category B3 in Australia, which means that studies in rats, mice and rabbits in which acetazolamide was given intravenously or orally caused an increased risk of fetal malformations, including defects of the limbs. Despite this, there is insufficient evidence from studies in humans to either support or discount this evidence.

Limited data are available on the effects of nursing mothers taking acetazolamide. Therapeutic doses create low levels in breast milk and are not expected to cause problems in infants.

==Side effects==
Common adverse effects of acetazolamide include the following: paraesthesia, fatigue, drowsiness, depression, decreased libido, bitter or metallic taste, nausea, vomiting, abdominal cramps, diarrhea, black stool, polyuria, kidney stones, metabolic acidosis and electrolyte changes (hypokalemia, hyponatremia). Whereas less common adverse effects include Stevens–Johnson syndrome, anaphylaxis and blood dyscrasias.

===Contraindications===
Contraindications include:
* Hyperchloremic acidosis
* Hypokalemia (low blood potassium)
* Hyponatremia (low blood sodium)
* Adrenal insufficiency
* Impaired kidney function
* Hypersensitivity to acetazolamide or other sulphonamides.
* Marked liver disease or impairment of liver function, including cirrhosis because of the risk of development of hepatic encephalopathy. Acetazolamide decreases ammonia clearance.

==Interactions ==
It is possible that it might interact with:
* Amphetamines, because it increases the pH of the renal tubular urine, hence reducing the clearance of amphetamines.
* Other carbonic anhydrase inhibitors—potential for additive inhibitory effects on carbonic anhydrase and hence potential for toxicity.
* Ciclosporin, may increase plasma levels of ciclosporin.
* Antifolates such as trimethoprim, methotrexate, pemetrexed and raltitrexed.
* Hypoglycemics, acetazolamide can both increase or decrease blood glucose levels.
* Lithium, increases excretion, hence reducing therapeutic effect.
* Methenamine compounds, reduces the urinary excretion of methenamines.
* Phenytoin, reduces phenytoin excretion, hence increasing the potential for toxicity.
* Primidone, reduces plasma levels of primidone. Hence reducing anticonvulsant effect.
* Quinidine, reduces urinary excretion of quinidine, hence increasing the potential for toxicity.
* Salicylates, potential for severe toxicity.
* Sodium bicarbonate, potential for kidney stone formation.
* Anticoagulants, cardiac glycosides, may have their effects potentiated by acetazolamide.

== Mechanism of action ==
Acetazolamide is a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor, hence causing the accumulation of carbonic acid. Carbonic anhydrase is an enzyme found in red blood cells and many other tissues that catalyses the following reaction:

:H2CO3 ⇌ H2O + CO2

hence lowering blood pH, by means of the following reaction that carbonic acid undergoes:

:H2CO3 ⇌ HCO3− + H+

which has a pKa of 6.3.

The mechanism of diuresis involves the proximal tubule of the kidney. The enzyme carbonic anhydrase is found here, allowing the reabsorption of bicarbonate, sodium, and chloride. By inhibiting this enzyme, these ions are excreted, along with excess water, lowering blood pressure, intracranial pressure, and intraocular pressure. A general side effect of carbonic anhydrase inhibitors is loss of potassium due to this function. By excreting bicarbonate, the blood becomes acidic, causing compensatory hyperventilation with deep respiration (Kussmaul breathing), increasing levels of oxygen and decreasing levels of carbon dioxide in the blood.

In the eye this results in a reduction in aqueous humour.

Bicarbonate (HCO3−) has a pKa of 10.3 with carbonate (CO32−), far further from physiologic pH (7.35–7.45), and so it is more likely to accept a proton than to donate one, but it is also far less likely for it to do either, thus bicarbonate will be the major species at physiological pH.

Under normal conditions in the proximal convoluted tubule of the kidney, most of the carbonic acid (H2CO3) produced intracellularly by the action of carbonic anhydrase quickly dissociates in the cell to bicarbonate (HCO3−) and an H+ ion (a proton), as previously mentioned. The bicarbonate (HCO3−) exits at the basal portion of the cell via sodium (Na+) symport and chloride (Cl−) antiport and re-enters circulation, where it may accept a proton if blood pH decreases, thus acting as a weak, basic buffer. The remaining H+ left over from the intracellular production of carbonic acid (H2CO3) exits the apical (urinary lumen) portion of the cell by Na+ antiport, acidifying the urine. There, it may join with another bicarbonate (HCO3−) that dissociated from its H+ in the lumen of the urinary space only after exiting the proximal convoluted kidney cells/glomerulus as carbonic acid (H2CO3) because bicarbonate (HCO3−) itself can not diffuse across the cell membrane in its polar state. This will replenish carbonic acid (H2CO3) so that it then may be reabsorbed into the cell as itself or CO2 and H2O (produced via a luminal carbonic anhydrase). As a result of this whole process, there is a greater net balance of H+ in the urinary lumen than bicarbonate (HCO3−), and so this space is more acidic than physiologic pH. Thus, there is an increased likelihood that any bicarbonate (HCO3−) that was left over in the lumen diffuses back into the cell as carbonic acid, CO2, or H2O.

In short, under normal conditions, the net effect of carbonic anhydrase in the urinary lumen and cells of the proximal convoluted tubule is to acidify the urine and transport bicarbonate (HCO3−) into the body. Another effect is excretion of Cl− as it is needed to maintain electroneutrality in the lumen, as well as the reabsorption of Na+ into the body.

Thus, by disrupting this process with acetazolamide, urinary Na+ and bicarbonate (HCO3−) are increased, and urinary H+ and Cl− are decreased. Inversely, serum Na+ and bicarbonate (HCO3−) are decreased, and serum H+ and Cl− are increased. H2O generally follows sodium, and so this is how the clinical diuretic effect is achieved, which reduces blood volume and thus preload on the heart to improve contractility and reduce blood pressure, or achieve other desired clinical effects of reduced blood volume such as reducing edema or intracranial pressure.

==History==
An early description of this compound (as 2-acetylamino-1,3,4-thiadiazole-5-sulfonamide) and its synthesis has been patented.

== Research ==
Smaller clinical trials have also shown promising results in the treatment of normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH).

<text>Body language is a type of nonverbal communication in which physical behaviors, as opposed to words, are used to express or convey information. Such behavior includes facial expressions, body posture, gestures, eye movement, touch and the use of space. Although body language is an important part of communication, most of it happens without conscious awareness. In social communication, body language often complements verbal communication. Nonverbal communication has a significant impact on doctor-patient relationships, as it affects how open patients are with their doctor. Having open body language, which is typically identified as having a relaxed posture, nodding, eye contact can contribute to patients having higher levels of trust with their doctors. According to, W.Y. Kee, patients who had a doctor that avoided eye contact by looking at a screen or had negative facial expressions contributed to patients feeling dissatisfied after their visit.

The rise of different technologies has led to humans adapting to non-face-to-face communication, for example, while texting, it can challenge to decode the messages because body language cues like tone and eye contact are not present. With the introduction of texting, humans have adapted to using new ways to demonstrate body language cues, for example, the use of emoticons. The way body language is expressed changes depending on the gender and age of the person. Women and men express body language differently, especially in the workplace, women tend to express more intense nonverbal cues than men, this makes the cues easier to decode. These nonverbal signals impact the way men and women interact in the workplace, as according to Deepika, women tend be highly comfortable being close and communicating with other women. This is hypothesized to be the case because people that demonstrate similar nonverbal cues can interpret and decode communication signals more effectively.

As an unstructured, ungrammatical, and broadly-interpreted form of communication, body language is not a form of language. It differs from sign language, which are true languages with complex grammar systems and exhibiting the fundamental properties considered to exist in all languages.

Some researchers conclude that nonverbal communication accounts for the majority of information transmitted during interpersonal interactions. It helps to establish the relationship between two people and regulates interaction, yet it can be ambiguous. The interpretation of body language tends to vary in different cultural contexts. Within a society, consensus exists regarding the accepted understandings and interpretations of specific behaviors. However, controversy exists on whether body language is universal. The study of body language is also known as kinesics.

== Physical expressions ==
=== Facial expressions ===
Facial expression is an important part of body language and the expression of emotion. It can comprise movement of the eyes, eyebrows, lips, nose and cheeks.

At one point, researchers believed that making a genuine smile was nearly impossible to do on command. More recently, however, a study conducted by researchers at Northeastern University found that people could convincingly fake a Duchenne smile, even when they were not feeling especially happy.

The action of the pupil corresponds to mood and communicate the mood of a person when observed. Research has found that people have no control over their pupils, which involuntarily expand when expressing interest in another person or when looking at something. Normally, eyes instinctively blink at around 20 times per minute, but looking at a person the viewer finds attractive can make this rate faster. The eyes can communicate information that words may not be able to, the intensity and duration of eye contact can determine someone’s intentions depending on the setting. According to the academic researcher Deepika, in the workplace, strong eye contact is usually translated as sincerity and open communication. Furthermore, there are instances where people use closed communication, which refers to when people seem resistant to communication, for example, the avoidance of eye contact or crossed arms are interpreted as lack of interest regardless of whether it is intentional or subconscious.

Studies and behavioral experiments have shown that facial expressions and bodily expressions are congruent in terms of conveying visible signs of a person&#x27;s emotional state, and that emotions can be judged with a high level of accuracy based on facial expressions. At the same time, the brain processes another person&#x27;s facial and bodily expressions simultaneously.

=== Head and neck postures and signals ===
The movement of the head can indicate various intentions and messages, and is often culture and context-dependent.

The angle of facing and positioning of a person&#x27;s head can be indicative of their mood, when considered along with patterns of muscular tension that occur concurrently at the face and neck. Tilting the head up may demonstrate &#x27;superiority emotions&#x27; such as self-assurance, pride, or contempt. When it is tilted down, this may indicate &#x27;inferiority emotions&#x27; such as shame, shyness, or respect. Nonetheless, the accuracy of such interpretation depends on the intensity of the feeling or other context-related factors. For instance, feelings of contentment may instead feature the head being angled down somewhat.

In many cultures, nodding of the head is considered a sign of saying &#x27;yes&#x27;, while shaking the head is usually interpreted as meaning &#x27;no&#x27;. In India, a head bobble is the tilting of the head from side to side, whose interpretation can be ambiguous and context-dependent.

A tilting of the head to the side can be an expression of interest in what the other person is communicating. It may be a sign of curiosity, uncertainty, or questioning. If the head is propped up by the hand when the head is tilted then this may indicate disinterest or be a sign of thinking about something. A head that is tilted forwards slightly while being pulled backward may indicate being suspicious.

As a person&#x27;s vocal chords are influenced physically by the tilt of their head and the respective pattern of muscle tension, it is possible to discern their head tilt by listening to how they talk. Head angle and movement have a large impact on the amplitude and pitch of one&#x27;s speech. 

=== General body postures ===
Emotions can also be detected through body postures. Research has shown that body postures are more accurately recognized when an emotion is compared with a different or neutral emotion. For example, a person feeling angry would portray dominance over the other, and their posture would display approach tendencies. Comparing this to a person feeling fearful: they would feel weak, and submissive and their posture would display avoidance tendencies.

Sitting or standing postures can also indicate one&#x27;s emotions. A person sitting still in the back of their chair, leaning forward with their head nodding along with the discussion implies that they are open, relaxed and generally ready to listen. On the other hand, a person who has their legs and arms crossed with the foot kicking could imply that they are feeling impatient and emotionally detached from the discussion. In a standing discussion, a person standing with arms akimbo with feet pointed towards the speaker could suggest that they are attentive and interested in the conversation. While many people attribute bodily posture purely to individual expression, there is evidence that points to posture as a product of cultural norms. 

In Bali, standing with arms akimbo is considered rude and may send signals of aggression.

==== Chest ====
In general, the relative fullness or shallowness of the chest, especially around the sternum, can be a key indicator of both mood and attitude.

When the body language of the chest is assessed in everyday circumstances, it involves an instinctive assessment of these factors of shape and volume. When the posture of the chest is fuller, and it is positioned relatively forward, then this is a sign of confidence. If it is thrusting prominently forward, then this may be an indication that the person wants to be socially prominent and make a statement of physical confidence. When the chest is pulled back then this can indicate a less confident attitude.

If a person positions their chest closer towards another person it may be a sign of paying closer attention to them as part of a conversation, or, in other circumstances, it may be a sign of physical assertion and aggression.

==== Gestures ====
Gestures are movements made with body parts and may be voluntary or involuntary. Gestures can be used to convey various messages about what someone is thinking or feeling. Gestures can even be used to produce language, such as sign language.

Arm gestures can be interpreted in several ways. In a discussion, when one stands, sits or even walks with folded arms, it is normally not a welcoming gesture. It could mean that they have a closed mind and are most likely unwilling to listen to the speaker&#x27;s viewpoint. Another type of arm gesture also includes an arm crossed over the other, demonstrating insecurity and a lack of confidence. Hand gestures often signify the state of well-being of the person making them. Relaxed hands indicate confidence and self-assurance, while clenched hands may be interpreted as signs of stress or anger. If a person is wringing their hands, this demonstrates nervousness and anxiety.

Finger gestures are also commonly used to exemplify one&#x27;s speech as well as denote the state of well-being of the person making them. In certain cultures, pointing using one&#x27;s index finger is deemed acceptable. However, pointing at a person may be viewed as aggressive in other cultures – for example, people who share Hindu beliefs consider finger pointing offensive. Instead, they point with a palm up open hand. Likewise, the thumbs up gesture could show &quot;OK&quot; or &quot;good&quot; in countries like the United States, South Africa, France, Lebanon and Germany. But this same gesture is insulting in other countries like Iran, Bangladesh and Thailand, where it is the equivalent of showing the middle finger in some cultures.

It is difficult to distinguish a behavior motivated by an &quot;out-group bias&quot;—a negative response to a member of a different group—from one fueled by &quot;stereotype effect&quot;—a cognitive association between members of a specific out-group and a culturally held belief. Some behaviors are unique to some cultures, which leads to the outgroup having a harder time decoding the information, these interactions could lead to out-group bias. An example of a cultural difference in non-verbal communication is between Americans and the Greek. Americans nod up and down to indicate “yes” while they nod side to side to indicate “no”. On the other hand, the Greek nod upwards to indicate “no” and downwards to indicate “yes”. During American Greek interactions, the cultures clash and have a harder time decoding the non-verbal cues.

Another way that out-group bias could be created is through low and high contact cultures. Low contact cultures are more individualistic, while high contact cultures are collectivistic. Low contact cultures express mostly verbally, and use less of the non-verbal cues, while high contact cultures use both forms of communication at the same time. People from low contact cultures could face a hard time decoding the gestures from those of high contact cultures, this can lead to out-group bias.

=== Handshakes ===
Handshakes are regular greeting rituals and commonly used when meeting, greeting, offering congratulations, expressing camaraderie, or after the completion of an agreement. Research has shown that handshakes can improve the accuracy of first impressions, particularly in judging conscientiousness, especially among men. In negotiations, handshakes promote cooperative behavior and lead to better outcomes in both integrative and distributive scenarios. Negotiators who shake hands are more likely to openly reveal their preferences and craft fairer agreements.

Studies have categorized several handshake styles, including the finger squeeze, the bone crusher (shaking hands too strongly), the limp fish (shaking hands too weakly), etc. Handshakes are popular in the United States and are appropriate for use between men and women. However, in Muslim cultures, men may not shake hands or touch women in any way and vice versa. Likewise, in Hindu cultures, Hindu men may never shake hands with women. Instead, they greet women by placing their hands as if praying.

A firm, friendly handshake has long been recommended in the business world as a way to make a good first impression, and the greeting is thought to date to ancient times as a way of showing a stranger you had no weapons.

=== Breathing ===
Body language related to breathing and patterns of breathing can be indicative of a person&#x27;s mood and state of mind.

== Other subcategories ==
=== Oculesics ===

Oculesics, a subcategory of body language, is the study of eye movement, eye behavior, gaze, and eye-related nonverbal communication.

As a social or behavioral science, oculesics is a form of nonverbal communication focusing on deriving meaning from eye behavior. Oculesics is culturally dependent. For example, in traditional Anglo-Saxon culture, avoiding eye contact usually portrays a lack of confidence, certainty, or truthfulness. However, in the Latino culture, direct or prolonged eye contact means that you are challenging the individual with whom you are speaking or that you have a romantic interest in the person. Also, in many Asian cultures, prolonged eye contact may be a sign of anger or aggression.

=== Haptics ===

Research has also shown that people can accurately decode distinct emotions by merely watching others communicate via touch. A study by Jones and Yarbrough regarded communication with touch as the most intimate and involving form which helps people to keep good relationships with others. For example, Jones and Yarbrough explained that strategic touching is a series of touching usually with an ulterior or hidden motive thus making them seem to be using touch as a game to get someone to do something for them.

Heslin outlines five haptic categories:
* Functional/professional: This expresses task-orientation. 
* Social/polite: This expresses ritual interaction.
* Friendship/warmth: This expresses idiosyncratic relationship.
* Love/intimacy: This expresses emotional attachment. Public touch can serve as a &#x27;tie sign&#x27; that shows others that your partner is &quot;taken&quot;. When a couple is holding hands, putting their arms around each other, this is a &#x27;tie sign&#x27; showing others that they are together. The use of &#x27;tie signs&#x27; are used more often by couples in the dating and courtship stages than between their married counterparts.
* Sexual/arousal: This expresses sexual intent.

=== Proxemics ===
Another notable area in the nonverbal world of body language is that of spatial relationships, which is also known as proxemics. Introduced by Edward T. Hall in 1966, proxemics is the study of measurable distances between people as they interact with one another. Hall came up with four distinct zones in which most people operate:

Intimate distance for embracing, touching or whispering
: Close phase – less than 6 inches (15 cm)
: Far phase – 6 to 18 inches (15 to 46 cm)

Personal distance for interactions among good friends or family members
: Close phase – 1.5 to 2.5 feet (46 to 76 cm)
: Far phase – 2.5 to 4 feet (76 to 122 cm)

Social distance for interactions among acquaintances
: Close phase – 4 to 7 feet (1.2 to 2.1 m)
: Far phase – 7 to 12 feet (2.1 to 3.7 m)

Public Distance used for public speaking
: Close phase – 12 to 25 feet (3.7 to 7.6 m)
: Far phase – 25 feet (7.6 m) or more.

In addition to physical distance, the level of intimacy between conversants can be determined by &quot;socio-petal socio-fugal axis&quot;, or the &quot;angle formed by the axis of the conversants&#x27; shoulders&quot;.

Changing the distance between two people can convey a desire for intimacy, declare a lack of interest, or increase/decrease domination. It can also influence the body language that is used. For example, when people talk they like to face each other. If forced to sit side by side, their body language will try to compensate for this lack of eye-to-eye contact by leaning in shoulder-to-shoulder.

As with other types of body language, proximity range varies with culture. Hall suggested that &quot;physical contact between two people ... can be perfectly correct in one culture, and absolutely taboo in another&quot;.

== Tone of voice ==

Certain body postures can significantly influence the tone of voice. The intra-abdominal pressure (IAP) is a direct influence on, and discernible in, tone of voice. Pitch, intonation, speed, and volume impact the way messages are decoded. The pitch of someone’s voice can be interpreted in different ways, a high-pitched voice is associated with excitement, while a low voice is associated with seriousness. The intonation of a statement can helps people determine if a claim is being made or if a question is being asked. Statements with a rising intonation are usually questions. The speed and volume at which someone speaks helps determine the emotion behind the statement. For example, a loud-quick paced tone of voice is associated with urgency and anger, on the other hand, a slow-soft voice is associated with calmness and tenderness.

== Attitude ==


Body language is a major contributor to the attitude a person conveys to others. Albert Mehrabian maintains that during a conversation dealing with feelings and attitudes (i.e., like-dislike), 7% of what is communicated is via what is said, 38% is via tone of voice, and the majority, 55%, is via body language. This is also referred to as the &#x27;7%–38%–55% Rule&#x27;, and is often considered in studies of human communications. While there is a wider debate about the percentage share which should be attributed to each of the three contributing factors, it is generally agreed upon that body language plays a fundamental role in determining the attitude a person conveys.

A person may alter their body language in order to alter the attitude they convey; this may in turn influence the rapport they have with another person. Whether a formal or informal attitude is conveyed may influence the other person&#x27;s response.

== Trust ==
Body language which expresses trust will usually convey a sense of openness and warmth. Contrarily, mistrusting body language will appear relatively closed and cold. Body language which conveys a sense of trust can vary depending on the nature of the relationship.

=== Business ===
Body language which conveys trust in a business context is done so in a formal manner and in line with business etiquette. In the world of business, the power structures that tend to exist are communicated non-verbally. Nonverbal dominance refers to how people communicate power, control, and authority using gestures, posture, facial expressions, and voice. Nonverbal dominance becomes important in these business settings because it could impact sales and business relationships. For example, ‘adaptors’ refers to touching an object or oneself during a conversation or presentation. These communicate nervousness and uncertainty, which contributes to a lower rate of persuasiveness, this can lead to lower sales.

Some examples of how people decode nonverbal dominance are silence, loud voices, and a non-smiling face. The study carried out by Burgoon demonstrated how participants could use nonverbal cues better to understand each other during a game of mafia. During the game, the participants had to take on different roles (spies or villagers) which had various levels of authority, as a result, participants adapted their body language to the role they played in the game. The study demonstrated that the spies were less dominant and more trustworthy, while the leader of the group was more dominant and demonstrated this dominance through their loud voice and upright posture. Overall, the study was able to demonstrate a correlation between the participants’ role and how they adapted their body language to match the level of dominance.

=== Friendship ===

Body language between friends is typically more expressive and informal than body language in business. In casual settings, people display a lack of dominance more casually. For example, they may show more expressive facial expressions, nodding, and hand gestures. These nonverbal cues display open-body language, which contributes to improved communication among friends. These displays of body language may increase trust between friends, as nonverbal and verbal communication work together to form a clearer message. Body language in friendships can sometimes mean certain handshakes or gestures towards one another. It may also correlate to some sort of meaning for a certain idea or thing.

=== Intimate relationships ===

The body language of trust in intimate relationships such as courtship and marriage is very open and often highly personalized, even if it is not necessarily as physically dynamic as that found in a friendship for example. In Western contexts holding hands is a common sign between intimate partners that expresses their affection and trust in each other. Trust is also conveyed in intimate relationships through people caressing and kissing each other. These actions are designed to convey openness and warmth in a highly personalised way. Each partner is communicating to the other that they are attracted to them and also that they trust them and are allowing them to touch them in a more intimate way than would otherwise be acceptable. Such body language may be established gradually over a period of courtship. The body language of intimate relationships cannot be used acceptably in non-intimate relationships.

When people are in an intimate relationship, they often position themselves closer to each other than if they were in a different kind of relationship. Even though it may only be a small distance closer together, an observer can interpret this additional closeness to mean that they are in an intimate relationship. For example, spouses may sit, stand, and walk in each other&#x27;s intimate space, whereas business colleagues may maintain more of a distance and outside of each other&#x27;s intimate space. As the spouses are in an intimate relationship, they do not feel the need to maintain the same distance as the business colleagues.

== Readiness ==
Body language can convey the impression of a readiness to take action. While this is always observable in the physical sense it can be further categorised as being &#x27;readiness for physical exertion&#x27; or &#x27;readiness for social interaction&#x27;. Noting that a person will typically be ready for both at any given time, and such categorisations are based upon which course of action they are primarily ready for at that moment. Such states of readiness influence the person&#x27;s whole body, tone of voice, and what impression they convey through their body language. A state of increased readiness may also be referred to as being in a state of high energy or intensity. Relative to states of unreadiness, most states of readiness typically involve a deeper breathing pattern, increased excitation of the nervous system, and an increased heart rate. Such physiological effects also influence the person&#x27;s skin and its fullness of appearance. In relative terms, a person&#x27;s skin will usually look fuller and more taut while in a state of readiness, and thinner and more flaccid in a state of unreadiness. A readiness for physical exertion typically means that these effects are increased further in terms of their intensity and visual prominence.

=== Readiness for social interaction ===
Harvard professor Amy Cuddy suggested in 2010 that two minutes of power posing – &quot;standing tall, holding your arms out or toward the sky, or standing like Superman, with your hands on hips&quot; – could increase confidence, but retracted the advice and stopped teaching it after a 2015 study was unable to replicate the effect.

== Universal vs. culture-specific ==
Scholars have long debated on whether body language, particularly facial expressions, are universally understood. In Darwin&#x27;s evolutionary theory, he postulated that facial expressions of emotion are inherited. On the other hand, scholars have questioned if culture influences one&#x27;s bodily expression of emotions. Broadly, the theories can be categorized into two models: the cultural equivalence model and cultural advantage model.

=== Cultural equivalence model ===
The cultural equivalence model predicts that &quot;individuals should be equally accurate in understanding the emotions of ingroup and outgroup members&quot;. This model is rooted in Darwin&#x27;s evolutionary theory, where he noted that both humans and animals share similar postural expressions of emotions such as anger/aggression, happiness, and fear. These similarities support the evolution argument that social animals (including humans) have a natural ability to relay emotional signals with one another, a notion shared by several academics (Chevalier-Skolnikoff, 1974; Linnankoski, Laakso, Aulanko, &amp; Leinonen, 1994). Where Darwin notes similarity in expression among animals and humans, the Cultural Equivalence Model notes similarity in expression across cultures in humans, even though they may be completely different.

One of the strongest pieces of evidence that supports this model was a study conducted by Paul Ekman, where members of a preliterate tribe in Papua New Guinea reliably recognized the facial expressions of individuals from the United States. Culturally isolated and with no exposure to US media, there was no possibility of cross-cultural transmission to the Papuan tribesmen.

The term body language is usually applied in regard to people but may also be applied to animals.

=== Cultural advantage model ===
On the other hand, the cultural advantage model predicts that individuals of the same race &quot;process the visual characteristics more accurately and efficiently than other-race faces&quot;. Other factors that increase accurate interpretation include familiarity with nonverbal accents.

There are numerous studies that support both the cultural equivalence model and the cultural advantage model, but reviewing the literature indicates that there is a general consensus that seven emotions are universally recognized, regardless of cultural background: happiness, surprise, fear, anger, contempt, disgust, and sadness.

Recently, scholars have shown that the expressions of pride and shame are universal. Tracy and Robins (2008) concluded that the expression of pride includes an expanded posture of the body with the head tilted back, with a low-intensity face and a non-Duchenne smile (raising the corner of the mouth). The expression of shame includes the hiding of the face, either by turning it down or covering it with the hands.

== Applications ==
Fundamentally, body language is seemed as an involuntary and unconscious phenomenon that adds to the process of communication. Despite that, there have been certain areas where the conscious harnessing of body language – both in action and comprehension – have been useful. The use of body language has also seen an increase in application and use commercially, with large volumes of books and guides published designed to teach people how to be conscious of body language, and how to use it to benefit them in certain scenarios.

The use of body language can be seen in a wide variety of fields. Body languages has seen applications in instructional teaching in areas such as second-language acquisition and also to enhance the teaching of subjects like mathematics. A related use of body language is as a substitution to verbal language to people who lack the ability to use that, be it because of deafness or aphasia. Body language has also been applied in the process of detecting deceit through micro-expressions, both in law enforcement and even in the world of poker.

=== Instructional teaching ===
==== Second-language acquisition ====
The importance of body language in second-language acquisition was inspired by the fact that to successfully learn a language is to achieve discourse, strategic, and sociolinguistic competencies. Sociolinguistic competence includes understanding the body language that aids the use of a particular language. This is usually also highly culturally influenced. As such, a conscious ability to recognize and even perform this sort of body language is necessary to achieve fluency in a language beyond the discourse level.

The importance of body language to verbal language use is the need to eliminate ambiguity and redundancy in comprehension. Pennycook (1985) suggests to limit the use of non-visual materials to facilitate the teaching of a second language to improve this aspect of communication. He calls this being not just bilingual but also &#x27;bi-kinesic&#x27;.

==== Enhancing teaching ====
Body language can be a useful aid not only in teaching a second language, but also in other areas. The idea behind using it is as a nonlinguistic input. It can be used to guide, hint, or urge a student towards the right answer. This is usually paired off with other verbal methods of guiding the student, be it through confirmation checks or modified language use. Tai in his 2014 paper provides a list of three main characteristic of body language and how they influence teaching. The features are intuition, communication, and suggestion.
* The intuitive feature of body language used in teaching is the exemplification of the language, especially individual words, through the use of matching body language. For example, when teaching about the word &quot;cry&quot;, teachers can imitate a crying person. This enables a deeper impression which is able to lead to greater understanding of the particular word.
* The communicative feature is the ability of body language to create an environment and atmosphere that is able to facilitate effective learning. A holistic environment is more productive for learning and the acquisition for new knowledge.
* The suggestive feature of body language uses body language as a tool to create opportunities for the students to gain additional information about a particular concept or word through pairing it with the body language itself.

=== Detecting deceit ===
==== Law enforcement ====
Despite the absence of evidence indicating that non-verbal lie detection works — and its rejection by the scholarly community as an effective way to detect lies — many law enforcement bodies still rely on it. Numerous Federal Bureau of Investigation &quot;Law Enforcement Bulletins&quot; have addressed body language as a purported tool for &quot;evaluation truthfulness and detecting deception.&quot;

The body language of the members of law enforcement might influence the accuracy of eyewitness accounts.

==== Poker ====
The game of poker involves the competence of reading and analyzing the body language of opponents (for example, poker tells), and moderating one&#x27;s own body language (for example, poker bluff).

=== Visual arts ===

Exaggerated, repetitious, and inappropriate body language is often used to achieve a humorous effect in comedy productions. Comedy double acts often use methods of complementary and contrasting comedic body language.

== Kinesics ==
Kinesics is the study and interpretation of nonverbal communication related to the movement of any part of the body or the body as a whole. It was first developed by Ray Birdwhistell, who disavowed use of the term &quot;body language&quot;, as it did not meet the linguistic definition of language.

== Sports ==
Research on body language (nonverbal behavior, NVB) in sport is only slowly emerging, although it is considered important and has been frequently studied in other disciplines. NVB plays a crucial role in sports by conveying athletes&#x27; emotions, intentions, and psychological states. Research indicates that athletes&#x27; NVBs, such as facial expressions and postures, are correlated with internal factors like emotions and contextual variables like success. Observers, including opponents and referees, can interpret these NVBs, which can influence perceptions and decisions during competition.

<text>The Ephrata Cloister or Ephrata Community was a religious community, established in 1732 by Johann Conrad Beissel at Ephrata, in what is now Lancaster County, Pennsylvania. The grounds of the community are now owned by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and are administered by the Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission.

Marie Kachel Bucher, the last surviving resident of the Ephrata Cloister, died on July 27, 2008, at the age of 98.

==History==
The community descended from the pietistic Schwarzenau Brethren movement of Alexander Mack of Schwarzenau in Germany. The first schism from the general body occurred in 1728—the Seventh Day Dunkers, whose distinctive principle was that the seventh day was the true Sabbath.

In 1732, Beissel arrived at the banks of Cocalico Creek in Lancaster County. Around this charismatic leader a semi-monastic community (the Camp of the Solitary) with a convent (the Sister House) and a monastery (the Brother House) was established, called &quot;Ephrata&quot; after Biblical Ephrath. The members of the order were celibate. Members were required to sleep on wooden benches wide, with wooden blocks for pillows. They slept six hours per night, from 9 P.M. to midnight, and from 2 A.M. until 5 A.M., with a two-hour break to &quot;watch&quot; for the coming of Christ. They ate one small vegetarian meal a day. The only time the followers of Beissel were permitted to eat meat was during the celebration of communion when lamb was served. The members of the cloister spent much time at work or praying privately. Services every Saturday were led by Beissel, often being several hours long.

During the time that this group formed, there was a hint of dissatisfied intellectualism of churches. Many wanted to be away from state established churches. Strict religious lives caused these brothers and sisters to come together to worship God in other ways. Instead of practicing their religion, they applied it by helping others to become more spiritual and celibate.

Among the sisterhood and brotherhood there included a married order of householders, which were families who supported and engaged in the everyday activities. Other than practicing quiet lives by praying and doing charity work, the Cloisters had a duty to keep up with the tasks of living at Ephrata. Farming and industrial work were the typical workload on a daily basis. Although the Cloisters often practiced their religion by interpreting Biblical works, they also engaged in carpentry and papermaking. Other tasks included gardening, preparing meals, and mending. Not only were the cloisters famous for their writings and hymns on the printing press but they became very busy people especially when it came to chores. They manufactured clothing on a mill and kept their lives busy by creating duties and obligations.

The Cloisters had a positive outlook on life; they respected their neighbors, land and environment. Education was also important in their society. It was important that every child maintain their education. Children that came from families were also encouraged to be educated in the German school. Educating the young was one of the charity works that the Cloisters accomplished. They also helped the poor by passing around bread to the poor families.

Other believing families settled near the community, accepted Beissel as their spiritual leader and worshipped with them on Sabbath. These families made an integral part to the cloister, which could not be self-sustaining without them. The brothers and sisters of Ephrata are famous for their writing and publishing of hymns, and the composition of tunes in four voices. Beissel served as the community&#x27;s composer as well as spiritual leader, and devised his own system of composition. The Ephrata hymnal (words only) was printed in 1747.

The Ephrata Cloister had the second German printing press in the American colonies and also published the largest book in Colonial America. The book, &quot;Martyrs Mirror&quot;, is a history of the deaths of Christian martyrs from 4 B.C. until 1660. Before the publication began at the request of a group of Mennonites from Montgomery County, it had to be translated from the original Holland Dutch into German, which was completed by Peter Miller of the Ephrata Community. Work began in 1748 and was finished about three years later. Many of the books were purchased by the Montgomery County Mennonites who had initiated the process.

Beissel died in 1768, and this contributed to a declining membership. The monastic aspect was gradually abandoned, with the last celibate member dying in 1813. In 1814, the Society was incorporated as the &quot;German Seventh Day Baptist Church&quot; (or &quot;The German Religious Society of Seventh Day Baptists&quot;). Branches were established in other locations; two of them still exist today. In 1941, a Ephrata tract of land with remaining buildings was conveyed to the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania for use as a state historical site. The Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission led excavations there which, among other things, uncovered the Cloister&#x27;s use as a hospital during the Revolutionary War (1775–83). Of special note, the only glass trumpet of its kind in North America was unearthed by archaeologists in 1998 at the Cloister. The trumpet, which likely came from Germany, was found in excellent condition which led archaeologists to believe it was intentionally buried. The mouthpiece was the only part missing from the trumpet, so it is unknown if it has ever been played.

At its height, the Ephrata community grew to inhabited by about 80 celibate men and women. The married congregation numbered approximately 200.

<text>From the late 1870s to the 1920s, the Vanderbilt family employed some of the best Beaux-Arts architects and decorators in the United States to build a notable string of townhouses in New York City and palaces on the East Coast of the United States. Many of the Vanderbilt houses are now National Historic Landmarks. Some photographs of Vanderbilt residences in New York are included in the &quot;Photographic series of American Architecture&quot; by Albert Levy (1870s).

The list of architects employed by the Vanderbilts is a &quot;who&#x27;s who&quot; of the New York–based firms that embodied the syncretic (also called &quot;eclectic&quot;) styles of the American Renaissance: Richard Morris Hunt; George B. Post; McKim, Mead, and White; Charles B. Atwood; Carrère and Hastings; Warren and Wetmore; Horace Trumbauer; John Russell Pope and Addison Mizner were all employed by the descendants of Cornelius Vanderbilt, who built only very modestly himself.

== Houses ==
*Cornelius Vanderbilt II (1843–1899)
** Townhouse, the &quot;Cornelius Vanderbilt II House&quot; (1883) at 1 West 57th Street, Manhattan, New York, by George B. Post. Enlargements by George B. Post and Richard Morris Hunt. This mansion remains the largest private residence ever built in Manhattan. Demolished.
** &quot;The Breakers&quot; in Newport, Rhode Island, in 1892 to 1895, which was also designed by Richard Morris Hunt.

<doc id="366684" wikidata="Q4722910" url="?curid=366684" title="Alfred I. duPont–Columbia University Award">
<text>The Alfred I. duPont–Columbia University Award honors excellence in broadcast and digital journalism in the public service and is considered one of the most prestigious awards in journalism. The awards were established in 1942 and administered until 1967 by Washington and Lee University&#x27;s O. W. Riegel, Curator and Head of the Department of Journalism and Communications. Since 1968 they have been administered by the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism in New York City, and are considered by some to be the broadcast equivalent of the Pulitzer Prize, another program administered by Columbia University.

Dedicated to upholding the highest journalism standards, the duPont awards inform the public about the contributions news organizations and journalists make to their communities, support journalism education and innovation, and cultivate a collective spirit for the profession.

The duPont-Columbia Awards were established by Jessie Ball duPont in memory of her husband Alfred I. du Pont. It is the most well-respected journalism-only award for broadcast journalism; starting in 2009, it began accepting digital submissions. The duPont, along with the George Foster Peabody Awards, rank among the most prestigious awards programs in all electronic media.

The duPont-Columbia jury selects the winners from programs that air in the United States between July 1 and June 30 of each year. Award winners receive batons in gold and silver designed by the American architect Louis I. Kahn. The gold baton, when awarded, is given exclusively in honor of truly outstanding broadcast journalism.

==Notable winners==
In 2003, the first-ever foreign-language program was awarded a duPont-Columbia Award: CNN en Español and reporter Jorge Gestoso won a Silver Baton for investigative reporting on Argentina&#x27;s &quot;desaparecidos&quot;.

In 2010, the first award for digital reporting was given to MediaStorm and photographer Jonathan Torgovnik for &quot;Intended Consequences&quot; about children born of rape in Rwanda.

In 2012, the first-ever theatrically released documentary film was honored by the duPont jury: the Oscar-nominated &quot;Hell and Back Again&quot;, about the war in Afghanistan and the struggles facing veterans when they return home.
