<text>Stephanie Zimbalist (born October 8, 1956) is an American actress best known for her role as Laura Holt in the NBC detective series &quot;Remington Steele&quot;.

== Early life ==
Stephanie Zimbalist was born in New York City, the daughter of Loranda Stephanie (née Spalding) and actor Efrem Zimbalist Jr.. The family soon moved to Los Angeles, where Stephanie grew up. She was educated at the Marlborough School (Los Angeles) and graduated from Foxcroft School in Middleburg, Virginia. She attended the Juilliard School before commencing her acting career.

==Acting career==

===Television and film career===
Zimbalist&#x27;s early television and movie appearances include &quot;The Gathering&quot; (1977, with Edward Asner), &quot;In the Matter of Karen Ann Quinlan&quot; (1977), &quot;Forever&quot; (1978), &quot;The Magic of Lassie&quot; (1978), &quot;Long Journey Back&quot; (TV, 1978), &quot;The Triangle Factory Fire Scandal&quot; (1979), &quot;The Awakening&quot; (1980, with Charlton Heston), &quot;The Golden Moment&quot; (1980), in which she played a Soviet Olympic gymnast, &quot;The Babysitter&quot; (1980) and &quot;Tomorrow&#x27;s Child&quot; (TV, 1982). She co-starred with her father, Efrem Zimbalist Jr., in the tragic 1979 TV movie &quot;The Best Place to Be&quot;.

Another early role for Zimbalist was that of Elly Zendt in the mini-series &quot;Centennial&quot;, based on James Michener&#x27;s epic novel of the same name, which was first televised on NBC between October 1978 and February 1979. She also guest starred as Josephine &quot;Josie&quot; Collins in the television series &quot;Family&quot; episode &quot;Ballerina&quot; (1979).

In her TV work, Zimbalist is best known in the TV role of sleuth Laura Holt in the NBC series &quot;Remington Steele&quot; (1982–87) opposite Pierce Brosnan and Doris Roberts, on which her father also guest-starred.

Since then, Zimbalist has taken leading roles in several television movies such as &quot;The Man in the Brown Suit&quot; (1988), the Emmy Award winning &quot;Caroline?&quot; (1990), &quot;The Great Elephant Escape&quot; (1995), and some guest roles in television series such as &quot;Touched by an Angel&quot; and &quot;Diagnosis Murder&quot;.

She has made several appearances with the Rubicon Theatre Company in Ventura, California, winning the local critics&#x27; &quot;Robby Award&quot; for Best Actress in a Drama in &quot;The Rainmaker&quot;, at the Rubicon community theatre in 2001. Throughout the 2000s, Zimbalist took roles in plays concerning nineteenth-century artists including Chopin, Tchaikovsky and Van Gogh.

She also played Christa McAuliffe in the play &quot;Defying Gravity&quot; in 2003, written by Jane Anderson.

In 2009 she portrayed actress Katharine Hepburn in &quot;Tea at Five&quot;.

Zimbalist has also released audiobooks, including &quot;The Girls&quot;, which won a Listen-Up award in 2006, and &quot;Queen of the Underworld&quot;.

She appeared in the 2006 documentary &quot;Christa McAuliffe: Reach for the Stars&quot;.

== Personal life ==
Zimbalist&#x27;s paternal grandfather, Efrem Zimbalist, born in Rostov-on-Don, Russia, was a symphony conductor, concert violinist and music teacher at the Curtis Institute in Philadelphia, and composer. Her paternal grandmother, Alma Gluck, born in Romania, was a leading soprano of her day.
Zimbalist&#x27;s aunt, Marcia Davenport, was a prominent author, music journalist and historian. 

In a 2016 interview she described attending a Billy Graham crusade over 15 years prior with Dean Butler, and both going down to &quot;accept the Lord.&quot; She expressed, &quot;I have a personal connection with my Savior... I feel very beholden to Him--for me it&#x27;s a him--I feel He&#x27;s there for me in my darkest moments.&quot; In the same interview she mentioned years ago moving out of an &quot;inappropriate relationship&quot; with a married man, though still remaining friends.

<text>Gregory Bar Hebraeus (, b. 1226 - d. 30 July 1286), known by his Syriac ancestral surname as Barebraya or Barebroyo, in Arabic sources by his kunya Abu&#x27;l-Faraj, and his Latinized name Abulpharagius in the Latin West, was a Maphrian (regional primate) of the Syriac Orthodox Church from 1264 to 1286. He was a prominent writer, who created various works in the fields of Christian theology, philosophy, history, linguistics, and poetry. For his contributions to the development of Syriac literature, has been praised as one of the most learned and versatile writers among Syriac Orthodox Christians.

In his numerous and elaborate treatises, he collected as much contemporary knowledge in theology, philosophy, science and history as was possible in 13th century Syria. Most of his works were written in Classical Syriac language. He also wrote some in Arabic, which was the common language in his day.

==Name==
It is not clear when Bar Hebraeus adopted the Christian name Gregory ( &quot;Grigorios&quot;), but according to the Syriac Orthodox tradition of naming high priests, it may have occurred at the time of his consecration as bishop. Throughout his life, he was often referred to by the Syriac nickname &quot;Bar ʿEvrāyā&quot; (, which is pronounced and often transliterated as &quot;Bar Ebroyo&quot; in the Western Syriac Rite of the Syriac Orthodox Church, giving rise to the Latinised name Bar Hebraeus. It was previously thought that this name, which means &quot;Son of the Hebrew&quot;, was a reference to his Jewish background. Modern scholarship has moved away from this affirmation, because it is not substantiated by other facts. The name may refer to the ancestral origin of his family from ʿEbrā, a village by the Euphrates near Malatya, the city in which he grew up. A few Syriac sources give Bar Hebraeus&#x27;s full Arabic name as (). However, all references to this longer name are posthumous. The Syriac nickname Bar ʿEbrāyā is sometimes arabised as ibn al-ʿIbrī (). E. A. W. Budge says Bar Hebraeus was given the baptismal name John (, ), but this may be a scribal error. As a Syriac bishop, Bar Hebraeus is often given the honorific Mār (, pronounced Mor in West Syriac dialect), and thus Mar/Mor Gregory. He is also known as Abu&#x27;l Faraj (in Latin, Abulpharagius).

==Life==
A Syriac bishop, philosopher, poet, grammarian, physician, biblical commentator, historian, and theologian, Bar Hebraeus was the son of a physician, Aaron (, ). Bar Hebraeus was born in the village of ʿEbra (Izoli, Turk.: Kuşsarayı) near Malatya, Sultanate of Rum (now Turkey, in the province of Elazığ). Under the care of his father, he began as a boy (&quot;a teneris unguiculis&quot;) the study of medicine and of many other branches of knowledge, which he never abandoned.

A Mongol general invaded the area of Malatya, and falling ill, sought for a physician. Aaron, the Hebrew physician, was summoned. Upon his recovery, the Mongol general and Aaron, who took his family with him, went to Antioch (see Principality of Antioch and Franco-Mongol alliance). There Bar Hebraeus continued with his studies and when he was about seventeen years of age he became a monk and began to lead the life of a hermit.

From Antioch Bar Hebraeus went to Tripoli in Phoenicia (actually in the County of Tripoli, a Crusader state in his time), and studied rhetoric and medicine. In 1246, he was consecrated bishop of Gubos by the Syriac Orthodox Patriarch Ignatius III David, and in 1252 he was transferred to Aleppo. In 1255 he was again transferred to the see of Laqabin and finally was made primate, or &quot;maphrian&quot;, of the East by Ignatius IV Yeshu in 1264. His episcopal duties did not interfere with his studies; he took advantage of the numerous visitations, which he had to make throughout his vast province, to consult the libraries and converse with the learned men whom he happened to meet. Thus he gradually accumulated an immense erudition, became familiar with almost all branches of secular and religious knowledge, and in many cases thoroughly mastered the bibliography of the various subjects which he undertook to treat. Bar Hebraeus preserved and systematized the work of his predecessors, either by way of condensation or by way of direct reproduction. Both on account of his virtues and of his science, Bar Hebraeus was highly esteemed. He died in Maragheh, Ilkhanate Persia, and was buried at the Mor Mattai Monastery, near Mosul. He left an autobiography, to be found in Giuseppe Simone Assemani, &quot;Biblioth. Orient.&quot;, II, 248–263; the account of his death was written by his brother, the maphrian Gregory III (Grigorius bar Saumo; d. 1307/8).

==Works==

===Encyclopedic and philosophical===
Bar Hebraeus&#x27; great encyclopedic work is his &quot;Hewath Hekhmetha&quot;, &quot;The Cream of Science&quot;, which deals with almost every branch of human knowledge, and comprises the whole Aristotelian discipline, after Avicenna and Arabian writers. This work, so far, has not been published, with the exception of one chapter, by Margoliouth, in &quot;Analecta Orientalia ad poeticam Aristoteleam&quot; (London, 1887), 114–139.

The &quot;Kethabha dhe-Bhabhatha&quot; (&quot;Book of the Pupils of the Eyes&quot;) is a compendium of logic and dialectics. Other works are to be found in various manuscripts, preserved at Florence, Oxford, London, and elsewhere. The &quot;Teghrath Teghratha&quot; (&quot;Commerce of Commerces&quot;) is a résumé of the preceding, while &quot;Kethabha dhe-Sewadh Sophia&quot; (&quot;Book of Speech of Wisdom&quot;) represents a compendium of knowledge in physics and metaphysics. To these should be added a few translations of Arabic works into Syriac, as well as some treatises written in Arabic.

===Biblical===
The most important work of Bar Hebraeus is &quot;Awsar Raze&quot;, &quot;Storehouse of Secrets&quot;, a commentary on the entire Bible, both doctrinal and critical. Before giving his doctrinal exposition of a passage, he first considers its critical state. Although he uses the &quot;Peshitta&quot; as a basis, he knows that it is not perfect, and therefore controls it by the Hebrew, the Septuagint, the Greek versions of Symmachus, Theodotion, Aquila, by Oriental versions, Armenian and Coptic, and finally by the other Syriac translations, Heraclean, Philoxenian and especially the &quot;Syro-Hexapla&quot;. The work of Bar Hebraeus is of prime importance for the recovery of these versions and more specially for the &quot;Hexapla&quot; of Origen, of which the &quot;Syro-Hexapla&quot; is a translation by Paul of Tella. His exegetical and doctrinal portions are taken from the Greek Fathers and previous Syriac Orthodox theologians. No complete edition of the work has yet been issued, but many individual books have been published at different times.

===Historical===
Bar Hebraeus has left a large ecclesiastical history called &quot;Makhtbhanuth Zabhne&quot; (&quot;Chronicon&quot;), in which he considers history from the Creation down to his own day. Bar Hebraeus used almost all that had been written before him, showing particular favor to the now lost chronographic records published by Theophilus of Edessa (late 8th century, although he has this only through Michael the Syrian and other dependents). The work is divided into two portions, often transmitted separately.

The first portion deals with political and civil history and is known as the &quot;Chronicon Syriacum&quot;. The standard edition of the &quot;Chronicon Syriacum&quot; is that of Paul Bedjan. An English translation by E. A. Wallis Budge was published in 1932.

This was to give context to the second portion, known as the &quot;Chronicon Ecclesiasticum&quot; and covering the religious history. That section begins with Aaron and consists of a series of entries of important individuals. The first half covers the history of the Syriac Orthodox Church and the Patriarchs of Antioch, while the second half is devoted to the Church of the East, the Nestorian Patriarchs, and the Jacobite Maphrians. The current edition of the &quot;Chronicon Ecclesiasticum&quot; is that of Abbeloos and Lamy, Syriac text, Latin translation. An English translation by David Wilmshurst was published in 2016.

Bar Hebraeus towards the end of his life decided to write a history in Arabic largely based on the &quot;Chronicon Syriacum&quot;, adapted for a wider Arabic-reading readership rather than solely for Syriac-literate clergy. The work became known under the name &quot;al-Mukhtaṣar fi-l-Duwal&quot;. This was first published by Edward Pococke in 1663 with Latin comments and translation. A modern edition was first published by Fr. Anton Salhani in 1890.

===Theological===
In theology Bar Hebraeus was a Miaphysite. He once mused: When I had given much thought and pondered on the matter, I became convinced that these quarrels among the different Christian Churches are not a matter of factual substance, but of words and terminology; for they all confess Christ our Lord to be perfect God and perfect human, without any commingling, mixing, or confusion of the natures... Thus I saw all the Christian communities, with their different christological positions, as possessing a single common ground that is without any difference between them.

In this field, we have from Bar Hebraeus &quot;Menarath Qudhshe&quot;, &quot;Lamp of the Sanctuary&quot;, and the &quot;Kethabha dhe-Zalge&quot;, &quot;Book of Rays&quot;, a summary of the first. These works have not been published, and exist in manuscript in Paris, Berlin, London, Oxford, and Rome. Ascetical and moral theology were also treated by Bar Hebraeus, and we have from him &quot;Kethabha dhe-Ithiqon&quot;, &quot;Book of Ethics&quot;, and &quot;Kethabha dhe-Yauna&quot;, &quot;Book of the Dove&quot;, an ascetical guide. Both have been edited by Bedjan in &quot;Ethicon seu Moralia Gregorii Barhebræi&quot; (Paris and Leipzig, 1898). The &quot;Book of the Dove&quot; was issued simultaneously by Cardahi (Rome, 1898). Bar Hebraeus codified the juridical texts of the Syriac Orthodox, in a collection called &quot;Kethabha dhe-Hudhaye&quot;, &quot;Book of Directions&quot;, edited by Bedjan, &quot;Barhebræi Nomocanon&quot; (Paris, 1898). A Latin translation is to be found in Angelo Mai, &quot;Scriptorum Veter. Nova Collectio&quot;, vol. x.

===Linguistic===
Linguistic works of Gregory Bar Hebraeus resulted from his studies of Syriac language and Syriac literature. He wrote two major grammatical works. First is the &quot;&quot;Book of grammar in the meter of Mor Ephrem&quot;, also known as the &quot;Metrical Grammar&quot;&quot;, written in verses with commentaries, and extant in some 140 copies from various periods. In that work, he referred to his native language both as &quot;Aramaic&quot; (ārāmāytā) and &quot;Syriac&quot; (sûryāyā). His other grammatical work is called the &quot;Book of Splendours&quot; (Ktābā d-ṣemḥe). Both were edited by Paulin Martin in 1872.

===Other works===
Beside previously mentioned, Bar Hebraeus has left many other works on mathematics, astronomy, cosmography, medicine and philosophy, some of which have been published, but others exist only in manuscripts. The more important of them are:
* &quot;Kethabha dhe-Bhabhatha&quot; (Book of the Pupils of the Eyes), a treatise on logic or dialectics
* &quot;Hewath Hekmetha&quot; (Butter of Wisdom), an exposition of the whole philosophy of Aristotle
* &quot;Suloqo Hawnonoyo&quot; (Ascent of the Mind), a treatise on astronomy and cosmography, edited and translated by F. Nau (Paris, 1899)
* various medical works
* &quot;Kethabha dhe-Zalge&quot; (Book of Rays), a treatise on grammar
* ethical works
* poems
* &quot;Kethabha dhe-Thunnaye Mghahkhane&quot; (Book of Entertaining Stories), edited and translated by E. A. Wallis Budge (London, 1897).

A full list of Bar Hebraeus&#x27;s other works, and of editions of such of them as have been published, can be found in several scholarly works.

<doc id="361856" wikidata="Q7070687" url="?curid=361856" title="Nuyorican">
<text>Nuyorican is a portmanteau word blending &quot;New York&quot; (or &quot;Nueva York&quot; in Spanish) and &quot;Puerto Rican,&quot; referring to Puerto Ricans located in or around New York City, their culture, or their descendants (especially those raised or currently living in the New York metropolitan area). This term is sometimes used for Puerto Ricans living in other areas in the Northeastern US Mainland outside New York State as well. The term is also used by Islander Puerto Ricans (Puerto Ricans from Puerto Rico) to differentiate those of Puerto Rican descent from the Puerto Rico-born. 

The term &quot;Nuyorican&quot; is also sometimes used to refer to the Spanish spoken by New York Puerto Ricans. An estimated 1,800,000 Nuyoricans are said to live in New York City, the largest Puerto Rican community outside Puerto Rico. Nuyoricans are not considered Puerto Ricans by some island Puerto Ricans due to cultural differences, which remains a point of controversy among both groups of Puerto Ricans. Despite the controversial label of “Nuyorican” the histories of New York, and Puerto Rico are undeniably intertwined. An infamous example of this would be the Puerto Rican Flag which was created in 1895 New York by Juan de Mata Terreforte along with 59 other exiled independistas. Nuyorican has a broad meaning; originally it meant Puerto Ricans, both island-born and mainland-born, living in New York, but many island-born Puerto Ricans use the term to describe assimilated Americans of Puerto Rican descent living in any US state, or very assimilated people of Puerto Rican ancestry who may be more culturally aligned with African Americans, though still identifying as Puerto Rican. Ethnic enclaves centered on Puerto Ricans include Spanish Harlem, Manhattan; Williamsburg, Brooklyn; Bushwick, Brooklyn; and the South Bronx.

Although Florida has received some dispersal of the population, there has been a resurgence in Puerto Rican migration to New York and New Jersey primarily due to economic and cultural considerations, topped by another surge of arrivals after Hurricane Maria devastated Puerto Rico in September 2017. Consequently, the New York City metropolitan area has witnessed a significant increase in its Nuyorican population, individuals in the region of Puerto Rican descent, increasing from 1,177,430 in 2010 to a Census-estimated 1,494,670 in 2016, maintaining New York&#x27;s status by a significant margin as the most important cultural and demographic center for Puerto Ricans outside San Juan.

== Etymology ==
The &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; cites this word as evolving slowly through roughly the last third of the 20th century, with the first cited reference being poet Jaime Carrero using &quot;neorriqueño&quot; in 1964 as a Spanish-language adjective combining &quot;neoyorquino&quot; and &quot;puertorriqueño&quot;. Many other variants developed along the way, including &quot;neoricano&quot;, &quot;neorican&quot; (also written as &quot;Neo-Rican&quot; and &quot;Neorican&quot;), and &quot;newyorican&quot; (also written as &quot;New Yorrican&quot;). &quot;Nuyorican&quot; itself dates at least from 1975, the date of the first public sessions of the Nuyorican Poets Café. Some of the best known &quot;Nuyoricans&quot; who have written and performed their experiences of being a Puerto Rican in New York are: Miguel Piñero, Miguel Algarín, Piri Thomas, Sandra María Esteves, Willie Colón, Pedro Pietri, and Giannina Braschi. Some of the newer poets include Willie Perdomo, Flaco Navaja, Nancy Mercado, Emanuel Xavier, Edwin Torres, J.L. Torres, Caridad de la Luz aka La Bruja, Lemon Andersen, and Bonafide Rojas.

Historically, the term has been used as a derogatory term by native Puerto Ricans when describing a person that has Puerto Rican ancestry but is born outside of Puerto Rico. It also can sometimes include those born in Puerto Rico who now live elsewhere in the United States (other than New York). This changed from the original meaning with the increase in travel back and forth to different parts of the United States and the globe. The definition includes those born in New York who have moved to Puerto Rico as well.

The term is used by some members of this community to identify their history and cultural affiliation to a common ancestry while being separated from the island, both physically and through language and cultural shifts. This distance created a dual identity that, while still somewhat identifying with the island, recognizes the influences both geography and cultural assimilation have had. Puerto Ricans in other cities have coined similar terms, including &quot;Philly Rican&quot; for Puerto Ricans in Philadelphia, and &quot;Chi-Town Rican&quot; for Puerto Ricans in Chicago.

== History ==
Many Nuyoricans are second- and third-generation Puerto Rican living in mainland USA whose parents or grandparents arrived in the New York metropolitan area during the &quot;Gran Migración&quot; (Great Migration). Puerto Ricans began to arrive in New York City in the nineteenth century but especially following the passage of the Jones-Shafroth Act on March 2, 1917, which granted U.S. citizenship to virtually all Puerto Ricans. The &quot;Gran Migración&quot; accelerated migration from Puerto Rico to New York during the 1940s and 1950s, but such large-scale emigration began to slow by the late 1960s. Due to this large scale immigration there is a huge Puerto Rican influence that can be felt throughout New York. For instance along with African Americans, Puerto Ricans have had a major influence on popular genres of music such as Hip-Hop, which is a genre of music originating out of the inner city neighborhoods of New York. Another significant contribution is the infamous Puerto Rican Day Parade which has its origins in 1958 Spanish Harlem.

In 2000, the Puerto Rican population of New York was over 1,050,000. As of the 2010 census, Puerto Ricans represented 8.9 percent of New York City alone (32% of the city&#x27;s Hispanic community), and 5.5% of New York State as a whole. Of over a million Puerto Ricans in the state, about 70% are present in New York City, with the remaining portion spreading increasingly within the city&#x27;s suburbs and other major cities throughout New York State. Although Florida has received some dispersal of the population, there has been a resurgence in Puerto Rican migration to New York and New Jersey, primarily for economic and cultural considerations, topped by another surge of arrivals after Hurricane Maria devastated Puerto Rico in September 2017 – consequently, the New York City Metropolitan Area has witnessed a significant increase in its Nuyorican population, individuals in the region of Puerto Rican descent, increasing from 1,177,430 in 2010 to a Census-estimated 1,494,670 in 2016.

Historically, Nuyoricans resided in the predominantly Hispanic/Latino section of Upper Manhattan known as Spanish Harlem, and around the Loisaida section of the East Village, but later spread across the city into newly created Puerto Rican/Nuyorican enclaves in Brooklyn, Queens, and the South Bronx. Today, there are fewer island-born Puerto Ricans than mainland-born Puerto Ricans in New York City. Even though Puerto Ricans are one of the most prevalent ethnic groups in New York City, Americans weren’t always so welcoming to their Nuyrorican neighbors. Aside from the racism that Puerto Rican migrants experienced upon moving into the Tri-state area, the U.S government ran a series of eugenicist campaigns throughout the first half of the 20th century known today as La Operación aimed at decreasing the Puerto Rican population on both the Island, and within the states (especially New York). Under these campaigns countless Puerto Rican women were sterilized after being pressured from health care providers or even without their consent. Due to the effectiveness of this campaign its estimated that by 1956, 1 in 3 Puerto Rican women were sterilized.

Prominent figures of the Nuyorican movement include poets and novelists Piri Thomas, Julia de Burgos and Giannina Braschi, while Miguel Algarín, Miguel Piñero, and Pedro Pietri co-founded the Nuyorican Poets Café, a performance space for Nuyorican poets and musicians.&#x27;

<text>The Hongxi Emperor (16 August 1378 – 29 May 1425), also known by his temple name as the Emperor Renzong of Ming, personal name Zhu Gaochi, was the fourth emperor of the Ming dynasty, reigning from 1424 to 1425. He was the eldest son of the Yongle Emperor and Empress Renxiaowen and the maternal grandson of Xu Da, Prince of Zhongshan. He ascended the throne after the death of his father, but his reign lasted less than a year.

The Hongxi Emperor was born on 16 August 1378, as the eldest son of Zhu Di, who was the fourth son of the Hongwu Emperor. After the death of the Hongwu Emperor, Zhu Di emerged victorious in a civil war against the Jianwen Emperor and became the Yongle Emperor in 1402. He prioritized providing his eldest son with a comprehensive education based on Confucian principles. During his father&#x27;s military campaigns, Zhu Gaochi served as a regent in either Nanjing or Beijing.

As soon as the Hongxi Emperor ascended to the throne, he discontinued Zheng He&#x27;s overseas expeditions, halted the trade of tea for horses with Asian nations, and put an end to the gold and pearl missions to Yunnan and Jiaozhi (present-day northern Vietnam). He pardoned officials who had been disgraced by the previous regime and restructured the government, appointing his trusted advisors to key positions. He also strengthened the authority of the Grand Secretariat, the highest governing body. He abandoned his father&#x27;s unpopular militaristic policies, made changes to the financial and tax system, abolished many mandatory provisions, and encouraged the return of displaced peasants, particularly in the lower regions of the Yangtze River. His Confucian ideals influenced the style of governance for the next century.

He made the decision to relocate the capital back to Nanjing. However, just a month later, in May 1425, he died, most likely due to a heart attack. His 26-year-old son, Zhu Zhanji, assumed the throne and carried on his father&#x27;s progressive policies, leaving a lasting influence.

==Early life==
Zhu Gaochi, the future Hongxi Emperor, was born on 16 August 1378, the eldest son of Zhu Di, Prince of Yan, the fourth son of the Hongwu Emperor, and his principal consort, Lady Xu. He received a traditional education in both military and Confucian studies. Due to his poor health and physical condition, he focused mainly on reading and discussing with his tutors. He was uninterested in military matters but had prowess in archery. While his grandfather was impressed with his literary and administrative abilities, his father held his younger sons in higher regard due to their interest in military pursuits. Zhu Gaochi surrounded himself with scholars such as Yang Shiqi, Yang Rong, Yang Pu, and Huang Huai ().

After the death of the Hongwu Emperor in 1398, Zhu Di emerged victorious in the Jingnan campaign, a civil war, and took over the throne as the Yongle Emperor in 1402. While Zhu Di and his younger sons were engaged in the civil war, Zhu Gaochi managed his father&#x27;s territory. In late 1399, during the siege of Beijing, Zhu Gaochi displayed his exceptional organizational and military abilities by successfully defending the city with 10,000 soldiers against Li Jinglong&#x27;s stronger forces. The Yongle Emperor recognized Zhu Gaochi&#x27;s efforts in defending Beijing, but he continued to favor his younger sons who were more inclined towards military matters.

In May 1404, his father created him as crown prince, following the requests of Xie Jin and Huang Huai. During the Yongle Emperor&#x27;s absence from the capital, mainly due to campaigns in Mongolia, he governed the empire with the help of authorized ministers and Grand Secretaries. His policies were influenced by the Grand Secretaries and ministers, causing them to deviate from his father&#x27;s. Additionally, he faced hostility from his younger brothers, Zhu Gaoxu and Zhu Gaosui. In September 1414, when the Yongle Emperor returned from Mongolia, Zhu Gaoxu accused Zhu Gaochi of neglecting his duties. As a result, the emperor punished his advisor, Yang Pu, and Grand Secretaries Huang Huai and Yang Shiqi by imprisoning them or removing them from their positions. Although Zhu Gaoxu&#x27;s threat diminished after being sent to Shandong in 1417, the relationship between him and his father remained strained. Zhu Gaochi did not hold a grudge against his younger brother and even increased his income and gave his sons titles after becoming emperor.

==Ascension==
The Yongle Emperor died on 12 August 1424, while returning from his fifth Mongol campaign. Zhu Gaochi officially became emperor on 7 September 1424, and declared an amnesty. He adopted the era name Hongxi, which means &quot;vastly bright&quot;. A few days prior, he had secured the safety of the capital and sent the eunuch Wang Guitong (, formerly known as Wang Jinghong) to Nanjing as grand defender. He also released from prison the arrested ministers, Xia Yuanji (who had been imprisoned since April 1422), and Wu Zhong (). On 8 September, Xia Yuanji resumed his role as Minister of Revenue, and Wu Zhong also returned to his ministerial position at the same time.

The reorganization of the Grand Secretariat occurred on 9 September. Huang Huai and Yang Pu, who had been imprisoned since 1414, were appointed to it. Yang Shiqi, who was promoted to Senior Grand Secretary, Yang Rong, who remained Grand Secretary, and Jin Youzi () also remained in it. The Grand Secretaries were given the high ranks of vice ministers, elevating their formal status to match their actual influence. Later, they received an even higher first rank and the supernumerary title of minister (of War, Yang Shiqi; of Works, Yang Rong; and of Revenue, Huang Huai), which allowed them to directly participate in government affairs. The emperor worked closely with the Grand Secretaries and ministers, encouraging them to openly discuss matters in meetings. Decisions were made through collective discussion, resulting in the cancellation of the Yongle Emperor&#x27;s unpopular programs.

On 29 October, he elevated his wife, Lady Zhang, to empress. (She served as regent alongside the Grand Secretaries from 1435 until her death in 1442, during the minority of her grandson, Emperor Yingzong.) Three days later, he named his eldest son, Zhu Zhanji, as crown prince and his other sons as princes. He also raised the incomes of members of the imperial family, but maintained their exclusion from involvement in state affairs.

==Reforms==
By the end of 1424, officials who were redundant, incompetent, or too old were dismissed, while those who were successful were promoted. Censors were sent throughout the empire to investigate abuse of power and corruption, and to find capable individuals to fill vacant positions. On 18 October 1424, Grand Secretaries Yang Shiqi, Yang Rong, and Jin Youzi, along with Minister of Personnel, Jian Yi (), were given the authority to confidentially report any misconduct by other officials to the emperor. At the end of the year, Xia Yuanji was also granted this privilege. However, the corrupt Liu Quan () remained as the chief censor, and he was not the only corrupt official who was not removed.

In February 1425, Zheng He was appointed as the grand defender of Nanjing; however, generally, the eunuchs were generally kept under close observation. The changes also affected the civil service examinations, as there was a significant preponderance of candidates from the southern provinces, which outnumbered the northern provinces in terms of population and level of education. The emperor, therefore, decided that 40% of the successful candidates in the metropolitan examinations would be from the North in order to increase the representation of Northerners in the civil service. This policy was maintained by his successors and adopted by the Qing dynasty.

==Domestic and foreign policy==
Confucian morality was emphasized during the Hongxi Emperor&#x27;s reign. He made efforts to rectify the judicial mistakes made by the previous government. Several cases were reevaluated, and by late 1424, the families of officials who had been executed for their loyalty to the Jianwen Emperor were vindicated and their confiscated property was returned. The emperor also reversed some of his own rulings, acknowledging that they had been made in a fit of anger without considering the circumstances.

The aim of his economic policy was to lessen the tax burden on the population, which had significantly increased under the Yongle Emperor due to the expenses of foreign policy. On the day of his enthronement, he put an end to long-distance overseas voyages that had been halted for several years, the trade of tea for horses on the western and northern borders, and the excessive logging in Yunnan and Jiaozhi. His administration encouraged vagrants and the homeless to return to their homes and settle down. Many people had left their homes because of the heavy state taxes and demands of the Yongle government. The Hongxi Emperor promised a two-year tax and work obligation exemption for those who returned. He also dispatched a special investigative commission, led by Zhou Gan (), to Jiangnan (where desertion was prevalent). Based on their reports, the Hongxi Emperor&#x27;s successor, the Xuande Emperor, pardoned the outstanding taxes and reduced the taxes.
He waived taxes for areas that were impacted by disasters and oversaw the distribution of food from government reserves. In these situations, he also lessened the burden of taxes and fees on the people, and eliminated additional taxes on resources such as wood, gold, and silver. He reprimanded officials who did not demonstrate enough effort in aiding the population.

The Hongxi Emperor halted military campaigns into Mongolia and focused on strengthening the empire&#x27;s northern outposts. He put an end to long-distance voyages, but maintained normal relations with other countries, such as those in Central Asia. The Hongxi government&#x27;s main military concern was the ongoing war in Jiaozhi. The emperor recalled Huang Fu () from his position in Jiaozhi (where he had been the head of civil administration and surveillance commissioner since 1407) and replaced him with Chen Zhi (), Earl of Yongchang, but the army was not reinforced and the Viet rebellion continued. Historians view Huang Fu&#x27;s recall negatively and consider it to be the main reason for the Ming dynasty&#x27;s defeat, as he was highly experienced and respected in the province.

One month before his death, the Hongxi Emperor made a bold decision to move the capital back to Nanjing. This move was primarily influenced by Xia Yuanji and other high-ranking officials due to financial concerns. The emperor himself preferred Nanjing over the northern region. On 16 April 1425, he declared the Beijing authorities as &quot;temporary&quot; (, &quot;xingzai&quot;) and two weeks later, he sent his successor, Zhu Zhanji, to Nanjing. However, the transfer did not actually take place as the emperor died and his successor, who was more aligned with the policies of the Yongle Emperor and did not share the Hongxi Emperor&#x27;s disapproval of the northern focus of government, cancelled the plan.

==Death and legacy==
The Hongxi Emperor died suddenly in Beijing on 29 May 1425, most likely from a heart attack. This is not surprising considering his obesity and difficulty with walking. He was given the posthumous name Emperor Zhao (; &#x27;Luminous Emperor&#x27;) and the temple name Renzong (; &#x27;Benevolent Ancestor&#x27;). His Xian Mausoleum, located near Beijing, was built in a simple and austere style, reflecting the manner of his reign.

The emperor had ten sons and seven daughters, but only nine sons and four daughters survived to adulthood. The eldest son, Zhu Zhanji, was the crown prince from November 1424. He was the son of Empress Zhang. When the Hongxi Emperor died, Zhu Zhanji became the Xuande Emperor and took over the throne.

The main objective of the Hongxi Emperor was to put an end to the actions of the Yongle government that he deemed incorrect and un-Confucian. He aimed to create a Confucian government that would serve as a model, with a morally upright emperor at the helm and wise and virtuous ministers. The relocation of the capital to Nanjing was also a clear indication of a departure from the Yongle Emperor&#x27;s aggressive expansionist approach, which focused heavily on the northern border.

Even after the death of the Hongxi Emperor, the empire was still governed by the Grand Secretaries and ministers he had chosen. They first served as advisors and ministers to his son, the Xuande Emperor, and later under the leadership of his widow, Empress Zhang, but they gradually died out in the first half of the 1440s. Due to his untimely death, the Hongxi Emperor was unable to fully achieve his goals. The Confucian-educated officials were not able to completely gain the support of other groups within the Ming elites. They were also unable to eliminate the independent agencies of the eunuchs and prevent their growth under the Xuande Emperor and his successors. Despite this, they remained the dominant group in the Ming government and were responsible for managing the day-to-day affairs of the state until the end of the dynasty. As a result, the spirit of the Hongxi Emperor&#x27;s rule, which was influenced by Confucian ideals, continued to persist. He was seen as a moderate emperor, surrounded by educated ministers and sympathetic to the people, and served as a model for future generations. Additionally, none of the Hongxi Emperor&#x27;s successors actually wanted to move the capital back to Nanjing, and that policy was officially abandoned in 1441.

Chinese historians, who shared Confucian values with the bureaucracy, praised the Hongxi Emperor as an exemplary ruler who consolidated the empire by reversing the costly and unpopular programs of the previous government. Although he was occasionally criticized for his impulsiveness in punishing officials who displeased him, he was able to acknowledge his mistakes and apologize for them. His faults were balanced by his humanity and sincere pursuit of the public interest.

<text>Nielsen Audio (formerly Arbitron) is a consumer research company in the United States that collects listener data on radio broadcasting audiences. It was founded as the American Research Bureau by Jim Seiler in 1949 and became national by merging with Los Angeles-based Coffin, Cooper, and Clay in the early 1950s. The company&#x27;s initial business was the collection of broadcast television ratings.

The company changed its name to Arbitron in the mid‑1960s, the namesake of the Arbitron System, a centralized statistical computer with leased lines to viewers&#x27; homes to monitor their activity. Deployed in New York City, it gave instant ratings data on what people were watching. A reporting board lit up to indicate which homes were listening to which broadcasts. For years, Arbitron was a part of Control Data Corporation (CDC) and in 1992, it became a part of Ceridian Corporation before the company was split in 2001. The then-current Arbitron was formed from the renaming of the old Ceridian Corporation while the spin-off firm took the Ceridian Corporation name and acted as accounting successor.

On December 18, 2012, The Nielsen Company announced that it would acquire Arbitron, its only competitor, for US$1.26 billion. The acquisition closed on September 30, 2013, and the company was re-branded as Nielsen Audio. As a condition of the deal to allow a monopoly, Nielsen must license its ratings data and technology to a third party for eight years.

== Methods ==

=== Survey ===
Arbitron&#x27;s syndicated radio ratings service collects data by selecting a random sample of a population throughout the United States, primarily in 294 metropolitan areas, using a paper diary service 2‑4 times a year and the Portable People Meter (PPM) electronic audience measurement service 365 days a year.

The term commonly used in the radio industry for these ratings is &quot;Arbitron book&quot;, a carryover from the era when ratings were published in a softcover report that was mailed to clients. More specifically, in the diary-measured markets these reports were called the &quot;Spring book&quot;, &quot;Summer book&quot;, &quot;Fall book&quot;, and &quot;Winter book&quot;. Between these &quot;books&quot;, Arbitron releases interim monthly reports called &quot;Arbitrends&quot;, which contain data from the previous three months known as &quot;rolling average&quot; reports. The two interim reports would be known, for example, as &quot;Spring, Phase I&quot; and &quot;Spring, Phase II&quot;.

Arbitron recruits diary survey respondents to note their listening habits in a seven-day paper diary and mail it back to Arbitron. The respondents are paid a small cash incentive for their participation. Turnaround time for release of data from the end of the survey period is approximately three weeks.

After collection, the data is marketed to radio broadcasters, radio networks, cable TV companies, advertisers, advertising agencies, out-of-home advertising companies, and the online radio industry. Major ratings products include &quot;cume&quot; (the cumulative number of unique listeners over a period), average quarter hour (AQH sharethe average number of people listening in a given 15‑minute period), time spent listening (TSL), and market breakdowns by age, gender, and race/ethnicity. The &quot;cume&quot; only counts a listener once, whereas the AQH is a product of &quot;cume&quot; and time spent listening. For example, if you looked into a room and saw Fred and Jane, then 15 minutes later saw Fred with Sara. The &quot;cume&quot; would be 3 (Fred, Jane, Sara) and the AQH would be 2 (an average of two people in the room in a given 15‑minute period).

=== Portable People Meter ===
Responding to requests from its customers—radio broadcasters, ad agencies and advertisers—that expressed their interest in the collection of more accurate ratings data, Arbitron introduced the Portable People Meter (PPM) service in 2007.

The PPM is a wearable portable device, much like a pager or mobile phone, that electronically gathers subaudible codes that identify the source of a broadcast, such as a radio station. Arbitron recruits and compensates a cross-section of consumers to wear the meter for an average of one year and up to two years. The audience estimates generated from each monthly survey are used as the buy/sell currency for radio stations and advertisers/agencies.

As of December 2009, the PPM was measured in 33 media markets, including Houston, Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, New York City, Atlanta, Detroit, Long Island, Middlesex-Somerset-Union, Chicago, Los Angeles, Riverside-San Bernardino, San Francisco, Jacksonville, Baltimore, and San Jose. By 2010, 48 markets are being measured using the PPM.

<text>Meir Leibush ben Yehiel Michel Wisser (March 7, 1809 – September 18, 1879), better known as the Malbim (), was a rabbi, master of Hebrew grammar, and Bible commentator. The name &quot;Malbim&quot; was derived from the Hebrew initials of his name. He used this acronym as his surname in all his published works and became known by it in common usage. His writings do not include works about Kohelet or Eicha.

==Biography==

Malbim was born in Volochysk, Volhynia, to Yehiel Michel Wisser. His father educated him in Hebrew and the Talmud. After being orphaned as a child, Meïr was cared for and educated by his stepfather, Rabbi Leib of Volochysk.

At the age of 13, he went to study in Warsaw where he became known as &quot;the Illui from Volhynia.&quot; At age fourteen, he married but shortly thereafter divorced. The Malbim showed talent from his early childhood, and his works indicate that he had considerable knowledge of secular sciences and history. From 1838 to 1845, he served as rabbi of Wreschen. In the latter year, he was called to the rabbinate of Kempen, where he remained until 1859. He was thereafter also known as &quot;der Kempener Magid&quot;.

His first major work, published at age 25, was &quot;Artzas HaChaim—&quot;a commentary on &quot;Orach Chaim&quot;.

In 1859, Malbim became chief rabbi of Bucharest, Romania. He had disagreements with the upper class and educated Jews there; some of them Austrian citizens (called in Romanian &quot;sudiţi&quot;) led by the noted Dr. Iuliu Barasch. They wanted to introduce changes in the spirit of modern European life into the life of the local Jewry as was done in some Reform congregations. Malbim defended the traditional style of Orthodox Judaism, which demanded strict adherence to Jewish law and tradition. He rejected almost all suggestions to edit the Siddur, give up beards or other distinctions of exterior appearance, or make other changes in observance.

Malbim opposed the construction of the Choral Temple which would be equipped with a choir and organ similar to the Great Synagogue of Leopoldstadt in Vienna. He thought this was too Christian in style. In 1864, the Choral Temple became the main neo-orthodox synagogue in Romania. He also condemned the founding (before he arrived) of the first two elementary schools in Bucharest for Jewish children to offer a general knowledge curriculum. In this period, Romanian officials encouraged such efforts to integrate the Jews into mainstream Romanian life.

Malbim&#x27;s insistence on adhering to the halakha, such as daily inspection of butcher&#x27;s knives, resulted in portions of the religious personnel (e.g., shochtim and dayanim) becoming hostile toward him. Through their frequent complaints, his opponents almost succeeded in having him sent to prison. Malbim was freed through the intervention of Sir Moses Montefiore upon the condition that he leave Romania.
Malbim went to Constantinople and complained to the Turkish government but obtained no satisfaction. After staying six months in Paris, he went to Lunshitz, in Russian Poland, as successor to his deceased father-in-law, Hayyim Auerbach (1866). Shortly afterward, he became rabbi at Kherson and thence was called to the rabbinate of Mogilev on the Dnieper (1870). There, too, he was a staunch supporter of Judaism and was resented by the richer Jews; they denounced him as a political criminal, and the governor of Moghilev forced him to leave the town.

Malbim went to Königsberg as chief rabbi of the Polish community, but his conflicts with Reform Jews continued. Malbim visited Vilna in 1879, where the community would have appointed him as rabbi, but the governor of Vilna opposed the election. He did not want to sanction the appointment of a rabbi who had been expelled from Moghilev as a political criminal. Malbim also declined an offer to be chief rabbi of the Orthodox in New York City. In September 1879, Malbim was traveling to Kremenchuk, where he had been called as rabbi, when he fell sick. He died on Rosh HaShanah 5640 in Kyiv.

== Methodology and style ==

Malbim&#x27;s fame and popularity rest upon his novel commentary on the Bible. His first published commentary was on Megillat Esther (1845), followed by his commentary on most of the Hebrew Tanakh from then until 1876. His commentary on the Bible is based most notably upon his principle that there are no true synonyms in the Tanakh; apparent stylistic repetitions are not that, but rather each introduces a distinct idea. His approach is described as follows:

:&quot;Advancing a project initiated in Ya‘akov Mecklenberg’s Pentateuch commentary, Malbim formulates 613 grammatical principles to justify rabbinic halakhic exegesis in &quot;Sifra&quot; and elsewhere. To demonstrate the sanctity of scripture, Malbim devised a unique hermeneutic that he ambitiously applied to the entire Bible, resulting in one of the monumental Jewish scholarly achievements of the era: a wide-ranging, comprehensive commentary ... that infuses traditional Hebrew linguistic, philosophical, and mystical learning with contemporary concepts from science, psychology, epistemology, logic, and metaphysics.&quot;
According to his method, there is no repetition or duplication in the verses, and no expression comes to the &quot;glory of reading&quot; (as claimed, for example, by Ibn Ezra).

Its interpretation of the Torah consists of two parts intertwined with each other: In the parts on which there are halachic midrash, the commentary is actually on the halachic midrash. He discusses them in comparison to simplifying the verses while being precise in biblical grammar. The first midrash on which the commentary was written is the Sifrah, and as a background for his commentary he wrote a treatise called &quot;Ayelet HaShahar&quot; in which he formulates 613 (Taryag) rules from which all the halachic laws are derived: 248 (Ramah) rules deal with the syntax of the law and 365 rules deal with semantic grammars and the differences between words. At the end of each rule there is a reference to which laws in the book express it, and indeed all the laws of the book are mapped to rules. Also in his commentaries on the Mechilta and the Sifre written after that, there are references to the rules in the Ayelet Hashahar from which they were derived, and in his introduction to &quot;Ayelet Hashahar&quot; he invites the Torah sages to analyze all of the halachic midrash in the Talmud in this way. 

In the parts that do not have halachic midrash, he interprets the story according to the depth of the simplicity, when at the beginning of each story he presents questions to which he answers, similar to the interpretation of Rabbi Izaac Abarbanel. Even in these commentaries of his, especially on the Book of Genesis, there is a lot of halachic innovation, compared to other commentaries in which the main halachic discussion stems from precisions only in the verses that deal with halachic, such as in the parashat Mishpatim, for example. Malbim had a broad education which he used in his commentaries, and thus we find several times in his commentary mentions of Philo of Alexandria, Kant and other philosophers, as well as the words of the learned who preceded him.

&quot;Mikra&#x27;ei Kodesh&quot;, a commentary to the Prophets and Hagiographa, is also about the depth of simplicity and relative length compared to other commentaries. It consists of a short part of the &quot;interpretation of the words&quot; and a long part of a systematic interpretation of the biblical text in question. Its commentaries have a different name for each book.

<text>Truman State University (TSU or Truman) is a public liberal arts university in Kirksville, Missouri, United States. It had 3,636 enrolled students in the fall of 2023 pursuing degrees in 55 undergraduate and twelve graduate programs.

The university is named for U.S. President Harry Truman, who was a Missouri native. From 1972 until 1996, the school was known as Northeast Missouri State University.

== History ==
Truman State University was founded in 1867 by Joseph Baldwin as the &quot;North Missouri Normal School and Commercial College&quot;. Baldwin was a pioneer in education, and his school quickly gained official recognition in 1870 by the Missouri General Assembly, which designated it as the &quot;First District Normal School&quot;, the first public teachers&#x27; college in Missouri.

The school served a district comprising 26 counties: including Adair, Audrain, Boone, Callaway, Chariton, Clark, Howard, Knox, Lewis, Lincoln, Linn, Marion, Macon, Monroe, Montgomery, Pike, Putnam, Ralls, Randolph, St. Charles, Schuyler, Scotland, Shelby, Sullivan, and Warren.

Purple and white were adopted as the school&#x27;s official colors after Basil Brewer wrote a school song entitled &quot;The Purple and the White.&quot; They have remained as the school colors since.

In 1919, the school was renamed &quot;Northeast Missouri State Teachers College&quot;. For the next four decades, it was commonly called &quot;Kirksville State&quot;.

In 1924, a fire destroyed old Baldwin Hall and the library. The lake that once filled the current quadrangle, or &quot;The Quad&quot; (a prominent feature in pre-1924 photographs), was pumped dry in a futile attempt to douse the fire. The Quad now serves as a popular gathering place where students study play games, hold events, such as small concerts and fairs, and meet with one another.

The school&#x27;s mission broadened significantly over the years, and by the 1960s, it was no longer simply a teacher-training school. Reflecting this, it was renamed &quot;Northeast Missouri State College&quot; in 1968.

Only four years later, in 1972, it was renamed Northeast Missouri State University (NMSU). On June 20, 1985, Governor John Ashcroft signed legislation designating the university as Missouri&#x27;s only statewide public liberal arts and sciences university. This changed the school&#x27;s focus from regional to statewide. As such, nearly 100 programs were dropped in six years, including all two-year programs that did not fulfill the liberal arts mission.

Coinciding with the tenth anniversary of the university&#x27;s mission change, Governor Mel Carnahan signed legislation changing its name to &quot;Truman State University&quot;. The new name became official on July 1, 1996, and the university remains designated by statute as Missouri&#x27;s public liberal arts and sciences institution.

In the 2024, U.S. News &amp; World Report placed Truman fifth among Midwest Regional Universities, while &quot;Forbes&quot; placed Truman #237 among National Universities.

=== Presidents ===

== Board of Governors ==
Truman&#x27;s Board of Governors consists of ten members. Each member is appointed by the Governor of Missouri to serve a four-year term, with a student representative serving for two years. The ten members must meet residential requirements defined by Missouri law. The Board of Governors also includes four committees: the Finance and Audit Committee, the Budget and Capital Projects Committee, the Honorary Degrees Committee, and the Truman State University Foundation Board of Directors.

== Campus ==


The campus is located on the south side of Kirksville. Truman&#x27;s main campus is situated around a slightly wooded quadrangle, also known as the &quot;Quad.&quot; It is two blocks south of the town square, which includes an eight-screen movie theatre and various eateries and shops.

Notable buildings on campus include Pickler Memorial Library, the Kirk Memorial, the Kirk Building, Magruder Hall, McClain Hall, Baldwin Hall, Violette Hall, Barnett Hall, Ophelia Parrish, Pershing Arena, the Student Union Building and the Recreation Center (&quot;The Rec&quot;). The oldest building is not Kirk Building but is instead the purple-doored Physical Plant building located between the Health Services building and Magruder Hall.

Pickler Memorial Library was named after Samuel M. Pickler, who donated funds to rebuild the library after it was destroyed by fire in 1924. Renovated in 1993, it now houses the main computer lab, as well as approximately 500,000 volumes of various works. The front lobby area of Pickler Memorial Library is known as &quot;the Bubble&quot; for its curved glass atrium.

Kirk Memorial is a small, domed structure near the center of campus. The structure is dedicated to John Kirk, the fifth president of the university. It formerly housed Truman&#x27;s debate team and now houses a few administrative offices. The Kirk Building was once the university&#x27;s combined gymnasium and auditorium facility. 

The Rec is located north of Centennial Hall. It also offers a gymnasium for a variety of sports, a weight room, an elevated track, various exercise equipment, and a small multipurpose gym for hockey, indoor soccer, and other indoor sports. 

There are seven main academic buildings. Magruder Hall is the science building and houses the departments of Chemistry, Physics, Biology, and Agriculture. McClain Hall serves as both an administrative and academic building. For the academic portion, Classical &amp; Modern Languages, Economics, English &amp; Linguistics, History, Philosophy &amp; Religion, and Political Science can be found there. Baldwin Hall is connected to McClain Hall and houses the campus auditorium that is best known for hosting cultural events through the Kohlenberg-Lyceum Series. Violette Hall, named after former history professor E.M. Violette, is home to the School of Business, the Mathematics and Computer Science Department, and the Education Department. Ophelia Parrish (OP) is home to the Art, Music, and Theatre Departments; it is named after Ms. Ophelia Parrish (1850-1915), the college&#x27;s first librarian. Barnett Hall is home to the departments of Anthropology, Geography, and Sociology; Communication; Justice Systems; Psychology; ROTC; and Nursing programs. Finally, the Pershing Building, also home to the basketball team&#x27;s Pershing Arena, houses the Departments of Health and Exercise Science and Communication Disorders.

Services available on campus to students include the student health center, career center, and writing center. The health center is closed on the weekends and holidays. The career center is located on the first floor of the Student Union Building and provides help to students in determining a career path, selecting a major, developing career skills, helping put together a resume, or even conducting mock interviews. The writing center is located on the first floor of the Library and offers critique and editing for student papers.

== Academics ==
=== Admissions ===
Freshman admission to the university is based upon a holistic review of a candidate&#x27;s academic record. Basic requirements are high school performance and any standardized test scores. Admissions decisions are also based on a mandatory application essay, the applicant&#x27;s resume including special abilities and talents, and the applicant&#x27;s high school and extracurricular record. All applicants must have 4 credits of English, 3 credits of math, 3 credits of science, 2 credits of foreign language, 2 credits of social studies, and 1 credit of fine art. According to the Princeton Review, Truman has a selectivity rating of 90 out of 99 with an 80% acceptance rate.

Those accepted that submitted test scores had an average 1070-1330 SAT score (10% submitting scores) or average 23-29 ACT score (77% submitting scores).

===Rankings===

In addition to the &quot;Academic rankings&quot; listed to the right, for 2025, &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; ranked Truman #1 in Top Public Schools, and #11 in Best Value Schools, of all Regional Universities Midwest. Truman has a 12:1 student/faculty ratio and 67% of
classes have fewer than 20 students.

=== The Liberal Studies program ===
On July 20, 1985, the state of Missouri charged Truman State University with serving as the state&#x27;s public liberal arts and sciences university. To meet this commitment to the people of Missouri, the Truman faculty and administration created the Liberal Studies Program, the general education curriculum undergraduates complete to receive a Truman degree.

=== Schools ===

The academic programs at Truman State University are organized within three schools: Arts and Humanities, Science and Mathematics, and Business and Professional Studies.

The School of Arts and Humanities is the home of the departments of Art and Design, Communication and Theatre Arts, English, Languages and Linguistics, Music, and Social Sciences and Human Inquiry. The School offers degrees in Art, Classics, Communication, Creative Writing, Criminal Justice Studies, English, History, Linguistics, Modern Language, Music, Philosophy and Religion, Political Science and International Relations, Sociology and Anthropology, and Theatre.

The School of Science and Mathematics includes the departments of Agricultural and Biological Sciences, Computer and Data Sciences, Health Science, Mathematics, and Physical Sciences. The School offers degrees in Agricultural Science, Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Biology, Chemistry, Computer Science, Data Science, Health Science, Mathematics, Physics, and Statistics. The school also offers Missouri&#x27;s only undergraduate interdisciplinary degree program in mathematical biology which has connections and resources available through the Intercollegiate Biomathematics Alliance. The school also coordinates the Missouri Pre-STEM Pathways Program with Moberly Area Community College, Metropolitan Community College, and St. Charles Community College.

The School of Business and Professional Studies houses the departments of Business and Economics, Communication Disorders, Education, Exercise Science, Military Science, Nursing, and Psychology and Counseling.

== Campus life ==
=== Student organizations ===

Truman offers approximately 250 different student organizations including a chapter of Phi Beta Kappa.

An organization that has garnered considerable attention since its inception is the Bulldog Student Investment Fund, a group in which student analysts invest a portion of the university&#x27;s endowment in public equities to outperform the market. The organization hopes to eventually use the proceeds from the fund&#x27;s returns to sponsor scholarships for Truman students. In 2015, members from the Bulldog Student Investment Fund, representing Truman State, achieved the first place prize among the five competing universities in the St. Louis CFA Institute Challenge and went on to compete at nationals. In 2017, members from the Bulldog Student Investment Fund repeated this achievement. 

==== Greek life ====

Approximately 20% of the student body is affiliated with a social Greek organization. Truman hosts six sororities and ten fraternities.

=== Campus lore and traditions ===

*The weather vane atop Kirk Memorial is welded in place so that it will always point northeast, in honor of the school&#x27;s previous name and its location.
*The annual football game against Northwest Missouri State University was established in 1930 when Northwest president Uel W. Lamkin sent Fair a polished hickory stick from the farm where the former president Eugene Fair was born. The &quot;Hickory Stick&quot; was contested annually until 2013, when Truman and Northwest Missouri began competing in different athletic conferences.
*A tradition has arisen in which students attach wads of gum to a designated tree known as the &quot;Gum Tree.&quot; It is believed that a ban on gum chewing in class started a tradition of discarding gum inside a hollow suit of armor sometime in the 1920s, and that eventually this was replaced by the Gum Tree. Students leave their gum on the tree to bring them good luck on exams. 

==Athletics==
Truman is a member of NCAA Division II and plays in the Great Lakes Valley Conference (GLVC), joining the conference in 2013 after having been a member of the Mid-America Intercollegiate Athletics Association (MIAA) since that league&#x27;s creation in 1912. Because the GLVC did not sponsor wrestling until the 2016–17 season, that team remained in the MIAA.

The athletic department sponsors 20 teams, ten each for men and women. Among Truman&#x27;s most recent successes include: four regional championships for women&#x27;s volleyball, a regional berth for men&#x27;s basketball in 2006, a College World Series appearance for baseball, and undefeated regular seasons for both men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s soccer. The women&#x27;s swim team won six consecutive NCAA Women&#x27;s Swimming and Diving Championships national titles for Division II between 2001 and 2006 and won again in 2008 again beating the in-state rival Drury University.

<doc id="361879" wikidata="Q1195977" url="?curid=361879" title="Obadiah ben Jacob Sforno">
<text>Ovadia ben Jacob Sforno (Obadja Sforno, Hebrew: עובדיה ספורנו) was an Italian rabbi, Biblical commentator, philosopher and physician. A member of the Sforno family, he was born in Cesena about 1475 and died in Bologna in 1549.

== Biography ==
After acquiring in his native town a thorough knowledge of Hebrew, rabbinic literature, mathematics, and philosophy, he went to Rome to study medicine. There his learning won for him a prominent place among scholars; and when Reuchlin was at Rome (1498-1500) and desired to perfect his knowledge of Hebrew literature, Cardinal Domenico Grimani advised him to apply to Obadiah.

Equally high was Obadiah&#x27;s reputation as a casuist. Meïr Katzenellenbogen consulted him on legal questions, and Joseph Colon invoked his authority. At the request of Israel ben Jehiel Ashkenazi, rabbi of Rome, Obadiah issued a decision in the case of Donina, daughter of Samuel Ẓdarfati, the renowned physician of the pope. About 1525 Obadiah left Rome and led for some time a wandering life. From several letters of that epoch addressed to his brother Hananeel at Bologna it would appear that Obadiah was in poor circumstances. Finally he settled at Bologna, where he founded a yeshiva (school of advanced Jewish studies) which he conducted until his death.

== Works ==
Obadiah was an indefatigable writer, chiefly in biblical exegesis. His exegetical work is characterized by respect for the text&#x27;s literal meaning and a reluctance to entertain mystical interpretations.

He possessed well-known judgment in selecting explanations from earlier exegetes, such as Rashi, Abraham ibn Ezra, the Rashbam, and Nahmanides, and he very often gave original interpretations that showed extensive philological knowledge.

He wrote the following commentaries: on the Torah (1567); on Song of Songs and Ecclesiastes, with the latter being dedicated to Henry II of France; on the Psalms (1586); &quot;Mishpaṭ Ẓedeḳ&quot;, on the Book of Job (1589); on the books of Jonah, Habakkuk, and Zechariah, published with David ibn Hin&#x27;s &quot;Likkute Shoshannim&quot; (1724). He also wrote &quot;Kavanat ha-Torah,&quot; which is prefixed to the Pentateuch commentary.

Obadiah was also active in religious philosophy. In a work entitled &quot;Or Ammim&quot; (Bologna, 1537), he endeavored to combat with biblical arguments the theories of Aristotle on the eternity of matter, on God&#x27;s omniscience, and on the universality of the soul, as well as various other Aristotelian views that, in his view, conflicted with religion.

In the introduction, Obadiah says he was induced to write his work because even so great a man as Maimonides had expressed that all Aristotle&#x27;s theories concerning the sublunary world are correct. Obadiah himself translated the &quot;Or Ammim&quot; into Latin and sent it to Henry II of France. It was published in 1548.

<text>Remington Steele is an American television series co-created by Robert Butler and Michael Gleason. The series, starring Stephanie Zimbalist and Pierce Brosnan, was produced by MTM Enterprises and first broadcast on NBC from October 1, 1982, to February 17, 1987. The series blended the genres of romantic comedy, drama, detective procedural and (towards the end of the series) international political intrigue and espionage.

&quot;Remington Steele&quot; premise is that Laura Holt, a licensed private investigator (Stephanie Zimbalist) opened a detective agency under her own name but found potential clients refused to hire a woman, no matter how qualified. To solve the problem, Laura invents a fictitious male superior she names Remington Steele. Through a series of events in the first episode, &quot;License to Steele&quot;, Pierce Brosnan&#x27;s character, a former thief and con man (whose real name even he proves not to know and is never revealed), assumes the identity of Remington Steele. Behind the scenes, a power struggle ensues between Laura and Steele as to who is really in charge, while the two carry on a casual romantic relationship.

==Cast==

===Main===
* Stephanie Zimbalist as Laura Holt, a private investigator who starts her own business, which really took off after she created a fictional male boss, and more so after Steele becomes an actual person.
* Pierce Brosnan as Remington Steele, a mysterious man who assumes the figurehead role as the boss and namesake of Holt&#x27;s agency. He does not have any actual experience as a detective, but learns quickly. He often makes references to old films, and his behavior and instincts often gives Holt insight towards solving the mystery. Although he has worked mostly as a con man and thief in the past, he stays loyal to Holt.
* James Read as Murphy Michaels (season 1), an investigator who works for Holt; he and Foxe have known Steele is not a real detective. He has an underlying rivalry with him for Holt&#x27;s affections. In the season 2 premiere, it is said he moved to Denver to start his own private practice.
* Janet DeMay as Bernice Foxe (season 1), Holt&#x27;s secretary and receptionist who also helped keep up the fictional boss act. In the season 2 premiere, it is said she married a trombone player and moved to New York.
* Doris Roberts as Mildred Krebs (seasons 2–5), a former IRS agent who becomes Steele&#x27;s secretary / receptionist.
* Jack Scalia as Tony Roselli (season 5), a mysterious guy who gets involved in Holt and Steele&#x27;s life after their honeymoon in Mexico, as a rival for Holt&#x27;s affections. He uses his connections to the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service to track the two down and also to get Steele to help him out. Gleason conceived of Roselli as a contrast to Steele&#x27;s character, being like a &quot;beer to Remington&#x27;s champagne&quot;, but that he was also a &quot;very good-looking guy&quot;.

===Recurring===
* Blake Clark as Fred, Steele&#x27;s chauffeur whenever he does any formal traveling
* Beverly Garland as Abigail Holt, Laura&#x27;s mother
* Cassandra Harris (Pierce Brosnan&#x27;s then wife) as Felicia, one of Steele&#x27;s old flames (three episodes), and Anna, a mysterious woman from Steele&#x27;s past (one episode)
* Efrem Zimbalist Jr. (father of Stephanie) as Daniel Chalmers, a charming con man who was Steele&#x27;s mentor. At the end of the series, he is revealed to be his biological father.
* Gary Frank as Detective James Jarvis, a less-than-competent police detective who more often than not falsely accused the principal characters and their clients of murder
* Michael Constantine as George Edward Mulch, a businessman with far-fetched ideas looking only for fame and fortune
* James Tolkan as Norman Keyes, an insurance investigator bent on proving Steele to be a fraud

==Episodes==

==Significance and influence==
&quot;Remington Steele&quot; is best known for having launched the career of Pierce Brosnan and for serving as a forerunner of the similar, edgier series &quot;Moonlighting,&quot; and was also an influential part of television history in its own right. Recent evaluations, in the wake of the show&#x27;s full release on DVD, conclude that &quot;Steele&quot; was solidly crafted, well acted and groundbreaking in its own way. Other recent evaluations have also noted that series has aged better than some other series of its time and genre.

===Innovations===
&quot;Remington Steele&quot; referred to film noir in the mystery storylines. It subverted 1970s detective show conventions by telling its stories from the point of view of an independent, professional woman. At a time when hour-long series were serious and half-hour series were humorous, &quot;Steele&quot; incorporated multiple styles of comedy into the standard detective format. It pioneered the slowly evolving &quot;will they or won&#x27;t they&quot; relationship arc that is now common to television drama of all genres.

===Laura Holt as role model===
In an interview recorded in 2005 for a DVD special feature, &quot;Remington Steele&quot; co-creator Michael Gleason and star Stephanie Zimbalist discuss the large number of women who have approached them over the years to express their appreciation for the character of Laura Holt. Speaking of the women she meets, Zimbalist said: &quot;They are extraordinary women... They are interesting. They do interesting things. They are smart. They&#x27;re independent. They&#x27;re sort of, what my character was – and I meet them all the time&quot;.

Also in 2005, Robin Rauzi published an article in the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; saying that Laura Holt was her hero. In a subsequent interview Rauzi elaborated, saying that Laura &quot;was one of the only examples of an unmarried modern career woman on TV that I could identify with at that time&quot; and that Laura &quot;didn’t seem that far away from who I was and who I could be&quot;. Rauzi concludes: &quot;I’ve decided to stop being embarrassed to say &quot;Remington Steele&quot; changed my life. It did and for the better&quot;.

==Series history==

===Development===
&quot;Remington Steele’s&quot; initial premise was conceived in 1969 by long-time television director Robert Butler as a series featuring a solo female private investigator. Butler pitched the idea to Grant Tinker before he was head of MTM, but Tinker felt the series was ahead of its time. In January 1980, following the success of several sitcoms featuring working women, including the groundbreaking &quot;The Mary Tyler Moore Show&quot;, Butler and Tinker, now head of MTM, revived the concept. MTM Vice President of Programming Stu Erwin felt Butler&#x27;s concept was only &quot;half a show&quot; and suggested that Butler work with veteran writer Michael Gleason to expand the premise. Imagining Holt&#x27;s fictional boss, Gleason proposed to Butler: &quot;Wouldn’t it be great if he showed up and made her crazy?&quot; In 1981, Gleason, Butler, Erwin and Tinker pitched the series to NBC and were initially rejected by executives who failed to &quot;get&quot; the premise. Shortly thereafter, Tinker left MTM to become chairman of NBC, then the number-three network, and subsequently a pilot was ordered.

Stephanie Zimbalist, an established actress with roles in several television movies, was approached for the role of Laura Holt. At first she turned the series down, not wishing to be tied down to one show, but had a late-night change of heart. Pierce Brosnan (best known then for his role in &quot;The Manions of America&quot;) auditioned for the role of Remington Steele but was initially refused by NBC executives who were concerned that Brosnan was a relative unknown in America. MTM&#x27;s Stu Erwin stood firm in a face-to-face meeting with NBC executive Brandon Tartikoff, and Tartikoff relented.

Originally, NBC asked for a pilot that imagined the series six months into its run, with the characters already working together in the detective agency. This pilot was produced in February and March 1982 and was eventually aired with revisions as &quot;Tempered Steele&quot;. NBC had some concerns about audience confusion over this episode, but ultimately agreed to schedule the series for the 1982–83 season. NBC also asked for a premise pilot which told the story of how Laura Holt met the man who became Remington Steele. This second pilot, &quot;License to Steele&quot;, became the first episode aired in the series.

===Season 1===
The first season included two recurring characters: Murphy Michaels, a detective and rival for Laura&#x27;s affections, played by James Read; and Bernice Foxe, the secretary-receptionist, played by Janet DeMay. Both Murphy and Bernice knew that Remington Steele was a fraud. Episodes in the first season set in motion the slow evolution of the romantic relationship between Laura and &quot;Mr. Steele&quot; (she never called him &quot;Remington&quot; until the show&#x27;s fifth season after they were &quot;married&quot;) while revealing elements of the characters&#x27; backstory. The first season established the pattern where each episode made direct reference to an old movie (for example, &quot;The Maltese Falcon&quot; and &quot;The Thomas Crown Affair&quot;, which was remade in 1999 with Pierce Brosnan in the lead role of Thomas Crown). Key episodes include &quot;Thou Shalt Not Steele&quot;, which introduced Laura&#x27;s mother and Felicia, a woman from Steele&#x27;s past; &quot;Sting of Steele&quot;, which introduced Daniel Chalmers (Efrem Zimbalist Jr., the real-life father of Stephanie) as Steele&#x27;s former mentor; and &quot;Vintage Steele&quot;, a fan favorite that focused on Laura&#x27;s past. Additionally, writer Joel Steiger won an Edgar Award from the Mystery Writers of America for his script for the first-season episode &quot;In The Steele of the Night&quot;. &quot;Remington Steele&quot; also received strong critical reviews in the first season, noting its intelligence and stylish sophistication.

===Season 2===
At the end of season one, James Read made Michael Gleason aware that he was unhappy with the direction of his character. Gleason released him from the series and also let Janet DeMay go, thinking that the detective/investigator and secretary characters could be combined into one character. Gleason originally wrote the replacement character, Mildred Krebs, as an attractive 35-year-old woman who was a rival for Steele&#x27;s affections. Doris Roberts, an established character actress who had recently won an Emmy for a guest role on &quot;St. Elsewhere&quot;, asked to read for the part. Although Roberts was not the right age for the character Gleason originally conceived, she won him over with her audition. Gleason then changed the character of Mildred Krebs to reflect the casting (her first appearance in the first episode of the second season was as an IRS inspector investigating Steele&#x27;s taxes). The character, being new to the agency, did not know that Remington Steele was an imposter, and treated Steele as the company head.

NBC moved the series from Friday to Tuesday nights at 9pm following &quot;The A-Team&quot;, increasing its budget and prominence on the network schedule. The second season continued the slow evolution of the relationship between Laura and Steele as he became a more competent detective. Key episodes include the two-hour season premiere, &quot;Steele Away With Me&quot;, filmed on location in Mexico; &quot;Red Holt Steele&quot;, a fan-favorite dramatic episode in which Laura&#x27;s house is destroyed in an explosion; and &quot;Love Among the Steele&quot;, another fan-favorite episode in which the agency acquires a 1936 Auburn Boattail Speedster, which was used symbolically in several subsequent episodes.

===Season 3===
&quot;Remington Steele&quot; achieved its greatest ratings success in the third season, finishing the year in the top 25. Key third-season episodes included the premiere, &quot;Steele At It&quot;, shot on location in Cannes; &quot;Steele Your Heart Away&quot;, shot on location in Ireland; and &quot;Maltese Steele&quot;, shot on location in Malta. The season also included &quot;Steele Trying&quot;, set in San Francisco and featuring the songs of Tony Bennett, and &quot;Diced Steele&quot;, filmed on location in Las Vegas. &quot;Puzzled Steele&quot; earned Doris Roberts an Emmy nomination for best supporting actress. The third season also included an episode, &quot;Steele in the Chips&quot;, co-written by Stephanie Zimbalist and writing partner Robin Bernheim. The final episode of the season ended with a cliffhanger as Laura and Steele seemed to be going their separate ways. Michael Gleason explained to the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, &quot;We want to pull the relationship apart and bring it back together again with a little bit different attitude.&quot;

===Season 4===
Season four was the final full season of the series. In the two-part season opener, &quot;Steele Searching&quot;, filmed on location in London, Mildred Krebs learned of Steele&#x27;s secret, changing the dynamics of the trio. Other key episodes, including &quot;Forged Steele&quot;, &quot;Steele in the Spotlight&quot;, and &quot;Sensitive Steele&quot;, continued the slow evolution of the romantic relationship between the main characters. Facing a possible cancellation by NBC (whose fortunes had now changed to become the number-one network) Gleason contrived a phony marriage between the characters in the final episode of season four, &quot;Bonds of Steele&quot;, as an attempt to garner additional interest and provoke NBC to pick up the series for a fifth season.

===Proposals for season 5===
Gleason originally wanted the characters to have a real marriage at the end of season four and had plans for how to change the series in season five to accommodate the change, but both Brosnan and Zimbalist rejected the idea. Following that decision, Gleason pitched another concept for season five to NBC in May 1986, introducing a character named &quot;Tony&quot; as a rival for Laura&#x27;s affections.

====Brief cancellation====
The series was cancelled at the end of the 1985–86 television season, although it was still winning its timeslot most weeks. According to Michael Gleason, Brandon Tartikoff&#x27;s decision to give an early pick-up to the Stephen J. Cannell series &quot;Hunter&quot; left no room on the NBC schedule for &quot;Remington Steele&quot;. Two months after the cancellation, NBC executive Warren Littlefield reversed the decision, responding to an outpouring of support from fans and a sharp upswing in the show&#x27;s ratings during the summer of 1986.

The cancellation and reversal affected film role opportunities for Brosnan and Zimbalist, as both had received firm offers to do films in the interim. Albert R. Broccoli offered Brosnan the part of James Bond for the film &quot;The Living Daylights&quot;. Following NBC&#x27;s reversal, Broccoli stated he did not want Bond to be identified with a current TV series and instead gave the role to Timothy Dalton. Brosnan became 007 in 1995, making his debut in the film &quot;GoldenEye&quot;. Zimbalist had accepted the role of Officer Anne Lewis in the science-fiction movie &quot;RoboCop&quot;, but she was forced to pull out of that production, to be replaced by Nancy Allen.

====Final season====
NBC reversed the cancellation but did not slot a full 22-episode season into their schedule. The final abbreviated season consisted of six hours of made-for-TV films broadcast in early 1987, including installments filmed on location in Mexico, London, and Ireland. Jack Scalia joined the cast as a rival for Laura&#x27;s affections. The circumstances surrounding Steele&#x27;s birth as well as the identity of Steele&#x27;s father are revealed in the final episode. The final scene of the series implied that Steele and Laura were about to consummate their relationship.

===Rumors of discord===
Although part of the show&#x27;s appeal was the sexual tension between the main characters, in real life the production was dogged for years by rumors that its two leads did not get along. Brosnan and Zimbalist have admitted some level of personal conflict in press interviews during and since, attributing some of it to the stress of long working hours, while also maintaining that it did not damage their ability to work together. Doris Roberts confirmed that Zimbalist and Brosnan rarely spoke to each other and that such tension played a role in the series&#x27; end: &quot;It was awful. They didn&#x27;t talk to each other.&quot; Whatever discord there may have been at the time of production, Brosnan and Zimbalist speak fondly of one another in more recent interviews and are occasionally in touch. In an interview included on the DVD release of Season 1, Brosnan says they did get along and trusted one another professionally. Brosnan also praises Zimbalist&#x27;s acting on his official website, saying that he would work with her again on the right project. Zimbalist returned the compliment in a 2011 interview with the &quot;New Jersey Star-Ledger&quot;, saying &quot;Pierce Brosnan is a very sweet man. Oh, we had our issues, but a lot of it was hormones.&quot;

===Potential projects===
==== Film ====
With the release of the series on DVD in 2005, Pierce Brosnan expressed interest in developing a &quot;Remington Steele&quot; feature film through his production company, Irish Dream Time, but later stated on his web site that it is unlikely to be produced.

==== Television ====
In October 2013 NBC announced plans to reboot the series as a half-hour comedy. NBC&#x27;s deal with 20th Century Fox had screenwriters and a director attached but no cast was attached ; NBC presumably cancelled the project.

==Home media==
20th Century Fox has released all five seasons of &quot;Remington Steele&quot; on DVD in Region 1 in four box sets. The Season 1 DVD inadvertently echoed an ongoing joke in the series in that Stephanie Zimbalist, who had top billing when the show was on the air, was initially omitted from all promotional material connected with its release, as well as the DVD box itself, as Fox Video chose to promote Pierce Brosnan as the sole star. Subsequently, a sticker saying &quot;Also starring Stephanie Zimbalist&quot; was added to the packaging as an afterthought. This omission was corrected with the release of the second season which gave Zimbalist star billing with her photograph appearing on the box. Additionally, Zimbalist is featured on the behind-the-scenes featurettes contained therein. The first-season boxed set also has a picture of Doris Roberts on the back cover, even though she didn&#x27;t join the show until the second season.

Season 1 has also been released in Region 2 &amp; 4.

==Syndication==
After a nearly two-decade absence from local syndication, the series returned to broadcast television and was seen from September 3 to December 31, 2012, on MeTV and resumed in September 2013. It also aired on Family Net. Reruns have previously aired on A&amp;E from 1995 to 1997 and on PAX (now Ion Television) from 2000 to 2001. It also aired in India on Star Plus in early 1990s to March 31, 1993.

MeTV ran the series starting 29 May 2017 in place of &quot;&quot;, beginning with the season 2 premiere, &quot;Steele Away with Me&quot;. Decades Television ran the series as part of its weekend long Decades Binge Marathon the weekend of July 9 and 10 2022

In the United Kingdom, Freeview Channel 5USA, started showing the series from the first episode on October 30, 2017. In Germany, the series started on July 29, 1985, with the first episode in the first program and ended with the last episode on November 29, 1992, on ARD-TV.

MeTV+ began airing the series on 25 September 2023.

<doc id="361883" wikidata="Q1564478" url="?curid=361883" title="HMS Captain (1869)">
<text>HMS &quot;Captain&quot; was a major warship built for the Royal Navy as a semi-private venture, following a dispute between the designer and the Admiralty. With wrought-iron armour, steam propulsion, and the main battery mounted in rotating armoured turrets, the ship was, at first appearance, quite innovative and formidable. However, poor design and design changes resulted in a vessel that was overweight and ultimately unstable. In terms of seaworthiness she was reported as closely comparable to the higher freeboard turret-ship HMS &quot;Monarch&quot;, but her reduced freeboard added a sense of &quot;sluggishness&quot;. The &quot;Captain&quot; capsized in heavy seas, only five months after being commissioned, with the loss of nearly 500 lives.

==Background==
The history of the &quot;Captain&quot; can be traced back to the Crimean War and the experiences of British captain Cowper Phipps Coles in 1855. Coles and a group of British sailors constructed a raft with guns protected by a &quot;cupola&quot; and used the raft, named the &quot;Lady Nancy&quot;, to shell the Russian town of Taganrog on the Sea of Azov. The &quot;Lady Nancy&quot; &quot;proved a great success&quot;, and Coles patented his rotating turret after the war. Following Coles&#x27; patenting, the British Admiralty ordered a prototype of Coles&#x27; design in 1859, which was installed in the floating battery vessel, HMS &quot;Trusty&quot;, for trials in 1861.

The trials with the &quot;Trusty&quot; impressed the Admiralty, and it ordered a coastal defence vessel, HMS &quot;Prince Albert&quot;, to be built with four of Coles&#x27; turrets and a wooden 121-gun first rate ship-of-the-line under construction, HMS &quot;Royal Sovereign&quot;, to be converted to a turret ship. The &quot;Prince Albert&quot; was completed with four turrets mounting single 12-ton 9-inch guns and armour plate on the hull. The &quot;Royal Sovereign&quot; had five 10.5-inch, 12.5-ton guns in one twin and three single turrets.

Both ships were flush deck with only a jury rig, and could only operate as coastal service vessels. The Admiralty, although impressed with Coles&#x27; rotating turret, required oceangoing vessels to protect its worldwide empire. Unfortunately for Coles, engine technology had not yet caught up with his designs and consequently oceangoing ships required sails. Combining rigging, masts, and turrets proved complicated if rigging was not to impede the turrets&#x27; arcs of fire.

In early 1863 the Admiralty gave Coles permission to work with Nathaniel Barnaby, head of staff of the Department of Naval Construction, on the design of a rigged vessel with two turrets and three tripod masts. In June 1863 the Admiralty suspended progress on the vessel until the &quot;Royal Sovereign&quot; finished her trials.

In 1864, Coles was allowed to start a second project: a rigged vessel with only one turret and based on the design of HMS &quot;Pallas&quot;. He was lent the services of Joseph Scullard, Chief Draughtsman of Portsmouth Dockyard.

The next year, 1865, a committee established by the Admiralty to study the new design concluded that while the turret should be adopted, Coles&#x27; one-turret warship design had inadequate fire arcs. The committee proposed a two-turret fully rigged vessel with either two 9-inch &quot;(12 ton)&quot; guns per turret, or one 12-inch &quot;(22 ton)&quot; gun per turret. The committee&#x27;s proposal was accepted by the Admiralty, and construction was started on &quot;Monarch&quot;. &quot;Monarch&#x27;s&quot; two turrets were each equipped with two 12-inch &quot;(25-ton)&quot; guns.

Stunned by the committee&#x27;s decision to cancel his single-turret ship and his proposal for a two-turret vessel, and objecting to the &quot;Monarch&#x27;s&quot; design, Coles launched a strong campaign against the project, attacking Vice Admiral Robert Spencer Robinson, Controller of the Navy, and various other members of the committee and the Admiralty. So vociferously did Coles complain that in January 1866 his contract as a consultant to the Admiralty was terminated. At the end of January, his protestations that he had been misunderstood led to his being re-employed from 1 March 1866. Further, Coles lobbied the press and Parliament, who were increasingly convinced that foreign powers—namely the United States—were pressing ahead with turret ships and thereby leaving Britain at a disadvantage at sea. On 17 April 1866, Coles submitted to the Admiralty his critique of the proposed &quot;Monarch&quot; (designed by the Controller&#x27;s department and the Chief Constructor), stating that he could not publicly endorse a vessel which did not represent &quot;my views of a sea going Turret-ship, nor can she give my principle a satisfactory and conclusive trial.&quot; Sensing that such an increasingly acrimonious and high-profile debate would only continue, the First Naval Lord, Admiral Sir Frederick Grey, minuted four days later (21 April) that Coles should at last be allowed to build what he felt would be a &#x27;perfect&#x27; seagoing turret-ship.
==Design and construction==

On 8 May 1866, Coles informed the Admiralty of his selection of Laird Brothers&#x27; Cheshire yard, for the builder of the warship. The Cheshire yard had already built several successful iron warships. In mid-July, Lairds submitted two possible designs for Coles&#x27; proposed turret-ship. To prevent the rigging from being damaged when the guns fired through it, it was attached to a platform mounted above the gun turrets known as the hurricane deck instead of brought down to the main deck. Tripod masts were also used to minimise standing rigging.

The design called for the ship to have a low freeboard, and Coles&#x27; figures estimated it at . Both the Controller and the Chief Constructor Edward James Reed raised serious concerns. Robinson noted that the low freeboard could cause flooding issues on the gun deck, and Reed criticised the design in 1866 both for being too heavy and for having too high a centre of gravity. On the latter, Reed noted that it would cause issues &quot;especially as it is proposed to spread a large surface of canvas upon the &quot;Captain&quot;&quot;. As the design neared completion, the First Lord of the Admiralty, Sir John Pakington, wrote on 23 July 1866 to Coles approving the building of the ship, but noting that responsibility for failure would lie on Coles&#x27; and the builders&#x27; lap.

In November 1866, the contract for HMS &quot;Captain&quot; was approved, and the design was finished. She was laid down 30 January 1867 at Laird&#x27;s yard at Birkenhead, England, launched 27 March 1869 and completed in March 1870.

Insufficient supervision during the building, owing partly to Coles&#x27; protracted illness, meant that she was heavier than planned. The designed freeboard was just , and the additional weight forced her to float deeper than expected, bringing the freeboard down to just . This compares with for the two-turret &quot;Monarch&quot;. The centre of gravity of the vessel also rose by about ten inches during construction. Reed raised havoc over the problems with the freeboard and the centre of gravity, but his objections were over-ruled during the &quot;Captain&#x27;s&quot; trials.

She was commissioned on 30 April 1870 under Captain Hugh Talbot Burgoyne, VC. During trials in the following months, the &quot;Captain&quot; seemed to be everything that Coles had promised and won over many followers. In trials versus the &quot;Monarch&quot;, she performed well and returned to sea in July and August, travelling to Vigo, Spain, and Gibraltar in separate runs.

== Gunnery trials ==

A trial was undertaken in 1870 to compare the accuracy and rate of fire of turret-mounted heavy guns with those in a centre-battery ship. The target was a long, high rock off Vigo. The speed of the ships was (&quot;some accounts say stationary&quot;). Each ship fired for five minutes, with the guns starting &quot;loaded and very carefully trained&quot;. The guns fired Palliser shells with battering charges at a range of about . Three out of the &quot;Captain&#x27;s&quot; four hits were achieved with the first salvo; firing this salvo caused the ship to roll heavily (±20°); smoke from firing made aiming difficult. Note that the &quot;Captain&quot; could be expected to capsize if inclined 21°. The &quot;Monarch&quot; and the &quot;Hercules&quot; also did better with their first salvo, were inconvenienced by the smoke of firing, and to a lesser extent were caused to roll by firing. On the &quot;Hercules&quot; the gunsights were on the guns, and this worked better than the turret roof gunsights used by the other ships.

==Sinking==

On the afternoon of 6 September 1870 &quot;Captain&quot; was cruising with the combined Mediterranean and Channel Squadrons comprising 11 ships off Cape Finisterre. The ship made 9.5 knots under sail in a force six wind, which was increasing through the day. The commander in chief, Admiral Sir Alexander Milne, was on board to see her performance, and speed had risen to 11–13 knots before he departed. Not being accustomed to ships with such low freeboard, he was disturbed to note that at this speed with the strengthening sea, waves washed over the weather deck. The weather worsened with rain as the night progressed, and sail was reduced. The wind was blowing from the port bow so that sails had to be angled to the wind, speed was much reduced, and there was considerable force pushing the ship sideways. As the wind rose to a gale, sail was reduced to only the fore staysail and fore and main topsails.

Shortly after midnight when a new watch came on duty, the ship was heeling over 18 degrees and was felt to lurch to starboard twice. By then other ships in the combined squadron reported winds of Force 9 to 11 (on the Beaufort scale, 60 knots) with waves. Orders were given to drop the fore topsail and release sheets (ropes) holding both topsails angled into the wind. Before the captain&#x27;s order could be carried out, the roll increased, and she capsized and sank with the loss of around 472 lives, including Coles&#x27;. The First Lord of the Admiralty, Hugh Childers, and Under-Secretary of State for War, Thomas Baring, both lost sons in the disaster. Only 18 of the crew survived, by making it to a boat which had broken free.

== Court-martial ==

The subsequent investigation on the loss of &quot;Captain&quot;, in the form of a court-martial, under Admiral Sir James Hope, took place on board HMS &quot;Duke of Wellington&quot;, in Portsmouth Harbour. The court-martial expressed the opinion that &quot;the &quot;Captain&quot; was built in deference to public opinion expressed in Parliament and through other channels, and in opposition to views and opinions of the Controller and his Department&quot;. This was a stunning (and unprecedented) rebuke of the mid-Victorian British public. For years they had demanded that Coles be allowed to produce a super-ironclad—armed with turrets—which could restore confidence in the primacy of the Royal Navy in a way which neither broadside ironclads like the partially armoured HMS &quot;Warrior&quot; nor Reed&#x27;s central-battery versions seemed able to. Coles fatally added the requirement that a fully-rigged, seagoing turret-ship like HMS &quot;Monarch&quot; also be as low in the water as possible, like the low-freeboard (though mastless) American monitor USS &quot;Miantonomoh&quot;; which had crossed the Atlantic under escort in June 1866, and which both Coles and the Board of Admiralty toured when she was anchored at Spithead.

The Admiralty later appointed a committee to consider ship designs past and present. It was somewhat of a departure for the Admiralty to seek scientific advice, but eminent engineers William Thomson (later Lord Kelvin) and William John Macquorn Rankine were appointed to the committee. It concluded that the ship was insufficiently stable: at 14 degrees heel (when the edge of the deck touched the sea) the righting moment due to the buoyancy pushing the ship upright again was just 410-foot-tons (1.2 MN·m). HMS &quot;Monarch&quot;, the masted turret ship proposed by the 1865 committee and designed by Reed, and which was in the area at the time of the sinking, had a righting moment of 6,500-foot-tons (20 MN·m) at the same angle. Maximum righting moment occurred at a heel of 21 degrees, and thereafter declined to zero at 54.5 degrees. &quot;Monarch&#x27;s&quot; righting moment increased to a maximum at 40 degrees. Survivors testified that the &quot;Captain&quot; floated upside down for between three and ten minutes, which proved that the ship had capsized. An inclining test had been carried out at Portsmouth on 29 July 1870 to allow the ship&#x27;s stability characteristics to be calculated. &quot;Captain&quot; set sail on the ship&#x27;s final voyage before the results of the trial were published.

==Memorials==
There are memorials to the crew in St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral, Westminster Abbey, London, and St Anne&#x27;s church in Portsmouth.

The conclusion of the 1870 Court Martial is engraved on the Memorial to HMS &quot;Captain&quot;, in the north aisle of St Paul’s Cathedral:

:&quot;Before the&quot; Captain &quot;was received from her contractors a grave departure from her original design had been committed whereby her draught of water was increased about two feet and her freeboard was diminished to a corresponding extent, and that her stability proved to be dangerously small, combined with an area of sail, under those circumstances, excessive. The Court deeply regret that if these facts were duly known and appreciated, they were not communicated to the officer in command of the ship, or that, if otherwise, the ship was allowed to be employed in the ordinary service of the Fleet before they had been ascertained by calculation and experience.&quot;

== Hunt for the wreck of HMS &quot;Captain&quot; ==
In 2021 Dr. Howard Fuller, a Reader in War Studies at the University of Wolverhampton, initiated a Find the &quot;Captain&quot; project. This aims to raise funds in an effort to discover the wreck of the &quot;Captain&quot;, whose sinking was the worst disaster suffered by the Royal Navy in the &#x27;Pax Britannica&#x27; era. In company with a Galician-based documentary company, four wrecks were discovered by multibeam echosounder-scan off Cape Finisterre, Spain on 30 August 2022. The fourth wreck has a general configuration and dimensions closely corresponding with HMS &quot;Captain&quot;&#x27;s. Fuller and Sir Sherard Cowper-Coles, Captain Cowper Coles great-grandson, suggested that the chances of finding the wreck were good and that fund raising had reached the half-way mark by June 2023.

<text>Doris May Roberts ( Green; November 4, 1925 – April 17, 2016) was an American actress whose career spanned seven decades of television and film. She received five Emmy Awards and a Screen Actors Guild award during her acting career, which began in 1951.

Roberts studied acting at The Neighborhood Playhouse School of the Theatre in New York City and started in films in 1961. She had several prominent film roles, including playing opposite Shirley Stoler in &quot;The Honeymoon Killers&quot; (1970), Elliott Gould in &quot;Little Murders&quot; (1971), Steven Keats in &quot;Hester Street&quot; (1975), Billy Crystal in &quot;Rabbit Test&quot; (1978), Robert Carradine in &quot;Number One with a Bullet&quot; (1987), Cady McClain in &quot;Simple Justice&quot; (1989), among many others.

She achieved continuing success in television, becoming known for her role as Mildred Krebs in NBC&#x27;s &quot;Remington Steele&quot; from 1983 to 1987 and her co-starring role as Raymond Barone&#x27;s mother, Marie Barone, on the CBS sitcom &quot;Everybody Loves Raymond&quot; (1996–2005). Towards the end of her acting career, she also had a prominent role opposite Tyler Perry in &quot;Madea&#x27;s Witness Protection&quot; (2012).

She appeared as a guest on many talk and variety shows, as well as a panelist on several game shows. She was an advocate of animal rights and animal rights activism, supporting groups such as the United Activists for Animal Rights.

==Early life==
Doris May Green was born in St. Louis, Missouri, to a family of Russian-Jewish immigrants. She was raised by her mother, Ann (née Meltzer), and her maternal grandparents in The Bronx, New York, after her father, Larry Green, deserted the family. Roberts&#x27; stepfather, whose surname she took as her own, was Chester H. Roberts. Chester and Roberts&#x27; mother operated the Z. L. Rosenfield Agency, a stenographic service catering to playwrights and actors. By her teens, Roberts was renowned for her skill as a typist and would assist with the family business. Ruth Finley was one such client who recalls her typing up final copies of &quot;The Fashion Calendar&quot; for print.

==Career==

===Film and television===

Roberts&#x27; acting career began in 1951 with a role on the TV series &quot;Studio One&quot;. She appeared in episodes of &quot;The Naked City&quot; (1958-1963), &quot;Way Out&quot; (1961), &quot;Ben Casey&quot; (1963), and &quot;The Defenders&quot; (1962-1963). In 1961, she made her film debut in &quot;Something Wild&quot; (1961).

She appeared in such 1960s/1970s films as &quot;A Lovely Way to Die&quot;, &quot;No Way to Treat a Lady&quot;, &quot;The Honeymoon Killers&quot;, &quot;Such Good Friends&quot;, &quot;Little Murders&quot;, &quot;A New Leaf&quot;, &quot;The Heartbreak Kid&quot;, &quot;The Taking of Pelham One Two Three&quot;, &quot;Hester Street&quot;, and &quot;Rabbit Test&quot;. In 1978, she appeared in a film about John F. Kennedy&#x27;s assassination, &quot;Ruby and Oswald&quot;, in which she played Jack Ruby&#x27;s sister. She also appeared briefly in &quot;The Rose&quot;, as the mother of the title character (Bette Midler).
In an interview with the Archive of American Television, Rue McClanahan confirmed that in 1972 she was approached by Norman Lear during the taping of an &quot;All in the Family&quot; episode to be a late replacement for Roberts, who was originally intended for the role of Vivian on &quot;Maude&quot;. (Roberts later guest starred in a 1976 &quot;All in the Family&quot; episode, &quot;Edith&#x27;s Night Out&quot; as a bar patron who befriended Edith.) 

Roberts also appeared on &quot;Alice&quot;, playing the mother of the title character (played by her former Broadway co-star Linda Lavin); on &quot;Barney Miller&quot; in two different roles, as the wife of a man who secretly visits a sex surrogate, and (in three episodes) as the harried wife of a middle-aged man who occasionally makes erratic decisions to give his life meaning. She played the unhinged Flo Flotsky on four episodes of &quot;Soap&quot;, and Dorelda Doremus, a faith healer, on &quot;Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman&quot;. Roberts played Theresa Falco on &quot;Angie&quot;, and later appeared as Mildred Krebs on NBC&#x27;s &quot;Remington Steele&quot; from 1983-1987.

After &quot;Remington Steele&quot; ended, she starred in several films including the TV film remake of &quot;If It&#x27;s Tuesday, It Still Must Be Belgium&quot; (1987), &quot;Number One with a Bullet&quot; (1987), &quot;Simple Justice&quot; (1989), National Lampoon&#x27;s &quot;Christmas Vacation&quot; (1989), and &quot;Used People&quot; (1992). She also appeared on &quot;Full House&quot; as Danny Tanner&#x27;s mother, Claire, as well as two episodes of &quot;Murder, She Wrote&quot;, and as lonely Aunt Edna on &quot;Step by Step&quot; among others.
Roberts achieved much of her fame for her role as Marie Barone on &quot;Everybody Loves Raymond&quot;, which ran on CBS from 1996 to 2005. She was reportedly one of 100 actresses considered for the role. For her work on the series, she was nominated for seven Emmy Awards (and won four times) for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series. She had previously won an Emmy for a guest appearance on &quot;St. Elsewhere&quot;, playing a homeless woman, and was also once nominated for her role on &quot;Remington Steele&quot;. She was nominated for appearances on &quot;Perfect Strangers&quot; and a PBS special called &quot;The Sunset Gang&quot;. 

In 2003, she made a guest appearance as Gordo&#x27;s grandmother in &quot;Lizzie McGuire&quot;. The same year, she received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. In 2006, she starred in &quot;Our House&quot; as a wealthy woman who took in homeless people into her own house, and in &quot;Grandma&#x27;s Boy&quot;.

In 2007, she made a guest appearance on &quot;Law &amp; Order: Criminal Intent&quot;. In 2008, she appeared in the romantic comedy &quot;Play the Game&quot; alongside Andy Griffith, who plays a lonely widowed grandfather re-entering the dating world after a 60-year hiatus. Roberts appeared in the 2009 film &quot;Aliens in the Attic&quot;, which was filmed in Auckland, New Zealand. She starred as Emily Merkle (Mrs. Miracle) in the Hallmark television film &quot;Mrs. Miracle&quot; (2009) and its sequel, &quot;Call Me Mrs. Miracle&quot; (2010). She played George Needleman&#x27;s mother in Tyler Perry&#x27;s &quot;Madea&#x27;s Witness Protection&quot; (2012).

On September 23, 2010, she played Ms. Rinsky, Brick Heck&#x27;s teacher in the second-season premiere episode of &quot;The Middle&quot;. This appearance reunited her with Patricia Heaton, her co-star from &quot;Everybody Loves Raymond&quot;. The two women&#x27;s characters, of course, clash, with Heaton&#x27;s Frankie Heck always managing to get pushed out of sorts into disastrous action usually resulting in some kind of public chastisement by Roberts&#x27; Rinsky, an expert at passive-aggressive manipulation. Roberts returned in two other episodes that season, &quot;The Math Class&quot; and the finale, &quot;Back to Summer&quot;. In 2013 she was a special guest star in the &quot;Major Crimes&quot; episode &quot;There’s No Place Like Home&quot;.

===Stage===
Roberts&#x27; stage career began in the 1950s on Broadway. She appeared in numerous Broadway shows including William Saroyan&#x27;s &quot;The Time of Your Life&quot;, William Marchant&#x27;s &quot;The Desk Set&quot; (with Shirley Booth), Neil Simon&#x27;s &quot;The Last of the Red Hot Lovers&quot; (with James Coco and Linda Lavin) and Terrence McNally&#x27;s &quot;Bad Habits&quot;. She starred in McNally&#x27;s &quot;Unusual Acts of Devotion&quot; at the LaJolla Playhouse in June 2009.

==Honors==
In May 2005, Roberts received an honorary doctorate of fine arts from the University of South Carolina. She was awarded the Ellis Island Medal of Honor on May 7, 2011. She was awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in February 2003, at 7021 Hollywood Blvd.

==Advocacy and other work==
On September 4, 2002, Roberts testified before a U.S. Congressional panel that age discrimination was prevalent in Hollywood. She was a registered Democrat.

An animal rights advocate, Roberts worked with the group Puppies Behind Bars, which works with inmates in training guide dogs and assistance dogs for the physically disabled and elderly, as well as dogs trained in explosives detection to be used by law enforcement agencies. She was also active with the Children with AIDS Foundation, where she served as chairwoman.

With Danelle Morton, Roberts wrote &quot;Are You Hungry, Dear? Life, Laughs, and Lasagna&quot;. The book was published by St. Martin&#x27;s Press in 2003, and serves as a memoir as well as a collection of some of Roberts&#x27; recipes.

==Personal life==
Roberts married Michael Cannata in 1956; they divorced in 1962. They had one son. She had three grandchildren. Her second husband was writer William Goyen and they were married from 1963 until his death from leukemia in 1983.

==Death==
Roberts died in her sleep on April 17, 2016, at her home in Los Angeles following a stroke, at the age of 90. She had also suffered from pulmonary hypertension for many years before her death. Just a month after her death she was memorialized in New York City, where a public tribute was held at the Ambassador Theatre, where she appeared in 1972 in &quot;The Secret Affairs of Mildred Wild&quot; with Maureen Stapleton. Among the stars attending the service were Ray Romano and Patricia Heaton (her co-stars from &quot;Everybody Loves Raymond&quot;) and actor David Hyde Pierce. Romano said of Roberts: 

In another interview Romano jokingly referred to the kissing thing that Roberts would do off-camera: &quot;You know how great she was then!&quot; He also added: &quot;We had a little get together for her. She was one of a kind. She can outwork it, outdrink it, good kisser, I was joking! I appreciated her.&quot; Just a month after her death, he said: She was interred at Pierce Brothers Westwood Village Memorial Park and Mortuary in Los Angeles, California.

<text>Astrophysics is a science that employs the methods and principles of physics and chemistry in the study of astronomical objects and phenomena. As one of the founders of the discipline, James Keeler, said, astrophysics &quot;seeks to ascertain the nature of the heavenly bodies, rather than their positions or motions in space—&quot;what&quot; they are, rather than &quot;where&quot; they are&quot;, which is studied in celestial mechanics.

Among the subjects studied are the Sun (solar physics), other stars, galaxies, extrasolar planets, the interstellar medium, and the cosmic microwave background. Emissions from these objects are examined across all parts of the electromagnetic spectrum, and the properties examined include luminosity, density, temperature, and chemical composition. Because astrophysics is a very broad subject, &quot;astrophysicists&quot; apply concepts and methods from many disciplines of physics, including classical mechanics, electromagnetism, statistical mechanics, thermodynamics, quantum mechanics, relativity, nuclear and particle physics, and atomic and molecular physics.

In practice, modern astronomical research often involves substantial work in the realms of theoretical and observational physics. Some areas of study for astrophysicists include the properties of dark matter, dark energy, black holes, and other celestial bodies; and the origin and ultimate fate of the universe. Topics also studied by theoretical astrophysicists include Solar System formation and evolution; stellar dynamics and evolution; galaxy formation and evolution; magnetohydrodynamics; large-scale structure of matter in the universe; origin of cosmic rays; general relativity, special relativity, and quantum and physical cosmology (the physical study of the largest-scale structures of the universe), including string cosmology and astroparticle physics.

==History==
Astronomy is an ancient science, long separated from the study of terrestrial physics. In the Aristotelian worldview, bodies in the sky appeared to be unchanging spheres whose only motion was uniform motion in a circle, while the earthly world was the realm which underwent growth and decay and in which natural motion was in a straight line and ended when the moving object reached its goal. Consequently, it was held that the celestial region was made of a fundamentally different kind of matter from that found in the terrestrial sphere; either Fire as maintained by Plato, or Aether as maintained by Aristotle.
During the 17th century, natural philosophers such as Galileo, Descartes, and Newton began to maintain that the celestial and terrestrial regions were made of similar kinds of material and were subject to the same natural laws. Their challenge was that the tools had not yet been invented with which to prove these assertions.

For much of the nineteenth century, astronomical research was focused on the routine work of measuring the positions and computing the motions of astronomical objects. A new astronomy, soon to be called astrophysics, began to emerge when William Hyde Wollaston and Joseph von Fraunhofer independently discovered that, when decomposing the light from the Sun, a multitude of dark lines (regions where there was less or no light) were observed in the spectrum. By 1860 the physicist, Gustav Kirchhoff, and the chemist, Robert Bunsen, had demonstrated that the dark lines in the solar spectrum corresponded to bright lines in the spectra of known gases, specific lines corresponding to unique chemical elements. Kirchhoff deduced that the dark lines in the solar spectrum are caused by absorption by chemical elements in the Solar atmosphere. In this way it was proved that the chemical elements found in the Sun and stars were also found on Earth.

Among those who extended the study of solar and stellar spectra was Norman Lockyer, who in 1868 detected radiant, as well as dark lines in solar spectra. Working with chemist Edward Frankland to investigate the spectra of elements at various temperatures and pressures, he could not associate a yellow line in the solar spectrum with any known elements. He thus claimed the line represented a new element, which was called helium, after the Greek Helios, the Sun personified.

In 1885, Edward C. Pickering undertook an ambitious program of stellar spectral classification at Harvard College Observatory, in which a team of woman computers, notably Williamina Fleming, Antonia Maury, and Annie Jump Cannon, classified the spectra recorded on photographic plates. By 1890, a catalog of over 10,000 stars had been prepared that grouped them into thirteen spectral types. Following Pickering&#x27;s vision, by 1924 Cannon expanded the catalog to nine volumes and over a quarter of a million stars, developing the Harvard Classification Scheme which was accepted for worldwide use in 1922.

In 1895, George Ellery Hale and James E. Keeler, along with a group of ten associate editors from Europe and the United States, established &quot;The Astrophysical Journal: An International Review of Spectroscopy and Astronomical Physics&quot;. It was intended that the journal would fill the gap between journals in astronomy and physics, providing a venue for publication of articles on astronomical applications of the spectroscope; on laboratory research closely allied to astronomical physics, including wavelength determinations of metallic and gaseous spectra and experiments on radiation and absorption; on theories of the Sun, Moon, planets, comets, meteors, and nebulae; and on instrumentation for telescopes and laboratories.

Around 1920, following the discovery of the Hertzsprung–Russell diagram still used as the basis for classifying stars and their evolution, Arthur Eddington anticipated the discovery and mechanism of nuclear fusion processes in stars, in his paper &quot;The Internal Constitution of the Stars&quot;. At that time, the source of stellar energy was a complete mystery; Eddington correctly speculated that the source was fusion of hydrogen into helium, liberating enormous energy according to Einstein&#x27;s equation &quot;E = mc2&quot;. This was a particularly remarkable development since at that time fusion and thermonuclear energy, and even that stars are largely composed of hydrogen (see metallicity), had not yet been discovered.

In 1925 Cecilia Helena Payne (later Cecilia Payne-Gaposchkin) wrote an influential doctoral dissertation at Radcliffe College, in which she applied Saha&#x27;s ionization theory to stellar atmospheres to relate the spectral classes to the temperature of stars. Most significantly, she discovered that hydrogen and helium were the principal components of stars, not the composition of Earth. Despite Eddington&#x27;s suggestion, discovery was so unexpected that her dissertation readers (including Russell) convinced her to modify the conclusion before publication. However, later research confirmed her discovery.

By the end of the 20th century, studies of astronomical spectra had expanded to cover wavelengths extending from radio waves through optical, x-ray, and gamma wavelengths. In the 21st century, it further expanded to include observations based on gravitational waves.

==Observational astrophysics==

Observational astronomy is a division of the astronomical science that is concerned with recording and interpreting data, in contrast with theoretical astrophysics, which is mainly concerned with finding out the measurable implications of physical models. It is the practice of observing celestial objects by using telescopes and other astronomical apparatus.

Most astrophysical observations are made using the electromagnetic spectrum.
* Radio astronomy studies radiation with a wavelength greater than a few millimeters. Example areas of study are radio waves, usually emitted by cold objects such as interstellar gas and dust clouds; the cosmic microwave background radiation which is the redshifted light from the Big Bang; pulsars, which were first detected at microwave frequencies. The study of these waves requires very large radio telescopes.
* Infrared astronomy studies radiation with a wavelength that is too long to be visible to the naked eye but is shorter than radio waves. Infrared observations are usually made with telescopes similar to the familiar optical telescopes. Objects colder than stars (such as planets) are normally studied at infrared frequencies.
* Optical astronomy was the earliest kind of astronomy. Telescopes paired with a charge-coupled device or spectroscopes are the most common instruments used. The Earth&#x27;s atmosphere interferes somewhat with optical observations, so adaptive optics and space telescopes are used to obtain the highest possible image quality. In this wavelength range, stars are highly visible, and many chemical spectra can be observed to study the chemical composition of stars, galaxies, and nebulae.
* Ultraviolet, X-ray and gamma ray astronomy study very energetic processes such as binary pulsars, black holes, magnetars, and many others. These kinds of radiation do not penetrate the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere well. There are two methods in use to observe this part of the electromagnetic spectrum—space-based telescopes and ground-based imaging air Cherenkov telescopes (IACT). Examples of Observatories of the first type are RXTE, the Chandra X-ray Observatory and the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory. Examples of IACTs are the High Energy Stereoscopic System (H.E.S.S.) and the MAGIC telescope.
Other than electromagnetic radiation, few things may be observed from the Earth that originate from great distances. A few gravitational wave observatories have been constructed, but gravitational waves are extremely difficult to detect. Neutrino observatories have also been built, primarily to study the Sun. Cosmic rays consisting of very high-energy particles can be observed hitting the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere.

Observations can also vary in their time scale. Most optical observations take minutes to hours, so phenomena that change faster than this cannot readily be observed. However, historical data on some objects is available, spanning centuries or millennia. On the other hand, radio observations may look at events on a millisecond timescale (millisecond pulsars) or combine years of data (pulsar deceleration studies). The information obtained from these different timescales is very different.

The study of the Sun has a special place in observational astrophysics. Due to the tremendous distance of all other stars, the Sun can be observed in a kind of detail unparalleled by any other star. Understanding the Sun serves as a guide to understanding of other stars.

The topic of how stars change, or stellar evolution, is often modeled by placing the varieties of star types in their respective positions on the Hertzsprung–Russell diagram, which can be viewed as representing the state of a stellar object, from birth to destruction.

==Theoretical astrophysics==

Theoretical astrophysicists use a wide variety of tools which include analytical models (for example, polytropes to approximate the behaviors of a star) and computational numerical simulations. Each has some advantages. Analytical models of a process are generally better for giving insight into the heart of what is going on. Numerical models can reveal the existence of phenomena and effects that would otherwise not be seen.

Theorists in astrophysics endeavor to create theoretical models and figure out the observational consequences of those models. This helps allow observers to look for data that can refute a model or help in choosing between several alternate or conflicting models.

Theorists also try to generate or modify models to take into account new data. In the case of an inconsistency, the general tendency is to try to make minimal modifications to the model to fit the data. In some cases, a large amount of inconsistent data over time may lead to total abandonment of a model.

Topics studied by theoretical astrophysicists include stellar dynamics and evolution; galaxy formation and evolution; magnetohydrodynamics; large-scale structure of matter in the universe; origin of cosmic rays; general relativity and physical cosmology, including string cosmology and astroparticle physics. Relativistic astrophysics serves as a tool to gauge the properties of large-scale structures for which gravitation plays a significant role in physical phenomena investigated and as the basis for black hole (&quot;astro&quot;)physics and the study of gravitational waves.

Some widely accepted and studied theories and models in astrophysics, now included in the Lambda-CDM model, are the Big Bang, cosmic inflation, dark matter, dark energy and fundamental theories of physics.

== Popularization ==
The roots of astrophysics can be found in the seventeenth century emergence of a unified physics, in which the same laws applied to the celestial and terrestrial realms. There were scientists who were qualified in both physics and astronomy who laid the firm foundation for the current science of astrophysics. In modern times, students continue to be drawn to astrophysics due to its popularization by the Royal Astronomical Society and notable educators such as prominent professors Lawrence Krauss, Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar, Stephen Hawking, Hubert Reeves, Carl Sagan and Patrick Moore. The efforts of the early, late, and present scientists continue to attract young people to study the history and science of astrophysics.
The television sitcom show &quot;The Big Bang Theory&quot; popularized the field of astrophysics with the general public, and featured some well known scientists like Stephen Hawking and Neil deGrasse Tyson.

<doc id="361904" wikidata="Q1197272" url="?curid=361904" title="Flash suppressor">
<text>A flash suppressor, also known as a flash guard, flash eliminator, flash hider, or flash cone, is a device attached to the muzzle of a rifle that reduces its visible signature while firing by cooling or dispersing the burning gases that exit the muzzle, a phenomenon typical of carbine-length weapons. Its primary intent is to reduce the chances that the shooter will be blinded in low-light shooting conditions. Contrary to popular belief, it is only a minor secondary benefit if a flash suppressor reduces the intensity of the flash visible to the enemy.

A flash suppressor is different from a muzzle brake, although they are typically mounted in the same position and sometimes confused with each other. While the former is intended to reduce visible flash, a muzzle brake is designed to reduce recoil inherent to large cartridges and typically does not reduce visible flash.

==Rationale==
Pre-20th century rifle designs tended to have longer barrels than modern rifles. A beneficial side effect of the long barrel is that the propellant is completely burned before the bullet leaves the barrel, usually resulting only in a puff of smoke from the muzzle. However, if the same weapon&#x27;s barrel is &quot;cut down&quot; (shortened), as is common in cavalry and jungle-combat adapted versions, the bullet would often leave the barrel before the powder was completely consumed, resulting in a bright flash from the muzzle.

When barrel lengths were dramatically decreased with the introduction of various shorter-barreled rifles and carbines, the flash became a serious problem during night-time combat, as the flash would impair the shooter&#x27;s night vision and would also make the shooter&#x27;s position more apparent. Originally limited to &quot;special purpose&quot; roles, it was now expected that all infantry weapons with shorter barrels would experience this problem, and thereby be of limited use in low-light situations. Flash suppressors became common on late-World War II and later assault rifle designs, and are almost universal on these weapons today. Some designs such as those found on the AKS-74U serve a dual-role as a gas expansion chamber helping the shortened weapon&#x27;s gas system function properly.

Military flash suppressors are designed to reduce the muzzle flash from the weapon to preserve the shooter&#x27;s night vision, usually by diverting the incandescent gases to the sides, away from the line of sight of the shooter, and to secondarily reduce the flash visible to the enemy. Military forces engaging in night combat are still visible when firing, especially with night vision gear, and must move quickly after firing to avoid receiving return fire.

Limiting the amount of powder to what the length of a barrel can burn is one possible solution, but differences between individual cartridges mean that some cartridges will always have too much powder to be completely consumed, and the reduced powder load produces a lower projectile velocity. Muzzle flash can be controlled by using cartridges with a faster-burning propellant, so that the propellant gases will already have begun to cool by the time they exit the barrel, reducing flash intensities. Faster-burning powders, however, produce less projectile velocity, which reduces the accuracy, due to introducing a more parabolic bullet flight path in place of a &quot;flat&quot; trajectory, while also reducing the lethality of the weapon by reducing the distance of the projectile&#x27;s penetration of the target.

Flash suppressors reduce, or in some cases eliminate, the flash by rapidly cooling the gases as they leave the end of the barrel. Although the overall amount of burning propellant is unchanged, the density and temperature are greatly reduced, as is the brightness of the flash.

==Types==
A number of different flash suppressing designs have been used over the years. The simplest is a cone placed on the end of the barrel, which was used on the late-World War II jungle-combat versions of the Lee–Enfield, the rifle No. 5 Mk I variant, intended for use in the Pacific (the jungles of Malaya). More modern solutions tend to use a &quot;basket&quot; with several slits or holes cut in it, as seen on the M16 and other small-bore weapons. Cone-shaped flash eliminators are also evident on the ZB vzor 26 machine gun, and on the turret-mounted aircraft machine guns of British WWII heavy bombers, which were used mostly at night.

Duckbill flash suppressors have upper and lower &quot;prongs&quot; and direct gases to the sides. Early M60 machine guns and some Armalite AR-10, Armalite AR-15 and early M16 models featured this type of flash suppressor. One disadvantage is that the prongs can become entangled with vines or other natural vegetation and objects in the field.

&quot;Birdcage type&quot; flash suppressors still have prongs, but feature a ring on the front to prevent vegetation entanglement between the prongs. The closed bottom port of the M16A2 design makes the device function as a compensator. Both designs require indexing with a crush washer which increases flash signature.

The Vortex Flash Hider is a design developed in 1984, with a patent secured in 1995. The Vortex is somewhat reminiscent of the original &quot;three-prong flash hider&quot; found on the original Vietnam-era M16. However, the Vortex is more robust and makes use of four solid tines, which are equally spaced and angled 6° from a centerline, while the slots of the body incorporate a 5-, 10-, and 15-degree twisted helix design, which eliminates up to 99% of visible muzzle flash by having the flash break up at multiple locations and angles.

The Noveske Rifleworks KX-3 is a flash suppressor intended for use on shorter barreled rifles and aids in reliability. The back pressure generated through this type of flash suppressor helps to cycle the rifle. Noveske patterned this design on the muzzle brake found on the Soviet AKS-74U carbine, where it was explicitly used for this purpose. Essentially it is the cone-shaped suppressor of the AKS-74U within a chamber. Some other examples of cone-shaped hiders are found on the Bren machine gun, the .303 rifle No 5 Mk 1 &quot;jungle carbine&quot; and some models of the RPK and German MG3.

The XM177 Commando variant of the M16 rifle used a unique flash suppressor sometimes called a flash or sound moderator for its 10-inch barrel. This device is 4.2 inches long and was designed primarily as a counterbalance measure, as the shorter barrel made the weapon unwieldy. This device reduced flash signature greatly and sound signature slightly, making the normally louder short barreled rifle sound like a longer barreled M16A1. Unlike conventional suppressors, the XM177&#x27;s moderator has no internal baffles and does not reduce the weapon&#x27;s sound signature to subsonic levels; despite this, because it alters the sound level of the weapon, the United States Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives has declared these moderators to be suppressors and regulates their civilian purchase in the United States.

There are also devices referred to as hybrids that function as both flash suppressors and muzzle rise/recoil compensators, such as the White Sound Defense FOSSA-556. The U.S. military A2 muzzle device is technically a hybrid device: it has vents that are biased upwardly to reduce muzzle rise.

== Legality ==

===New Zealand===
Flash suppressors are seen as a &quot;military&quot; feature, and semi-automatic long guns with flash suppressors were defined as Military-Style Semi-Automatics in 1992, requiring a permit. Such weapons have since been prohibited.

===United States===
Flash suppressors were seen as &quot;military&quot; features and were on the list of federally defined features that could cause a rifle to be defined as illegal if the lower receiver was manufactured after the effective date of the Federal Assault Weapons Ban that went into effect in 1994 in the United States. This ban expired in 2004, although some states, such as California, Massachusetts, Maryland, New York, and New Jersey, have similar bans in place restricting the use of flash suppressors.

===Germany and Australia===
Flash suppressors and muzzle brakes can be legally acquired and used on all types of firearms, unless they are designed to significantly or predominantly reduce the sound.

<text>Hersonissos (, meaning “peninsula”, &quot;Chersónisos&quot;, ), also transliterated as &quot;Chersonissos&quot; and &quot;Hersónisos&quot;, is a town and a local government unit in the north of Crete, bordering the Mediterranean / Aegean Sea. The town is about 25 kilometers east of Heraklion and west of Agios Nikolaos. What is usually called Hersonissos is in fact its peninsula and harbour. It is part of the Heraklion regional unit. It is situated 25 km from the Heraklion airport and 27 km from the Heraklion port. The seat of the local government unit is the village of Gournes.

== Geography ==
The seaside resort of Hersonissos is officially the Port of Hersonissos (, &quot;Liménas Chersónissou&quot;) in distinction to the village of Upper Hersonissos (, &quot;Ano Chersónissos&quot;) further inland. Through tourism, the port town developed from the small harbour which served the original village, now known as Old Hersonissos.

== History ==
The ancient town of Chersonasus was important enough in the Roman province of Creta et Cyrenaica early to become a Christian bishopric, a suffragan of the metropolitan see of Gortyna.

The names of some of its bishops appear in extant documents: Anderius took part in the Council of Ephesus in 431; Longinus in the Robber Council of 449; Euphratas was a signatory of the letter sent by the bishops of the province to the emperor Leo I the Thracian in 458 after the killing of Proterius of Alexandria; Sisinnius was at the Trullan Council in 692; and another Sisinnius at the Second Council of Nicaea in 787.

== Latin bishopric ==
After the Venetian conquest of Crete in 1212, the existing dioceses, such as Chersonesus, were administered by Latin Church bishops.

The line of residential Latin bishops of Chersonesus ended with the conquest of Crete by the Ottomans in 1669.

=== Titular see ===
No longer a residential bishopric, Chersonnesus in Creta is today listed by the Catholic Church as a titular bishopric, as such nominally restored in 1787 under the name ‘Chersonesus’, changed in 1933 to Chersonesus in Creta, avoiding confusing with other Latin sees called Chersonesus.

It is vacant, having had the following incumbents, all of the lowest (episcopal) rank:
* Karel Otčenášek (1950.03.30 – 1989.12.21) (later Archbishop)*
* Titular Bishop: Bishop Antonio Cardona Riera (later Archbishop) (1928.03.10 – 1950.02.02)
* Titular Bishop: Bishop Rafael Balanzá y Navarro (1923.08.13 – 1928.03.02)
* Titular Bishop: Bishop Marc Chatagnon (沙), M.E.P. (1887.01.25 – 1920.11.26)
* Titular Bishop: Bishop Johann Theodor Laurent (1839.09.17 – 1884.02.20)

== Municipality of Hersonissos ==
The municipality of Hersonissos was formed at the 2011 local government reform by the merger of the following 4 former municipalities, that became municipal units. These were Episkopi, Gouves, Hersonissos and Malia.

The municipality has an area of , the municipal unit .

== Ancient remains ==

At the modern settlement of Hersonissos is the site of the ancient town of &quot;Chersonesos&quot;, an important seaport from Classical Greece through Byzantine times that served the city of Lyttos. The contemporaneous pleasure port is built over the remains of the Roman port. Some traces of those remains, most of them submerged, are still visible in some places. On the seaside street there is a pyramidal Roman fountain with mosaics of fishing scenes. On the top of the rocky hill behind the port stand the ruins of an early Christian basilica with floor mosaics.

The vicinity of Hersonissos is noted for its prehistoric archaeological finds. On the coast approximately one kilometer to the east of Hersonissos was an ancient temple dedicated to the goddess Britomartis.

William Smith’s Dictionary of Greek and Roman Geography states:
The episcopal see associated with this town is now a titular see (“Chersonesus in Creta”) of the Catholic Church.

== Tourism ==
Hersonissos is a resort area in Crete, which also hosts the only golf club on the island. Tourist sites include; the Hersonissos Aquarium, Labyrinth Theme Park, and the Dinosauria Park in Gournes. There are several beaches in Hersonissos, some with blue flag status. These include Potamos (blue flag) Karteros, Tobruk, Arina (municipal beach), Vathianos Kampos, Kokkini Hani, Gournes, Gouves, Apolselemis, Analipsi, Anissara (blue flag), Sarantaris (municipal beach), Hersonissos, Stalida, Klotsani, Malia and Potamos (municipal beach and blue flag).

<doc id="361909" wikidata="Q4130071" url="?curid=361909" title="Computer lab">
<text>A computer lab is a space where computer services are provided to a defined community. These are typically public libraries and academic institutions. Generally, users must follow a certain user policy to retain access to the computers. This usually consists of rules such as no illegal activity during use or attempts to circumvent any security or content-control software while using the computers. 

Computer labs are often subject to time limits in order to allow more people access to use the lab. It is also common for personal login credentials to be required for access. This allows institutions to track the user&#x27;s activities for any possible fraudulent use. The computers in computer labs are typically equipped with Internet access, scanners, and printers and are typically arranged in rows. This is to give the workstation a similar view to facilitate lecturing or presentations, and also to facilitate small group work. 

For some academic institutions, student laptops or laptop carts take place of dedicated computer labs. However, computer labs still have a place in applications requiring special software or hardware which are not easily accessible in personal computers.

==Purposes==

While computer labs are generally multipurpose, some labs may contain computers with hardware or software optimized for certain tasks or processes, depending on the needs of the institution operating the lab. These specialized purposes may include video editing, stock trading, 3-D computer-aided design, programming, and GIS. Increasingly, these have become the main purposes for the existence of traditional desktop-style computer labs, due to rising ownership of inexpensive personal computers making use of the lab only necessary when the expensive, specialized software and more powerful computers needed to run it are required.

==Arrangements==

==Alternatives==

In some settings, traditional desktop computer labs are impractical due to the requirement of a dedicated space. Because of this, some labs use laptop carts instead of desktop setups, in order to both save space and give the lab some degree of mobility.
In the context of academic institutions, some traditional desktop computer labs are being phased out in favor of other solutions judged to be more efficient given that most students own personal laptops. One of these solutions is a virtual lab, which can allow users to install software from the lab server onto their own laptops or log into virtual machines remotely, essentially turning their own laptops into lab machines.

==Academic software bundles==

Many universities purchase and maintain discounted academic software bundles and software suites, or free open-source software for their computer labs, such as programming text editors, programming languages, CAx software, rendering engines, Adobe Creative Cloud, Microsoft Office Suite, productivity software, statistical software, music software, video editing software, 3D animation software, and photo editing software.

==Similar spaces==

===Media lab===

A media lab (often referred to as &quot;new media lab&quot; or &quot;media research lab&quot;) is a term used for interdisciplinary organizations, collectives or spaces with the main focus on new media, digital culture and technology. The MIT Media Lab is a well-known example of a media lab.

===Internet café===

An Internet café is essentially a public-facing computer lab that anyone can use but which charge a fee (often hourly) to use their computers. The term &#x27;Internet café&#x27; may be used interchangeably with &#x27;computer lab&#x27; but may differ from a computer lab in that users can also connect to the Internet using their own device, and users of a computer lab generally do not need any equipment of their own. Moreover, in typical parlance, a computer lab is a location within a larger organization (such as a university), while an Internet café is a standalone business.

<doc id="361913" wikidata="Q5148351" url="?curid=361913" title="Colonial National Historical Park">
<text>Colonial National Historical Park is a large national historical park located in the Hampton Roads region of Virginia operated by the National Park Service. It protects and interprets several sites relating to the Colony of Virginia and the history of the United States more broadly. These range from the site of the first English settlement at Jamestown, to the battlefields of Yorktown where the British Army was defeated in the American Revolutionary War. Over 3 million people visit the park each year.

==Units==

===Colonial Parkway===
The park includes the Colonial Parkway, a scenic parkway linking the three points of Virginia&#x27;s Historic Triangle: Jamestown and Yorktown and running through the historic district of Colonial Williamsburg. The Colonial Parkway is located in James City County, York County, and the city of Williamsburg.

===Jamestown===

The park includes the original site of Jamestown, known in modern times as Historic Jamestowne in James City County at the southern end of the Colonial Parkway. It encompasses the area of Jamestown Island, including the Jamestown Glasshouse. Adjacent to it is the Commonwealth of Virginia&#x27;s complementary attraction known as Jamestown Settlement.

===Yorktown Battlefield===
The park operates the Yorktown Battlefield at the eastern end of the Colonial Parkway in York County at Yorktown. The Thomas Nelson House was built around 1724 and served as Cornwallis&#x27;s headquarters during the final battle of the Revolutionary War.

The battlefield was the site of the British defeat. Both the house and the historic siege earthworks were restored in 1976. The Moore House is where surrender negotiations took place in 1781, located in the eastern part of the park.

Nearby are the state-operated American Revolution Museum at Yorktown and the Yorktown Riverwalk Landing area.

===Green Spring Plantation===
William Berkeley held the colonial governorship during the longest periods of any individual. He used his Green Spring Plantation as an experimental farm to develop sources of income for the colony other than cultivated tobacco and traded furs.

===Cape Henry Memorial===

The Cape Henry Memorial is at the site of the landing of Captain Christopher Newport and the Jamestown colonists in 1607. It is located in the city of Virginia Beach, Virginia at Cape Henry. It open to the public and is located off U.S. Route 60 on the Navy&#x27;s Joint Expeditionary Base East.

==Administrative history==
Colonial National Monument was authorized on July 3, 1930. It was established on December 30, 1930. On June 5, 1936, it was redesignated a National Historical Park. The cemetery at Yorktown was transferred from the War Department to the National Park Service on August 10, 1933.

Jamestown National Historic Site is co-owned by the National Park Service and Preservation Virginia (formerly known as the Association for the Preservation of Virginia Antiquities) and administered by the NPS, and was designated on December 18, 1940. Preservation Virginia owns containing the remains of the original 1607 fort. The National Park Service owns the remaining of the island which contains the archeological remains of the expanded town and its island plantation sites.

As with all historical areas administered by the National Park Service, Colonial National Historical Park and Jamestown National Historic Site are listed on the National Register of Historic Places of the U.S. Department of the Interior.

<doc id="361923" wikidata="Q2551448" url="?curid=361923" title="Battle of Kirksville">
<text>The Battle of Kirksville took place during the American Civil War and was fought in the town of Kirksville, Missouri, on August 6, 1862. The Union victory helped consolidate Federal control over northeastern Missouri.

==Battle==
Confederate Col. Joseph C. Porter had been recruiting in the Macon area, to the south of Kirksville. He had assembled a brigade of between 1,500 and 2,500 ill-trained and poorly equipped troops, but his irregulars had harried and recruited as far north as Memphis, Missouri. Confederate sympathies in the Kirksville area were high (though Union sentiment was stronger than in surrounding counties), due to the Southern heritage of most of the residents. Porter had been urged to come to Kirksville by Confederate Captain Tice Cain, an Adair County farmer who claimed to be holding Kirksville with 500 fresh recruits. (In one of the battle&#x27;s mysteries, Cain disappeared and was never heard from again, according to a descendant.)

Union Colonel John McNeil of the 2nd Missouri Cavalry Regiment and his troops, totalling about 1,000, had been pursuing Porter for more than a week. Before noon on August 6, McNeil attacked Porter in the town of Kirksville, where the Confederates had concealed themselves in homes and stores and among the crops in the nearby fields, especially in the county courthouse and the commercial buildings on the square. Their presence was discovered by a Union detachment that volunteered to ride around the square in order to draw fire and cause the Confederates to reveal themselves — an act of courage which cost two Union soldiers their lives. McNeil deployed his artillery before moving in a broad line towards the town square. The subsequent cannon fire demoralized the defenders, some of whom retreated behind a rail fence, west of the square.

The Union troops then advanced in two wings, with Lt. Col. William F. Shaffer of the 2nd Missouri in command of the Union right wing and Major Henry Clay Caldwell of the 3rd Iowa Cavalry Regiment in charge of the left. As the two wings met, they succeeded in driving the Confederates from the courthouse. Porter&#x27;s remaining forces yielded ground and joined the others behind the rail fence. From this position, the Confederates poured heavy fire into McNeil&#x27;s men, but were ultimately overwhelmed. The battle began at 11 a.m. and was over by 2 p.m.

The Federals then secured the town, capturing numerous prisoners, and driving away the remaining Confederates. Three days later, another Union force arrived and finished the work begun at Kirksville, virtually destroying Porter&#x27;s command.

==Aftermath==
According to a letter by resident J. Martin, written a week after the battle, Confederate dead numbered about 200; Union 30. McNeill&#x27;s official tally was 150 Confederates killed (300-400 wounded) against 6 Union deaths (32 wounded). Two civilian casualties were noted: James Dye, a sixty-year-old farmer with two sons in the Union army, was held overnight by Porter during his approach to the town, then told to be on his way, but shot as he left. The other was Mrs. Elizabeth Cutts (also given as &quot;Kutz&quot; and &quot;Coots&quot;). Most Kirksville residents had heeded Porter&#x27;s warning to depart, but Cutts was shot when two Confederate soldiers attempted to enter the cellar where she was hiding, and she was hit by a Union bullet meant for them as she ran out.

John L. Porter, a prominent local citizen (no relation to the Confederate leader), asked for and was granted permission to treat the Confederate wounded. McNeil supplied a surgeon and instruments, the departed Porter having previously commandeered all medical equipment. The Confederate dead were deposited in several mass graves in Forest Llewellen Cemetery; a monument now marks the spot. Some were later recovered by their families. Fifteen Confederates were quickly court-martialed on McNeil&#x27;s orders and executed for having violated previous parole agreements not to take up arms again until exchanged. Although the execution was permissible within military norms, it was seldom done and McNeil has been criticized for both the justice and necessity of the proceedings, by John L. Porter (see &quot;Kirksville Daily Express&quot;, 1912, below) and Joseph Mudd (see references to Palmyra massacre), among others.

A number of other questionable shootings followed, including those of Dr. John Davis (said by some to have been told to run and then shot when he did) and Lt. Col. Frisby McCullough — a subordinate of Porter who was tried and sentenced to death as a bushwhacker, even though he was captured wearing a regular Confederate uniform and carrying letters authorizing him to recruit troops. He was granted permission to give the order to fire, and his final words were, &quot;May God forgive you for this cold-blooded murder. Aim at the heart. Fire!&quot; A second volley was necessary.

McNeil&#x27;s reputation would be darkened further by the &quot;Palmyra Massacre&quot; on October 18, but he would go on to serve two terms as Sheriff of St. Louis County, dying June 7, 1891. Porter died February 18, 1863, of wounds received in an engagement at Hartville.

The victory at Kirksville helped consolidate Union dominance in northeastern Missouri.

Memorial Park (the approximate location of the Union artillery) commemorates the battle.

<text>Order theory is a branch of mathematics that investigates the intuitive notion of order using binary relations. It provides a formal framework for describing statements such as &quot;this is less than that&quot; or &quot;this precedes that&quot;. This article introduces the field and provides basic definitions. A list of order-theoretic terms can be found in the order theory glossary.

== Background and motivation ==
Orders are everywhere in mathematics and related fields like computer science. The first order often discussed in primary school is the standard order on the natural numbers e.g. &quot;2 is less than 3&quot;, &quot;10 is greater than 5&quot;, or &quot;Does Tom have fewer cookies than Sally?&quot;. This intuitive concept can be extended to orders on other sets of numbers, such as the integers and the reals. The idea of being greater than or less than another number is one of the basic intuitions of number systems (compare with numeral systems) in general (although one usually is also interested in the actual difference of two numbers, which is not given by the order). Other familiar examples of orderings are the alphabetical order of words in a dictionary and the genealogical property of lineal descent within a group of people.

The notion of order is very general, extending beyond contexts that have an immediate, intuitive feel of sequence or relative quantity. In other contexts orders may capture notions of containment or specialization. Abstractly, this type of order amounts to the subset relation, e.g., &quot;Pediatricians are physicians,&quot; and &quot;Circles are merely special-case ellipses.&quot;

Some orders, like &quot;less-than&quot; on the natural numbers and alphabetical order on words, have a special property: each element can be &quot;compared&quot; to any other element, i.e. it is smaller (earlier) than, larger (later) than, or identical to. However, many other orders do not. Consider for example the subset order on a collection of sets: though the set of birds and the set of dogs are both subsets of the set of animals, neither the birds nor the dogs constitutes a subset of the other. Those orders like the &quot;subset-of&quot; relation for which there exist &quot;incomparable&quot; elements are called &quot;partial orders&quot;; orders for which every pair of elements is comparable are &quot;total orders&quot;.

Order theory captures the intuition of orders that arises from such examples in a general setting. This is achieved by specifying properties that a relation ≤ must have to be a mathematical order. This more abstract approach makes much sense, because one can derive numerous theorems in the general setting, without focusing on the details of any particular order. These insights can then be readily transferred to many less abstract applications.

Driven by the wide practical usage of orders, numerous special kinds of ordered sets have been defined, some of which have grown into mathematical fields of their own. In addition, order theory does not restrict itself to the various classes of ordering relations, but also considers appropriate functions between them. A simple example of an order theoretic property for functions comes from analysis where monotone functions are frequently found.

== Basic definitions ==
This section introduces ordered sets by building upon the concepts of set theory, arithmetic, and binary relations.

=== Partially ordered sets ===
Orders are special binary relations. Suppose that &quot;P&quot; is a set and that ≤ is a relation on &quot;P&quot; (&#x27;relation &quot;on&quot; a set&#x27; is taken to mean &#x27;relation &quot;amongst&quot; its inhabitants&#x27;, i.e. ≤ is a subset of the cartesian product &quot;P&quot; x &quot;P&quot;). Then ≤ is a partial order if it is reflexive, antisymmetric, and transitive, that is, if for all &quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot; and &quot;c&quot; in &quot;P&quot;, we have that:

: &quot;a&quot; ≤ &quot;a&quot; (reflexivity)
: if &quot;a&quot; ≤ &quot;b&quot; and &quot;b&quot; ≤ &quot;a&quot; then &quot;a&quot; = &quot;b&quot; (antisymmetry)
: if &quot;a&quot; ≤ &quot;b&quot; and &quot;b&quot; ≤ &quot;c&quot; then &quot;a&quot; ≤ &quot;c&quot; (transitivity).

A set with a partial order on it is called a partially ordered set, poset, or just ordered set if the intended meaning is clear. By checking these properties, one immediately sees that the well-known orders on natural numbers, integers, rational numbers and reals are all orders in the above sense. However, these examples have the additional property that any two elements are comparable, that is, for all &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; in &quot;P&quot;, we have that:

: &quot;a&quot; ≤ &quot;b&quot; or &quot;b&quot; ≤ &quot;a&quot;.

A partial order with this property is called a total order. These orders can also be called linear orders or chains. While many familiar orders are linear, the subset order on sets provides an example where this is not the case. Another example is given by the divisibility (or &quot;is-a-factor-of&quot;) relation |. For two natural numbers &quot;n&quot; and &quot;m&quot;, we write &quot;n&quot;|&quot;m&quot; if &quot;n&quot; divides &quot;m&quot; without remainder. One easily sees that this yields a partial order. For example neither 3 divides 13 nor 13 divides 3, so 3 and 13 are not comparable elements of the divisibility relation on the set of integers.
The identity relation = on any set is also a partial order in which every two distinct elements are incomparable. It is also the only relation that is both a partial order and an equivalence relation because it satisfies both the antisymmetry property of partial orders and the symmetry property of equivalence relations. Many advanced properties of posets are interesting mainly for non-linear orders.

=== Visualizing a poset ===

Hasse diagrams can visually represent the elements and relations of a partial ordering. These are graph drawings where the vertices are the elements of the poset and the ordering relation is indicated by both the edges and the relative positioning of the vertices. Orders are drawn bottom-up: if an element &quot;x&quot; is smaller than (precedes) &quot;y&quot; then there exists a path from &quot;x&quot; to &quot;y&quot; that is directed upwards. It is often necessary for the edges connecting elements to cross each other, but elements must never be located within an edge. An instructive exercise is to draw the Hasse diagram for the set of natural numbers that are smaller than or equal to 13, ordered by | (the &quot;divides&quot; relation).

Even some infinite sets can be diagrammed by superimposing an ellipsis (...) on a finite sub-order. This works well for the natural numbers, but it fails for the reals, where there is no immediate successor above 0; however, quite often one can obtain an intuition related to diagrams of a similar kind.

=== Special elements within an order ===
In a partially ordered set there may be some elements that play a special role. The most basic example is given by the least element of a poset. For example, 1 is the least element of the positive integers and the empty set is the least set under the subset order. Formally, an element &quot;m&quot; is a least element if:

: &quot;m&quot; ≤ &quot;a&quot;, for all elements &quot;a&quot; of the order.

The notation 0 is frequently found for the least element, even when no numbers are concerned. However, in orders on sets of numbers, this notation might be inappropriate or ambiguous, since the number 0 is not always least. An example is given by the above divisibility order |, where 1 is the least element since it divides all other numbers. In contrast, 0 is the number that is divided by all other numbers. Hence it is the greatest element of the order. Other frequent terms for the least and greatest elements is bottom and top or zero and unit.

Least and greatest elements may fail to exist, as the example of the real numbers shows. But if they exist, they are always unique. In contrast, consider the divisibility relation | on the set {2,3,4,5,6}. Although this set has neither top nor bottom, the elements 2, 3, and 5 have no elements below them, while 4, 5 and 6 have none above. Such elements are called minimal and maximal, respectively. Formally, an element &quot;m&quot; is minimal if:

: &quot;a&quot; ≤ &quot;m&quot; implies &quot;a&quot; = &quot;m&quot;, for all elements &quot;a&quot; of the order.

Exchanging ≤ with ≥ yields the definition of maximality. As the example shows, there can be many maximal elements and some elements may be both maximal and minimal (e.g. 5 above). However, if there is a least element, then it is the only minimal element of the order. Again, in infinite posets maximal elements do not always exist - the set of all &quot;finite&quot; subsets of a given infinite set, ordered by subset inclusion, provides one of many counterexamples. An important tool to ensure the existence of maximal elements under certain conditions is Zorn&#x27;s Lemma.

Subsets of partially ordered sets inherit the order. We already applied this by considering the subset {2,3,4,5,6} of the natural numbers with the induced divisibility ordering. Now there are also elements of a poset that are special with respect to some subset of the order. This leads to the definition of upper bounds. Given a subset &quot;S&quot; of some poset &quot;P&quot;, an upper bound of &quot;S&quot; is an element &quot;b&quot; of &quot;P&quot; that is above all elements of &quot;S&quot;. Formally, this means that

: &quot;s&quot; ≤ &quot;b&quot;, for all &quot;s&quot; in &quot;S&quot;.

Lower bounds again are defined by inverting the order. For example, -5 is a lower bound of the natural numbers as a subset of the integers. Given a set of sets, an upper bound for these sets under the subset ordering is given by their union. In fact, this upper bound is quite special: it is the smallest set that contains all of the sets. Hence, we have found the least upper bound of a set of sets. This concept is also called supremum or join, and for a set &quot;S&quot; one writes sup(&quot;S&quot;) or formula_1 for its least upper bound. Conversely, the greatest lower bound is known as infimum or meet and denoted inf(&quot;S&quot;) or formula_2. These concepts play an important role in many applications of order theory. For two elements &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot;, one also writes formula_3 and formula_4 for sup({&quot;x&quot;,&quot;y&quot;}) and inf({&quot;x&quot;,&quot;y&quot;}), respectively.

For example, 1 is the infimum of the positive integers as a subset of integers.

For another example, consider again the relation | on natural numbers. The least upper bound of two numbers is the smallest number that is divided by both of them, i.e. the least common multiple of the numbers. Greatest lower bounds in turn are given by the greatest common divisor.

=== Duality ===
In the previous definitions, we often noted that a concept can be defined by just inverting the ordering in a former definition. This is the case for &quot;least&quot; and &quot;greatest&quot;, for &quot;minimal&quot; and &quot;maximal&quot;, for &quot;upper bound&quot; and &quot;lower bound&quot;, and so on. This is a general situation in order theory: A given order can be inverted by just exchanging its direction, pictorially flipping the Hasse diagram top-down. This yields the so-called dual, inverse, or opposite order.

Every order theoretic definition has its dual: it is the notion one obtains by applying the definition to the inverse order. Since all concepts are symmetric, this operation preserves the theorems of partial orders. For a given mathematical result, one can just invert the order and replace all definitions by their duals and one obtains another valid theorem. This is important and useful, since one obtains two theorems for the price of one. Some more details and examples can be found in the article on duality in order theory.

=== Constructing new orders ===
There are many ways to construct orders out of given orders. The dual order is one example. Another important construction is the cartesian product of two partially ordered sets, taken together with the product order on pairs of elements. The ordering is defined by (&quot;a&quot;, &quot;x&quot;) ≤ (&quot;b&quot;, &quot;y&quot;) if (and only if) &quot;a&quot; ≤ &quot;b&quot; and &quot;x&quot; ≤ &quot;y&quot;. (Notice carefully that there are three distinct meanings for the relation symbol ≤ in this definition.) The disjoint union of two posets is another typical example of order construction, where the order is just the (disjoint) union of the original orders.

Every partial order ≤ gives rise to a so-called strict order &lt;, by defining &quot;a&quot; &lt; &quot;b&quot; if &quot;a&quot; ≤ &quot;b&quot; and not &quot;b&quot; ≤ &quot;a&quot;. This transformation can be inverted by setting &quot;a&quot; ≤ &quot;b&quot; if &quot;a&quot; &lt; &quot;b&quot; or &quot;a&quot; = &quot;b&quot;. The two concepts are equivalent although in some circumstances one can be more convenient to work with than the other.

== Functions between orders ==
It is reasonable to consider functions between partially ordered sets having certain additional properties that are related to the ordering relations of the two sets. The most fundamental condition that occurs in this context is monotonicity. A function &quot;f&quot; from a poset &quot;P&quot; to a poset &quot;Q&quot; is monotone, or order-preserving, if &quot;a&quot; ≤ &quot;b&quot; in &quot;P&quot; implies &quot;f&quot;(&quot;a&quot;) ≤ &quot;f&quot;(&quot;b&quot;) in &quot;Q&quot; (Noting that, strictly, the two relations here are different since they apply to different sets.). The converse of this implication leads to functions that are order-reflecting, i.e. functions &quot;f&quot; as above for which &quot;f&quot;(&quot;a&quot;) ≤ &quot;f&quot;(&quot;b&quot;) implies &quot;a&quot; ≤ &quot;b&quot;. On the other hand, a function may also be order-reversing or antitone, if &quot;a&quot; ≤ &quot;b&quot; implies &quot;f&quot;(&quot;a&quot;) ≥ &quot;f&quot;(&quot;b&quot;).

An order-embedding is a function &quot;f&quot; between orders that is both order-preserving and order-reflecting. Examples for these definitions are found easily. For instance, the function that maps a natural number to its successor is clearly monotone with respect to the natural order. Any function from a discrete order, i.e. from a set ordered by the identity order &quot;=&quot;, is also monotone. Mapping each natural number to the corresponding real number gives an example for an order embedding. The set complement on a powerset is an example of an antitone function.

An important question is when two orders are &quot;essentially equal&quot;, i.e. when they are the same up to renaming of elements. Order isomorphisms are functions that define such a renaming. An order-isomorphism is a monotone bijective function that has a monotone inverse. This is equivalent to being a surjective order-embedding. Hence, the image &quot;f&quot;(&quot;P&quot;) of an order-embedding is always isomorphic to &quot;P&quot;, which justifies the term &quot;embedding&quot;.

A more elaborate type of functions is given by so-called Galois connections. Monotone Galois connections can be viewed as a generalization of order-isomorphisms, since they constitute of a pair of two functions in converse directions, which are &quot;not quite&quot; inverse to each other, but that still have close relationships.

Another special type of self-maps on a poset are closure operators, which are not only monotonic, but also idempotent, i.e. &quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) = &quot;f&quot;(&quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;)), and extensive (or &quot;inflationary&quot;), i.e. &quot;x&quot; ≤ &quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;). These have many applications in all kinds of &quot;closures&quot; that appear in mathematics.

Besides being compatible with the mere order relations, functions between posets may also behave well with respect to special elements and constructions. For example, when talking about posets with least element, it may seem reasonable to consider only monotonic functions that preserve this element, i.e. which map least elements to least elements. If binary infima ∧ exist, then a reasonable property might be to require that &quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot; ∧ &quot;y&quot;) = &quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) ∧ &quot;f&quot;(&quot;y&quot;), for all &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot;. All of these properties, and indeed many more, may be compiled under the label of limit-preserving functions.

Finally, one can invert the view, switching from &quot;functions of orders&quot; to &quot;orders of functions&quot;. Indeed, the functions between two posets &quot;P&quot; and &quot;Q&quot; can be ordered via the pointwise order. For two functions &quot;f&quot; and &quot;g&quot;, we have &quot;f&quot; ≤ &quot;g&quot; if &quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) ≤ &quot;g&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) for all elements &quot;x&quot; of &quot;P&quot;. This occurs for example in domain theory, where function spaces play an important role.

== Special types of orders ==
Many of the structures that are studied in order theory employ order relations with further properties. In fact, even some relations that are not partial orders are of special interest. Mainly the concept of a preorder has to be mentioned. A preorder is a relation that is reflexive and transitive, but not necessarily antisymmetric. Each preorder induces an equivalence relation between elements, where &quot;a&quot; is equivalent to &quot;b&quot;, if &quot;a&quot; ≤ &quot;b&quot; and &quot;b&quot; ≤ &quot;a&quot;. Preorders can be turned into orders by identifying all elements that are equivalent with respect to this relation.

Several types of orders can be defined from numerical data on the items of the order: a total order results from attaching distinct real numbers to each item and using the numerical comparisons to order the items; instead, if distinct items are allowed to have equal numerical scores, one obtains a strict weak ordering. Requiring two scores to be separated by a fixed threshold before they may be compared leads to the concept of a semiorder, while allowing the threshold to vary on a per-item basis produces an interval order.

An additional simple but useful property leads to so-called well-founded, for which all non-empty subsets have a minimal element. Generalizing well-orders from linear to partial orders, a set is well partially ordered if all its non-empty subsets have a finite number of minimal elements.

Many other types of orders arise when the existence of infima and suprema of certain sets is guaranteed. Focusing on this aspect, usually referred to as completeness of orders, one obtains:

* Bounded posets, i.e. posets with a least and greatest element (which are just the supremum and infimum of the empty subset),
* Lattices, in which every non-empty finite set has a supremum and infimum,
* Complete lattices, where every set has a supremum and infimum, and
* Directed complete partial orders (dcpos), that guarantee the existence of suprema of all directed subsets and that are studied in domain theory.
* Partial orders with complements, or &quot;poc sets&quot;, are posets with a unique bottom element 0, as well as an order-reversing involution formula_5 such that formula_6

However, one can go even further: if all finite non-empty infima exist, then ∧ can be viewed as a total binary operation in the sense of universal algebra. Hence, in a lattice, two operations ∧ and ∨ are available, and one can define new properties by giving identities, such as

: &quot;x&quot; ∧ (&quot;y&quot; ∨ &quot;z&quot;)  =  (&quot;x&quot; ∧ &quot;y&quot;) ∨ (&quot;x&quot; ∧ &quot;z&quot;), for all &quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;, and &quot;z&quot;.

This condition is called distributivity and gives rise to distributive lattices. There are some other important distributivity laws which are discussed in the article on distributivity in order theory. Some additional order structures that are often specified via algebraic operations and defining identities are

* Heyting algebras and
* Boolean algebras,

which both introduce a new operation ~ called negation. Both structures play a role in mathematical logic and especially Boolean algebras have major applications in computer science.
Finally, various structures in mathematics combine orders with even more algebraic operations, as in the case of quantales, that allow for the definition of an addition operation.

Many other important properties of posets exist. For example, a poset is locally finite if every closed interval [&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;] in it is finite. Locally finite posets give rise to incidence algebras which in turn can be used to define the Euler characteristic of finite bounded posets.

== Subsets of ordered sets ==
In an ordered set, one can define many types of special subsets based on the given order. A simple example are upper sets; i.e. sets that contain all elements that are above them in the order. Formally, the upper closure of a set &quot;S&quot; in a poset &quot;P&quot; is given by the set {&quot;x&quot; in &quot;P&quot; | there is some &quot;y&quot; in &quot;S&quot; with &quot;y&quot; ≤ &quot;x&quot;}. A set that is equal to its upper closure is called an upper set. Lower sets are defined dually.

More complicated lower subsets are ideals, which have the additional property that each two of their elements have an upper bound within the ideal. Their duals are given by filters. A related concept is that of a directed subset, which like an ideal contains upper bounds of finite subsets, but does not have to be a lower set. Furthermore, it is often generalized to preordered sets.

A subset which is - as a sub-poset - linearly ordered, is called a chain. The opposite notion, the antichain, is a subset that contains no two comparable elements; i.e. that is a discrete order.

== Related mathematical areas ==
Although most mathematical areas &quot;use&quot; orders in one or the other way, there are also a few theories that have relationships which go far beyond mere application. Together with their major points of contact with order theory, some of these are to be presented below.

=== Universal algebra ===
As already mentioned, the methods and formalisms of universal algebra are an important tool for many order theoretic considerations. Beside formalizing orders in terms of algebraic structures that satisfy certain identities, one can also establish other connections to algebra. An example is given by the correspondence between Boolean algebras and Boolean rings. Other issues are concerned with the existence of free constructions, such as free lattices based on a given set of generators. Furthermore, closure operators are important in the study of universal algebra.

=== Topology ===
In topology, orders play a very prominent role. In fact, the collection of open sets provides a classical example of a complete lattice, more precisely a complete Heyting algebra (or &quot;frame&quot; or &quot;locale&quot;). Filters and nets are notions closely related to order theory and the closure operator of sets can be used to define a topology. Beyond these relations, topology can be looked at solely in terms of the open set lattices, which leads to the study of pointless topology. Furthermore, a natural preorder of elements of the underlying set of a topology is given by the so-called specialization order, that is actually a partial order if the topology is T0.

Conversely, in order theory, one often makes use of topological results. There are various ways to define subsets of an order which can be considered as open sets of a topology. Considering topologies on a poset (&quot;X&quot;, ≤) that in turn induce ≤ as their specialization order, the finest such topology is the Alexandrov topology, given by taking all upper sets as opens. Conversely, the coarsest topology that induces the specialization order is the upper topology, having the complements of principal ideals (i.e. sets of the form {&quot;y&quot; in &quot;X&quot; | &quot;y&quot; ≤ &quot;x&quot;} for some &quot;x&quot;) as a subbase. Additionally, a topology with specialization order ≤ may be order consistent, meaning that their open sets are &quot;inaccessible by directed suprema&quot; (with respect to ≤). The finest order consistent topology is the Scott topology, which is coarser than the Alexandrov topology. A third important topology in this spirit is the Lawson topology. There are close connections between these topologies and the concepts of order theory. For example, a function preserves directed suprema if and only if it is continuous with respect to the Scott topology (for this reason this order theoretic property is also called Scott-continuity).

=== Category theory ===
The visualization of orders with Hasse diagrams has a straightforward generalization: instead of displaying lesser elements &quot;below&quot; greater ones, the direction of the order can also be depicted by giving directions to the edges of a graph. In this way, each order is seen to be equivalent to a directed acyclic graph, where the nodes are the elements of the poset and there is a directed path from &quot;a&quot; to &quot;b&quot; if and only if &quot;a&quot; ≤ &quot;b&quot;. Dropping the requirement of being acyclic, one can also obtain all preorders.

When equipped with all transitive edges, these graphs in turn are just special categories, where elements are objects and each set of morphisms between two elements is at most singleton. Functions between orders become functors between categories. Many ideas of order theory are just concepts of category theory in small. For example, an infimum is just a categorical product. More generally, one can capture infima and suprema under the abstract notion of a categorical limit (or &quot;colimit&quot;, respectively). Another place where categorical ideas occur is the concept of a (monotone) Galois connection, which is just the same as a pair of adjoint functors.

But category theory also has its impact on order theory on a larger scale. Classes of posets with appropriate functions as discussed above form interesting categories. Often one can also state constructions of orders, like the product order, in terms of categories. Further insights result when categories of orders are found categorically equivalent to other categories, for example of topological spaces. This line of research leads to various &quot;representation theorems&quot;, often collected under the label of Stone duality.

==History==
As explained before, orders are ubiquitous in mathematics. However, the earliest explicit mentionings of partial orders are probably to be found not before the 19th century. In this context the works of George Boole are of great importance. Moreover, works of Charles Sanders Peirce, Richard Dedekind, and Ernst Schröder also consider concepts of order theory.

Contributors to ordered geometry were listed in a 1961 textbook:
In 1901 Bertrand Russell wrote &quot;On the Notion of Order&quot; exploring the foundations of the idea through generation of series. He returned to the topic in part IV of &quot;The Principles of Mathematics&quot; (1903). Russell noted that binary relation &quot;aRb&quot; has a sense proceeding from &quot;a&quot; to &quot;b&quot; with the converse relation having an opposite sense, and sense &quot;is the source of order and series.&quot; (p 95) He acknowledges Immanuel Kant was &quot;aware of the difference between logical opposition and the opposition of positive and negative&quot;. He wrote that Kant deserves credit as he &quot;first called attention to the logical importance of asymmetric relations.&quot;

The term &quot;poset&quot; as an abbreviation for partially ordered set is attributed to Garrett Birkhoff in the second edition of his influential book &quot;Lattice Theory&quot;.

<text>The is a fictional artifact and icon of Nintendo&#x27;s &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot; video game franchise. It first appeared in the original &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot; video game (1986) and has appeared in every subsequent game in the series. It consists of three equilateral triangles that are joined to form a large equilateral triangle. In-universe, it represents the essences of the Golden Goddesses—Din, Nayru and Farore—who created Hyrule. Imbued with divine power, it is capable of granting any wish to anyone who possesses it.

The three pieces of the Triforce are often in the possession of the three main characters of the series, Ganon, Zelda and Link, who each embody one of its virtues: power, wisdom and courage. Obtaining the Triforce is a frequent objective in the series, requiring the player to search for its shards and protect it from Ganon, who seeks its power for evil purposes.

The Triforce is a central motif of &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot; series, frequently appearing in &quot;Zelda&quot; iconography and merchandise. It has appeared in related media, including manga, video games and an animated television series. Due to its prominence and significance within the mythology of the &quot;Zelda&quot; series, the Triforce has become a widely recognizable symbol in gaming.

== Background ==
Although the Triforce has become associated with &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot; series, an identical symbol originated nearly 1,000 years before in medieval Japan. The symbol takes historical reference from the Hōjō clan, a family that took control of Japan in the 13th century. Its emblem (&quot;mon&quot;) was the &quot;mitsuuroko&quot;, or &quot;three scales&quot;. The symbol also appears frequently in contemporary Japanese culture. It appears on the logos for large and small businesses and can be found on temples and family memorials. Since the release of &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot; video game in 1986, the Triforce has become a recognizable icon of &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot; series, appearing in every game in some form, particularly as part of the heraldry of the Kingdom of Hyrule.

== Concept and creation ==
Shigeru Miyamoto, creator of &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot; series, explained his vision for the first game in an interview with &quot;Gamekult&quot;. He said that the Triforce fragments were originally supposed to be electronic chips, as the game was intended to be set in both the past and the future. This early futuristic concept was abandoned and replaced by a heroic fantasy. In &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot; video game, the Triforce was simply described as magical triangles of great power, but its significance was expanded in subsequent games. The first game established it as an object of desire and a central plot device that binds the three characters. Initially comprising two pieces, the third piece, the Triforce of Courage, was introduced in &quot;Zelda II: The Adventure of Link&quot;.

== Characteristics ==
The Triforce consists of three equilateral triangles that are joined to create a large equilateral triangle. Its design resembles the Sierpiński triangle. The three pieces are the Triforce of Power, the Triforce of Wisdom, and the Triforce of Courage, which represent the qualities of the Golden Goddesses: Din, the Goddess of Power; Nayru, the Goddess of Wisdom; and Farore, the Goddess of Courage. In the creation myth of the series, they created Hyrule and the Triforce and entrusted both to the Goddess Hylia. As a divine relic infused with the power of the goddesses, the Triforce is an object of limitless power, capable of granting any wish to anyone who touches it. Its place of origin is known as the Sacred Realm.

The Triforce can only be wielded by someone who possesses a balance of the three virtues in their heart: power, wisdom and courage. Conversely, if held by someone with an imbalanced heart, it splits into three pieces, with each piece bestowed on a person who represents that quality. The three virtues of the Triforce are often distributed amongst the series&#x27; three main characters: Ganon, Princess Zelda, and Link. In some &quot;Zelda&quot; games, it manifests as a symbol on the hand of the bearer of one of the pieces. The trinity within the Triforce creates a moral balance, with evil seeking power, and wisdom and courage being the opposing forces for good. A recurring theme of the series is Ganon&#x27;s plan to steal the Triforce from the Sacred Realm in order to use its power to conquer Hyrule, which is ultimately thwarted by Link and Zelda. This places the three characters in an endless battle that is repeated across the fictional timeline within a reincarnation cycle.

==Appearances==
===&quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot; series===

The Triforce is a common symbol found in the series. It is connected with the Royal Family of Hyrule and displayed as part of the Hyrule Royal Family&#x27;s signature crest, which combines the Triforce with a fictional bird called a Crimson Loftwing. It is also found on various objects within the games such as the Master Sword and the Hylian Shield and on sacred sites, such as the Temple of Time.

In 1986, the original &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot; video game introduced the Triforce, which consisted of two pieces, as a central plot device. It involves the hero, Link, embarking on a quest to save Hyrule from the evil Ganon, who has stolen the Triforce of Power. After Princess Zelda splits the Triforce of Wisdom into eight fragments and scatters them across the land, Link must search for the fragments and reassemble them to rescue Princess Zelda and defeat Ganon.

&quot;Zelda II: The Adventure of Link&quot; (1987) established the Triforce of Courage as the third piece of the Triforce. The game&#x27;s instruction manual tells the backstory of Princess Zelda being placed in a magical sleep by a wizard and sets Link&#x27;s fate as the hero who will wake her by marking the back of his hand with the Triforce. The story involves Link obtaining six crystals and then claiming the Triforce of Courage from the Great Palace. Using the three pieces of the Triforce, he is able to awaken sleeping Zelda from her curse.

The third game in the series titled &quot;A Link to the Past&quot; (1991) introduces a detailed fictional lore for the Triforce. In Japan, it was released with the title &quot;Triforce of the Gods&quot;. The game&#x27;s instruction booklet provides the creation myth explaining how three Golden Goddesses named Din, Nayru, and Farore descended to create the land of Hyrule and then created the Triforce and imbued it with the essence of their power. In the game&#x27;s backstory, Ganon enters the Sacred Realm to steal the Triforce and plunges it into darkness, creating the Dark World. To prevent Ganon from escaping and destroying the Light World, Link saves Zelda and the Sages. In the final scenes, he uses the Triforce to wish for the characters in the game to be restored.

Ganon, in his humanoid form of Ganondorf, again pursues his goal of obtaining the Triforce in &quot;Ocarina of Time&quot; (1998). Ganondorf manages to gain entry to the Sacred Realm and takes over Hyrule, plunging it into chaos. After a seven-year sleep, Link awakens as an adult and sets off to protect the Triforce from Ganondorf by travelling back and forth in time. With the help of Seven Sages, he successfully defeats Ganondorf by sealing him in the Sacred Realm. The game established the trinity of the characters each embodying one of the virtues of the Triforce.

When the game duo titled &quot;The Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Seasons&quot; and &quot;Oracle of Ages&quot; (2001) were conceived, they were originally intended to be a trilogy, with each story centred on one of the three virtues of the Triforce. In each game the Triforce initiates the adventure by summoning Link and transporting him to the worlds of Holodrum and Labrynna to collect eight Essences of Nature or Time in order to defeat the games&#x27; villains, Onox and Veran.

In &quot;The Wind Waker&quot; (2002), Link must collect eight pieces of the Triforce of Courage, which are scattered across the islands on the map, before he is ready to confront Ganondorf. The Triforce hunt, which was described by &quot;GameSpot&quot; as &quot;infamous&quot;, is a lengthy process involving finding the chart locations, returning to Tingle and then finding the Triforce shards. Due to the tedious nature of the task, it was later simplified in &quot;The Wind Waker HD&quot;. In the finale, Ganondorf unites the Triforce, but before he can make his wish to rule Hyrule, the King of Hyrule&#x27;s spirit touches it and wishes for Hyrule to be destroyed, resulting in a final battle between Ganondorf, Link and Zelda.

The Triforce does not play a major role in &quot;Twilight Princess&quot; (2006). At the beginning of the game, each of the three main characters is shown to be in possession of their individual component by glowing triangles that appear on their hands, but otherwise the Triforce only appears on murals and buildings.

&quot;Skyward Sword&quot; (2011) again focuses on the creation of the Triforce by the three Goddesses. In the game&#x27;s backstory, demonic creatures rise from cracks in the earth led by Demonic King Demise with the intention of claiming the Triforce. To protect it, the goddess Hylia commands an army of the world&#x27;s people to fight Demise. She seals him away and after becoming mortal, sends the humans to live above the surface world in Skyloft. She hides the Triforce in the sky to await the hero, Link, who recovers the three Triforce pieces from the Sky Keep and uses its powers to defeat Demise.

In &quot;A Link Between Worlds&quot; (2013), another version of the Triforce was introduced in the fictional universe. In Japan, the game is known as &quot;Triforce of the Gods 2&quot;, as it is a spiritual sequel to &quot;A Link to the Past&quot;. It takes place in two mirrored worlds, the Light World (Hyrule) and the Dark World (Lorule). Unlike Hyrule, Lorule has crumbled, caused by its people destroying its own Triforce, due to it being the cause of war. To save her world, Princess Hilda plots to steal Hyrule&#x27;s Triforce. By the end of the game, she sympathises with Hyrule and allows Link and Zelda to return there with their Triforce. In an act of compassion, the two use the Hyrulean Triforce to recreate Lorule&#x27;s Triforce.

Nintendo published &quot;Tri Force Heroes&quot; (2015) for the 3DS, a cooperative multiplayer game involving three Links dressed in red, blue and green. Hiromasa Shikata, the game&#x27;s director, explained that the concept for the game was a &quot;triangular relationship between three players&quot;.

Despite its prominence in the &quot;Zelda&quot; series, the Triforce plays no part in the storyline of &quot;Breath of the Wild&quot; (2017). It appears in various places within the game and manifests itself on the hand of Zelda in the battle against Calamity Ganon. The three virtues of the Triforce are present in the form of three springs located in different regions of the map, namely the Spring of Power, the Spring of Wisdom and the Spring of Courage. The Triforce continued to be absent from the series as a plot device with the release of &quot;Tears of the Kingdom&quot; (2023), although it appears on in-game architecture and as a tattoo on the arm of the character Sonia. This led to speculation amongst players that it has been abandoned as a major element of the series.

In &quot;Echoes of Wisdom&quot; (2024), the Triforce appears again but is described as &quot;Prime Energy&quot;. In a &quot;Famitsu&quot; interview, Aonuma explained that he decided to &quot;bring out the Triforce&quot; because it was necessary for the story. The development team knew that the game would end with obtaining the Triforce but felt that its image was too strong. For this reason, they set the story in an undefined time period to give the impression that the inhabitants had forgotten the Triforce and had only a vague idea of its existence.

=== Television series ===
In &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot; animated series the Triforce consists of two pieces, with Ganon possessing the Triforce of Power and Zelda possessing the Triforce of Wisdom. The plot of each episode revolves around Ganon&#x27;s attempts to gain control of both Triforce pieces so that he can become the ruler of Hyrule. The series gave the Wisdom and Power pieces a voice and a role in the story. Phil Harnage, one of the show&#x27;s writers explained that this dialogue was used to explain the show&#x27;s events. The cartoon&#x27;s voice cast included Elizabeth Hanna as the Triforce of Wisdom and Allen Stewart-Coates as the Triforce of Power.

=== Manga and comics ===
Following the release of &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot; video game, a companion manga book titled &quot;The Hyrule Fantasy&quot; was released in Japan by Wanpaku Comics in September 1986. It follows the game&#x27;s story, involving the eight fragments of the Triforce. In 1992, a &quot;Choose Your Own Adventure&quot;-style book was released in Japanese titled &quot;The Legend of Zelda: The Triforce of the Gods&quot;. It was based on &quot;A Link to the Past&quot;, though some story elements deviated from the game. Two manga adaptations of &quot;A Link to the Past&quot; were also published by Ataru Cagiva in 1995 and Akira Himekawa in 2005 with the Japanese title &quot;Triforce of the Gods&quot;. Akira Himekawa also produced a manga book published by Viz Media, which is based on &quot;Ocarina of Time&quot; and follows the game&#x27;s plot involving Link&#x27;s quest to protect the Triforce from Ganondorf. In the early 1990s, Valiant Comics published &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot; comic book based on the animated series. In the third issue, Link is corrupted by the Triforce of Power and attacks Zelda to obtain the Triforce of Wisdom. In the fifth issue, the second storyline is titled &quot;The Day of the Triforce&quot;, which involves Link battling without his Triforce power due to its disappearance.

=== Video games ===
The Triforce has appeared in various other video games. In the series spin-off hack and slash video game &quot;Hyrule Warriors&quot; (2014), the Triforce is the objective for one of the main antagonists, Cia. Originally a guardian of the Triforce, she is corrupted by Ganon after displaying affections for Link and builds an army to obtain the Triforce. It also appears in the &quot;Super Smash Bros.&quot; series. In &quot;Super Smash Bros. Brawl&quot; Link uses the Triforce in his final smash. In &quot;Super Smash Bros for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U&quot;, Link&#x27;s and Toon Link&#x27;s final smash is the Triforce Slash, which traps enemies in the Triforce before relentlessly slashing at them. In &quot;Super Smash Bros. Ultimate&quot;, the Triforce Slash appears in Toon Link&#x27;s and Young Link&#x27;s &quot;Final Smash&quot; attack. In the same game, Zelda uses the Triforce of Wisdom as her Final Smash, which produces a glowing triangle that sucks in opponents and deals damage. In &quot;Sonic Lost World&quot;″s &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot; DLC stage, Sonic the Hedgehog travels through Hyrule in search of the Triforce. In &quot;Mario Kart 8&quot;″s &quot;The Legend of Zelda × Mario Kart 8&quot; expansion pack and its enhanced Nintendo Switch port, one of the grand prix cups is known as the &quot;Triforce Cup&quot; with custom vehicle parts including the Triforce Tires. The Triforce was used in &quot;Splatoon 3&quot; by Nintendo to promote &quot;Tears of the Kingdom&quot; prior to its release in May 2023. In the Triforce Splatfest, players were asked to choose Power, Wisdom or Courage as their team. The Tricolor Turf War was fought on a triangular map to represent the shape of the Triforce.

=== Other media ===
In 2017, Nintendo rolled out an escape room experience across eight cities in North America titled &quot;Defenders of the Triforce&quot;.

&quot;Triforce&quot; is also a name given to an arcade board system that was a joint venture from three companies; Namco, Nintendo and Sega using a combination of Nintendo GameCube and Sega GD-ROM hardware inside a Namco cabinet.

=== In popular culture ===
The Triforce has been used as a shibboleth and a meme to embarrass newer users of the imageboard website 4chan. Experienced users write it using Unicode characters, but copying and pasting the Triforce results in the symbol becoming misaligned.

Due to its simple design and popularity with gamers, the Triforce has become one of the most popular gaming tattoos. Professional wrestler Cody Rhodes, a longtime &quot;Legend of Zelda&quot; fan, formerly had the Triforce on his wrestling boots in his early career with the WWE.

The Triforce has inspired the production of &quot;Zelda&quot;-themed products, including a beer named Triforce IPA.

In 2023, the British metal band DragonForce released a single titled &quot;Power of the Triforce&quot;, which is a tribute to &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot; series.

== Merchandise ==
The Triforce regularly appears on official &quot;Zelda&quot; merchandise, including clothing and accessories. It is prominently displayed on the cover of &quot;The Legend of Zelda Encyclopedia&quot;, which is published by Dark Horse. In 2023, it was recreated as a logic puzzle for Nintendo by a Japanese toy manufacturer. Images of the Triforce appear on a set of official t-shirts that were released for the Triforce-themed Splatfest.

== Reception ==
The Triforce has become a recognisable icon of &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot; series. It has been carved into headstones and used as a family crest. Brian Ashcraft of &quot;Kotaku&quot; commented that, although the inspiration for the Triforce is unknown, the symbol is found on the grave of Japanese video game designer Gunpei Yokoi, creator of the Game Boy, as his family crest or &quot;kamon&quot; (家紋). Florent Gorges, author of &quot;The History of Nintendo&quot;, opined that the symbol is so ubiquitous in Japan that Yokoi&#x27;s protégé, Shigeru Miyamoto, could not have ignored it and had reused the design for the &quot;Zelda&quot; series. Ashcraft also remarked that the Triforce had such an impact on the younger Japanese generation, that the crest is now widely recognised, not as the &quot;mitsuuroko&quot; symbol, but as the icon of &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot; series. In 1999, the Triforce in &quot;Ocarina of Time&quot; became the centre of a hoax, where a user account successfully convinced the &quot;Zelda&quot; fandom that the Triforce could be acquired, by posting a series of fake hints that were eventually debunked. &quot;Kotaku&quot; described it as &quot;one of the greatest hoaxes in video game history&quot;. In 2016, Kate Gray of &quot;TechRadar&quot; noted that players persisted in their search for the Triforce in &quot;Ocarina of Time&quot;, using various methods of play in the hope of recovering it.

Stephen Totilo, writing for &quot;Kotaku&quot;, highlighted that in 2016 &quot;Zelda&quot; series producer Eiji Aonuma used the Triforce to reinforce the fixed gender roles of the three main characters in the series. Aonuma stated that the concept of creating a female version of Link, &quot;would mess with the balance of the Triforce&quot; and had been rejected by Nintendo for that reason. Jacob Kastrenakes of &quot;The Verge&quot; strongly disagreed by commenting that, although the three characters possess and embody the three virtues of the Triforce, the pieces could &quot;theoretically be held by others in Hyrule&quot; and that none of the Triforce pieces relate to gender.

The Triforce has been the subject of interpretation with regards to its significance within the &quot;Zelda&quot; series. Luke Cuddy considered that the Triforce can be interpreted as a lesson in morality that can be applied in the real world, as each of the three Triforce pieces is equal and could be used by the three main characters for good or evil, depending on how they choose to act. Anthony Bean opined that the Triforce is a symbol of the self in Jungian psychology, because it &quot;serves as a connection between Hyrule (the conscious, mortal realm) and the goddesses (the unconscious, divine realm) just as the self serves as a meeting point for the ego and the unconscious&quot;. &quot;Edge&quot; staff commented that the Triforce is the &quot;deus ex machina&quot; of &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot; series, stating that, of all the world-saving devices in gaming, it is &quot;the most visually iconic and symbolically potent one&quot; and noted its Christian similarities: &quot;salvation through a trinity that is also one&quot;.

Luke Plunkett of &quot;Kotaku&quot; opined that the Triforce is &quot;one of the most iconic designs in the history of video games&quot; and &quot;the object that lies at the heart of &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot;&quot;. &quot;Eurogamer&quot; staff commented that the Triforce symbolises &quot;Zelda&#x27;s perpetually cycling legend&quot; and is the blueprint for every game in the series, with Link representing &quot;agency, curiosity, the eternal innocence&quot;, Ganon representing &quot;selfishness, megalomania, destruction&quot; and Zelda representing &quot;insight and direction&quot;. Nicole Carpenter for &quot;Polygon&quot; commented that the Triforce has become a ubiquitous symbol that is widely recognised amongst gamers. She highlighted that it creates a sense of community for many isolated gamers and also provides personal significance to those who find comfort and meaning in its symbolism.

<text>Toro was a Canadian men&#x27;s magazine. It was named by its owner, Christopher Bratty. The editorial was overseen by Derek Finkle. Cameron Williamson and Alicia Kowalewski were the creative and art directors, respectively.

==Brand lineage==
In 2003, &quot;TORO&quot; magazine entered into the Canadian marketplace as a glossy men&#x27;s lifestyle publication, distributed by &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; as well as by subscription and newsstand. During its four-year run, TORO garnered more than 60 National Magazine Award nominations. In 2007, &quot;TORO&quot; magazine suspended publication.

A web-only version of TORO launched in May 2008, co-founded by Christopher Bratty and William Morassutti, the founding editor. The digital TORO reached a peak monthly readership of 543,000 unique visitors in October, 2010 (ComScore/October, 2010) and operated for five years, until 2013, at which point publication was suspended.

<doc id="361933" wikidata="Q2039332" url="?curid=361933" title="Strut">
<text>A strut is a structural component commonly found in engineering, aeronautics, architecture and anatomy. Struts generally work by resisting longitudinal compression, but they may also serve in tension.

A stay is sometimes used as a synonym for strut, but some sources distinguish that struts are braces for holding compressive forces apart, while stays are braces for keeping stretching forces together.

==Human anatomy==

Part of the functionality of the clavicle is to serve as a strut between the scapula and sternum, resisting forces that would otherwise bring the upper limb close to the thorax. Keeping the upper limb away from the thorax is vital for its range of motion. Complete lack of clavicles may be seen in cleidocranial dysostosis, and the abnormal proximity of the shoulders to the median plane in cases of this genetic condition exemplifies the clavicle&#x27;s importance as a strut.

==Architecture and construction==
Strut is a common name in timber framing for a support or brace of scantlings lighter than a post. Frequently struts are found in roof framing from either a tie beam or a king post to a principal rafter. Struts may be vertically plumb or leaning (then called canted, raking, or angled) and may be straight or curved. In the U.K., strut is generally used in a sense of a lighter duty piece: a king post carries a ridge beam but a king strut does not, a queen post carries a plate but a queen strut does not, a crown post carries a crown plate but a crown strut does not.

Strutting or blocking between floor joists adds strength to the floor system.

Struts provide outwards-facing support in their lengthwise direction, which can be used to keep two other components separate, performing the opposite function of a &quot;tie&quot;.

In piping, struts restrain movement of a component in one direction while allowing movement or contraction in another direction.

Strut channel made from steel, aluminium, or fibre-reinforced plastic is used heavily in the building industry and is often used in the support of cable trays and other forms of cable management, and pipes support systems.

==Aircraft==

Bracing struts and wires of many kinds were extensively used in early aircraft to stiffen and strengthen, and sometimes even to form, the main functional airframe. Throughout the 1920s and 1930s they fell out of use in favour of the low drag cantilever construction. Most aircraft bracing struts are principally loaded in compression, with wires taking the tension loads. Lift struts came into increasing use during the changeover period and remain in use on smaller aircraft today where ultimate performance is not an issue. Typically, they are applied to a high wing monoplane and act in tension during flight.

Struts have also been widely used for purely structural reasons to attach engines, landing gear and other loads. The oil-sprung legs of retractable landing gear are still called &quot;Oleo struts&quot;.

==Automobiles==
As components of an automobile chassis, struts can be passive braces to reinforce the chassis and/or body, or active components of the suspension. An example of an active unit would be a coilover design in an automotive suspension. The coilover combines a shock absorber and a spring in a single unit.

A common form of automotive suspension strut in an automobile is the MacPherson strut. MacPherson struts are often purchased by the automakers in sets of four completed sub-assemblies: These can be mounted on the car bodies as part of the manufacturers&#x27; own assembly operations. A MacPherson strut combines the primary function of a shock absorber (as a damper), with the ability to support sideways loads not along its axis of compression, somewhat similar to a sliding pillar suspension, thus eliminating the need for an upper suspension arm. This means that a strut must have a more rugged design, with mounting points near its middle for attachment of such loads.

Another common type of strut used in air suspension is an air strut which combines the shock absorber with an air spring and can be designed in the same fashion as a coilover device. These come available in most types of suspension setups including beam axle and MacPherson strut style design.

Transportation-related struts are used in &quot;load bearing&quot; applications ranging from both highway and off-road suspensions to automobile hood and hatch window supports to aircraft wing supports. The majority of struts feature a bearing, but only for the cases, when the strut mounts operate as steering pivots. For such struts, the bearing is the wear item, as it is subject to constant impact of vibration and its condition reflects both wheel alignment and steering response. In vehicle suspension systems, struts are most commonly an assembly of coil-over spring and shock absorber. Other variants to using a coil-over spring as the compressible load bearer include support via pressurized nitrogen gas acting as the spring, and rigid (hard tail) support which provides neither longitudinal compression/extension nor damping.

=== History ===
Struts were created in the 1970s in which automakers transitioned from large rear-wheeled drive vehicles to more fuel-efficient front-wheeled drive vehicles. The entire suspension system was changed in accordance to meet the new style of vehicles. The new styles of vehicles left less room for the traditional system, which was called the short-arm/ long-arm suspension systems. This caused the MacPherson strut system to become the new standard for all automobiles including front-wheeled and rear-wheeled vehicles. The MacPherson strut system does not require an upper control arm, bushings, or a pivot shaft like previous models.

=== Options on vehicles ===
Struts are not necessarily needed components on vehicles which separate the springs and shock absorbers, while the shocks support no weight. There are also some vehicles with the option of only having one pair of struts on one set of wheels while the other pair uses a separate selection of shocks and springs. This singular pair of struts are almost always a MacPherson strut. These choices are made for various reasons including the balance of initial cost, performance, and other elements. Some vehicles use a &quot;double wishbone,&quot; suspension system which exclusively uses shock absorbers. Sports cars seem to favor this suspension style; however, the Porsche 911 favors traditional struts.

=== Maintenance ===
Struts keeps your suspension aligned, along with numerous other functions. To check if a set of struts is failing; simply walk to each side of the wheel and begin to bounce the car up and down. As the car is pushed down, let it bounce back into position. If it continues to bounce up and down, consider taking your vehicle to a mechanic for replacement. You can also check your strut car to see if it&#x27;s leaking oil. Bad struts could possibly lead to many issues including the breaking of a wheel, flattening of a tire, damaged power steering, broken springs, broken joints, and many more issues in your suspension system. Keep all of these in mind as you drive your vehicle with bad struts.

<text>Mary Tyler &quot;Molly&quot; Ivins (August 30, 1944 – January 31, 2007) was an American newspaper columnist, author, and political commentator, known for her humorous and insightful writing, which often used satire and wit to critique political figures and policies. 

Born in California and raised in Texas, Ivins attended Smith College and the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism. She began her journalism career at the &quot;Minneapolis Tribune&quot; where she became the first female police reporter at the paper. Ivins joined &quot;The Texas Observer&quot; in the early 1970s and later moved to &quot;The New York Times&quot;. She became a columnist for the &quot;Dallas Times Herald&quot; in the 1980s, and then the &quot;Fort Worth Star-Telegram&quot; after the &quot;Times Herald&quot; was sold and shuttered in 1991. Her column was subsequently syndicated by Creators Syndicate and carried by hundreds of newspapers. 

A biography of Ivins, &quot;Molly Ivins: A Rebel Life&quot;, was co-written in 2010 by PEN-USA winning presidential biographer Bill Minutaglio and W. Michael Smith. The &quot;Forbes Media Guide Five Hundred, 1994&quot; said: 
==Early life==
Ivins was born in Monterey, California, and raised in Houston, Texas. Her father, James Ivins, known as &quot;General Jim&quot; because of his rigid authoritarianism (or sometimes &quot;Admiral Jim&quot; for his love of sailing), was an oil and gas executive, and the family lived in Houston&#x27;s affluent River Oaks neighborhood. Ivins graduated from St. John&#x27;s School in 1962. In high school, she was active in extracurricular activities, including the yearbook staff. She had her first pieces of journalism published in &quot;The Review&quot;, the official student newspaper of St. John&#x27;s School, though she never wrote any of the political columns that would become her specialty later in life. Ivins later became co-editor of the arts and culture section of the student paper. In addition, she frequently participated in theater productions and earned a lifetime membership in &quot;Johnnycake&quot;, the drama club.

Ivins enrolled in Scripps College in 1962, but was not happy there, and transferred to Smith College in 1963. During that time, she became romantically involved with Henry &quot;Hank&quot; Holland, Jr., a family friend and student at Yale whom she referred to as &quot;the love of my life&quot;. After he was killed in a motorcycle accident in 1964, her friends would later say that she never seemed to find anyone else who could replace his memory. Some say that is why she never married. She spent her junior year at the Institute of Political Science in Paris and received a Bachelor of Arts degree in history in 1966. She earned a master&#x27;s degree from Columbia University&#x27;s School of Journalism in 1967.

==Career==
While at Smith, Ivins spent three summers as an intern at the &quot;Houston Chronicle&quot;. Her jobs there included the complaint department as well as &quot;sewer editor&quot;, as she put it, responsible for reporting on the nuts and bolts of local city life. After graduating from Columbia, she took a job in the Twin Cities at the &quot;Minneapolis Tribune&quot;, where she covered &quot;militant blacks, angry Indians, radical students, uppity women and a motley assortment of other misfits and troublemakers&quot;.

In 1970 Ivins left the &quot;Tribune&quot; for the city of Austin, Texas, hired by Ronnie Dugger, to be the co-editor and political reporter for &quot;The Texas Observer&quot;. She covered the Texas Legislature and befriended folklorist John Henry Faulk, Secretary of State Bob Bullock and future Governor Ann Richards, among others. She also gained increasing national attention through op-ed and feature stories in &quot;The New York Times&quot; and &quot;The Washington Post&quot; along with a busy speaking schedule inside and outside Texas. The &quot;Times&quot;, concerned that its prevailing writing style was too staid and lifeless, hired her away from the &quot;Observer&quot; in 1976, and she wrote for the &quot;Times&quot; until 1982. During her run there, Ivins became Rocky Mountain bureau chief, covering nine western states, although she was known to say she was named chief because there was no one else in the bureau. 

Ivins also wrote the obituary for Elvis Presley in &quot;The New York Times&quot; for the August 17, 1977, edition. Generally, her more colorful writing style clashed with the editors&#x27; expectations, and in 1980, after she wrote about a &quot;community chicken-killing festival&quot; in New Mexico and called it a &quot;gang-pluck&quot;, she was recalled to New York City as punishment. When Abe Rosenthal, editor of the &quot;Times&quot;, accused her of trying to inspire readers to think &quot;dirty thoughts&quot; with these words, her response was, &quot;Damn if I could fool you, Mr. Rosenthal.&quot; In late 1981, after receiving an offer from the &quot;Dallas Times Herald&quot; to write a column about anything she liked, Ivins left New York City for Dallas.

Ivins wrote for the &quot;Dallas Times Herald&quot; for ten years and was nominated for the Pulitzer Prize twice. By 1985 the editors had moved her to the paper&#x27;s Austin bureau to reduce friction with Dallas city leaders. Her freelance work and speaking engagements continued to grow, and she hired Elizabeth Faulk, John Henry Faulk&#x27;s widow, as a personal assistant. In 1991, her book &quot;Molly Ivins Can&#x27;t Say That, Can She?&quot; was published, and spent 29 weeks on the New York Times bestseller list. Also in 1991, rival newspaper, &quot;The Dallas Morning News&quot; bought the &quot;Times Herald&quot; and closed it down. The &quot;Fort Worth Star-Telegram&quot; immediately made Ivins an offer and said she could stay in Austin. Ivins accepted, and wrote a column for the Fort Worth paper from 1992 until 2001, when she became an independent journalist. Her column, syndicated by Creators Syndicate, eventually appeared in nearly 400 newspapers nationwide. Ivins also remained a board member and contributor to the Texas Democracy Foundation, which publishes the &quot;Texas Observer&quot; in Austin.

She also wrote for the &quot;Progressive&quot;, &quot;the Nation&quot;, &quot;Newsweek&quot;, &quot;Mother Jones&quot;, &quot;McCall&#x27;s&quot; and &quot;Playboy&quot;. She has appeared on &quot;Nightline&quot;, PBS&#x27;s &quot;MacNeil/Lehrer News Hour&quot;, National Public Radio’s &quot;All Things Considered&quot; and &quot;Talk of the Nation&quot;.

==Plagiarism allegations==
In 1995, humorist Florence King wrote an article in &quot;The American Enterprise&quot; claiming that Ivins had plagiarized King&#x27;s work in a 1988 &quot;Mother Jones&quot; article. Like Ivins, King—who was referred to as the &quot;Queen of Mean&quot; by &quot;National Review&quot;, which published her columns—pulled no punches in her writing. David Rubien, writing in &quot;Salon&quot;, described the incident: &quot;In a 1995 article for &quot;Mother Jones&quot; on Southern manners and mores, she extensively quoted, with affectionate attribution, statements from Florence King&#x27;s book &quot;Southern Ladies and Gentlemen&quot;. But for some careless reason Ivins still fails to comprehend, she left the attribution off a few King statements.&quot; Ivins had also included her own words in a quotation she attributed to King. Ivins wrote a letter of apology to King, but characteristically ended it with: &quot;As for the rest of your observations about me and my work ..., boy you really are a mean bitch, aren&#x27;t you? Sincerely, Molly Ivins, plagiarist.&quot; &quot;The American Enterprise&quot; published Ivins&#x27;s apology and King&#x27;s reply in a later issue.

==Health issues==
For more than three decades, Ivins struggled with alcoholism, described in her &quot;The Nation&quot; obituary as an &quot;occupational hazard&quot; of journalism. In her notebooks, she wrote of her struggles, &quot;I should like to think the biggest mistake I have made in the first 30 years of my life was to start drinking and keep drinking&quot; and &quot;I have wasted so much time by getting drunk ... I have jeopardized my job from drinking and failed in my responsibilities as a journalist.&quot;

Late in her life, she took some steps to treat the condition, spending some time at a &quot;drunk school&quot;, then attending Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) meetings for the last year-and-a-half of her life.

In 1999, Ivins was diagnosed with stage III inflammatory breast cancer. The cancer recurred in 2003 and again in late 2005. In January 2006, she reported that she was again undergoing chemotherapy. In December 2006, she took leave from her column to again undergo treatment. She wrote two columns in January 2007 but returned to the hospital on January 26 for further treatment.

==Death==
Ivins died at her Austin, Texas, home in hospice care on January 31, 2007, at age 62.

After her death, George W. Bush, a frequent target of her barbs, said in a statement, &quot;I respected her convictions, her passionate belief in the power of words. She fought her illness with that same passion. Her quick wit and commitment will be missed.&quot;

The Molly Ivins Papers are at the Dolph Briscoe Center for American History, while her personal library was donated to the Witliff Collections at Texas State University. 

From August 23 to October 28, 2012, actress Kathleen Turner portrayed Molly Ivins in the play &quot;Red Hot Patriot: The Kick-Ass Wit of Molly Ivins&quot; by twin sisters and journalists Margaret and Allison Engel at Arena Stage in Washington, D.C., and at the Berkeley Repertory Theatre in Berkeley, California. Janice Engel (no relation) produced and directed a documentary, &quot;Raise Hell: The Life &amp; Times of Molly Ivins,&quot; inspired by the play.

==Beliefs==
Writing from an unabashedly populist perspective, Ivins repeatedly described herself as a populist and, on some occasions, as a left-libertarian. Ivins peppered her columns with colorful phrases to create the &quot;feel&quot; of Texas. Her writings often employ irony and satirical humor to make a very serious point. For example, in her 1993 essay &quot;Taking a Stab at Our Infatuation with Guns&quot;, she begins by saying:

When outraged by instances of what she considered malfeasance or stupidity on the part of public officials, she couched her argument in an air of stunned amusement. She enjoyed telling stories about the Texas Legislature, which she simply called &quot;The Lege&quot;, calling it one of the most corrupt, incompetent, and funniest governing bodies in the nation. For example:

Practice, practice, practice, that&#x27;s what Texas provides when it comes to sleaze and stink. Who can forget such great explanations as &quot;Well, I&#x27;ll just make a little bit of money, I won&#x27;t make a whole lot&quot;? And &quot;There was never a Bible in the room&quot;?

In 2003, she coined the term &quot;Great Liberal Backlash of 2003&quot;, and was a passionate critic of the 2003 Iraq War. She is also credited with applying the nicknames &quot;Shrub&quot; and &quot;Dubya&quot; to George W. Bush. Ivins supported affirmative action and denounced President Bush for choosing Martin Luther King Jr.&#x27;s birthday to announce his opposition to the use of racial quotas at the University of Michigan.

==Quotations==
Notable quotes attributed to Ivins include:

*&quot;Politics is not a picture on a wall or a television sitcom that you can decide you don’t much care for… politics is not about those people in Washington, those people in your state capitol… this country is run by us, it is our deal, we run this country, we are the board of directors, we own it, they are just the people we’ve hired to drive the bus for a while.&quot;

*On the subject of Pat Buchanan&#x27;s combative Culture War Speech at the 1992 Republican Convention, which attracted controversy over Buchanan&#x27;s aggressive rhetoric against Bill Clinton, liberals, supporters of abortion and gay rights, and for his comparison of American politics to religious warfare, Ivins quipped that the speech had &quot;probably sounded better in the original German&quot;. 

*&quot;We are the people who run this country. We are the deciders. And every single day, every single one of us needs to step outside and take some action to help stop this war. ... We need people in the streets, banging pots and pans and demanding, &#x27;Stop it, now!&#x27;&quot; (from her last column)

*&quot;Having breast cancer is massive amounts of no fun. First they mutilate you; then they poison you; then they burn you. I have been on blind dates better than that.&quot;

*&quot;So keep fightin&#x27; for freedom and justice, beloveds, but don&#x27;t you forget to have fun doin&#x27; it. Lord, let your laughter ring forth. Be outrageous, ridicule the fraidy-cats, rejoice in all the oddities that freedom can produce. And when you get through kickin&#x27; ass and celebratin&#x27; the sheer joy of a good fight, be sure to tell those who come after how much fun it was.&quot;—quoted by John Nichols for &quot;The Nation&quot; Original source: &quot;The Fun&#x27;s in the Fight&quot; column for &quot;Mother Jones&quot;, 1993. Part of the original quote is currently posted in The Daily Beast offices.

*On Bill Clinton: &quot;If left to my own devices, I&#x27;d spend all my time pointing out that he&#x27;s weaker than bus-station chili. But the man is so constantly subjected to such hideous and unfair abuse that I wind up standing up for him on the general principle that some fairness should be applied. Besides, no one but a fool or a Republican ever took him for a liberal.&quot; (Introduction to &quot;You Got to Dance With Them What Brung You&quot;)

*On James M. Collins, U.S. Representative, R-Dallas: &quot;If his IQ slips any lower we&#x27;ll have to water him twice a day.&quot; Collins had said that the current energy crisis could be averted if &quot;we didn&#x27;t use all that gas on school busing.&quot; Ivins&#x27;s quote engendered substantial controversy, with calls and letters pouring into her newspaper, &quot;The Dallas Times Herald&quot;. The newspaper turned the controversy into a publicity campaign, with billboards all over the city asking, &quot;Molly Ivins Can&#x27;t Say That, Can She?&quot;—which she later employed as the title for her first book.

*&quot;Of Bush&#x27;s credentials as an economic conservative, there is no question at all—he owes his political life to big corporate money; he&#x27;s a CEO&#x27;s wet dream. He carries their water, he&#x27;s stumpbroke—however you put it, George W. Bush is a wholly owned subsidiary of corporate America. ... We can find no evidence that it has ever occurred to him to question whether it is wise to do what big business wants.&quot;

<doc id="361937" wikidata="Q212624" url="?curid=361937" title="Legate (ancient Rome)">
<text>A legate (Latin: , ) was a high-ranking Roman military officer in the Roman army, equivalent to a high-ranking general officer of modern times. Initially used to delegate power, the term became formalised under Augustus as the officer in command of a Roman legion.

From the times of the Roman Republic, legates received large shares of the military&#x27;s rewards at the end of a successful campaign. This made the position a lucrative one, so it could often attract even distinguished consuls or other high-ranking political figures within Roman politics (e.g., the consul Lucius Julius Caesar volunteered late in the Gallic Wars as a legate under his first cousin, Gaius Julius Caesar). 

Diplomats and envoys sent by Rome were also given the title of legate.

==History==
===Roman Republic===
The rank of legate existed as early as the Samnite Wars, but it was not until 190 BC that it started to be standardized, meant to better manage the higher numbers of soldiers the Second Punic War had forced to recruit. The legate of a Roman Republican army was essentially a supreme military tribune, drawn from among the senatorial class of Rome (usually a consul or proconsul), who acted as a second-in-command to the magistrate in charge of the force. This role was usually played by either seasoned generals or ambitious young senators; the latter option eventually displaced the military tribune as a path to gain recognition.

The legate was officially assigned by the Senate, the republic&#x27;s highest governing body. An appointment was generally only done after consulting with the magistrate in command, hoping to pair a commander and a lieutenant who could work together without trouble. This was established to avoid clashes of leadership like that of the consuls Varro and Paulus in Cannae. The legate often acted as a military consultant or adviser, like Scipio Africanus did for his brother Lucius during the Roman–Seleucid War, or as a trusted man of action, as in the case of Lucius Quinctius Flamininus and his brother Titus in their campaigns.

After the changes in the army of the late Republic around the 1st century BCE (often referred to as the &quot;Marian reforms&quot;, although the accuracy of this designation is disputed), the figure of the legate as a major second-in-command was eliminated. Multiple legati were assigned to every army, each in command of a legion, which was called &quot;legatus legionis&quot;. Julius Caesar made wide use of this title throughout the Gallic Wars. Initially, only conflicts on foreign ground had demanded the presence of legati, but the beginning of the Social War in 90 BC saw them being increasingly deployed in Italia.

There were two main positions. The was an ex-praetor given command of one of Rome&#x27;s legions, while the &quot;legatus pro praetore&quot; was an ex-consul given the governorship of a Roman province, with the magisterial powers of a praetor, which in some cases included command of four or more legions. A legate was entitled to twelve &quot;lictors&quot;, who carried out punishments with fasces (bundled rods). A &quot;legatus legionis&quot; could order capital punishment.

===Roman Empire===
From Augustus onwards, the emperor gave the title of &quot;legatus legionis&quot; to senior commanders (former military tribunes) of a legion, except in Egypt and Mesopotamia where the legions were commanded by a &quot;praefectus legionis&quot; of an equestrian rank. The &quot;legatus legionis&quot; was under the supreme command of a &quot;legatus Augusti pro praetore&quot; of senatorial rank. If the province was defended by a single legion, the &quot;legatus Augusti pro praetore&quot; was also in direct command of the legion. This post was generally appointed by the emperor. The person chosen for this rank was a former tribune, and although the emperor Augustus set a maximum term of command of two years for a &quot;legatus&quot;, subsequent emperors extended the tenure to three or four years, although the incumbent could serve for a much longer period. In a province with only one legion, the legate served as the provincial governor, while in provinces with multiple legions each legion had a legate and a separate provincial governor who had overall command.

A legate was the principal commander of their assigned legion. The &quot;Legatus legionis&quot; would delegate operational duties to their command staff of Tribunus laticlavius, Praefectus castrorum, Tribunus angusticlavii &amp; Primus pilus who would collectively be responsible for the legion&#x27;s operational effectiveness.

The legate could be distinguished in the field by his elaborate Attic helmet and Lorica musculata or plumata, as well as a scarlet &quot;paludamentum&quot; (cloak), &quot;cincticulus&quot; (a sash tied around the waist) and a &quot;parazonium&quot; (status sword).

The senatorial &quot;legatus legionis&quot; was removed from the Roman army by Gallienus, who preferred to entrust the command of a legionary unit to a leader chosen from within the equestrian order who had a long military career.

The title has other uses from the period of Augustus onwards, following the constitutional resettlement of 27 BC &quot;that senatorial governors in the People&#x27;s provinces bore the republican title of &#x27;proconsul&#x27;, while those appointed by the Emperor bore a title which explicitly referred to their dependence on him, namely &quot;legatus&quot;, or deputy&quot;.

== Diplomatic legates ==
 was also a term for an ambassador of the Roman Republic who was appointed by the Senate for a mission () to a foreign nation, as well as for ambassadors who came to Rome from other countries. The concept remains today as a diplomatic legation.

<doc id="361940" wikidata="Q2243424" url="?curid=361940" title="Idempotent (ring theory)">
<text>In ring theory, a branch of mathematics, an idempotent element or simply idempotent of a ring is an element such that . That is, the element is idempotent under the ring&#x27;s multiplication. Inductively then, one can also conclude that for any positive integer . For example, an idempotent element of a matrix ring is precisely an idempotent matrix.

For general rings, elements idempotent under multiplication are involved in decompositions of modules, and connected to homological properties of the ring. In Boolean algebra, the main objects of study are rings in which all elements are idempotent under both addition and multiplication.

== Examples ==

=== Quotients of Z ===
One may consider the ring of integers modulo, where is square-free. By the Chinese remainder theorem, this ring factors into the product of rings of integers modulo , where is prime. Now each of these factors is a field, so it is clear that the factors&#x27; only idempotents will be and . That is, each factor has two idempotents. So if there are factors, there will be idempotents.

We can check this for the integers , . Since has two prime factors ( and ) it should have idempotents.
: 
: 
: 

From these computations, , , , and are idempotents of this ring, while and are not. This also demonstrates the decomposition properties described below: because , there is a ring decomposition . In the multiplicative identity is and in the multiplicative identity is .

=== Quotient of polynomial ring ===
Given a ring and an element such that , the quotient ring
has the idempotent . For example, this could be applied to , or any polynomial .

=== Idempotents in the ring of split-quaternions ===
There is a circle of idempotents in the ring of split-quaternions. Split quaternions have the structure of a real algebra, so elements can be written &quot;w&quot; + &quot;x&quot;i + &quot;y&quot;j + &quot;z&quot;k over a basis {1, i, j, k}, with j2 = k2 = +1. For any θ, 
:formula_1 satisfies s2 = +1 since j and k satisfy the anticommutative property. Now
:formula_2 the idempotent property.

The element &quot;s&quot; is called a hyperbolic unit and so far, the i-coordinate has been taken as zero. When this coordinate is non-zero, then there is a hyperboloid of one sheet of hyperbolic units in split-quaternions. The same equality shows the idempotent property of formula_3 where &quot;s&quot; is on the hyperboloid.

== Types of ring idempotents ==
A partial list of important types of idempotents includes:
* Two idempotents and are called orthogonal if . If is idempotent in the ring (with unity), then so is ; moreover, and are orthogonal.
* An idempotent in is called a central idempotent if for all in , that is, if is in the center of .
* A trivial idempotent refers to either of the elements and , which are always idempotent.
* A primitive idempotent of a ring is a nonzero idempotent such that is indecomposable as a right -module; that is, such that is not a direct sum of two nonzero submodules. Equivalently, is a primitive idempotent if it cannot be written as , where and are nonzero orthogonal idempotents in .
* A local idempotent is an idempotent such that is a local ring. This implies that is directly indecomposable, so local idempotents are also primitive.
* A right irreducible idempotent is an idempotent for which is a simple module. By Schur&#x27;s lemma, is a division ring, and hence is a local ring, so right (and left) irreducible idempotents are local.
* A centrally primitive idempotent is a central idempotent that cannot be written as the sum of two nonzero orthogonal central idempotents.
* An idempotent in the quotient ring is said to lift modulo if there is an idempotent in such that .
* An idempotent of is called a full idempotent if .
* A separability idempotent; see &quot;Separable algebra&quot;.

Any non-trivial idempotent is a zero divisor (because with neither nor being zero, where ). This shows that integral domains and division rings do not have such idempotents. Local rings also do not have such idempotents, but for a different reason. The only idempotent contained in the Jacobson radical of a ring is .

== Rings characterized by idempotents ==
* A ring in which &quot;all&quot; elements are idempotent is called a Boolean ring. Some authors use the term &quot;idempotent ring&quot; for this type of ring. In such a ring, multiplication is commutative and every element is its own additive inverse.
* A ring is semisimple if and only if every right (or every left) ideal is generated by an idempotent.
* A ring is von Neumann regular if and only if every finitely generated right (or every finitely generated left) ideal is generated by an idempotent.
* A ring for which the annihilator every subset of is generated by an idempotent is called a Baer ring. If the condition only holds for all singleton subsets of , then the ring is a right Rickart ring. Both of these types of rings are interesting even when they lack a multiplicative identity.
* A ring in which all idempotents are central is called an abelian ring. Such rings need not be commutative.
* A ring is directly irreducible if and only if and are the only central idempotents.
* A ring can be written as with each a local idempotent if and only if is a semiperfect ring.
* A ring is called an SBI ring or Lift/rad ring if all idempotents of lift modulo the Jacobson radical.
* A ring satisfies the ascending chain condition on right direct summands if and only if the ring satisfies the descending chain condition on left direct summands if and only if every set of pairwise orthogonal idempotents is finite.
* If is idempotent in the ring , then is again a ring, with multiplicative identity . The ring is often referred to as a corner ring of . The corner ring arises naturally since the ring of endomorphisms .

== Role in decompositions ==
The idempotents of have an important connection to decomposition of -modules. If is an -module and is its ring of endomorphisms, then if and only if there is a unique idempotent in such that and . Clearly then, is directly indecomposable if and only if and are the only idempotents in .

In the case when (assumed unital), the endomorphism ring , where each endomorphism arises as left multiplication by a fixed ring element. With this modification of notation, as right modules if and only if there exists a unique idempotent such that and . Thus every direct summand of is generated by an idempotent.

If is a central idempotent, then the corner ring is a ring with multiplicative identity . Just as idempotents determine the direct decompositions of as a module, the central idempotents of determine the decompositions of as a direct sum of rings. If is the direct sum of the rings , ..., , then the identity elements of the rings are central idempotents in , pairwise orthogonal, and their sum is . Conversely, given central idempotents , ..., in that are pairwise orthogonal and have sum , then is the direct sum of the rings , ..., . So in particular, every central idempotent in gives rise to a decomposition of as a direct sum of the corner rings and . As a result, a ring is directly indecomposable as a ring if and only if the identity is centrally primitive.

Working inductively, one can attempt to decompose into a sum of centrally primitive elements. If is centrally primitive, we are done. If not, it is a sum of central orthogonal idempotents, which in turn are primitive or sums of more central idempotents, and so on. The problem that may occur is that this may continue without end, producing an infinite family of central orthogonal idempotents. The condition &quot; does not contain infinite sets of central orthogonal idempotents&quot; is a type of finiteness condition on the ring. It can be achieved in many ways, such as requiring the ring to be right Noetherian. If a decomposition exists with each a centrally primitive idempotent, then is a direct sum of the corner rings , each of which is ring irreducible.

For associative algebras or Jordan algebras over a field, the Peirce decomposition is a decomposition of an algebra as a sum of eigenspaces of commuting idempotent elements.

== Relation with involutions ==
If is an idempotent of the endomorphism ring , then the endomorphism is an -module involution of . That is, is an -module homomorphism such that is the identity endomorphism of .

An idempotent element of and its associated involution gives rise to two involutions of the module , depending on viewing as a left or right module. If represents an arbitrary element of , can be viewed as a right -module homomorphism so that , or can also be viewed as a left -module homomorphism , where .

This process can be reversed if is an invertible element of : if is an involution, then and are orthogonal idempotents, corresponding to and . Thus for a ring in which is invertible, the idempotent elements correspond to involutions in a one-to-one manner.

== Category of &quot;R&quot;-modules ==
Lifting idempotents also has major consequences for the category of -modules. All idempotents lift modulo if and only if every direct summand of has a projective cover as an -module. Idempotents always lift modulo nil ideals and rings for which is -adically complete.

Lifting is most important when , the Jacobson radical of . Yet another characterization of semiperfect rings is that they are semilocal rings whose idempotents lift modulo .

== Lattice of idempotents ==
One may define a partial order on the idempotents of a ring as follows: if and are idempotents, we write if and only if . With respect to this order, is the smallest and the largest idempotent. For orthogonal idempotents and , is also idempotent, and we have and . The atoms of this partial order are precisely the primitive idempotents.

When the above partial order is restricted to the central idempotents of , a lattice structure, or even a Boolean algebra structure, can be given. For two central idempotents and , the complement is given by
the meet is given by
and the join is given by
The ordering now becomes simply if and only if , and the join and meet satisfy and . It is shown in that if is von Neumann regular and right self-injective, then the lattice is a complete lattice.

<text>The Rongbuk Glacier () is located in the Himalaya of southern Tibet. Two large tributary glaciers, the East Rongbuk Glacier and the West Rongbuk Glacier, flow into the main Rongbuk Glacier. It flows north and forms the Rongbuk Valley north of Mount Everest. The famous Rongbuk Monastery is located at the northern end of the Rongbuk valley. Mount Everest is the source of the Rongbuk Glacier and East Rongbuk Glacier.

==Discovery==

The English climber George Mallory first explored the main Rongbuk Valley and its glacier while searching for possible routes to the summit of Mount Everest, during the first British Everest reconnaissance expedition of 1921.

On the same expedition, Oliver Wheeler first explored the East Rongbuk Glacier. His exploration below the Lhakpa La pass led him on 3 August 1921 to realise that the East Rongbuk Valley provided the key to a viable route to the summit of Everest. A few weeks later, a party consisting of George Mallory, Guy Bullock, and Oliver Wheeler explored the head of the valley via the Lhakpa La pass to become the first people to reach the North Col of Everest and set foot on the slopes of that mountain.

==Location(s)==
==Route to Everest==

Climbing expeditions attempting the normal route from Tibet use this glacier to reach the Advanced Base Camp of Mount Everest at the upper end of the East Rongbuk Glacier. From there, climbing expeditions try to summit Everest by the North Col and the northeast ridge.

==Environmental==

Since 2007, American mountaineer and film-maker David Breashears has been chronicling the rapid disappearance of the Rongbuk glacier due to global climate change. Breashears has retraced the steps of Mallory&#x27;s 1921 expedition, revealing a significant loss of ice mass across the West, Main and East Rongbuk Glaciers. In partnership with Asia Society and MediaStorm, Breashears&#x27; GlacierWorks has made the photos available online. In 80 years, the Rongbuk has shrunk by more than 300 vertical feet across the entire glacier, approximately the height of the Statue of Liberty.

<text>Colonial Williamsburg is a living-history museum and private foundation presenting a part of the historic district in the city of Williamsburg, Virginia. Its historic area includes several hundred restored or recreated buildings from the 18th century, when the city was the capital of the Colony of Virginia; 17th-century, 19th-century, and Colonial Revival structures; and more recent reconstructions. The historic area includes three main thoroughfares and their connecting side streets that attempt to suggest the atmosphere and the circumstances of 18th-century Americans. Costumed employees work and dress as people did in the era, sometimes using colonial grammar and diction.

In the late 1920s, the restoration of colonial Williamsburg was championed as a way to celebrate patriots and the early history of the United States. Proponents included the Reverend Dr. W. A. R. Goodwin and other community leaders; the Association for the Preservation of Virginia Antiquities (now called Preservation Virginia), the Colonial Dames of America, the Daughters of the Confederacy, the Chamber of Commerce, and other organizations; and John D. Rockefeller Jr. and his wife Abby Aldrich Rockefeller.

Along with Jamestown and Yorktown, and the Colonial Parkway, Colonial Williamsburg is part of the Historic Triangle in Virginia, The site was once used for conferences by world leaders and heads of state. In 1960, it was designated a National Historic Landmark District.

==Overview==

The core of Colonial Williamsburg runs along Duke of Gloucester Street and the Palace Green that extends north and south perpendicular to it. This area is largely flat, with ravines and streams branching off on the periphery. Duke of Gloucester Street and other historic area thoroughfares are closed to motorized vehicles during the day, in favor of pedestrians, bicyclists, joggers, dog walkers, and animal-drawn vehicles.

Surviving colonial structures have been restored as close as possible to their 18th-century appearance, with traces removed of later buildings and improvements. Many of the once missing colonial structures were reconstructed on their original sites beginning in the 1930s. Animals, gardens, and dependencies add to the environment, such as kitchens, smokehouses, and privies. Some buildings and most gardens are open to tourists, with the exception of buildings serving as residences for Colonial Williamsburg employees, large donors, the occasional city official, and sometimes College of William &amp; Mary associates.

Prominent buildings include the Raleigh Tavern, the Capitol, the Governor&#x27;s Palace (all reconstructed), the Courthouse, the Wythe House, the Peyton Randolph House, the Magazine, and the independently owned and functioning Bruton Parish Church (all originals). Colonial Williamsburg&#x27;s portion of the historic area begins east of the College of William &amp; Mary&#x27;s College Yard.

Four taverns have been reconstructed for use as restaurants and two for inns. There are craftsmen&#x27;s workshops for period trades, including a printing shop, a shoemaker, a blacksmith, a cooperage, a cabinetmaker, a gunsmith, a wigmaker, and a silversmith. There are merchants selling tourist souvenirs, books, reproduction toys, pewterware, pottery, scented soap, etc. Some houses are open to tourists, including the Peyton Randolph House, the Geddy House, the Wythe House, and the Everard House, as are such public buildings as the Courthouse, the Capitol, the Magazine, the Public Hospital, and the Public Gaol. Former notorious inmates of the Gaol include pirate Blackbeard&#x27;s crew who were kept there while they awaited trial.

Colonial Williamsburg operations extend to Merchants Square, a Colonial Revival commercial area designated a historic district in its own right. Nearby are the Abby Aldrich Rockefeller Folk Art Museum and DeWitt Wallace Decorative Arts Museum, operated by Colonial Williamsburg as part of its curatorial efforts.

==History of Williamsburg==

The Jamestown statehouse housed Virginia&#x27;s government in the 1600s, but it burned on October 20, 1698. The legislators consequently moved their meetings to the College of William &amp; Mary in Virginia at Middle Plantation, putting an end to Jamestown&#x27;s 92-year history as Virginia&#x27;s capital. In 1699, a group of College of William &amp; Mary students delivered addresses during graduation exercises endorsing proposals to move the capital to Middle Plantation, ostensibly to escape the malaria and the mosquitoes at the Jamestown Island site. Interested Middle Plantation landowners donated some of their holdings to advance the plan.

Middle Plantation was renamed Williamsburg by Governor Francis Nicholson in honor of William III of England. Nicholson said that &quot;clear and crystal springs burst from the champagne soil&quot; of Williamsburg. He had the city surveyed and a grid laid out by Theodorick Bland taking into consideration the brick College Building and the then decaying Bruton Parish Church buildings. The grid seems to have obliterated all but the remnants of an earlier plan that laid out the streets in the monogram of William and Mary, a W superimposed on an M. The main street was named Duke of Gloucester after the eldest son of Queen Anne. Nicholson named the street north of it Nicholson Street, for himself, and the one south of it Francis Street.

For 81 years of the 18th century, Williamsburg was the center of government, education, and culture in the Colony of Virginia. George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Patrick Henry, James Monroe, James Madison, George Wythe, Peyton Randolph, Richard Henry Lee, and others furthered the forms of British government in the Commonwealth of Virginia and later helped adapt its preferred features to the needs of the new United States. The government moved to Richmond on the James River in 1780, under the leadership of Governor Thomas Jefferson, to be more central and accessible from western counties and less susceptible to British attack. There it remains today.

==History of Colonial Williamsburg==
With the seat of government removed, Williamsburg&#x27;s businesses floundered or migrated to Richmond, and the city entered a long, slow period of stagnation and decay, although the town maintained much of its 18th-century aspect. It was captured by General George McClellan in 1862 and garrisoned during the Civil War, so the town escaped the devastation experienced by other Southern cities.

Williamsburg relied for jobs on the College of William &amp; Mary, the Courthouse, and the Eastern Lunatic Asylum (now Eastern State Hospital); it was said that the &quot;500 Crazies&quot; of the asylum supported the &quot;500 Lazies&quot; of the college and town. Colonial-era buildings were modified, modernized, neglected, or destroyed. Development that accompanied construction of a World War I gun cotton plant at nearby Penniman and the coming of the automobile blighted the community, but the town kept its appeal to tourists. By the early 20th century, many older structures were in poor condition, no longer in use, or were occupied by squatters.

===Dr. Goodwin and the Rockefellers===
The Reverend Dr. W. A. R. Goodwin became rector of Williamsburg&#x27;s Bruton Parish Church in 1903 for the first of two periods. He was born in 1869 at Richmond to a Confederate veteran and his well-to-do wife and reared in rural Nelson County at Norwood. He was educated at Roanoke College, the University of Virginia, the University of Richmond, and the Virginia Theological Seminary. He first visited Williamsburg as a seminarian sent to recruit William &amp; Mary students. He became rector at age 34 of the Bruton Parish Church that was riven by factions. He helped harmonize the congregation and assumed leadership of a flagging campaign to restore the 1711 church building. Goodwin and New York ecclesiastical architect J. Stewart Barney completed the church restoration in time for the 300th anniversary of the founding of America&#x27;s Anglican Church at nearby Jamestown, Virginia, in 1907. Goodwin traveled the East Coast raising money for the project and establishing philanthropic contacts. Among the 1907 anniversary guests was J. P. Morgan, president of the Episcopal church&#x27;s General Convention meeting that year in Richmond.

Goodwin accepted a call from wealthy St. Paul&#x27;s Episcopal Church in Rochester, New York in 1908, and pastored there until his return in 1923 to Williamsburg to become a College of William &amp; Mary fund-raiser and religious studies professor, as well as pastor of Yorktown&#x27;s Episcopal church and a chapel at Toano. He had maintained his Williamsburg ties, periodically visiting the graves of his first wife and their son, using William &amp; Mary&#x27;s library for historical research, and vacationing. He saw the ongoing deterioration of colonial-era buildings.

He renewed his connections with the Association for the Preservation of Virginia Antiquities, whose membership included prominent and wealthy Virginians, and he helped to protect and repair the Magazine. He and other William &amp; Mary professors saved the John Blair House from demolition to make way for a gasoline station, and they turned it into a faculty club. In 1924, the college launched a building and fund-raising drive, and Goodwin adopted Barney&#x27;s proposal for saving other houses in the historic section of the town for use as student and faculty housing. He worked for two years to interest individuals such as Henry Ford and organizations such as the Dames of Colonial America to invest. He eventually obtained the support and financial commitment of John D. Rockefeller Jr., the wealthy son of the founder of Standard Oil. Rockefeller&#x27;s wife Abby Aldrich Rockefeller also played a role. Goodwin returned to the Bruton Parish pulpit in 1926, keeping his college positions.

Rockefeller&#x27;s first investment in a Williamsburg house had been a contribution to Goodwin&#x27;s acquisition of the George Wythe House for next-door Bruton Church&#x27;s parish house. Rockefeller&#x27;s second investment was the purchase of the Ludwell–Paradise House in early 1927. Goodwin persuaded him to buy it on behalf of the college for housing in the event that Rockefeller should decide to restore the town. Rockefeller had agreed to pay for college restoration plans and drawings. He later considered limiting his restoration involvement to the college and an exhibition enclave, and he did not commit to the town&#x27;s large scale restoration until November 22, 1927.

Rockefeller and Goodwin initially kept their acquisition plans secret because they were concerned that prices might rise if their purposes were known, quietly buying houses and lots and taking deeds in blank. Goodwin took Williamsburg attorney Vernon M. Geddy, Sr. into his confidence, without exposing Rockefeller as silent partner. Geddy did much of the title research and legal work related to properties in what became the restored area. He later drafted the Virginia corporate papers for the project, filed them with the Virginia State Corporation Commission, and served briefly as the first president of the Colonial Williamsburg Foundation.

That much property changing hands was noticed by newspaper reporters. After 18 months of increasingly excited rumors, Goodwin and Rockefeller revealed their plans at county and town meetings on June 11 and 12, 1928. The purpose was to obtain the consent of the citizens and enlist them in the project. The restoration project required a new high school and two public greens. The city retained ownership of its streets, an arrangement that forestalled later proposals to raise revenue by charging an admission fee.

Some townsmen had qualms. Major S. D. Freeman, retired Army officer and school board president, said, &quot;We will reap dollars, but will we own our town? Will you not be in the position of a butterfly pinned to a card in a glass cabinet, or like a mummy unearthed in the tomb of Tutankhamun?&quot; To gain the cooperation of people reluctant to sell their homes to the Rockefeller organization, the restoration offered free life tenancies and maintenance in exchange for ownership. Freeman sold his house outright and moved to Virginia&#x27;s Middle Peninsula.

===Restoration and reconstruction===
Rockefeller management decided against giving custody of the project to the state-run college, ostensibly to avoid political control by Virginia&#x27;s Democratic Byrd Machine, but they restored the school&#x27;s Wren Building, Brafferton House, and President&#x27;s House. Colonial Williamsburg pursued a program of partial re-creation of some of the rest of the town. It featured shops, taverns, and open-air markets in a colonial style.

The first lead architect in the project was William G. Perry of Perry, Shaw &amp; Hepburn, with Arthur Asahel Shurcliff as the chief landscape architect. An Advisory Board of Architects was selected to provide guidance for the project. Prominent architects who served on the advisory board included Robert P. Bellows, Fiske Kimball, A. Lawrence Kocher, Philip N. Stern, Merril C. Lee, W. Duncan Lee, Marcellus E. Wright Sr., Edmund S. Campbell, Orin M. Bullock Jr., and R. E. Lee Taylor.

During the restoration, the project demolished 720 buildings that postdated 1790, many of which dated from the 19th century. Some decrepit 18th-century homes were demolished, leading to some controversy. The Governor&#x27;s Palace and the Capitol building were reconstructed on their sites with the aid of period illustrations, written descriptions, early photographs, and informed guesswork. The grounds and gardens were almost all recreated in authentic Colonial Revival style.

The Capitol is a 1930s beaux arts approximation of the 1705 building at the east end of the historic area. It was designed by the architectural firm Perry, Shaw &amp; Hepburn, who had it rebuilt as they thought it should have been, not as it was, despite objections and archaeological evidence to the contrary. The modern reconstruction is off-center, its floorplan is skewed, and its interior is overly elaborate.

The 1705 original was an H-shaped brick statehouse with double-apsed, oarsmen-circular southern facades, but it burned in the 1740s and was replaced by an H-shaped rectangular edifice.

In the second building, Patrick Henry protested against the Stamp Act and first spoke against King George. George Mason introduced the Virginia Bill of Rights there, and from it Virginia&#x27;s government instructed its delegates to the Second Continental Congress to propose national independence. Its likeness only exists in a period woodcut and in architectural renderings considered but shelved by the Restoration.

The present building was dedicated with a ceremonial meeting of the Virginia General Assembly on February 24, 1934. Virginia&#x27;s state legislators have reassembled for a day every other year in the Capitol.

Of the approximately 500 buildings reconstructed or restored, 88 are labelled original. They include outbuildings such as smokehouses, privies, and sheds. The foundation reconstructed the Capitol and Governor&#x27;s Palace on their 18th-century foundations and preserved some below-ground 18th-century brickwork, classifying them as reconstructions. It rebuilt William &amp; Mary&#x27;s Wren Building on its original foundation, which burned four times in 230 years and was much modified; it saved some above-ground brickwork and classified the result as original.

On the western side of the city, beginning in the 1930s, retail shops were grouped under the name Merchants Square to accommodate and mollify displaced local merchants. Increasing rents and tourist-driven businesses eventually drove out all the old-line community enterprises except a dress shop. One of the last to be forced out was a locally popular drugstore complete with lunch counter.

===Outlying landscapes and viewsheds===
Beginning in the earliest period of the restoration, Colonial Williamsburg acquired acreage in Williamsburg and the two counties which adjoin it, notably to the north and east of the historic area to preserve natural views and facilitate the experience of as much of the late 18th-century environment as possible. This was described as a &quot;rural, wooded sense of arrival&quot; along corridors to the historic area.

In 2006, announcing a conservation easement on acreage north of the Visitor Center, Colonial Williamsburg President and Chairman Colin G. Campbell said its restrictions protected the view and preserved other features: &quot;This viewshed helps to set the stage for visitors in their journey from modern day life into the 18th-century setting. At the same time, this preserves the natural environment around Queen&#x27;s Creek and protects a significant archaeological site. It is a tangible and important example of how the Foundation is protecting the vital greenbelt surrounding Colonial Williamsburg&#x27;s historic area for future generations&quot;. The Colonial Parkway, which includes a tunnel running beneath the historic area, was planned and is maintained to reduce modern intrusions.

Near the principal planned roadway approach to Colonial Williamsburg, similar design priorities were employed for the relocated U.S. Route 60 near the intersection of Bypass Road and North Henry Street. Prior to the restoration, U.S. Route 60 ran down Duke of Gloucester Street through town. To shift the traffic away from the historic area, Bypass Road was planned and built through farmland and woods about a mile north of town. Shortly thereafter, when Route 143 was built as the Merrimack Trail (originally designated State Route 168) in the 1930s, the protected vista was extended along Route 132 in York County to the new road, and two new bridges were built across Queen&#x27;s Creek.

Goodwin, who served as a liaison with the community, as well as with state and local officials, was instrumental in such efforts. Nevertheless, some in the Rockefeller organization, regarding him as meddlesome, gradually pushed Goodwin to the periphery of the Restoration and by the time of his death in 1939 Colonial Williamsburg&#x27;s administrator, Kenneth Chorley of New York, was indiscreetly at loggerheads with the local reverend. Goodwin&#x27;s relationship with Rockefeller remained warm, however, and his interest in the project remained keen. Colonial Williamsburg dedicated its headquarters in 1940, naming it The Goodwin Building.

About 30 years later, when Interstate 64 was planned and built in the 1960s and early 1970s, from the designated &quot;Colonial Williamsburg&quot; exit, the additional land along Merrimack Trail to Route 132 was similarly protected from development. Today, visitors encounter no commercial properties before they reach the Visitor&#x27;s Center.

In addition to considerations regarding highway travel, Williamsburg&#x27;s brick Chesapeake and Ohio Railway passenger station was less than 20 years old and one of the newer ones along the rail line, it was replaced with a larger station in Colonial style that was located just out of sight and within walking distance of the historic area, on the northern edge of Peacock Hill. 

Farther afield was Carter&#x27;s Grove Plantation. It was begun by a grandson of wealthy planter Robert &quot;King&quot; Carter. For over 200 years, it had gone through a succession of owners and modifications. In the 1960s after the death of its last resident, Ms. Molly McRae, Carter&#x27;s Grove Plantation came under the control of Winthrop Rockefeller&#x27;s Sealantic Foundation, which gave it to Colonial Williamsburg as a gift. Archaeologist Ivor Noel Hume discovered in its grounds the remains of 1620s Wolstenholme Towne, a downriver outpost of Jamestown. The Winthrop Rockefeller Archaeology Museum, built just above the site, showcased artifacts from the dig. Colonial Williamsburg operated Carter&#x27;s Grove until 2003 as a satellite facility of Colonial Williamsburg, with interpretive programs. The property has since been sold.

====Kingsmill====
Between Carter&#x27;s Grove and the Historic District was the largely vacant Kingsmill tract, as well as a small military outpost of Fort Eustis known as Camp Wallace (CW). In the mid-1960s, CW owned land that extended from the historic district to Skiffe&#x27;s Creek, at the edge of Newport News near Lee Hall. Distant from the historic area and not along the protected sight paths, it was developed in the early 1970s, under CW Chairman Winthrop Rockefeller.

Rockefeller, a son of Abby and John D. Rockeller Jr., was a frequent visitor and was particularly fond of Carter&#x27;s Grove in the late 1960s. He became aware of some expansion plans elsewhere on the Peninsula of his St. Louis-based neighbor, August Anheuser Busch, Jr., head of Anheuser-Busch. By the time Rockefeller and Busch completed their discussions, the biggest changes in the Williamsburg area were underway since the restoration began 40 years before. Among the goals were to complement Colonial Williamsburg attractions and enhance the local economy.

The large tract consisting primarily of the Kingsmill land was sold by the Colonial Williamsburg Foundation to Anheuser-Busch for planned development. The Anheuser-Busch investment included building a large brewery, the Busch Gardens Williamsburg theme park, the Kingsmill planned resort community, and McLaws Circle, an office park. Anheuser-Busch and related entities from that development plan comprise the area&#x27;s largest employment base, surpassing both Colonial Williamsburg and the local military bases.

===Late 20th century===
With its historic significance to American democracy, it and the surrounding area was the site of a summit meeting of world leaders, the first World Economic Conference in 1983, and hosted visiting royalty, including King Hussein of Jordan and Emperor Hirohito of Japan. Queen Elizabeth II paid two royal visits to Williamsburg during her reign, once in October 1957 and again, in May 2007, both to celebrate the anniversaries of the founding of nearby Jamestown.

==Colonial Williamsburg today==
Colonial Williamsburg is an open-air assemblage of buildings populated with historical reenactors (interpreters) who explain and demonstrate aspects of daily life in the past. The reenactors work, dress, and talk as they would have in colonial times.

While there are many living history museums (such as Old Sturbridge Village in Massachusetts, Old Salem in Winston-Salem, or Castell Henllys in the UK), Colonial Williamsburg is unusual for having been constructed from a living town whose inhabitants and post-Colonial-era buildings were removed. Also unlike other living history museums, Colonial Williamsburg allows anyone to walk through the historic district free of charge, at any hour of the day. Charges apply only to those visitors who wish to enter the historic buildings to see arts and crafts demonstrations during daylight hours, or attend scheduled outdoor performances such as the &quot;Revolutionary City&quot; programs.

The Visitor Center near the Colonial Parkway features a short film, &quot;&quot;, which debuted in 1957. Visitors may park at the Visitor&#x27;s Center, as automobiles are restricted from the restored area. Wheelchair-accessible shuttle bus service is provided to stops around the perimeter of the Historic District of Williamsburg, as well as Jamestown and Yorktown, during the peak summer season.

The costumed interpreters have not always worn Colonial dress. As an experiment in anticipation of the Bicentennial, in summer 1973 the hostesses were dressed in special red, white, and blue polyester knit pantsuits. This confused and disappointed visitors, so the experiment was dropped at the end of summer, and for the Bicentennial, docents wore historical costumes.

Many reenactments by Colonial Williamsburg&#x27;s historical interpreters wearing period costumes are posted online. In addition to simple period reenactments, Colonial Williamsburg, at various times, features themes, including the founding of Williamsburg, occupation by British forces, or visits from Colonial leaders of the day, including General George Washington.

Some of the costumed interpreters work with animals. The Colonial Williamsburg Rare Breed Program helps to preserve and showcase animals that would have been present during the colonial period. John P. Hunter&#x27;s book on the topic, &quot;Link to the Past, Bridge to the Future: Colonial Williamsburg&#x27;s Animals&quot;, explains the importance of, as well as details how interpreters are a part, of this program.

Colonial Williamsburg is a partly pet-friendly destination. Leashed pets are permitted in specific outdoor areas and may be taken on shuttle buses, but are not permitted in buildings except the visitor center.

===Grand Illumination===

The Grand Illumination is an outdoor ceremony and mass celebration involving the simultaneous activation of thousands of Christmas lights each year on the first Sunday of December. The ceremony, Goodwin&#x27;s idea, began in 1935, loosely based on a colonial (and English) tradition of placing lighted candles in the windows of homes and public buildings to celebrate a special event, such as the winning of a war or the birthday of the reigning monarch. The Grand Illumination also has incorporated extravagant fireworks displays, loosely based on the 18th-century practice of using fireworks to celebrate significant occasions.

===Educational outreach===
In the 1990s, Colonial Williamsburg implemented the Teaching Institute in Early American History, and Electronic Field Trips. Designed for elementary and middle/high school teachers, the institute offers workshops for educators to meet with historians, character interpreters, and to prepare instructional materials for use in the classroom. Electronic Field Trips are a series of multimedia classroom presentations available to schools. Each program is designed around a particular topic in history and includes a lesson plan as well as classroom and online activities. Monthly live broadcasts on local PBS television stations allow participating classes to interact with historical interpreters via telephone or internet.

In 2007, Colonial Williamsburg launched iCitizenForum.com. A mix of historical documents and user-generated content such as blogs, videos, and message boards, the site aims to prompt discussion about the roles, rights, and responsibilities of citizens in a democracy. Preservation of the Founding Fathers&#x27; ideals in light of recent world events is a focus of the site.

Colonial Williamsburg hired former NBC journalist Lloyd Dobyns to produce the early podcasts for the museum usually interviewing staff about their specialties. Podcast interviews continued by others after his retirement.

===John D. Rockefeller Jr. Library===
The John D. Rockefeller Jr. Library is considered the &quot;intellectual center of the Colonial Williamsburg Foundation.&quot; The library houses special collections including:
* Rare books from the 15th to 20th centuries
* Original manuscripts from the 17th to 20th centuries
* 18th-century British and American newspapers
* Reproduction maps of the Williamsburg region
* Reproductions of manuscripts from the 17th to 19th centuries in a variety of formats.

The library also has a visual resources collection, Colonial Williamsburg Foundation corporate archives, media collections, and photo reproduction and licensing services. The library publishes a quarterly newsletter in digital format, as well as a podcast.

===Merchandising===
Colonial American craft items, some manufactured abroad, are sold in historic area stores. Many shops sell such items as floral and herbal soaps, knitted hats, and handcrafted toys made from wood and clay.

==Management==
Colonial Williamsburg is owned and operated as a living museum by the Colonial Williamsburg Foundation, the non-profit entity endowed initially by the Rockefeller family and over the years by others, notably &quot;Reader&#x27;s Digest&quot; founders Lila and DeWitt Wallace, and Philadelphia publisher Walter Annenberg.

The major goal of the restoration was to re-create the physical colonial environment and to facilitate education about the origins of the idea of America, which was conceived during the decades before the American Revolution. In this environment, Colonial Williamsburg strives to tell the story of how diverse peoples, having different and sometimes conflicting ambitions, evolved into a society that valued liberty and equality.

Cliff Fleet, former President of the Jamestown-Yorktown Foundation, was appointed president and CEO of The Colonial Williamsburg Foundation in 2019. Mitchell Reiss, former President of Washington College, was the Foundation&#x27;s president and CEO from 2014 to 2019. Reiss succeeded Colin G. Campbell, who held the position for 14 years. Thomas F. Farrell II was Chair of the Colonial Williamsburg Foundation&#x27;s Board of Trustees from 2011 to 2016 and served on the Board from 2006 to 2018.

===Attendance===
Attendance at Colonial Williamsburg peaked in 1985 at 1.1 million visitors. After years of lower attendance, it began to rebound somewhat with the Jamestown 2007 celebration and the &quot;Revolutionary City&quot; programs of live, interactive street theater between reenactors and audience members, which began in 2006.

Since its lowest point in 2004, total attendance has climbed about 10 percent total over the following years, according to a report in July 2008. During 2008, CW&#x27;s hospitality revenue increase of 15 percent was much stronger than the ticket sale gain of 5 percent, reflecting how the hospitality revenue is not always coming from CW historic area tourists, according to an official.

===Financial challenges===
Persistent operating deficits challenge the Colonial Williamsburg Foundation. Income comes from attendance and merchandising, but is lost at hospitality properties. Other funds come from investments of the endowments and a fundraising operation that occupies half of the foundation&#x27;s four-story headquarters. Financially focused efforts in recent years have primarily concentrated on cost containment and stimulating attendance and hospitality revenues. The foundation has also sold some property assets that were no longer essential to its core mission, including most of its formerly owned properties on nearby Peacock Hill, which has the local distinction of having formerly been home to Georgia O&#x27;Keeffe, Mayor Polly Stryker, and Dr. Donald W. Davis, founder of the Virginia Institute of Marine Science.

In 2017, due to losses, Colonial Williamsburg former President Mitchell Reis outsourced management of commercial operations of their hotels, 19 retail stores, and three golf courses.

====Land divestment====
In 2003, as CW attendance and operating revenues continued to drop, Carter&#x27;s Grove was closed to the public while its mission and role in CW&#x27;s programs were redefined. After the sale, officials belatedly determined Carters Grove was paying for itself, one of the bright spots in its troubled balance sheet. Later in 2003, Hurricane Isabel seriously damaged Carter&#x27;s Grove Country Road, which had linked the estate to the historic area, a distance of , bypassing commercial and public roadways. Colonial Williamsburg shifted some of the interpretive programs to locations contiguous to the historic area in Williamsburg, including the ersatz farm Great Hopes Plantation next to its Visitor Center.

The foundation announced in late 2006 that Carter&#x27;s Grove would be sold under restrictive conditions. In a front-page article December 31, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that the foundation, struggling because of dwindling attendance and insufficient endowment for upkeep, would be offering the Carter&#x27;s Grove mansion and grounds for sale to a private purchaser, possibly as soon as January 2007. The foundation justified the sale, in part, by saying it wanted to concentrate on its 18th-century core—as opposed to such attractions as the reconstruction of a 17th-century village on the site—a position at odds with its later, and subsequently undone, decision to assume management of 17th-century historic Jamestowne. &quot;The Times&quot; said that the dilemma of historic museums and houses is that there are too many of them, upkeep is too expensive, and fewer people are visiting them.

In December 2007, the Georgian-style mansion and were acquired for $15.3 million by CNET founder Halsey Minor, whose announced plans to use the property as a private residence and a center for a Thoroughbred horse breeding program. The conservation easement on the mansion and 400 of the is co-held by the Virginia Outdoors Foundation and the Virginia Department of Historic Resources. Some local residents lamented CW&#x27;s decision to sell Carter&#x27;s Grove; others stated relief that it would remain largely intact, no small matter in one of the fastest developing counties in Virginia. There was general agreement, however, that the transaction was a disaster for the foundation&#x27;s management and reputation. In 2011, Halsey Minor stopped making payments, and was foreclosed on by CW after a lengthy legal battle and some deterioration of the house and grounds. In 2014, CW repurchased Carter&#x27;s Grove from the bankruptcy court, and sold it to a new private investor.

In addition to the large sale of surplus land of the old Kingsmill plantation to Anheuser Busch in the 1970s and the more recent sale of Carter&#x27;s Grove, the foundation has also sold outlying tracts of land not considered fundamental to its mission, as well as multiple now-privately owned homes in Peacock Hill.

One of these is a tract along historic Quarterpath Road north of State Route 199 and south of U.S. Route 60 east of the historic area. In 2005, it was the City of Williamsburg&#x27;s largest undeveloped tract under single ownership&quot;. Observers have noted that, while most of the Quarterpath land will be developed, the previously vacant land will include park and recreational facilities, and Redoubt Park, dedicated to preserving some of the battlegrounds from the Battle of Williamsburg that occurred on May 5, 1862, during the Peninsula Campaign of the American Civil War.

A portion of the Carr&#x27;s Hill Tract in York County, north and west of Bypass Road and State Route 132, was also sold. Developments thereon were restricted under the terms of sale so as to not negatively impact the vista available to motorists approaching Colonial Williamsburg. In February, 2007, a developer announced that 313 homes were planned to be built on of the historic tract&#x27;s , but these plans were scrapped due to the Great Recession&#x27;s impact on the greater town economy. CW had earlier announced that it had donated three conservation easements to the Williamsburg Land Conservancy on of the Carr&#x27;s Hill tract land west of Route 132 in York County.

==Transportation==
The closest commercial airport is Newport News/Williamsburg International Airport 25–30 minutes driving distance away. Williamsburg is midway between two larger commercial airports, Richmond International Airport and Norfolk International Airport, each about an hour&#x27;s distance away.

Amtrak offers a passenger rail service stop at Williamsburg, as does Greyhound and Carolina Trailways with intercity buses.

Williamsburg is adjacent to east–west Interstate 64 and the parallel U.S. Route 60 passes through the city. A third road, State Route 143, also extends east to Newport News and Hampton, ending at Fort Monroe. From Richmond, Interstate 295, and other points west, many visitors approach via State Route 5, a scenic byway which passes many of the James River Plantations, or from the south via State Route 10, State Route 31 and the Jamestown Ferry. The Virginia Capital Trail is available for bicycles and pedestrians along the Colonial Parkway and Virginia Route5.

Williamsburg is served by non-automobile driving alternatives. The area has a central intermodal transportation center and Williamsburg Area Transit Authority (WATA), a public transit bus system which operates a network of local routes.

==Criticism and controversy==

===The 1920s and 1930s===
Some residents of Williamsburg, including Major S. D. Freeman and Cara Armistead, questioned the 1928 transfer of public lands (as compared to private properties). In January 1932, the large marble Confederate Civil War monument was removed from Palace Green, where it had stood since 1908, and placed in the Cedar Grove Cemetery, on the outskirts of town. This was disagreeable to some citizens who supported the colonial reconstruction. The case went to court, and eventually the monument was moved to a new site east of the then-new courthouse. For many years, the memorial rested in Bicentennial Park, just outside the Historic Area. In July 2020 the city council voted unanimously to remove it, and it was returned to the United Daughters of the Confederacy in August 2020.

===Issues of &quot;accuracy&quot; and &quot;authenticity&quot;===
The approach to restoration and preservation taken by the Colonial Williamsburg Foundation has long been subject to criticism.

Goodwin was troubled by what he perceived as encroaching commercialization. Among his parting words of advice to Colonial Williamsburg&#x27;s management were: &quot;If there is one firm guiding and restraining word which should be passed on to those who will be responsible for the restoration in the future, that one word is integrity. A departure from truth here and there will inevitably produce a cumulative deterioration of authenticity and consequent loss of public confidence. Loyalty demands that this principle of integrity be adhered to&quot;.

One of the foundation&#x27;s in-house publications concedes that &quot;Colonial Williamsburg bears the burden of criticism that the restored town appears too neat and clean, too &#x27;spick-and-span&#x27;, and too manicured to be believable&quot;. Ada Louise Huxtable, an architecture critic, wrote in 1965: &quot;Williamsburg is an extraordinary, conscientious and expensive exercise in historical playacting in which real and imitation treasures and modern copies are carelessly confused in everyone&#x27;s mind. Partly because it is so well done, the end effect has been to devalue authenticity and denigrate the genuine heritage of less picturesque periods to which an era and a people gave life&quot;.

All of the restored houses were improved with electricity, plumbing, and heating by 19th- and 20th-century residents and later by Colonial Williamsburg. They have also been furnished with stoves, air conditioners, refrigerators, and bathrooms by today&#x27;s residents or the foundation. Plaster, woodwork, flooring, siding and roofs were replaced.

In 1997, anthropologists Eric Gable and Richard Handler discussed Colonial Williamsburg as an attraction which catered to America&#x27;s upper/middle to high-level affluent socioeconomic classes. Their report mentions instances where some of Colonial Williamsburg&#x27;s employees often straddle expectations of maintaining authenticity of the museum&#x27;s programs while still in-authentically creating products to sell in the museum&#x27;s gift shops. A more harsh interpretation is that of University of Virginia Professor of Architectural History Richard Guy Wilson, author of &quot;Buildings of Virginia: Tidewater and Piedmont&quot;, who described Colonial Williamsburg as &quot;a superb example of an American suburb of the 1930s, with its in-authentically tree-lined streets of Colonial Revival houses and segregated commerce&quot;. All of these reproaches have led many critics to label Colonial Williamsburg and its Foundation a &quot;Republican Disneyland&quot;.

Among the answers to these criticisms is that &quot;Colonial Williamsburg&#x27;s Historic Area is a compromise between historical authenticity and common sense, between brutal realism and gentle ambiance, between being a moment in time in the eighteenth century and being nearly three hundred years old&quot;. Critics assert that setting &quot;historical authenticity&quot; against &quot;common sense&quot; is a false dichotomy and that commercial and proprietary factors are what are really at issue. Of course archaeological and historical research is an ongoing process at Colonial Williamsburg, and as new information surfaces, reconsideration is often prompted and changes made accordingly.

In March 2016, the foundation&#x27;s new president and chief executive officer, Mitchell Reiss, told the &quot;Richmond Times-Dispatch&quot; that Colonial Williamsburg aimed to be &quot;accurate-ish.&quot;

===African Americans===
Colonial Williamsburg has been criticized for neglecting the role of free African Americans in colonial life, in addition to those who were slaves. When it first opened in the 1930s, Colonial Williamsburg had segregated dormitories for its reenactors. African Americans filled historical roles as servants, rather than free people as in the present day. In a segregated state, Colonial Williamsburg allowed the entry of Blacks, but Williamsburg-area hotels denied them accommodation, and state law forbade Black people from eating with white people in such public facilities as the restored taverns and from shopping in nearby stores.

Colonial Williamsburg offered some of the earlier public accommodations on an integrated basis. In the 1970s, in reaction to increasing scorn of its one-sided portrayal of colonial life, Colonial Williamsburg increased its number of African American interpreters who played slaves. This was parodied by a sketch that aired on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, which showed a reenactor abusing his accuracy by being racist to employees. In 1994, it added slave auctions and slave marriages; the NAACP and the Southern Christian Leadership Conference later protested. One controversial example was the “Publick Times” program, a reenactment of a slave auction staged in October 1994. The event was widely publicized by news outlets such as &quot;The Baltimore Sun&quot;, &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;, and &quot;The New York Times&quot;. While some members of the public applauded the reenactment as a reflection of the reality of slavery in the American colonies, others criticized the program for using a slave auction as a source of entertainment.

In 1981, Colonial Williamsburg added a program to explain slavery and its role in Colonial America, but this &quot;Other Half Tour,&quot; which is composed by the Foundation&#x27;s African American and Interpretation Programs Department (AAIP), provides a different form of historical interpretation than does its counterpart tour, &quot;The Patriots&#x27; Tour,&quot; thus creating a marked dichotomy between how visitors are expected to interpret history at the museum.

In recent years, Colonial Williamsburg has expanded its portrayal of 18th-century African Americans to include free Blacks as well as slaves. Examples of these expanded portrayals in the &quot;Revolutionary City&quot; program include Gowan Pamphlet, a former slave who became a free landowner and Baptist minister, Edith Cumbo, a free Black woman, Matthew Ashby, a free Black man who eventually purchased the freedom of his family, and a number of other enslaved men and women who were part of the Williamsburg community during the Revolutionary period. A re-created Great Hopes Plantation represents a middling plantation, not one owned by the wealthy, in which working-class farmers worked alongside their slaves. Their lives were more typical of colonial Virginians in general than the lives of the wealthier planters, their families, and slaves.

<doc id="361950" wikidata="Q2582530" url="?curid=361950" title="Network Control Protocol (ARPANET)">
<text>The Network Control Protocol (NCP) was a communication protocol for a computer network in the 1970s and early 1980s. It provided the transport layer of the protocol stack running on host computers of the ARPANET, the predecessor to the modern Internet.

NCP preceded the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) as a transport layer protocol used during the early ARPANET. NCP was a simplex protocol that utilized two port numbers, establishing two connections for two-way communications. An odd and an even port were reserved for each application layer application or protocol. The standardization of TCP and UDP reduced the need for the use of two simplex ports per application to one duplex port.

There is some confusion over the name, even among the engineers who worked with the ARPANET. Originally, there was no need for a name for the protocol stack as a whole, so none existed. When the development of TCP started, a name was required for its predecessor, and the pre-existing acronym &#x27;NCP&#x27; (which originally referred to Network Control Program, the software that implemented this stack) was organically adopted for that use. Eventually, it was realized that the original expansion of that acronym was inappropriate for its new meaning, so a new quasi-backronym was created, &#x27;Network Control Protocol&#x27; — again, organically, not via a formal decision.

==History==
On the ARPANET, the protocols in the physical layer, the data link layer, and the network layer used within the network were implemented on separate Interface Message Processors (IMPs). The host usually connected to an IMP using another kind of interface, with different physical, data link, and network layer specifications. The IMP&#x27;s capabilities were specified by the Host/IMP Protocol in BBN Report 1822, which was written by Bob Kahn. 

Under the auspices of Leonard Kleinrock at University of California Los Angeles (UCLA), Stephen D. Crocker, then a graduate student in computer science at UCLA, formed and led the Network Working Group (NWG). Working with Jon Postel and others, they designed a host-to-host protocol, known as the Network Control Program, which was developed in the ARPANET&#x27;s earliest RFC documents in 1969 after a series of meetings on the topic with engineers from UCLA, University of Utah, and SRI. Crocker said &quot;While much of the development proceeded according to a grand plan, the design of the protocols and the creation of the RFCs was largely accidental.&quot; After approval by Barry Wessler at ARPA, who had ordered certain more exotic elements to be dropped, it was finalized in in early 1970, and deployed to all nodes on the ARPANET in December 1970.

NCP codified the ARPANET network interface, making it easier to establish, and enabling more sites to join the network. It provided connections and flow control between processes running on different ARPANET host computers. Application services, such as remote login and file transfer, would be built on top of NCP, using it to handle connections to other host computers. Other participants in the NWG developed these application-level protocols, TELNET and FTP.

Since lower protocol layers were provided by the IMP-host interface, NCP essentially provided a transport layer consisting of the &quot;ARPANET Host-to-Host Protocol&quot; (AHHP) and the &quot;Initial Connection Protocol&quot; (ICP). AHHP defined procedures to transmit a unidirectional, flow-controlled data stream between two hosts. The ICP defined the procedure for establishing a bidirectional pair of such streams between a pair of host processes. Application protocols (e.g., FTP) accessed network services through an interface to the top layer of NCP — a forerunner to the Berkeley sockets interface.

==Network Control Program==
Network Control Program (usually given as NCP) was the name for the software on hosts which implemented the Network Control Protocol of the ARPANET.

It was almost universally referred to by the acronym, NCP. This was later taken over to refer to the protocol suite itself.

NCPs were written for many operating systems, including Multics, TENEX, UNIX and TOPS-10, and some of those NCPs survive (although of course they are now used by only vintage computer enthusiasts).

==Transition to TCP/IP==
Implementation of TCP/IP began in the late 1970s. 
Widespread deployment across the Arpanet began in earnest in 1981, and on several days toward the end of 1982 the backbone routers disabled NCP traffic for most hosts to test the network&#x27;s readiness for the transition.

On January 1, 1983, in what is known as a &quot;flag day&quot;, NCP was officially rendered obsolete when the ARPANET changed its core networking protocols from NCP to the more flexible and powerful TCP/IP protocol suite, marking the start of the modern Internet.

Despite the &quot;mandatory&quot; flag-day transition, a number of sites continued use of NCP into mid-1983, but these were special cases that required permission from the backbone operators, and all hosts were eventually switched to TCP/IP or removed.

<doc id="361953" wikidata="Q1429140" url="?curid=361953" title="Folk psychology">
<text>Folk psychology, commonsense psychology, or naïve psychology is the ordinary, intuitive, or non-expert understanding, explanation, and rationalization of people&#x27;s behaviors and mental states. In philosophy of mind and cognitive science, it can also refer to the academic study of this concept. Processes and items encountered in daily life such as pain, pleasure, excitement, and anxiety use common linguistic terms as opposed to technical or scientific jargon. Folk psychology allows for an insight into social interactions and communication, thus stretching the importance of connection and how it is experienced.

Traditionally, the study of folk psychology has focused on how everyday people—those without formal training in the various academic fields of science—go about attributing mental states. This domain has primarily been centered on intentional states reflective of an individual&#x27;s beliefs and desires; each described in terms of everyday language and concepts such as &quot;beliefs&quot;, &quot;desires&quot;, &quot;fear&quot;, and &quot;hope&quot;.

Belief and desire have been the main idea of folk psychology as both suggest the mental states we partake in. Belief comes from the mindset of how we take the world to be while desire comes from how we want the world to be. From both of these mindsets, our intensity of predicting others mental states can have different results.

Folk psychology is seen by many psychologists from two perspectives: the intentional stance or the regulative view. The regulative view of folk psychology insists that a person&#x27;s behavior is more geared to acting towards the societal norms whereas the intentional stance makes a person behave based on the circumstances of how they are supposed to behave.

==Key folk concepts==
===Intentionality===
When perceiving, explaining, or criticizing human behaviour, people distinguish between intentional and unintentional actions. An evaluation of an action as stemming from purposeful action or accidental circumstances is one of the key determinants in social interaction. Others are the environmental conditions or pre-cognitive matters. For example, a critical remark that is judged to be intentional on the part of the receiver of the message can be viewed as a hurtful insult. Conversely, if considered unintentional, the same remark may be dismissed and forgiven.

The folk concept of intentionality is used in the legal system to distinguish between intentional and unintentional behavior. When looking at an individual, there is an unconventional way of explaining behavior in law. By looking at behaviors and expressions, folk psychology is used to predict behaviors that have been acted out in the past. 

The importance of this concept transcends almost all aspects of everyday life: with empirical studies in social and developmental psychology exploring perceived intentionality&#x27;s role as a mediator for aggression, relationship conflict, judgements of responsibility blame or punishment.

Recent empirical literature on folk psychology has shown that people&#x27;s theories regarding intentional actions involve four distinct factors: beliefs, desires, causal histories, and enabling factors. Here, beliefs and desires represent the central variables responsible for the folk theories of intention.

Desires embody outcomes that an individual seeks, including those that are impossible to achieve. The key difference between desires and intentions is that desires can be purely hypothetical, whereas intentions specify an outcome that the individual is actually trying to bring to fruition.

In terms of beliefs, there are several types that are relevant to intentions—outcome beliefs and ability beliefs. Outcome beliefs are beliefs as to whether a given action will fulfill an intention, as in &quot;purchasing a new watch will impress my friends&quot;. Ability consists of an actor&#x27;s conviction regarding his or her ability to perform an action, as in &quot;I really can afford the new watch&quot;. In light of this, Heider postulated that ability beliefs could be attributed with causing individuals to form goals that would not otherwise have been entertained.

=== Regulative ===
The regulative view of folk psychology is not the same of the intentional stance of folk psychology. This point of view is primarily concerned with the norms and patterns that correspond with our behavior and applying them in social situations. Our thoughts and behaviors are often shaped by folk psychology into the normative molds that help others predict and comprehend us.

According to the regulative point of view, social roles, cultural norms, generalizations, and stereotypes are grounded on social and developmental psychology&#x27;s empirical data, which is what normative structures allude to. Based on how someone displays themselves, things like how you treat babies differently from adults and boys differently from girls might foretell how people will behave or react. According to this regulative perspective, folk psychology fulfills a &quot;curiosity state&quot; and a satisfactory answer satisfies the needs of the inquirer.

Moral character judgements play a significant role in comprehending folk psychology from a regulative perspective. Three categories of moral character traits are assigned: virtue-labeling, narrative-based moral assessment, as well as gossiping about traits and they use different approaches to social cognition. Although character judgement is a component in folk psychology, it does not take into consideration other processes that we engage in on the daily basis.

===Comprehension and prediction===
====Context model====
Folk psychology is crucial to evaluating and ultimately understanding novel concepts and items. Developed by Medin, Altom, and Murphy, the Context Model hypothesizes that as a result of mental models in the form of prototype and exemplar representations, individuals are able to more accurately represent and comprehend the environment around them.

According to the model, the overall similarity between the prototype and a given instance of a category is evaluated based on multiple dimensions (e.g., shape, size, color). A multiplicative function modeled after this phenomenon was created.

:formula_1

Here, formula_2 represents the similarity between the prototype and the formula_3th exemplar, formula_4 is the subscript for the dimensions formula_5, and formula_6 is the similarity between the prototype and the formula_3th exemplar on the formula_4th dimension.

==== Prediction model ====
There are other prediction models when it comes to the different cognitive thoughts an individual might have when trying to predict human behavior or human mental states. From Lewis, one platitude includes individuals casually expressing stimuli and behavior. The other platitude includes assuming a type of mental state another has. 

==== Consequence of prediction model ====
The prediction model has received some cautions as the idea of folk psychology has been a part of Lewis&#x27;s ideas. Common statements about mental health have been considered in Lewis&#x27;s prediction model, therefore there was an assumed lack of quality scientific research.

===Explanation===
====Conversational Model====
Given that folk psychology represents causal knowledge associated with the mind&#x27;s categorization processes, it follows that folk psychology is actively employed in aiding the explanation of everyday actions. Denis Hilton&#x27;s (1990) Conversational Model was created with this causal explanation in mind, with the model having the ability to generate specific predictions. Hilton coined his model the &#x27;conversational&#x27; model because he argued that as a social activity, unlike prediction, explanation requires an audience: to whom the individual explains the event or action. According to the model, causal explanations follow two particular conversational maxims from Grice&#x27;s (1975) models of conversation—the manner maxim and the quantity maxim. Grice indicated that the content of a conversation should be relevant, informative, and fitting of the audience&#x27;s gap in knowledge. Cognizant of this, the Conversational Model indicates that the explainer, upon evaluation of his audience, will modify his explanation to cater their needs. In essence, demonstrating the inherent need for mental comparison and in subsequent modification of behaviour in everyday explanations.

==Application and functioning==

===Belief–desire model===
The belief–desire model of psychology illustrates one method in which folk psychology is utilized in everyday life. According to this model, people perform an action if they want an outcome and believe that it can be obtained by performing the action. However, beliefs and desires are not responsible for immediate action; intention acts as a mediator of belief/desire and action. In other words, consider a person who wants to achieve a goal, &quot;G&quot;, and believes action &quot;A&quot; will aid in attaining &quot;G&quot;; this leads to an intention to perform &quot;A&quot;, which is then carried out to produce action &quot;A&quot;. 

Schank &amp; Abelson (1977) described this inclusion of typical beliefs, desires, and intentions underlying an action as akin to a &quot;script&quot; whereby an individual is merely following an unconscious framework that leads to the ultimate decision of whether an action will be performed. Similarly, Barsalou (1985) described the category of the mind as an &quot;ideal&quot; whereby if a desire, a belief, and an intention were all present, they would &quot;rationally&quot; lead to a given action. They coined this phenomenon the &quot;ideal of rational action&quot;.

===Goal-intentional action model===
Existing literature has widely corroborated the fact that social behavior is greatly affected by the causes to which people attribute actions. In particular, it has been shown that an individual&#x27;s interpretation of the causes of behavior reflects their pre-existing beliefs regarding the actor&#x27;s mental state and motivation behind his or her actions. It follows that they draw on the assumed intentions of actors to guide their own responses to punish or reward the actor. This concept is extended to cover instances in which behavioral evidence is lacking. Under these circumstances, it has been shown that the individual will again draw on assumed intentions in order to predict the actions of the third party.

Although the two components are often used interchangeably in common parlance, there is an important distinction between the goals and intentions. This discrepancy lies in the fact that individuals with an intention to perform an action also foster the belief that it will be achieved, whereas the same person with a goal may not necessarily believe that the action is able to be performed in spite of having a strong desire to do so.

Predicting goals and actions, much like the Belief-Desire Model, involves moderating variables that determine whether an action will be performed. In the Goal-Intentional Action Model, the predictors of goals and actions are: the actors&#x27; beliefs about his or her abilities and their actual possession of preconditions required to carry out the action. Additionally, preconditions consist of the various conditions necessary in order for realization of intentions. This includes abilities and skills in addition to environmental variables that may come into play. Schank &amp; Abelson raises the example of going to a restaurant, where the preconditions include the ability to afford the bill and get to the correct venue, in addition to the fact that the restaurant must be open for business. Traditionally, people prefer to allude to preconditions to explain actions that have a high probability of being unattainable, whereas goals tend to be described as a wide range of common actions.

===Model of everyday inferences===
Models of everyday inferences capture folk psychology of human informal reasoning. Many models of this nature have been developed. They express and refine our folk psychological ways of understanding of how one makes inferences.

For example, one model describes human everyday reasoning as combinations of simple, direct rules and similarity-based processes. From the interaction of these simple mechanisms, seemingly complex patterns of reasoning emerge. The model has been used to account for a variety of reasoning data.

==Controversy==
Folk psychology remains the subject of much contention in academic circles with respect to its scope, method and the significance of its contributions to the scientific community. A large part of this criticism stems from the prevailing impression that folk psychology is a primitive practice reserved for the uneducated and non-academics in discussing their everyday lives.

There is significant debate over whether folk psychology is useful for academic purposes; specifically, whether it can be relevant with regard to the scientific psychology domain. It has been argued that a mechanism used for laypeople&#x27;s understanding, predicting, and explaining each other&#x27;s actions is inapplicable with regards to the requirements of the scientific method. Conversely, opponents have called for patience, seeing the mechanism employed by laypeople for understanding each other&#x27;s actions as important in their formation of bases for future action when encountering similar situations. Malle &amp; Knobe hailed this systematization of people&#x27;s everyday understanding of the mind as an inevitable progression towards a more comprehensive field of psychology. Medin et al. provide another advantage of conceptualizing folk psychology with their Mixture Model of Categorization: it is advantageous as it helps predict action.

<text>Rideau Hall is a Canadian television series broadcast in 2002 on CBC Television.

The show starred Bette MacDonald as Regina Gallant, an earthy, one-hit wonder disco queen who is recommended for appointment as Governor General by a conniving Prime Minister who anticipates that she will become a national embarrassment in the job, allowing him to move ahead in eliminating the position, along with the Canadian monarchy. Regina is brash and loud and highly unsuitable for a formal position, but has a charming common touch.

Each episode has her becoming embroiled in one scandal or another, usually not of her making, only to have things resolve in her favour by the end. Fiona Reid plays her prim and proper executive assistant Eleanor Sharpe, Jonathan Torrens plays her flakey gay press secretary Daniel Van Dusen, and Joe Dinicol plays her laconic, level-headed son Jason. Rejean Cournoyer plays the Prime Minister&#x27;s aide who is the primary liaison between Rideau Hall and the Prime Minister&#x27;s office; Barry Flatman played the prime minister in the pilot, but did not appear in the regular series.

Six half-hour episodes plus an hour-long pilot were produced. The show was not renewed for a second season.

<text>Chimborazo () is a stratovolcano situated in Ecuador in the Cordillera Occidental range of the Andes. Its last known eruption is believed to have occurred around AD 550. Although not the tallest mountain in the Andes or on Earth relative to sea level, its summit is the farthest point on Earth&#x27;s surface from the Earth&#x27;s center due to its location along the planet&#x27;s equatorial bulge. Chimborazo&#x27;s height from sea level is 6,263 m (20,548 ft), well below that of Mount Everest at 8,849 m (29,031 ft).

Chimborazo is the highest mountain in Ecuador and the 39th-highest peak in the entire Andes. It is a popular destination for mountaineering due to its challenging climbing routes, which involve traversing snow, ice, and rocky terrain.

==Etymology==
Several theories regarding the origin of the name Chimborazo exist. In many dialects of Quechua, &quot;chimba&quot; means &quot;on the other side&quot; as in &quot;on the other side of the river&quot; or &quot;on the opposite bank&quot;. Other dialects pronounce this word &quot;chimpa&quot;. Also, &quot;razu&quot; means &quot;ice&quot; or &quot;snow&quot;. Local Quichua speakers say that Chimborazo is a Hispanicized pronunciation of &quot;chimbarazu&quot;, meaning &quot;the snow on the other side&quot;. Another theory suggests it is a combination of the Cayapa &quot;Schingbu&quot; for &quot;Women&quot; and the Colorado/Quichua &quot;Razo&quot; for &quot;Ice/Snow&quot; resulting in &quot;Women of Ice&quot;. According to another, &quot;Chimbo&quot; is Jívaro for &quot;Throne of Master/God&quot; resulting in &quot;Icethrone of God&quot;. The locals also used to call the mountain &quot;Urcurazu&quot;, with the Quichua &quot;Urcu&quot; for &quot;Mountain&quot; resulting in &quot;Mountain of Ice&quot;. In local indigenous mysticism, Chimborazo represents &quot;Taita&quot; (Father) whereas neighbouring Tungurahua is seen as &quot;Mama&quot;, and &quot;Guagua&quot; (Child) for Pichincha hence &quot;Taita Chimborazo, Mama Tungurahua and Guagua Pichincha&quot;.

==Geography==

===Location===

Chimborazo is in the Chimborazo Province of Ecuador, south-southwest of the city of Quito, Ecuador. It is a neighbor to high Carihuairazo, another inactive stratovolcano. Chimborazo&#x27;s summit rises above the surrounding highlands (~) with a ≈ wide base.

Under clear conditions, the summit of Chimborazo can be seen from the coastal city Guayaquil, nearly away. The nearest cities are Riobamba (~30 km to the southeast), Ambato (~30 km to the northeast) and Guaranda (~25 km to the southwest). Chimborazo is surrounded by the &quot;Reserva de Producción Faunistica Chimborazo&quot;, which forms a protected ecosystem to preserve the habitat for the Andes native camelids of vicuña, llama and alpaca.

Chimborazo is at the main end of the Ecuadorian Volcanic Arc, northwest of the town of Riobamba. Chimborazo is in la Avenida de los Volcanes (the Avenue of Volcanoes) west of the Sanancajas mountain chain. Carihuairazo, Tungurahua, Tulabug, and El Altar are all mountains that neighbor Chimborazo. The closest mountain peak, Carihuairazo, is from Chimborazo. There are many microclimates near Chimborazo, varying from desert in the Arenal to the humid mountains in the Abraspungo valley.

===Glaciers===

The top of Chimborazo is completely covered by glaciers, with some northeastern glacier arms flowing down to 4,600 m. Its glacier is the source of water for the population of the Bolivar and Chimborazo provinces of Ecuador. Chimborazo glacier&#x27;s ice mass has decreased over the past decades, which is thought to be in large part due to climate change, as well as ash cover from recent volcanic activity at Tungurahua, and the El Niño phenomenon.

As on other glaciated Ecuadorian mountains, Chimborazo&#x27;s glacial ice is mined by locals (the so-called &quot;Hieleros&quot; from Spanish &quot;Hielo&quot; for Ice) to be sold in the markets of Guaranda and Riobamba. In earlier days, the people transported ice for cooling uses down to coastal towns such as Babahoyo or Vinces.

===Elevation===
With an elevation of , Chimborazo is the highest mountain in Ecuador and the Andes north of Peru; it is higher than any more northerly summit in the Americas.

===Farthest point from Earth&#x27;s center===

The summit of Mount Everest is higher above sea level, but the summit of Chimborazo is widely reported to be the farthest point on the surface from Earth&#x27;s center, with Huascarán in Peru a very close second.

The summit of Chimborazo is the fixed point on Earth that has the utmost distance from the center this because of the oblate spheroid shape of the planet Earth, which is thicker at the Equator than it is from pole to pole. Chimborazo is one degree south of the Equator and the Earth&#x27;s diameter at the Equator is greater than at the latitude of Everest ( above sea level), nearly 28° north, with sea level also elevated. Despite being lower in elevation above sea level, it is from the Earth&#x27;s center, farther than the summit of Everest ( from the Earth&#x27;s center). However, by height above sea level, Chimborazo is not the highest peak of the Andes.

Centrifugal force from the Earth&#x27;s rotation, and distance from the center of the Earth, cause the force of gravity to be slightly reduced near the equator. The summit of Chimborazo has about one percent less gravity than the point with the highest gravitational force. Yet, due to its height above the surrounding terrain and local gravity anomalies, the summit of Huascarán is the place on Earth with the smallest gravitational force.

==Geology==
Chimborazo is an ice-capped inactive volcano. It is a double volcano composed of one volcanic edifice on top of another. Chimborazo shows four summits; Whymper, Veintimilla, Politecnica, and Nicolas Martínez. The Whymper peak is the highest point on the mountain at 6,263 meters. The Veintimilla peak is about high. The Politecnica peak is high. The last peak, Nicolas Martínez, is high and was named after the father of Ecuadorian mountaineering. The volcano is categorized as a stratovolcano. This type of volcano is characterized as having low slopes at the bottom that gradually get steeper the higher up the mountain. Chimborazo has a circumference of and a diameter of . Chimborazo&#x27;s upper elevations are covered in glaciers that are decreasing in size due to climate change and falling ash from the nearby volcano, Tungurahua. In addition to the glaciers, the volcano is covered with craters. The volcano is dominantly andesitic to dacitic. This means that the lava is blocky, or flowing down the sides of the volcano, or somewhere in between.

Chimborazo is 73.5 meters higher than the highest mountain in North America. Chimborazo is often associated with the nearby volcano Cotopaxi, although the two volcanoes have completely different structures.

==Volcanism==

Chimborazo is a dominantly andesitic-dacitic stratovolcano. About 35,000 years ago a collapse of Chimborazo produced a debris avalanche with an average thickness of forty meters, which underlies the city of Riobamba. It temporarily dammed the Río Chambo, causing an ephemeral lake.

Chimborazo then erupted several times during the Holocene, the last time around 550 AD ± 150 years. The eruptions after the collapse were primarily andesitic, or blocky, coagulated lava flow. These eruptions produced pyroclastic surges that went down as far as 3800 meters altitude.

==Surveys and expeditions==


Until the beginning of the 19th century, it was thought that Chimborazo was the highest mountain on Earth (measured from sea level), and such reputation led to many attempts on its summit during the 17th and 18th centuries.

In 1746, the volcano was explored by French academicians from the French Geodesic Mission. Their mission was to determine the sphericity of the Earth. Their work along with another team in Lapland established that the Earth was an oblate spheroid rather than a true sphere. They did not reach the summit of Chimborazo.

In June 1802, during his expedition to South America, the Prussian-born traveler Alexander von Humboldt, accompanied by the French botanist Aimé Bonpland and the Ecuadorian Carlos Montúfar, tried to reach the summit. From his description of the mountain, it seems that before he and his companions had to return suffering from altitude sickness they reached a point at 5,875 m, higher than previously attained by any European in recorded history (Incans had reached much higher altitudes previously; see Llullaillaco). In 1831, Jean-Baptiste Boussingault and Colonel Hall reached a new &quot;highest point&quot;, estimated to be 6,006 m. Other failed attempts to reach the summit followed.
On 4 January 1880, the English climber Edward Whymper reached the summit of Chimborazo. The route that Whymper took up the mountain is now known as the Whymper route. As there were many critics who doubted that Whymper had reached the summit, later in the same year he climbed to the summit again, choosing a different route (Pogyos) with the Ecuadorians David Beltrán and Francisco Campaña.

===SAETA Flight 232===
In August 1976, SAETA Flight 232 carrying 55 passengers and four crew members aboard a Vickers Viscount from Quito to Cuenca disappeared en route. In February 2003, after almost 27 years, the aircraft was found with the bodies of its 59 occupants at an elevation of on Chimborazo by Ecuadorian climbers, on the rarely used eastern route &quot;Integral&quot;.

==Mountaineering==

As Ecuador&#x27;s highest mountain, Chimborazo is a very popular climb and can be climbed year-round with the best seasons being December–January and July–August.

=== Routes ===
The easiest (IFAS Grade: PD) and most climbed routes are the Normal and the Whymper routes. Both are western ridge routes starting at the Whymper hut and leading via the Ventemilla summit to the main (Whymper) summit.
There are several other less used and more challenging routes on the mountain&#x27;s other faces and ridges leading to one of Chimborazo&#x27;s summits: Main (Whymper, Ecuador), Politecnico (Central), N. Martinez (Eastern). The mountain is contained on the IGM (&quot;Instituto Geografico Militar&quot;) 1:50000 Map &quot;Chimborazo (CT-ÑIV-C1)&quot;.

===Huts===
There are two functioning huts, the Carrel Hut (4,850 m) and the nearby Whymper Hut (5,000 m). The Carrel Hut can be reached by car from Riobamba, Ambato or Guaranda. On the northwest side there is the now defunct Zurita hut (4,900 m), which served as base for the Pogyos route.

===Climbing===
El Castillo is the most popular route up the volcano. This route is usually climbed from December to February and June to September. This route involves climbing the west side of the volcano. The route starts at Whymper hut to a saddle above El Castillo. From the saddle, there is a glacier ridge. Then climbers go to the Veintemilla summit. Veintemilla summit is often the turnaround point for climbers. There is a 30-minute snow-filled basin between Veintemilla summit and Whymper summit. Whymper summit is the highest point of the mountain. The El Castillo route takes around eight to twelve hours to ascend and about three to five hours to descend. Climbing Chimborazo is dangerous due to the risk of avalanches, the severe weather conditions, and the fact that it is covered in glaciers. Climbing begins at night in order to reach the summit before sunrise when the snow melts, which increases the chance of avalanche and rockfall.

The climb itself demands skill. The climb is often on black ice, so crampons and other technical climbing equipment are required. On November 10, 1993 three parties of climbers, one ascending and two descending, were caught in an avalanche on the steep slopes below the Veintimilla summit. This avalanche buried ten climbers in a crevasse at . These climbers comprised six French, two Ecuadorians, one Swiss, and one Chilean. After the ten climbers were buried in snow, it took twenty people and ten days to find their bodies. This was considered the worst climbing accident in Ecuador.

<text>Dejan Bodiroga (; born 2 March 1973) is a Serbian basketball executive and former professional player, who is currently the President of EuroLeague Basketball. In 1998 and 2002, he received the Golden Badge award for the best athlete of Yugoslavia, and the Yugoslav Olympic Committee also declared him the Sportsman of the Year. He was named to the FIBA All-Time EuroStars Team in 2007. In 2018, he was named one of the 101 Greats of European Basketball. HoopsHype named Bodiroga one of the 75 Greatest International Players Ever in 2021. He was inducted into the Greek Basket League Hall of Fame in 2022.

During his playing career, he mainly played at the small forward position, but he could also play point forward, and at both guard positions. A EuroLeague icon of the early part of the 2000s, Bodiroga was named to the 50 Greatest EuroLeague Contributors in 2008, and to the EuroLeague 2000–2010 All-Decade Team in 2010. He was also voted by fans the EuroLeague&#x27;s 2000–2010 Player of the Decade. At the club level, Bodiroga proved himself to be a symbol of basketball excellence, by lifting consecutive EuroLeague trophies in 2002 and 2003, with Panathinaikos and FC Barcelona, as he earned the EuroLeague Final Four MVP award both times. He also won each of the three major European national domestic basketball league titles: the Spanish ACB League, the Italian A League, and the Greek Basket League. He is widely regarded as one of the greatest European players of all time.

With the senior FR Yugoslavian national team, Bodiroga won three EuroBasket gold medals, in 1995, 1997, and 2001, as well as a bronze medal in 1999. With FR Yugoslavia, he also won a silver medal at the 1996 Summer Olympics. In addition to that, Bodiroga also won two FIBA World Cup gold medals with FR Yugoslavia, in 1998 and 2002, earning MVP honors in the former.

==Professional career==

===Yugoslavia (1989–1991)===
Bodiroga first started playing structured basketball at the age of 13. He enrolled in Zrenjanin&#x27;s Mašinac (Servo Mihalj) basketball section, under supervision of local basketball enthusiast Rade Prvulov. At the age of fifteen, he sprung up to 2.05m, and was quickly incorporated into the first team squad, coached by Miodrag Nikolić, a former OKK Belgrade and SFR Yugoslav national team player in the 1960s.

His domestic career took off when, at 17, he was noticed by Krešimir Ćosić at a friendly youth tournament that featured Mašinac and Zadar among others, where Bodiroga scored 32 points in a game that pitted two teams. Ćosić then brought Bodiroga for a week-long basketball camp in Zadar and eventually persuaded Bodiroga&#x27;s family to allow their son to move away to Zadar. In the meantime Bodiroga signed a pre-contract with Vojvodina so that when he finally went to Zadar in autumn 1989 he wasn&#x27;t right away eligible for the first team, meaning that he first worked with coach Josip Grdović in the club&#x27;s youth sections while simultaneously attending high school. After a year he was allowed to be moved into the full squad, then under head coach Slavko Trninić. After just one season in the first team, Bodiroga&#x27;s stay in Zadar came to a premature end due to the impending war. Ćosić, his mentor, did everything in his power to help Bodiroga find a new club.

===Italy (1992–1996)===
Originally, trials were arranged with AEK and Olympiacos, with both clubs offering a contract solely on the condition that Bodiroga become a naturalised Greek citizen. He ultimately refused the conditions and ended up traveling to Italy instead, joining a Stefanel Trieste emerging team, coached by Bogdan Tanjević and financially backed by the Stefanel clothing empire. In Trieste, he first captured the attention of the wider basketball public. Shortly after his arrival in the summer of 1992, he made an impact, averaging 21.3 points per game over 30 league matches and leading his team to the playoffs. There, however, they were quickly disposed of in the second round by the more experienced Clear Cantù.

He had a stellar season for Trieste in 1993–94, this time leading his team deeper into the playoffs. In the semifinals game 3 against Scavolini Pesaro, Carlton Myers&#x27; buzzer beater clinched a 2–1 series victory for Pesaro. Trieste also reached the FIBA Korać Cup final, where they surrendered to PAOK from Thessaloniki, who starred Zoran Savić, Walter Berry and Bane Prelević. After that season, Stefanel changed its backing to Olimpia Milano, sparking an exodus of Trieste players and coaches to Lombardy (coach Tanjević, Bodiroga, Gregor Fučka, Alessandro De Pol, Davide Cantarello, and Ferdinando Gentile).

Bodiroga&#x27;s leading role remained unchanged as he developed into an all-around player. In 1994–95, Olimpia reached the Korać Cup final, with players that also reached it the previous year in Trieste. However, they lost to Alba Berlin, coached by Svetislav Pešić, who would later play a big role in Bodiroga&#x27;s career. On the home front, the team made it to the playoff semi-finals but lost 3–2 to the eventual champions, Buckler Bologna, led by another Serbian superstar, Predrag Danilović. The two Serbs turned the series into a personal duel, with Danilović&#x27;s experience prevailing in the end.

The summer of 1995 was an important milestone for Bodiroga. He became part of the great FR Yugoslavia squad that was making its comeback after years of international exile. The team was loaded with stars like Aleksandar Đorđević, Vlade Divac, Žarko Paspalj, Danilović and Savić. Together, they won the gold in one of the most spectacular finals in EuroBasket history against a Lithuania that featured the likes of Arvydas Sabonis, Šarūnas Marčiulionis, Rimas Kurtinaitis, and Artūras Karnišovas.

That same summer, Bodiroga was drafted by the Sacramento Kings in the 1995 NBA draft (second round, #51 overall). One year later, the Kings selected his younger countryman Peja Stojaković. However, unlike Stojaković, Bodiroga declined the offer to play in the NBA, choosing instead to remain in Europe. In 1995–96, Bodiroga won his first trophy in Milan, but the Korać Cup was again lost, this time to Efes Pilsen.

In the league, Bodiroga led the way with 23.3 points per game in 32 regular season matches. During the playoffs, they beat Virtus 3–1 in the semi-finals (Danilovic left for the Miami Heat in the summer), and Teamsystem Bologna led by Myers, Đorđević and Alessandro Frosini. He took his place in the FR Yugoslav national team for the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta and he brought home a silver medal, with Dream Team III winning the gold.

===Real Madrid (1996–1998)===
For the 1996–97 season, Bodiroga joined Real Madrid after an offer of $1 million per season, and teaming up with coach Željko Obradović, whom he knew well from his national team stints. The squad also featured veteran Joe Arlauckas as well as established internationals Alberto Herreros and Mikhail Mikhaylov. In the Spanish ACB League finals, they faced an FC Barcelona team that boasted Aleksandar Đorđević, Jerrod Mustaf, and Artūras Karnišovas. FC Barcelona prevailed 3–2, winning the deciding 5th game 82–69 away, as Madrid settled with the European Cup trophy.

On the national basketball front, Yugoslavia rolled over the competition with considerable ease &quot;en route&quot; to another EuroBasket gold in 1997, with Bodiroga again playing an integral role. In the group stages, the Serbs faced Croatia, in the first meeting in basketball between the two nations since the breakup of the old Yugoslavia. The game carried much political tension and was low-scoring, with Đorđević winning it for FR Yugoslavia (by then comprising only Serbia and Montenegro) with a dramatic 3-pointer at the end.

In Bodiroga&#x27;s next and final season with Real Madrid, (and without Obradovic, who had moved to Benetton Treviso) there were no improvements, as the team was ousted in the league&#x27;s semifinals by TDK Manresa. He did achieve league MVP honours for the 1997–98 season. That summer&#x27;s national team duty was happier, as it brought another World Championship title for FR Yugoslavia, the first for Bodiroga. Now 25, Bodiroga was, together with Đorđević (who suffered knee problems and played few minutes) and Željko Rebrača, one of the team leaders.

===Panathinaikos (1998–2002)===
The same summer of 1998 also saw Bodiroga move to the Greek powerhouse Panathinaikos, where club chairman Pavlos Giannakopoulos began assembling a team to conquer Europe. As such, Bodiroga was the final piece of the jigsaw puzzle that already included Dino Rađa, Fragiskos Alvertis, Michael Koch, &quot;Nando&quot; Gentile, Pat Burke and coach Slobodan Subotić.

The &quot;Greens&quot; won the Greek League, but the EuroLeague ended in a disappointing note, leading to the departures of Radja and Subotić, with the latter&#x27;s replacement being old acquaintance Željko Obradović, who brought along Željko Rebrača from Benetton Treviso, Johnny Rogers from Olympiacos and Oded Kattash from Maccabi Tel Aviv. After such an investment, Panathinaikos captured both the 1999–00 Greek League and the EuroLeague trophies, the latter coming in a final versus Maccabi Tel Aviv. In 2001, Panathinaikos again won the Greek Championship and also reached the SuproLeague final in Paris. A year later, Bodiroga was named the EuroLeague Final Four MVP, as the Greeks beat hosts Kinder Bologna, and their star player Manu Ginóbili 89–83.

In the international front, Bodiroga, as the team&#x27;s undisputed leader, helped FR Yugoslavia win the EuroBasket 2001 in Turkey and the 2002 FIBA World Championship in Indianapolis. In this competition, the national side defeated Team USA in the quarterfinals and the Argentine national team in the final, in overtime.

===Barcelona (2002–2005)===
In the summer of 2002, Bodiroga returned to the Spanish league&#x27;s FC Barcelona, which was managed by Svetislav Pešić and had players like Šarūnas Jasikevičius, Gregor Fučka and Juan Carlos Navarro. He won the EuroLeague with &quot;Barça&quot; (the first time the team achieved this), and also added two domestic league titles with them.

===Virtus Roma (2005–2007)===
In the 2005–06 season, Bodiroga came back to the Italian League, this time with Lottomatica Roma, re-joining coach Pešić, as the team played in the ULEB Cup (now called EuroCup). After getting eliminated from European contention in the round of 16 and losing the Italian Cup final (83–85) to Carpisa Napoli, Virtus finished the season in 6th place with a 22–12 record in the national league. Bodiroga finished the year with a 15.7 points-per-game regular season scoring average.

The playoff first round pitted Roma against favorites Montepaschi Siena. After dropping the first game, Bodiroga dominated the series in a 3–1 victory. During the 2006–07 season&#x27;s playoffs, however, both teams played again, with the exact opposite outcome. After the fourth and final game, Bodiroga announced his retirement from professional basketball in June 2007.

==National team career==
===Junior national team===
Bodiroga was a member of the SFR Yugoslav junior national teams. He played at the 1990 FIBA Europe Under-18 Championship. He also played at the FIBA Under-19 World Cup, where he was named the MVP of the tournament.

===Senior national team===
Bodiroga made his debut for the senior SFR Yugoslav national team in 1991, at the first round of the 1991 Mediterranean Games in Athens. He was also a regular member of the senior FR Yugoslavia national team, throughout the 1990s and early 2000s, participating in a total of three Summer Olympics (1996, 2000, 2004,) two FIBA World Cups (1998 and 2002) and five EuroBaskets (1995, 1997, 1999, 2001, and 2005).

Bodiroga retired from the national team after the EuroBasket 2005 fiasco, in which his team, one of the tournament&#x27;s favorites, was eliminated as early as the first elimination round, by the French national team, on their own home court, in a tournament that ended with a verbal tirade by head coach Željko Obradović, at the team&#x27;s final press conference. At which, the coach revealed there had been numerous fights between many of the team&#x27;s players.

He won the following medals: EuroBasket 1995 (gold), 1996 Atlanta Summer Olympic Games (silver), EuroBasket 1997 (gold), 1998 FIBA World Championship (gold), EuroBasket 1999 (bronze), EuroBasket 2001 (gold), 2002 FIBA World Championship (gold). He was selected to the EuroBasket All-Tournament Teams in 1997 and 1999. He was also selected the FIBA World Cup MVP in 1998.

==Executive career==
After retiring from playing professional basketball in June 2007, Bodiroga became the general manager of the Italian club Virtus Roma, thus continuing at the club where he finished his playing career. He ended his general manager term in June 2009.

In April 2010, Bodiroga along with fellow former player Željko Rebrača sued the Carmel, Indiana-based company Worldwide Associates LLC for investment fraud. They allege in their suit they each gave the company more than $4 million to manage, which the company used as venture capital in speculative startup companies instead of investing it in traditional securities.

From 2011 to 2015, he served as the Vice President of the Basketball Federation of Serbia (KSS). In June 2014, he was appointed as the President of the Competition Commission of FIBA Europe. In February 2015, Bodiroga left the Basketball Federation of Serbia, in order to focus more on his job with FIBA Europe.

In May 2022, Bodiroga was announced as one of the candidates to be the successor of Jordi Bertomeu, to take over the role of President of EuroLeague Basketball. On 14 September 2022, Bodiroga was officially named EuroLeague Basketball&#x27;s new President.

==Personal life==
The son of Vaso and Milka Bodiroga, Dejan is a devout Serbian Orthodox Christian. His father hails from the village of Bodiroge near Trebinje and was among the wave of migrants from Herzegovina that moved northwards following the devastations of World War II. On 13 July 2003 Bodiroga married his long-time fiancée Ivana Medić; the couple&#x27;s first child was born in 2004.

Bodiroga is a relative of Croatian basketball players Dražen Petrović and Aleksandar Petrović. Bodiroga&#x27;s paternal grandmother and their paternal grandfather were brother and sister, making Bodiroga and the Petrović brothers second cousins. Although he never played for the club, Bodiroga is a declared fan of Partizan and is often seen at their games. Bodiroga is one of the founding members of the Group Seven Children&#x27;s Foundation.

Bodiroga is one of a small number of players that have won the EuroLeague championship with clubs from two different countries, and he is also one of the few players to win each of the top three most important European national domestic leagues historically, the Italian League, the Greek League, and the Spanish League. During his playing career, Bodiroga had several nicknames – Bodi Bond, &quot;White Magic&quot;, Mr. MVP, and God.

In Serbia, he is admired for his unassuming and quiet way of going about matters. Bodiroga is also highly regarded by fans of the Greek club Panathinaikos, due to the high level of passion that he displayed in the games he played in against the club&#x27;s arch-rivals, Olympiacos.

<text>Fudbalski klub Crvena zvezda (), commonly referred to as Crvena zvezda () and colloquially referred to as Red Star Belgrade in anglophone media, is a Serbian professional football club based in Belgrade, and a major part of the Red Star multi-sport society.

They are the most successful club from the Balkans and Southeast Europe, being the only club to have won both the European Cup and Intercontinental Cup, having done so in 1991, and only the second team from Eastern Europe to win the European Cup. With 35 national championships, 28 national cups, 2 national supercups, 2 national champions leagues and one league cup between Serbian and Yugoslav competitions, Red Star was the most successful club in Yugoslavia and finished first in the Yugoslav First League all-time table, and is the most successful club in Serbia.

According to 2008 polls, Red Star Belgrade is the most popular football club in Serbia, with 48% of the population supporting them. They have many supporters in other former Yugoslav republics and among the Serbian diaspora. Their main rivals are fellow Belgrade side Partizan. The championship matches between these two clubs are known as the Eternal derby.

According to the International Federation of Football History &amp; Statistics&#x27; list of the Top 200 European clubs of the 20th century, Red Star is the highest-ranked Serbian and Balkan club, sharing the 27th position.

==History==

===Yugoslavia and Serbia-Montenegro period===
In February 1945, during World War II, a group of young men, active players, students and members of the Serbian United Antifascist Youth League, decided to form a Youth Physical Culture Society, that was to become Red Star Belgrade on 4 March. Previously, as of December 1944, all pre-war Serbian clubs were abolished, and on 5 May 1945, communist Secretary of Sports Mitra Mitrović-Djilas signed the decree dissolving formally all pre-war clubs on the territory of Socialist Republic of Serbia. The clubs were dissolved because during the German occupation, there was an attempt to organize the league so all the clubs were labelled collaborators by Josip Broz Tito&#x27;s communist regime.

The name Red Star was assigned after a long discussion. Other ideas shortlisted by the delegates included &quot;People&#x27;s Star&quot;, &quot;Blue Star&quot;, &quot;Proleter&quot;, &quot;Stalin&quot;, &quot;Lenin&quot;, &quot;etc.&quot; The initial vice presidents of the Sport Society – Zoran Žujović and Slobodan Ćosić – were the ones who assigned it. Red Star was soon adopted as a symbol of Serbian nationalism within Yugoslavia and a sporting institution which remains the country&#x27;s most popular to this day. On that day, Red Star played the first football match in the club&#x27;s history against the First Battalion of the Second Brigade of KNOJ (People&#x27;s Defence Corps of Yugoslavia) and won 3–0.

Red Star&#x27;s first successes involved small steps to recognition. In the first fifteen years of existence, Red Star won one Serbian championship, six Yugoslav championships, five Yugoslav Cups, one Danube Cup and reached the semi-finals of the 1956–57 European Cup. Some of the greatest players during this period were Kosta Tomašević, Branko Stanković, Rajko Mitić, Vladimir Beara, Bora Kostić, Vladica Popović, Vladimir Durković and Dragoslav Šekularac. As champions, Red Star were Yugoslavia&#x27;s entrants into the 1957–58 European Cup where they were famously beaten 5–4 on aggregate by English champions Manchester United in the quarter-finals. Manchester United, managed by Matt Busby defeated Red Star 2–1 in the first leg in England before drawing 3–3 with them in Yugoslavia in the return match on 5 February at JNA Stadium. The second leg is notable for being the last match played by the Busby Babes: on the return flight to England the following day, the plane crashed in Munich, resulting in the deaths of 23 people, including eight Manchester United players.

During the Miljan Miljanić era, Red Star won four Yugoslav championships, three Yugoslav cups, two Yugoslav supercups, one Yugoslav league cup, one Mitropa Cup and reached the semi-finals of the 1970–71 European Cup. A new generation of players emerged under Miljanić&#x27;s guidance, led by Dragan Džajić and Jovan Aćimović. Red Star eliminated Liverpool in the second round of the 1973–74 European Cup and Real Madrid in the quarter-finals of the 1974–75 European Cup Winners&#x27; Cup. Branko Stanković, whose reign as head coach was to last four years, brought Red Star three trophies and the first great European final. After eliminating teams like Arsenal, West Bromwich Albion and Hertha BSC, Red Star made for the first time the UEFA Cup final. There, Red Star met Borussia Mönchengladbach, who played five European finals from 1973 to 1980. The Germans fell behind one goal from Miloš Šestić, but Ivan Jurišić&#x27;s own goal gave Gladbach a psychological advantage before the rematch. This game was played at the Rheinstadion in Düsseldorf, where the Italian referee Alberto Michelotti gave a questionable penalty to the Germans, and the Danish player Allan Simonsen sealed Red Star&#x27;s fate. &quot;The Foals&quot; won 2–1 on aggregate.

After the 1970s, historical matches against Udo Lattek&#x27;s Barcelona followed during the 1982–83 European Cup Winners&#x27; Cup. In both matches, Barcelona were the better team and Red Star was eliminated. Remarkably, when Barça&#x27;s Diego Maradona scored his second goal in front of approximately 100,000 spectators at the Marakana, the Belgrade audience were so excited about the goal that even the loyal Belgrade fans applauded Maradona. Gojko Zec returned to the team in 1983, finding only one player from the champions generation he was coaching back in 1977, Miloš Šestić. Zec similarly repeated the club&#x27;s triumph from his previous mandate by winning the championship immediately upon his arrival. Zec would later leave the club in a controversial &quot;Šajber&#x27;s case&quot;-style scandal which was the result of irregularities in the 1985–86 season.

After Zec left in 1986, there were great changes in the club. The management of the club, run by Dragan Džajić and Vladimir Cvetković, began to build a team that could compete with some of the most powerful European sides. During that summer, Velibor Vasović became coach and the side was strengthened by acquiring a number of talented young players, among whom Dragan Stojković and Borislav Cvetković stood out. In the first season that started with penalty points, Red Star focused on the European Cup and achieving good results. In 1986, a five-year plan was developed by the club and Prof. Dr Veljko Aleksić with the only goal being to win the European Cup. All that was planned was finally achieved. On the club&#x27;s birthday in 1987, it started. Real Madrid were defeated at the Marakana. From that day through to March 1992, Red Star enjoyed the best period of success in its history. In these five seasons, Red Star won four National Championships; in the last of those four years of heyday, the club won the 1991 European Cup Final, played in Bari, Italy.

Red Star coach Ljupko Petrović brought the team to Italy a week before the final in order to peacefully prepare the players for a forthcoming encounter with Marseille. By that time, Red Star had 18 goals in 8 matches, whereas the French champions had 20. Therefore, the 100th European competing final was expected to be a spectacle of offense. Nonetheless, both Petrović and Raymond Goethals opted for defence and the match settled down into a war of attrition. After a 120-minute match and only few chances on both sides, the match was decided following the penalty shootout. After several minutes of stressful penalties, one of Marseille&#x27;s players, Manuel Amoros, missed a penalty, and Darko Pančev converted his penalty to bring the European Cup to Yugoslavia for the first time. Red Star won the shootout, 5–3, on 29 May 1991 in front of 60,000 spectators and the millions watching on television around the world. Twenty-thousand Red Star fans at the Stadio San Nicola and millions of them all over Yugoslavia and the world celebrated the greatest joy in Red Star&#x27;s history. Red Star went unbeaten at the 1990–91 European Cup in Bari and the 1991 Intercontinental Cup in Tokyo.

In 1992, the club was weakened by the departure of numerous players from the champions generation (new players were added, such as Dejan Petković and Anto Drobnjak). The success in the previous season caught the attention of European giants which rushed making lucrative offers to sign Red Star&#x27;s best players. In addition, Red Star had to defend the continental trophy playing its home games in Szeged, Budapest and Sofia due to the war in former Yugoslavia, thereby reducing their chances of defending their title. UEFA changed the format of the competition that year and the 1991–92 European Cup was the first to be played in a format with two groups each having four teams. Despite the disadvantage of playing its home games abroad, Red Star still did well and finished second in the group behind Sampdoria. In domestic competition, main rivals Hajduk Split and Dinamo Zagreb left the league, just as all the other clubs from Croatia, Macedonia and Slovenia did, and the championship in Yugoslavia that was cut in size was played on the edge of observance of regulations around the beginning of the Bosnian War. At the end of May, the United Nations had the country under sanctions and dislodged Yugoslav football from the international scene. The Breakup of Yugoslavia, the Yugoslav Wars, the inflation and the UN sanctions have hit Red Star hard. In the period between May 1992 and May 2000, only one championship victory was celebrated at the Marakana. However, they did manage to win five cups, along with several glorious European performances, including the famed 1996 UEFA Cup Winners&#x27; Cup showdown against Barcelona side which featured Ronaldo and Hristo Stoichkov.

Immediately after the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia ended, Red Star won the 17th cup in its history by winning 4–2 against Partizan. Two seasons later, the club returned to the European spotlight by making it to the 2001–02 UEFA Champions League qualifying rounds, where Red Star was eliminated by Bayer Leverkusen (0–0 and 0–3), which would later be a finalist in the Champions League that year. Slavoljub Muslin left the bench in September 2001, after which Red Star&#x27;s subsequent seasons became more volatile.

===Recent era===

In the 2006–07 UEFA Champions League qualifying rounds, Red Star was eliminated (3–1 on aggregate) by the same Milan side which ultimately won that year&#x27;s competition. Furthermore, the campaign in Group F of the 2007–08 UEFA Cup was a large disappointment, especially given that the first game against Bayern Munich was a sensational last-minute loss (by a score of 2–3 in Belgrade). In those years, Red Star&#x27;s teams featured the likes of Nikola Žigić, Boško Janković, Milan Biševac, Dušan Basta, Dejan Milovanović, Segundo Castillo, Ibrahima Gueye, Nenad Milijaš and Ognjen Koroman. After a six-year drought, Red Star won their 26th league title in 2013–14 season.

Despite Red Star&#x27;s success on the pitch in 2013–14, the financial situation at the club has worsened, so much so that the club were banned from participating in the 2014–15 UEFA Champions League for which they qualified by winning the Serbian SuperLiga. The UEFA Club Financial Control Body found Red Star&#x27;s debts to players, some of whom had not been paid for at least six months, staff and other clubs, totalled €1.86 million. The club board were also alleged to have hidden debts and falsified documents. This, on top of an earlier UEFA disciplinary measure in 2011, meant Red Star did not meet the necessary Club Licensing and Financial Fair Play criteria and, as such, should not have been granted a UEFA license by the Serbian FA. Rivals Partizan took Red Star&#x27;s place in the UEFA Champions League second qualifying round.

After ten years of waiting, Red Star qualified for the 2017–18 UEFA Europa League group stage. Red Star progressed through four qualifying rounds and reached the knockout phase of the tournament, becoming the first team in competition&#x27;s history to reach the knockout phase after starting their season in the first qualifying round. Although Red Star played in the group stage of the first edition in which groups format was introduced in the European Cup, 1991–92 European Cup, the designation &quot;Champions League&quot; was only adopted a season later in which Yugoslav clubs were already banned from participating in. Thus, when Red Star eliminated Red Bull Salzburg in the 2018–19 UEFA Champions League play-off round, and qualified for the UEFA Champions League group stage, it meant that Red Star competed for the first time since the new format was introduced. Red Star became the first Serbian team to win a match in the UEFA Champions League when they defeated Liverpool.

On 14 May 2019, the 1946 People&#x27;s Republic of Serbia League title was officially recognized by the Serbian FA, meaning that Red Star&#x27;s triumph in the 2018–19 Serbian SuperLiga was their 30th national championship. Red Star reached the UEFA Champions League group stage for the second successive season after eliminating Sūduva, HJK Helsinki, Copenhagen and Young Boys. On 5 November 2019, cable television channel Zvezda TV started airing.

In the 2020–21 Serbian SuperLiga, Red Star set a world record for the number of points gained in a single season with 108 points. Red Star won their seventh Serbian SuperLiga title in a row and completed their fourth consecutive double in the 2023–24 season.

==Crest and colours==

Red Star initially wore yellow shirts with a red star which were acquired from &quot;FK Slavija&quot; (from Čubura). In 1946, the club switched to red shirts with white shorts and alternating red-white socks before adopting the signature red and white vertical striped shirts, with alternating white or red shorts and socks in 1950. The red and white stripes have become indivisible to Red Star&#x27;s image, conferring the popular nickname &quot;Crveno-beli&quot;, &quot;the red and white&#x27;s&quot; in Serbian. The club continued to wear the initial pre-stripe kit throughout its existence, but has generally declined in usage. During the 1950s and 1960s, the club also alternated between blue trunks, a long white V-neck on a red shirt, and a red shirt with thin white horizontal lines.

Red Star have usually worn an all-white away kit, whilst also utilizing predominantly blue or red away or third kits, thereby incorporating the Serbian tricolour. The club crest is a red five-pointed star, white framed, on a red-white background. In addition, the whole crest is framed in gold. There are three golden stars on the top of the club emblem, symbolizing the 30 titles won.

Despite the club&#x27;s overtly Communist name and imagery, Red Star Football Club has become a symbol in its own right. The &quot;&quot;petokraka&quot;&quot; from which the club&#x27;s name derives has paradoxically become a symbol of the club itself and of Serbian nationalism, moving further away from its original association with the Partisans and the Communist Party of Yugoslavia. Due to Red Star&#x27;s popularity and sporting success, the club and its crest have become synonymous with broader Serbian identity, and patriotism that echoes beyond the sporting landscape.

==Stadium==

Red Star&#x27;s home ground is the Rajko Mitić Stadium (since 21 December 2014), formerly known as Red Star Stadium. With a seated capacity of 53,000 it is the largest stadium in Serbia and in the former Yugoslavia. The stadium was opened in 1963, and in the course of time and due to the fact that stadium&#x27;s former capacity was about 110,000, it got the unofficial moniker Marakana, after the large and famous Maracanã Stadium in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, and Belgrade&#x27;s sold-out Marakana garnered the reputation of being a very tough ground for visiting teams to play in. Some of the biggest football events have been held at this stadium, such as the European Cup final between Ajax and Juventus in 1973, UEFA European Championship final between West Germany and Czechoslovakia in 1976, and the first leg of the UEFA Cup final between Red Star and Borussia Mönchengladbach in 1979. During the mid-1990s, in order to meet UEFA demands for spectators comfort and security, standing places at the stadium were completely done away with and seats were installed on all four stands. In the years, since the stadium&#x27;s capacity was gradually decreased, followed different stadium modernisations. 

In 2008, the club reconstructed the stadium&#x27;s pitch, under-soil grass heaters, improved drainage systems were installed and new modern turf replaced the old surface. The training pitch, located next to the stadium, was also renovated by laying down synthetic turf and installing new lighting equipment. In 2011, the stadium received also a new modern LED scoreboard. Today, the stadium has a central lodge, named &quot;5 Zvezdinih Zvezda&quot; (English: 5 Stars of Red Star), which consist of five segments, each bears the name of one of Red Star&#x27;s legendary players (Mitić, Šekularac, Džajić, Petrović, Stojković), two other VIP lounges and a special VIP gallery with over 450 seats. It has also a modern press box with a capacity of 344 seats including seven extra-comfortable seats, an extra media center, the Red Cafe and a restaurant. On the west stand of the stadium exist also an official Red Star shop along with a Delije shop. The playing field measures are 110 × 73 m, and is illuminated by 1,400 lux floodlights. According to the known German Web portal&quot; &quot;Stadionwelt&quot;&quot;, Belgrade&#x27;s &quot;Marakana&quot; is in the top 50 football stadiums in Europe. In 2012, American Bleacher Report ranked the Red Star Stadium, especially if it is sold out, as among the most intimidating stadiums in the world.

==Supporters==

Red Star is the most popular football club in Serbia. The club has fans and sympathisers throughout the whole country, but also throughout the regional and global Serbian diaspora, making the club a symbol of Serbdom. Fan groups are widespread throughout Serbia and former Yugoslav republics, and the club has the highest social media following amongst former Yugoslav football teams. Traditionally, Red Star has been represented as the people&#x27;s club, whilst always attracting support from all social classes, their fan base is not associated with any specific social group. Red Star ultras Delije espouse patriotic, nationalist and right-wing sentiments.

The organized supporters of Red Star are known as Delije, roughly translated in English as the &quot;Heroes&quot;, &quot;Braves&quot;, &quot;Hardman&quot; or &quot;Studs&quot;. The term derives from the plural of the singular form &quot;&quot;Delija&quot;, in Serbian. Delije support all branches of the Red Star multi-sport society. They are one of the most famous supporter groups in the world, renowned for their passion and fanaticism.

Hardcore supporters began to emerge during the 1980s, with official inauguration taking place in 1989. Previously, Red Star fans were scattered amongst several organized fan groups within the north terrace of the Rajko Mitić Stadium, colloquially known as &quot;Marakana&quot;&quot;. Their style of support is greatly influenced by Italian and English football culture of the 1980s. It includes the use of widespread choreography, flares, flags, banners, and boisterous cheering. The word Delije is displayed (in Cyrillic) on the north terrace seats of Rajko Mitić Stadium as a sign of appreciation, and fidelity between the club and supporters. Subgroups of Delije exist outside of Belgrade, along with cities across Serbia and all other ex-Yugoslav republics. Despite Red Star&#x27;s broad fan base, Delije have developed an infamous reputation for hooliganism amongst some segments of its ultras, especially during Belgrade derbies.

Due to historically warm Serbo-Hellenic relations, Red Star&#x27;s Delije ultras have developed a strong kinship with Olympiacos ultras Gate 7. The &quot;Orthodox Brothers&quot; friendship is based on mutual Eastern Orthodox faith, a strong cultural marker amongst the Serbs and Greeks. Both clubs also share the same colours, and are from the national capitals. They are also the most decorated football teams in their respective countries. The brotherhood has evolved to include Spartak Moscow ultras Fratria, owing to strong Russophilia and a shared Slavic heritage.

==The Eternal derby==
Red Star&#x27;s fiercest and long-standing city rival is FK Partizan, football section of the other large and popular multi-sports club in Serbia. The rivalry started immediately after the creation of the two clubs in 1945. Since then, both clubs have been dominant in domestic football. The match is particularly noted for the passion of the Red Star&#x27;s supporters, called &quot;Delije&quot;, and Partizan&#x27;s supporters, the &quot;Grobari&quot; (English: &quot;Gravediggers&quot; or &quot;Undertakers&quot;). The stands of both teams feature fireworks, coloured confetti, flags, rolls of paper, torches, smoke, drums, giant posters and choreographies, used to create visual grandeur and apply psychological pressure on the visiting teams, hence the slogan, &quot;Welcome to Hellgrade&quot;. Both sets of supporters sing passionate songs against their rivals, and the stadiums are known to bounce with the simultaneous jumping of the fans. The duel is regarded as one of the greatest football rivalries in the world and the matches between these rivals have been labeled as the Eternal derby. Given its widespread touch on the entirety of a major city, it is dubbed one of, along with the Old Firm, the Rome derby and the Istanbul derby, the most heated rivalries in European football. The biggest attendance for a Red Star – Partizan match was about 108,000 spectators at the Rajko Mitić Stadium.

==Honours==
Red Star has won 4 international and 68 domestic trophies, making it the most successful football club in Serbia and the former Yugoslavia.

==Club records==
Dragan Džajić is Red Star&#x27;s record appearance holder with 389 matches. The goalscoring record holder is Bora Kostić with 230 goals. Numerous Red Star players were in the Yugoslavia national team and Branko Stanković, Rajko Mitić, Vladimir Beara, Bora Kostić, Vladimir Durković, Dragoslav Šekularac, Miroslav Pavlović, Jovan Aćimović, Dragan Džajić, Vladimir Petrović, Dragan Stojković and Dejan Savićević are among them. Dragan Džajić played 85 matches for the Yugoslavia national football team, a national record.

Red Star holds records such as to be only the second foreign team that could beat Liverpool at Anfield (after Ferencváros in the 1967–68 Inter-Cities Fairs Cup), which was also the only defeat of Liverpool at home in the European Cup history in the whole 20th century (during the 1973–74 European Cup). Red Star was also the first team that could beat Bayern Munich on the Olympiastadion in its long UEFA competition history (during the 1990–91 European Cup).

They are the only Serbian (and ex-Yugoslav) club, and only the second team from Eastern Europe, to have won the European Cup, having done so in 1991, which was also the 100th UEFA competition final. Red Star is among the nine clubs which have ever won the European Cup unbeaten. They are also the only team from the Balkans and Southeast Europe to have won the Intercontinental Cup, also in 1991. The Romanian football player Miodrag Belodedici was the first ever Red Star player to have won the European Cup with two different teams, Steaua București and Red Star; curiously, both of the team&#x27;s names mean &quot;Star&quot;. Later, double winners were also Dejan Savićević (Red Star and Milan) and Vladimir Jugović (Red Star and Juventus).

==Kit suppliers and shirt sponsors==
==General sponsor==
The general sponsor of Serbia&#x27;s most popular football club has, since 2010, been Gazprom Neft, the majority shareholder in leading Serbian company Naftna Industrija Srbije (NIS), and the most important foreign investor in the country. The club has won nine Serbian championship titles and five Serbian Cups in that time, as well as regularly competing in European championships. This cooperation, as well as supporting Gazprom Neft&#x27;s brands, also involves collaborating in youth football together with FC Zenit Saint Petersburg, with the clubs exchanging youth players and holding friendly youth matches.

==In popular culture==
The club&#x27;s name in Serbian is also the title of the 2013 Italian novel &quot;Crvena Zvezda&quot; by Enrico Varrecchione. Written in the alternate history genre, utilizing elements of uchronia, its story is based on the premise of what if 9 November 1988 return leg of the European Cup second round clash between Red Star and AC Milan hadn&#x27;t been ordered abandoned by German referee Dieter Pauly in the 65th minute due to thick fog that night in Belgrade. Red Star were leading 1–0 after a goal by Dejan Savićević and were also a man up due to Milan striker Pietro Paolo Virdis receiving a red card. After abandonment, UEFA cancelled the match and ordered it replayed in full the next day. This time it finished 1–1 and went to penalties (the first leg in Milan also ended 1–1) where Milan won and went through to the quarter-finals, eventually winning the European Cup — thus getting the coveted trophy again after twenty years, the club&#x27;s first under its recently arrived owner, ambitious businessman Silvio Berlusconi. In the novel&#x27;s parallel universe, Red Star won 9 November 1988 match in Belgrade and eliminated AC Milan, which thus never won its 1989 European Cup, meaning that Berlusconi&#x27;s ultimate entry into Italian politics had a much weaker background push, which adversely affected his performance at the 1994 Italian general election. The novel also follows the fate of Red Star&#x27;s fictional striker, loosely based on Savićević, Jovan Eldzic who scored the famous goal in the fog and later went on to transfer to AC Milan where he achieved more accolades, eventually taking Italian citizenship, remaining living in Italy upon retiring from football before entering politics and running for mayor of a small town in Piedmont&#x27;s Alessandria province.

Billy Bragg&#x27;s 1991 UK top thirty hit song &quot;Sexuality&quot; contains the lyric &quot;I had an uncle who once played for Red Star Belgrade.&quot; When interviewed many years later Bragg was asked if this was true, to which he replied that his uncle actually played for Fulham but that did not fit the rhyme with played.

Two non-related bands, one of them from Great Yarmouth, Great Britain, and the other one from Chapel Hill, North Carolina, United States, shared the name &quot;Red Star Belgrade&quot;.

A football club in Ecuador, in the city of Cuenca, created in 1961, is inspired in Red Star Belgrade. It is named CDS Estrella Roja. Estrella Roja is the translation and the way Red Star is known in Spanish speaking countries. The club crest is even the same as the one Red Star had between 1995 and 2011.

A junior football team called &#x27;Lenadoon Red Star&#x27; played in West Belfast, Northern Ireland, from 1972 to 1975 during the height of The Troubles. The team wrote to Red Star Belgrade in the early 1970s, asking if they could donate any kits to the young team, but Red Star Belgrade wrote back saying they couldn&#x27;t afford to send over any kits.

<text>Radium chloride is an inorganic compound with the chemical formula . It is a radium salt of hydrogen chloride. It was the first radium compound isolated in a pure state. Marie Curie and André-Louis Debierne used it in their original separation of radium from barium. The first preparation of radium metal was by the electrolysis of a solution of this salt using a mercury cathode.

==Preparation==
Radium chloride crystallises from aqueous solution as the dihydrate. The dihydrate is dehydrated by heating to 100 °C in air for one hour followed by 5.5 hours at 520 °C under argon. If the presence of other anions is suspected, the dehydration may be effectuated by fusion under hydrogen chloride.

Radium chloride can also be prepared by heating radium bromide in a flow of dry hydrogen chloride gas. It can be produced by treating radium carbonate with hydrochloric acid.

==Properties==
Radium chloride is a colorless salt with a blue-green luminescence, especially when heated. Its color gradually changes to yellow with aging, whereas contamination by barium may impart a rose tint. It is less soluble in water than other alkaline earth metal chlorides – at 25 °C its solubility is 245 g/L whereas that of barium chloride is 307 g/L, and the difference is even larger in hydrochloric acid solutions. This property is used in the first stages of the separation of radium from barium by fractional crystallization. Radium chloride is only sparingly soluble in azeotropic hydrochloric acid and virtually insoluble in concentrated hydrochloric acid.

Gaseous shows strong absorptions in the visible spectrum at 676.3 nm and 649.8 nm (red): the dissociation energy of the radium–chlorine bond is estimated as 2.9 eV, and its length as 292 pm.

Contrary to diamagnetic barium chloride, radium chloride is weakly paramagnetic with a magnetic susceptibility of 1.05. Its flame color is red.

==Uses==
Radium chloride is still used for the initial stages of the separation of radium from barium during the extraction of radium from pitchblende. The large quantities of material involved (to extract a gram of pure radium metal, about 7 tonnes of pitchblende is required) favour this less costly (but less efficient) method over those based on radium bromide or radium chromate (used for the later stages of the separation).

It was also used in medicine to produce radon gas which in turn was used as a brachytheraputic cancer treatment.

Radium-223 dichloride (USP, radium chloride Ra 223), tradename Xofigo (formerly Alpharadin), is an alpha-emitting radiopharmaceutical. Bayer received FDA approval for this drug to treat prostate cancer osteoblastic bone metastases in May 2013. Radium-223 chloride is one of the most potent ((antineoplastic drugs)) known. One dose (50 kBq/kg) in an adult is about 60 nanograms; this amount is 1/1000 the weight of an eyelash (75 micrograms).

<text>The Spanish Steps () in Rome, Italy, climb a steep slope between Piazza di Spagna at the base and Piazza Trinità dei Monti, dominated by the Trinità dei Monti church, at the top.

The monumental stairway of 135 steps is linked with the Trinità dei Monti church, under the patronage of the Bourbon kings of France, at the top of the steps and the Spanish Embassy to the Holy See in the Palazzo Monaldeschi at the bottom of the steps. The stairway was designed by the architects Francesco de Sanctis and Alessandro Specchi.

==History==

Generations of heated debate over how the steep, slope to the church on a shoulder of the Pincio should be urbanized preceded the final execution. Archival drawings from the 1580s show that Pope Gregory XIII was interested in constructing a stair to the recently completed façade of the French church.

French diplomat to the Holy See Étienne Gueffier died in 1660, leaving part of his fortune for the construction of the stairs. The Roman-educated Cardinal Mazarin took a personal interest in the project and entrusted it to his agent in Rome—whose plan included an equestrian monument of Louis XIV of France—an ambitious intrusion that created a furore in papal Rome. Mazarin died in 1661 and the pope in 1667, while Gueffier&#x27;s will was successfully contested by a nephew who claimed half, so the project lay dormant until Pope Clement XI Albani renewed interest in it in the early 18th century.

A competition held in 1717 was won by Francesco de Sanctis, though Alessandro Specchi was long thought to have produced the winning entry. Little is known of the architect, who was favored by the French in the design process. His drawing was engraved by Girolamo Rossi in 1726, with a long dedication to Louis XV.

The solution is a gigantic inflation of some conventions of terraced garden stairs. The first such divided and symmetrical stairs were devised for the Belvedere Courtyard in the 1600s by Donato Bramante, while shaped and angled steps were introduced by Michelangelo in the vestibule to the Laurentian Library. The Bourbon fleur-de-lys and Innocent XIII&#x27;s eagle and crown are carefully balanced in the sculptural details.

Mid-18th century writers Joseph de Lalande and Charles de Brosses noted that the steps were already in poor condition. They have been restored several times since, including from May to December 1995.

Sponsored by the Italian luxury brand Bulgari (which has its Italian flagship store in the nearby Via dei Condotti) a new renovation commenced on 8 October 2015, with the steps being reopened to the public on 21 September 2016. The restoration of the almost of travertine stone, as well as brick, marble and plaster employed more than 80 people and cost €1.5 million.

Over the years, several city administrations have tried to dissuade visitors from getting too comfortable on the steps, banning loitering and eating, but the ordinances have not been enforced. However, in July 2019 the administration of Mayor Virginia Raggi, as part of an attempt to get ill-mannered tourists to behave themselves in Rome, introduced more stringent ordinances designed to &quot;guarantee decorum, security and legality&quot;. These regulations allow for fines of €250 for sitting down on the steps and up to €400 for dirtying or damaging the steps (including eating on them or pushing a pram up or down them).

==Piazza di Spagna==
In the Piazza di Spagna at the base is the Early Baroque fountain called &quot;Fontana della Barcaccia&quot; (&quot;Fountain of the longboat&quot;), built in 1627–29 and often credited to Pietro Bernini, father of a more famous son, Gian Lorenzo Bernini, who is recently said to have collaborated on the decoration. The elder Bernini had been the pope&#x27;s architect for the Acqua Vergine, since 1623. According to a legend, Pope Urban VIII had the fountain installed after he had been impressed by a boat brought here by a flood of the Tiber.

In the piazza, at the corner on the right as one begins to climb the steps, is the house where English poet John Keats lived and died in 1821; it is now a museum dedicated to his memory, full of memorabilia of the English Romantic generation. On the same right side stands the 15th-century former cardinal Lorenzo Cybo de Mari&#x27;s palace, now Ferrari di Valbona, a building altered in 1936 to designs by Marcello Piacentini, the main city planner during Fascism, with modern terraces perfectly in harmony with the surrounding baroque context.

==Uses==
At the top, the stairway ramp up the &quot;Pincio&quot; which is the Pincian Hill. The Villa Medici can be reached from the top of the steps.

During Christmas time, a 19th-century criba manger is displayed on the first landing of the staircase. During springtime, just before the anniversary of the foundation of Rome on 21 April, part of the steps are covered by pots of azaleas, up until early May. In modern times, the Spanish Steps have included a small cut-flower market. The steps are not a place for eating lunch, being forbidden by Roman urban regulations, but they are usually crowded with people.

==Incidents==
In May 2022, a Saudi national drove a rented Maserati through the steps, descending the first flight of steps before stopping. Fractures were subsequently found on the 16th and 29th steps of the right-hand flight rising up from Piazza di Spagna. The man, who abandoned the car and fled the scene, was later apprehended at Milan Malpensa Airport after being identified through surveillance cameras and was charged with inflicting aggravated damage to cultural heritage and monuments.

In June 2022, two American tourists launched a scooter three times down the steps, damaging the third-to-last travertine step of the second ramp and dislodging a 10-centimeter piece of marble that cost €25,000 ($27,000) in repairs. The couple were apprehended by police, fined €400 each and were banned from the vicinity of the site for two days.

In April 2023, climate protestors from Ultima Generazione poured a charcoal-based black powder into the Fontana della Barcaccia, discoloring its water and leaving stains on its marble surface. The protesters were apprehended by authorities and detained.

== In literature ==
The steps are featured in several literary works. Notable examples include:
* Numerous scenes in Alfred Bester&#x27;s novel &quot;The Stars My Destination&quot; (1956)
* F. Scott Fitzgerald&#x27;s novel &quot;Tender Is the Night&quot; (1933)
* Anthony Burgess&#x27; novel &quot;Abba Abba&quot; (1977)
* Tom Clancy&#x27;s novel &quot;The Teeth of the Tiger&quot; (2003)

==In media==
===In film and TV===
The film &quot;Le Ragazze di Piazza di Spagna&quot; of 1952, directed by Luciano Emmer and starring Liliana Bonfatti, Lucia Bosè, Cosetta Greco, and Marcello Mastroianni, centers on the Spanish Steps.
The film &quot;Roman Holiday&quot; (1953), starring Audrey Hepburn and Gregory Peck featured the Spanish Steps.

In the 1963 Italian giallo film &quot;The Girl Who Knew Too Much&quot;, Nora witnesses a murder on the Spanish Steps.

The apartment that was the setting for &quot;The Roman Spring of Mrs. Stone&quot; (1961) is halfway up on the right. Bernardo Bertolucci&#x27;s &quot;Besieged&quot; (1998) is also set in a house next to the Steps. The Steps were featured prominently in the film version of &quot;The Talented Mr. Ripley&quot; (1999), starring Matt Damon in the title role.

The Spanish Steps are mentioned (as the Spanish Stairs) in the first verse of the song &quot;When I Paint My Masterpiece&quot; (1971).

In a film for German titled &quot;Martha&quot; (1974), directed by Rainer Werner Fassbinder, the father of the title character (played by Margit Carstensen) dies while climbing the Spanish Steps.

In an episode of &quot;Everybody Loves Raymond&quot; (Season 5, Episode 1: Italy) which aired on October 2, 2000, Ray, Debra, Frank, and Marie climb the Spanish Steps during a family vacation in Rome.

An episode of the anime series &quot;Gunslinger Girl&quot;, entitled &quot;Gelato (Ice Cream),&quot; which first aired in 2003, features the protagonist by the Spanish Steps having her &quot;reward&quot; of ice cream after having completed a successful raid.

In the film &quot;To Rome with Love&quot; (2012), Hayley (Alison Pill) and Michelangelo Santoli (Flavio Parenti) met on the Spanish Steps.

The Spanish Steps were the setting of a &#x27;Roadblock&#x27; task during &quot;The Amazing Race 24&quot; (2014) in which contestants had to count the steps.

In the 2000 film “It Had To Be You”, it is the dream of the female lead, a school teacher who has never been out of NYC, to go to the Spanish Steps. She and her love interest imagine they are there while in a fountain in Central Park.

The Spanish Steps are featured in a scene in the film &quot;The Man From U.N.C.L.E.&quot; (2015), in which Illya (Armie Hammer), posing as a Russian architect, attempts to explain to Gaby (Alicia Vikander) that the Steps were actually made by a Russian architect.

Midway through the animated film &quot;Love Live! The School Idol Movie: Over the Rainbow&quot; (2019), the Steps were featured prominently as the site where the main idol group Aqours performed the main musical number of the film, &quot;Hop? Stop? Nonstop!,&quot; during their overseas trip from Numazu, Japan to Rome.

The Spanish Steps feature in car action scene in &quot;Fast X&quot; (2023).

The Spanish Steps feature in a car chase in &quot;&quot;. The end credits assure the viewer that, for the car chase, a replica on a studio backlot was used. The film also premiered on the Spanish Steps on June 19, 2023.

The Spanish Steps appear as part of the Rome Avanti course in &quot;Mario Kart Tour&quot; and subsequently in &quot;Mario Kart 8 Deluxe&quot;, being added to both games in 2023.

=== In art ===
On 16 January 2008, the Italian artist Graziano Cecchini covered the Spanish Steps with hundreds of thousands of multicolored plastic balls. He claimed it was done to raise international awareness of the situation of the Karen people in Myanmar, and as a protest against the living conditions of artists in Italy.

<text>Eduardo Estrada Palomo(; (México City; May 13, 1962 – Los Angeles; November 6, 2003) was a Mexican actor. Palomo became famous across Mexico and Latin America after his 1993 Juan del Diablo characterization in &quot;Corazón salvaje&quot;.

==Career==
He started acting in theatre at the age of 12 and found fame with the success of &quot;Corazón salvaje&quot;. He went on to make several other successful telenovelas and films in México. He also recorded an album titled &quot;Mover El Tiempo&quot; in early 1994.

He was determined not to star in any other soap opera after &quot;Ramona&quot; (co-starring with Kate del Castillo), but the sequel to &quot;Corazón salvaje&quot; was something he could not refuse. He was working on a Los Angeles production of the play &quot;Una Pareja Con Ángel&quot; (written by Palomo and previously produced in Mexico) when he died.

Palomo was in the process of &quot;crossing-over&quot; to American television audiences where he guest starred on shows such as Arrested Development, &quot;Kingpin&quot; and was to star in a CBS series. His last role was in &quot;A Day Without a Mexican&quot; (2004).

==Personal life==
Palomo was one of Jesús Estrada and Miliza Palomo&#x27;s sons. His siblings were brother Jesús Jr. and sister Susana.

Palomo married the singer and actress Carina Ricco on November 26, 1994. They had two children; daughter Fiona and son Luca.

He moved from his native México to pursue a career in Hollywood.

==Death==
On the night of November 6, 2003, Palomo, wife Carina Ricco along with friends Sergio Arau and wife Yareli Arizmendi were on a night out in L.A.&#x27;s Melrose Avenue. Sometime between 10 and 10:30 pm (PT), Palomo while breaking out in laughter, slowly began tilting his head forward almost simulating as if he were to be falling asleep. About five to fifteen minutes had passed by before anyone noticed he was actually unresponsive. Arau and Arizmendi performed CPR attempts to no avail. Paramedics arrived at the scene within ten minutes, CPR was once again attempted but proved unsuccessful. It was then declared that Palomo had died at the scene due to a sudden heart attack. He was 41 years old.

<text>William Julius Wilson (born December 20, 1935) is an American sociologist, a professor at Harvard University, and an author of works on urban sociology, race, and class issues. Laureate of the National Medal of Science, he served as the 80th President of the American Sociological Association, was a member of numerous national boards and commissions. He identified the importance of neighborhood effects and demonstrated how limited employment opportunities and weakened institutional resources exacerbated poverty within American inner-city neighborhoods.

==Career ==
Wilson is Lewis P. and Linda L. Geyser University Professor at Harvard University. He is one of 25 University Professors, the highest professional distinction for a Harvard faculty member. After receiving a PhD from Washington State University in 1966, Wilson taught sociology at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, before joining the University of Chicago faculty in 1972. In 1990 he was appointed the Lucy Flower University Professor and director of the University of Chicago&#x27;s Center for the Study of Urban Inequality. 

He joined the faculty at Harvard in July 1996. He is affiliated with the Malcolm Wiener Center for Social Policy at the Harvard Kennedy School, the Hutchins Center for African and African American Research, and Harvard&#x27;s Department of Sociology. He is a member of the Library of Congress Scholars Council.

Wilson was an original board member of the progressive Century Institute, and a current board member at Philadelphia-based Public/Private Ventures, PolicyLink, and the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. He was Sudhir Venkatesh&#x27;s advisor when Venkatesh was a PhD student at the University of Chicago.

===Publications===
Wilson is the author of &quot;Power Racism and Privilege: Race Relations in Theoretical and Sociohistorical Perspectives&quot; (1973, 1976), &quot;The Declining Significance of Race: Blacks and Changing American Institutions&quot; (1978, 1980, 2012), winner of the American Sociological Association&#x27;s Sydney Spivack Award; &quot;The Truly Disadvantaged: The Inner City, the Underclass, and Public Policy&quot; (1987, 2012), which was selected by the editors of the &quot;New York Times Book Review&quot; as one of the 16 best books of 1987, and received &quot;The Washington Monthly&quot; Annual Book Award, the Society for the Study of Social Problems&#x27; C. Wright Mills Award and the American Political Science Association&#x27;s Aaron Wildavsky Enduring Contribution Award; &quot;When Work Disappears: The World of the New Urban Poor&quot; (1996), which was selected as one of the notable books of 1996 by the editors of the &quot;New York Times Book Review&quot; and received the 1997 Hillman Prize and the American Political Science Association&#x27;s Aaron Wildavsky Enduring Contribution Award; and &quot;The Bridge Over the Racial Divide: Rising Inequality and Coalition Politics&quot;. More recently, he is the co-author of &quot;There Goes the Neighborhood: Racial, Ethnic, and Class Tensions in Four Chicago Neighborhoods and Their Meaning for America&quot; (2006), and &quot;Good Kids in Bad Neighborhoods: Successful Development in Social Context&quot; (2006); and author of &quot;More than Just Race: Being Black and Poor in the Inner City&quot; (2009).

In &quot;The Declining Significance of Race: Blacks and Changing American Institutions&quot; (1978) Wilson argues that the significance of race is waning, and that for African Americans, class is comparatively more important in determining their life chances. In &quot;The Truly Disadvantaged: The Inner City, the Underclass, and Public Policy&quot; (1987), Wilson was one of the first to enunciate at length the &quot;spatial mismatch&quot; theory for the development of a ghetto underclass. As industrial jobs disappeared in cities in the wake of global economic restructuring, and hence urban unemployment increased, women found it unwise to marry the fathers of their children since the fathers would not be breadwinners. In &quot;The Truly Disadvantaged&quot; Wilson also argued against Charles Murray&#x27;s theory of welfare causing poverty.

In Wilson&#x27;s most recent book, &quot;More Than Just Race: Being Black and Poor in the Inner City&quot; (2009), he directs his attention to the overall framing of pervasive, concentrated urban poverty of African Americans. He asks the question, &quot;Why do poverty and unequal opportunity persist in the lives of so many African Americans?&quot; In response, he traces the history and current state of powerful structural factors impacting African Americans, such as discrimination in laws, policies, hiring, housing, and education. Wilson also examines the interplay of structural factors and the attitudes and assumptions of African Americans, European Americans, and social science researchers. In identifying the dynamic influence of structural, economic, and cultural factors, he argues against either/or politicized views of poverty among African Americans that either focus blame solely on cultural factors or only on unjust structural factors. He tries &quot;to demonstrate the importance of understanding not only the independent contributions of social structure and culture but also how they interact to shape different group outcomes that embody racial inequality.&quot; Wilson&#x27;s goal is to &quot;rethink the way we talk about addressing the problems of race and urban poverty in the public policy arena.&quot;

===Influence===
Wilson&#x27;s book &quot;When Work Disappears&quot; has been cited as an inspiration for the second season of the HBO show &quot;The Wire&quot;.

==Criticism of his work==
Beginning with &quot;The Declining Significance of Race&quot;, Wilson&#x27;s work has attracted a great deal of controversy and criticism, see for example Wilson&#x27;s &quot;The Declining Significance of Race&quot;.

In his book &quot;Still the Promised City? African-Americans and New Immigrants in Postindustrial New York,&quot; Roger Waldinger, a professor of Sociology at the University of California, Los Angeles, provides a critique of arguments advanced by Wilson in &quot;The Truly Disadvantaged.&quot; In particular, Waldinger challenges Wilson&#x27;s argument that the labor market problems African Americans face today are largely due to deindustrialization and consequent skills mismatches. Waldinger argues that, on one hand, African Americans never were especially dependent on jobs in the manufacturing sector, so deindustrialization in itself has not had a major impact on African Americans, and that, on the other hand, the relative labor market success of poorly educated immigrants suggests that there is no absence of jobs for those with few skills in the post-industrial era (see Anthony Orum&#x27;s review of the book). One limitation to the full credibility of Waldinger&#x27;s study, however, is that it is based entirely on research in New York City and, therefore, its findings are difficult to generalize to cities such as Detroit, Baltimore, Philadelphia, Cleveland, and others where blacks were indeed concentrated in the manufacturing sector.

The concept of &#x27;the ghetto&#x27; and &#x27;underclass&#x27; has faced criticism both empirically and theoretically. Research has shown significant differences in resources for neighborhoods with similar populations both across cities and over time. This includes differences in the resources of neighborhoods with predominantly low income and/or racial minority populations. It has been argued that the cause of these differences in resources across similar neighborhoods likely has more to do with dynamics outside of the neighborhood.

===Honors===
Past President of the American Sociological Association, Wilson has received 45 honorary degrees, including honorary doctorates from Yale, Princeton University, Columbia University, the University of Pennsylvania, Northwestern University, Johns Hopkins University, New York University, Bard College, Dartmouth College, and the University of Amsterdam in the Netherlands. A MacArthur Prize Fellow from 1987 to 1992, Wilson has been elected to the National Academy of Sciences, the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, the National Academy of Education, the American Philosophical Society, the Institute of Medicine, and the British Academy. In June 1996 he was selected by &quot;Time&quot; magazine as one of America&#x27;s 25 Most Influential People. In 1997, he received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement. He is a recipient of the 1998 National Medal of Science, the highest scientific honor in the United States, and was awarded the Talcott Parsons Prize in the Social Sciences by the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 2003; the Daniel Patrick Moynihan Prize by the &quot;Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science&quot; in 2013; the Robert and Helen Lynd Award for Distinguished Career Achievement by the Community and Urban Section of the American Sociological Association in 2013; and the W.E.B. Du Bois Career of Distinguished Scholarship Award by the American Sociological Association in 2014, the highest award bestowed by the American Sociological Association.

Other honors granted to Wilson include the Seidman Award in Political Economy (the first and only non-economist to receive the award); the Golden Plate Achievement Award; the Distinguished Alumnus Award, Washington State University; the American Sociological Association&#x27;s Dubois, Johnson, Frazier Award (for significant scholarship in the field of inter-group relations); the American Sociological Association&#x27;s Award for Public Understanding of Sociology; Burton Gordon Feldman Award (&quot;for outstanding contributions in the field of public policy&quot;) Brandeis University; and the Martin Luther King Jr. National Award (granted by the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, Los Angeles); the Diverse: Issues in Higher Education&#x27;s John Hope Franklin Award; Everett Mendelsohn Excellence in Mentoring Award, Harvard University; and the Anisfield-Wolf Book Award for Lifetime Achievement in Nonfiction. He was designated a Walter Channing Cabot Fellow at Harvard University for 2009–2010. And in 2012, the Inequality, Poverty, and Mobility Section of the American Sociological Association renamed its Early Career Award as the William Julius Wilson Early Career Award.

Wilson also served on a member of numerous national boards and commissions including, the Social Science Research Council, Spelman College, Bard College, National Humanities Center, Levy Economic Institute and Manpower Demonstration Research Corporation. He was previously the Chair of the Board of the Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences and of the Russell Sage Foundation.

In 2010, Wilson received the Anisfield-Wolf Book Award Lifetime Achievement Award in Nonfiction.
