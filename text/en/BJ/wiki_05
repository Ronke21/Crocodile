<text>Sir John Forrest (22 August 1847 – 2 September 1918) was an Australian explorer and politician. He was the first premier of Western Australia (1890–1901) and a long-serving cabinet minister in federal politics.

Forrest was born in Bunbury, Western Australia, to Scottish immigrant parents. He was the colony&#x27;s first locally born surveyor, coming to public notice in 1869 when he led an expedition into the interior in search of Ludwig Leichhardt. The following year, Forrest accomplished the first land crossing from Perth to Adelaide across the Nullarbor Plain. His third expedition in 1874 travelled from Geraldton to Adelaide through the centre of Australia. Forrest&#x27;s expeditions were characterised by a cautious, well-planned approach and diligent record-keeping. He received the Patron&#x27;s Medal of the Royal Geographical Society in 1876.

Forrest became involved in politics through his promotion to surveyor-general, a powerful position that entitled him to a seat on the colony&#x27;s executive council. He was appointed as Western Australia&#x27;s first premier in 1890, following the granting of responsible government. The gold rushes of the early 1890s saw a large increase in the colony&#x27;s population and allowed for a program of public works, including the construction of Fremantle Harbour and the Goldfields Water Supply Scheme. Forrest&#x27;s government also passed a number of social reforms, maintaining power through several elections in an era before formal political parties. His support for Federation was crucial in Western Australia&#x27;s decision to join as an original member.

In 1901, Forrest was invited to join Prime Minister Edmund Barton&#x27;s inaugural federal cabinet. He was a member of all but one non-Labor government over the following two decades, serving as Postmaster-General (1901), Minister for Defence (1901–1903), Minister for Home Affairs (1903–1904), and Treasurer (1905–1907, 1909–1910, 1913–1914, 1917–1918). He helped shape Australia&#x27;s early defence and financial policies, also lobbying for the construction of the Trans-Australian Railway, a pet project. Forrest served briefly as acting prime minister in 1907 and in 1913 was defeated for the leadership of the Liberal Party by a single vote. He was nominated to the peerage in 1918 by Prime Minister Billy Hughes, but died on his way to England before the appointment could be confirmed.

==Early life==

===Birth and family background===
Forrest was born on 22 August 1847 on his father&#x27;s property outside of Bunbury, Western Australia. He was the fourth of ten children and third of nine sons born to Margaret (née Hill) and William Forrest. The couple&#x27;s first child and only daughter, Mary, died as an infant. John&#x27;s younger brothers included Alexander and David Forrest, who became public figures in their own right.

Forrest&#x27;s parents had arrived from Scotland in December 1842, accompanying Dr John Ferguson to work as domestic servants on his farm in the newly settled district of Australind. Margaret was from Dundee and William from Kincardineshire; the Forrest paternal line originated from the village of Glenbervie. They were released from Ferguson&#x27;s service in 1846, and William took up a property at the mouth of the Preston River on the eastern side of the Leschenault Estuary. He built a windmill and a small house, where John was born.

===Childhood and education===
A few years after Forrest&#x27;s birth, the family moved down the Preston River to Picton, where William built a homestead and watermill. The family&#x27;s youngest son, Augustus, drowned in the mill race as a toddler. The mill was primarily used as a flour mill, at a time when flour was a scarce commodity, but was also used as a sawmill. Its success allowed William to expand his land holdings to and gave the family a high social status in the small district around Bunbury. The property remains in the ownership of his descendants and is now heritage-listed.

Forrest and his brothers began their education at the one-room school in Bunbury, walking or riding in each direction. His parents prized education, and in 1860 he was sent to Perth to board at Bishop Hale&#x27;s School, the only secondary school in the colony. He attended the school for four years, winning several prizes for arithmetic. Although three of William Forrest&#x27;s sons became members of parliament, he had no involvement in public life beyond a local level and was not known to hold strong political opinions. According to John Forrest&#x27;s biographer Frank Crowley, &quot;William Forrest&#x27;s greatest gift to his sons was not a precise political creed but the practical approach to life that he had acquired as a tradesman, farmer and jack-of-all-trades&quot;.

===Early career===
In November 1863, aged 16, Forrest took up an apprenticeship with Thomas Campbell Carey, the government surveyor at Bunbury. He had already been taught celestial navigation by his father, and under Carey learned the basic techniques of surveying, becoming proficient in traversing and the use of surveyors&#x27; tools, including Gunter&#x27;s chains, prismatic compasses, sextants, and transit theodolites. He was also a skilled horseman and able to endure long periods in the bush without access to fresh meat and vegetables.

After two years as an apprentice to Carey, Forrest was appointed as a government surveyor on a provisional basis. He was the first person born in Western Australia to qualify as a surveyor. His term of employment began on 28 December 1865, at the age of 18, and he was assigned three assistants – a chainer, a camp-keeper, and a convict on probation. Although he was headquartered in Bunbury, Forrest spent most of his time in the field, surveying the Nelson, Sussex, and Wellington land districts. His position was made permanent in July 1866, and he spent most of the next two years in the Avon Valley.

==Marriage==
On 2 September 1876 in Perth, Forrest married Margaret Elvire Hamersley. The Hamersleys were a very wealthy family, and Forrest gained substantially in wealth and social standing from the marriage. However, to their disappointment the marriage was childless. Despite not having direct descendants his family has continued to be influential in Western Australia via his nephew Mervyn Forrest and Mervyn&#x27;s grandson mining billionaire Andrew Forrest.

==Explorer==
Between 1869 and 1874, Forrest led three expeditions into the uncharted land surrounding the colony of Western Australia. In 1869, he led a fruitless search for the explorer Ludwig Leichhardt in the desert west of the site of the present town of Leonora. The following year, he surveyed Edward John Eyre&#x27;s land route, from Perth to Adelaide. In 1874, he led a party to the watershed of the Murchison River and then east through the unknown desert centre of Western Australia. Forrest published an account of his expeditions, &quot;Explorations in Australia&quot;, in 1875. In 1882, he was made a Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George (CMG) by Queen Victoria for his services in exploring the interior.

===Search for Ludwig Leichhardt===
In March 1869, Forrest was asked to lead an expedition in search of Leichhardt, who had been missing since April 1848. A few years earlier, a party of Aborigines had told the explorer Charles Hunt that a group of white men had been killed by Aborigines a long time ago, and some time afterwards, an Aboriginal tracker named Jemmy Mungaro had corroborated their story and claimed to have personally been to the location. Since it was thought that these stories might refer to Leichhardt&#x27;s party, Forrest was asked to lead a party to the site, with Mungaro as their guide and there to search for evidence of Leichhardt&#x27;s fate.

Forrest assembled a party of six, including the Aboriginal trackers Mungaro and Tommy Windich, and they left Perth on 15 April 1869. They headed in a north-easterly direction, passing through the colony&#x27;s furthermost sheep station on 26 April. On 6 May, they encountered a group of Aborigines who offered to guide the party to a place where there were many skeletons of horses. Forrest&#x27;s team accompanied this group in a more northerly direction, but after a week of travelling it became clear that their destination was Poison Rock, where the explorer Robert Austin was known to have left eleven of his horses for dead in 1854. They then turned once more towards the location indicated by their guide.

The team arrived in the location to be searched on 28 May. They then spent almost three weeks surveying and searching an area of about 15,000 km2 in the desert west of the site of the present-day town of Leonora. Having found no evidence of Leichhardt&#x27;s fate, and Mungaro having changed his story and admitted that he had not personally visited the site, they decided to push as far eastwards as they could on their remaining supplies. The expedition reached its furthest point east on 2 July, near the present-day site of the town of Laverton. They then turned for home, returning by a more northerly route and arriving back in Perth on 6 August.

They had been absent for 113 days, and had travelled, by Forrest&#x27;s reckoning, over , most of it through uncharted desert. They had found no sign of Leichhardt, and the country over which they travelled was useless for farming. However, Forrest did report that his compass had been affected by the presence of minerals in the ground, and he suggested that the government send geologists to examine the area. Ultimately, the expedition achieved very little, but it was of great personal advantage to Forrest whose reputation with his superiors and in the community at large was greatly enhanced.

===Bight crossing===

Later that year, Forrest was selected to lead an expedition that would survey a land route along the Great Australian Bight between the colonies of South Australia and Western Australia. Eyre had achieved such a crossing 30 years earlier, but his expedition had been poorly planned and equipped, and Eyre had nearly perished from lack of water. Forrest&#x27;s expedition would follow Eyre&#x27;s route, but it would be thoroughly planned and properly resourced. Also, the recent discovery of safe anchorages at Israelite Bay and Eucla would permit Forrest&#x27;s team to be reprovisioned along the way by a chartered schooner &quot;Adur&quot;. Forrest&#x27;s brief was to provide a proper survey of the route, which might be used in future to establish a telegraph link between the colonies and also to assess the suitability of the land for pasture.

Forrest&#x27;s team consisted of six men his brother Alexander was second in charge, Police constable Hector Neil McLarty, farrier William Osborn, trackers Tommy Windich and Billy Noongale (Kickett); 15 horses. The party left Perth on 30 March 1870, and arrived at Esperance on 24 April. Heavy rain fell for much of this time.

After resting and reprovisioning, the party left Esperance on 9 May and arrived at Israelite Bay nine days later. They had encountered very little feed for their horses and no permanent water, but they managed to obtain sufficient rain water from rock water-holes. After reprovisioning, the team left for Eucla on 30 May. Again, they encountered very little feed and no permanent water, and this time the water they obtained from rock water-holes was not sufficient. They were compelled to dash more than to a spot that Eyre had found water in 1841. Having secured a water source, they rested and explored the area before moving on, eventually reaching Eucla on 2 July. At Eucla, they rested and reprovisioned and explored inland, where they found good pasture land. On 14 July, the team started the final leg of their expedition through unsettled country: from Eucla to the nearest South Australian station. During the last leg, almost no water could be found, and the team were compelled to travel day and night for nearly five days. They saw their first signs of civilisation on 18 July and eventually reached Adelaide on 27 August.

A week later, they boarded ship for Western Australia, arriving in Perth on 27 September. They were honoured at two receptions: one by the Perth City Council and a citizens&#x27; banquet at the Horse and Groom Tavern. Speaking at the receptions, Forrest was modest about his own contributions, but praised the efforts of the members of the expedition and divided a government gratuity between them.

Forrest&#x27;s bight crossing was one of the most organised and best managed expeditions of his time. As a result, his party successfully completed in five months a journey that had taken Eyre twelve and arrived in good health and without the loss of a single horse. From that point of view, the expedition must be considered a success.

However, the tangible results were not great. They had not travelled far from Eyre&#x27;s track, and although a large area was surveyed, only one small area of land suitable for pasture was found. A second expedition by the same team returned to the area between August and November 1871 and found further good pastures, north-north-east of Esperance.

===Across interior===

In August 1872, Forrest was invited to lead a third expedition, from Geraldton to the source of the Murchison River and then east through the uncharted centre of Western Australia to the overland telegraph line from Darwin to Adelaide. The purpose was to discover the nature of the unknown centre of Western Australia, and to find new pastoral land.

Forrest&#x27;s team again consisted of six men, including his brother Alexander and Windich. They also had 20 horses and food for eight months. The team left Geraldton on 1 April 1874, and a fortnight later, it passed through the colony&#x27;s outermost station. On 3 May the team passed into unknown land. It found plenty of good pastoral land around the headwaters of the Murchison River, but by late May, it was travelling over arid land. On 2 June, while dangerously short of water, it discovered Weld Springs, &quot;one of the best springs in the colony&quot; according to Forrest. This later became Well 9 of the Canning Stock Route, but it proved unreliable as a water source.

At Weld Springs, the party came into conflict with a group of Martu people. In his diary, Forrest recorded that 40 to 60 men had appeared on the hill overlooking the springs, &quot;all plumed up and armed with spears and shields&quot;. They then rushed towards the camp brandishing spears, to which Forrest and his party responded by firing their weapons. The group retreated up the hill before charging again, and more shots were fired. On the following day, Forrest found blood near the camp, speculating that two men had been shot and at least one had suffered a severe wound. Fearing another attack, Forrest and his men constructed a stone hut (or &quot;fort&quot;) with a thatched roof, approximately high and by in area. There were no further confrontations between the groups. According to Martu oral history, the initial conflict occurred after one of the white men approached Martu singing around a fire and was threatened with a spear. The second incident occurred after the fort was built and resulted in some of their men being killed. It has been suggested that the expedition may have intruded upon a ceremonial gathering.

Beyond Weld Springs water was extremely hard to obtain, and by 4 July the team relied on occasional thunderstorms for water. By 2 August, the team was critically short of water; a number of horses had been abandoned, and Forrest&#x27;s journal indicates that the team had little confidence of survival. A few days later, it was rescued by a shower of rain. On 23 August, it was again critically short of water and half of their horses were near death, when they were saved by the discovery of Elder Springs.

Then, the land became somewhat less arid, and the risk of dying from thirst started to abate. Other difficulties continued, however: the team had to abandon more of their horses, and one member of the team suffered from scurvy and could barely walk. The team finally sighted the telegraph line near Mount Alexander on 27 September and reached Peake Telegraph Station three days later. The remainder of the journey was a succession of triumphant public receptions by passing through each country town en route to Adelaide. The team reached Adelaide on 3 November 1874, more than six months after they started from Geraldton.

From an exploration point of view, Forrest&#x27;s third expedition was of great importance. A large area of previously unknown land was explored, and the popular notion of an inland sea was shown to be unlikely. However, the practical results were not great. Plenty of good pastoral land was found up to the head of the Murchison, but beyond that, the land was useless for pastoral enterprise, and Forrest was convinced that it would never be settled. Forrest also made botanical collections during the expedition that were given to Ferdinand von Mueller, who, in turn, named &quot;Eremophila forrestii&quot; in his honour.

In 1875, Forrest published &quot;Explorations in Australia&quot;, an account of his three expeditions. In July 1876, he was awarded the Patron&#x27;s Medal of the Royal Geographical Society of London. He was made a CMG by Queen Victoria in 1882 for his services in exploring the interior.

==Colonial politics==

Forrest was an outstanding surveyor, and his successful expeditions had made him a popular public figure as well. Consequently, he was promoted rapidly through the ranks of the Lands and Surveys Department, and in January 1883 he succeeded Malcolm Fraser in the positions of surveyor-general and commissioner of crown lands. This was one of the most powerful and responsible positions in the colony, and it accorded him a seat on the colony&#x27;s Executive Council. At the same time, Forrest was nominated to the colony&#x27;s Legislative Council.

==Premier (1890–1901)==
After Britain ceded to Western Australia the right to self-rule in 1890, Forrest was elected unopposed to the seat of Bunbury in the Legislative Assembly. On 22 December 1890, Governor William Robinson appointed Forrest the first Premier of Western Australia. In May of the following year, he was knighted KCMG for his services to the colony.

===Programme===

The Forrest Ministry immediately embarked on a programme of large-scale public works funded by loans raised in London. Public works were greatly in demand at the time, because of the British government&#x27;s reluctance to approve public spending in the colony. Under the direction of the brilliant engineer C. Y. O&#x27;Connor, many thousands of miles of railway were laid, and many bridges, jetties, lighthouses and town halls were constructed. The two most ambitious projects were the Fremantle Harbour Works, one of the few public works of the 1890s which is still in use today; and the Goldfields Water Supply Scheme, one of the greatest engineering feats of its time, in which the Helena River was dammed and the water piped over to Kalgoorlie. Forrest&#x27;s public works programme was generally well received, although on the Eastern Goldfields where the rate of population growth and geographical expansion far outstripped the government&#x27;s ability to provide works, Forrest was criticised for not doing enough. He invited further criticism in 1893 with his infamous &quot;spoils to the victors&quot; speech, in which he appeared to assert that members who opposed the government were putting at risk their constituents&#x27; access to their fair share of public works.

Forrest&#x27;s government also implemented a number of social reforms, including measures to improve the status of women, young girls and wage-earners. However, although Forrest did not always oppose proposals for social reform, he never instigated or championed them. Critics have therefore argued that Forrest deserves little credit for the social reforms achieved under his premiership. On political reform, however, Forrest&#x27;s influence was unquestionable. In 1893, Forrest guided through parliament a number of significant amendments to the Constitution of Western Australia, including an extension of the franchise to all men regardless of property ownership. He also had a significant role in repealing section 70 of that constitution, which had provided that 1% of public revenue should be paid to a Board (not under local political control) for the welfare of Indigenous people, and was &quot;widely hated&quot; by the colonists.

===Federation===
The major political question of the time, though, was federation. Forrest was in favour of federation, and felt that it was inevitable, but he also felt that Western Australia should not join until it obtained fair terms. He was heavily involved in the framing of the Australian Constitution, representing Western Australia at a number of meetings on federation, including the National Australasian Convention of 1891, and the Australasian Federal Convention of 1897–8. There he opposed the transfer of postal and telegraphic services to the projected Commonwealth as an &quot;absurdity&quot;, and declared only a &quot;lunatic&quot; would want the federal capital located in the interior of the country. He fought hard to protect the rights of the less populous states, arguing for a strong upper house organised along state lines. He also pressed for a number of concessions to Western Australia, managing to secure the phasing out of Western Australian tariffs instead of their immediate abolition, but failing to secure the construction of a trans-Australian railway.

The proposed federation was unpopular with the section of society Forrest represented. Only two of this 30 or so supporters in parliament, he said, favoured it. And 62 percent of voters in his electorate of Bunbury were to vote No when the question was put to them by referendum. But support on the goldfields was overwhelming, and by May of 1900 it was apparent his efforts could not obtain better terms. Forrest decided on a referendum, a large majority of Western Australians voted to join the federation, and in 1901 Western Australia was an &quot;original state&quot; of the new Commonwealth of Australia.

==Federal politics==
===First federal ministry under Barton===

On 30 December 1900, Forrest accepted the position of Postmaster-General in Edmund Barton&#x27;s federal caretaker government. Two days later, he received news that he had been made a GCMG &quot;in recognition of services in connection with the Federation of Australian Colonies and the establishment of the Commonwealth of Australia&quot;. Forrest was postmaster-general for only 17 days: he resigned to take up the defence portfolio, which had been made vacant by the death of Sir James Dickson. On 13 February 1901, he resigned as premier of Western Australia and as member for Bunbury.

In the March 1901 federal election, the first one ever, Forrest was elected, unopposed, on a moderate Protectionist platform to the federal House of Representatives seat of Swan. He held the defence portfolio for over two years. After a cabinet reshuffle on 7 August 1903, he became Minister for Home Affairs. In that portfolio, he resolutely pressed the ill-starred project to site the national capital at Dalgety, despite having previously dismissed any location within Australia&#x27;s interior as lunacy.

===Deakin governments===
The December 1903 federal election greatly weakened the governing party. Shortly afterwards, it was defeated and replaced by a Labour government under Chris Watson. Forrest moved to the crossbenches, where he was a scathing critic of the Labour government&#x27;s policies and legislation. After George Reid&#x27;s Free Trade Party took office in August 1904, he remained on the crossbenches but largely supported the government.

Throughout the process to select Australia&#x27;s national capital site, Forrest was a firm supporter of Dalgety.

In June 1905, Alfred Deakin&#x27;s Protectionist Party formed an alliance with Labour to end Reid&#x27;s government. They formed a new government on 7 July, with Forrest appointed Treasurer, as fifth in seniority. After a ministerial reshuffle in October 1906, Forrest became third in cabinet precedence. He served as acting prime minister from 18 to 26 June 1907, as both Deakin and Lyne were in London attending imperial conferences.

The alliance with Labour had put Forrest in a difficult position, as he had repeatedly opposed it. Before the December 1906 federal election, he continued to attack the Labour Party despite sharing government with it and depending on its support. In the following months, Forrest was himself heavily criticised in the press for his willingness to work with the Labour Party when Cabinet was in session and for his attacks on the party during election campaigns.

He began to feel that his reputation in Western Australia and his personal standing in cabinet were being undermined. In response, he resigned as treasurer on 30 July 1907 and joined the crossbenches, where he was a mild critic of the government.

A few months later, Labour withdrew its support for Deakin&#x27;s government, forcing it to resign. Labour then formed government under Andrew Fisher. In the following months, Forrest and a number of other members worked to arrange a fusion of the Free Trade and Protectionist parties into a single party. Eventually, the Commonwealth Liberal Party was formed, with Deakin as leader. Fisher was then forced to resign, and the new Liberal Party took office on 2 June 1909, with Forrest as treasurer. Labour reclaimed office at the April 1910 federal election.

===1910s===

Early in 1913, Deakin resigned as Leader of the Opposition. Forrest and Joseph Cook contested the leadership, with Cook winning by a single vote. Forrest was very disappointed, especially since Deakin, whom he considered a friend, had voted against him. Five months later, in the May 1913 federal election, the Liberal Party returned to power, with Cook as Prime Minister. Forrest was appointed treasurer for the third time. However, the government&#x27;s majority of just one seat in the House of Representatives, along with Labor&#x27;s large majority in the Senate, made it difficult to get anything done. In June 1914, Cook asked the Governor-General for a double dissolution, and Australia was sent back to the polls. Forrest retained his seat, but the Liberal Party was soundly defeated and Forrest was again relegated to the crossbenches.

In December 1916, a split in the Labor Party over conscription left Prime Minister Billy Hughes with a minority government. Hughes and his colleagues formed the National Labor Party, and the Liberal Party joined with it in the formation of a new government. For the fourth time, Forrest was appointed treasurer. The National Labor and Liberal parties easily won a combined majority at the May 1917 election, and the two parties soon merged to form the Nationalist Party of Australia.

On 20 December, a referendum on conscription was defeated, and Hughes kept his promise to resign as prime minister if the referendum was lost. Forrest immediately declared himself a candidate for the position, but the Governor-General found that Forrest did not have the numbers and so asked Hughes to form government again. Hughes accepted, and the previous government was again sworn in.

==Illness, peerage and death==

Forrest had a rodent ulcer removed from his left temple in January 1915, which was initially thought to be non-malignant. Another operation followed in Perth in March 1917, but the cancer returned. He had a third operation in January 1918, after which he was hospitalised for nearly two weeks. The surgeons buried radium in the wound in that hopes that it would help prevent a recurrence. Forrest spent a month recuperating in Healesville; on a visit to the Melbourne Club during this time he was found to weigh . He resigned from the ministry on 21 March 1918, on the advice of his doctors. William Watt had been acting as treasurer in his absence and was appointed as his replacement.

On 7 February 1918, Forrest was informed by the Governor-General that he would be raised to the Peerage of the United Kingdom as 1st Baron Forrest of Bunbury. The honour was granted on the advice of Hughes, who was aware that it would signal the end of Forrest&#x27;s political career. It had been suggested to Hughes two years earlier by John Langdon Bonython. Forrest would have been the first Australian peer, and the announcement was received critically from those opposed to the granting of hereditary honours, including many of Hughes&#x27; former ALP colleagues. However, Forrest&#x27;s peerage was never formalised, as no letters patent were issued before his death. His barony is not listed in &quot;The Complete Peerage&quot;.

Faced with declining health, Forrest decided to travel to London to seek assistance from specialists in London, accompanied by his wife and a nurse. Before he left he revised his will and made arrangements for his burial. He also hoped to take his seat in the House of Lords if his health permitted. Forrest left Albany aboard the troopship &quot;Marathon&quot; on 30 July 1918. He spent two nights in a private hospital when the ship stopped in Durban, South Africa, but returned to the ship and celebrated his 71st birthday on 22 August &quot;in considerable pain&quot;. He died at sea on 2 September 1918, three hours away from Freetown, Sierra Leone.

Forrest was initially interred at the military cemetery in Freetown. His body was brought back to Western Australia and buried at Karrakatta Cemetery on 7 May 1919. His death occasioned the 1918 Swan by-election, which saw the 22-year-old ALP candidate Edwin Corboy become Australia&#x27;s youngest member of parliament, a record not broken until 2010.

==Character==
He was a tall, heavily built man; in his later years, he tended towards stoutness, and he had a mass of about when he died. He was fond of pomp and ceremony and insisted on being treated with respect at all times. Highly sensitive to criticism, he hated having his authority challenged and tended to browbeat his political opponents. He had very little sense of humour and was greatly offended when a journalist playfully referred to him as the &quot;Commissioner for Crown Sands&quot;.

His upbringing and education were said by his biographer, F. K. Crowley, to have installed in him &quot;a heady compound of social snobbery, laissez-faire capitalism, sentimental royalism, patriotic Anglicanism, benevolent imperialism and racial superiority&quot;. He was, however, a very popular figure who treated everyone he met with politeness and dignity. He was renowned for his memory for names and faces and for his prolific letter-writing.

However, as reported in &quot;The Ballarat Star&quot; on 12 July 1907, Forrest defended the use of neckchains to restrain enslaved indigenous captives, saying &quot;Chaining aborigines by the neck is the only effective way of preventing their escape.&quot;

===Racial views===
Forrest took a paternalistic and patronising attitude toward Indigenous Australians. He supported assimilation policies, and his views were considered liberal by contemporary Western Australian standards. In 1883, in one of his first speeches to parliament, he referred to Aboriginal people being &quot;hunted like dogs&quot; and said they were owed &quot;something more than repression&quot;. In the same speech he stated that they should not be punished too severely as they were &quot;to a great extent like children&quot;. He further described Aboriginal people in an 1892 address to the National History Society as &quot;in the same category as Marsupialia in having a very low degree of intelligence&quot;, but was impressed with their complex traditions and hoped they would be recorded before the race &quot;died out&quot;. In 1890, he submitted an anthropological paper on marriage in north-west Australia to the Australasian Association for the Advancement of Science, along with &quot;a brief appeal to preserve the Aboriginal race and its culture from extinction&quot;.

A study by Elizabeth Goddard and Tom Stannage of Forrest&#x27;s public statements on Aboriginal people concluded that he was &quot;locked into and promoted an ideology of development which had racism at its heart&quot;. In 1886, as surveyor-general, he introduced the &quot;Aborigines Protection Act 1886&quot; into the Legislative Council, which provided for an Aborigines Protection Board. He was appointed to the board in 1890, by which time it had been given a fixed percentage of the colony&#x27;s annual revenue in the newly granted constitution. Forrest was strongly opposed to the financial provisions and after becoming premier sought to amend the constitution to remove them. He spent several years lobbying the British government for approval, which was eventually granted in 1897 and saw Aboriginal affairs return to the control of the colonial government. According to Martyn Webb, he was capable of compassion towards Aboriginal people, but &quot;it would be wrong to imagine that Forrest was some sort of unrequited idealist as far as Aborigines were concerned&quot; and &quot;his views about Aboriginal people as a whole were not entirely different from those of his time&quot;.

As premier, Forrest faced pressure from pastoralists in the north-west – including family members and parliamentary colleagues – to intervene on their behalf in frontier conflicts, simultaneously facing pressure to intervene in cases of cruelty and mistreatment toward Aboriginal people. In 1893, on the topic of massacres, he stated that &quot;I must not, in the position I am in, do anything or sanction anything that will lead to the impression that an indiscriminate slaughter of blackfellows will be tolerated or allowed by the government of the colony&quot;. In 1889 he had persuaded the Executive Council to commute a death sentence imposed on an Aboriginal man in Roebourne, who had been convicted of murder for a killing under customary law. Forrest&#x27;s government nevertheless introduced harsher penalties for Aboriginal people caught stealing or killing livestock, including flogging and imprisonment. It also continued the use of Rottnest Island as a prison for Aboriginal offenders, despite his earlier criticism of the practice of taking them away from their home country. In 1905 he defended the use of neck chains for Aboriginal prisoners, stating that were necessary to prevent escape.

According to historian Henry Reynolds, Forrest ignored the Aboriginal rights embodied in pastoral leases, and presided over the parliament for the decade that &quot;also witnessed the violent suppression of Aboriginal resistance in the Kimberley... [where] the Forrest family, including John&#x27;s brother Alexander, were deeply involved in the whole venture as leaseholders, managers and financiers&quot;. By the mid-1890s, police were eradicating Aboriginal people from pastoral land, with the full knowledge of the government.

==Legacy==

Forrest&#x27;s legacy can be found in the Western Australian landscape, with many places named by or after him:
* the small settlement of Forrest on the Trans-Australian Railway;
* Glen Forrest;
* Forrestdale;
* John Forrest National Park;
* Forrest River;
* Forrest Chase;
* Forrestfield and
* John Forrest Secondary College in Morley.

In addition, the electoral Division of Forrest was created in 1922; the suburb of Forrest, Australian Capital Territory is named after Forrest, as one of the many suburbs of Canberra named after Australia&#x27;s first federal politicians.

The Forrest Highway, opened in September 2009, was named after him. The Eyre Highway was first known as the Forrest Highway, when it was first established as an unsealed road in 1942.

He is one of many railroad builders featured as a possible computer-controlled competitor in the simulation game Railroad Tycoon 3.

On 28 November 1949, the Australian post office issued a commemorative stamp that featured Forrest.

The Lord Forrest Hotel opened in Bunbury in 1986 even though he was never correctly known by that name. It is still running today and proudly displays his pictures on the walls. It is the largest hotel in Bunbury.

<doc id="357017" wikidata="Q1164863" url="?curid=357017" title="Escape from Monkey Island">
<text>Escape from Monkey Island is an adventure game developed and released by LucasArts in 2000. It is the fourth game in the &quot;Monkey Island&quot; series, and the sequel to the 1997 videogame &quot;The Curse of Monkey Island&quot;. It is the first game in the series to use 3D graphics and the second game to use the GrimE engine, which was upgraded from its first use in &quot;Grim Fandango&quot;.

The game centers on the pirate Guybrush Threepwood, who returns home with his wife Elaine Marley after their honeymoon, to find her erroneously declared dead, and her office of governor up for election. Guybrush must find a way to restore Elaine to office, while uncovering a plot to turn the Caribbean into a tourist trap, headed by his nemesis LeChuck and an Australian conspirator Ozzie Mandrill.

&quot;Escape from Monkey Island&quot; won positive reviews and was a moderate commercial success. It was ultimately the last LucasArts adventure game to be released, as the company&#x27;s later projects &quot;Full Throttle: Hell on Wheels&quot; and &quot;Sam &amp; Max: Freelance Police&quot; were canceled in 2003 and 2004, respectively. The game was followed by &quot;Tales of Monkey Island&quot;, released by Telltale Games in 2009.

==Gameplay==
&quot;Escape from Monkey Island&quot; is an adventure game that consists of dialogue with characters and solving puzzles. The game is controlled entirely with the keyboard or alternatively with a joystick, making it the only non-point-and-click game in the &quot;Monkey Island&quot; series.

A feature of the game are action-lines: Guybrush will glance at any items that can be interacted with; the player can use &#x27;Page Up&#x27; or &#x27;Page Down&#x27; to select the item that he wants Guybrush to look at.

One of the hallmark aspects of the &quot;Monkey Island games&quot;, the insult swordfighting — the sword duels which were won by knowing the appropriate insults and responses — is briefly touched upon in the game as &quot;insult armwrestling&quot;, and in an unwinnable insult duel against Ozzie Mandrill. In the second part of the game, the insult games are replaced by &quot;Monkey Kombat&quot;, the name being a parody of &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; with a symbol to match. Monkey Kombat is a sub-game akin to rock-paper-scissors, where the player needs to memorize lines of &quot;monkey insults and retorts&quot; which consist of per-game randomized compositions of &quot;monkey words&quot; like &quot;oop&quot;, &quot;chee&quot;, &quot;ack&quot; and &quot;eek&quot;.

==Plot==
Guybrush Threepwood and Elaine Marley return to Mêlée Island from their honeymoon. They find that Elaine has been declared officially dead, her position as governor has been revoked and her mansion is scheduled to be demolished. The governorship is up for election, and suddenly a person known as Charles L. Charles presents himself as the lead candidate. As Elaine begins her campaign to recover her position, Guybrush hires navigator Ignatius Cheese in a game of insult arm-wrestling, meets again with two of his old &quot;friends&quot;, Carla and Otis, and heads out to Lucre Island to recover the Marley family heirlooms and obtain the legal documents to save her mansion. During his trip, Guybrush learns of the Marley family&#x27;s greatest secret: a voodoo talisman known as the Ultimate Insult, which allows the user to spread insults so heinous, it destroys the spirit and will of those who hear it. He is framed for bank robbery by crook Pegnose Pete at the hiring of the Australian land developer Ozzie Mandrill, but proves his innocence.

After acquiring the legal deeds and returning to the manor, Guybrush and Elaine discover that Charles L. Charles is really the shape-shifting Demon Pirate LeChuck, having been freed from his ice prison and seeking the Ultimate Insult. As Elaine continues her campaign, Guybrush searches the Jambalaya and Knuttin Atoll islands and recovers the pieces of the Ultimate Insult. Upon returning home, he is ambushed by the newly elected governor LeChuck and Ozzie Mandrill, who steal the pieces from him. The two villains are revealed to be working together, with Ozzie to rid of all pirates and turn the Caribbean into a resort and LeChuck out of debt to Ozzie for freeing him from his icy tomb and to use the Ultimate Insult to break Elaine and marry her. Feeling they might need Guybrush as a hostage, the two dump him on Monkey Island.

Despite temporary discouragement, Guybrush sets about making his escape. He learns the art of Monkey Kombat from the &quot;monkey prince of Monkey Island&quot; and, upon restoring the hermit Herman Toothrot&#x27;s memory, discovers that the old man is actually Elaine&#x27;s missing grandfather, having contracted amnesia twenty years prior due to being pushed into a whirlpool off the coast of Australia by Ozzie. After constructing an even bigger Ultimate Insult, Guybrush discovers that the colossal monkey head statue of the island hides a giant pilot-able monkey robot. He reactivates the Mecha and powers it and Herman and the island&#x27;s monkeys join him in piloting it. With the robot, Guybrush manages to disable an Ultimate Insult amplifier made by Ozzie before returning to Mêlée. During this time, Ozzie has managed to capture Elaine and assemble the Ultimate Insult. When it appears to fail due to the lack of the amplifier, LeChuck takes matters into his own hands and possesses a statue of himself he had built shortly after his gubernatorial victory. Ozzie uses the Ultimate Insult to take control of LeChuck&#x27;s statue form and engages Guybrush&#x27;s monkey robot in Monkey Kombat. During the duel, Guybrush performs repeated ties, allowing Elaine to escape and causing LeChuck to smack his head in exasperation, crushing Ozzie and destroying the Ultimate Insult. LeChuck explodes. Guybrush and Elaine are reunited and Grandpa Marley resumes being the governor of Mêlée Island, so that the couple can go back to being pirates.

==Development==
The game was made with Sean Clark and Michael Stemmle as lead designers, both of whom worked on LucasArts&#x27; previous adventure titles &quot;Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis&quot; and &quot;Sam &amp; Max Hit the Road&quot;. Sean Clark also worked on &quot;Loom&quot; and &quot;The Dig&quot;. &quot;Escape&quot; uses a slightly improved version of the GrimE engine introduced by &quot;Grim Fandango&quot;. Compared to the rest of the series, the SCUMM scripting language was replaced by the Lua programming language. This is referenced in-game; the pirate-themed SCUMM Bar, which first appeared in &quot;The Secret of Monkey Island&quot;, is replaced during the game with the tropical-themed Lua Bar.

A new version of the iMUSE interactive music system incorporating MP3 compression, among other changes, was built and used for the game. Interactive programming of the music and ambiance streams in the iMUSE system was done by lead sound designer Larry the O. &quot;Escape&#x27;s&quot; introductory music is identical to that of the third game, unlike the earlier sequels which featured newly composed remixes of the well-known &quot;Monkey Island&quot; theme. Clint Bajakian, who had previously been an additional composer on &quot;Monkey Island 2: LeChuck&#x27;s Revenge&quot;, acted as the game&#x27;s main composer, with additional tracks by Michael Land (who had been the lead composer on the previous three &quot;Monkey Island&quot; games), Peter McConnell, Anna Karney, and Michael Lande (not to be confused with Michael Land).

The voice cast saw the return of Dominic Armato as Guybrush, Earl Boen as LeChuck, Leilani Jones Wilmore as the Voodoo Lady and Denny Delk as Murray. The only major voice not to return was Alexandra Boyd who voiced Elaine in the previous game. She was replaced by Charity James. Stan is also voiced by a different actor, Pat Fraley. Additionally, characters who had previously appeared in &quot;The Secret of Monkey Island&quot; such as Carla, Otis and Herman Toothrot, are heard with voice actors for the first time.

The game was also released on PlayStation 2 in 2001. Apart from obvious control differences, the PS2 version only varies by a slightly higher polygon count and use of less pre-rendered material. &quot;Escape&quot; is the third LucasArts adventure game to have a console release, following &quot;The Secret of Monkey Island&quot; for the Sega CD and &quot;Maniac Mansion&quot; for the NES.

According to Heinrich Lenhardt of &quot;PC Gamer US&quot;, &quot;[I]f it wasn&#x27;t for the sales figures in Germany, LucasArts probably wouldn&#x27;t have bothered doing another &quot;Monkey Island&quot;&quot; after &quot;The Curse of Monkey Island&quot;. In response to questions about the success of &quot;Grim Fandango&quot; and the viability of adventure games in the United States market, Tom Sarris of LucasArts defended the company&#x27;s decision to make &quot;Escape from Monkey Island&quot; in 2000. He told GameSpot: &quot;We look at the sales figures from a worldwide standpoint and ask ourselves if it still makes sense to make adventure games. &quot;Grim Fandango&quot; made a profit, so the answer is yes, it&#x27;s still viable from a financial point of view&quot;.

==Reception==
===Sales===
Discussing &quot;Escape from Monkey Island&quot;″s performance in December 2000, Simon Jeffery of LucasArts said that the company was &quot;really happy with the [game&#x27;s] success&quot;. He noted that it was &quot;selling well&quot; in the United States and &quot;incredibly well in Europe&quot;, which he called proof that a market still existed for adventure games, despite a widespread belief that the genre had died. The game&#x27;s computer version sold 55,275 copies and earned $2 million in the United States by the end of 2000, according to the market research firm PC Data. In the German market, &quot;Escape&quot; debuted at #4 on Media Control&#x27;s computer game sales chart for November 2000. It placed ninth and 16th in its following two months, respectively. PC Data estimated its sales in the United States at 32,576 units for 2001, and 9,168 for the first six months of 2002. Its jewel case SKU sold 11,061 copies in North America during 2003.

In March 2003, LucasArts&#x27; Bill Tiller said that he was not sure what &quot;EMI&quot; sold, but thought it had decent numbers on the PC. In contrast, he reported that he &quot;heard rumor of ... abysmal&quot; sales for its PlayStation 2 release. In retrospect, Rob Smith wrote in &quot;Rogue Leaders: The Story of LucasArts&quot; that &quot;the stateside reception [for &quot;Escape of Monkey Island&quot;] was disappointing, but retail response was buoyed by overseas interest and sales—particularly in Europe, where the demand for adventure games hadn&#x27;t fallen as flat&quot;.

===Critical response===
The game was met with a generally favorable reception. The gameplay received criticism for its interface and the difficulty of keyboard or joystick control as compared to mouse controls. The &quot;Monkey Kombat&quot; was also criticized, with the GameSpot review stating that it was the single biggest problem in &quot;Escape from Monkey Island&quot;. Another reviewer speculated that the designers presumably figured that combining insult fighting, cute monkeys, and a &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; spoof would work well, but it did not.

&quot;PC Zone&quot; gave it 82% and called it an enjoyable and fun game despite not having innovations. Adventure Gamers gave it four stars out of five and called it &quot;a quality adventure game&quot;; he was critical of restyling of the old locations on Mêlée Island and Monkey Island, but was satisfied with game&#x27;s ending. Jeff Lundrigan in &quot;Next Generation&quot;, rated it three stars out of five, having a praise on the story, characters, and production values.

&quot;Playboy&quot; gave the PS2 version a score of 85% and said that the game captures aging Marx Brothers appeal, but with modern-day flair, also having high remarks of gameplay and characters. &quot;Maxim&quot;, however, gave the same version six out of ten, criticising tongue-in-cheek jokes as tasteless. Jeff Lundrigan reviewed the PlayStation 2 version of the game for &quot;Next Generation&quot;, rating it three stars out of five, and stated that the puzzles are confusing, but recommended to the gamers who have a patience to solve it.

===Awards===
&quot;Escape from Monkey Island&quot; was a runner-up for GameSpot&#x27;s, &quot;The Electric Playground&quot;″s, IGN&#x27;s and &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot;″s awards for the best computer adventure title of 2000, all of which went to &quot;The Longest Journey&quot;. &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot;″s editors remarked that &quot;Escape from Monkey Island&quot; is &quot;a lot of fun and is strongly recommended to fans, but it&#x27;s a few jokes and puzzles short of being a classic like the other games in the series&quot;. However, CNET Gamecenter named it the year&#x27;s best adventure game over &quot;The Longest Journey&quot;, and its editors wrote that they could not &quot;imagine a better graphic adventure&quot; than LucasArts&#x27; title. It was also a finalist for their overall game of the year award, which went to &quot;The Sims&quot;.

The editors of &quot;Computer Games Magazine&quot; similarly nominated &quot;Escape from Monkey Island&quot; for their 2000 &quot;Adventure Game of the Year&quot; award. During the 4th Annual Interactive Achievement Awards, the Academy of Interactive Arts &amp; Sciences nominated &quot;Escape from Monkey Island&quot; in the categories for &quot;PC Action/Adventure&quot;, &quot;Art Direction&quot;, and &quot;Original Musical Composition&quot;.

<text>From the late 1980s to the early 2000s, LucasArts was well known for their point-and-click graphic adventure games, nearly all of which got high scoring reviews at the time of their release. Their style tended towards the humorous, often irreverent or slapstick humor, with the exceptions of &quot;Loom&quot; and &quot;The Dig&quot;. Their game design philosophy was that the player should never die or reach a complete dead-end, although there were exceptions.

Many of the games shared similar game interfaces and technology, powered by SCUMM (Script Creation Utility for Maniac Mansion). After 1997, these games transitioned into 3D graphics with the GrimE game engine. Common features between the games include in-joke references to both other LucasArts games and Lucasfilm productions, as well as other running gags, such as Chuck the Plant and &quot;Sam &amp; Max&quot; cameo appearances, that spanned numerous games. Most of the games were designed by the people with experience from creating preceding adventure games for LucasArts, and the same composers were involved in the majority of productions.

In 2004, after a string of titles that never reached release, LucasArts ceased development on graphic adventure games. Many of the development staff involved in the making of these games moved on to form new companies, continuing to produce similar games at studios such as Telltale Games, Double Fine Productions, and Autumn Moon Entertainment. In 2009, however, LucasArts made a collaboration with Telltale to revive the &quot;Monkey Island&quot; series, one of the old LucasArts adventure franchises, as well as stating its intent to revisit its past portfolio. This collaboration brought the LucasArts to develop special editions of the first two Monkey Island games and the Telltale helmed adventure game &quot;Tales of Monkey Island&quot;.

==Games==
===Initial titles (1986–90)===
LucasArts&#x27; first adventure game was the 1986 title &quot;&quot;. The game&#x27;s development was led by David Fox, with contributions from Douglas Adams, Christopher Cerf, Noah Falstein and Brenda Laurel. Based on the film of the same name, it is LucasArts&#x27; first video game adaptation of a film. It is the only adventure game not published by LucasArts, as &quot;Labyrinth&quot; was published and distributed by Activision.
&quot;Labyrinth&quot; was followed in 1987 by &quot;Maniac Mansion&quot;. &quot;Maniac Mansion&quot; was the creation of Ron Gilbert and Gary Winnick, and marked the debut of SCUMM, the game engine that powered all but two of LucasArts later adventure games. The game was also the first LucasArts adventure game to be released for DOS. &quot;Maniac Mansion&quot; was LucasArts&#x27; first full graphic adventure game, using a point-and-click interface rather than the text-based gameplay seen in &quot;Labyrinth&quot;. A menu of verbs allows the player to choose how to interact with the game&#x27;s environment. &quot;Maniac Mansion&quot; aims to parody the horror genre. The game was subject to several enhancements and re-releases, and was included as a game within a game in its sequel, &quot;Day of the Tentacle&quot;.

The third LucasArts adventure game was &quot;Zak McKracken and the Alien Mindbenders&quot;, designed by David Fox, Matthew Kane, David Spangler and Ron Gilbert. Set within a science fiction setting, the game was released in 1988. It used a slightly upgraded version of the SCUMM engine, but adopted the same control and gameplay methods of the earlier games. &quot;Zak McKracken and the Alien Mindbenders&quot; introduced digital music to LucasArts adventure games in the form of MIDI.

In 1989, LucasArts released their first adaptation of one of Lucasfilm&#x27;s major franchises: &quot;Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade&quot;, based on the film of the same name. The game again upgraded the SCUMM engine&#x27;s capabilities, but kept similar gameplay. The project was led by Ron Gilbert, David Fox and Noah Falstein; it was Fox&#x27;s last adventure game for the company. A quotient point system, referred to as &quot;Indy Quotient&quot;, allowed the player to overcome puzzles in several different ways, such as fighting a guard, sneaking past the guard, or convincing the guard to allow the player to pass.

&quot;Loom&quot; was the fourth game to utilize the SCUMM engine and was released in 1990. Designed by Brian Moriarty, the game was set in a fantasy setting. As well as updating the engine&#x27;s graphics through the use of dithering, &quot;Loom&quot; marked a major deviation in interacting with the game&#x27;s world. Instead of using the standard point-and-click interface of previous games, &quot;Loom&quot; requires players to use four-note musical tunes to create spells on objects or other characters. &quot;Loom&quot; also introduced the game design philosophy that the player character cannot reach a dead-end or die; this design decision was applied to all later adventure games, with the exception of &quot;Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis&quot;. A later CD-ROM re-release added Red Book CD-DA music featuring the compositions of Pyotr Tchaikovsky and a full voice soundtrack (although, as a consequence of using Red Book CD-DA for the speech, the dialogue script had to be shortened considerably to fit on the CD-ROM).

===The early nineties (1990–93)===
&quot;The Secret of Monkey Island&quot; is the first game in the &quot;Monkey Island&quot; series and was released in 1990. The game, noted for its greater use of witty humor over previous titles, was designed by Ron Gilbert, Dave Grossman and Tim Schafer. The concept itself was pioneered by Gilbert. Following the deviation in gameplay in &quot;Loom&quot;, &quot;The Secret of Monkey Island&quot; returned to similar point-and click gameplay featured in &quot;Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade&quot;. The SCUMM engine was again upgraded for the title. Set in the Caribbean in the Golden Age of Piracy, the game introduced Guybrush Threepwood, a hapless amateur pirate. The game&#x27;s MIDI music soundtrack was the first to feature work by Michael Land. The CD-ROM re-release added a new CD-audio music soundtrack, and updated the game&#x27;s graphical user interface.

A sequel to &quot;The Secret of Monkey Island&quot;, &quot;Monkey Island 2: LeChuck&#x27;s Revenge&quot;, followed in 1991. As with its predecessor, it was designed by Ron Gilbert, Dave Grossman and Tim Schafer, though it would be Gilbert&#x27;s last work for LucasArts. The game once again placed the player in the position of Guybrush Threepwood, searching for a fabled treasure in the Caribbean. Gameplay remained mostly unchanged from &quot;The Secret of Monkey Island&quot;, though the game&#x27;s user interface was simplified to be more user-friendly. &quot;LeChuck&#x27;s Revenge&quot; again featured music by Michael Land, although Land was joined by Clint Bajakian and Peter McConnell. In addition, the game marked the debut of iMuse (Interactive Music Streaming Engine), a system developed by Land and McConnell that allowed for the game&#x27;s MIDI music to transition dynamically with the visuals.

The 1992 title &quot;Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis&quot; was the second LucasArts adventure game based on the &quot;Indiana Jones&quot; franchise. Unlike its predecessor, &quot;The Fate of Atlantis&quot; featured an entirely original storyline. The development was led by Hal Barwood and Noah Falstein, the latter of whom was one of the co-designers of &quot;The Last Crusade&quot;. &quot;The Fate of Atlantis&quot; was Falstein&#x27;s last LucasArts project. The game incorporated the &quot;Indy Quotient&quot; system from &quot;The Last Crusade&quot; to allow the game to be completed in several ways. A 1993 CD-ROM re-release added a full voice soundtrack.

&quot;Day of the Tentacle&quot; is the sequel to the 1987 title &quot;Maniac Mansion&quot;. Released in 1993, it was designed by Tim Schafer and Dave Grossman and focused on saving humanity from a megalomanic mutant tentacle by using time travel. It was Grossman&#x27;s last project for LucasArts before leaving in 1994. The game featured a further upgrade in the SCUMM engine to enhance the graphics capabilities. &quot;Day of the Tentacle&quot;″s music was composed by Michael Land, Clint Bajakian and Peter McConnell, who composed the themes for the future, past and present settings of the game respectively. &quot;Day of the Tentacle&quot; was the first game to drop support for older, less successful platforms, instead initially releasing only for DOS and Mac OS. The game was one of the first video games to feature a full voice soundtrack upon its release.

Following the focus on the &quot;Maniac Mansion&quot;, &quot;Monkey Island&quot; and &quot;Indiana Jones&quot; franchises, LucasArts developed a game based on a different existing franchise in 1993 with &quot;Sam &amp; Max Hit the Road&quot;. Designed by Sean Clark, Michael Stemmle, Steve Purcell and Collette Michaud, the game was based on comic book characters Sam and Max, which were created by Purcell. As with &quot;Day of the Tentacle&quot;, the game featured a full voice soundtrack upon release. The players&#x27; interaction with the game&#x27;s environment was redesigned. Command functions were compressed into a number of cursor modes instead of having a list of verb actions to choose from on screen, and the inventory system was moved to an off-screen menu. The more streamlined interface allowed for more of the screen to be dedicated to gameplay. Land, Bajakian and McConnell returned to score the game&#x27;s music. While Bajakian did not compose any further LucasArts adventure games, he was still involved with sound production in later titles. He is credited as both a music supervisor and one of four composers on &quot;Escape From Monkey Island&quot;.

===Later SCUMM games (1995–97)===
In 1995, after a year-long hiatus from adventure games, LucasArts released &quot;Full Throttle&quot;. &quot;Full Throttle&quot; was designed by Tim Schafer, and follows the story of Ben, a biker in a dystopian future who has been framed for murder. It was the first LucasArts adventure game to be released for Windows, although support for DOS was still retained. The game was the tenth to use the SCUMM engine, which had undergone further enhancements. The game kept a modified version of the streamlined interface used in &quot;Sam &amp; Max Hit the Road&quot;, but introduced a contextual pie menu that dictated how players interacted with the game. &quot;Full Throttle&quot; featured technology called INSANE (Interactive Streaming Animation Engine) to assist with cut scene animation and the game&#x27;s action sequences. The game&#x27;s musical score was produced by Peter McConnell, and incorporated a title theme by The Gone Jackals. &quot;Full Throttle&quot; was the first LucasArts adventure game to be distributed only on CD-ROM.
Later in 1995, &quot;The Dig&quot; was published. Production had started in 1989, but &quot;The Dig&quot; was plagued with development problems. The final version of the game was overseen by Sean Clark, although two previous versions had involved Noah Falstein, Brian Moriarty and Dave Grossman. The game&#x27;s story itself was envisioned by Steven Spielberg, who had concluded that a film version would be prohibitively expensive. Spielberg&#x27;s story focused on a group of astronauts becoming stranded on an alien world while on a mission to stop an asteroid hitting Earth. &quot;The Dig&quot; used the SCUMM engine and the INSANE technology. In addition, fellow Lucasfilm company Industrial Light &amp; Magic was involved in the game&#x27;s special effects. Michael Land composed the game&#x27;s music, which included excerpts, many as short as one or two chords, from Richard Wagner&#x27;s work.

The twelfth and final game to utilize SCUMM technology was the 1997 title &quot;The Curse of Monkey Island&quot;. The game was the third entry in the &quot;Monkey Island&quot; series, and the first not to involve series creator Ron Gilbert. Development was instead led by Jonathan Ackley and Larry Ahern. For its final outing, the SCUMM engine was completely overhauled to produce significantly more advanced graphics than any previous LucasArts adventure game. The resulting distinct cartoon style was created by artist Bill Tiller. &quot;The Curse of Monkey Island&quot; featured slightly refined gameplay based on the pie menu interface used in &quot;Full Throttle&quot;. The character of Guybrush Threepwood returns, with a voice actor for the first time in the series, in an effort to save his fiancée from a voodoo curse. Michael Land once again composed the game&#x27;s score. &quot;The Curse of Monkey Island&quot; would mark the end of support for DOS; the game was released on CD-ROM solely for Windows.

===3D graphics and GrimE (1998–2000)===

For the 1998 title &quot;Grim Fandango&quot;, LucasArts retired the SCUMM engine in favor of a new 3D engine. The GrimE (Grim Engine) technology was created, using the Sith engine as a base and coded using Lua. The new engine resulted in a redesign in control and gameplay: instead of using point-and-click mechanics, the player uses the keyboard or a gamepad to interact with the game. Full-motion video cut scenes are used to advance the plot, stylized to be nearly indistinguishable from the in-game backgrounds. GrimE was also a true 3D engine: characters are collections of 3D-rendered polygons.

&quot;Grim Fandango&quot; was created by Tim Schafer, his final work for LucasArts. The game follows the tale of Manny Calavera, a travel agent in the Land of the Dead, as he becomes embroiled in a web of crime and corruption. As well as drawing inspiration from Aztec concepts of the afterlife, &quot;Grim Fandango&quot; is strongly rooted in film noir tradition. Peter McConnell composed the musical score; as with Schafer, this was McConnell&#x27;s last LucasArts project. As with &quot;The Curse of Monkey Island&quot;, the game was only released for Windows.

The second title to use GrimE and the final original LucasArts adventure game to be released was &quot;Escape from Monkey Island&quot;. Released in 2000, the game is the fourth installment in the &quot;Monkey Island&quot; series. The game&#x27;s development was led by Sean Clark and Michael Stemmle. The GrimE technology was slightly modified for the game, although &quot;Escape from Monkey Island&quot; was in most respects similar to &quot;Grim Fandango&quot; in both graphics and gameplay. &quot;Escape from Monkey&quot; again follows Guybrush Threepwood, this time attempting to deal with an Australian land developer attempting to eradicate piracy through a voodoo talisman. The game&#x27;s music was created by five different composers: Michael Land, a different composer coincidentally named Michael Land, Bajakian, McConnell, and Anna Karney. In addition to the Windows version, support was added for Mac OS 9 and a PlayStation 2 version was released in 2001.

===Special editions and remakes (2009–2017)===
In July 2009, LucasArts released an enhanced remake of the 1990 title &quot;The Secret of Monkey Island&quot;, with the intent of bringing the old game to a new audience. According to LucasArts, this was &quot;just the start of LucasArts&#x27; new mission to revitalize its deep portfolio of beloved gaming franchises&quot;. Described by British journalist John Walker as a &quot;cautious toe in the water&quot; for LucasArts, the move was prompted by LucasArts president Darrell Rodriguez, who had assumed the post only two months prior. According to Walker, many LucasArts employees had grown up playing the games from the 1990s, suggesting that should the renewed endeavour be successful, the developers would be keen to continue with further adventure titles.

&quot;The Secret of Monkey Island: Special Edition&quot; ran in an engine updated for high definition graphics that utilized the original game&#x27;s resources, including the original SCUMM scripts. The special edition featured new high definition art and music played by a live orchestra. The original DOS CD version of the game was playable at any time with the press of a button.

Following the success of the first special edition, LucasArts released the sequel, &quot;Monkey Island 2 Special Edition&quot;, in the summer of 2010. Like the original special edition, the second special edition used an updated engine that supported high resolution graphics, and utilized the original game&#x27;s resource files. This time, since the game used the iMUSE system, the engine had to be modified to run the new live orchestra music in various arrangements that simulated the shift in tone and pitch from scene to scene that iMUSE performed on the original MIDI music. The second special edition featured a change in control scheme as well as a change in art direction due to criticism of the first special edition.

Double Fine Productions released remasters of &quot;Grim Fandango&quot; in 2015, &quot;Day of the Tentacle&quot; in 2016, and &quot;Full Throttle&quot; in 2017.

==Canceled projects==
Following the release of &quot;Escape from Monkey Island&quot; in 2000, LucasArts put three further adventure games into development, but all three were later canceled. The first of these was &quot;Full Throttle: Payback&quot;, a sequel to &quot;Full Throttle&quot; that began production in early 2000. Tim Schafer, the original creator of &quot;Full Throttle&quot;, was not involved in the project. Instead, development was led by Larry Ahern and Bill Tiller, who had both worked on &quot;The Curse of Monkey Island&quot;. In the early stages, the project received positive feedback from other LucasArts employees. According to Tiller, however, &quot;Payback&quot; eventually fell apart because of disagreements over the game&#x27;s style between the development team and &quot;a particularly influential person&quot; within the management division. Production ceased in November 2000, when a quarter of the levels and about 40 percent of the preproduction art were complete. Ahern and Tiller both left LucasArts in 2001.

Another &quot;Full Throttle&quot; sequel began production in 2002. Entitled &quot;Full Throttle: Hell on Wheels&quot;, the game was to be for the PlayStation 2 and Xbox consoles. In contrast to the original &quot;Full Throttle&quot;, &quot;Hell on Wheels&quot; was to be an action-adventure game. Development was headed by Sean Clark, his last work for the company. &quot;Hell on Wheels&quot; was showcased at the 2003 Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3), where a playable demonstration and a teaser trailer were displayed. Despite this, LucasArts halted production in late 2003. Commentators cited poor graphics compared to other action-adventures of the time and Schafer&#x27;s lack of involvement in the project as possible reasons for the decision. Additionally, Roy Conrad, the voice actor of the game&#x27;s protagonist, had died in 2002.

The final attempt by LucasArts to develop an original adventure game was &quot;Sam &amp; Max: Freelance Police&quot;, a sequel to the 1993 title &quot;Sam &amp; Max Hit the Road&quot;. The game was announced for Windows in 2002 as a counterpart to &quot;Hell on Wheels&quot;. Michael Stemmle, one of the co-designers for &quot;Sam &amp; Max Hit the Road&quot;, was the lead designer for the project. Series creator Steve Purcell, who had left LucasArts in 1997, worked as an advisor for the development team. &quot;Freelance Police&quot; was displayed alongside &quot;Hell on Wheels&quot; at the 2003 E3 convention, where the game&#x27;s trailer was revealed. Although development appeared to be proceeding smoothly, &quot;Freelance Police&quot; was abruptly canceled in early 2004, just a few weeks before the game&#x27;s marketing campaign was about to begin. LucasArts cited &quot;current market place realities and underlying economic considerations&quot; as the reasons for their decision. Commentators, however, felt that the move was representative of a perceived decline in the adventure game genre, and that LucasArts was moving to maintain its position with low business risk &quot;Star Wars&quot;-themed titles instead of the high risk graphic adventure games that had brought success in earlier years. LucasArts subsequently dismissed many of the designers involved with developing their adventure games, and in 2006 LucasArts president Jim Ward stated that the company may return to developing adventure games in 2015, effectively ending their adventure game era.

==Design philosophy==

According to LucasArts&#x27; game design philosophy, the player should be entertained, focusing on story and exploration, instead of being excessively punished for mistakes or frustrated by trial and error. Their adventure games would not contain dead ends nor player death, unlike the majority of early adventure games such as those of Sierra.

In 1989, while designing the first &quot;Monkey Island&quot; game, Ron Gilbert wrote an article titled &quot;Why Adventure Games Suck&quot; outlining what he perceived to be design flaws in adventure games of the time. In writing the &quot;Maniac Mansion&quot; script, Gilbert purposely made some of the puzzle solutions irreverent and humorous as an anti-thesis to early adventure games, which would become a trademark of Lucasarts&#x27; adventure games. Gilbert stated an example of a game taking place in Los Angeles where one needed a pencil but that pencil was located in New York: &quot;It&#x27;s kind of silly to think that there are no pencils in L.A., but in many adventure games, that is how the world seems to be. Using humor lets you turn a weakness into an advantage. You can use crazy ideas to solve puzzles, and when the situation makes no sense, people don&#x27;t grumble about it&quot;.

The first game to adopt the design philosophy was &quot;Loom&quot;. After designer Brian Moriarty learned that players tended to list as their favourite Infocom games those they had completed, he designed &quot;Loom&quot; so that it would be impossible to lose. After &quot;Loom&quot; the sole exception was &quot;Fate of Atlantis&quot;, as the designers felt that player death was necessary to create tension, which was required for an Indiana Jones story.

==Games related to LucasArts adventures by descendant companies==
As various designers left LucasArts, new companies were created to produce adventure games in similar styles to those created by LucasArts. &quot;Monkey Island&quot; creator Ron Gilbert, who left LucasArts after the completion of &quot;LeChuck&#x27;s Revenge&quot;, went on to found Humongous Entertainment, in 1992. The company was primarily a children&#x27;s game developer, but they also developed titles aimed at more mature audiences under the Cavedog Entertainment label. Humongous created several series of point-and-click adventure games aimed at children, all of which used SCUMM until 2003.

In the aftermath of &quot;Freelance Police&quot;″s cancellation in 2004, LucasArts dismissed many of their designers who worked on adventure games. Most of the &quot;Freelance Police&quot; development team, including Brendan Q. Ferguson, Dave Grossman and Chuck Jordan, formed Telltale Games in 2005, to continue the development of graphic adventures. Michael Stemmle, the lead designer of &quot;Freelance Police&quot;, joined the company in 2008. In 2005, LucasArts&#x27; license with Steve Purcell concerning the &quot;Sam &amp; Max&quot; franchise expired. Purcell, who had left LucasArts in 1997, moved the franchise to Telltale Games. The company subsequently released &quot;Sam &amp; Max Save the World&quot; in episodic fashion from late 2006 to early 2007. A second run of &quot;Sam &amp; Max&quot; games, &quot;Sam &amp; Max Beyond Time and Space&quot;, was released across late 2007 and early 2008. The third &quot;Sam &amp; Max&quot; season &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Playhouse&quot; was released in 2010. In 2009, LucasArts began a collaboration with Telltale Games to create a new series of episodic adventure games, &quot;Tales of Monkey Island&quot;. Development of this project was led by Dave Grossman, with Michael Stemmle assisting with design and story production. The development team also included members with past experience from both &quot;The Curse of Monkey Island&quot; and &quot;Escape from Monkey Island&quot;. In addition, series creator Ron Gilbert was involved in the early design of the project. Sam and Max were also included in the casual poker games developed by Telltale Games, &quot;Poker Night at the Inventory&quot;, released in 2010, and its sequel, &quot;Poker Night 2&quot;, released in 2013. The company has gone on to develop other episodic adventure games from licensed properties, reaching critical success with their series of &quot;The Walking Dead&quot; games.

Tim Schafer, the creator of &quot;Full Throttle&quot; and &quot;Grim Fandango&quot;, left LucasArts at the beginning of 2000 to find Double Fine Productions. Among their games include &quot;The Cave&quot;, a game designed by Gilbert and developed by Double Fine, inspired by the multiple-character approach of &quot;Maniac Mansion&quot;, and &quot;Broken Age&quot;, a point-and-click adventure game financed by crowdfunding through Kickstarter, one of the first games demonstrating this as a viable mechanism for game development. Double Fine has been able to engage in acquiring the rights to the LucasArts games for making remasters. To date, they have released &quot;Grim Fandango Remastered&quot; (2015), &quot;Day of the Tentacle Remastered&quot; (2016), and &quot;Full Throttle Remastered&quot; (2017).

Gilbert worked with Winnick, Fox and Ferrari to develop &quot;Thimbleweed Park&quot;, which was released at the end of March 2017. The game, also funded through Kickstarter, was designed as an homage to the early LucasArts adventures mimicking the original 8-bit style interface. Gilbert also directed a sixth game in the &quot;Monkey Island&quot; series, &quot;Return to Monkey Island&quot;, which was released in September 2022.

==Legacy==
Aric Wilmunder, one of the co-creators of the SCUMM engine, had taken some of the original design documents for the LucasArts games when he left the company. Sometime later, he decided to return these back to LucasArts, but the company suggested that since Wilmunder had kept his copies safe for years, that Wilmunder keep the whole set of documents together. Wilmunder has subsequently been working with an archivist at Stanford to preserve all the documents and potential donation to a museum, while scanning all of the documents and providing these on the Internet, along with transcribing the source code for SCUMM to GitHub.

ScummVM is an open source emulator originally designed to play SCUMM-based games but has since expanded to play numerous other adventure games based on other commercial game engines. ScummVM was originally created in 2001 through cleanroom reverse engineering of the SCUMM engine, and since then has been expanded to include most of the additional side engines like iMUSE as well as support for the three-dimensionally rendered games, originally part of ResidualVM but now merged into the main ScummVM branch.

<doc id="357023" wikidata="Q14820036" url="?curid=357023" title="Old Kent Road">
<text>Old Kent Road is a major thoroughfare in South East London, England, passing through the London Borough of Southwark. It was originally part of an ancient trackway that was paved by the Romans and used by the Anglo-Saxons who named it Wæcelinga Stræt (Watling Street). It is now part of the A2, a major road from London to Dover. The road was important in Roman times linking London to the coast at Richborough and Dover via Canterbury. It was a route for pilgrims in the Middle Ages as portrayed in Chaucer&#x27;s Canterbury Tales, when Old Kent Road was known as Kent Street. The route was used by soldiers returning from the Battle of Agincourt.

In the 16th century, St Thomas-a-Watering on Old Kent Road was a place where religious dissenters and those found guilty of treason were publicly hanged. The road was rural in nature and several coaching inns were built alongside it. In the 19th century, it acquired the name Old Kent Road and several industrial premises were set up to close to the Surrey Canal and a major business, the Metropolitan Gas Works was developed. In the 20th century, older property was demolished for redevelopment and Burgess Park was created. The Camberwell Public Baths in Old Kent Road opened in 1905 with Russian and Victorian-style Turkish baths. In the 21st century, several retail parks and premises typical of out-of-town development have been built beside it while public houses have been redeveloped for other purposes.

The road is celebrated in the music hall song &quot;Knocked &#x27;em in the Old Kent Road&quot;, describing working-class London life. It is the first property, and one of the two cheapest, on the London Monopoly board and the only one south of the River Thames.

==Geography==
The road begins at the Bricklayers Arms roundabout, where it meets the New Kent Road, Tower Bridge Road, and Great Dover Street. It runs southeast past Burgess Park, Christ Church, Peckham and the railway line from Peckham Rye to South Bermondsey.

Just east of the railway bridge, the road crosses the boundary between the London boroughs of Southwark and Lewisham, where the road ahead becomes New Cross Road. The road appears on a map to form a boundary between Walworth, and Peckham to the south and Bermondsey to the north, although the Bermondsey boundary runs along Rolls Road.

==History==
Old Kent Road, one of the oldest roads in England, was part of a Celtic ancient trackway that was paved by the Romans and recorded as Inter III on the Antonine Itinerary. The Anglo-Saxons named it &quot;Wæcelinga Stræt&quot; (Watling Street). It joined Stane Street, another ancient and Roman road, at Southwark before crossing the Thames at London Bridge. The Inter III was one of the most important Roman roads in Britain, linking London with Canterbury and the Channel ports at Richborough (&quot;Rutupiae&quot;); Dover (&quot;Dubris&quot;) and Lympne (&quot;Lemanis&quot;). Pilgrims, as documented in Chaucer&#x27;s Canterbury Tales, travelled along the road from London and Southwark on their way to Canterbury. In 1415, the road was a scene of celebrations for soldiers returning from the Battle of Agincourt heading towards London. John Rocque&#x27;s Map of London, published in 1746, shows hedgerows along its course. The Kentish Drovers public house opened in 1840 and was so named because the road was a thoroughfare for market traffic. The road was mainly rural in nature, surrounded by fields and windmills and the occasional tavern until the 19th century. The name Old Kent Road came into use in the early 19th century, with the section from Borough High Street to the Bricklayers Arms junction retaining the name Kent Street until it was renamed Tabard Street in 1877.

===St Thomas-a-Watering===

The bridge at St Thomas-a-Watering over the River Neckinger was at the junction with what is now Old Kent Road and Shorncliffe Road (previously Thomas Street), and marked the boundary of the Archbishop of Canterbury&#x27;s authority over the manors of Southwark and Walworth. It was the limit of the City of London&#x27;s authority in 1550, having been ratified in several charters and marked by a boundary stone set into the wall of the old fire station that marked the first resting place for pilgrims while travelling to Canterbury. A nearby public house, the Thomas a Becket, at the corner of Albany Road was named after this. Henry V met soldiers returning from Agincourt at this location in 1415. Charles II&#x27;s journey along the road on his way to reclaim the throne in May 1660 was described by contemporary writer and diarist John Evelyn as &quot;a triumph of about 20,000 horse and foote, brandishing their swords and shouting with inexpressible joy&quot;.

St Thomas-a-Watering became a place of execution for criminals whose bodies were left hanging from the gibbets on the principal route from the southeast to London. On 8 July 1539, Griffith Clerke, Vicar of Wandsworth was hanged and quartered here along with his chaplain and two others, for not acknowledging the royal supremacy of Henry VIII. The Welsh Protestant martyr John Penry was also executed here on 6 April 1593; a small side street nearby is named after him. The Catholic martyrs John Jones and John Rigby were executed in 1598 and 1600 respectively.

===Rolls family=== 

In the early-18th century, the Rolls family of The Grange in nearby Bermondsey acquired a significant amount of land around Old Kent Road. It included residential development that is now Surrey Square and the Paragon, which were designed by Michael Searles in 1788. The main road route gave rise to ribbon development because of the increasing urbanisation of the expanding metropolitan area. In the early-20th century, social housing was built on land previously held by the family who gave away their interests for public benefit including the library at Wells Way in Burgess Park, the girls grammar school at Bricklayers Arms (St Saviour&#x27;s and St Olave&#x27;s School) and the Peabody Estate (Dover Flats and Waleran Flats). The last significant remnant of their involvement is the detached White House between the Peabody Estate buildings, built by Searles in the 1790s. The original railings and ironwork survive in the current development at No. 155. The house was later occupied by Searles and became the management office of the Rolls family trust estates. The last of the male Rolls&#x27;s was the Hon Charles Stewart Rolls who was the pioneer motorist and aviator who formed the Rolls-Royce partnership with Henry Royce.

===Industrial development===
The opening of the Surrey Canal in 1811 changed the character of the road from rural to industrial. Tanneries were established along it and a soap processing plant was built. Older properties occupied by the upper and middle classes were converted into flats for the emerging working class population. By the time Bricklayers Arms goods station opened in 1845, the road was entirely built up and Old Kent Road had one of the highest population densities in Europe, with an average of 280 residents per acre. Sections along the road were commercial with various market stalls and sellers until the construction of the tramway in 1871. Camberwell Public Library No. 1, which later became the Livesey Museum for Children was designed by Sir George Livesey in 1890. The road&#x27;s southern section remained residential throughout the 19th century. Nos. 864, 866 and 880–884 were constructed by John Lamb in 1815, and feature Ammonite capitals, ornamental features resembling fossils, a feature also used in contemporary architecture in Brighton.

The Licensed Victuallers&#x27; National Asylum (now Caroline Gardens), an extensive almshouse estate off Old Kent Road at Asylum Road, opened in 1827. Its first patron was Prince Augustus Frederick, Duke of Sussex who was followed by Prince Albert and Prince Edward.

The Metropolitan Gas Works, identifiable by its large gasometers, was founded in 1833. It serviced an area of more than , including parts of Southwark, Croydon, Newington, Lambeth and Streatham. Expansion of the gas works in 1868 required the demolition of Christ Church, Camberwell, which was built in 1838 and rebuilt on the opposite side of the road by Livesey. The gas works was managed by Livesey from 1840 until his death in 1908. A statue of him was sited in the rear courtyard of Livesey Museum, opposite the works.

During the 19th and 20th century, the industrial and working class makeup of Old Kent Road made it a haven for organised crime and violence. The notorious Richardson Gang operated in the area, and boxing clubs became popular. Lennox Lewis&#x27; manager Frank Maloney grew up in the area and recalled, &quot;If you weren&#x27;t into crime, people thought you were a pansy&quot;. Henry Cooper trained in the boxing club above the Thomas a Becket pub from 1954 to 1968; he unveiled a local blue plaque there in 2007. Draining the Surrey Canal in 1971 uncovered a number of cracked and blown safes that had been thrown in the water.

===Public services===
Old Kent Road railway station at the southern end of the road opened in 1866 and closed in 1917. The London City Fire Brigade opened a fire station on the road around 1868. It was subsumed into the London Fire Brigade from its formation and in 1904 was replaced by a new station which was in turn replaced by another on the corner of Coopers Road. The station was demolished for redevelopment in 2014 and reopened the following year.
When the Old Kent Road baths were opened in 1905, the then independent Borough of Camberwell became the first London borough to provide municipal Victorian-style Turkish baths in addition to the more usual Russian vapour baths. The building was designed to include two swimming pools, each measuring by . In 1913–4, they were used by 188,336 private bathers, 14,687 of whom used its Russian, Turkish, or special electric baths. The 1923 Municipal Year Book noted the &quot;great success&quot; of the Turkish and Russian baths. The baths were destroyed in the Blitz just before the end of World War II.

===Urban Redevelopment===

Unlike many places in London, the Old Kent Road area did not suffer significant bomb damage during World War II. In 1968, a flyover opened at the northern end allowing access to New Kent Road which catered for the main flow of traffic. During the 1970s, run-down Victorian properties on and around Old Kent Road were demolished to make way for new housing estates. Burgess Park was created as part of the County of London Plan in 1943, which recommended new parkland in the area. Several tower blocks were built along the road, although some earlier 19th-century buildings, such as Nos. 360–386, survived.

Public houses on Old Kent Road have been closing since the 1980s. At one point, there were 39 pubs. The Dun Cow at No. 279 opened in 1856 and was well known as a gin palace, and later became a champagne bar and featured DJs such as Steve Walsh and Robbie Vincent. The premises closed in 2004 to become a surgery. The World Turned Upside Down had been on the Old Kent Road since the 17th century, and may have been named after the discovery of Australia, Van Diemen&#x27;s Land, or Tierra del Fuego in South America. The pub became a music venue in the 20th century and is where Long John Baldrey gave his first live performance in 1958. It closed in 2009 and is now a branch of Domino&#x27;s Pizza. The Duke of Kent was converted into a mosque in 1999; in 2021 the building was demolished for a purpose built mosque. The Livesey Museum for Children closed in 2008 owing to council budget cuts and is now used for short term accommodation.

Southwark Borough Council do not consider Old Kent Road to fit the characteristics of an urban town centre, and consequently large retail parks more in character with out-of-town schemes have been developed including a large Asda superstore, B&amp;Q store, Halfords, Magnet and PC World. Southwark Council have begun consultations on plans to redevelop much of the area, known as the Old Kent Road Area Action Plan. This master plan would mimic similar regeneration projects in other London neighbourhoods such as Elephant &amp; Castle, Nine Elms and Canada Water. The consultations centre on a vision to open four new Bakerloo line London Underground stations along the road route, beginning at Bricklayers Arms, as well as 20,000 new homes, a further education college, a health centre and a number of primary and secondary schools. Officials have also suggested the development of a &quot;green spine&quot; of parks and green spaces along the mostly disused Surrey Canal.

A segment of a British Monopoly board, showing Old Kent Road and Whitechapel Road
Old Kent Road is the first property square on the British Monopoly board, priced at £60 and forming the brown set along with the similarly working-class Whitechapel Road. It is the only square on the board in South London and south of the Thames.

The road makes several appearances in literature. In Charles Dickens&#x27; &quot;David Copperfield&quot;, the titular character runs down the road trying to escape from London to Dover, though in the narrative the street is still partly rural in nature. A public garden on the New Kent Road is named David Copperfield&#x27;s Garden to mark a spot where the character stopped on his journey and a quote from his aunt is inlaid on the path through the park. In 1985, the BBC arts series &quot;Arena&quot; included a documentary about the road.

The road is mentioned in the title of the music hall song &quot;Knocked &#x27;em in the Old Kent Road&quot;. It was written in 1891 by Albert Chevalier, who was the lyricist and original performer; the music was written by his brother Charles Ingle. The song was popularised by Shirley Temple&#x27;s performance in the 1939 film &quot;A Little Princess&quot; The street is mentioned multiple times in the Madness song &quot;Calling Cards&quot;, a song about running an illegitimate business &quot;in a sorting office in the Old Kent Road&quot;. It is featured in the chorus of the Levellers&#x27; song &quot;Cardboard Box City&quot;, which criticises the slow action on helping the homeless in London, specifically Old Kent Road being infrequently visited by the wealthy due to its being south of the Thames. British girl group Girls Aloud refer to running down the road in the lyrics to their 2005 single &quot;Long Hot Summer&quot;.

<text>Grove Street Cemetery or Grove Street Burial Ground is a cemetery in New Haven, Connecticut, that is surrounded by the Yale University campus. It was organized in 1796 as the New Haven Burying Ground and incorporated in October 1797 to replace the crowded burial ground on the New Haven Green. The first private, nonprofit cemetery in the world, it was one of the earliest burial grounds to have a planned layout, with plots permanently owned by individual families, a structured arrangement of ornamental plantings, and paved and named streets and avenues. By introducing ideas like permanent memorials and the sanctity of the deceased body, the cemetery became &quot;a real turning point... a whole redefinition of how people viewed death and dying&quot;, according to historian Peter Dobkin Hall. Many notable Yale and New Haven luminaries are buried in the Grove Street Cemetery, including 14 Yale presidents; nevertheless, it was not restricted to members of the upper class, and was open to all.

In 2000, Grove Street Cemetery was designated a National Historic Landmark.

Today, it is managed by Camco Cemetery Management.

==History==

===Establishment (1796)===
For the first 160 years of permanent settlement, New Haven residents buried their dead on the New Haven Green, the town&#x27;s central open space and churchyard. Stones date back to the 17th century and include gravestones include markers by the Thomas Johnson Shop, William Stanclift, John Gaud, William Holland, Caleb Lamson, Michael Baldwin, Joseph Johnson, Thomas Spellman, Thomas Gold, David Miller, and the New Haven Ritter Shop. In 1794–95, a yellow fever plague swept the town. The increased demand for burial space prompted James Hillhouse, a businessman and U.S. Senator, to invite other prominent families in the town to establish a dedicated burial ground on farmland bordering the town. In 1796, thirty-two families purchased a tract just north of Grove Street, the tract was enclosed by a wooden fence, which was prone to rotting and needed to be replaced frequently. At first consisting of , the cemetery was quickly subscribed and thereafter expanded to nearly .

In 1821, the monuments on the green were removed to the Grove Street Cemetery.

===Gateway and fence construction (1845–49)===
Completed in 1845, the entrance on Grove Street is a brownstone Egyptian Revival gateway, designed by the New Haven architect Henry Austin with carving executed by sculptor Hezekiah Augur, both of whom are buried at the cemetery. The style, popular in New England in that era, was chosen to reinforce the antiquity of the site. The lintel of the gateway is inscribed &quot;The Dead Shall Be Raised.&quot; The quotation is taken from 1 Corinthians 15.52: &quot;For the trumpet will sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we will be changed.&quot; Supposedly, Yale President Arthur Twining Hadley said of the inscription, &quot;They certainly will be, if Yale needs the property.&quot;

In 1848–49, the perimeter of the cemetery was surrounded on three sides by an stone wall.

===Historic landmark===
The cemetery was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1997. It was designated a National Historic Landmark by the United States Secretary of the Interior in 2000, citing its history and the architectural significance of its gateway.

===Conflict over perimeter fence===
In 2008, Yale announced plans to construct two new residential colleges just north of the cemetery. In 2009, university administrators and affiliates suggested to the cemetery proprietors that an additional gate be constructed in the north section of the historic wall that surrounds the burial ground to permit pedestrians to walk through the cemetery from the main Yale campus to the planned new colleges. In addition, the proprietors considered a proposal brought forward by one proprietor that would replace portions of the stone sections of the wall bordering Prospect Street with iron fencing similar to that already running along the cemetery&#x27;s southern border on Grove Street. The proposal, withdrawn following a public meeting, included architectural and landscaping designs by Yale Architecture School Dean Robert A.M. Stern.

<text>An automated analyser is a medical laboratory instrument designed to measure various substances and other characteristics in a number of biological samples quickly, with minimal human assistance. These measured properties of blood and other fluids may be useful in the diagnosis of disease.

Photometry is the most common method for testing the amount of a specific analyte in a sample. In this technique, the sample undergoes a reaction to produce a color change. Then, a photometer measures the absorbance of the sample to indirectly measure the concentration of analyte present in the sample. The use of an ion-selective electrode (ISE) is another common analytical method that specifically measures ion concentrations. This typically measures the concentrations of sodium, calcium or potassium present in the sample.

There are various methods of introducing samples into the analyser. Test tubes of samples are often loaded into racks. These racks can be inserted directly into some analysers or, in larger labs, moved along an automated track. More manual methods include inserting tubes directly into circular carousels that rotate to make the sample available. Some analysers require samples to be transferred to sample cups. However, the need to protect the health and safety of laboratory staff has prompted many manufacturers to develop analysers that feature closed tube sampling, preventing workers from direct exposure to samples. Samples can be processed singly, in batches, or continuously.

The automation of laboratory testing does not remove the need for human expertise (results must still be evaluated by medical technologists and other qualified clinical laboratory professionals), but it does ease concerns about error reduction, staffing concerns, and safety.

==Routine biochemistry analysers==
These are machines that process a large portion of the samples going into a hospital or private medical laboratory. Automation of the testing process has reduced testing time for many analytes from days to minutes. The history of discrete sample analysis for the clinical laboratory began with the introduction of the &quot;Robot Chemist&quot; invented by Hans Baruch and introduced commercially in 1959[1].

The AutoAnalyzer is an early example of an automated chemistry analyzer using a special flow technique named &quot;continuous flow analysis (CFA)&quot;, invented in 1957 by Leonard Skeggs, PhD and first made by the Technicon Corporation. The first applications were for clinical (medical) analysis. The AutoAnalyzer profoundly changed the character of the chemical testing laboratory by allowing significant increases in the numbers of samples that could be processed. Samples used in the analyzers include, but are not limited to, blood, serum, plasma, urine, cerebrospinal fluid, and other fluids from within the body. The design based on separating a continuously flowing stream with air bubbles largely reduced slow, clumsy, and error-prone manual methods of analysis. The types of tests include enzyme levels (such as many of the liver function tests), ion levels (e.g. sodium and potassium, and other tell-tale chemicals (such as glucose, serum albumin, or creatinine).

Simple ions are often measured with ion selective electrodes, which let one type of ion through, and measure voltage differences. Enzymes may be measured by the rate they change one coloured substance to another; in these tests, the results for enzymes are given as an activity, not as a concentration of the enzyme. Other tests use colorimetric changes to determine the concentration of the chemical in question. Turbidity may also be measured.

==Immuno-based analysers==
Antibodies are used by some analysers to detect many substances by immunoassay and other reactions that employ the use of antibody-antigen reactions.

When concentration of these compounds is too low to cause a measurable increase in turbidity when bound to antibody, more specialised methods must be used.

Recent developments include automation for the immunohaematology lab, also known as transfusion medicine.

==Hematology analysers==

These are used to perform complete blood counts, erythrocyte sedimentation rates (ESRs), or coagulation tests.

===Cell counters===

Automated cell counters sample the blood, and quantify, classify, and describe cell populations using both electrical and optical techniques.
Electrical analysis involves passing a dilute solution of the blood through an aperture across which an electrical current is flowing. The passage of cells through the current changes the impedance between the terminals (the Coulter principle). A lytic reagent is added to the blood solution to selectively lyse the red cells (RBCs), leaving only white cells (WBCs), and platelets intact. Then the solution is passed through a second detector. This allows the counts of RBCs, WBCs, and platelets to be obtained. The platelet count is easily separated from the WBC count by the smaller impedance spikes they produce in the detector due to their lower cell volumes.

Optical detection may be utilised to gain a differential count of the populations of white cell types. A dilute suspension of cells is passed through a flow cell, which passes cells one at a time through a capillary tube past a laser beam. The reflectance, transmission and scattering of light from each cell is analysed by sophisticated software giving a numerical representation of the likely overall distribution of cell populations.

Some of the latest hematology instruments may report Cell Population Data that consist in Leukocyte morphological information that may be used for flagging Cell abnormalities that trigger the suspect of some diseases.

Reticulocyte counts can now be performed by many analysers, giving an alternative to time-consuming manual counts. Many automated reticulocyte counts, like their manual counterparts, employ the use of a supravital dye such as new methylene blue to stain the red cells containing reticulin prior to counting. Some analysers have a modular slide maker which is able to both produce a blood film of consistent quality and stain the film, which is then reviewed by a medical laboratory professional.

===Coagulometers===

Automated coagulation machines or Coagulometers measure the ability of blood to clot by performing any of several types of tests including Partial thromboplastin times, Prothrombin times (and the calculated INRs commonly used for therapeutic evaluation), Lupus anticoagulant screens, D dimer assays, and factor assays.
Coagulometers require blood samples that have been drawn in tubes containing sodium citrate as an anticoagulant. These are used because the mechanism behind the anticoagulant effect of sodium citrate is reversible. Depending on the test, different substances can be added to the blood plasma to trigger a clotting reaction. The progress of clotting may be monitored optically by measuring the absorbance of a particular wavelength of light by the sample and how it changes over time.

===Other hematology apparatus===
Automatic erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) readers, while not strictly analysers, do preferably have to comply to the 2011-published CLSI (Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute) &quot;Procedures for the Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate Test: H02-A5 and to the ICSH (International Council for Standardization in Haematology) published &quot;ICSH review of the measurement of the erythrocyte sedimentation rate&quot;, both indicating the only reference method, being Westergren, explicitly indicating the use of diluted blood (with sodium citrate), in 200 mm pipettes, bore 2.55 mm. After 30 or 60 minutes being in a vertical position, with no draughts and vibration or direct sunlight allowed, an optical reader determines how far the red cells have fallen by detecting the level.

==Miscellaneous analysers==
Some tests and test categories are unique in their mechanism or scope, and require a separate analyser for only a few tests, or even for only &quot;one&quot; test. Other tests are esoteric in nature—they are performed less frequently than other tests, and are generally more expensive and time-consuming to perform. Even so, the current shortage of qualified clinical laboratory professionals has spurred manufacturers to develop automated systems for even these rarely performed tests.

Analysers that fall into this category include instruments that perform:
* DNA labeling and detection
* Osmolarity and osmolality measurement
* Measurement of glycated haemoglobin (haemoglobin A1C), and
* Aliquotting and routing of samples throughout the laboratory

The series was produced by Nickelodeon Animation Studio.

The series focuses on the adventures of a Latina girl named Dora and her monkey friend Boots, with a particular emphasis on the Spanish language. The series is presented in the style of both an interactive CD-ROM game and a point-and-click adventure game, with gimmicks such as Dora asking the viewer to help her by showing the current items in her inventory and asking the viewer which one is best for the current scenario.

The series is currently scheduled to receive a live-action version for older viewers on Paramount+.

==Plot==
The series centers around Dora Márquez, a seven-year-old Latina girl, with a love of embarking on quests related to an activity that she wants to partake of or a place that she wants to go to, accompanied by her talking purple backpack and anthropomorphic monkey companion named Boots (named for his beloved pair of red boots). Each episode is based around a series of cyclical events that occur along the way during Dora&#x27;s travels, along with obstacles that she and Boots are forced to overcome or puzzles that they have to solve (with &quot;assistance&quot; from the viewing audience) relating to riddles, the Spanish language, or counting. Common rituals may involve Dora&#x27;s encounters with Swiper, a bipedal, anthropomorphic masked thieving fox whose theft of the possessions of others must be prevented through interaction with the viewer. To stop Swiper, Dora and Boots must say &quot;Swiper, no swiping&quot; three times. However, on occasions where Swiper steals the belongings of other people, the viewer is presented with the challenge of helping Boots and Dora locate the stolen items. Another obstacle involves encounters with another one of the program&#x27;s antagonists; the &quot;Grumpy Old Troll&quot; dwelling beneath a bridge that Dora and Boots must cross, who challenges them with a riddle that needs to be solved with the viewer&#x27;s help before permitting them to pass. Known for its constant audience interaction depicted in every episode, the audience is usually presented to two primary landmarks that must be passed before Dora can reach her destination, normally being challenged with games or puzzles along the way. The episode always ends with Dora successfully reaching the locale and singing the &quot;We Did It!&quot; song with Boots in triumph, followed by Dora and Boots discussing their favorite part of the trip.

==Development==
In 1995, Chris Gifford, Valerie Walsh, and Eric Weiner began developing a television series titled &quot;The Knockarounds&quot;, about a group of forest animals led by a brave explorer raccoon. Gifford later explained &quot;Val had an idea for a treasure hunt show and I wanted to do an adventure show, so eventually we settled on a problem-solving show that would give kids tools to help them sort through all the things that come at them.&quot; The creators pitched &quot;The Knockarounds&quot; to Nickelodeon&#x27;s president of film and TV entertainment Albie Hecht, who instead ordered a pilot for Janice Burgess&#x27; pitch &quot;Me and My Friends&quot;.

The three had often thought about making the lead raccoon a human, and ultimately decided make the change after &quot;The Knockarounds&quot; was rejected. Gifford, who had designed the raccoon after his daughter, changed the character to a girl of Irish decent named Nina, described by Weiner as &quot;an ordinary girl who could solve any problem she encountered&quot; and &quot;a superhero by her persistence&quot;. The pitch was reworked under the name &quot;Nina&#x27;s Pop-up Puzzle&quot;, and a pilot was produced. 

In May 1998, Nickelodeon executive Brown Johnson attended the Children Now trade conference in Los Angeles. The organization unveiled a study titled &quot;A Different World: Children&#x27;s Perceptions of Race and Class in the Media&quot;, which stated that children of varying race strongly believed there weren&#x27;t enough Latino or Asian characters on television, and more than two-thirds of the surveyed children believed it was important to see their race on TV. Upon Johnson&#x27;s return, the creators were asked if they could include Hispanic elements in their series. At first there was hesitancy, but eventually they realized that they had &quot;a great opportunity&quot; and the character&#x27;s design remained. Dora is a Latina; according to a Nickelodeon spokesman, &quot;she was developed to be pan-Latina to represent the diversity of Latino cultures&quot;. 

Each episode of the series costs $500,000. Development of the series came out of Nickelodeon&#x27;s desire to &quot;come up with the next big hit&quot; similar to its other successful preschool shows at the time, &quot;Little Bear&quot; and &quot;Blue&#x27;s Clues&quot;. The creators sought to combine the format of both shows, with the narrative focus of &quot;Little Bear&quot; combined with the interactivity of &quot;Blue&#x27;s Clues&quot;. The creators further developed the concept by observing preschoolers with the creators coming to the conclusion that &quot;they are little explorers.&quot; Nickelodeon originally did not want Swiper, the only remaining character from the &quot;Knockarounds&quot; pitch, as researchers stated he was &quot;bad modeling and unsettling to kids&quot;. The creators felt strongly about the inclusion of the antagonist as an integral part of the series; he remained in the final show.

On numerous occasions, television specials have been aired for the series in which the usual events of regular episodes are altered, threatened, or replaced. Usually said specials will present Dora with a bigger, more whimsical adventure than usual or with a magical task that must be fulfilled, or perhaps even offer a series of different adventures for Boots and Dora to travel through. They might be presented with an unusual, difficult task (such as assisting Swiper in his attempts to be erased from Santa Claus&#x27;s Naughty List) that normally is not featured in average episodes, or challenge Dora with a goal that must be achieved (such as the emancipation of a trapped mermaid). Sometimes, the specials have involved the debut of new characters, such as the birth of Dora&#x27;s superpowered twin baby siblings and the introduction of the enchanted anthropomorphic stars that accompany Dora on many of her quests.
On March 8, 2009, Mattel and Nickelodeon announced that Dora will receive a tweenage makeover, switching from a young age to a teenage attending middle school. Initially, it was announced that the new look would not be revealed until late 2009, but after a short controversy, the tween Dora was unveiled on March 16, 2009.

The series&#x27; seventh season, the first to air in high-definition, featured a new CGI opening sequence created by Chicago-based Calabash Animation and a revised visual style with more shading.

<doc id="357032" wikidata="Q1863801" url="?curid=357032" title="Maryland Transit Administration">
<text>The Maryland Transit Administration (MTA) is a state-operated mass transit administration in Maryland, and is part of the Maryland Department of Transportation (MDOT). The MTA operates a comprehensive transit system throughout the Washington-Baltimore metropolitan area. There are 80 bus lines serving the Baltimore Metropolitan Area, along with rail services that include the Baltimore Light RailLink, Baltimore Metro Subway, and MARC Train. In , the system had a ridership of , or about per weekday as of .

With nearly half of Baltimore residents lacking access to a car, the MTA is an important part of the regional transit picture. The system has many connections to other transit agencies of Central Maryland, Washington, D.C., Northern Virginia, and south-central Pennsylvania (Hanover, Harrisburg, and York): WMATA, Charm City Circulator, Regional Transportation Agency of Central Maryland, Annapolis Transit, Rabbit Transit, Ride-On, and TransIT.

== History ==

The MTA took over the operations of the old Baltimore Transit Company on April 30, 1970. It was originally known as the &quot;Baltimore Metropolitan Transit Authority&quot;, then the &quot;Mass Transit Administration&quot; before it changed to its current name in October 2001.

Many of the routes of most of the agency&#x27;s current bus lines are based on the original streetcars operated by the Baltimore Transit Company and its parent companies from the 1890s to the 1960s. All these routes were ultimately converted to rubber tire bus operations, and many of them were consolidated, extended into newly developed areas, or otherwise reconfigured to keep up with the ridership demands of the times. Additional routes and extensions were added in later years to serve communities that were later developed, and to feed into Metro and Light Rail stations that were later built.

With the growth in popularity of the private automobile during the 20th century, streetcar and bus ridership declined, and the needs for public transportation changed. Mass transit in Baltimore and other cities shifted from a corporate operation to a service funded and run by the government. The amount of service provided was greatly reduced, and some areas once served by streetcars are currently served by buses very minimally or not at all.
The demise of the Baltimore streetcar took place between the years of 1947 and 1963, as operators found buses to be low maintenance and more cost-efficient. As rails were demolished, Baltimore was no longer a streetcar city. As transit needs and trends changed, rail transit did return to the city, with the Metro Subway opening in 1983 and the Light Rail in 1992. The track gauge was , a unique gauge.

== Bus routes ==
The MTA operates bus services primarily within the Baltimore metropolitan area, with some peripheral commuter bus connections in the Washington, D.C., metropolitan area, Kent Island, southern Maryland, and western Maryland. The local bus network operated as a daily service is centered in and around Baltimore, with most routes traveling between the city and adjacent Baltimore County or Anne Arundel County communities, and a few routes providing connections between suburban communities.

=== Local bus ===
Since the BaltimoreLink rebranding in 2017, MTA local service routes have been given either CityLink color scheme designations or LocalLink numbered designations. CityLink routes operate at higher frequency and for a longer duration than LocalLink routes, however, together they function as part of the same network and each individual route has its own duration and frequency which varies based on day of the week and time of day. Most of the routes originate in whole or in part from routes which followed a cohesive number scheme prior to 2017; that number scheme in turn was derived directly from the corresponding historical streetcar routes.

CityLink bus line designations are each assigned a color and two-letter abbreviation for that color. Some of the color designations describe shades of the same color, such as the Green and Lime routes or the Blue and Navy routes. The naming scheme also does not disambiguate the colored route names of the Charm City Circulator routes operated in an overlapping service area by Baltimore or the Baltimore County Loop routes operated in an overlapping service area in Towson.

LocalLink bus line designations are numbered across two ranges which loosely correspond to two categories, crosstown routes (21–38) and feeder routes (51–95). There is not one consistent pattern which describes each range, however. For example, LocalLink 80 is a route which provides primarily intra-city service and does not follow the &quot;spoke-and-wheel&quot; pattern associated with feeder routes. The numbering scheme excludes all the historic route numbers which were deprecated in 2017, and not every number in the listed ranges is used for a route. Some of the LocalLink lines are part of the frequent network alongside the CityLink routes, or operate on 24-hour schedules.

In April 2022, the MTA announced a proposal to introduce the first new local bus designation since 2017, the LocalLink 32, which is intended to replace the branch of the CityLink Yellow which travels to the University of Maryland, Baltimore County.

=== Quickbus ===
Until June 2017, The MTA operated four limited-stop routes known as Quickbus or &quot;qb&quot;, which were designated as routes qb40, qb46, qb47, and qb48. In April 2022, the MTA announced the proposed revival of the Quickbus 40 route as the QuickLink 40 in Fall 2022. As of May 2022, the agency is soliciting public feedback on this proposal alongside other service adjustments. In Fall 2023 Quicklink 40 has been reintroduce into service mirroring the prelink Quickbus 40).

=== Neighborhood Shuttle Bug ===
Until June 2017, The MTA had two neighborhood shuttle routes: The Mondawmin Shuttle Bug Route 97 and the Hampden Shuttle Bug Route 98. These routes can be identified by their distinctive brand colors and logos.

=== Express bus ===
The MTA operates 9 express bus lines in the Baltimore area, which are the 103, 105, 115, 120, 150, 154, 160, and 163.

=== Commuter bus ===

Independent bus companies operate 26 commuter bus routes in the Washington, D.C., and Baltimore regions. There are five Baltimore-bound bus lines numbered in the 300 and 400 range; while the sixteen Washington-bound bus lines are numbered in the 600 and 900 range. These routes range from 310 through 995. Buses travelling on MD 200 are numbered in the 200 range. Five routes ranging 201 through 205.

== Rail services ==

=== Rapid transit ===
This system operates elevated and underground from a corporate and shopping complex in Owings Mills in Baltimore County into the heart of Downtown Baltimore City&#x27;s business, shopping and sightseeing districts to the world-renowned Johns Hopkins Medical Center Complex. The northwest-southeastbound route includes 14 station stops. Its route through the densest parts of the city is underground, from Hopkins Hospital to a portal west of Mondawmin station, where it immediately rises to an elevated concrete right of way parallel to Wabash Avenue practically at the city line.

Entering Baltimore County, the line goes to the surface, passing through communities along the way to commuter-based stops at Milford Mill Road (Pikesville) and Old Court Road (Pikesville). From Old Court, the tracks pass underneath the I-695/795 interchange and travel the median of 795 till their end at Owings Mills (Painter&#x27;s Mill Road) This station is the centerpiece of a huge project urbanizing that immediate area, with a Baltimore County Public Library branch, and classroom space for the Community College of Baltimore County. Residential and commercial development is planned to follow the completion of the education buildings.

There were efforts underway to extend the line northeast through the city with phase 1 to Morgan State University and phase 2 beyond the city limits to the White Marsh Town Center area. If they come to fruition, the line will be renamed the Green Line, coordinating with the Red Line (east-west Woodlawn/Security-Hopkins Bayview Hospital) which Maryland Governor Larry Hogan cancelled on June 25, 2017, with the creation of Baltimore Link. Baltimore&#x27;s plans for transit were not mapped and $900 million of federally funded money was sent back. Funding for the Green Line extension is still years from being secured but includes an option to extend it as light rail or BRT from Johns Hopkins Hospital.

=== Light rail ===
This service travels from a corporate, hotel, and shopping complex in Baltimore County&#x27;s Hunt Valley, through the suburbs north of Baltimore and northern Baltimore and into the heart of downtown Baltimore&#x27;s shopping, sightseeing, dining, and entertainment districts, past the harbor and through southern Baltimore and finally to BWI Marshall Airport and Cromwell Station/Glen Burnie in Anne Arundel County. There is also a spur to Amtrak&#x27;s Baltimore Penn Station.

The Light RailLink operates at grade for the most part, though it travels on bridges crossing several bodies of water. There are 33 station stops along the system. Although much of the line was single-tracked when it was built, the MTA completed a double-tracking project on February 26, 2006, and now only a few short single-track sections remain.
=== Commuter rail ===
This service operates three lines that provide commuter rail service to riders out of and into Baltimore, Washington, D.C., Frederick, Perryville, and Martinsburg, WV, as well as several other locations in between.

== Mobility services ==

=== Paratransit ===
The MTA began offering paratransit service for persons with disabilities in 1978 when it took over a mobility service in Baltimore previously operated by Lutheran Family Services. This mobility service is a &quot;non-fixed route&quot; service and consists of a fleet of specially converted Ford E-Series vans and Ford Crown Victorias. Some service is contracted out to MV Transportation and Transdev, but all vehicles are owned by MTA.
=== Taxi Access ===
A sub-service of the Paratransit program is MTA&#x27;s Taxi Access program. The Taxi Access program ensures that any sufficiently physically disabled person that consistently requires Paratransit service can also qualify for the Taxi Access program. The Taxi Access program allows the bearer of a Taxi Access card to take a taxicab door-to-door within the limits of anywhere MTA Paratransit vans go; i.e. within 1/3 of a mile of an MTA public transit stop of any kind. Once the trip is complete, total out-of-pocket cost for the customer is $3.00, and the MTA picks up the rest of the price of the fare, &quot;paying&quot; it to the driver in the form of a voucher that s/he later redeems at his/her cab company headquarters.

== Future service ==
The MTA is building the Purple Line, a light rail system that will operate between Bethesda and New Carrollton with connections to the Washington Metro. As of early 2025, MTA is projecting that the line will begin passenger operations in late 2027.

== Proposed services ==
The MTA has studied a number of proposed services, which included the Red Line (a proposed east–west light rail line that would have passed from Woodlawn pass near Patterson Park) to Johns Hopkins Bayview Med. Ctr. and the Green Line (a proposed north–south line that would have extended from the Johns Hopkins Hospital into northeast Baltimore, possibly as an extension of the Metro Subway). As of summer 2011, the Red Line had received federal permission to enter preliminary engineering. Both lines were cancelled by Gov. Larry Hogan in June 2015.

The Corridor Cities Transitway, a proposed 15-mile (24 km) bus rapid transit line between Gaithersburg and Clarksburg, was allocated some initial planning and design funds in 2013. In 2016 MDOT removed the project from its priority list, and from the Consolidated Transportation Plan in 2019.

== BaltimoreLink ==
BaltimoreLink is an overhaul of the core MTA bus service within and around Baltimore. The announcement of the Baltimore Link plan came from Gov. Larry Hogan in 2015, as part of a $135 Million investment to help improve the transit system through the entire Baltimore metropolitan area. The announcement came on the heels of Gov. Hogan rejecting the initially planned Red Line and Green Line light-rail systems.

Prior to the summer of 2005, the MTA used an older fare collection system. Day passes purchased on buses were printed out by a separate machine from the bus fareboxes. It was possible to alter these passes so that they could be used on other days and to sell them to other passengers or make duplicate passes and sell them to others for cheaper than the MTA&#x27;s official fares. This was despite the fact that they were officially non-transferable.

The MTA has since installed new fareboxes on all of its buses that issue daily passes with magnetic strips; new ticket vending machines at Light Rail and Metro Subway stations issue identical passes including the weekly and monthly passes. Weekly and monthly passes are not sold on buses.

The newer day passes can be used only on the appropriate day because the machine encodes the date and expiration time in the magnetic strip, which is read when swiped through the magnetic reader. Swiping the pass also sets a time waiting period on reuse so the pass cannot be immediately handed to a different passenger and used for free boarding. This also makes it difficult for passengers to use counterfeit passes when boarding the bus, Light Rail, and Metro Subway.

The MTA continues to struggle with passengers who purchase day passes, use them, then resell them at a direct loss to the agency. State employees who possess a Maryland State Employee ID card can ride MTA local bus, Light Rail, and the Metro Subway free of charge. Any state employee with the ID card can get a continuation ticket to get through the gates on the Metro Subway. For the bus, the person shows the state employee ID card to the driver when boarding. On the Light Rail, they have to show the ID card only in the event of a fare inspection while other passengers show their tickets. MTA employees can also ride free of charge if they carry their MTA employee ID card.
=== Electronic fare collection ===

In 2011, the MTA introduced electronic fare collection with a smart card called &quot;CharmCard&quot;, which is similar to and compatible with the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority&#x27;s smart card, SmarTrip. As such, CharmCard can also be used to pay fares for Metrobus, Metrorail, and local bus services in the DC area. Likewise, SmarTrip is accepted for in-person payments on all MTA services except MARC and commuter buses.

In 2017, MTA introduced a new mobile ticketing app called &quot;CharmPass,&quot; which allows passengers to pay fares on all MTA services using mobile devices.

, the MTA is procuring modern replacements for CharmCard and CharmPass, which are &quot;quickly reaching end-of-life&quot;.

== Special programs ==
=== Baltimore City Public School System ===

An agreement between the Baltimore City Public School System and the Maryland Transit Administration provided eligible BCPSS students (usually students who live outside a predetermined area surrounding the school) during a school year with a color-coded booklet of dated tickets each month and an identification card. The tickets allowed students to ride on MTA buses, light rail, and subway free going to and from school. The farebox was able to issue magnetic transfers to ticket holders who must use more than one bus. They were valid for 90 minutes of unlimited travel at the driver&#x27;s discretion. In 2011, a new agreement was put in place for the students. Instead of the color-coded booklet, they were issued a monthly bus pass called an S-Pass. It is a bus pass that is valid for the given month from 6 am until 8 pm. The S-Pass can allow students to ride and pass through an unlimited times through the Metro Subway gate, unlike the transfers from the color-coded booklet from in the past.

=== MTA college pass ===
The Maryland Transit Administration has a special program set up with 24 Baltimore area colleges and universities which allows college students who are enrolled in a minimum of 6 hours per week can receive a monthly pass for $52.90.

== Police force ==
The MTA employs its own force of 150 police officers to protect the transit system and its passengers, the Maryland Transit Administration Police. The department was founded on October 1, 1971, by act of the Maryland State Legislature as the Mass Transit Administration Police Force. On October 1, 2001, when the Mass Transit Administration was renamed the Maryland Transit Administration, the police force changed its name to reflect the change. Its officers are certified by the Maryland Police and Correctional Training Commission and have full police powers. In 2015 and 2016 MTA Police were awarded the APTA Gold Safety Award. The MTA Police had the lowest Part One crime reported for 2015 &amp; 2016 among the top 12 transit agencies in the country. They reported no homicides, no shootings or rapes for those two years.

== Public transit laws ==

Section 7-705 of the Maryland Transportation article (Annotated Code of Maryland) enumerates a list of acts specifically prohibited on public transit vehicles, with penalties of fines up to $1,000 and possible jail terms for violations. In addition to the enumerated rules of behavior, Section 7-705 also allows the MTA to enforce local government laws on public transit vehicles. Many of the rules are conspicuously posted on transit vehicles, bus stops and rail platforms.

<doc id="357034" wikidata="Q1754656" url="?curid=357034" title="Venial sin">
<text>According to Catholicism, a venial sin is a lesser sin that does not result in a complete separation from God and eternal damnation in Hell as an unrepented mortal sin would. A venial sin consists in acting as one should not, without the actual incompatibility with the state of grace that a mortal sin implies; they do not break one&#x27;s friendship with God, but injure it.

== Definition ==

According to the Catechism of the Catholic Church:

The definition of the word &quot;venial&quot; is &quot;forgivable&quot;. An act, when it is not ordered towards that which is good, is considered to be sinful – either venially or mortally. When such an act is venially sinful, it entails subject-matter that is not considered to be &quot;grave&quot;. Such an action, even if it is committed with full knowledge and full consent, remains venial, so long as the subject-matter of the act is not serious. If the subject-matter of a given act is &quot;grave&quot;, however, the commission of that act may be mortally sinful. Intentional ignorance and &quot;hardness of heart&quot; increase &quot;the voluntary character of a sin&quot;. Thus, in discussing the distinction between venial and mortal sin in his &quot;Summa Theologica&quot;, St. Thomas Aquinas indicated that a venial sin differs from a mortal sin, in the same way that something imperfect differs from something that is perfect.

As such, one can arrive at what kind of sin, for example, was committed, by asking the following three questions:

# Did the act involve a grave matter?
# Was the act committed with full knowledge of the wrongdoing that had been done in the act?
# Was the act done with full consent of the will?

If all three questions are answered in the affirmative, the criteria for a mortal sin have been met. If any one of the three questions is answered in the negative, only the criteria for a venial sin have been met.

Each venial sin that one commits adds to the penance that one must do. Penance left undone during life contributes to the purifying process one must undergo while in the state of Purgatory. A venial sin can be left unconfessed so long as there is some purpose of amendment. One receives from the sacrament of reconciliation the grace to help overcome venial, as well as mortal sins. It is recommended that confession of venial sins be made. Venial sins require some kind of penance.

According to the Magisterium, venial sins usually remain venial no matter how many one commits. They cannot &quot;add up&quot; to collectively constitute a mortal sin, but their accumulation does lead to being more vulnerable to committing mortal sin. There are cases where repeat offenses may become a grave matter. For instance, if one were to steal small amounts of property from a particular person, over time one would have stolen enough that it would develop into a serious theft from that person.

Catholics believe that followers should not take venial sin lightly, especially when committed deliberately. No one without a special grace (generally taken to apply only to the Virgin Mary) can avoid even semi-deliberate venial sins entirely (according to the definition of Trent). But to avoid mortal sins followers must seek (as far as possible) to overcome venial sins. The Magisterium says that although a number of venial sins do not themselves add up to a mortal sin, each venial sin weakens the will further, and the more willing one becomes in allowing such falls, the more one is inclined towards and will inevitably fall into mortal sins if one continues along this path.

In Lutheranism, sins are of two classes:

<text>Damien Marchesseault (or Marchesseau) (April 1, 1818 – January 20, 1868) was a Canadian-born American politician who served as the seventh mayor of Los Angeles from May 9, 1859, to May 9, 1860, and then again from January 7, 1861, to May 6, 1865. Marchesseault assumed the office one last time interrupting Cristobal Aguilar&#x27;s first term in office for three months.

==Biography==
Born in St.-Antoine-sur-Richelieu, Quebec, Canada, Marchesseault was described as a carousing onetime New Orleans gambler. With Victor Beaudry, he started an ice vending company using ice from what is now known as Icehouse Canyon near Mount San Antonio.

During his term as Zanjero of Los Angeles (water steward), Marchesseault and a partner laid wooden water pipes that burst and turned streets into sinkholes.

Marchesseault killed himself on 20 January 1868, leaving a suicide note to his wife, Mary Clark Marchesseault, stating his motivation was shame from his drinking and gambling debts.

==Legacy==
Marcheassault Street in Los Angeles is named for him.

<doc id="357042" wikidata="Q4386898" url="?curid=357042" title="Jehudi Ashmun">
<text>Jehudi Ashmun (April 21, 1794 – August 25, 1828) was an American religious leader and social reformer from New England who helped lead efforts by the American Colonization Society to &quot;repatriate&quot; African Americans to a colony in West Africa. It founded the colony of Liberia in West Africa as a place to resettle free people of color from the United States.

Ashmun emigrated to Monrovia, Liberia in 1822, where he served as the United States government&#x27;s agent (de facto governor) for two different terms: one from August 1822 until April 1824, and another from August 1824 until March 1828. His wife died there. Suffering ill health, he returned to the United States and died later that year.

==Early life and education ==
Born in Champlain, New York, in 1794, Ashmun first studied at Middlebury College in Vermont. During his senior year, he studied at the University of Vermont. After graduation, he was ordained in Maine as a minister.

==Marriage and family==
Ashmun married in 1818 and his wife accompanied him to Bangor, Maine, where he took his first position.

==Career==
Ashmun was appointed as the first principal, and one of the first two professors, of the Bangor Theological Seminary in Bangor, Maine. He retained this professorship until 1827, despite leaving the country for a few years while living and working in the new colony of Monrovia, Liberia.

Drawn by other opportunities, Ashmun returned to the United States, settling in Washington, DC, where he worked as the editor of an Episcopalian monthly. Interested in the work of the American Colonization Society (ACS), he founded the newspaper &quot;The African Intelligencer&quot; and wrote about their mission.

His articles about the ACS, which was committed to &quot;repatriating&quot; free blacks to a newly founded colony in West Africa, led to Ashmun&#x27;s political appointment as representative of the U.S. government to the colony. While the project was privately funded, it was chartered by Congress. At the age of 26, Ashmun was the leader in 1822 of a group of settlers and missionaries to Liberia on the ship &quot;Elizabeth&quot;. His wife went with him but was among the many settlers who died of malaria and other tropical diseases in the new settlement.

As United States representative to Liberia as well as agent of the ACS, Ashmun served as governor of the colony for two periods of time, from 1822 to 1828, from ages 28 to 34. He took a leadership role in what he found to be a demoralized colony. He helped build the defenses of Monrovia against attacks by indigenous tribes, as well as against slave raiders, organizing the settlement&#x27;s successful defense against a much larger native force in November 1822. He also worked to develop the colony&#x27;s trade with the US, Great Britain, and Europe. During his tenure in Liberia, Ashmun increased agricultural production, annexed more lands from neighboring tribes, and exploited commercial opportunities in the interior.

He helped create a constitution for Liberia that enabled African Americans to hold positions in the government. African Americans and their descendants, known as Americo-Liberians, dominated the government into the late 20th century.

By contrast, in the early decades of the neighboring British colony of Sierra Leone, the government was dominated by whites. Freetown was originally founded for the resettlement of free blacks from Britain and Upper Canada (many of them were Black Loyalists and their descendants: freed African-American slaves who had joined the British for freedom during the American Revolutionary War).

Ashmun wrote numerous letters to ACS officials, family and friends in the United States. These and his book, &quot;History of the American Colony in Liberia, 1821–1823&quot; (1826), constitute the earliest written history of the Liberia colony.

==Death==
Suffering ill health in Liberia, Ashmun returned to the United States in 1828. He died in New Haven, Connecticut, soon after. He was interred there in Grove Street Cemetery.

==Legacy and honors==

Nearly a century after his death, a British history of Liberia called Ashmun &quot;one of the most remarkable men who have ever given their lives in the service of Africa and the African.&quot;

Lincoln University, a historically black college in Pennsylvania, was originally chartered in 1854 as Ashmun Institute in his honor.

<doc id="357050" wikidata="Q751041" url="?curid=357050" title="Alliance for Audited Media">
<text>The Alliance for Audited Media (AAM) is a North American not-for-profit industry organization founded in 1914 by the Association of National Advertisers to help ensure media transparency and trust among advertisers and media companies. Originally known as the Audit Bureau of Circulations (ABC), today AAM is a source of verified media information and technology platform certifications, providing standards, audit services and data for the advertising and publishing industries. 

In early 2023, AAM merged with BPA Worldwide to create the largest not-for-profit media auditing organization dedicated to increasing trust, transparency and assurance across the media industry.

It is one of more than three dozen such organizations operating worldwide, affiliated with the International Federation of Audit Bureaux of Circulations (IFABC).

== History ==
At the turn of the 20th century, the Association of National Advertisers (ANA) observed a market need for verifiable, authenticated circulation figures from print publishers. As a result, in 1914, advertisers, ad agencies and publishers in the U.S. and Canada united to form the first Audit Bureau of Circulations to bring trust and accountability to the print media market.

On November 15, 2012, ABC in North America rebranded its organization as the Alliance for Audited Media to reflect the new media environment and its members&#x27; evolving business models.

In March 2023, the Alliance for Audited Media and BPA Worldwide completed a merger to become the largest not-for-profit media auditing organization.

== Governance ==
AAM is governed by a tripartite board of directors composed of leaders in publishing, marketing and advertising. Together with a network of committees, the AAM board sets the standards by which print and digital media are measured and reported. AAM audited data is relied upon by marketers and ad agencies to plan for and buy media. This information is housed in an AAM database, disseminated via several complementary industry data providers (such as Gfk MRI and Kantar Media SRDS) and fed directly to proprietary databases of many large ad agencies and client-side marketers.

The organization is headquartered in Lisle, Illinois.

== Membership ==
Membership is open to all publishers, digital media companies, advertisers and advertising agencies. Additionally, any individual, firm or corporation that requires access to media data may apply for an associate membership. AAM serves as an industry forum, connecting advertisers, ad agencies and publishers to discuss issues and trends and set standards.

<doc id="357052" wikidata="Q884940" url="?curid=357052" title="Roger Sherman Baldwin">
<text>Roger Sherman Baldwin (January 4, 1793 – February 19, 1863) was an American politician who served as the 32nd Governor of Connecticut from 1844 to 1846 and a United States senator from 1847 to 1851. As a lawyer, his career was most notable for his participation in the 1841 &quot;Amistad&quot; case.

==Early life==
Baldwin was born in New Haven, Connecticut, the son of Simeon Baldwin and Rebecca Sherman. He was the maternal grandson of notable founding father Roger Sherman, the only person to sign all four great state papers of the U.S.: the Continental Association, the Declaration of Independence, the Articles of Confederation and the Constitution. Through his father he was descended from Robert Treat, Samuel Appleton and Simon Willard. Through his mother he was descended from Samuel Stone and William Blaxton. He attended Hopkins School, and entered Yale College at the age of fourteen, and graduated with high honors in 1811. At Yale, Baldwin was a member of the Linonian Society. After leaving Yale he studied law in his father&#x27;s office in New Haven, and also in the Litchfield Law School, and was admitted to the bar in 1814. Although repeatedly called into public office, he devoted himself through life to the profession of his choice, attaining the highest distinction, especially in the discussion of questions of law. His defense in 1841, of the rights of the Africans of the &quot;Amistad&quot;, is particularly celebrated, both for his ability and for the importance of the case.

==Political career==
After having been a member of the city government in New Haven, in 1826 and 1828, Baldwin was elected in 1837 and again in 1838 as a member of the Connecticut State Senate. In 1840 and 1841 he represented the town of New Haven in the General Assembly. He was elected Governor of Connecticut in 1844 by the state legislature, and was re-elected in 1845. In 1844, Governor Roger Sherman Baldwin proposed legislation to end slavery, but the General Assembly did not pass it until it was reintroduced in 1848 as &quot;An Act to Prevent Slavery&quot;. On the death of Senator Jabez W. Huntington in 1847, Baldwin was appointed by Governor Clark Bissell to fill the vacancy in the United States Senate, and in December of that year he took his seat as a member of that body. He was elected by the Legislature in the following May to the same position, which he held until 1851.

While in office he demanded an &quot;independent tribunal&quot; to protect the rights of free Black Americans and investigate the claims of those enforcing the Fugitive Slave Act. Some argued that Black Americans were not citizens and had no rights worth protecting. He reminded them that many states had allowed Black men of property to vote at the time of the nation&#x27;s founding, a right that was only rescinded in the 1830s.

After that period he held no public office, except that he was one of the presidential electors in the canvass of 1860, and by appointment of Governor William Alfred Buckingham was a delegate to the Peace Convention which met in Washington, in 1861, by request of the State of Virginia. He was described as a devout Christian who studied the Bible every day.

Baldwin died in New Haven, February 19, 1863; at the age of 70 and was interred at Grove Street Cemetery. A biographical discourse was pronounced at his funeral by Rev. Dr. Dutton, which was printed in the &quot;New Englander&quot; for April 1863, and was also published as a pamphlet.

==Family==
He was grandson of Roger Sherman, son of Simeon Baldwin, nephew of Ebenezer Baldwin, husband of Emily Pitkin Perkins, father of Connecticut Governor Simeon E. Baldwin, grandfather of New York Supreme Court Justice Edward Baldwin Whitney, and the great-grandfather of the famed Princeton University mathematics professor Hassler Whitney.

==In popular culture==
A simplified version of the events regarding the Amistad case were made into a movie called &quot;Amistad&quot; in 1997 in which Matthew McConaughey portrayed Roger Sherman Baldwin. In Greenwich, Connecticut, there is a town park called Roger Sherman Baldwin Park.

<doc id="357055" wikidata="Q180996" url="?curid=357055" title="Broad Peak">
<text>Broad Peak (; ) is one of the eight-thousanders, and is located in the Karakoram range spanning Gilgit-Baltistan, Pakistan and Xinjiang, China. It is the 12th highest mountain in the world with elevation above sea level. The first ascent of this mountain was in June 1957, accomplished by Fritz Wintersteller, Marcus Schmuck, Kurt Diemberger, and Hermann Buhl as part of an Austrian expedition.

==Geography==
Broad Peak is part of the Gasherbrum massif in Baltistan situated on the border of Pakistan and China. It is located in the Karakoram mountain range, approximately from K2. The peak&#x27;s name aptly describes its physical characteristics, with a summit that extends over 1.5 kilometers (7⁄8 miles) in length, giving it the appearance of a &quot;broad peak.&quot;

Three of the mountain&#x27;s five summits are eight-thousanders: Broad Peak (8051 m), Rocky Summit (8028 m), Broad Peak Central (8011 m), with Broad Peak North (7490 m), and Kharut Kangri (6942 m) being the other two peaks.

==Etymology==
The literal translation of &quot;Broad Peak&quot; to &quot;Falchan Kangri&quot; is not used among the Balti people. The English name was introduced in 1892 by the British explorer Martin Conway, in reference to the similarly named Breithorn in the Alps.

== Climbing history ==
The first ascent of Broad Peak was achieved between June 8 and 9, 1957 by Fritz Wintersteller, Marcus Schmuck, Kurt Diemberger, and Hermann Buhl of an Austrian expedition led by Marcus Schmuck. A first attempt by the team was made on May 29 where Fritz Wintersteller and Kurt Diemberger reached the forepeak (8,030 m). The first ascent took the West Spur and was accomplished without the aid of supplemental oxygen, high-altitude porters, or base camp support.

In July 2007, an Austrian mountaineering team climbed Broad Peak and retrieved the corpse of Markus Kronthaler, who had died on the mountain one year before, from over 8,000 metres.

In 2008, French mountaineer Élisabeth Revol made solo ascents of Broad Peak, Gasherbrum I and Gasherbrum II within 16 days and without the aid of supplemental oxygen.

In the winter and summer of 2009, there were no summits. There was one winter expedition by a Polish-Canadian team. In the summer there was one fatality, Cristina Castagna.

In the summer of 2012, five members of &quot;Koroška 8000&quot;, a Slovenian team led by Gregor Lačen, summitted the mountain without supplementary oxygen or high-altitude porters. They established a route in deep snow from Camp 4 to the summit, used by seven additional climbers from other expeditions. All summitted on July 31, 2012.

On March 5, 2013 Maciej Berbeka, Adam Bielecki, Tomasz Kowalski and Artur Małek made the first winter ascent and conquered the mountain peak without oxygen during the winter. Broad Peak was the twelfth eight-thousander summited in wintertime and the tenth eight-thousander first summitted in winter by the Polish climbers.
During the descent, Maciej Berbeka and Tomasz Kowalski did not reach Camp 4 (at 7400 m) and were pronounced missing. On March 7, the head of the expedition Krzysztof Wielicki, said there are &quot;no chances at all&quot; of finding alive 58-year-old Maciej Berbeka and 27-year-old Tomasz Kowalski.
On March 8 both climbers were declared dead and the expedition was ended.

In July 2013, a group of five Iranian climbers attempted to ascend through a new route from the southwestern face. Three of them — Aidin Bozorgi, Pouya Keivan, and Mojtaba Jarahi — ascended successfully but during the descent all three of them were lost and declared dead.

On July 23, 2016, Frenchman Antoine Girard&#x27;s paraglider flight over Broad Peak was the first time a paraglider had flown above an 8,000-metre summit.

On July 14, 2019, 17-year-old Shehroze Kashif from Pakistan became the youngest ever to summit this peak.

In September 1780, he negotiated with Continental Army officer and turncoat Benedict Arnold, who secretly offered to turn over control of the American fort at West Point, New York to the British. Due to a series of mishaps and unforeseen events, André was forced to return to British lines from a meeting with Arnold through American-controlled territory while wearing civilian clothes.

André was captured by three Americans and was quickly identified and imprisoned; he was subsequently convicted of espionage by the Continental Army and executed by hanging on George Washington&#x27;s orders. His execution led to an outburst of anti-Americanism in Great Britain, and American painter John Trumbull was imprisoned as a result. André is typically remembered positively by historians, and several prominent leaders of the Patriot cause, including Alexander Hamilton and the Marquis de Lafayette, disagreed with the American decision to execute him.

==Early life==

John André was born on 2 May 1750, in London, England to wealthy Huguenot parents who had immigrated there from Continental Europe. His parents were Antoine André, a merchant from Geneva, and Marie Louise Girardot, who was born in Paris. André was educated at St Paul&#x27;s School, Westminster School, and in Geneva; he was briefly engaged to Honora Sneyd. In 1771, at the age of 20, he joined the British Army, being commissioned into the 23rd Regiment of Foot (Royal Welsh Fuzileers) at the rank of second lieutenant before quickly being promoted to lieutenant in the 7th Regiment of Foot (Royal Fusiliers). André took a leave of absence in Germany for nearly two years, before re-joining his regiment in British North America in 1774.

==American War for Independence==

He lived in the home of Caleb Cope, enjoying the freedom of the town, as André had given his word not to escape. In December 1776, he was freed in a prisoner exchange, and was promoted to the rank of captain in the 26th Regiment of Foot on 18 January 1777. In the same year, André was appointed as an aide-de-camp to Major-General Charles Grey, serving in the British expedition to capture Philadelphia and participating in the battles of Brandywine and Germantown. In September 1778, he accompanied Grey during Grey&#x27;s raid, and was sent back to Sir Henry Clinton as a dispatch bearer. After Grey returned to England, André was appointed as an aide-de-camp to Clinton with the rank of major.

André was met with a positive reception in American society, including in both Philadelphia and New York when they were under British military occupation. He had a lively and pleasant manner and could draw, paint, and create silhouettes, as well as sing and write verse. André was a prolific writer who carried on much of Clinton&#x27;s correspondence. He was fluent in English, French, German and Italian. André also planned and organised the elaborate 13-hour fête known as the Mischianza, staged in Philadelphia in May 1778 to honor General William Howe, Clinton&#x27;s predecessor, after Howe had resigned and was about to return to England. During his nearly nine months in Philadelphia, André lived in Benjamin Franklin&#x27;s house, from which it has been alleged that he removed several valuable items on Grey&#x27;s orders when the occupation of Philadelphia came to an end, including an oil portrait of Franklin by Benjamin Wilson.

=== Intelligence activities ===
In 1779, André became adjutant general of the British Army at the rank of major. By April of that year, he took charge of British intelligence operations in North America. In 1780, André briefly took part in Clinton&#x27;s invasion of the American South, which began with the successful siege of Charleston. Around this time, André took over control of British communication with Continental Army officer Benedict Arnold. Arnold was a popular general officer who had been wounded twice in battle, and was considered an American hero for his actions at the Battles of Saratoga. However, he had become bitter about the decline in his financial fortunes caused by the war, and the reluctance of the Continental Congress to grant him the promotions Arnold believed he deserved. 

Arnold&#x27;s Loyalist wife, Peggy Shippen, was one of the go-betweens in his correspondence with André. Arnold steadily provided the British with vital intelligence on American military movements and General George Washington&#x27;s strategies. His ultimate goal was to be the key player in helping the British achieve a decisive blow against American forces for which he would be handsomely rewarded. In pursuit of this plan, Arnold carefully maneuvered his way into the command of critical Continental Army fortifications at West Point, New York, secretly promising to surrender them to the British for £20,000 (approximately £3.62 million in 2021). Possession of the forts at West Point would deliver to the British effective control of the entire Hudson River waterway, and could have very well served as the death-blow to the Patriot cause. 

As the summer of 1780 came to an end, Arnold had at last taken command of West Point, and was in a position to facilitate a British takeover of the forts. André traveled up the Hudson River onboard the Royal Navy sloop-of-war &quot;Vulture&quot; to meet Arnold. The presence of &quot;Vulture&quot; on the river was discovered the following morning by two American soldiers, privates John Peterson and Moses Sherwood, on 21 September. From their position at Teller&#x27;s Point, they attacked &quot;Vulture&quot; with small arms fire. Seeking greater firepower, Peterson and Sherwood headed to Fort Lafayette at Verplanck&#x27;s Point to request cannons and ammunition from their commander, Colonel James Livingston.

During this pause in the skirmish, a small boat furnished by Arnold was steered to &quot;Vulture&quot; by Joshua Hett Smith. At the oars were the Colquhon brothers (both of whom were tenants of Smith) who reluctantly rowed the boat on the river to &quot;Vulture&quot;. Despite Arnold&#x27;s assurances, the brothers sensed that something was wrong. None of the trio knew Arnold&#x27;s purpose or suspected him of treason; all were told that his intentions were to assist the Patriot cause. Only Smith was told anything specific, and that was the false claim that it was to secure vital intelligence. The brothers finally agreed to row after Arnold mixed threats of arrest with a bribe of fifty pounds of flour for each man. They picked up André from &quot;Vulture&quot; and brought him ashore, where Arnold was waiting.

The two men conferred in the woods below Stony Point, New York on the river&#x27;s west bank until nearly dawn on September 22. Then, instead of returning to &quot;Vulture&quot;, André decided to continue their conversation, and with the sun coming up, he and Arnold rode several miles to Smith&#x27;s house in West Haverstraw, New York, owned by Thomas Smith, Joshua&#x27;s brother. That same morning, American troops at Teller&#x27;s Point, under the command of Livingston, began a two-hour cannonade against &quot;Vulture&quot; using cannon. &quot;Vulture&quot;, trapped by the Hudson&#x27;s tidal currents, sustained several hits before it was finally able to escape downriver. The retreat of &quot;Vulture&quot; stranded André on shore.

===Arrest===

Arnold persuaded André that his best option for returning to British lines was to travel overland, which meant that he would need to take off his uniform and put on civilian clothes. André carried six papers written by Arnold which were hidden in his stocking; they detailed to the British how to take the fort. In the event that André encountered American sentries, Arnold gave him a passport allowing him to travel under the name John Anderson. Arnold departed to return to his home, and Joshua Smith escorted André a few miles north, where the two men crossed to the east side of the Hudson River at King&#x27;s Ferry. André, who had expected to travel to and from the meeting by ship while dressed in full uniform, was now traveling by road, in civilian disguise. He was deep behind American lines, and risked arrest as a spy.

After spending the night in a local home, the two men continued on to the Croton River, the southernmost edge of the American lines. Here Smith left him and André continued south in hopes of coming into contact with one of the Loyalist groups who marauded through Westchester County, New York. He had been warned to keep inland, but André instead shifted west until he was riding down the Albany Post Road, which followed the edge of the Hudson. André rode on safely until 9 a.m. on 23 September, when he arrived at the crossing of a stream known as Clark&#x27;s Kill (since renamed the André River). Here, three Americans: John Paulding, Isaac Van Wart and David Williams stopped him.

André believed that the trio were Loyalists because Paulding was wearing the uniform of a Hessian soldier. Paulding had himself escaped from a British prison only days earlier, aided by a sympathetic Loyalist who provided him with the uniform. &quot;Gentlemen,&quot; André said, &quot;I hope you belong to our party.&quot; &quot;What party?&quot; asked one of the trio. &quot;The lower party&quot;, replied André, referring to the British, whose headquarters were to the south. &quot;We do&quot; was their answer. André then declared that he was a British officer who must not be detained. To his surprise, Paulding informed him that &quot;We are Americans&quot; and took him prisoner. André then tried to convince the men that he was an American officer by showing them the passport Arnold had provided to him. However, the suspicions of his captors were now aroused; they searched him and found Arnold&#x27;s papers and the plans for West Point hidden in his stocking. Only Paulding could read and Arnold was not the subject of suspicion. André offered them his horse and watch to let him go, but they declined.

André later testified at his trial that the trio searched his boots for the purpose of robbing him. Whether or not this was true, the laws of New York at the time permitted the men to keep whatever property they might take from a Loyalist&#x27;s person. Paulding suspected that André was a spy and took him to Continental Army&#x27;s frontline headquarters in Sands Mill, a hamlet within North Castle, New York that was situated on the Connecticut border of Westchester County. At first, all went well for André: the post commandant, Lieutenant-Colonel John Jameson, unsure as to Arnold&#x27;s role in André&#x27;s mission, decided to send him back to Arnold&#x27;s home close to West Point. However, Major Benjamin Tallmadge, head of Continental Army intelligence, arrived and was considerably more suspicious of Arnold&#x27;s part in the episode. He persuaded Jameson to send a rider to bring André back.

Jameson sent Washington the six sheets of paper carried by André, but he hedged his bets about Arnold; Jameson knew that his own career would be in jeopardy if he treated Arnold with suspicion and Arnold were absolved of guilt. In place of André himself, he sent Arnold a letter informing him of André&#x27;s capture. Arnold received Jameson&#x27;s note while at breakfast with his officers, made an excuse to leave the room, and rushed upstairs to confer with his wife. Soon after, he made his escape to the Hudson, where he boarded his personal barge and ordered the crew to row him to the &quot;Vulture&quot;, which had returned to its northerly position on the river. Arnold turned himself over to the ship&#x27;s commander, who promptly sailed for New York to deliver Arnold to Clinton. An hour or so later, Washington arrived at West Point with his party; he had not yet received Jameson&#x27;s letter or the incriminating documents, and as yet knew nothing of Arnold&#x27;s betrayal or his flight. Washington was disturbed to see the stronghold&#x27;s fortifications in such neglect, which was part of Arnold&#x27;s plan to weaken West Point&#x27;s defenses. He was further irritated to find that Arnold had breached protocol by not being present to greet him. 

Finally, several hours later, Washington returned to Arnold&#x27;s home and headquarters on the eastern side of the Hudson, where the documents taken from André were presented to him. Instantly grasping the meaning and significance of the papers, Washington quickly sent men to try to intercept Arnold, but it was too late. André, meanwhile, was held in South Salem, New York, and then briefly at Arnold&#x27;s home, before being transferred across the Hudson to the Continental Army headquarters in Tappan, New York. According to Tallmadge&#x27;s account of the events, he and André conversed during the latter&#x27;s captivity and transport to Tappan. André wanted to know how he would be treated by Washington. Tallmadge had been a classmate of Nathan Hale while the two were studying at Yale College, and he spoke to André of Hale&#x27;s capture, and what Tallmadge considered to be his cold-blooded execution by the British. André asked whether Tallmadge thought the situations similar; he replied, &quot;Yes, precisely similar, and similar shall be your fate.&quot;

==Trial and execution==

Washington convened a board of senior Continental Army officers to investigate the matter. The board consisted of major generals Nathanael Greene (presiding officer), William Alexander, Arthur St. Clair, the Marquis de Lafayette, Robert Howe and Friedrich Wilhelm von Steuben, brigadier generals Samuel H. Parsons, James Clinton, Henry Knox, John Glover, John Paterson, Edward Hand, Jedediah Huntington and John Stark, and Judge Advocate General John Laurance. André&#x27;s defence was that he was suborning an enemy officer, &quot;an advantage taken in war&quot;. He told the board that he had neither desired nor planned to be behind American lines, but had been summoned ashore by Arnold and stranded there accidentally when &quot;Vulture&quot; sailed away. He also asserted that, as a prisoner of war, he had the right to escape in civilian clothes.

On 29 September 1780, the board found André guilty of being behind American lines &quot;under a feigned name and in a disguised habit&quot; and ordered that &quot;Major André, Adjutant-General to the British Army, ought to be considered as a spy from the enemy, and that agreeable to the law and usage of nations, it is their opinion, he ought to suffer death.&quot; Sir Henry Clinton did all that he could to save André, his favourite aide-de-camp. However, in their written negotiations Washington demanded that in exchange for André, Clinton must give the Americans Arnold, who was now under British protection in New York. Clinton personally detested Arnold, but declined to hand him over to the Americans. From the time of his arrest, André endeared himself to the Americans, some of whom lamented his death sentence as much as the British. Alexander Hamilton in particular was thoroughly charmed by André, writing that &quot;He united a peculiar elegance of mind and manners, and the advantage of a pleasing person&quot;.

As his date of execution approached, André appealed to Washington to be executed by firing squad as a soldier, rather than hanged as was customary for spies: &quot;I trust that the request that I make to your Excellency at this serious period, and which is to soften my last moments, will not be rejected. Sympathy towards a soldier will surely induce your Excellency and a military tribunal to adapt the mode of my death to the feelings of a man of honor.&quot; Washington refused his request. André was hanged by the Continental Army as a spy in Tappan on 2 October 1780. According to witnesses, he placed the noose around his own neck and tightened it. The day before his hanging, André drew a likeness of himself with pen and ink, which is now owned by Yale College. A religious poem was found in his pocket after his execution, written two days beforehand. Lafayette was reported to have wept at the execution of André. Alexander Hamilton wrote of him: &quot;Never perhaps did any man suffer death with more justice, or deserve it less.&quot;

===Eyewitness accounts===
An eyewitness account of André&#x27;s last day can be found in the book &quot;The American Revolution: From the Commencement to the Disbanding of the American Army Given in the Form of a Daily Journal, with the Exact Dates of all the Important Events&quot;:

October 2d. – Major André is no more among the living. I have just witnessed his exit. It was a tragical scene of the deepest interest. During his confinement and trial, he exhibited those proud and elevated sensibilities which designate greatness and dignity of mind. Not a murmur or a sigh ever escaped him, and the civilities and attentions bestowed on him were politely acknowledged. Having left a mother and two sisters in England, he was heard to mention them in terms of the tenderest affection, and in his letter to Sir Henry Clinton, he recommended them to his particular attention. The principal guard officer, who was constantly in the room with the prisoner, relates that when the hour of execution was announced to him in the morning, he received it without emotion, and while all present were affected with silent gloom, he retained a firm countenance, with calmness and composure of mind. Observing his servant enter the room in tears, he exclaimed, &quot;Leave me till you can show yourself more manly!&quot; His breakfast being sent to him from the table of General Washington, which had been done every day of his confinement, he partook of it as usual, and having shaved and dressed himself, he placed his hat upon the table, and cheerfully said to the guard officers, &quot;I am ready at any moment, gentlemen, to wait on you.&quot; The fatal hour having arrived, a large detachment of troops was paraded, and an immense concourse of people assembled; almost all our general and field officers, excepting his excellency and staff, were present on horseback; melancholy and gloom pervaded all ranks, and the scene was affectingly awful. I was so near during the solemn march to the fatal spot, as to observe every movement, and participate in every emotion which the melancholy scene was calculated to produce.

&quot;A Biographical Sketch of the Most Prominent Generals&quot; by James Thacher, a surgeon in the American Revolutionary Army contains:

Major André walked from the stone house, in which he had been confined, between two of our subaltern officers, arm in arm; the eyes of the immense multitude were fixed on him, who, rising superior to the fears of death, appeared as if conscious of the dignified deportment which he displayed. He betrayed no want of fortitude, but retained a complacent smile on his countenance, and politely bowed to several gentlemen whom he knew, which was respectfully returned. It was his earnest desire to be shot, as being the mode of death most conformable to the feelings of a military man, and he had indulged the hope that his request would be granted. At the moment, therefore, when suddenly he came in view of the gallows, he involuntarily started backward, and made a pause. &quot;Why this emotion, sir?&quot; said an officer by his side. Instantly recovering his composure, he said, &quot;I am reconciled to my death, but I detest the mode.&quot; While waiting and standing near the gallows, I observed some degree of trepidation; placing his foot on a stone, and rolling it over and choking in his throat, as if attempting to swallow. So soon, however, as he perceived that things were in readiness, he stepped quickly into the wagon, and at this moment he appeared to shrink, but instantly elevating his head with firmness he said, &quot;It will be but a momentary pang,&quot; and taking from his pocket two white handkerchiefs, the provost-marshal, with one, loosely pinioned his arms, and with the other, the victim, after taking off his hat and stock, bandaged his own eyes with perfect firmness, which melted the hearts and moistened the cheeks, not only of his servant, but of the throng of spectators. The rope being appended to the gallows, he slipped the noose over his head and adjusted it to his neck, without the assistance of the awkward executioner. Colonel Scammel now informed him that he had an opportunity to speak, if he desired it; he raised the handkerchief from his eyes, and said, &quot;I pray you to bear me witness that I meet my fate like a brave man.&quot; The wagon being now removed from under him, he was suspended, and instantly expired; it proved indeed &quot;but a momentary pang.&quot; He was dressed in his royal regimentals and boots, and his remains, in the same dress, were placed in an ordinary coffin, and interred at the foot of the gallows; and the spot was consecrated by the tears of thousands...
==Legacy==
On the day of his capture, James Rivington published André&#x27;s poem &quot;The Cow Chace&quot; in his gazette in New York. In the poem, André muses on the American defeat at the Battle of Bull&#x27;s Ferry. Nathan Strickland, André&#x27;s executioner, who was detained at the Continental Army camp in Tappan during André&#x27;s trial due to being a Loyalist, was granted freedom for accepting the duty of hangman and returned to his home in the Ramapo Valley or Smith&#x27;s Cove; nothing further of him is known. Joshua Smith, whose connection&#x27;s to André were discovered, was also brought to trial at the Reformed Church of Tappan. The trial lasted four weeks and ended in Smith being acquitted due to a lack of evidence. The Colquhon brothers, as well as a Continental Army major named Keirs, under whose supervision the boat was obtained, were exonerated from all suspicion.

After news of André&#x27;s execution reached Great Britain, there was an outburst of anti-Americanism and American painter John Trumbull was arrested for treason, since he was known to be a former Continental Army officer of a similar rank to André. He was released after seven months of imprisonment. A pension was awarded by the British to André&#x27;s mother and three sisters not long after his death; and his brother William André was made a baronet in his honor in 1781 (see André baronets). In 1804 a memorial plaque by Charles Regnart was erected in the Grosvenor Chapel in London, to John&#x27;s memory. In 1821, at the behest of the Duke of York, his remains, which had been buried under the gallows, were removed to England and placed among kings and poets at Westminster Abbey, in the nave, under a marble monument depicting Britannia alongside a British lion mourning André&#x27;s death. In 1879 a monument was unveiled on the place of his execution at Tappan.

The United States Congress gave each of André&#x27;s captors: Paulding, Williams, and Van Wart, a silver medal, known as the Fidelity Medallion, and a pension of $200 a year. That came close to the annual pay of a Continental Army&#x27;s infantry ensign in 1778. All were honored in the names of counties in Ohio, and Van Wert became the namesake of Van Wert, Ohio. In 1853, a monument was erected to their memory on the place where they captured André. It was re-dedicated in 1880 and today is located in Patriot&#x27;s Park on U.S. Route 9. The memorial is along the boundary between Tarrytown and Sleepy Hollow in Westchester County. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1982. One of the buildings in the towns&#x27; unified school district is today known as the John Paulding School.
==In popular culture==
The 1798 play &quot;André,&quot; based on Major André&#x27;s execution, is one of the earliest examples of American tragedy. Clyde Fitch&#x27;s play &quot;Major André&quot; opened on Broadway in November 1903, but was not a success, possibly because the play attempted to portray André as a sympathetic figure.

In Washington Irving&#x27;s short story, &quot;The Legend of Sleepy Hollow&quot;, the townspeople describe the site of the capture of Major John André, in particular a tulip-tree, as one of the haunted locations in Sleepy Hollow. Ichabod Crane later passes the tree himself just before he encounters the Headless Horseman.

The young adult fiction book &quot;Sophia&#x27;s War&quot; by Avi is about a young girl becoming a spy and foiling his plot.

André has been portrayed several times in film and television:
* by Michael Wilding as an eloquent and dignified idealist in the 1955 Hollywood film &quot;The Scarlet Coat&quot;
* by JJ Feild in the TV series &quot;&quot;
* by William Beckley in season 4, episode 26 of the sci-fi TV series &quot;Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea&quot;
* by Eric Joshua Davis in the TV series &quot;Sleepy Hollow&quot;
* by John Light in the movie &quot;Benedict Arnold: A Question of Honor&quot;.

<text>Simeon Eben Baldwin (February 5, 1840 – January 30, 1927) was an American jurist, law professor, and politician who served as the 65th governor of Connecticut.

==Education==
The son of jurist, Connecticut governor and U.S. Senator Roger Sherman Baldwin and Emily Pitkin Perkins, Baldwin was born and lived for much of his life in New Haven, Connecticut, and was one of nine children. Among his ancestors were the initial five governors of the Connecticut Colony. Another ancestor was Roger Sherman, a signatory to the Declaration of Independence. His father had served from 1844 to 1846 as the governor of Connecticut.

As a boy he attended the Hopkins Grammar School in New Haven, Connecticut. Active in all its alumni work, he was, more specifically, for many years president of its board of trustees; in 1910, on the occasion of the two hundred and fiftieth anniversary of the founding of the school, he delivered a discourse on its history; when shortly before his death it became necessary to house the school in new quarters, he was one of the largest, if not the largest, of the individual donors whose contributions made possible a set of modern buildings for what he was fond of referring to as the fourth oldest institution of learning in the United States.

From the Hopkins Grammar School he went to Yale College, from which he was graduated with the class of 1861. There is scant information as to his four years at college. During that period he kept a diary from which he read extracts on the fifty-fifth reunion of his class, but this diary is not at present available. That the studious traits which he later manifested were not altogether lacking at this time may be inferred from the fact that he was elected a member of Phi Beta Kappa and Skull &amp; Bones. Such records as we have do not indicate that there was anything unusual about this young student who had among his classroom contemporaries the poet Edward Rowland Sill, and two others who like himself were later to have much to do with the life of the university, his friends Tracy Peck and Franklin Bowditch Dexter.

==Early years==
For the two years following his graduation from college he studied law at Yale, at Harvard, and in his father&#x27;s office. In 1863 he was admitted to the bar and began the practice of law. His seventeen years of service as an associate justice and chief justice of the supreme court of Connecticute state and his four years as governor in the latter part of his life, may have obscured for his later contemporaries the fact that he was also a successful lawyer. In the practice of the law he won distinction both in his own state and outside, and with it the financial emoluments that usually accompany success at the bar. He was keenly alive to the practical side of the lawyer&#x27;s work and never lost his zest for it. Till almost the very end of his life he maintained a law office, which he visited daily as long as his health would permit, and kept adding to his law library. As late as 1919 his book &quot;The Young Man and the Law&quot; revealed him still at heart a lawyer. In 1878, he was one of the founders of the American Bar Association and served as president of the American Bar Association from 1890 to 1891.

During the middle portion of his life he was actively engaged in teaching law. Here also he showed ability. One who studied law under him and like him became chief justice of the supreme court of errors of Connecticut says that his old pupils regard his work as a teacher &quot;as more distinctive and weightier in influence upon human life than any other portion of his work. Probably in his day not a half dozen teachers of the law in our country could be placed in his class&quot; (&quot;American Bar Association Journal&quot;, February 1927, p. 74).

From 1897 to 1910, Baldwin was a member of the Connecticut State Supreme Court, where he presided as chief justice from 1907 to 1910.

For twelve years (1907–1919) he was the director of the American Bar Association&#x27;s Comparative Law Bureau (as well as its &quot;Annual Bulletin&quot;&#x27;s editor for general jurisprudence).

To the same effect may be interpreted the action of the Association of American Law Schools, which in 1902 elected him its president. In 1869 he was appointed as a professor of law to the faculty of the Yale Law School, then in a moribund condition. His active participation in the affairs of that school was to continue for just fifty years, for it was not until 1919 that he retired as professor emeritus. The revival of the law school was largely his work. He increased the size of the faculty, instituted new courses, developed graduate work, and for a long time carried much of the financial responsibility for the school&#x27;s existence (&quot;Yale Law Journal&quot;, March 1927, p. 680). It was characteristic of him that when shortly before his retirement the method of teaching was changed to the so-called &quot;case system,&quot; to which Judge Baldwin, like most of his contemporaries, objected, he never for an instant changed his attitude of loyalty to the school, which some years later was to be most generously remembered in his will.

Following four years of research, he released &quot;Baldwin&#x27;s Connecticut Digest&quot; in 1871, which supported Connecticut attorneys with their research and also brought clients to his own legal practice. The same year, he became legal counsel to the New York and New England Railroad, and by the mid-1880s, he was a leading railroad and business attorney.

In addition to his work as lawyer and teacher he took an active part in the public affairs of New Haven. He served on the Public Parks commission, on the New Haven common council, and on the board of directors of the New Haven Hospital. Deeply interested in religious work, he was president of the New Haven Congregational Club and of the YMCA. From 1884 until 1896 he was president of the New Haven Colony Historical Society, for which he wrote many papers mostly on subjects of history.

==Political life==
Even more diversified than his activities in local affairs was his participation in those that concerned the state as a whole. Never a politician, and to the end of his days allowing such honors and offices as came to him to come unsought and unfought for, he nevertheless early became identified with the political life of his state. Starting as a Republican, he was nominated for state senator from the fourth district in 1867, but was not elected. In 1884 he was one of the &quot;independents&quot; who refused to support James G. Blaine, and was chosen president of the Republican organization in Connecticut.

The greatest of his political honors came to him when he was an old man. Automatically retired from the position of chief justice of the supreme court, February 5, 1910, because he had reached the age limit of seventy years, he that year was nominated for governor on the Democratic ticket and was elected the governor of Connecticut.

In June 1912, at the Democratic National Convention he received twenty votes for the presidential nomination. In November of the same year he was elected the governor of Connecticut, nominally strongly Republican, for a second term of two years. Both the Corrupt Practices Act and a civil service law instituting a merit system for state employees were enacted during his administration, along with numerous laws affecting working conditions. 

He was Democratic candidate for United States senator from Connecticut for the term beginning March 4, 1915. Caught in a Republican landslide and defeated by incumbent Senator Frank B. Brandegee, he nevertheless ran ahead of his party ticket by several thousand votes.

It was inevitable that the high regard in which he was held as a lawyer should lead to his being named on various state commissions of reform. In 1872, less than a decade after he began to practice law, the Connecticut legislature elected him one of a commission of five that made the Revision of 1875, the General Statutes of the State of Connecticut. In the same year he was a member of a state commission appointed to revise the education laws. Six years later he was named by the governor of Connecticut acting under a resolution of the state legislature one of a commission of five to inquire into the feasibility of simplifying legal procedure. This commission drew up a set of rules and forms which were approved and adopted by the court as the basis of pleading in civil cases.

In 1886 a commission was appointed to report on a better system of state taxation. He was a member of that commission and drew the report. Again in 1915-17 he was chairman of a commission established by the State to revise its system of taxation. But his participation in state affairs was not merely political and legal; he was also actively associated with charitable and religious organizations. At one time or another he was a director of the General Hospital Society of Connecticut and a director of the Missionary Society of Connecticut; he served as moderator of the General Conference of Congregational Churches of Connecticut, and he was a delegate of the Congregational Churches to the national council.

His scholarship and his interest in questions of the day led him into affiliations with many of the learned societies. Nor were these affiliations perfunctory only. He regularly attended the society meetings, wrote papers for them, and rose to the highest places in their councils. He was president of the American Social Science Association (1897), International Law Association (1899), American Historical Association (1905), Political Science Association (1910), American Society for the Judicial Settlement of International Disputes (1911), Connecticut Academy of Arts and Sciences, Connecticut Society of the Archaeological Institute of America (1914). He was vice-president of the Archaeological Institute of America (1898) and of the social and economic science section of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (1903). He was an associate of the Institute of International Law. He was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1912. He was a member also of the National Institute of Arts and Sciences, American Philosophical Society, elected a member of the American Antiquarian Society in 1893, and a corresponding member of the Massachusetts Historical Society, Colonial Society of Massachusetts, and L&#x27;Institut de Droit Comparé. Baldwin was among the incorporators of Connecticut College at its founding in 1911, and he served on its board of trustees through 1924.

His connections with national and international matters touching law and its ramifications were not restricted to membership in learned societies. In 1899 he was appointed by the State Department a delegate from the United States to the Sixth International Prison Congress, which met the next year at Brussels. Again in 1905 he was United States delegate to a similar congress held at Budapest and was made its vice-president. At this congress he presented his report on the question &quot;By what principles and in what manner may convicts be given work in the fields, or other public work in open air?&quot; In 1904, appointed by President Roosevelt one of the delegates to represent the United States, he was elected vice-president of the Universal Congress of Lawyers and Jurists held in connection with the St. Louis Exposition of that year.

His writings cover a number of fields. Among his more pretentious works are: &quot;A Digest of All the Reported Cases... of Conn.&quot; (2 vols., 1871, 1882), &quot;The historic policy of the United States as to annexation.&quot; (New Haven: Hoggson &amp; Robinson, 1893), &quot;Cases on Railroad Law&quot; (1896), &quot;Modern Political Institutions&quot; (1898), &quot;American Railroad Law&quot; (1904), &quot;The American Judiciary&quot; (1905), &quot;The Relations of Education to Citizenship&quot; (1912), &quot;Life and Letters of Simeon Baldwin&quot; (1919), &quot;The Young Man and the Law&quot; (1919). He was a most prolific writer of articles and pamphlets. Some ten years before his death he collected and presented to the Yale Law School nearly a hundred of these in four bound volumes which he entitled in order of numbering: Law and Law Reform, Studies in History, International and Constitutional Law, and Studies in Legal Education and Social Sciences. While these titles very aptly classify his literary output the volumes themselves do not contain all his miscellaneous publications.

He was not above medium height, somewhat slight of figure and seemingly frail in physique, though this frailty was in appearance only as he was a man of tremendous, tireless energy. Although in no sense athletic, he made some sort of exercise in the open air each day almost a religious duty. At one time this took the form of bicycle rides, though he soon gave these up in favor of walking. His rule was to cover at least four miles a day, rain or shine, and there was no part of the less congested portions of New Haven and its environs over which he had not many times traveled as he walked unhurriedly alone, stooping somewhat, buried in thought, compelled by poor eyesight to keep his gaze fixed upon his path a few feet ahead of him. This methodical exercise he kept up until, in his last years, injuries received as the result of a fall confined him to his home.

His personality, externally at least, was cold, dignified, and grave. Some of those who knew him best say that he was in reality warm-hearted but the characteristics that made an impression on every one were his reserve and his austerity; in general he was an object of respect rather than of affection; he had none of the weaknesses that make men lovable. As deeply religious as any of his Puritan ancestors, he was most broadly tolerant of the beliefs of others. His conception of civic duty was Roman, but he was ever willing to oppose even the State in defending what he regarded as the constitutional and legal rights of the individual. He was frugal to such a degree that on one occasion when traveling as governor with his staff, instead of partaking of a sumptuous dinner in a dining car specially provided for them, he rode in a coach and ate a sandwich which he had brought from home. With this frugality he combined a generosity even more marked. Part of his life was lived in the days of high hats. Such hats, when they became old, were usually donated to the missionaries. To quote from one who for many years served with Judge Baldwin on the committee of a missionary society, &quot;He used to turn in his old high hat at the shop for fifteen cents, but he would give $1,500 to the committee for missions.&quot; He was unyielding where a principle was involved; but in matters of mere policy he had the remarkable ability, once he was outvoted, to make the policy of the majority his own even though he had strenuously opposed it.

Quiet and unassuming in manner he could be aggressive when he deemed it necessary, as he did in his controversy with Roosevelt when the latter dared to ridicule his ability as a judge. Prompt and unfailing in meeting appointments, unimportant though they might be, he demanded the same consideration from others, even refusing to wait for dinner guests who might be late. Both by nature and training he was conservative, but not reactionary; his mind was open as well as active. If his plea for castration and whipping as generally applicable methods of punishing criminals savors of the archaic (&quot;Yale Law Journal&quot;, June 1899), he was capable also of starting nationwide comment, as on the radically new ideas embodied in his &quot;The Natural Right to a Natural Death&quot; (&quot;Journal of Social Science&quot;, 1889).

In January 1910 he published &quot;The Law of the Airship&quot; (&quot;American Journal of International Law&quot;), and in November &quot;Liability for Accidents in Aerial Navigation&quot; (Michigan Law Review, IX, 20). At his suggestion the Connecticut legislature (1911) passed a law regulating the use of flying machines, the first law to be enacted on this subject. France shortly afterward modeled her law on that of Connecticut.

In 1911 he had two articles on airship law in foreign journals (&quot;Revue de l&#x27;Institut de Droit Comparé&quot; and &quot;Zeitschrift für Völkerrecht und Bundesstaatsrecht&quot;). Notwithstanding his work in many fields, his real interest was always in modern law. He has been called an antiquarian, but his studies in this line did not go beyond colonial history, more particularly Connecticut history. Few men have played a more important part in so many activities that concerned their own community. When he was presented for the degree of LL.D. at the Yale Commencement in 1916 he was called, inter alia, &quot;the first citizen of Connecticut.&quot; No designation could have fitted him better. ―George Edward Woodbine 

== Personal life ==
He was the son of Roger Sherman Baldwin, brotherin-law of Dwight Foster (1828–1884), uncle of Edward Baldwin Whitney, grandson of Simeon Baldwin, and the great-grandson of Roger Sherman.

On 19 October 1865 he married Susan Mears Winchester, daughter of Edmund Winchester and Harriet Mears. Simeon and Susan had three children: Florence, Roger and Helen. In 1873, Susan was admitted to a mental health institution after developing a mental disorder subsequent to the demise of their daughter Florence in 1872. Her sister Charlotte assisted in the upbringing of the two remaining children, Roger and Helen, and oversaw the household.

He died January 30, 1927, in New Haven.

<text>A machine code monitor ( machine language monitor) is software that allows a user to enter commands to view and change memory locations on a computer, with options to load and save memory contents from/to secondary storage. Some full-featured machine code monitors provide detailed control (&quot;single-stepping&quot;) of the execution of machine language programs (much like a debugger), and include absolute-address code assembly and disassembly capabilities.

Motorola published the MIKBUG ROM monitor for the 6800 in 1973 and the BUFFALO ROM monitor for the 68HC11.

Machine code monitors became popular during the home computer era of the 1970s and 1980s and were sometimes available as resident firmware in some computers (e.g., the built-in monitors in the Commodore 128, Heathkit H89 and Zenith laptops). Often, computer manufacturers rely on their ROM-resident monitors to permit users to reconfigure their computers following installation of upgrade hardware, such as expanded main memory, additional disk drives, or different video displays.

It was not unheard of to perform all of one&#x27;s programming in a monitor in lieu of a full-fledged symbolic assembler. Even after full-featured assemblers became readily available, a machine code monitor was indispensable for debugging programs. The usual technique was to set break points in the code undergoing testing (e.g., with a BRK instruction in 6502 assembly language) and start the program. When the microprocessor encountered a break point, the test program would be interrupted and control would be transferred to the machine code monitor. Typically, this would trigger a register dump and then the monitor would await programmer input. Activities at this point might include examining memory contents, patching code and/or perhaps altering the processor registers prior to restarting the test program.

In most systems where higher-level languages are employed, debuggers are used to present a more abstract and friendly view of what is happening within a program. However, the use of machine code monitors persists, especially in the area of hobby-built computers.

<doc id="357064" wikidata="Q456454" url="?curid=357064" title="Lyman Beecher">
<text>Lyman Beecher (October 12, 1775 – January 10, 1863) was a Presbyterian minister, and the father of 13 children, many of whom became writers or ministers, including Harriet Beecher Stowe, Henry Ward Beecher, Charles Beecher, Edward Beecher, Isabella Beecher Hooker, Catharine Beecher, and Thomas K. Beecher.

According to his son Henry Ward Beecher, his father was &quot;largely engaged during his life-time in controversy&quot;. However, &quot;he was also the most respected religious voice of his era. ...[H]e seemed also to embody all of the nation&#x27;s moral ideals, in representing the established clergy, who looked to him for leadership.&quot;

==Early life==
Beecher was born in New Haven, Connecticut, to David Beecher, a blacksmith, and Esther Hawley Lyman. His mother died shortly after his birth, and he was committed to the care of his uncle Lot Benton, by whom he was adopted as a son, and with whom his early life was spent blacksmithing and farming. But it was soon found that he preferred study. He was fitted for college by the Rev. Thomas W. Bray, and at the age of eighteen entered Yale College, graduating in 1797. He spent much of 1798 at Yale under the tutelage of his mentor Timothy Dwight.

==Ministry==
===Ministry on Long Island in New York (1798–1810) ===
In September 1798, he was licensed to preach by the New Haven West Association, and entered upon his clerical duties by supplying the pulpit in the Presbyterian church at East Hampton, Long Island, and was ordained in 1799. Here he married his first wife, Roxana Foote. His salary was $300 a year plus firewood, after five years increased to $400 (), with a dilapidated parsonage. To eke out his scanty income, his wife opened a private school, in which he was an instructor. Following Aaron Burr and Alexander Hamilton&#x27;s 1804 duel, Beecher gained popular recognition when he gave a sermon before the Presbytery of Long Island which was promptly published as &quot;The Remedy for Duelling&quot; in 1806.

=== Ministry in Litchfield, Connecticut (1810–1826) ===
Finding his salary wholly inadequate to support his growing family, he resigned the charge at East Hampton, and in 1810 moved to Litchfield, Connecticut, where he was minister for 16 years at First Congregational Church of Litchfield, the town&#x27;s Congregational church. There he started to preach Calvinism. He purchased the home built by Elijah Wadsworth and reared a large family.

==== Temperance ====
Alcohol intoxication or drunkenness, known as &quot;intemperance&quot; at the time, was a source of concern in New England as well as in other areas of the United States. Heavy drinking occurred even at some formal meetings of clergy, and Beecher resolved to take a stand against it. In 1826 he delivered and published six sermons on intemperance. They were sent throughout the United States, ran rapidly through many editions in England, and were translated into several languages in Europe, enjoying large sales even 50 years later.

==== Unitarian crisis and women&#x27;s education ====
During Beecher&#x27;s residence in Litchfield, the Unitarian controversy arose, and he took a prominent part. Litchfield was at this time the seat of the famous Litchfield Law School (1784–1833) and several other institutions of learning, and Beecher (now a doctor of divinity) and his wife undertook to supervise the training of several young women, who were received into their family. But here, too, he found his annual salary of $800 inadequate.

=== Ministry in Boston (1826–1832) ===
The rapid and extensive defection of the Congregational churches in Boston and vicinity, under the lead of William Ellery Channing and others in sympathy with him, had excited much anxiety throughout New England. In 1826 Beecher was called to Boston&#x27;s Hanover Church, where he began preaching against the Unitarianism which was then sweeping the area.

=== Leadership of Lane Seminary in Cincinnati (1832–1852) ===

The religious public had become impressed with the growing importance of the great West; a theological seminary had been founded at Walnut Hills, near Cincinnati, Ohio, and named Lane Seminary, after one of its principal benefactors. Beecher&#x27;s Hanover Street Church was severely damaged by fire in 1830, and the Board of Lane Seminary, hoping this might dispose him to a move, later that year offered him the presidency, with a salary of $20,000 (), but he turned it down. He accepted a second offer, in 1832. His mission there was to train ministers to win the West for Protestantism. Along with his presidency, he was also professor of sacred theology, and pastor of the Second Presbyterian Church of Cincinnati (later merged with First Presbyterian into modern-day Covenant First Presbyterian Church). He served as a pastor for the first ten years of his Lane presidency.

Beecher was also notorious for his anti-Catholicism, and soon after his arrival in Cincinnati authored the nativist tract &quot;A Plea for the West&quot;. His sermon on this subject at Boston in 1834 was followed shortly by the burning of the Catholic Ursuline Sisters&#x27; convent there. Catholics blamed Lyman, and charged that the arsonists had been &quot;goaded on by Dr. Lyman Beecher&quot;, but Lyman insisted that the sermon &quot;to which the mob ascribed&quot; was preached before his presence in Boston was generally known, and on the very evening of the riot, some miles distant from the scene, and that probably not one of the rioters had heard it or even &quot;knew of its delivery&quot;. Nevertheless, the convent was burned, and just at the season when Lyman was alerting Massachusetts to danger from the &quot;despotic character and hostile designs of popery&quot;.

==== Lane debates ====

Beecher&#x27;s term at Lane came at a time when slavery became an even larger issue, threatening to divide the Presbyterian Church, the state of Ohio, and the nation.

Like most important men of the 1820s, Beecher was a colonizationist, one who supported the American Colonization Society&#x27;s program of helping free Blacks emigrate to West Africa and set up there a black colony. He is reported to have reacted positively to an announcement of the planned debates on that topic at Lane. However, a June 4, 1834, meeting of the Cincinnati Colonization Society &quot;was addressed at length, by the Rev. Dr. Beecher, president of the Lane Seminary, who defended the society in an able manner, against some of the many charges brought against it, and endeavored to show the friends of abolition, that they might and ought to act in concert with the Colonization Society.&quot; He is quoted again as participating in a meeting of the same body on October 31, 1834.

But against a background of the Haitian Revolution, the French Revolution of 1830, the agitation in England for reform and against colonial slavery, and the punishment by American courts of citizens like Reuben Crandall who had dared to attack the slave trade carried on under the American flag, news about the brutal treatment of American slaves began to be heard. John Rankin&#x27;s &quot;Letters on Slavery&quot; had begun to direct the attention of Americans to the evils of slavery, and a new organization, the American Anti-Slavery Society, held its initial meeting in Philadelphia in 1833. Its president, Arthur Tappan, through whose generous donations Beecher had been induced to head the new Lane Seminary, forwarded to the students a copy of the address issued by the convention, and the whole subject was soon under discussion.

In February 1834, students at Lane, with national publicity, for 18 consecutive nights debated the colonization issue: whether the American Colonization Society, which sought to settle freed slaves in Africa, was worthy of support. The students did not have permission for the debate, but they were not stopped ahead of time. Most of them abandoned colonization as a hoax, replacing it with abolitionism. It was seen as a hoax because firstly it was logistically impossible to relocate more than a handful of freed slaves, and secondly according to Gerrit Smith, the colonization movement aimed to make slavery more defensible, not end it.

Many of the students were from the South, and an effort was made to stop the discussions and the meetings. Slaveholders from Kentucky came in and incited mob violence, and for several weeks Beecher lived in a turmoil, not knowing whether rioters might destroy the seminary and the houses of the professors. The Board of Trustees interfered during the absence of Beecher, and allayed the excitement of the mob by forbidding all further discussion of slavery in the seminary, even at meals, whereupon the students withdrew &quot;en masse&quot;. The group of about 50 students (who became known as the Lane Rebels) who left the seminary went to the new Oberlin Collegiate Institute, leaving Lane almost without students. Beecher believed himself blameless.

The well-reported events contributed significantly to the growth and spread of abolitionism in the northern United States. Beecher was neither aware of nor interested in Lane&#x27;s key role in publicizing abolitionism.

==== Heresy trial over New School sympathies ====
Although earlier in his career he had opposed them, Beecher stoked controversy by advocating &quot;new measures&quot; of evangelism (including revivals and camp meetings) that ran counter to traditional Calvinist understanding. These new measures at the time of the Second Great Awakening brought turmoil to churches all across America. Joshua Lacy Wilson, pastor of First Presbyterian (later merged with Second Presbyterian into modern-day Covenant First Presbyterian) charged Beecher with heresy in 1835.

The trial took place in his own church, and Beecher defended himself, while burdened with the cares of his seminary, his church, and his wife at home on her deathbed. The trial resulted in acquittal, and, on an appeal to the general synod, he was again acquitted, but the controversy engendered by the action went on until the Presbyterian church was divided in two. Beecher took an active part in the theological controversies that led to the excision of a portion of the general assembly of the Presbyterian church in 1837-38, Beecher adhering to the New School Presbyterian branch of the schism.

=== Move from Cincinnati to New York City (1852–death in 1863) ===

After the slavery controversy, Beecher and his co-professor Calvin Ellis Stowe remained and tried to revive the prosperity of the seminary, but at last abandoned it. The great project of their lives was defeated, and they returned to the East, where Beecher went to live with his son Henry in Brooklyn, New York, in 1852. He wished to devote himself mainly to the revision and publication of his works. But his intellectual powers began to decline, while his physical strength was unabated. About his 80th year he suffered a stroke of paralysis, and thenceforth his mental powers only gleamed out occasionally. After spending the last years of his life with his children, he died in Brooklyn in 1863 and was buried at Grove Street Cemetery, in New Haven, Connecticut.

== Legacy==
Beecher was proverbially absent-minded, and after having been wrought up by the excitement of preaching was accustomed to relax his mind by playing &quot;Auld Lang Syne&quot; on the violin, or dancing the &quot;double shuffle&quot; in his parlor.

Lyman Beecher&#x27;s house, on the former campus of the Lane Seminary in Cincinnati, Ohio, became the Harriet Beecher Stowe House. Harriet, his daughter, lived here until her marriage. It is the only Lane building still standing. It is open to the public and operates as an historical and cultural site, focusing on Harriet Beecher Stowe, the Lane Seminary, and the Underground Railroad. The site also documents African-American history. The Harriet Beecher Stowe House is located at 2950 Gilbert Avenue, in Cincinnati, Ohio.

==Personal life==
In 1799, Beecher married Roxana Foote, the daughter of Eli and Roxana (Ward) Foote. They had nine children: Catharine Esther, William Henry, Edward, Mary, Harriet (1808–1808), George, Harriet Elisabeth, Henry Ward, and Charles. Roxana died on September 13, 1816. The following year, he married Harriet Porter and fathered four more children: Frederick C., Isabella Holmes, Thomas Kinnicut, and James Chaplin. Of the thirteen Beecher children, nine went on to become writers. Harriet Porter Beecher died on July 7, 1835. On September 23, 1836, he married Samuel Beals&#x27; daughter Lydia Beals (September 17, 1789 – 1869), who had previously been married to Joseph Jackson (1779/10 – December 1833). Lydia and Beecher had no children.

<doc id="357067" wikidata="Q552548" url="?curid=357067" title="Sam Yorty">
<text>Samuel William Yorty (October 1, 1909 – June 5, 1998) was an American politician, attorney, and radio host from Los Angeles, California. He served as a member of the United States House of Representatives and the California State Assembly, but he is most remembered for his turbulent three terms as the 37th Mayor of Los Angeles from 1961 to 1973. Although Yorty spent almost all of his political career as a Democrat, he became a Republican in 1973.

==Early life==

Sam Yorty was born and raised in Lincoln, Nebraska, the son of Frank Patrick and Johanna (Egan) Yorty. His paternal grandfather was Pennsylvania Dutch, while the rest of his ancestors were Irish, his mother being a native of Clonmel, Ireland. He began his political education as the son of a Democratic father in a Republican state, with a mother who also showed a strong interest in politics. The family moved to Southern California when Yorty completed high school. He retained his Midwestern inflection and was known for pronouncing the city&#x27;s name as (with a hard &quot;G&quot;).

Yorty enrolled at Southwestern University and later the University of California at Los Angeles, working for a time at the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power. He was admitted to the bar in 1939.

Elected as a Democrat to the California State Assembly in 1936, Yorty established himself as a politician with integrity, but watched his popularity plummet when he reported a bribery attempt on a pending bill. Yorty advocated state ownership of public utilities and strong labor unions, showing a liberal approach to politics. His support of the Republicans in Spain&#x27;s civil war against General Francisco Franco and his fight against using the California Highway Patrol to end labor strikes helped earn him support of the local Communist Party United States of America organization. That support haunted Yorty in 1938, when he was branded a communist by Folsom Prison inmate Arthur Kent during testimony before the House Un-American Activities Committee. Kent, who claimed to have been a local membership chairman of the Communist Party, proved to be untrustworthy and Yorty was vindicated. That episode, plus the refusal of the local Communist Party to endorse him for mayor of Los Angeles that year, began a shift of Yorty&#x27;s political beliefs.

Losing a 1940 bid for U.S. Senator, when he ran unsuccessfully as a liberal internationalist against isolationist Republican and longtime incumbent Hiram Johnson, Yorty left politics during World War II to serve in the United States Army Air Corps in the Pacific Theater, attaining the rank of captain in the Intelligence Branch. He resumed his Assembly seat after his discharge. He was elected to the United States House of Representatives in 1950 and was reelected in 1952, but again lost his race for the U.S. Senate in 1954. In that special election for the two years remaining of the term of Richard M. Nixon, Yorty received 1,788,071 votes (45.5%) to Senator Thomas H. Kuchel&#x27;s 2,090,831 (53.2%). Kuchel, a liberal Republican, had been appointed to the seat in 1953 by then-Governor of California Earl Warren when Nixon became vice president.

==Mayoralty==

In 1960, Yorty endorsed fellow Californian Richard Nixon over Massachusetts Senator and fellow Democrat John F. Kennedy for president. This angered many in the Democratic Party.

Although municipal elections in California are non-partisan, the resources of the party were directed against him when he ran for mayor of Los Angeles the following year against incumbent Republican Norris Poulson. The bitter campaign was marked by Poulson&#x27;s claim that Yorty was backed by members of organized crime, a comment that caused Yorty to sue Poulson for $3.3 million.

Yorty prevailed, however, running as a populist. He railed against &quot;a little ruling clique&quot; of &quot;downtown interests&quot; and promised to revise the city charter, which had become unwieldy with the city&#x27;s growth from a quiet West Coast town to the third largest metropolis in the country. He was a strong advocate of expanding the freeway network. Perhaps his most popular promise was to end residents&#x27; sorting of wet and dry garbage; dry garbage was typically burned in backyard incinerators which contributed to the city&#x27;s notorious smog. There had been two independent collections: wet garbage (including food waste), and bottles and cans; dry combustible trash was burned in incinerators until Los Angeles County ordered an end to backyard trash burning in 1957, when Poulson was still mayor. After that, there were three collections: wet garbage, bottles and cans, and dry garbage.

He made good on his waste management and highway promises, and oversaw the emergence of Los Angeles as a major city. He was a backer of the Los Angeles Music Center, business districts such as Little Tokyo, and of the Los Angeles Zoo. He also made frequent appearances on &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson&quot;, which boosted his popularity. At the same time, he was a passionate anti-Communist, a critic of the Civil Rights Movement, and an outspoken opponent of desegregation busing and feminism.

In 1965, Yorty was reelected over Democratic Congressman James Roosevelt, son of the late President Franklin D. Roosevelt. Roosevelt&#x27;s campaign put up hundreds of billboards, handed out bales of bumper stickers and buttons, appeared often on television with 15-minute and half-hour shows, and was featured in so many other spots that his large presence in electronic media was criticized. Roosevelt&#x27;s campaign cost around $450,000, but Yorty spent less than half that amount. Roosevelt called Yorty a stooge of Democrat Jesse &quot;Big Daddy&quot; Unruh, the controversial California Assembly speaker. He attacked Yorty&#x27;s membership in a segregated private club and repeatedly criticized Yorty for having a bad temper. The often-irascible Yorty held his temper throughout the campaign, seeming almost cool in contrast to Roosevelt. He pointed to the fact that he had cut city taxes, streamlined city government and improved garbage pickups. He outpolled Roosevelt 392,775 (57.9 percent) to 247,313 (36.5 percent), with the remainder of votes going to six other candidates on the ballot.

Although Yorty was the first mayor to have a female deputy, Marion W. La Follette, and the first to have a racially integrated staff, his appeal did not extend to most of the city&#x27;s large African-American population. Disaffection with high unemployment and racism contributed to the Watts Riots of August 11–17, 1965. Yorty&#x27;s administration was criticized for failing to cooperate with efforts to improve conditions in neighborhoods such as Watts, but he accused other leaders of raising false hopes and of action by Communist agitators, having always categorically rejected any criticism of the city&#x27;s police or fire departments.

After the riots, Yorty challenged incumbent Democratic Governor Edmund G. (Pat) Brown in the 1966 gubernatorial primary. He received 981,088 votes (37.6%) to Brown&#x27;s 1,355,262 (51.9). Yorty&#x27;s politics shifted toward the right. This change became evident when he joined the election-night celebration of Brown&#x27;s successful opponent, Ronald W. Reagan. Yorty went to Vietnam to support the American troops and was thereafter dubbed &quot;Saigon Sam&quot; by his liberal opponents.

In 1967, Yorty was forced to deal with scandal after the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; published an exposé on the city&#x27;s harbor commission. The investigation led to the indictment and conviction of four city commissioners for bribery, while another was found dead in Los Angeles Harbor. The newspaper, which had long feuded with the mayor, noted that all of the individuals had been appointed by Yorty.

Support among the white middle classes fell after Yorty was embroiled in the controversy following the 1968 assassination of Robert F. Kennedy at the Ambassador Hotel. Yorty outraged prosecutors in the case by freely commenting on the evidence. Kennedy had told his supporters only moments before he was shot, &quot;Mayor Yorty has just sent me a message that we&#x27;ve been here too long already.&quot; 

During the fall of 1968, Yorty refused to endorse Democratic presidential candidate Hubert Humphrey. The strategy behind this approach was that Yorty would be rewarded with a cabinet post by Richard Nixon for his lack of support of Humphrey, but Nixon declined to offer him a position in the new administration. Continuing their adversarial relationship, the &quot;Times&quot; published an editorial cartoon by Paul Conrad lampooning this failure and Yorty responded with an unsuccessful lawsuit.

In the 1969 mayoral primary, Yorty&#x27;s popularity slipped well below that of Los Angeles City Council member Tom Bradley. The ensuing campaign between Yorty and Bradley, directed for Yorty by Henry Salvatori, proved one of the most bitter in the city&#x27;s history. Yorty painted his opponent as a dangerous radical, alternately of the black power or Communist revolutionary varieties. The charges were not plausible since Bradley had spent much of his career in the Los Angeles Police Department, but they resonated among fearful voters, and Yorty was re-elected.

Despite winning another four years, Yorty showed obvious signs of boredom in his position. He ran again for governor in 1970 but was handily defeated in the Democratic primary by State Assembly Speaker Jesse Unruh, 1,602,690 (61.4 percent) to 659,494 (26.3 percent). Unruh in turn was defeated by Reagan, who secured his second term as governor by a narrower margin than his 1966 majority over Pat Brown. Yorty began to leave all but the most important decisions to his staff.

After spending almost 40 percent of his time away from Los Angeles during the last half of 1971, Yorty announced on November 15 of that year that he was running for the Democratic nomination for President in 1972. Yorty had received strong support from influential &quot;Manchester Union Leader&quot; publisher William Loeb, stating that President Nixon had &quot;caved in&quot; to anti-war senators and that he had never agreed with the government&#x27;s policy on the war. In response to the question of what he would do, Yorty noted that Dwight Eisenhower had helped bring an end to the Korean War by threatening to use nuclear weapons.

However, Yorty received just six percent of the vote in the New Hampshire primary and was never able to gain any momentum in his bid for the nomination. He finally ended his bid shortly before the California primary in June 1972, asking voters to support Humphrey because of the &quot;radical&quot; nature of anti-Vietnam War candidate George McGovern. Yorty picked up the support of a young Louisiana delegate to the Democratic convention, Louis E. &quot;Woody&quot; Jenkins. After McGovern won the Democratic nomination for president, Yorty began to support Republicans.
In 1973, Bradley soundly defeated Yorty in a rematch of their 1969 race. In 1974, Yorty ran fourth in another bid for governor in the Democratic primary, far behind then-Secretary of State Jerry Brown, son of Pat Brown.

==Later career==
After leaving office, Yorty hosted a talk show on KCOP-TV for five years, later complaining that he was canceled in favor of the television program &quot;Hee Haw&quot;. After leaving work on the small screen, he returned to the political arena, but failed in a comeback bid for the Republican nomination for the U.S. Senate in 1980, having been defeated by the conservative Paul Gann, who in turn was badly beaten by incumbent liberal Democrat Alan Cranston. In 1981, Yorty failed again in a bid to unseat Bradley.

Afterward, Yorty retired from public life, aside from being a rainmaker for several law firms. He suffered a stroke on May 24, 1998, then contracted pneumonia. After treatment at the Encino-Tarzana Regional Medical Center, he returned to his Studio City home, where he died on the morning of June 5, at the age of 88. His death came on the 30th anniversary of Robert Kennedy&#x27;s assassination, and three months before Tom Bradley&#x27;s death. Yorty had told his wife that he wanted no funeral service.

Although none of his known work has survived, he is widely assumed to be the painter of a most influential fresco cycle preserved in the Campo Santo of Pisa, featuring &quot;The Three Dead and the Three Living&quot;, the &quot;Triumph of Death&quot;, the &quot;Last Judgement&quot;, the &quot;Hell&quot;, and the &quot;Thebais&quot; (several episodes from the lives of the Desert Fathers).

Painted some ten years before the Black Death spread over medieval Europe in 1348, the cycle enjoyed an extraordinary success after that date, and was often imitated throughout Italy during the Renaissance. The youngsters&#x27; party enjoying themselves in a beautiful garden while Death piles mounds of corpses all around is likely to have inspired the setting of Giovanni Boccaccio&#x27;s literary masterpiece &quot;The Decameron&quot;, written a few years after the spread of the Black Death (1348–1353).

==Reception==
Giovanni Boccaccio in his &quot;Decameron&quot; and Franco Sacchetti in his &quot;Il trecentonovelle&quot; both describe Buonamico Buffalmacco as being a practical joker. Boccaccio features Buonamico along with his friends and fellow painters Calandrino and Bruno in several tales (Day VIII, tales 3, 6, and 9; Day IX, tales 3 and 5). Typically in these stories, Buonamico uses his wits to play tricks on his friends and associates: convincing Calandrino that a stone he possesses (heliotrope) confers invisibility (VIII, 3), stealing a pig from Calandrino (VIII, 6), convincing the physician Master Simone of an opportunity to ally himself with the Devil (VIII, 9), convincing Calandrino that he has become pregnant (IX, 3), convincing Calandrino that a particular scroll can cause a woman to fall in love with him (IX, 5). Throughout the stories, Buonamico is frequently depicted at work painting in the houses of notable gentlemen in Florence but eager to take time to eat, drink, and be merry.

Italian art historian Giorgio Vasari included a biography of Buonamico Buffalmacco in his &quot;Lives of the Most Excellent Painters, Sculptors, and Architects&quot; (1550–1568), in which he tells several anecdotes about his comic escapades. Vasari tells of Buonamico&#x27;s youthful tricking of his master Tafi during his apprenticeship, various pranks and tricks that Buonamico played on his patrons, and his habit of embedding texts within his paintings. Dismissed by Vasari as just another of the witty painter&#x27;s gags, which his &quot;clumsy&quot; contemporaries had misunderstood and foolishly imitated, the frescoes located in the Campo Santo of Pisa are actually scattered with texts, a possible indication of the veracity of Vasari&#x27;s remark. In the scroll over the cripple beggars in the center of the &quot;Trionfo della Morte&quot; (&quot;Triumph of Death&quot;), for instance, it&#x27;s written: &quot;Since prosperity has completely deserted us, O Death, you who are the medicine for all pain, come to give us our last supper&quot;.
In the &quot;Trionfo della Morte&quot; (&quot;Triumph of Death&quot;), a group of leisurely young aristocrats and their animals occupy the central part of the fresco. These rich young men and women riding horses, surrounded by their decorative hunting dogs, have gone on a pleasant journey. But suddenly, their path, somewhere deep in the wood, is barred by three open coffins with corpses in different degrees of decomposition. Everybody in the scene including men, women, and even the animals are horrified by this terrible and palpable presence of Death. The unsupportable stench hits their noses and the abhorring scene of cruel truth dismays them. The elder monk standing above them teaches the youngsters a lesson about life and death by reading from a scroll.

Vasari discusses various paintings by the artist which no longer exist, and many of which had already perished by the time of Vasari&#x27;s writing in the 16th century. He describes a series of paintings at the convent of Faenza in Florence (already destroyed by the 16th century), works for the abbey of Settimo (now also lost), tempera paintings for the monks of the abbey of Certosa (also in Florence), and frescoes in the Badia at Florence. He describes a series of paintings depicting the life of Saint Catherine of Siena in a chapel in her honor in Assisi at the Basilica of Saint Francis (an attribution rejected by later scholars), and several prominent commissions at various abbeys and convents in Pisa. Vasari does not attribute the famed Pisan frescoes now associated with Buonamico to the painter, but rather, credits him with four frescoes preserved in the Campo Santo, depicting the Biblical narrative on the creation of the world through the building of Noah&#x27;s Ark, which later scholars have instead attributed to Piero di Puccio of Orvieto. Vasari further presents conflicting information regarding Buonamico&#x27;s death, dating it to the year 1340, but also stating that he was still alive in 1351. In any case, he is said to have died at the age of 78, in poverty, and to have been buried at the hospital of Santa Maria Novella, in Florence.

<text>Kingman Brewster Jr. (June 17, 1919 – November 8, 1988) was an American educator, academic and diplomat. He served as the 17th president of Yale University and as United States ambassador to the United Kingdom.

==Early life==

Brewster was born in Longmeadow, Massachusetts, the son of Florence Foster (née Besse), a 1907 Phi Beta Kappa graduate of Wellesley College, and Kingman Brewster Sr., a 1906 Phi Beta Kappa graduate of Amherst College and a 1911 graduate of the Harvard Law School. He was a direct lineal descendant of Elder William Brewster ( – April 10, 1644), the &quot;Mayflower&quot; passenger, Pilgrim colonist leader, and spiritual elder of the Plymouth Colony, through his son Jonathan Brewster. He was also descended from &quot;Mayflower&quot; passenger John Howland. He was a grandson of Charles Kingman Brewster and Celina Sophia Baldwin, and Lyman Waterman Besse and Henrietta Louisa Segee. His maternal grandfather, Lyman W. Besse, owned an extensive chain of clothing stores in the Northeast known as &quot;The Besse System.&quot; His paternal granddaughter is actress Jordana Brewster.

In 1923, when he was four, his parents separated and later divorced. Brewster and his surviving sister, Mary, were raised by their mother first in Springfield, Massachusetts, and later in Cambridge, Massachusetts. His mother was a firm influence but never overbearing. One of Brewster&#x27;s friends characterized her as &quot;one of those people whose presence you always felt when she was in the room.&quot; Another friend remembered that &quot;she knew poetry, she knew music, she knew art, she knew architecture, and believe me, she knew Kingman.&quot;

Brewster wrote that his mother was a &quot;marvelously speculative and philosophical type,&quot; a &quot;free-thinking spirit... given to far-out enthusiasms and delighting in sprightly arguments with her more intellectually-conventional friends.

His mother remarried in 1932 to Edward Ballantine, a music professor at Harvard University and composer she had known since childhood. Ballantine had no children of his own and was not interested in a parental role. Brewster&#x27;s uncle, Arthur Besse, stepped into the role of surrogate father.

==Marriage and family==
In 1942, while serving in the armed forces, Brewster married Mary Louise Phillips in Jacksonville, Florida. Phillips was born August 30, 1920, in Providence, Rhode Island, the daughter of Mary and Eugene James Phillips (he was a 1905 graduate of Yale College, and a 1907 graduate of Yale Law School). She graduated in 1939 from the Wheeler School and attended but did not graduate from Vassar College. She died on April 14, 2004, at her home in Combe, Berkshire, England, at 83. She was buried next to her husband in the Grove Street Cemetery.

Brewster and his wife had five children. Their granddaughter is actress Jordana Brewster. His first cousin was Janet Huntington Brewster (September 18, 1910 –December 18, 1998) who was an American philanthropist, writer, radio broadcaster, and relief worker during World War II in London. She was married to Edward R. Murrow (April 25, 1908 – April 27, 1965) who was an American broadcast journalist. His uncle, Stanley King, (May 11, 1883 – April 28, 1951) was the eleventh president of Amherst College, from 1932 to 1946.

==Education and war years==
After graduating from Belmont Hill School in Massachusetts, Brewster entered Yale College , joining the newly established Timothy Dwight residential college and graduating in 1941. Then, he became chairman of the &quot;Yale Daily News&quot;. During his junior year, he turned down an offer of membership in Skull and Bones, becoming a legend in Yale undergraduate lore.

Like many students at the time, he was an ardent opponent of the US entering World War II and was an outspoken noninterventionist. Brewster idolized fellow antiwar activist Charles Lindbergh, was entranced by Lindbergh&#x27;s Trans-Atlantic flight, and remained (in his words) &quot;bug-eyed about aviation&quot; his entire life. He invited Lindbergh in 1940 to speak at Yale. At the time of the invitation, Lindbergh was the nation&#x27;s best-known isolationist and the most prominent private citizen opposed to the war. He and Lindbergh strategized on the America First Committee, which Brewster had founded, along with other students at Yale, after the fall of France.

The founding members of the AFC included many of the East Coast universities&#x27; best and the brightest, from valedictorians to football all-Americans to campus newspaper editors. Many of the men later achieved national reputations. They included future President Gerald Ford; the first director of the Peace Corps, Sargent Shriver; future Supreme Court justice Potter Stewart, and US Representative Jonathan Brewster Bingham. The AFC became the most prominent organization in the struggle to keep America out of the European war.

Brewster also took great care to ensure that the noninterventionist movement on campus was not led by social outcasts or malcontents but by &quot;students who had attained relative respect and prominence during their undergraduate years.&quot; He emphasized repeatedly that his group represented mainstream campus opinion and that its views were &quot;in agreement with the great majority of Americans of all ages.&quot;

Before the end of his senior year, he had officially resigned from the committee after the passage of the Lend-Lease Act. Brewster said at the time, &quot;I still believe it outrageous to commit this country to the outcome of the war abroad and wish to limit that commitment as much as possible,&quot; he wrote Potter Stewart. However, &quot;the question from now on is not one of principle. It is one of military strategy and administrative policy.&quot;

Since the passage of Lend-Lease into law, &quot;there is no room for an avowed pressure group huing a dogmatic line. Whether we like it or not America has decided what its ends are, and the question of means is not longer a legislative matter. A national pressure group therefore is not aiming to determine policy, it is seeking to obstruct it. I cannot be a part of that effort.&quot;

With the attack on Pearl Harbor on the morning of December 7, 1941, he immediately volunteered for service in the US Navy. During World War II Brewster was a Navy aviator and flew on submarine-hunting patrols over the Atlantic. He served in the Navy from 1942 to 1946. After the war he entered Harvard Law School, becoming note editor and treasurer of the &quot;Harvard Law Review&quot;. In 1948, he received his law degree magna cum laude from Harvard Law School.

==Career==
===Marshall Plan===
Brewster&#x27;s first job after graduating was to accompany Professor Milton Katz to Paris, France, to serve as his assistant at the European headquarters of the Marshall Plan. Professor Katz, was a specialist in international law at Harvard Law School and the Deputy Chairman of the Commission for European Recovery, under Averell Harriman, the administrator of the United States Marshall Plan. Though he flourished in the job, Brewster stayed only one year. He returned in 1949, on Katz&#x27;s advice, to be a research associate in MIT&#x27;s Department of Economics and Social Science.

===Massachusetts Institute of Technology===
From 1949 and 1950, Brewster was a research associate in the Department of Economics and Social Science at Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

===Harvard University===
From 1950 to 1953, he was an assistant professor of law at Harvard University. From 1953 to 1960, Brewster was a full professor at Harvard Law School.

===Yale===
In 1960, Brewster accepted the post of provost at Yale, serving from 1960 to 1963. After the death of Yale&#x27;s president, A. Whitney Griswold, despite the fact that Brewster was considered Griswold&#x27;s logical successor, Yale conducted a lengthy, open, and (for Brewster) agonizing search, which lasted five months. On October 11, 1963, the Yale Corporation offered him the presidency by a vote of 13–2; the opposition came from two senior members of the Yale Corporation, who feared that the liberal Republican would push too hard for change in their beloved institution. He served as president of Yale University from 1963 to 1977.

Brewster was known for the changes he made to Yale&#x27;s faculty, curriculum, and admissions policies. He was president of the University when Yale began admitting women as undergraduates. Academic programs in various disciplines were expanded. He was also president when the faculty voted to terminate academic credit for the Reserve Officers Training Corps program in June 1971 because of the belief that the program made the University complicit in the war in Vietnam. Alumni relations grew testy at times, but fundraising increased throughout his tenure.

Brewster&#x27;s appointment of liberal theologian Rev. William Sloane Coffin to the post of university chaplain is described in Coffin&#x27;s autobiography, &quot;Once to Every Man&quot;. After his appointment, Coffin, a former CIA operative, Williams College chaplain and Skull &amp; Bones alum, became an ardent antiwar activist. In 1967, along with Benjamin Spock, Yale 1925, he organized a mass protest in Boston, Massachusetts, and then sent hundreds of draft cards back to the US Justice Department in Washington, D.C. When Brewster defended Coffin, who was arrested in 1968 with Spock for encouraging draft resistance, he did so citing academic freedom. The action only complicated his dealings with an increasingly-wary alumni association.

Brewster was chairman of the National Policy Panel of the United Nations in 1968. He was a member of the President&#x27;s Commission on Selective Service in 1966 and 1967 and of the President&#x27;s Commission on Law Enforcement and Administration of Justice from 1965 to 1967.

====Wallace affair====
In 1963, Governor George Wallace was invited by the Yale Political Union to speak at Yale. Brewster asked the Yale Political Union to revoke its invitation for security reasons. The result was a massive outcry across campus. The Woodward Report on free speech, commissioned by Brewster in 1974 was issued in 1975. Historian C. Vann Woodward chaired the committee, which labeled the so-called &quot;Wallace Affair&quot; an outright failure.

====Jack Langer/NCAA basketball affair====
In 1969—against the wishes of the NCAA—Yale Jewish center Jack Langer played for Team United States at the 1969 Maccabiah Games in Israel. He did so with the approval of Yale President Kingman Brewster, and the university said it would not stop Langer from &quot;what we feel is a matter of religious freedom.&quot; Thereafter, Yale played Langer in basketball games the following season. Brewster&#x27;s special aide said: &quot;There is no question that Jack Langer will continue to play basketball. We don&#x27;t care what they do - Jack Langer will play when the coach wants to use him.&quot; On January 15, 1970, the NCAA Council placed Yale University on two‐year &quot;full athletic probation&quot; in all sports.

====Black Panthers====
On April 23, 1970, during the New Haven Black Panther trials, Brewster spoke to the faculty at Yale. His remarks, which were leaked to the press, made that a day which would follow him for the rest of his life: &quot;I am appalled and ashamed that things should have come to such a pass in this country that I am skeptical of the ability of black revolutionaries to achieve a fair trial anywhere in the United States.&quot; This remark, made one week before the tumultuous May Day protests of the Black Panther trials, was decried in editorials and speeches across the country. Vice President Spiro T. Agnew jumped into the fray calling for Brewster&#x27;s immediate resignation.

McGeorge Bundy, the president of the Ford Foundation, addressed the Yale Club of Boston just days before the May Day demonstrations and assured his fellow alumni that &quot;one of the things I have observed about my friend Brewster is that he will deal with anyone and surrender his responsibilities to nobody.&quot;

Brewster inevitably would be judged on May Day&#x27;s outcome because he had opened his university to all those coming to New Haven to support the Panthers, even offering them food and shelter. Brewster knew that in the face of potential catastrophe, he had the support of other leaders cast from the same mold: friends and colleagues who shared his background and outlook.

On May 1, 1970, at ten minutes before midnight, bombers exploded three devices in the Yale hockey rink. Protesters threw rocks and bottles at the National Guardsmen and taunted the New Haven police. The authorities responded by tear-gassing the demonstrators. Yale chaplain, William Sloane Coffin, stated, &quot;All of us conspired to bring on this tragedy by law enforcement agencies by their illegal acts against the Panthers, and the rest of us by our immoral silence in front of these acts.&quot; Fortunately, there were no fatalities that evening.

President Richard Nixon commenting on the events of May 1, 1970, to the Shah of Iran, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, stated that to be fair to the students, they were not entirely to be blamed for their actions that day: &quot;What can we expect of students if a person in that position and of that stature (Brewster) engages in such acts?&quot; Henry Kissinger, sitting just a few chairs away, mused aloud that Brewster was the one man whose assassination would benefit the United States. It was Brewster&#x27;s handling of the May Day demonstrations and his actions after the crisis that made him a target of the Nixon White House.

====Vietnam War====
He is also well known for his handling of the student protests on the Yale campus during the Vietnam War era, a war that Brewster openly criticized and opposed. He never allowed such convictions to disrupt the University&#x27;s operations, especially classes.

On May 12, 1972, Brewster made a public statement, printed in full on the front page of the &quot;Yale Daily News&quot;, prior to a campus visit by Richard Nixon&#x27;s Secretary of State William P. Rogers. Brewster, on the one hand, threatened to expel students who might bar Rogers from speaking. Still, he also said that he &quot;expects&quot; disciplined picketing and asked that students appropriately protest Rogers&#x27;s appearance. In the end, Rogers canceled his appearance citing &quot;pressing engagements&quot;.

====Admissions====
As Yale&#x27;s president, he appointed R. Inslee Clark Jr. (&quot;Inky&quot;) as Director of Undergraduate Admissions. Under his tenure, he established academic credentials in the admissions process and the proportion of undergraduate African-Americans, Jews, and public high school graduates at Yale rose. Despite the alumni outrage over these policy changes, Clark held the position from 1965 to 1970.

No aspect of Brewster&#x27;s presidency stirred more anger and debate than the overhaul of Yale&#x27;s single-gender undergraduate admissions policy in the 1960s. He also had made it clear from the beginning of his presidency that he was not going to preside over a finishing school on Long Island Sound. Admissions became the battleground over the university&#x27;s true purpose.

==Diplomacy==
While serving as Yale&#x27;s president, he was nominated by President Jimmy Carter on April 7, 1977, to serve as U.S. Ambassador to the Court of St James&#x27;s. He was confirmed by the United States Senate on April 29, 1977, and he served from 1977 to 1981.
 Secretary of State Cyrus Vance, a member of the Yale Corporation, and a close personal friend, recommended him to President Carter for the position. Despite his lack of diplomatic experience, the British press was pleased with the appointment, calling Brewster potentially the best ambassador since David K. E. Bruce. They described Brewster as a &quot;New England Patrician&quot; and expressed delight at his gold ring with his family motto in Norman French. &quot;My role,&quot; he said at the time, &quot;is trying to advise my Government on British attitudes and concerns in the fullest way possible.&quot;

He was called to step in and resolve difficulties between United Nations Ambassador Andrew Young and the British Foreign Office. This was followed by smoothing out American/British difficulties over policy toward Rhodesia (Zimbabwe), which helped lead to the end of minority white rule in that country. Brewster reveled in the &quot;good life&quot; of London and took advantage of the range of social occasions from dinner with Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom to quaffing a pint of ale in a working class pub, saying, &quot;Becoming aware of the richness and variety here is a lot of fun.&quot;

===Later career===
After stepping down as ambassador in 1981, Brewster was associated with the New York-based law firm of Winthrop, Stimson, Putnam &amp; Roberts. In 1984, he became its resident partner in London. In 1986, Brewster served as a Special Master in the free agency case of NBA forward Albert King of the New Jersey Nets, ultimately ruling King could be a free agent.

====Master of University College, Oxford====
In 1986, Brewster was appointed Master of University College, Oxford, serving from 1986 until his death in Oxford in 1988. During this period, he was also the chairman of the Board of the United World Colleges.

==Death==
He died on November 8, 1988, at John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford, England. Brewster was buried in the Grove Street Cemetery in New Haven, Connecticut.

==In popular culture==
He is thought to be the inspiration for Garry Trudeau&#x27;s fictional character, President King, in the popular comic strip &quot;Doonesbury&quot;.

==Honors==
Brewster was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1956. He received several honorary Doctor of Laws degrees. They were awarded by Princeton University in 1964, the University of Pennsylvania in 1965, Boston College in 1968, Michigan State University in 1969, and Yale University in 1977. He was elected to the American Philosophical Society in 1978.

Brewster received honorary degrees from 11 British universities while he was ambassador. He received an honorary doctorate from University of Cambridge in 1978 and became the second American master of University College, Oxford in 1985.

==Works==
He is the author of &quot;Anti-trust and American Business Abroad&quot; (1969) and coauthor of &quot;Law of International Transactions and Relations&quot; (1960).

<doc id="357074" wikidata="Q654515" url="?curid=357074" title="Lake Mead">
<text>Lake Mead is a reservoir formed by the Hoover Dam on the Colorado River in the Southwestern United States. It is located in the states of Nevada and Arizona, east of Las Vegas. It is the largest reservoir in the US in terms of water capacity. Lake Mead provides water to the states of Arizona, California, and Nevada as well as some of Mexico, providing sustenance to nearly 20 million people and large areas of farmland.

At maximum capacity, Lake Mead is long, at its greatest depth, has a surface elevation of above sea level, has a surface area of , and contains of water.

The lake has remained below full capacity since 1983 owing to drought and increased water demand. As of May 31, 2022, Lake Mead held of full capacity at , having dropped in June 2021 below the reservoir&#x27;s previous all-time low of recorded in July 2016, and never returning to that level. By December 2024, following the implementation of water conservation measures, Lake Mead&#x27;s water levels had risen by 16 feet again over two years.

== History ==
In the area that was chosen to become Lake Mead, native Americans referred to as Ancestral Puebloans settled in the area. Many archaeological sites were submerged by the creation of Lake Mead, including the most representative, which is referred to as the &quot;Lost City&quot;. The lake was named after Elwood Mead, who was the commissioner of the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation from 1924 to 1936, during the planning and construction of the Boulder Canyon Project that created the dam and lake. Lloyd Joseph Hudlow, an engineer with the Bureau of Reclamation, came to Boulder City in March 1933 to assist in the survey, and ended up as the project manager.

Lake Mead was established as the Boulder Dam Recreation Area in 1936, administered by the National Park Service. The name was changed to the Lake Mead National Recreation Area in 1947, and Lake Mohave and the Shivwits Plateau were later added to its jurisdiction. Both lakes and the surrounding area offer year-round recreation options.

The accumulated water from Hoover Dam forced the evacuation of several communities, most notably St. Thomas, Nevada, the last resident of which left the town in 1938. The ruins of St. Thomas are currently visible (as of May 23, 2022) via dirt road and hiking trail, due to Lake Mead&#x27;s low water level. Lake Mead also covered the sites of the Colorado River landings of Callville and Rioville, Nevada, and the river crossing of Bonelli&#x27;s Ferry, between Arizona and Nevada. Six years after the dam&#x27;s construction, the lake filled to an elevation of 1200 feet.

At lower water levels, a high-water mark is visible in photos that show the shoreline of Lake Mead. The high-water mark is white because of the deposition of minerals on previously submerged surfaces.

==Geography==


Nine main access points to the lake are available. On the west are three roads from the Las Vegas metropolitan area. Access from the north-west from Interstate 15 is through the Valley of Fire State Park and the Moapa River Indian Reservation to the Overton Arm of the lake.

The lake is divided into several bodies. The large body closest to the Hoover Dam is Boulder Basin. The narrow channel, which was once known as Boulder Canyon and is now known as The Narrows, connects Boulder Basin to Virgin Basin to the east. The Virgin River and Muddy River empty into the Overton Arm, which is connected to the northern part of the Virgin Basin. The next basin to the east is Temple Basin, and following that is Gregg Basin, which is connected to the Temple Basin by the Virgin Canyon.

When the lake levels are high enough, a section of the lake farther upstream from the Gregg Basin is flooded, which includes Grand Wash Bay, the Pearce Ferry Bay and launch ramp, and about of the Colorado River within the lower Grand Canyon, extending to the foot of 240 Mile Rapids (north of Peach Springs, Arizona). In addition, two small basins, the Muddy River Inlet and the Virgin River Basin, are flooded when the lake is high enough where these two rivers flow into the lake. As of February 2015, these basins remain dry.

Jagged mountain ranges surround the lake, offering a scenic backdrop, especially at sunset. Two mountain ranges are within view of the Boulder Basin, the River Mountains, oriented northwest to southeast and the Muddy Mountains, oriented west to northeast. Bonelli Peak lies to the east of the Virgin Basin.

Las Vegas Bay is the terminus for the Las Vegas Wash which is the sole outflow from the Las Vegas Valley.

== Drought and water usage issues ==

Lake Mead receives the majority of its water from snow melt in the Colorado, Wyoming, and Utah Rocky Mountains. Inflows to the lake are largely moderated by the upstream Glen Canyon Dam, which is required to release around of water each year to Lake Mead under the Colorado River Compact. Releases from Hoover Dam have been over of water each year, which has led to declining levels in Lake Mead since 2000.

Outflow, which includes evaporation and delivery to Arizona, California, Nevada, and Mexico from Lake Mead is generally in the range of , resulting in a net annual deficit of about . Farmers in California&#x27;s Imperial Valley hold some of the oldest water rights and receive the largest share of water as of 2024.

Before the filling of Lake Powell (a reservoir of similar size to Lake Mead) behind Glen Canyon Dam, the Colorado River flowed largely unregulated into Lake Mead, making Mead more vulnerable to drought. From 1953 to 1956, the water level fell from . During the filling of Lake Powell from 1963 to 1965, the water level fell from . Many wet years from the 1970s to the 1990s filled both lakes to capacity, reaching a record high of in the summer of 1983.

In these decades prior to 2000, Glen Canyon Dam frequently released more than the required to Lake Mead each year. That allowed Lake Mead to maintain a high water level despite releasing significantly more water than it is contracted for. Since 2000, the Colorado River has experienced the southwestern North American megadrought, with average or above-average conditions occurring in only five years (2005, 2008–2009, 2011 and 2014) in the first 16 years of the 21st century. Of any 16-year period in the last 60 years, 2000-2015 had the lowest water availability.

In June 2010, the lake was at 39% of its capacity,&lt;ref name=&quot;Lake Levels/River Flow&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and on November 30, 2010, it reached , setting a new record monthly low. From mid-May 2011 to January 22, 2012, Lake Mead&#x27;s water elevation increased from after a heavy snowmelt in the Rocky Mountains prompted the release of an extra from Glen Canyon into Lake Mead.

In 2012 and 2013, the Colorado River basin experienced its worst consecutive water years on record, prompting a low Glen Canyon release in 2014 – the lowest since 1963, during the initial filling of Lake Powell – in the interest of recovering the level of the upstream reservoir, which had fallen to less than 40% capacity as a result of the drought. Consequently, Lake Mead&#x27;s level fell significantly, reaching a new record low in 2014, 2015 and 2016.

In 2014, its record low was on July 10, 2014. On June 26, 2015, Lake Mead reached another new record low when it fell to for the first time since the lake was filled, which risked triggering drought restrictions. If the lake is below the elevation of 1,075 feet at the beginning of the water year, an official shortage declaration by the Bureau of Reclamation will enforce water rationing in Arizona and Nevada. The water year begins October 1 to coincide with seasonal Rocky Mountain snowfall, which produces most of the Colorado River&#x27;s flow.

Lake Mead&#x27;s water level rebounded a few feet by October 2015 and avoided triggering the drought restrictions. The water level started falling in Spring 2016 and fell below the drought trigger level of 1,075 feet again in May 2016. It fell to a new record low of on July 1, 2016, before beginning to rebound slowly. Drought restrictions were narrowly avoided again when the lake level rose above 1,075 feet on September 28, 2016, three days before the deadline, and the Bureau of Land Reclamation did not issue a shortage declaration.

A reprieve from the steady annual decline occurred in 2017, when lake levels rose throughout the year due to heavier than normal snowfall in the Rocky Mountains. As a result of the large snowmelt, the lake regained the water levels it had in 2015 with a seasonal high of . The seasonal low of in 2017 was close to that experienced in 2014, safely above the drought trigger. That level was still below the seasonal low experienced in 2012, and the lake was projected to begin falling again in 2018.

Despite those and other predictions of an impending shortage determination by 2020, snowpack of 140% of average in the Upper Colorado River basin as of April 2019 resulted in 128% above average inflow into Lake Powell, resulting in water level on Lake Mead. In December 2019, Lake Mead water level reached , about above projections. As of April, 2020, the water level stood at , again benefiting from above average mountain snowpack (107% of average).

From 2018 to early-2021, Lake Mead water levels remained well above the level that would trigger a shortage determination. However, by mid-2021 its level fell below the trigger elevation and was projected to keep falling through 2022, which led the Bureau of Reclamation to declare a water shortage in August 2021. On July 28, 2022, the level was , the lowest level since 1937 when the reservoir was initially filled. The lake has rebounded somewhat from its low point in 2022, but its level still remains below the drought threshold as of June 2024.

As a result of the decreasing water level, marinas and boat launch ramps have either had to be relocated to another area of the lake or have closed down permanently. The Las Vegas Bay Marina was relocated in 2002 and the Lake Mead Marina was relocated in 2008 to Hemenway Harbor. Overton Marina and Echo Bay Marina have been closed due to low levels in the northern part of the Overton Arm. Government Wash, Las Vegas Bay, and Pearce Ferry boat launch ramps have been closed. Las Vegas Boat Harbor and Lake Mead Marina in Hemenway Harbor/Horsepower Cove remain open, along with Callville Bay Marina, Temple Bar Marina, Boulder Launch Area (former location of the Lake Mead Marina) and the South Cove launch ramp.

Changing rainfall patterns, climate variability, high levels of evaporation, reduced snow melt runoff, and current water use patterns are putting pressure on water management resources at Lake Mead as the population relying on it for water, and the Hoover Dam for electricity, continues to increase. To lower the minimum lake level necessary to generate electricity from to , Hoover Dam was retrofitted with wide-head turbines, designed to work efficiently with less flow in 2015 and 2016.

If water levels continue to drop, Hoover Dam would cease generating electricity when the water level falls below and the lake would stabilize at a level of when the water reaches the lowest water outlet of the dam. In order to ensure that the city of Las Vegas will continue to be able to draw its drinking water from Lake Mead, nearly $1.5 billion was spent on building a new water intake tunnel in the middle of the lake at the elevation of . The tunnel took seven years to build under the lake and was put into operation in late 2015.

According to a 2016 estimate, about 6% of Lake Mead&#x27;s water evaporates annually. Covering 6 percent of Lake Mead with floating photovoltaics has a potential generating capacity of 3,400 megawatts, which is comparable to the capacity of Hoover Dam, and would reduce water lost to evaporation in the covered area by as much as 90%. A 2021 estimate stated that covering 10% of the lake&#x27;s surface with foam-backed floating photovoltaics could result in &quot;enough water conserved and electricity generated to service Las Vegas and Reno combined.&quot;

In December 2021, with Lake Mead at 35% of capacity, Arizona, California, Nevada, and the U.S. Department of the Interior signed an agreement to spend $200 million for 2022 and 2023 to subsidize water users who voluntarily reduce their usage or undertake capital projects to improve efficiency. Along with a variety of state and local regulations, this &quot;500+ Plan&quot; aimed to retain an additional in the reservoir. At the same time an agreement was reached with the Gila River Indian Community and the Colorado River Indian Tribes which was expected to save an estimated 11 vertical feet of reservoir water. In 2023 and 2024, several agreements between the United States Bureau of Reclamation, six water agencies from Southern California and the Fort Yuma Quechan Indian Tribe formalized a commitment to reduce water use by 1.6 million acre-feet by the end of 2026. In December 2024, the Colorado River Board of California announced that 75% of this commitment had been achieved already, with California&#x27;s water uses having reached &quot;their lowest levels since the 1940s&quot;, and that Lake Mead&#x27;s water levels had risen by 16 feet within two years.

In February 2025, climatologists confirmed that although Lakes Mead and Powell are in better shape than they had been in recent years, they are still only about 35% full–a crisis situation.

== Anthropological role in forensics ==
Severe drought lowers the level of the lake, affording social anthropologists opportunities to study indigenous dwellings that were previously submerged. Meanwhile, their forensic colleagues are routinely called in whenever relatively contemporary remains of people are revealed, to investigate scientifically who the deceased might have been in life, how they died, and how their bodies got to the lake. For example, the 2020–2023 North American drought caused a series of unexplained human remains to be revealed, prompting speculation about how many more will be discovered as the water level recedes. However, this is not the first time such mysteries have surfaced at Lake Mead:

* On or about June 16, 2011 a male body was discovered floating in Lake Mead near Callville Bay.
* On May 1, 2022, a body was found in a barrel which may have been stuck in mud since the late 1970s or early 1980s. Identification efforts have not been successful.
* On May 7, 2022, the remains of Thomas Erndt were found. Thomas died of an apparent drowning in 2002, but his body was never found.
* By August 15, 2022, four more bodies had been found.

== Recreation and marinas ==
Lake Mead provides many types of recreation to locals and visitors, including boating, fishing, swimming, sunbathing, and water skiing. Four marinas are located on Lake Mead: Las Vegas Boat Harbor and Lake Mead Marina (in Hemenway Harbor, NV) operated by the Gripentogs, and Callville Bay (in Callville Bay, NV) and Temple Bar (in Arizona.) The area has many coves with rocky cliffs and sandy beaches.

Several small to medium-sized islands occur in the lake area depending on the water level, the largest of which is Oberlink Island. The Alan Bible Visitor Center hosts the Alan Bible Botanical Garden, a small garden of cactus and other plants native to the Mojave Desert. The Grand Wash is a recreational area located in the north side of the lake.

On October 28, 1971, Lake Mead hosted the 1st ever B.A.S.S Bassmaster Classic. This fishing site was a &quot;mystery lake&quot; and the 24 anglers were not told of the location of the tournament until their plane was in the air. The &quot;winner take all&quot; payout of $10,000 was won by Bobby Murray of Arkansas.

The &quot;Desert Princess&quot;, operated by Lake Mead Cruises, is a three-level paddle wheeler certified by the U.S. Coast Guard to carry 275 passengers. It cruises to the Hoover Dam five days a week.

==B-29 crash==

At the bottom of the lake is a Boeing B-29 Superfortress that crashed in 1948 while testing a prototype missile guidance system known as &quot;suntracker&quot;.

The wreckages of at least two smaller airplanes are submerged in Lake Mead.

== Lake Mead and the Hoover Dam in popular culture ==
The 2018 novel &quot;Lords of St. Thomas&quot;, by Jackson Ellis, tells the story of the last family to vacate the flooded town of St. Thomas in 1938, following construction of the Hoover Dam and creation of Lake Mead.

Lake Mead, Hoover Dam, and the wrecked B-29 play a large role in the setting of the video game &quot;&quot;.

<text>Hermann Buhl (21 September 1924 – 27 June 1957) was an Austrian mountaineer. His accomplishments include the first ascents of Nanga Parbat in 1953 and Broad Peak in 1957. Buhl is the father of Austrian-German writer, publisher, and freelance journalist, Kriemhild &quot;Krimi&quot; Buhl.

==Early life==

Buhl was born in Innsbruck, Austria, the youngest of four children. After the death of his mother, he spent years in an orphanage.
Before , Hermann Buhl was a Cub Scout in Innsbruck. During the 1930s, as a teenager, he began to climb the Austrian Alps. In 1939, he joined the Innsbruck chapter of the Deutscher Alpenverein (the German Alpine association) and soon mastered climbs up to category 6. He was a member of the Mountain rescue team in Innsbruck (&quot;Bergrettung Innsbruck&quot;).

World War II interrupted his commercial studies, and he joined the Alpine troops, as a mountain infantryman, in 1943. Buhl participated in the Monte Cassino, in Italy. After being taken prisoner by American troops, he returned to Innsbruck and earned his living doing odd jobs. At the end of the 1940s, he finally completed his training as a mountain guide.

== Personal and family life == 

Hermann Buhl married Eugenie Högerle in March of 1951, and together they had three daughters. One of their daughters, Kriemhild Buhl, has shared personal insights about the Buhl family. 

In 1957, Hermann Buhl was photographed sharing a moment with his wife and daughter, bidding farewell before embarking on another expedition. Less is known about Buhl&#x27;s other daughters. 

In her book &quot;Papa Lalalaya&quot;, Kriemhild Buhl offers a personal account of her father&#x27;s duality as an extreme mountaineer and a devoted family man. She recounts how, despite the inherent risks of his climbing pursuits, Buhl remained deeply connected to his family, often being around his young daughters and valuing the moments spent with them. 

Buhl&#x27;s commitment to his family was evident even in his professional life. To support them financially, he worked as a salesman and advisor for mountaineering equipment at Sporthaus Schuster, a sportswear store in Munich.

== Himalayas ==
=== Nanga Parbat ===

Before his successful 1953 Nanga Parbat expedition, 31 people had died trying to make the first ascent.

Buhl is the only mountaineer to have made the first ascent of an eight-thousander solo, this was on his first ever visit to the Greater Ranges. His climbing partner, Otto Kempter, was too slow in joining the ascent, so Buhl struck off alone. He returned 41 hours later, having barely survived the arduous climb to the summit, 6.5 km (4 miles) distant from, and 1.2 km (4,000 feet) higher than, camp V. 

Experienced climbers, upon hearing later of Buhl&#x27;s near-death climb, faulted him for making the attempt solo. Regardless, his monumental efforts, along with spending the night standing on a tiny pedestal too small to squat upon, untethered, on the edge of a 60-degree ice slope, have become mountaineering legend, described by Bonington as &quot;a magnificent achievement&quot;.

=== Broad Peak ===
Fritz Wintersteller and Kurt Diemberger reached the forepeak (8030 m) on May 29 1957, during the course of the Austrian expedition led by Marcus Schmuck. However, it was a few days later, between June 8 and 9, that Wintersteller, Schmuck, Diemberger, and Buhl reached the true summit of Broad Peak (8051m), and achieved the first successful ascent of the mountain. Buhl was approaching the summit in the twilight, at around 6:30pm. The ascent was accomplished without the aid of supplemental oxygen, high-altitude porters or base camp support. 

=== Chogolisa ===
Just a few weeks after the successful first ascent of Broad Peak, Buhl and Diemberger made an attempt on nearby, unclimbed Chogolisa (7665 m) in Alpine style. Buhl lost his way in an unexpected snow storm and walked over a huge cornice on the East Ridge, near the summit of Chogolisa II (7654 m; also known as Bride Peak), subsequently triggering an avalanche that hurled him down 900 m over Chogolisa&#x27;s Northeast Face. His body could not be recovered and remains in the ice.

==Legacy==
His ascents on rock and snow, solo and as a rope leader, his attitude towards the mountain and his physical elegance have been assessed by such contemporary luminaries as Kurt Diemberger, Marcus Schmuck, Heinrich Harrer, Walter Bonatti and Gaston Rébuffat. He was also an idol and hero of climbers of younger generations, such as Reinhold Messner, Peter Habeler and Hansjörg Auer.

His expedition to Nanga Parbat was dramatized by Donald Shebib in the 1986 film &quot;The Climb&quot;, based in part on Buhl&#x27;s own writings about the expedition and starring Bruce Greenwood as Buhl.

<text>Famous People Players is a black light puppetry theatre company. It is based in Toronto, Ontario, Canada and tours worldwide. It is a non-profit organization that employs people with physical and intellectual disabilities. Those individuals share duties in dining room management, arts administration, and theatrical and visual arts performances.

Since inception, the company has paid homage to the works of famous people within its own theatrical context, hence the name &quot;Famous People&quot; Players.

==History==
The Famous People Players was founded on June 1, 1974, by Diane Dupuy of Hamilton, Ontario. At inception, the company consisted of Dupuy and an assistant, eleven performers, and Dupuy&#x27;s mother Mary Thornton; Thornton designed and built the costumes and props.

The company&#x27;s original piece was &quot;Aruba Liberace&quot;, in which a life-size character of Liberace plays the piano. It is still the company&#x27;s signature performance. Liberace attended a showing of &quot;Aruba Liberace&quot;, and was so impressed he invited Famous People Players to perform with him in Las Vegas. The company debuted in Las Vegas in October 1975; over the subsequent ten years, the company performed with Liberace both in Las Vegas and internationally.

As a result of the increasing popularity of Famous People Players, the company was featured as regulars on CBC Television&#x27;s 1976–1977 variety series, &quot;The Wolfman Jack Show&quot;; the network also later produced and aired &quot;Carnival of the Animals&quot;. In 1980, &quot;Sorcerer Apprentice&quot; premiered at Radio City Music Hall in New York. In 1982, Famous People Players was invited to perform in the People&#x27;s Republic of China. The company&#x27;s first Broadway Show, &quot;A Little Like Magic&quot;, opened at the Lyceum Theatre in New York City and ran for 49 performances in 1985. They returned to New York in 1994 for a 4-week run, under the sponsorship of Phil Collins and actor Paul Newman, where they performed the show &quot;A Little More Magic&quot; for inner city kids to dream BIG!

==Dine and Dream Theatre==
In 1994, the company opened the Dine and Dream Theatre; Paul Newman funded the restaurant&#x27;s development from some of the proceeds of Newman&#x27;s Own products and Phil Collins funded the theatre&#x27;s sound system. In 2009, facing the demolition of its 25-year location, the company moved further west to a new location. Despite damage caused by storms and unexpected costs from the city of Toronto, the company survived and opened its first show in its new location on October 23, 2009.

The Dine and Dream Theatre is located at the company&#x27;s Toronto west-end headquarters. Guests first arrive to the restaurant for dinner, where they are served by individuals who also perform in Famous People Players productions. After dinner, they are led to the Phil Collins Theatre, where the main production is performed. The theatre is named after Phil Collins, who became a source of inspiration for the actors when he viewed a performance interpretation of his music. It is currently the only theatre in Canada exclusively devoted to puppetry performance.

==Recognition==
The troupe has been subject of numerous talk shows, specials and documentaries. A 1984 CBS movie-of-the-week entitled &quot;Special People&quot; was based on the company&#x27;s early history. &quot;A Little Like Magic&quot;, which detailed the company&#x27;s operation and success, was an Emmy Award-winning documentary. The company was also featured in the plot of an episode of the popular U.S. television drama &quot;7th Heaven&quot; in 2002.

In co-production with Treehouse&#x27;s &quot;Roll Play&quot; Famous PEOPLE Players program for the juice box set is hugely popular. The theatre troupe first broke into this market with their Toronto Dinner Theatre as a guest spot location for Treehouse kingpin &quot;This is Daniel Cook.&quot;

Founder Diane Dupuy has been inducted as a member of the Order of Canada in recognition for her contributions to Canadian society through the company and mother Mary C. Thornton has won many accolades, most recently with The Toastmasters as woman of the year.

==Productions==
Famous People Players has created many productions over its 45-year history. (&quot;Note: The table below is currently incomplete.&quot;)

&quot;Leave the Porch Light On&quot; was the company&#x27;s first original, full-length musical production and was created for the company&#x27;s 25th-anniversary. The initial performance of &quot;Leave the Porchlight On&quot; was attended by a number of celebrities and other well-known people, including the Governor General of Canada. The production was very successful and is still occasionally performed at the company&#x27;s theatre in Toronto and on tour. A sequel of sorts followed two years later, entitled &quot;Hide and Seek: A Game of Human Spirit&quot;.

<doc id="357077" wikidata="Q256079" url="?curid=357077" title="Antonio Rossellino">
<text>Antonio Gamberelli (1427–1479), nicknamed Antonio Rossellino for the colour of his hair, was an Italian Renaissance sculptor. His older brother, from whom he received his formal training, was the sculptor and architect Bernardo Rossellino.

Born in Settignano, now a part of Florence, he was the youngest of five brothers, sculptors and stonecutters. He is said to have studied under Donatello and is remarkable for the sharpness and fineness of his bas-relief. His most important works are the funeral monument of (1458) for the Blackfriar Church (today a museum), Forlì, and the monument of Infante James of Coimbra, cardinal of Portugal in the Basilica di San Miniato al Monte, Florence (1461–1467).

The portrait bust of Matteo Palmieri in the Bargello is signed and dated 1468. In 1470 he made the monument for Maria d&#x27;Aragona Duchess of Amalfi, in the Piccolomini chapel in Sant&#x27;Anna dei Lombardi in Naples; the relief of the Nativity over the altar in the same place is also probably his. A statue of John the Baptist as a boy is in the Bargello; also a delicate relief of the Madonna and Child, an &quot;Ecce Homo&quot;, and a bust of Francesco Sassetti. The so-called &quot;Madonna del Latte&quot; on a pillar in the Church of Santa Croce is a memorial to Francesco Nori, who fell by the stab intended for Lorenzo de&#x27; Medici. Other reliefs of the Madonna and Child are in the Via della Spada, Florence, and in the Victoria and Albert Museum, London. In the latter place is the bust of Giovanni di San Miniato, a doctor of arts and medicine, signed and dated 1456. Working in conjunction with Mino da Fiesole, Rossellino executed the reliefs of the &quot;Assumption of Mary&quot; and the &quot;Martyrdom of St. Stephen&quot; for the pulpit at Prato. A marble bust of the boy Baptist in the Pinacoteca, Faenza, and a Christ Child in the Louvre are attributed to Rossellino by some authorities.

Giorgio Vasari includes a biography of Rossellino in his &quot;Lives&quot;.

<doc id="357078" wikidata="Q667507" url="?curid=357078" title="Lake Powell">
<text>Lake Powell is a reservoir on the Colorado River in Utah and Arizona, United States. It is a major vacation destination visited by approximately two million people every year. It holds of water when full, second in the United States to only Lake Mead - though Lake Mead has fallen below Lake Powell in size several times during the 21st century in terms of volume of water, depth and surface area.

Lake Powell was created by the flooding of Glen Canyon by the Glen Canyon Dam, which also led to the 1972 creation of Glen Canyon National Recreation Area, a popular summer destination of public land managed by the National Park Service. The reservoir is named for John Wesley Powell, a civil war veteran who explored the river via three wooden boats in 1869. It lies primarily in southern Utah, with a small portion in northern Arizona.

Lake Powell is a water storage facility for the Upper Basin states of the Colorado River Compact (Colorado, Utah, Wyoming and New Mexico). The Compact specifies that the Upper Basin states are to provide a minimum annual flow of to the Lower Basin states (Arizona, Nevada, and California).

According to US Geological Survey and the Bureau of Reclamation report, in addition to water loss, Lake Powell faced an average annual loss in storage capacity of about 33,270 acre-feet, or 11 billion gallons, per year between 1963 and 2018 because of sediments flowing in from the Colorado and San Juan rivers. Those settle at the bottom of the reservoir and decrease the total amount of water the reservoir can hold. Environmentalists have pushed to drain Lake Powell and restore Glen Canyon to its natural, free-flowing state.

==History==

===Planning===
In the 1940s and early 1950s, the United States Bureau of Reclamation planned to construct a series of Colorado River dams in the rugged Colorado Plateau province of Colorado, Utah, and Arizona. Glen Canyon Dam was born of a controversial damsite the Bureau selected in Echo Park, in what is now Dinosaur National Monument in Colorado. A small but politically effective group of objectors, led by David Brower of the Sierra Club, succeeded in defeating the Bureau&#x27;s bid, citing Echo Park&#x27;s natural and scenic qualities as too valuable to submerge.

Glen Canyon Dam was built to solve the downstream delivery obligations of the Upper Basin states. Lake Powell is an &quot;aquatic bank&quot; built to fulfill the terms of the &quot;Compact Calls&quot; of Lower Basin.

===Construction===

Construction on Glen Canyon Dam began with a demolition blast keyed by the push of a button by President Dwight D. Eisenhower at his desk in the Oval Office on October 1, 1956, which started clearing tunnels for water diversion. On February 11, 1959, water flowed through the tunnels so dam construction could begin. Later that year, the bridge was completed, allowing trucks to deliver equipment and materials for the dam and also for the new town of Page, Arizona.

Concrete placement started around the clock on June 17, 1960. The last bucket of over 5 million cubic yards (4,000,000 m3) was poured on September 13, 1963. The dam is 710 feet (216 m) high and the surface elevation of the water at full-pool is approximately 3700 feet (1100 m). Construction cost $155 million, and 18 lives were lost. On September 22, 1966, Glen Canyon Dam was dedicated by Lady Bird Johnson. From 1970 to 1980, turbines and generators were installed for hydroelectricity.

===Filling and operations===
Upon completion of Glen Canyon Dam on September 13, 1963, the Colorado River began to back up, no longer being diverted through the tunnels. The newly flooded Glen Canyon formed Lake Powell. Sixteen years elapsed before the lake filled to the level on June 22, 1980. The lake level fluctuates considerably depending on the seasonal snow runoff from the Rocky Mountains. The all-time highest water level was reached on July 14, 1983, during one of the heaviest Colorado River floods in recorded history, in part influenced by a strong El Niño event. The lake rose to above sea level, with a water content of . It lies primarily in parts of Garfield, Kane, and San Juan counties in southern Utah, with a small portion in Coconino County in northern Arizona. The northern limits of the lake extend at least as far as the Hite Crossing Bridge.

===21st century drought and push to drain===
Colorado River flows have been below average since 2000 as a result of the southwestern North American megadrought, leading to lower lake levels. In winter 2005 (before the spring run-off) the lake reached its then-lowest level since filling, an elevation of above sea level, which was approximately below full pool. After 2005, the lake level slowly rebounded, although it has not filled completely since then. Summer 2011 saw the third largest June and the second largest July runoff since the closure of Glen Canyon Dam, and the water level peaked at nearly , 77 percent of capacity, on July 30. However, water years 2012 and 2013 were, respectively, the third and fourth-lowest runoff years recorded on the Colorado River. By April 9, 2014, the lake level had fallen to , largely erasing the gains made in 2011.

Colorado River levels returned to normal during water years 2014 and 2015 (pushing the lake to ) by the end of water year 2015. The Bureau of Reclamation in 2014 reduced the Lake Powell release from 8.23 to 7.48 million acre-feet, for the first time since the lake filled in 1980. This was done due to the &quot;equalization&quot; guideline which stipulates that an approximately equal amount of water must be retained in both Lake Powell and Lake Mead, in order to preserve hydro-power generation capacity at both lakes. This resulted in Lake Mead declining to the lowest level on record since the 1930s.

Long-term water level decline continued, forcing an emergency release of water from the Flaming Gorge Reservoir in July 2021. and by April 22, 2022, Lake Powell was at in elevation – just of capacity. This marks the lowest water level for Lake Powell since it was filled in 1963.

The capacity of Lake Powell has decreased by 7% since 1963 facing an average annual loss of 33,270 acre-feet of storage, due to the inflow of sediments from Colorado and San Juan rivers.

Peer-reviewed studies indicate that storing water in Lake Mead rather than in Lake Powell would yield a savings of 300,000 acre feet of water or more per year, leading to calls by environmentalists to drain Lake Powell and restore Glen Canyon to its natural, free-flowing state.

== Climate ==
These data are for the Wahweap climate station on Lake Powell just south of the Utah-Arizona border (Years 1961 to 2012).
==Geology==
Glen Canyon was carved by differential erosion from the Colorado River over an estimated 5 million years. The Colorado Plateau, through which the canyon cuts, arose some 11 million years ago. Within that plateau lie layers of rock from over 300 million years ago to the relatively recent volcanic activity. Pennsylvanian and Permian formations can be seen in Cataract Canyon and San Juan Canyon. The Moenkopi Formation, which dates from 230 million years ago (Triassic Period), and the Chinle Formation are found at Lees Ferry and the Rincon. Both formations are the result of the ancient inland sea that covered the area. Once the sea drained, windblown sand invaded the area, creating what is known as Wingate Sandstone.

The more recent (Jurassic Period) formations include Kayenta Sandstone, which produces the trademark blue-black &quot;desert varnish&quot; that streaks down many walls of the canyons. Above this is Navajo Sandstone. Many of the arches, including Rainbow Bridge, lie at this transition point. This period also includes light yellow Entrada Sandstone, and the dark brown, almost purple Carmel Formation. These latter two can be seen on the tops of mesas around Wahweap, and the crown of Castle Rock and Tower Butte. Above these layers lie the sandstone, conglomerate and shale of the Straight Cliffs Formation that underlies the Kaiparowits Plateau and San Rafael Swell to the north of the lake.

The confluences of the Escalante, Dirty Devil and San Juan rivers with the Colorado lie within Lake Powell. The slower flow of the San Juan river has produced goosenecks where of river are contained within on a straight line.

==Landmarks and features==
The lake&#x27;s main body stretches up Glen Canyon, but has also filled many (over 90) side canyons. The lake also stretches up the Escalante River and San Juan River where they merge into the main Colorado River. This provides access to many natural geographic points of interest as well as some remnants of the Anasazi culture.

==Development==

Access to the lake is limited to developed marinas because most of the lake is surrounded by steep sandstone walls:
* Lee&#x27;s Ferry
* Page and Wahweap Marina
* Antelope Point Marina
* Halls Crossing, Utah Marina
* Bullfrog Marina
* Hite Marina

The following marinas are accessible only by boat:
* Dangling Rope Marina
* Rainbow Bridge National Monument
* Escalante Subdistrict

Glen Canyon National Recreation Area draws more than two million visitors annually. Recreational activities include boating, fishing, waterskiing, jet-skiing, and hiking. Prepared campgrounds can be found at each marina, but many visitors choose to rent a houseboat or bring their own camping equipment, find a secluded spot somewhere in the canyons, and make their own camp (there are no restrictions on where visitors can stay).

The Castle Rock Cut is one of the most important navigational channels in the lake; it was blasted as early as the 1970s to allow boaters to bypass the winding canyons between the Glen Canyon Dam and reaches of Lake Powell further upstream – saving, on average, one hour of travel time. The cut has been deepened several times since then, to allow the use of the channel during droughts. During the protracted 21st-century drought, however, the lake has dropped so quickly on several occasions that the cut dried up during the summer tourist season, most recently in 2013. Continued deepening of the Castle Rock cut has been criticized for its high cost, but boaters and the National Park Service argue that it improves safety, saves millions of dollars in fuel, and improves emergency response time. In September 2021 the level of Lake Powell was 45 feet below the bottom of the Castle Rock cut.

Currently, most marinas on the lake don&#x27;t have Automatic Identification System monitoring stations that transmit boat positions to the AIS websites for the boating community. A substantial number of vessels on the lake do not have AIS transponders as there currently are no mandatory requirements for AIS usage for this body of water. Extra precautions must be taken with respect to boating safety, as the fractal nature of the lake&#x27;s hydrologic surface area can allow vessels with limited charting equipment to become easily lost.

The burying of human (and pet) waste in Glen Canyon National Recreation Area is prohibited. Anyone who camps farther than a quarter of a mile from a marina must bring a portable toilet. Pet waste must also be packed out.

The southwestern end of Lake Powell in Arizona can be accessed via U.S. Route 89 and State Route 98. State Route 95 and State Route 276 lead to the northeastern end of the lake in Utah.

==Fish species==
Some of these fish species are on the US Endangered Species List. Currently most native species on the Colorado River Basin are subject to ongoing restoration efforts of some kind.

* Smallmouth bass
* Largemouth bass
* Striped bass

Carp, pike and others
* Crappie
* Sunfish
* Channel catfish
* Northern pike
* Walleye
* Common carp
* Razorback sucker
* Brown trout
* Bonytail chub
* Gizzard shad

== Invasive species ==

Zebra and quagga mussels first appeared in the United States in the 1980s.

The mussels were initially brought to the United States through the ballast water of ships entering the Great Lakes. These aquatic invaders soon spread to many bodies of water in the Eastern United States and have even made their way to the western United States. In January 2008, Zebra mussels have been detected in several reservoirs along the Colorado River system such as Lakes Mead, Mojave, and Havasu.

By the early 2000s Arizona, California, Nebraska, Kansas, Colorado, Nevada and Utah have all confirmed the presence of larval zebra mussels in lakes and reservoirs.

Zebra and quagga mussels can be destructive to an ecosystem due to competition for resources with native species. The filtration of zooplankton by the mussels can negatively impact the feeding for some species of fish. Zebra and quagga mussels can attach to hard surfaces and build layers on underwater structures. The mussels are known to clog pipes including those in hydroelectric power systems, thus becoming a costly and time-consuming problem for water managers in the West.

Control policies have recently been introduced to alleviate the hydroelectric problems as well as ecological problems faced by Western infestation. Beginning in 1999 Lake Powell began to visually monitor for the mussels.

In 2001 hot water boat decontamination sites were established at Wahweap, Bullfrog, and Halls Crossing marinas. In January 2007, zebra mussels were detected in Lake Mead and new action plans were announced to prevent the spread of mussels to Lake Powell. In August 2007, preliminary testing was positive for zebra or quagga larvae in Lake Powell. These tests were deemed false positives, but adult quagga mussels were found in 2013.

In August 2010, Lake Powell was declared mussel free. Lake Powell introduced a mandatory boat inspection for each watercraft entering the reservoir beginning in June 2009. Effective June 29, 2009, every vessel entering Lake Powell must have a mussel certificate, although boat owners were allowed to self-certify. These measures were intended to help prevent vessels from transporting Zebra mussels into Lake Powell.

Despite these measures, quagga mussel DNA was detected in 2012 and live mussels were found at a number of sites including the Wahweap Marina in Spring and Summer 2013. In June 2013 the NPS was attempting a diver-based eradication program to find and remove mussels before the lake became infested.

==Pipeline proposal==

The Washington County Water Conservancy District has proposed building the Lake Powell Pipeline, which would have the capacity to extract up to per year from Lake Powell for distribution to municipal drinking water systems in the county.

<text>Bernardo di Matteo del Borra Gamberelli (1409–1464), better known as Bernardo Rossellino, was an Italian Renaissance sculptor and architect, the elder brother of the sculptor Antonio Rossellino. As a member of the second generation of Renaissance artists, he helped to further define and popularize the revolution in artistic approach that characterized the new age. His work is often hard to distinguish from that of his brothers (three in all) working in the family workshop.

==Biography==
Rossellino was born into a family of farmers and quarry owners in the mountain village of Settignano, Italy, overlooking the Arno Valley and the city of Florence. His uncle, Jacopo di Domenico di Luca del Borra Gamberelli may have given him his first lessons in stonemasonry. By 1420, Bernardo was certainly down in Florence and apprenticed to one of that city&#x27;s better-known sculptors, perhaps Nanni di Bartolo, called &quot;il Rosso (the redhead)&quot;. Such a relationship might explain the nickname of &quot;Rossellino (the little redhead) given to Bernardo and applied to his brothers, Antonio, Domenico, and Giovanni. Curiously, there is no record of Bernardo&#x27;s entry into Florence&#x27;s Guild of Stone and Woodworkers, although matriculation information exists for his brothers.

More than from any single master, Bernardo learned from the experimental atmosphere that suffused Florence in the 1420s. He seems to have been captivated by the &quot;new wave&quot; approaches being put into practice by Brunelleschi, Donatello, Ghiberti, and Masaccio. Perhaps more faithfully than their other followers, Bernardo Rossellino embraced and held true to the classical revival in both sculpture and architecture. Celebrated for his sculpture (the &quot;Leonardo Bruni Tomb&quot;, &quot;Empoli Annunciation&quot; group), he achieved particular distinction through his expanding role as an architect, achieving lasting fame for the work done or planned in Rome for Pope Nicholas V and, especially for the rebuilding of the town of Pienza for Pope Pius II. Part of his artistic importance also lay in his entrepreneurial skills which enabled him to assemble a large and highly successful workshop that dominated the stoneworking field in Florence during the 1450s and 1460s. 
===Arezzo, 1433=== 
In 1433, Bernardo is recorded as being in Arezzo, employed by the Fraternita di Santa Maria della Misericordia to complete the facade of the Misericordia&#x27;s headquarters. His first job presented a considerable challenge. The lower storey of this palace had been completed a half century earlier in the, then, popular Gothic style. Thus the problem confronting Bernardo was similar to that which Alberti encountered a quarter century later when asked to complete the facade of Santa Maria Novella. Bernardo&#x27;s solution for the unfinished second storey was a three bay design which used a typically Gothic mixed-element frame in the central bay flanked by classical paired pilasters and &quot;aediculae&quot;, the features of which were taken from the most progressive sources available. Set within the Gothic frame of this second storey is a relief of the Madonna of Mercy, the protectress of Arezzo, spreading her mantle out over the community&#x27;s citizenry. She is flanked by the kneeling saints Laurentius and Persentinus. Bernardo received his final payment for the project in June 1435, specifically for the two free standing figures of Saints Gregory and Donatus which occupy the aediculae on either side of the Misericordia relief. Rossellino&#x27;s solution for the Arezzo palace facade fused Gothic and Renaissance elements in a deft, if somewhat awkward, combination aimed at achieving the Renaissance goal of unified harmony. He also clearly displayed, in this initial effort at both sculpture and architecture, a genius for the sort of creative eclecticism that became a major feature of the &quot;Rossellino manner&quot;.

===Return to Florence, from 1436===
Bernardo Rossellino was back in Florence in 1436 to establish his own workshop and to join a crew of stonemasons already at work constructing the Aranci Cloister of the Badia. Payment records, supported by stylistic evidence, indicate that his principal contributions (1436–38) to this project included a handsome stone doorframe and an unusual cross window, both of which are identifiable today. It also is possible that he proposed the addition of the pilaster strips which divide the surfaces of the loggias of the two-storey courtyard into a systematic grid. Documents indicate that Bernardo assumed a more decisive role at the suburban monastery of Santa Maria alle Campora whose cloister (1436) challenges that of Michelozzo at San Marco as the first such structure to have been erected in accordance with a Renaissance aesthetic. In 1444, he received a commission to sculpt two altar figures for the oratory of the Annunciation in the church of St. Stephen in Empoli. In these two representations of the Virgin Annunciate and of the Archangel Gabriel, we find a further development of the artist&#x27;s decoratively graceful and classical style as well as a recognition of the sculptural styles of Donatello, Ghiberti, and Michelozzo.

Although the stock in trade of the Rossellino shop would have been the supply of building material and simple tasks of stonemasonry, several projects, combining sculptural and architectural features, were of particular significance during the 1440s. One, undertaken in the Palazzo Pubblico of Siena called upon him to design a grand entry way into the Sala del Concistoro. This richly decorated and gracefully classical doorframe is arguably the finest example of the type done in the first half of the fifteenth century and it is certainly one of the most sumptuously elegant of the entire Renaissance. 
Another project was the triumphal arch wall tomb erected in Florence&#x27;s church of Santa Croce for the historian and humanist scholar Leonardo Bruni (died 1444), who had served as the State Chancellor of Florence. No documentation survives for the tomb, but two early 16th-century sources credit Bernardo Rossellino for the project and his authorship generally has been accepted. There, however, has been debate concerning the dating of the tomb, with some supporting a date in the late 1440s and others, believing that Bernardo could not have conceived its classical character prior to his stay in Rome, preferring a date after 1455. There is, however, nothing in its design that would preclude the earlier dating. In fact the Bruni Tomb seems a logical continuation of the classicizing manner which Bernardo recently had displayed in his design for the Concistoro door frame in Siena. Accordingly, the Bruni Tomb might best be dated to the years 1446–48.

Bernardo Rossellino&#x27;s Bruni Tomb consisted of a shallow wall niche framed by pilasters and topped by a semi-circular arch. The effect suggests a triumphal arch leading to both the immortal fame desired by the humanist scholar and spiritual deliverance sought by the pious Christian. Bruni&#x27;s sarcophagus is placed within the niche and it, in turn, supports a brocade-draped bier upon which rests Bernardo&#x27;s portrait effigy of the statesman. A &quot;tondo&quot; containing the Madonna and Child flanked by half-length angels appears within the arch above the bier, while two large angelic putti, bearing Bruni&#x27;s coat-of-arms ascend the archivolt. Bernardo drew upon a variety of sources in arriving at his design for the tomb, including 14th-century wall tombs in Rome done by members of the so-called Cosmati school, as well as the recently executed Tomb of Baldassare Coscia (Antipope John XXIII) by Donatello and the Brancacci tomb by Michelozzo. What sets the Bruni tomb apart and established it as the &quot;standard&quot; upon which so many subsequent later Renaissance tombs were based (including that for Carlo Marsuppini executed a few years later for Santa Croce by Bernardo&#x27;s probable pupil, Desiderio da Settignano) was its sense of unity.

By any estimation, these two works (the Siena portal and the Bruni Tomb) stand out as highpoints in the evolution of the Renaissance style. Even before his trip to Rome in the 1450s and his contact with Alberti, Bernardo demonstrated a thorough appreciation for the nature of the antique revival that was so fundamental to the Renaissance movement. His understanding of the essential elements of antiquity is also apparent in the finest architectural achievement of Bernardo&#x27;s early years, the Spinelli Cloister at Santa Croce in Florence (1448–51). No documents exist to connect Bernardo with this project but the entry portal is clearly a simplified version of his Siena door frame and his authorship of the Spinelli Cloister may be accepted. The rhythmic beauty of the cloister, perhaps the loveliest of the early Renaissance, is due to a carefully formulated series of mathematical ratios and Euclidean relationships that echo those employed by Brunelleschi at the Hospital of the Innocents. The crisply executed architectural sculptures of the Spinelli Cloister (doorframes, capitals and corbels, entry portal) are stylistic signatures of the &quot;Rossellino manner&quot; and are unique to his workshop. Bernardo&#x27;s style is also to be found in the tabernacle he executed (1449–51) for the Florentine church of Santa Maria Nuova (since relocated to Sant&#x27;Egidio). In 1451, his shop received an important sculptural commission for a tomb for the Beata Villana in Santa Maria Novella (now dismembered and in fragmentary state). Its execution was left in the hands of Bernardo&#x27;s brother, Antonio and other members of the workshop (including Desiderio da Settignano) due to Bernardo&#x27;s departure for Rome.

During these same years, Bernardo was employed by the wealthy banker Giovanni Rucellai to remodel several old dwellings into a new family palace. This initial work for Rucellai involved internal systemization, the construction of a cross-vaulted passage leading from the street (the Via della Vigna nuova) to a new courtyard and loggia for which he also was responsible. Evidence of Bernardo&#x27;s presence may found in one of the corbels in this corridor which is identical to those used in the Spinelli Cloister and was a probable &quot;leftover&quot; from that project.

===Rome, 1451–55===
Bernardo&#x27;s career took an important turn when he traveled to Rome in 1451 to join the vast architectural team then engaged by Pope Nicholas V to revitalize the ancient city and its environs. Giorgio Vasari&#x27;s mid-sixteenth century biography of the artist greatly exaggerated Bernardo&#x27;s actual role in most of the projects. Although his retainer exceeded that of all other stonemasons in the papal employ, he is documented at only two projects: as furnishing hoists for the large round tower at the Vatican Palace and in doing restoration work at the early Christian church of San Stefano Rotondo (window and door frames, vaulting, stone paving). His primary task in Rome, apparently, was to draw up plans, likely under the supervision of Alberti, for rebuilding the Vatican and the Basilica of St. Peter&#x27;s, projects which, due to the death of the pope in 1455, were never carried out. In spite of this, Bernardo&#x27;s long sojourn in Rome had significant meaning for him, solidifying his commitment to reviving the spirit of antiquity in his works and exposing him to the concepts of Alberti.

During Bernardo&#x27;s long absence his workshop had been left in the talented hands of Antonio Rossellino, together with his other brothers, Domenico and Giovanni, all of whom concentrated upon the sculptural side of the stonemasonry business. Once back in Florence, Bernardo assumed his oversight of the workshop&#x27;s production but increasingly turned his attention to more lucrative architectural matters. Thus, those sculptural projects often associated with the Rossellino name such as the tombs for Giovanni Chelini in San Domenico, San Miniato al Tedesco, for the Beato Lorenzo da Ripafrata and for Filippo Lazzari, both in San Domenico, Pistoia, for Geminiano Inghirami in San Francesco, Prato, and for the Beato Marcolino, San Giacomo, Forlì, likely involved only his overall approval and not his chisel. This probably also was the case with the mortuary chapel and tomb monument for Cardinal James of Portugal constructed at the Florentine church of San Miniato al Monte which, in its multiplicity of artistic elements and multi-media impact, seems to predict the Baroque (i.e., Bernini&#x27;s Cornaro Chapel). His involvement with the Tomb of Orlando de&#x27; Medici in Santissima Annunziata was more personal but its conception is more architectural than sculptural.

Among those Florentine building projects with which Bernardo was involved in this last phase of his career was the amalgamation of several buildings into a palace for his former patron at the Santa Croce monastery, Tomasso Spinelli. The unifying facade of the Spinelli Palace utilized the cost-saving technique of faux stonework incised into plaster but the entry corridor is remarkable for its use of illusionary perspective.

Bernardo also returned to Giovanni Rucellai&#x27;s palace to apply a unifying front of stonework to its public face along the Via Vigna Nuova. It is this facade, divided into bays by three tiers of classically inspired pilasters rising above a base of mock stonework &quot;opus quadratum&quot; and topped by an abbreviated entablature, that sets this building apart from all other Florentine townhouses. While there is evidence pointing to Bernardo&#x27;s involvement in constructing the Rucellai facade, the name of Alberti has most usually been connected with its design. In any case, Bernardo Rossellino&#x27;s artistic prominence was recognized when he was appointed capomaestro (chief architect) of the Florence Cathedral in 1461 (by that time, largely an honorific title).

===Pienza, 1459–61===

Despite his previous accomplishments, the true measure of Bernardo Rossellino&#x27;s architectural place in history lies in the extraordinary project he undertook for Pope Pius II at Pienza between 1459 and 1464. There, in a sweeping transformation of a rural community, Bernardo erected an imposing family palace, a grand cathedral, town hall, bishop&#x27;s palace and canons&#x27; house, all set compactly about a trapezoidal square and bringing together the architectural tastes of Florence, Siena, and Rome. He also supervised the construction or renovation of palaces and townhouses for several cardinals and members of the papal court, and a quantity of houses for the citizens of this transformed community. For the Piccolomini Palace, a massive three-storey block set about a spacious courtyard, he designed three articulated facades resembling the front of the Rucellai palace (which the Piccolomini Palace may well predate) and opened up a garden front of three tiers of loggias from which a splendid panorama might be viewed.

At Pienza Cathedral he affixed a classicizing exterior to a Teutonic &quot;hall church&quot; within the cathedral, the elegant Altar of St. Andrew and the ornate baptismal font in the lower church serve as reminders of the continuing sculptural output Bernardo&#x27;s Florentine workshop. The real significance of Pienza, however, lies not in the merits of the individual units, but in Bernardo Rossellino&#x27;s ability to see the various projects as an urban totality. The trapezoidal, or Quattrocento form would later influence architect Michelangelo in his grand renovation of the piazza del campidoglio in Rome. The inspiration for Pienza may have come from the Albertian atmosphere of his earlier experience in Rome. While other architects of the Early Renaissance were forced to deal with townplanning on a theoretical basis, Bernardo was given the rare opportunity to actually put his ideas into practice. The result was one of the most pleasing and harmonious cityscapes in the history of urban design.

Final projects included designs for the Piccolomini-Todeschini Palace in Siena, a bell tower for the church of San Pietro in Perugia (modeled after that in Pienza), and possibly for the Piccolomini Palace built alongside the thermal pool at Bagno di Vignoni.

Bernardo died in Florence on 23 September 1464. His pupils/assistants included his younger brother Antonio, Desiderio da Settignano, Matteo Civitale, Buggiano, Mino da Fiesole. The workshop continued under the leadership of Antonio but accepted only commissions for sculpture.

<text>Andrea dal Monte Sansovino or Andrea Contucci del Monte San Savino (1529) was an Italian sculptor active during the High Renaissance. His pupils include Jacopo Sansovino (no relation).

==Biography==

He was the son of Domenico Contucci of Monte Sansovino, and was born at Monte San Savino near Arezzo, hence his name, which is usually softened to Sansovino.

He was a pupil of Antonio del Pollaiuolo, and at first worked in the style of 15th-century Florence. His early works are the terra cotta altarpiece in Santa Chiara at Monte San Savino, and the marble reliefs of the &quot;Annunciation&quot;, the &quot;Coronation of the Virgin&quot;, a &quot;Pietà&quot;, the &quot;Last Supper&quot;, and various statuettes in the Corbinelli chapel of Santo Spirito at Florence, all executed between the years 1488 and 1491.

From 1493 to 1500 Andrea worked in Portugal for the king, and some pieces of sculpture by him still exist in the monastic church of Coimbra. These early reliefs strongly show the influence of Donatello. His first known works after his return to Rome are a &quot;Madonna&quot; and a &quot;Baptist&quot; in Genoa Cathedral. The beginning of a more pagan style is shown in the &quot;St. John Baptizing Christ&quot; statues over the east door of the Battistero di San Giovanni in Florence (1505). This group was, however, finished by the weaker hand of Vincenzo Danti. In this period he executed the marble font at Volterra, with good reliefs of the &quot;Four Virtues&quot; and the &quot;Baptism of Christ&quot;.

In 1504 Sansovino was invited to Rome by Pope Julius II to make the monument of Cardinal Manzi in Santa Maria in Aracoeli (influenced by the Lombard style of Andrea Bregno) and those of Cardinals Ascanio Maria Sforza and Girolamo Basso della Rovere for the retro-choir of Santa Maria del Popolo. The architectural parts of these monuments and their sculptured foliage are extremely graceful and executed with the most minute delicacy, but the recumbent effigies show the beginning of a serious decline in taste. These tombs became models which for many years were copied by most later sculptors with increasing exaggerations of their defects.

In 1512, while still in Rome, Sansovino executed a very beautiful group of the &quot;Madonna and Child with St. Anne&quot;, now over one of the side altars in the church of Sant&#x27;Agostino. From 1513 to 1528 he was at Loreto, where he cased the outside of the Santa Casa in white marble, covered with reliefs and statuettes in niches between engaged columns; a small part of this sculpture was the work of Andrea, but the greater part was executed by Raffaello da Montelupo, Tribolo and others of his assistants and pupils. Though the general effect is rich and magnificent, the individual pieces of sculpture are both dull and feeble. The earlier reliefs, those by Sansovino himself, are the best.

<text>David Daggett (December 31, 1764 – April 12, 1851) was a U.S. senator, mayor of New Haven, Connecticut, Judge of the Connecticut Supreme Court of Errors, and a founder of the Yale Law School. He helped block plans for the first college for African Americans in the United States and presided over the conviction of a woman running a boarding school for African Americans in violation of Connecticut&#x27;s recently passed Black Law. He judged African Americans not to be citizens and supported their colonization to Africa.

==Life==
He was born in Attleboro, Massachusetts, December 31, 1764, the son of Thomas Daggett. The history of Daggett&#x27;s family in Massachusetts is a distinguished one. The original Daggett, John, came over from England with Winthrop&#x27;s company, in 1630, and settled in Watertown.

At the age of 16, David enrolled at Yale College, entering the junior class two years early. It appears likely that he entered Yale rather than Harvard, which was closer, because his father&#x27;s cousin had been an officer at Yale. He graduated with high honor in 1783 and then earned a master&#x27;s degree. Daggett was in the same class with Samuel Austin, Abiel Holmes and John Cotton Smith.

Upon receiving his master&#x27;s degree, he received the unusual honor of having his commencement speech published. This marked the beginning of his reputation as a formidable orator.

In 1786, at the age of 21, he married Ann Munson. They were married for 53 years, until she died in July 1839 at the age of 72. Daggett had 19 children, but only 14 lived any considerable time, and only three survived him. One son was clergyman Oliver Ellsworth Daggett. One daughter, Susan Edwards Daggett, married Chaplain of the Senate Reverend Sereno Edwards Dwight, son of the President of Yale, Timothy Dwight IV.

After leaving Yale, he studied law under Charles Chauncey of New Haven (who later became a judge of the Superior Court). He supported himself by working as a butler and as a preceptor at Hopkins Grammar School. In January 1786, at the age of 21, he was admitted to the bar of New Haven County and immediately set up his own practice, turning down an offer to be a tutor at Yale.

While in his 20s, Daggett published and sold the &quot;confession&quot; of Joseph Mountain, an African American executed publicly before a crowd estimated at 10,000 in New Haven for rape.

Dagget was elected a member of the American Antiquarian Society in 1815.

In November 1824, Daggett became an associate instructor of the New Haven Law School; and in 1826, he was appointed Kent Professor of Law at Yale. He held these positions until health conditions forced him to resign. In the autumn of 1826, he received from Yale the honorary degree of LL.D.

In May 1840, Daggett married Mary Lines, who was with him at the time of his death. He died in New Haven, Connecticut, and was interred at Grove Street Cemetery.

==Politics==
Daggett was admitted to the bar and entered into public life two years before the adoption of the Constitution of the United States. As did most of the people of New England, at that time, Dagget aligned himself with the Federalist Party.

In 1791, he was chosen to represent the town of New Haven in the General Assembly (Connecticut State House of Representatives), and was annually re-elected for six years, until 1797, when he was chosen a member of the Connecticut State Council, or Upper House. Though one of the youngest members of the House, he soon became one of the most influential, and in 1794, three years after he entered it, he was chosen to preside over it as Speaker, at the age of 29. Daggett returned to the House for a one-year term in 1805.

In 1797, Daggett was elected to the Connecticut State Council, and he retained his seat there for seven years, until he resigned it in 1804. He returned to the Council in 1809, retaining his seat until he was elected to the U.S. Senate in 1813.

As well as holding a seat on the Council, he was appointed State&#x27;s Attorney for the county of New Haven in June 1811, and continued in that office until he resigned it when chosen Senator in 1813.

He was elected to the Senate as a Federalist to fill the vacancy caused by the resignation of Chauncey Goodrich and served from May 13, 1813, to March 3, 1819. In 1825 and 1826, Daggett was an unsuccessful nominee for governor of Connecticut, losing in a landslide both times to incumbent Oliver Wolcott Jr.

In May 1826, at age 62, he was chosen an associate judge of the Connecticut Supreme Court of Errors. He was appointed to that office by a Legislature in which a decided majority was opposed to him in political principles and preferences, and yet the respect he had garnered as a public official and lawyer swayed their vote in his favor.

He served as the Mayor of New Haven, Connecticut, from 1828 to 1829.

In May 1832, he was made Chief Justice of the Connecticut Supreme Court of Errors. He continued in that office until December 31, 1834; 70 years was the limit that the state constitution assigned to the judicial office, and in May 1834, it was reported that the governor had notified the state senate that following Daggett&#x27;s approaching 70th birthday, he would no longer be legally eligible to serve on the court.

==Daggett and race issues==
In 1831, Simeon Jocelyn and others proposed establishing a college for negros in New Haven; there was none in the United States, and the admission of blacks into existing colleges was rare. Daggett led the opposition to this plan, which was scuttled at a town meeting when a resolution against it that Daggett helped draft was passed by a vote of a 700 to 4. At the same meeting an anti-abolitionism resolution he also helped draft was passed: &quot;The propagation of sentiments favorable to the immediate emancipation of slaves in disregard of the civil institutions of the States in which they belong, and as auxiliary thereto the contemporaneous founding of Colleges for educating colored people, is unwarrantable and dangerous interference with the internal concerns of other States, and ought to be discouraged.&quot;

After the &quot;Negro college&quot; affair, Daggett continued to oppose the expansion of education for blacks. In 1833, Prudence Crandall admitted a black student to her female academy. The citizens first warned her, then withdrew their daughters from the school. Crandall reopened the school exclusively for black women. Canterbury passed a bill stipulating that the selectmen of the town had to approve any out-of-state students of color seeking an education. Crandall was arrested for violating this law. Chief Justice Daggett ruled in 1833 that, since free black people could not be U.S. citizens, they could be prevented from being educated.

In 1835, Daggett undertook another town meeting linking states&#x27; rights, pro-colonization and anti-abolitionism. This meeting, held at the statehouse on September 9, 1835, found Noah Webster, Simeon Baldwin, and others helping to frame resolutions that condemned any interference by Congress with the treatment of slaves within any of the states, opposed the use of the mail for &quot;transmission of incendiary information&quot;, proposed African colonization for &quot;the free colored population&quot;, and &quot;viewed with alarm the efforts of the abolitionists&quot;.

Throughout the 1830s, Daggett consistently opposed education and supported colonization for free blacks. During this time, he served as chief justice of Connecticut&#x27;s Supreme Court and as Yale&#x27;s only full professor of law. In 1844, however, Daggett voted to restore the vote to blacks in a state referendum.

<doc id="357089" wikidata="Q2321540" url="?curid=357089" title="Mortal sin">
<text>A mortal sin (), in Christian theology, is a gravely sinful act which can lead to damnation if a person does not repent of the sin before death. It is alternatively called deadly, grave, and serious; the concept of mortal sin is found in both Catholicism and Lutheranism. A sin is considered to be &quot;mortal&quot; when its quality is such that it leads to a separation of that person from God&#x27;s saving grace. Three conditions must together be met for a sin to be mortal: &quot;Mortal sin is sin whose object is grave matter and which is also committed with full knowledge and deliberate consent.&quot; The sin against the Holy Spirit and the sins that cry to Heaven for vengeance are considered especially serious. This type of sin is distinguished from a venial sin in that the latter simply leads to a weakening of a person&#x27;s relationship with God. Despite its gravity, a person can repent of having committed a mortal sin. Such repentance is the primary requisite for forgiveness and absolution.

Teaching on absolution from sins is varied somewhat throughout Christian denominations. The teaching for Catholics on the sacrament of confession and the act of contrition for absolution was declared a mandatory catholic belief in the Council of Trent. Confession and Absolution is practiced in Lutheran churches, with it being historically held on Saturdays in preparation for Mass on the Lord&#x27;s Day.

==Concept origins==
===New Testament===
The term &quot;mortal sin&quot; is thought to be derived from the New Testament of the Bible. Specifically, it has been suggested by Jimmy Buehler from Theocast that the term comes from 1 John 5:16–17. In this particular verse, the author of the Epistle writes &quot;There is a sin that leads to death.&quot;

===Fathers of the Church===
The concept is hinted at in some works of the early Fathers of the Church and explicit in others.

In AD 385, Pacian of Barcelona, in his &quot;Sermon Exhorting to Penance&quot;, gives contempt of God, murder, and fornication as examples of &quot;mortal&quot; or &quot;capital sins&quot;.

In AD 393, St. Jerome writes:
==Catholicism==
In the moral theology of Catholicism, a mortal sin requires that all of the following conditions are met:
# Its subject matter must be grave. (The term &quot;grave sin&quot; is used at times to indicate grave matter, and at times to indicate mortal sin. But it always remains true that the following two conditions are requisite for mortal sin.)
# It must be committed with full knowledge (and awareness) of the sinful action and the gravity of the offense. 
# It must be committed with deliberate and complete consent.

The &quot;Catechism of the Catholic Church&quot; defines &quot;grave matter&quot;:

Although the Church itself does not provide a precise list of grave sins or divide actions into grave and venial categories, Church documents do name certain &quot;grave sins&quot; as well as &quot;offenses&quot; and &quot;actions&quot; whose subject-matter is considered to be grave. For example, in the area of human sexuality, the &quot;Catechism of the Catholic Church&quot; notes that the following actions can involve increased gravity: extramarital sex, divorce (but not legitimate separation), and masturbation. The sins against the Holy Spirit and the sins that cry to Heaven for vengeance are considered especially serious. Further, Pope Francis and many bishops privately regard certain sins as mortal, for example child abuse or neglect of one&#x27;s parents.

With respect to a person&#x27;s full knowledge of a certain act being a grave sin, the Catholic Church teaches that &quot;unintentional ignorance can diminish or even remove the imputability of a grave offense. But no one is deemed to be ignorant of the principles of the moral law, which are written in the conscience of every man. The promptings of feelings and passions can also diminish the voluntary and free character of the offense, as can external pressures or pathological disorders (mental illness). Sin committed through malice, by deliberate choice of evil, is the gravest.&quot; Furthermore, Catholic teaching also holds that &quot;imputability and responsibility for an action can be diminished or even nullified by ignorance, inadvertence, duress, fear, habit, inordinate attachments, and other psychological or social factors.&quot;

Mortal sins must be confessed by naming the specific offence along with how many times it was committed.

According to the Catholic Church, no person can receive the Eucharist when in a state of mortal sin:
Some mortal sins cause automatic excommunication by the very deed itself, for example renunciation of faith and religion, known as apostasy, desecration of the Eucharistic species, and &quot;a completed abortion&quot;. Those mortal sins are so serious that the Church through law has made them crimes. The Church forbids the excommunicated from receiving any sacrament (not just the Eucharist) and also severely restricts the person&#x27;s participation in other Church liturgical acts and offices. A repentant excommunicated person may talk to a priest, usually in a confessional, about their excommunication to arrange for the remission. Remission cannot be denied to someone who has truly repented their actions and has also made suitable reparation for damages and scandal or at least has seriously promised to do so. However, even if excommunicated, a Catholic who has not been juridically absolved is still, due to the irrevocable nature of baptism, a member of the Catholic Church and therefore must still carry out their obligations of fulfilling their duties of attending Mass, Divine Liturgy, etc. on a Holy Day of Obligation, abstaining from meat on the Fridays of Lent, etc., albeit their communion with the Christ and the Church is gravely impaired. &quot;Perpetual penalties cannot be imposed or declared by decree.&quot; However, &quot;the following are expiatory penalties which can affect an offender either perpetually&quot;.

Since the mid-twentieth century, some theologians have taught that a person who lives by a constant attitude of charity is unlikely to fall in and out of God&#x27;s graces without being profoundly aware of the change. The term &quot;fundamental option&quot; arose and is used in a variety of senses.

Pope John Paul II reaffirmed traditional teaching going back to the Council of Trent in his encyclical &quot;Veritatis Splendor,&quot; as does the &quot;Catechism of the Catholic Church&quot;, which states: &quot;The teaching of the Church affirms the existence of hell and its eternity. Immediately after death the souls of those who die in a state of mortal sin descend into hell, where they suffer the punishments of hell, &#x27;eternal fire&#x27;.&quot; The Catechism then adds: &quot;The chief punishment of hell is eternal separation from God, in whom alone man can possess the life and happiness for which he was created and for which he longs.&quot; However, the Catechism does not by name say a specific person is in Hell, but it does say that &quot;our freedom has the power to make choices for ever, with no turning back.&quot; Most significantly, the Catechism also proclaims that &quot;There are no limits to the mercy of God&quot;. and that &quot;although we can judge that an act is in itself a grave offence, we must entrust judgment of persons to the justice and mercy of God.&quot; One cannot see into their mind to know if it was deliberate or committed in full knowledge. Also, like the father in the Parable of the Prodigal Son, God forgives those who repent sincerely. Vatican II, in its Dogmatic Constitution &quot;Lumen Gentium&quot;, reflects the traditional teaching of the Church on punishment, and on merit or reward for good deeds.

Mortal sin is ordinarily remitted by the priestly absolution in the Sacrament of Penance. However, the effectiveness of the absolution is dependent of the acts of the penitent starting with sorrow for sin or contrition. Perfect contrition, coupled with the firm resolution to sin no more and to make recourse to the sacrament of Penance as soon as possible, can restore a person&#x27;s relationship with God, as well as God&#x27;s saving grace, that is, sanctifying grace. This teaching on perfect contrition is a reminder that God&#x27;s mercy and forgiveness is available outside the Sacrament of Penance, yet, also indicates that Catholics who know about Christ&#x27;s institution of the sacrament of Penance must intend to use it. Any human act that arises from a person&#x27;s love of God, is inspired by God&#x27;s prevenient action and is directed to doing as God requires. When perfect contrition is the means by which one seeks to restore one&#x27;s relationship with God, there must also be a resolution to confess all mortal sins (that have not been confessed and absolved previously) in the Sacrament of Penance.

===Eastern Catholic churches===
Autonomous, self-governing (), Catholic particular churches and liturgical rites in full communion with the Bishop of Rome, the Pope, are known as Eastern Catholic churches. They derive their theology and spirituality from some of the same sources as the Eastern Orthodox and Oriental Orthodox churches, yet use the Latin Catholic distinction between &quot;mortal&quot; and &quot;venial&quot; sin. However, names other than &quot;mortal&quot; and &quot;venial&quot; are often used.

===Actions constituting grave matter===
The following is a partial alphabetical list of actions that are defined as constituting grave matter, according to the &quot;Catechism of the Catholic Church&quot; or like sources (such as declarations by the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, Apostolic Letters, or other sources printed by Church authorities).


== Lutheranism ==
In Lutheranism, sins are of two classes:

The Smalcald Articles of Lutheranism teach that apostasy from the Christian faith can occur through loss of faith or through falling into a lifestyle characterized by mortal sin:
The Lutheran divine Martin Chemnitz, who contributed to the development of Lutheran systematic theology, delineated what are considered mortal sins:
With respect to the examination of conscience, Chemnitz implored Lutheran clergy to remind the faithful of what sins are mortal (especially the seven deadly sins) and those that are venial.

==Eastern Orthodoxy==
According to Father Allyne Smith, &quot;While the Roman Catholic tradition has identified particular acts as &#x27;mortal&#x27; sins, in the Eastern Orthodox tradition we see that only a sin for which we don&#x27;t repent is &#x27;mortal.&#x27;&quot;

According to the Mission of The Orthodox Church in America, in answer to a parishioner&#x27;s query:
In the Orthodox Church there are no &quot;categories&quot; of sin as found in the Christian West. In the pre-Vatican II Catholic catechism, sins were categorized as &quot;mortal&quot; and &quot;venial&quot;. In this definition, a &quot;mortal&quot; sin was one which would prevent someone from entering heaven unless one confessed it before death. ...These categories do not exist in the Orthodox Church. Sin is sin. Concerning Confession, having a list of deadly sins could, in fact, become an obstacle to genuine repentance. For example, imagine that you commit a sin. You look on the list and do not find it listed. It would be very easy to take the attitude that, since it is not on a list of deadly sins, it is not too serious. Hence, you do not feel the need to seek God&#x27;s forgiveness right away. A week passes and you have completely forgotten about what you had done. You never sought God&#x27;s forgiveness; as a result, you did not receive it, either. We should go to Confession when we sin – at the very least, we should ask God to forgive us daily in our personal prayers. We should not see Confession as a time to confess only those sins which may be found on a list.

Though not part of the dogma of the Orthodox Church the mortal–venial distinction is assumed by some Orthodox authors and saints as a theologoumenon. For example, Saint Ignatius Brianchaninov (1807–1867), who wrote primarily for monks, says in his book &quot;A Word on Death&quot;, in a chapter entitled &quot;Mortal sin&quot;:

Similarly, the &quot;Exomologetarion&quot; of Nicodemus the Hagiorite (1749–1809) distinguishes seven classes of sin:

# Pardonable
# Near the pardonable
# Non-mortal
# Near the non-mortal
# Between the mortal and the non-mortal
# Near the mortal
# Mortal

Nicodemus gives the following example for the seven classes of sin. &quot;The initial movement of anger is pardonable; near to the pardonable is for someone to say harsh words and get hot-tempered. A non-mortal sin is to swear; near the non-mortal is for someone to strike with the hand. Between the non-mortal and the mortal is to strike with a small stick; near the mortal is to strike with a large stick, or with a knife, but not in the area of the head. A mortal sin is to murder. A similar pattern applies to the other sins. Wherefore, those sins nearer to the pardonable end are penanced lighter, while those nearer to the mortal end are more severely penanced.&quot;

He also stipulates seven conditions of sin:

# Who is the doer of the sin
# What sin was committed
# Why was it committed
# In what manner was it committed
# At what time/age was it committed
# Where was it committed
# How many times was it committed

<doc id="357090" wikidata="Q1474884" url="?curid=357090" title="High Renaissance">
<text>In art history, the High Renaissance was a short period of the most exceptional artistic production in the Italian states, particularly Rome, capital of the Papal States, and in Florence, during the Italian Renaissance. Most art historians state that the High Renaissance started between 1490 and 1500, and ended in 1520 with the death of Raphael, although some say the High Renaissance ended about 1525, or in 1527 with the Sack of Rome by the mutinous army of Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor, or about 1530. The best-known exponents of painting, sculpture and architecture of the High Renaissance include Leonardo da Vinci, Michelangelo, Raphael, and Bramante. In the 21st century, the use of the term has been frequently criticized by some academic art historians for oversimplifying artistic developments, ignoring historical context, and focusing only on a few iconic works.

==Origin of term==
The art historian Jill Burke was the first to trace the historical origins of the term &quot;High Renaissance&quot;. It was first coined in German by Jacob Burckhardt in German (&quot;Hochrenaissance&quot;) in 1855 and has its origins in the &quot;High Style&quot; of painting and sculpture of the time period around the early 16th century described by Johann Joachim Winckelmann in 1764. Extending the general rubric of Renaissance culture, the visual arts of the High Renaissance were marked by a renewed emphasis upon the classical tradition, the expansion of networks of patronage, and a gradual attenuation of figural forms into the style later termed Mannerism.

==Time period==
Alexander Raunch in &quot;The Art of the High Renaissance and Mannerism in Rome and Central Italy&quot;, 2007, states the High Renaissance began in 1490, while Marilyn Stokstad in &quot;Art History&quot;, 2008, states it began in the 1490s. Frederick Hartt states that Leonardo&#x27;s &quot;The Last Supper&quot;, the painting of which began in 1495 and concluded in 1498, makes a complete break with the Early Renaissance and created the world in which Michelangelo and Raphael worked, while Christoph Luitpold Frommel, in his 2012 article &quot;Bramante and the Origins of the High Renaissance,&quot; states &quot;The Last Supper&quot; is the first High Renaissance work but adds that the peak period of the High Renaissance was actually 1505 to 1513. David Piper in &quot;The Illustrated History of Art&quot;, 1991, also cites &quot;The Last Supper&quot; writing the work announced the High Renaissance and was one of the most influential paintings of the High Renaissance, but contradictorily states that the High Renaissance began just after 1500. Burchkardt stated the High Renaissance started at the close of the 15th century, while Franz Kugler, who wrote the first &quot;modern&quot; survey text, &quot;Handbook of Art History&quot; in 1841, and Hugh Honour and John Fleming in &quot;The Visual Arts: A History&quot;, 2009, state the High Renaissance started at the beginning of the 16th century. Another seminal work of art which was created in the 1495–1500 timeframe was Michelangelo&#x27;s &quot;Pietà&quot;, housed in St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica, Vatican City, which was executed in 1498–99.

In contrast to most of the other art historians, Manfred Wurdram, in &quot;Masterpieces of Western Art&quot;, 2007, actually states that the dawn of the High Renaissance was heralded by Leonardo&#x27;s &quot;Adoration of the Magi&quot; of 1481, for which only the underpainting was completed.

As far as the end of the High Renaissance is concerned Hartt, Frommel, Piper, Wundrum, and Winkelman all state that the High Renaissance ended in 1520 with the death of Raphael. Honour and Fleming stated the High Renaissance was the first quarter of the 16th century meaning it would have ended in 1525. By contrast, Luigi Lanzi, in his &quot;History of Italian Painting&quot;, 1795–96, stated it ended with the Sack of Rome in 1527, when several artists were killed and many other dispersed from Rome, and Stokstad agrees. Raunch asserts that 1530 has been considered to be the end of the High Renaissance. Hartt adds that 1520 to 1530 was a transition period between the High Renaissance and Mannerism. Traditionally, the end of the High Renaissance in Florence is seen as marked by the end of the Republic of Florence and the beginning of the Duchy of Florence in 1532.

==Architecture==
High Renaissance style in architecture conventionally begins with Donato Bramante, whose Tempietto at S. Pietro in Montorio at Rome was begun in 1510. The Tempietto, signifies a full-scale revival of ancient Roman commemorative architecture. David Watkin writes that the Tempietto, like Raphael&#x27;s works in the Vatican (1509–1511), &quot;is an attempt at reconciling Christian and humanist ideals&quot;.

==Painting==

The High Renaissance of painting was the culmination of the varied means of expression and various advances in painting technique, such as linear perspective, the realistic depiction of both physical and psychological features, and the manipulation of light and darkness, including tone contrast, sfumato (softening the transition between colours) and chiaroscuro (contrast between light and dark), in a single unifying style which expressed total compositional order, balance and harmony. In particular, the individual parts of the painting had a complex but balanced and well-knit relationship to the whole. 
Painting of the High Renaissance is considered to be the absolute zenith of western painting and achieved the balancing and reconciliation, in harmony, of contradictory and seemingly mutually exclusive artistic positions, such as real versus ideal, movement versus rest, freedom versus law, space versus plane, and line versus colour. The High Renaissance was traditionally viewed as a great explosion of creative genius, following a model of art history first proposed by the Florentine Giorgio Vasari.

The paintings in the Vatican by Michelangelo and Raphael are said by some scholars such as Stephen Freedberg to represent the culmination of High Renaissance style in painting, because of the ambitious scale of these works, coupled with the complexity of their composition, closely observed human figures, and pointed iconographic and decorative references to classical antiquity, can be viewed as emblematic of the High Renaissance.

Even relatively minor painters of the period, such as Fra Bartolomeo and Mariotto Albertinelli, produced works that are still lauded for the harmony of their design and their technique. The elongated proportions and exaggerated poses in the late works of Michelangelo, Andrea del Sarto and Correggio prefigure so-called Mannerism, as the style of the later Renaissance is referred to in art history.

The serene mood and luminous colours of paintings by Giorgione and early Titian exemplify High Renaissance style as practiced in Venice. Other recognizable pieces of this period include Leonardo da Vinci&#x27;s &quot;Mona Lisa&quot; and Raphael&#x27;s &quot;The School of Athens&quot;. Raphael&#x27;s fresco, set beneath an arch, is a virtuoso work of perspective, composition and &quot;disegno&quot;.

In more recent years, art historians have characterised the High Renaissance as a movement as opposed to a period, one amongst several different experimental attitudes towards art in the late fifteenth and early sixteenth century. This movement is variously characterised as conservative, as reflecting new attitudes towards beauty, a deliberate process of synthesising eclectic models, linked to fashions in literary culture, and reflecting new preoccupations with interpretation and meaning .
==Sculpture==
High Renaissance sculpture, as exemplified by Michelangelo&#x27;s &quot;Pietà&quot; and the iconic &quot;David&quot;, is characterized by an &quot;ideal&quot; balance between stillness and movement. High Renaissance sculpture was normally commissioned by the public and the state, this becoming more popular for sculpture is an expensive art form. Sculpture was often used to decorate or embellish architecture, normally within courtyards where others were able to study and admire the commissioned art work. Wealthy individuals like cardinals, rulers, and bankers were the more likely private patrons along with very wealthy families; Pope Julius II also patronized many artists. During the High Renaissance there was the development of small scale statuettes for private patrons, the creation of busts and tombs also developing. The subject matter related to sculpture was mostly religious but also with a significant strand of classical individuals in the form of tomb sculpture and paintings as well as ceilings of cathedrals.

<doc id="357092" wikidata="Q202267" url="?curid=357092" title="Jacopo Sansovino">
<text>Jacopo d&#x27;Antonio Sansovino (2 July 1486 – 27 November 1570) was an Italian Renaissance sculptor and architect, best known for his works around the Piazza San Marco in Venice. These are crucial works in the history of Venetian Renaissance architecture. Andrea Palladio, in the Preface to his &quot;Quattro Libri&quot; was of the opinion that Sansovino&#x27;s Biblioteca Marciana was the best building erected since Antiquity. Giorgio Vasari uniquely printed his &quot;Vita&quot; of Sansovino separately.

==Biography==
Sansovino was born in Florence, Italy, and apprenticed with Andrea Sansovino, whose name he subsequently adopted, changing his name from Jacopo Tatti.

In Rome, while living in the palace of the late Cardinal Domenico della Rovere, Sansovino made a wax model of the Deposition of Christ for Perugino to use. Around 1510, Sansovino was invited by Bramante, along with three other sculptors to make wax copies of the Laocoön. Raphael judged Sansovino&#x27;s copy as the best.

Sansovino returned to Florence in 1511, where he received commissions for marble sculptures of St. James for the Duomo and a Bacchus, now in the Bargello. His proposals for sculpture to adorn the façade of the Church of San Lorenzo, however, were rejected by Michelangelo, who was in charge of the scheme, to whom he wrote a bitter letter of protest in 1518.

In the period of 1510–17, Sansovino shared a studio with the painter Andrea del Sarto, with whom he shared models. Like all sixteenth-century Italian architects, he devoted considerable energy to elaborate temporary structures related to courtly ceremonies and festivities. The triumphal entry of Pope Leo X into Florence in 1515 was a highpoint of this genre. Sansovino subsequently returned to Rome where he stayed for nine years, leaving for Venice in the year of the Sack of Rome.

==Career==
In 1529, Sansovino became chief architect and superintendent of properties (Protomaestro or &quot;Proto&quot;) to the Procurators of San Marco, making him one of the most influential artists in Venice. The appointment came with a salary of 80 ducats and an apartment near the clocktower in San Marco. Within a year his salary was raised to 180 ducats per year.

His main achievements are a group of prominent structures and buildings in central Venice found near Piazza San Marco, specifically the rusticated Zecca (public mint), the highly decorated Loggetta and its sculptures adjoining the Campanile, and various statues and reliefs for the Basilica of San Marco. He also helped rebuild a number of buildings, churches, palaces, and institutional buildings including the churches of San Zulian, San Francesco della Vigna, San Martino, San Geminiano (now destroyed), Santo Spirito in Isola, and the church of the Incurabili. Among palaces and buildings are the Scuola Grande della Misericordia (early plans), Ca&#x27; de Dio, Palazzo Dolfin Manin, Palazzo Corner, Palazzo Moro, and the Fabbriche Nuove di Rialto.

His masterpiece is the Library of Saint Mark&#x27;s, the &quot;Biblioteca Marciana&quot;, one of Venice&#x27;s most richly decorated Renaissance structures, which stands in front of the Doge&#x27;s palace, across the piazzetta. Construction spanned fifty years and cost over 30,000 ducats. In it he successfully made the architectural language of classicism, traditionally associated with severity and restraint, palatable to the Venetians with their love of surface decoration. This paved the way for the graceful architecture of Andrea Palladio.

He died in Venice and his tomb is in the Baptistery of St. Mark&#x27;s Basilica. His most important follower in the medium of sculpture was Alessandro Vittoria; another disciple was the architect and sculptor Danese Cattaneo.

<doc id="357094" wikidata="Q10944882" url="?curid=357094" title="Scheria">
<text>Scheria or Scherie (; or ), also known as Phaeacia () or Faiakia, was a region in Greek mythology, first mentioned in Homer&#x27;s &quot;Odyssey&quot; as the home of the Phaeacians and the last destination of Odysseus in his 10-year journey before returning home to Ithaca. It is amongst one of the earliest descriptions of a utopia.

==From Ogygia to Scheria (Odysseus)==
Before leaving Ogygia, Odysseus builds a raft and sails eastwards, instructed by Calypso to navigate using the stars as a celestial reference point. On the eighteenth day appear the shadowy mountains of the land of the Phaeacians, that looked like a &quot;shield&quot; in the misty deep. Poseidon spots his raft and seeking vengeance for his son Polyphemus who was blinded by Odysseus, produces a storm that torments Odysseus. After three days of struggle with the waves, he is finally washed up on Scheria.

==Odysseus meets Nausicaa==
Meanwhile, the goddess Athena sneaks into the palace, disguised as a sea-captain&#x27;s daughter, and instructs princess Nausicaa (the daughter of King Alcinous) in her sleep to go to the seashore and wash her clothes. The next morning, Nausicaa and her maids go to the seashore, and after washing the clothes, start to play a game on the beach, with laughs, giggles and shouts. Odysseus, sleeping nearby exhausted from his adventure, is awakened by the shouts. He covers his nakedness with thick leaves and goes to ask for help from the group. Upon seeing the unkempt Odysseus in this state, the maids run away, but, Nausicaa, encouraged by Athena, stands her ground and talks to him. To excuse the maids, she admits that the Phaeacians are &quot;the farthermost of men, and no other mortals are conversant with them&quot;, so they run away since they have never seen a stranger before. Nausicaa, being hospitable, provides clothes, food and drink to Odysseus, and then directs him to the palace of King Alcinous.

==The palace of King Alcinous==
Following Nausicaa&#x27;s instructions, Odysseus sought to enter the palace of King Alcinous and plead for mercy from the queen, Arete, so he could make his way home. On his way to the palace, Odysseus meets Athena disguised as a local girl. In her disguised state, Athena advises him about how to enter the palace. Athena, knowing that the Phaeacians were hostile towards men from the outlands, cloaked Odysseus in a mist that hid him from the Phaeacians&#x27; gaze. Under Athena&#x27;s protection, Odysseus passes through all of the protection systems of the palace and enters the chamber of King Alcinous. Odysseus throws his arms around the queen&#x27;s legs and supplicates her. Naturally, Alcinous and his court are surprised to see a stranger walking into their secured palace. It is only after Echeneus, a Phaeacian elder, urges King Alcinous to welcome the stranger that they offer Odysseus hospitality.

The front doors of the palace are flanked with two dogs made of silver and gold, constructed by Hephaestus. The walls of the palace are made of bronze that &quot;shines like the sun&quot;, with gates made of gold. Within the walls, there is a magnificent garden with apple, pear, and pomegranate trees that grow year-round. The palace is even equipped with a lighting system consisting of golden statues of young men bearing torches. After Odysseus tells Alcinous and his court the story of his adventures after the Trojan War, the Phaeacians take him to Ithaca on one of their ships.

==The Phaeacian ships==
The Phaeacians possessed remarkable ships. They were quite different from the penteconters, the ships used during the Trojan War, and they were steered by thought. King Alcinous says that Phaeacians carried Rhadamanthus to Euboea, &quot;which is the furthest of any place&quot; and came back on the same day.
He also explains to Odysseus what sort of information the Phaeacian ships require in order to take him home to Ithaca.

Homer describes the Phaeacian ships as fast as a falcon and gives a vivid description of the ship&#x27;s departure.

==Geographical location of Scheria==

Many ancient and modern interpreters favor identification of Scheria with the island of Corfu, which is within 110 km (68 miles) of Ithaca. Thucydides, in his &quot;Peloponnesian War&quot;, identifies Scheria as Corfu or, with its ancient name, Corcyra. In I.25.4, he records the Corinthians&#x27; resentment of the Corcyraeans, who &quot;could not repress a pride in the high naval position of an island whose nautical renown dated from the days of its old inhabitants, the Phaeacians.&quot; Locals on Corfu had long claimed this, based on the rock off the west coast of the island, which is supposedly the ship that carried Odysseus back to Ithaca, but was turned to stone by Poseidon, to punish the Phaeacians for helping his enemy,

The Phaeacians did not participate in the Trojan War. The Greek name Φαίακες is derived from &quot;phaiós&quot; (φαιός “gray”). The Phaeacians in the &quot;Odyssey&quot; did not know Odysseus (although they knew &quot;of&quot; him, as evidenced by the tales of Demodocus), so they called him a &quot;stranger&quot;. Odysseus however was the king of the majority of the Ionian Islands, not only of Ithaca, but also &quot;of Cephallenia, Neritum, Crocylea, Aegilips, Same and Zacynthus&quot; so if Scheria was Corfu, it would be surprising that the citizens of one of the Ionian Islands did not know Odysseus. Furthermore, when Odysseus reveals his identity, he says to the nobles: &quot;[…] if I outlive this time of sorrow, I may be counted as your friend, though I live so far away from all of you&quot; indicating that Scheria was far away from Ithaca.

Many characteristics of the Phaeacians, including their seafaring and relaxed lifestyle are suggestive of Minoan Crete. Aside from the seafaring prowess, the palace walls that shone like the Sun are read to be covered not by bronze but orichalcum. The latter similarities make Scheria also suggestive of Plato&#x27;s account of Atlantis. Helena Blavatsky proposed in her &quot;Secret Doctrine&quot; (1888) that it was Homer before Plato who first wrote of Atlantis. From the ancient times, some scholars having examined the work and the geography of Homer have suggested that Scheria was located in the Atlantic Ocean. Among them were Strabo and Plutarch.

===Geographical account by Strabo===

Approximately eight centuries after Homer, the geographer Strabo criticized Polybius on the geography of the &quot;Odyssey&quot;. Strabo proposed that Scheria and Ogygia were located in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean.

<doc id="357098" wikidata="Q364492" url="?curid=357098" title="Callimachus (polemarch)">
<text>Callimachus ( &quot;Kallímakhos&quot;) was the Athenian polemarch at the Battle of Marathon, which took place during 490 BC. According to Herodotus he was from the Attica deme of Aphidna.

== The Battle of Marathon ==
As polemarch, Callimachus had a vote in military affairs along with the 10 &quot;strategoi&quot;, including Miltiades. Miltiades convinced Callimachus to vote in favour of a battle when the &quot;strategoi&quot; were split evenly on the matter.

Miltiades is supposed to have said to Callimachus just before the polemarch cast his vote: &quot;Everything now rests on you.&quot;

During the battle, as polemarch, Callimachus commanded the right wing of the Athenian army as was the Athenian custom at that time. The right and left wings (the left wing commanded by the Plataeans) surrounded the Persians after a seemingly suicidal charge by the centre line.

Although the Greeks were victorious, Callimachus was killed during the retreat of the Persians while he was chasing them to their ships.

Plutarch, in his work: &quot;Moralia. Greek and Roman Parallel Stories&quot; mentions that Callimachus was pierced with so many spears that, even when he was dead, he continued to be in an upright posture.

There was a custom at Athens that the father of the man who had the most valorous death in a battle should pronounce the funerary oration in public. So, after the battle of Marathon, the father of Callimachus and the father of Cynaegirus had an argument about who of their sons were the bravest.

Callimachus was portrayed among the Athenian gods and heroes on the wall-paintings of the Stoa Poikile. The Athenians erected a statue in honour of Callimachus, the &quot;Nike of Callimachus&quot;.

According to some sources, before the battle, Callimachus promised that if the Greeks won, he would sacrifice to Artemis Agrotera as many goats as the number of Persians killed at the battlefield. Athenians kept his promise, in spirit, and every year sacrificed 500 goats, because they didn&#x27;t have enough goats for every single Persian who was killed at the battle (6,400).

== The statue of the &quot;Nike of Callimachus&quot; ==
After the battle of Marathon, Athenians created a statue in honour of Callimachus. The statue was the &quot;Nike of Callimachus&quot; and it was erected next to the Parthenon (not the Parthenon that we can see today, but the previous temple which was destroyed by the Persians) on the Acropolis of Athens.

<text>Sir Dingle Mackintosh Foot, QC (24 August 1905 – 18 June 1978) was a British lawyer, Liberal and Labour Member of Parliament, and Solicitor General for England and Wales in the first government of Harold Wilson.

==Family and education==
Born in Plymouth, Devon, Foot was the eldest son of Isaac Foot, who was a solicitor and founder of the Plymouth law firm, Foot and Bowden. Isaac Foot was an active member of the Liberal Party and was Liberal Member of Parliament for Bodmin in Cornwall between 1922 and 1924 and again from 1929 to 1935, and also a Lord Mayor of Plymouth. 

Dingle Foot was educated at Bembridge School, a boys&#x27; independent school on the Isle of Wight, and at Balliol College, Oxford, where he was President of the Oxford Union in 1928. He had four brothers: Michael, a prominent figure in the Labour Party and Leader of the Opposition from 1980 to 1983; John (Lord Foot), a Liberal politician; Hugh (Lord Caradon), Governor of Cyprus and British Ambassador to the United Nations and Christopher, a solicitor who joined the family firm. He also had two sisters. His nephew, Hugh&#x27;s son, was the campaigning journalist Paul Foot.

He married Dorothy Mary Elliston, who died in 1989. They had no children.

==Law career==
Foot was admitted to Gray&#x27;s Inn on 19 November 1925 and called to the bar on 2 July 1930. He became a Master Bencher in 1952 and was appointed Queen&#x27;s Counsel in 1954 He had been in active practice after having qualified a Barrister of England both in England and in several Commonwealth countries. He was called to the Bar or admitted as a solicitor or practitioner in Ghana (1948), Sri Lanka (1951), Northern Rhodesia (1956), Sierra Leone (1959), Supreme Court of India (as a Senior Advocate) (1960), Bahrain (1962) and Malaysia (1964). He also appeared regularly in the Courts of Kenya, Uganda, Tanganyika, Nyasaland and Pakistan. In addition, he had been regularly engaged in the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council since 1945.

==Politics==
From 1931 to 1945 Foot was Liberal Member of Parliament (MP) for Dundee. He was Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Economic Warfare in Winston Churchill&#x27;s wartime coalition, and a member of the British delegation to San Francisco Conference in 1945. He visited Washington in June 1944, and secured an agreement with the US State Department, the new War Refugee Board and the Foreign Economic Administration to supply 550 tons of aid parcels a month over a three-month period to &#x27;unassimilated civilian internees&#x27; in war-zones in Europe. At the 1945 election he lost his seat to Labour.

At the 1950 general election Foot defended the formerly Liberal seat of North Cornwall, following the defection of its member Tom Horabin to Labour in 1947, but he again lost, to the Conservative Harold Roper. He stood for the seat in 1951, losing again but by a narrower margin. Foot left the Liberals and joined the Labour Party in 1956. He was Labour MP for Ipswich from a 1957 by-election until 1970. Following his appointment as Solicitor General in the first government of Harold Wilson, he was knighted and made a Privy Counsellor in 1964. He served in this post for almost 3 years, from 18 October 1964 until 24 August 1967, until he was replaced by Arthur Irvine following a major government reshuffle. In 1970 he was again defeated, this time by the Conservative candidate. 

==Other work==
In the late 1940s and early 1950s Foot was often seen on BBC television as the moderator of the current affairs programme &quot;In the News&quot;. Often appearing with him were Michael Foot and Sir Bob Boothby.
His publications included &quot;Despotism in Disguise&quot; (1937) and &quot;British Political Crises&quot; (1976).

==Death==
Foot died on 18 June 1978 in a hotel in Hong Kong, after choking on a sandwich.

<text>Sir Nigel Ross Playfair (1 July 1874 – 19 August 1934) was an English actor and director, known particularly as actor-manager of the Lyric Theatre, Hammersmith, in the 1920s.

After acting as an amateur while practising as a lawyer, he turned professional in 1902 when he was 28. After a time in F. R. Benson&#x27;s company he made steady professional progress as an actor, but the major change in his career came in 1918, when he became managing director of the Lyric, a run-down theatre on the fringe of central London. He transformed the theatre&#x27;s fortunes, with a mix of popular musical shows and classic comedies, some in radically innovative productions, which divided opinion at the time but which have subsequently been seen as introducing a modern style of staging.

==Life==

=== Family background ===
Playfair was born in the parish of St George Hanover Square, Westminster, on 1 July 1874, the younger son of the five children of the obstetric physician William Smoult Playfair (1835–1903), and his wife, Emily, &quot;née&quot; Kitson (1841–1916). The &quot;Oxford Dictionary of National Biography&quot; says that the doctor is notable nowadays for &quot;his unintended contribution to medical ethics&quot; by breaching the confidentiality of one of his patients, and for popularising the Weir Mitchell &quot;rest-cure&quot;, a treatment criticised by Charlotte Perkin Gilman in &quot;The Yellow Wallpaper&quot;. Nigel Playfair&#x27;s paternal uncles included Lyon Playfair, 1st Baron Playfair, scientist and politician, and Lambert Playfair, soldier, diplomat and naturalist. His maternal uncle was James Kitson, 1st Baron Airedale, industrialist and politician, named after his father, Nigel&#x27;s grandfather, James Kitson, the pioneering railway engineer. Nigel&#x27;s cousin was Robert Hawthorn Kitson, a painter who settled in Taormina, Sicily.

=== Early years ===
He was educated at Winchester, Harrow, and University College, Oxford, where he took a third-class honours degree in modern history (1896). At university he was a member of the Oxford University Dramatic Society. Destined for a career as a lawyer he was called to the bar by the Inner Temple in 1900, performing in his spare time with two well-known amateur societies, the Old Stagers and the Windsor Strollers, before giving up the law for the stage.

Playfair&#x27;s first professional appearance was in Arthur Bourchier&#x27;s company at the Garrick Theatre, London, in July 1902, playing Mr Melrose in a curtain-raiser, &quot;A Pair of Knickerbockers&quot;. In 1903 he played his first professional Shakespeare role, Dr Caius in Herbert Beerbohm Tree&#x27;s production of &quot;The Merry Wives of Windsor&quot; at His Majesty&#x27;s Theatre. At the same time his first play, a one-act piece called &quot;Amelia&quot; was staged as a curtain-raiser at the Garrick. &quot;The Era&quot; called it &quot;a satire on cheap gentility which would have delighted Thackeray. 

Playfair joined F. R. Benson&#x27;s company touring in the West Indies, chiefly in comic Shakespearian parts. Back in London, in 1904, he first played his favourite role, Ralph, in &quot;The Knight of the Burning Pestle,&quot; and created the role of Hodson in Bernard Shaw&#x27;s &quot;John Bull&#x27;s Other Island&quot; at the Court Theatre.

In 1905 he married the actress Annie Mabel Platts (1875–1948), the daughter of a senior officer in the Indian Imperial Police; her stage name was May Martyn. They had three sons.

In 1907 at His Majesty&#x27;s, Playfair played Stephano in &quot;The Tempest&quot;, Clown in &quot;The Winter&#x27;s Tale&quot; and First Gravedigger in &quot;Hamlet&quot;, and in 1910 at the same theatre played the Host in &quot;The Merry Wives of Windsor&quot;. His roles between then and the First World War included Flawner Bannel in &quot;Fanny&#x27;s First Play&quot; (1911), Steward in &quot;The Winter&#x27;s Tale&quot; (1912), Sir Benjamin Backbite in &quot;The School for Scandal&quot; (1913) and Bottom in &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot; (1914). During the war he appeared in light plays, fashionable at that time.

===Lyric, Hammersmith===
in 1918 the author Arnold Bennett, who had been active in the theatre before the war, resumed his theatrical interest. He became chairman, with Playfair as managing director, of the Lyric Theatre, Hammersmith. A biographer of Playfair writes that the Lyric was &quot;a derelict playhouse in what was then little more than a slum … this theatre seemed the last place in the world where high-class entertainment could possibly succeed&quot;. But the theatre prospered. Among the productions were &quot;Abraham Lincoln&quot; by John Drinkwater, and &quot;The Beggar&#x27;s Opera&quot;, which, in Frank Swinnerton&#x27;s phrase, &quot;caught different moods of the post-war spirit&quot;, and ran for 466 and 1,463 performances respectively. In &quot;The Oxford Companion to the Theatre&quot; (1967) Phyllis Hartnoll comments that the Lyric became &quot;one of the most popular and stimulating centres of theatrical activity&quot;.

In 1920 Playfair returned to the role of Ralph in &quot;The Knight of the Burning Pestle&quot;. Over the next twelve years he produced and acted in a wide range of plays. Classics included &quot;The Way of the World&quot; (1924), &quot;The Duenna&quot; (1924), &quot;The Rivals&quot; (1925), &quot;The Beaux&#x27; Stratagem&quot; (1927) &quot;She Stoops to Conquer&quot; (1928) and &quot;The Critic&quot; (1928). Playfair interspersed the classics with new musical shows with scores by Dennis Arundell, Thomas Dunhill and Alfred Reynolds and words by himself, A. P. Herbert and others: &quot;Riverside Nights&quot; (1926), &quot;Tantivy Towers&quot; (1931) and &quot;Derby Day&quot; (1932). &quot;The Times&quot; commented that these shows demonstrated that Playfair&#x27;s &quot;special method – a mingling of intimacy, brightness, and burlesque – was not applicable to the classics alone&quot;. Sharp writes that Playfair gathered &quot;a loyal and happy team of young players, musicians, and designers who, under his genial leadership, not only began to make their reputations and confirm his, but also helped to create a specific Lyric style&quot;.

During his Hammersmith years Playfair continued to be active in other theatres. He produced &quot;As You Like It&quot; for the opening of the Shakespeare Festival at Stratford-upon-Avon in April 1919, and brought it to the Lyric in April 1920. He played Touchstone, in a production with set and costumes by Claud Lovat Fraser. It was a radical departure, inspired by the innovative ballet company the Ballets Russes. At the time, the text was usually heavily cut, but Playfair gave it almost complete. The scholar David Crystal describes the production as &quot;bright, dynamic and musical, with young actors&quot;. At the time, some theatre-goers resented it, but Crystal comments that many critics now call it the first modern production of the play.

In 1922 Playfair bought a long lease on Thurloe Lodge in South Kensington. Playfair and his family had previously lived at 26 Pelham Crescent. He bought the cottages with the proceeds from &quot;The Beggar&#x27;s Opera&quot;. Playfair engaged Darcy Braddell to remodel the house. The remodelling had cost twice as much as anticipated, and proved a drain on his finances in the wake of the failure of his light opera &quot;Midsummer Madness&quot;. Playfair would hold rehearsals for &quot;Midsummer Madness&quot; in the garden of Thurloe Lodge. The family moved from the house in late 1924 or early 1925.

Playfair was the author of the English acting versions of Karel Čapek&#x27;s &quot;R.U.R.&quot; and (with Clifford Bax) &quot;The Insect Play&quot; (both 1923), and he appeared in, and produced, many pieces outside his own theatre, including appearances in &quot;Prisoners of War&quot; at the Playhouse Theatre and &quot;The Green Hat&quot; at the Adelphi (both 1925), &quot;The Duchess of Elba&quot; at the Arts (1927), &quot;The Lady of the Camellias&quot; at the Garrick (1930). and &quot;Vile Bodies&quot; at the Arts (1931).

Playfair was prominent in fund-raising for London voluntary hospitals and was a member of the committee of King Edward&#x27;s Hospital Fund. He was knighted in 1928.

After a short illness and an unsuccessful operation Playfair died at King&#x27;s College Hospital, London on 19 August 1934, aged 60. He was cremated and his ashes were buried in the Playfair family vault in St Andrews.

==Legacy==
Fortnum &amp; Masons sell a rich, bitter marmalade, made for Sir Nigel since the 1920s and named in memory of him.

In 1965, London County Council erected a blue plaque commemorating Playfair at his former home, 26 Pelham Crescent, South Kensington.

==Memoirs==
Playfair wrote two volumes of memoirs about the Lyric:
*&quot;The Story of the Lyric Theatre, Hammersmith&quot; with an introduction by Arnold Bennett and an epilogue by A. A. Milne. (London: Chatto &amp; Windus 1925) 
*&quot;Hammersmith Hoy: A Book of Minor Revelations&quot; (London: Faber &amp; Faber 1930) 

==Films==
Playfair appeared in some films. He made several silents, and what his biographer Robert Sharp calls &quot;four indifferent talkies&quot;:
* &quot;Princess Clementina&quot; (1911, short)
* &quot;Lady Windermere&#x27;s Fan&quot; (1916)
* &quot;Masks and Faces&quot; (1917)
* &quot;Sunken Rocks&quot; (1919)
* &quot;Perfect Understanding&quot; (1933) 
* &quot;Crime on the Hill&quot; (1933) 
* &quot;The Lady Is Willing&quot; (1934) 
* &quot;Little Stranger&quot; (1934)
Sharp rates &quot;Crime on the Hill&quot; as &quot;perhaps his best, a country-house murder mystery in which he played the murderer.

==Honours==
*Playfair was knighted in the 1928 Birthday Honours, gazetted on 1 June 1928.

<text>Charles Goodyear (December 29, 1800 – July 1, 1860) was an American self-taught chemist and manufacturing engineer who developed vulcanized rubber, for which he received patent number 3633 from the United States Patent Office on June 15, 1844.

Goodyear is credited with inventing the chemical process to create and manufacture pliable, waterproof, moldable rubber.

Goodyear&#x27;s discovery of the vulcanization process followed five years of searching for a more stable rubber and stumbling upon the effectiveness of heating after Thomas Hancock. His discovery initiated decades of successful rubber manufacturing in the Lower Naugatuck Valley in Connecticut, as rubber was adopted to multiple applications, including footwear and tires. The Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company is named after (though not founded by) him.

==Early life==
Charles Goodyear was born on December 29, 1800, in New Haven, Connecticut, the son of Amasa Goodyear, and the oldest of six children. His father was a descendant of Stephen Goodyear, successor to Governor Eaton as the head of the company London Merchants, who founded the colony of New Haven in 1638.

Around 1817, Charles left his home and went to Philadelphia to learn the hardware business. He worked industriously until he was twenty-five years old, and then, returning to Connecticut, entered into a partnership in his father&#x27;s business in Naugatuck, CT where they manufactured not only ivory and metal buttons, but also a variety of agricultural supplements. He had siblings Nelson Goodyear, Henry Goodyear, Robert Goodyear, Harriet Goodyear Tomlinson, Amasa Goodyear, Jr.

==Marriage and early career==
On August 3, 1824, he married Clarissa Beecher, whom he met at his Congregational Church. Two years later the family moved to Philadelphia, and there Charles Goodyear opened a hardware store. This is where he did most of his work. His specialties were the valuable agricultural implements that his firm had been manufacturing, and after the first distrust of domestically made goods had worn away—for all agricultural implements were imported from England at that time—he found himself heading a successful business.

This continued to increase until it seemed that he was to be a wealthy man. Between 1829 and 1830 he broke down in health, being troubled with dyspepsia. At the same time, the failure of a number of business endeavors seriously embarrassed his firm. They struggled on, however, for some time, but were finally obliged to fail.

Between the years 1831 and 1832, Goodyear heard about gum elastic (natural rubber) and examined every article that appeared in the newspapers relative to this new material. The Roxbury Rubber Company, of Boston, had been for some time experimenting with the gum, and believed it had found means for manufacturing goods from it. It had a large plant and was sending its goods all over the country. It was some of Roxbury&#x27;s goods that first attracted Goodyear&#x27;s attention. Soon after this, Goodyear visited New York, and his attention went to life preservers, and it struck him that the tube used for inflation was not very effective nor well-made. Therefore, upon returning to Philadelphia, he made tubes and brought them back to New York and showed them to the manager of the Roxbury Rubber Company.

The manager was pleased with the ingenuity that Goodyear had shown in manufacturing the tubes. He confessed to Goodyear that the business was on the verge of ruin and that his products had to be tested for a year before it could be determined if they were perfect or not. To their surprise, goods that they had determined to be of good quality were being returned, the gum having rotted, making them useless. Goodyear at once made up his mind to experiment on this gum and see if he could overcome the problems with these rubber products.

However, when he returned to Philadelphia, a creditor had him arrested and imprisoned. While there, he tried his first experiments with India rubber. The gum was inexpensive then, and by heating it and working it in his hands, he managed to incorporate in it a certain amount of magnesia which produced a white compound that appeared to take away the stickiness.

He thought he had discovered the secret, and through the kindness of friends was able to improve his invention in New Haven. The first thing that he made was shoes, and he used his own house for grinding, calendering and vulcanizing, with the help of his wife and children. His compound at this time consisted of India rubber, lampblack, and magnesia, the whole dissolved in turpentine and spread upon the flannel cloth which served as the lining for the shoes. It was not long, however, before he discovered that the gum, even treated this way, became sticky. His creditors, completely discouraged, decided that he would not be allowed to go further in his research.

Goodyear, however, had no mind to stop here in his experiments. Selling his furniture and placing his family in a quiet boarding place, he went to New York and, helped by a friendly druggist, continued his experiments in an attic. His next step was to compound the rubber with magnesia and then boil it in quicklime and water. This appeared to solve the problem. At once it was noticed abroad that he had treated India Rubber to lose its stickiness, and he received international acclamation. He seemed on the high road to success, until, one day, he noticed that a drop of weak acid, falling on the cloth, neutralized the alkali and immediately caused the rubber to become soft again. This proved to him that his process was not a successful one. He therefore continued experimenting, and after preparing his mixtures in his attic in New York, would walk three miles to a mill in Greenwich Village to try various experiments.

In the line of these, he discovered that rubber dipped in nitric acid formed a surface cure, and he made many products with this acid cure which were held in high regard, and he even received a letter of commendation from Andrew Jackson.

Exposure to harsh chemicals, such as nitric acid and lead oxide, adversely affected his health. Once, he nearly suffocated himself by gas generated in his laboratory. Goodyear survived, but the resulting fever came close to taking his life.

Together with an old business partner, he built up a factory and began to make clothing, life preservers, rubber shoes, and a great variety of rubber goods. They also had a large factory with special machinery, built at Staten Island, where he moved his family and again had a home of his own. Just about this time, when everything looked bright, the panic of 1837 came and swept away the entire fortune of his associate and left Goodyear penniless.

His next move was to go to Boston, where he became acquainted with J. Haskins, of the Roxbury Rubber Company. Goodyear found him to be a good friend, who lent him money and stood by him when no one would have anything to do with the visionary inventor. A man named Mr. Chaffee was also exceedingly kind and ever ready to lend a listening ear to his plans, and to also assist him in a pecuniary way. About this time it occurred to Mr. Chaffee that much of the trouble that they had experienced in working India Rubber might come from the solvent that was used. He therefore invented a huge machine for doing the mixing by mechanical means. The goods that were made in this way were beautiful to look at, and it appeared, as it had before, that all difficulties were overcome.

Goodyear discovered a new method for making rubber shoes and received a patent which he sold to the Providence Company in Rhode Island. However, a method had not yet been found to process rubber so that it would withstand hot and cold temperatures and acids, and so the rubber goods were constantly growing sticky, decomposing and being returned to the manufacturers.

==Perfection and patent of vulcanization==

From 1834 through 1839, Goodyear worked anywhere he could find investors, and often moved locations, mostly within New York, Massachusetts, Philadelphia, and Connecticut. In 1839, Goodyear was at the Eagle India Rubber Company in Woburn, Massachusetts, where he discovered that combining rubber and sulfur over a hot stove caused the rubber to become rigid, a process which he called vulcanization because of the heat involved. For this Goodyear received US patent number 1090 on February 24 of the same year.

Several years earlier, Goodyear had started a small factory at Springfield, Massachusetts, to which he moved his primary operations in 1842. The factory was run largely by Nelson and his brothers. Charles Goodyear&#x27;s brother-in-law, Mr. De Forest, a wealthy woolen manufacturer became involved as well. The work of making the invention practical was continued. In 1844, the process was sufficiently perfected and Goodyear received US patent number 3633, which mentions New York but not Springfield. Also in 1844, Goodyear&#x27;s brother Henry introduced mechanical mixing of the mixture in place of the use of solvents. Goodyear sold some of these patents to Hiram Hutchinson who founded Hutchinson SA in France in 1853.

==Court cases regarding vulcanization==

In the year 1852, Goodyear went to Europe, a trip that he had long planned, and saw Thomas Hancock, then in the employ of Charles Macintosh &amp; Company. Hancock claimed to have invented vulcanization independently, and received a British patent, initiated in 1843, but finalized in 1844. In 1855, in the last of three patent disputes with fellow British rubber pioneer, Stephen Moulton, Hancock&#x27;s patent was challenged with the claim that Hancock had copied Goodyear. Goodyear attended the trial. If Hancock lost, Goodyear stood to have his own British patent application granted, allowing him to claim royalties from both Hancock and Moulton. Both had examined Goodyear&#x27;s vulcanized rubber in 1842, but several chemists testified that it would not have been possible to determine how it was made by studying it. Hancock prevailed.

Despite his misfortune with patents, Goodyear wrote, “In reflecting upon the past, as relates to these branches of industry, the writer is not disposed to repine, and say that he has planted, and others have gathered the fruits. The advantages of a career in life should not be estimated exclusively by the standard of dollars and cents, as is too often done. Man has just cause for regret when he sows and no one reaps.”

==Death and legacy==

Goodyear died on July 1, 1860, while traveling to see his dying daughter. After arriving in New York, he was informed that she had already died. He collapsed and was taken to the Fifth Avenue Hotel in New York City, where he died at the age of 59.

In 1898, almost four decades after his death, The Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Company was founded and named after Goodyear by Frank Seiberling.

On February 8, 1976, he was among six individuals selected for induction into the National Inventors Hall of Fame.

In Woburn, Massachusetts, there is an elementary school named after him.
The Government of France made him a Chevalier de la Légion d&#x27;honneur in 1855.

The ACS Rubber Division awards a medal named in Goodyear&#x27;s honor, the Charles Goodyear Medal. The medal honors principal inventors, innovators, and developers whose contributions resulted in a significant change to the nature of the rubber industry.

The Goodyear welt, a technique in shoemaking, was named after and in honor of its inventor, Charles&#x27; son; Charles Goodyear Jr.

<doc id="357107" wikidata="Q11680886" url="?curid=357107" title="Blind carbon copy">
<text>A blind carbon copy (abbreviated Bcc) is a message copy sent to an additional recipient, without the primary recipient being made aware. This concept originally applied to paper correspondence and now also applies to email. &quot;Bcc&quot; can also stand for &quot;blind courtesy copy&quot; as a backronym of the original abbreviation.

In some circumstances, the typist creating a paper correspondence must ensure that multiple recipients of such a document do not see the names of other recipients. To achieve this, the typist can: 
* Add the names in a second step to each copy, without carbon paper;
* Set the ribbon not to strike the paper, which leaves names off the top copy (but may leave letter impressions on the paper). 

With email, recipients of a message are specified using addresses in any of these three fields:
* To: Primary recipients
* Cc: Carbon copy to secondary recipients
* Bcc: Blind carbon copy to tertiary recipients who receive the message. The primary and secondary recipients cannot see the tertiary recipients. Depending on email software, the tertiary recipients may only see their own email address in Bcc, or they may see the email addresses of all primary and secondary recipients but will not see other tertiary recipients.

It is common practice to use the Bcc: field when addressing a very long list of recipients, or a list of recipients who should not (necessarily) know each other, e.g. in mailing lists.

==SMTP Mechanism for Email==

BCC in email is handled uniquely by the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol. Here BCC recipients are managed by specifying all recipients using the RCPT TO command, without distinguishing between To, CC, or BCC fields. The SMTP &quot;envelope&quot; includes each recipient, including those in BCC, but only To and CC recipients appear in the email headers visible to recipients. Provided SMTP servers respect this, this setup keeps BCC addresses hidden from end recipients, but allows each recipient to receive the email, as they are omitted from the email’s header information shown in email clients, while still being included in the SMTP delivery commands used to send the email. Consequently, email clients display only the listed To and CC recipients, preserving the privacy of BCC recipients.

==Benefits== 
There are a number of reasons for using this feature:
* Bcc is often used to prevent an accidental &quot;Reply All&quot; from sending a reply intended for only the originator of the message to the entire recipient list. Using Bcc can prevent an email storm from happening.
* To send a copy of one&#x27;s correspondence to a third party (for example, a colleague) when one does not want to let the recipient know that this is being done (or when one does not want the recipient to know the third party&#x27;s e-mail address, assuming the other recipient is in the To: or Cc: fields).
* To send a message to multiple parties with none of them knowing the other recipients. This can be accomplished by addressing a message to oneself (or, in some email clients, leaving the To: field empty) and filling in the actual intended recipients in the Bcc: field.
* To tighten the focus of an existing email correspondence. By &quot;moving people to BCC,&quot; a sender can remove non-essential parties from the recipient list so that future reply-all&#x27;s will not include them. It is customary to include a parenthetical note indicating that certain recipients have been moved to BCC. This can be done out of courtesy to uninterested parties, or as a way of politely cutting off non-essential parties from the thread going forward.
* To prevent the spread of computer viruses, spam, and malware by avoiding the accumulation of block-list e-mail addresses available to all Bcc: recipients, which often occurs in the form of chain letters.

==Disadvantages==

In some cases, the use of blind carbon copy may be viewed as mildly unethical. The original addressee of the mail (To: address) is left under the impression that communication is proceeding between the known parties, and is knowingly kept unaware of others participating in the primary communication.

A related risk is that by (unintentional) use of &quot;reply to all&quot; functionality by someone on Bcc, the original addressee is (inadvertently) made aware of this participation. For this reason, it is in some cases better to separately forward the original e-mail.

Depending on the particular email software used, the recipient may or may not know that the message has been sent via Bcc. In some cases, &#x27;undisclosed recipients&#x27; placed in the To: line (by the software) shows that Bcc has been used. In other cases, the message appears identical to one sent to a single addressee. The recipient does not necessarily see the email address (and real name, if any) originally placed in the To: line.

When it is useful for the recipients to know who else has received a Bcc message, 
* their real names, but not their email addresses, can be listed in the body of the message, or
* a meaningful substitute for the names can be placed in the body of the message, e.g. &#x27;[To General Manager and members of Remunerations Committee]&#x27;, or &#x27;[To the whole Bloggs family]&#x27;.

<doc id="357108" wikidata="Q373534" url="?curid=357108" title="James Hillhouse">
<text>James Hillhouse (October 20, 1754 – December 29, 1832) was an American lawyer, real estate developer, and politician from New Haven, Connecticut. He represented the state in both chambers of the US Congress. From February to March 1801, Hillhouse briefly served as President pro tempore of the United States Senate.

==Youth and Family life==
Hillhouse was born in Montville in the Connecticut Colony, the son of William Hillhouse and Sarah (Griswold) Hillhouse. He had at least nine siblings, seven of which survived to adulthood. At the age of seven, he was adopted by his childless uncle and aunt, James Abraham and Mary Lucas Hillhouse. He attended the Hopkins Grammar School in New Haven, Connecticut, and graduated from Yale College in 1773. At Yale, he was a member of the Linonian Society. He studied law and was admitted to the bar in 1775, and practiced law in New Haven.

===Family Life===
He married Sarah Lloyd in 1779 and that same year they had their one and only child together, Mary. However, Mary would pass away aged just three days, and Sarah would pass away three days after that. In 1782, he married Rebecca Woolsey. They had five children together: Sarah, Mary, James, Augustus, and Rebecca. All five would survive to adulthood. His wife, Rebecca Woolsey, would pass away in December, 1813 after 31 years of marriage.

==Revolutionary War==
During the Revolutionary War, Hillhouse served as captain of the Second 
Company of the Governor&#x27;s Foot Guard. During the successful British invasion of New Haven on July 5, 1779, he commanded troops alongside Aaron Burr, with Yale student volunteers.

==Career and Death==
Hillhouse was a member of the Connecticut House of Representatives from 1780 to 1785. He was a member of the Connecticut council of Assistants from 1789 to 1790 and was elected as a US representative from Connecticut at large for the Second, Third, and Fourth Congresses and served from March 4, 1791, to his resignation, in the fall of 1796. He also served as a judge of the Connecticut Supreme Court of Errors from 1789 to 1793.

Elected as a US senator on May 12, 1796, to fill the vacancy caused by the resignation of Oliver Ellsworth, Hillhouse was re-elected in 1797, 1803, and 1809, and he served from December 1796 to June 10, 1810, when he resigned. During the Sixth Congress he was President pro tempore of the Senate. During his time in this role, he administered the oath of office to Aaron Burr as Vice President, within the first inauguration of Thomas Jefferson on March 4, 1801.

In 1803, Hillhouse and several other New England politicians proposed secession of New England from the union because of the growing influence of Jeffersonian Democrats, especially after the Louisiana Purchase, which would further diminish Northern and Federalist influence.

Hillhouse was elected a member of the American Antiquarian Society in 1813.

In 1814, he was a Connecticut delegate to the Hartford Convention, and he was treasurer of Yale College from 1782 to 1832.

Hillhouse was a slaveholder.

Hillhouse passed away in New Haven on December 29th, 1832 at the age of 78. He was buried at Grove Street Cemetery located in the same city along with both his wives.

==Legacy==
Hillhouse made major contributions to the beautification of New Haven. He was active in the drive to plant the elm trees, which gave New Haven the nickname of &quot;Elm City.&quot; Hillhouse Avenue and James Hillhouse High School, in New Haven, are named after him.

He was a nephew of Matthew Griswold and an uncle of Thomas Hillhouse.

<text>David Humphreys (July 10, 1752 – February 21, 1818) was an American Revolutionary War colonel and aide de camp to George Washington, a secretary and intelligence agent for Benjamin Franklin in Paris, American minister to Portugal and then to Spain, entrepreneur who brought Merino sheep to America, and member of the Connecticut state legislature. He also was a prolific poet and author and a member of the Hartford Wits. As secretary and speechwriter to George Washington during his administration, Humphreys was the nation&#x27;s first U.S. presidential speechwriter.

==Early life and education==

Humphreys was born in what was then Derby, Connecticut but is present-day Ansonia, Connecticut in a spacious two-story house at 37 Elm Street. The house of his birth, now called the David Humphreys House, is a historic museum in recognition of his birth there. Humphreys was the youngest of five children, including four sons and a daughter. His parents were Daniel and Sarah Riggs Bowers Humphreys. Humphreys&#x27; father Daniel served as parson of the town&#x27;s Congregational church for 54 years from 1733, the year after he graduated from Yale, until 1787. Daniel Humphreys was the second husband of Sarah Riggs Bowers, known in Connecticut as &quot;Lady Humphreys&quot; in tribute to her &quot;dignity and refinement of character,&quot; according to biographer Leo T. Molloy.

As a boy, Humphreys was passionately fond of books. His father prepared him and his brother, Daniel, to attend his own &quot;alma mater,&quot; Yale College, and both of them entered there. David was 15 years old when he entered the school and 19 when he graduated in 1771 with distinguished honors. While at Yale, he founded Brothers in Unity, a debating society that came to prominence in the 1800s. Among his college friends at Yale were Timothy Dwight IV, who later became one of Yale&#x27;s great presidents; John Trumbull, a poet and lawyer and cousin of the painter of the same name; and Joel Barlow, a poet and diplomat.

After graduating from Yale, Humphreys became principal at the public school in Wethersfield, Connecticut for two years. He then worked as a tutor for the youngest of the 11 children of Col. Frederick Philipse at the Philipse Manor house in what is now Yonkers, New York.

Philipse Manor was a prominent and outspoken Tory academic institution, which only roused Humphrey&#x27;s Patriot leanings. In 1774, Humphreys returned to New Haven and received a master of arts degree from Yale. He was offered a position as a Yale instructor, which he refused and instead taught part-time at a New Haven private school run by his brother, Daniel. Two of Humphreys&#x27; contemporaries, John Adams and Nathan Hale, also taught in the early part of their lives.

==American Revolutionary War==

In July 1776, Humphreys enlisted in the Continental Army as a volunteer adjutant in the 2nd Connecticut Regiment and was stationed in New York state. The regiment consisted of several companies of men from Humphreys hometown of Derby, Connecticut. He later was engaged in military action in the Battle of Ridgefield following the burning of Danbury, Connecticut and in a later raid on Sag Harbor, New York.

In the Sag Harbor raid, the Continental Army captured 90 prisoners, destroyed 12 enemy brigs and sloops, an armed vessel and an enormous quantity of stores, and returned to Connecticut without the loss of a single soldier. Humphreys traveled to New Jersey to meet directly with General George Washington to brief Washington on the battle&#x27;s success. Their meeting in New Jersey was probably the first between the two.

Humphreys was promoted to captain and major and served on the staffs of Continental Army Generals Parsons, Israel Putnam, and Nathanael Greene. On June 23, 1780, Humphreys was appointed &quot;aide-de-camp&quot; at Washington&#x27;s headquarters staff, and he became a confidential friend and adviser to the general.

After the Battle of Yorktown, Washington entrusted the surrendered British colors, along with the general&#x27;s report on the battle, to Humphreys and Tench Tilghman, a fellow aide who also delivered word of the Patriot victory to Congress. A painting of Humphreys arriving with them, &quot;The Delivery of the Standards&#x27; to the Continental Congress in Philadelphia, November, 1781&quot;, is now displayed the New Haven Museum and Historical Society, which also has a ceremonial sword that Congress voted be presented to Humphreys. The sword was presented in 1786 by Gen. Henry Knox. Humphreys was commissioned a lieutenant-colonel with his commission backdated to his appointment as an aide to Washington.

When Washington resigned his commission and presented himself before Congress, Humphreys was one of two aides who accompanied him into the chamber; the other was Benjamin Walker. Humphreys then traveled with Washington and his wife Martha back to Mount Vernon. Washington later recommended to Congress that it appoint Humphreys secretary of foreign affairs, but Congress appointed John Jay instead.

After the Revolutionary War, Humphreys became an original member of Connecticut&#x27;s Society of the Cincinnati.

==Public service==
Humphreys was appointed to a commission to negotiate treaties of commerce with European nations. Other members of the commission included John Adams, Thomas Jefferson, and Benjamin Franklin. Humphreys became Franklin&#x27;s secretary in 1784 in Paris, where he also served as a U.S. intelligence agent, and continued as a secretary to the legation under Thomas Jefferson upon his appointment as U.S. Secretary of State under George Washington.

In a letter of introduction to Franklin, Washington described Humphreys, writing: &quot;This gentleman was several years in my family as aide-de-camp -- his zeal in the cause of his country -- his good sense, prudence and attachment to me, rendered him dear to me; and I persuade myself you will find no confidence which you may think proper to repose in him, misplaced. He possesses an excellent heart, good natural and acquired abilities and -- sterling integrity -- to which may be added sobriety and an obliging disposition.&quot;

In 1786, Humphreys was elected to the October session of the Connecticut General Assembly. He was appointed head of Connecticut&#x27;s state militia and marched to West Springfield, Massachusetts to help deal with the civil strife and tumult of Shays&#x27; Rebellion, but by the time he had arrived, Massachusetts authorities had already subdued it.

Humphreys&#x27; mother died on July 27, 1787, and his father died a few weeks later, on September 2. At Washington&#x27;s invitation, Humphreys stayed at Mount Vernon during the 1780s, acting as the general&#x27;s private secretary and managing his correspondence. When Washington took the oath of office in New York City after being elected the nation&#x27;s first president in 1792, Humphreys accompanied him on the trip from Mount Vernon and stood beside him during the ceremony. Humphreys served as Washington&#x27;s speechwriter and helped add flourish to his speeches and correspondences before and during his presidency.

In 1791, Humphreys had the distinction of being the first minister appointed to a foreign country under the Constitution when he was appointed minister to Portugal, the first neutral country to recognize the United States. In that post, Humphreys negotiated the ransomed release of American prisoners from the Dey of Tripoli, Libya.

In 1796, he was appointed as minister to Spain, which then controlled the Mississippi River and all of Latin America except Brazil. John Quincy Adams succeeded him as U.S. minister in Lisbon. He remained minister to Spain until 1801, and during his stay there met and married Anne Frances Bulkeley, a cultured and wealthy English woman, whose father, John Bulkeley, was a banker, merchant, and trader. In 1804, Humphreys was elected as a member to the American Philosophical Society in Philadelphia.

He served again as a member of the Connecticut House of Representatives from 1812 to 1814, and was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of London in June 1807. In 1813, Humphreys was also elected a member of the American Antiquarian Society.

==Entrepreneur==
The couple moved to Boston, where they bought a home on Chestnut Street on Beacon Hill and &quot;entertained lavishly.&quot; But Humphreys bought a farm in Derby, Connecticut, and the couple also managed to spend considerable time there. He also bought a factory and house, now known as the Sanford-Humphreys House in what is present-day Seymour, Connecticut that produced scythes and other iron tools. For a time, the community was called &quot;Humphreysville.&quot;

Having seen poor conditions in mills in England, he was determined to avoid a similar situation in his plant in Seymour. He took in many employees to New York City for training, educating, and clothing. Humphreys established evening and Sunday schools for his employees and organized them into a uniformed military company, which he drilled personally.

&quot;It was largely through his efforts that the state inaugurated its efforts at factory inspection,&quot; according to biographer Leo Molloy.

As a farmer, Humphreys was actively interested in agricultural improvements, and his farm became an experimental station. He helped found the Agriculture Society of Connecticut and became its first president.

==Merino sheep==
In 1802, Humphreys bought a herd of merino sheep in Spain and had them imported directly to Derby. Out of 25 rams and 75 ewes, five rams and two ewes died in the passage. They attracted a good deal of attention in town. &quot;Humphreys considered their fleece of a superior quality and believed that their mixture with American sheep would eventually result in the production, through manufacture, of finer fabrics in America,&quot; his biographer wrote.

He sold some of the sheep, which then were resold in a flurry of speculation. He set up the first successful woolen mill factory in the U.S., and it quickly achieved the reputation as the best producer of broadcloth in the nation. Coats made from the &quot;golden fleece&quot; were worn by President Thomas Jefferson, James Madison, and Captain Isaac Hull. Humphreys is regarded as the founder of the woolen industry in the U.S.

==Poet and author==
Humphreys composed the first American sonnet in 1776, titled &quot;Addressed to my Friends at Yale College, on my Leaving them to join the Army&quot;, and his most popular work, &quot;Happiness of America,&quot; written in 1785, was published in ten 10 print editions between 1786 and 1804.

Humphreys enjoyed writing and had a voluminous correspondence with Washington, now housed in the Library of Congress in Washington, D.C. He also wrote for the public and was the author of a &quot;Life of General Israel Putnam,&quot; whose staff he served on. He was one of the writers in the Hartford Wits; other members included Joel Barlow, Timothy Dwight IV, John Trumbull, and Lemuel Hopkins. He co-authored &quot;The Anarchiad&quot;, a satirical poem that reflected Humphreys&#x27; Federalist Party bent. In 1802, he wrote an anti-slavery poem, &quot;A Poem on the Industry of the United States of America&quot;. He was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1804.

In 1786, Humphreys wrote an account of the confinement and proposed execution of British Captain Charles Asgill for the &quot;New-Haven Gazette&quot;. The article, now included in Washington&#x27;s official papers on the affair, was published posthumously in 1859 as a book, &quot;The conduct of General Washington : respecting the confinement of Capt. Asgill, placed in its true point of light&quot;.

Humphreys&#x27; play &quot;The Yankey in England&quot; (c. 1814) was influential in forging the stage character of the Yankee, often singing &quot;Yankee Doodle&quot;, that came to dominate American and English comedies in the period up to 1850, and comes with a seven-page glossary of the peculiar idiom and pronunciation of Americanisms, which is an important source for American historical dialectology.

==Death==
Humphreys died in his room at Butler&#x27;s Tavern in New Haven, Connecticut, where he stayed when he was attending to affairs in Derby, and was interred at Grove Street Cemetery in New Haven.

<text>Othniel Charles Marsh (October 29, 1831 – March 18, 1899) was an American professor of Paleontology in Yale College and President of the National Academy of Sciences. He was one of the preeminent scientists in the field of paleontology. Among his legacies are the discovery or description of dozens of new species and theories on the origins of birds.

Born into a modest family, Marsh was able to afford higher education thanks to the generosity of his wealthy uncle George Peabody. After graduating from Yale College in 1860 he travelled the world, studying anatomy, mineralogy and geology. He obtained a teaching position at Yale upon his return. From the 1870s to 1890s, he competed with rival paleontologist Edward Drinker Cope in a period of frenzied Western American expeditions known as the Bone Wars. Marsh&#x27;s greatest legacy is the collection of Mesozoic reptiles, Cretaceous birds, and Mesozoic and Tertiary mammals that now constitute the backbone of the collections of Yale&#x27;s Peabody Museum of Natural History and the Smithsonian Institution. Marsh has been called &quot;both a superb paleontologist and the greatest proponent of Darwinism in nineteenth-century America.&quot;

==Biography==
===Early life and family===
Othniel Charles Marsh was born on October 29, 1831, near Lockport, New York. He was the third of four children born to Mary Gaines Peabody (1807–1834) and Caleb Marsh (1800–1865). The Marsh (nee Marshe) family and Peabody families immigrated to America from England in the 1630s. Mary died shortly after the birth of her fourth child in 1834. Caleb remarried in 1836 and Othniel moved with the family to Bradford, Massachusetts. Soon after, Caleb&#x27;s business fortunes soured, and Othniel&#x27;s early years were marked by financial struggles.

Caleb purchased a farm in Lockport when Marsh was twelve. As the eldest son, Othniel was expected to assist his father on the farm, and the two had a contentious relationship. Othniel much preferred excursions in the woods to his chores. Among his childhood influences was Ezekiel Jewett, a former military officer and amateur scientist who influenced Othniel&#x27;s interest in the sciences. Jewett had been drawn to the area by the fossils unearthed by the enlargement of the Erie Canal, and the two would hunt and prospect for specimens together.

By 1847, Othniel was attending school at the Wilson Collegiate Institute, and later attended the Lockport Union School. Othniel was undecided as to what he would do for a living, but the course of his future was dramatically changed due to the intervention of his uncle George Peabody, who was a successful banker. With Peabody&#x27;s financial assistance (spurred by Marsh&#x27;s aunt, Judith), Marsh enrolled in Phillips Academy in 1851. Older than most of the other students, he was nicknamed &quot;Daddy&quot; by his peers. He was initially an unremarkable student, devoting much of his time to leisure and games, but the next year decided to focus on his studies. &quot;I changed my mind,&quot; he later told a biographer, &quot;during an afternoon spent on Dracut Heights [Lowell]. I resolved that I would return to Andover, take hold, and really study.&quot;

Marsh applied himself to his studies and graduated valedictorian of his class in 1856. In the summers off of school, he prospected for minerals in New York, Massachusetts, and Nova Scotia. Upon gradation, Marsh decided to attend Yale, rather than Harvard, where many of his relatives had attended. He ran his letter to George Peabody asking for the funds by Aunt Judith first, who disapprovingly noted it contained two spelling errors. Peabody agreed to cover Marsh&#x27;s expenses and give him an allowance for spending money, and Marsh moved to New Haven in September. Marsh was a good student, but not a thrifty one; Aunt Judith, who was in charge of monitoring Marsh while Peabody was in Europe, regularly upbraided her nephew for his lax accounting habits and large expenses. Marsh graduated eighth in his class, using a scholarship he won for the best examination in Greek to finance a masters degree from Yale&#x27;s Sheffield Scientific School, as he developed an interest in becoming a professor of science. While in graduate school, Marsh published his first scientific papers on minerals and vertebrate fossils from his Nova Scotia trips, which possibly inspired Marsh&#x27;s interest in vertebrate paleontology. He obtained his masters degree in 1862.

===European travels===
Following school, Marsh declined a professorship at Yale and instead took a tour of Europe; it is possible the trip was to avoid being drafted into the American Civil War, although he might have also been disqualified from service on account of his eyesight. Marsh traveled through England, France, Germany, and Switzerland, studying with or making the acquaintance of prominent scientists such as Heinrich Ernst Beyrich, Wilhelm Peters, Christian Gottfried Ehrenberg and Henry Woodward. In discussions with his uncle, Marsh convinced the businessman to fund a natural history museum at Yale. While studying at the University of Berlin in late 1863, the 32-year-old Marsh first met 25-year-old Edward Drinker Cope, who was also on a scientific tour of Europe. Cope had much less formal schooling than Marsh, but had already published thirty-seven papers. The two Americans spent a few days together and would become friends. 

After a salmon fishing excursion with Peabody in Ireland, Marsh returned to America in July or August 1865. Marsh had expected Peabody&#x27;s gift would have resulted in a position at Yale, but it took until 1866 when Yale established a chair of paleontology at the university. Marsh was given the position, but no salary was attached; biographer George Grinnell suggested that this suited Marsh just fine, as he was more interested in research than teaching. Marsh&#x27;s interests shifted entirely to paleontology, and after 1869 his other scientific contributions mostly ceased.

===Trips west===
While teaching, Marsh toured the country, visiting museums to inform the planning of the Yale Museum. In 1868, he visited Cope; since their meeting, they had expressed warm wishes in letters to each other and even named species after each other. Cope took Marsh on a tour of the marl pits in New Jersey where he was finding fossils; unbeknownst to Cope, Marsh would later pay the pit operators to divert their finds to him instead of Cope. Marsh later noted that Cope&#x27;s reconstruction of his newest find, the aquatic reptile &quot;Elasmosaurus&quot;, was flawed: Cope had placed the head of the animal where its tail should have been. Marsh&#x27;s criticism wrankled Cope, and threatened his nascent career; he responded by critiquing errors in Marsh&#x27;s work, and moving in on areas Marsh was prospecting in. Their relationship began to sour.

Marsh was looking further afield than New Jersey for fossils. After visiting Chicago for a meeting of the American Association, Marsh elected to join other members to Omaha on a &quot;geological excursion&quot;; it was Marsh&#x27;s first trip to the far western United States, and it inspired him to return to prospect.

Marsh organized a series of private expeditions starting in 1870 to 1874, with the prospecting groups composed of Yale students or recent graduates. The first of these uncovered more than a hundred new species of vertebrate fossils. After 1876, Marsh employed bone hunters who shipped specimens back to him; he did not return west himself until 1879.

When Cope began prospecting for fossils in the Bridger Basin, which Marsh considered &quot;his&quot; territory, their relationship deteriorated into hostility.

Marsh served as Vertebrate Paleontologist of the U.S. Geological Survey from 1882 to 1892. Thanks to John Wesley Powell, head of the USGS, and Marsh&#x27;s contacts in Washington, Marsh was placed at the head of the consolidated government survey in the late 1880s.

===Other career highlights===
In 1880, Marsh caught the attention of the scientific world with the publication of &quot;Odontornithes: a Monograph on Extinct Birds of North America,&quot; which included his discoveries of birds with teeth. These skeletons helped bridge the gap between dinosaurs and birds, and provided invaluable support for Darwin&#x27;s theory of evolution. Darwin wrote to Marsh saying, &quot;Your work on these old birds &amp; on the many fossil animals of N. America has afforded the best support to the theory of evolution, which has appeared within the last 20 years&quot; (since Darwin&#x27;s publication of &quot;Origin of Species). 
Between 1883 and 1895, Marsh was President of the National Academy of Sciences.

The pinnacle of Marsh&#x27;s work with dinosaurs came in 1896 with the publication of his two quartos, &quot;Dinosaurs of North America&quot; and &quot;Vertebrate Fossils,&quot; which demonstrated his unsurpassed knowledge of the subject.

On December 13, 1897, Marsh received the Cuvier Prize of 1,500 francs from the French Academy of Science.

==Personality and views==
McCarren called Marsh the greatest proponent of Darwinism in 19th-century America. In 1877 remarks to the Marsh said, &quot;I am sure I need to offer no argument for evolution; since to doubt evolution today is to doubt science, and science is only another name for truth.&quot;
==Death==
He died on March 18, 1899 in New Haven, Connecticut.
==Legacy==

According to Peter Dodson, Cope and Marsh &quot;[have] left a legacy, and each was a distinguished researcher. But really it seems impossible to say one name without the other. Cope and Marsh.&quot; Marsh&#x27;s names for three dinosaur groups, and nineteen genera, have survived, and though only three of Cope&#x27;s named genera are still in use, he published a record 1400 scientific papers. McCarren called Cope the only other American paleontologist who could rival Marsh&#x27;s legacy.
Marsh named the following dinosaur genera:
He named the suborders Ceratopsia (1890), Ceratosauria (1884), Ornithopoda (1881), Stegosauria (1877), and Theropoda (1881).

He also named the families Allosauridae (1878), Anchisauridae (1885), Camptosauridae (1885), Ceratopsidae (1890), Ceratosauridae, Coeluridae, Diplodocidae (1884), Dryptosauridae (1890), Nodosauridae (1890), Ornithomimidae (1890), Plateosauridae (1895), and Stegosauridae (1880).

Marsh dubbed many additional species of dinosaur as well, notable taxa including &quot;Allosaurus fragilis, Triceratops horridus, Stegosaurus stenops, Ornithomimus velox&quot;, and &quot;Brontosaurus excelsus&quot;.

Dinosaurs named by others in honour of Marsh include &quot;Hoplitosaurus marshi&quot; (Lucas, 1901), &quot;Iaceornis marshi&quot; (Clarke, 2004), &quot;Marshosaurus&quot; (Madsen, 1976), &quot;Othnielia&quot; (Galton, 1977), and &quot;Othnielosaurus&quot; (Galton, 2007).

Marsh&#x27;s finds formed the original core of the collection of Yale&#x27;s Peabody Museum of Natural History. The museum&#x27;s Great Hall is dominated by the first fossil skeleton of &quot;Brontosaurus&quot; that he discovered, which was reclassified as &quot;Apatosaurus&quot; for a time. However, an extensive study published in 2015 concluded that &quot;Brontosaurus&quot; was a valid genus of sauropod distinct from &quot;Apatosaurus&quot;. Some other Marsh taxa like &quot;Camarasaurus lentus, Nanosaurus agilis&quot;, and &quot;Camptosaurus dispar&quot; are also represented in the Peabody fossil hall.

He donated his home in New Haven, Connecticut, to Yale University in 1899. The Othniel C. Marsh House, now known as Marsh Hall, is designated a National Historic Landmark. Marsh Hall serves as the home of the Yale School of Forestry at the Yale School of the Environment. The grounds are now known as the Marsh Botanical Garden.

Marsh was elected a member of the American Antiquarian Society in 1877.

Marsh formulated the Law of brain growth, which states that, during the tertiary period, many taxonomic groups presented gradual increase in the size of the brain. This evolutionary law remains being used due to its explanatory, and to a certain extent, predictive potential 

Prior to Marsh&#x27;s efforts, the entirety of fossil remains known in North America was quite small. As a result of the generosity of George Peabody, Marsh was able to keep discovery teams in the field almost continuously from 1870 until his death. The material recovered in his 30 years of collection was simply astonishing to the scientific community. At the Peabody Museum, Marsh was the first to create skeletal displays of dinosaurs, which are now common in countless museums of natural history.

Marsh biographer Mark J. McCarren summed it up this way, Marsh&#x27;s &quot;contributions to the understanding of extinct reptiles, birds and mammals are unequaled in the history of paleontology.&quot;

Marsh Butte, located in the Grand Canyon, was officially named in his honor in 1906.

<text>Imaginary friends (also known as pretend friends, invisible friends or made-up friends) are a psychological and a social phenomenon where a friendship or other interpersonal relationship takes place in the imagination rather than physical reality.

Although they may seem real to their creators, children usually understand that their imaginary friends are not real.

The first studies focusing on imaginary friends are believed to have been conducted during the 1890s. There is little research about the concept of imaginary friends in children&#x27;s imaginations. Klausen and Passman (2007) report that imaginary companions were originally described as being supernatural creatures and spirits that were thought to connect people with their past lives. Adults in history have had entities such as household gods, guardian angels, and muses that functioned as imaginary companions to provide comfort, guidance and inspiration for creative work. It is possible the phenomenon appeared among children in the mid-19th century when childhood was emphasized as an important time for play and imagination.

==Description==
In some studies, imaginary friends are defined as children impersonating a specific character (imagined by them), or objects or toys that are personified. However, some psychologists will define an imaginary friend only as a separate created character. Imaginary friends can be people, but they can also take the shape of other characters such as animals or other abstract ideas such as ghosts, monsters, robots, aliens or angels. These characters can be created at any point during a lifetime, though Western culture suggests they are most acceptable in preschool- and school-age children.
Most research agrees that girls are more likely than boys to develop imaginary friends. Once children reach school age, boys and girls are equally likely to have an imaginary companion. Research has often reiterated that there is not a specific &quot;type&quot; of child that creates an imaginary friend. Whenever children have a fantasy they may come to believe some imaginary world exists in another universe or create imaginary world for imaginary friends to live.

Research has shown that imaginary friends are a normative part of childhood and even adulthood. Additionally, some psychologists suggest that imaginary friends are much like a fictional character created by an author.
As Eileen Kennedy-Moore points out, &quot;Adult fiction writers often talk about their characters taking on a life of their own, which may be an analogous process to children’s invisible friends.&quot; In addition, Marjorie Taylor and her colleagues have found that fiction writers are more likely than average to have had imaginary friends as children.

There is a difference between the common imaginary friends that many children create, and the imaginary voices of psychopathology. Often when there’s a psychological disorder and any inner voices are present, they add negativity to the conversation. The person with the disorder may sometimes believe that the imagined voices are physically real, not an imagined inner dialog.

Imaginary friends can serve various functions. Playing with imaginary friends enables children to enact behaviors and events they have not yet experienced. Imaginary play allows children to use their imagination to construct knowledge of the world. In addition, imaginary friends might also fulfill children&#x27;s innate desire to connect with others before actual play among peers is common. According to psychologist Lev Vygotsky, cultural tools and interaction with people mediate psychological functioning and cognitive development. Imaginary friends, perceived as real beings, could teach children how to interact with others along with many other social skills. Vygotsky&#x27;s sociocultural view of child development includes the notion of children&#x27;s “zone of proximal development,” which is the difference between what children can do with and without help. Imaginary friends can aid children in learning things about the world that they could not learn without help, such as appropriate social behavior, and thus can act as a scaffold for children to achieve slightly above their social capability.

In addition, imaginary friends also serve as a means for children to experiment with and explore the world. In this sense, imaginary companions also relate to Piaget&#x27;s theory of child development because they are completely constructed by the child. According to Piaget, children are scientific problem solvers who self-construct experiences and build internal mental structures based on experimentation. The creation of and interaction with imaginary companions helps children to build such mental structures. The relationship between a child and their imaginary friend can serve as a catalyst for the formation of real relationships in later development and thus provides a head start to practising real-life interaction.

==Research==
It has been theorized that children with imaginary friends may develop language skills and retain knowledge faster than children without them, which may be because these children get more linguistic practice than their peers as a result of carrying out &quot;conversations&quot; with their imaginary friends.

Kutner (n.d.) reported that 65% of 7-year-old children report they have had an imaginary companion at some point in their lives. He further reported:

Imaginary friends are an integral part of many children&#x27;s lives. They provide comfort in times of stress, companionship when they&#x27;re lonely, someone to boss around when they feel powerless, and someone to blame for the broken lamp in the living room. Most important, an imaginary companion is a tool young children use to help them make sense of the adult world.

Taylor, Carlson &amp; Gerow (c2001: p. 190) hold that:

despite some results suggesting that children with imaginary friends might be superior in intelligence, it is not true that all intelligent children create them.
If imaginary friends can provide assistance to children in developing their social skills, they must function as important roles in the lives of children. Hoff (2004 – 2005) was interested in finding out the roles and functions of imaginary friends and how they impacted the lives of children. The results of her study have provided some significant insight on the roles of imaginary friends. Many of the children reported their imaginary friends as being sources of comfort in times of boredom and loneliness. Another interesting result was that imaginary friends served to be mentors for children in their academics. They were encouraging, provided motivation, and increased the self-esteem of children when they did well in school. Finally, imaginary friends were reported as being moral guides for children. Many of the children reported that their imaginary friends served as a conscience and helped them to make the correct decision in times where morality was questioned.

Other professionals such as Marjorie Taylor feel imaginary friends are common among school-age children and are part of normal social-cognitive development. Part of the reason people believed children gave up imaginary companions earlier than has been observed is related to Piaget&#x27;s stages of cognitive development. Piaget suggested that imaginary companions disappeared once children entered the concrete operational stage of development. Marjorie Taylor identified middle school children with imaginary friends and followed up six years later as they were completing high school. At follow-up, those who had imaginary friends in middle school displayed better coping strategies but a &quot;low social preference for peers.&quot; She suggested that imaginary friends may directly benefit children&#x27;s resiliency and positive adjustment.
Because imagination play with a character involves the child often imagining how another person (or character) would act, research has been done to determine if having an imaginary companion has a positive effect on theory of mind development. In a previous study, Taylor &amp; Carlson (1997) found that 4-year-old children who had imaginary friends scored higher on emotional understanding measures and that having a theory of mind would predict higher emotional understanding later on in life. When children develop the realization that other people have different thoughts and beliefs other than their own, they are able to grow in their development of theory of mind as they begin to have better understandings of emotions.

=== Positive psychology===

The article &quot;Pretend play and positive psychology: Natural companions&quot; defined many great tools that are seen in children who engage pretend play. These five areas include creativity, coping, emotion regulation, empathy/emotional understanding and hope. Hope seems to be the underlying tool children use in motivation. Children become more motivated when they believe in themselves, therefore children will not be discouraged to come up with different ways of thinking because they will have confidence. Imaginary companionship displays immense creativity helping them to develop their social skills and creativity is frequently discussed term amongst positive psychology.

An imaginary companion can be considered the product of the child&#x27;s creativity whereas the communication between the imaginary friend and the child is considered to be the process.

===Adolescence===

&quot;Imaginary companions in adolescence: sign of a deficient or positive development?&quot; explores the extent to which adolescents create imaginary companions. The researchers explored the prevalence of imaginary companions in adolescence by investigating the diaries of adolescents age 12-17. In addition they looked at the characteristics of these imaginary companions and did a content analysis of the data obtained in the diaries. There were three hypotheses tested: (1) the deficit hypothesis, (2) the giftedness hypothesis, (3) the egocentrism hypothesis. The results of their study concluded that creative and socially competent adolescents with great coping skills were particularly prone to the creation of these imaginary friends. These findings did not support the deficit hypothesis or egocentrism hypothesis, further suggesting that these imaginary companions were not created with the aim to replace or substitute a real-life family member or friend, but they simply created another &quot;very special friend&quot;. This is surprising because it is usually assumed that children who create imaginary companions have deficits of some sort, and it is unheard of for an adolescent to have an imaginary companion.

====Tulpa====
Following the popularizing and secularizing of the concept of tulpa in the Western world, these practitioners, calling themselves &quot;tulpamancers&quot;, report an improvement to their personal lives through the practice, and new unusual sensory experiences. Some practitioners use the tulpa for sexual and romantic interactions, though the practice is considered taboo. A survey of the community with 118 respondents on the explanation of tulpas found 8.5% support a metaphysical explanation, 76.5% support a neurological or psychological explanation, and 14% &quot;other&quot; explanations. Nearly all practitioners consider the tulpa a real or somewhat-real person. The number of active participants in these online communities is in the low hundreds, and few meetings in person have taken place.

===Birth order===

To uncover the origin of imaginary companions and learn more about the children who create them, it is necessary to seek out children who have created imaginary companions. Unfortunately young children cannot accurately self-report, therefore the most effective way to gather information about children and their imaginary companions is by interviewing the people who spend the most time with them. Often mothers are the primary caretakers who spend the most time with a child. Therefore, for this study 78 mothers were interviewed and asked whether their child had an imaginary friend. If the mother revealed that their child did not have an imaginary companion then the researcher asked about the child&#x27;s tendency to personify objects.

In order to convey the meaning of personified objects the researchers explained to the mothers that it is common for children to choose a specific toy or object that they are particularly attached to or fond of. For the object to qualify as a personified object the child had to treat it as animate. Furthermore, it is necessary to reveal what children consider an imaginary friend or pretend play. In order to distinguish a child having or not having an imaginary companion, the friend had to be in existence for at least one month. In order to examine the developmental significance of preschool children and their imaginary companions the mothers of children were interviewed. The major conclusion from the study was that there is a significant distinction between invisible companions and personified objects.

A significant finding in this study was the role of the child&#x27;s birth order in the family in terms of having an imaginary companion or not. The results of the interviews with mothers indicated that children with imaginary friends were more likely to be a first-born child when compared to children who did not have an imaginary companion at all. This study further supports that children may create imaginary friends to work on social development. The findings that a first-born child is more likely to have an imaginary friend sheds some light on the idea that the child needs to socialize therefore they create the imaginary friend to develop their social skills. This is an extremely creative way for children to develop their social skills and creativity is frequently discussed term amongst positive psychology. An imaginary companion can be considered the product of creativity whereas the communication between the imaginary friend and the child is the process.
In regards to birth order there is also research on children who do not have any siblings at all. The research in this area further investigates the notion that children create imaginary companions due to the absence of peer relationships. A study that examined the differences in self-talk frequency as a function of age, only-child, and imaginary childhood companion status provides a insight to the commonalties of children with imaginary companions. The researchers collected information from college students who were asked if they ever had an imaginary friend as a child (Brinthaupt &amp; Dove, 2012). There were three trials in the study and the researchers found that there were significant differences in self-talk between different age groupings.

Their first trial indicated that only children who create imaginary companions actually engage in high levels of positive self-talk had more positive social development. They also found that women were more likely than men to have had an imaginary companion. Their findings were consistent with other research which suggests that it is more common for females to have imaginary companions. The researchers suggested that women may be more likely to have imaginary companions because they are more likely to rely on feedback from persons other than themselves, thus supporting the theory that men have more self reinforcing self-talk.

Furthermore, other research has concluded that women seek more social support than men, which could be another possibility for creating these imaginary companions. The second trial found that children without siblings reported more self-talk than children with siblings; the third trial found that the students who reported having an imaginary friend also reported more self-talk than the other students who did not have imaginary friends. When self-talk is negative, it is associated with effects such as increased anxiety and depression. The researchers concluded that &quot;individuals with higher levels of social-assessment and critical self-talk reported lower self-esteem and more frequent automatic negative self-statements.&quot; When self-talk is positive, however, the study found that &quot;people with higher levels of self-reinforcing self-talk reported more positive self-esteem and more frequent automatic positive self-statements&quot;.

<text>Ithiel Town (October 3, 1784 – June 13, 1844) was an American architect and civil engineer. One of the first generation of professional architects in the United States, Town made significant contributions to American architecture in the first half of the 19th century. His work, in the Federal and revivalist Greek and Gothic revival architectural styles, was influential and widely copied.

==Life and works==
Town was born in Thompson, Connecticut, to Archelaus Town, a farmer, and Martha (Johnson) Town. He trained with the eminent Asher Benjamin in Boston and began his own professional career with the Asa Gray House (1810).

His earliest important architectural works include Center Church (1812–1815), and Trinity Church (1813–1816), both on the New Haven Green in New Haven, Connecticut. He demonstrated his virtuosity as an engineer by constructing the spire for Center Church inside the tower and then raising it into place in less than three hours using a special windlass. Trinity Church, built from local seam-faced trap rock and topped with a square tower, was one of the earliest Gothic Revival churches in America.

In 1825, Town became one of the original members of the National Academy of Design and was awarded an honorary Master of Arts degree from Yale University.

===Town&#x27;s lattice bridge===

On January 28, 1820, Town was granted a patent for a wooden lattice truss bridge, which became known as the Town Bridge. The design was of great importance because it could be built quickly by relatively unskilled workers from readily available material. The design also avoided the need for the heavy piers needed for stone arches. The design was widely known throughout the world and made Town wealthy (Town is said to have charged one to two dollars per foot in royalties for his designs). Town&#x27;s design can still be seen in two of Connecticut&#x27;s remaining covered bridges, Bull&#x27;s Bridge in Kent and West Cornwall Covered Bridge in Cornwall and Sharon, and in the Eagleville Bridge and the Shushan Bridge in Washington County, New York. Many other extant covered bridges also employ Town&#x27;s basic design. The lattice is sometimes called a truss, although it lacks vertical members.

===Town and Davis===
In 1829, Town formed one of the first professional architectural firms in the United States with Alexander Jackson Davis, together producing notable buildings in a range of new Revival styles, including Greek, Gothic, Tuscan, and Egyptian. 
Town also traveled in Europe during this period (1829–30).

The firm lasted until 1835; for eighteen months in 1832 and 1833, it operated as Town, Davis, and Dakin, when James H. Dakin joined the firm. Their works included the state capitol in New Haven, the city hall and Wadsworth Atheneum in Hartford, Connecticut, the capitol buildings of Indiana (1831–1840, demolished 1877), and North Carolina (1833–1840), and the U.S. Custom House, now Federal Hall National Memorial, in New York City (1833–1842). During this time, Town also designed the Potomac Aqueduct in Washington, D.C. (1833–1843), which allowed fully loaded canal boats to cross the Potomac River. It was considered one of the most remarkable engineering feats of the time.

===Home and library===

Town designed his New Haven home on Hillhouse Avenue in the Greek Revival style; here he kept what was then an extraordinary architectural library — an inspiration to many, including Davis and another noted New Haven architect, Henry Austin. His library contained more than 11,000 volumes of architecture books and prints and was far larger than any other personal collection anywhere at the time, including that of Sir John Soane in London. The library was amassed at a time when only a handful of significant architecture books had been published in America.
Town left many of his books to Yale upon his death; the rest were sold.

In 1839, Town commissioned noted American painter Thomas Cole to execute a painting called &quot;The Architect&#x27;s Dream&quot;, which now hangs in the Toledo Museum of Art.

Town&#x27;s house was later owned by Joseph Earl Sheffield, benefactor of the Sheffield Scientific School and modified by Austin. Town designed a number of other stately homes on Hillhouse.

===Death===
Town died in New Haven on June 13, 1844, and is interred in Grove Street Cemetery, New Haven, Connecticut.

<doc id="357127" wikidata="Q8041936" url="?curid=357127" title="XEW-AM">
<text>XEW-AM (900 kHz) and XEW-FM (96.9 MHz) are commercial radio stations in Mexico City, Mexico, simulcasting a news/talk radio format branded as &quot;W Radio&quot;. XEW serves as the flagship for other &quot;W Radio&quot; stations around Mexico that carry some or all of its programs. The stations feature frequent news segments, talk and sports shows, with some music heard overnight and weekends.

XEW-AM is a Class A clear channel station broadcasting at 100,000 watts, one of the highest powered AM stations in North America. The non-directional antenna is off Avenida Independencia in the La Magdalena Atlicpac neighborhood in La Paz. XEW-FM is a Class C1 station with an effective radiated power (ERP) of 51,190 watts.

==History==
===XEW-AM===
XEW began regular broadcasts at 20:00 CST on . Broadcasting from a room (later to become a proper studio) at the Olympia Cinema on 16 September Street in Mexico City, it initially was powered at only 5,000 watts. This was increased to 50,000 watts by 1934. With the installation of a new transmitter, the power became 250 kW by 1935 and remained there for more than 80 years. For much of its history, XEW-AM the most powerful AM radio station in North America. On February 10, 2016, XEW-AM was approved to relocate its transmitter to a site in La Magdalena Atlicpac in La Paz. With the move, the power was reduced to 100,000 watts, still among North America&#x27;s most powerful AM stations.

XEW was the first Mexico City station in Emilio Azcarraga Vidaurreta&#x27;s &quot;Chain of the Americas.&quot; It was the forerunner to today&#x27;s Televisa network, whose radio unit still owns XEW-AM. XEW-AM originally was affiliated with the NBC Red Network and the NBC Blue Network. Its future sister stations would take affiliation with rival networks, XEQ-AM with CBS and XEX-AM with the Mutual Broadcasting System. As radio in Mexico evolved with the country&#x27;s growth and more radio stations signed on, XEW-AM became flagship to the country&#x27;s largest radio network. Several radio and television stations have derived their call signs from XEW radio and XEW television, all of them affiliated at one time or another with Televisa.

In the United States, the call letters for KXEW, a commercial AM radio station in Tucson, Arizona, were a tribute to 900 XEW. That station was owned by Pan American Radio Corporation and went on the air May 10, 1963. The call sign was chosen by its president and CEO, J. Carlos McCormick, because of his admiration of Azcarraga, whom he had met as a teenager during a 1950 visit to Mexico City.

=== XEW-FM ===
The FM frequency, 96.9, received its concession on April 28, 1962; it was not launched until the 1970s, and by the end of that decade, it carried a disco format. By 1981, it had changed to &quot;Rock Stereo&quot;. On September 9, 1985, it was renamed &quot;WFM&quot; with an English rock and pop format, being the direct competition of XHSON-FM (then known as &quot;Rock 101&quot;). Among the DJs that conformed the station were Alejandro González Iñárritu, Martha Debayle and Charo Fernández.

After 14 years, in 1999, the station changed its name and format to &quot;W Radical.&quot; It was directed by the former head of &quot;Rock 101&quot;, Luis Gerardo Salas, airing electronic music and eurodance. By 2001, it returned to its former WFM format with the slogan &quot;Frecuencia Adictiva.&quot; In late 2002, after the association of Televisa Radio and PRISA, management decided to simulcast the same programming on AM and FM. Thus XEW-FM became a news and talk outlet, albeit musical programming can still be heard on overnights and weekends when live sports broadcasts are not scheduled.

<text>Frederick Bartlett Fancher (April 2, 1852January 10, 1944) was an American politician who was the seventh governor of North Dakota from 1899 to 1901.

==Biography==

Frederick B. Fancher was born in Orleans County, New York, on April 2, 1852. Educated in the public schools, he also attended Michigan State Normal School in Ypsilanti, Michigan. He married Florence S. Van Voorhies. 

==Career==

Working in insurance in Illinois (where his office was destroyed in the Great Chicago Fire of 1871) and North Dakota, Fancher first entered politics and was President of the North Dakota Constitutional Convention in 1889. He had moved to North Dakota in 1881 and began a large farming operation near Jamestown. He was State Insurance Commissioner from 1895 to 1899 and a trustee board member of the State Hospital for the Insane.

Securing the Republican nomination, he was elected Governor and served from 1899 to January 10, 1901. While he was in that office, a state board of pardons, and a twine plant in the state penitentiary were established. Although renominated at the Republican convention, he withdrew due to ill health.

After leaving office, he moved to Sacramento, California and had a retail and wholesale grocery business until his retirement in 1925.

<text>George Throssell (23 May 1840 – 30 August 1910) was the second Premier of Western Australia. He served for just three months, from 15 February to 27 May 1901, during a period of great instability in Western Australian politics.

George Throssell was born at Fermoy, County Cork, Ireland, on 23 May 1840. The son of a Pensioner Guard, he came to Western Australia on board the &quot;Scindian&quot; in 1850 with his parents, and was educated at the Perth Public School. He began his own business as a produce merchant, &quot;Geo. Throssell &amp; Co.&quot;, in the town of Northam in 1861 and served as the Northam postmaster from 1864 to 1874. Throssell became owner of a flour mill, farms and a chain of shops; in 1885 his company became &quot;Throssell &amp; Son&quot; with the admission of his son Lionel, and the following year with the addition of W. J. Stewart, &quot;Throssell, Son &amp; Stewart&quot;. George was active in the Northam community; he was first elected to the Northam Municipal Council in 1880, of which he was chairman until 1883 and again from 1885 to 1887. He subsequently served as Mayor of Northam for broken periods until 1894. Throssell was popularly known as &quot;the lion of Northam&quot;, and was Northam&#x27;s first citizen in 1890 when was elected unopposed to the Legislative Assembly seat of Northam.

In 1897 Throssell joined Sir John Forrest&#x27;s government as Commissioner of Crown Lands, a key responsibility in a rapidly developing colony. When Forrest resigned as premier to join the federal parliament, Throssell took over as premier and treasurer on 15 February 1901. However, in the election of the following April, the &quot;ministerialists&quot; or former Forrest supporters failed to attain a majority of seats. On 27 May Throssell resigned as premier and as the leader of his group, but continued as MLA for Northam. He did not contest the 1904 election for health reasons, but returned to parliament in 1907 after winning a by-election for the Legislative Council&#x27;s East Province, the electoral region that included Northam. He served until his death on 30 August 1910.

George Throssell married Annie Morrell in 1861, and was the father of at least twelve children, one of whom was Captain Hugo Throssell VC. George Throssell was created a CMG in 1901.

<doc id="357135" wikidata="Q44005" url="?curid=357135" title="Cleomenes I">
<text>Cleomenes I (; Greek Κλεομένης; died c. 490 BC) was Agiad King of Sparta from c. 524 to c. 490 BC. One of the most important Spartan kings, Cleomenes was instrumental in organising the Greek resistance against the Persian Empire of Darius, as well as shaping the geopolitical balance of Classical Greece.

==Herodotus&#x27; account==
Most of the life of Cleomenes is known through the &quot;Histories&quot; of Herodotus, an Athenian historian of the second half of the 5th century. He is one the most important characters of books 5 and 6, covering the decades before the Persian Wars. Herodotus&#x27; account however contains many mistakes, especially on the chronology of several major events, and is also very biased against Cleomenes. It seems that Herodotus got his information on Cleomenes from his opponents: the descendants of his half-brothers Leonidas and Cleombrotus, as well as those of Demaratus, the other Spartan king who was deposed by Cleomenes in 491. Herodotus for instance states that Cleomenes&#x27; reign was short; however he ruled for about 30 years. Demaratus conversely receives positive treatment in the &quot;Histories&quot;, even though he betrayed to the Persians during the First Invasion of Greece. Paul Cartledge writes that Cleomenes suffered from a &quot;damnatio memoriae&quot; from the Spartans, notably for having corrupted the Oracle of Delphi in 491.

== Family background and accession ==
Cleomenes was the son of Anaxandridas II, who belonged to the Agiad dynasty, one of the two royal families of Sparta (the other being the Eurypontids). As his father did not have a son from his first wife (who was also his niece), the ephors forced him to marry another woman, without divorcing his first wife—an unprecedented occurrence of bigamy in Sparta. His new spouse likely came from the family of the ephor Chilon, an important reformer, who held office in during the mid-6th-century. Cleomenes was born from this second marriage, but then his father returned to his first wife and had three further sons with her: Dorieus, the future king Leonidas, and Cleombrotus—the latter two were possibly twins. The name Dorieus (&quot;the Dorian&quot;) explicitly refers to the Dorian ethnicity of Sparta, and might be a rejection of the ephor Chilon&#x27;s policy of establishing an amicable relationship with the ethnically different Achaia in the northern Peloponnese. 

The family of Anaxandridas&#x27; second wife immediately contested the legitimacy of Dorieus even before his birth, as the ephors attended his birth in order to certify the authenticity of the pregnancy. This shows that there were strong familial rivalries among Spartan royal circles; besides, at the same time, a cousin of Anaxandridas&#x27; second wife was also the bride of the future Eurypontid king Leotychidas. In turn, when his father died, Cleomenes&#x27; succession was contested by Dorieus, because of his superior &quot;manly virtue&quot;. Perhaps this statement is related to a great performance during the agoge—the rigorous military training at Sparta—which Dorieus had to endure, while Cleomenes avoided it as heir-apparent (the only possible exemption). Dorieus could have also contested Cleomenes&#x27; legitimacy on the ground that he was a son of the king&#x27;s first wife, who was additionally of royal descent. As Cleomenes was the eldest son, his claim was nevertheless deemed stronger and he became king. It prompted the departure of Dorieus to colonial ventures in Libya and Sicily, where he died in c.510.

The date of Cleomenes&#x27; accession had been debated among modern scholars for a long time, until historian David Harvey found that the Greek historian Diodoros of Sicily had confused the length of Cleomenes II&#x27;s reign (370–309) with that of his earlier namesake. Putting aside Diodoros&#x27; error, Harvey states that as Cleomenes came to the throne &quot;a few years earlier than the Plataia incident&quot;, he dates the start of his reign to 524–523.

== Reign ==
During the first years of his reign, Cleomenes adopted prudent diplomacy, rejecting foreign expeditions when solicited, possibly due to the threat of a helot revolt that a defeat in a war abroad would cause.
=== Encounter at Plataia (519 BC) ===
The first known deed of Cleomenes as king is his dealing with the city of Plataia, located between Thebes and Athens. In 519, Herodotus states that Cleomenes happened to be in the vicinity of Plataia, when the Plataians requested an alliance with Sparta, which he rejected. Instead he advised them to ally themselves with Athens, because he wanted to stir a border conflict between Thebes and Athens, two of the most powerful &quot;poleis&quot; of central Greece. The Plataians probably wished to avoid their forced incorporation into the Boiotian League, which was being built by Thebes at this time. Their Spartan alliance request perhaps indicates that they wanted to become a member of the Peloponnesian League, which was likewise being put in place at this time. G. E. M. de Ste. Croix and Paul Cartledge call this move &quot;a master-stroke&quot; of diplomacy, but other modern scholars do not believe it was Cleomenes&#x27; intention to create a rift between Thebes and Athens.

Herodotus does not explain why Cleomenes was near Plataia at that time. A number of theories have been advanced to explain it. Perhaps he was marching on Thebes to support an invasion of his ally, Lattamyas of Thessaly, but as the Thebans had defeated the Thessalians at the Battle of Ceressus before he arrived, he took the opportunity to try and undermine them without engaging his forces. Another possibility is that he was trying to convince either Megara or Thebes to join the Peloponnesian League, or he was arbitrating between Megara and Athens over the island of Salamis.

The date of this event has been challenged by some modern scholars, who have often suggested 509 rather than 519, as it would better fit with Cleomenes&#x27; latter involvement in Athenian politics, but the majority view remains in favour of 519.

=== Foreign embassies (c.517–c.513 BC) ===
In c.516, Cleomenes received an embassy from Maeandrius of Samos asking him for help to expel the tyrant Syloson, a puppet of the Persian Empire, which was at the time was subjugating the city-states of the eastern Aegean Sea. However, with the support of the ephors, Cleomenes refused and they expelled Maeandrius from the Peloponnese. Perhaps Cleomenes did not want to commit the Peloponnesian League to long-distance wars, especially against Persian Empire. Maeandrius&#x27; intentions may have also played a role, as he probably coveted the tyranny of Samos.

In about 513, Darius the Great invaded Scythia, which prompted the latter to send an embassy to Sparta in order to request an alliance against the Persians. Herodotus says the Scythians offered to go from the river Phasis to Media, while the Spartans would march east from Ephesus. This story is however suspect, as the Scythian ambassadors later resurfaced to explain the death of Cleomenes, and the proposed alliance looks like a Pan-Hellenic fantasy of Herodotus&#x27;. An alternative date of after 494 BC has been proposed, because the mention of Ephesus by Herodotus implies that the city was not under Persian control, which only happened after the Ionian Revolt of 499 – 494.

=== Interventions into Athenian politics (511–501 BC) ===
==== Sparta&#x27;s War against Hippias (c.511–510 BC) ====
In the 500s, Cleomenes meddled four times in Athenian politics, which ultimately led to the creation of democracy in Athens. The powerful, but exiled, Alcmaeonid family of Athens bribed the Oracle of Apollo at Delphi to tell the Spartans that they would not have access to the Oracle unless they removed the tyranny of the Peisistratid dynasty, who had held power in Athens since 561. The first Spartan expedition, headed by Anchimolus, took place in c.511, but was defeated by the tyrant Hippias, son of Pisistratus, thanks to the help he received from his Thessalian allies, who had sent a force of 1000 cavalrymen.

In 510, Sparta sent a bigger force commanded by Cleomenes, who went to Attica by land. The Spartans defeated the Thessalian mercenaries of Hippias, then besieged Hippias in the Acropolis, where he had sought shelter with his supporters. The tyrant surrendered after the Spartans captured his sons by chance; he then went into exile in the Persian Empire. The war against Hippias was consistent with the policy of removing tyrants followed by Sparta during the late 6th-century. Moreover, the tyrants of Athens were known for their Persian sympathies (called Medism), which Cleomenes started to vigorously fight throughout Greece at this time. Hippias was also a friend of Argos, another one of Sparta&#x27;s enemies. Embarrassed by owing the fall of the tyranny to the intervention of a Spartan king, the Athenians later promoted instead the story of Harmodius and Aristogeiton, who had murdered Hippias&#x27; brother Hipparchus in 514.

Another reason for the Spartan interventions in Athens may be the defection of Megara from the Peloponnesian League, perhaps at the instigation of Hippias. This would also be the reason why Anchimolus had to use ships to reach Attica, since the Isthmus of Corinth was cut off. Cleomenes then forced Megara back into the League in 511/510. Moreover, Plutarch mentions that at the time of Solon, Sparta acted as arbitrator between Athens and Megara for the ownership of Salamis, an island in the Saronic Gulf. But as Cleomenes is cited as one of the arbiters, several modern scholars place the settlement in c.510, just after the war, because Cleomenes finally decided in favour of Athens, probably to punish Megara for its defection, and also to bring Athens into the Peloponnesian League. This theory remains controversial as several other opinions place the Megara arbitration in c.519, at the same time as the Plataea incident.

==== Athenian Revolution (507 BC) ====
In Athens, a struggle took place between aristocratic factions headed by Cleisthenes and Isagoras for the control of the city. The pro-Spartan oligarch Isagoras became archon in 508/507, but Cleisthenes promised democratic reforms in order to gain greater support among the citizenry and expand his power-base. Now on the losing side, Isagoras called for help from his friend Cleomenes, whom it was rumoured was also in love with Isagoras&#x27; wife. Cleomenes obtained the exile of Cleisthenes through diplomacy, but Isagoras still felt unsafe, and requested intervention by his Spartan friend. Cleomenes personally came to Athens with a small bodyguard, possibly thinking that his prestige would be enough to change the political course of the city. Cleomenes expelled 700 families linked to Cleisthenes, and also wanted to establish a narrow oligarchy or a tyranny, by suppressing Athens&#x27; council (&quot;boule&quot;) and creating instead a new council of 300 men filled with Isagoras&#x27; supporters. However, the boule rejected the dissolution order; this act of resistance triggered a large revolt among the Athenians. Taken by surprise, Cleomenes and Isagoras sought shelter on the Acropolis, where they were besieged.

While stuck on the Acropolis, Cleomenes tried to enter the Old Temple of Athena Polias, but the priestess barred him access, saying that the temple was forbidden to Dorians—the ethnic group of the Spartans (Athenians were Ionians). Cleomenes likely wanted to show his strength by making a sacrifice in a forbidden place, which was a typical behaviour for conquerors and notably Spartan commanders. Even though the priestess of Athena was the most important cleric in Athens, Herodotus chose not to give her name in order to make her speak as the goddess resisting the Spartan invasion. Cleomenes famously replied: &quot;Woman, I am not Dorian but Achaean&quot;. In this context, the Achaeans were the Greeks of Homer&#x27;s poems. The name recalls the ephor Chilon&#x27;s policy of appropriating their heritage in the middle of the 6th-century. A descendant of Chilon, Cleomenes therefore attempted to present himself as less alien to the Athenians by claiming an Achaean identity. His reply to the priestess also conveys a second meaning, as it can be translated by &quot;I am not Dorieus&quot;, the name of his rival half-brother.

In the third day of the siege, Cleomenes realised that his position was hopeless, and negotiated a surrender: the Spartans were allowed to leave with Isagoras, but the supporters of the latter were massacred.

==== Boeotian War (506 BC) ====
Revengeful after the humiliation he suffered, Cleomenes set up a large coalition against Athens, gathering the Peloponnesian League, Boeotia, and Chalkis (on the island of Euboea), which pushed Athens to seek an alliance with Persia—another reason for Cleomenes&#x27; intervention. The goal was again to install Isagoras as tyrant. However, once the Peloponnesian army arrived at Eleusis in Western Attica, the Corinthians refused to continue and returned home. Demaratus, the Eurypontid king, similarly disagreed with Cleomenes and took the rest of the allies with him back to the Peloponnese, thus effectively calling off the invasion. As a result, the Athenians easily defeated the Boeotians, then Chalkis. The most frequent explanation for the Corinthians&#x27; decision is that they ignored Cleomenes&#x27; plan to install a tyrant in Athens; they thought would be an unjust act once they learned about it. 

Several modern historians find this change of mood unconvincing and have offered alternative theories. Lawrence Tritle has suggested instead that after Cleomenes retreated from the Acropolis, he captured Eleusis and left Isagoras in charge there until his return with the full army. The following year, the Spartans and their allies discovered at Eleusis that Athens had retaken this city; without a secure base in Attica, the whole expedition appeared hopeless and was cancelled. Simon Hornblower thinks that the Peloponnesians only learned about the alliance between Athens and Persia once they reached Eleusis, and they did not want to go to war with the latter.

While near Eleusis, Cleomenes may have destroyed some trees in the sacred area of the city, probably for military reasons.

This failed invasion had several consequences. Firstly, a law was passed in Sparta forbidding the two kings to go on campaign at the same time, in order to avoid another dangerous disagreement on the field. Secondly, the organisation of the Peloponnesian League was considerably amended. Sparta had to concede its allies the creation of a League congress, in which the allies could vote on declaring war and making peace.

A few years later, possibly in 504, the first recorded congress of the Peloponnesian League took place in Sparta, during which the restoration of Hippias to Athens was debated. The Spartans wished to restore him because they said they had been tricked by the false oracles of the Alcmeonids, which prompted the removal of Hippias in 510. Hippias was present and pleaded his cause in Sparta, but the allies led by Corinth rejected the proposal. Hippias then left Greece for good, perhaps to the island of Chios. Although some scholars have assumed this reversal of Sparta&#x27;s foreign policy was Cleomenes&#x27; doing, it seems that he played no part in this, because Herodotus does not mention him at all. Ste.Croix instead writes that Sparta&#x27;s support of Hippias came from Cleomenes&#x27; opponents in the city, who considered the new regime in Athens to be more hostile to Sparta than Hippias.

=== The Ionian Revolt and its Aftermath ===
In 499, Aristagoras, the tyrant of Miletus, came to Sparta to request help from King Cleomenes with the Ionian Revolt against Persia. Aristagoras nearly persuaded Cleomenes to help, promising an easy conquest of Persia and its riches, but Cleomenes sent him away when he learned about the long distance to the heart of Persia. Aristagoras attempted to bribe him by offering silver. Cleomenes declined, so Aristagoras began offering him more and more. According to Herodotus, once Aristagoras offered Cleomenes 50 talents of silver, Cleomenes&#x27;s young daughter Gorgo warned him not to trust a man who threatened to corrupt him.

=== War against Argos (494 BC) ===
In 494, a fifty years&#x27; peace that had been signed between Sparta and Argos expired, leading to a new war. This peace had been possibly concluded after a Spartan victory for the control the Thyreatis, the border area between the two cities, won by Anaxandridas II. Cleomenes&#x27; motivations may have been either to weaken a rival in the Peloponnese, or to punish Argos for its Medism. The campaign only involved Sparta, not the Peloponnesian League, and perhaps only Spartian citizens, without the perioeci who usually fought alongside them in battle. They were at least 2,000 Spartan soldiers, with an equal number of helots.

The Spartan army marched north through the Perioecic city of Sellasia, then Tegea, whence they moved north-east towards Argos. The Argives however blocked the way at the river Erasinos. Cleomenes returned south to the Thyreatis, within Spartan territory, in order to board his troops into ships lent by Sikyon and Aegina, two members of the Peloponnesian League. The ships landed on the other side of the Argolic Gulf, at Tiryns and Nauplia, two subject cities of Argos. A large pitched battle took place at Sepeia, near Tiryns, where the entire Argive army was wiped out, perhaps up to 6,000 men. Ste.Croix thinks the battle was &quot;the greatest slaughter of hoplites [...] in any war between two Greek states&quot;. The survivors fled to a sacred ground nearby, but Cleomenes put the grove on fire and killed the Argives. He then dismissed most of his army but a thousand soldiers and moved to Mycenae, in the northeast of Argos. On his way, he stopped at the Heraion of Argos, the great temple of Hera, where he committed another sacrilege by flogging the priest who tried to prevent him from performing a sacrifice in the temple. In both cases, Cleomenes had ordered his accompanying helots to commit the sacrileges, probably to shield the Spartiates from the religious consequences.

Cleomenes remained in the vicinity of Argos in the aftermath of the battle in order to create two independent city-states out of Tiryns and Mycenae, thus cutting Argos&#x27; access to its best harbour at Nauplia. The reason behind this move was to durably weaken Argos, and possibly to hinder it from receiving troops from Persia. Mycenae and Tiryns joined the Peloponnesian League and remained good allies of Sparta. Despite his crushing victory against Argos, Cleomenes did not try to capture the city, possibly because its defences were too strong, or he failed to install a friendly government. On his return to Sparta, Cleomenes was accused of bribery before the ephors for having spared Argos after the battle. A trial took place before the Gerousia or the ecclesia. Cleomenes explained that after having taken the sacred grove of Argos, the oracle&#x27;s forecast regarding the capture of Argos had been fulfilled—since they shared the same name, and was therefore acquitted.

=== Deposition of Demaratus (491 BC) ===
When the Persians invaded Greece after putting down the Ionian revolt in 493, many city-states quickly submitted to them fearing a loss of trade. Among these states was Aegina. So in 491, Cleomenes attempted to arrest the major collaborators there. The citizens of Aegina would not cooperate with him and the Eurypontid Spartan king, Demaratus attempted to undermine his efforts. Cleomenes overthrew Demaratus, after first bribing the oracle at Delphi to announce that this was the divine will, and replaced him with Leotychidas.

== Exile and death ==
Around 490 Cleomenes was forced to flee Sparta when his plot against his co-king Demaratus was discovered. Herodotus states that he first went to Thessaly, but such a large detour is implausible, and Herodotus&#x27; manuscript has often been corrected to &quot;Sellasia&quot;, which was a Perioecic city north of Sparta. Sellasia was still too close to Sparta, and Cleomenes moved to Arcadia.

=== Rebellion in Arcadia (c.490 BC) ===
Arcadia was the central region of the Peloponnese; it counted many small cities that Sparta had always prevented from uniting, applying a divide and rule policy. Upon his arrival in c.490, Cleomenes wanted to unite the Arcadians and requested them to swear the oath of &quot;following him withersoever he might lead&quot;. This oath was a paraphrase of the oath of the Peloponnesian League, so it seems that Cleomenes tried to make them shift their allegiance from Sparta to himself, then turn against Sparta at the head of a personal union with the Arcadians. He might have promised them that if they helped him to regain his place in Sparta, he would recognise Arcadia as a single political unit. According to Herodotus, the oath would have been taken in the city of Nonacris, by the Styx—the river of the Underworld, where normally only gods swore oaths—therefore making Cleomenes commit another sacrilege and suffering from &quot;divine megalomania&quot;.

Based on Arcadian coins produced in the first half of the 5th century, several historians have even considered that Cleomenes created the first Arcadian League, whereas this federal structure only appear in ancient sources after the Spartan defeat at Leuctra in 371. However, more recent studies have shown that this coinage was probably not political, but connected to the festival of Zeus Lykaios, and that Cleomenes never completed his plans in Arcadia. The wording in Herodotus implies that the oath by the Styx was never taken.

=== Revolt of the helots ===
The Spartans arrived late at the battle of Marathon against Persia in 490. Their official explanation was that they had to finish a religious festival, but the philosopher Plato mentioned that it was caused by a revolt of the helots in Messenia, which several historians have linked to the activities of Cleomenes against Sparta at the time. Cleomenes could have promised the helots an improvement of their condition in exchange for help, as did his nephew the regent Pausanias a few years later. In support of this theory, the city of Messena in Sicily, was founded in c.488 by refugees from Messenia, and the Spartans made a dedication at Olympia after a victory against the Messenians at the beginning of the 5th century. Facing the threat of a combined revolt from Arcadia and Messenia, the Spartan authorities, notably the ephors, recalled Cleomenes to Sparta.

=== Return to Sparta and death ===
However, according to Herodotus Cleomenes was by this time considered to be insane. The Spartans, fearing what he was capable of put him in prison. By the command of his half-brothers, Leonidas I and Cleombrotus, Cleomenes was placed in chains. He died in prison in mysterious circumstances, with the Spartan authorities claiming his death was suicide due to insanity.

While in prison, Cleomenes was found dead with his death being ruled as suicide by self-mutilation. He apparently convinced the helot guarding him into giving him a knife, with which he slashed his shins, thighs and belly in an especially brutal suicide. He was succeeded by the elder of his surviving half-brothers Leonidas I, who then married Cleomenes&#x27; daughter Gorgo.

Herodotus gives four different versions that circulated in Greece to explain Cleomenes&#x27; madness and suicide. The most common one was that of divine retribution for having bribed the Oracle of Delphi. Alternatively, the Argives said it was for the massacre of the Argive soldiers cornered in their sacred grove after the battle of Sepeia; the Athenians thought it was for his sacrilege of the groves of Eleusis; the Spartans suggested that the wine he drank unmixed with water—a taste he acquired from the Scythian ambassadors who visited him in 514—turned him insane. For Herodotus, Cleomenes paid for his removal of Demaratus. The Athenians&#x27; and Argives&#x27; versions were coined to suit their own grief against Cleomenes, whereas the Spartan version was designed to absolve Sparta from any accusation of impiety.

The suicide of Cleomenes has appeared suspect to modern scholars, who instead consider the possibility that he was murdered by his half-brother Leonidas, who was next in line. Cleomenes&#x27; daughter, Gorgo, seems to have transmitted to Herodotus the Spartan &quot;official version&quot; of her father&#x27;s death, to which she might have participated as she was married to Leonidas.

<text>Behram Kurşunoğlu (14 March 1922 – 25 October 2003) was a Turkish physicist and the founder and the director of the Center for Theoretical Studies, University of Miami. He was best known for his works on unified field theory, energy and global issues.

He participated in the discovery of two different types of neutrinos in late 1950s. During his University of Miami career, he hosted several Nobel Prize laureates, including Paul Dirac, Lars Onsager and Robert Hofstadter. He wrote several books on diverse aspects of physics, the most notable of which is &quot;Modern Quantum Theory&quot; (1962).

==Early life and education==
Behram Kurşunoğlu was born in Çaykara district of Trabzon. While he was a third year student in the Department of Mathematics and Astronomy of İstanbul Yüksek Öğretmen Okulu, he was sent to University of Edinburgh through a scholarship of the Turkish Ministry of Education, in 1945.

After graduating from the University of Edinburgh, he completed his doctorate degree in physics at the University of Cambridge. During the period of 1956–1958, he served as the dean of the Faculty of Nuclear Sciences and Technology at Middle East Technical University and a counselor to the office of Turkish General Staff. He held teaching positions at several universities in the United States, and starting from 1958, professorship at the University of Miami.

==Career==
===University of Miami===
In 1965, he acted as one of the founders of the Center for Theoretical Studies of the University of Miami, of which he became the first director. During this period, he also worked in counseling positions for several research organizations and laboratories in Europe. With the invitation of Russian Academy of Sciences, he worked as a visiting professor in the USSR during 1968.

He continued his work at the Center for Theoretical Studies of the University of Miami until 1992, after which he became the director of the Global Foundation research organization.

Kursunoglu died on October 25, 2003, due to heart attack, shortly before that year&#x27;s Coral Gables Conference, which was a festschrift for Paul Frampton combined with a memorial for Kursunoglu in a conference series he had been organizing since 1964. He had three children, İsmet, Sevil and Ayda, from his wife Sevda Arif.

<text>A portable hyperbaric bag, of which one brand is the Gamow () bag, is an inflatable pressure bag large enough to accommodate a person. The patient can be placed inside the bag, which is then sealed and inflated with a foot pump. Within minutes, the effective altitude can be decreased by 1000 m to as much as 3000 m (3281 to 9743 feet) depending on the elevation. The bag is pressurised to ; the pressure gradient is regulated by pop-off valves set to the target pressure. 

==History==
The Gamow bag was named after its inventor, Igor Gamow, son of George Gamow. Igor Gamow originally designed a predecessor to the Gamow bag called &quot;The Bubble&quot; to study the effect of high altitude on stamina and performance in athletes. Gamow later re-designed &quot;The Bubble&quot; into a bag that could be used in high-altitude wilderness.

== Application ==
It is primarily used for treating severe cases of altitude sickness, high-altitude cerebral edema, and high-altitude pulmonary edema. Like office-based hyperbaric medicine, the Gamow bag uses increased partial pressure of oxygen for therapy of hypobaric injury but has the advantage of portability for field use. Patients typically are treated in 1-hour increments and then are reevaluated.

<text>Chernivtsi Oblast (), also referred to as Chernivechchyna (), is an oblast (province) in western Ukraine, consisting of the northern parts of the historical regions of Bukovina and Bessarabia. It has an international border with Romania and Moldova. The region spans . The oblast is the smallest in Ukraine both by area and population. It has a population of and its administrative center is the city of Chernivtsi.

In 1408, Chernivtsi was a town in Moldavia and the chief centre of the area known as Bukovina. Chernivtsi later passed to the Turks and then in 1774 to the Habsburg monarchy. After World War I, it was ceded to Romania, and in 1940, the town was acquired by the Ukrainian SSR.

The oblast has a large variety of landforms: the Carpathian Mountains and picturesque hills at the foot of the mountains gradually change to a broad partly forested plain situated between the Dniester and Prut rivers.

== Geography ==
Chernivtsi Oblast covers an area of . It is the smallest oblast in Ukraine, representing 1.3% of Ukrainian territory, and is only larger than the city of Kyiv itself.

In the oblast there are 75 rivers longer than 10 kilometers. The largest rivers are the Dniester (290 km, in the Oblast), Prut (128 km, in the Oblast) and Siret (113 km, in the Oblast).

The oblast covers three geographic zones: a forest steppe region between Prut and Dnister rivers, a foothill region between the Carpathian Mountains and Prut river, and a mountain region known as the Bukovinian part of the Carpathian Mountains.

Chernivtsi Oblast is bordered by Ivano-Frankivsk Oblast, Ternopil Oblast, Khmelnytskyi Oblast, Vinnytsia Oblast, Romania, and Moldova. Within the oblast the national border of Ukraine with Romania extends 226 km, and with Moldova .

==History==
Chernivtsi oblast was created on August 7, 1940, in the wake of the Soviet occupation of Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina. The oblast was organized out of the northeast part of Ținutul Suceava of Kingdom of Romania, joining parts of three historical regions: northern half of Bukovina, northern half of the Hotin County county of Bessarabia, and Hertsa region, which was part of the Dorohoi county (presently Botoșani County) of proper Moldavia.

Archaeological sites in the region date back to 43,000-45,000 BC, with finds including a mammoth bone dwelling from the Middle Paleolithic. The Cucuteni-Trypillian culture flourished in the area. In the Middle Ages, the region was inhabited by East Slavic tribes White Croats and Tivertsi. From the end of the 10th century, it became a part of the Kievan Rus&#x27;, then Principality of Halych, and in the mid-14th century of the Principality of Moldavia (which in the 16th century became a vassal of the Ottoman Empire). In 1775, two counties of Moldavia, since then known as Bukovina, were annexed by the Habsburg monarchy as part of the Austrian Empire and its final iteration Austria-Hungary. In 1812, one half of Moldavia, since then known as Bessarabia, was annexed by the Russian Empire. Hertsa region remained in Moldavia until its union with Wallachia in 1859, a union which in 1881 became the Kingdom of Romania. In 1918 both provinces of Bukovina and Bessarabia united with the Kingdom of Romania.

The Soviet occupation began on June 28, 1940. In addition to Bessarabia, the USSR demanded Northern Bukovina as compensation for the occupation of Bessarabia by Romania from 1918 to 1940. Hertsa region was not included in the demands that the Soviet Union addressed to Romania, but was occupied at the same time. Most of the occupied territories were organized on August 2, 1940, as the Moldavian Soviet Socialist Republic, while the remainder, including the Chenivtsi Oblast, which was formed on August 7, 1940, were included in the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic.

Throughout 1940–1941 several tens of thousands of Bukovinians were deported to Siberia and Kazakhstan, some 13,000 of them on June 13, 1941, alone. This and later deportations were primarily based on social class difference, it targeted intellectuals, people employed previously by the state, businessmen, clergymen, students, railworkers. The majority of those targeted were ethnic Romanians, but there were many representatives of other ethnicities, as well. The protests of the Romanian population of Bukovina that found themselves under the Soviet rule brought about serious Soviet reprisals, including of ethnic character. In the winter and spring of 1941, the Soviet troops (NKVD) opened fire on many groups of locals trying to cross the border into Romania (for more, see: Lunca massacre and Fântâna Albă massacre).

Between September 17 and November 17, 1940, by a mutual agreement between USSR and Germany, 43,641 &quot;ethnic Germans&quot; from the Chernivtsi region were moved to Germany, although the total ethnic German population was only 34,500, and of these some 3,500 did not go to Germany. Upon their arrival in Germany, the Nazi government sent most of non-ethnic Germans to concentration camps. Only some of them were freed after the protests of the Romanian government.

During World War II, when the region returned under the control of the Romanian administration, the Jewish community of the area was largely destroyed by the deportations to ghettos and Nazi concentration camps, where about 60% died. Despite the anti-Semitic policies of the Ion Antonescu&#x27;s government of Romania, the mayor of Cernăuți, Traian Popovici, now honored by Israel&#x27;s Yad Vashem memorial as one of the Righteous Among the Nations, saved approximately 20,000 Jews.

In 1944, when the Soviet troops returned to Bukovina, many inhabitants fled to Romania, and Soviet persecutions resumed, with the result that the region was seriously depopulated. In demographic terms, these war-time and post-war-time factors changed the region&#x27;s ethnic composition. Today the number of Jews, Germans and Poles is negligible, while the number of Romanians has decreased substantially.

Ruthenian communities in Bukovina date back to at least 16th century. In 1775, Ukrainians (Ruthenians) represented some 8,000 out of a 75,000 population of Bukovina. By 1918, as a result of immigration of Ukrainian peasants from nearby villages in Galicia and Podolia, there were over 200,000 Ukrainians, out of a total of 730,000. Most of Ukrainians settled in the northern parts of Bukovina. Their number was especially large in the area between the Dniester and Prut rivers, where they became a majority. A similar process occurred in Northern Bessarabia. Throughout the history of the region, there were no inter-ethnic clashes, while the city of Chernivtsi was known for its German-style architecture, for a highly cultivated society, and for ethnic tolerance. Small ethnic disputes were, however, present on occasion. In 1918, many Ukrainians in Bukovina wanted to join an independent Ukrainian state. After an initial period of free education in Ukrainian language, in late 1920s Romanian authorities attempted to switch all education to the Romanian language. In 1940–1941, the Soviet reprisals were more massive in the parts of the Chernivtsi oblast were Romanians predominated; when, however, after 1944, Ukrainian anti-Soviet resistance rose up, Romanians and Ukrainians fought alongside against NKVD.

Many Ukrainians in the south-western mountain area of the Chernivtsi region belong to the Hutsul ethnic sub-group, a sophisticated cultural community inhabiting an area in the Carpathian Mountains in both Ukraine and Romania.

When the Soviet Union collapsed, Chernivtsi Oblast, then part of the Ukrainian SSR, became part of the newly independent (August 24, 1991) Ukraine. It has a Ukrainian ethnic majority. In the referendum on December 1, 1991, 92% of the oblast&#x27;s residents supported the independence of Ukraine, with wide support from both Ukrainians and Romanians.

== Subdivisions ==

Since July 2020, Chernivtsi Oblast is administratively subdivided into 3 &quot;raions&quot; (districts). These are

*Chernivtsi Raion;
*Dnistrovskyi Raion;
*Vyzhnytsia Raion.

At the locality level, the territory of the oblast is divided among 11 cities, 8 urban-type settlements, and 252 communes.

==Population and demographics==

According to the latest Ukrainian Census (2001), Ukrainians represent 74.98% (689,056) of the population of Chernivtsi Oblast out of 919,028 inhabitants. Moreover, 12.46% (114,555) reported themselves as Romanians, 7.31% (67,225) as Moldovans, and 4.12% (37,881) as Russians. The other nationalities, such as Poles, Belarusians, and Jews sum up to 1.2%. According to the 2001 census, the majority of the population of the Chernivtsi region was Ukrainian-speaking (75.57%), and there were also Romanian (18.64%) and Russian (5.27%) speakers. In the last Soviet census of 1989, out of 940,801 inhabitants, 666,095 declared themselves Ukrainians (70.8%), 100,317 Romanians (10.66%), 84,519 Moldovans (8.98%), and 63,066 Russians (6.7%). The decline in the number (from 84,519 to 67,225) and proportion of Moldovans (from 8.98% to 7.31%) was explained by a switch from a census Moldovan to a census Romanian ethnic identity, and has continued after the 2001 census. By contrast, the number of self-identified ethnic Romanians has increased and so has their proportion of the population of the oblast (from 10.66% to 12.46%), and the process has continued after the 2001 census.

A 2015 survey found that 86% of respondents ascribed to the Orthodox church while 2% ascribed to Greek Catholic. Another 5% was &quot;unspecified Christian.&quot;

The use of separate categories for the Moldovans and Romanians, as well as for the Moldovan and Romanian languages in the Ukrainian census has been criticized by various Romanian organizations in Ukraine, including the Romanian Community of Ukraine Interregional Union. Furthermore, it was alleged that individuals, especially, but not exclusively, in the Odessa region were threatened with dismissal from their jobs if they declared that they were &quot;Romanians&quot; rather than &quot;Moldovans&quot;, and it was also claimed that the ethnicity of some individuals was listed arbitrarily by census-takers who did not even ask those individuals what their ethnicity was. Nevertheless, all census respondents had to write in their ethnicity (no predetermined set of choices existed), and could respond or not to any particular census question, or not answer any questions at all. 

According to Kateryna Sheshtakova, a professor at the Pomeranian University of Slutsk in Poland who did field research among 15 self-identified Romanians and self-identified Moldovans in the Chernivtsi region of Ukraine, &#x27;Some Moldovans use both names of the mother tongue (Moldovan or Romanian) and accordingly declare two ethnic affiliations.&#x27; Opinion polling from the Chernivtsi oblast, as well as the discussions of the delegates of the Meeting of the Leaders of the Romanophone Organizations from Ukraine of December 6, 1996, indicated that many of the self-identified Moldovans believed that the Moldovan and Romanian languages were identical. Shestakova suggests that those self-identified Moldovans who see differences between Moldovan and Romanian tend to be from &quot;the older generation&quot;. More information on the Romanian identity population and Moldovan identity population in Ukraine, including in the Chernivtsi oblast, and including detailed statistical data, may be found in the articles Romanians in Ukraine, Moldovans in Ukraine and Moldovenism.

According to the Romanian census of 1930, the territory of the future &quot;Chernivtsi Oblast&quot; had 805,642 inhabitants in that year, out of which 47.6% were Ukrainians, and 28.2% were Romanians. The rest of the population was 88,772 Jews, 46,946 Russians (among them an important community of Lipovans), around 35,000 Germans, 10,000 Poles, and 10,000 Hungarians.

During the inter-war period, Cernăuți County had a population of 306,975, of which 136,380 were Ukrainians, and 78,589 were Romanians. Storojineţ County had 77,382 Ukrainians and 57,595 Romanians. (The three other counties of Bukovina, which remained in Romania, had a total of 22,368 Ukrainians). The northern part of the Hotin County had approximately 70% Ukrainians and 25% Romanians. The Hertsa region, smaller by area and population, was virtually 100% Romanian.

Major demographic changes occurred during the Second World War. Immediate after the Soviet takeover of the region in 1940 the Soviet government deported or killed about 41,000 Romanians (&quot;see Fântâna Albă massacre&quot;), while at the same time further encouraging an influx of Ukrainians from the Ukrainian SSR. Most Poles were deported by the Soviet authorities, while most Germans forcibly returned to Germany. After the Kingdom of Romania took control of the region during the war (1941–1944), the Jewish community of the area was largely destroyed by the deportations to ghettos and concentration camps.

The languages of the population closely reflect the ethnic composition with over 90% within each of the major ethnic groups declaring their national language as the mother tongue.

<doc id="357153" wikidata="Q449728" url="?curid=357153" title="Anissa Jones">
<text>Mary Anissa Jones (March 11, 1958 – August 28, 1976) was an American child actress known for her role as Buffy Davis on the CBS sitcom &quot;Family Affair&quot;, which ran from 1966 to 1971. She died from a drug overdose when she was 18.

==Early life==

Jones was born in West Lafayette, Indiana, in 1958 and was raised in Charleston, West Virginia, until the age of 5. Her maternal grandparents were Lebanese and Jones&#x27; middle name is used by Lebanese Maronites instead of Agnes, because it derives from Persian Anahid, Anahit or Anaïs, meaning immaculate. Her parents were divorced before her acting career began in 1965.

At the time of her birth, Jones&#x27; father, John Paul Jones, was an engineering graduate and faculty board member at Purdue University, where her mother, Mary Paula Jones (&quot;née&quot; Tweel), was a zoology student. Soon after the 1960 birth of Anissa&#x27;s brother John Paul Jones Jr. (called &quot;Paul&quot; by the family), the family moved to Playa Del Rey, California, where John Paul Sr. took a job in aerospace engineering and Anissa attended Paseo del Rey Elementary School, then Orville Wright Junior High School.

==Career==
In 1964, when she was 6, Jones&#x27; first TV appearance was in a commercial. Two years later, 8-year-old Jones, who was small for her age, was cast as 6-year-old Ava Elizabeth &quot;Buffy&quot; Patterson-Davis on the CBS sitcom &quot;Family Affair&quot; (1966). In the sitcom, Buffy, her twin brother Jody (Johnny Whitaker), and older sister Cissy (Kathy Garver) are sent to live with their Uncle Bill (Brian Keith) and his valet Mr. French (Sebastian Cabot) a year after the children&#x27;s parents die in a car accident (the DVD collection notes mistakenly state &quot;plane accident&quot;). In 1969, at the height of her juvenile pop cultural celebrity and of &quot;Family Affair&quot;&#x27;s television ratings success, Jones made her only film appearance with a small role in &quot;The Trouble with Girls&quot;, which starred Elvis Presley. She also made one crossover appearance as Buffy on the short-lived series &quot;To Rome with Love&quot; in 1970. Jones was 12 when &quot;Family Affair&quot; ended in 1971; she did not work in film or TV thereafter.

==Death==
Shortly before noon on August 28, 1976, after partying in the beach town of Oceanside, California, with her new boyfriend and others the night before, Jones, 18, was found dead in an upstairs bedroom of a house belonging to the father of a 14-year-old friend. Others at the party ranged in age from 12 to 22, as police later determined. The coroner&#x27;s report listed Jones&#x27; death as a drug overdose, later ruled accidental.

Jones was given a small, private service. She was cremated and her ashes were scattered over the Pacific Ocean. She left $63,000 in cash and more than $100,000 in savings bonds when she died ($163,000 1976 dollars equivalent to roughly $910,000 in 2025 dollars). 
=== Investigation ===
Dr. Don Carlos Moshos had prescribed Seconal, a barbiturate, to Jones; an investigation about his professional practices had already begun as a separate unrelated matter prior to Jones&#x27; death. Occupants in the same building as Moshos&#x27; office had reported the unusual activity of patients waiting in long lines outside of his practice. According to a Torrance Police Department report, Moshos was writing over 100 prescriptions per day. A KABC local news team visited his office and found it filled with young people, some of whom had been waiting over three hours to be seen by Moshos. Wayne Staz, the reporter who initiated the visit, alleged that prescriptions could be obtained with $5.00 and &quot;simply showing identification&quot;.

Six days after Jones&#x27; death, Moshos was arrested at his office in Torrance and charged with illegally prescribing Seconal to Jones, among other drugs-for-profit charges from a concurrent undercover criminal investigation. An envelope with Moshos&#x27; business address was present at Jones&#x27; scene of death, specifying a drug found in Anissa&#x27;s toxicology report (Seconal), its dosage (1½ grains), quantity (50), and the recipient&#x27;s last name (Jones). Moshos was charged with 11 offenses, but was admitted to a hospital on December 6 with hepatitis (while also suffering from diabetes, high blood pressure and advancing senility) and died on December 27, 1976, four months after Jones. Although the murder charges were dropped before his death, Moshos&#x27; estate was sued by Jones&#x27; surviving family for $400,000; in July 1979, the verdict found him 30% liable and Jones 70% responsible for her death, and the resulting judgment was reduced to $79,500 ($ adjusted ).

== Family ==
On March 15, 1984, Jones&#x27; brother, Paul, died of a drug overdose. He was 24.

<text>Airmail (or air mail) is a mail transport service branded and sold on the basis of at least one leg of its journey being by air. Airmail items typically arrive more quickly than surface mail, and usually cost more to send. Airmail may be the only option for sending mail to some destinations, such as overseas, if the mail cannot wait the time it would take to arrive by ship, sometimes weeks. The Universal Postal Union adopted comprehensive rules for airmail at its 1929 Postal Union Congress in London. Since the official language of the Universal Postal Union is French, airmail items worldwide are often marked Par avion, literally: &quot;by airplane&quot;.

For about the first half century of its existence, transportation of mail via aircraft was usually categorized and sold as a separate service (airmail) from surface mail. Today it is often the case that mail service is categorized and sold according to transit time alone, with mode of transport (land, sea, air) being decided on the back end in dynamic intermodal combinations. Thus even &quot;regular&quot; mail may make part of its journey on an aircraft. Such &quot;air-speeded&quot; mail is different from nominal airmail in its branding, price, and priority of service.

==History==

===Early airmails===

Specific instances of a letter being delivered by air long predate the introduction of Airmail as a regularly scheduled service available to the general public.

Although homing pigeons had long been used to send messages (an activity known as pigeon mail), the first mail to be carried by an air vehicle was on January 7, 1785, on a hot air balloon flight from Dover to France near Calais. It was flown by Jean-Pierre Blanchard and John Jeffries. The letter was written by an American Loyalist William Franklin to his son William Temple Franklin who was serving in a diplomatic role in Paris with his grandfather Benjamin Franklin.

During the first aerial flight in North America by balloon on January 9, 1793, from Philadelphia to Deptford, New Jersey, Jean-Pierre Blanchard carried a personal letter from George Washington to be delivered to the owner of whatever property Blanchard happened to land on, making the flight the first delivery of air mail in the United States. The first official air mail delivery in the United States took place on August 17, 1859, when John Wise piloted a balloon starting in Lafayette, Indiana, with a destination of New York. Weather issues forced him to land near Crawfordsville, Indiana, and the mail reached its final destination via train. In 1959, the U.S. Postal Service issued a 7 cent stamp commemorating the event.

Balloons also carried mail out of Paris and Metz during the Franco-Prussian War (1870), drifting over the heads of the Germans besieging those cities. Balloon mail was also carried on an 1877 flight in Nashville, Tennessee.

==Introduction of the aeroplane==
Starting in 1903 the introduction of the aeroplane generated immediate interest in using them for mail transport. An unofficial airmail flight was conducted by Fred Wiseman, who carried three letters between Petaluma and Santa Rosa, California, on February 17, 1911.
The world&#x27;s first official airmail flight came the next day, at a large exhibition in the United Provinces of Agra and Oudh, British India. The organizer of the aviation display, Sir Walter Windham, was able to secure permission from the postmaster general in India to operate an airmail service in order to generate publicity for the exhibition and to raise money for charity. Mail from people across the region was gathered in at Holy Trinity Church and the first airmail flight was piloted by Henri Pequet, who flew 6,500 letters a distance of from Allahabad to Naini—the nearest station on the Bombay-Calcutta line to the exhibition. The letters bore an official frank &quot;First Aerial Post, U.P. Exhibition, Allahabad. 1911&quot;. The aircraft used was a Humber-Sommer biplane, and it made the journey in thirteen minutes.

The first official American airmail delivery was made on September 23, 1911, by pilot Earle Ovington under the authority of the United States Post Office Department.

The first official air mail in Australia was carried by French pilot Maurice Guillaux. On July 16–18, 1914, he flew his Blériot XI aircraft from Melbourne to Sydney, a distance of 584 miles (940 km), carrying 1785 specially printed postcards, some Lipton&#x27;s Tea and some O.T. Lemon juice. At the time, this was the longest such flight in the world.

===Scheduled services===
The world&#x27;s first scheduled airmail post service took place in the United Kingdom between the London suburb of Hendon, North London, and the Postmaster General&#x27;s office in Windsor, Berkshire, on September 9, 1911, as part of the celebrations for King George V&#x27;s coronation and at the suggestion of Sir Walter Windham, who based his proposal on the successful experiment he had overseen in India.
The service ran for just under a month, transporting 35 bags of mail in 16 flights; four pilots operated the aircraft including Gustav Hamel, who flew the first service in his Blériot, covering the 21 miles between Hendon and Windsor in just 18 minutes. The service was eventually terminated due to constant and severe delays caused by bad weather conditions. Similar services were intermittently run in other countries before the war, including in Germany, France and Japan, where airmail provision was briefly established in 1912, only to meet with similar practical difficulties.

The range, speed and lifting capacity of aircraft were transformed through technological innovation during the war, allowing the first practical air mail services to finally become a reality when the war ended. For instance, the first regularly scheduled airmail service in the United States was inaugurated on May 15, 1918. The route, which ran between Washington, D.C., and New York City, with an intermediate stop in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, was designed by aviation pioneer Augustus Post. The field used for this service is marked by a plaque in West Potomac Park. In 1925, the U.S. Postal service issued contracts to fly airmail between designated points. By 1931, 85% of domestic airline revenue was from airmail.

In Germany, dirigibles of the 1920s and 1930s were used extensively to carry airmail; it was known as Zeppelin mail, or dirigible mail. The German Zeppelins were especially visible in this role, and many countries issued special stamps for use on Zeppelin mail.

The 1928 book &quot;So Disdained&quot; by Nevil Shute—a novel based on this author&#x27;s deep interest in and thorough knowledge of aviation—includes a monologue by a veteran pilot, preserving the atmosphere of these pioneering times: &quot;We used to fly on the Paris route, from Hounslow to Le Bourget and get through as best as you could. Later we moved on to Croydon. (...) We carried the much advertised Air Mails. That meant the machines had to fly whether there were passengers to be carried or not. It was left to the discretion of the pilot whether or not the flight should be cancelled in bad weather; the pilots were dead keen on flying in the most impossible conditions. Sanderson got killed this way at Douinville. And all he had in the machine was a couple of picture postcards from trippers in Paris, sent to their families as a curiosity. That was the Air Mail. No passengers or anything—just the mail&quot;.

===International services===
In the aftermath of the war, the Royal Engineers (Postal Section) and the Royal Air Force pioneered the first scheduled international airmail service between Folkestone, Kent and Cologne, Germany. The service operated between December 1918 and mid-1919; its purpose was to provide troops of the British Army stationed in Germany with a fast mail service. (see more at British Forces Post Office) Throughout the 1920s the Royal Air Force continued to develop air routes through the Middle East.
On 25 December 1918, the Latécoère Airlines (later becoming the famed Aéropostale) became the first civilian international airmail service, when mail was flown from Toulouse, France, to Barcelona, Spain. Less than 2 months later, on 19 February 1919, the airmail service was extended to Casablanca, Morocco, making the Latécoère Airlines the first transcontinental airmail service. In June 1919, Alcock and Brown completed the first transatlantic airmail flight.

The first airmail service established officially by an airline occurred in Colombia, South America, on 19 October 1920. Scadta, the first airline of the country, flew landing river by river delivering mail in its destinations. Australia&#x27;s first airmail contract was awarded to Norman (later Sir) Brearley&#x27;s Western Australian Airlines (WAA). The first airmail was carried between Geraldton and Derby in Western Australia on December 5, 1921.

==Philately==
Since stamp collecting was already a well-developed hobby by this time, collectors followed developments in airmail service closely, and went to some trouble to find out about the first flights between various destinations, and to get letters onto them. The authorities often used special cachets on the covers, and in many cases the pilot would sign them as well.

The first stamps designated specifically for airmail were issued by Italy in 1917, and used on experimental flights; they were produced by overprinting special delivery stamps. Austria also overprinted stamps for airmail in March 1918, soon followed by the first definitive stamp for airmail, issued by the United States in May 1918.

==Air-speeded==
A postal service may sometimes opt to transport some regular mail by air, perhaps because other transportation is unavailable. It is usually impossible to know this by examining an envelope, and such items are not considered &quot;airmail.&quot; Generally, airmail would take a guaranteed and scheduled flight and arrive first, while air-speeded mail would wait for a non-guaranteed and merely available flight and would arrive later than normal airmail.

==Names==

A letter sent via airmail may be called an aerogramme, aerogram, air letter or simply airmail letter. However, aerogramme and aerogram may also refer to a specific kind of airmail letter which is its own envelope; see aerogram.

Some forms of airletter, such as aerogram, may forbid enclosure of other material so as to keep the weight down.

The choice to send a letter by air is indicated either by a handwritten note on the envelope, by the use of special labels called airmail etiquettes (blue stickers with the words &quot;air mail&quot; in French and in the home language), or by the use of specially-marked envelopes. Special airmail stamps may also be available, or required; the rules vary in different countries.

The study of airmail is known as aerophilately.

<doc id="357158" wikidata="Q838653" url="?curid=357158" title="Zorbing">
<text>Zorbing (also known as globe-riding, sphereing, orbing) is the recreation or sport of rolling downhill inside an orb, typically made of transparent plastic. Zorbing is generally performed on a gentle slope but can also be done on a level surface, permitting more rider control. In the absence of hills, some operators have constructed inflatable, wooden, or metal ramps. Due to the buoyant nature of the orbs, Zorbing can also take place on water, provided the orb is inflated properly and sealed once the rider is inside. &quot;Water walking&quot; using such orbs has become popular in theme parks across the UK.

There are two types of orbs: harnessed and non-harnessed. Non-harnessed orbs carry up to three riders, while the harnessed orbs are constructed for one to two riders. The first zorbing site was established in Rotorua, New Zealand, by ZORB Ltd.

==History==
A Russian article on the Zorb mentions a similar device having debuted in 1973. In the early 1980s, the Dangerous Sports Club constructed a giant sphere (reportedly across) with a gimbal arrangement supporting two deck chairs inside. This device was eventually cut up for scrap. Human spheres have been depicted in mass media since 1990 when the Gladiators event &quot;Atlaspheres&quot; first aired, albeit with steel balls.

In 1994, three investors created the firm ZORB Limited in New Zealand to create suitable spheres for humans and to commercialize sphereing. Their business model was to develop the activity via a franchise system. Zorbing entered the Concise Oxford English Dictionary in 2001 where it was defined as: &quot;a sport in which a participant is secured inside an inner capsule in a large, transparent ball which is then rolled along the ground or down hills.&quot;

==Construction==
The orb is double-sectioned, with one ball inside the other with an air layer in between (unlike the water walking ball, which is usually a single thin-walled ball). This acts as a shock absorber for the rider. Orbs are lightweight and made of flexible plastic. Many orbs have straps to hold the rider in place, while others leave the rider free to walk the orb around or be tossed about freely by the rolling motion. A typical orb is about in diameter with an inner orb size of about , leaving a 50–60 centimetre (20–24 in) air cushion around the riders. The plastic is approximately thick. The inner and outer orbs are connected by small nylon strings. Orbs have one or two tunnel-like entrances.

==Facilities==
&#x27;Hill-rolling&#x27; and &#x27;globe riding&#x27; are generic names for this activity which is practised in the United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand, Sweden, Estonia, Canada, the Czech Republic, Poland, the Slovak Republic, Switzerland, Japan, Costa Rica, Kochi in India, Phuket in Thailand, and Slovenia. In the United States, there are facilities in Pigeon Forge, Tennessee, Wisconsin Dells, Wisconsin, Amesbury, Massachusetts, and Roundtop Mountain Resort, Lewisberry and Pennsylvania. with the longest track in the world in Denmark, Western Australia at 570m long.

==Records==
The Guinness Book of World Records recognises five sphereing records:
* The longest distance travelled in a single roll is held by Steve Camp, of South Africa, who travelled .
* The fastest sphereing ride is held by New Zealand&#x27;s Keith Kolver, who reached a speed of .
*The longest time spent zorbing is 4 hours, 11 minutes, and 33 seconds; the record is held by Siddhant Kulkarni, who also once held the fastest sphereing ride.
* The fastest in a Zorb is 23.21 seconds; it is held by James Duggan, of Dunmanway, County Cork, Ireland, who broke the record during the Sam Maguire Harvest Festival on the September 8, 2019.

==Injuries and deaths==
Although the cushioning design of the orbs prevents many serious injuries, light injuries such as bruises and grazes can often be sustained by colliding with objects or tripping whilst the orb is rolling down an incline. Even though severe injury is rare, there have been cases of children passing out due to lack of air and even some deaths.

In June 2009, a teacher died (and a pupil was severely injured) in the Czech Republic while zorbing.

In January 2013, at a ski resort in Dombay, Russia, a man died from a broken neck, and another was badly injured when the Zorb he was in rolled out of control down a mountain, hitting rocks and eventually coming to a stop a kilometre away on a frozen lake. The incident was caught on camera and uploaded to the Internet. After the incident made international headlines, Russian authorities called for tougher safety laws.

In December 2021, some of the children injured or killed by the Hillcrest Primary School Tragedy were in Zorbs that were launched into the air by a gust of wind.

In May 2023, a nine year old child was injured when a zorb was lifted into the air at Southport food and drink festival in the UK. Police were investigating footage of a dust devil, filmed in the area on the same day as the accident.

An Irish woman who was brain damaged, when a safety harness failed while she was zorbing as a girl, was awarded €1million in December 2024.

<text>The Newseum (April 18, 1997–March 3, 2002 and April 11, 2008–December 31, 2019) was an American museum located first in Rosslyn, Virginia, and later at 555 Pennsylvania Avenue NW, in Washington, D.C., dedicated to news and journalism that promoted free expression and the First Amendment to the United States Constitution, while tracing the evolution of communication.

The purpose of the museum, funded by the Freedom Forum, a nonpartisan U.S. foundation dedicated to freedom of the press, freedom of speech, and freedom of thought, was to help the public and the media understand each other. 

The seven-level, museum in Washington, D.C. featured fifteen theaters and fifteen galleries. Its Berlin Wall Gallery included the largest display of sections of the wall outside Germany. The Today&#x27;s Front Pages Gallery presented daily front pages from more than 80 international newspapers. The Today&#x27;s Front Pages Gallery is still available on the Newseum&#x27;s website, along with a few other galleries. 
Other galleries presented topics including the First Amendment, world press freedom, news history, the September 11 attacks, and the history of the Internet, TV, and radio.

Its first location opened in Rosslyn, Virginia on April 18, 1997, and on April 11, 2008, it opened at its last location. On December 31, 2019, the Newseum closed its doors permanently and many exhibits and artifacts were put into storage or returned to their owners.

== History ==


Freedom Forum is a non-profit organization founded in 1991 by publisher Al Neuharth, founder of the newspaper &quot;USA Today&quot;, based on the previous Gannett Foundation. Freedom Forum opened the Newseum in Arlington, Virginia, in 1997. Prior to opening in Virginia, it maintained exhibition galleries in Nashville and Manhattan, the latter in the lobby of the former IBM Building at 590 Madison Avenue. In 2000, Freedom Forum decided to move the museum across the Potomac River to downtown Washington, D.C. The original site was closed on March 3, 2002, to allow its staff to concentrate on building the new, larger museum. The new museum, built at a cost of $450 million, opened its doors to the public on April 11, 2008.

After obtaining a location at Pennsylvania Avenue and Sixth Street NW, the former site of National Hotel, the Newseum board selected exhibit designer Ralph Appelbaum, who had designed the original site in Arlington, Virginia, and architect James Stewart Polshek, who designed the Rose Center for Earth and Space with Todd Schliemann at the American Museum of Natural History in New York City, to work on the new project.
Highlights of the building design unveiled October 2002 included a façade featuring a &quot;window on the world&quot;, , which looked out on Pennsylvania Avenue and the National Mall while letting the public see inside to the visitors and displays. It featured the 45 words of the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, etched into a four story tall stone panel facing Pennsylvania Avenue.

One feature carried over from the prior Arlington site was the Journalists Memorial, a glass sculpture listing the names of 2,291 journalists from around the world killed in the line of duty. It was updated and rededicated annually.

The museum website was updated daily with images and PDF versions of newspaper front pages from around the world. Hard copies of selected front pages, including one from every U.S. state and Washington, D.C., were displayed in galleries within the museum and outside the front entrance.

Jerry Frieheim, a 1956 graduate of the University of Missouri School of Journalism, was the first executive director of the Newseum and claims to have coined the name.

==Building==
The 643,000-square-foot (60,000 m2) Newseum included a high atrium, seven levels of displays, 15 theaters, a dozen major galleries, many more smaller exhibits, two broadcast studios, and an expanded interactive newsroom. The structural engineer for this project was Leslie E. Robertson Associates.

The building featured an oval, 500-seat theater; approximately gross of housing facing Sixth and C streets; of office space for the staff of the Newseum and Freedom Forum; and more than of conference center space on two levels located directly above the museum&#x27;s main atrium. The building was also known for the largest and tallest hydraulic passenger elevators in the world, with a capacity of capable of carrying up to 72 passengers when fully loaded, and a travel distance of that covers 7 floors. A curving glass memorial to slain journalists was located above the ground floor.

Showcase environments throughout the museum were climate controlled by four microclimate control devices. These units provided a flow of humidified air to the cases through a system of distribution pipes.

ABC&#x27;s &quot;This Week&quot; began broadcasting from a new studio in the Newseum on April 20, 2008, with George Stephanopoulos as host. ABC moved &quot;This Week&quot; back to its Washington, D.C. bureau in June 2013 citing the network&#x27;s infrequent use of the Newseum studio compared to the cost of operating and maintaining a studio there. The studio was later home to Al Jazeera America&#x27;s Washington, D.C. bureau which also had editing facilities and office space in the building.

Sharing the building with the Newseum were The Source, a Wolfgang Puck Restaurant, and the Newseum Residences, a collection of 135 luxury apartment homes. 

==Critical response==
Journalist Alan Rusbridger of &quot;The Guardian&quot; wrote that visitors would have &quot;a great family day out&quot;; he considered some of the exhibits, such as a red dress worn by Helen Thomas, &quot;faintly ridiculous&quot; while praising others, such as a large chunk of the actual Berlin Wall. Although writing that the Newseum displayed &quot;self-glorification, pomposity and vanity&quot; in an &quot;overwhelmingly American-centric&quot; way, he described the building design as &quot;uplifting&quot; and generally commended the features. Michael Landauer of the &quot;Dallas Morning News&quot; praised its interactive exhibits, writing: &quot;While the free Smithsonian museums do a fine job of housing our important artifacts, I believe the Newseum on Pennsylvania Avenue does an unparalleled job of telling our nation&#x27;s story.&quot; Bonnie Wach, writing for the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; praised the Newseum&#x27;s interactive exhibits, calling it &quot;a marvel of technological innovation&quot; and citing its &quot;seven floors of touch-screens, theaters, film and video, state-of-the-art studios, computer games, interactive kiosks, documentary footage and hands-on multimedia exhibits.&quot;

Other reviewers were more critical. Nicolai Ouroussoff, architecture critic for the &quot;New York Times&quot;, panned the second Newseum building as &quot;the latest reason to lament the state of contemporary architecture in&quot; Washington, D.C. Writing on the Newseum&#x27;s content, &quot;Times&quot; culture critic Edward Rothstein wrote that &quot;a good portion of the museum&#x27;s earnestly sought attention is well deserved&quot; but &quot;the museum&#x27;s preening does call for some skepticism.&quot; Gannett&#x27;s &quot;USA Today&quot; noted that while reviews of the building&#x27;s architecture had been mixed, the high number of visitors was a sign that the Newseum was successful, even in a capital city full of museums. James Bowman of &quot;National Review Online&quot; criticized the Newseum&#x27;s interaction-heavy exhibits as overly stylistic and superficial, writing that it focuses on headline-based reporting of major world events rather than details of the events themselves. The &quot;AIA Guide to the Architecture of Washington DC&quot; describes the view from the Avenue as a &quot;barrage, with numerous elements vying for your attention. ... a virtual national television set (or computer screen).&quot;
An exhibit at the Newseum discussed the &quot;effort to avoid bias&quot; by journalists. It included a 2006 Gallup poll in which 44% of Americans called the media &quot;too liberal&quot; while only 19% found it &quot;too conservative&quot; as well as other comments on possible political media bias, many of which came from Fox News contributors. Jonathan Schwarz of &quot;Mother Jones&quot; criticized the exhibit and called it an example of corporate propaganda from Rupert Murdoch&#x27;s News Corporation. He also argued that most of the U.S. news media is controlled by businesses who shut out stories that would counter their interests. Kevin D. Williamson of &quot;National Review Online&quot; defended the Newseum, calling the criticism &quot;nonsense concentrate&quot; and arguing that media-owning companies have an interest in promoting non-conservative causes.

Jack Shafer, co-editor of &quot;Slate&quot;, criticized the Newseum&#x27;s exhibit about the career of the late NBC reporter Tim Russert. He argued that Russert&#x27;s &quot;mundane&quot; work-space was not worthy of preservation in a museum and that Russert&#x27;s accomplishments &quot;begin at being a pretty good interviewer and end at having a lot of celebrity friends.&quot; He concluded that the Newseum is &quot;a place where journalist celebrities begin to be worshipped as miracle-producing saints.&quot;

Despite mixed reviews, the museum drew 1.7 million visitors in its first four years in DC.

==Al Aqsa TV controversy ==

In the May 2013 rededication ceremony of the Journalist Memorial, the Newseum first decided to honor two Al Aqsa TV members as part of the memorial, and then withdrew them after criticism from pro-Israeli organizations. After a year-long review of the circumstances surrounding their deaths, the Newseum, in partnership with other journalism organizations decided their names would remain on the Journalists Memorial wall.

Ilene Prusher, columnist for the Israeli newspaper &quot;Haaretz&quot;, said that the Newseum stepped into the &quot;minefield&quot; of the Arab–Israeli conflict. Al-Aqsa TV is affiliated with Hamas in the Gaza Strip, and the two deceased journalists were killed by Israeli fire in a car marked &quot;TV&quot;. Israeli Defense Forces spokeswoman, Lt. Col. Avital Leibovich, said that they were killed deliberately, not accidentally, because they &quot;have relevance to terror activity.&quot;

Nearly all journalistic organizations hold that the men were killed in the line of duty, including the Committee to Protect Journalists, Reporters Without Borders, the International Federation of Journalists and the World Association of Newspapers and News Publishers. Human Rights Watch said that their investigation in Gaza showed no evidence that the men were involved in militant activity. NBC News chief foreign correspondent Richard Engel said at the Newseum&#x27;s dedication ceremony that it was difficult to draw the line, and several reporters on the list were Syrians who were also activists who were trying to topple Bashar al-Assad&#x27;s government. David Carr of the &quot;New York Times&quot; said that &quot;the evidence so far suggests that they were journalists, however partisan.&quot;

==Permanent exhibits==
*The New York Times—Ochs-Sulzberger Family Great Hall: Located in the atrium, a 90-foot-high screen showed the latest headlines from around the globe. A satellite replica and a Bell helicopter (formerly used by KXAS-TV in Dallas) were also suspended in the atrium.

*News Corporation News History Gallery, A timeline showcased the extensive collection of newspapers and magazines. Touch-screen computers housed hundreds of digitized publications, allowing for close-up viewing, as well as interactive games, and access to a database of journalists. Included in this gallery was a 1603 English broadsheet showing the coronation of James I; a 1787 copy of the &quot;Maryland Gazette&quot; containing the new United States Constitution; The &quot;Charleston Mercury&quot;s 1860 extra enthusiastically proclaiming, &quot;The Union Is Dissolved!&quot;; a copy of the 1948 &quot;Chicago Daily Tribune&quot; mistakenly announcing, &quot;Dewey Defeats Truman.&quot;
*9/11 Gallery Sponsored by Comcast, This gallery explored the coverage of September 11, 2001. A tribute to photojournalist William Biggart, who died covering the attacks, was included. Visitors got to hear his story and see some of the final photographs he took. A giant wall was covered with worldwide front pages published the following morning, and a portion of the communications antenna from the roof of the World Trade Center was on display with a timeline of the reports and bulletins that were issued as the day unfolded. A film gave additional first-person accounts from reporters and photographers who covered the story.

*Pulitzer Prize Photographs Gallery, a display the most comprehensive collection of Pulitzer Prize-winning photographs ever gathered. It included every Pulitzer Prize winning entry since 1942. Some photographs included are: &quot;Raising the Flag on Iwo Jima&quot;, &quot;Burst of Joy&quot; (the joyful reunion of a returning prisoner of war and his family), a firefighter cradling a mortally injured infant after the Oklahoma City bombing. 

*Berlin Wall Gallery, largest display of the original wall outside of Germany. There were eight high concrete sections of wall, each weighing about three tons, and a three-story East German guard tower from Checkpoint Charlie (or &quot;Checkpoint C&quot;), the name given by Western Allies to Berlin&#x27;s best-known East–West crossing.

Cox Enterprises First Amendment Gallery: This gallery explored the role that the First Amendment&#x27;s guarantee of rights (religion, speech, press, assembly and petition) has played in the United States over the past 200 years. The exhibit presented historical news clips that exemplify the five freedoms. &quot;Our liberty depends on the freedom of the press,&quot; said Thomas Jefferson, &quot;and that cannot be limited without being lost.&quot;

Journalists Memorial: Memorialized journalists who died in the course of their duties. This exhibit displayed artifacts from hazardous journalistic missions. Included was the laptop computer used by Daniel Pearl, the bloodstained notebook of Michael Weisskopf, and the 1976 Datsun 710 belonging to Don Bolles that was bombed in Phoenix. Also featured was a sobering display of more than 1,800 names etched on a series of glass tablets, marking the deaths of those who died in pursuit of the news. The gallery also contained photographs of hundreds of those journalists and access to more detailed information on every honored journalist.

==Operations and closures==
The Newseum attracted more than 815,000 visitors a year, and its television studios hosted news broadcasts. There was an admission fee for adults. The institution saw years of significant financial losses. In February 2018, these losses led to an exploration of selling its building or moving to another location. In January 2019, the Freedom Forum announced The Johns Hopkins University would purchase the building for $372.5 million in order to use the space for several graduate programs.

===Financial losses and building closure===

Despite a substantial revenue stream of rents, museum admissions, and event fees, the Newseum lost a significant amount of money. In 2011, ticket sales offset just 10 percent of expenses. In 2015, the museum lost more than $2.5 million on revenue of $59 million.

The Freedom Forum reported that the losses had led to controversial proposals for strategies that might improve the museum&#x27;s finances. The issues, in part, reached back to the Washington location&#x27;s construction, which had significant cost overruns. Furthermore, the numerous free museums in the National Mall area, such as those of the Smithsonian Institution and National Gallery of Art, made it difficult for visitors to justify paying the Newseum&#x27;s steep entry fees. In August 2017, the Newseum&#x27;s president, Jeffrey Herbst, resigned in the face of the museum&#x27;s financial problems.

In February 2018, &quot;The Washington Post&quot; reported that the Newseum was exploring the sale of its building or a move. The Freedom Forum informed &quot;The Washington Post&quot; that it had been financing over $20 million a year in continued operating expenses. In January 2019, the Freedom Forum announced that it would sell the Newseum building to The Johns Hopkins University for $372.5 million. &quot;The Washington Post&quot; subsequently published a detailed account of the financial difficulties that the museum had encountered, which included a loss of over $100 million at the time of sale due to the facility&#x27;s cost having risen to $477 million. The museum closed to the public on December 31, 2019.

On July 12, 2019, Johns Hopkins presented designs that showed the removal of the First Amendment etched stone panel from the building&#x27;s façade. In March 2021, the Freedom Forum announced that they would donate the , panel, which was in the process of being dismantled, to the National Constitution Center on Independence Mall in Philadelphia, where it is planned to be reinstalled on a wall in the center&#x27;s second-floor atrium. 

As of 2023, the building will be home to Johns Hopkins&#x27; Carey Business School.

The closure of the Journalists Memorial was a blow to advocates of freedom of the press who felt there ought to be some place to commemorate journalists who had sacrificed their lives for their work. As a result, in December 2020, a bipartisan group of members of Congress brought about the enactment of a bill which authorized the construction of a memorial to fallen journalists on public land with private funds. In May 2023, the Fallen Journalists Memorial Foundation started design work on the memorial.

<doc id="357177" wikidata="Q372544" url="?curid=357177" title="Lorenzo Barcelata">
<text>Lorenzo Barcelata (July 24, 1898 – July 13, 1943) was a Mexican composer and actor born in Tlalixcoyan, Veracruz. He died in Mexico City from cholera, shortly before his 45th birthday.

Barcelata came from a musically oriented family. He wrote his first song, &quot;Arroyito&quot;, at the age of 14. He later moved to Tampico where he formed the Cuarteto Tamaulipeco with composer Ernesto Cortázar. Their fame quickly spread throughout the region and they received international fame when the Mexican government sent them on a tour of Cuba. While there, they were signed to perform a 52-week tour of the United States. After two of the members were fatally injured in an automobile accident, Barcelata returned to Mexico. He reformed the quartet as his fame continued to grow. Beginning in 1932, he entered the Mexican film industry and became a prominent film composer until his death. He also achieved fame as an actor as he played roles in several films.

His most famous song is &quot;María Elena&quot;, (also known as &quot;Yours is My Heart&quot;), and was originally written for Lucia Martínez García. The song was written at the request of Ernesto Soto Reyes, Lucía&#x27;s husband, who paid $10,000 pesos for the song. Shortly before registering the song, Barcelata showed it to his businessman friend Anacarsis &quot;Carcho&quot; Peralta, who loved it; curiously, the song appeared shortly afterwards as &quot;María Elena&quot;, the name of one of the businessman&#x27;s girlfriends. &quot;Maria Elena&quot; was featured in the 1936 Mexican film of the same name. A version of it was also included on the soundtrack to the 1935 American film &quot;Bordertown&quot;. It was later translated into English and performed by the Lawrence Welk orchestra. Another English version was recorded by Jimmy Dorsey. Dorsey&#x27;s version topped the charts in 1941. Wayne King also recorded an English version which reached the No. 2 position during the week of June 14, runner-up only to the Dorsey version. A vocal version by Tony Pastor also reached the Top 10 during that month. &quot;Maria Elena&quot; has since been recorded internationally by several different musicians. In 1958, the Brazilian group Los Indios Tabajaras recorded a version that became popular throughout Latin America and later (in 1963) reached the No. 6 position in the US charts &amp; No. 5 in the UK charts.

The popularity of &quot;Maria Elena&quot; in the US in the early-1940s resulted in Barcelata touring the country once again. He returned to Mexico in 1943 where he was scheduled to produce several radio programs. However, he died on July 13, before recording could begin. In total, he left behind a catalog of 214 songs, including &quot;Por ti aprendí a querer&quot;, and &quot;El Cascabel&quot;, among others.

A recording of &quot;El Cascabel&quot; was one of the pieces of music on the Voyager Golden Record. This version was a mariachi interpretation performed by Antonio Maciel y Las Aguilillas with El Mariachi México de Pepe Villa. The 12 inch album (complete with stylus, cartridge and instructions for use) was launched into deep space aboard the Voyager space probes in the late 1970s.

<doc id="357178" wikidata="Q35828" url="?curid=357178" title="Chinantecan languages">
<text>The Chinantec or Chinantecan languages constitute a branch of the Oto-Manguean family. Though traditionally considered a single language, &quot;Ethnologue&quot; lists 14 partially mutually unintelligible varieties of Chinantec. The languages are spoken by the indigenous Chinantec people who live in Oaxaca and Veracruz, Mexico, especially in the districts of Cuicatlán, Ixtlán de Juárez, Tuxtepec and Choapan, and in Staten Island, New York.

==Internal classification==
Egland and Bartholomew (1978) established fourteen Chinantec languages on the basis of 80% mutual intelligibility. &quot;Ethnologue&quot; found that one that had not been adequately compared (Tlaltepusco) was not distinct, but split another (Lalana from Tepinapa). At a looser criterion of 70% intelligibility, Lalana–Tepinapa, Quiotepec–Comaltepec, Palantla–Valle Nacional, and geographically distant Chiltepec–Tlacoatzintepec would be languages, reducing the count to ten. Lealao Chinantec (Latani) is the most divergent.

==Phonology==

Chinantecan languages have ballistic syllables, apparently a kind of phonation.

All Chinantec languages are tonal. Some, such as Usila Chinantec and Ojitlán Chinantec, have five register tones (in addition to contour tones), with the extreme tones deriving historically from ballistic syllables.

==Grammar==
Grammars are published for Sochiapam Chinantec, and a grammar and a dictionary of Palantla (Tlatepuzco) Chinantec.

Example phrase:
:&quot;ca¹-dsén¹=jni chi³ chieh³&quot;
:‘I pulled out the hen (from the box).

The parts of this sentence are: &quot;ca¹&quot; a prefix which marks the past tense, &quot;dsén¹&quot; which is the verb stem meaning &quot;to pull out an animate object&quot;, the suffix -&quot;jni&quot; referring to the first person, the noun classifier &quot;chi³&quot; and the noun &quot;chieh³&quot; meaning chicken.

==Whistled speech==
The Chinantec people have practiced whistled speech since the pre-Columbian era. The rhythm and pitch of normal Chinantec speech allow speakers of the language to have entire conversations only by whistling. The sound of whistling carries better than shouting across the canyons of mountainous Oaxaca. It enables messages to be exchanged over a distance of up to . Whistled speech is typically only used by Chinantec men, although women also understand it. Use of the whistled language is declining, as modern technology such as walkie-talkies and loudspeakers have made long-distance communication easier.

==Media==
Chinantec-language programming is carried by the CDI&#x27;s radio stations XEOJN, broadcasting from San Lucas Ojitlán, Oaxaca, and XEGLO, broadcasting from Guelatao de Juárez, Oaxaca.
