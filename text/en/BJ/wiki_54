<text>The beetroot (British English) or beet (North American English) is the taproot portion of a &quot;Beta vulgaris&quot; subsp. &quot;vulgaris&quot; plant in the Conditiva Group. The plant is a root vegetable also known as the table beet, garden beet, dinner beet, or else categorized by color: red beet or golden beet. It is also a leaf vegetable called beet greens. Beetroot can be eaten raw, roasted, steamed, or boiled. Beetroot can also be canned, either whole or cut up, and often are pickled, spiced, or served in a sweet-and-sour sauce.

It is one of several cultivated varieties of &quot;Beta vulgaris&quot; subsp. &quot;vulgaris&quot; grown for their edible taproots or leaves, classified as belonging to the Conditiva Group. Other cultivars of the same subspecies include the sugar beet, the leaf vegetable known as spinach beet (Swiss chard), and the fodder crop mangelwurzel.

==Etymology==
&quot;Beta&quot; is the ancient Latin name for beetroot, possibly of Celtic origin, becoming &quot;bete&quot; in Old English. &quot;Root&quot; derives from the late Old English &quot;rōt&quot;, itself from Old Norse &quot;rót&quot;.

==History==
The domestication of beetroot can be traced to the emergence of an allele that enables biennial harvesting of leaves and taproot. Beetroot was domesticated in the ancient Middle East, primarily for their greens, and were grown by the Ancient Egyptians, Greeks, and Romans. By the Roman era, it is thought that they were also cultivated for their roots. From the Middle Ages, beetroot was used to treat various conditions, especially illnesses relating to digestion and the blood. Bartolomeo Platina recommended taking beetroot with garlic to nullify the effects of &quot;garlic-breath&quot;.

During the middle of the 17th century, wine often was colored with beetroot juice.

Food shortages in Europe following World War I caused great hardships, including cases of &quot;mangelwurzel&quot; disease, as relief workers called it. It was symptomatic of eating only beetroot.

==Culinary use==
Usually, the deep purple roots of beetroot are eaten boiled, roasted, or raw, and either alone or combined with any salad vegetable. The green, leafy portion of the beetroot is also edible. The young leaves can be added raw to salads, while the mature leaves are most commonly served boiled or steamed, in which case they have a taste and texture similar to spinach. Beetroot can be roasted, boiled or steamed, peeled, and then eaten warm with or without butter; cooked, pickled, and then eaten cold as a condiment; or peeled, shredded raw, and then eaten as a salad. Pickled beetroot is a traditional food in many countries.

=== Australia and New Zealand ===

In Australia and New Zealand, sliced pickled beetroot is a common ingredient in traditional hamburgers.

=== Eastern Europe ===
In Eastern Europe, beetroot soup, such as borscht [Ukrainian] and barszcz czerwony [Polish], is common. In Ukraine, a related dish called &quot;shpundra&quot; is also common; this hearty beetroot stew, often made with pork belly or ribs, is sometimes referred to as a thicker version of borscht. In Poland and Ukraine, beetroot is combined with horseradish to form &quot;ćwikła&quot; or &quot;бурячки&quot; (buryachky), which is traditionally used with cold cuts and sandwiches, but often also added to a meal consisting of meat and potatoes.

Similarly, in Serbia, beetroot (referred to by the local name &quot;cvekla&quot;) is used as winter salad, seasoned with salt and vinegar, with meat dishes.

As an addition to horseradish, it is also used to produce the &quot;red&quot; variety of &quot;chrain&quot;, a condiment in Ashkenazi Jewish, Hungarian, Polish, Lithuanian, Russian, and Ukrainian cuisine.

Cold beetroot soup called &quot;Šaltibarščiai&quot; is very popular in Lithuania. Traditionally it consists of kefir, boiled beetroot, cucumber, dill, spring onions and can be eaten with boiled eggs and potatoes.

 is an old-time traditional Russian cold soup made from leftover beet greens and chopped beetroots, typically with bread and kvass added. Botvinya got its name from the Russian &quot;botva&quot;, which means &quot;root vegetable greens&quot;, referring to beet plant leaves.

, or svyokolnik, is yet another Russian beet-based soup, typically distinguished from borscht in that vegetables for svekolnik are cooked raw and not sauteed, while many types of borscht typically include sauteed carrots and other vegetables. Svekolnik got its name from &quot;svyokla&quot;, Russian word for &quot;beet.&quot; Sometimes, various types of cold borscht are also called &quot;svekolnik&quot;.

=== India ===
In Indian cuisine, chopped, cooked, spiced beetroot is a common side dish. Yellow-colored beetroots are grown on a very small scale for home consumption.

=== North America ===
Besides standard fruit and vegetable dishes, certain varieties of beets are sometimes used as a garnish to a tart.

=== Northern Europe ===
A common dish in Sweden and elsewhere in the Nordic countries is Biff à la Lindström, a variant of meatballs or burgers, with chopped or grated beetroot added to the minced meat.

In Northern Germany, beetroot is mashed with &quot;Labskaus&quot; or added as its side order.

== Industrial production and other uses ==
A large proportion of commercial production is processed into boiled and sterilized beetroot or pickles.

Betanin, obtained from the roots, is used industrially as red food colorant to enhance the color and flavor of tomato paste, sauces, desserts, jams and jellies, ice cream, candy, and breakfast cereals. When beetroot juice is used, it is most stable in foods with low water content, such as frozen novelties and fruit fillings.

Beetroot can be used to make wine.

==Nutrition==
Raw beetroot is 88% water, 10% carbohydrates, 2% protein, and less than 1% fat (see table). In a amount providing of food energy, raw beetroot is a rich source (27% of the Daily Value (DV)) of folate and a moderate source (16% DV) of manganese, with other nutrients having insignificant content (table).

===Health effects===
A clinical trial review reported that consumption of beetroot juice modestly reduced systolic blood pressure but not diastolic blood pressure.

==Pigment==
The red color compound betanin is a betalain in the category of betacyanins. It is not broken down in the body, and in higher concentrations, may temporarily cause urine or stools to assume a reddish color, in the case of urine a condition called beeturia.

Although harmless, this effect may cause initial concern as a medical problem due to a visual similarity with blood in the stool, blood passing through the anus (hematochezia), or blood in the urine (hematuria).

Nitrosamine formation in beetroot juice can reliably be prevented by adding ascorbic acid.

==Cultivars==
Below is a list of several commonly available cultivars of beetroot. Generally, 55 to 65 days are needed from germination to harvest of the root. All cultivars can be harvested earlier for use as greens. Unless otherwise noted, the root colors are shades of red and dark red, with different degrees of zoning noticeable in slices.

<doc id="365197" wikidata="Q3453636" url="?curid=365197" title="Ruth Richardson">
<text>Ruth Margaret Richardson (born 13 December 1950) is a retired New Zealand politician of the National Party who served as Minister of Finance from 1990 to 1993. Her 1991 budget, which she dubbed the &quot;Mother of all Budgets&quot;, formed the catalyst for her party&#x27;s economic reforms known in the media as &quot;Ruthanasia&quot;.

Richardson was a lawyer by profession. She was elected as the Member of Parliament (MP) for Selwyn in 1981. Following the National Party victory in the , Richardson was appointed as Finance Minister in the fourth National Government. She supported and carried on the free-market reforms initiated by the preceding Labour Government, and extended them in a significant way with the Fiscal Responsibility Act 1994. Richardon&#x27;s economic restructuring, including privatisation of state assets and cuts to social welfare, contributed to New Zealand emerging from its fiscal problems. However, critics have noted the wide-ranging effects on New Zealand&#x27;s social fabric including child poverty along with wealth inequality, which were both severely exacerbated.

Richardson was dismissed as Finance Minister following the ; she resigned from Parliament in 1994. She later joined ACT New Zealand.

==Early life==
Richardson was born in southern Taranaki on 13 December 1950. Her family had a long history in the area, and her great-grandfather George Pearce had served as MP for from to 1919. Her father was active in the National Party&#x27;s Patea branch. Richardson was brought up as a Roman Catholic, and after finishing primary school, was sent to Sacred Heart College, a Catholic girls&#x27; high school in Wanganui.

Richardson decided on a career in Parliament at an early age, before she even left high school. Sir Roy Jack, a National Party MP and a friend of her family, advised her to study law, which she did. Richardson gained a law degree from the University of Canterbury. After graduating, she worked for the Department of Justice. In 1975, Richardson married Andrew Wright, a colleague from the Department.

Richardson&#x27;s first attempt to break into politics came when she challenged Sir Roy Jack for the National Party nomination in the . His electorate was merged into because of post-census boundary changes. Besides alienating her from her old mentor, she also created considerable irritation in the higher ranks of the party. National had long frowned on challenges to sitting MPs who sought renomination, and was especially hostile when the challenge was made against long-serving MPs such as Jack. George Chapman, who chaired the selection, said, &quot;The tensions were tremendous, but Roy was finally confirmed as the candidate.&quot; She was a member of the non-partisan political lobby organisation the Women&#x27;s Electoral Lobby.

In 1978, Richardson contested the National Party&#x27;s nomination for the Tasman seat. She won the nomination, but in the 1978 election itself, she failed to defeat incumbent Labour MP Bill Rowling (who was leader of his party at the time). In 1980, she was invited to contest the nomination for Selwyn, a National safe seat just outside Christchurch which was held by retiring MP Colin McLachlan. She won the nomination, and in the 1981 election, was elected to Parliament.

==Early parliamentary career==



Richardson was influenced by the neo-liberal thought of Milton Friedman and Friedrich Hayek. She quickly distinguished herself in the National Party caucus as a supporter of free market economics, privatisation, and trade liberalisation. This contrasted considerably with the views held by National Party Prime Minister Robert Muldoon, who favoured an interventionist approach based on significant overseas borrowing. Richardson&#x27;s focus on financial matters was itself a cause for comment, as many female MPs (particularly in the National Party) had confined themselves to matters such as health and social welfare.

When National lost the 1984 election, Richardson became a member of the Opposition. Richardson stood out in National&#x27;s caucus for her strong support of the radical economic reforms of the Labour Party&#x27;s new Finance Minister, Roger Douglas. These reforms, sometimes known as &quot;Rogernomics&quot;, involved the privatisation of state assets, the removal of tariffs and subsidies, and applying monetarism to control inflation. These reforms were seen by many Labour as against traditional Labour policy, but were also opposed by the more conservative wings of the National Party. Particularly hostile were followers of Muldoon, a traditionalist conservative who opposed free market reforms as undermining state authority.

Shortly after National lost government, Jim McLay replaced Muldoon as leader of the National Party and he appointed Richardson education spokesperson. In February 1986 there was a considerable rearrangement of responsibilities in the opposition. People such as Bill Birch and George Gair, who McLay associated with the Muldoon era, were demoted. They were replaced by newer MPs, such as Richardson and Simon Upton, who McLay believed would help revitalise the party. This move proved fatal to McLay personally, however, as the sacked Birch and Gair allied themselves with McLay&#x27;s rival, Jim Bolger. Bolger ousted McLay and became party leader.

The change in leadership was damaging for Richardson, as Bolger (and many of his allies) strongly disliked her. This dislike was due to three main factors: anger at McLay&#x27;s &quot;favouritism&quot; towards her, dislike of her advocacy for radical free-market economic policies, and dislike of her personality (which many colleagues found &quot;abrasive&quot; and &quot;condescending&quot;). When George Gair (elevated for his role in Bolger&#x27;s rise to power) retired from the position of deputy leader, Richardson stepped forward for the position. Bolger, however, made it clear that he strongly opposed Richardson&#x27;s candidacy, instead throwing his support behind Don McKinnon. McKinnon narrowly defeated Richardson by just one vote and became deputy leader.

Bolger did, however, make Richardson the party&#x27;s spokesperson on finance in recognition of her strong showing for the deputy leadership. This was an attempt to pacify Richardson and her supporters, rather than an expression of confidence in her – it was well known that Bolger himself preferred the more cautious Birch for the finance role. The move to defuse tension was only partially successful, and hostility between supporters of Bolger and supporters of Richardson remained. Many National politicians believed that Richardson sought to replace Bolger as leader, but even if Bolger was vulnerable, the two factions that opposed him (one led by Richardson and the other led by Winston Peters) were unwilling to cooperate. Bolger&#x27;s leadership remained secure, and when his popularity rose, the window of opportunity was lost.

When Richardson gave birth during a recess in the 1980s, she had a room in Parliament set aside for her to breastfeed in (although a creche was not established until the 1990s).

==Minister of Finance==

When National came to power in the , Richardson had enough support within the party to be made Minister of Finance, though Bolger preferred Bill Birch for the post. Many people believed that the National Party would adopt more cautious, conservative policies than the radical Labour government. On coming to office, however, the new Government was confronted with a much worse fiscal and economic position than the out-going Government had disclosed. In particular, the state-owned Bank of New Zealand required a multimillion-dollar recapitalization. The forecast budget surplus was quickly revised, upon National coming into office, to a large budget deficit. In response, the new government announced significant cuts to social welfare benefits, and reneged on National&#x27;s 1990 election promise to remove the tax surcharge on superannuation (and even increased the rate of the surcharge from 20 to 25 per
cent and lowered the tax exemption threshold).

Whilst employment law reform had been expressed in the 1990 manifesto, many National Party supporters, and some of its parliamentary caucus, were disappointed at the continuation of the policies established by Douglas. Richardson&#x27;s first Budget, which she had jokingly dubbed the &quot;Mother of all Budgets&quot;—a term that would haunt her political career—compounded this unpopularity, as it significantly cut state spending in many areas as an attempt to bring deficits under control. Her policies were widely known as &quot;Ruthanasia&quot;.

While she remained Finance Minister for the whole three-year term of the first Bolger government, this was a period marked by increasing tension within the Cabinet. Tax policy was an area where Richardson and the more moderate members of the Cabinet often failed to agree even the basics.

Although National was re-elected in the , it was by the narrowest of margins (one seat) and many people within the party believed that Richardson&#x27;s presence was damaging to National. In addition, Bolger and his allies had still not been reconciled with her. In order to partially reflect the strong discontent in the electorate with the reform process (National arguably only won because the opposition vote was split between three parties) Richardson lost her role as Minister of Finance to Birch, and was offered the role of Minister of Justice. Richardson refused, preferring to take a role on the back-benches. Soon afterward, she decided to leave Parliament altogether, forcing a by-election. In 1993, Richardson was awarded the New Zealand Suffrage Centennial Medal.

===Legacy===

Though her period as Finance Minister was comparatively short, Richardson&#x27;s legacy in subjects such as fiscal responsibility and economic liberty is large. Many of the reforms she championed have endured and remain an example for a modern Public Financial Management. With the first public sector balance sheet produced it was used to avoid a double down-grade to the Sovereign credit rating. New Zealand remains the only country that has introduced modern accounting and integrated its balance sheet with the budget, as a tool for its budgeting, appropriations, and financial reporting. Since these public sector reforms, New Zealand has achieved and maintained significantly positive net worth, notwithstanding several shocks to the economy, including the financial crisis of 2007–2008 and the Christchurch earthquake in 2011, where most comparable governments like Australia and Canada, or larger countries such as the UK and US, have a negative net worth.

The 2021 New Zealand budget presented by the Sixth Labour Government boosted levels for beneficiaries by the highest amount in decades in what was framed as a direct response to Richardson&#x27;s 1991 &quot;Mother of all Budgets&quot; by largely restoring benefit levels. During the budget day speech, finance minister Grant Robertson said that it had been 30 years since the 1991 budget and that the 2021 budget would &quot;address the most inequitable of the changes made 30 years ago.&quot; Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern commented that &quot;On too many occasions in New Zealand&#x27;s history, the changes that leave an indelible mark on the next generation do so for the wrong reason.&quot; In response to the 1991 budget&#x27;s legacy Richardson defended it, by stating: &quot;My budget was driven by a desire to lift economic growth and to make employment attractive.&quot; The cut in major benefits in the 1991 budget had long-lasting effects on welfare and poverty in New Zealand. Benefits were effectively not raised until a small increase in 2016 under the Fifth National Government by finance minister Bill English, with the 2020 and 2021 budgets largely restoring the pre-1991 levels. Richardson&#x27;s cut in benefits is largely seen as having corresponded with an increase in long term general poverty and wealth inequality in New Zealand.

==Subsequent career==
Ruth Richardson resigned from parliament in the following year, being replaced by David Carter as MP by the 1994 Selwyn by-election.

She continued to be involved in politics through her advocacy of the ACT New Zealand party. ACT, established by Roger Douglas and his allies, promotes policies very close to those of Richardson. She has also a number of roles related to business and corporate governance, and served on a number of corporate boards. She is also a member of the Mont Pelerin Society, founded by economist Friedrich Hayek.

Canterbury University made her an honorary Doctor of Commerce in 2011.

<doc id="365200" wikidata="Q550994" url="?curid=365200" title="Duke of Silesia">
<text>The Duke of Silesia was the title of sons and descendants of the Polish Duke Bolesław III Wrymouth. In accordance with the last will and testament of Bolesław, upon his death his lands were divided into four or five hereditary provinces distributed among his sons, and a royal province of Kraków reserved for the eldest, who was to be High Duke of all Poland. This was known as the fragmentation of Poland. Subsequent developments lead to further splintering of the duchies.

At the beginning of the 14th century, fourteen independent Duchies existed in Silesia: Brzeg, Wrocław, Świdnica, Jawor, Ziębice, Głogów, Ścinawa, Żagan and Oleśnica in Lower Silesia; Koźle, Cieszyn, Bytom, Niemodlin, Opole, Strzelce, Racibórz and Opava in Upper Silesia and the ecclesiastical Duchy of Nysa. Between 1327 and 1329 most dukes accepted the overlordship of Bohemian king John of Bohemia, who acquired the right of succession for all of these duchies. In the coming centuries all branches of the Silesian Piasts died out, and with the death of George William, Duke of Liegnitz the dynasty ceased to exist.

== Duchy of Silesia ==

The Duchy of Silesia, one of the hereditary provinces of Poland, Silesia, was granted to Bolesław III&#x27;s eldest son, Władysław II the Exile, and was subsequently divided among his sons Bolesław I the Tall (Wrocław/Lower Silesia), Mieszko I Tanglefoot (Racibórz/Upper Silesia) and Konrad Spindleshanks (Głogów). After Konrad&#x27;s death Głogów was again united with the Duchy of Wrocław/Lower Silesia.

=== Partitions of Silesia ===

In 1173 Bolesław returned and he agreed to let Mieszko and Bolesław rule in their own Duchies, separated from the Duchy of Silesia. This led to the creation of the Duchy of Racibórz for Mieszko I and the Duchy of Opole for Jarosław, beginning the fragmentation of the Duchy of Silesia. The territories controlled by Mieszko I and Jarosław roughly corresponded to what is known as Upper Silesia, while the territories remaining with Bolesław I roughly corresponded to Lower Silesia.
==== Lower Silesia ====

Duchy of Lower Silesia was a direct continuation of the Duchy of Silesia, but without the territories roughly corresponding to Upper Silesia; hence it was composed of the territories roughly corresponding to Lower Silesia. Some sources refer to it as the Duchy of Silesia; some as Duchy of Lower Silesia; others yet as the Duchy of Wrocław (Breslau). Wrocław was the capital of the Duchy of Silesia, yet this early (1172–1248) Duchy of Silesia should not be confused with the smaller Duchy of Wrocław that was created with further fragmentation in 1248.
The Duchy went through various border changes in the coming years, sometimes losing and sometimes gaining territory. In 1248 Lower Silesia was divided when Bolesław II had to cede the Duchy of Wrocław to his younger brother Henry III.
==== Upper Silesia ====

Upper Silesia was divided into the Duchies of Cieszyn, and Opole-Racibórz. In 1340 the Duchy of Racibórz was united with Opava, a Bohemian fief.

<text>USS &quot;Hancock&quot; (CV/CVA-19) was one of 24 s built during World War II for the United States Navy. &quot;Hancock&quot; was the fourth US Navy ship to bear the namesake of Founding Father John Hancock, president of the Second Continental Congress and first governor of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. &quot;Hancock&quot; was commissioned in April 1944 and served in several campaigns in the Pacific Theater of Operations, earning four battle stars. Decommissioned shortly after the end of the war, she was modernized and recommissioned in the early 1950s as an attack carrier (CVA). In her second career, she operated exclusively in the Pacific, playing a prominent role in the Vietnam War, for which she earned a Navy Unit Commendation. She was the first US Navy carrier to have steam catapults installed. She was decommissioned in early 1976 and sold for scrap later that year.

==Construction and commissioning==
The ship was laid down as &quot;Ticonderoga&quot; on 26 January 1943 by Bethlehem Steel Co., Quincy, Massachusetts and subsequently renamed &quot;Hancock&quot; on 1 May 1943. This renaming was done in response to an offer from the John Hancock Life Insurance Company to conduct a special bond drive to raise money for the ship if that name was used. (The shipyard at Quincy was in the company&#x27;s home state.) CV-14, originally laid down as &quot;Hancock&quot; and under construction at the same time in Newport News, Virginia, took the name &quot;Ticonderoga&quot; instead.

The company&#x27;s bond drive raised enough money to both build the ship and operate her for the first year. The ship was launched 24 January 1944 by Juanita Gabriel-Ramsey, the wife of Rear Admiral DeWitt Clinton Ramsey, Chief of the Bureau of Aeronautics. &quot;Hancock&quot; was commissioned 15 April 1944, with Captain Fred C. Dickey in command.

==Service history==

===World War II===

After fitting out in the Boston Navy Yard and shake-down training off Trinidad and Venezuela, &quot;Hancock&quot; returned to Boston for alterations on 9 July 1944. She departed Boston on 31 July en route to Pearl Harbor via the Panama Canal and San Diego, and from there sailed on 24 September to join Admiral W. F. Halsey&#x27;s 3rd Fleet at Ulithi on 5 October. She was assigned to Rear Admiral Gerald F. Bogan&#x27;s Carrier Task Group 38.2 (TG 38.2).

The following afternoon, &quot;Hancock&quot; sailed for a rendezvous point west of the Marianas where units of Vice Admiral Mitscher&#x27;s Fast Carrier Task Force 38 (TF 38) were to raid Japanese air and sea bases in the Ryūkyūs, Formosa, and the Philippines, to limit Japanese air power during the invasion of Leyte.

====Philippines campaign====


The armada arrived off the Ryukyu Islands on 10 October 1944, with &quot;Hancock&quot;&#x27;s aircraft claiming seven enemy aircraft destroyed on the ground and assisting in the sinking of a submarine tender, 12 torpedo boats, 2 midget submarines, 4 cargo ships, and a number of sampans.

Formosan air bases were targeted on 12 October. &quot;Hancock&quot;″s pilots claimed six Japanese aircraft and nine more on the ground. She also reported one cargo ship sunk, three probably destroyed, and several others damaged.

During an enemy air raid that evening, &quot;Hancock&quot;″s gunners accounted for a Japanese aircraft during seven hours of uninterrupted general quarters. The following morning her aircraft resumed their assault, knocking out ammunition dumps, hangars, barracks, industrial plants ashore and damaging an enemy transport. As Japanese aircraft again attacked the Americans during their second night off Formosa, &quot;Hancock&quot;″s antiaircraft fire claimed another raider which crashed about off her flight deck.

As the American ships withdrew a large force of Japanese aircraft approached the American fleet. One dropped a bomb off &quot;Hancock&quot;″s port bow a few seconds before being hit by the carrier&#x27;s guns and crashing into the sea. Another bomb penetrated a gun platform but exploded in the water. The task force sailed toward the Philippines to support the landings at Leyte.

On 18 October, she launched aircraft against airfields and shipping at Laoag, Aparri, and Camiguin Island in Northern Luzon. Her aircraft struck the islands of Cebu, Panay, Negros, and Masbate, airfields and shipping. The next day, she retired toward Ulithi with Vice Admiral John S. McCain, Sr.&#x27;s TG 38.1.

She received orders on 23 October to turn back to the area off Samar to assist in the search for units of the Japanese fleet reportedly closing Leyte to challenge the American fleet, and to destroy amphibious forces which were struggling to take the island. &quot;Hancock&quot; did not reach Samar in time to assist the escort carriers and destroyers of &quot;Taffy 3&quot; during the main action of the Battle off Samar, but her aircraft did manage to attack the retreating Japanese Center Force as it passed through the San Bernardino Strait. &quot;Hancock&quot; then rejoined Rear Admiral Bogan&#x27;s Task Group with which she struck airfields and shipping in the vicinity of Manila on 29 October 1944. During operations through 19 November, her aircraft gave support to advancing Army troops and attacked Japanese shipping over a area. She became flagship of the Fast Carrier Task Force (TF 38) on 17 November 1944 when Admiral McCain came on board.

Unfavorable weather prevented operations until 25 November, when a &quot;kamikaze&quot; targeted &quot;Hancock&quot;, diving out of the sun. Antiaircraft fire destroyed the aircraft some above the ship, but a section of its fuselage landed amidships, and a part of the wing hit the flight deck and burst into flames. The fire was extinguished without major damage.

&quot;Hancock&quot; returned to Ulithi on 27 November and departed from that island with her task group to maintain air patrol over enemy airfields on Luzon to prevent &quot;kamikaze&quot; attacking amphibious vessels of the landing force in Mindoro. The first strikes were launched on 14 December against Clark and Angeles City Airfields as well as enemy ground targets on Salvador Island. The next day her aircraft attacked installations at Masinloc, San Fernando, and Cabanatuan, while fighter patrols limited Japanese attacks. Her aircraft also attacked shipping in Manila Bay.

&quot;Hancock&quot; encountered Typhoon Cobra on 17 December 1944, in waves which broke over her flight deck, some above her waterline. She put into Ulithi 24 December and got underway six days later to attack airfields and shipping around the South China Sea. Her aircraft struck at Luzon airfields on 7–8 January 1945 and turned their attention back to Formosa on 9 January, hitting airfields and the Toko Seaplane Station. An enemy convoy north of Camranh Bay, Indochina was the next target, with two ships sunk and 11 damaged. That afternoon &quot;Hancock&quot; launched strikes against airfields at Saigon and shipping on the northeastern bulge of French Indochina. Strikes by the fast and mobile carrier force continued through 16 January, hitting Hainan Island in the Gulf of Tonkin, the Pescadores Islands, and shipping in the harbor of Hong Kong. Raids against Formosa were resumed on 20 January. The next afternoon one of her aircraft returning from a sortie made a normal landing, taxied to a point abreast of the island before disintegrating in an explosion which killed 50 men and injured 75 others. Damage control work brought the fires under control in time to land the other aircraft of the same flight. She returned to formation and launched strikes against Okinawa the next morning. &quot;Hancock&quot; reached Ulithi on 25 January, where Admiral McCain left the ship and relinquished command of the 5th Fleet.

====Iwo Jima and Okinawa====
She sortied with the ships of her task group on 10 February and launched strikes against airfields in the vicinity of Tokyo on 16 February. On that day, her air group, Air Group 80, claimed 71 enemy aircraft and 12 more the following day. Her aircraft attcked enemy naval bases at Chichi Jima and Haha Jima on 19 February, as part of a raid to isolate Iwo Jima from air and sea support during American landing. &quot;Hancock&quot; took station off this island to provide tactical support through 22 February, attacking enemy airfields and strafing Japanese troops ashore.

Returning to waters off the Japanese home islands, &quot;Hancock&quot; launched her aircraft against targets on northern Honshū, making a diversionary raid on the Nansei-shoto islands on 1 March before returning to Ulithi on 4 March 1945.

Back in Japanese waters, &quot;Hancock&quot; joined other carriers in strikes against Kyūshū airfields, southwestern Honshū and shipping in the Inland Sea of Japan on 18 March. &quot;Hancock&quot; was refueling the destroyer on 20 March when &quot;kamikazes&quot; attacked the task force. One aircraft dove for the two ships but was distroyed by gunfire when about overhead. Fragments of the aircraft hit &quot;Hancock&quot;″s deck while its engine and bomb crashed the fantail of the destroyer. &quot;Hancock&quot;″s gunners shot down another aircraft as it neared the release point of its bombing run on the carrier.

&quot;Hancock&quot; was reassigned to Carrier TG 58.3 with which she struck the Nansei-shoto islands from 23 to 27 March and Minami Daito Island and Kyūshū at the end of the month.

&quot;Hancock&quot; provided close air support for the landing of the US 10th Army on the western coast of Okinawa on 1 April. On 7 April a &quot;kamikaze&quot; struck her flight deck and hitting a group of aircraft while its bomb hit the port catapult; 62 men were killed and a further 71 wounded but the fires were put out within half an hour and she was back in action inside an hour.

&quot;Hancock&quot; was detached from her task group on 9 April and steamed to Pearl Harbor for repairs. She sailed back into action 13 June and attacked Wake Island on 20 June en route to the Philippines. &quot;Hancock&quot; sailed from San Pedro Bay with the other carriers on 1 July and attacked Tokyo airfields on 10 July. She continued to operate in Japanese waters until she received confirmation of Japan&#x27;s capitulation on 15 August 1945 when she recalled her aircraft from their missions before they reached their targets. However aircraft of her photo division were attacked by seven enemy aircraft over Sagami Wan. Three were claimed shot down and a fourth damaged. Later that afternoon aircraft of &quot;Hancock&quot;″s air patrol shot down a Japanese torpedo plane as it dived on a British task force. Her aircraft flew missions over Japan in search of prison camps, dropping supplies and medicine, on 25 August. Information collected during these flights led to landings under command of Commodore R. W. Simpson which brought doctors and supplies to all Allied prisoner of war encampments.

====End of the war====
When the formal surrender of the Japanese government was signed on board battleship , &quot;Hancock&quot;″s aircraft flew overhead. The carrier entered Tokyo Bay on 10 September 1945 and sailed on 30 September embarking 1,500 passengers at Okinawa for transportation to San Pedro, California, where she arrived on 21 October. &quot;Hancock&quot; was fitted out for Operation Magic Carpet duty at San Pedro and sailed for Seeadler Harbor, Manus, Admiralty Islands on 2 November. On her return voyage, she carried 4,000 passengers who were debarked at San Diego on 4 December. A week later &quot;Hancock&quot; departed for her second &quot;Magic Carpet&quot; voyage, embarking 3,773 passengers at Manila for return to Alameda, California, on 20 January 1946. She embarked Air Group 7 at San Diego on 18 February for air operations off the coast of California. She sailed from San Diego on 11 March to embark men of two air groups and aircraft at Pearl Harbor for transportation to Saipan, arriving on 1 April. After receiving two other air groups on board at Saipan, she loaded a cargo of aircraft at Guam and steamed by way of Pearl Harbor to Alameda, arriving on 23 April. She then steamed to Seattle, Washington, on 29 April to await inactivation. The ship was decommissioned and entered the reserve fleet at Bremerton, Washington.

===Postwar career===
&quot;Hancock&quot; commenced the SCB-27C conversion and modernization to an attack aircraft carrier in Puget Sound 15 December 1951 and was reclassified CVA-19 on 1 October 1952. She recommissioned on 15 February 1954, Captain W. S. Butts in command. She was the first carrier of the United States Fleet with steam catapults capable of launching high-performance jets. The modernization cost $60 million ($ today). She was off San Diego on 7 May 1954 for operations along the coast of California that included 17 June launching of the first aircraft to take off a United States carrier by means of a steam catapult. After a year of operations along the Pacific coast that included testing of Sparrow I and Regulus missiles and Cutlass jet aircraft, she sailed on 10 August 1955 for 7th Fleet operations ranging from the shores of Japan to the Philippines and Okinawa.

She returned to San Diego on 15 March 1956 and decommissioned on 13 April for her SCB-125 conversion that included the installation of an angled flight deck. &quot;Hancock&quot; recommissioned on 15 November 1956 for training out of San Diego until 6 April 1957, when she again sailed for Hawaii and the Far East. She returned to San Diego on 18 September 1957 and again departed for Japan on 15 February 1958. She was a unit of powerful carrier task groups taking station off Taiwan when the Nationalist Chinese islands of Quemoy and Matsu were threatened with Communist invasion in August 1958. The carrier returned to San Francisco on 2 October for overhaul in the San Francisco Naval Shipyard, followed by rigorous at-sea training out of San Francisco. On 1 August 1959, she sailed to reinforce the 7th Fleet as troubles in Laos demanded the watchful presence of powerful American forces in water off southeast Asia. She returned to San Francisco on 18 January 1960 and put to sea early in February to participate in the Communication Moon Relay project, a new demonstration of communications by reflecting ultra-high frequency waves off the moon. She again departed in August to steam with the 7th Fleet in waters off Laos until lessening of tension in that area permitted operations ranging from Japan to the Philippines.

&quot;Hancock&quot; returned to San Francisco in March 1961, then entered the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard for an that gave her new electronics gear and many other improvements. She again set sail for Far Eastern waters on 2 February 1962, patrolling in the South China Sea as crisis and strife mounted both in Laos and in South Vietnam. She again appeared off Quemoy and Matsu in June to stem a threatened Communist invasion there, then trained along the coast of Japan and in waters reaching to Okinawa. She returned to San Francisco on 7 October, made a brief cruise to the coast of Hawaii while qualifying pilots then again sailed on 7 June 1963 for the Far East.

&quot;Hancock&quot; joined in combined defense exercises along the coast of South Korea, then deployed off the coast of South Vietnam after the coup which resulted in the death of President Diem. She entered the Hunter&#x27;s Point Naval Shipyard on 16 January 1964 for modernization that included installation of a new ordnance system, hull repairs, and aluminum decking for her flight deck. She celebrated her 20th birthday on 2 June while visiting San Diego. The carrier made a training cruise to Hawaii, then departed Alameda on 21 October for another tour of duty with the 7th Fleet in the Far East.

===Vietnam War===

&quot;Hancock&quot; reached Japan on 19 November and soon was on patrol at Yankee Station in the Gulf of Tonkin. She remained active in Vietnamese waters until heading for home early in the spring of 1965. November found the carrier steaming back to the war zone. She was on patrol off Vietnam on 16 December; and, but for brief respites at Hong Kong, the Philippines, or Japan, &quot;Hancock&quot; remained on station launching her planes for strikes at enemy positions ashore until returning to Alameda on 1 August 1966. Her outstanding record during this combat tour won her the Navy Unit Commendation.

Following operations off the West Coast, &quot;Hancock&quot; returned to Vietnam early in 1967 and resumed her strikes against Communist positions. After fighting during most of the first half of 1967, she returned to Alameda on 22 July and promptly began preparations for returning to battle.

In the summer of 1969, she was back in Alameda preparing for yet another deployment to southeast Asia. In July, while in pre-deployment night landing exercises, an F-8 came in too low and crashed into the round-down splitting the aircraft into two pieces which hurtled down the deck and erupted in a massive fuel-fed fire. While there were no deaths, damage to the flight deck was extensive, resulting in a frenetic 24 × 7 repair effort to be ready by the deployment date.

Aircraft from &quot;Hancock&quot;, along with those from and , joined with other planes for air strikes against North Vietnamese missile and antiaircraft sites south of the 19th parallel in response to attacks on unarmed U.S. reconnaissance aircraft on 21–22 November 1970 (Operation Freedom Bait). &quot;Hancock&quot; alternated with &quot;Ranger&quot; and on Yankee Station until 10 May 1971, when she was relieved by .

&quot;Hancock&quot;, along with , was back on Yankee Station by 30 March 1972 when North Vietnam invaded South Vietnam. In response to the invasion, Naval aircraft from &quot;Hancock&quot; and other carriers flew tactical sorties during Operation Freedom Train against military and logistics targets in the southern part of North Vietnam. By the end of April, the strikes covered more areas in North Vietnam throughout the area below 20°25′ N. From 25 to 30 April 1972, aircraft from &quot;Hancock&quot;″s VA-55, VA-164, VF-211 and VA-212 struck enemy-held territory around Kontum and Pleiku.

On 17 March 1975 &quot;Hancock&quot; was ordered to offload her air wing. On arrival at Subic Bay, she offloaded CAG 21. On 26 March, Marine Heavy Lift Helicopter Squadron HMH-463 comprising 25 CH-53, CH-46, AH-1J and UH-1E helicopters embarked on &quot;Hancock&quot; and then proceeded to Subic Bay to offload the other half of CAG 21. After taking on more helicopters at Subic Bay, &quot;Hancock&quot; was temporarily assigned to Amphibious Ready Group Bravo, standing by off Vung Tau, South Vietnam, but on 11 April she joined Amphibious Ready Group Alpha in the Gulf of Thailand. &quot;Hancock&quot; then took part in Operation Eagle Pull, the evacuation of Phnom Penh on 12 April 1975 and Operation Frequent Wind, the evacuation of Saigon on 29–30 April 1975. From 12 to 14 May, she was alerted, although not utilized, for the recovery of SS &quot;Mayagüez&quot;, a US merchantman with 39 crew, seized in international waters on 12 May by the Communist Khmer Rouge.

===Decommissioning===
&quot;Hancock&quot; was decommissioned on 30 January 1976. She was stricken from the Navy list the following day, and sold for scrap by the Defense Reutilization and Marketing Service (DRMS) on 1 September 1976. By January 1977, ex-&quot;Hancock&quot; was being scrapped in Los Angeles harbor and artifacts were being sold to former crew members and the general public, including items ranging from portholes to the anchor chain. The Associated Press noted that some of the scrap metal from the World War II-serving aircraft carrier would be sold to Japan to manufacture automobiles.

<text>The Eurasian bullfinch, common bullfinch or bullfinch (Pyrrhula pyrrhula) is a small passerine bird in the finch family, Fringillidae. In Anglophone Europe it is known simply as the bullfinch (English regional, Shropshire: plum bird), as it is the original bird to bear the name bullfinch.

==Taxonomy and systematics==

The Eurasian bullfinch was formally described in 1758 by Linnaeus in the 10th edition of his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; under the binomial name &quot;Loxia pyrrhula&quot;. It is now placed in the genus &quot;Pyrrhula&quot; that was introduced in 1760 by the French zoologist Mathurin Jacques Brisson. The Latin word comes from the Greek (a flame-coloured bird, from , from : Pyrrha), a &#x27;worm eating bird&#x27; that is mentioned by Aristotle. The Latin name for the Eurasian bullfinch had been used in 1555 by the Swiss naturalist Conrad Gessner in his &quot;Historiae animalium&quot;.

===Subspecies===
Ten subspecies are recognised:
* &quot;P. p. pileata&quot; MacGillivray, W, 1837 – British Isles
* &quot;P. p. pyrrhula&quot; (Linnaeus, 1758) – north, south central and east Europe across to central Siberia 
* &quot;P. p. europaea&quot; Vieillot, 1816 – Western Europe
* &quot;P. p. iberiae&quot; Voous, 1951 – southwest France, northern Iberian Peninsula
* &quot;P. p. rossikowi&quot; Derjugin &amp; Bianchi, 1900 – northeast Turkey and the Caucasus
* &quot;P. p. cineracea&quot; Cabanis, 1872 (Baikal bullfinch) – west Siberia and northeast Kazakhstan to east Siberia and northeast China
* &quot;P. p. caspica&quot; Witherby, 1908 – Azerbaijan and north Iran
* &quot;P. p. cassinii&quot; Baird, SF, 1869 – east Siberia
* &quot;P. p. griseiventris&quot; Lafresnaye, 1841 (Grey-bellied bullfinch) – Kuril Islands and north Japan
* &quot;P. p. rosacea&quot; Seebohm, 1882 – Sakhalin (island north of Japan)

The Azores bullfinch (&quot;P. murina&quot;), previously regarded as a subspecies of the Eurasian bullfinch, is now recognised as a separate species.

==Description==
The Eurasian bullfinch is a bulky bull-headed bird. The upper parts are grey; the flight feathers and short thick bill are black; as are the cap and face in adults (they are greyish-brown in juveniles), and the white rump and wing bars are striking in flight. The adult male has a distinctive rich red chest and underparts, but females and young birds have grey-buff feathers instead. It moults between July and October, but males do not have the duller autumn plumage that is typical of some other finches. The song of this unobtrusive bird contains fluted whistles, and is often described as &quot;mournful&quot;. This Bullfinch&#x27;s usual call is a quiet, low, melancholy whistled &quot;&quot; or &quot;pew&quot;. The song is audible only at close range. It is a weak, scratchy warbling, alternating with soft whistles. Tamed bullfinches can be taught to repeat specific melodies.

==Distribution and habitat==
This bird breeds across Europe and temperate Asia. It is mainly resident, but many northern birds migrate further south in the winter. Mixed woodland with some conifers is favoured for breeding, including parkland and gardens.

==Behaviour and ecology==
This species does not form large flocks outside the breeding season, and is usually seen as a pair or family group.

It builds its nest in a bush, (preferably more than four metres tall and wide), mature stands of scrub, or tree, laying four to seven pale blue eggs which are mottled with red-brown. It is peculiar among the Passeriformes for having spermatozoa with a rounded head and a blunt acrosome. This species produces two or three broods per season, from early May to mid-July. Nesting success increases progressively from April–May to June–July and August.

==Food and feeding==



The food is mainly seeds and buds of fruit trees, which can make it a pest in orchards: in England, for centuries every parish paid a bounty for every Eurasian bullfinch killed. Ash and hawthorn are favoured in autumn and early winter. If wild bird cover is planted for it, kale, quinoa and millet are preferred, next to tall hedges or woodland.

<text>The Belly of an Architect is a 1987 drama film written and directed by Peter Greenaway, featuring original music by Glenn Branca and Wim Mertens. Starring Brian Dennehy and Chloe Webb, it was nominated for the Palme d&#x27;Or (Golden Palm) award at the 1987 Cannes Film Festival.

==Plot==
American architect Stourley Kracklite has been commissioned to construct an exhibition in Rome dedicated to the architecture of the 18th-century French architect, Étienne-Louis Boullée, who until the 20th century remained little known. Kracklite&#x27;s Italian colleagues express doubts about whether Boullée really belongs in the architectural pantheon; they note that few of his buildings were ever constructed and observe that Boullée was an inspiration for Adolf Hitler&#x27;s architect Albert Speer.

As he works on the exhibition, Kracklite&#x27;s marriage and health deteriorate. He becomes obsessed with Caesar Augustus, the first emperor of the Roman Empire, after hearing that Augustus&#x27;s wife, Livia, supposedly poisoned him. Suffering from recurrent stomach pains, he suspects his much younger wife, Louisa, of trying to do the same. Louisa reveals that she is pregnant with Kracklite&#x27;s child, conceived at the precise moment their train crossed the Italian border. Meanwhile, she has become sexually involved with Caspasian Speckler, the younger co-organiser of the exhibition. We learn that Caspasian has also been siphoning off funds from the exhibition, even as he and his Italian associates undermine Kracklite&#x27;s authority and confidence. Kracklite himself is seduced by Caspasian&#x27;s sister Flavia, a photographer in her apartment across from the Palazzo della Civiltà Italiana. The two are discovered in flagrante by Caspasian, who threatens to tell Louisa.

Louisa leaves Kracklite, who is diagnosed with stomach cancer and given only months to live. The film ends at the exhibition&#x27;s opening ceremony, nine months after their arrival in Italy. Kracklite, now replaced as director by Caspasian, watches from a high vantage point as Louisa cuts the tape. As she suddenly goes into labor, Kracklite jumps to his death.

<doc id="365213" wikidata="Q81970" url="?curid=365213" title="Flag of Hungary">
<text>The national flag of Hungary () is a horizontal tricolour of red, white and green. In this exact form, it has been the official flag of Hungary since 23 May 1957. The flag&#x27;s form originates from national republican movements of the 18th and 19th centuries, while its colours are from the Middle Ages. The current Hungarian tricolour flag is the same as the republican movement flag of the United Kingdom (used since 1816) and the colours in that form were already used at least since the coronation of Leopold II in 1790, predating the first use of the Cispadane Republic&#x27;s tricolour in 1797.

==Current flag==
The modern flag of Hungary originated from the national freedom movement from before 1848, which culminated in the Hungarian Revolution of 1848. The revolution was not only in opposition against the monarchy but also the Habsburg Empire, as well as to form an independent republic. Accordingly, the flag of Hungary features a tricolour element which is based on the flag of France as a reflection of the ideas of the French Revolution of 1848; while red, white, and green are colours derived from the historical Hungarian coat of arms, which have essentially remained in the same form since the mid-15th century, with exception to some minor differences, and were marshalled from arms that first appeared in the late 12th and early 13th century as arms of the Árpáds, Hungary&#x27;s founding dynasty. The stripes are horizontal rather than vertical to prevent confusion with the Italian flag despite the banner in that form predating the Italian tricolour by at least 7 years but unlike in Italy, the Italians adopted it as the flag of an Italian state in 1797. According to other data, but no evidence of, the recent form of the Hungarian tricolour had been already used from 1608 at the coronation of Mathias II of Hungary and following coronations.
Folklore of the romantic period attributed the colours to virtues: red for strength, white for faithfulness and green for hope. Alternatively, red for the blood spilled for the fatherland, white for freedom and green for the land, for the pastures of Hungary. The new constitution, which took effect on 1 January 2012, makes the &quot;ex-post&quot; interpretation mentioned first official (in the semi-official translation: strength (&quot;erő&quot;), fidelity (&quot;hűség&quot;) and hope (&quot;remény&quot;)).

===Evolution===
As described above, the red, white and green tricolour clearly emerged as a sign of national sovereignty during the 1848–1849 revolution against the Habsburgs. Hungarian volunteers and Émigrés fought for the social movement and wars of Italian unification under the banner for Garibaldi. After the revolution in Hungary was defeated, the tricolour flag was prohibited by the Austrian Emperor. After the Compromise of 1867, however, the tricolour became not only legal, but also the official flag of Hungary. The flag had the so-called &quot;minor arms&quot; (also known as the Kossuth coat of arms) of Hungary with archangels as supporters were used as a badge on the flag. This configuration was used until the end of the Habsburg Empire in 1918.

After the fall of the Habsburg Empire, the years 1918 to 1920 were highly turbulent, and several hard-to-trace minor changes took place. The red-green-white tricolour stayed the same, but small differences emerged in terms of the badge. A short interlude and exception was the 1919 Hungarian Soviet Republic, which lasted for four-and-a-half months; it used a solid red banner.

It seems that from 1920 to 1944–1945 the tricolour displayed the &quot;minor arms&quot; of Hungary, but the version without them was also used.

Between 1946 and 1949 the crown was removed from the top of the arms serving as the badge.

With the onset of Communist rule in 1949, a new coat of arms featuring a Communist red star was placed on the flag as the badge.

During the anti-Soviet uprising in 1956, revolutionaries cut out the Hammer and Wheat emblem and used the resulting tricolour with a hole in the middle as the symbol of the revolution. For some months the new government changed the flag to bear the &quot;minor arms&quot; without the crown as the badge again.

In 1957, after the revolution was defeated by the Soviet Red Army, the new government created a &quot;new&quot; coat of arms, which however was never officially put onto the flag. Therefore, the official flag of Hungary has been a pure red-white-green tricolour since 1957.

After the fall of communism in 1989 there was no need to change the flag, as like the flags of Poland and Czechoslovakia, it did not bear any communist insignia.

There was a recommendation of the Committee of Symbols in the 2000s, that the coat of arms should be part of the state flag, while the national flag should remain plain (as is the status quo). This has not been implemented in law, though in case of most state use the arms are legally permitted on the flag (see below).

===Exact description and legislature===
The Hungarian Constitution does not explicitly state anything about the width:length ratio of the flag; but, there is a law from 1957 that is in force stating that seagoing merchant vessels shall hoist the red, white and green tricolour in 2:3 ratio.

By a government decree from 2000, the ratio (which is neither defined in the Constitution nor in 1995 or 2000 legislation) of flags used on government building is 1:2.

Summarized, this would mean:
* A red–white–green tricolour. Actually many variations might be used though according to 1995/LXXXIII §11 (3) &quot;(3) In cases specified in paragraphs (1) and (2), the arms and the flag can be used also in their historical forms.&quot;, as (1) reads as: 1995/LXXXIII §11 (1) &quot;(1) For the purpose of declaring their belonging to the nation, private persons can use the arms and the flag, subject to the limitations in this law.&quot;
* red–white–green tricolour, ratio 1:2 (by decree from 2000). According to 1995/LXXXIII §11 (4), the official coat of arms of Hungary might be placed onto it as a badge.
* White background with green red alternated flammulette (&quot;flame tongues&quot;, triangles with wavy edge) border, coat of arms in the center, embraced by oak branches from the left, olive branches from the right. Ratio not defined. ( 1995/LXXXIII §8 (1) )
* 2:3 (ratio defined by 1957 law) red-white-green tricolour (there is a merchant fleet)
* Unknown or unspecified;
* White background with green red alternated triangle border, coat of arms at 1/3 of the flag, nearer to the pole. Ratio not defined. ( 1995/LXXXIII §8 (2) )

<doc id="365217" wikidata="Q174088" url="?curid=365217" title="Hawfinch">
<text>The hawfinch (Coccothraustes coccothraustes) is a passerine bird in the finch family Fringillidae. It is the only species placed in the genus Coccothraustes. Its closest living relatives are the genus &quot;Eophona&quot; of East Asia, and &quot;Hesperiphona&quot; of Central and North America.

This bird breeds across Europe and temperate Asia (Palearctic). It is mainly resident in Europe, but many Asian birds migrate further south in the winter. It is a rare vagrant to the western islands of Alaska.

Deciduous or mixed woodland, including parkland, with large trees – especially hornbeam – is favoured for breeding. The hawfinch builds its nest in a bush or tree, and lays 2–7 eggs. The food is mainly seeds and fruit kernels, especially those of cherries, which it cracks with its powerful bill. This large finch species is usually seen in a pair or small group.

The 16.5–18 cm long hawfinch is a bulky bull-headed bird, which appears very short-tailed in flight. Its head is orange-brown with a black eyestripe and bib, and a massive bill, which is black in summer but paler in winter. The upper parts are dark brown and the underparts orange.

The white wing bars and tail tip are striking in flight. The sexes are similar. The call is a hard &quot;chick&quot;. The song of this unobtrusive bird is quiet and mumbled.

==Taxonomy==
The hawfinch was described and illustrated by Swiss naturalist Conrad Gesner in his &quot;Historiae animalium&quot; in 1555.
He used the Latin name &quot;Coccothraustes&quot; which is derived from the Greek: &quot;kokkos&quot; is a seed or kernel and &quot;thrauō&quot; means to break or to shatter. In 1758 Carl Linnaeus included the species in the 10th edition of his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; under the binomial name &quot;Loxia coccothraustes&quot;. The hawfinch was moved to a separate genus &quot;Coccothraustes&quot; by the French zoologist Mathurin Jacques Brisson in 1760. The English name &#x27;hawfinch&#x27; was used by the ornithologist Francis Willughby in 1676. Haws are the red berries of the common hawthorn (&quot;Crataegus monogyna&quot;). 

Molecular phylogenetic studies have shown that the hawfinch is closely related to other grosbeaks in the &quot;Eophona&quot;, &quot;Hesperiphona&quot; and &quot;Mycerobas&quot; genera. Finches with large beaks in the &quot;Rhynchostruthus&quot; and &quot;Rhodospiza&quot; genera are not closely related. The similar bill morphology is the result of convergence due to the similar feeding behaviour.

Fossil record:
*&quot;Coccothraustes balcanicus&quot; (Late Pliocene/Late Villafranchian of Slivnitsa, western Bulgaria)
*&quot;Coccothraustes simeonovi&quot; (Late Pliocene/Middle Villafranchian of Varshets, western Bulgaria)

There are six recognised subspecies:
* &quot;C. c. coccothraustes&quot; (Linnaeus, 1758) – Europe to central Siberia and northern Mongolia
* &quot;C. c. buvryi&quot; Cabanis, 1862 – Northwest Africa
* &quot;C. c. nigricans&quot; Buturlin, 1908 – southern Ukraine, the Caucasus, northeastern Turkey and northern Iran
* &quot;C. c. humii&quot; Sharpe, 1886 – southern Kazakhstan, eastern Uzbekistan and northeastern Afghanistan
* &quot;C. c. schulpini&quot; Johansen, H, 1944 – southeastern Siberia, northeastern China and Korea
* &quot;C. c. japonicus&quot; Temminck &amp; Schlegel, 1848 – the Kamchatka Peninsula, the Kuril Islands, Sakhalin and Japan

==Description==

The hawfinch has an overall length of , with a wingspan that ranges from . It weighs with the male being on average slightly heavier than the female. It is a robust bird with a thick neck, large round head and a wide, strong conical beak with a metallic appearance. It has short pinkish legs with a light hue and it has a short tail. It has brown eyes.
The plumage of the female is slightly paler than that of the male. The overall colour is light brown, its head having an orange hue to it. Its eyes have a black circle around them, extending to its beak and surrounding it at its edge. Its throat is also black.
The sides of its neck, as well as the back of its neck, are gray. The upper side of its wings are a deep black colour. The wings also have three stripes from approximately the middle till their sides: a white, a brown and a blue stripe.
Adults moults between July and September.

==Distribution and habitat==

The hawfinch is distributed in the whole of Europe, Eastern Asia (Palearctic including North Japan), and North Africa (Morocco, Tunisia and Algeria). It has also been sighted in Alaska, but this is reported as an accidental presence.
It is not found in Iceland, parts of the British Isles, or certain Mediterranean islands. It is however found in southern Europe, such as in Spain and Bulgaria, as well as in central Europe, including parts of England and southern Sweden. The hawfinch&#x27;s range has extended further north since the 1950s, and is now found as far north as Northern Norway.
In Asia it can be found in the Caucasus, northern Iran, Afghanistan, Turkistan, Siberia, Manchuria and North Korea.

The hawfinch typically inhabits deciduous forests during the spring to have offspring, often in trees that bear fruit, such as oak trees. They also incur into human areas, such as parks and gardens. They can also be found in pine woods, as long as there is a source of water in the vicinity.
During autumn and winter they seek food-providing forests, especially those with cherry and plum trees. As for height, the hawfinch is present in any altitude up to that which is limited by the size of the trees.

===British Isles===
In the 18th century, the hawfinch was recorded as only a rare winter visitor in Britain. The first breeding record was early in the 19th century; by the early 1830s, a well-documented colony was established at Epping Forest in Essex, and breeding was also recorded in other counties east and south of London. Further expansion of the range continued through the 19th and 20th centuries, with breeding occurring as far north as Aberdeenshire by 1968–1972. Peak numbers were in the period 1983–1990. Subsequently, there has been a significant decline of between 37% and 45% between 1990–1999.

Southeastern England is the stronghold of the hawfinch in Britain. One well-known site is Bedgebury Pinetum, where flocks gather to roost in winter. The species is also found in the New Forest; a central roost site exists here, at the Blackwater Arboretum. The only Sussex stronghold is at Westdean Woods in West Sussex, while in Surrey they are regularly seen at Bookham Common in winter. Formerly, hawfinches were regularly encountered in the Windsor Great Park area in winter, though no sizeable gatherings have been reported since the mid-1990s. The recent (2007–11) BTO Bird Atlas shows no evidence of the hawfinch breeding anywhere in this area; the reasons why are unclear.

In Devon (southwestern England), the hawfinch is largely confined to the upper Teign Valley. In western England and Wales, two areas in which hawfinches reliably occur are the Forest of Dean and the Wyre Forest. In Eastern England, the hawfinch is present in the Breckland of East Anglia. In northern England, hawfinches are regularly found in a small number of locations. Prime sites include Fountains Abbey in Yorkshire and Hulne Park in Northumberland.
Hawfinches can be seen at Cromford (Derbyshire) near the canal and the parish church, Rufford Abbey (Nottinghamshire) near the car-park, and at Clumber Park (Nottinghamshire) near the chapel. In Scotland, Scone Palace near Perth is the most well-known site in Scotland for hawfinches. Formerly, they also occurred in the Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh. In Ireland, they are an annual winter visitor in small numbers: they are most often seen at Curraghchase Forest Park in County Limerick, where a flock of between 15 and 30 birds occurs each winter. A few birds also turn up in Dublin most years.

==Behaviour and ecology==
The hawfinch is a shy species, and therefore difficult to observe and study. It spends most of the day on top of high branches, above all during breeding season. During the course of the hawfinch&#x27;s life it can only be seen on the ground while looking for seeds or drinking water, always near trees.
While drinking and eating it is fairly aggressive and dominant, towards both its same species or different ones, even bigger birds.
It guards a quite small territory when its chicks are born; however, when not bearing any offspring it is known to guard entire woods. This is interpreted as an evolutionary advantage, given colony rearing is seen as safer against nest predators.

===Breeding===

Hawfinches first breed when they are 1 year old. They are monogamous, with a pair-bond that sometimes persists from one year to the next. Pair-formation takes place before the breakup of the wintering flocks. The date for breeding is dependent on the spring temperature and is earlier in southwest Europe and later in the northeast. In Britain, most clutches are laid between late April and late June.

Hawfinches engage in an elaborate series of courtship routines. The two birds stand apart facing one another and reach out to touch their bills. The male displays to the female by standing erect, puffing out the feathers on his head, neck and chest and allowing his wings to droop forward. He then makes a deep bow. The male will also lower a wing and move it in a semi-circular arc, revealing his wing bars and modified wing feathers.
The breeding pairs are usually solitary, but they occasionally breed in loose groups. The nest is normally located high in a tree on a horizontal branch with easy access from the air. The male chooses the site of the nest and builds a layer of dry twigs. After a few days, the female takes over. The nest is untidy and is formed of a bulky twig base and a shallow cup lined with roots, grasses and lichens. The eggs are laid in early morning at daily intervals. The clutch is normally 4–5 eggs. There is considerable variable in the colour and shape of the eggs. They have purple brown and pale grey squiggles on a background that can be buff, grey-green or pale blueish. The average size is with a calculated weight of . The eggs are incubated for 11–13 days by the female. The nestlings are fed by both parents, who regurgitate seeds but also bring mouthfuls of caterpillars. Initially, the male normally passes the food to the female who feeds the chicks, but as they grow bigger both adults feed them directly. The female broods the chicks while they are in the nest. They fledge after 12–14 days and the young birds become independent of their parents around 30 days later. The parents generally only raise a single brood each year.

The hawfinch is highly unusual among cardueline finches in that the male bird chooses the nest site and starts the construction. In other species the female performs these roles. The hawfinch is also unusual in that the nest is kept clean by the parents removing the faecal sacs of the nestlings right up to the time when the chicks fledge. This behaviour is shared by the Eurasian bullfinch, but most finches cease to remove the faecal material after the first few days.

The annual survival rate is not known. The maximum age obtained from ring-recovery data is 12 years and 7 months for a bird in Germany.

===Feeding===
The hawfinch feeds primarily on hard seeds from trees, as well as fruit seeds, which it obtains with the help of its strong beak with accompanying jaw muscles. Its jaw muscles exert a force equivalent to a load of approximately 30–48 kg. Thus it can break through the seeds of cherries and plums. Other common sources of food include pine seeds, berries, sprouts and the occasional caterpillar and beetle. They can also break through olive seeds.
The bird is known to eat in groups, especially during the winter.

===Flight===
Its flight is quick and its trajectory is straight over short distances. During long flights periodical undulations can be observed in their flight pattern. While on the ground scavenging it hops, and they are quick to fly away at the slightest noise.
They are observed to catch insects mid-flight. They fly up to a height of 200 m and they are seen to fly in groups, as well as alone.

===Migration===
The hawfinch is a partial migrant, with northern flocks migrating towards the South during the winter, as shown by ringing techniques. These same studies showed that those hawfinches inhabiting habitats with a temperate climate would often have sedentary behaviour. A few migrants from northern Europe reach Britain in autumn and some are seen on the Northern Isles in spring.

==Status==
The European population of the hawfinch is estimated to be between 7,200,000 and 12,600,000 individuals. Assuming that the European range is between 25 percent and 49 percent of the global range, a tentative figure for the global population size is 14,700,000–50,400,000 individuals. States with large populations include Romania (500,000–1,000,000 pairs), Croatia (250,000–500,000 pairs) and Germany (200,000–365,000 pairs). Although the global population appears to be stable, the population within the United Kingdom underwent a 76 percent reduction between 1968 and 2011. In 2013 it was estimated that there were only 500–1000 breeding pairs. The reasons for this decline are not understood. Given the high numbers and huge breeding area, the hawfinch is classified by the International Union for Conservation of Nature as being of least concern.

<text>Castoridae is a family of rodents that contains the two living species of beavers and their fossil relatives. A formerly diverse group, only a single genus is extant today, &quot;Castor.&quot; Two other genera of &quot;giant beavers&quot;, &quot;Castoroides&quot; and &quot;Trogontherium,&quot; became extinct in the Late Pleistocene.

== Characteristics ==

Castorids are medium-sized mammals, although large compared with most other rodents. They are semiaquatic, with sleek bodies and webbed hind feet, and are more agile in the water than on land. Their tails are flattened and scaly, adaptations that help them manoeuvre in the water.
Castorids live in small family groups that each occupy a specific territory, based around a lodge and dam constructed from sticks and mud. They are herbivores, feeding on leaves and grasses in the summer, and woody plants such as willow in the winter. They have powerful incisors and the typical rodent dental formula: 

== Evolution ==
The earliest castorids belong to the genus &quot;Agnotocastor&quot;, known from the late Eocene and Oligocene of North America and Asia. Other early castorids included genera such as &quot;Steneofiber&quot;, from the Oligocene and Miocene of Europe, the earliest member of the subfamily Castorinae, which contains castorids closely related to living beavers. Their teeth were not well suited to gnawing wood, suggesting this habit evolved at a later point, but they do appear adapted to semiaquatic living. Later, such early species evolved into forms such as &quot;Palaeocastor&quot; from the Miocene of Nebraska. &quot;Palaeocastor&quot; was about the size of a muskrat, and dug corkscrew-shaped burrows up to deep.

Giant forms evolved in the Pleistocene, including &quot;Trogontherium&quot; in Europe, and &quot;Castoroides&quot; in North America. The latter animal was as large as a black bear, yet had a brain only marginally larger than that of modern beavers. Its shape suggests it would have been a good swimmer, and it probably lived in swampy habitats.

== Taxonomy ==
McKenna and Bell divided Castoridae into two subfamilies, Castoroidinae and Castorinae. More recent studies have recognized two additional subfamilies of basal castorids, Agnotocastorinae and Palaeocastorinae, which is followed here. Within the family, Castorinae and Castoroidinae are sister taxa; they share a more recent common ancestor with each other than with members of the other two subfamilies. Both subfamilies include semiaquatic species capable of constructing dams. The Palaeocastorinae include beavers that are interpreted as fossorial (burrowing), as are nothodipoidins and &quot;Migmacastor&quot;. The following taxonomy is based on Korth and Rybczynski, with preference given to the latter where these differ.

<text>Combat air patrol (CAP) is a type of flying mission for fighter aircraft. A combat air patrol is an aircraft patrol provided over an objective area, over the force protected, over the critical area of a combat zone, or over an air defense area, for the purpose of intercepting and destroying hostile aircraft before they reach their target. Combat air patrols apply to both overland and overwater operations, protecting other aircraft, fixed and mobile sites on land, or ships at sea.

Known by the acronym CAP, it typically entails fighters flying a tactical pattern around or screening a defended target, while looking for incoming attackers. Effective CAP patterns may include aircraft positioned at both high and low altitudes, in order to shorten response times when an attack is detected. Modern CAPs are either GCI or AWACS-controlled to provide maximum early warning for defensive reaction.

The first CAPs were characteristic of aircraft carrier operations, where CAPs were flown to protect a carrier battle group, but the term has become generic to both land-based and naval flight operations. Capping operations differ from fighter escorts in that the CAP force is not tied to the group it is protecting, is not limited in altitudes and speeds it flies, and has tactical flexibility to engage a threat. Fighter escorts typically stay with the asset they are supporting and at the speed of the supported group, as a final reactive force against a close threat. When an escort engages, the supported force is left unprotected.

==CAP types==
This section applies only to United States forces.
Numerous types of combat air patrols have been employed by US military forces since World War II:
* &quot;BARCAP&quot;: &quot;Barrier combat air patrol&quot;, in fleet terms, a mission flown between a carrier battle group and the direction from which it is most likely that an enemy attack will come. Also refers to fighter aircraft placed between a friendly strike force and an area of expected airborne threat, also known as a &quot;MiG screen&quot;.
* &quot;BATCAP&quot;: Evening combat air patrol
* &quot;CAP/Strike&quot;: Aircraft with a primary CAP role and a secondary strike role; such aircraft are permitted to jettison strike ordnance and actively pursue any enemy aircraft sighted, and are not restricted to defensive encounters.
* &quot;DADCAP&quot;: Dawn to dusk combat air patrol
* &quot;FastCAP&quot;: Combat air patrol to protect fighter strike aircraft.
* &quot;FORCAP&quot;: &quot;Force combat air patrol&quot;, a patrol of fighters maintained over the strike force, essentially an escort.
* &quot;HAVCAP&quot;: &quot;High asset value combat air patrol&quot;, flown to protect a &quot;high-value asset&quot; such as an AWACS or J-STARS aircraft, aerial refueling aircraft, or intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) aircraft during its specific time on station. Also called &quot;HVAACAP&quot; for &quot;high value airborne asset CAP&quot;.
* &quot;JACKCAP&quot;: Combat air patrol covering four quadrants with another outer screen
* &quot;MiGCAP&quot;: Used primarily during the Vietnam War, a MiGCAP is directed specifically against MiG aircraft. MiGCAP during Operation Linebacker became highly organized and threefold:
** an ingress MiGCAP of 2–3 flights (8–12 fighters) that preceded the first supporting forces such as chaff bombers or SAM suppressors and remained until they departed the hostile zone
** a target area MiGCAP of at least 2 flights that immediately preceded the actual strikers
** an egress MiGCAP of 1 or 2 flights that arrived on station at the projected exit point ten minutes prior to the earliest egress time. All egress MiGCAP flights were fully fueled from tankers and relieved the target area CAP.
* &quot;RAPCAP&quot;: Radar picket combat air patrol
* &quot;RESCAP&quot;: &quot;Rescue combat air patrol&quot;, a fighter force, often drawn from aircraft already in the area, used to protect personnel on the ground (such as downed pilots) from ground threats, as well as combat search and rescue aircraft or other rescue forces from both ground and air threats.
* &quot;SARCAP&quot;: &quot;Search and rescue combat air patrol&quot;, an earlier version of RESCAP.
* &quot;SCOCAP&quot;: Scouting combat air patrol
* &quot;Slow CAP&quot;: A combat air patrol to protect slower aircraft, such as the EA-3B / EKA-3B, P-3A / P-3B, EB-66 / RB-66, B-52, or EC-121 during the Vietnam War; replaced by &quot;HAVCAP&quot;.
* &quot;Strike/CAP&quot;: Aircraft with a primary strike role and a secondary air defense role, permitted to jettison strike ordnance and engage enemy aircraft only if directly attacked. Strike/CAP aircraft also have an egress CAP role once strike ordnance has been delivered on target.
* &quot;TARCAP&quot;: &quot;Target combat air patrol&quot; is flown over or near a strike target in order to protect specialized attack aircraft such as AC-130 gunships from enemy fighters.

<text>Te Rauparaha ( – 27 November 1849) was a Māori rangatira, warlord, and chief of the Ngāti Toa iwi. One of the most powerful military leaders of the Musket Wars, Te Rauparaha fought a war of conquest that greatly expanded Ngāti Toa southwards, receiving the epithet &quot;the Napoleon of the South&quot;. He remains one of the most prominent and celebrated New Zealand historical figures.

Born probably in the 1760s, Te Rauparaha&#x27;s conquests eventually extended Ngāti Toa authority from Miria-te-kakara at Rangitikei to Wellington, and across Cook Strait to Wairau and Nelson. He participated in land sale and negotiations with the New Zealand Company at the beginning of the colonisation of New Zealand. An early signatory to the Treaty of Waitangi, Te Rauparaha was later central to the Wairau Affray in the Marlborough district, considered by many to be the first of the conflicts in the New Zealand Wars. Shortly before he died he led the building of Rangiātea Church in Ōtaki.

Te Rauparaha transformed Ngāti Toa from a small tribe to one of the richest and most powerful in New Zealand, changing Māori tribal structures permanently. He was an accomplished composer of haka, with &quot;Ka Mate&quot; being well known due to its performance in sport. In 2005, a panel of historians and journalists ranked Te Rauparaha 16th out of the 100 most influential figures in New Zealand history.

== Early days ==
Te Rauparaha&#x27;s mother was Parekōwhatu (Parekōhatu) of the Ngāti Raukawa iwi and his father was Werawera of Ngāti Toa. It is said that he was a boy when James Cook visited New Zealand, in which case he was probably born in the 1760s. He was born either at Kāwhia or at Maungatautari, his mother&#x27;s home, in the Waikato valley, where he spent much of his childhood.

== Migration ==
In 1822 Ngāti Toa and related tribes were being forced out of their land around Kāwhia after years of fighting with various Waikato tribes often led by Te Wherowhero. Led by Te Rauparaha they began a fighting retreat or migration southwards (this migration was called Te-Heke-Tahu-Tahu-ahi), conquering hapū and iwi as they went south. This campaign ended with Ngāti Toa controlling the southern part of the North Island and particularly the strategically placed Kapiti Island, which became the tribal stronghold for a period. The conquests eventually extended Ngāti Toa authority from Miria-te-kakara at Rangitikei to Wellington, and across Cook Strait to Wairau and Nelson.

In 1824 an estimated 2,000 to 3,000 warriors, making up a coalition of tribes from the East Coast, Whanganui, the Horowhenua, southern Taranaki and Te Wai Pounamu (the South Island), assembled at Waikanae, with the object of taking Kapiti Island. Crossing in a flotilla of war canoes under cover of darkness, they were met as they disembarked by a force of Ngāti Toa fighters led or reinforced by Te Rauparaha. The ensuing Battle of Waiorua, at the northern end of the island, ended with the rout and slaughter of the landing attackers who were disadvantaged by difficult terrain and weather plus divided leadership. This decisive victory left Te Rauparaha and the Ngāti Toa able to dominate Kapiti and the adjacent mainland.

== Trade and further conquest ==
Following the Battle of Waiorua, Te Rauparaha began a series of almost annual campaigns into the South Island with the object in part of seizing the sources of the valuable mineral greenstone. Between 1827 and 1831 he was able to extend the control of Ngāti Toa and their allies over the northern part of the South Island. His base for these sea-based raids remained Kāpiti.

During this period Pākehā whaling stations became established in the region with Te Rauparaha&#x27;s encouragement and the participation of many Māori. Some Māori women married Pākehā whalers and a lucrative two-way trade of supplies for muskets was established, thereby increasing Te Rauparaha&#x27;s mana and military strength. By the early 1830s Te Rauparaha had defeated a branch of the Rangitane iwi in the Wairau Valley and gained control over that area. 

Te Rauparaha then hired the brig &quot;Elizabeth&quot;, captained by John Stewart, to transport himself and approximately 100 warriors to Akaroa Harbour with the aim of attacking the local tribe, Ngāi Tahu. Hidden below deck Te Rauparaha and his men captured the Ngāi Tahu chieftain Tamaiharanui, his wife and daughter when they boarded the brig at Stewart&#x27;s invitation. Several hundred of the Ngāi Tahu were killed on the &quot;Elizabeth&quot; or during a surprise landing the next morning. During the voyage back to Kāpiti the chief strangled his own daughter Nga Roimata, to save her from expected abuse. Te Rauparaha was incensed and following their arrival at Kapiti the parents and other prisoners were killed, Tamaiharanui after prolonged torture.

In 1831 he took the major Ngāi Tahu pā at Kaiapoi after a three-month siege, and shortly after took Onawe Pā in Akaroa Harbour, but these and other battles in the south were in the nature of revenge (&quot;utu&quot;) raids rather than for control of territory. Further conquests to the south were brought to a halt by a severe outbreak of measles and the growing strength of the southern hapu who worked closely with the growing European whaling community in coastal Otago and at Bluff.

A whaling captain John William Dundas Blenkinsop created a fraudulent deed of purchase for the Wairau Valley that was signed in October 1832 by proxy for Te Rauparaha by his brother Mahurenga. Te Rauparaha understood the document to be for water and timber from the Wairau for Blenkinsop, for a one-off payment of an 18-pound cannon. After this deed was purchased by the New Zealand Company it led to the Wairau Affray in 1843. When a party from Nelson tried to arrest Te Rauparaha and Te Rangihaeata (another Ngāti Toa chief) there was some fighting with loss of life. Twenty-two of the arresting party were killed, in part because of the death of Te Rongo, Te Rangihaeata&#x27;s wife. The subsequent government enquiry exonerated Te Rauparaha, which angered settlers, who began a campaign to have the governor Robert FitzRoy recalled.

== European settlement ==
The last years of Te Rauparaha&#x27;s life saw the most dramatic changes. On 16 October 1839 the New Zealand Company expedition commanded by Col William Wakefield arrived at Kapiti. They were seeking to buy vast areas of land with a view to forming a permanent European settlement. Te Rauparaha sold them some land in the area that became known later as Nelson and Golden Bay.

Te Rauparaha had requested that Rev. Henry Williams send a missionary and in November 1839 Octavius Hadfield travelled with Henry Williams, and Hadfield established an Anglican mission on the Kapiti Coast.

On 14 May 1840 Te Rauparaha signed a copy of the Treaty of Waitangi, believing that the treaty would guarantee him and his allies the possession of territories gained by conquest over the previous 18 years. On 19 June of that year, he signed another copy of the treaty, when Major Thomas Bunbury insisted that he do so.

==Capture==

In May 1846 fighting broke out in the Hutt Valley between settlers and Te Rauparaha&#x27;s nephew, Te Rangihaeata. Despite his declared neutrality, Te Rauparaha was arrested after the British captured secret letters from Te Rauparaha which showed he was playing a double game. He was charged with supplying weapons to Māori who were in open insurrection. He was captured near a tribal village Taupo Pā in what would later be called Plimmerton, by troops acting for the Governor, George Grey, and held without trial under martial law before being exiled to Auckland where he was held in the ship &quot;Calliope&quot;. 

His son, Tāmihana, was studying Christianity in Auckland and Te Rauparaha gave him a solemn message that their iwi should not take &quot;utu&quot; against the government. Tāmihana returned to his &quot;rohe&quot; to stop a planned uprising. Tāmihana sold the Wairau land to the government for 3,000 pounds. Grey spoke to Te Rauparaha and persuaded him to give up all outstanding claims to land in the Wairau valley. Then, realising that Te Rauparaha was old and sick, Grey allowed him to return to his people at Ōtaki in 1848.

== Rangiātea Church ==
In Ōtaki after his release from captivity, Te Rauparaha provided the materials and labour at his pā for the construction of Rangiātea Church, which was completed in 1851. It later became the oldest Māori church in the country. It was known for its unique mix of Māori and English church design. Te Rauparaha did not live to see the church completed.

== Death and legacy ==
Te Rauparaha died on 27 November 1849.

Te Rauparaha composed &quot;Ka Mate&quot; while hiding on Motuopihi Island in Lake Rotoaira as a celebration of life over death after his lucky escape from pursuing enemies. This haka or challenge, has become the most common performed by the Kiwis, the All Blacks and many other New Zealand sports teams before international matches.

Te Rauparaha&#x27;s son Tāmihana was strongly influenced by missionary teaching, especially Octavius Hadfield. He left for England in December 1850 and was presented to Queen Victoria in 1852. After his return he was one of the Māori to create the idea of a Māori king. However he broke away from the king movement and later became a harsh critic when the movement became involved with the Taranaki-based anti-government fighter Wiremu Kīngi Te Rangitāke.

Tāmihana wrote biography of Te Rauparaha between 1866 and 1869 that was held in the Sir George Grey Special Collections at Auckland Libraries. This biography was translated by Ross Calman and published by Auckland University Press in 2020 called &quot;He pukapuka tātaku i ngā mahi a&quot; &quot;Te Rauparaha nui / A record of the life of the great&quot; &quot;Te Rauparaha&quot;.

Another biography of Te Rauparaha was one published in the early 20th century. It was written by William Travers and was called the &quot;Stirring Times of Te Rauparaha&quot;.

A memorial to Te Rauparaha is established in Ōtaki and Te Rauparaha Arena in Porirua is named after him.

In 2005, a panel of historians and journalists ranked Te Rauparaha 16th out of the 100 most influential figures in New Zealand history.

<doc id="365237" wikidata="Q6582834" url="?curid=365237" title="Brennan (surname)">
<text>Brennan () is an Irish surname which is an anglicised form of two different Irish-language surnames: Ó Braonáin and Ó Branáin (or Mac Branáin). Historically, one source of the surname was the prominent clan Ua Braonáin (O&#x27;Brennan) of Uí Duach (Idough) in Osraige who were a junior Dál Birn sept stemming from a younger son of Cerball mac Dúnlainge (d.888). Recent surname evaluations highlighted the geographic consistency of this lineage in the barony of Idough. However, based on the ultimate authority of Dubhaltach Mac Fhirbhisigh they are out of Ui Dhuinn (O’Dunn) and, therefore, an Uí Failghi tribe, not Osraige. While it is clearly apparent that O’Hart&#x27;s pedigree is erroneous, it is suggested that Ó Cléirigh probably became confused while transcribing from Mac Fhirbhisigh. This is echoed by the modern scholar, Bart Jaski.

The Irish surname &quot;Ó Braonáin&quot;, means &quot;descendant of &quot;Braonán&quot;&quot;. The personal name &quot;Braonán&quot; is derived from a word which means &quot;moisture&quot;, &quot;drop&quot;. The Irish surname &quot;Ó Branáin&quot;, means &quot;descendant of &quot;Branán&quot;&quot;. The personal name &quot;Branán&quot; means &quot;little raven&quot;. &quot;Brennan&quot; is also a given name.

==Early life, studies and scientific activities==

Ferenc Mádl was born on 29 January 1931 in the village of Bánd in Veszprém County, Kingdom of Hungary into a Danube Swabian family .

From 1955 Mádl worked as a legal clerk and then as court secretary, then between 1956 and 1971 he worked as political and legal rapporteur at the Hungarian Academy of Sciences Central Office, later being promoted to head of department.

From 1991 he also fulfilled duties as government commissioner in connection with the Bős-Nagymaros hydroelectric power plant project. At the instigation of the government, in late 1992 an inter-portfolio committee was formed under his chairmanship to research those works of art illegally taken to the former Soviet Union from Hungary during and after the Second World War, with the aim of winning their return.

He took the post of chairman of the board of directors of the State Property Agency on 1 August 1990, and from 1992 he exercised, on the authority of the government, supervisory powers over the State Bank Supervisory Authority, at the same time being appointed chairman of the Bank Supervisory Authority Committee, a role he filled until February 1993.

<doc id="365239" wikidata="Q1309178" url="?curid=365239" title="Understudy">
<text>In theatre, an understudy, referred to in opera as cover or covering, is a performer who learns the lines and blocking or choreography of a regular actor, actress, or other performer in a play. Should the regular actor or actress be unable to appear on stage, the understudy takes over the part. Usually when the understudy takes over, the theater manager announces the cast change prior to the start of the performance. Coined in 1874, the term &quot;understudy&quot; has more recently generally been applied only to performers who can back up a role, but still regularly perform in another role.

==Similar tasks==
Performers who are only committed to covering a part and do not regularly appear in the show are often referred to as standbys and alternates. Standbys are normally required to sign in and remain at the theater the same as other cast members, although sometimes they may call in, until they are released by the production stage manager. If there is no doubt about the health of the actor being covered, or there are no hazardous stunts to perform, a standby may be released at the first intermission, if not before. At times, standbys are required to stay within a certain area around the theater (10 blocks in New York City is a common standard). Today, the standbys must also have a cell phone so that at any time they can be called to the theater.

Alternates, like standbys, do not have a regular role in the production, but they are scheduled to perform a physically and vocally challenging role for a certain number of performances each week. They commonly go on for matinee performances. Examples of this include the starring roles in &quot;Evita&quot;, &quot;Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark&quot;, &quot;Dear Evan Hansen&quot;, &quot;Les Misérables&quot;, &quot;Jekyll &amp; Hyde&quot;, and &quot;The Phantom of the Opera&quot;. 

In musical theater, the term swing is often used for a member of the company who understudies several chorus and/or dancing roles. If an understudy fills in for a lead role, a swing acts the parts normally performed by the understudy. A super swing or universal swing is a swing who commutes around the country as needed to act in various productions of a widespread show. The term &quot;super swing&quot; can also refer to a performer who understudies every role in a performance, most notably in performances with smaller casts such as Six. 

In contrast, a prompt cues an actor while not personally being on the stage or in the spotlight.

==Multiple understudies==
In some instances, multiple understudies are assigned to cover the same role and ranked by priority. If the principal actor is unable to perform, the role devolves to the highest-priority understudy who is available.

==Notable examples==
Several actors made their names in show business as understudies who took over leading actors’ roles for several performances. Examples include Anthony Hopkins for Laurence Olivier, when Olivier became ill with cancer during the run of the National Theater&#x27;s &quot;The Dance of Death&quot;, 1967; Ted Neeley and Carl Anderson for Jeff Fenholt and Ben Vereen respectively during the 1971 Broadway run of &quot;Jesus Christ Superstar&quot; when Neeley and Anderson were asked to star in the 1973 film version and subsequent tours; and Edward Bennett for David Tennant as &quot;Hamlet&quot; in the RSC&#x27;s 2008 production. Kerry Ellis was called to perform as Eliza Doolittle in &quot;My Fair Lady&quot; when Martine McCutcheon took ill. In the audience that day was Brian May, who was then writing his musical &quot;We Will Rock You&quot;, and he was so impressed with Ellis&#x27;s performance he immediately wanted to cast her as Meat, a lead in the show.

In 1974, baritone Thomas Allen fell ill during a performance at The Proms of Carl Orff&#x27;s &quot;Carmina Burana&quot;. His understudy was unable to take overhe was a medical doctor, and was attending to Allen. Patrick McCarthy, then unknown, stepped out of the audience, went backstage, and offered his services as a professional singer who knew the part. He received a standing ovation.

In 1978, Madeline Kahn departed the Broadway musical &quot;On the Twentieth Century&quot; nine weeks into its run. &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that &quot;she said she was withdrawing because of damage to her vocal cords.&quot; She was replaced by understudy Judy Kaye, who had been playing a small role, and the critics were invited to return. According to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;bang, boom, overnight [Kaye] is a star.&quot; They praised her performance, Kaye won a Theatre World Award, and her theatrical career took off. She later starred in the US tour opposite Rock Hudson.

In 2002 (and also in 2003, 2005 and 2006), Sam Moran had filled in for Greg Page in the children&#x27;s entertainment singing group the Wiggles during their concerts more than 150 times before stepping up as part of the official lineup in November 2006.

When Carol Haney broke her ankle while playing the role of Gladys in &quot;The Pajama Game&quot;, Shirley MacLaine assumed the role.

Arthur Stanley Jefferson, also known as Stan Laurel, was an understudy of Charlie Chaplin working for Fred Karno, a music hall impresario, before Laurel and Chaplin entered American film.

Roberto Alagna opened the 2006–07 season at La Scala on 7 December 2006 in the new production of &quot;Aida&quot; by Franco Zeffirelli. During the second performance on 10 December, Alagna, whose opening performance was considered ill-at-ease, was booed and whistled from the &quot;loggione&quot; (the least expensive seats at the very top of La Scala), and he walked off the stage. The role of Radames was taken over successfully for the rest of the performance by his understudy Antonello Palombi, who entered on stage wearing jeans and a black shirt.

During the 25th-anniversary performance of the Andrew Lloyd Webber musical &quot;The Phantom of the Opera&quot;, the titular character and Christine are played by understudies Simon Shorten and Katie Hall when they walk on a lowering walkway during the title song. In the film release of the performance, footage of the principal actors (in full costume) singing the song on the walkway was filmed in one rehearsal and added in the final cut.

<text>William Joseph Brennan Jr. (April 25, 1906 – July 24, 1997) was an American lawyer and jurist who served as an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States from 1956 to 1990. He was the seventh-longest serving justice in Supreme Court history, and was known for being a leader of the Court&#x27;s liberal wing.

Born in Newark to Irish immigrant parents, Brennan studied economics at the University of Pennsylvania and then attended Harvard Law School. He entered private legal practice in New Jersey and served in the U.S. Army during World War II. He was appointed in 1951 to the Supreme Court of New Jersey. Shortly before the 1956 presidential election, President Dwight D. Eisenhower used a recess appointment to place Brennan on the Supreme Court. Brennan won Senate confirmation the following year. He remained on the Court until his retirement in 1990, and was succeeded by David Souter.

On the Supreme Court, Brennan was known for his outspoken progressive views, including opposition to the death penalty as he dissented in more than 1,400 cases in which the Supreme Court refused to review a death sentence, and support for abortion rights and gay rights. He authored numerous landmark case opinions, including: &quot;Baker v. Carr&quot; (1962), establishing that the apportionment of legislative districts is a justiciable issue; &quot;New York Times Co. v. Sullivan&quot; (1964), which required &quot;actual malice&quot; in libel suits brought by public officials; &quot;Eisenstadt v. Baird&quot; (1972), which established a legal right to contraception for unmarried people and helped solidify the sexual revolution; and &quot;Craig v. Boren&quot; (1976) which established that laws which discriminate on the basis of sex are subject to heightened scrutiny under the Equal Protection Clause.

Due to his ability to shape a wide variety of opinions and bargain for votes in many cases, he was considered to be among the Court&#x27;s most influential members. Associate Justice Antonin Scalia, who served alongside Brennan between 1986 and 1990, called Brennan &quot;probably the most influential Justice of the [20th] century.&quot;

==Early life and education==
William J. Brennan Jr. was born on April 25, 1906, in Newark, New Jersey, the second of eight children. Both his parents, William and Agnes (McDermott) Brennan, were Irish immigrants. They met in the United States, although both were originally from County Roscommon in Ireland. William Brennan Sr. had little education and worked as a metal polisher, but rose to a position of leadership, serving as the Commissioner of Public Safety for the city of Newark from 1927 to 1930.

Brennan attended public schools in Newark, and graduated from Barringer High School in 1924. He then studied economics at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, graduating in 1928 with a Bachelor of Arts, &quot;cum laude&quot;. While there, he joined Delta Tau Delta fraternity. Brennan then attended Harvard Law School, where he was a member of the Harvard Legal Aid Bureau. He graduated in 1931 with a Bachelor of Laws ranked near the top of his class.

When he was 21, Brennan married Marjorie Leonard, whom he had met in high school. They eventually had three children: William III, Nancy, and Hugh.

==Early legal career and military service==
After graduating from Harvard Law School, Brennan entered private practice in his home state of New Jersey, where he practiced labor law at the firm of Pitney Hardin (which would later become Day Pitney). During World War II, Brennan was commissioned in the Army as a major in March 1942, and left as a colonel in 1946. He did legal work for the ordnance division and earned the Legion of Merit Award. In early 1946, he served as a staff member of the United States Undersecretary of War. Later that year, he returned to Pitney Hardin and continued his practice for the next three years. His partners added his name to the firm shortly after his return.

In 1949, Brennan was appointed to the Superior Court (a trial court) by Governor of New Jersey Alfred E. Driscoll. In 1951, Driscoll appointed him to the Supreme Court of New Jersey.

==Supreme Court==
===Supreme Court appointment===
Brennan was given a recess appointment as an associate justice of the United States Supreme Court by President Dwight D. Eisenhower on October 15, 1956, shortly before the 1956 presidential election, and was sworn into office the following day. The president&#x27;s advisers thought the appointment of a Roman Catholic Democrat from the Northeast would woo critical voters in the upcoming re-election campaign for Eisenhower, a Republican. Cardinal Francis Spellman had asked Eisenhower to appoint a Catholic to the court. Brennan was one of two candidates who met Eisenhower&#x27;s three criteria: experience on lower courts; relative youth and good health; and a Catholic.

Brennan gained the attention of Herbert Brownell, United States Attorney General and Eisenhower&#x27;s chief legal affairs adviser, when Brennan had to give a speech at a conference (as a substitute for New Jersey Supreme Court Chief Justice Arthur Vanderbilt). To Brownell, Brennan&#x27;s speech seemed to suggest a marked conservatism, especially on criminal matters.

His nomination, formally submitted to the Senate Judiciary Committee on January 14, 1957, faced a small amount of controversy from two angles. The National Liberal League opposed the nomination of a Catholic, thinking he would rely on his religious beliefs rather than the Constitution when ruling, and Senator Joseph McCarthy had read transcripts of Brennan&#x27;s speech where he decried overzealous anti-Communist investigations as &quot;witch-hunts.&quot; After a confirmation hearing in which Brennan defended himself against McCarthy&#x27;s attacks and proclaimed that he would rule solely on the basis of the Constitution and not on Church law, he was confirmed by a near-unanimous vote, with only Senator McCarthy voting against him.

Other factors playing into Brennan&#x27;s appointment were his status as a state court judge – no state judge had been appointed to the High Court since Benjamin N. Cardozo in 1932 – and Eisenhower&#x27;s desire to appear bipartisan after his appointments of two Republicans: Earl Warren (former Governor of California) and John Marshall Harlan II.

Brennan filled the seat vacated by Justice Sherman Minton. He held the post until his retirement on July 20, 1990, for health reasons; he was succeeded on the Court by Justice David Souter. He was the last federal judge in active service to have been appointed to his position by President Eisenhower. Brennan then taught at Georgetown University Law Center until 1994. With 1,360 opinions, he is second only to William O. Douglas in number of opinions written while a Supreme Court justice.

===Warren Court===
An outspoken liberal throughout his career, he played a leading role in the Warren Court&#x27;s expansion of individual rights. Brennan played a behind-the-scenes role during the Warren Court, coaxing more conservative colleagues to join the Court&#x27;s decisions. Brennan&#x27;s opinions with respect to voting (&quot;Baker v. Carr&quot;), criminal proceedings (&quot;Malloy v. Hogan&quot;), the free speech and establishment clauses of the First Amendment (&quot;Roth v. United States&quot;), and civil rights (&quot;Green v. County School Board of New Kent County&quot;) were some of the most important opinions of the Warren Era. Brennan&#x27;s role in expanding free speech rights under the First Amendment is particularly notable, as he wrote the Court&#x27;s opinion in 1964&#x27;s &quot;New York Times Co. v. Sullivan&quot;, which created constitutional restrictions on the law of libel. It was Brennan who coined the phrase &quot;chilling effect&quot;, in 1965&#x27;s &quot;Dombrowski v. Pfister&quot;. His close friendship with Chief Justice Warren, who frequently assigned Brennan the task of writing the majority opinion, led to the other justices nicknaming him the &quot;deputy Chief&quot;.

In the 1962–1963 term, one of Brennan&#x27;s law clerks was Richard A. Posner, who later became a founder of the field of Law and Economics and one of the most influential legal scholars in the United States.

===Burger and Rehnquist Courts===
On the less liberal Burger Court, Brennan was a staunch opponent of the death penalty and a supporter of abortion rights and joined the majority in landmark rulings on both issues (&quot;Furman v. Georgia&quot; (1972) on the death penalty and &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot; (1973) on abortion). With the departure of moderate Potter Stewart in 1981, the ascension of the most conservative member of the court, William Rehnquist, to the position of Chief Justice, following the retirement of Warren Burger, Brennan found himself more frequently isolated. At times, his opinions would be joined only by Thurgood Marshall since, by 1975, they were the last remaining liberals of the Warren Court. That like-mindedness led to both Brennan and Marshall&#x27;s clerks referring to them as &quot;Justice Brennan-Marshall&quot; in the face of the court&#x27;s heavy conservative opposition to the two. Brennan declared in &quot;Furman&quot; that he believed the death penalty violated the Eighth Amendment&#x27;s prohibition on &quot;cruel and unusual&quot; punishment, and for his remaining years on the bench, he and Marshall dissented from every case upholding the imposition of the death penalty. He was able to convince no other justice of this view, but Justice Harry Blackmun would eventually agree in 1994, after Brennan&#x27;s retirement.

Brennan authored three Supreme Court opinions holding that a plaintiff has a cause of action for money damages (compensatory and punitive) arising solely out of an alleged violation of the Bill of Rights. In &quot;Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents&quot;, Brennan so held with respect to the Unreasonable Search and Seizure clause of the Fourth Amendment. In &quot;Davis v. Passman&quot;, Brennan extended this rationale to the equal protection component of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment, in a suit for gender discrimination in employment against a former Congressman (Congressional staffers were explicitly excluded from Title VII of the Civil Rights Act). In &quot;Carlson v. Green&quot;, Brennan extended this rationale again to the Cruel and Unusual Punishment clause of the Eighth Amendment, in a suit by the estate of a deceased federal prisoner (even though the plaintiff also had a cause of action under the Federal Tort Claims Act).

During the same period, Brennan began to adopt and promote a coherent and expansive vision of personal jurisdiction. He authored the sole dissent in &quot;Helicopteros Nacionales de Colombia, S. A. v. Hall&quot;, defining minimum contacts very broadly for the purposes of general jurisdiction, and influential dissents and partial concurrences in &quot;World-Wide Volkswagen Corp. v. Woodson&quot; and &quot;Asahi Metal Industry Co. v. Superior Court&quot; on the subject of specific jurisdiction, holding to a simple &quot;stream-of-commerce&quot; analysis for product liability cases and emphasizing the role of fairness in the Court&#x27;s analysis of the holding in &quot;International Shoe Co. v. Washington&quot;. In &quot;Burger King v. Rudzewicz&quot;, Brennan authored the majority opinion and extended his broad view of personal jurisdiction to areas of business contracts and franchising. The upshot of Brennan&#x27;s analysis is an expansion of the jurisdiction of state courts, particularly over corporations; state courts are typically more sympathetic to small, weak plaintiffs than to large, powerful corporate defendants. In this process, he frequently clashed with Justice Scalia over this issue, and uncharacteristically dissented from Justice Marshall&#x27;s majority opinion on the subject in &quot;Shaffer v. Heitner&quot;.

In his penultimate and final terms on the Court, he wrote the controversial rulings for &quot;Texas v. Johnson&quot; and &quot;United States v. Eichman&quot;, respectively. In both cases, the Court held that the First Amendment protects desecration of the United States flag.

Brennan&#x27;s wife Marjorie died in December 1982. Slightly more than three months later, in March 1983 at age 76, he married Mary Fowler, who had served as his secretary for 26 years. Brennan&#x27;s colleagues learned of his second marriage via a short office memo stating, &quot;Mary Fowler and I were married yesterday and we have gone to Bermuda.&quot;

===Judicial philosophy===
Brennan strongly believed in the Bill of Rights, arguing early on in his career that it should be applied to the states in addition to the federal government. He often took positions in favor of individual rights against the state, favoring criminal defendants, minorities, the poor, and other underrepresented groups. Furthermore, he generally shied away from the absolutist liberal positions of Justices Hugo Black and William O. Douglas, being very amenable to compromise in order to win a majority of Justices. Brennan&#x27;s conservative detractors charged that he was a purveyor of judicial activism, accusing him of deciding outcomes before coming up with a legal rationale for them. At his retirement, Brennan said the case he thought was most important was &quot;Goldberg v. Kelly&quot;, which ruled that a local, state or federal government could not terminate welfare payments to a person without a prior individual evidentiary hearing.

In the 1980s, as the Reagan administration and the Rehnquist Court threatened to &quot;roll back&quot; the decisions of the Warren Court, Brennan became more vocal about his jurisprudential views. In a 1985 speech at Georgetown University, Brennan criticized Attorney General Edwin Meese&#x27;s call for a &quot;jurisprudence of original intention&quot; as &quot;arrogance cloaked as humility&quot; and advocated reading the U.S. Constitution to protect rights of &quot;human dignity&quot;.

Brennan was also less interested in &quot;stare decisis&quot; or the avoidance of &quot;absolutist&quot; positions where the death penalty was concerned, as he believed that the deliberate taking of human life by the state, as a punishment, was inherently cruel and unusual. Brennan and Thurgood Marshall, Brennan&#x27;s closest ally in the Court, concluded in &quot;Furman v. Georgia&quot; that the death penalty was, in all circumstances, unconstitutional, and never accepted the legitimacy of &quot;Gregg v. Georgia&quot;, which ruled that the death penalty was constitutional four years later. Thereafter, Brennan or Marshall took turns, joined by the other, in issuing a dissent in every denial of &quot;certiorari&quot; in a capital case, and from every decision in a case which the Court &quot;did&quot; take which failed to vacate a sentence of death.

Brennan also authored a dissent from the denial of &quot;certiorari&quot; in &quot;Glass v. Louisiana&quot;. In &quot;Glass&quot;, the Court chose not to hear a case that challenged the constitutionality of the use of the electric chair as a form of execution. Brennan wrote:

Th[e] evidence suggests that death by electrical current is extremely violent and inflicts pain and indignities far beyond the &quot;mere extinguishment of life&quot;. Witnesses routinely report that, when the switch is thrown, the condemned prisoner &quot;cringes,&quot; &quot;leaps,&quot; and &quot;fights the straps with amazing strength.&quot; &quot;The hands turn red, then white, and the cords of the neck stand out like steel bands.&quot; The prisoner&#x27;s limbs, fingers, toes, and face are severely contorted. The force of the electrical current is so powerful that the prisoner&#x27;s eyeballs sometimes pop out and &quot;rest on [his] cheeks.&quot; The prisoner often defecates, urinates, and vomits blood and drool.

Brennan concluded by stating that electrocution is &quot;nothing less than the contemporary technological equivalent of burning people at the stake.&quot; Despite his personal stance against the death penalty, Brennan implicitly acknowledged its current reality by offering his thoughts in other legal aspects of court cases, if capital punishment was to apply to the given case. In &quot;Strickland v. Washington&quot;, a case involving a capital defendant, although Brennan disagreed with keeping the verdict of death sentence, his concurrence agreed with the test for ineffective assistance of counsel that the majority opinion established. (Marshall dissented in this case, objecting to the new test and stating that the counsel in the trial was ineffective.)

Brennan voted with the majority in &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot; which legalized abortion nationally and helped craft the decision. Brennan wrote the majority opinion in &quot;Roth v. United States&quot; which set new standards for obscenity laws, allowing some prosecutions, but drastically loosening the laws overall. He later reversed his position in dissent in &quot;Miller v. California&quot; arguing that obscenity laws were unconstitutional. Although Brennan joined the majority in &quot;United States v. O&#x27;Brien&quot; which upheld the constitutionality of laws banning draft card burning, he later opposed the Vietnam War and dissented several times when the Supreme Court refused to hear challenges to its legality. In a dissent in &quot;San Antonio Independent School District v. Rodriguez&quot; Brennan argued that unequal funding of poor and wealthy school districts violated the Equal Protection Clause.

Brennan supported gay rights. In a dissent from a denial of certiorari in 1985 involving a lesbian teacher fired for her sexual orientation, Brennan publicly criticized homophobia, writing &quot;Homosexuals have historically been the object of deep and sustained pernicious hostility, and it is fair to say that discrimination against homosexuals is likely to reflect deep-seated prejudice rather than rationality.&quot; He joined the dissent in &quot;Bowers v. Hardwick&quot;, which allowed states to prosecute consensual homosexual sodomy, a decision which the Court announced in June 1986.

He is regarded as one of the most liberal justices in the history of the court.

== Later life and death ==

Brennan&#x27;s retirement in 1990 was precipitated by a mild stroke. While he initially intended to continue serving, his doctors told him that he would be at risk of a more debilitating stroke if he kept working.

Throughout retirement, Brennan maintained a friendly relationship with his successor, David Souter. In 1995, the Brennan Center for Justice opened at New York University, a research institute created at the initiative of several of Brennan&#x27;s former clerks, and named in his honor.

In November 1996, Brennan fell and broke his hip, and underwent rehabilitation for the injury at a nursing home in Arlington, Virginia, where he died on July 24, 1997, at the age of 91. He was buried at Arlington National Cemetery, beside his first wife and near the gravesites of other Supreme Court justices.

==Honors and awards==
As a result of his long and distinguished career on the United States Supreme Court, Brennan was honored with many different awards. In 1969, he was awarded the Laetare Medal by the University of Notre Dame, considered the most prestigious award for American Catholics. In 1987, Brennan received the U.S. Senator John Heinz Award for Greatest Public Service by an Elected or Appointed Official, an award given out annually by Jefferson Awards. In 1989, the historic Hudson County Courthouse in Jersey City, New Jersey, which had opened in 1910, was renamed the William J. Brennan Court House in his honor and, in that same year, he received the Freedom Medal. On November 30, 1993, President Bill Clinton presented Brennan with the Presidential Medal of Freedom.

Upon his death, Brennan lay in repose in the Great Hall of the United States Supreme Court Building.

Years after his death, in 2010, Brennan was inducted into the New Jersey Hall of Fame and William J. Brennan High School was founded in San Antonio, Texas, honoring him. Brennan Park across from the historic Essex County Veterans Courthouse in Newark, New Jersey, was named in Brennan&#x27;s honor and a statue of him was erected in front of the Essex County Hall of Records by historian Guy Sterling.

<doc id="365245" wikidata="Q1391996" url="?curid=365245" title="William O. Douglas">
<text>William Orville Douglas (October 16, 1898January 19, 1980) was an American jurist who served as an associate justice of the Supreme Court of the United States from 1939 to 1975. Douglas was known for his strong progressive and civil libertarian views and is often cited as the U.S. Supreme Court&#x27;s most liberal justice ever. Nominated by President Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1939, Douglas was confirmed at the age of 40, becoming one of the youngest justices appointed to the court. In 1975, &quot;Time&quot; called Douglas &quot;the most doctrinaire and committed civil libertarian ever to sit on the court.&quot; He is the longest-serving justice in history, having served for 36 years and 209 days.

After an itinerant childhood, Douglas attended Whitman College on a scholarship. He graduated from Columbia Law School in 1925 and joined the Yale Law School faculty. After serving as the third chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, Douglas was successfully nominated to the Supreme Court in 1939, succeeding Justice Louis Brandeis. He was among those seriously considered for the 1944 Democratic vice presidential nomination and was subject to an unsuccessful draft movement prior to the 1948 U.S. presidential election. Douglas served on the Court until his retirement in 1975 and was succeeded by John Paul Stevens. Douglas holds a number of records as a Supreme Court justice, including the most opinions.

Douglas&#x27;s notable opinions included &quot;Griswold v. Connecticut&quot; (1965)—which established the constitutional right to privacy, and was foundational to later cases such as &quot;Eisenstadt v. Baird&quot;, &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot;, &quot;Lawrence v. Texas&quot; and &quot;Obergefell v. Hodges&quot;—&quot;Skinner v. Oklahoma&quot; (1942), &quot;United States v. Paramount Pictures, Inc.&quot; (1948), &quot;Terminiello v. City of Chicago&quot; (1949), &quot;Brady v. Maryland&quot; (1963), and &quot;Harper v. Virginia State Board of Elections&quot; (1966). Douglas also served as an associate justice in the landmark civil rights case &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot; (1954), a Supreme Court case that outlawed segregation in American public schools. He wrote notable concurring or dissenting opinions in cases such as &quot;Dennis v. United States&quot; (1951), &quot;United States v. O’Brien&quot; (1968), &quot;Terry v. Ohio&quot; (1968), and &quot;Brandenburg v. Ohio&quot; (1969). He was also known as a strong opponent of the Vietnam War and an ardent advocate of environmentalism.

==Early life and education==
Douglas was born in 1898 in Maine Township, Otter Tail County, Minnesota, to William Douglas and Julia Bickford Fisk. Douglas&#x27;s father was a Scottish itinerant Presbyterian minister from Pictou County, Nova Scotia. The family first moved to California and then to Cleveland, Washington. Douglas said he suffered from an illness at age two that he described as polio, although a biographer reveals that it was intestinal colic. His mother attributed his recovery to a miracle, telling Douglas that one day he would be President of the United States.

His father died in Portland, Oregon in 1904, when Douglas was six years old. Douglas later claimed his mother had been left destitute. After moving the family from town to town in the West, his mother, with three young children, settled in Yakima, Washington. William, like the rest of the Douglas family, did odd jobs to earn extra money, and a college education appeared to be unaffordable. He was the valedictorian at Yakima High School and did well enough in school to earn a full academic scholarship to attend Whitman College in Walla Walla, Washington.

At Whitman, Douglas became a member of Beta Theta Pi fraternity. He worked at various jobs while attending school, including as a waiter and janitor during the school year, and at a cherry orchard in the summer. Picking cherries, Douglas would say later, inspired him to pursue a legal career. He once said of his early interest in the law: 

Douglas was inducted into Phi Beta Kappa, participated on the debate team, and was elected as student body president in his final year. After graduating in 1920 with a Bachelor of Arts degree in English and economics, he taught English and Latin at his old high school for the next two years, hoping to earn enough to attend law school. &quot;Finally,&quot; he said, &quot;I decided it was impossible to save enough money by teaching and I said to hell with it.&quot;

==Military service==
In the summer of 1918, Douglas took part in a U.S. Army Reserve Officers&#x27; Training Corps training encampment at the Presidio of San Francisco. That fall, he joined the Student Army Training Corps at Whitman as a private. He served from October to December, and was honorably discharged because the Armistice of November 11, 1918 ended the war and the army&#x27;s requirements for more soldiers and officers.

==Law school==
He traveled from Yakima to New York in 1922, taking a job tending sheep on a Chicago-bound train, in return for free passage, with hopes to attend the Columbia Law School. Douglas drew on his Beta Theta Pi membership to help him survive in New York, as he stayed at one of its houses and was able to borrow $75 from a fraternity brother from Washington, enough to enroll at Columbia. Six months later, Douglas&#x27;s funds were running out. The appointments office at the law school told him that a New York firm wanted a student to help prepare a correspondence course for law. Douglas earned $600 for his work, enabling him to stay in school. Hired for similar projects, he saved $1,000 by semester&#x27;s end.

In August 1923, Douglas traveled to La Grande, Oregon, to marry Mildred Riddle, whom he had known in Yakima. Douglas graduated second in his class at Columbia in 1925.

During the summer of 1925, Douglas started work at the firm of Cravath, DeGersdorff, Swaine and Wood (later Cravath, Swaine &amp; Moore) after failing to obtain a Supreme Court clerkship with Harlan F. Stone. Douglas was hired at Cravath by attorney John J. McCloy, who would later become the chairman of the Board of Chase Manhattan Bank.

==Yale Law School==
Douglas quit the Cravath firm after four months. After one year, he moved back to Yakima, but soon regretted the move and never practiced law in Washington. After a time of unemployment and another months-long stint at Cravath, he started teaching at Columbia Law School. In 1928, he joined the faculty of Yale Law School, where he became an expert on commercial litigation and bankruptcy law. He was identified with the legal realist movement, which pushed for an understanding of law based less on formalistic legal doctrines and more on the real-world effects of the law. Teaching at Yale, he and the fellow professor Thurman Arnold were riding the New Haven Railroad and were inspired to set the sign Passengers will please refrain... to Antonín Dvořák&#x27;s &quot;Humoresque #7.&quot; Robert Maynard Hutchins described Douglas as &quot;the most outstanding law professor in the nation.&quot; When Hutchins became president of the University of Chicago, Douglas accepted an offer to move there, but he changed his mind once he had been made a Sterling Professor at Yale.

==Securities and Exchange Commission==
In 1934, Douglas left Yale after President Franklin Roosevelt nominated him to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). By 1937, he had become an adviser and friend to the President and the chairman. He also became friends with a group of young New Dealers, including Tommy &quot;The Cork&quot; Corcoran and Abe Fortas. He was also close, both socially and in thinking to the Progressives of the era, such as Philip and Robert La Follette Jr. That social/political group befriended Lyndon Johnson, a freshman representative from the 10th District of Texas. In his 1982 book &quot;The Years of Lyndon Johnson: The Path to Power&quot;, Robert Caro wrote that in 1937, Douglas had helped to persuade Roosevelt to authorize the Marshall Ford Dam, a controversial project whose approval enabled Johnson to consolidate his power as a representative.

==Supreme Court==
In 1939, Justice Louis D. Brandeis retired from the Court, and Roosevelt nominated Douglas as his replacement on March 20. Douglas was Brandeis&#x27;s personal choice as a successor. Douglas later revealed that his appointment had been a great surprise to him (Roosevelt had summoned him to an &quot;important meeting&quot;), and Douglas feared that he would be named as the chairman of the Federal Communications Commission. He was confirmed by the United States Senate on April 4 by a vote of 62 to 4. The four negative votes were all cast by Republicans: Lynn J. Frazier, Henry Cabot Lodge Jr., Gerald P. Nye, and Clyde M. Reed. Douglas was sworn into office on April 17, 1939. At the age of forty, Douglas was the fifth-youngest justice to be confirmed to the Supreme Court.

===Relationships with others at Supreme Court===
Douglas was often at odds with fellow justice Felix Frankfurter, who believed in judicial restraint and thought the court should stay out of politics. Douglas did not highly value judicial consistency or &quot;stare decisis&quot; when deciding cases. &quot;But the origin of Douglas and Frankfurter&#x27;s deep-seated animosity went beyond important jurisprudential differences. Temperamentally, they were opposites. From the beginning of their close associations as justices, the two men simply grated on each other&#x27;s nerves. . . . Although in 1974 Douglas claimed that there had been no &#x27;war&#x27; between him and Frankfurter, the evidence to the contrary was overwhelming. Frankfurter and Douglas, two important American jurists whose decades-long bitter debates (indeed, whose &#x27;wars&#x27;) contributed a great deal to our understanding of constitutionalism in a modern society, could not tolerate each other. Intentionally and unintentionally, they went out of their way to harass each other for over two decades.&quot;

Judge Richard A. Posner, who was a law clerk for justice William J. Brennan Jr. during the latter part of Douglas&#x27;s tenure, characterized Douglas as &quot;a bored, distracted, uncollegial, irresponsible&quot; Supreme Court justice, as well as &quot;rude, ice-cold, hot-tempered, ungrateful, foul-mouthed, self-absorbed&quot; and so abusive in &quot;treatment of his staff to the point where his law clerks—whom he described as &#x27;the lowest form of human life&#x27;—took to calling him &quot;shithead&quot; behind his back.&quot; Posner asserts also that &quot;Douglas&#x27;s judicial oeuvre is slipshod and slapdash,&quot; but Douglas&#x27;s &quot;intelligence, his energy, his academic and government experience, his flair for writing, the leadership skills that he had displayed at the SEC, and his ability to charm when he bothered to try&quot; could have let him &quot;become the greatest justice in history.&quot; Brennan once stated that Douglas was one of only &quot;two geniuses&quot; he had met in his life (the other being Posner).

===Judicial philosophy===
In general, legal scholars have noted that Douglas&#x27;s judicial style was unusual in that he did not attempt to elaborate justifications for his judicial positions on the basis of text, history, or precedent. Douglas was known for writing short, pithy opinions which relied on philosophical insights, observations about current politics, and literature, as much as more conventional judicial sources. Douglas wrote many of his opinions in twenty minutes, often publishing the first draft. Douglas was also known for his fearsome work ethic, by publishing over thirty books and once telling an exhausted secretary, Fay Aull, &quot;If you hadn&#x27;t stopped working, you wouldn&#x27;t be tired.&quot;

Douglas frequently disagreed with the other justices, dissenting in almost 40% of cases, more than half of the time writing only for himself. Ronald Dworkin would conclude that because Douglas believed his convictions were merely &quot;a matter of his own emotional biases,&quot; Douglas would fail to meet &quot;minimal intellectual responsibilities.&quot; Ultimately, Douglas believed that a judge&#x27;s role was &quot;not neutral&quot; as &quot;The Constitution is not neutral. It was designed to take the government off the backs of the people.&quot;

Douglas has been widely characterized as a civil libertarian. On the bench, Douglas became known as a strong advocate of First Amendment rights. With fellow justice Hugo Black, Douglas argued for a &quot;literalist&quot; interpretation of the First Amendment, insisting that the First Amendment&#x27;s command that &quot;no law&quot; shall restrict freedom of speech should be interpreted literally. He wrote the opinion in &quot;Terminiello v. City of Chicago&quot; (1949), overturning the conviction of a Catholic priest who allegedly caused a &quot;breach of the peace&quot; by making anti-Semitic comments during a raucous public speech. Douglas, joined by Black, furthered his advocacy of a broad reading of First Amendment rights by dissenting from the Supreme Court&#x27;s decision in &quot;Dennis v. United States&quot; (1952), which affirmed the conviction of the leader of the U.S. Communist Party. Douglas was publicly critical of censorship, saying &quot;The way to combat noxious ideas is with other ideas. The way to combat falsehoods is with truth.&quot;

In 1944, Douglas voted with the majority to uphold the wartime internment of Japanese Americans in &quot;Korematsu v. United States&quot; after having initially planned to dissent, a vote he later regretted, but, over the course of his career, he grew to become a leading advocate of individual rights. He was suspicious of majority rule as it related to social and moral questions, and frequently expressed concern about forced conformity with &quot;the Establishment&quot;. For example, Douglas wrote the decision in &quot;Griswold v. Connecticut&quot; (1965) in stating that a constitutional right to privacy forbids state contraception bans because &quot;specific guarantees in the Bill of Rights have penumbras, formed by emanations from those guarantees that help give them life and substance.&quot; That went too far for Hugo Black, who dissented in &quot;Griswold&quot; despite having been allies with Douglas. Justice Clarence Thomas would years later hang a sign in his chambers reading, &quot;Please don&#x27;t emanate in the penumbras.&quot; Conservative Judge Robert Bork had no objection to the concept of penumbras, writing, &quot;There is nothing exceptional about [Douglas&#x27;s] thought, other than the language of penumbras and emanations. Courts often give protection to a constitutional freedom by creating a buffer zone, by prohibiting a government from doing something not in itself forbidden but likely to lead to an invasion of a right specified in the Constitution.&quot; Prof. David P. Currie of the University of Chicago Law School called Douglas&#x27;s &quot;Griswold&quot; opinion &quot;one of the most hypocritical opinions in the history of the Court.&quot;

Douglas and Black also disagreed in &quot;Fortson v. Morris&quot; (1967), which cleared the path for the Georgia State Legislature to choose the governor in the deadlocked 1966 race between Democrat Lester Maddox and Republican Howard Callaway. Whereas Black voted with the majority under strict construction to uphold the state constitutional provision, Douglas and Abe Fortas dissented. According to Douglas, Georgia tradition would guarantee a Maddox victory but he had trailed Callaway by some 3,000 votes in the general election returns. Douglas also saw the issue as a continuation of the earlier decision &quot;Gray v. Sanders&quot;, which had struck down Georgia&#x27;s County Unit System, a kind of electoral college formerly used to choose the governor. According to political scientists Andrew D. Martin and Kevin M. Quinn, he was by far the most liberal justice in the history of the Supreme Court with a Martin-Quinn score of -8 at his most liberal. He voted to strike down the death penalty in &quot;Furman v. Georgia&quot;, argued that the environment should be granted legal personhood, tried to declare the Vietnam War unconstitutional because Congress had never declared war, and generally showed an uncompromising defense of individual rights from which even stalwart liberals Brennan and Marshall shied away.

Douglas was notable as a public pre-Stonewall supporter of gay rights. Douglas dissented in Boutilier v. INS in which the Court ruled that gays and lesbians were included in the list of “psychopathic personalities” that Congress could deport, arguing that the term “psychopathic personality” was unconstitutionally vague, and even if it were not, not all gays and lesbians are psychopaths. In 1968, in a concurring opinion in the case of &quot;Flast v. Cohen&quot;, Douglas indicated that he did not believe in judicial restraint:

There has long been a school of thought here that the less the judiciary does, the better. It is often said that judicial intrusion should be infrequent, since it is &quot;always attended with a serious evil, namely, that the correction of legislative mistakes comes from the outside, and the people thus lose the political experience, and the moral education and stimulus that come from fighting the question out in the ordinary way, and correcting their own errors&quot;; that the effect of a participation by the judiciary in these processes is &quot;to dwarf the political capacity of the people, and to deaden its sense of moral responsibility.&quot; J. Thayer, John Marshall 106, 107 (1901).¶
The late Edmond Cahn, who opposed that view, stated my philosophy. He emphasized the importance of the role that the federal judiciary was designed to play in guarding basic rights against majoritarian control. ... His description of our constitutional tradition was in these words: &quot;Be not reasonable with inquisitions, anonymous informers, and secret files that mock American justice. Be not reasonable with punitive denationalizations, ex post facto deportations, labels of disloyalty, and all the other stratagems for outlawing human beings from the community of mankind. These devices have put us to shame. Exercise the full judicial power of the United States; nullify them, forbid them, and make us proud again.&quot; Can the Supreme Court Defend Civil Liberties? in Samuel, ed., Toward a Better America 132, 144 -145 (1968).

&quot;Critics have sometimes charged that [Douglas] was result oriented and guilty of oversimplification; those who understand how he thought, and who share his compassion, conscience, and sense of fair dealing, see him as courageous and farsighted.&quot; &quot;There is no necessary contradiction between these two views.&quot;

===Rosenberg case===
On June 17, 1953, Douglas granted a temporary stay of execution to Ethel and Julius Rosenberg, who had been convicted of selling the plans for the atomic bomb to the Soviet Union during the Cold War. The basis for the stay was that Judge Irving Kaufman had sentenced the Rosenbergs to death without the consent of the jury. While this was permissible under the Espionage Act of 1917, under which the Rosenbergs were tried, a later law, the Atomic Energy Act of 1946, held that only a jury could pronounce the death penalty. Since at the time the stay was granted the Supreme Court was out of session, this stay meant that the Rosenbergs could expect to wait at least six months before the case was heard.

When Attorney General Herbert Brownell heard about the stay, however, he immediately took his objection to Chief Justice Fred M. Vinson, who reconvened the Court before the appointed date and set aside the stay. Douglas had departed for vacation, but on learning of the special session of the Court, he returned to Washington. Because of widespread opposition to his decision, Douglas briefly faced impeachment proceedings in Congress but attempts to remove him from the Court went nowhere.

===Vietnam War===
Douglas took strong positions on the Vietnam War. In 1952, Douglas traveled to Vietnam and met with Ho Chi Minh. During the trip Douglas became friendly with Ngo Dinh Diem and in 1953 he personally introduced the nationalist leader to senators Mike Mansfield and John F. Kennedy. Douglas became one of the chief promoters for U.S. support of Diem, with CIA deputy director Robert Amory crediting Diem becoming &quot;our man in Indochina&quot; to a conversation with Douglas during a party at Martin Agronsky&#x27;s house.

After Diem&#x27;s assassination in November 1963, Douglas became strongly critical of the war, believing Diem had been killed because he &quot;was not sufficiently servile to Pentagon demands.&quot; Douglas now outspokenly argued the war was illegal, dissenting whenever the Court passed on an opportunity to hear such claims. In 1968 Douglas issued an order blocking the shipment of Army reservists to Vietnam, before the eight other justices unanimously reversed him.

In &quot;Schlesinger v. Holtzman&quot; (1973) Justice Thurgood Marshall issued an in-chambers opinion declining Rep. Elizabeth Holtzman&#x27;s request for a court order stopping the military from bombing Cambodia. The Court was in recess for the summer but the Congresswoman reapplied, this time to Douglas. Douglas met with Holtzman&#x27;s ACLU lawyers at his home in Goose Prairie, Washington, and promised them a hearing the next day. On Friday, August 3, 1973, Douglas held a hearing in the Yakima federal courthouse, where he dismissed the Government&#x27;s argument that he was causing a &quot;constitutional confrontation&quot; by saying, &quot;we live in a world of confrontations. That&#x27;s what the whole system is about.&quot; On August 4, Douglas ordered the military to stop bombing, reasoning &quot;denial of the application before me would catapult our airmen as well as Cambodian peasants into the death zone.&quot; The U.S. military ignored Douglas&#x27;s order. Six hours later the eight other justices reconvened by telephone for a special term and unanimously overturned Douglas&#x27;s ruling.

===&quot;Trees have standing&quot;===
Douglas was highly innovative in legal theory. For example, in his dissenting opinion in the landmark environmental law case &quot;Sierra Club v. Morton&quot;, 405 U.S. 727 (1972), Douglas argued that &quot;inanimate objects&quot; should have standing to sue in court:

He continued:

==Environmentalism==
Douglas was a lifelong mountaineer. In his autobiographical &quot;Of Men and Mountains&quot; (1950), Douglas discusses his close childhood connections with nature. In the 1950s, proposals were made to create a highway along the path of the C&amp;O Canal, which ran on the Maryland bank parallel to the Potomac River. &quot;The Washington Post&quot; editorial page supported the action. However, Douglas, who frequently hiked on the Canal towpath, opposed the plan and challenged reporters to hike the 185-mile length of the Canal with him. After the hike, the &quot;Post&quot; changed its stance and advocated preservation of the Canal in its historic state. Douglas is widely credited with saving the Canal and with its eventual designation as a National Historic Park in 1971. He served on the board of directors of the Sierra Club from 1960 to 1962 and wrote prolifically on his love of the outdoors. In 1962, Douglas wrote a glowing review of Rachel Carson&#x27;s book &quot;Silent Spring&quot;, which was included in the widely-read Book-of-the-Month Club edition.
He later swayed the Supreme Court to preserve the Red River Gorge in eastern Kentucky, when a proposal to build a dam and flood the gorge reached the Court. Douglas personally visited the area on November 18, 1967. The Red River Gorge&#x27;s Douglas Trail is named in his honor.

In May 1962, Douglas and his wife, Cathleen, were invited by Neil Compton and the Ozark Society to visit and canoe down part of the free flowing Buffalo River in Arkansas. They put in at the low water bridge at Boxley. That experience made him a fan of the river and the young organization&#x27;s idea of protecting it. Douglas was instrumental in having the Buffalo preserved as a free-flowing river left in its natural state. The decision was opposed by the region&#x27;s Corps of Army Engineers. The act that soon followed designated the Buffalo River as America&#x27;s first National River.
Douglas was a self-professed outdoorsman. According to &quot;The Thru-Hiker&#x27;s Companion&quot;, a guide published by the Appalachian Long Distance Hikers Association, Douglas hiked the entire trail from Georgia to Maine. His love for the environment carried through to his judicial reasoning. His interests in natural history are also reflected in the fact that he collected plant specimens for the herbarium of the University of Texas at Austin. They curate at least 14 vascular plant specimens collected by Douglas together with botanist Donovan Stewart Correll, Head of the Botanical Laboratory, Texas Research Foundation in February and June 1965. The specimens collected in February were from Presidio and Brewster Counties—several from Capote Falls. The specimens collected in June were from Blanco, Gillespie, and Llano Counties—near Austin, Texas. The Rocky Mountain Herbarium at the University of Wyoming curates a lichen collected by William O. Douglas in Snoqualmie National Forest.

Douglas&#x27;s active role in advocating the preservation and protection of wilderness across the United States earned him the nickname &quot;Wild Bill&quot;. Douglas was a friend and frequent guest of Harry R. Truman, the owner of the Mount St. Helens Lodge at Spirit Lake in Washington.

In 1967, on a hike to save Sunfish Pond on the Appalachian Trail in New Jersey, Douglas was accompanied by more than a thousand people. He said: &quot;It&#x27;s a vital element in the need to save some of our wilderness from the encroachment of civilization.&quot;

==Travel writing==

From 1950 to 1961, Douglas travelled extensively in the Middle East and Asia. Douglas wrote many books about his experiences and observations during these trips. Other than writers from &quot;National Geographic&quot;—whom he sometimes met on the road—Douglas was one of the few American travel writers to visit these remote regions during this period in time. His travel books include:
* &quot;Strange Lands and Friendly People&quot; (1950)
* &quot;Beyond the High Himalayas&quot; (1952)
* &quot;North From Malaya&quot; (1953)
* &quot;Russian Journey&quot; (1956)
* &quot;Exploring the Himalaya&quot; (1958)
* &quot;West of the Indus&quot; (1958)
* &quot;My Wilderness, The Pacific West&quot; (1960)
* &quot;My Wilderness, East to Katahdin&quot; (1961)

In his memoir, &quot;The Court Years&quot;, Douglas wrote that he was sometimes criticized for taking too much time off from the bench, and writing travel books while on the U.S. Supreme Court. However, Douglas maintained that the travel gave him a world-wide perspective that was helpful in resolving cases before the Court. It also gave him a perspective on political systems that did not benefit from the legal protections in the American Constitution.

==Presidential politics==

When, in early 1944, President Franklin D. Roosevelt decided not to support the renomination of Vice President Henry A. Wallace at the party&#x27;s national convention, a short list of possible replacements was drafted. The names on the list included former senator and Supreme Court justice James F. Byrnes of South Carolina, former senator (and future Supreme Court justice) Sherman Minton, former governor and high commissioner to the Philippines Paul McNutt of Indiana, House speaker Sam Rayburn of Texas, Senator Alben W. Barkley of Kentucky, Senator Harry S. Truman of Missouri, and Douglas.

Five days before the vice presidential nominee was to be chosen at the convention, on July 15, Committee chairman Robert E. Hannegan received a letter from Roosevelt stating that his choice for the nominee would be either &quot;Harry Truman or Bill Douglas&quot;. After Hannegan released the letter to the convention on July 20, the nomination went without incident, and Truman was nominated on the second ballot. Douglas received two votes on the second ballot and none on the first.

After the convention, Douglas&#x27;s supporters spread the rumor that the note sent to Hannegan had read &quot;Bill Douglas or Harry Truman&quot;, not the other way around. These supporters claimed that Hannegan, a Truman supporter, feared that Douglas&#x27;s nomination would drive Southern white voters away from the ticket (Douglas had a strong anti-segregation record on the Supreme Court) and had switched the names to suggest that Truman was Roosevelt&#x27;s real choice.

By 1948, Douglas&#x27;s presidential aspirations were rekindled by Truman&#x27;s low popularity, after he had succeeded Roosevelt in 1945. Many Democrats, believing that Truman could not be elected in November, began trying to find a replacement candidate. Attempts were made to draft popular retired General Dwight D. Eisenhower, a war hero, for the nomination. A &quot;Draft Douglas&quot; campaign, complete with souvenir buttons and hats, sprang up in New Hampshire and several other primary states. Douglas campaigned for the nomination for a short time, but he soon withdrew his name from consideration.

In the end, Eisenhower refused to be drafted, and Truman won nomination easily. Although Truman approached Douglas about the vice presidential nomination, the justice turned him down. Douglas&#x27;s close associate Tommy Corcoran was later heard to ask, &quot;Why be a number two man to a number two man?&quot; Truman selected Senator Alben W. Barkley and the two won the election.

==Impeachment attempts==
Political opponents made two unsuccessful attempts to remove Douglas from the Supreme Court.

===Rosenberg case===
On June 17, 1953, U.S. Representative William M. Wheeler of Georgia, infuriated by Douglas&#x27;s brief stay of execution in the Rosenberg case, introduced a resolution to impeach him. The resolution was referred the next day to the Judiciary Committee to investigate the charges. On July 7, 1953, the committee voted to end the investigation.

===1970 impeachment attempt fails===
Douglas maintained a busy speaking and publishing schedule to supplement his income. He became severely burdened financially because of a bitter divorce and settlement with his first wife. He sustained additional financial setbacks after divorces and settlements with his second and third wives.

Douglas became president of the Parvin Foundation. His ties to the foundation (which was financed by the sale of the infamous Flamingo Hotel by casino financier and foundation benefactor Albert Parvin) became a prime target for House Minority Leader Gerald Ford. Besides being personally disgusted by Douglas&#x27;s lifestyle, Ford was also mindful that Douglas&#x27;s protégé Abe Fortas was forced to resign because of ties to a similar foundation. Fortas would later say that he &quot;resigned to save Douglas,&quot; thinking that the dual investigations of himself and Douglas would stop with his resignation.

Some scholars have argued that Ford&#x27;s impeachment attempt was politically motivated. Those who support this contention note Ford&#x27;s well-known disappointment with the Senate over the failed nominations of Clement Haynsworth and G. Harrold Carswell to succeed Fortas. In April 1970, Ford moved to impeach Douglas in an attempt to hit back at the Senate. House Judiciary Chairman Emanuel Celler handled the case carefully and did not uncover evidence of any criminal conduct by Douglas. Attorney General John N. Mitchell and the Nixon administration worked to gather evidence against him. Ford moved forward with the proceedings.

The hearings began in late April 1970. Ford was the main witness, and attacked Douglas&#x27;s &quot;liberal opinions&quot;, his &quot;defense of the &#x27;filthy&#x27; film&quot;, the controversial Swedish film &quot;I Am Curious (Yellow)&quot; (1970), and his ties to Parvin. Douglas was also criticized for accepting $350 for an article he wrote on folk music in the magazine &quot;Avant Garde&quot;. Its publisher had served a prison sentence for the distribution of another magazine in 1966 that had been deemed obscene by some critics. Describing Douglas&#x27;s article, Ford stated, &quot;The article itself is not pornographic, although it praises the lusty, lurid, and risqué along with the social protest of left-wing folk singers.&quot; Ford also attacked Douglas for publishing an article in &quot;Evergreen Review&quot;, which he claimed was known to publish photographs of naked women. The Republican congressmen, however, refused to give the majority Democrats copies of the magazines described, prompting Congressman Wayne Hays to remark, &quot;Has anybody read the article – or is everybody over there who has a magazine just looking at the pictures?&quot; As it became clear that the impeachment proceedings would be unsuccessful, they were brought to a close without a public vote.

According to Joshua E. Kastenberg of the University of New Mexico School of Law, there were several purposes behind Ford&#x27;s and Nixon&#x27;s push to have Douglas impeached. First, while it was true that Nixon and Ford were angered at the Senate&#x27;s determination not to confirm Haynsworth and Carswell, Nixon had a deep-seated hatred of Douglas. An attempt to have Douglas impeached and then brought to a Senate trial would further cement the alleged &quot;Southern Strategy&quot;, as most of Ford&#x27;s congressional allies against Douglas were Southern Democrats. Additionally, Nixon and Kissinger had secretly planned for an April 30 – May 1 invasion of Cambodia and Nixon thought that there was a possibility of using a House investigation into Douglas to deflect news coverage. Professor Kastenberg notes in his recent book on the subject that Attorney General John Mitchell and his deputy, William Wilson, had promised Ford that the Central Intelligence Agency, the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Internal Revenue Service, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation had evidence of Douglas&#x27;s criminal conduct. In the end, however, none of these agencies had any evidence of wrongdoing by Douglas, but the promise led Ford to accuse Douglas of consorting with organized crime and Communists, and therefore of being a threat to national security.

Around this time, Douglas came to believe that strangers snooping around his Washington home were FBI agents, attempting to plant marijuana to entrap him. In a private letter to his neighbors, he said: &quot;I wrote you last fall or winter that federal agents were in Yakima and Goose Prairie looking me over at Goose Prairie. I thought they were merely counting fence posts. But I learned in New York City yesterday that they were planting marijuana with the prospect of a nice big TV-covered raid in July or August. I forgot to tell you that this gang in power is not in search of truth. They are &#x27;search and destroy&#x27; people.&quot;

==Judicial record-setter==
During his tenure on the Supreme Court, Douglas set a number of records, all of which still stand. He sat on the U.S. Supreme Court for more than thirty-six years (1939–75), longer than any other justice. During those years, he wrote some thirty books in addition to his opinions and dissenting opinions and gave more speeches than any other justice. Douglas had the most marriages (four) and the most divorces (three) of any justice serving on the bench.

==Nicknames==
During his time on the Supreme Court, Douglas picked up a number of nicknames from both admirers and detractors. The most common epithet was &quot;Wild Bill&quot; in reference to his independent and often-unpredictable stances and his cowboy-style mannerisms, but many of the latter were considered by some to be affectations for the consumption of the press.

==Retirement==
Since the 1970 impeachment hearings, Douglas had wanted to retire from the Court. He wrote to his friend and former student Abe Fortas: &quot;My ideas are way out of line with current trends, and I see no particular point in staying around and being obnoxious.&quot; However, he did not want to do so when a Republican was in the White House and would nominate his successor, saying &quot;I won&#x27;t resign while there&#x27;s a breath in my body —until we get a Democratic President.&quot;

At 76 on December 31, 1974, on vacation with his wife Cathleen in the Bahamas, Douglas suffered a debilitating stroke in the right hemisphere of his brain. It paralyzed his left leg and forced him to use a wheelchair. Douglas was severely disabled but insisted on continuing to participate in Supreme Court affairs despite his obvious incapacity. Seven of his fellow justices (with Byron White vehemently disagreeing) voted to postpone until the next term any argued case in which Douglas&#x27;s vote might make a difference. Douglas finally retired on November 12, 1975, after 36 years of service. He was Franklin Roosevelt&#x27;s last sitting Supreme Court justice. Indeed, Douglas had outlasted the last of Harry S. Truman&#x27;s appointments by eight years and was the last sitting justice to have served on the Hughes, Stone, and Vinson Courts.

Douglas&#x27;s formal resignation was submitted, as required by federal protocols, to his longtime political nemesis, then-President Gerald Ford. In his response, Ford put aside previous differences and paid tribute to the retiring justice:May I express on behalf of all our countrymen this nation&#x27;s great gratitude for your more than thirty-six years as a member of the Supreme Court. Your distinguished years of service are unequaled in all the history of the Court.

Ford hosted William and Cathleen Douglas as honored guests at a White House state dinner later that month. Ford later said of the occasion, &quot;We had had differences in the past, but I wanted to stress that bygones were bygones.&quot;

Douglas maintained that he could assume judicial senior status on the Court and attempted to continue serving in that capacity, according to authors Bob Woodward and Scott Armstrong. He refused to accept his retirement and tried to participate in the Court&#x27;s cases well into 1976, after John Paul Stevens had taken his former seat. Douglas reacted with outrage when, returning to his old chambers, he discovered that his clerks had been reassigned to Stevens and when he tried to file opinions for cases in which he had heard arguments before his retirement, Chief Justice Warren Burger ordered all justices, clerks, and other staff members to refuse help to Douglas in those efforts. When Douglas tried in March 1976 to hear arguments in a capital-punishment case, &quot;Gregg v. Georgia&quot;, the nine sitting justices signed a formal letter informing him that his retirement had ended his official duties on the Court. It was only then that Douglas withdrew from Supreme Court business.

One commentator has attributed some of his behavior after his stroke to anosognosia, which can lead an affected person to be unaware and unable to acknowledge disease in himself, and often results in defects in reasoning, decision-making, emotions, and feeling.

==Personal life==

Douglas&#x27;s first wife was Mildred Riddle, a teacher at North Yakima High School six years his senior, whom he married on August 16, 1923. They had two children, Mildred and William Jr. William Douglas Jr. became an actor, playing Gerald Zinser in &quot;PT 109&quot;.

On October 2, 1949, Douglas had thirteen of his ribs broken after he got thrown by a horse and he tumbled down a rocky hillside. As a result of his injuries, Douglas did not return to the Court until March 1950 and did not take part in many of that term&#x27;s cases. Four months after his return to the court, Douglas had to be hospitalized again when he was kicked by a horse.

Douglas divorced Riddle in July 1953. Douglas&#x27;s former friend Thomas Gardiner Corcoran represented Riddle in the divorce, securing alimony with an &quot;escalator clause&quot; that gave Douglas a financial motivation to publish more books. Douglas was not informed about Riddle&#x27;s 1969 death until several months had passed because his children had stopped talking to him.

While still married to Riddle, Douglas began openly pursuing Mercedes Hester Davidson in 1951. Other justices at the time kept mistresses as secretaries or kept them away from the Court building according to Douglas&#x27;s messenger Harry Datcher, but Douglas &quot;did what he did in the open. He didn&#x27;t give a damn what people thought of him.&quot; Douglas married Davidson on December 14, 1954.

In 1961, Douglas pursued Joan &quot;Joanie&quot; Martin, an Allegheny College student writing her thesis about him. In the summer of 1963, he divorced Davidson; on August 5, 1963, at the age of 64, Douglas married 23-year-old Martin. Douglas and Martin divorced in 1966.

On July 15, 1966, Douglas married Cathleen Heffernan, then a 22-year-old student at Marylhurst College. They met when he was vacationing at Mount St. Helens Lodge, a mountain wilderness lodge in Washington state at Spirit Lake, where she was working for the summer as a waitress. Though their age difference was a subject of national controversy at the time of their marriage, they remained together until his death in 1980.

For much of his life, Douglas was dogged by various rumors and allegations about his private life, originating from political rivals and other detractors of his liberal legal opinions on the Court—often a matter of controversy. In one such instance in 1966, Republican Representative Bob Dole of Kansas attributed his court decisions to his &quot;bad judgment from a matrimonial standpoint&quot;. Several other Republican members of Congress introduced resolutions in the House of Representatives, though none ever passed, that called for investigation of Douglas&#x27;s moral character.

Daniel Pierce Thompson was Douglas&#x27;s great-granduncle.

==Death==
Four years after retiring from the Supreme Court, Douglas died on January 19, 1980, at age 81, at Walter Reed Army Medical Center in Washington, D.C. He was survived by his fourth wife, Cathleen Douglas, and two children, Mildred and William Jr., with his first wife.
Douglas is interred in Section 5 of Arlington National Cemetery near the graves of eight other former Supreme Court justices: Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr., Warren E. Burger, William Rehnquist, Hugo Black, Potter Stewart, William J. Brennan, Thurgood Marshall, and Harry Blackmun. Throughout his life Douglas claimed he had been a U.S. Army private during World War I, which was inscribed on his headstone. Some historians, including biographer Bruce Murphy, asserted that this claim was false, although Murphy later added, according to &quot;Washington Post&quot; editorial writer Charles Lane, that Douglas&#x27;s &quot;career on the court makes it &#x27;appropriate&#x27;&quot; that he be buried in Arlington Cemetery.

Lane engaged in further research—consulting applicable provisions of the relevant federal statutes, locating Douglas&#x27;s honorable discharge and speaking with Arlington Cemetery staff. Records in the Library of Congress showed that from June to December 1918, Douglas served in the SATC as (what the War Department&#x27;s regulations termed) &quot;a soldier in the Army of the United States ... placed upon active-duty status immediately.&quot; Tom Sherlock, Arlington&#x27;s official historian, told Lane that an &quot;active-duty recruit whose service was limited to boot camp would qualify&quot; to be buried in Arlington. Lane therefore concluded, &quot;Legally, then, Douglas may have had a plausible claim to be a &#x27;Private, U.S. Army,&#x27; as his headstone at Arlington reads.&quot;

<doc id="365246" wikidata="Q6488006" url="?curid=365246" title="Laotian Americans">
<text>Laotian Americans () are Americans who trace their ancestry to Laos. Laotian Americans are included in the larger category of Asian Americans. The major immigrant generation were generally refugees who escaped Laos during the warfare and disruption of the 1970s, and entered refugee camps in Thailand across the Mekong River. They emigrated to the United States during the late 1970s and throughout the 1980s.

The category ‘Laotian American&#x27; includes all ethnic groups who lived within the borders of Laos, except the Hmong community.

==History==
Laotian immigration to the United States started shortly after the Vietnam War. Refugees began arriving in the U.S. after a Communist government came to power in Laos in 1975 and by 1980, the Laotian population of the U.S. reached 47,683, according to census estimates. The numbers increased dramatically during the 1980s so the census estimated that there were 147,375 people by 1990. The group continued to grow, somewhat more slowly, to 167,792 by 2000. By 2008, the population nearly reached 240,532. Included are the Hmong, a mountainous tribe from that country.

==Demographics==
The states with the largest Laotian American populations (including the Hmong from Laos) are California (58,424, 0.2%), Texas (13,298, 0.1%), Minnesota (10,065, 0.2%), Washington (9,333, 0.2%), Colorado (7,434, 0.1%), Tennessee (6,336, 0.1%), Illinois (5,822, 0.1%), North Carolina (5,566, 0.1%), Georgia (5,560, 0.1%), Florida (4,896, 0.05%), and Oregon (4,692, 0.1%). There are about over 200,000 ethnic Lao in America. Approximately 8,000 to 11,000 Americans are of mixed Lao and other descent. Ethnic Lao people may identify as both Lao American and Laotian American (see also Hmong American).

Most were estimated to live in the West (95,574), followed by the South (44,471), Midwest (37,820), and Northeast (15,382).

Cities or regions with significant Laotian-American populations include the Seattle metropolitan area (enumerating 12,190; 0.4% of its population); San Francisco Bay Area (11,545; 0.2%); Dallas–Fort Worth metropolitan area (10,500; 0.2%); Sacramento metropolitan area (9,814; 0.4%); Minneapolis – Saint Paul area (8,676; 0.3%); San Diego metropolitan area (8,079; 0.3%); Fresno metropolitan area (7,967; 0.9%); Greater Los Angeles Area (7,120; 0.04%); Nashville metropolitan area (6,210; 0.4%); Portland metropolitan area (5,806; 0.3%); Chicago metropolitan area (4,762; 0.05%); San Joaquin County, California (4,266; 0.6%); Providence, Rhode Island (3,456; 0.2%); Denver metropolitan area (2,673), Des Moines, Iowa (2,270), Anchorage metropolitan area (1,997; 0.5%), and Fort Smith, Arkansas-Arkoma, Oklahoma (1,730).

Smaller Laotian communities can be found in other cities and metropolitan areas across the United States. In the Southern United States, there is a significant Laotian community in St. Petersburg, Florida, where at least 1,000 Laotian-Americans reside. There are communities in Habersham County, Georgia (740), and Houston, Texas.

In the Southwestern and Midwestern United States, there are Laotian communities in Denver, Colorado; Storm Lake, Iowa (400; 4%), and Wichita, Kansas (1,594; 0.4%). The Oaklawn-Sunview community near Wichita is 11.5% Laotian American. In the Chicago area, there are sizable Laotian communities in the suburban cities of Aurora, Elgin, Joliet, and Rockford.

In the San Francisco Bay Area, the Laotian population is concentrated in the cities of Oakland, Richmond/San Pablo, San Jose, and Santa Rosa/Roseland. Elsewhere in Northern California, there are Laotian communities in Chico, Eureka, Redding, Stockton, and Yuba City. In central and southern California, there are communities in Fresno - also one of the largest Hmong communities outside Laos, Merced, and in Tulare County, California, especially in the city of Porterville. In the 1980s after the communist takeover of Laos, over 10,000 Laotians settled in central California. Many of the Laotians settled in central California to work in the farmland there. Additional Laotian communities exist in the Los Angeles Metropolitan area and in the Inland Empire region (i.e. Banning).

In the Northeast, there are Laotian communities spread across the New England states. With the large concentration in Providence, Rhode Island, Woonsocket, Rhode Island, Lowell, Massachusetts, and Newmarket, New Hampshire.

==Community and social issues==

===Poverty===
According to data collected by the American government in 2013, 18.5% of all Laotian Americans live under the poverty line. A Pew Research Center study published in 2019 found that the poverty rate had dropped to 13% which is equal to the national average. In 2021, 5-year estimates showed it had dropped to 12.1%. In 2022 the poverty rate had dropped to 11.1%. In 2023 the poverty rate had dropped to 8.5%.

Gangs have been an issue in the Laotian community ever since the 1980s and 1990s, although like most Asian communities, gangs have decreased in number and/or have received less media coverage for their activity. Gangs like the Original Laotian Gangsters in West Valley City, Utah, Asian Boyz chapters in California which include a large number of Cambodian Americans, but also have Laotian Americans, and other Asian Bloods and Crips gangs have committed serious crimes starting in the 1980s.

===Per capita income===
Despite having a high median annual household income of $85,863, Laotian Americans have a low Per Capita Income of $36,938.

In 2014, identified by factfinder census, when Americans&#x27; per capita income was divided by ethnic groups Laotian Americans were revealed to have a per capita income of only $21,479 below the American average of $25,825. 

===Lack of education and school dropout rates===
According to data collected in 2013, 38% of all Laotian Americans drop out of high school.

== Culture ==

=== Religion ===

66% of the population in Laos adhere to Buddhism and Buddhism is the basis and mainstream religion practiced in Laos. Lao Buddhists belong to Theravada Buddhism and are tolerant towards the pre-Buddhist animist or folk beliefs, which is the belief of spiritual essence possessed in objects and creatures. Buddhists residing in rural parts of Lao also maintained the belief in ancestral spirits, which are the souls and spirits from afterlife. Although Buddhism is the major religion practiced in Laos, there are also Christian minority. There are three Christian churches in Laos: Lao Evangelical Church, the Seventh-day Adventist Church and the Roman Catholic Church.

=== Theravada Buddhist Temple ===

Laotian-American populations have constructed numerous Buddhist temples, called &quot;vat&quot; or &quot;wat.&quot; Over time, the congregation donates money to customize and add on to the facility, as well as to add fine artwork and craftsmanship, resulting in a Laotian Buddhist temple that has some traditional features. Examples include Wat Lao Buddhavong located outside Washington, D.C.; Wat Lao Buddharam of San Diego, California; Wat Lao of S. Farmington, Minnesota; Wat Lao Buddhamamakaram of Columbus, Ohio; Wat Lao Mixayaram and Wat Lao Dhammacetiyaram of Seattle, Washington; Wat Lao Buddha Ariyamett Aram Temple in Morris, Connecticut; Wat Lao Lane Xang, founded in 1993 in Willington, Connecticut; Wat Lao Rattanaram in Richmond, California and the Wat Lao Mixayaram in Lowell, Massachusetts. With the growth of Laotian communities in more diverse areas, they have moved to and constructed temples in rural areas, such as Lane Xang Village, located between Lafayette and New Iberia in Louisiana.

==Representation in media==
One of the first national Laotian-American publication, &quot;Lao Roots Magazine&quot;, was published in 2007. The English-language magazine is geared toward the younger generation of the Laotian-American community. Published in San Diego by a small volunteer staff, the magazine has reached widespread national circulation within the Laotian-American community. After the publication ceased, former staff member and Yale University graduate Siamphone Louankang created the popular online magazine LaoAmericans.com, which continues to share stories by and about Americans of Laotian descent.

The documentary film &quot;The Betrayal (Nerakhoon)&quot; was directed by Ellen Kuras and Thavisouk Phrasavath. It portrays the epic of a family forced to emigrate from Laos after the chaos of the secret air war waged by the U.S. during the Vietnam War. Kuras spent 23 years chronicling the family&#x27;s journey in this film. The film won a Spectrum Award for the Full Frame Documentary Film Festival; it was nominated for an Oscar for best documentary.

==Sports==
Laotian Americans have excelled in a variety of sports achieving success at the collegiate, national and international level. While many of the individuals discussed in this section may not be notable among the general U.S. population, they are considered pioneers in sport within the Laotian American community and many are believed to be the first to compete at a national level or higher. Many of the second and later generation Laotian American athletes are of mixed heritage.

Khan Malaythong is thought to have become the first Laotian American to represent the U.S. at the Olympic games when he qualified for the U.S. badminton team as a doubles competitor at the 2008 Summer Olympics.

Phoothaphone “Ko” Chandetka is a nationally recognized competitive body builder of Laotian descent who has competed on and off for over twenty years. He is believed to be the first Laotian American to achieve notoriety in the sport. Ko won his first NPC title in 1991 at the age of nineteen and competed at the national level as recently as 2016 when he placed 7th in the Mr. Olympia contest.

Examples of Laotian American football players competing at the NCAA Division I level include Scott Phaydavong (Drake University), Ramaud Chiaokiao-Bowman (Northwestern), Taisun Phommachanh (Clemson), Malachi Moore, Tyler Phommachanh (University of Connecticut), and Nous Keobounnam (Oregon State). Scott Phaydavong may have been the first Laotian America to play football professionally when in 2009 he joined the German Football League&#x27;s Schwabisch Hall Unicorns. Ramaud Chiaokiao-Bowman signed with the Indianapolis Colts as an undrafted free agent in 2021 although he did not obtain a roster spot. 
Angelina Messina, a competitive swimmer from Illinois who is of mixed Laotian and Italian heritage, competed in the 2020 United States Olympic Trials at the age of sixteen. She is the first known Laotian American swimmer to qualify for the U.S. Olympic Swimming Trials and swims at the University of Pittsburgh.

Laos began inviting foreign athletes of exceptional ability with documented Lao heritage to represent Laos in international competition in 2020 with boxer Walter Sarnoi Oupathana being the first American to do so. Several Lao-America athletes represented Laos at the 2023 SEA Games in Cambodia including swimmers Angelina Messina, Ariana Dirkzwager, Astrid Dirkzwager, and Steven Insixiengmay along with wrestler Dawson Sihavong. Sihavong won a bronze medal in Greco-Roman wrestling and silver medal in freestyle wrestling.

<text>Clyde Lorrain Cowan Jr (December 6, 1919 – May 24, 1974) was an American physicist and the co-discoverer of the neutrino along with Frederick Reines. The discovery was made in 1956 in the neutrino experiment. Reines received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1995.

==Early life==
Born the oldest of four children in Detroit, Michigan, Cowan&#x27;s family moved to St. Louis, Missouri, where he began his education attending public schools. While attending the Missouri School of Mines and Metallurgy in Rolla, Missouri, Cowan was Editor-in-Chief of the Missouri Miner newspaper from 1939–1940, and graduated in 1940 with a BS in chemical engineering.

==Military career==
Cowan was a captain in the United States Army Air Forces, where he earned a bronze star in World War II.

From 1936–1940 he was in the Reserve Officers&#x27; Training Corps. Cowan joined the U.S. Army Chemical Warfare Service with the rank of Second Lieutenant when America joined World War II in 1941. In August 1942, he was transferred to Eighth Air Force stationed in London, England. In 1943 he designed and built an experimental cleaning unit to be used in case of gas attack. In the following year, he joined the staff of the British Branch of the MIT Radiation Laboratory, which was located in Great Malvern, England. In 1945 he was a liaison officer with the Royal Air Force, working to expedite transmittal of technical information and equipment. He returned to the United States in 1945, and worked at Wright Patterson Air Force Base in Dayton, Ohio. He left active duty in 1946.

==Academic career==
Benefitting from the G.I. Bill, Cowan attended Washington University in St. Louis, Missouri, receiving a master&#x27;s degree, and a PhD in 1949. He then joined the staff of the Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory in New Mexico, where he met Frederick Reines.

In 1951 Reines and Cowan began the Cowan–Reines neutrino experiment, in hopes of discovering the neutrino. Because the neutrino was hypothetically created through beta decay, the two men made use of the Savannah River Plant in Aiken, South Carolina, as their source of potential neutrinos. The pair, and their collaborators, collected data for months, and in 1956, concluded that they had certainly observed the neutrino, publishing their work in the July 20, 1956 issue of &quot;Science&quot;. Reines was later awarded the 1995 Nobel Prize in Physics for their work in this experiment. He alone received the award, because Cowan died in 1974, and Nobel Prizes are not awarded posthumously.

Cowan began his teaching career in 1957 as a Professor of Physics at George Washington University in Washington, D.C. The following year he left GWU and joined the faculty of The Catholic University of America in Washington, D.C., a post he held until the end of his life. He also acted at various times as a consultant to the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission (AEC), US Naval Ordnance Laboratory, the United States Naval Academy, the United States Army, United Mine Workers of America, Electric Boat Co., and the Smithsonian Institution, Washington, D.C.

Cowan died in Bethesda, Maryland of a sudden heart attack on May 24, 1974, and was buried in Arlington National Cemetery.

==Family==
Cowan was married in Woodford, England, January 29, 1943 to Betty Eleanor, daughter of George Henry and Mabel Jane (Mather) Dunham of Wanstead, England. Seven of their children died in infancy. They had three surviving children. Cowan adopted two sons.

His grandson, , a science journalist and a former physicist and engineer who heads the American Physical Society media relations office, initially conceived of the distributed computing project Einstein@home, which searches gravitational wave data for signals from massive rotating objects such as pulsars.

Cowan was a direct descendant of L. L. Langstroth, the &quot;Father of Modern Beekeeping&quot;.

<doc id="365262" wikidata="Q2488092" url="?curid=365262" title="Parasitic drag">
<text>Parasitic drag, also known as profile drag, is a type of aerodynamic drag that acts on any object when the object is moving through a fluid. Parasitic drag is defined as the combination of &quot;form drag&quot; and &quot;skin friction drag&quot;.

It is named as such because it is not useful, in contrast with lift-induced drag which is created when an airfoil generates lift. All objects experience parasitic drag, regardless of whether they generate lift. Parasitic drag comprises all types of drag except lift-induced drag, and the total drag on an aircraft or other object which generates lift is the sum of parasitic drag and lift-induced drag. 

==Form drag==
Form drag arises because of the shape of the object. The general size and shape of the body are the most important factors in form drag; bodies with a larger presented cross-section will have a higher drag than thinner bodies; sleek (&quot;streamlined&quot;) objects have lower form drag. Form drag follows the drag equation, meaning that it increases with the square of the velocity, and thus becomes more important for high-speed aircraft.

Form drag depends on the longitudinal section of the body. A prudent choice of body profile is essential for a low drag coefficient. Streamlines should be continuous, and separation of the boundary layer with its attendant vortices should be avoided.

Form drag includes interference drag, caused by the mixing of airflow streams. For example, where the wing and fuselage meet at the wing root, two airstreams merge into one. This mixing can cause eddy currents, turbulence, or restrict smooth airflow. Interference drag is greater when two surfaces meet at perpendicular angles, and can be minimised by the use of fairings.

Wave drag, also known as supersonic wave drag or compressibility drag, is a component of form drag caused by shock waves generated when an aircraft is moving at transonic and supersonic speeds.

Form drag is a type of pressure drag, a term which also includes lift-induced drag. Form drag is pressure drag due to separation.

==Skin friction drag==

Skin friction drag arises from the friction of the fluid against the &quot;skin&quot; of the object that is moving through it. Skin friction arises from the interaction between the fluid and the skin of the body, and is directly related to the wetted surface, the area of the surface of the body that is in contact with the fluid. Air in contact with a body will stick to the body&#x27;s surface and that layer will tend to stick to the next layer of air and that in turn to further layers, hence the body is dragging some amount of air with it. The force required to drag an &quot;attached&quot; layer of air with the body is called skin friction drag. Skin friction drag imparts some momentum to a mass of air as it passes through it and that air applies a retarding force on the body. As with other components of parasitic drag, skin friction follows the drag equation and rises with the square of the velocity.

Skin friction is caused by viscous drag in the boundary layer around the object. The boundary layer at the front of the object is usually laminar and relatively thin, but becomes turbulent and thicker towards the rear. The position of the transition point from laminar to turbulent flow depends on the shape of the object. There are two ways to decrease friction drag: the first is to shape the moving body so that laminar flow is possible. The second method is to increase the length and decrease the cross-section of the moving object as much as practicable. To do so, a designer can consider the fineness ratio, which is the length of the aircraft divided by its diameter at the widest point (L/D). It is mostly kept 6:1 for subsonic flows. Increase in length increases Reynolds number (formula_1). With formula_1 in the denominator for skin friction coefficient&#x27;s relation, as its value is increased (in laminar range), total friction drag is reduced. While decrease in cross-sectional area decreases drag force on the body as the disturbance in air flow is less.

The skin friction coefficient, formula_3, is defined by
:formula_4
where formula_5 is the local wall shear stress, and q is the free-stream dynamic pressure. For boundary layers without a pressure gradient in the x direction, it is related to the momentum thickness as
:formula_6
For comparison, the turbulent empirical relation known as the &quot;One-seventh Power &quot;Law&quot; (derived by Theodore von Kármán) is:
:formula_7

where formula_1 is the Reynolds number.

For a laminar flow over a plate, the skin friction coefficient can be determined using the formula:

:formula_9

<doc id="365264" wikidata="Q1936256" url="?curid=365264" title="Systems programming">
<text>Systems programming, or system programming, is the activity of programming computer system software. The primary distinguishing characteristic of systems programming when compared to application programming is that application programming aims to produce software which provides services to the user directly (e.g. word processor), whereas systems programming aims to produce software and software platforms which provide services to other software, are performance constrained, or both (e.g. operating systems, computational science applications, game engines, industrial automation, and software as a service applications).

Systems programming requires a great degree of hardware awareness. Its goal is to achieve efficient use of available resources, either because the software itself is performance-critical or because even small efficiency improvements directly transform into significant savings of time or money.

== Overview ==

The following attributes characterize systems programming:
* The programmer can make assumptions about the hardware and other properties of the system that the program runs on, and will often exploit those properties, for example by using an algorithm that is known to be efficient when used with specific hardware.
* Usually a low-level programming language or programming language dialect is used so that:
** Programs can operate in resource-constrained environments
** Programs can be efficient with little runtime overhead, possibly having either a small runtime library or none at all
** Programs may use direct and &quot;raw&quot; control over memory access and control flow
** The programmer may write parts of the program directly in assembly language
* Often systems programs cannot be run in a debugger. Running the program in a simulated environment can sometimes be used to reduce this problem.

In systems programming, often limited programming facilities are available. The use of automatic garbage collection is not common and debugging is sometimes hard to do. The runtime library, if available at all, is usually far less powerful, and does less error checking. Because of those limitations, monitoring and logging are often used; operating systems may have extremely elaborate logging subsystems.

Implementing certain parts in operating systems and networking requires systems programming, for example implementing paging (virtual memory) or a device driver for an operating system.

== History ==
Originally systems programmers invariably wrote in assembly language. Experiments with hardware support in high level languages in the late 1960s led to such languages as PL/S, BLISS, BCPL, and extended ALGOL for Burroughs large systems. Forth also has applications as a systems language. 
In the 1970s, C became widespread, aided by the growth of Unix.
More recently a subset of C++ called Embedded C++ has seen some use, for instance it is used in the I/O Kit drivers of macOS.
Engineers working at Google created Go in 2007 to address developer productivity in large distributed systems, with developer-focused features such as Concurrency, Garbage Collection, and faster program compilation than C and C++.
In 2015 Rust came out, a general-purpose programming language often used in systems programming. Rust was designed with memory safety in mind and to be as performant as C and C++.

== Alternative meaning ==
For historical reasons, some organizations use the term &quot;systems programmer&quot; to describe a job function which would be more accurately termed systems administrator. This is particularly true in organizations whose computer resources have historically been dominated by mainframes, although the term is even used to describe job functions which do not involve mainframes. This usage arose because administration of IBM mainframes often involved the writing of custom assembler code (IBM&#x27;s Basic Assembly Language (BAL)), which integrated with the operating system such as OS/MVS, DOS/VSE or VM/CMS. Indeed, some IBM software products had substantial code contributions from customer programming staff. This type of programming is progressively less common, and increasingly done in C rather than Assembly, but the term &quot;systems programmer&quot; is still used as the de-facto job title for staff administering IBM mainframes even in cases where they do not regularly engage in systems programming activities.

<text>Robert Frank (November 9, 1924 – September 9, 2019) was a Swiss American photographer and documentary filmmaker. His most notable work, the 1958 book titled &quot;The Americans&quot;, earned Frank comparisons to a modern-day de Tocqueville for his fresh and nuanced outsider&#x27;s view of American society. Critic Sean O&#x27;Hagan, writing in &quot;The Guardian&quot; in 2014, said &quot;The Americans&quot; &quot;changed the nature of photography, what it could say and how it could say it. [ ... ] it remains perhaps the most influential photography book of the 20th century.&quot; Frank later expanded into film and video and experimented with manipulating photographs and photomontage.

== Background and early photography career ==
Frank was born in Zürich, Switzerland, the son of Rosa (Zucker) and Hermann Frank. His family was Jewish. According to Frank, his mother, Rosa (other sources give her name as Regina), had a Swiss passport, while his father, Hermann originating from Frankfurt, Germany, had become stateless after losing his German citizenship as a Jew. They had to apply for the Swiss citizenship of Robert and his older brother, Manfred. Though Frank and his family remained safe in Switzerland during World War II, the threat of Nazism nonetheless affected his understanding of oppression. He turned to photography, in part as a means to escape the confines of his business-oriented family and home, and trained under a few photographers and graphic designers before he created his first hand-made book of photographs, &quot;40 Fotos&quot;, in 1946. Frank emigrated to the United States in 1947, and secured a job in New York City as a fashion photographer for &quot;Harper&#x27;s Bazaar&quot;.

In 1949, the new editor of &quot;Camera&quot; magazine, Walter Laubli (1902–1991), published a substantial portfolio of Jakob Tuggener pictures made at upper-class entertainments and in factories, alongside the work of the 25 year-old Frank who had just returned to his native Switzerland after two years abroad, with pages including some of his first pictures from New York. The magazine promoted the two as representatives of the &#x27;new photography&#x27; of Switzerland.

Tuggener was a role model for the younger artist, first mentioned to him by Frank&#x27;s boss and mentor, Zurich commercial photographer Michael Wolgensinger (1913–1990) who understood that Frank was unsuited to the more mercenary application of the medium. Tuggener, as a serious artist who had left the commercial world behind, was the &quot;one Frank really did love, from among all Swiss photographers,&quot; according to Guido Magnaguagno and &quot;Fabrik&quot;, as a photo book, was a model for Frank&#x27;s Les Américains (&#x27;The Americans&#x27;) published ten years later in Paris by Delpire, in 1958.

He soon left to travel in South America and Europe. He created another hand-made book of photographs that he shot in Peru, and returned to the U.S. in 1950. That year was momentous for Frank, who, after meeting Edward Steichen, participated in the group show &quot;51 American Photographers&quot; at the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA); he also married fellow artist Mary Frank (née Lockspeiser), with whom he had two children, Andrea and Pablo.

Though he was initially optimistic about the United States&#x27; society and culture, Frank&#x27;s perspective quickly changed as he confronted the fast pace of American life and what he saw as an overemphasis on money. He now saw America as an often bleak and lonely place, a perspective that became evident in his later photography. Frank&#x27;s own dissatisfaction with the control that editors exercised over his work also undoubtedly colored his experience. He continued to travel, moving his family briefly to Paris. In 1953, he returned to New York and continued to work as a freelance photojournalist for magazines including &quot;McCall&#x27;s&quot;, &quot;Vogue&quot;, and &quot;Fortune&quot;. Associating with other contemporary photographers such as Saul Leiter and Diane Arbus, he helped form what Jane Livingston has termed The New York School of photographers (not to be confused with the New York School of art) during the 1940s and 1950s.

In 1955, Frank achieved further recognition with the inclusion by Edward Steichen of seven of his photographs (many more than most other contributors) in the world-touring Museum of Modern Art exhibition &quot;The Family of Man&quot; that was to be seen by 9 million visitors and with a popular catalogue that is still in print. Frank&#x27;s contributions had been taken in Spain (of a woman kissing her swaddled babe-in-arms); of a bowed old woman in Peru; a rheumy-eyed miner in Wales; and the others in England and the US, including two (one atypically soft-focus) of his wife in pregnancy; and one (later to be included in &quot;The Americans&quot;) of six laughing women in the window of the White Tower Hamburger Stand on Fourteenth Street, New York City.

== &quot;The Americans&quot; ==

Inspired by fellow Swiss Jakob Tuggener&#x27;s 1943 filmic book &quot;Fabrik,&quot; Bill Brandt&#x27;s &quot;The English at Home&quot; (1936), and Walker Evans&#x27;s &quot;American Photographs&quot; (1938), and on the recommendation of Evans (a previous recipient), Alexey Brodovitch, Alexander Leiberman, Edward Steichen, and Meyer Schapiro, Frank secured a Guggenheim Fellowship from the John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation in 1955 to travel across the United States and photograph all strata of its society. Cities he visited included Detroit and Dearborn, Michigan; Savannah, Georgia; Miami Beach and St. Petersburg, Florida; New Orleans, Louisiana; Houston, Texas; Los Angeles, California; Reno, Nevada; Salt Lake City, Utah; Butte, Montana; and Chicago, Illinois. He took his family along with him for part of his series of road trips over the next two years, during which time he took 28,000 shots. 83 of these were selected by him for publication in &quot;The Americans&quot;.

Frank&#x27;s journey was not without incident. He later recalled the anti-Semitism to which he was subject in a small Arkansas town. &quot;I remember the guy [policeman] took me into the police station, and he sat there and put his feet on the table. It came out that I was Jewish because I had a letter from the Guggenheim Foundation. They really were primitive.&quot; He was told by the sheriff, &quot;Well, we have to get somebody who speaks Yiddish.&quot; ... &quot;They wanted to make a thing out of it. It was the only time it happened on the trip. They put me in jail. It was scary. Nobody knew where I was.&quot; Elsewhere in the South, he was told by a sheriff that he had &quot;an hour to leave town.&quot; Those incidents may have contributed to the dark view of America found in the work.

Shortly after returning to New York in 1957, Frank met Beat writer Jack Kerouac &quot;at a New York party where poets and Beatniks were,&quot; and showed him the photographs from his travels. However, according to Joyce Johnson, Kerouac&#x27;s lover at the time, she met Frank while waiting for Kerouac to emerge from a conference with his editors, at Viking Press, looked at Frank&#x27;s portfolio, and introduced them to each other. Kerouac immediately told Frank, &quot;Sure I can write something about these pictures.&quot; He eventually contributed the introduction to the U.S. edition of &quot;The Americans&quot;. Frank also became lifelong friends with Allen Ginsberg, and was one of the main visual artists to document the Beat subculture, which felt an affinity with Frank&#x27;s interest in documenting the tensions between the optimism of the 1950s and the realities of class and racial differences. The irony that Frank found in the gloss of American culture and wealth over this tension gave his photographs a clear contrast to those of most contemporary American photojournalists, as did his use of unusual focus, low lighting and cropping that deviated from accepted photographic techniques.

This divergence from contemporary photographic standards gave Frank difficulty at first in securing an American publisher. &quot;Les Américains&quot; was first published in 1958 by Robert Delpire in Paris, as part of its &quot;Encyclopédie Essentielle&quot; series, with texts by Simone de Beauvoir, Erskine Caldwell, William Faulkner, Henry Miller and John Steinbeck that Delpire positioned opposite Frank&#x27;s photographs. It was finally published in 1959 in the United States, without the texts, by Grove Press, where it initially received substantial criticism. &quot;Popular Photography&quot;, for one, derided his images as &quot;meaningless blur, grain, muddy exposures, drunken horizons and general sloppiness.&quot; Though sales were also poor at first, the fact that the introduction was by the popular Kerouac helped it reach a larger audience. Over time and through its inspiration of later artists, &quot;The Americans&quot; became a seminal work in American photography and art history, and is the work with which Frank is most clearly identified. Critic Sean O&#x27;Hagan, writing in &quot;The Guardian&quot; in 2014, said &quot;it is impossible to imagine photography&#x27;s recent past and overwhelmingly confusing present without his lingeringly pervasive presence.&quot; and that &quot;The Americans&quot; &quot;changed the nature of photography, what it could say and how it could say it. [ . . . ] it remains perhaps the most influential photography book of the 20th century.&quot;

In 1961, Frank received his first individual show, entitled &quot;Robert Frank: Photographer&quot;, at the Art Institute of Chicago. He also showed at the Museum of Modern Art in New York in 1962.

The French Journal Les Cahiers de la photographie devoted special issues 11 and 12 in 1983 to discussion of Robert Frank as a gesture of admiration for, and complicity with, his work, also to set forth his critical capacity as an artist.

To mark the fiftieth anniversary of the first publication of &quot;The Americans&quot;, a new edition was released worldwide on May 30, 2008. For this new edition from Steidl, most photographs are uncropped (in contrast to the cropped versions in previous editions), and two photographs are replaced with those of the same subject but from an alternate perspective.

A celebratory exhibit of &quot;The Americans&quot;, titled &quot;Looking In: Robert Frank&#x27;s The Americans&quot;, was displayed in 2009 at the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C., the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art (SFMOMA), and at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. The second section of the four-section, 2009, SFMOMA exhibition displays Frank&#x27;s original application to the John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation (which funded the primary work on &quot;The Americans&quot; project), along with vintage contact sheets, letters to photographer Walker Evans and author Jack Kerouac, and two early manuscript versions of Kerouac&#x27;s introduction to the book. Also exhibited were three collages (made from more than 115 original rough work prints) that were assembled under Frank&#x27;s supervision in 2007 and 2008, revealing his intended themes as well as his first rounds of image selection. An accompanying book, also titled &quot;Looking In: Robert Frank&#x27;s The Americans&quot;, was published, the most in-depth examination of any photography book ever, at 528 pages. While working as a guard at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Jason Eskenazi asked other noted photographers visiting the &quot;Looking In&quot; exhibition to choose their favorite image from &quot;The Americans&quot; and explain their choice, resulting in the book, &quot;By the Glow of the Jukebox: The Americans List&quot;.

== Films ==
By the time &quot;The Americans&quot; was published in the United States in 1959, Frank had moved away from photography to concentrate on filmmaking. Among his films was the 1959 &quot;Pull My Daisy,&quot; which was written and narrated by Kerouac and starred Ginsberg, Gregory Corso and others from the Beat circle. The Beats emphasized spontaneity, and the film conveyed the quality of having been thrown together or even improvised. &quot;Pull My Daisy&quot; was accordingly praised for years as an improvisational masterpiece, until Frank&#x27;s co-director, Alfred Leslie, revealed in a November 28, 1968 article in the &quot;Village Voice&quot; that the film was actually carefully planned, rehearsed, and directed by him and Frank, who shot the film with professional lighting.

In 1960, Frank was staying in Pop artist George Segal&#x27;s basement while filming &quot;The Sin of Jesus&quot; with a grant from Walter K. Gutman. Isaac Babel&#x27;s story was transformed to center on a woman working on a chicken farm in New Jersey. It was originally supposed to be filmed in six weeks in and around New Brunswick, but Frank ended up shooting for six months.

Frank&#x27;s 1972 documentary of the Rolling Stones, &quot;Cocksucker Blues&quot;, is arguably his best known film. The film shows the Stones on tour, engaging in heavy drug use and group sex. Frank said of the Stones, &quot;It was great to watch them — the excitement. But my job was after the show. What I was photographing was a kind of boredom. It&#x27;s so difficult being famous. It&#x27;s a horrendous life. Everyone wants to get something from you.&quot; Mick Jagger reportedly told Frank, &quot;It&#x27;s a fucking good film, Robert, but if it shows in America we&#x27;ll never be allowed in the country again.&quot; The Stones sued to prevent the film&#x27;s release, and it was disputed whether Frank as the artist or the Stones as those who hired the artist owned the copyright. A court order restricted the film to being shown no more than five times per year, and only in the presence of Frank. Frank&#x27;s photography also appeared on the cover of the Rolling Stones&#x27; album &quot;Exile on Main St.&quot;.

Other films by Frank include &quot;Me and My Brother&quot;, &quot;Keep Busy&quot;, and &quot;Candy Mountain&quot; (the last was co-directed with Rudy Wurlitzer).

== Later life and death ==
Though Frank continued to be interested in film and video, he returned to still images in the 1970s, publishing his second photographic book, &quot;The Lines of My Hand&quot;, in 1972. This work has been described as a &quot;visual autobiography&quot;, and consists largely of personal photographs. However, he largely gave up &quot;straight&quot; photography to instead create narratives out of constructed images and collages, incorporating words and multiple frames of images that were directly scratched and distorted on the negatives. None of this later work has achieved an impact comparable to that of &quot;The Americans.&quot; As some critics have pointed out, this is perhaps because Frank began playing with constructed images more than a decade after Robert Rauschenberg introduced his silkscreen composites—in contrast to &quot;The Americans&quot;, Frank&#x27;s later images simply were not beyond the pale of accepted technique and practice by that time.

Frank and Mary separated in 1969. He remarried, to sculptor June Leaf, and in 1971, moved to the community of Mabou in Cape Breton Island, Nova Scotia in Canada. In 1974, his daughter, Andrea, was killed in a plane crash in Tikal, Guatemala. Also around this time, his son, Pablo, was first hospitalized and diagnosed with schizophrenia. Much of Frank&#x27;s subsequent work dealt with the impact of the loss of both his daughter and subsequently his son, who died in an Allentown, Pennsylvania hospital in 1994. In 1995, in memory of his daughter he founded the Andrea Frank Foundation, which provides grants to artists.

After his move to Nova Scotia, Canada, Frank divided his time between his home there, in a former fisherman&#x27;s shack on the coast, and his Bleecker Street loft in New York. He acquired a reputation for being a recluse (particularly since the death of Andrea), declining most interviews and public appearances. He continued to accept eclectic assignments, however, such as photographing the 1984 Democratic National Convention, and directing music videos for artists such as New Order (&quot;Run&quot;), and Patti Smith (&quot;Summer Cannibals&quot;). Frank produced both films and still images, and helped organize several retrospectives of his art. His work has been represented by Pace/MacGill Gallery in New York since 1984. In 1994, the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C. presented the most comprehensive retrospective of Frank&#x27;s work to date, entitled &quot;Moving Out&quot;.

Frank died on September 9, 2019, at his home in Nova Scotia.

<doc id="365270" wikidata="Q284463" url="?curid=365270" title="Malia, Crete">
<text>Malia (Greek: Μάλια) is a coastal town and municipal unit situated in the northeast corner of the Heraklion region of Crete, Greece. It is part of the municipality of Hersonissos and is located approximately 34 kilometers (21 miles) east of Heraklion. As of 2021, the population of the municipal unit was 5,501. The area also encompasses the villages of Mochos (Greek: Μοχός), Krasi (Greek: Κράσι), and Stalida (Greek: Σταλίδα), covering a total area of 60.720 square kilometers (23.444 sq mi). Malia is renowned as a tourist destination, particularly famous for its vibrant nightlife. Additionally, the town is home to Minoan ruins located three kilometers to the east, spanning an area of approximately 1 square kilometer (0.4 sq mi).

==Palace of Malia==

Close to the modern town lies an archaeological site housing the remains of a Minoan palace and an associated settlement. Dating back to the Middle Bronze Age, the palace suffered destruction from an earthquake during the Late Bronze Age, a fate shared by Knossos and other contemporaneous sites. Subsequently, the palace underwent reconstruction in the latter part of the Late Bronze Age, with the majority of the visible ruins dating from this period. The palace notably includes a sizable central courtyard measuring 48m x 23m. Positioned on the southern side are two sets of ascending steps, alongside a network of small chambers. An intriguing feature within the premises is a carved stone known as a kernos stone, resembling a millstone with an attached cup. On the northern side of the courtyard, storage rooms containing large earthenware pithos jars, some reaching heights of up to two meters. These vessels were utilized for storing various commodities such as grain and olive oil, with the rooms featuring a sophisticated drainage system designed to manage spilled liquids.

The palace of Malia was initially uncovered in 1915 by Greek archaeologist Joseph Hadzidakis. Subsequent excavation work commenced in 1922 under the auspices of the French School at Athens in collaboration with Greek scholars. Jean Charbonneaux oversaw the excavation of the Central Court starting in 1921. Following World War I, Fernand Chapouthier and Pierre Demargne resumed excavations, unearthing the palace and its residential neighborhood. In the 1950s, further excavation efforts were led by Micheline and Henri van Effenterre, Andre Dessene, Olivier Pelon, and Jean-Claude Poursat, who explored different sections of the site. Pascal and Claude Darcque Bourrain conducted additional investigations in 1981, focusing on the northwest corner of the palace. Soundings conducted by Olivier Pelon in 1981 and 1982 provided new insights into the palace&#x27;s precursors. Since 1988, Alexandre Farnoux and Jan Driessen have continued excavation work at the site.

The Palace of Malia covers a floor area of 7,500 square meters and is aligned along a north-south axis, consistent with other Minoan palaces. In terms of architectural design and amenities, it is comparatively smaller and less elaborate than palaces like Knossos and Phaestos.

The Palace of Malia exhibits distinctive features that set it apart from other Minoan palaces. These include the presence of eight kouloures or silos located in the southwest corner, an oblique building situated in the north court, and an altar positioned in the Central Court.
The Central Court serves as the focal point around which various districts or ensembles are organized, interconnected by corridors and pathways. Each of these quarters is designated for specific functions, but they are best understood individually before considering their placement within the overall layout. Olivier Pelon identified four distinct functional areas: representative, residential, cultic-religious, and economic (Magazine).

Radiating outwards from the Central Court, the rooms were arranged centrifugally, resulting in the characteristic projections and recesses typical of Minoan Palace facades. The façade was imbued with a distinct significance:

The west façade holds particular significance at Malia. It features meticulously carved cuboid blocks of sandstone centrally placed atop a base running the full width (known as Ashlar masonry), with limestone blocks at the edges. These elements epitomize the typical attributes of Minoan façades, characterized by a succession of projecting and recessed walls.

The west façade is preceded by a sizable courtyard known as the West Court, measuring 100 meters long and 20 meters wide. Olivier Pelon identifies it as a transitional zone between the residential and administrative areas, bridging the secular and religious realms. Originally, the entire West Court was constructed with Kalderim, featuring 1.05-meter-wide limestone slabs. These &quot;raised walks&quot; likely served as ceremonial paths, leading to key points within the structure. 

The West Court is flanked to the north and south by noteworthy complexes: to the north is the &quot;Hypostyle Crypt,&quot; subject to much discussion. This space, connected underground to several storage areas, possibly served as a meeting place for councils during the era of the early palaces. To the south, large storage chambers were partially unearthed, not directly connected to the palace architecturally but evidently linked during the Protopalatial period. Many of these rooms still contain numerous Pithoi, or large storage jars.

Through archaeological soundings and dating analysis, the site reveals a core dating back to the Early Minoan III to Middle Minoan IA periods (mid 3rd millennium BCE/2300–1900 BCE). This pre-palatial phase is evident along the west façade (Quarter I) and in the north of the Central Court (Quartier IX). The construction of the initial palace structure occurred during the Middle Minoan IB to Middle Minoan II periods (1900–1700 BCE), similar to contemporary palatial sites. 

During the subsequent New Palace Period, two major phases emerged, spanning Middle Minoan III and Late Minoan IA (1700–1450 BCE). The first palace, built around 1900 BCE, likely succumbed to an earthquake around 1700 BCE. This period witnessed the development of an urban center with settlements, the palace, villas, workshops, and cemeteries. While little remains visible from this stage within the palace, surrounding complexes like the &quot;Hypostyle Crypt,&quot; &quot;Agora,&quot; and &quot;Quartier Mu&quot; indicate the political center of the time.

The New Palace, constructed circa 1650 BCE, was later destroyed around 1450 BCE, akin to Phaestos and Zakros, possibly due to the eruption of Thera, subsequent earthquakes, or Mycenaean invasions. The palace was encompassed by a Minoan town, recently uncovered with ongoing excavations. Large semi-transparent roofs shield significant excavation areas, allowing tourist access in some sections while walkways enable passage above others. Identified structures include metal and ceramic workshops, meeting rooms, and a large residential dwelling with an en-suite bath, reminiscent of designs at Phaistos, all strategically positioned to maximize scenic views.

==Malia resort==

Malia has transformed into a prominent holiday destination, boasting a bustling holiday resort characterized by tourism and commercial activities. The town&#x27;s economy thrives on hotels, restaurants, gift shops, bars, and nightclubs, catering to the needs of tourists. Renowned for its vibrant nightlife, Malia has emerged as a top tourist hub in Crete and Europe, drawing comparisons to destinations like Ibiza and Magaluf. Predominantly frequented by young visitors from the United Kingdom and Northern Europe, Malia&#x27;s nightlife scene is elevated by the presence of renowned DJs and events. The Main Strip serves as the focal point, hosting a plethora of bars, clubs, taverns, and restaurants, complemented by nearby accommodation options including hotels and apartments.

Malia boasts a scenic sandy beach stretching from the base of the strip and extending eastward toward the vicinity of the Minoan palace of Malia.

In the past, Malia was renowned for its agricultural output and iconic windmills. Presently, it&#x27;s celebrated for its pristine beaches, crystal-clear waters, and the historic Minoan Palace of King Sarpidon, one of Crete&#x27;s prominent ancient sites. The town offers a blend of tradition and modernity, divided by the main road. To the south lies the old town, characterized by charming alleyways and traditional architecture, including renovated buildings and ancient churches. Visitors can explore traditional taverns and restaurants. In contrast, the newer part of town, located north of the main road, features a vibrant nightlife scene with numerous bars and clubs, alongside shopping opportunities and eateries serving traditional cuisine.

Malia gained prominence as the setting for the 2011 British comedy film, &quot;The Inbetweeners Movie&quot;, depicting a lads&#x27; holiday adventure of the main characters. Over the years, Malia has seen a surge in popularity, surpassing other holiday resorts like Ayia Napa and Zante. Independent reviews of booking data from various travel agents indicated Malia as the favored destination among young adults in 2013. Additionally, the 2023 film &quot;How to Have Sex&quot; was also filmed in Malia.

<doc id="365277" wikidata="Q7713594" url="?curid=365277" title="The Americans (photography)">
<text>The Americans is a photographic book by Robert Frank which was highly influential in post-war American photography. It was first published in France in 1958, and the following year in the United States. The photographs were notable for their distanced view of both high and low strata of American society. The book as a whole created a complicated portrait of the period that was viewed as skeptical of contemporary values and evocative of ubiquitous loneliness. &quot;Frank set out with his Guggenheim Grant to do something new and unconstrained by commercial diktats&quot; and made &quot;a now classic photography book in the iconoclastic spirit of the Beats&quot;.

==Background==
In 1949, the new editor of &quot;Camera&quot; magazine, Walter Laubli (1902–1991), published a substantial portfolio of Jakob Tuggener pictures made at upper-class entertainments and in factories, alongside the work of 25 year-old Robert Frank who had just returned to his native Switzerland after two years abroad, with pages including some of his first pictures from New York. The magazine promoted the two as representatives of the ‘new photography’ of Switzerland.

Tuggener was a role model for the younger artist, first mentioned to him by Frank&#x27;s boss and mentor, Zurich commercial photographer Michael Wolgensinger (1913–1990) who felt that Frank would never fit the commercial system. Tuggener, as a serious artist who had left the commercial world behind, was the “one Frank really did love, from among all Swiss photographers,” according to Guido Magnaguagno and Tuggener&#x27;s &quot;Fabrik&quot; (1943), as a photo book sequenced poetically and conceived without text like a silent movie, was a model for Frank&#x27;s conception of &quot;Les Américains&quot; published fifteen years later in Paris by Delpire, in 1958.

Inspired by fellow Swiss Tuggener&#x27;s book, Bill Brandt&#x27;s &quot;The English at Home&quot; (1936), and Walker Evans&#x27; &quot;American Photographs&quot; (1938), and on the recommendation of Evans (a previous recipient), Alexey Brodovitch, Alexander Liberman, Edward Steichen, and Meyer Schapiro, Frank secured a Guggenheim Fellowship from the John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation in 1955 to travel across the United States and photograph all strata of its society. He took his family along with him for part of his series of road trips over the next two years, during which time he took 28,000 shots. Only 83 of those were finally selected by him for publication in &quot;The Americans&quot;.

Sean O&#x27;Hagan, writing in &quot;The Guardian,&quot; about the inclusion of &quot;The Americans&quot; as the starting point in David Campany&#x27;s critical journey into the photographic road trip, &quot;The Open Road&quot; (2014), said &quot;Swiss-born Frank set out with his Guggenheim Grant to do something new and unconstrained by commercial diktats. His aim was to photograph America as it unfolded before his somewhat sombre outsider&#x27;s eye. From the start, Frank defined himself against the traditional &quot;Life&quot; magazine school of romantic reportage.&quot;

Frank&#x27;s journey was not without incident. While driving through Arkansas, Frank was arbitrarily thrown in jail for three days after being stopped by the police who accused him of being a communist (their reasons: he was shabbily dressed, he was Jewish, he had letters about his person from people with Russian sounding names, his children had foreign sounding names – Pablo &amp; Andrea, and he had foreign whiskey with him). He was also told by a sheriff elsewhere in the South that he had &quot;an hour to leave town.&quot;

==Introduction==
Shortly after returning to New York in 1957, Frank met Beat writer Jack Kerouac on the sidewalk outside a party and showed him the photographs from his travels. Kerouac immediately told Frank &quot;Sure I can write something about these pictures,&quot; and he contributed the introduction to the U.S. edition of &quot;The Americans&quot;.

==Style==
Frank found a tension in the gloss of American culture and wealth over race and class differences, which gave his photographs a clear contrast to those of most contemporary American photojournalists, as did his use of unusual focus, low lighting and cropping that deviated from accepted photographic techniques.

==Critical views==
The book initially received harsh criticism in the US, where the tone of the book was perceived as derogatory to national ideals. Much of the criticism Frank faced was as well related to his photojournalistic style, wherein the immediacy of the hand-held camera introduced technical imperfections into the resulting images. &quot;Popular Photography&quot;, for one, derided Frank&#x27;s images as &quot;meaningless blur, grain, muddy exposures, drunken horizons and general sloppiness.&quot; This stands in contrast to Walker Evans&#x27; &quot;American Photographs&quot;, a direct inspiration to Frank, with its rigidly framed images shot via large-format viewcamera. Though sales were also poor at first, Kerouac&#x27;s introduction helped it reach a larger audience because of the popularity of the Beat phenomenon. Over time and through its inspiration of later artists, &quot;The Americans&quot; became considered a seminal work in American photography and art history, and the work with which Frank is most clearly identified.

Sociologist Howard S. Becker has written about &quot;The Americans&quot; as social analysis:
Robert Frank&#x27;s (...) enormously influential &quot;The Americans&quot; is in ways reminiscent both of Tocqueville&#x27;s analysis of American institutions and of the analysis of cultural themes by Margaret Mead and Ruth Benedict. Frank presents photographs made in scattered places around the country, returning again and again to such themes as the flag, the automobile, race, restaurants—eventually turning those artifacts, by the weight of the associations in which he embeds them, into profound and meaningful symbols of American culture.

==Publishing history==

Frank&#x27;s divergence from contemporary photographic standards gave him difficulty at first in securing an American publisher. was first published on 15 May 1958 by Robert Delpire in Paris as part of its &quot;Encyclopédie Essentielle&quot; series. Writings by Simone de Beauvoir, Erskine Caldwell, William Faulkner, Henry Miller and John Steinbeck were included, that Delpire positioned opposite Frank&#x27;s photographs. Many thought that Frank&#x27;s photos served more to illustrate the writing rather than the converse. The cover was decorated with a drawing by Saul Steinberg.

In 1959, &quot;The Americans&quot; was finally published in the United States by Grove Press, with the text removed from the French edition due to concerns that it was too un-American in tone. The added introduction by Kerouac, along with simple captions for the photos, were now the only text in the book, which was intended to mirror the layout of Walker Evans&#x27; &quot;American Photographs&quot;.

On the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the book&#x27;s original publication (15 May 2008), a new edition was published by Steidl. Frank was involved in the design and production of this edition which used modern scanning of Frank&#x27;s original prints, and tritone printing. A new format for the book was worked out, new typography selected, a new cover designed and Frank chose the book cloth, foil embossing and endpaper. As he has done for every edition of &quot;The Americans&quot;, Frank changed the cropping of many of the photographs, usually including more information, and two slightly different photographs were used.

A new edition is due to be published in 2024 by Aperture after the publisher received a $1m endowment grant from the Andrea Frank Foundation.

<doc id="365282" wikidata="Q1140388" url="?curid=365282" title="Triumph Motor Company">
<text>The Triumph Motor Company was a British car and motor manufacturing company in the 19th and 20th centuries. The marque had its origins in 1885 when Siegfried Bettmann of Nuremberg formed S. Bettmann &amp; Co. and started importing bicycles from Europe and selling them under his own trade name in London. The trade name became &quot;Triumph&quot; the following year, and in 1887 Bettmann was joined by a partner, Moritz Schulte, also from Germany. In 1889, the businessmen started producing their own bicycles in Coventry, England.

Triumph manufactured its first car in 1923. The company was acquired by Leyland Motors in 1960, ultimately becoming part of the giant conglomerate British Leyland (BL) in 1968, where the Triumph brand was absorbed into BL&#x27;s &quot;Specialist Division&quot; alongside former Leyland stablemates Rover and Jaguar. Triumph-badged vehicles were produced by BL until 1984 when the Triumph marque was retired, where it remained dormant under the auspices of BL&#x27;s successor company Rover Group. The rights to the Triumph marque are currently owned by BMW, who purchased the Rover Group in 1994.

== History ==

=== Triumph Cycle Company (1897-1930) ===
S. Bettman &amp; Co. was renamed the Triumph Cycle Co. Ltd. in 1897. In 1902 they began producing Triumph motorcycles at their works in Coventry on Much Park Street. At first, they used engines purchased from another company, but the business prospered and they soon started making their own engines. In 1907 they purchased the premises of a spinning mill on Priory Street to develop a new factory. Major orders for the 550 cc Model H were placed by the British Army during the First World War; by 1918 Triumph had become Britain&#x27;s largest manufacturer of motorcycles.

In 1921 Bettmann was persuaded by his general manager Claude Holbrook (1886–1979), who had joined the company in 1919, to acquire the assets and Clay Lane premises of the Dawson Car Company and start producing a car and 1.4-litre engine type named the Triumph 10/20 designed for them by Lea-Francis, to whom they paid a royalty for every car sold. Production of this car and its immediate successors was moderate, but this changed with the introduction in 1927 of the Triumph Super 7, which sold in large numbers until 1934.

=== Triumph Motor Company (1930-1944) ===

In 1930 the company&#x27;s name was changed to Triumph Motor Company. Holbrook realised he could not compete with the larger car companies for the mass market, so he decided to produce expensive cars, and introduced the models &quot;Southern Cross&quot; and Gloria. At first they used engines made by Triumph but designed by Coventry Climax, but in 1937 Triumph started to produce engines to their own designs by Donald Healey, who had become the company&#x27;s experimental manager in 1934.

The company encountered financial problems however, and in 1936 the Triumph bicycle and motorcycle businesses were sold, the latter to Jack Sangster of Ariel to become Triumph Engineering Co Ltd. Healey purchased an Alfa Romeo 8C 2300 and developed a new car model with an Alfa inspired straight-8 engine type named the Triumph Dolomite. Three of these cars were made in 1934, one of which was used in competition and destroyed in an accident. The Dolomites manufactured from 1937 to 1940 were unrelated to these prototypes.

In July 1939 the Triumph Motor Company went into receivership and the factory, equipment and goodwill were offered for sale. The Thos. W. Ward scrapping company purchased Triumph, and placed Healey in charge as general manager, but the effects of the Second World War again stopped the production of cars; the Holbrook Lane works were completely destroyed by bombing in 1940.

=== Standard Triumph (1944-1960) ===


In November 1944 what was left of the Triumph Motor Company and the Triumph trade name were bought by the Standard Motor Company and a subsidiary &quot;Triumph Motor Company (1945) Limited&quot; was formed with production transferred to Standard&#x27;s factory at Canley, on the outskirts of Coventry. Triumph&#x27;s new owners had been supplying engines to Jaguar and its predecessor company since 1938. After an argument between Standard-Triumph managing director, Sir John Black, and William Lyons, the creator and owner of Jaguar, Black&#x27;s objective in acquiring the rights to the name and the remnants of the bankrupt Triumph business was to build a car to compete with the soon to be launched post-war Jaguars.

The pre-war Triumph models were not revived and in 1946 a new range of Triumphs was announced, starting with the Triumph Roadster. The Roadster had an aluminium body because steel was in short supply and surplus aluminium from aircraft production was plentiful. The same engine was used for the 1800 Town and Country saloon, later named the Triumph Renown, which was notable for the styling chosen by Standard-Triumph&#x27;s managing director Sir John Black. A similar style was also used for the subsequent Triumph Mayflower light saloon. All three of these models prominently sported the &quot;globe&quot; badge that had been used on pre-war models. When Sir John was forced to retire from the company this range of cars was discontinued without being replaced directly, sheet aluminium having by now become a prohibitively expensive alternative to sheet steel for most auto-industry purposes.

In the early 1950s it was decided to use the Triumph name for sporting cars and the Standard name for saloons and in 1953 the Triumph TR2 was initiated, the first of the TR series of sports cars that were produced until 1981. Curiously, the TR2 had a Standard badge on its front and the Triumph globe on its hubcaps.

Standard had been making a range of small saloons named the Standard Eight and Ten, and had been working on their replacements. The success of the TR range meant that Triumph was considered a more marketable name than Standard, and the new car was introduced in 1959 as the Triumph Herald. The last Standard car to be made in the UK was replaced in 1963 by the Triumph 2000.

=== Leyland and beyond (1960-1984) ===



Standard-Triumph was bought by Leyland Motors Ltd. in December 1960; Donald Stokes became chairman of the Standard-Triumph division in 1963. In 1967 Leyland Motor Corporation bought the Rover company and in 1968 Leyland Motor Corporation merged with British Motor Holdings (created out of the merger of the British Motor Corporation and Jaguar two years earlier) which resulted in the formation of British Leyland Motor Corporation. Triumph set up an assembly facility in Speke, Liverpool in 1960, gradually increasing the size of the company&#x27;s most modern factory to the point that it could produce 100,000 cars per year. However, only a maximum of 30,000 cars was ever produced as the plant was never put into full production use, being used largely as an assembly plant. During the 1960s and &#x27;70s Triumph sold a succession of Michelotti-styled saloons and sports cars, including the advanced Dolomite Sprint, which, in 1973, already had a 16-valve four-cylinder engine. It is alleged that many Triumphs of this era were unreliable, especially the 2.5 PI (petrol injection) with its fuel injection problems. In Australia, the summer heat caused petrol in the electric fuel pump to vapourise, resulting in frequent malfunctions. Although the injection system had proven itself in international competition, it lacked altitude compensation to adjust the fuel mixture at altitudes greater than above sea level. The Lucas system proved unpopular: Lucas did not want to develop it further, and Standard-Triumph dealers were reluctant to attend the associated factory and field-based training courses.

For most of its time under Leyland or BL ownership the Triumph marque belonged in the Specialist Division of the company, which went by the names of &quot;Rover Triumph&quot; and later &quot;Jaguar Rover Triumph&quot;, except for a brief period during the mid-1970s when all BL&#x27;s car marques or brands were grouped together under the name of Leyland Cars. The only all-new Triumph model initiated as &quot;Rover Triumph&quot; was the TR7, which was in production successively at three factories that were closed: Speke, the poorly run Leyland-era Standard-Triumph works in Liverpool, the original Standard works at Canley, Coventry and finally the Rover works in Solihull. Plans for an extended range based on the TR7, including a fastback variant codenamed &quot;Lynx&quot;, were ended when the Speke factory closed. The four-cylinder TR7 and its short-lived eight-cylindered derivative the TR8 were terminated when the road car section of the Solihull plant was closed (the plant continued to build Land Rovers.)

=== Demise of Triumph Cars ===

The last Triumph model was the Acclaim, introduced in 1981 and essentially a rebadged Honda Ballade built under licence from the Japanese carmaker Honda, at the former Morris Motors works in Cowley, Oxford. The Triumph name disappeared over the summer of 1984, when the Acclaim was replaced by the Rover 200, a rebadged version of Honda&#x27;s next generation Civic/Ballade model. This was the first phase of a rebranding of the Rover Group which would also see the Austin and Morris brands disappear by the end of the 1980s and the Rover brand dominate most of the company&#x27;s products. The BL car division had by then been named the Austin Rover Group, which also retired the Morris marque in 1984 as well as the Triumph brand.

=== Current ownership and possible revival ===

The trademark is owned currently by BMW, which acquired Triumph when it bought the Rover Group in 1994. When BMW sold Rover, it retained the Triumph and Riley marques. The Phoenix Consortium, which bought Rover, attempted to buy the Triumph brand, but BMW refused, saying that if Phoenix insisted, it would break the deal. The Standard marque was transferred to British Motor Heritage Limited. The Standard marque is still retained by British Motor Heritage, who also have the licence to use the Triumph marque in relation to the sale of spares and service of the existing &#x27;park&#x27; of Triumph cars.

Proposals were reportedly made in the early 2000s for BMW to market a cheaper, four cylinder, rear wheel drive car based on the Z4 Roadster to rival the Mazda MX-5. This new car was speculated to be branded as either an Austin-Healey or a Triumph. Development of the car took place, although production did not commence.

In 2005, it was reported that BMW&#x27;s Designworks studio in California proposed reviving the Triumph brand for use on the new Mini Roadster, branding and styling it as a Triumph. The idea was rejected by Mini dealers, averse to selling a second legacy brand and adding extra showrooms.

In 2011, BMW applied for a European trademark to use the Triumph laurel wreath badge on vehicles, as well as a wide variety of merchandise. The application was published in late 2012, and further stirred rumours regarding the revival of the Triumph brand. Piers Scott, head of corporate communications for BMW Australia stated in an interview with &quot;Drive&quot; that: &quot;[The Triumph brand] is always there to be rejuvenated should we choose, I don&#x27;t think people realise we have Triumph in our stable, but I struggle to see a place for it . I can&#x27;t think of anything that is in the production timeframe that would not be wearing a BMW badge - be it &#x27;i&#x27; or just BMW.&quot;In 2023, automotive design house Makkina (with permission from BMW) revealed the Triumph TR25 concept car for its 25th anniversary, as well as to celebrate the 100th anniversary of Triumph Cars itself. Based on the BMW i3S, the TR25 pays homage to the Triumph TR2 MVC575 &#x27;Jabbeke&#x27; of 1953, featuring many design cues from the record breaking car. Speaking with &quot;Auto Express&quot;, Makkina director Michael Ani stated that the TR25 is intended as a concept, although the BMW platform and powertrain provide scope to bring the car to production should the opportunity arise.

* Triumph Lynx

==Triumph-based models==

==Badging==

Globe

Pre-war Triumphs carried a stylised Globe badge, usually on the radiator grille, and this was also used on the first three models produced under Standard&#x27;s control.

Griffin

Standard had introduced a new badge in 1947 for their own models, first seen on the Vanguard, a highly stylised motif based on the wings of a Griffin. With the introduction of the TR2, a version of this badge appeared for the first time on the bonnet of a production Triumph, while the Globe continued to appear on the hubcaps. This same double-badging also appeared on the TR3 and TR4, the 2000 and the 1300.

However, the original Herald, Spitfire, Vitesse and GT6 models all carried only the Griffin badge on their bonnets/radiator grilles, with unadorned hubcaps.

The TR4A appeared with a Globe badge on the bonnet, apparently signifying a return to the original Triumph badging. This was short-lived, as a policy of Leylandisation mean that neither Globe nor Griffin appeared on subsequent models from the TR5 onwards, or on later versions of the Spitfire, GT6 and 2000.

Leyland

Leyland&#x27;s corporate badge, a design based on the spokes of a wheel, appeared on the hubcaps of the 1500FWD, and next to the Triumph name on the metal identification labels fitted to the bootlids of various models. It was also used for the oil filler cap on the Dolomite Sprint engine. However it was never used as a bonnet badge, with models of that era such as the TR6 and the second generation 2000 carrying a badge simply stating the name &quot;Triumph&quot;.

Stag

The Stag model carried a unique grille badge showing a highly stylised stag.

Laurel wreath

The last versions of the TR7 and Dolomite ranges received an all-new badge with the word Triumph surrounded by laurel wreaths, and this was also used for the Acclaim. It was carried on the bonnet and the steering wheel boss.

<text>Given an atmospheric pressure measurement, the pressure altitude is the imputed altitude that the International Standard Atmosphere (ISA) model predicts to have the same pressure as the observed value.

The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) published the following formula for directly converting atmospheric pressure in millibars (mb) to pressure altitude in feet (ft):
formula_1

In aviation, pressure altitude is the height above a standard datum plane (SDP), which is a theoretical level where the weight of the atmosphere is as measured by a barometer. It indicates altitude obtained when an altimeter is set to an agreed baseline pressure under certain circumstances in which the aircraft’s altimeter would be unable to give a useful altitude readout. Examples would be landing at a high altitude or near sea level under conditions of exceptionally high air pressure. Old altimeters were typically limited to displaying the altitude when set between 950 mb and 1030 mb. Standard pressure, the baseline used universally, is 1013.25 hectopascals (hPa), which is equivalent to 1013.25 mb or 29.92 inches of mercury (inHg). This setting is equivalent to the atmospheric pressure at mean sea level (MSL) in the ISA. Pressure altitude is primarily used in aircraft-performance calculations and in high-altitude flight (i.e., above the transition altitude).

== Inverse equation ==
Solving the equation for the pressure gives
formula_2
where are meter and refers to hecto-Pascal. This may be interpreted as the lowest terms of the Taylor expansion of
formula_3
where is the exponential function.

== QNE ==

QNE is an aeronautical code Q code. The term refers to the indicated altitude at the landing runway threshold when formula_4 or formula_5 is set in the altimeter&#x27;s Kollsman window. It is the pressure altitude at the landing runway threshold.

Most aviation texts for PPL and CPL exams describe a process for finding the pressure altitude (in feet) using one of the following rule of thumb formulae.

Internationally, pressure altitude is approximated as:
:formula_6
For example, if the airfield elevation is formula_7 and the QNH is formula_8, then
:formula_9

If the altimeter uses inches of mercury, as common in the United States, Canada, and Japan, the following formula is used:
:formula_10
For example, if the airfield elevation is formula_7 and the altimeter setting is formula_12, then
:formula_13

Aircraft Mode “C” transponders report the pressure altitude to air traffic control; corrections for atmospheric pressure variations are applied by the recipient of the data.

The relationship between static pressure and pressure altitude is defined in terms of properties of the ISA.

<doc id="365288" wikidata="Q699664" url="?curid=365288" title="Li Chengqian">
<text>Li Chéngqián (李承乾) (619 – 5 January 645), courtesy name Gaoming (高明), formally Prince Min of Hengshan (恆山愍王), was a crown prince of the Chinese Tang dynasty. He was Emperor Taizong&#x27;s oldest son and first crown prince, but was replaced later by his younger brother Li Zhi (the eventual Emperor Gaozong).

Li Chengqian was created crown prince in 626 at the age of eight (by East Asian reckoning), after his father became emperor on 4 September. In his youth, he had a reputation for good judgment, but was also said to be suffering from a foot illness. Later on, he was said to be frivolous, favoring Tujue customs instead of studying about ways to rule an empire. He lost favor in Emperor Taizong&#x27;s eyes to a younger brother, Li Tai the Prince of Wei. (Both had the same mother, Emperor Taizong&#x27;s wife Empress Zhangsun.) In 643, in fear that Emperor Taizong was about to depose him in favor of Li Tai, he plotted with the general Hou Junji to overthrow Emperor Taizong. The plot was discovered, and he was deposed and reduced to commoner rank, but Emperor Taizong, believing that Li Tai to be responsible for Li Chengqian&#x27;s downfall, appointed yet another son, Li Zhi (also by Empress Zhangsun), crown prince instead. Li Chengqian was exiled, and died in exile in January 645, as a commoner under house arrest. He was posthumously granted an imperial prince title during the reign of his grandnephew, Emperor Xuanzong after his grandson Li Shizhi became chancellor.

== Early life ==
Li Chengqian was born in 619, not long after his grandfather Emperor Gaozu established Tang dynasty in 618. He was the first son of Emperor Gaozu&#x27;s son Li Shimin the Prince of Qin and Li Shimin&#x27;s wife Princess Zhangsun, and was named Chengqian because he was born at Chengqian Hall (承乾殿). In 620, he was created the Prince of Hengshan, at the same time that his younger brothers Li Ke and Li Tai were also created princes.

== Early years as crown prince ==
In 626, Li Shimin seized power after ambushing and killing his older brother Li Jiancheng, the Crown Prince, and younger brother Li Yuanji, the Prince of Qi, at the Incident at Xuanwu Gate, and later that year, Emperor Gaozu yielded the throne to him (as Emperor Taizong). Emperor Taizong created Li Chengqian&#x27;s mother Princess Zhangsun empress, and created Li Chengqian crown prince. In 630, in order to show honor to the chancellor Du Ruhui in Du&#x27;s illness, Emperor Taizong sent Li Chengqian to personally visit Du. Later that year, Emperor Taizong formally made Li Chengqian in charge of listening to legal appeals where the litigants were dissatisfied with the judgments made by the executive bureau of the government (尚書省, &quot;Shangshu Sheng&quot;), putting a layer of appeal between the executive bureau and the emperor himself. The senior officials Li Gang (李綱) and Xiao Yu were made his senior advisors, and whenever Li Chengqian were officially hearing governmental matters, he would be accompanied by Li Gang and the chancellor Fang Xuanling. In 631, he held his official rite of passage. In winter 632, after a feast Emperor Taizong held for Emperor Gaozu (then with the title &quot;Taishang Huang&quot; (retired emperor)) at Emperor Gaozu&#x27;s Da&#x27;an Palace (大安宮), Emperor Taizong wanted to hold up Emperor Gaozu&#x27;s litter personally; Emperor Gaozu disallowed it, but had Li Chengqian take Emperor Taizong&#x27;s place in doing so. Meanwhile, by 633, Li Chengqian was said to be beginning to favor frivolous games, and his staff members Yu Zhining, Du Zhenglun, and Kong Yingda often advised him to not do so. Emperor Taizong approved of Yu, Du, and Kong, and rewarded them.

On 25 June 635, Emperor Gaozu died. Emperor Taizong observed a period of mourning for him. During that time, Li Chengqian formally ruled on important matters of state for about 45 days, after which Emperor Taizong resumed his imperial authority, but still had Li Chengqian rule on more minor issues. It was around this time that Li Chengqian was said to have good judgment and logical abilities. From this point on, whenever Emperor Taizong was away from the capital Chang&#x27;an, Li Chengqian would be in charge of the imperial government.

In 636, Li Chengqian&#x27;s mother Empress Zhangsun was seriously ill. Li Chengqian suggested to her that a general pardon be declared and that people be encouraged to become Buddhist or Taoist monks to try to gain divine favor. Empress Zhangsun disallowed it, disfavoring pardons herself and knowing that Emperor Taizong also disapproved of Buddhism and Taoism. Li Chengqian then discussed the matter with Fang, who relayed his request to Emperor Taizong. Emperor Taizong wanted to declare a general pardon, but was dissuaded by Empress Zhangsun. She died later that year, on 28 July.

== Struggles against Li Tai ==
By this point, Li Tai, who was considered intelligent and talented in literature, had gained Emperor Taizong&#x27;s favor over Li Chengqian—so much so that in 638, Emperor Taizong let it slip out that it was not impossible that an imperial prince would one day be his officials&#x27; overlord, when Wang Gui suggested that high level officials not be required to bow to imperial princes other than the crown prince. Li Chengqian, meanwhile, was allowing his games to interfere with his studies, despite urgings of his advisor Zhang Xuansu (張玄素). At one point, after Zhang expressed disapproval of his playing drums, Li Chengqian destroyed his drums, but was not otherwise listening to Zhang&#x27;s advice.

In 641, When Emperor Taizong visited the eastern capital Luoyang, Li Chengqian was in charge of Chang&#x27;an, assisted by the chancellor Gao Shilian (his granduncle). Around that time, Li Chengqian had gathered a group of guards who served as his personal assassins, and when he grew angry at the earnest urgings by Yu Zhining, he sent his assassins Zhang Shizheng (張師政) and Gegan Chengji (紇干承基) to kill Yu, although Zhang and Gegan, when they saw that Yu was observing a mourning period for his mother, relented and did not kill Yu. Meanwhile, in 642, with Li Tai engaging many scholars on staff, Emperor Taizong had increased Li Tai&#x27;s stipend so much that it exceeded Li Chengqian&#x27;s. The official Chu Suiliang, whose advice Emperor Taizong usually listened to, advised against this, believing that this would bring conflict. Instead, Emperor Taizong removed all limits on Li Chengqian&#x27;s spending, causing Li Chengqian to be wasteful. When Zhang advised against wastefulness, Li Chengqian became so displeased that he sent servants to attack Zhang with large whips, almost killing him. With Emperor Taizong&#x27;s favors for Li Tai apparent, there began to be a faction that supported Li Chengqian and a faction that supported Li Tai at court. In order to quell the speculations about Li Tai&#x27;s replacing Li Chengqian, Emperor Taizong made the honored chancellor Wei Zheng Li Chengqian&#x27;s senior advisor, but this failed to end the rumors. The rumors also continued to persist even after Emperor Taizong publicly declared in spring 643 that even if Li Chengqian died (as Li Chengqian&#x27;s foot illness—the historical accounts did not specify what kind of illness—was well known among the officials), Li Chengqian&#x27;s son Li Xiang (李象) would inherit the throne, not another prince.

It was said that Li Chengqian favored music, women, and hunting, and was wasteful in pursuing these things, but at the same time maintained a veneer of virtue to the outside world. Among his guards, he often took on Turkic customs, wearing Turkic clothes and spoke Turkic, often engaging in Turkic-style camping. Meanwhile, several other acts of Li Chengqian were also drawing Emperor Taizong&#x27;s ire. Li Chengqian had a young musician as his catamite, whom he nicknamed Chengxin (稱心, meaning, &quot;satisfying my heart&quot;). He had also favored Taoist monks Qin Ying (秦英) and Wei Lingfu (韋靈符), and he had them use magic—acts that were considered extremely disapproved among imperial subjects. When Emperor Taizong found out about these things, he put Chengxin and the Taoist monks all to death. Li Chengqian, believing that it was Li Tai who informed Emperor Taizong, became increasingly angry with Li Tai, and he, in sadness over Chengxin&#x27;s death, also refused to attend imperial gatherings for months, while establishing a shrine for Chengxin within his palace.

== Removal and death ==
Meanwhile, Li Tai was having officials who were in his faction often spread news about Li Tai&#x27;s abilities, trying to create an impression among the people that Li Tai should be crown prince. Li Chengqian was becoming increasingly insecure, and he began to discuss within his own faction what to do. His closest allies included his uncle Li Yuanchang (李元昌) the Prince of Han, the imperial guard commander Li Anyan (李安儼), his cousin Zhao Jie (趙節), and Du Ruhui&#x27;s son and his brother-in-law Du He (杜荷). Eventually, he also invited the major general Hou Junji, whose son-in-law Helan Chushi (賀蘭楚石) was Li Chengqian&#x27;s guard commander, into the plot, and considered overthrowing Emperor Taizong.

In spring 643, however, Li Chengqian&#x27;s younger brother Li You (李祐) the Prince of Qi, resentful of the head of his household, Quan Wanji (權萬紀), killed Quan and then rebelled. Li You was soon defeated and captured, and when Emperor Taizong investigated Li You&#x27;s co-conspirators, Gegan Chengji was arrested and sentenced to death. Gegan, in order to save himself, revealed the plot. Emperor Taizong, in shock, convened the senior officials Zhangsun Wuji (Empress Zhangsun&#x27;s brother), Fang Xuanling, Xiao Yu, and Li Shiji, as well as officials from the supreme court, the legislative bureau, and the examination bureau, to investigate, and the extent of the plot was revealed. When Emperor Taizong requested opinions on what to do with Li Chengqian, Lai Ji suggested sparing him, and Emperor Taizong agreed. On 29 April, he deposed Li Chengqian and reduced him to commoner rank, while ordering Li Yuanchang to commit suicide. Hou and the other conspirators were all executed.

Emperor Taizong initially told Li Tai that he would be created crown prince, but soon came to believe that Li Tai&#x27;s machinations were responsible for Li Chengqian&#x27;s downfall. When Emperor Taizong himself visited Li Chengqian, Li Chengqian told him:

:&quot;I was already crown prince, and what else could I be looking for. It is because Li Tai often conspired against me, and I had to therefore discuss with my staff how to save myself. Those overly ambitious people thus suggested that I commit treason. If you create Li Tai crown prince, you are falling into his trap.&quot;

Emperor Taizong agreed, and as Zhangsun Wuji proposed creating another son by Empress Zhangsun, Li Zhi the Prince of Jin, crown prince, Emperor Taizong did so, putting Li Tai under house arrest as well and reducing his title, although keeping the title a princely title. In fall 643, Emperor Taizong exiled both Li Chengqian and Li Tai—in the case of Li Chengqian, to Qian Prefecture (黔州, modern southeastern Chongqing).

Around the new year 645, Li Chengqian died at Cheng Prefecture. Emperor Taizong ordered that he be buried with the honors due a duke. After Li Chengqian&#x27;s grandson Li Shizhi became chancellor during the reign of Li Chengqian&#x27;s grandnephew Emperor Xuanzong, he often spoke to Emperor Xuanzong in defense of his grandfather. On 6 October 736, Emperor Xuanzong posthumously honored Li Chengqian the Prince of Hengshan—a title that he previously held—and gave him the posthumous name of Min (愍, meaning &quot;suffering&quot;). On 20 Jun 738, he was buried at his father&#x27;s mausoleum, Zhao Mausoleum.

<text>Li Tai (; 620 – 14 January 653), courtesy name Huibao (惠褒), nickname Qingque (青雀), formally Prince Gong of Pu (濮恭王), was an imperial prince of the Chinese Tang dynasty.

Li Tai, who carried the title of Prince of Wei (魏王; &quot;Wei wang&quot;), was favored by his father, Emperor Taizong, for his literary talent and studiousness. His older brother Li Chengqian was crown prince, but Li Tai and his associates had design on that position, eventually pushing Li Chengqian to plot treason in 643. After Li Chengqian&#x27;s plot was discovered, Li Chengqian was deposed, and Emperor Taizong agreed to create Li Tai the new crown prince. However, Emperor Taizong soon saw that Li Tai had pushed Li Chengqian toward rebellion by machination and further appeared to bear ill intentions toward their younger brother Li Zhi the Prince of Jin, and so Emperor Taizong created Li Zhi crown prince instead. Li Tai was reduced in rank and briefly put under house arrest, and then exiled. He died in exile in 653.

The Buddhist statues in the Main Wall of Bingyang South Cave of the Longmen Caves was dedicated by Li Tai to his deceased mother Empress Zhangsun.

== Early life ==
Li Tai was the fourth son of Li Shimin, then the Prince of Qin under his father Emperor Gaozu of Tang. His mother was Li Shimin&#x27;s wife Princess Zhangsun, who had given birth to his older brother Li Chengqian previously and would have one other son later (Li Zhi) and three daughters (the future Princess Changle, Jinyang, and Xincheng). In 620, he was created the Prince of Yidu, at the same time that Li Chengqian and another older brother, Li Ke (by Li Shimin&#x27;s concubine Consort Yang (a daughter of Emperor Yang of Sui)) were also created princes. In 621, he was created the Prince of Wei (衛, different than his later title of 魏) and posthumously adopted into the line of his uncle Li Xuanba (李玄霸), who had died early without issue.

In 626, Li Shimin, in an intense rivalry with his older brother Li Jiancheng the Crown Prince, ambushed Li Jiancheng and another brother who supported Li Jiancheng, Li Yuanji the Prince of Qi, at Xuanwu Gate and killed them. He then effectively forced Emperor Gaozu to first create him crown prince and then yield the throne to him (as Emperor Taizong). He created Li Tai&#x27;s mother Princess Zhangsun empress and Li Tai&#x27;s older brother Li Chengqian crown prince. In 628, Li Tai&#x27;s title was changed to Prince of Yue (Taizong made another royal member Li Baoding (李保定) heir to Li Xuanba instead of him), and he was made the commandant at Yang Prefecture (揚州, roughly modern Yangzhou, Jiangsu), but was not sent to Yang Prefecture, remaining at the capital Chang&#x27;an instead. In 633, he was made the commandant at Fu Prefecture (鄜州, roughly modern Yan&#x27;an, Shaanxi), but also appeared to not have been sent there, and in 634 he became the prefect of the capital prefecture Yong Prefecture (雍州).

== As Prince of Wei ==
In 636, Li Tai&#x27;s title was changed to Prince of Wei (魏), and he was made the commandant at Xiang Prefecture (相州, roughly modern Handan, Hebei), but again, he was not sent there, but remained at Chang&#x27;an. By this point, Emperor Taizong had begun to favor Li Tai greatly for his literary talent, he permitted Li Tai to retain a staff of scholars, and also, because Li Tai was obese, allowed him to ride a litter into the palace rather than walk. When rumors reached him that the high-level officials dishonored Li Tai, he grew angry at them, but relented after the chancellor Wei Zheng pointed out that, in fact, according to Confucian ceremonies, those high-level officials were in fact supposed to be higher in rank than Li Tai. In 637, Emperor Taizong made the senior official Wang Gui, a one-time chancellor, Li Tai&#x27;s teacher, and he ordered Li Tai to honor Wang as if he were honoring his own father. Li Tai did so, and Wang accepted this. In 640, Emperor Taizong personally visited Li Tai&#x27;s mansion, and to celebrate the occasion, Emperor Taizong pardoned the minor criminals of Chang&#x27;an, exempted Li Tai&#x27;s neighborhood of its taxes for one year, and gave awards to Li Tai&#x27;s staff members and the seniors in Li Tai&#x27;s neighborhood.

Meanwhile, Li Tai&#x27;s staff member Su Xu (蘇勖) suggested to him that, like the talented princes in past dynasties, he should commission a major literary work, so Li Tai commissioned the work &quot;Journal of Geography&quot; (&quot;Kuodi Zhi&quot;) and retained the officials Xiao Deyan (蕭德言), Gu Yin (顧胤), Jiang Yaqing (蔣亞卿), and Xie Yan (謝偃) to head the project. Initially, the work was drafted at Chang&#x27;an, and his staff scholars received so many visitors among the noble youths that they were distracted from their work. Li Tai saw that their time was not being productive, and so sent them out to the field—the various prefectures—to collect data and write. It took four years for Li Tai&#x27;s scholars to complete the work, which had 550 volumes. The work was completed in 642, and Emperor Taizong rewarded Li Tai with a large supply of silk. By this point, Li Tai&#x27;s staff was growing so large that the imperial stipend to Li Tai exceeded that to Li Chengqian. The official Chu Suiliang suggested to Emperor Taizong that this was improper, and Emperor Taizong agreed—but rather than reducing Li Tai&#x27;s stipend, he removed all limits on Li Chengqian&#x27;s spending, which led to Li Chengqian, who was already wasteful in his lifestyle, to be even more wasteful. Emperor Taizong also had Li Tai move to Wude Palace (武德殿), next to Li Chengqian&#x27;s palace—an action that Wei Zheng considered inappropriate, and so Emperor Taizong reversed.

== Struggles with Li Chengqian ==
Meanwhile, Li Chengqian was losing favor with Emperor Taizong over his wastefulness and favor for games rather than study. He also suffered from a foot illness that the nature was not specified in historical accounts. Li Tai began to have ambitions on displacing his older brother as crown prince, and a number of officials, seeing this as an opportunity, began to congregate around Li Tai, causing the government to divide into Li Tai&#x27;s faction and Li Chengqian&#x27;s faction. In 642, in order to dispel rumors that he was about to replace Li Chengqian with Li Tai, Emperor Taizong made Wei Zheng, then ill, Li Chengqian&#x27;s senior advisor, but that failed to stop the rumors. Meanwhile, Li Tai&#x27;s chiefs of staff, Wei Ting (韋挺) and Du Chuke (杜楚客, brother to the deceased chancellor Du Ruhui), were making plans for Li Tai to enhance his reputation and defame Li Chengqian, and the public began to perceive Li Chengqian negatively.

By 643, Li Chengqian was so fearful that Emperor Taizong was about to depose him that he conspired with a number of officials, including the major general Hou Junji, Emperor Taizong&#x27;s brother Li Yuanchang (李元昌) the Prince of Han, the imperial guard commander Li Anyan (李安儼), his cousin Zhao Jie (趙節), and Du Chuke&#x27;s nephew Du He (杜荷, Du Ruhui&#x27;s son), to overthrow Emperor Taizong. That summer, however, Li You (李祐) the Prince of Qi, a younger brother to both Li Chengqian and Li Tai, resentful of the head of his household, Quan Wanji (權萬紀), killed Quan and then rebelled. Li You was soon defeated and captured, and when Emperor Taizong investigated Li You&#x27;s co-conspirators, Li Chengqian&#x27;s associate Gegan Chengji (紇干承基), who had been an assassin for Li Chengqian and was involved in his conspiracy, was arrested and sentenced to death. Gegan, in order to save himself, revealed the plot. Emperor Taizong, in shock, convened the senior officials Zhangsun Wuji (Empress Zhangsun&#x27;s brother), Fang Xuanling, Xiao Yu, and Li Shiji, as well as officials from the supreme court, the legislative bureau, and the examination bureau, to investigate, and the extent of the plot was revealed. When Emperor Taizong requested opinions on what to do with Li Chengqian, Lai Ji suggested sparing him, and Emperor Taizong agreed. He deposed Li Chengqian and reduced him to commoner rank, while ordering Li Yuanchang to commit suicide. Hou and the other conspirators were all executed.

== Exile and death ==
After Li Chengqian was arrested, Li Tai visited Emperor Taizong everyday, and Emperor Taizong promised to create him crown prince—an idea that was also suggested by the officials Cen Wenben and Liu Ji. However, Zhangsun Wuji suggested that Li Zhi, also favored by Emperor Taizong, be created crown prince. In order to persuade Emperor Taizong to create him crown prince, Li Tai told Emperor Taizong that he would agree to kill his own son and make Li Zhi crown prince should he be allowed to inherit the throne. However, the statement backfired, as Chu Suiliang pointed out that the statement could not possibly be an honest one, and that in effect, there was the potential that, if Li Tai were created crown prince, the situation between Li Chengqian and Li Tai might repeat itself. Li Tai, meanwhile, made comments to Li Zhi that he should be worried in light of his friendship with Li Yuanchang—comments that Li Zhi told Emperor Taizong, who then began regretting promising Li Tai the crown prince position. Further, when Emperor Taizong visited Li Chengqian to rebuke him, Li Chengqian accused Li Tai of machinations against him, causing him to plot treason. Depressed over the actions of Li Chengqian, Li Tai, Li You, and Li Yuanchang, Emperor Taizong summoned Zhangsun, Fang Xuanling, Li Shiji, and Chu to a private meeting, during which he told them his intent to create Li Zhi crown prince instead. Later that day, when Li Tai tried to enter the palace to visit Emperor Taizong. Emperor Taizong put him under house arrest, and the next day created Li Zhi crown prince.

Several days later, Li Tai was removed from his official posts and reduced in rank to Prince of Donglai. Emperor Taizong exiled his close associates and reduced Du Chuke to commoner rank. Two months later, Li Tai was created the Prince of Shunyang instead. In fall 643, Emperor Taizong exiled both Li Chengqian and Li Tai—in Li Tai&#x27;s case, to Jun Prefecture (均州, roughly modern Shiyan, Hubei). Emperor Taizong was gut-wrenched about the decision, and he stated:

:&quot;The love between father and son is a natural one. It is difficult for me to separate from Li Tai, and I cannot bear this. However, I am the lord of all under heaven, and as long as the people can be safe, I can cut off my personal love.&quot;

He also showed Li Tai&#x27;s well-written submissions in the past to his close officials and stated:

:&quot;Li Tai is exceedingly talented. I miss him, and all of you know this. However, for the sake of the empire, I have to cut off my relationship with him with righteousness. I let him live far away to try to make everyone safe.&quot;

In 647, Li Tai&#x27;s title was upgraded to Prince of Pu. After Emperor Taizong died in 649, Li Zhi succeeded him as Emperor Gaozong. Emperor Gaozong permitted the princes from outlying prefectures to all come to Chang&#x27;an to attend Emperor Taizong&#x27;s funeral, but Li Tai was not permitted to do so. Later that year, Emperor Gaozong did permit Li Tai to again retain a staff, and ordered that he be supplied with high quality supplies of wagons, food, and clothing. Li Tai died in 653. His son Li Xin (李欣) inherited his title.

<text>Oliver Wellington &quot;Billy&quot; Sipple (November 20, 1941 – January 1989) was an American man known for intervening to prevent an assassination attempt against U.S. President Gerald Ford on September 22, 1975. A decorated U.S. Marine and disabled Vietnam War veteran, he grappled with Sara Jane Moore as she fired a pistol at Ford in San Francisco, causing her to miss. The subsequent public revelation that Sipple was gay turned the news story into a cause célèbre for LGBTQ rights activists, leading Sipple to sue, unsuccessfully, several publishers for invasion of privacy, and causing his estrangement from his parents.

==Early life==
Sipple was born in Detroit, Michigan. He served in the United States Marine Corps and fought in Vietnam. Shrapnel wounds suffered in December 1968 caused him to finish out his second tour of duty in a Philadelphia veterans&#x27; hospital, from which he was released in March 1970. Sipple, who was closeted in his hometown of Detroit, had met Harvey Milk in New York City and had participated in San Francisco&#x27;s gay pride parades and gay rights demonstrations. Sipple was active in local causes, including the historic political campaigns of openly gay Board of Supervisors candidate Milk. The two were friends and Sipple would also be later described as a &quot;prominent figure&quot; in the gay community who had worked in a gay bar and was active in the Imperial Court System.

He lived with a merchant seaman in a fourth-floor walk-up apartment located in San Francisco&#x27;s Mission District. He later spent six months in San Francisco&#x27;s VA hospital, and was frequently readmitted into the hospital in 1975, the year he saved Ford&#x27;s life.

==Ford assassination attempt==
On September 22, 1975, Sipple was part of a crowd of about 3,000 people who had gathered outside San Francisco&#x27;s St. Francis Hotel to see President Ford. Standing beside Sipple, about 40 feet (12 meters) from Ford, was Sara Jane Moore. When Moore shot at Ford with a .38 revolver, narrowly missing Ford, Sipple dove towards her and grabbed her arm; the gun fired again, striking a bystander.

Initial news reports noted that Sipple was a former Marine, but did not mention that he was gay.
Though he was known within the San Francisco gay community, and had participated in gay pride events, he had kept his sexual orientation secret from his family and employer; he asked the press to keep his homosexuality off the record.

The day after the incident, &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; columnist Herb Caen received two phone messages identifying Sipple as gay. One was from Reverend Ray Broshears, the head of a gay activist group called the Lavender Panthers. The other was from local gay activist Harvey Milk, a friend of Sipple on whose city council campaign Sipple had worked. 
Milk wanted to portray Sipple as a &quot;gay hero&quot; to help &quot;break the stereotype of homosexuals [as] timid, weak and unheroic figures&quot;;&lt;ref name=&quot;latimes2/13/89&quot;&gt;Morain, Dan (February 13, 1989). &quot;Sorrow Trailed a Veteran Who Saved a President and Then Was Cast in an Unwanted Spotlight&quot;, &quot;The Los Angeles Times&quot;, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;
he told a friend, &quot;It&#x27;s too good an opportunity. For once we can show that gays do heroic things, not just all that caca about molesting children and hanging out in bathrooms.&quot; According to historian Harold Evans, &quot;[T]here was no invitation to the White House for Sipple, not even a commendation. Milk made a fuss about that.&quot; Three days after the incident, Sipple received a letter from President Ford. It read:

Two days after the thwarted assassination attempt, unable to reach Sipple, Caen wrote of Sipple as a gay man, and of a friend of Milk, speculating Ford offered praise &quot;quietly&quot; because of Sipple&#x27;s sexual orientation. Sipple was besieged by reporters, as was his family. His mother refused to speak to him. Gay liberation groups petitioned local media to give Sipple his due as a hero. Caen published the private side of Sipple&#x27;s story, as did a handful of other publications. Sipple then insisted to reporters that his sexuality be kept confidential. Reporters labeled Sipple the &quot;gay ex-Marine&quot;, and his mother disparaged and disowned him. Later, when Sipple hid in a friend&#x27;s apartment to avoid reporters, they turned to Milk, arguably the most visible voice for the gay community. Of President Ford&#x27;s letter of thanks to Sipple, Milk suggested that Sipple&#x27;s sexual orientation was the reason he received only a note, rather than an invitation to the White House.

Sipple sued the &quot;Chronicle&quot;, filing a $15-million invasion of privacy suit against Caen, seven named newspapers, and a number of unnamed publishers. In 1984, a state court of appeals held that Sipple had indeed become news, and that his sexual orientation was part of the story.

==Later years and death==
According to a 2006 article in &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, Sipple went through a period of estrangement with his parents, but the family later reconciled with him. Sipple&#x27;s brother, George, told the newspaper, &quot;[Our parents] accepted it. That was all. They didn&#x27;t like it, but they still accepted. He was welcomed. Only thing was: Don&#x27;t bring a lot of your friends.&quot; However, other sources indicate that Sipple&#x27;s parents never fully accepted him. His mother, just after news broke of Sipple&#x27;s sexual orientation, hung up on Sipple, saying she never wished to speak to him again. His father is said to have told Sipple&#x27;s brother to &quot;forget [he had] a brother.&quot; Finally, when his mother died, his father did not allow him to attend her funeral.

Sipple&#x27;s mental and physical health sharply declined over the years. He began to drink heavily, was diagnosed with schizophrenia and fitted with a pacemaker, and gained weight. He sometimes expressed regret about grabbing Moore&#x27;s gun because of the publicity it had brought him. On February 2, 1989, an acquaintance, Wayne Friday, found Sipple dead in his San Francisco apartment, with a bottle of Jack Daniel&#x27;s next to him and the television still on. The San Francisco coroner estimated Sipple had been dead for approximately 10 days. He was 47 years old. Ford and his wife sent a letter of sympathy to Sipple&#x27;s family and friends. He was buried in Golden Gate National Cemetery south of San Francisco.

In a 2001 interview with columnist Deb Price, Ford disputed the claim that he had treated Sipple differently because of his sexual orientation, saying,
Issues arising from the press&#x27;s reporting of Sipple&#x27;s private life are referred to in the motion picture &quot;Absence of Malice&quot; and in an episode of &quot;LA Law&quot;. A number of law review articles, books, commentary pieces have discussed &quot;the perplexing ethical dimensions of the case&quot;.
==In Popular Culture==

Oliver Sipple’s story was shared in a 2017 episode of the WNYC radio program RadioLab. The program airs in syndication on National Public Radio.

<text>The Triumph Stag is a 2+2 sports tourer which was sold between 1970 and 1978 by the British Triumph Motor Company, styled by Italian designer Giovanni Michelotti.

== Design and styling ==
Envisioned as a luxury sports car, the Stag was designed to compete directly with the Mercedes-Benz SL class models. All Stags were four-seater convertible coupés, but for structural rigidity – and to meet proposed American rollover standards of the time – the Stag required a B-pillar &quot;roll bar&quot; hoop connected to the windscreen frame by a T-bar. A body-colour removable hard top with defrost wires on the rear window, full headliner and lever operated quarter windows was a popular factory option.

The car started as a styling experiment cut and shaped from a 1963–64 pre-production 2000 saloon, also styled by Giovanni Michelotti. His agreement was, if Harry Webster, Director of Engineering at Triumph, liked the design, Triumph could use the prototype as the basis for a new model. Webster loved the design and took the prototype back to England. The result, a two-door drophead (convertible), had little in common with the styling of its progenitor 2000, but retained the suspension and drive line. Triumph liked the Michelotti design so much that they propagated the styling lines of the Stag into the new T2000/T2500 Mark II saloon and estate model lines of the 1970s.

Triumph gave new projects four-letter development code names (e.g. Bomb for the Spitfire) and the Stag was the only Triumph to take its development code name into production.

== Engineering ==
The initial Stag design used the saloon&#x27;s 2.0-litre six cylinder engine which was intended to be uprated to 2.5-litres for production cars, but Webster intended the Stag, large saloons and estate cars to use a new Triumph-designed overhead cam (OHC) 2.5-litre fuel injected (PI) V8. In 1968, under the direction of Engineering Director Harry Webster and his successor as Chief Engineer, Spen King, the new 2.5 PI V8 was enlarged to to increase the power available. To meet emission standards in the US, a key target market, the troublesome mechanical fuel injection was dropped in favour of dual Zenith-Stromberg 175 CDSE carburettors. In common with several other manufacturers, a key aim of Triumph&#x27;s engineering strategy at the time was to create a family of in-line and V engines of different size around a common crankshaft. The various configurations Triumph envisaged would enable the production of four-, six-, and eight-cylinder power plants of capacity between 1.5 and 4 litres, sharing many parts, and hence offering economies of manufacturing scale and of mechanic training. A number of iterations of Triumph&#x27;s design went into production, notably a 2.0-litre slant four-cylinder engine used in the later Dolomite and TR7, and a variant manufactured by StanPart that was initially used in the Saab 99. In 1968 the Saab variant became the first of these engines to be fitted to a production car, followed by the Stag V8 in 1970. Sometimes described as two four-cylinder engines siamesed together, it is more strictly correct to say the four-cylinder versions were the left half of a Stag engine.

It has sometimes been alleged Triumph was instructed to use the all-aluminium Rover V8, originally designed by Buick and under development by Rover at the time, but claimed it would not &quot;fit&quot;. Installation testing of both the Triumph V8 and the Rover V8 was carried out in May/June 1967, the conclusion being that the engine was too tall and that front structure changes would be necessary. It was decided not to further hold up Stag development and to proceed with the Triumph V8 unit. Although later enthusiasts have shown that it can be made to fit the space, the decision to go with the Triumph V8 was probably more due to the Buick&#x27;s lack of British sales experience, the fact that there was not a manual gearbox offered by Rover at the time, and that the different torque characteristics and weight would have entailed substantial re-engineering of the Stag when it was already behind schedule. Such a substitution would also have required a rethinking of the wider engineering strategy, both of which were important &quot;fit&quot; considerations beyond the comparatively trivial matter of the relative dimensions of the two engines. Furthermore, Rover, also owned by Leyland Motor Corporation at the time, could not necessarily have supplied the numbers of V8 engines required to match the anticipated production of the Stag.

As in the 2000 model line, unitary construction was employed, as was fully independent suspension: MacPherson struts in front, semi-trailing arms at the rear. Braking was by front disc and rear drum brakes, while steering was power-assisted rack and pinion.

== Production ==

The car was launched nearly two years late in June 1970, to a warm welcome at the international auto shows. In the UK the Stag was an immediate success for Triumph with a 12-month waiting list rapidly being established and cars changing hands at well above list price, but when it was released into the US, its main target market, it rapidly acquired a reputation for mechanical unreliability, usually in the form of overheating. These problems arose from a variety of causes.

First, the collaboration with Saab on the related slant 4 engine gave rise to design features being carried over to the V8, some of them questionable from an engineering perspective. For example, because the Saab 99 placed the engine back to front in the engine bay, the traditional mounting of the water pump on the front face was not possible. The answer for the Saab engine was to place the water pump within the top of the engine block, which is a higher position than is usual. Due to the use of a common machining line for both the slant 4 and the V8, this positioning was copied to the V8. If the engine became hot in traffic, and coolant escaped from the cooling system via the expansion bottle, the volume of fluid left when the engine cooled down again fell. If this was not noticed and it continued to occur, the coolant level would eventually fall below that of the pump, which would be unable to circulate the coolant. Overheating would result, often accompanied by pump failure. Water pump failures also sometimes occurred due to poorly-hardened drive gears, which wore out prematurely and stopped the water pump. Once this key component of the cooling system had failed, overheating ensued.

A second cause of engine trouble was the lack of attention to corrosion inhibitor in the coolant. The block was made from iron and the heads from aluminium, a combination that required the use of corrosion-inhibiting antifreeze all year round. This point was not widely appreciated by owners or by the dealer network supporting them. Consequently, engines were affected by electrolytic corrosion, and white alloy oxide sludge collected in radiator cores, reducing radiator efficiency and again causing overheating. The result was head gasket failure due to cylinder head heat distortion, a very expensive repair. Owners would usually get their repaired cars back with the radiator still clogged, leading to repeat failures.

A third cause of trouble was the engine&#x27;s use of long, simplex roller link chains, which would first stretch and then often fail inside fewer than , resulting in expensive damage. Even before failing, a stretched timing chain would skip links and cause valves to lift and fall in the wrong sequence, so that valves hit pistons and damaged both. This fault may have been worsened by poor quality chains.

Another problem with the cylinder heads was said to be the arrangement of cylinder head fixing studs, half of which were vertical and the other half of which were at an angle. Anecdotally, this arrangement was used to reduce production costs, as the cylinder head mounting studs and bolt were all accessible with the rocker covers fitted. This allowed the factory to assemble the cylinder head completely before fitting to the engine. This arrangement worked well enough on the 4-cylinder engines, but in the V8 the angled and vertical studs, when heated and cooled, expanded and contracted in different directions sufficiently to give rise to sideways forces that caused warping of the engine block. The problem was made worse by the engine&#x27;s propensity to overheat.

Finally, although pre-production engines were built meticulously, those fitted to production cars were not subject to the same careful quality control. Engines are still being discovered with casting sand and core wire inside, blocking the coolant passages and causing overheating.

This combination of manufacturing and maintenance flaws led to some engine failures in the UK but in the US the situation was exacerbated by the need to fit low compression pistons to comply with California&#x27;s low octane petrol requirements, and the associated advance in ignition timing to meet that country&#x27;s continually changing emission regulations. The result was that the engine developed greater heat and, when automatic transmission and air conditioning were fitted, the engine cooling ability was overly compromised. Although US cars were fitted with engine cowls to try to compensate, all too often the result of a freeway tailback was an overheating engine. &quot;Time&quot; magazine rated the Triumph Stag as one of the 50 worst cars ever made.

British Leyland never materially re-engineered the Triumph 3.0 litre OHC V8 to address these issues, other than introducing a domed piston to aid combustion and a high-pressure cooling system that boiled over at a higher temperature. Another problem was that the Stag was always a relatively rare car. British Leyland had around 2,500 UK dealers when the Stag was on sale and a total of around 19,000 were sold in the UK over seven years. Thus the average dealer sold only seven or eight Stags during the car&#x27;s production run, or roughly one car per year. This meant that few dealers saw defective Stags often enough to recognise and diagnose the cause of the various problems.

A number of owners replaced the troublesome engine with units from other cars, such as the Rover V8, or the Triumph 2.5-litre engine around which the Stag was originally designed. The number of such conversions undertaken is not known, but as at September 2024, fewer than 6% of surviving Stags known to DVLA have a 3.5-litre engine or larger, according to www.howmanyleft.com., while 92% have a 3-litre engine. It is not clear how many of these are original 3-litre Stag engines and how many are Ford Essex units. It is thought by the relevant owners club that the Ford engine powers fewer Stags than does the Rover V8.

The last production Stag (BOL88V) is kept at the Heritage Motor Centre, Warwickshire.

== Mark I and Mark II variants ==
Perhaps because the American market never took to the Stag, only 25,877 cars were produced between 1970 and 1977. Of this number, 6,780 were export models, of which 2,871 went to the United States. As the Stag was originally destined for large sales in the United States, Triumph utilised the &#x27;model year&#x27; method of altering specification details, with each new model year bringing cosmetic changes. For the 1973 model year a number of engineering changes were also made and, although Triumph only ever referred to Stag as one model, since production ceased, enthusiasts have introduced the terms &#x27;Mk 1&#x27; and &#x27;Mk 2&#x27; to refer to cars produced before and after the 1973 model year change. Model year batches or &#x27;sanctions&#x27; are generally identified through differing production numbering sequences, thus, as the first 1973 model year car was chassis numbered 20001, those cars with chassis numbers before 20001 are often referred to as Mk 1 cars and those cars with chassis numbers after 20001 are often referred to as Mk 2 cars.
When introduced in 1973, the most notable differentiating feature between Mark 1 and Mark 2 Stags was the addition of twin coachlines to the body. At this time the sills and tail panel colour was also altered from body colour to low-gloss black but as the tail panel was altered back again for the 1976 model year, it is not an ideal indicator of the difference between Mk 1 / Mk 2 cars. Inside, Mk 2 cars had a slightly different warning light cluster and the instrument dial needles point up rather than down. They also had a single courtesy light in the T-bar rather than lights at the top of each B-post, the steering wheel was smaller, the seats were upholstered in a different way such that it was possible to fit a simple head restraint (which was initially an optional extra but became a standard fitment later on) and the map-reading light was deleted from the door of the glove box and replaced with an internal light. Very early production cars had a three-quarter window in the soft top, which was deleted during the 1972 model year as it tended to become trapped and then split when stowed. A higher-pressure cooling system was introduced during the 1972 model year. For the 1976 model year the cars returned to having body-colour sills and tail panel, but a stainless steel sill cover, as fitted to all US Stags, was fitted over the sills for all 1976 and 1977 cars. Late Stags fitted with the slightly longer BW65 automatic transmission had a correspondingly shorter propshaft to compensate.

Cars for export markets such as the United States comprised unique combinations of features specifically required for compliance with various states&#x27; requirements, or simply for marketing purposes. Cars factory-designated as &quot;Federal specification&quot; included features such as side impact bars in the doors, Federal Department of Transportation compliant lighting, and anti-smog emissions equipment which was not generally found on vehicles for other markets.

Approximately half of the cars built were fitted with a Borg-Warner Type 35 3-speed automatic transmission, which on the last 3,800 vehicles produced gave way to a Type 65. The other choice was a derivative of the earlier Triumph TR2 manual gearbox which had been modified and improved over the years for use in the TR4/A/IRS/TR5/250/6. The first gear ratio was raised and needle roller bearings were used in place of the bronze bushings on the layshaft. Early 4-speed manual transmission models could be ordered with an A-type Laycock overdrive unit, later ones frequently came with a J-type Laycock unit. The overdrive option was often chosen as the engine RPM drops significantly with this option in 3rd and 4th (top) gears, and it was included as a standard fitment for all manual cars from 1973.

Other than the choice of transmissions, there were very few factory-installed options. On early cars, buyers could choose to have the car fitted with just the soft-top, just the hard-top (with the hood stowage compartment empty), or with both. Later cars were supplied as either a &#x27;soft top model&#x27; or with both roofs as a &#x27;hard and soft top model&#x27;. Three wheel styles were offered. The standard fitment for non US-bound cars from 1970 to 1975 was steel wheels with Rostyle &quot;tin-plate&quot; trims. The wheels are secured with the usual four bolts, but the Rostyle trims have five false bolts. Standard fitment for the US for 1971 and 1972 model years was a 72-spoke wire spoke wheel which was specially designed for Stag. These were possibly available as factory fitments for other markets. For the 1973 model year in the US, five-spoke alloy wheels became the standard fitment and these were also available for other markets. For the 1976 model year, cars for all markets had the alloy wheels fitted as standard.

Electric windows, power steering and power-assisted brakes were standard with Delaney Gallay air conditioning being a factory fitted option. A range of aftermarket products including a luggage rack, uprated Koni shock absorbers, floor mats, and Lucas Square Eight fog lamps were available as dealer-installed optional accessories. Part numbers were allocated for leather upholstery but its actual existence is doubtful as it was not included in either the sales brochures or the price lists and no surviving car is known to have original factory leather. Rather unusually for a 4-seat touring car, the parts catalogue included a sump protector plate that was never produced.

== Replacement ==
The Stag was never directly replaced. British Leyland planned an equivalent model to follow the Stag in the form of a derivative of the Triumph TR7 sports car which was codenamed the Lynx. The Lynx used the TR7 platform with an extra 12 inches in the wheelbase to accommodate a rear seat and had fastback coupe bodywork. Power came from a 3.5-litre Rover V8 and the gearbox and rear axle were lifted from the Rover SD1. The Lynx was very close to production being scheduled for launch in 1978. However the sudden closure of the Triumph factory in Speke, Liverpool, where the car was to be built and new policies implemented by BL&#x27;s new chief executive, Michael Edwardes, led to the Lynx&#x27;s cancellation.

== Unmade variants ==
Triumph planned a coupé version of the Stag to complement the open-top tourer, in the same manner as the smaller GT6 coupé was based on the Spitfire. In 1968, Michelotti converted his original 1966 styling concept Stag into his idea of a coupe version and, following further deliberations at Triumph, he was sent a prototype body shell for an &#x27;improved&#x27; version to be manufactured. This second car took very clear styling cues from the GT6, including the shape of the rear windows and roofline and the provision of air vent &#x27;gills&#x27; in the C-pillar. In 1970/71, Triumph built a one-off &#x27;production&#x27; Stag coupé, called the Fastback, to Michelotti&#x27;s design with minor detail differences to match the production Stag more closely. Although the design was considered successful and &quot;more useful than an ordinary Stag&quot;, British Leyland did not continue with the project, reportedly because they feared the Stag fastback would take sales from other actual and planned vehicles in the BL range. The Triumph-built prototype survives.

A number of Stags were built with four-wheel drive using the Ferguson Formula developed by Ferguson Research and pioneered on the Jensen FF. One Stag was reportedly fitted with the FF system by Triumph itself during development, but was either scrapped or converted back to standard specification. Two more 4WD Stags were built in 1972 by FF Developments, a company separate from Ferguson that had licensed the technology for converting existing road cars. The cars (one with manual transmission, one with automatic) were commissioned by GKN for development and testing work. Both had automatic locking differentials actuated by a viscous coupling and the same Dunlop Maxaret mechanical anti-lock braking system as used in the Jensen. The cars differed visually from standard by having a broad bulge in the centre of the bonnet; the engine had to be mounted slightly higher in the engine bay to accommodate the drive to the front wheels. Both these cars survive.

A lightweight Stag was tested which was essentially a standard Stag with most of the sound-deadening material removed. This did not proceed. A 32-valve Stag V8 engine was considered, but no documentary or other trace of any actual engine having been built has come to light. Any such engine could not have used two Dolomite Sprint 16-valve heads because it would have required mirror-image heads on opposite sides. Otherwise, the second camshaft, above the opposite bank of cylinders, would have emerged at the wrong end of the engine.

FF Developments also converted a number of Triumph 2000s (saloons and estates) to 4WD, including at least one &#x27;Triumph 3000 estate&#x27; which received a Stag engine and gearbox as well as the Ferguson 4WD drivetrain.

== Classic status ==
The Triumph Stag has sizeable club and owner support and a number of specialist suppliers. According to the main UK enthusiast club approximately 8,500 Stags are believed to survive in the United Kingdom. According to DVLA data in Q4 2022, 8,409 UK cars survive, either taxed or under SORN.

<text>The Dispute Settlement Body (DSB) of the World Trade Organization (WTO) makes decisions on trade disputes between governments that are adjudicated by the Organization. Its decisions generally match those of the Dispute Panel.

==Institutional structure==

The DSB is, in effect, a session of the General Council of the WTO: that is, all of the representatives of the WTO member governments, usually at ambassadorial level, meeting together. It decides the outcome of a trade dispute on the recommendation of a Dispute Panel and (possibly) on a report from the Appellate Body of WTO, which may have amended the Panel recommendation if a party chose to appeal. Only the DSB can make these decisions: Panels and the Appellate Body are limited to making recommendations. 

The DSB uses a special decision procedure known as &#x27;reverse consensus&#x27; or &#x27;consensus against&#x27; that makes it almost certain that the Panel recommendations in a dispute will be accepted. The process requires that the recommendations of the Panel (as amended by the Appellate Body) should be adopted &quot;unless&quot; there is a consensus of the members against adoption. This has never happened, and because the nation &#x27;winning&#x27; under the Panel&#x27;s ruling would have to join this reverse consensus, it is difficult to conceive of how it ever could.

Once it has decided on the case, i.e., whether the complaint had been shown to be right or wrong, the DSB may direct the &#x27;losing&#x27; Member to take action to bring its laws, regulations or policies into conformity with the WTO Agreements. This is the only direction that emerges from a WTO dispute. There is no concept of &quot;punishment&quot; or even restitution. The DSB will give the losing party a &quot;reasonable period of time&quot; in which to restore the conformity of its laws etc.

If the losing party fails to restore the conformity of its laws within the &quot;reasonable period of time&quot;, the DSB may—on an exceptional basis—authorise a successful complainant to take retaliatory measures to induce action on the part of the losing party. This is very rare. Almost all WTO members &quot;voluntarily&quot; implement DSB decisions in time. Of course, when a losing country brings its laws etc. into conformity it may choose how to do so; indeed, it may not necessarily make the changes that the winning party would prefer.

<doc id="365303" wikidata="Q823456" url="?curid=365303" title="Korabl-Sputnik 2">
<text>Korabl-Sputnik 2 (), also known as Sputnik 5 in the West, was a Soviet artificial satellite, and the third test flight of the Vostok spacecraft. It was the first spaceflight to send animals into orbit and return them safely back to Earth, including two Soviet space dogs, Belka and Strelka. Launched on 19 August 1960, it paved the way for the first human orbital flight, Vostok 1, which was launched less than eight months later.

==Background==

Korabl-Sputnik 2 was the second attempt to launch a Vostok capsule with dogs on board. The first try on 28 July, carrying a pair named Bars (Snow Leopard aka Chaika (Seagull)) and Lisichka (Foxie), had been unsuccessful after the Blok G strap-on suffered a fire and breakdown in one of the combustion chambers, followed by its breaking off of the booster 19 seconds after launch. Around 30 seconds, the launch vehicle disintegrated, the core and strap-ons flying in random directions and crashing into the steppe. Flight controllers sent a command to jettison the payload shroud and separate the descent module, but due to the low altitude, the parachutes only deployed partially, and the dogs were killed on impact with the ground. The Blok G engine failure was traced to high frequency pressure oscillations in the RD-107 engine. This had been a problem on earlier R-7 launches but was corrected in the latest revision of the RD-107. The booster used on this launch was however carrying the older model of the engines. The accident also encouraged the development of an ejector seat for the cosmonaut to escape from the capsule in the event of a launch failure, since the parachutes in the descent module would not be able to open properly until around 40 seconds into launch. This occurred one day before the US program suffered a serious setback with the loss of a Mercury capsule.

==Launch==
The launch of Korabl-Sputnik 2 occurred on 19 August 1960, using a Vostok-L carrier rocket following a two day delay to replace a faulty LOX valve. Official sources reported the launch time to have been 08:44:06 UTC; however, Sergei Voevodin gave it as 08:38:24. A radio station in Bonn, West Germany, was among the first to pick up signals from the spacecraft, which were confirmed on the third orbit by a Swedish radio station.

The spacecraft carried two dogs (Belka and Strelka), forty mice, two rats and a variety of plants, as well as a television camera, which took images of the dogs. After twenty-five hours, the spacecraft returned to Earth at 06:00:00 UTC on 20 August, the day after its launch. Telemetry revealed that one dog had suffered seizures and vomited during the fourth orbit, and it was decided to limit the first crewed flight to three orbits. All of the animals were recovered safely, and a year later Strelka had a litter of puppies, one of which, Pushinka, was sent to First Lady of the US Jacqueline Kennedy as a goodwill present from the Soviet Union. President Kennedy&#x27;s advisers initially opposed taking the dog for fear that the Soviets might have planted microphones in its body to listen in on national defense meetings.

The bodies of Strelka and Belka were both preserved via taxidermy after their deaths and placed on display in the Moscow Museum of Space and Aeronautics.

<doc id="365304" wikidata="Q2304746" url="?curid=365304" title="Triumph TR6">
<text>The Triumph TR6 is a sports car that was built by the Triumph Motor Company of England. While production began several months earlier, the TR6 was officially introduced in January as a 1969 model year vehicle. The last TR6 was produced on the 20th of July 1976. Of the 91,850 TR6s produced, 83,480 were exported, almost all of them to the United States, while only 8,370 were sold in the UK.

==Design and features==
Triumph Motor Cars had a limited budget for the development of the TR6. While the Karmann-designed exterior looked considerably different from the TR4/TR4A/TR250/TR5 cars, the same chassis, engines, running gear, doors, windscreen and much of the body tub were carried over from the TR250/TR5 models. The new removable hardtop for the TR6 was designed in-house by Triumph, and was available as an option.

Construction of the TR6 was traditional body-on-frame with four-wheel independent suspension, front disc brakes and rear drum brakes.

All TR6s were powered by Triumph&#x27;s 2.5-litre straight-6 engine.

The TR6 featured a four-speed manual transmission. An electrically switched overdrive made by Laycock de Normanville was available as an option. On early cars the &quot;A-type&quot; model overdrive was used and was able to be activated on second, third, and fourth gears and provided a 22% gear ratio reduction. Later TR6s had a &quot;J-type&quot; model overdrive able to be activated only on third and fourth gears but with a 28% gear ratio reduction.

Other notable features that were shared with the TR250/TR5 included aluminium semi-trailing arm independent rear suspension, rack and pinion steering, pile carpet on floors and boot, bucket seats, full instrumentation, wheels and depending on the market, Michelin asymmetric XAS tyres that dramatically improved the handling. The optional steel hardtop required two people to deploy. The dashboard was a light shade of flat cut walnut veneer over plywood with a thick coating. Overdrives and hardtops were more commonly selected options, while a rear anti-roll bar and a limited-slip differential were rare.

==Production==
The first production TR6 was built on the 19th of September 1968, as a 1969 model year. All TR6s built until the 28th of November 1968 were carburetted-engine cars with CC commission number prefixes, at which point in time petrol-injected cars with CP commission number prefixes began to be produced on the same production line.

While small changes occurred to the TR6 during its production run, the basic shape and styling cues of the TR6 remained unchanged from beginning to end.

The only factory-recognised change to the TR6 occurred in 1973, when the commission number prefixes changed. Commission numbers were the sequential alpha-numeric numbers used to identify vehicles, a system preceding the use of the modern-day Vehicle Identification Number (VIN). The &quot;Early&quot; CC and CP prefixes were replaced by the &quot;Later&quot; prefixes of CF for carburetted engines and CR for petrol-injected engines. At that time a front spoiler was added, the gauges changed notably in style, as did the horn push and horn surround, and a different optional overdrive was used (Laycock de Normanville A-type for early cars but J-type for later cars). But more importantly, the later CR petrol-injected cars received the milder camshaft that had been used in the carburetted cars, and also a change to the mechanical petrol injection pump. This reduced the power on the later CR petrol-injected cars to 125bhp but made them more drivable in traffic. The power of the later CF carburettor-engined cars was officially reported to have remained mostly the same, 104bhp to106bhp, but the continued addition of emissions equipment on later CF TR6s added complexity and reduced performance.

Apart from the Early vs. Late commission number change, small aesthetic and mechanical changes occurred throughout the production run of the TR6, as is common on most production cars.

In terms of aesthetics, when first produced some styling details were carried over from earlier Triumph TR models but soon dropped, such as short fender beads on part of the rear wings on the 1968-built and possibly very early 1969-built models. The wheel rims changed slightly starting with the 1970 model year, increasing their width from 5&quot; to 5.5&quot;, at which time the Rostyle wheel covers (hubcaps) that were standard on the TR5, TR250, and 1969 TR6s were discontinued and centre caps were used, and they stuck with 165R15 Michelin XAS tyres. The 1969 models also sported a unique steering wheel and a magnetic petrol filler cap.

Different exterior and interior colours were offered in different years, with the original colour of a TR6 indicating when it was likely manufactured. For example, TR6s originally painted Royal Blue were only offered up until 1971, whereas Inca yellow was a colour only available on 1976 TR6s. Carpets on earlier cars were made of Wilton wool versus later cars had tufted nylon carpets.

Evolving US regulations incited many of the changes to the TR6. More changes occurred to the carburettor-engined CC and CF cars but some of those changes carried over to the petrol-injected CP and CR cars. For example, changes that only affected carburetted TR6s were three versions of the seats, different bumpers, three different carburettor versions, and many emissions equipment changes. Changes instigated by US regulations that carried over to the petrol-injected TR6s were things like the relocation of the ignition key under the steering wheel in order to incorporate a steering lock.

The last petrol injected TR6 was produced in July 1975 while the production of carburetted TR6s continued until the very last TR6 was produced on the 14th of July 1976.

==Performance==

The early CP commission numbered petrol-injected TR6s used the same Lucas mechanical fuel-injection as the TR5, which produced (152 hp DIN) and 164 lb-ft of torque.

The early CC commission numbered US and Canada market cars, with carburettors and a lower compression ratio than the fuel-injected counterparts, were the same as used on the TR250 and only produced 104 net bhp and a peak torque of 143 lb-ft at 3500 RPM.

The early petrol-injected version TR6 could accelerate from zero to in 8.2 seconds and had a top speed of according to &quot;Autocar&quot; magazine.

The later CR petrol-injected engines were rated at 125bhp, while the later CF carburetted cars were rated at 106bhp.

==Remaining on the road==
As of 2020, approximately 4000 licensed for use and 1300 temporarily stored SORN TR6s were registered with the DVLA in the UK. The number of licensed and SORN TR6s has increased over the past dozen years, as many Triumphs are bought in the US and shipped back to the UK and elsewhere.

<text>Welsh rarebit or Welsh rabbit ( or ) is a dish of hot cheese sauce, often including ale, mustard, or Worcestershire sauce, served on toasted bread. The origins of the name are unknown, though the earliest recorded use is 1725 as &quot;Welsh rabbit&quot;, a jocular name as the dish contains no rabbit; the earliest documented use of &quot;Welsh rarebit&quot; is in 1781. Variants include &quot;English rabbit, Scotch rabbit, buck rabbit, golden buck&quot;, and &quot;blushing bunny&quot;.

Though there is no strong evidence that the dish originated in Welsh cuisine, it is sometimes identified with the Welsh caws pobi &#x27;baked cheese&#x27;, documented in the 1500s.

==Sauce==
Some recipes simply melt grated cheese on toast, making it identical to cheese on toast. Others make the sauce of cheese, ale, and mustard, and garnished with cayenne pepper or paprika. Other recipes add wine or Worcestershire sauce. The sauce may also blend cheese and mustard into a béchamel sauce.

==Variants==
Hannah Glasse, in her 1747 cookbook &quot;The Art of Cookery&quot;, gives close variants &quot;Scotch rabbit&quot;, &quot;Welsh rabbit&quot; and two versions of &quot;English rabbit&quot;.

To make a &quot;Scotch rabbit&quot;, toast a piece of bread very nicely on both sides, butter it, cut a slice of cheese about as big as the bread, toast it on both sides, and lay it on the bread.

To make a &quot;Welsh rabbit&quot;, toast the bread on both sides, then toast the cheese on one side, lay it on the toast, and with a hot iron brown the other side. You may rub it over with mustard.

To make an &quot;English rabbit&quot;, toast a slice of bread brown on both sides, lay it in a plate before the fire, pour a glass of red wine over it, and let it soak the wine up; then cut some cheese very thin and lay it very thick over the bread, and put it in a tin oven before the fire, and it will be toasted and browned presently. Serve it away hot.

Or do it thus. Toast the bread and soak it in the wine, set it before the fire, cut your cheese in very thin slices, rub butter over the bottom of a plate, lay the cheese on, pour in two or three spoonfuls of white wine, cover it with another plate, set it over a chafing-dish of hot coals for two or three minutes, then stir it till it is done and well mixed. You may stir in a little mustard; when it is enough lay it on the bread, just brown it with a hot shovel.

Served with an egg on top, it makes a &quot;buck rabbit&quot; or a &quot;golden buck&quot;.

Welsh rarebit blended with tomato (or tomato soup) makes a &quot;blushing bunny&quot;.

In France, &quot;&quot; is popular in the Nord-Pas-de-Calais and Côte d&#x27;Opale regions.

==Name==
The first recorded reference to the dish was &quot;Welsh rabbit&quot; in 1725 in an English context, but the origin of the term is unknown. It was probably intended to be jocular.

===Welsh===
&quot;Welsh&quot; was probably used as a pejorative dysphemism, meaning &quot;anything substandard or vulgar&quot;, and suggesting that &quot;only people as poor and stupid as the Welsh would eat cheese and call it rabbit&quot;, or that &quot;the closest thing to rabbit the Welsh could afford was melted cheese on toast&quot;. Or it may simply allude to the &quot;frugal diet of the upland Welsh&quot;. Other examples of such jocular food names are &quot;Welsh caviar&quot; (laverbread); &quot;Essex lion&quot; (calf); &quot;Norfolk capon&quot; (kipper); &quot;Irish apricot&quot; (potato); &quot;Rocky Mountain oysters&quot; (bull testicles); and &quot;Scotch woodcock&quot; (scrambled eggs and anchovies on toast).

The dish may have been attributed to the Welsh because they were fond of roasted cheese: &quot;I am a Welshman, I do love cause boby, good roasted cheese.&quot; (1542) &quot;Cause boby&quot; is Welsh &quot;&quot; &#x27;baked cheese&#x27;, but it is unclear whether this is related to Welsh rabbit.

===Rabbit and rarebit===
The word &quot;rarebit&quot; is a corruption of &quot;rabbit&quot;, &quot;Welsh rabbit&quot; being first recorded in 1725, and &quot;rarebit&quot; in 1781. &quot;Rarebit&quot; is not used on its own, except in alluding to the dish. In 1785, Francis Grose defined a &quot;Welch rabbit&quot; [sic] as &quot;a Welch rare bit&quot;, without saying which came first. Later writers were more explicit: for example, Schele de Vere in 1866 clearly considers &quot;rabbit&quot; to be a corruption of &quot;rarebit&quot;.

Many commentators have mocked the misconstrual of the jocular &quot;rabbit&quot; as the serious &quot;rarebit&quot;:
* Brander Matthews (1892): &quot;few [writers] are as ignorant and dense as the unknown unfortunate who first tortured the obviously jocular Welsh rabbit into a pedantic and impossible Welsh rarebit...&quot;
* Sivert N. Hagen (1904): &quot;&quot;Welsh rabbit&quot;... is of jocular origin... Where, however, the word is used by the sophisticated, it is often &#x27;corrected&#x27; to &quot;Welsh rarebit&quot;, as if &#x27;rare bit
* Ambrose Bierce (1911): &quot; &quot;n.&quot; A Welsh rabbit, in the speech of the humorless, who point out that it is not a rabbit. To whom it may be solemnly explained that the comestible known as toad in the hole is really not a toad, and that &quot;ris de veau à la financière&quot; is not the smile of a calf prepared after the recipe of a she banker.&quot;
* H. W. Fowler (1926): &quot;Welsh Rabbit is amusing and right. Welsh Rarebit is stupid and wrong.&quot;

Welsh rabbit has become a standard savoury listed by culinary authorities including Auguste Escoffier, Louis Saulnier and others; they tend to use &quot;rarebit&quot;, communicating to a non-English audience that it is not a meat dish.

&quot;Eighteenth-century English cookbooks reveal that it was then considered to be a luscious supper or tavern dish, based on the fine cheddar-type cheeses and the wheat bread [...]. Surprisingly, it seems there was not only a Welsh Rabbit, but also an English Rabbit, an Irish and a Scotch Rabbit, but nary a rarebit.&quot;

==Extended use==
Since the 20th century, &quot;rarebit&quot;, &quot;rarebit sauce&quot;, or even &quot;rabbit sauce&quot; has occasionally been a cheese sauce used on hamburgers or other dishes.

==In culture==

The notion that toasted cheese was a favourite dish irresistible to the Welsh has existed since the Middle Ages. In &quot;A C Merie Talys&quot; (100 Merry Tales), a printed book of jokes of AD 1526 (of which William Shakespeare made some use), it is told that God became weary of all the Welshmen in Heaven, &#x27;which with their krakynge and babelynge trobelyd all the others&#x27;, and asked the Porter of Heaven Gate, St Peter, to do something about it. So St Peter went outside the gates and called in a loud voice, &quot;&#x27;Cause bobe&quot;, yt is as moche to say as &quot;rostyd chese&quot;&#x27;, at which all the Welshmen ran out, and when St Peter saw they were all outside, he went in and locked the gates, which is why there are no Welshmen in heaven. The 1526 compiler says he found this story &#x27;Wryten amonge olde gestys&#x27;.

&quot;Betty Crocker&#x27;s Cookbook&quot; claims that Welsh peasants were not allowed to eat rabbits caught in hunts on the estates of the nobility, so they used melted cheese as a substitute. It also claims that Ben Jonson and Charles Dickens ate Welsh rarebit at Ye Olde Cheshire Cheese, a pub in London. It gives no evidence for any of this; indeed, Ben Jonson died almost a century before the term Welsh rabbit is first attested.

Welsh rarebit supposedly causes vivid dreams. The 1902 book &quot;Welsh Rarebit Tales&quot; is a collection of short horror stories supposedly from members of a writing club who ate a dinner which included a large portion of rarebit immediately before sleeping in order to give themselves inspiring dreams. Winsor McCay&#x27;s comic strip series &quot;Dream of the Rarebit Fiend&quot; recounts the fantastic dreams that various characters have because they ate a Welsh rarebit before going to bed. In &quot;Gomer, the Welsh Rarebit Fiend&quot;, Season 3 Episode 24 of &quot;Gomer Pyle, U.S.M.C.&quot;, indulging in Welsh rarebit causes Gomer (and later Sgt. Carter) to sleepwalk and exhibit inverse personality traits.

A humorous appendix of anonymous authorship is sometimes added to the end of Thomas Browne&#x27;s &quot;Pseudodoxia Epidemica&quot;, debating the existence and nature of the &#x27;Welsh Rabbit&#x27; as though it were a real animal.

<text>Vostok (, translated as &quot;East&quot;) was a class of single-pilot crewed spacecraft built by the Soviet Union. The first human spaceflight was accomplished with Vostok 1 on April 12, 1961, by Soviet cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin.

The Vostok programme made six crewed spaceflights from 1961 through 1963. This was followed in 1964 and 1965 by two flights of Vostok spacecraft modified for up to three pilots, identified as Voskhod. By the late 1960s, these were replaced with Soyuz spacecraft, which are still used .

==Development==
The Vostok spacecraft was originally designed for use both as a camera platform (for the Soviet Union&#x27;s first spy satellite program, Zenit) and as a crewed spacecraft. This dual-use design was crucial in gaining Communist Party support for the program. The basic Vostok design has remained in use for some 40 years, gradually adapted for a range of other uncrewed satellites. The descent module design was reused, in heavily modified form, by the Voskhod program.

==Design==

The craft consisted of a spherical descent module (mass 2.46 tonnes, diameter 2.3 meters), which housed the cosmonaut, instruments and escape system, and a biconical instrument module (mass 2.27 tonnes, 2.25 m long, 2.43 m wide), which contained propellant and the engine system. On reentry, the cosmonaut would eject from the craft at about 7,000 m (23,000 ft) and descend via parachute, while the capsule would land separately. The reason for this was that the Vostok descent module made an extremely rough landing that could have left a cosmonaut seriously injured.

The ejector seat also served as an escape mechanism in the event of a launch vehicle failure, which at this early phase of the space program was a common occurrence. If an accident occurred in the first 40 seconds after liftoff, the cosmonaut would eject from the spacecraft and parachute to Earth. From 40 to 150 seconds into launch, ground controllers could issue a manual shutdown command to the booster. When the launch vehicle fell to a low enough altitude, the cosmonaut would eject. Higher altitude failures after shroud jettison would involve detaching the entire spacecraft from the booster.

One problem that was never adequately resolved was the event of a launch vehicle malfunction in the first 20 seconds, when the ejector seat would not have enough time to deploy its parachute. LC-1 at the Baikonour Cosmodrome had netting placed around it to catch the descent module should the cosmonaut eject while still on the pad, but it was of doubtful value since he would likely end up landing too close to the exploding booster. An accident in the initial seconds of launch also likely would have not put the cosmonaut in a position where he could make a survivable ejection and in all probability, this situation would have resulted in his death. A 2001 recollection by V.V. Molodsov stated that Chief Designer Sergei Korolev felt &quot;absolutely terrible&quot; about the inadequate provisions for crew escape on the Vostok during the opening seconds of launch.

There were several models of the Vostok leading up to the crewed version:

===Vostok 1K===
Prototype spacecraft. This was used in the Korabl-Sputnik 2 mission, in which the first animals were recovered from orbit.

===Vostok 2K===
Photo-reconnaissance and signals intelligence spacecraft. Later named Zenit spy satellite.

===Vostok 3KA===
The Vostok 3KA was the spacecraft used for the first human spaceflights. They were launched from Baikonur Cosmodrome using Vostok 8K72K launch vehicles. The first flight of a Vostok 3KA occurred on March 9, 1961. The first flight with a crew—Vostok 1 carrying Yuri Gagarin—took place on April 12, 1961. The last flight—Vostok 6 carrying the first woman in space, Valentina Tereshkova—took place on June 16, 1963.

A total of 8 Vostok 3KA spacecraft were flown, 6 of them with a human crew.

==Reentry==
The Vostok capsule had limited thruster capability. As such, the reentry path and orientation could not be controlled after the capsule had separated from the engine system. This meant that the capsule had to be protected from reentry heat on all sides, thus explaining the spherical design (as opposed to Project Mercury&#x27;s conical design, which allowed for maximum volume while minimizing the heat shield diameter). Some control of the capsule reentry orientation was possible by way of positioning of the heavy equipment to offset the vehicle center of gravity, which also maximized the chance of the cosmonaut surviving g-forces while in a horizontal position. Even then, the cosmonaut experienced 8 to 9g.

If the retrorocket failed, the spacecraft would naturally decay from orbit within ten days, and the cosmonaut was provided with enough food and oxygen to survive until that time.

<text>The American kestrel (Falco sparverius) is the smallest and most common falcon in North America. Though it has been called the American sparrowhawk, this common name is a misnomer; the American kestrel is a true falcon, while the Eurasian sparrowhawk, &quot;Accipiter nisus&quot;, is not in the &quot;Falco&quot; genus and is thus genetically unrelated to the American kestrel. It has a roughly two-to-one range in size over subspecies and sex, varying in size from about the weight of a blue jay to a mourning dove. It also ranges to South America and is a well-established species that has evolved into 17 subspecies adapted to different environments and habitats throughout the Americas. It exhibits sexual dimorphism in size (females being moderately larger) and plumage, although both sexes have a rufous back with noticeable barring. Its plumage is colorful and attractive, and juveniles are similar in plumage to adults.

The American kestrel usually hunts in energy-conserving fashion by perching and scanning the ground for prey to ambush, though it also hunts from the air. It sometimes hovers in the air with rapid wing beats while homing in on prey. Its diet typically consists of grasshoppers and other insects, lizards, mice, and small birds (e.g. sparrows). This broad diet has contributed to its wide success as a species. It nests in cavities in trees, cliffs, buildings, and other structures. The female lays three to seven eggs, which both sexes help to incubate.

Its breeding range extends from central and western Alaska across northern Canada to Nova Scotia, and south throughout North America, into central Mexico and the Caribbean. It is a local breeder in Central America and is widely distributed throughout South America. Most birds breeding in Canada and the northern United States migrate south in the winter. It is an occasional vagrant to Western Europe.

Based on appearance and behavior it was for many years considered a member of the primarily European and African kestrel clade within the genus &quot;Falco&quot;, but DNA analysis shows the American kestrel to actually be genetically more closely related to the larger American falcons such as the peregrine, aplomado, and prairie falcons. Though the species has not been renamed as a result of these genetic analyses, it is not actually a kestrel in the phylogenetic sense. Instead, a process of convergent evolution to fit a similar small prey niche in the ecosystem as the true kestrels have left it with similar physical characteristics and hunting methods.

The American kestrel is a common bird used in falconry, especially by beginners. Though not as strong a flyer as many other, larger falcons, proper training and weight control by the falconer allows many American kestrels to become effective hunters of birds in the size range of sparrows and starlings, with occasional success against birds up to approximately twice their own weight.

==Taxonomy==
The American kestrel was formally described in 1758 by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in the tenth edition of his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; under the current binomial name &quot;Falco sparverius&quot;. Linnaeus based his account on the &quot;little hawk&quot; that had been described and illustrated by the English naturalist Mark Catesby in his book &quot;The Natural History of Carolina, Florida and the Bahama Islands&quot; that was published between 1729 and 1732. Linnaeus specified the type locality as America but this was restricted to South Carolina based on Catesby. The genus name is from Late Latin meaning &quot;falcon&quot;. The specific epithet &quot;sparverius&quot; is Medieval Latin for a &quot;sparrowhawk&quot;.

Until the sixth edition of the AOU Checklist of North American Birds was published by the American Ornithologists&#x27; Union in 1983, the most commonly used name for the American kestrel was the &quot;sparrow hawk&quot;. This was due to a mistaken connection with the Eurasian sparrowhawk in the genus &quot;Accipiter&quot;. The sixth edition of the AOU Checklist corrected this, officially renaming the bird &quot;American kestrel&quot;. Several other colloquial names for the kestrel are also in use, including &quot;grasshopper hawk&quot;, due to its diet, and &quot;killy hawk&quot;, due to its distinct call.

As noted in the introduction, DNA analysis shows the American kestrel to actually be genetically more closely related to the larger American falcons than to the true kestrels. However, based on its physical similarity to the kestrels and the established nature of the name American kestrel, there has been little impetus to change its name. This could change in the future if continued genetic research more precisely determines the evolutionary history of the American kestrel within the genus &quot;Falco&quot;. The entire genus is actually a set of species so closely related that most or all can be hybridized by artificial insemination. Significant natural hybridization of species has occurred in the past during the evolution of this closely related set of species, such that precise evolutionary genetic analysis as to which species are more basal to other species or to the genus as a whole is difficult to render.

Seventeen subspecies of the American kestrel are recognized, generally based upon plumage, size, and vocalizations:

*&quot;F. s. sparverius&quot;, described by Carl Linnaeus in 1758, is the nominate subspecies. It is found in most of the United States, Canada and Mexico.
*&quot;F. s. paulus&quot;, described by Howe and King in 1902, is found in the southeastern United States from Louisiana to Florida.
*&quot;F. s. peninsularis&quot;, described by Edgar Alexander Mearns in 1892, is found in southern Baja California.
*&quot;F. s. tropicalis&quot;, described by Ludlow Griscom in 1930, is found from southern Mexico to northern Honduras.
*&quot;F. s. nicaraguensis&quot;, described by Howell in 1965, is found in Honduras and Nicaragua.
*&quot;F. s. sparveroides&quot;, described by Nicholas Aylward Vigors in 1827, is found on Cuba, Isla de Juventud and the central and southern Bahamas.
*&quot;F. s. dominicensis&quot;, described by Johann Friedrich Gmelin in 1788, is found on Hispaniola (both the Dominican Republic and Haiti) and Jamaica.
*&quot;F. s. caribaearum&quot;, described by Gmelin in 1788, is found on Puerto Rico and throughout the Lesser Antilles to Grenada.
*&quot;F. s. brevipennis&quot;, described by Hans von Berlepsch in 1892, is found in the Netherlands Antilles.
*&quot;F. s. isabellinus&quot;, described by William Swainson in 1837, is found from Venezuela to northern Brazil.
*&quot;F. s. ochraceus&quot;, described by Charles B. Cory in 1915, is found in eastern Colombia and northwestern Venezuela.
*&quot;F. s. caucae&quot;, described by Frank Chapman in 1915, is found in western Colombia.
*&quot;F. s. aequatorialis&quot;, described by Mearns in 1892, is found in northern Ecuador.
*&quot;F. s. peruvianus&quot;, described by Cory in 1915, is found in southwestern Ecuador, Peru and northern Chile.
*&quot;F. s. fernandensis&quot;, described by Chapman in 1915, is found on the Juan Fernández Islands off Chile.
*&quot;F. s. cinnamominus&quot;, described by Swainson in 1837, is found in Peru, Chile and Argentina.
*&quot;F. s. cearae&quot;, described by Cory in 1915, is found from northeastern Brazil south to eastern Bolivia.

==Description==
Under traditional classification, the American kestrel is the smallest raptor in America. The American kestrel is sexually dimorphic, although there is some overlap in plumage coloration between the sexes. The bird ranges from in length with a wingspan of . The female kestrel is larger than the male, though less so than larger falcons, being typically about 10% to 15% larger within a subspecies. The more northern subspecies tend to larger sizes (northern hemisphere), with a large northern female being about twice the size of a small southern male. The male typically weighs , and the female . In standard measurements, the wing bone is long, the tail is and the tarsus is .

Physically, American kestrels are leaner and less muscular than larger falcons. The pectoral flight muscles of the American kestrel make up only about 12% of its body weight, as compared to about 20% for the strongest flying falcons such as the peregrine. The wings are moderately long, fairly narrow, and taper to a point. Their less muscular body type is adapted to energy-conserving ambush hunting, rather than spending large amounts of energy-consuming time on the wing and getting into long tail-chases of bird prey. For their size, they have strong talons and beaks, and can swiftly dispatch prey. Their lean build and energy-conserving strategy allow a lower daily food intake than if they were more strongly muscled, yet with enough strength to commonly take bird prey as large as themselves, and occasionally larger. The success of this body style and hunting strategy is reflected in the high success of the species in densely populating a large range throughout the Americas. The flight of the American kestrel is not so dramatic and swift as more muscular falcons such as merlins and peregrines, but their efficient adaptation to a broader diet of more available smaller prey, and need for less food per day, has resulted in there being many more of them.

In contrast to many other raptor species, the sexes differ more in plumage than in size. Males have blue-grey wings with black spots and white undersides with black barring. The back is rufous, with barring on the lower half. The belly and flanks are white with black spotting. The tail is also rufous, with a white or rufous tip and a black subterminal band. The back and wings of the female American kestrel are rufous with dark brown barring. The undersides of the females are creamy to buff with heavy brown streaking. The tail is noticeably different from the male&#x27;s, being rufous in color with numerous narrow dark black bars. Juveniles exhibit coloration patterns similar to the adults&#x27;. In both sexes, the head is white with a bluish-grey top. There are also two narrow, vertical black facial markings on each side of the head, while other falcons have one. Two black spots (ocelli) can be found on each side of the white or orangish nape. The function of these spots is debated, but the most commonly accepted theory is that they act as &quot;false eyes&quot;, and help to protect the bird from potential attackers.
===Vocalizations===
The American kestrel has three basic vocalizations – the &quot;klee&quot; or &quot;killy&quot;, the &quot;whine&quot;, and the &quot;chitter&quot;. The &quot;klee&quot; is usually delivered as a rapid series – &quot;klee, klee, klee, klee&quot; when the kestrel is upset or excited. This call is used in a wide variety of situations and is heard from both sexes, but the larger females typically have lower-pitched voices than the males. The &quot;whine&quot; call is primarily associated with feeding but is also uttered during copulation. The &quot;chitter&quot; is used in activities that involve interaction between male and female birds, including courtship feeding, copulation, and the feeding of nestlings. Nestlings can produce calls similar to those of adults at 16 days old.

==Ecology and behavior==

American kestrels are found in a wide variety of habitats, including grasslands, meadows, deserts and other open to semi-open regions. They can also be found in both urban and suburban areas. A kestrel&#x27;s habitat must include perches, open space for hunting, and cavities for nesting (whether natural or man-made). The American kestrel is able to live in very diverse conditions, ranging from above the Arctic Circle, to the tropics of Central America, to elevations of over in the Andes Mountains. The bird is distributed from northern Canada and Alaska to the southernmost tip of South America, Tierra del Fuego. It is the only kestrel found in the Americas, though as mentioned above this classification is genetically inaccurate. It has occurred as a vagrant in the UK, Denmark, Malta and the Azores.
American kestrels in Canada and the northern United States typically migrate south in the winter, some of them converging with resident kestrels of smaller size in Mexico, sometimes going as far as Central America and the Caribbean. Birds that breed south of about 35° north latitude are usually year-round residents. Migration also depends on local weather conditions. American Kestrels breeding at lower latitudes – below 48ºN to be precise – arrive earlier after warmer springs, whereas birds from higher latitudes return to their breeding grounds at the same time each year. These patterns suggest that short-distance migrants are better able to cope with climate change. Wintering kestrels&#x27; choice of habitat varies by sex. Females are found in open areas more often than males during the non-breeding season. A common explanation for this behavior is that the larger females who are bigger than the males arrive at the preferred habitat first and exclude males from their territory.

The American kestrel is not long-lived, with a lifespan of &lt;5 years for wild birds. The oldest banded wild bird was 11 years and 7 months, while captive kestrels can live up to 14–17 years. In a study, humans accounted for 43.2% of 1,355 reported deaths, which included direct killing and roadkills, while predation (including by larger birds of prey) accounted for 2.8%. This statistic is likely biased, however, as reported deaths are usually found near or in areas populated by humans.

===Feeding===
American kestrels feed largely on small animals such as grasshoppers, crickets, butterflies, moths, dragonflies, beetles, lizards, mice, voles, shrews, frogs, and small birds. The kestrel has also been reported to have killed scorpions, snakes, bats, and squirrels. The kestrel is able to maintain high population densities, at least in part because of the broad scope of its diet. The American kestrel&#x27;s primary mode of hunting is by perching and waiting for prey to come near. The bird is characteristically seen along roadsides or fields perched on objects such as trees, overhead power lines, or fence posts. It also hunts by kiting, hovering in the air with rapid wing beats and scanning the ground for prey. Other hunting techniques include low flight over fields, or chasing insects and birds in the air.

Prey is most often caught on the ground, though occasionally they take birds in flight. Before striking, the kestrel characteristically bobs its head and tail, then makes a direct flight toward the prey to grab it in its talons. Much like the red-tailed hawk, American kestrels conserve energy in a hunt and pick their attacks with care as to position and odds of success. During the breeding season, the bird will carry large prey back to its mate or young. One study found that an American kestrel pair &quot;foraged in ways that minimized the costs of energy acquisition in its particular situation&quot;. For example, if the success rate for catching prey decreases significantly in a particular area, the bird will move to a different area.

===Reproduction===
 
American kestrels are sexually mature by their first spring. In migratory populations, the males arrive at the breeding ground before females, then the female selects a mate. Pair bonds are strong, often permanent. Pairs usually use previous nesting sites in consecutive years. This gives birds an advantage over younger or invading individuals, as they would already be familiar with the hunting grounds, neighbors, predators, and other features of the site. Males perform elaborate dive displays to advertise their territory and attract a mate. These displays consist of several climbs and dives, with three or four &quot;klee&quot; calls at their peaks. Females are promiscuous for about one to two weeks after their arrival at the nesting site. This is thought to stimulate ovulation. Food transfers from the male to the female occur from about four to five weeks prior to egg laying to one to two weeks after.

American kestrels are cavity nesters, but they are able to adapt to a wide variety of nesting situations. They generally prefer natural cavities (such as in trees) with closed tops and tight-fitting entrances that provide for maximum protection of the eggs and young. Kestrels occasionally nest in holes created by large woodpeckers, or use the abandoned nests of other birds, such as red-tailed hawks, merlins, and crows. They have been recorded nesting on cliff ledges and building tops, as well as in abandoned cavities in cactuses. American kestrels also commonly utilize nesting boxes.

Three to seven eggs (typically four or five) are laid approximately 24–72 hours apart. (Two supernormal clutches of eight eggs and one of nine have been documented. One egg in one of the eight-egg clutches hatched as did one egg in the nine-egg clutch.)
The average egg size is , 10% larger than average for birds of its body size. The eggs are white to cream in color with brown or grey splotching. Incubation usually lasts 30 days and is mainly the responsibility of the female, although the male incubates 15–20% of the time. Eggs that are lost are typically replaced in 11–12 days. Hatching takes place over three to four days. Hatchlings are altricial, and are only able to sit up after five days. They grow rapidly, reaching an adult weight after 16–17 days. After 28–31 days, their wings have developed and they are able to leave the nest.
The young adult kestrels may breed from a year old, and the species has approximately a three to five-year life expectancy in the wild.

In ecological terms, the reproductive pattern of the American kestrel leans towards a small bird &quot;&quot;r&quot; selection&quot; strategy. In &quot;r&quot;/&quot;K&quot; selection theory, selective pressures are hypothesized to drive evolution in one of two generalized directions: &quot;r&quot; or &quot;K&quot; selection. &quot;R&quot;-selected species are those that place an emphasis on a high growth rate, typically exploiting less-crowded ecological niches, and produce many offspring, each of which has a relatively low probability of surviving to adulthood (i.e., high &quot;r&quot;, low &quot;K&quot;). By contrast, &quot;K&quot;-selected species display traits associated with living at densities close to carrying capacity, and typically are strong competitors in such crowded niches that invest more heavily in fewer offspring, each of which has a relatively high probability of surviving to adulthood (i.e., low &quot;r&quot;, high &quot;K&quot;). Between these two extremes, the American kestrel is one of the few raptor species that lean towards being &quot;r&quot;-selected. They are able to breed at one year old, have few non-breeding adults in the population, and have larger broods. Their population growth rate is high relative to larger raptors, which typically lean towards being &quot;K&quot;-selected. This said, older American kestrel pairs generally have larger brood sizes and produce more viable offspring than younger conspecifics.

==Stress physiology==

===Weather===
American kestrels are often useful in scientific studies on animal physiology, and are typically captured using the bal-chatri method or raised in nest boxes for experiments. Kestrel metabolic rate has been found to increase in response to rainfall, and at ambient temperatures below about 25 °C. Kestrel metabolic responses to weather and temperature do not vary, however, with sex. Kestrels will increase their oxygen consumption, and therefore their metabolic rate in cold and wet conditions to counteract heat loss.

===Environmental disturbance===
American kestrels&#x27; response to environmental stress is measured as blood concentration of corticosterone (CORT), a hormone produced by the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis that releases stored energy for essential body functions. Extended periods of elevated blood CORT levels may direct metabolic energy away from growth and reproduction. Thus, high levels of traffic disturbance and human development surrounding American kestrel nests are found to increase stress hormones leading to reproductive failure. Among successful nests, however, nestlings do not typically experience a higher stress response to environmental human disturbance, suggesting that they can tolerate a considerable degree of human activity near the nest.

===Environmental contaminants===
Since American kestrels are carnivores, toxic chemical runoff ingested by their prey can concentrate at high levels in their blood. Wild kestrels are subject to immunomodulation, or an altered immune response, to polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), a group of industrial flame retardants that may leach from factories into the environment. When PBDEs accumulate in body tissues of kestrels, the T-cell mediated immune response decreases in efficiency. As a result, kestrels that ingest PBDEs may not respond sufficiently to viruses or other invading microorganisms. In addition, certain PBDEs may suppress the growth and development of the spleen and bursa in American kestrels.

While PBDEs can affect immune response and suppress growth of certain organs, they can also affect the thyroid system of American Kestrels. Exposure to PBDEs &quot;in vivo&quot; can alter the thyroid system and retinol concentrations in kestrels. This leads to oxidative stress, lipid peroxidation, and changes in glutathione metabolism. These systems are important in early development, growth, regulation of metabolism, thermoregulation, and reproduction. Oxidative stress is also known to contribute to cancers and neurological diseases.

Exposure to polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) might also affect American Kestrel reproduction. It was found that PCBs affect the function of carotenoids in kestrels. This led to changes in coloration, especially during breeding season for adults. PCB-exposed males where duller and contributed less to egg incubation than unexposed males. PCB-exposed females kept their color longer than they should have. Normally, loss in color is associated with carotenoids being directed to ovaries to help in egg development. PCB-exposed females retained their colors longer, suggesting the PCBs made them less prepared for reproduction. The same females also had significant delays in egg laying. Offspring also showed higher incidence of developmental problems and decreased reproductive success.

PCBs have also been found to affect eye color in American Kestrels. Eye color in kestrels is known to vary with age and sex, however, when exposed to PCBs, color patterns were suppressed regardless of age and sex. While it is unknown what role eye color plays in visual acuity, this may be of greater concern to birds like kestrels who rely heavily on vision for hunting.

PDBEs were linked to changes in breeding behavior in kestrels as well. Different levels of PDBE exposure were linked to different changes in behavior as well. Overall, PDBE exposure led to changes in behaviors that strengthen the bond between a breeding pair. Such behaviors include frequent copulation, food transfers, male posturing, nest box inspection, and specific mating calls (7). High exposure levels led to increases in some behaviors and decreases in some, whereas low exposure caused decreases in almost all behaviors observed. PDBE exposure also altered the timing of these behaviors, often delaying them by several days when compared to the control group.

American Kestrels have also been used extensively in toxicology research. Fenthion is a common pesticide that is used to kill insects such as flies and gnats. It was also found that kestrels are highly susceptible to secondary fenthion poisoning. When 14 kestrels were presented with live sparrows who had come into contact with a fenthion solution, all 14 died within 3 days after consuming the sparrows.

Diphacinone is another common pesticide that is often used to kill rodents and is thought to be related to secondary poisoning in birds of prey. When kestrels were orally dosed with diphacinone, blood clotting rates significantly decreases. Kestrels were also found to be 20 to 30 times more sensitive to secondary poisoning from diphacinone than other birds like Northern bobwhite and mallard ducks.

American kestrels can also be significantly influenced by air contaminants. When exposed to common gaseous pollutants such as benzene, toluene, nitrogen dioxide, and sulfur dioxide, significant changes to the thyroid systems were observed. Higher levels of thyroid activity indicate that exposure to these gases leads to a loss of inhibition of thyroid glands in kestrels. However, there were no changes to immune function or food consumption.

==Status and conservation==

The American kestrel is likely the most abundant falcon in North America, although its total population is difficult to quantify, as local populations can change quickly due to resource availability. Count data from the USGS Breeding Bird Survey (BBS) indicate that the North American breeding population is experiencing long-term and gradual but sustained declines, with some regions, such as New England and coastal California, exhibiting more rapid declines. Count data from raptor migration corridors also indicate regional population declines and largely corroborate BBS data. The North American population has been estimated at 1.2 million pairs, with the Central and South American populations being as large. A smaller estimate is 236,000 birds wintering in North America. A population increase occurred in the 18th and 19th centuries, probably due to deforestation for agriculture. The resulting pastures provided an ideal habitat for kestrels.

The southeastern U.S. subspecies (&quot;Falco sparverius paulus&quot;) has declined 82% since 1940 due to a decrease in nest site availability. This decline is a result of longleaf pines being cleared for agricultural fields. Despite this, the American kestrel is classed as least concern on the IUCN Red List.

The Peregrine Fund, a leading non-profit organization advancing research and conservation of birds of prey worldwide, launched the American Kestrel Partnership in 2012. The American Kestrel Partnership developed and maintains a web-based network for citizen and professional scientists to enter, manage, and consolidate data from kestrel nest box monitoring programs in the Western Hemisphere. The database is being used by researchers to model and understand relationships between kestrel nesting parameters (e.g., phenology, occupancy, survival, productivity, and nestling weight and exposure to environmental toxins) and environmental factors, such as land use, landscape composition and configuration, climate conditions (e.g., drought), and point sources of environmental toxins. Each breeding season, the American Kestrel Partnership features a live-streaming video feed from the nest box located at The Peregrine Fund&#x27;s campus in Boise, Idaho.

==Use in falconry==

One important use of American kestrels is in falconry. It is often considered a beginner&#x27;s bird, though the careful weight control needed to maintain the kestrel&#x27;s desire to aggressively hunt takes skill. Falconers experienced in extracting the best performance the species is capable of, report they are highly reliable on the normal game of sparrows and starlings. More aggressive individuals are sometimes capable of capturing prey up to approximately twice their own body weight, allowing the occasional capture of true game birds such as quail and dove. However, most falconers interested in the reliable taking of such game do prefer larger falcons or hawks. The advantage the American kestrel offers the experienced falconer is its suitability to simple and urban falconry not requiring large tracts of land or the use of hunting dogs. This form of falconry is sometimes referred to as &quot;micro-falconry&quot; or &quot;micro-hawking&quot;. The other small raptor species commonly used in micro-falconry are the merlin, the sharp-shinned hawk (the smallest accipiter), and the European kestrel (a true kestrel).

Hawking with the American kestrel requires adapting to the strengths and weaknesses of the bird. It is a tiny falcon, and even for its size, it is less muscular than other small falcons such as the athletic and swift merlin. It is more adapted to ambush hunting and short chases than to the longer aerial chases larger falcons often adopt. Used within its limits, it is effective. Experienced falconer Matthew Mullenix, author of the book &quot;American Kestrels in Modern Falconry&quot;, in an article comparing kestrels to merlins, summed their abilities up as follows:

1. &quot;Kestrels are thin-winged, flat-chested, under-powered and lack acceleration compared to merlins. I say that with much affection for them and with thousands of kestrel kills to prove these are not necessarily damning differences. Comparing a red-tailed hawk to a Harris&#x27; or goshawk will conjure equally negative points of fact, yet we all know how good trained red-tails can be!&quot;

2. &quot;The chief variable to choosing between a kestrel and a merlin may be your hawking land. If you live in open country or have access at least to good pasture for cattle, a merlin can excel there. If you plan to hunt mostly in town or suburb, and especially if you plan to hawk from a car, I&#x27;d recommend the kestrel. The consideration coming in at close second is your intended quarry. To snipe, dove, quail and open-country sparrows, merlins are best suited. For most blackbirds (Icteridea), either falcon can prove effective. Starlings in close are extremely vulnerable to kestrels, but in the open are best prey for merlins. The same holds true for house sparrows, with this exception: sparrows in thick cover are better quarry for kestrels. This is the slip for which I feel the American kestrel is perfect.&quot;

3. &quot;Once committed to an attack, trained kestrels tend to follow through to the end. They will stoop into cover, chase birds on foot, bind to quarry twice their size, and never let go voluntarily. They have small feet, but as written elsewhere, also have the strongest feet for their size. It is a simple fact that American kestrels hold starlings better than merlins, on average, and will gladly tackle larger quarry than will any jack (male merlin).&quot;

American kestrels do not train so easily as some larger falcons (particularly the peregrine falcon) in the art of &quot;waiting on&quot; to perform a diving stoop on flushed prey. However, some individual kestrels do master this skill. Falconers sometimes train them to climb to a stooping position with tidbits on kites or balloons that the kestrels learn to climb after. More common hunting techniques are to &quot;slip&quot; them after spotted game from the fist, or to release them from a vehicle window close to spotted quarry. These techniques are more of a natural fit to the kestrel&#x27;s ambushing methods in the wild.

Falconers using the American kestrel should be alert to protect the falcon from larger predators that may attack the kestrel, particularly if it is distracted on the ground with captured prey. Domestic cats and dogs are the greatest threat to attack the falcon on the ground, but the Cooper&#x27;s hawk is well known to boldly attack kestrels. This mid-sized American accipiter has sufficient size and strength to carry the kestrel away, though falconers have reported often being successful in recovering the kestrel unharmed by acting quickly to intimidate the larger hawk into releasing the kestrel.

American kestrels are bred in captivity for use in falconry and are among the easier falcons to breed. They are also sufficiently common that &quot;passage&quot; birds in their first year are relatively easy to trap. Wild-caught kestrels &quot;tame down&quot; fairly quickly. They will usually be eating from a falconer&#x27;s hand the day after capture, be training within a week, and be ready to hunt in three to five weeks. A very tame American kestrel will allow itself to be picked up around the body with one hand while accepting tidbits from the other hand. Such tameness is very useful when checking or treating the bird for injury or illness.

Migratory raptors native to the United States are protected by the Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918, so American kestrels are illegal to possess without a permit (such as a falconry permit) in the United States, Canada, and Mexico.

<text>Melissa Suzanne George (born 6 August 1976) is an Australian and American actress. She began her career playing Angel Parrish on the Australian soap opera &quot;Home and Away&quot; between 1993–1996. After moving to the United States, George made her feature film debut with a supporting role in the 1998 tech noir &quot;Dark City&quot;. She made the transition to leading roles when she starred in the 2005 remake of &quot;The Amityville Horror&quot;, gaining further recognition with the genre films &quot;Derailed&quot; (2005), &quot;30 Days of Night&quot; (2007), and &quot;Triangle&quot; (2009).

Outside film, George was Golden Globe nominated for playing Laura Hill on the first season of HBO&#x27;s &quot;In Treatment&quot; (2008), and won the Logie Award for Most Outstanding Actress for her portrayal of Rosie in the Australian miniseries &quot;The Slap&quot; (2011); a role she reprised in the 2015 American adaptation. She starred as Margot Fox on the Apple TV+ drama series &quot;The Mosquito Coast&quot; from 2021–2023.

==Early life==
George was born in Perth, Australia, to Pamela - a nurse - and Glenn George, a construction worker. Her paternal grandmother was a Scottish immigrant. William Ward, her maternal grandfather, worked as a prison warden at Rottnest Island, offshore from Perth. The second of four children, she is also a cousin of the opera singer Taryn Fiebig.

George attended Warwick Senior High School and developed an interest in dancing and began studying jazz, tap, ballet, and modern dance at the age of seven. Her enthusiasm for dance eventually evolved into a passion for artistic roller skating. She is an Australian national roller skating champion and won bronze medals in the National Championships in 1989 and 1990. She won a silver medal at the Junior World Championship in 1991.

==Career==
===1992–1998: Early work===
George began modelling in her early teens, and in 1992 was named Western Australia&#x27;s Teenage Model of the Year. At the age of 16, George and a friend, Cara Mitchinson, both acted in a mock episode of the popular Australian soap &quot;Home and Away&quot; with a video camera, playing Bobby and Sophie Simpson; respectively. When the offer of a role on the serial came, George&#x27;s parents convinced her to relocate from her native Perth to Sydney and she began lodging with families. George met with casting director Liz Mullinar and was subsequently cast in the role of Angel Parrish. She made her first on-screen appearance on 30 March 1993, arriving as a teenage runaway. While playing the role, George made property investments and wrote advice columns for two English teen magazines.

Her role earned her five consecutive Logie Award nominations, of which she won two. The character became popular among viewers when she was paired up with Shane Parrish, and to this day they remain one of the soap&#x27;s most loved couples. George departed &quot;Home and Away&quot; on 30 August 1996. She then made a health and fitness video, &quot;Mind, Body and Soul&quot; (1996), created a sleepwear line called &quot;An Angel at My Bedside&quot;, and had a recurring role on the short-lived 1997 Fox Broadcasting Company television fantasy drama series &quot;Roar&quot;, which was filmed in Queensland, opposite Heath Ledger. Her fearlessness in performing the show&#x27;s stunts endeared her to the show&#x27;s creator, Shaun Cassidy, who subsequently cast her as the female lead in the pilot &quot;Hollyweird&quot;. A show about &quot;the adventures of an intrepid pair of friends from Ohio who take their love for the macabre and use it to solve crimes plaguing Los Angeles&quot;, she was to star alongside Bodhi Elfman and Fab Filippo. The pilot was ordered to series, however, the Fox Network&#x27;s tinkering and delays frustrated Cassidy, who pulled out of the project, saying that Fox had forced him to spend &quot;much of the last year trying to fix something I never viewed as broken in the first place.&quot; Ultimately, production never went ahead on the show. George then appeared on the cover and in a nude pictorial for the March 1997 issue of &quot;Australian Playboy&quot;.

In late 1997, George decided to relocate from Australia to the United States, hoping to establish a career in Hollywood. Within a year after relocating, George made her film debut in the critically acclaimed neo-noir science fiction film &quot;Dark City&quot; (1998).

===1999–2008: Film breakthrough===

After a supporting role in Steven Soderbergh&#x27;s 1999 neo-noir crime film &quot;The Limey&quot;, she was cast in a supporting role, Cleo Miller, in the 2001 black comedy &quot;Sugar &amp; Spice&quot; and had a minor role in David Lynch&#x27;s critically acclaimed &quot;Mulholland Drive,&quot; which opened at the 2001 Cannes Film Festival. She starred in several unaired TV pilots, including the lead role in &quot;Lost in Oz&quot;, an original sequel to &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;, inspired by the Oz books of L. Frank Baum. After the pilot was filmed, a significant amount of time passed before the decision was made to film a second episode. However, by then George&#x27;s contract had lapsed and she didn&#x27;t want to move back to Australia to shoot it, as she had just moved to America. Ultimately, a second episode was never shot and the show was never picked up.

She starred in the short-lived ABC drama-comedy &quot;Thieves&quot;, co-starring John Stamos. She starred in the sixth season-premiere of the WB series &quot;Charmed&quot;, had a minor role opposite Renée Zellweger and Ewan McGregor in the 2003 romantic comedy &quot;Down with Love&quot;, and was originally cast as Susan Freeman in the American series &quot;Coupling&quot; based on the British series of the same name. After &quot;an audition from hell&quot;, George was cast and filmed the pilot, but the network (NBC) then fired the writers and replaced George and her fellow castmembers Breckin Meyer and Emily Rutherfurd with Rena Sofer, Colin Ferguson, and Sonya Walger; respectively. The series lasted only four episodes and show creator Steven Moffat blamed NBC&#x27;s meddling as the reason for the show&#x27;s failure, saying that they &quot;fucked it up because they intervened endlessly.&quot; George later commented that she &quot;dodged a bullet&quot; by being replaced before the show aired.

In 2003, she had a role in two episodes of Friends, where she played Molly; the early babysitter for Ross and Rachel&#x27;s baby, Emma. Also in 2003, she landed the role of Lauren Reed on the ABC television series &quot;Alias&quot;. She had auditioned to play lead character Sydney Bristow, but lost out to Jennifer Garner. When that happened, ABC cast her on &quot;Thieves&quot; instead. It was originally planned that George would guest-star for several episodes but she was quickly upgraded to regular. To explain her character&#x27;s accent (George is Australian), the writers wrote that she was born in the United States but grew up in London. George left the show at the end of the third season, saying that &quot;I got offered a couple of films so I decided to kind&#x27;ve [sic] move on.&quot;

Her first starring role in a feature film was Kathy Lutz in the 2005 remake of the 1979 horror film, &quot;The Amityville Horror&quot;. The film was not well received by critics, but was a major success at the worldwide box office, grossing over $108 million. Despite unfavorable reviews, &quot;Film Threat&quot; praised George and her co-star Ryan Reynolds&#x27;s performances, stating that they &quot;make a striking couple. Both young and extremely attractive&quot; and that she &quot;does an impeccable American accent, but otherwise she is unremarkable as Kathy Lutz. Her physical beauty is sometimes distracting, but not enough to keep the audience awed by her acting.&quot; That same year, she played Deanna Schine in the thriller &quot;Derailed&quot;, co-starring Clive Owen and Jennifer Aniston, playing the wife of a man embroiled in an affair.

In March 2006, it was announced that she had been cast in the NBC comedy-drama series &quot;Lipstick Jungle&quot;, based on the novel of the same name by Candace Bushnell. George was to play Nico Reilly, the editor-in-chief of &quot;Bonfire Magazine&quot;. However, the show underwent significant changes; with George and other castmates being replaced and with executive producers DeAnn Heline and Eileen Heisler, and writers Rand Ravich and Jill Gordon and director Nigel Cole all being fired. George had been personally cast by Bushnell, but left in early 2007 when she was offered the HBO series &quot;In Treatment&quot;. Also in 2006, she travelled to Brazil to film the horror-thriller &quot;Turistas&quot; (released in the UK and Ireland as &quot;Paradise Lost&quot;) with Josh Duhamel and Olivia Wilde. Shooting lasted three months on what was the first Hollywood film to be shot entirely on-location in Brazil, and George - who learned to speak Spanish and Portuguese for the role - said that the experience &quot;made me a better actress; more resilient, tougher.&quot;

In 2007, she landed the lead role, Christine, in the biographical drama &quot;Music Within&quot;, opposite Ron Livingston, which focused on a disability-rights activist in Portland, Oregon. The film had a limited release. In an interview, she said that she &quot;knew that Christine&#x27;s a true character, and the woman responsible for Richard Pimentel&#x27;s sort of success in a way. She was the driving force behind him and behind every good man is a good woman, and Christine was that woman.&quot; She starred in the British horror-thriller &quot;WΔZ&quot;, and had a prominent role in the film adaptation of &quot;30 Days of Night&quot;, directed by David Slade and co-starring Josh Hartnett. The film was a modest success with an over $75 million worldwide gross.

===2008–2018: Television and critical acclaim===
George returned to television in 2008 in the HBO half-hour drama &quot;In Treatment&quot;, co-starring Gabriel Byrne and Dianne Wiest, receiving a 2009 Golden Globe Award nomination for Best Supporting Actress – Series, Miniseries, or Television Film, and also received a nomination for &quot;Best Actress&quot; at the 2009 Australian Film Institute Awards.

In September 2008, George joined the cast of &quot;Grey&#x27;s Anatomy&quot; for eleven episodes as Sadie Harris, a bisexual intern, but in January 2009, it was released that she was leaving the show in a mutual agreement with the producers. Also in 2008, she starred in the film &quot;The Betrayed&quot;, which was released at the San Diego Film Festival, and was released direct-to-video in the United States on 30 June 2009.

On 9 November 2009, it was announced that George would guest-star in at least two episodes of Fox&#x27;s &quot;Lie to Me&quot; playing Clara Musso. George also received the lead role in the Australian-British mystery thriller by Chris Smith titled &quot;Triangle&quot;, which opened to positive reviews. George also starred in the British thriller film &quot;A Lonely Place to Die&quot; (2010), directed by Julian Gilbey. She climbed the mountain Ben Nevis for her role in the film.

In November 2010, George was named the new face of L&#x27;Oréal Melbourne Fashion Festival. In 2012, George appeared as Rosie in the Australian TV series &quot;The Slap&quot; and as Sam Hunter in the British TV series &quot;Hunted&quot;, which was filmed over seven months in London, Scotland and Morocco. An American adaptation of the series, in which George again played the character Rosie, premièred on the NBC network in February 2015. A review of the U.S. series in &quot;The New York Times&quot; noted George&#x27;s performance as &quot;particularly beguiling ... As Rosie she is absurd, infuriating, sad, and very funny.&quot;

In 2017, she was cast opposite Sean Penn in the television series &quot;The First&quot; (2018); created by Beau Willimon and filmed in New Orleans, Louisiana.

==Other ventures==
George is credited as the inventor of Style Snaps, a device intended to allow changing pant hem length without sewing. The product is marketed via direct response TV. She has stated that the invention earns her more money than her acting career.

==Public image==
In November 2012, while promoting the television series &quot;Hunted&quot; for &quot;The Sun-Herald&quot; television magazine in Australia, George was quoted as saying: &quot;I don&#x27;t need credibility from my country anymore, I just need them all to be quiet. If they have nothing intelligent to say, please don&#x27;t speak to me anymore. I&#x27;d rather be having a croissant and a little espresso in Paris or walking my French bulldog in New York City.&quot; The response was purportedly spurred by George being tired of repeated questions about her role as Angel Parrish on &quot;Home and Away&quot;the role that had originally garnered her fame in Australiaas opposed to questions about her more recent projects. The publication of the article drew significant criticism, specifically from Australian publications. George would later say she was misquoted in the piece, and that the phrases had been &quot;swapped around and put out of context&quot;: &quot;I never said that at all. We were laughing and I never said anything negative about my country&quot;, she said.

In light of a publicised domestic-violence dispute between George and her boyfriend Jean-David Blanc in 2016, journalist Christine Sams, who had originally published the &quot;Sun-Herald&quot; article, wrote a public apology, in which she noted: &quot;Many of those people attacking George have directly used those inane comments from my original interview (published years ago) to somehow justify her not receiving sympathy or help now. I just wanted to say sorry Melissa; you don&#x27;t deserve it.&quot;

==Personal life==
In 1998, George met actor and film director Claudio Dabed in Bali. They married in 2000, and lived in Buenos Aires. In 2011, they announced their divorce.

In 2011, George met French entrepreneur Jean-David Blanc (son of musician Serge Blanc), the founder of AlloCiné, at a BAFTA awards party. Together they have two sons, Raphaël (b. 2014) and Solal (b. 2015). In September 2016, George separated from Blanc following allegations of domestic abuse that purportedly occurred at their home in Paris. Jean-David Blanc was found innocent and discharged on February 5 2021. Melissa George meanwhile was convicted and charged for using false certificates in courts, domestic violence, and defamation.

Shortly after the incident, George attempted to fly to the United States with the couple&#x27;s two sons, but was prevented from doing so by French authorities after Blanc alleged she was attempting to kidnap their children. George denied this, and said she had intended to return to France with the children. After investigations and trials, George was convicted and charged to a six months prison probation for attempted child abduction. In a 2017 interview, George said she and Blanc had shared custody of the children, but that she felt trapped in France, unable to move freely between countries with her children; the custody arrangement made between the parties required that Blanc provide written consent before the couple&#x27;s children were allowed to leave the country.

Melissa George became a naturalised American citizen in 2008. In 2017, she stated she had resumed working in the United States, on the series &quot;The First&quot;, and flew between both countries to &quot;spend the maximum time&quot; with her children. She gave birth in March 2024 to her third child. The father is unknown.

<doc id="365338" wikidata="Q75438" url="?curid=365338" title="Żywiec Brewery">
<text>Żywiec Brewery () is one of the largest breweries and beer producers in Poland. Founded in 1856 in the town of Żywiec, the brewery manufactures pale lager with a 5.5% alcohol volume. Grupa Żywiec S.A. consists of five main breweries: Żywiec Brewery, Elbrewery, Leżajsk, Warka Brewery and Browar Namysłów. Currently, the Dutch Heineken Group (Heineken International Beheer B.V.), with a 99% shareholding, has control over its major operations. The brewery has the capacity of producing 5 million hls a year, making it the largest brewery in Grupa Żywiec.

==History==
The brewery started operating in 1856 in the town of Żywiec, which was then part of Austrian Poland. It was owned by the Habsburg Imperial Family until its confiscation by the post-WWII Communist government of Poland. At the beginning of the 1990s a court case was started by the descendants of the original owners, who sued the Polish government demanding $77 million compensation for the nationalisation and the use of the Habsburg family name and coat of arms for marketing purposes. The case was settled out of court on undisclosed terms in December 2005.

Żywiec Brewery began distribution to other towns of the Austro-Hungarian Empire in 1913. In the 1990s, the brewery was acquired and modernized by Heineken International.

==Beers==
The brewery produces several brands of beer, usually pale lagers ranging from 5.6% to 9.5% abv, including &quot;Żywiec Jasne Pełne&quot; or &quot;Żywiec Beer&quot;, a 5.5% abv pale lager, which has been brewed in the town of Żywiec, Poland for almost 150 years, and &quot;Żywiec Porter&quot;, a dark porter once brewed in Cieszyn Brewery.

&quot;Żywiec Beer&quot; is sold by the 1pt. can, 1pt. bottles and by the keg. In the United States, it is sold by 12-pack and 6-pack bottles (330 ml / US 11.2 oz.) as well as 500ml cans and bottles. It is still brewed by means of traditional methods using all-natural ingredients and mountain spring water.

==Logo==

The Żywiec logo includes all of the most important historical symbols of the brewery and Poland itself. Żywiec Beer&#x27;s prominent front label displays a man and woman, who dance the Krakowiak, a traditional dance of the area of Kraków in historic Lesser Poland. This dancing couple is dressed in classic Polish folk dancing clothes. Kraków&#x27;s coat of arms is represented with the crown in the middle of the couple. The coat of arms is also represented by the three spruce trees displayed on the bottom of the label and the year 1856 on top underneath the crown. The name Żywiec is placed on the red sash across the middle of the label with the golden trimming. The Żywiec logo is the most famous mark and brand of beer in Poland and the trademark of the entire brewery.

<text>The red-tailed hawk (Buteo jamaicensis) is a bird of prey that breeds throughout most of North America, from the interior of Alaska and northern Canada to as far south as Panama and the West Indies. It is one of the most common members of the genus &quot;Buteo&quot;. The red-tailed hawk is one of three species colloquially known in the United States as the &quot;chickenhawk&quot;, though it rarely preys on standard-sized chickens.

Red-tailed hawks can acclimate to all the biomes within their range, occurring on the edges of non-ideal habitats such as dense forests and sandy deserts. The red-tailed hawk occupies a wide range of habitats and altitudes, including deserts, grasslands, coniferous and deciduous forests, agricultural fields, and urban areas. Its latitudinal limits fall around the tree line in the subarctic and it is absent from the high Arctic. It favors varied habitats with open woodland, woodland edge and open terrain. It is legally protected in Canada, Mexico, and the United States by the Migratory Bird Treaty Act.

The 14 recognized subspecies vary in appearance and range, varying most often in color. In the west of North America, red-tails are often strongly polymorphic, with individuals ranging from almost white to nearly all black. The subspecies Harlan&#x27;s hawk (&quot;B. j. harlani&quot;) is sometimes considered a separate species (&quot;B. harlani&quot;). The red-tailed hawk is one of the largest members of the genus &quot;Buteo&quot;, typically weighing from and measuring in length, with a wingspan from . This species displays sexual dimorphism in size, with females averaging about 25% heavier than males. The diet of red-tailed hawks is highly variable and reflects their status as opportunistic generalists, but in North America, they are most often predators of small mammals such as rodents; prey that is terrestrial and at least partially diurnal is preferred. Like many &quot;Buteo&quot; species, they most often hunt from a perch, but they can vary their hunting techniques where prey and habitat demand it. 

Because they are so common and easily trained as capable hunters, in the United States they are the most commonly captured hawks for falconry. Falconers are permitted to take only passage hawks (which have left the nest, are on their own, but are less than a year old) so as to not affect the breeding population. Passage red-tailed hawks are also preferred by falconers because they have not yet developed the adult behaviors that would make them more difficult to train.

== Taxonomy ==
The red-tailed hawk was formally described in 1788 by German naturalist Johann Friedrich Gmelin under the binomial name &quot;Falco jamaicensis&quot;. Gmelin based his description on the &quot;cream-coloured buzzard&quot; described in 1781 by John Latham in his &quot;A General Synopsis of Birds&quot;. The type locality is Jamaica. The red-tailed hawk is now placed in the genus &quot;Buteo&quot; that was erected by French naturalist Bernard Germain de Lacépède in 1799.

The red-tailed hawk is a member of the subfamily Buteoninae, which includes about 55 currently recognized species. Unlike many lineages of accipitrids, which seemed to have radiated out of Africa or south Asia, the Buteoninae clearly originated in the Americas based on fossil records and current species distributions (more than 75% of the extant hawks from this lineage are found in the Americas). As a subfamily, the Buteoninae seem to be rather old based on genetic materials, with monophyletic genera bearing several million years of individual evolution. 

Diverse in plumage appearance, habitat, prey, and nesting preferences, buteonine hawks are nonetheless typically medium- to large-sized hawks with ample wings (while some fossil forms are very large, larger than any eagle alive today). The red-tailed hawk is a member of the genus &quot;Buteo&quot;, a group of medium-sized raptors with robust bodies and broad wings. Members of this genus are known as &quot;buzzards&quot; in Eurasia, but &quot;hawks&quot; in North America. Under current classification, the genus includes about 29 species, the second-most diverse of all extant accipitrid genera behind only &quot;Accipiter&quot;. The buzzards of Eurasia and Africa are mostly part of the genus &quot;Buteo&quot;, although two other small genera within the subfamily Buteoninae occur in Africa.

At one time, the rufous-tailed hawk (&quot;B. ventralis&quot;), distributed in Patagonia and some other areas of southern South America, was considered part of the red-tailed hawk species. With a massive distributional gap consisting of most of South America, the rufous-tailed hawk is considered a separate species now, but the two hawks still form a &quot;species pair&quot; or superspecies, as they are clearly closely related. The rufous-tailed hawk, while comparatively little studied, is very similar to the red-tailed hawk, being about the same size and possessing the same wing structure, and having more or less parallel nesting and hunting habits. Physically, however, rufous-tailed hawk adults do not attain a bright brick-red tail as do red-tailed hawks, instead retaining a dark brownish-cinnamon tail with many blackish crossbars similar to juvenile red-tailed hawks. 

Another, more well-known, close relative to the red-tailed hawk is the common buzzard (&quot;B. buteo&quot;), which has been considered as its Eurasian &quot;broad ecological counterpart&quot; and may also be within a species complex with red-tailed hawks. The common buzzard, in turn, is also part of a species complex with other Old World buzzards, namely the mountain buzzard (&quot;B. oreophilus&quot;), the forest buzzard (&quot;B. trizonatus&quot; ), and the Madagascar buzzard (&quot;B. brachypterus&quot;). All six species, although varying notably in size and plumage characteristics, in the alleged species complex that contains the red-tailed hawk share with it the feature of the blackish patagium marking, which is missing in most other &quot;Buteo&quot; spp.

===Subspecies===
At least 14 recognized subspecies of &quot;B. jamaicensis&quot; are described, which vary in range and in coloration. Not all authors accept every subspecies, though, particularly some of the insular races of the tropics (which differ only slightly in some cases from the nearest mainland forms) and particularly Krider&#x27;s hawk – by far the most controversial red-tailed hawk race, as few authors agree on its suitability as a full-fledged subspecies.
== Description ==

Red-tailed hawk plumage can be variable, depending on the subspecies and the region. These color variations are morphs, and are not related to molting. The western North American population, &quot;B. j. calurus&quot;, is the most variable subspecies and has three main color morphs: light, dark, and intermediate or rufous. The dark and intermediate morphs constitute 10–20% of the population in the Western United States, but seem to constitute only 1–2% of &quot;B. j. calurus&quot; in western Canada. 

A whitish underbelly with a dark brown band across the belly, formed by horizontal streaks in feather patterning, is present in most color variations. This feature is variable in eastern hawks and generally absent in some light subspecies (i.e. &quot;B. j. fuertesi&quot;). Most adult red-tails have a dark-brown nape and upper head, which gives them a somewhat hooded appearance, while the throat can variably present a lighter brown &quot;necklace&quot;. Especially in younger birds, the underside may be otherwise covered with dark-brown spotting, and some adults may too manifest this stippling. The back is usually a slightly darker brown than elsewhere with paler scapular feathers, ranging from tawny to white, forming a variable imperfect &quot;V&quot; on the back. 

The tail of most adults, which gives this species its name, is rufous brick-red above with a variably sized, black subterminal band and generally appears light buff-orange from below. In comparison, the typical pale immatures (i.e., less than two years old) typically have a slightly paler head and tend to show a darker back than adults with more apparent pale wing-feather edges above (for descriptions of dark morph juveniles from &quot;B. j. calurus&quot;, which is also generally apt for description of rare dark morphs of other races, see under that subspecies description). In immature red-tailed hawks of all morphs, the tail is a light brown above with numerous small dark brown bars of roughly equal width, but these tend to be much broader on dark morph birds. Even in young red-tails, the tail may be a somewhat rufous tinge of brown. 

The bill is relatively short and dark, in the hooked shape characteristic of raptors, and the head can sometimes appear small in size against the thick body frame. The cere, the legs, and the feet of the red-tailed hawk are all yellow, as is the color of bare parts in many accipitrids of different lineages. Immature birds can be readily identified at close range by their yellowish irises. As the bird attains full maturity over the course of 3–4 years, the iris slowly darkens into a reddish-brown, which is the adult eye-color in all races. Seen in flight, adults usually have dark brown along the lower edge of the wings, against a mostly pale wing, which bares light brownish barring. Individually, the underwing coverts can range from all dark to off-whitish (most often more heavily streaked with brown) which contrasts with a distinctive black patagium marking. The wing coloring of adults and immatures is similar but for typical pale morph immatures having somewhat heavier brownish markings.

Though the markings and color vary across the subspecies, the basic appearance of the red-tailed hawk is relatively consistent.

Overall, this species is blocky and broad in shape, often appearing (and being) heavier than other &quot;Buteos&quot; of similar length. They are the heaviest &quot;Buteos&quot; on average in eastern North America, albeit scarcely ahead of the larger winged rough-legged buzzard (&quot;Buteo lagopus&quot;), and second only in size in the west to the ferruginous hawk (&quot;Buteo regalis&quot;). Red-tailed hawks may be anywhere from the fifth to the ninth heaviest &quot;Buteo&quot; in the world depending on what figures are used. However, in the northwestern United States, ferruginous hawk females are 35% heavier than female red-tails from the same area. On average, western red-tailed hawks are relatively longer winged and lankier proportioned but are slightly less stocky, compact and heavy than eastern red-tailed hawks in North America. Eastern hawks may also have mildly larger talons and bills than western ones. Based on comparisons of morphology and function among all accipitrids, these features imply that western red-tails may need to vary their hunting more frequently to on the wing as the habitat diversifies to more open situations and presumably would hunt more variable and faster prey, whereas the birds of the east, which was historically well-wooded, are more dedicated perch hunters and can take somewhat larger prey but are likely more dedicated mammal hunters. 

In terms of size variation, red-tailed hawks run almost contrary to Bergmann&#x27;s rule (i.e. that northern animals should be larger in relation than those closer to the Equator within a species) as one of the northernmost subspecies, &quot;B. j. alascensis&quot;, is the second smallest race based on linear dimensions and that two of the most southerly occurring races in the United States, &quot;B. j. fuertesi&quot; and &quot;B. j. umbrinus&quot;, respectively, are the largest proportioned of all red-tailed hawks. Red-tailed hawks tend have a relatively short but broad tails and thick, chunky wings. Although often described as long-winged, the proportional size of the wings is quite small and red-tails have high wing loading for a buteonine hawk. For comparison, two other widespread &quot;Buteo&quot; hawks in North America were found to weigh: for every square centimeter of wing area in the rough-legged buzzard (&quot;B. lagopus&quot;) and /cm2 in the red-shouldered hawk (&quot;B. lineatus&quot;). In contrast, the red-tailed hawk weighed considerably more for their wing area: per square cm.

As is the case with many raptors, the red-tailed hawk displays sexual dimorphism in size, as females are on average 25% larger than males. As is typical in large raptors, frequently reported mean body mass for red-tailed hawks is somewhat higher than expansive research reveals. Part of this weight variation is seasonal fluctuations; hawks tend to be heavier in winter than during migration or especially during the trying summer breeding season, and also due to clinal variation. Furthermore, immature hawks are usually lighter in mass than their adult counterparts despite having somewhat longer wings and tails. Male red-tailed hawks may weigh from and females may weigh (the lowest figure from a migrating female immature from Goshute Mountains, Nevada, the highest from a wintering female in Wisconsin). Some sources claim the largest females can weigh up to , but whether this is in reference to wild hawks (as opposed to those in captivity or used for falconry) is not clear. 

The largest known survey of body mass in red-tailed hawks is still credited to Craighead and Craighead (1956), who found 100 males to average and 108 females to average . However, these figures were apparently taken from labels on museum specimens, from natural history collections in Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, without note to the region, age, or subspecies of the specimens. However, 16 sources ranging in sample size from the aforementioned 208 specimens to only four hawks in Puerto Rico (with 9 of the 16 studies of migrating red-tails), showed that males weigh a mean of and females weigh a mean of , about 15% lighter than prior species-wide published weights. Within the continental United States, typical weights of males can range from (for migrating males in Chelan County, Washington) to (for male hawks found dead in Massachusetts), and females ranged from (migrants in the Goshutes) to (for females diagnosed as &quot;B. j. borealis&quot; in western Kansas). Size variation in body mass reveals that the red-tailed hawk typically varies only a modest amount and that size differences are geographically inconsistent.

Male red-tailed hawks can measure in total length, females measuring long. Their wingspan typically can range from , although the largest females may possible span up to . In the standard scientific method of measuring wing size, the wing chord is long. The tail measures in length. The exposed culmen was reported to range from and the tarsus averaged across the races. The middle toe (excluding talon) can range from , with the hallux-claw (the talon of the rear toe, which has evolved to be the largest in accipitrids) measuring from in length.

===Identification===

Although they overlap in range with most other American diurnal raptors, identifying most mature red-tailed hawks to species is relatively straightforward, particularly if viewing a typical adult at a reasonable distance. The red-tailed hawk is the only North American hawk with a rufous tail and a blackish patagium marking on the leading edge of its wing (which is obscured only on dark morph adults and Harlan&#x27;s hawks by similarly dark-colored feathers). 

Other larger adult &quot;Buteo&quot; spp. in North America usually have obvious distinct markings that are absent in red-tails, whether the rufous-brown &quot;beard&quot; of Swainson&#x27;s hawks (&quot;B. swainsonii&quot;) or the colorful rufous belly and shoulder markings and striking black-and-white mantle of red-shouldered hawks (also the small &quot;windows&quot; seen at the end of their primaries). In perched individuals, even as silhouettes, the shape of large &quot;Buteo&quot; spp. may be distinctive, such as the wingtips overhanging the tail in several other species, but not in red-tails. North American &quot;Buteo&quot; spp. range from the dainty, compact builds of much smaller ones, such as broad-winged hawk (&quot;B. platypterus&quot;) to the heavyset, neckless look of ferruginous hawks or the rough-legged buzzards, which have a compact, smaller appearance than a red-tail in perched birds due to its small bill, short neck, and much shorter tarsi, while the opposite effect occurs in flying rough-legs with their much bigger wing area. 

In flight, most other large North American &quot;Buteo&quot; spp. are distinctly longer and more slender-winged than red-tailed hawks, with the much paler ferruginous hawk having peculiarly slender wings in relation to its massive, chunky body. Swainson&#x27;s hawks are distinctly darker on the wing and ferruginous hawks are much paler-winged than typical red-tailed hawks. Pale morph adult ferruginous hawk can show mildly tawny-pink (but never truly rufous) upper tail, and like red-tails tend to have dark markings on underwing-coverts and can have a dark belly band, but compared to red-tailed hawks have a distinctly broader head, their remiges are much whiter looking with very small, dark primary tips, they lack the red-tail&#x27;s diagnostic patagial marks and usually also lack the dark subterminal tail-band, and ferruginous hawks have totally feathered tarsi. With its whitish head, the ferruginous hawk is most similar to Krider&#x27;s red-tailed hawks, especially in immature plumage, but the larger hawk has broader head and narrower wing shape, and the ferruginous immatures are paler underneath and on their legs. 

Several species share a belly band with the typical red-tailed hawk, but they vary from subtle (as in the ferruginous hawk) to solid blackish, the latter in most light-morph rough-legged buzzards. More difficult to identify among adult red-tails are their darkest variations, as most species of &quot;Buteo&quot; in North America also have dark morphs. Western dark morph red-tails (i.e. &quot;B. j. calurus&quot;) adults, however, retain the typical distinctive brick-red tail, which other species lack, and may stand out even more against the otherwise all chocolate-brown to black bird. Standard pale juveniles when perched show a whitish patch in the outer half of the upper surface of the wing, which other juvenile &quot;Buteo&quot; spp. lack. 

The most difficult to identify stages and plumage types are dark morph juveniles, Harlan&#x27;s hawk and some Krider&#x27;s hawks (the latter mainly with typical ferruginous hawks as mentioned). Some darker juveniles are similar enough to other &quot;Buteo&quot; juveniles that they &quot;cannot be identified to species with any confidence under various field conditions.&quot; However, field identification techniques have advanced in the last few decades and most experienced hawk-watchers can distinguish even the most vexingly plumaged immature hawks, especially as the wing shapes of each species becomes apparent after seeing many. Harlan&#x27;s hawks are most similar to dark morph rough-legged buzzards and dark morph ferruginous hawks. Wing shape is the most reliable identification tool for distinguishing Harlan&#x27;s hawks from these, but also the pale streaking on the breast of Harlan&#x27;s, which tends to be conspicuous in most individuals, and is lacking in the other hawks. Also, dark morph ferruginous hawks do not have the dark subterminal band of a Harlan&#x27;s hawk, but do bear a black undertail covert lacking in Harlan&#x27;s.

=== Vocalization ===
The cry of the red-tailed hawk is a 2–3 second, hoarse, rasping scream, variously transcribed as &quot;kree-eee-ar&quot;, &quot;tsee-eeee-arrr&quot; or &quot;sheeeeee&quot;, that begins at a high pitch and slurs downward. This cry is often described as sounding similar to a steam whistle. The red-tailed hawk frequently vocalizes while hunting or soaring, but vocalizes loudest and most persistently in defiance or anger, in response to a predator or a rival hawk&#x27;s intrusion into its territory. At close range, it makes a croaking &quot;guh-runk&quot;, possibly as a warning sound. 

Nestlings may give peeping notes with a &quot;soft, sleepy quality&quot; that give way to occasional screams as they develop, but those are more likely to be a soft whistle rather than the harsh screams of the adults. Their latter hunger call, given from 11 days (as recorded in Alaska) to after fledgling (in California), is different, a two-syllabled, wailing &quot;klee-uk&quot; food cry exerted by the young when parents leave the nest or enter their field of vision. A strange mechanical sound &quot;not very unlike the rush of distant water&quot; has been reported as uttered in the midst of a sky-dance. A modified call of &quot;chirp-chwirk&quot; is given during courtship, while a low key, duck-like nasal &quot;gank&quot; may be given by pairs when they are relaxed.

The fierce, screaming cry of the adult red-tailed hawk is frequently used as a generic raptor sound effect in television shows and other media, even if the bird featured is not a red-tailed hawk. It is especially used in depictions of the bald eagle, which contributes to the common misconception that it is a bald eagle cry; actual bald eagle vocalizations are far softer and more chirpy than those of a red-tailed hawk.

== Distribution and habitat ==
The red-tailed hawk is one of the most widely distributed of all raptors in the Americas. It occupies the largest breeding range of any diurnal raptor north of the Mexican border, just ahead of the American kestrel (&quot;Falco sparverius&quot;). While the peregrine falcon (&quot;Falco peregrinus&quot;) has a greater latitudinal distribution as a nester in North America, its range as a breeding species is far more sporadic and sparse than that of red-tailed hawks. The red-tailed hawk breeds from nearly north-central Alaska, the Yukon, and a considerable portion of the Northwest Territories, there reaching as far as a breeder as Inuvik, Mackenzie River Delta and skirting the southern shores of Great Bear Lake and Great Slave Lake. 

Thereafter in northern Canada, breeding red-tails continue to northern Saskatchewan and across to north-central Ontario east to central Quebec and the Maritime Provinces of Canada, and south continuously to Florida. No substantial gaps occur throughout the entire contiguous United States where breeding red-tailed hawks do not occur. Along the Pacific, their range includes all of Baja California, including Islas Marías, and Socorro Island in the Revillagigedo Islands. On the mainland, breeding red-tails are found continuously to Oaxaca, then experience a brief gap at the Isthmus of Tehuantepec thereafter subsequently continuing from Chiapas through central Guatemala on to northern Nicaragua. To the south, the population in highlands from Costa Rica to central Panama is isolated from breeding birds in Nicaragua. Further east, breeding red-tailed hawks occur in the West Indies in north Bahamas (i.e. Grand Bahama, Abaco and Andros) and all larger islands (such as Cuba, Jamaica, Hispaniola, and Puerto Rico) and into the northern Lesser Antilles (Virgin Islands, Saint Barthélemy, Saba, Saint Kitts, and Nevis, being rare as a resident on Saint Eustatius and are probably extinct on Saint Martin). Their typical winter range stretches from southern Canada south throughout the remainder of the breeding range.
Red-tailed hawks have shown the ability to become habituated to almost any habitat present in North and Central America. Their preferred habitat is mixed forest and field, largely woodland edge with tall trees or alternately high bluffs that may be used as nesting and perching sites. They occupy a wide range of habitats and altitudes, including deserts, grasslands, nearly any coastal or wetland habitat, mountains, foothills, coniferous and deciduous woodlands, and tropical rainforests. Agricultural fields and pastures, which are more often than not varied with groves, ridges, or streamside trees in most parts of America, may make nearly ideal habitat for breeding or wintering red-tails. They also adapt well to suburban areas especially ones with tall trees or any kind of parkland. Some red-tails may survive or even flourish in urban areas, usually hunting and roosting in available urban parks, cemeteries, road verges, and so on, and nesting freely either in trees or virtually any tall man-made structures. One famous urban red-tailed hawk, known as &quot;Pale Male&quot;, became the subject of a nonfiction book, &quot;Red-Tails in Love: A Wildlife Drama in Central Park&quot;, and is the first known red-tail in decades to successfully nest and raise young in the crowded New York City borough of Manhattan. As studied in Syracuse, New York, the highway system has been very beneficial to red-tails as it juxtaposed trees and open areas and blocks human encroachment with fences, with the red-tailed hawks easily becoming acclimated to car traffic. The only practice that has a negative effect on the highway-occupying red-tails is the planting of exotic &quot;Phragmites&quot;, which may occasionally obscure otherwise ideal highway habitat.

In the northern Great Plains, the widespread practices of wildfire suppression and planting of exotic trees by humans has allowed groves of aspen and various other trees to invade what was once vast, almost continuous prairie grasslands, causing grassland obligates such as ferruginous hawks to decline and allowing parkland-favoring red-tails to flourish. To the contrary, clear-cutting of mature woodlands in New England, resulting in only fragmented and isolated stands of trees or low second growth remaining, was recorded to also benefit red-tailed hawks, despite being to the determent of breeding red-shouldered hawks. The red-tailed hawk, as a whole, rivals the peregrine falcon and the great horned owl among raptorial birds in the use of diverse habitats in North America. Beyond the high Arctic (as they discontinue as a breeder at the tree line), few other areas exist where red-tailed hawks are absent or rare in North and Central America. Some areas of unbroken forest, especially lowland tropical forests, rarely host red-tailed hawks, although they can occupy forested tropical highlands surprisingly well. In deserts, they can only occur where some variety of arborescent growth or ample rocky bluffs or canyons occur.

== Behavior ==
The red-tailed hawk is highly conspicuous to humans in much of its daily behavior. Most birds in resident populations, which are well more than half of all red-tailed hawks, usually split nonbreeding-season activity between territorial soaring flight and sitting on a perch. Often, perching is for hunting purposes, but many sit on a tree branch for hours, occasionally stretching on a single wing or leg to keep limber, with no signs of hunting intent. Wintering typical pale-morph hawks in Arkansas were found to perch in open areas near the top of tall, isolated trees, whereas dark morphs more frequently perched in dense groups of trees. 

For many, and perhaps most, red-tailed hawks being mobbed by various birds is a daily concern and can effectively disrupt many of their daily behaviors. Mostly larger passerines, of multiple families from tyrant flycatchers to icterids, mob red-tails, despite other raptors, such as &quot;Accipiter&quot; hawks and falcons, being a notably greater danger to them. The most aggressive and dangerous attacker as such is likely to be various crows or other corvids, i.e. American crows (&quot;Corvus brachyrhynchos&quot;), because a mobbing group (or &quot;murder&quot;) of them can number up to as many as 75 crows, which may cause grievous physical harm to a solitary hawk, and if the hawks are nesting, separate the parent hawks and endanger the eggs or nestlings within their nest to predation by crows. Birds that mob red-tailed hawks can tell how distended the hawk&#x27;s crop is (i.e., the upper chest and throat area being puffy versus flat-feathered and sleek), thus mob more often when the hawk is presumably about to hunt.

=== Flight ===

In flight, this hawk soars with wings often in a slight dihedral, flapping as little as possible to conserve energy. Soaring is by far the most efficient method of flight for red-tailed hawks, so is used more often than not. Active flight is slow and deliberate, with deep wing beats. Wing beats are somewhat less rapid in active flight than in most other &quot;Buteo&quot; hawks, even heavier species such as ferruginous hawks tend to flap more swiftly, due to the morphology of the wings. 

In wind, it occasionally hovers on beating wings and remains stationary above the ground, but this flight method is rarely employed by this species. When soaring or flapping its wings, it typically travels from , but when diving may exceed . Although North American red-tailed hawks will occasionally hunt from flight, a great majority of flight by red-tails in this area is for non-hunting purpose. During nest defense, red-tailed hawks may be capable of surprisingly swift, vigorous flight, while repeatedly diving at perceived threats.

===Migration===
Red-tailed hawks are considered partial migrants, as in about the northern third of their distribution, which is most of their range in Canada and Alaska, they almost entirely vacate their breeding grounds. In coastal areas of the north, however, such as in the Pacific Northwest to southern Alaska and in Nova Scotia on the Atlantic, red-tailed hawks do not usually migrate. More or less, any area where snow cover is nearly continuous during the winter shows an extended absence of most red-tailed hawks, so some areas as far south as Montana may show strong seasonal vacancies of red-tails. In southern Michigan, immature red-tailed hawks tended to remain in winter only when voles were abundant. 

During relatively long, harsh winters in Michigan, many more young ones were reported in northeastern Mexico. To the opposite extreme, hawks residing as far north as Fairbanks, Alaska, may persevere through the winter on their home territory, as was recorded with one male over three consecutive years. Birds of any age tend to be territorial during winter but may shift ranges whenever food requirements demand it. Wintering birds tend to perch on inconspicuous tree perches, seeking shelter especially if they have a full crop or are in the midst of poor or overly windy weather. Adult wintering red-tails tend to perch more prominently than immatures do, which select lower or more secluded perches. Immatures are often missed in winter bird counts, unless they are being displaced by dominant adults. Generally, though, immatures can seem to recognize that they are less likely to be attacked by adults during winter and can perch surprisingly close to them. Age is the most significant consideration of wintering hawks&#x27; hierarchy, but size does factor in, as larger immatures (presumably usually females) are less likely to displaced than smaller ones. 

Dark adult red-tailed hawks appear to be harder to locate when perched than other red-tails. In Oklahoma, for example, wintering adult Harlan&#x27;s hawks were rarely engaged in fights or chased by other red-tails. These hawks tended to gather in regional pockets and frequently the same ones occurred year-to-year. In general, migratory behavior is complex and reliant on each individual hawk&#x27;s decision-making (i.e. whether prey populations are sufficient to entice the hawk to endure prolonged snow cover). During fall migration, departure may occur as soon as late September, but peak movements occur in late October and all of November in the United States, with migration ceasing after mid-December. The northernmost migrants may pass over resident red-tailed hawks in the contiguous United States, while the latter are still in the midst of brooding fledglings. Not infrequently, several autumn hawk watches in Ontario, Quebec, and the northern United States record 4,500–8,900 red-tailed hawks migrating through each fall, with records of up to 15,000 in a season at Hawk Ridge hawk watch in Duluth, Minnesota. 

Unlike some other &quot;Buteo&quot; spp., such as Swainson&#x27;s hawks and broad-winged hawks, red-tailed hawks do not usually migrate in groups, instead passing by one-by-one, and only migrate on days when winds are favorable. Most migrants do not move past southern Mexico in late autumn, but a few North American migrants may annually move as far south as breeding red-tailed hawks happen to occur, i.e. in Central America to as far south Panama. However, a few records were reported of wintering migrant red-tails turning up in Colombia, the first records of them anywhere in South America. Spring northward movements may commence as early as late February, with peak numbers usually occurring in late March and early April. Seasonal counts may include up to 19,000 red-tails in spring at Derby Hill hawk watch, in Oswego, New York, sometimes more than 5,000 are recorded in a day there. The most northerly migratory individuals may not reach breeding grounds until June, even adults.

Immature hawks migrate later than adults in spring on average, but not, generally speaking, in autumn. In the northern Great Lakes, immatures return in late May to early June, when adults are already well into their nesting season and must find unoccupied ranges. In Alaska, adults tend to migrate before immatures in early to mid-September, to the contrary of other areas, probably as heavy snowfall begins. Yearlings that were banded in southwestern Idaho stayed for about 2 months after fledging, and then traveled long distances with a strong directional bias, with 9 of 12 recovered southeast of the study area- six of these moved south to coastal lowlands in Mexico] and as far as Guatemala, from their initial banding. In California, 35 hawks were banded as nestlings; 26 were recovered at less than 50 miles away, with multidirectional juvenile dispersals. Nestlings banded in Southern California sometimes actually traveled north as far as to Oregon, ranging to the opposite extreme as far as a banded bird from the Sierra Nevadas that moved south to Sinaloa. Nestlings banded in Green County, Wisconsin, did not travel very far comparatively by October–November, but by December, recoveries were found in states including Illinois, Iowa, Texas, Louisiana, and Florida.

== Diet==
The red-tailed hawk is carnivorous and a highly opportunistic feeder. Nearly any small animal they encounter may be viewed as potential food. Their most common prey are small mammals such as rodents and lagomorphs, but they also consume birds, reptiles, fish, amphibians, and invertebrates. Prey varies considerably with regional and seasonal availability, but usually centers on rodents, accounting for up to 85% of a hawk&#x27;s diet. 

In total, nearly 500 prey species have been recorded in their diet, almost as many as great horned owls have been recorded as taking. When 27 North American studies are reviewed, mammals make up 65.3% of the diet by frequency, 20.9% by birds, 10.8% by reptiles, 2.8% by invertebrates, and 0.2% by amphibians and fish. The geometric mean body mass of prey taken by red-tailed hawks in North America is about based on a pair of compilation studies from across the continent, regionally varying at least from . Staple prey (excluding invertebrates) has been claimed to weigh from , ranging roughly from the size of a small mouse or lizard to the size of a black-tailed jackrabbit (&quot;Lepus californicus&quot;). The daily food requirements range from 7 to 11.2% of their own body weight, so that about three voles or the equivalent weight are required daily for a typical range adult.

The talons and feet of red-tailed hawks are relatively large for a &quot;Buteo&quot; hawk; in an average-sized adult red-tail, the &quot;hallux-claw&quot; or rear talon, the largest claw on all accipitrids, averages about . In fact, the talons of red-tails in some areas averaged of similar size to those of ferruginous hawks which can be considerably heavier and notably larger than those of the only slightly lighter Swainson&#x27;s hawk. This species may exert an average of about of pressure through its feet. Owing to its morphology, red-tailed hawks generally can attack larger prey than other &quot;Buteo&quot; hawks typically can, and are capable of selecting the largest prey of up to their own size available at the time of hunting, though in all likelihood numerically most prey probably weighs on average about 20% of the hawk&#x27;s own weight (as is typical of many birds of prey). 

Red-tailed hawks usually hunt by watching for prey activity from a high perch (also known as still hunting), from which they drop down upon by the prey. Red-tails often select the highest available perches to decrease wing flapping and increase the downward glide during an attack. Perch hunting is the most successful hunting method for red-tailed hawks and can account for up to 83% of their daily activities in the winter. Pairs may join to hunt agile prey that they may have trouble catching by themselves, such as tree squirrels. This may consist of stalking opposites sides of a tree to surround the squirrel and drive the rodent to a hawk. 
The most common flighted hunting method for the red-tail is to cruise around over the ground with flap-and-glide type flight, interspersed occasionally with harrier-like quarters over the ground. This method is less successful than perch hunting but seems relatively useful for capturing small birds and may show the best results over hilly country. Red-tailed hawks readily use trees, bushes, or rocks for concealment before making a surprise attack, even showing a partial ability to dodge among trees in an &quot;Accipiter&quot;-like fashion. Among thick stands of spruce in Alaska, a dodging hunting flight was thought to be unusually important to red-tails living in extensive areas of conifers, with hawks even coming to the ground and walking hurriedly in prey pursuit especially if the prey was large, a similar behavior to goshawks. 

In Texas, swift aerial hunting has been reported in red-tails that habitually hunt bats. The hawks stooped with half-closed wings, quite falcon-like, plowing through the huge stream of bats exiting their cave roosts, then zooming upwards with bats in their talons. The hawks were also seen flying closely to the stream of bats, then veering sharply into it to seize a bat. In the neotropics, red-tails have shown the ability to dodge among forest canopy while hunting. In Kansas, red-tailed hawks were recorded sailing to catch flying insects, a hunting method more typical of a Swainson&#x27;s hawk. 

Alternately, they may drop to the ground to forage for insects like grasshoppers and beetles as well as other invertebrates and probably amphibians and fish (except by water in the latter cases). Hunting afoot seems to be particularly prevalent among immatures. Young red-tailed hawks in northeastern Florida were recorded often extracting earthworms from near the surface of the ground and some had a crop full of earthworms after rains. Ground hunting is also quite common on Socorro Island, where no native land mammals occur, and invertebrates are more significant to their overall diet. A red-tailed hawk was observed to incorporate an unconventional killing method, which was drowning a heron immediately after capture. 

Upon capture, smaller prey is taken to a feeding perch, which is almost always lower than a hunting perch. Among small prey, rodents are often swallowed whole, as are shrews and small snakes, while birds are plucked and beheaded. Even prey as small as chipmunks may take two or three bites to consume. Larger mammals of transportable size are at times beheaded and have part of their fur discarded. Leftovers are either stored in a tree or fall to the ground. Large prey, especially if too heavy to transport on the wing, is often dragged to a secluded spot and dismantled in various ways. If they can successfully carry what remains to a low perch, red-tails tend to feed until full and then discard the rest.

===Mammals===

Rodents are certainly the type of prey taken most often by frequency, but their contribution to prey biomass at nests can be regionally low, and the type, variety, and importance of rodent prey can be highly variable. In total, well over 100 rodent species have turned up the diet of red-tailed hawks. Rodents of extremely varied sizes may be hunted by red-tails, with species ranging in size from the eastern harvest mouse (&quot;Reithrodontomys humulis&quot;) to full grown muskrats (&quot;Ondatra zibethicus&quot;). At times, the red-tailed hawk is thought of as a semi-specialized vole-catcher, but voles are a subsistence food that is more or less taken until larger prey such as rabbits and squirrels can be captured. In an area of Michigan, immature hawks took almost entirely voles but adults were diversified feeders. 

Indeed, the meadow vole (&quot;Microtus pennsylvanicus&quot;) was the highest frequency prey species in 27 dietary studies across North America, accounting for up to 54% of the food at nests by frequency. It is quite rare for any one species to make up more than half of the food in any dietary study for red-tailed hawks. In total about 9 &quot;Microtus&quot; species are known in the overall diet, with 5 other voles and lemmings known to be included in their prey spectrum. Another well-represented species was the prairie vole (&quot;Microtus ochrogaster&quot;), which were the primary food, making up 26.4% of a sample of 1322, in eastern Kansas. While crepuscular in primary feeding activity, voles are known to be active both day and night, and so are reliable food for hawks than most non-squirrel rodents, which generally are nocturnal in activity. Indeed, most other microtine rodents are largely inaccessible to red-tailed hawks due to their strongly nocturnal foraging patterns, even though 24 species outside of voles and lemmings are known to be hunted. Woodrats are taken as important supplemental prey in some regions, being considerably larger than most other crictetid rodents, and some numbers of North American deermouse (&quot;Peromyscus maniculatus&quot;) may turn up. The largest representation of the latter species was contributing 11.9% of the diet in the Great Basin of Utah, making them the second best-represented prey species there. 

Considering this limited association with nocturnal rodents, the high importance of pocket gophers in the diet of red-tailed hawks is puzzling to many biologists, as these tend to be highly nocturnal and elusive by day, rarely leaving the confines of their burrow. At least 8 species of pocket gopher are included in the prey spectrum (not to mention 5 species of pocket mice). The northern pocket gopher (&quot;Thomomys talpoides&quot;) is particularly often reported and, by frequency, even turns up as the third most often recorded prey species in 27 American dietary studies. Presumably, hunting of pocket gophers by red-tails, which has possibly never been witnessed, occurs in dim light at first dawn and last light of dusk when they luck upon a gopher out foraging.

By far, the most important prey among rodents is squirrels, as they are almost fully diurnal. All told, nearly 50 species from the squirrel family have turned up as food. In particular, where they are distributed, ground squirrels are doubly attractive as a primary food source due to their ground-dwelling habits, as red-tails prefer to attack prey that is terrestrial. There are also many disadvantages to ground squirrels as prey: they can escape quickly to the security of their burrows, they tend to be highly social and they are very effective and fast in response to alarm calls, and a good deal of species enter hibernation that in the coldest climates can range up to a 6 to 9-month period (although those in warmer climates with little to no snowy weather often have brief dormancy and no true hibernation). Nonetheless, red-tailed hawks are devoted predators of ground squirrels, especially catching incautious ones as they go out foraging (which are often younger animals). 

A multi-year study conducted on San Joaquin Experimental Range in California, seemingly still the largest food study to date done for red-tailed hawks with 4031 items examined, showed that throughout the seasons the California ground squirrel (&quot;Otospermophilus beecheyi&quot;) was the most significant prey, accounting for 60.8% of the breeding season diet and about 27.2% of the diet for hawks year-around. Because of the extremely high density of red-tailed hawks on this range, some pairs came to specialize in diverse alternate prey, which consisted variously of kangaroo rats, lizards, snakes or chipmunks. One pair apparently lessened competition by focusing on pocket gophers instead despite being near the center of ground squirrel activity. In Snake River NCA, the primary food of red-tailed hawks was the Townsend&#x27;s ground squirrel (&quot;Urocitellus townsendii&quot;), which made up nearly 21% of the food in 382 prey items across several years despite sharp spikes and crashes of the ground squirrel population there. The same species was the main food of red-tailed hawks in southeastern Washington, making up 31.2% of 170 items. An even closer predatory relationship was reported in the Centennial valley of Montana and south-central Montana, where 45.4% of 194 prey items and 40.2% of 261 items, respectively, of the food of red-tails consisted of the Richardson&#x27;s ground squirrel (&quot;Urocitellus richardsonii&quot;). Locally in Rochester, Alberta, Richardson&#x27;s ground squirrel, estimated to average , were secondary in number to unidentified small rodents but red-tails in the region killed an estimated 22–60% of the area&#x27;s ground squirrel, a large dent in the squirrel&#x27;s population. Further east, ground squirrels are not so reliably distributed, but one study in southern Wisconsin, in one of several quite different dietary studies in that state, the thirteen-lined ground squirrel (&quot;Ictidomys tridecemlineatus&quot;) was the main prey species, making up 29.7% of the diet (from a sample of 165).

In Kluane Lake, Yukon, Arctic ground squirrels (&quot;Spermophilus parryii&quot;) were the main overall food for Harlan&#x27;s red-tailed hawks, making up 30.8% of a sample of 1074 prey items. When these ground squirrels enter their long hibernation, the breeding Harlan&#x27;s hawks migrate south for the winter. Nearly as important in Kluane Lake was the American red squirrel (&quot;Tamiasciurus hudsonicus&quot;), which constituted 29.8% of the above sample. Red squirrels are highly agile dwellers on dense spruce stands, which has caused biologists to ponder how the red-tailed hawks are able to routinely catch them. It is possible that the hawks catch them on the ground such as when squirrels are digging their caches, but theoretically, the dark color of the Harlan&#x27;s hawks may allow them to ambush the squirrels within the forests locally more effectively. 

While American red squirrels turn up not infrequently as supplementary prey elsewhere in North America, other tree squirrels seem to be comparatively infrequently caught, at least during the summer breeding season. It is known that pairs of red-tailed hawks will cooperatively hunt tree squirrels at times, probably mostly between late fall and early spring. Fox squirrels (&quot;Sciurus niger&quot;), the largest of North America&#x27;s tree squirrels at , are relatively common supplemental prey but the lighter, presumably more agile eastern gray squirrel (&quot;Sciurus carolinensis&quot;) appears to be seldom caught based on dietary studies. While adult marmot may be difficult for red-tailed hawks to catch, young marmots are readily taken in numbers after weaning, such as a high frequency of yellow-bellied marmot (&quot;Marmota flaviventris&quot;) in Boulder, Colorado. Another grouping of squirrels but at the opposite end of the size spectrum for squirrels, the chipmunks are also mostly supplemental prey but are considered more easily caught than tree squirrels, considering that they are more habitual terrestrial foragers. In central Ohio, eastern chipmunks (&quot;Tamias striatus&quot;), the largest species of chipmunk at an average weight of , were actually the leading prey by number, making up 12.3% of a sample of 179 items.

Outside of rodents, the most important prey for North American red-tailed hawks is rabbits and hares, of which at least 13 species are included in their prey spectrum. By biomass and reproductive success within populations, these are certain to be their most significant food source (at least in North America). Adult &quot;Sylvilagus&quot; rabbits known to be hunted by red-tails can range from the brush rabbit (&quot;Sylvilagus bachmani&quot;) to the Tres Marias rabbit (&quot;Sylvilagus graysoni&quot;) at while all leporids hunted may range the pygmy rabbit (&quot;Brachylagus idahoensis&quot;) to hares and jackrabbits potentially up twice the hawk&#x27;s own weight. While primarily crepuscular in peak activity, rabbits and hares often foraging both during day and night and so face almost constant predatory pressure from a diverse range of predators. Male red-tailed hawks or pairs which are talented rabbit hunters are likely to have higher than average productivity due to the size and nutrition of the meal ensuring healthy, fast-growing offspring. 

Most widely reported are the cottontails, which the three most common North America varieties softly grading into mostly allopatric ranges, being largely segregated by habitat preferences where they overlap in distribution. Namely, in descending order of reportage were: the eastern cottontail (&quot;Sylvilagus floridanus&quot;), the second most widely reported prey species overall in North America and with maximum percentage known in a given study was 26.4% in Oklahoma (out of 958 prey items), the mountain cottontail (&quot;Sylvilagus nuttallii&quot;), maximum representation being 17.6% out of a sample of 478 in Kaibab Plateau, Arizona and the desert cottontail (&quot;Sylvilagus audubonii&quot;), maximum representation being 22.4% out of a sample of 326 in west-central Arizona. Black-tailed jackrabbits (&quot;Lepus californicus&quot;) are even more intensely focused upon as a food source by the hawks found in the west, particularly the Great Basin. With the weight around , adults of this species is the largest prey routinely hunted by red-tailed hawks. When jackrabbit numbers crash, red-tailed hawk productivity tends to decline as well. In northern Utah, black-tailed jackrabbits made up 55.3% of a sample of 329. Elsewhere, they are usually somewhat secondary by number.
In the boreal forests of Canada and Alaska, red-tails are fairly dependent on the snowshoe hare (&quot;Lepus americanus&quot;), falling somewhere behind the great horned owl and ahead of the American goshawk in their regional reliance on this food source. The hunting preferences of red-tails who rely on snowshoe hares are variable. In Rochester, Alberta, 52% of snowshoe hares caught were adults, such prey estimated to average , and adults, in some years, were six times more often taken than juvenile hares, which averaged an estimated . 1.9–7.1% of adults in the regional population of Rochester were taken by red-tails, while only 0.3–0.8 of juvenile hares were taken by them. Despite their reliance on it, only 4% (against 53.4% of the biomass) of the food by frequency here was made up of hares. On the other hand, in Kluane Lake, Yukon, juvenile hares were taken roughly 11 times more often than adults, despite the larger size of adults here, averaging , and that the overall prey base was less diverse at this more northerly clime. In both Rochester and Kluane Lake, the number of snowshoe hares taken was considerably lower than the number of ground squirrels taken. The differences in average characteristics of snowshoe hares that were hunted may be partially due to habitat (extent of bog openings to dense forest) or topography. Another member of the Lagomorpha order has been found in the diet include juvenile white-tailed jackrabbit (&quot;Lepus townsendii&quot;) and the much smaller American pika (&quot;Ochotona princeps&quot;), at .

A diversity of mammals may be consumed opportunistically outside of the main food groups of rodents and leporids, but usually occur in low numbers. At least five species each are taken of shrews and moles, ranging in size from their smallest mammalian prey, the cinereus (&quot;Sorex cinereus&quot;) and least shrews (&quot;Cryptotis parva&quot;), which both weigh about , to Townsend&#x27;s mole (&quot;Scapanus townsendii&quot;), which weighs about . A respectable number of the eastern mole (&quot;Scalopus aquaticus&quot;) were recorded in studies from Oklahoma and Kansas. Four species of bat have been recorded in their foods. The red-tailed hawks local to the large cave colonies of Mexican free-tailed bats (&quot;Tadarida brasiliensis&quot;) in Texas can show surprising agility, some of the same hawks spending their early evening and early morning hours in flight patrolling the cave entrances to stoop suddenly on these flighted mammals. 

Larger miscellaneous mammalian prey are either usually taken as juveniles, like the nine-banded armadillo (&quot;Dasypus novemcinctus&quot;), or largely as carrion, like the Virginia opossum (&quot;Didelphis virginiana&quot;). Small carnivorans may be taken, usually consisting of much smaller mustelids, like the least weasels (&quot;Mustela nivalis&quot;), stoats (&quot;Mustela erminea&quot;), and long-tailed weasels (&quot;Neogale frenata&quot;). Slightly larger carnivores, such as small Indian mongooses (&quot;Herpestes auropunctatus&quot;), ringtails (&quot;Bassariscus astutus&quot;), American minks (&quot;Neovison vison&quot;) are known to be taken. Even adult striped skunk (&quot;Mephitis mephitis&quot;), which can be much larger than a fully grown hawk, was reportedly killed and consumed by red-tailed hawks. Additionally, red-tailed hawks are considered as potential predators of white-nosed coati (&quot;Nasua narica&quot;) and kit fox (&quot;Vulpes macrotis&quot;) Remains of exceptionally large carnivoran species, such as domestic cats (&quot;Felis catus&quot;), red fox (&quot; Vulpes vulpes&quot;) and common raccoon (&quot;Procyon lotor&quot;) are sometimes found amongst their foods, but most are likely taken as juveniles or consumed only as carrion. Many of these medium-sized carnivorans are probably visited as roadkill, especially during the sparser winter months, but carrion has turned up more widely than previously thought. Some nests have been found (to the occasional &quot;shock&quot; of researchers) with body parts from large domestic stock like sheep (&quot;Ovis aries&quot;), pigs (&quot;Sus domesticus&quot;), horses (&quot;Equus caballus &quot;) and cattle (&quot;Bos taurus&quot;) (not to mention wild varieties like deer), which red-tails must visit when freshly dead out on pastures and take a couple of talonfuls of meat. In one instance, a red-tailed hawk was observed to kill a small but seemingly healthy lamb. These are born heavier than most red-tails at but in this case, the hawk was scared away before it could consume its kill by the rifle fire of the shepherd who witnessed the instance.

===Birds===

Like most &quot;Buteo&quot; hawks, red-tailed hawks do not primarily hunt birds in most areas, but can take them fairly often whenever they opportune upon some that are vulnerable. Birds are, by far, the most diverse class in the red-tailed hawk&#x27;s prey spectrum, with well over 200 species known in their foods. In most circumstances where birds become the main food of red-tailed hawks, it is in response to ample local populations of galliforms. As these are meaty, mostly terrestrial birds which usually run rather than fly from danger (although all wild species in North America are capable of flight), galliforms are ideal avian prey for red-tails. Some 23 species of galliforms are known to be taken by red-tailed hawks, about a third of these being species introduced by humans. Native quails of all five North American species may expect occasional losses. All 12 species of grouse native to North America are also occasionally included in their prey spectrum.

In the state of Wisconsin, two large studies, from Waupun and Green County, found the main prey species to be the ring-necked pheasant (&quot;Phasianus colchicus&quot;), making up 22.7% of a sample of 176 and 33.8% of a sample of 139, respectively. With a body mass averaging , adult pheasants are among the largest meals that male red-tails are likely to deliver short of adult rabbits and hares and therefore these nests tend to be relatively productive. Despite being not native to North America, pheasants usually live in a wild state. Chickens (&quot;Gallus gallus domesticus&quot;) are also taken throughout North America, with all Wisconsin studies also found large numbers of them, making up as much as 14.4% of the diet. Many studies reflect that free-ranging chickens are vulnerable to red-tailed hawks although somewhat lesser numbers are taken by them overall in comparison to nocturnal predators (i.e. owls and foxes) and goshawks. In Rochester, Alberta, fairly large numbers of ruffed grouse (&quot;Bonasa umbellus&quot;) were taken but relatively more juveniles were taken of this species than the two other main contributors to biomass here, snowshoe hare and Townsend&#x27;s ground squirrel, as they are fairly independent early on and more readily available. Here the adult grouse was estimated to average against the average juvenile which in mid-summer averaged .

Beyond galliforms, three other quite different families of birds make the most significant contributions to the red-tailed hawk&#x27;s avian diet. None of these three families are known as particularly skilled or swift fliers, but are generally small enough that they would generally easily be more nimble in flight. One of these are the woodpeckers, if only for one species, the northern flicker (&quot;Colaptes auratus&quot;), which was the best represented bird species in the diet in 27 North American studies and was even the fourth most often detected prey species of all. Woodpeckers are often a favorite in the diet of large raptors as their relatively slow, undulating flight makes these relatively easy targets. The flicker in particular is a highly numerous species that has similar habitat preferences to red-tailed hawks, preferring fragmented landscapes with trees and openings or parkland-type wooded mosaics, and often forage on the ground for ants, which may make them even more susceptible. Varied other woodpecker species may turn up in their foods, from the smallest to the largest extant in North America, but are much more infrequently detected in dietary studies. 

Another family relatively often selected prey family are corvids, which despite their relatively large size, formidable mobbing abilities and intelligence are also slower than average fliers for passerines. 14 species of corvid are known to fall prey to red-tailed hawks. In the Kaibab Plateau, the Steller&#x27;s jay (&quot;Cyanocitta stelleri&quot;) were the fourth most identified prey species (10.3% of the diet). American crows are also regularly detected supplemental prey in several areas. Even the huge common raven (&quot;Corvus corax&quot;), at at least as large as red-tailed hawk itself, may fall prey to red-tails, albeit very infrequently and only in a well-staged ambush. One of the most surprising heavy contributors are the icterids, despite their slightly smaller size and tendency to travel in large, wary flocks, 12 species are known to be hunted. One species pair, the meadowlarks, are most often selected as they do not flock in the same ways as many other icterids and often come to the ground, throughout their life history, rarely leaving about shrub-height. The western meadowlark (&quot;Sturnella neglecta&quot;), in particular, was the third most often detected bird prey species in North America. 

Red-winged blackbirds (&quot;Agelaius phoeniceus&quot;) which are probably too small, at an average weight of , and fast for a red-tailed hawk to ever chase on the wing (and do travel in huge flocks, especially in winter) are nonetheless also quite often found in their diet, representing up to 8% of the local diet for red-tails. It is possible that males, which are generally bold and often select lofty perches from which to display, are most regularly ambushed. One bird species that often flocks with red-winged blackbirds in winter is even better represented in the red-tail&#x27;s diet, the non-native European starling (&quot;Sturnus vulgaris&quot;), being the second most numerous avian prey species and seventh overall in North America. Although perhaps most vulnerable when caught unaware while calling atonally on a perch, a few starlings (or various blackbirds) may be caught by red-tails which test the agile, twisting murmurations of birds by flying conspicuously towards the flock, to intentionally disturb them and possibly detect lagging, injured individual birds that can be caught unlike healthy birds. However, this behavior has been implied rather than verified.

Over 50 passerine species from various other families beyond corvids, icterids and starlings are included in the red-tailed hawks&#x27; prey spectrum but are caught so infrequently as to generally not warrant individual mention. Non-passerine prey taken infrequently may include but are not limited to pigeons and doves, cuckoos, nightjars, kingfishers and parrots. However, of some interest, is the extreme size range of birds that may be preyed upon. Red-tailed hawks in Caribbean islands seem to catch small birds more frequently due to the paucity of vertebrate prey diversity here. Birds as small as the elfin woods warbler (&quot;Setophaga angelae&quot;) and the bananaquit (&quot;Coereba flaveola&quot;) may turn up not infrequently as food. How red-tails can catch prey this small and nimble is unclear (perhaps mostly the even smaller nestlings or fledglings are depredated). In California, most avian prey was stated to be between the size of a starling and a quail. Numerous water birds may be preyed upon including at least 22 species of shorebirds, at least 17 species of waterfowl, at least 8 species of heron and egrets and at least 8 species of rails, plus a smaller diversity of grebes, shearwaters and ibises. These may range to as small as the tiny, mysterious and &quot;mouse-like&quot; black rail (&quot;Laterallus jamaicensis&quot;), weighing an average of , and snowy plover (&quot;Charadrius nivosus&quot;), weighing an average of (how they catch adults of this prey is not known), to some gulls, ducks and geese as heavy or heavier than a red-tailed hawk itself.

How large of a duck that red-tailed hawks can capture may be variable. In one instance, a red-tailed hawk failed to kill a healthy drake red-breasted merganser (&quot;Mergus serrator&quot;), with this duck estimated to weigh , later the same red-tail was able to dispatch a malnourished red-necked grebe (&quot;Podiceps grisegena&quot;) (a species usually about as heavy as the merganser), weighing an estimated . However, in interior Alaska, locally red-tailed hawks have become habitual predators of adult ducks, ranging from green-winged teal (&quot;Anas carolinensis&quot;) to mallard (&quot;Anas platyrhynchos&quot;). Even larger, occasionally adult Ross&#x27;s goose (&quot;Chen rossii&quot;), weighing on average , have been killed as well. Also, a non-native Egyptian goose (&quot;Alopochen aegyptiaca&quot;), in which adults average , was killed by a red-tail in Texas. There are several known instances of predation on young greater sage grouse (&quot;Centrocercus urophasianus&quot;), and predation on an adult female, weighing have been reported. Even larger, in at least one case a grown hatch-year bird was caught of the rare, non-native Himalayan snowcock (&quot;Tetraogallus himalayensis&quot;), this species averaging in adults. Red-tailed hawks are a threat to the poults typically of the wild turkey (&quot;Meleagris gallopavo&quot;), which weighed up to at least . In one instance, a red-tailed hawk was observed trying to attack an adult female turkey, but not succeed at dispatching her. Other than turkeys, other larger birds occasionally lose young to red-tails such as trumpeter swans (&quot;Cygnus buccinator&quot;), sandhill cranes (&quot;Grus canadensis&quot;) and great blue herons (&quot;Ardea herodias&quot;).

===Reptiles===
Early reports claimed relatively little predation of reptiles by red-tailed hawks but these were regionally biased towards the east coast and the upper Midwest of the United States. However, locally the predation on reptiles can be regionally quite heavy and they may become the primary prey where large, stable numbers of rodents and leporids are not to be found reliably. Nearly 80 species of reptilian prey have been recorded in the diet at this point. Most predation is on snakes, with more than 40 species known in the prey spectrum. The most often found reptilian species in the diet (and sixth overall in 27 North American dietary studies) was the gopher snake (&quot;Pituophis catenifer&quot;). Red-tails are efficient predators of these large snakes, which average about in adults, although they also take many small and young gopher snakes. Along the Columbia River in Washington, large colubrid snakes were found to be the primary prey, with the eastern racer (&quot;Coluber constrictor&quot;), which averages about in mature adults, the most often recorded at 21.3% of 150 prey items, followed by the gopher snake at 18%. This riverine region lacks ground squirrels and has low numbers of leporids. 43.2% of the overall diet here was made up of reptiles, while mammals, made up 40.6%. In the Snake River NCA, the gopher snake was the second most regularly recorded (16.2% of 382 items) prey species over the course of the years and did not appear to be subject to the extreme population fluctuations of mammalian prey here. 

Good numbers of smaller colubrids can be taken as well, especially garter snakes. Red-tailed hawks may engage in avoidance behavior to some extent with regard to venomous snakes. For example, on the San Joaquin Experimental Range in California, they were recorded taking 225 gopher snakes against 83 western rattlesnakes (&quot;Crotalus oreganus&quot;). Based on surveys, however, the rattlesnakes were five times more abundant on the range than the gopher snakes. Nonetheless, the red-tailed hawk&#x27;s diet has recorded at least 15 venomous snakes. Several predation on adult rattlesnakes have reported, including adult eastern diamondback rattlesnake (&quot;Crotalus adamanteus&quot;) about in snout-to-vent length. These rattlesnakes are the heaviest venomous snakes in America, with a mature size of about , and can be hazardous to hawks, though an immature red-tail was photographed killing a &quot;fairly large&quot; eastern diamondback rattlesnake in one instance. Additionally, eastern indigo snakes (&quot;Drymarchon couperi&quot;), North America&#x27;s longest native snake can be taken as well. While these large snakes are usually dispatched on the ground, red-tailed hawks have been seen flying off with snake prey that may exceed in length in some cases. At the opposite end of the scale in snake prey, the smallest known snake known to be hunted by red-tailed hawks is the redbelly snake (&quot;Storeria occipitomaculata&quot;).

In North America, fewer lizards are typically recorded in the foods of red-tailed hawks than are snakes, probably because snakes are considerably better adapted to cooler, seasonal weather, with an extensive diversity of lizards found only in the southernmost reaches of the contiguous United States. A fair number of lizards were recorded in the diet in southern California. Red-tails can be counted among the primary predatory threats to largish lizards in the United States such as the common chuckawalla (&quot;Sauromalus ater&quot;). However, the red-tailed hawks ranging into the neotropics regularly take numerous species of lizards. This is especially true of hawks living on islands where small mammals do not naturally colonize. Insular red-tails commonly pluck up mostly tiny anoles, that may average only in adult mass, depending on species. Not all tropical lizards taken by red-tailed hawks are so dainty red-tailed hawks can prey on capable of taking lizards as large as Cape spinytail iguanas (&quot;Ctenosaura hemilopha&quot;) and green iguanas (&quot;Iguana iguana&quot;) that usually weighs between and around respectively. Beyond snakes and lizards, there are a few cases of red-tailed hawks preying on baby or juvenile turtles, i.e. the gopher tortoise (&quot;Gopherus polyphemus&quot;), the desert tortoise (&quot;Gopherus agassizii&quot;) and the common snapping turtle (&quot;Chelydra serpentina&quot;).

===Other prey===

Records of predation on amphibians is fairly infrequent. It is thought that such prey may be slightly underrepresented, as they are often consumed whole and may not leave a trace in pellets. Their fine bones may dissolve upon consumption. So far as is known, North American red-tailed hawks have preyed upon 9 species of amphibian, four of which are toads. Known amphibian prey has ranged to as small as the red-backed salamander (&quot;Plethodon cinereus&quot;), the smallest known vertebrate prey for red-tailed hawks, to the American bullfrog (&quot;Lithobates catesbeianus&quot;). Invertebrates, mostly represented by insects like beetles and crickets, are better represented in the stomach contents of red-tailed hawks than their pellets or prey remains. It is possible some invertebrate prey is ingested incidentally, as in other various birds of prey, they can in some cases be actually from the stomachs of birds eaten by the raptor. However, some red-tails, especially immatures early in their hunting efforts, often do spend much of the day on the ground grabbing terrestrial insects and spiders. The red-tailed hawks of Puerto Rico frequently consume Puerto Rican freshwater crabs (&quot;Epilobocera sinuatifrons&quot;), which average . Other island populations, such as those on Socorro island, also feed often on terrestrial crabs, here often blunting their claws while catching them. Fish are the rarest class of prey based on dietary studies. Among the rare instances of them capturing fish have included captures of wild channel catfish (&quot;Ictalurus punctatus&quot;), non-native common carp (&quot;Cyprinus carpio&quot;) and ornamental koi (&quot;Cyprinus rubrofuscus&quot;) as well some hawks that were seen scavenging on dead chum salmon (&quot;Oncorhynchus keta&quot;).

===Interspecies predatory relationships===

As easily one of the most abundant of all American raptorial birds, red-tailed hawks have been recorded as interacting with every other diurnal bird of prey. Due to the extreme dietary plasticity of red-tails, the food habits of other birds of prey regularly overlap considerably with red-tails. Furthermore, due to its ability to nest in varied habitats, home ranges also frequently abut those of other raptor species.

The most obvious similar species in their range are other &quot;Buteo&quot; hawks, especially larger species with a similar ecological niche. Two of the larger, more widespread other &quot;Buteos&quot; are the Swainson&#x27;s hawk and the ferruginous hawks and, as with many other birds of prey, red-tailed hawks occur in almost the entirety of these birds&#x27; breeding ranges. These species have broadly similar breeding season diets, especially the ferruginous and red-tailed hawks. In some areas, such as Snake River NCA the diets of the two species consist of more than 90% of the same species and body mass of prey taken was similar. Therefore, all three large &quot;Buteo&quot; hawks defend their territories from each other with almost the same degree of dedication that they defend from others of their own species. In some cases, territorial clashes of Swainson&#x27;s hawks and red-tailed hawks can last up to 12 hours, however, the birds involved are usually careful to avoid physical contact. 

Due to the similarities of the foods and their aggressive dispositions towards one another, these &quot;Buteos&quot; need some degree of partitioning to persist alongside one another and this usually is given by habitat preferences. The ferruginous hawk prefers open, practically treeless prairie while of these, the red-tailed hawks prefers the most wooded areas with large trees, while the Swainson&#x27;s hawk prefer roughly intermediate areas. Where the habitat is more open, such as in Cassia County, Idaho, the Swainson&#x27;s and ferruginous hawks have the advantage in numbers and red-tails are scarce. However, habitat alterations by humans, such as fire suppression and recovering pasture, usually favor the red-tailed hawk and are to the detriment of the other two species. These practices have caused range expansions of many other species of birds but declines in many others. Of these three &quot;Buteo&quot; species, the Swainson&#x27;s hawk is most dissimilar, being a long-distance migrant which travels to South America each winter and, for much of the year, prefers to prey on insects (except for during breeding, when more nutritious food such as ground squirrels are mainly fed to the young). It also breeds notably later than the other two species. 

Surprisingly, although it&#x27;s slightly smaller in body mass and has notably smaller (and presumably weaker) feet than ferruginous and red-tailed hawks, the Swainson&#x27;s is actually usually (but not invariably) dominant in territorial conflicts over the other two. Part of this advantage is that the Swainson&#x27;s hawk is apparently a superior flier both in long and short-distance flights, with its more pointed wing shape and lower wing loading allowing it more agile, sustained and speedier flight that the bulkier hawks cannot match. 

Therefore, in north-central Oregon, Swainson&#x27;s hawks were shown to be more productive, in prairie located trees, and partially displaced prior-breeding red-tails several times, although overall breeding success rates were not perceptibly decreased in the latter hawk. In the Chihuahuan Desert of Mexico, Swainson&#x27;s hawks usually nested in lowlands and red-tails nested in highlands but interspecies conflicts nevertheless were apparently quite frequent. Usually, the habitat preferences of red-tailed hawks and ferruginous hawks are discrepant enough to keep serious territorial conflicts to a minimum. However, red-tailed hawks and ferruginous hawks occasionally engaged in kleptoparasitism towards one another, usually during winter. Red-tails may be somewhat dominant based on prior reports in food conflicts but the ferruginous hawk may also win these. Where they overlap, the hawk species may adjust their daily routine to minimize contact, which tends to be costly of time and energy and may cause the hawks to abandon their nests for long stretches of time, which in turn leaves their young vulnerable to predation. When habitats change rapidly, often due to human interference, and they nest more closely than natural partitioning would allow, in all three nesting success can decline significantly.

Beyond the Swainson&#x27;s and ferruginous hawks, six other &quot;Buteos&quot; co-occur with red-tailed hawks in different parts of North America. Many of these are substantially smaller than red-tails and most serious territorial conflicts with them are naturally mitigated by nesting in deeper wooded areas. One other larger species, the rough-legged buzzard, mostly nests far north of the breeding range of red-tailed hawks. However, in Alaska they sometimes nest in the same areas. The rough-legged buzzards are both cliff and tree nesters and areas used by the two species are not necessarily mutually exclusive but each seems to avoid the other, in part by differing breeding schedules. Wintering rough-legged buzzards may regularly come into conflict over food with red-tailed hawks and seem to be subordinate to the red-tails, with several records of them being chased off both kills and carrion by the red-tailed hawks. During winter their hunting habits may keep them somewhat separate, the rough-legged being a much more aerial hunter, but rough-legged buzzards usually withdrew if a red-tailed hawk flew towards them. There is at least one case, however, of a rough-legged buzzard being the victor of a conflict over a kill with a red-tailed hawk. 

Red-tailed hawks are conspicuously more aggressive and tend to be dominant over slenderer, medium-sized &quot;Buteos&quot; such as red-shouldered hawks and zone-tailed hawks (&quot;Buteo albonotatus&quot;). In Massachusetts, red-shoulder hawks used mixed forests and hardwoods as nesting habitat while red-tails most often used in pitch pine and stunted oaks on Cape Cod. Nesting range overlap here most often occurred on white pine forests. As habitat has opened over time, red-tailed hawks frequently took over former red-shouldered hawk territories, even using their nests in two cases. In north-central Florida, it was found during winter that red-shouldered and red-tailed hawk habitat usage blurred and, because the local habitat favors red-shouldered hawks, they easily outnumbered the number of red-tailed hawks in the area. 

Therefore, again with sufficient habitat partitioning, the two species can live near one another without negatively effecting one another. In the American southwest and Texas, two relatively large buteonine hawks also live alongside red-tailed hawks, the Harris&#x27;s hawk (&quot;Parabuteo unicinctus&quot;) and the white-tailed hawk (&quot;Geranoaetus albicaudatus&quot;). Usually, habitat preferences kept conflicts to a minimum, with the red-tailed hawk favoring taller, more isolated saguaro cactus for nesting, whereas the other species outnumbered red-tails in areas that were denser and more shrubby. The Harris&#x27;s hawk was determined to be a superior aerial hunter over red-tailed hawks, and could take down flying birds more routinely.

Hawks and kites from outside the buteonine lineage are usually substantially smaller or at least different enough in diet and habitat to largely avoid heavy conflict with red-tailed hawks. On occasion, northern harriers (&quot;Circus hudsonius&quot;) which have much lower wing loading, will mob red-tailed hawks out of their home ranges but in winter the red-tails seem to be dominant over them in conflicts over food. Among &quot;Accipiter&quot; hawks, the most similar to the red-tailed hawk in diet and size is the American goshawk. In some areas, the prey species of these can be very similar and North American populations of goshawks take many more squirrels and leporids than their Eurasian counterparts do. 

It was found that the feet and striking force of hunting goshawks was more powerful than that of the red-tailed hawk, despite the red-tails being up to 10% heavier in some parts of North America. Therefore, wild goshawks can dispatch larger prey both on average and at maximum prey size, with some victims of female goshawks such as adult hares and galliforms such as turkey and capercaillie weighing up to or exceeding roughly . In a comparative study in the Kaibab Plateau of Arizona, however, it was found that red-tailed hawks had several population advantages. Red-tails were more flexible in diet, although there was a very broad overlap in prey species selected, and nesting habitat than the goshawks were. As red-tailed hawks in conflict with other more closely related &quot;Buteo&quot; hawks rarely (if ever) result in mortality on either side, goshawks and red-tailed hawks do seem to readily kill one another. Adults of both species have been shown to be able to kill adults of the other.

The great horned owl occupies a similar ecological niche nocturnally to the red-tailed hawk. There have been many studies that have contrasted the ecology of these two powerful raptors. The great horned owl averages heavier and larger footed, with northern populations averaging up to 26% heavier in the owl than the hawk. However, due in part to the red-tail&#x27;s more extensive access to sizable prey such as ground squirrels, several contrasting dietary studies found that the estimated mean prey size of the red-tailed hawk, at , was considerably higher than that of the great horned owl, at . Also, the diet of red-tailed hawk seems to be more flexible by prey type, as only just over 65% of their diet is made of mammals, whereas great horned owls were more restricted feeders on mammals, selecting them 87.6% of the time. 

However, the overall prey spectrum of great horned owls includes more species of mammals and birds (but far less reptiles) and the great horned owl can attack prey of a wider size range, including much larger prey items than any taken by red-tailed hawks. Mean prey weights in different areas for great horned owls can vary from , so is far more variable than that of red-tailed hawks (at ) and can be much larger (by about 45%) than the largest estimated size known for the red-tailed hawk&#x27;s mean prey weight but conversely the owl can also subsist on prey communities averaging much smaller in body size than can support the hawk. Some prey killed by great horned owls was estimated to weigh up to . 

Great horned owls and red-tailed hawks compete not only for food but more seriously over nesting areas and home ranges. Great horned owls are incapable of constructing nests and readily expropriate existing red-tail nests. The habitat preferences of the two species are quite similar and the owl frequently uses old red-tail nests, but they do seem to prefer more enclosed nest locations where available over the generally open situation around red-tailed hawk nests. Sometimes in warmer areas, the owls may nest sufficiently early to have fledged young by the time red-tails start to lay. However, when there is a temporal overlap in reproductive cycles, the owl sometimes takes over an occupied red-tail nest, causing desertion. Red-tailed hawks have an advantage in staple prey flexibility as aforementioned, while great horned owl populations can be stressed when preferred prey is scarce, especially when they rely on leporids such as hares and jackrabbits. 

For example, in Alberta, when snowshoe hares were at their population peak, red-tailed hawks did not increase in population despite taking many, with only a slight increase in mean clutch size, whereas the owls fluctuated in much more dramatic ways in accordance with snowshoe hare numbers. The red-tails migratory behavior was considered as the likely cause of this lack of effect, whereas great horned owls remained through the winter and was subject to winter-stress and greater risk of starvation. As a nester, great horned owl has the advantage in terms of flexibility, being somewhat spread more evenly across different habitats whereas in undisturbed areas, red-tailed hawks seem to nest more so in clusters where habitat is favorable. Predatory relationships between red-tailed hawks and great horned owls are quite one-sided, with the great horned owl likely the overall major predator of red-tails. On the other hand, red-tailed hawks are rarely (if ever) a threat to the great horned owl. Occasionally a red-tailed hawk can strike down an owl during the day but only in a few singular cases has this killed an owl. 

Most predation by the owls on the hawks is directed at nestlings at the point where the red-tails&#x27; nestlings are old enough that the parents no longer roost around the nest at night. Up to at least 36% of red-tailed hawk nestlings in a population may be lost to great horned owls. Adult and immature red-tailed hawks are also occasionally preyed upon at night by great horned owls in any season. In one case, a great horned owl seemed to have ambushed, killed and fed upon a full-grown migrating red-tail even in broad daylight. Occasionally, both red-tails and great horned owls will engage each other during the day and, even though the red-tailed hawk has the advantage at this time of day, either may succeed in driving away the other. Despite their contentious relations, the two species may nest quite close to one another. 

For example, in Saskatchewan, the smallest distance between nests was only . In these close proximity areas all owl nests succeeded while only two red-tail nests were successful. In Waterloo, Wisconsin, the two species were largely segregated by nesting times, as returning red-tailed hawks in April–June were usually able to successfully avoid nesting in groves holding great horned owls, which can begin nesting activities as early as February. In Delaware County, Ohio, and in central New York state, divergence of hunting and nesting times usually allowed both species to succeed in nesting. In all three areas, any time the red-tails tried to nest closer to great horned owls, their breeding success rates lowered considerably. It is presumable that sparser habitat and prey resources increased the closeness of nesting habits of the two species, to the detriment of the red-tails. Due to nesting proximity to great horned owls, mature red-tails may have losses ranging from 10 to 26%.

Red-tailed hawks may face competition from a very broad range of predatory animals, including birds outside of typically active predatory families, carnivoran mammals and some reptiles such as snakes. Mostly these diverse kinds of predators are segregated by their hunting methods, primary times of activity and habitat preferences. In California, both the red-tails and western diamondback rattlesnakes (&quot;Crotalus atrox&quot;) live mainly on California ground squirrel, but the rattlesnake generally attacks the squirrels in and around their burrows, whereas the hawks must wait until they leave the burrows to capture them. Hawks have been observed following American badgers (&quot;Taxidea taxus&quot;) to capture prey they flush and the two are considered potential competitors, especially in sparse sub-desert areas where the rodent foods they both favor are scarce. Competition over carcasses may occur with American crows, and several crows, usually about six or more, working together can displace a hawk. Another avian scavenger, the turkey vulture (&quot;Cathartes aura&quot;), is dominated by red-tails and may be followed by red-tails to supplant a carcass found by the vulture with their keen sense of smell. In some cases, red-tailed hawks may be considered lessened as food competitors by their lack of specialization. For instance, no serious competition probably occurs between them and Canada lynx (&quot;Lynx canadensis&quot;) despite both living on snowshoe hares.

Distinguishing territorial exclusionary behavior and anti-predator behavior is difficult in raptorial birds. However, as opposed to other medium to largish hawks which chase off red-tails most likely as competition, in much smaller raptors such as kestrels and smaller &quot;Accipiter&quot; hawks, their aggressive reaction to red-tailed hawks is almost certainly an anti-predator behavior. Although less prolific than goshawks, some eagles and, especially, great horned owls, red-tailed hawks can and do prey upon smaller birds of prey. The following species of accipitrid have been known to fall prey to red-tailed hawks, potentially including nestlings, fledglings, immatures and/or adults: swallow-tailed kite (&quot;Elanoides forficatus&quot;), Mississippi kite (&quot;Ictinia mississippiensis&quot;), white-tailed kite (&quot;Elanus leucurus&quot;), northern harrier (&quot;Circus hudsonius&quot;), sharp-shinned hawk (&quot;Accipiter striatus&quot;), Cooper&#x27;s hawk (&quot;Accipiter cooperii&quot;), goshawks, gray hawk (&quot;Buteo plagiatus&quot;), red-shouldered hawk and broad-winged hawk (&quot;Buteo platypterus&quot;). 

These species range from the sharp-shinned hawk, the smallest North American accipitrid, to the goshawk, which at is nearly red-tailed hawk sized. Additionally, there are records of red-tailed hawks hunting 9 species of owl, ranging in size from the northern saw-whet owl (&quot;Aegolius acadius&quot;) to juveniles of the great gray owl (&quot;Strix nebulosa&quot;) and seemingly adults of the barred owl (&quot;Strix varia&quot;). Red-tails will also hunt falcons including adult American kestrels (&quot;Falco sparverius&quot;) and merlins (&quot;Falco columbarius&quot;) and presumed nestlings of the peregrine falcon (&quot;Falco peregrinus&quot;). When hunting other raptorial birds, red-tailed hawks seem to ambush them from a perch, diving suddenly and unexpectedly upon spotting the quarry and tend to have the greatest success when the raptorial prey is distracted, such as those migrating on windy days, feeding on their own prey and tending to their nest.

In turn, red-tailed hawks may engage in behavior that straddles territorial exclusion and anti-predator behavior to the two much larger raptors in North America which actively hunt, the eagles. Red-tails are most commonly seen flying towards and aggressively displacing both flying bald eagles (&quot;Haliaeetus leucocephalus&quot;) and golden eagles (&quot;Aquila chrysaetos&quot;), but may also, to the contrary, unobtrusively duck down out of flight to an inconspicuous perch when an eagle is spotted. The behavioral variation is probably related to the activity of hawks, which may feel the need to protect their nests and food resources while actively breeding but are not usually willing to risk their lives in attacking an eagle while migrating or wintering. At times mobbing behavior of smaller raptors may cause both eagles to turn over and present their large talons to their attacker, which can be dangerous for the smaller hawk.

Besides the great horned owl, the two eagle species are the only known animals known to regularly threaten red-tailed hawks of any age. In particular, the golden eagle is probably the greatest daytime threat to fledged immature and adult red-tails, as these have turned up in many dietary studies of the powerful eagle. Less efficient as a predator of red-tails, bald eagles nonetheless have been recording killing adults in some cases or, more often, depredating red-tailed hawk nests. On occasion, this may result in the bald eagle bringing the nestling red-tails to their own nest and, for some reason, not killing them. In some cases, the bald eagles inadvertently actually raise the nestling red-tails themselves and the baby red-tailed hawks may successfully fledge. In one case, a red-tailed hawk was observed to kill a bald eagle chick, whether this was predatory or competitive, it quickly abandoned the dead nestling after the eagle&#x27;s parents returned. On several tropical islands, which are often shared only with other hawks, owls and falcons of only medium or small size and typically lack larger raptors or carnivorans, the red-tailed hawk may be the largest native predator and will, in these cases, be considered the apex predator. 

Other than large birds of prey, extensive records of predation on red-tailed hawks is surprisingly poor, in spite of several populations recording nestlings and eggs disappearing through presumed acts of natural predation. The most likely major predator of eggs and nestlings that disappear is the raccoon which, during its nocturnal foraging, is a notorious enemy of nearly any kind of birds nest. It is also known that unidentified large snakes, probably consisting of the same species that the red-tails so readily predate during broad daylight, will prey upon nestling red-tails. In California, common ravens were recorded preying on the downy young of red-tailed hawks. Other corvids, including blue jays (&quot;Cyanocitta cristata&quot;), California scrub jays (&quot;Aphelocoma californica&quot;) and crows, are known to feed on eggs and small nestlings either when nest attendance is atypically low by the hawks or when they can successful harass the parent hawks via mobbing so severely that they temporarily leave the nest. Blackflies (&quot;Simulium canonicolum&quot;) have been recorded as killing several red-tail chicks through blood loss.

There are also several cases of possible prey turning the tables on red-tailed hawks and either maiming or killing them. This is especially true of snakes, with some prey species of &quot;Pituophis&quot;, &quot;Pantherophis&quot; and &quot;Coluber&quot; known to overpower and nearly kill, often the hawk survives only if by human intervention. Not infrequently prey such as coral snakes and rattlesnakes may succeed in killing red-tailed hawks with their venom, even if they themselves are also killed and partially consumed. Peregrine falcons are also known to kill red-tailed hawks that have come too close to their nests by stooping upon them.

==Reproduction==

===Courtship and pre-laying behaviors===
Pairs either court for the first time or engage in courtship rituals to strengthen pre-existing pair bonds before going into the breeding. The breeding season usually begins in late February through March, but can commence as early as late December in Arizona and late January in Wisconsin or to the opposite extreme as late as mid-April as in Alberta. 

In this pre-nesting period, high-circling with much calling will occur. One or both members of a pair may be involved. The courtship display often involves dangling legs, at times the pair will touching each other&#x27;s wings and male&#x27;s feet may touch female&#x27;s back, she may occasionally roll over and present talons. Food passes are rarely reported. High soaring occurs aseasonally. Circling above territory tends to be done noisily and conspicuously, helping insure against possible takeovers. Spring circling of a pair can be a prelude to copulation. A typical sky-dance involves the male hawk climbing high in flight with deep, exaggerated beats and then diving precipitously on half-closed wings at great speed, checking, and shooting back up, or often plunging less steeply and repeating process in a full rollercoaster across the sky. 

Sky-dances are done on periphery of the pair&#x27;s territory and it appears to designate the territory limits, occasionally one male&#x27;s sky-dance may also trigger a sky-dance by a neighboring male, who may even run a parallel course in the sky. Sky-dances no longer occur after late incubation. Boundary flight displays may be engaged in by all four birds of 2 adjacent pairs. Cartwheeling with interlocking talons is also seen occasionally in spring, almost always a territorial male expelling an intruding one, the latter often being a second or third year male that is newly mature. A perched display, with fluffed-out breast feathers may too occur at this time. 

Even males that are in spring migration have been recorded engaging in a separate display: circling at slow speed before partially closing wings, dropping legs with talons spread and tilting from side-to-side. A female hawk is usually around when migrating male does this but she does not engage in this display herself. The area of occupancy of breeding territories by pairs is variable based on regional habitat composition. The highest recorded density of pairs was in California where each pair occurred on , which was actually just ahead of Puerto Rico where pair occupancy averaged in peak habitat. The largest known average territory sizes were surprisingly in Ohio, where the average area of occupancy by pairs was recorded as .

In Wisconsin mean ranges for males range from in males and from in females, respectively in summer and winter. Here and elsewhere, both members of the pair stay quite close together throughout winter if they are sedentary. On the other hand, migrant populations tend to separate while migrating and return to the same territory to find its prior mate, sometimes before they reach their home range. In Alaska, returning migrant pairs were able to displace lone red-tailed hawks that had stayed on residence, especially lone males but sometimes even lone females. In general, the red-tailed hawk will only take a new mate when its original mate dies. Although pairs often mate for life, replacement of mates can often be quite fast for this common bird species. In one case in Baja California, when a female was shot on 16 May, the male of that pair was seen to have selected a new mate the following day. In copulation, the female, when perched, tilts forward, allowing the male to land with his feet lodged on her horizontal back. The female twists and moves her tail feathers to one side, while the mounted male twists his cloacal opening around the female&#x27;s cloaca. Copulation lasts 5 to 10 seconds and during pre-nesting courtship in late winter or early spring can occur numerous times each day.

===Nests===

The pair constructs a stick nest most often in a large tree off the ground. They may too nest on virtually any man-made structures with some variety of ample ledges or surface space and good views of the surrounding environment (i.e. powerline poles, radio transmission towers, skyscraper buildings). 

Much variation is recorded in nest usage behavior, many red-tails build new nests every year despite prior nests sometimes being in good standing and unoccupied, some may reuse a nest in subsequent years or may leave a nest for a year and then come back to it the following year. A red-tailed hawk nest is typically located in a gradient zone between woods with tall, mature trees, if available, and openings whether this is composed of shrubland, grassland or agricultural areas. Nest sites vary greatly in topography and vegetative composition. While tree nests are largely preferred, occasionally they nest on cliff ledges may be used even where other nest sites are presumably available. Cliff nests may be located at or higher above the nearest flat ground. At times, unlike great horned owls, red-tailed hawks have been recorded nesting in surprisingly unbroken forests. In North Dakota, nest sites tend to be concentrated along wooded river drainages. 

Compared to Swainson&#x27;s hawks and ferruginous hawks, red-tailed hawk nests are usually in taller trees and are closer to waterways. In Puerto Rico, nests are most often found in transitional zone between dry lowlands and mountainous cloud forests, with trees typically taller than their neighbors to allow views of more than half of their home ranges. More than 21 tree species were recorded used in Puerto Rico. Tree species is seemingly unimportant to red-tailed hawks. In some parts of Arizona, saguaro cactus were used exclusively as nesting sites. Alternately, old nests of other &quot;Buteo&quot; hawks, corvids, golden eagles and even leaf nests of tree squirrels have also been used by red-tailed hawks. Both members of the pair will build the nests but the female spends more time forming the bowl, with the greatest activity often in the morning and nest building completed in 1 week or less. The nest is generally in diameter, with a mean of roughly , and can be up to tall after several years use. The inner bowl averages about wide and deep. The nest is constructed of twigs, and lined with bark, pine needles, corn cobs, husks, stalks, aspen catkins, or other plant lining matter. Lining the nest may be for warning other red-tails of the active use of a nest. In moderate to northern climes, red-tailed hawks tend to face to the south or west, presumably to make them less vulnerable to strong northeasterly storm winds.

===Eggs===
In most of the interior contiguous United States the first egg is laid between mid-March and early April, ranging from 3–5 weeks after the nest is constructed, with the clutch completed 2–5 days after the initial egg is laid. The average date of the laying the first egg can be variable: peaking mid-January in Puerto Rico, averaging 9 March in Arizona, 26 March in the Front Range Urban Corridor and 1 May in Alberta. The mean initiation of clutches may bump weeks later if or more of snow is still on the ground in Wisconsin during March. A clutch of one to three eggs is laid in March or April, depending upon latitude, with four eggs being uncommon and five and perhaps even six increasingly rare. Clutch size depends almost exclusively on the availability of prey for the adults. At the species level, body size also determines clutch size. 

For example, while the total clutch weighs up to 18% of the females weight and the clutch size averages 2–3 eggs, a larger raptor like the golden eagle lays a smaller clutch, usually not more than two, that weighs less than 10% in total of the female&#x27;s body mass, whereas a smaller raptor like the kestrel lays a larger clutch averaging five that weighs 50% of the females weight. Average clutch sizes vary from 1.96 eggs in Alaska when prey populations were low up to 2.96 eggs in Washington. Eggs are laid approximately every other day. Average egg sizes in height and width (each with a sample size of 20) are in the following subspecies- &quot;B. j. borealis&quot;: ; &quot;B. j. calurus&quot;: ; &quot;B. j. fuertesi&quot;: . The eggs of red-tailed hawks are mostly white, sometimes with a faint buffy wash; at times the eggs manifest a sparsely or heavily marked with blotches of buff, pale reddish-brown, dark brown, or purple. The markings often appear indistinctly and may combine to form a fine speckling. They are incubated primarily by the female, with the male substituting when she leaves to hunt or merely stretch her wings. Rarely do the males incubate more than four hours of daylight. The male brings most food to the female while she incubates.

===Hatching, development, and brooding===

After 28–35 days of incubation (averaging about 3 days longer in the Caribbean as does fledgling as compared to North American red-tails), the eggs hatch over 2–4 days. Like most raptorial birds, the nestlings are altricial and nidicolous at hatching. Hatchlings average in body mass with no difference in sizes of the sexes until the young are about 29 days old for mass and 21 days or so for external linear standard measurements such as bill and talon size. The female broods them while the male provides most of the food to the female and the young, which are also known as eyasses (pronounced &quot;EYE-ess-ez&quot;). The female feeds the eyasses after tearing the food into small pieces. The young red-tails are active by the second day when they issue soft peeping calls, bounce, and wave continuously with their wings. By day 7, the bouncing and peeping begin to wane, and young start to peck at prey in their nest. Nestlings emit high whistling notes (usually in response to adults overhead) by day 10, sit up on tarsometatarsi by day 15, become aggressive toward intruders by day 16, strike out with talons and wings by day 21, begin to stretch wings and exercise regularly by day 30. After 42–46 days, the eyasses begin to leave the nest and tear apart prey for themselves. 

The amount of food brought to the nest daily varies considerably, based on brood size and prey availability. In Alberta, an average of is brought each day for 1 to 3 nestlings while in Washington, it was estimated a minimum of per day for 1 surviving nestling and in Wisconsin, an estimated was needed for 1 nestling and for 2. Brooding is strenuous for parent red-tails and both members of the pair usually lose some weight, especially the female. Some females may lose over between hatching and fledging. During brooding the female may become aggressive to intruders, including humans. In the east, red-tailed hawk females rarely defend nests from humans but historically in California and quite often still in Alaska, some female will dive repeatedly and &quot;savagely&quot;, sometimes snapping off large branches in her temper, occasionally stunning herself or inadvertently knocking down her own youngster if it is attempting to fledge. Apparently, the less extensive prior exposure they have to humans may make mature females more aggressive towards humans near the nest. Although development is asynchronical in most nests, runting may sometimes be recorded and even siblicide may occur, with the parents feeding the weaker, younger chicks less so and both the siblings and parents occasionally aggressively pecking the &quot;runts&quot; of the nest. Ultimately, the runt in such cases does not usually survive and may be either found crushed in the nest, discarded out of the nest after starvation or consumed by the parents or the siblings. However, as a whole, such killings are fairly rare and only occur when food supplies are extremely low, often this being in sync with poor spring weather (such as overly rainy or cold conditions). 

If there is too much food, such as California ground squirrels in California, the parents will discard remains after a day or two since decomposition of their prey invites infection, other diseases and blood-sucking insects to the nest that may endanger the nestlings. However, after about 4 weeks, the female often stops discarding leftover prey and the increased presence of flies may form somewhat of a risk to disease in the young but may also merely get the young to leave the nest sooner. One nest in California had two females and one male attended to; the male performed his usual function but both females would brood and tend to the nest. Additionally, bald eagles have been recorded to occasionally adopt red-tail fledglings into their nests. As recorded in Shoal Harbor Migratory Bird Sanctuary located near Sydney, British Columbia, on 9 June 2017, a juvenile red-tailed hawk was taken by a pair of bald eagles back to their nest, whereupon the chick, originally taken as prey, was accepted into the family by both the parents and the eagles&#x27; three fledglings. After surviving 6 weeks among the eagles, the fledgling, nicknamed &quot;Spunky&quot; by birdwatchers, had successfully begun learning to hunt and fly, showing that the aggressive hawk was able to survive among a nest of much larger adoptive siblings.

===Fledging and immaturity===

Young typically leave the nest for the first time and attempt their first flights at about 42–46 days after hatching but usually they stay very near the nest for the first few days. During this period, the fledglings remain fairly sedentary, though they may chase parents and beg for food. Parents deliver food directly or, more commonly, drop it near the young. Short flights are typically undertaken for the first 3 weeks after fledgling and the young red-tails activity level often doubles. About 6–7 weeks after fledging, the young begin to capture their own prey, which often consists of insects and frogs that the young hawks can drop down to onto the ground with relative ease. At the point they are 15 weeks old, they may start attempts to hunt more difficult mammal and bird prey in sync with their newly developed skills for sustained flight, and most are efficient mammal predators fairly soon after their first attempts at such prey. Shortly thereafter, when the young are around 4 months of age, they become independent of their parents. In some extreme cases, juvenile red-tails may prolong their association with their parents to as long as they are half a year old, as was recorded in Wisconsin. 

After dispersing from the parental territory, juveniles from several nests may congregate and interact in a juvenile staging area. Although post-fledgling siblings in their parents care are fairly social, they are rarely seen together post distribution from their parents range. Usually, newly independent young hawks leave the breeding area and migrate, if necessary, earlier than adults do, however the opposite was true in the extreme north of Alaska, where adults were recorded to leave first. Immature hawks in migratory populations tend to distribute further in winter than adults from these populations do. Immatures attempting to settle for the winter often are harassed from territory to territory by older red-tails, settling only in small, marginal areas. In some cases, such as near urban regions, immatures may be driven to a small pockets of urban vegetation with less tree cover and limited food resources. 

When a distant adult appears, immatures may drop from a prominent perch to a more concealed one. In some cases, hungry immature red-tails have been recorded making attempts at hunting prey beyond their capacities, expending valuable energy, such as healthy adults of larger carnivorans such as coyotes (&quot;Canis latrans&quot;), foxes and badgers and healthy flying passerines. There are some cases of red-tailed hawks, presumably younger than two years of age, attempting to breed, often with an adult bird of the opposite sex. Such cases have been recorded in Alberta, Arizona and Wisconsin, with about half of these attempts being successful at producing young. However, while adult plumage and technically sexual maturity is attained at two years old, many red-tails do not first successfully breed until they are around 3 years of age.

===Breeding success and longevity===

Breeding success is variable due to many factors. Estimated nesting success usually falls between 58% and 93%. Nesting success rates are probably drive primarily by prey populations, regional habitat composition, competition levels with other red-tailed hawks, predation rates (often due to great horned owls or perhaps raccoons) and human disturbance levels. In Oregon specifically, nesting success varied primarily based on &quot;dispersion and density of perches&quot; secondarily to ground squirrel abundance and whether the nest of other pairs red-tails was directly visible from a nest. 

Repeated disturbances at the nest early in the nesting cycle may cause abandonment of eggs or nestlings in some cases, but seemingly pairs are less likely to abandon the young later in the season in cases of human disturbance. 30% of nesting deaths in a study from Wisconsin were from nestlings falling to their death or the nest collapsing. In Puerto Rico, habitat appeared to be the primary driver of breeding success, as in lowland pastures nesting success was 43% producing a mean number of fledglings of 1.5 whereas in cloud forest success was 34% producing a mean of 0.7 fledglings. A modelling study in Puerto Rico showed that, apart from adult survival, nestling survival had the second greatest influence on population growth. In Wyoming, 12 pairs on a 12 square mile tract produced an average of 1.4 young per pair. In comparison, the mean number of fledglings was 0.96 in Michigan, 1.36 in Montana and was 1.4 in the Appalachians. In Wisconsin, the number of young successfully to fledge ranged from 1.1 to 1.8 from year to year probably depending on staple prey numbers. The record lifespan in wild for a red-tailed hawk is 25 years and 5 months from banding studies. In comparison, lifespans of up to 29.5 years have been recorded in captivity. 

In the wild, other red-tailed hawks have lived for at least 25 years, for example, Pale Male was born in 1990, and in Spring 2014 was still raising eyasses. However, of 5195 banded wild red-tailed hawks in one bander&#x27;s recordings, only 31 were reported to have survived to 17 years of age and only 11 survived for 20 years. The average mortality rate at 1 year of age for red-tails is 54% and thereafter is around 20% from banding sources. The estimated average lifespan of red-tailed hawks who attain maturity, per Palmer (1988), was claimed as only 6 to 7 years. The main causes of mortality considered as electrocution on power lines, other collisions, shooting, consumption of poisoned baits set for other animals and collision with vehicles and other crafts. While most mortality of young red-tails is at least mainly due to natural causes, mortality of fledged or older red-tails is now mostly attributable to human killing, accidental or intentional, as well as flying into manmade materials. 

Hawks in urban areas are threatened by the use of rat traps and poisoned bait to kill rodents. This generally consists of warfarin cookies which induce internal bleeding in rats and mice, and a hawk that ingests rodents who have consumed rat poison can itself be affected. Red-tailed hawks are also vulnerable to fatal bacterial infections include peritonitis, myocarditis, granulamotous, sarcocystosis and mycobateriosis as well as some forms of viral infection, to which immature hawks especially, as they often have less access to coverage in poor weather conditions, are most vulnerable. Neither this nor other &quot;Buteo&quot; hawks were found to be highly susceptible to long-term DDT egg-shell thinning due to being part, generally, of relatively short, terrestrial-based food chains.

== Relationship with humans ==

=== Use in falconry ===
The red-tailed hawk is a popular bird in falconry, particularly in the United States where the sport of falconry is tightly regulated; this type of hawk is widely available and is frequently assigned to apprentice falconers. Red-tailed hawks are highly tameable and trainable, with a more social disposition than all other falcons or hawks other than the Harris&#x27;s hawk. They are also long lived and fairly disease resistant, allowing a falconer to maintain a red-tailed hawk as a hunting companion for potentially up to two decades. There are fewer than 5,000 falconers in the United States, so despite their popularity any effect on the red-tailed hawk population, estimated to be about one million in the United States, is negligible.

Not being as swift as falcons or accipiters, red-tailed hawks are usually used to hunt small game such as rabbits and squirrels, as well as larger quarry such as hares. However, some individuals may learn to ambush game birds on the ground before they are able to take off and accelerate to full speed, or as they have fly into cover after a chase. Some have even learned to use a falcon-like diving stoop to capture challenging game birds such as pheasants in open country.

In the course of a typical hunt, a falconer using a red-tailed hawk most commonly releases the hawk and allows it to perch in a tree or other high vantage point. The falconer, who may be aided by a dog, then attempts to flush prey by stirring up ground cover. A well-trained red-tailed hawk will follow the falconer and dog, realizing that their activities produce opportunities to catch game. Once a raptor catches game, it does not bring it back to the falconer. Instead, the falconer must locate the bird and its captured prey, &quot;make in&quot; (carefully approach) and trade the bird off its kill in exchange for a piece of offered meat.

=== Feathers and Native American use ===
The feathers and other parts of the red-tailed hawk are considered sacred to many indigenous people and, like the feathers of the bald eagle and golden eagle, are sometimes used in religious ceremonies and found adorning the regalia of many Native Americans in the United States; these parts, most especially their distinctive tail feathers, are a popular item in the Native American community. As with the other two species, the feathers and parts of the red-tailed hawk are regulated by the eagle feather law, which governs the possession of feathers and parts of migratory birds.

<text>Michael Vartan (born November 27, 1968) is an American actor, known for his role as Michael Vaughn on the ABC television action drama &quot;Alias&quot;, his role on the TNT medical drama &quot;Hawthorne&quot;, and his role on the &quot;E!&quot; drama &quot;The Arrangement&quot; as Terence Anderson. His film roles include &quot;The Pallbearer&quot;, &quot;Never Been Kissed&quot;, &quot;The Next Best Thing&quot;, &quot;One Hour Photo&quot;, &quot;To Wong Foo, Thanks For Everything! Julie Newmar&quot;, &quot;Monster-in-Law&quot;, &quot;Rogue&quot;, &quot;Colombiana&quot;, and &quot;Small Town Crime&quot;.

==Early life==
Vartan is the son of Edmond &quot;Eddie&quot; Vartan, a musician, and Doris (née Pucher), a painter and artist. His paternal aunt is singer Sylvie Vartan and his stepfather is writer Ian La Frenais. Michael&#x27;s paternal grandfather was of Armenian and Bulgarian descent, while Michael&#x27;s paternal grandmother was of Hungarian Jewish background. Michael&#x27;s mother is a Polish Jewish immigrant to the United States.

Vartan has said about his French background that &quot;The funny thing is I&#x27;m actually a Polish Jew who happens to be born in France. My mom is Polish and my dad is Bulgarian. I don&#x27;t have an ounce of French blood. But I work it&quot;. He has stated that he tends to be considered a Frenchman in the United States and an American in France.

His parents divorced when he was five and he moved to the United States with his mother. He moved back to France to be with his father until his high school years, and grew up a &quot;farm kid&quot; in a &quot;simple environment&quot; in Fleury, Manche, a small town in Normandy. At age eighteen, Vartan moved back with his mother in Los Angeles, telling her that he wanted to be an artist, because he did not wish to fulfill the mandatory military service required in France. In Los Angeles, he attended an acting school after he was told he possessed acting talent. He had also attended the prestigious Lycée Français de Los Angeles. Vartan now considers himself to be American and stated on the talk show &quot;Rove&quot; that he would like Australia to be his second home. He is bilingual, being fluent in French and English.

==Career==
After starring roles in European films, including an acclaimed performance in the Taviani Brothers&#x27; Fiorile, and several smaller film roles, Vartan had noticeable supporting roles in major Hollywood movies, including &quot;Never Been Kissed&quot; (1999), &quot;One Hour Photo&quot; (2002) and &quot;Monster-in-Law&quot; (2005). In 2007, he appeared in the Australian horror film &quot;Rogue&quot;, and starred in the film &quot;Jolene&quot; in 2008.

Vartan&#x27;s most notable role to date has been as Michael Vaughn in the American television series &quot;Alias&quot; (2001–2006). He played the role of Lancelot in TNT&#x27;s production of Marion Zimmer Bradley&#x27;s &quot;The Mists of Avalon&quot; (2001). Vartan has also had guest appearances on &quot;Friends&quot; (as Dr. Tim Burke, Tom Selleck&#x27;s character&#x27;s son) and &quot;Ally McBeal&quot; (as Jonathan Basset). He also appeared on the show &quot;Kitchen Confidential&quot;, which starred his former &quot;Alias&quot; co-star Bradley Cooper, as a French chef who was Cooper&#x27;s rival. In September 2007, Vartan played James Walker, a main role in the ABC drama &quot;Big Shots&quot;. However, the show was canceled after one season.

Vartan co-starred opposite Jada Pinkett Smith in TNT&#x27;s series &quot;Hawthorne&quot;. Vartan replaced Jeffrey Nordling, who played the role in the pilot. TNT canceled the series after its third season.

He starred as Terence Anderson on the &quot;E!&quot; drama &quot;The Arrangement&quot;.

Vartan co-hosts a weekly live sports program called &quot;Advanced Shouting&quot; with friends Dan Petriw and Noel Fogelman. The first episode was uploaded to YouTube in June 2020. The broadcast is also available via Facebook.

==Personal life==
Vartan began dating his &quot;Alias&quot; co-star Jennifer Garner in mid-2003. After several months of rumors, their break-up was confirmed in August 2004.

In March 2010, Vartan announced his engagement to Lauren Skaar, whom he met in a Whole Foods Market parking lot in Los Angeles in 2009. The couple married on April 2, 2011, at the Pelican Hill Resort in Newport Beach, California. Skaar filed for divorce in July 2014, citing irreconcilable differences.

Vartan has a dog named Millie, with whom he appeared in a PETA video about good canine care and to whom he wrote a &quot;love letter&quot; for an anthology. He is a keen supporter of Australian rules football, having watched the game on numerous visits to Australia, in particular Melbourne. He is good friends with Brendan Fevola and supports Carlton. After the completion of the film &quot;Rogue&quot;, Vartan got a Southern Cross tattoo on his right arm to show his love for Australia.

Vartan is also a fan of ice hockey, a trait incorporated into his character, Michael Vaughn, on &quot;Alias&quot;.

<text>In geometry, a heptagon or septagon is a seven-sided polygon or 7-gon.

The heptagon is sometimes referred to as the septagon, using &quot;sept-&quot; (an elision of &quot;&quot;, a Latin-derived numerical prefix, rather than &quot;&quot;, a Greek-derived numerical prefix; both are cognate) together with the Greek suffix &quot;-agon&quot; meaning angle.

== Regular heptagon ==
A regular heptagon, in which all sides and all angles are equal, has internal angles of 5π/7 radians (128 degrees). Its Schläfli symbol is {7}.

===Area===
The area (&quot;A&quot;) of a regular heptagon of side length &quot;a&quot; is given by:

:formula_1

This can be seen by subdividing the unit-sided heptagon into seven triangular &quot;pie slices&quot; with vertices at the center and at the heptagon&#x27;s vertices, and then halving each triangle using the apothem as the common side. The apothem is half the cotangent of formula_2 and the area of each of the 14 small triangles is one-fourth of the apothem.

The area of a regular heptagon inscribed in a circle of radius &quot;R&quot; is formula_3 while the area of the circle itself is formula_4 thus the regular heptagon fills approximately 0.8710 of its circumscribed circle.

===Construction===
As 7 is a Pierpont prime but not a Fermat prime, the regular heptagon is not constructible with compass and straightedge but is constructible with a marked ruler and compass. It is the smallest regular polygon with this property. This type of construction is called a neusis construction. It is also constructible with compass, straightedge and angle trisector. The impossibility of straightedge and compass construction follows from the observation that formula_5 is a zero of the irreducible cubic . Consequently, this polynomial is the minimal polynomial of whereas the degree of the minimal polynomial for a constructible number must be a power of 2.



===Approximation===
An approximation for practical use with an error of about 0.2% is to use half the side of an equilateral triangle inscribed in the same circle as the length of the side of a regular heptagon. It is unknown who first found this approximation, but it was mentioned by Heron of Alexandria&#x27;s &quot;Metrica&quot; in the 1st century AD, was well known to medieval Islamic mathematicians, and can be found in the work of Albrecht Dürer. Let &quot;A&quot; lie on the circumference of the circumcircle. Draw arc &quot;BOC&quot;. Then formula_6 gives an approximation for the edge of the heptagon.

This approximation uses formula_7 for the side of the heptagon inscribed in the unit circle while the exact value is formula_8.

&quot;Example to illustrate the error:
At a circumscribed circle radius &quot;r = 1 m&quot;, the absolute error of the 1st side would be &quot;approximately -1.7 mm&quot;

===Other approximations===

There are other approximations of a heptagon using compass and straightedge, but they are time consuming to draw.

=== Symmetry ===
The &quot;regular heptagon&quot; belongs to the D7h point group (Schoenflies notation), order 28. The symmetry elements are: a 7-fold proper rotation axis C7, a 7-fold improper rotation axis, S7, 7 vertical mirror planes, σv, 7 2-fold rotation axes, C2, in the plane of the heptagon and a horizontal mirror plane, σh, also in the heptagon&#x27;s plane. 

===Diagonals and heptagonal triangle===

The regular heptagon&#x27;s side &quot;a&quot;, shorter diagonal &quot;b&quot;, and longer diagonal &quot;c&quot;, with &quot;a&quot;&lt;&quot;b&quot;&lt;&quot;c&quot;, satisfy

:formula_9
:formula_10
:formula_11
:formula_12 (the optic equation)

and hence

:formula_13

and

:formula_14
:formula_15
:formula_16

Thus –&quot;b&quot;/&quot;c&quot;, &quot;c&quot;/&quot;a&quot;, and &quot;a&quot;/&quot;b&quot; all satisfy the cubic equation formula_17 However, no algebraic expressions with purely real terms exist for the solutions of this equation, because it is an example of casus irreducibilis.

The approximate lengths of the diagonals in terms of the side of the regular heptagon are given by

:formula_18

We also have

:formula_19

:formula_20

:formula_21

and

:formula_22

A heptagonal triangle has vertices coinciding with the first, second, and fourth vertices of a regular heptagon (from an arbitrary starting vertex) and angles formula_23 and formula_24 Thus its sides coincide with one side and two particular diagonals of the regular heptagon.

===In polyhedra===

Apart from the heptagonal prism and heptagonal antiprism, no convex polyhedron made entirely out of regular polygons contains a heptagon as a face.

== Star heptagons==
Two kinds of star heptagons (heptagrams) can be constructed from regular heptagons, labeled by Schläfli symbols {7/2}, and {7/3}, with the divisor being the interval of connection.

&lt;br&gt;Blue, {7/2} and green {7/3} star heptagons inside a red heptagon.

==Tiling and packing==

A regular triangle, heptagon, and 42-gon can completely fill a plane vertex. However, there is no tiling of the plane with only these polygons, because there is no way to fit one of them onto the third side of the triangle without leaving a gap or creating an overlap. In the hyperbolic plane, tilings by regular heptagons are possible. There are also concave heptagon tilings possible in the Euclidean plane.
The regular heptagon has a double lattice packing of the Euclidean plane of packing density approximately 0.89269. This has been conjectured to be the lowest density possible for the optimal double lattice packing density of any convex set, and more generally for the optimal packing density of any convex set.

==Empirical examples ==

The United Kingdom, since 1982, has two heptagonal coins, the 50p and 20p pieces. The Barbados Dollar are also heptagonal. Strictly, the shape of the coins is a Reuleaux heptagon, a curvilinear heptagon which has curves of constant width; the sides are curved outwards to allow the coins to roll smoothly when they are inserted into a vending machine. Botswana pula coins in the denominations of 2 Pula, 1 Pula, 50 Thebe and 5 Thebe are also shaped as equilateral-curve heptagons. Coins in the shape of Reuleaux heptagons are also in circulation in Mauritius, U.A.E., Tanzania, Samoa, Papua New Guinea, São Tomé and Príncipe, Haiti, Jamaica, Liberia, Ghana, the Gambia, Jordan, Jersey, Guernsey, Isle of Man, Gibraltar, Guyana, Solomon Islands, Falkland Islands and Saint Helena. The 1000 Kwacha coin of Zambia is a true heptagon.

The Brazilian 25-cent coin has a heptagon inscribed in the coin&#x27;s disk. Some old versions of the coat of arms of Georgia, including in Soviet days, used a {7/2} heptagram as an element.

A number of coins, including the 20 euro cent coin, have heptagonal symmetry in a shape called the Spanish flower.

In architecture, heptagonal floor plans are very rare. A remarkable example is the Mausoleum of Prince Ernst in Stadthagen, Germany.

Many police badges in the US have a {7/2} heptagram outline.
