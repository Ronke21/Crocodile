<text>The British Science Association (BSA) is a charity and learned society founded in 1831 to aid in the promotion and development of science. Until 2009 it was known as the British Association for the Advancement of Science (BA). The current Chief Executive is Hannah Russell. The BSA&#x27;s mission is to get more people engaged in the field of science by coordinating, delivering, and overseeing different projects that are suited to achieve these goals. The BSA &quot;envisions a society in which a diverse group of people can learn and apply the sciences in which they learn.&quot; and is managed by a professional staff located at their Head Office in the Wellcome Wolfson Building. The BSA offers a wide variety of activities and events that both recognise and encourage people to be involved in science. These include the British Science Festival, British Science Week, the CREST Awards, For Thought, The Ideas Fund, along with regional and local events.

==History==

===Foundation===
The Association was founded in 1831 and modelled on the German Gesellschaft Deutscher Naturforscher und Ärzte. It was founded during post-war reconstruction after the Peninsula war to improve the advancement of science in England. The prime mover (who is regarded as the main founder) was Reverend William Vernon Harcourt, following a suggestion by Sir David Brewster, who was disillusioned with the elitist and conservative attitude of the Royal Society. Charles Babbage, William Whewell and J. F. W. Johnston are also considered to be founding members. The first meeting was held in York (at the Yorkshire Museum) on Tuesday 27 September 1831 with various scientific papers being presented on the following days. It was chaired by Viscount Milton, president of the Yorkshire Philosophical Society, and &quot;upwards of 300 gentlemen&quot; attended the meeting. The &quot;Preston Mercury&quot; recorded that those gathered consisted of &quot;persons of distinction from various parts of the kingdom, together with several of the gentry of Yorkshire and the members of philosopher societies in this country&quot;. The newspaper published the names of over a hundred of those attending and these included, amongst others, eighteen clergymen, eleven doctors, four knights, two Viscounts and one Lord.

From that date onwards a meeting was held annually at a place chosen at a previous meeting. In 1832, for example, the meeting was held in Oxford, chaired by Reverend Dr William Buckland. By this stage the Association had four sections: Physics (including Mathematics and Mechanical Arts), Chemistry (including Mineralogy and Chemical Arts), Geology (including Geography) and Natural History.

During this second meeting, the first objects and rules of the Association were published. Objects included systematically directing the acquisition of scientific knowledge, spreading this knowledge as well as discussion between scientists across the world, and to focus on furthering science by removing obstacles to progress. The rules established included what constituted a member of the Association, the fee to remain a member, and the process for future meetings. They also include dividing the members into different committees. These committees separated members into their preferred subject matter, and were to recommend investigations into areas of interest, then report on these findings, as well as progress in their science at the annual meetings.

Additional sections were added throughout the years by either splitting off part of an original section, like making Geography and Ethnology its own section apart from Geology in 1851, or by defining a new subject area of discussion, such as Anthropology in 1869.

A very important decision in the Association&#x27;s history was made in 1842 when it was resolved to create a &quot;physical observatory&quot;. A building that became well known as the Kew Observatory was taken on for the purpose and Francis Ronalds was chosen as the inaugural Honorary Director. Kew Observatory quickly became one of the most renowned meteorological and geomagnetic observatories in the world. The Association relinquished control of the Kew Observatory in 1871 to the management of the Royal Society, after a large donation to grant the observatory its independence.

In 1872, the Association purchased its first central office in London, acquiring four rooms at 22 Albemarle Street. This office was intended to be a resource for members of the Association.

One of the most famous events linked to the Association Meeting was an exchange between Thomas Henry Huxley and Bishop Samuel Wilberforce in 1860 (see the 1860 Oxford evolution debate). Although it is often described as a &quot;debate&quot;, the exchange occurred after the presentation of a paper by Prof Draper of New York, on the intellectual development of Europe with relation to Darwin&#x27;s theory (one of a number of scientific papers presented during the week) and the subsequent discussion involved a number of other participants (although Wilberforce and Huxley were the most prominent). Although a number of newspapers made passing references to the exchange, it was not until later that it was accorded greater significance in the evolution debate.

===Electrical standards===
One of the most important contributions of the British Association was the establishment of standards for electrical usage: the ohm as the unit of electrical resistance, the volt as the unit of electrical potential, and the ampere as the unit of electrical current. A need for standards arose with the submarine telegraph industry. Practitioners came to use their own standards established by wire coils: &quot;By the late 1850s, Clark, Varley, Bright, Smith and other leading British cable engineers were using calibrated resistance coils on a regular basis and were beginning to use calibrated condensers as well.&quot;

The undertaking was suggested to the BA by William Thomson, and its success was due to the use of Thomson&#x27;s mirror galvanometer. Josiah Latimer Clark and Fleeming Jenkin made preparations. Thomson, with his students, found that impure copper, contaminated with arsenic, introduced significant extra resistance. The chemist Augustus Matthiessen contributed an appendix (A) to the final 1873 report that showed temperature-dependence of alloys.
:The natural relation between these units are clearly, that a unit of electromotive force between two points of a conductor separated by a unit of resistance shall produce unit current, and that this current in a unit of time convey a unit quantity of electricity.
The unit system was &quot;absolute&quot; since it agreed with previously accepted units of work, or energy:
:The unit current of electricity, in passing through a conductor of unit resistance, does a unit of work or its equivalent in a unit of time.

=== Committee on Mechanical Nomenclature ===
In 1888, at a meeting of the British Association in Bath, the Committee on Mechanical Nomenclature suggested three new units: the kine for velocity, equal to 1 centimeter per second; the bole for momentum, equal to 1 gram times 1 kine; and the barad for pressure, equal to 1 dyne per square centimeter. The London &quot;Electrical Review&quot; called the new units &quot;an abomination, and wholly unnecessary&quot; and attributed their creation to a &quot;craze&quot; for naming new units. William Henry Preece noted in 1891 that he had only seen one instance of use of the new units. By 1913, the units had fallen entirely out of use.

===Other===
The Association was parodied by English novelist Charles Dickens as &#x27;The Mudfog Society for the Advancement of Everything&#x27; in &quot;The Mudfog Papers&quot; (1837–38).

In 1878 a committee of the Association recommended against constructing Charles Babbage&#x27;s analytical engine, due to concerns about the current state of the machine&#x27;s lack of complete working drawings, the machine&#x27;s potential cost to produce, the machine&#x27;s durability during repeated use, how and what the machine will actually be utilized for, and that more work would need to be done to bring the design up to a standard at which it is guaranteed to work.

The Association introduced the British Association (usually termed &quot;BA&quot;) screw threads, a series of screw thread standards in sizes from 0.25 mm up to 6 mm, in 1882. The standards were based on the metric system, although they had to be re-defined in imperial terms for use by UK industry.  The standard was modified in 1884 to restrict significant figures for the metric counterpart of diameter and pitch of the screw in the published table, as well as not designating screws by their number of threads per inch, and instead giving an approximation due to considerable actual differences in manufactured screws.

In 1889, a member of the Rational Dress Society, Charlotte Carmichael Stopes, stunned the proceedings of a meeting of the Association in Newcastle upon Tyne by organizing an impromptu session where she introduced rational dress to a wide audience, her speech being noted in newspapers across Britain.

In 1903, microscopist and astronomer Washington Teasdale died whilst attending the annual meeting.

==Perception of science in the UK==
The Association&#x27;s main aim is to make science more relevant, representative and connected to society. 

At the beginning of the Great Depression, the Association&#x27;s focus began to shift their purpose to account for not only scientific progress, but the social aspects of such progress. In the Association&#x27;s 1931 meeting, the president General Jan Christiaan Smuts ended his address by the proposal of linking science and ethics together but provided no means to actuate his ideas. In the following years, debate began as to whom the responsibilities of scientists fell upon. The Association adopted a resolution in 1934 that dedicated efforts to better balance scientific advancement with social progress.

J.D. Bernal, a member of the Royal Society and the British Association, wrote The Social Function of Science in 1939, describing a need to correctly utilize science for society and the importance of its public perception. The idea of the public perception of science was furthered in 1985 when the Royal Society published a report titled The Public Understanding of Science. 

In the report, a committee of the Royal Society determined that it was scientists&#x27; duty to communicate to and educate the public. Lord George Porter, then president of the Royal Society, British Association, and director of the Royal Institution, created the Committee on the Public Understanding of Science, or COPUS, to promote public understanding of science.
Professor Sir George Porter became the president in September 1985. He won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry 1967 along with Manfred Eigen, and Ronald George Wreyford Norrish. When asked about the scientific literacy of Britain, he stated that Britain was the least educated country compared to all the other advanced countries. His idea to solve this problem would be to start scientific education for children at the age of 4. He says his reason for such an early age is because that is the age when children are the most curious, and implementing science at that age will help them gain curiosity towards all disciplines of science. When asked why public ignorance to science matters, his response wasIt matters because among those who are scientifically illiterate are some of those who are in power, people who lead us in politics, in civil service, in the media, in the church, often in industry and sometimes even in education. Think, for example, about the enormous influence of scientific knowledge on one&#x27;s whole philosophy of life, even one&#x27;s religion. It is no more permissible for the archbishops of today, who advise their flocks on how to interpret the Scriptures, to ignore the findings of Watson and Crick, than it was right for clerics of the last century to ignore the work of Darwin. Science today is all-pervasive. Without some scientific and technical education, it is becoming impossible even to vote responsibly on matters of health, energy, defense or education. So unless things change, we shall soon live in a country that is backward not only in its technology and standard of living but in its cultural vitality too. It is wrong to suppose that by foregoing technological and scientific education we shall somehow become a nation of artists, writers or philosophers instead. These two aspects of culture have never been divorced from each other throughout our history. Every renaissance, every period that showed a flowering of civilization, advanced simultaneously in the arts and sciences, and in technology too.

Sir Kenneth Durham, former director of research at Unilever, on becoming president in August 1987 followed on from Sir George Porter saying that science teachers needed extra pay to overcome the scarcity of mathematics and physics teachers in secondary schools, and that &quot;unless we deal with this as matter of urgency, the outlook for our manufacturing future is bleak&quot;. He regretted that headmasters and careers masters had for many years followed &#x27;the cult of Oxbridge&#x27; because &quot;it carried more prestige to read classics at Oxbridge and go into the Civil Service or banking, than to read engineering at, say, Salford, and go into manufacturing industry&quot;. He said that reporting of sciences gave good coverage to medical science, but that &quot;nevertheless, editors ought to be sensitive to developments in areas such as solid state physics, astro-physics, colloid science, molecular biology, transmission of stimuli along nerve fibres, and so on, and that newspaper editors were in danger of waiting for disasters before the scientific factors involved in the incidents were explained.

In September 2001 Sir William Stewart, as outgoing president, warned that universities faced &quot;dumbing down&quot; and thatwe can deliver social inclusiveness, and the best universities, but not both from a limited amount of money. We run the risk of doing neither well. Universities are underfunded, and must not be seen simply as a substitute for National Service to keep youngsters off the dole queue... [Adding,] scientists have to be careful and consider the full implications of what they are seeking to achieve. The problem with some clever people is that they find cleverer ways of being stupid.

In the year 2000, Sir Peter Williams had put together a panel to discuss the shortage of physics majors. A physicist called Derek Raine had stated that he has had multiple firms call him up asking for physics majors. The report they made stated that it is critical that they increase the number of physics teachers, or it will have a detrimental effect on the number of future engineers and scientists.

===British Science Festival===
The Association&#x27;s major emphasis in recent decades has been on public engagement in science. Its annual meeting, now called the British Science Festival, is the largest public showcase for science in the UK and attracts a great deal of media attention. It is held at UK universities in early September for one week, with visits to science-related local cultural attractions.

The 2010 Festival, held in Birmingham with Aston University as lead University partner, featured a prank event: the unveiling of &quot;Dulcis foetidus&quot;, a fictional plant purported to emit a pungent odour. An experiment in herd mentality, some audience members were induced into believing they could smell it. 
The Festival has also been the home to protest and debate. In 1970 there were protestors over the use of science for weapons.

===Science Communication Conference===
The Association organised and held the annual Science Communication Conference for over ten years. It was the largest conference of its kind in the UK, and addressed the key issues facing science communicators. In 2015, the BSA introduced a new series of smaller events for science communicators, designed to address the same issues as the Science Communication Conference but for a more targeted audience.

===British Science Week===

In addition to the British Science Festival, the British Science Association organises the British Science Week (formerly National Science &amp; Engineering Week), an opportunity for people of all ages to get involved in science, engineering, technology and maths activities, originating as the National Week of Science, Engineering and Technology.

The Association also has a young people&#x27;s programme, the CREST Awards which seeks to involve school students in science beyond the school curriculum, and to encourage them to consider higher education and careers in science.

Huxley Summit

Named after Thomas Huxley, the Huxley Summit is a leadership event run by the British Science Association, where 250 of the most influential people in the UK are brought together to discuss scientific and social challenges that the UK faces in the 21st century and to develop a link between scientists and non-scientists to ensure that science can be understood by society as a whole. On 8 November 2016, the British Science Association held the very first Huxley Summit at BAFTA, London. The theme of the summit was &quot;Trust in the 21st Century&quot; and how that would affect the future of science, innovation, and business.

Media Fellowship Schemes

The British Science Association&#x27;s Media Fellowship provides the opportunity for practicing scientists, clinicians, and engineers to spend a period of time working at media outlets such as the Guardian, BBC Breakfast or The Londonist. After their time with the media placement, the fellows attend the British Science Festival which will offer these practitioners valuable working experience with a range of media organizations along with learning from a wide range of public engagement activities and be able to network with academics, journalists and science communicators.

== CREST Awards ==
CREST Awards is the British Science Association&#x27;s scheme to encourage students aged 5–19 to get involved with STEM projects and encourage scientific thinking. Awards range from Star Awards (targeted at those aged 5–7) to Gold Awards (targeted to those aged 16–19). Overall, 30,000 awards are undertaken annually. Many students who do CREST Awards, especially Silver and Gold Awards which require 30 and 70 hours of work respectively, enter competitions like the UK Big Bang Fair.

==Patrons and Presidents of the British Science Association==
Traditionally the president is elected at the meeting usually held in August/September for a one-year term and gives a presidential address upon retiring. The honour of the presidency is traditionally bestowed only once per individual. Written sources that give the year of presidency as a single year generally mean the year in which the presidential address is given. In 1926/1927 the association&#x27;s patron was King George V and the president was his son Edward, Prince of Wales. The vice-presidents for the Leeds meeting at this time included City of Leeds Alderman Charles Lupton and his brother, The Rt. Hon. the Lord Mayor of Leeds Hugh Lupton. The husband of the brothers&#x27; first cousin once removed - Lord Airedale of Gledhow - was also a vice-president at the Leeds meeting.

<doc id="373119" wikidata="Q2625996" url="?curid=373119" title="Tara (Hindu goddess)">
<text> is the Hindu goddess of felicity and sanguineness. She is also known as the &quot;Wisdom Goddess&quot; in Nepal and Tibet. Tara is the consort of Hindu god Brihaspati, the god of planet Jupiter. According to some Puranas, Tara sired or mothered a child named Budha, the god of Mercury through Chandra and had a son named Kacha through Brihaspati.

==Story==

Tara was the wife of Brihaspati, the guru of Devas. According to historians, it is mentioned as her husband spent most of his time with the problems and matters of Devas, she felt being ignored by her husband. One day, Chandra, the moon god visited Brihaspati. There he saw Tara and was captivated by her beauty. Chandra used Hypnosis on Tara.

Brihaspati was infuriated and demanded Chandra to return his wife. Chandra told Brihaspati that Tara was happy and satisfied with him. He enquired as to how an old man could be the husband of a young woman. This made Brihaspati more annoyed and he warned Chandra for battle. Indra and other Devas gathered to fight a war. Chandra was not ready to give Tara back and he took help from the Asuras and their preceptor, Sukra. The Devas were assisted by Shiva and his companions. Devas and Asura were about to fight a war, but Brahma, the creator god, stopped them and convinced Chandra to return Tara. In some versions, Shiva stopped the war.

After some time, Brihaspati found out that Tara was pregnant and questioned her who the father of the child was. But Tara remained silent. After the boy was born, both Chandra and Brihaspati claimed to be his father. Tara revealed it was Chandra&#x27;s son. The boy was named Budha.

<text>In the Hindu epic &quot;Ramayana&quot;, Maricha, or Mareecha (Sanskrit: मारीच, IAST: ), is a rakshasha, who was killed by Rama, the hero of the epic and an avatar of Vishnu. He is mentioned as an ally of Ravana, the antagonist of the epic. His most notable exploit is his role in the kidnapping of Sita, Rama&#x27;s wife. His son Kalanemi was killed by Hanuman.

Cursed to be a rakshasa along with his mother Tataka and brother Subahu, Maricha initially led his life terrorizing sages. He was defeated by Rama at the behest of the sage Vishvamitra. He tried again to kill Rama, but had to run for his life again. Ultimately, Maricha assumed the form of a golden deer and helped Ravana kidnap Sita.

==Legend==

=== Early life ===
Maricha was the son of the demon Sunda (son of Jamba or Jharjha) and a Yakshini named Tataka, also known as Taraka, Tadaka or Thataka. Tataka was the daughter of the yaksha king Suketu, who had gained her as a blessing from the god Brahma. Maricha also had a younger brother called Subahu. The siblings were very handsome and noble in character. They became skilled in sorcery. Once, Sunda attacked the ashram (hermitage) of the sage Agastya in an intoxicated state. The angry Agastya burnt him by his meditative powers. When Tataka learned of Sunda&#x27;s death, she and her sons attacked Agastya to wreak vengeance on the sage. The sage cursed Tataka, Maricha and Subahu, transforming them into wicked, hideous, demonic Rakshasas.

Tataka and her sons then went to Patala (the underworld) to seek aid from Sumali, the patriarch of the Rakshasas. Sumali took them to his grandson, Ravana, the Rakshasa king of Lanka. Ravana helped the trio capture the states of Malada and Karusha, situated on the banks of the river Sarayu near its confluence with the Ganges. The trio destroyed the states and turned them into a dense forest, which became known as the forest of Tataka. They terrorized the people, devouring anyone who dared venture into that forest. The gods, demons and men, as well as even the sun and the clouds did not dare to enter the territory of Tataka and her sons. Maricha and Subahu liked to harass the sages (rishis) in the region and destroy their yajna sacrifices. The brothers threw blood, flesh, and bones on the sacrificial altars and destroyed the sanctity of the sacrifices of the sages.

=== Facing Rama at Vishvamitra&#x27;s yajna ===

The great sage Vishvamitra was living in the area near the forest of Tadaka and was doing penance and yajna with his disciples, and being tormented by Tadaka and her sons. Unable to tolerate the menace any longer, Vishvamitra approached Dasharatha, the King of Ayodhya for help. He requested Dasharatha to send his eldest son, Rama to protect his yajna. Though Dasharatha was initially reluctant to send his 16-year-old boy, he finally sent Rama and his younger brother Lakshmana with Vishvamitra on the advice of the royal guru Vashishtha. Vishvamitra trained them in warfare and taught them various mantras.

When Vishvamitra and the princes were passing through the forest of Tadaka, Tadaka attacked them. Rama, aided by Lakshamana, slew her with his arrow. Vishvamitra blessed Rama, as the gods rejoiced in the end of Tadaka. The sage gave him divine weapons as a reward. Vishvamitra then began his six-day yajna, with the princes standing on guard.

While the first five days passed without incident, on the sixth day the sacrificial fire suddenly faltered, indicating trouble. Maricha and his brother Subahu, with a horde of rakshasas, appeared from the treetops like black clouds, roaring and making a thunderous noise. They tried to destroy the yajna fire by showering it with blood and flesh. Rama fired his Astra (weapon) &quot;Manavastra&quot; (which could hit a target miles away) from his bow. The arrow struck Maricha&#x27;s chest and threw him a hundred leagues away, into the ocean. In another version, Maricha fled to the ocean just by hearing the sound of Rama&#x27;s bow. Subahu and the other demons were killed by Rama, using various other weapons. The sacrifice was completed successfully. Later on, under the guidance of Vishvamitra, Rama weds Sita, the adopted daughter of Janaka and the princess of Mithila.

=== Encounter with Rama in Dandakaranya ===
Rama, Lakshmana and Sita were exiled for a period of fourteen years from the kingdom by Dasharatha at the behest of Rama&#x27;s stepmother Kaikeyi. The trio traveled south from Ayodhya and passed through the Dandakaranya (Dandaka forest) to the banks of the Godavari River where they built a hermitage at Panchavati.

Maricha recalls the following incident when talking with Ravana. However, it does not appear as a separate event in the chronological telling of the &quot;Ramayana&quot;. Maricha returned to Dandakaranya and disguised himself as a beast with a flaming tongue and two sharp horns. He was accompanied by two rakshasas in the form of animals. They feasted on human flesh and traveled to pilgrimage sites, terrorizing ascetics. They would kill ascetics and drink their blood. Once, Maricha saw Rama, Lakshmana and Sita. Remembering his last encounter, Maricha attacked them in his ferocious beast form to seek vengeance with his demonic companions. Rama shot three arrows at once, killing Maricha&#x27;s allies, but the third arrow narrowly missed Maricha, who fled in fear.

The spared Maricha was transformed into a saintly person. He lived a life of an ascetic. He set up an ashram, grew matted hair and wore tree bark. He gave up his demonic qualities and started to realise his mistakes and became a devotee of Rama by then. At last he will die at the hands of Rama according to Ravana&#x27;s strategy.

=== Role as the golden deer ===

One day, Surpanakha, the rakshasa sister of Ravana, disguised herself as a beautiful maiden and proposed marriage to Rama. Rama refused her proposal and directed her to Lakshmana in jest. Lakshmana joked that she should marry his master Rama. An angry Surpanakha returned to Rama and attacked Sita. But Lakshmana took out his sword and cut off Shurpanakha&#x27;s ears and nose. The humiliated Surpanakha approached Khara, a man-eating rakshasha, to avenge her with a vendetta against Rama. However, Khara, his general Dushana and his army of 14,000 were killed by Rama when they attacked him. Surpanakha and her maternal uncle, Akampana, who escaped the carnage, reached Lanka with the news and proposed that Ravana steal Sita, Rama&#x27;s beautiful wife.

Ravana started brooding and thinking of his next course of action. He then flew in his aerial chariot across the sea to meet his ally, Maricha. Maricha lived in a secluded hermitage on the ocean coast. Ravana informed Maricha of the death of Khara, Dushana and their army as well as of the insult of Surpanakha. He told Maricha to turn into a golden deer with silver spots and graze in the vicinity of Rama&#x27;s ashram. On seeing the deer, Sita would surely tell Rama and Lakshamana to catch it. When the brothers left Sita alone, Ravana would abduct her. Rama, saddened by the grief of Sita&#x27;s separation, would be easily killed by Ravana. Maricha, who had a first-hand experience of Rama&#x27;s strength, was horrified by the idea. The wise Maricha attempted to dissuade Ravana by recalling the righteousness and valor of Rama and warned that this idea would only lead to the doom of Ravana, Lanka and the rakshasa race. He narrated his first encounter with Rama, when he underestimated Rama and dismissed him as a boy, how he was thrown hundreds of leagues away by Rama&#x27;s single arrow. He followed that with the story of his second encounter with Rama in Dandakaranya.

However, Ravana ignored Maricha&#x27;s words and asked how he dared praise Rama and question the prowess of Ravana, his king. Ravana announced that he would abduct Sita with or without Maricha&#x27;s help to get revenge for the death of rakshasas. He reiterated his plan and told Maricha to be the golden deer. If successful, he and Maricha would return to Lanka and Ravana would grant half his kingdom to Maricha. Ravana threatened that while his plan might lead to Maricha&#x27;s death by Rama, Maricha&#x27;s refusal would mean an instant death at his, Ravana&#x27;s, hand. Finally Maricha agreed, but not before prophesying his death as well as the end of Ravana, Lanka and rakshasas and warning Ravana that he would suffer the results of dismissing Maricha&#x27;s words, which were for his own good. Another version states that Maricha felt that death by the divine Rama would be better than one by Ravana. Ravana was pleased by Maricha&#x27;s consent and embraced him.

Maricha and Ravana then flew to Panchavati in Ravana&#x27;s chariot and stopped close to the ashram of Rama. Maricha then assumed the form of a beautiful golden deer, which had silver spots and glowed with many gems like sapphire, moonstone, black jet and amethyst on its body. Maricha began grazing in the vicinity of Rama&#x27;s ashram so that Sita would catch a glimpse of him. As soon as the animal-eating rakshasa Maricha entered the forest in the form of a deer, the other animals smelt something was wrong and ran away in fear. Maricha found Sita collecting flowers and ran in front of her. The golden luster of the deer which was gamboling around the hermitage lured Sita, who was awestruck and called Rama and Lakshmana to see the spectacular animal.

On seeing the wondrous deer, Lakshmana sensed foul play and suggested that the deer was an illusory form of Maricha, who preyed on kings who came into the forest for hunting. Sita persuaded Rama to get her the deer, dead or alive. If caught, she said it could be bred as a pet and taken back to Ayodhya as remembrance of their 14 years exile. Rama said that this deer would die at his hands that day to comply with Sita&#x27;s wish, or, if it was a magical rakshasa like Maricha – who killed kings and harmed sages – as Lakshmana had said, then too it was his duty to kill the beast. Rama decided to go after the deer and slay it and asked Lakshmana to take care of Sita in the meantime.

Maricha ran, followed by Rama. Maricha led Rama far away from the hermitage, which made Rama very angry. After a long chase, the tired deer stopped in a shady grassland. Rama seized the opportunity and shot it down with his golden arrow. When the dying Maricha was returning to his real form he cried out, &quot;Oh Sita! Oh Lakshmana!&quot;, mimicking Rama&#x27;s voice. Sita fell prey to the ruse and asked Lakshmana to go and search for Rama. When Lakshmana insisted that no one could harm Rama, Sita – still very much worried – implored, and then ordered Lakshmana to go. Lakshmana reluctantly left to look for Rama. With Lakshmana gone, Ravana appeared as a mendicant (Sadhu) and kidnapped Sita as she stepped forward to give him alms. The &quot;Ramayana&quot; then narrates the tale of how Rama defeats Ravana in Lanka and regains Sita.

<text>Lakshmana Rekha (), in some later versions of the Hindu epic &quot;Ramayana&quot;, is a line in the soil drawn by Lakshmana. This line is drawn around the cottage and dwelling in the forest that he shared with his elder brother, Rama, and Rama&#x27;s wife, Sita. The line is meant to protect Sita, while he was away searching for Rama. This line is not featured in the original epic by Valmiki.

In the story, Rama goes chasing a golden deer (which is actually the rakshasa Maricha in disguise), and does not return for a long time. When Sita beseeches Lakshmana to depart in search of his brother, the prince, who could not bear to see Sita cry in grief, reluctantly decides to go and search for Rama. However, before leaving he uses his divine powers and draws this protective line around the cottage . This is subject to his condition that Sita not cross the protective line that he draws around the dwelling. According to this legend, anybody other than Rama, Sita, and himself who attempted to cross the line with any kind of malicious intent would face severe divine resistance from the line and it will be impossible to cross it. Once Lakshmana leaves in search of Rama, the rakshasa king, Ravana, arrives on the site in the form of a mendicant, and asks Sita for alms. Sita goes inside and Ravana tries to enter the cottage but is immediately stopped by the divine power of the line and realizes that its impossible for him to enter forcefully. He then tricks sita to cross the line and not suspecting the ploy, sita unsuspectingly crosses the Lakshmana Rekha to provide alms to him. Ravana promptly abducts her and flies her to Lanka upon his Pushpaka Vimana.

The &quot;Ramacharitamanas&quot;, the popular north Indian rendering of the story of Rama, does not feature the Lakshmana Rekha story in the Aranya Kanda. However, in the Lanka Kanda of the Ramcharitmanas, (35.1) Ravana&#x27;s wife Mandodari rebukes him on his boisterous claims of valour by hinting that his claims of strength and valour are shallow, for he could not even cross a small line drawn by Rama&#x27;s younger brother, Lakshmana.

The Radhey Shyam Ramayana mentions that the crossing of Lakshamana Rekha by Sita was done absent-mindedly by an anxious Sita only to honour the Indian tradition of &quot;Atithi Devo Bhava&quot; : guests are to be accorded the respect of God himself. Sita crosses the boundary only to give alms to Ravana once he insists that the alms cannot be accepted across a barrier as crossing it was against the principle of the free will of the donor.

In local tradition, the line is believed to have been drawn at Panchavati, in the forest of Dandakaranya, which is now part of the city of Nashik in Maharashtra.

==Modern use==
Lakshmana Rekha, in modern Indian parlance, refers to a strict convention or a rule, never to be broken. See the American Bright-line rule. It often refers to the ethical limits of an action, traversing which may lead to undesirable consequences. Example of use:
:&quot;Constitution is very clear on the roles of the Judiciary and the Legislature, Lok Sabha Speaker Somnath Chatterjee said; both should not cross the Lakshman Rekha&quot;.

<text>Subahu () was a rakshasa featured in the Hindu epic Ramayana.

==Story==

Subahu was the son of Shambara, a demon slayed by Indra. Subahu, Maricha and Maricha&#x27;s mother, Tataka, took immense pleasure in harassing the munis of the jungle, especially Vishvamitra, by disrupting their yajnas with rains of flesh and blood.

Vishvamitra approached Dasharatha for help in getting rid of these pestilences. Dasharatha obliged by sending two of his sons, Rama and Lakshmana, to the forest with Vishvamitra, charging them to protect both the sage and his sacrificial fires.

When Subahu and Maricha again attempted to rain flesh and blood on the sage&#x27;s yajna, Subahu was killed by Rama.

Maricha escaped to Lanka. Out of the fear of Rama, he lived as a sage but was then ordered by Ravana to trick Rama into hunting him down (and kidnap his wife Sita). Maricha refused and tried to persuade Ravana to not commit such a dreadful sin. However, Ravana insisted and threatened to kill him. Maricha eventually decided to be killed by Rama since it was better to die at the hands of God rather than Ravana. He was eventually killed by Rama when he took the form of a deer to distract him. Just before his death, he called out in Rama&#x27;s voice for Lakshmana&#x27;s help. This eventually lured Lakshman away from Sita, and allowed Ravana to assume the form of a sage and abduct her.

<doc id="373128" wikidata="Q2914225" url="?curid=373128" title="Equinumerosity">
<text>In mathematics, two sets or classes &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; are equinumerous if there exists a one-to-one correspondence (or bijection) between them, that is, if there exists a function from &quot;A&quot; to &quot;B&quot; such that for every element &quot;y&quot; of &quot;B&quot;, there is exactly one element &quot;x&quot; of &quot;A&quot; with &quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) = &quot;y&quot;. Equinumerous sets are said to have the same cardinality (number of elements). The study of cardinality is often called equinumerosity (&quot;equalness-of-number&quot;). The terms equipollence (&quot;equalness-of-strength&quot;) and equipotence (&quot;equalness-of-power&quot;) are sometimes used instead.

Equinumerosity has the characteristic properties of an equivalence relation. The statement that two sets &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; are equinumerous is usually denoted
:formula_1 or formula_2, or formula_3

The definition of equinumerosity using bijections can be applied to both finite and infinite sets, and allows one to state whether two sets have the same size even if they are infinite. Georg Cantor, the inventor of set theory, showed in 1874 that there is more than one kind of infinity, specifically that the collection of all natural numbers and the collection of all real numbers, while both infinite, are not equinumerous (see Cantor&#x27;s first uncountability proof). In his controversial 1878 paper, Cantor explicitly defined the notion of &quot;power&quot; of sets and used it to prove that the set of all natural numbers and the set of all rational numbers are equinumerous (an example where a proper subset of an infinite set is equinumerous to the original set), and that the Cartesian product of even a countably infinite number of copies of the real numbers is equinumerous to a single copy of the real numbers.

Cantor&#x27;s theorem from 1891 implies that no set is equinumerous to its own power set (the set of all its subsets). This allows the definition of greater and greater infinite sets starting from a single infinite set.

If the axiom of choice holds, then the cardinal number of a set may be regarded as the least ordinal number of that cardinality (see initial ordinal). Otherwise, it may be regarded (by Scott&#x27;s trick) as the set of sets of minimal rank having that cardinality.

The statement that any two sets are either equinumerous or one has a smaller cardinality than the other is equivalent to the axiom of choice.

== Cardinality ==
Equinumerous sets have a one-to-one correspondence between them, and are said to have the same cardinality. The cardinality of a set &quot;X&quot; is essentially a measure of the number of elements of the set. Equinumerosity has the characteristic properties of an equivalence relation (reflexivity, symmetry, and transitivity):
;Reflexivity: Given a set &quot;A&quot;, the identity function on &quot;A&quot; is a bijection from &quot;A&quot; to itself, showing that every set &quot;A&quot; is equinumerous to itself: .
;Symmetry: For every bijection between two sets &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; there exists an inverse function which is a bijection between &quot;B&quot; and &quot;A&quot;, implying that if a set &quot;A&quot; is equinumerous to a set &quot;B&quot; then &quot;B&quot; is also equinumerous to &quot;A&quot;: implies .
;Transitivity: Given three sets &quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot; and &quot;C&quot; with two bijections and , the composition of these bijections is a bijection from &quot;A&quot; to &quot;C&quot;, so if &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; are equinumerous and &quot;B&quot; and &quot;C&quot; are equinumerous then &quot;A&quot; and &quot;C&quot; are equinumerous: and together imply .

An attempt to define the cardinality of a set as the equivalence class of all sets equinumerous to it is problematic in Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory, the standard form of axiomatic set theory, because the equivalence class of any non-empty set would be too large to be a set: it would be a proper class. Within the framework of Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory, relations are by definition restricted to sets (a binary relation on a set &quot;A&quot; is a subset of the Cartesian product ), and there is no set of all sets in Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory. In Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory, instead of defining the cardinality of a set as the equivalence class of all sets equinumerous to it one tries to assign a representative set to each equivalence class (cardinal assignment). In some other systems of axiomatic set theory, for example in Von Neumann–Bernays–Gödel set theory and Morse–Kelley set theory, relations are extended to classes.

A set &quot;A&quot; is said to have cardinality smaller than or equal to the cardinality of a set &quot;B&quot;, if there exists a one-to-one function (an injection) from &quot;A&quot; into &quot;B&quot;. This is denoted |&quot;A&quot;| ≤ |&quot;B&quot;|. If &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; are not equinumerous, then the cardinality of &quot;A&quot; is said to be strictly smaller than the cardinality of &quot;B&quot;. This is denoted |&quot;A&quot;| &lt; |&quot;B&quot;|. If the axiom of choice holds, then the law of trichotomy holds for cardinal numbers, so that any two sets are either equinumerous, or one has a strictly smaller cardinality than the other. The law of trichotomy for cardinal numbers also implies the axiom of choice.

The Schröder–Bernstein theorem states that any two sets &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; for which there exist two one-to-one functions and are equinumerous: if |&quot;A&quot;| ≤ |&quot;B&quot;| and |&quot;B&quot;| ≤ |&quot;A&quot;|, then |&quot;A&quot;| = |&quot;B&quot;|. This theorem does not rely on the axiom of choice.

== Cantor&#x27;s theorem ==
Cantor&#x27;s theorem implies that no set is equinumerous to its power set (the set of all its subsets). This holds even for infinite sets. Specifically, the power set of a countably infinite set is an uncountable set.

Assuming the existence of an infinite set N consisting of all natural numbers and assuming the existence of the power set of any given set allows the definition of a sequence N, &quot;P&quot;(N), &quot;P&quot;(&quot;P&quot;(N)), of infinite sets where each set is the power set of the set preceding it. By Cantor&#x27;s theorem, the cardinality of each set in this sequence strictly exceeds the cardinality of the set preceding it, leading to greater and greater infinite sets.

Cantor&#x27;s work was harshly criticized by some of his contemporaries, for example by Leopold Kronecker, who strongly adhered to a finitist philosophy of mathematics and rejected the idea that numbers can form an actual, completed totality (an actual infinity). However, Cantor&#x27;s ideas were defended by others, for example by Richard Dedekind, and ultimately were largely accepted, strongly supported by David Hilbert. See Controversy over Cantor&#x27;s theory for more.

Within the framework of Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory, the axiom of power set guarantees the existence of the power set of any given set. Furthermore, the axiom of infinity guarantees the existence of at least one infinite set, namely a set containing the natural numbers. There are alternative set theories, e.g. &quot;general set theory&quot; (GST), Kripke–Platek set theory, and pocket set theory (PST), that deliberately omit the axiom of power set and the axiom of infinity and do not allow the definition of the infinite hierarchy of infinites proposed by Cantor.

The cardinalities corresponding to the sets N, &quot;P&quot;(N), &quot;P&quot;(&quot;P&quot;(N)), are the beth numbers formula_4, formula_5, formula_6, with the first beth number formula_4 being equal to formula_8 (aleph naught), the cardinality of any countably infinite set, and the second beth number formula_5 being equal to formula_10, the cardinality of the continuum.

== Dedekind-infinite sets ==
In some occasions, it is possible for a set &quot;S&quot; and its proper subset to be equinumerous. For example, the set of even natural numbers is equinumerous to the set of all natural numbers. A set that is equinumerous to a proper subset of itself is called Dedekind-infinite.

The axiom of countable choice (ACω), a weak variant of the axiom of choice (AC), is needed to show that a set that is not Dedekind-infinite is actually finite. The axioms of Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory without the axiom of choice (ZF) are not strong enough to prove that every infinite set is Dedekind-infinite, but the axioms of Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory with the axiom of countable choice () are strong enough. Other definitions of finiteness and infiniteness of sets than that given by Dedekind do not require the axiom of choice for this, see .

== Compatibility with set operations ==
Equinumerosity is compatible with the basic set operations in a way that allows the definition of cardinal arithmetic. Specifically, equinumerosity is compatible with disjoint unions: Given four sets &quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;, &quot;C&quot; and &quot;D&quot; with &quot;A&quot; and &quot;C&quot; on the one hand and &quot;B&quot; and &quot;D&quot; on the other hand pairwise disjoint and with and then This is used to justify the definition of cardinal addition.

Furthermore, equinumerosity is compatible with cartesian products:
* If and then 
* &quot;A&quot; × &quot;B&quot; ~ &quot;B&quot; × &quot;A&quot;
* (&quot;A&quot; × &quot;B&quot;) × &quot;C&quot; ~ &quot;A&quot; × (&quot;B&quot; × &quot;C&quot;)
These properties are used to justify cardinal multiplication.

Given two sets &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot;, the set of all functions from &quot;Y&quot; to &quot;X&quot; is denoted by &quot;X&quot;&quot;Y&quot;. Then the following statements hold:
* If &quot;A&quot; ~ &quot;B&quot; and &quot;C&quot; ~ &quot;D&quot; then 
* &quot;A&quot;&quot;B&quot; ∪ &quot;C&quot; ~ &quot;A&quot;&quot;B&quot; × &quot;A&quot;&quot;C&quot; for disjoint &quot;B&quot; and &quot;C&quot;.
* (&quot;A&quot; × &quot;B&quot;)&quot;C&quot; ~ &quot;A&quot;&quot;C&quot; × &quot;B&quot;&quot;C&quot;
* (&quot;A&quot;&quot;B&quot;)&quot;C&quot; ~ &quot;A&quot;&quot;B&quot;×&quot;C&quot;
These properties are used to justify cardinal exponentiation.

Furthermore, the power set of a given set &quot;A&quot; (the set of all subsets of &quot;A&quot;) is equinumerous to the set 2&quot;A&quot;, the set of all functions from the set &quot;A&quot; to a set containing exactly two elements.

== Categorial definition ==
In category theory, the category of sets, denoted Set, is the category consisting of the collection of all sets as objects and the collection of all functions between sets as morphisms, with the composition of functions as the composition of the morphisms. In Set, an isomorphism between two sets is precisely a bijection, and two sets are equinumerous precisely if they are isomorphic as objects in Set.

<doc id="373137" wikidata="Q2467845" url="?curid=373137" title="Limit ordinal">
<text>In set theory, a limit ordinal is an ordinal number that is neither zero nor a successor ordinal. Alternatively, an ordinal λ is a limit ordinal if there is an ordinal less than λ, and whenever β is an ordinal less than λ, then there exists an ordinal γ such that β &lt; γ &lt; λ. Every ordinal number is either zero, a successor ordinal, or a limit ordinal.

For example, the smallest limit ordinal is ω, the smallest ordinal greater than every natural number. This is a limit ordinal because for any smaller ordinal (i.e., for any natural number) &quot;n&quot; we can find another natural number larger than it (e.g. &quot;n&quot;+1), but still less than ω. The next-smallest limit ordinal is ω+ω. This will be discussed further in the article.

Using the von Neumann definition of ordinals, every ordinal is the well-ordered set of all smaller ordinals. The union of a nonempty set of ordinals that has no greatest element is then always a limit ordinal. Using von Neumann cardinal assignment, every infinite cardinal number is also a limit ordinal.

==Alternative definitions==
Various other ways to define limit ordinals are:
*It is equal to the supremum of all the ordinals below it, but is not zero. (Compare with a successor ordinal: the set of ordinals below it has a maximum, so the supremum is this maximum, the previous ordinal.)
*It is not zero and has no maximum element.
*It can be written in the form ωα for α &gt; 0. That is, in the Cantor normal form there is no finite number as last term, and the ordinal is nonzero.
*It is a limit point of the class of ordinal numbers, with respect to the order topology. (The other ordinals are isolated points.)

Some contention exists on whether or not 0 should be classified as a limit ordinal, as it does not have an immediate predecessor; 
some textbooks include 0 in the class of limit ordinals while others exclude it.

==Examples==
Because the class of ordinal numbers is well-ordered, there is a smallest infinite limit ordinal; denoted by ω (omega). The ordinal ω is also the smallest infinite ordinal (disregarding &quot;limit&quot;), as it is the least upper bound of the natural numbers. Hence ω represents the order type of the natural numbers. The next limit ordinal above the first is ω + ω = ω·2, which generalizes to ω·&quot;n&quot; for any natural number &quot;n&quot;. Taking the union (the supremum operation on any set of ordinals) of all the ω·n, we get ω·ω = ω2, which generalizes to ω&quot;n&quot; for any natural number &quot;n&quot;. This process can be further iterated as follows to produce:

:formula_1

In general, all of these recursive definitions via multiplication, exponentiation, repeated exponentiation, etc. yield limit ordinals. All of the ordinals discussed so far are still countable ordinals. However, there is no recursively enumerable scheme for systematically naming all ordinals less than the Church–Kleene ordinal, which is a countable ordinal.

Beyond the countable, the first uncountable ordinal is usually denoted ω1. It is also a limit ordinal.

Continuing, one can obtain the following (all of which are now increasing in cardinality):

:formula_2

In general, we always get a limit ordinal when taking the union of a nonempty set of ordinals that has no maximum element.

The ordinals of the form ω²α, for α &gt; 0, are limits of limits, etc.

== Properties ==
The classes of successor ordinals and limit ordinals (of various cofinalities) as well as zero exhaust the entire class of ordinals, so these cases are often used in proofs by transfinite induction or definitions by transfinite recursion. Limit ordinals represent a sort of &quot;turning point&quot; in such procedures, in which one must use limiting operations such as taking the union over all preceding ordinals. In principle, one could do anything at limit ordinals, but taking the union is continuous in the order topology and this is usually desirable.

If we use the von Neumann cardinal assignment, every infinite cardinal number is also a limit ordinal (and this is a fitting observation, as &quot;cardinal&quot; derives from the Latin &quot;cardo&quot; meaning &quot;hinge&quot; or &quot;turning point&quot;): the proof of this fact is done by simply showing that every infinite successor ordinal is equinumerous to a limit ordinal via the Hotel Infinity argument.

Cardinal numbers have their own notion of successorship and limit (everything getting upgraded to a higher level).

== Indecomposable ordinals ==
Additively indecomposable

A limit ordinal α is called additively indecomposable if it cannot be expressed as the sum of β &lt; α ordinals less than α. These numbers are any ordinal of the form formula_3 for β an ordinal. The smallest is written formula_4, the second is written formula_5, etc.

Multiplicatively indecomposable

A limit ordinal α is called multiplicatively indecomposable if it cannot be expressed as the product of β &lt; α ordinals less than α. These numbers are any ordinal of the form formula_6 for β an ordinal. The smallest is written formula_7, the second is written formula_8, etc.

Exponentially indecomposable and beyond

The term &quot;exponentially indecomposable&quot; does not refer to ordinals not expressible as the exponential product &quot;(?)&quot; of β &lt; α ordinals less than α, but rather the epsilon numbers, &quot;tetrationally indecomposable&quot; refers to the zeta numbers, &quot;pentationally indecomposable&quot; refers to the eta numbers, etc.

<doc id="373138" wikidata="Q3242360" url="?curid=373138" title="Licchavis of Nepal">
<text>The Licchavis of Nepal (, also &quot;Lichchhavi&quot;, &quot;Lichavi&quot;) ruled over a kingdom in the Kathmandu Valley of Nepal from approximately 450 to 750 CE. The Licchavi clan originated from a branch of the Licchavis of Vaishali who ruled in the territory of modern-day Bihar and who later conquered the Kathmandu Valley. The Licchavis were ruled by a &quot;maharaja&quot;, aided by a prime minister and other royal officials, but in practice local communities were controlled by caste councils.

The ruling period of this dynasty was called the Golden Period of Nepal. A table of the evolution of certain Gupta characters used in Licchavi inscriptions prepared by Gautamavajra Vajrācārya can be found online.

==Records==
It is believed that a branch of the Licchavi clan, having lost their political fortune and military power in Vaishali (Bihar), came to Kathmandu and married with the ruling Queen, Mandeva Shree Vogini of the Nagvanshi clan beginning their rule in Nepal. Source. They also battled with local militias in Chyasal to gain control of Nepal. In the Buddhist Pali canon, the Licchavi are mentioned in a number of discourses, most notably the Licchavi Sutta, the popular Ratana Sutta and the fourth chapter of the Petavatthu. The Mahayana Vimalakirti Sutra also spoke of the city of Vaishali as where the lay Licchavi bodhisattva Vimalakirti was residing.

In the 4th century CE, during the reign of the Gupta emperor Samudragupta, the &quot;Nepalas&quot; are mentioned among the tribes subjugated by him:

Samudragupta was a son of the Gupta Emperor Chandragupta I and the Licchavi princess Kumaradevi. Gold coins bearing portraits of Chandragupta and Kumaradevi have been discovered at Mathura, Ayodhya, Lucknow, Sitapur, Tanda, Ghazipur, and Varanasi in Uttar Pradesh; Bayana in Rajasthan; and Hajipur in Bihar. The obverse of these coins depicts portraits of Chandragupta and Kumaradevi, with their names in the Gupta script. The reverse shows a goddess seated on a lion, with the legend &quot;Li-ccha-va-yah&quot; (𑁊, &quot;the Lichchhavis&quot;).

The earliest known physical record of the kingdom is an inscription of Mānadeva, which dates from 464. It mentions three preceding rulers, suggesting that the Licchavi dynasty began in the late 4th century.

==Government==
The Licchavi were ruled by a &quot;Maharaja&quot; (&quot;great king&quot;), who was aided by a prime minister, in charge of the military and of other ministers. Nobles known as &quot;samanta&quot; influenced the court whilst simultaneously managing their own landholdings and militia. At one point, between approximately 605 and 641, a prime minister called Amshuverma assumed the throne.

The population provided land taxes and conscript labour (&quot;vishti&quot;) to support the government. Most local administration was performed by village heads or leading families. Many kings ruled but the popular ones were Manadeva, Amshuverma etc.

==Economy==
The economy was agricultural, relying on rice and other grains as staples. Villages (&quot;grama&quot;) were grouped into &quot;dranga&quot; for administration. Lands were owned by the royal family and nobles. Trade was also very important, with many trading settlements.

==Geography==

===Domain===
Settlements already filled the entire valley during the Licchavi period. Further settlement extended east toward Banepa, west toward Tistung Deurali, and northwest toward present-day Gorkha.

In the epic the &quot;Ramayana&quot;, the Vanaras help Rama defeat Ravana. They are generally depicted as humanoid apes, or human-like beings.

== Etymology ==
There are three main theories about the etymology of the word &quot;Vanara&quot;:

* Aiyanar suggests that &quot;vanara&quot; means &quot;monkey&quot; derived from the word &quot;vana&quot; (&quot;forest&quot;), Literally meaning &quot;belonging to the forest&quot; Monier-Williams says it is probably derived from &quot;vanar&quot; (lit. &quot;wandering in the forest&quot;) and means &quot;forest-animal&quot; or monkey.
* Devdutt Pattanaik suggests that it derives from the words &quot;vana&quot; (&quot;forest&quot;), and &quot;nara&quot; (&quot;man&quot;), thus meaning &quot;forest man&quot; and suggests that they may not be monkeys, which is the general meaning.
* It may be derived from the words &quot;vav&quot; and &quot;nara&quot;, meaning &quot;is it a man?&quot; (meaning &quot;monkey&quot;) or &quot;perhaps he is man&quot;.

== Identification ==
Although the word Vanara has come to mean &quot;monkey&quot; over the years and the Vanaras are depicted as monkeys in the popular art, their exact identity is not clear. According to the Ramayana, Vanaras were shapeshifters. In the Vanara form, they had beards with extended sideburns, narrowly shaved chin gap, and no moustache. They had a tail and razor-sharp claws. Their skin and skeleton were inforced with an indestructible Vajra, which no earthly element could penetrate. Unlike other exotic creatures such as the rakshasas, the Vanaras do not have a precursor in the Vedic literature. The &quot;Ramayana&quot; presents them as humans with reference to their speech, clothing, habitations, funerals, weddings, consecrations etc. It also describes their monkey-like characteristics such as their leaping, hair, fur and a tail. Aiyanagar suggests that though the poet of the &quot;Ramayana&quot; may have known that vanaras were actually forest-dwelling people, he may portrayed them as real monkeys with supernatural powers and many of them as &quot;&quot;s (portions) of the gods to make the epic more &quot;fantastic&quot;.

According to one theory, the Vanaras are semi-divine creatures. This is based on their supernatural abilities, as well as descriptions of Brahma commanding other deities to either bear Vanara offspring or incarnate as Vanaras to help Rama in his mission. The Jain re-tellings of Ramayana describe them as a clan of the supernatural beings called the Vidyadharas; the flag of this clan bears monkeys as emblems.

G. Ramdas, based on Ravana&#x27;s reference to the Vanaras&#x27; tail as an ornament, infers that the &quot;tail&quot; was actually an appendage in the dress worn by the men of the Savara tribe. (The female Vanaras are not described as having a tail.) According to this theory, the non-human characteristics of the Vanaras may be considered artistic imagination. In Sri Lanka, the word &quot;Vanara&quot; has been used to describe the Nittaewos mentioned in the Vedda legends.

== In the &quot;Ramayana&quot; ==
Vanaras are created by Brahma to help Rama in battle against Ravana. They are powerful and have many godly traits. Taking Brahma&#x27;s orders, the gods began to parent sons in the zion of Kishkindha (identified with parts of present-day Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, and Maharashtra). Rama first met them in Dandaka Forest, during his search for Sita. An army of Vanaras helped Rama in his search for Sita, and also in battle against Ravana, Sita&#x27;s abductor. Nala and Nila built a bridge over the ocean so that Rama and the army could cross to Lanka. As described in the epic, the characteristics of the Vanara include being amusing, childish, mildly irritating, badgering, hyperactive, adventurous, bluntly honest, loyal, courageous, and kind.

== Other texts ==
The Vanaras also appear in other texts, including Mahabharata. The epic Mahabharata describes them as forest-dwelling, and mentions their being encountered by Sahadeva, the youngest Pandava.

== Shapeshifting ==

In the &quot;Ramayana&quot;, the Vanara Hanuman changes shape several times. For example, while he searches for the kidnapped Sita in Ravana&#x27;s palaces on Lanka, he contracts himself to the size of a cat, so that he will not be detected by the enemy. Later on, he takes on the size of a mountain, blazing with radiance, to show his true power to Sita.

<text>The Poleshuks, also known as Polesians (, , , Polish: Poleszucy) are the indigenous population of Polesia (also known as &quot;Polesie&quot; and &quot;Polissia&quot;). Their native speech forms a dialect continuum between the Belarusian and Ukrainian languages and includes recently codified West Polesian, as well as many local variations and sub-dialects.

==History==

Since the interbellum, the Poleshuks started developing a sense of identity, influenced by the ethnic politics of the Second Polish Republic within the Polesie Voivodeship. The voivodship had the sparsest population and among the lowest levels of prosperity, due to its adverse climatic and agricultural (soil) conditions. A 1923 Polish statistical document said that 38.600 of 880.900 of population in Polesie Voivodeship (about 4%) were identified as Polezhuks, who self-identified their ethnicity in the census as &quot;tutejszy&quot; (&quot;local&quot;). The document noted that they were using East Slavic dialects, transitional between Ukrainian and Belarusian, sometimes identified as a separate Polesian language. In the 1931 Polish Census the question about ethnicity was replaced with the question about mother tongue. As a result, 62.5% of population identified their language as &quot;tutejszy&quot; (&quot;local&quot;). (14.5% declared Polish and 10.0% declared Yiddish or Hebrew as mother tongue.) That some respondents declared their language as Belarusian or Ukrainian was interpreted as the formation of the corresponding ethnic consciousness in the area. Currently the ethnic group of Poleshuks is considered one of the distinct cultural and ethnic identities in the area, while most of the population of the Belarusian, Polish and Ukrainian parts of the region of Polesie have assimilated with the respective nations, as well as with Russian ethnos.
At the end of the 1980s, there was a minor campaign in Soviet Byelorussia for the creation of a standard written language for the dialect based on the dialects of Polesia launched by Belarusian writer Nikolai Shelyagovich and his associates as part of his activities for the recognition of Poleshuks as a separate ethnicity and for their autonomy. However, they received almost no support and the campaign eventually melted away.

<text>Polesia, also called Polissia, Polesie, or Polesye, is a natural (geographic) and historical region in Eastern Europe within the East European Plain, including the Belarus–Ukraine border region and part of eastern Poland. This region should not be confused with parts of Russia also traditionally called &quot;Polesie&quot;.

== Extent ==
One of the largest forest areas on the continent, Polesia is located in the southwestern part of the Eastern-European Lowland, the Polesian Lowland. On the western side, Polesia originates at the crossing of the Bug River valley in Poland and the Pripyat River valley of Western Ukraine. The westernmost part of the region, located in Poland and around Brest, Belarus, historically also formed part of the historic region of Podlachia, and is also referred to as such. The modern Polish part was not considered part of Polesia by the late 19th-century &quot;Geographical Dictionary of the Kingdom of Poland&quot;, which defined the region as roughly a triangle between the cities of Brest in the west, Mogilev in the northeast and Kyiv in the southeast. The swampy areas of central Polesia are known as the Pinsk Marshes (after the major local city of Pinsk). Large parts of the region were contaminated after the Chernobyl disaster and the region now includes the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone and Polesie State Radioecological Reserve, named after the region.

== Name ==
The names &quot;Polesia/Polissia/Polesye&quot;, etc. are constructed from the East Slavic root &quot;les&quot; &#x27;forest&#x27;, and the prefix &quot;&quot;, which in the meaning of &#x27;on, by, along&#x27; is used to create place names. Inhabitants of Polesia are called Polishchuks.

== History ==

In ancient times, the areas of today&#x27;s western and west-central Polesia were inhabited by the people of the Milograd culture, the Neuri.

In the late Middle Ages Polesia became part of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, following it into the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth (1569). It was annexed by Russia in the late-18th-century Partitions of Poland. Polesia was largely part of Poland from 1921 to 1939, when the country&#x27;s largest province, the Polesie Voivodeship, bore that name, with the eastern part forming part of the Byelorussian SSR, within which the Polesia Region was created in 1938. From 1931 to 1944, it was explicitly mentioned as constituent part of the short-lived (Byzantine Rite) Ukrainian Catholic Apostolic Exarchate of Volhynia, Polesia and Pidliashia.
Following the 1939 invasion of Poland, most of the region was under Soviet occupation, with the western outskirts under German occupation until 1941, and then the entire region, including the pre-war Soviet-controlled part, was under German occupation until 1943–1944. Since the end of World War II, the region has encompassed areas in eastern Poland, southern Belarus, and northwestern Ukraine.

== Geography ==
Polesia is a marshy region lining the Pripyat River (Pripyat Marshes) in Southern Belarus (Brest, Pinsk, Kalinkavichy, Gomel), Northern Ukraine (in the Volyn, Rivne, Zhytomyr, Kyiv and Chernihiv Oblasts), and partly in Poland (Lublin). It is a flatland within the drainage basins of the Western Bug and Prypyat rivers. The two rivers are connected by the Dnieper-Bug Canal, built during the reign of Stanislaus II of Poland, the last king of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth.

Notable tributaries of the Pripyat are the Horyn, Stokhid, Styr, Ptsich, and Yaselda rivers. The largest towns in the Pripyat basin are Pinsk, Stolin, Davyd-Haradok. Huge marshes were reclaimed from the 1960s to the 1980s for farmland.

The region is subdivided into several subregions among which are:
;Poland
* Western Polesia
;Ukraine
* , a.ka. Lviv Polissia
* 
* 
;Belarus
* Brest Paliessie
* Zaharodzie
* Prypiat Paliessie
* Mazyr Paliessie
* Homiel Paliessie

According to the late 19th-century &quot;Geographical Dictionary of the Kingdom of Poland&quot; Polesie was divided into Northern Polesia, itself divided into Upper Polesia or Pinsk Polesia and Lower Polesia or Mazyr Polesia, and Southern Polesia, itself divided into Volhynian Polesia (overlapping northern Volhynia) and Drevlian Polesia.

===Chernobyl disaster===
This region suffered severely from the Chernobyl disaster. Huge areas were polluted by radioactive elements. The most polluted part includes the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone and the adjacent Polesie State Radioecological Reserve. Some other areas in the region are considered unsuitable for living as well.

== Tourism ==
The Polish part of the region includes the Polesie National Park (&quot;Poleski Park Narodowy&quot;), established 1990, which covers an area of . This and a wider area adjoining it (up to the Ukrainian border) make up the UNESCO-designated West Polesie Biosphere Reserve, which borders a similar reserve (the Shatsk Biosphere Reserve) on the Ukrainian side. There is also a protected area called Prybuzhskaie-Paliessie in the Belarusian part of the region.

The wooden architecture structures in the region were added to the UNESCO World Heritage Tentative List on 30 January 2004 in the Cultural category.

<doc id="373150" wikidata="Q1987461" url="?curid=373150" title="Sugriva">
<text>Sugriva (, ), is a character In the ancient Hindu epic Ramayana. He is the younger brother of Vali, whom he succeeded as ruler of the vanara kingdom of Kishkindha. He is a son of Surya, the Hindu deity of the sun. As the king of the vanaras, Sugriva aided Rama in his quest to liberate his wife Sita from captivity at the hands of the rakshasa king Ravana.

== Nomenclature ==
He is also known as , , , , , Creole: Soogrim, , , , Sugreeva or Sugreev. Malayalam:Sugreevan.

==Legend==

The story of Sugriva is part of Ramayana and in an abbreviated version, is also present in the Mahabharata.

The king of Kishkindha, Vrikshraja, was a divine creature born from Brahma&#x27;s tilaka. He had the body of a human and face and tail of a monkey. He was instructed to roam the forests and kill demons. One day, Vriksharaja entered an enchanted pond, and was transformed into a beautiful lady, attracting the attention of both Indra and Surya. Soon after, they each sired Vali and Sugriva respectively. Vali and Sugriva were born having brute strength, equal to Indra and Surya.

According to a legend from the Kathasaritsagara, Aruṇa, the charioteer of Surya, travelled to Devaloka to see the dance of the apsaras. Since men were not allowed to observe the event, Aruna assumed the feminine form of Arunidevi. Observing the beautiful form of Arunidevi, Indra grew infatuated with her, and a child was soon born to them. On the advice of Indra, Arunidevi took the child to Ahalya, leaving it there before the dawn to be brought up by her. This child became Vali. Aruna reported this incident to Surya, who wished to see his female form of Arunidevi as well. Becoming besotted with her, Surya sired a son from her. The child, Sugriva, would also be raised under the care of Ahalya.

=== Quarrel between brothers ===
Vali ruled the kingdom of Kishkindha; his subjects were the vanaras. Tara is his wife. Angada is his son. His son left his house at a very young age and later became a follower of Vaishnavism. A raging demon by the name of Mayavi came to the gates of the capital and challenged Vali to a fight. Vali accepted the challenge, but when he sallied forth, the demon fled in terror into a deep cave. Vali entered the cave in pursuit of the demon, telling Sugriva to wait outside. When Vali did not return and upon hearing demonic shouts in the cave and seeing blood streaming from its mouth, Sugriva concluded that his brother had been slain. With a heavy heart, Sugriva rolled a boulder to seal the cave&#x27;s opening so as to lock the demon in, returned to Kishkindha, and assumed kingship over the vanaras, taking his wife back from ValiRuma as his queen. Vali, however, ultimately prevailed in his combat with the demon and returned home. Seeing Sugriva acting as king, he concluded that his brother had betrayed him. Though Sugriva humbly attempted to explain himself, Vali would not listen and exiled Sugriva from the kingdom. To exact his vengeance, Vali forcibly took Sugriva&#x27;s wife Rumā for his own, and the brothers became bitter enemies. Sugriva went on to live upon the mountain Rishyamukh, the only place on earth that Vali could not tread on. Vali had been previously cursed by Sage Mathanga to be unable to lay a foot on this mountain on pain of death.

===Sugriva makes an alliance===

In exile, Sugriva made the acquaintance of Rama, the avatar of Vishnu, who is on a quest to rescue his wife Sita from the demon Ravana, king of the rakshasas. Rama promised Sugriva that he would kill Vali and would reinstate Sugriva as the king of the vanaras. Sugriva, in turn, promised to help Rama with his quest.

===The Death of Vali===

Together, Sugriva and Rama went to seek out Vali. While Rama stood back, Sugriva shouted a challenge and dared him to battle. The brothers rushed at each other, fighting with trees and stones, with fists, nails, and teeth. They were evenly matched and indistinguishable to the observer, until Sugriva&#x27;s counselor Hanuman, stepped forward and placed a garland of flowers around Sugriva&#x27;s neck. It is then that Rama emerged with his bow and drove an arrow through Vali&#x27;s heart. After Vali&#x27;s death, Sugriva reclaimed the vanara kingdom, took back his first wife, Rumā, who became his queen. Vali&#x27;s son Angada, became the crown prince.

==Sugriva as King==

After the death of Vali he became king of Kishkinda by the wishes of Rama. He helped Rama to fight Ravana in the war of Lanka. He sent the Vanara Warriors to four sides of earth to search for kidnapped sita. For that he ordered all vanaras on the earth should gather in kishkinda. Many vanara chiefs came with their armies. The search team consisted of his elite warriors nephew Angada, Hanuman, Bhalluka Jambavan and other returned with good news that sita is in Ravana Lanka. After that Sugriva personally commanded his vanara army for Rama to relieve Sita who was being help captive by Ravana. They fight for Sitha and won war. after that Rama reunites with sita.

=== Duel with Lava and Kusha ===
On Lakshmana&#x27;s request and after Guru Vasistha&#x27;s approval, Rama plans to do Ashvamedha yajna. At this auspicious occasion he calls Sugriva along with Angada, Nala, Nila, Jambavantha and Hanuman to come to Ayodhya. Rama greets and hugs Sugriva, Jambavantha and others on their arrival to Ayodhya.

The yajna horse is captured by Lava and Kusha brothers. In the Rama&#x27;s army the news spreads that two muni kumara&#x27;s has captured the Yagya&#x27;s horse. Shatrughana walks and fights with Lava and he is defeated by Lava. Then Lakshamana comes and he is also defeated by Lava due to the fact that he was holding back. Then Bharata asks Rama to give him the permission to go to set horse free from both muni Kumara. Sugriva and Hanuman also request Rama to permit them to go along with Bharata in the battle. Lava and Kusha defeat Bharata and Sugriva and took Hanuman as a prisoner. Hanuman is the only one who knew that Lava and Kusha were sons of his master Rama &amp; Sita and thus allowed himself to be imprisoned by his master&#x27;s sons.

=== Retirement ===
When Rama decided to depart from the world and took &quot;samadhi&quot; in the Sarayu river, Sugriva also retired from earth and went with his father Surya. He crowned his nephew Angada as the next king of Kishkindha. This happened post Vibhishan allowed them.

==Jainism==

According to Jain texts, Sugriva is a human being and he took Jain Diksha and attained Moksha from Mangi-Tungi.

==Depictions==

* The combat of Sugriva with his brother Vali is a favorite motif of the Khmer sculptors contributing to the Angkorian temples and monuments near Siem Reap in Cambodia.
* A detailed and moving tympanum at the 10th century Hindu temple of Banteay Srei depicts the combat of the brothers, as well as Rama&#x27;s intervention and Vali&#x27;s death in the arms of another vanara.
* A bas-relief at the 12th-century temple of Angkor Wat shows the fight between the brothers, arrival of Rama and Vali lying on his death-bed, mourned by many other vanaras. Another scene shows Sugriva and Rama entering into their alliance. A large bas-relief depicts the Battle of Lanka between Rama and Sugriva&#x27;s army of vanaras and Ravana&#x27;s army of Rakshasas.
* The fight between Vali and Sugriva is also represented at the lesser-known 13th century Angkorian temple of Preah Pithu.

<text>Palk Strait is a strait between the Indian state of Tamil Nadu and Northern Province of Sri Lanka. It connects the Palk Bay in the Bay of Bengal in the north with the Gulf of Mannar in the Laccadive sea in the south. It stretches for about and is wide. It is named after Robert Palk, who was a governor of Madras (1755–1763) during the Company Raj period.

Several rivers including the Vaigai flow into the strait. The strait consists of many islands and is interspersed with a chain of low islands and reef shoals that are collectively called Ram Setu or Adam&#x27;s bridge. The shallow waters and reefs make it difficult for large ships to pass through, although fishing boats and small craft navigate the waters. Dredging the sea to make it deeper for navigation and plans for a bridge over the waters have been proposed.

== Geography ==
The Palk strait extends between Pamban island in the south eastern tip of the Indian state of Tamil Nadu and Thalaimannar in the Northern Province of Sri Lanka. It connects the Palk Bay in the Bay of Bengal in the north with the Gulf of Mannar in the Laccadive sea in the south. It stretches for about and is wide. Several rivers including the Vaigai flow into the strait.

The strait consists of many islands and is interspersed with a chain of low islands and reef shoals that are collectively called Ram Setu or Adam&#x27;s bridge. As per the 
Hindu epic &quot;Ramayana&quot;, the bridge was purportedly constructed by the vanara army of Rama to rescue Rama&#x27;s wife Sita from the Asura king Ravana. The strait is relatively shallow with the region around the shoals typically around deep, while the central part of the strait is typically around deep. The strait reaches a maximum depth of .

== Geology ==
Due to lowered sea levels during the Last Glacial Period (115,000-11,700 years Before Present) where sea levels reached a maximum of below present values, the entirety of the relatively shallow strait was exposed as dry land. Following the rise to present sea levels during the Holocene, by around 7,000 years ago, the strait became submerged. The waves around it, to its north and south are of high contrast. To the north, the waves in the Bay of Bengal are mostly swells while that on the south, in the Palk Bay, the waves are mostly smaller wind waves. The significant wave heights is relatively low with an average of around close to the Ram Setu.

== Transport and navigation ==
The shallow waters and reefs make it difficult for large ships to pass through, although fishing boats and small craft navigate the waters. Dredging the sea to make it deeper for navigation and plans for a bridge over the waters have been proposed. Construction of a shipping canal through the strait was first proposed to the British government of India in 1860, and a number of commissions have studied the proposal. The latest of which was the Sethusamudram Shipping Canal Project was commissioned by the Government of India in 2005. However, the plan encountered opposition on religious grounds.

The island of Rameswaram is linked to the Indian mainland by the Pamban Bridge, which was opened for traffic on 24 February 1914. A new railway bridge was completed near the old Pamban Bridge in 2024 after rail transportation on the old bridge was suspended permanently in February 2023 due to concerns on stability of the bridge. An adjacent road bridge was opened in 1988. Trains used to traverse from Madras to Dhanushkodi at the southern tip of the Pamban island and a ferry connected to Talaimannar on the Mannar Island, before a train carried passengers to Colombo. The railway line to Dhanushkodi was destroyed during 1964 Dhanushkodi cyclone along with the Pamban-Dhanuskodi passenger train, killing around 200 people. The ferry service continued till the 1970s between Rameswaram and Talaimannar, but was discontinued, and was reopened in 2011. Palk Strait bridge, was an undersea tunnel linking India and Sri Lanka proposed to be constructed across the Palk Strait.

<doc id="373153" wikidata="Q961559" url="?curid=373153" title="Nguni languages">
<text>The Nguni languages are a group of Bantu languages spoken in southern Africa (mainly South Africa, Zimbabwe and Eswatini) by the Nguni people. Nguni languages include Xhosa, Zulu, Ndebele, and Swati. The appellation &quot;Nguni&quot; derives from the Nguni cattle type. &quot;Ngoni&quot; (see below) is an older, or a shifted, variant.

It is sometimes argued that the use of &quot;Nguni&quot; as a generic label suggests a historical monolithic unity of the people in question, where in fact the situation may have been more complex. The linguistic use of the label (referring to a subgrouping of Bantu) is relatively stable.

From an English editorial perspective, the articles &quot;a&quot; and &quot;an&quot; are both used with &quot;Nguni&quot;, but &quot;a Nguni&quot; is more frequent and more correct especially if &quot;Nguni&quot; is pronounced as it is suggested ().

== Classification ==
Within a subset of Southern Bantu, the label &quot;Nguni&quot; is used both genetically (in the linguistic sense) and typologically (quite apart from any historical significance).

The Nguni languages are closely related, and in many instances different languages are mutually intelligible; in this way, Nguni languages might better be construed as a dialect continuum than as a cluster of separate languages. On more than one occasion, proposals have been put forward to create a unified standard Nguni language.

In scholarly literature on southern African languages, the linguistic classificatory category &quot;Nguni&quot; is traditionally considered to subsume two subgroups: &quot;Zunda Nguni&quot; and &quot;Tekela Nguni&quot;. This division is based principally on the salient phonological distinction between corresponding coronal consonants: Zunda and Tekela (thus the native form of the name &quot;Swati&quot; and the better-known Zulu form &quot;Swazi&quot;), but there is a host of additional linguistic variables that enables a relatively straightforward division into these two substreams of Nguni.

=== Tekela languages ===
* Bhaca 
* Hlubi
* Lala
* Nhlangwini
* Northern Transvaal Ndebele (Sumayela Ndebele)
* Phuthi 
* Swazi

=== Zunda languages ===
* Northern Ndebele (Zimbabwean Ndebele)
* Southern Ndebele (South African Ndebele)
* Xhosa
* Zulu

Note: Maho (2009) also lists S401 Old Mfengu†.

== Characteristics ==
The following aspects of Nguni languages are typical:
* A 5-vowel system, by merging the near-close and close series of Proto-Bantu. (Phuthi has re-acquired a new series of superclose vowels from Sotho)
* Spreading of high tones to the antepenultimate syllable.
* A distinction between high and low tones on noun prefixes, indicating different grammatical roles, accompanied in some cases by an overt pre-prefix called the &quot;augment&quot;.
* Development of breathy-voiced consonants, acting as depressor consonants.
* Development of aspirated consonants.
* Development of click consonants.

== Comparative data ==

Compare the following sentences:

Note: Xhosa = Phuthi = IPA ; Phuthi = ; Zulu = IPA , but in the environment cited here is &quot;nasally permuted&quot; to . Phuthi = breathy voiced = Xhosa, Zulu (in the environment here following the nasal ). Zulu, Swazi, Hlubi = .

Note: Phuthi = IPA .

== See also ==
* Ngoni is the ethnonym and language name of a group living in Malawi, who are a geographically distant descendant of South African Nguni. Ngoni separated from all other Nguni languages subsequent to the massive political and social upheaval within southern Africa, the mfecane, lasting until the 1830s.
* IsiNgqumo is an argot spoken by the homosexuals of South Africa who speak Bantu languages; as opposed to Gayle, the argot spoken by South African homosexuals who speak Germanic languages. IsiNgqumo is based on an Nguni lexicon.

<text>Rameswaram (; also transliterated as Ramesvaram, Rameshwaram) is a municipality in the Ramanathapuram district of the Indian state of Tamil Nadu. It is on Pamban Island separated from mainland India by the Pamban channel and is about from Mannar Island, Sri Lanka. It is in the Gulf of Mannar, at the tip of the Indian peninsula. Pamban Island, also known as Rameswaram Island, is connected to mainland India by the Pamban Bridge. Rameswaram is the terminus of the railway line from Chennai and Madurai. Together with Varanasi, it is considered to be one of the holiest places in India for Hindus and is part of the Char Dham pilgrimage.

According to the Ramayana, Rama is described to have built a bridge from the vicinity of this town across the sea to Lanka to rescue his wife Sita from her abductor Ravana. The temple, dedicated to the Hindu god Shiva, is at the centre of the town and is closely associated with Rama and Shiva. The temple and the town are considered a holy pilgrimage site for Shaivas and Vaishnavas.

Rameswaram is the second closest point from which to reach Sri Lanka from India and geological evidence suggests that the Rama Sethu was a former land connection between India and Sri Lanka.

The town has been in the news in the past due to controversies such as the Sethusamudram Shipping Canal Project, Kachchatheevu, Sri Lankan Tamil refugees and the capturing of local fishermen for alleged cross-border activities by Sri Lankan Forces.

Rameswaram is administered by a municipality established in 1994. The town covers an area of and had a population of 44,856 as of 2011. Tourism and fishery employ the majority of workforce in Rameswaram.

==Legend==
Rameswaram means &quot;Lord of Rama&quot; (&quot;Rāma-īśvaram&quot;) in Sanskrit, an epithet of Shiva, the presiding deity of the Ramanathaswamy Temple. According to Hindu epic &quot;Ramayana&quot;, Rama, the seventh avatar of the god Vishnu, prayed to Shiva here to absolve any sins that he might have committed during his war against the demon-king Ravana in Sri Lanka. According to the &quot;Puranas&quot; (Hindu scriptures), upon the advice of sages, Rama, along with his wife Sita and his brother Lakshmana, installed and worshipped the lingam (an iconic symbol of Shiva) here to expiate the sin of &quot;Brahmahatya&quot; incurred while killing of the Brahmin Ravana. To worship Shiva, Rama wanted to have a lingam and directed his trusted lieutenant Hanuman to bring it from Himalayas. Since it took longer to bring the lingam, Sita built a lingam made of sand from the nearby seashore, which is also believed to be the one in the sanctum of the temple. Sethu Karai is a place before the island of Rameswaram from where Rama is believed to have built a floating stone bridge, the Ramsetu bridge, that further continued to Dhanushkodi in Rameswaram till Talaimannar in Sri Lanka. According to another version, as quoted in &quot;Adhyatma Ramayana&quot;, Rama installed the lingam before the construction of the bridge to Lanka.

==History==

The history of Rameswaram is centred around the island being a transit point to reach Sri Lanka (Ceylon historically) and the presence of Ramanathaswamy Temple. &quot;Tevaram&quot;, the 7th–8th century Tamil compositions on Shiva by the three prominent Nayanars (&quot;Saivites&quot;) namely Appar, Sundarar and Thirugnanasambandar. The Chola king Rajendra Chola I (1012–1040 CE) had a control of the town for a short period. The Jaffna kingdom (1215–1624 CE) had close connections with the island and claimed the title &quot;Setukavalan&quot; meaning custodians of the Rameswaram. Hinduism was their state religion and they made generous contribution to the temple. &quot;Setu&quot; was used in their coins as well as in inscriptions as marker of the dynasty.

According to Firishta, Malik Kafur, the head general of Alauddin Khalji, the ruler of Delhi Sultanate, reached Rameswaram during his political campaign in spite of stiff resistance from the Pandyan princes in the early 14th century. He erected a mosque by name Alia al-Din Khaldji in honour of victory of Islam. The records left by the court historians of the Delhi Sultanate state that Malik Kafur raided Madurai, Chidambaram, Srirangam, Vriddhachalam, Rameswaram and other sacred temple towns, destroyed the temples which were sources of gold and jewels. He brought back enormous loot from Dwarasamudra and the Pandya kingdom to Delhi in 1311.

During the early 15th century, the present-day Ramanathapuram, Kamuthi and Rameswaram were included in the Pandya dynasty. In 1520 CE, the town came under the rule of Vijayanagara Empire. The Sethupathis, the breakaway from Madurai Nayaks, ruled Ramanathapuram and contributed to the Ramanathaswamy temple. The most notable of them are the contributions of Muthu Kumara Ragunatha and Muthu Ramalinga Sethupathi, who transformed the temple to an architectural ensemble. The region then fell under the rule of different leaders Chanda Sahib (1740–1754 CE), Arcot Nawab and Muhammed Yusuf Khan (1725–1764 CE) in the middle of the 18th century. In 1795 CE, Rameswaram came under the direct control of the British East India Company and was annexed to the Madras Presidency. After 1947, the town became a part of independent India.

== Geography ==

Rameswaram has an average elevation of . The island is spread across an area of and is in the shape of a conch. 74% of the area has sandy soil due to the presence of sea and it has many islands surrounding it, the Palk Strait in the north west and Gulf of Mannar in the south East. The Ramanathaswamy Temple occupies major area of Rameswaram. The beach of Rameswaram is featured with no waves at all – the sea waves rise to a maximum height of and the view looks like a very big river.

Rameswaram has dry tropical climate with low humidity, with average monthly rainfall of , mostly from North-East monsoon from October to January. The highest ever temperature recorded at Pamban station was and the lowest was .
Ramsetu Bridge is a chain of limestone shoals, between Rameswaram and Mannar Island, off the northwestern coast of Sri Lanka. Geological evidence suggests that this bridge is a former land connection between India and Sri Lanka. The bridge is long and separates the Gulf of Mannar (North-East) from the Palk Strait (South-West). It was reportedly passable on foot up to the 15th century until storms deepened the channel. The temple records record that Rama&#x27;s Bridge was completely above sea level until it broke in a cyclone in 1480 CE. The bridge was first mentioned in the ancient Indian Sanskrit epic &quot;Ramayana&quot; of Valmiki. The name &quot;Rama&#x27;s Bridge&quot; or &quot;Rama Setu&quot; (Sanskrit; &quot;setu&quot;: bridge) refers to the bridge built by the Vanara (ape men) army of Rama in Hindu mythology, which he used to reach Lanka and rescue his wife Sita from the demon king Ravana. The &quot;Ramayana&quot; attributes the building of this bridge to Rama in verse 2–22–76, naming it as Setubandhanam. The sea separating India and Sri Lanka is called Sethusamudram meaning &quot;Sea of the Bridge&quot;. Maps prepared by a Dutch cartographer in 1747 CE, available at the Tanjore Saraswathi Mahal Library show this area as &quot;Ramancoil&quot;, a colloquial form of the Tamil &quot;Raman Kovil&quot; (or Rama&#x27;s Temple). Many other maps in Schwartzberg&#x27;s historical atlas and other sources such as travel texts by Marco Polo call this area by various names such as &quot;Adam&#x27;s Bridge&quot;, &quot;Sethubandha&quot; and &quot;Sethubandha Rameswaram&quot;.

Rameswaram is an industrially backward town – there has been no demarcation for industrial land due to the pilgrim sanctity and ecological fragile geography. Being an island town, the traditional occupation was fishing, but due to poor returns, the people in fishing community have gradually shifted to other professions. Banks such as State Bank of India, Indian Bank, Union Bank of India and RDCC Bank have their branches in Rameswaram.

Pamban Bridge is a cantilever bridge on the Palk Strait that connects Rameswaram to mainland India. The railway bridge is and was opened to traffic in 1914. The railroad bridge is a double-leaf bascule bridge section that can be raised to let ships pass under it . The railway bridge historically carried metre-gauge trains on it, but Indian Railways upgraded the bridge to carry broad-gauge trains in a project that finished on 12 August 2007. Historically, the two leaves of the bridge were opened manually using levers by workers. About 10 ships – cargo carriers, coast guard ships, fishing vessels and oil tankers pass through the bridge every month. After completion of bridge, metre-gauge lines were laid from Mandapam up to Pamban Station, from where the railway lines bifurcated into two directions, one towards Rameswaram about up and another branch line of terminating at Dhanushkodi. The noted Boat Mail ran on this track between 1915 and 1964 from Chennai Egmore up to Dhanushkodi, from where the passengers were ferried to Talaimannar in Ceylon. The metre-gauge branch line from Pamban Junction to Dhanushkodi was abandoned after it was destroyed in a cyclone in 1964.

==Tourism==
The town is a famous Hindu pilgrimage centre, attracting the visit of thousands of devotees everyday. Adherents assemble to receive a &quot;darshana&quot; (auspicious sight) of the temple&#x27;s image of the deity Shiva, which is regarded to have been installed by Rama according to the regional legend&quot;.&quot;

===Ramanathaswamy Temple===
The Ramanathaswamy Temple is the most notable historic landmark of the town. Located in the centre of town, It is a famous Hindu temple dedicated to the deity Shiva. The temple is one of the 12 &quot;Jyotirlinga&quot; shrines, where Shiva is worshipped in the form of a &quot;Jyotirlinga,&quot; meaning &quot;pillar of light&quot;. It is also one of the 275 &quot;Paadal Petra Sthalam&quot; temples and is glorified in hymns by the three of the most revered Nayanar saints (7th century Saivite saints), Appar, Sundarar, and Tirugnana Sambandar. The temple in its current structure was built during the 12th century by Pandya Dynasty. The temple has the longest corridor among all Hindu temples in India. The breadth of these columned corridors varies from with a height of . Each pillar is sculpted in Nayak style as in Madurai Meenakshi Amman Temple. The contribution of the kings of the Sethupathy dynasty (17th century) to the temple was considerable. Large amount of money was spent during the tenure of Pradani Muthirulappa Pillai towards the restoration of the pagodas which were falling into ruins – the Chockattan Mantapam or the cloistered precincts of the temple was reconstructed by him. The rulers of Sri Lanka contributed to the temple – Parakrama Bahu (1153–1186 CE) was involved in the construction of the sanctum sanctorum of the temple. The eastern tower and shrine of Nataraja were built by Dalavai Sethupathy in 1649 CE. The second enclosure is ascribed to Chinna Udayar Sethupathy and his son Ragunatha Thirumalai (1500–1540 CE). The third enclosure was constructed by Muthu Ramalinga Sethupathy (1725–1771 CE) – his statue is located in the entrance of the corridor.

===Temple tanks===

There are sixty-four &quot;Tīrthas&quot; or &quot;Tirtham&quot;s (holy water bodies) in and around Rameswaram. According to the &quot;Skanda Purana&quot;, twenty-four of them are important. Of the 24, 14 are in the form of tanks and wells within the precincts of the temple. Bathing in these tanks is a major aspect of the pilgrimage to Rameswaram and is considered equivalent to penance. Twenty-two of the tanks are within the Ramanathaswamy Temple. The foremost one is called Agni Tirtham, the sea (Bay of Bengal). Jatayu, a vulture/eagle demigod, is believed to have fought in vain with the rakshasa-king Ravana to save Sita, and is said to have fallen down at Jatayu Tirtham, as his wings were severed. Villoondi Tirtham literally translates to &#x27;buried bow&#x27;, is located around from the main temple on the way to Pamban. It is believed to be the place where Rama quenched the thirst of Sita by dipping the bow into the sea water. Other major holy bodies are Hanuman Tirtham, Sugriva Tirtham, and Lakshmana Tirtham.

===Gandhamathana Parvatham===
Gandhamathan Parvatham, a hillock situated to the north of the temple is the highest point in the island. In a two-storeyed hall, Rama&#x27;s feet are venerated by adherents as an imprint on a &quot;chakra&quot; (wheel). The Ramarpatham Temple is located on the hillock.

===Dhanushkodi===
Dhanushkodi is the southernmost tip of the island and houses the Kothandaramaswamy Temple dedicated to Rama. Though Dhanushkodi was washed away during the 1964 cyclone, the temple alone remained intact. It is way from the centre of the town and can be reached by road. According to local tradition, Dhanushkodi is the site where Vibhishana, a brother of Ravana, surrendered to Rama in the epic &quot;Ramayana&quot;.

===Hindu pilgrimage===
Rameswaram is significant for many Hindus as a pilgrimage to Varanasi is considered to be incomplete without a pilgrimage to Rameswaram. The town along with the Ramanathaswamy temple is one of the holiest Hindu &quot;Char Dham&quot; (four divine sites) sites comprising Badrinath, Puri, and Dwarka. Though the origins are not clearly known, the Advaita school of Hinduism established by Sankaracharya, attributes the origin of Char Dham to the seer. The four monasteries are located across the four corners of India and their attendant temples are Badrinath Temple at Badrinath in the North, Jagannath Temple at Puri in the East, Dwarakadheesh Temple at Dwarka in the West and Ramanathaswamy Temple at Rameswaram in the South. Though ideologically the temples are divided between the sects of Hinduism, namely Shaivism and Vaishnavism, the Char Dham pilgrimage is an all Hindu affair. The journey across the four cardinal points in India is considered sacred by Hindus who aspire to visit these temples once in their lifetime. Traditionally, the trip starts at the eastern end from Puri, proceeding in clockwise direction in a manner typically followed for circuambulation in Hindu temples. The temple is one of the famous pilgrimage sites historically – the Maratha kings who ruled Thanjavur established &quot;chatrams&quot; or rest houses all through Mayiladuthurai and Rameswaram between 1745 and 1837 CE and donated them to the temple.

==Interaction with Sri Lanka==
Rameswaram is frequently in the headlines over fishermen issues like attack, arrest and alleged harassment by Sri Lankan navy for alleged cross border activities, Sethusamudram canal project, Kachchatheevu, Sri Lankan Tamil refugees and also on intercountry smuggling between India and Sri Lanka. As an initial step to curb enhanced smuggling, the Tamil Nadu government has set up 30 more marine police stations to bring the state&#x27;s entire coastal belt under close vigil.

===Sri Lankan Tamil refugees===
During the intense civil war of Sri Lanka, post 1980, Rameswaram acted as one of the focal points of smuggling and intense patrolling was carried out during the period. There are a total of 65,940 registered destitute Sri Lankan refugees dwelling in 129 refugee camps situated in different parts of Tamil Nadu, , and a majority of them enter via Rameswaram. There are an additional 20,667 non-camp refugees who entered via Rameswaram, registered in Mandapam transit camp and opted to reside outside the camps in various parts of Tamil Nadu. On 11 March 1990, a record number of 2,337 refugees in 38 boats arrived from Talaimannar in Sri Lanka to Rameswaram – this was the largest number of refugees arriving in a single day since the ethnic violence from July 1983. , an estimated 200,000 refugees have been reported in Mandapam Camp. Sivarasan, one of the mastermind behind the Assassination of Rajiv Gandhi, the ex-prime minister of India registered as refugee in Rameswaram camp on 12 September 1990.

===Rameswaram fishery===

Being an island, a significant population is involved in fishery traditionally. There have been incremental cases of Rameswaram fishermen allegedly killed or arrested by Sri Lankan navy along the maritime borders of India and Sri Lanka from the time of Sri Lankan civil war during 1983. In the face of simmering tension after the 1985 January Colombo bound Yaldevi train attack in which 22 Sri Lankan soldiers and 16 civilians were killed, Rameswaram fishermen dared to venture to seas spelling acute hardship for the 10,000 fishermen family. An estimated 381 fishermen have been killed in the sea due to shoot outs from 1983 to 2009. The Sri Lankan army attributed the killings to the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), but the casualty continues even after the end of LTTE in the region. The Tamil Nadu state government has increased the compensation of casualty from the original 100,000 to 500,000 (US$1,800 to $9,000). There has not been a single prosecution in any of the 381 killings committed so far from the Indian judiciary. The cases not being filed is attributed to the fact that people killed beyond the maritime boundary of India are not eligible for compensation and not many file complaints against the Sri Lankan navy. Though the Indian judiciary has provisions to prosecute foreigners, there is little progress due to the diplomatic overheads involved. Indian government has also ventured into the use of technology like use of Global Positioning System (GPS) by the fishermen and enabling cellphone blips to alert their mobile phones whenever they are crossing into Sri Lankan waters. The Sri Lankan navy has confirmed reports on Indian fishermen risking the international boundary due to depleted catch in Indian waters.

There is a yearly 45-day ban on fishery with motorboats in the region. The fishing ban for the year 2012 was effective during the months of April–May. The jetty at Rameswaram is the largest landing centre for fishing boats in the region and it usually comes alive after the ban, with the arrival of fishermen, boat captains, shore workers and others from their native places.

Sea World Aquarium is a natural habitat lying opposite to the Rameswaram Bus Stand, having an assortment of underwater creatures – it is the only one of its kind in the state, filled with such varied marine life forms including exotic species.

===Kachchatheevu===

Another focal point on the simmering tension between Indian and Sri Lankan governments is over the use of Kachchatheevu, an uninhabited island north of Rameswaram, belonging to Sri Lanka. The accord of 1974 allows fishermen of both the countries for resting and soaking the nets in the island. Repeated allegations on attacks by the Lankan navy, which on many occasions killed Indian fishermen, prevented them from making it to the island. The annual two-day Saint Anthony fest at the island draws huge number of people from the fishermen community of both the countries. The number of pilgrims for the 2012 function crossed 4,000, the largest attendance in the past two decades. The feast also provides an opportunity for the Indian fishermen to meet their Sri Lankan counterparts and exchange views on their mutual problems. The event served as a meeting point to find brides and grooms from both countries, but this practice has now been stopped from the 90s due to political constraint of fishermen family living in different countries.

===Sethusamudram Canal Project===

Sethusamudram Shipping Canal Project proposes linking the Palk Bay and the Gulf of Mannar between India and Sri Lanka by creating a shipping canal through the shallow sea sometimes called Setu Samudram, and through the chain of islands variously known as Ram Setu or the Rama&#x27;s Bridge. A few organisations are opposing the dredging of Rama Setu on religious, environmental and economical grounds. Many of these parties and organisations support implementation of this project using one of the five alternative alignments considered earlier without damaging the structure considered sacred by Hindus. With of dredging remaining, the project is held from March 2010 by a Supreme Court order seeking the Central Government to clarify the status of the bridge as a national monument.

<text>Jonathan Gregory Brandis (April 13, 1976 – November 12, 2003) was an American actor. Beginning his career as a child model, Brandis moved on to acting in commercials and subsequently won television and film roles. Brandis made his acting debut in 1982 as Kevin Buchanan on the soap opera &quot;One Life to Live&quot;. In 1990, he portrayed Bill Denbrough in the television miniseries &quot;It&quot;, and starred as Bastian Bux in &quot;The NeverEnding Story II: The Next Chapter&quot;. In 1993, at the age of 17, he was cast in the role of teen prodigy Lucas Wolenczak on the NBC series &quot;seaQuest DSV&quot;. The character was popular among teenage viewers, and Brandis regularly appeared in teen magazines. He died by suicide in 2003.

==Early life==
Jonathan Gregory Brandis was born in Danbury, Connecticut, the only child of Mary, a teacher and personal manager, and Gregory Brandis, a food distributor and firefighter. At the age of two, he began his career as a child model for Buster Brown shoes. At the age of four, Brandis began acting in television commercials. He attended San Fernando Valley Professional School, graduating in 1993.

==Career==

At age six, Brandis won the role of Kevin Buchanan on the soap opera &quot;One Life to Live&quot;. He moved to Los Angeles with his family at age nine and made guest appearances on shows such as &quot;Blossom&quot;; &quot;L.A. Law&quot;; &quot;Who&#x27;s the Boss?&quot;; &quot;Murder, She Wrote&quot;; &quot;The Wonder Years&quot;; &quot;Full House&quot;; &quot;Webster&quot; and &quot;Kate &amp; Allie&quot;.

At age 13, Brandis was cast in his first starring role as Bastian Bux in &quot;The NeverEnding Story II: The Next Chapter&quot;. He played the young &quot;Stuttering Bill&quot; Denbrough in the 1990 television miniseries &quot;Stephen King&#x27;s It&quot;, based on the epic horror novel of the same name. Brandis&#x27; performance in the miniseries was lauded by critics and audiences. Brandis was cast as the lead in two films made close together, first as Barry Gabrewski in &quot;Sidekicks&quot; and then starring as Matthew/Martha in &quot;Ladybugs&quot;.

Around age 17, Brandis landed one of his best-known roles, as scientific prodigy Lucas Wolenczak in Steven Spielberg&#x27;s futuristic science fiction series &quot;seaQuest DSV&quot;. The role propelled him into teen idol status. At the height of his popularity, Brandis received approximately 4,000 fan letters a week and had to be escorted onto the set of &quot;seaQuest DSV&quot; by three studio security guards because of the many female fans present. He voiced Mozenrath, an evil young sorcerer, in Disney&#x27;s animated series &quot;Aladdin&quot;.

After &quot;seaQuest DSV&quot; was canceled in 1996, Brandis appeared in the television film &quot;Her Last Chance&quot;. His next role was in the television film &quot;Born Free: A New Adventure,&quot; which was shot in South Africa. He continued his career in supporting roles in &quot;Outside Providence&quot; (1999) and &quot;Ride with the Devil&quot; (1999). In 2000, he costarred in &quot;Bad Girls from Valley High&quot;, which, because of distribution problems, was not released until 2005, two years after his death. Brandis had a small role in &quot;Hart&#x27;s War&quot; (2002). In 2003, he was cast in &quot;111 Gramercy Park&quot;, a pilot that was not picked up by the network. He made his final onscreen appearance in action drama &quot;Puerto Vallarta Squeeze&quot; in 2004. That film was also released posthumously. He was friends with fellow child actor Soleil Moon Frye and was featured in her 2021 documentary &quot;Kid 90&quot; which was culled from Frye&#x27;s extensive collection of home video footage shot during the 1990s.

==Personal life==
From 1995 to 2001, Brandis dated actress and singer Tatyana Ali. The then-couple appeared in an article in &quot;People&quot; magazine in July 1996.

==Death==
On November 11, 2003, Brandis was found hanged in the hallway of his Los Angeles apartment. He was transported to Cedars-Sinai Medical Center and died the following day of injuries sustained from the hanging. He was 27 years old. 

Brandis did not leave a suicide note. After his death, friends reported that he had been depressed about his extended career lull and was reportedly disappointed when his appearance in the 2002 war drama &quot;Hart&#x27;s War&quot;—a role he hoped would revive his career—was significantly reduced in the film&#x27;s final cut. Brandis began drinking heavily and said that he intended to kill himself.

In 2021, his father, Greg Brandis, noted that Jonathan was probably suffering from bipolar disorder. He told &quot;People&quot;, &quot;His death wasn&#x27;t due to the entertainment industry. I look back now, and in his 20s, he showed signs of manic depression. I hope that anyone suffering can go get help.&quot;

<doc id="373159" wikidata="Q1135534" url="?curid=373159" title="Izborsk">
<text>Izborsk (; ; ) is a rural locality (village) in Pechorsky District of Pskov Oblast, Russia. It contains one of the most ancient and impressive fortresses of Western Russia. The village lies to the west of Pskov and just to the east of the Russian-Estonian border.

==History==

According to the &quot;Russian Primary Chronicle&quot;, the town was the seat of Rurik&#x27;s brother Truvor from 862 to 864. Although his burial mound is still shown to occasional tourists, archaeological excavations of long barrows abounding in the vicinity did not reveal the presence of the Varangian settlement at the site, which indicates that Izborsk was an important centre of the early Krivichs.

The next mention of the town in Slavonic chronicles dates back to 1233, when the place was captured by the Livonian Brothers of the Sword. In 1330, the Pskov posadnik Sheloga constructed the Izborsk fortress on the top of Zheravya hill.

In 1348, the Pskov Republic, which included Izborsk, separated from Novgorod Republic. In 1399, it became a viceroyalty of Muscovy.

In the later 16th century, Izborsk was one of the smaller but strategically-important fortresses that protected the northwestern Russian borders from invasion. The fortress was supposed to be impregnable and so the seizure of it in 1569 by a small Lithuanian regiment came as such a shock to Ivan the Terrible. The relative ease and the suspicious circumstances of the seizure of the fortress deeply troubled the already-paranoid Ivan. In the dead of night, Teterin, a Russian turncoat disguised as an &quot;oprichnik&quot;, ordered the gates of the town be opened in the name of the &quot;oprichnina&quot;, which allowed the enemy regiment to enter and overtake the fortress (the town of Izborsk, however, was never listed as territory in which &quot;oprichnina&quot; governance applied).

Though Ivan managed to retake the city with little difficulty, the treachery and the conspiracy involved in the original seizure led him to order the executions of the assistant crown secretaries of Izborsk, as well as the secretaries of the surrounding fortresses. With rumours of disaffection and growing discontent throughout the country on the rise, Ivan feared that other cities would soon follow the treasonous example of Izborsk. The proximity of the town to the cities of Novgorod and Pskov, coupled with the questionable implication of Novgorod&#x27;s chancery administration in Teterin&#x27;s plot, threw suspicion of treachery and defection onto the already-distrusted city.

During the Siege of Pskov (1581), Izborsk was captured by the Lithuanian troops, but after the Truce of Yam-Zapolsky (1582) handed over to the Tsardom of Russia.

After the Great Northern War, Izborsk ceased to be a western borderline fortress of Russian. In 1708, it joined the newly-established Governorate of Saint-Petersburg (until 1710 called Ingermanland Governorate), where it was listed as the centre of uyezd in the Pskov Province. In 1727, all of Pskov Province was transferred to the Novgorod Governorate and was later transformed into a part of the larger Pskov Governorate, where Izborsk was listed as a town until 1920.

In 1920, according to the Treaty of Tartu, the Russian–Estonian state boundary went east of Izborsk and so the town became part of Estonia. From 1940 to 1945, the town remained within the Estonian SSR (1941–1944 under Nazi occupation).

In 1945, the Russian-Estonian border was redefined to resemble the pre-1918 borders between the Livonia and Pskov Governorate, leaving Izborsk with the Pskov Oblast of the Russian SFSR, now the Russian Federation.

== Fortress ==
Truvor&#x27;s gorodishche is a settlement about half a kilometer north from the fortress that came about in the late 7th and early 8th century, and proceeded to grow twice in size in the 10th and 11th centuries. It was the predecessor of the Izborsk Fortress, protected by an oakwood wall which was later upgraded to stone, 3 meters in height by 3 meters in width in the 12th century.

To accommodate a larger capacity, the Izborsk Fortress was moved to its present location on the summit of Zheravya (&quot;Crane&quot;) Hill in the year 1303, and the Lukovka Tower was built from stone on the outer edge, standing at 13 meters in height, and 9.5 meters in diameter.

First wooden fortress on the current site was built in early XIV century. The most ancient extant structure is the Tower Lukovka (literally, &quot;Onion Tower&quot;). At that time it was the only stone building west of Pskov and adjoined a wooden wall. The walls surrounding the fortress were modified from wood to stone soon after, in 1330. After seven other stone towers and the new stone wall were completed, Lukovka became a watch-tower and an armory. The Nativity church within the fortress was built in the 16th century.

The walls were yet again thickened in the 15th and 16th centuries, and the towers were now compatible with cannons. The side that was most prone to attack was designed thicker than the others, at 5 meters in width, while the rest range from 2.5 to 3.7 meters. The towers were built at a maximum of 60 meters apart for reinforcement.

There were two entrances to the fortress, both constructed with a barbican. The Nikolski gate, which is the larger of the two, has an inner gate with a tower and a portcullis, and is 90 meters long and 5 meters wide. The Talavski entrance is 36 meters long and 4 meters wide. The fortress&#x27; southeast side was equipped an underground stone hallway that provided access to a spring well.

Early XVIII century the fortress lost its borderline status and was abandoned. Due to the inclement weather and climate of the region, the fortress faced deterioration. First renovations of the deserted fortress were carried out in 1842 after the order approved by Nicolas I.

Recent restoration of the fortress, completed in 2012, was accompanied by gross embezzlement of money, and the fortress was severely damaged. On 15 March 2016, Grigory Pirumov, deputy minister of culture of Russia, and two other offices of the Ministry of Culture, were arrested on criminal charges related to the embezzlement. The repair and archaeological works are still in process.

Near the fortress there is a museum of stone crosses.

Though Truvor&#x27;s gorodishche is mostly destroyed, a small part of the wall remains today.

In 2002, the Izborsk Fortress was nominated to be a part of Russia&#x27;s World Heritage Tentative List.

<doc id="373164" wikidata="Q5100831" url="?curid=373164" title="Chinese linking rings">
<text>The Chinese linking rings is a classic of illusion magic in which solid metal rings appear to link and unlink, pass through each other, and form chains and other complex patterns and configurations. The rings may even be handed out to audience members for examination. Sometimes an audience member is invited onto the stage to perform alongside the magician as part of a &quot;do as I do&quot; routine.

==History==

Chinese stage magician Ching Ling Foo (1854–1922) was one of the early performers of the linking rings in the form known today. A painting by Giacomo Mantegazza in 1876 showed a harem girl holding a set of rings above her head. Speculation about the rings&#x27; origin has been traced to Turkey, Egypt and the Middle East and as long ago as the 1st century.

French magician Philippe (Jacques Andre Noel Talon) was one of the first magicians reported to use the rings. During the second half of his show, he donned an Oriental robe and conical cap. He took solid metal rings and had the audience examine them. He claimed that he learned them from a troupe of Chinese jugglers in Britain. After the rings were returned, Philippe proceeded to link and unlink them. From there, he combined glittering circles into complicated designs. According to Robert-Houdin, he said that for a finale, Philippe blew on them and they fell separately on the floor. Robert-Houdin also performed a version of the trick, as did the magician Chung Ling Soo.

In the May 2016 issue of Genii (magazine), world-famous mentalist and respected magic historian Max Maven penned a seminal article about a rare Japanese book called Hokasen that featured a routine called “The Iron Rings”. As this text was published in 1764, it is widely believed to be the earliest known written explanation of the linking rings. Maven also goes on to explain why the Japanese dubbed the rings as “Chinese”.

Recent magicians who are known for their performances with the linking rings include Dai Vernon, Richard Ross, Jack Miller, Michael Skinner, Ian Ray - &quot;The Genie Ali Pali&quot;, Jeff McBride, Paul W Draper, Shoot Ogawa, Fu Manchu, Tina Lenert, Fábio De&#x27;Rose, Jim Cellini, Chris Capeheart, Tom Frank, Galina, Whit Haydn, Paul Daniels, and Jay Marshall. Christian Bale&#x27;s character, Alfred Borden, performs the trick in &quot;The Prestige&quot;. The number of rings used can vary from two to ten, or more. A standard set of commercially available rings typically includes eight rings.

In 1988, Japanese magician Masahiro Yanagida performed with miniature Ninja rings, using four rings that were four and a half inches (or 11.43 cm) in diameter. Since then, the Chinese linking rings have also become a favourite performance item for close-up magicians.

==Rings==
A quality set of eight linking rings can be obtained from a supplier of magic props. Most consider rings to be the smallest size suited for stage performance, while rings are common; rings are also available, but rarely seen in use. Larger sizes are often constructed from stainless steel tubing for the best combination of durability and weight. Professionals may wish to have a set of larger-diameter rings for use on a stage, or a &quot;close-up&quot; set of rings in the range.

Many magicians look for rings that make a nice ringing tone when they strike each other.

<doc id="373165" wikidata="Q5038627" url="?curid=373165" title="Cardinal assignment">
<text>In set theory, the concept of cardinality is significantly developable without recourse to actually defining cardinal numbers as objects in the theory itself (this is in fact a viewpoint taken by Frege; Frege cardinals are basically equivalence classes on the entire universe of sets, by equinumerosity). The concepts are developed by defining equinumerosity in terms of functions and the concepts of one-to-one and onto (injectivity and surjectivity); this gives us a quasi-ordering relation

:formula_1

on the whole universe by size. It is not a true partial ordering because antisymmetry need not hold: if both formula_2 and formula_3, it is true by the Cantor–Bernstein–Schroeder theorem that formula_4 i.e. &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; are equinumerous, but they do not have to be literally equal (see isomorphism). That at least one of formula_2 and formula_3 holds turns out to be equivalent to the axiom of choice.

Nevertheless, most of the &quot;interesting&quot; results on cardinality and its arithmetic can be expressed merely with =c.

The goal of a cardinal assignment is to assign to every set &quot;A&quot; a specific, unique &quot;set&quot; that is only dependent on the cardinality of &quot;A&quot;. This is in accordance with Cantor&#x27;s original vision of cardinals: to take a set and abstract its elements into canonical &quot;units&quot; and collect these units into another set, such that the only thing special about this set is its size. These would be totally ordered by the relation formula_7, and =c would be true equality. As Y. N. Moschovakis says, however, this is mostly an exercise in mathematical elegance, and you don&#x27;t gain much unless you are &quot;allergic to subscripts.&quot; However, there are various valuable applications of &quot;real&quot; cardinal numbers in various models of set theory.

In modern set theory, we usually use the Von Neumann cardinal assignment, which uses the theory of ordinal numbers and the full power of the axioms of choice and replacement. Cardinal assignments do need the full axiom of choice, if we want a decent cardinal arithmetic and an assignment for &quot;all&quot; sets.

== Cardinal assignment without the axiom of choice ==

Formally, assuming the axiom of choice, the cardinality of a set &quot;X&quot; is the least ordinal &quot;α&quot; such that there is a bijection between &quot;X&quot; and &quot;α&quot;. This definition is known as the von Neumann cardinal assignment. If the axiom of choice is not assumed we need to do something different. The oldest definition of the cardinality of a set &quot;X&quot; (implicit in Cantor and explicit in Frege and &quot;Principia Mathematica&quot;) is as the set of all sets that are equinumerous with &quot;X&quot;: this does not work in ZFC or other related systems of axiomatic set theory because this collection is too large to be a set, but it does work in type theory and in New Foundations and related systems. However, if we restrict from this class to those equinumerous with &quot;X&quot; that have the least rank, then it will work (this is a trick due to Dana Scott: it works because the collection of objects with any given rank is a set; see Scott&#x27;s trick).

<text>Ramona is an 1884 American novel written by Helen Hunt Jackson. Set in Southern California after the Mexican–American War and annexation of the territory by the United States, &quot;Ramona&quot; explores the life of a mixed-race Scottish–Native American orphan girl. The story was inspired by the marriage of Hugo Reid and Victoria Reid. 

Originally serialized weekly in the &quot;Christian Union&quot;, the novel became immensely popular. It has had more than 300 printings, and has been adapted five times as a film. A play adaptation has been performed annually outdoors since 1923.

The novel&#x27;s influence on the culture and image of Southern California was considerable. Its sentimental portrayal of Mexican elite colonial life contributed to establishing a unique cultural identity for the region. As its publication coincided with the arrival of railroad lines in the region, tourists used trains to visit sites thought to be associated with the novel.

==Plot==
In Southern California, shortly after the Mexican–American War, a Scottish-Native American orphan girl, Ramona, is raised by Señora Gonzaga Moreno, the sister of Ramona&#x27;s deceased foster mother. Ramona is referred to as illegitimate in some summaries of the novel, but chapter 3 of the novel says that Ramona&#x27;s parents were married by a priest in the San Gabriel Mission. Señora Moreno has raised Ramona as part of the family, giving her every luxury. Ramona&#x27;s foster mother had requested this as her dying wish. Because Ramona has partial Native American heritage, Moreno reserves her love for her only child, Felipe Moreno, whom she adores. Señora Moreno identifies as Mexican of pure Spanish ancestry. She hates Americans since the United States annexation of California following its victory in the war. They have disputed her claim to her lands, and have divided her huge &quot;rancho&quot;. 

Señora Moreno delays the sheep shearing, a major event on the rancho, awaiting the arrival of a group of Native Americans from Temecula, whom she always hires for that work. The head of the Native American sheep shearers is Alessandro, son of Pablo Assís, chief of the tribe. Alessandro is portrayed as tall, wise, honest, and piously Catholic. Señora Moreno also awaits a priest, Father Salvierderra, from Santa Barbara. He will hear confessions of the workers and celebrate mass with them in her chapel after the shearing, before they return to Temecula.

Alessandro quickly falls in love with Ramona and agrees to stay on at the Rancho. In time, Ramona also falls in love with Alessandro. Señora Moreno opposes the marriage, as she does not want Ramona to marry a Native American. Realizing that Señora Moreno has never loved her, Ramona elopes with Alessandro. 

The rest of the novel charts the two lovers&#x27; troubles. They have a daughter, and travel around Southern California trying to find a place to settle. In the aftermath of war, Alessandro&#x27;s tribe is driven off their land, marking a new wave of European-American settlement in California from the United States. They endure misery and hardship, for the Americans who buy their land also demand their houses and their farm tools. Greedy Americans drive them off several homesteads, and they cannot find a permanent community that is not threatened by encroachment of American settlers. They finally move into the San Bernardino Mountains. 

Alessandro slowly loses his mind, due to the forced relocations. He loves Ramona fiercely, and regrets having taken her away from relative comfort with Moreno. Their daughter, whose Native American name means &quot;Eyes of the Sky&quot;, dies because an American doctor would not go to their homestead to treat her. They have another daughter, whom they name Ramona, but Alessandro still suffers. One day he rides off with the horse of an American, who follows him and shoots him, although he knew that Alessandro was mentally unbalanced.

After being away from the Moreno ranch for two years, the young widow is found by Felipe Moreno. He brings her and her daughter Ramona back to his mother&#x27;s estate. Felipe has always loved the senior Ramona and finds her more beautiful than ever. Although Ramona still loves the late Alessandro, she agrees to marry Felipe. (His mother has died, so he is free to marry his choice.) They have several children together. Their favorite is Ramona, daughter of Alessandro.

==Main characters==

*Father Salvierderra, a Catholic priest

==Major themes==

Jackson wrote &quot;Ramona&quot; three years after &quot;A Century of Dishonor&quot;, her non-fiction study of the mistreatment of Native Americans in the United States. By following that history with a novel, she sought to portray the Indian experience &quot;in a way to move people&#x27;s hearts.&quot; She wanted to arouse public opinion and concern for the betterment of their plight, much as Harriet Beecher Stowe&#x27;s novel &quot;Uncle Tom&#x27;s Cabin&quot; had done for enslaved African Americans. Her success in this effort was limited.

Jackson intended &quot;Ramona&quot; to appeal directly to the reader&#x27;s emotions. The novel&#x27;s political criticism was clear, but most readers were moved by its romantic vision of colonial California under Mexican rule. Jackson had become enamored of the Spanish missions in California, which she romanticized. The story&#x27;s fictional vision of Franciscan churchmen, &quot;señoritas&quot; and &quot;caballeros&quot; permeated the novel and captured the imaginations of readers. Her novel characterized the Americans as villains and the Native Americans as &quot;noble savages&quot;.

Many American migrants to California were biased against the Mexicans who lived there. The new settlers from northern and midwestern states disparaged what they considered a decadent culture of leisure and recreation among the elite Latinos, who held huge tracts of land, lived in a region with prevailing mild weather and unusually fertile soil, and relied heavily on Native American laborers. The new settlers favored the Protestant work ethic. This view was not universal, however. 

Many American settlers and readers in other regions were taken by Jackson&#x27;s portrayal of the California-Mexican society. Readers accepted the Californio aristocracy as portrayed and the &quot;Ramona&quot; myth was born.

==Reception==
&quot;Ramona&quot; was immensely popular almost immediately upon its publication in 1884, with more than 15,000 copies sold in the ten months before Jackson&#x27;s death in 1885. One year after her death, the &quot;North American Review&quot; called it &quot;unquestionably the best novel yet produced by an American woman&quot; and named it, along with &quot;Uncle Tom&#x27;s Cabin&quot;, as one of two most ethical novels of the 19th century. By sixty years after its publication, 600,000 copies had been sold. There have been more than 300 reissues to date and the book has never been out of print.

Subtle racism may have contributed to the popularity of the character of Ramona and the novel. Of mixed race, she was described as beautiful, with black hair and blue eyes. Errol Wayne Stevens, of the California Historical Society, notes several contemporary reviews of the novel in which writers dismissed the idea that Ramona could have been part Native American, a race which they characterized as &quot;dull, heavy and unimpressionable,&quot; and &quot;lazy, cruel, cowardly, and covetous.&quot;

Carobeth Laird, in her 1975 autobiography, &quot;Encounter with an Angry God&quot; (p. 176), describes the reaction of her Chemehuevi Indian husband to the novel: &quot;... when I tried to read him Helen Hunt Jackson&#x27;s &quot;Ramona&quot;, he grew restless, walked up and down, and finally said that the white woman knew nothing about Indians.&quot;

Jackson was disappointed that she was unable to raise public concerns about the struggles of Indians in California, as readers were attracted to the romantic vision of Californio society. Historian Antoinette May argues in her book &quot;The Annotated Ramona&quot; (1989), that the popularity of the novel contributed to Congress passing the Dawes Act in 1887. This was the first American law to address Indian land rights but was aimed at assimilation of Indian families. It forced the breakup of communal lands and redistribution of allotted acres to individual households. The government defined as &quot;surplus land&quot; any reservation territory remaining, and allowed its sale to non-Native persons.

==Cultural influence==


The widespread popularity of the novel resulted in jurisdictions naming schools (Ramona High School in Riverside), streets, freeways (the San Bernardino Freeway was originally named the Ramona Freeway) and towns (unincorporated communities called Ramona in both Los Angeles and San Diego County) after the novel&#x27;s heroine. Southern California became a tourist destination, as many people wanted to see the locations featured in the book. Its publication coincided with the opening of Southern Pacific Railroad&#x27;s Southern California rail lines, which fed a tourism boom.

As a result, many sites across Southern California tried to emphasize their &quot;Ramona&quot; connections. Jackson died without having specified locations for her novel. Two places claimed to have inspired her work: Rancho Camulos, near Piru, and Rancho Guajome in Vista, as she had visited both before writing her novel.

Camulos became the most accepted &quot;Home of Ramona&quot; due to several factors. The description of Moreno Ranch is similar to the historic Rancho Camulos. Influential writers, such as George Wharton James and Charles Fletcher Lummis, avowed that it was so. When the Southern Pacific Railroad opened its main Ventura County line in 1887, it had a stop at Camulos. With the company engaged in a rate war, the trip to Camulos became relatively easy and affordable for visitors. Finally, the Del Valle family of Camulos welcomed tourists: they exploited the association in marketing their products, labeling their oranges and wine as &quot;The Home of Ramona&quot; brand.

In contrast, Guajome did not publicly become associated with &quot;Ramona&quot; until an 1894 article in &quot;Rural Californian&quot; made the claim. However, as the house was nearly four miles (6 km) from the nearest Santa Fe Railroad station, getting there was not so easy. Additionally, the Couts family, who owned the property, were not eager to have flocks of tourists on the grounds, possibly due to a falling out between author Jackson and Senora Couts.

Estudillo House in Old Town San Diego identified as &quot;Ramona&#x27;s Marriage Place&quot;; the novel said briefly that Ramona was married in San Diego. Although no record existed of Jackson&#x27;s having visited there, this house became a popular tourist destination. This status continued for years. Estudillo House was unique in marketing solely in terms of &quot;Ramona&quot;-related tourism. The caretaker sold pieces of the house to tourists, which hastened its deterioration. In 1907, the new owner John D. Spreckels hired architect Hazel Wood Waterman to remodel the house to more closely match descriptions in the novel. When the reconstruction was completed in 1910, the building reopened as a full-fledged &quot;Ramona&quot; tourist attraction. Estudillo House&#x27;s application for National Historic Landmark status was entitled &quot;Casa Estudillo/Ramona&#x27;s Marriage Place&quot;.

Other notable &quot;Ramona&quot; landmarks included &quot;Ramona&#x27;s Birthplace&quot;, a small adobe near Mission San Gabriel Arcángel, and the grave of Ramona Lubo on the Ramona Band of Cahuilla Indians reservation. Writer George Wharton James called Lubo the &quot;real Ramona&quot;. Her life bore some resemblance to that of the fictional Ramona. Sixteen years after Lubo&#x27;s death, in 1938 local people erected a &quot;Ramona monument&quot; at her gravesite. 

&quot;The Ramona Pageant&quot; was a play adapted from the novel. It was staged outdoors, beginning in 1923 in Hemet. The pageant has been held there annually since.

Most historians believe that the fictional Moreno Ranch is an amalgamation of various locations and was not intended to represent a single place. As Carey McWilliams said in his book &quot;Southern California Country&quot; (1946):
:Picture postcards, by the tens of thousands, were published showing &quot;the schools attended by Ramona,&quot; &quot;the original of Ramona,&quot; &quot;the place where Ramona was married,&quot; and various shots of the &quot;Ramona Country.&quot; [...] It was not long before the scenic postcards depicting the Ramona Country had come to embrace all of Southern California.

Because of the novel&#x27;s extraordinary popularity, public perception merged fact and fiction. California historian Walton Bean wrote:
:These legends became so ingrained in the culture of Southern California that they were often mistaken for realities. In later years many who visited &quot;Ramona&#x27;s birthplace&quot; in San Diego or the annual &quot;Ramona Pageant&quot; at Hemet (eighty miles north of San Diego) were surprised and disappointed if they chanced to learn that Ramona was a (fictional) novel rather than a biography.

The novel contributed to the unique cultural identity of Southern California and the whole of the Southwest. The architecture of the missions had recently gained national exposure and local restoration projects were just beginning. Railroad lines to Southern California were just opening and, combined with the emotions stirred by the novel, the region suddenly gained national attention. Mission Revival Style architecture became popular from about 1890 to 1915. Many examples still stand throughout California and other southwest areas.

==Adaptations==
&quot;Ramona&quot; has been adapted several times for other media. The first was a silent film by the same name, released in 1910. It was directed by D. W. Griffith and starred Mary Pickford. Other versions were made in 1928, 1936 and 1946.

<doc id="373172" wikidata="Q213376" url="?curid=373172" title="Winemaking">
<text>Winemaking, wine-making, or vinification is the production of wine, starting with the selection of the fruit, its fermentation into alcohol, and the bottling of the finished liquid. The history of wine-making stretches over millennia. There is evidence that suggests that the earliest wine production took place in Georgia and Iran around 6000 to 5000 B.C. The science of wine and winemaking is known as oenology. A winemaker may also be called a vintner. The growing of grapes is viticulture and there are many varieties of grapes.

Winemaking can be divided into two general categories: still wine production (without carbonation) and sparkling wine production (with carbonation – natural or injected). Red wine, white wine, and rosé are the other main categories. Although most wine is made from grapes, it may also be made from other plants. (See fruit wine.) Other similar light alcoholic drinks (as opposed to beer or spirits) include mead, made by fermenting honey and water, cider (&quot;apple cider&quot;), made by fermenting the juice of apples, and perry (&quot;pear cider&quot;), made by fermenting the juice of pears, and kumis, made of fermented mare&#x27;s milk.

== Process ==
There are five basic stages to the wine making process which begins with harvesting or picking. After the harvest, the grapes are taken into a winery and prepared for primary ferment; at this stage red wine making diverges from white wine making.
Red wine is made from the must (pulp, including the juice) of red or black grapes and fermentation occurs together with the grape skins, which impart color, flavor and tannins to the wine through the process of maceration. White wine is made by fermenting juice which is made by pressing crushed grapes to extract a juice; the skins are removed and play no further role. Occasionally, white wine is made from red grapes. This is done by extracting their juice with minimal contact with the grapes&#x27; skins.
Rosé wines are either made from red grapes where the juice is allowed to stay in contact with the dark skins long enough to pick up a pinkish color (maceration or saignée), or (less commonly) by blending red wine with white wine. White and rosé wines extract little of the grape tannins contained in the skins. Orange wine (a.k.a. skin-contact white wine) is wine made with maceration in the manner of rosé or red wine production, but using white wine grape varieties instead of red. 

To start primary fermentation, yeast may be added to the must for red wine, or may occur naturally as ambient yeast on the grapes (or in the air). For white wine, yeast may be added to the juice. During this fermentation, which often takes between one and two weeks, the yeast converts most of the sugars in the grape juice into ethanol (alcohol) and carbon dioxide (which is lost to the atmosphere).

After the primary fermentation of red grapes, the free run wine is pumped off into tanks and the skins are pressed to extract the remaining juice and wine. The press wine is blended with the free run wine at the winemaker&#x27;s discretion. The wine is then kept warm and the remaining sugars are converted into alcohol and carbon dioxide.

The next process in the making of red wine is malolactic conversion, a bacterial process which converts &quot;crisp, green apple&quot; malic acid to &quot;soft, creamy&quot; lactic acid, softening the taste of the wine. Red wine is characteristically transferred to white oak barrels to mature for a period of weeks or months; this practice imparts oak aromas and some oak tannins to the wine. The wine must be settled or clarified and adjustments made prior to bottling.

The time from harvest to drinking can vary from a few months for Beaujolais nouveau wines (made by carbonic maceration) to over twenty years for wine of good structure with high levels of acid, tannin or sugar. However, only about 10% of all red and 5% of white wine will taste better after five years than it will after just one year. Depending on the quality of grape and the target wine style, some of these steps may be combined or omitted to achieve the particular goals of the winemaker. Many wines of comparable quality are produced using similar but distinctly different approaches to their production.

Variations on the above procedure exist. With sparkling wines such as Champagne and Methodé Champenoise (sparkling wine that is fermented in the style of champagne but is not from the Champagne region of France), an additional, &quot;secondary&quot; fermentation takes place inside the bottle, dissolving trapped carbon dioxide in the wine and creating the characteristic bubbles. Bottles then spend 6 months on a riddling rack before being disgorged to remove any sediment that has accrued. An expedited technique using sealed tanks to contain carbon dioxide is known as the bulk Charmat method. Other sparkling wines, such as prosecco, are fermented using force-carbonation — a faster process that involves using machinery to manually add CO2 and create bubbles. Sweet wines or off-dry wines are made by arresting fermentation before all sugar has been converted into ethanol and allowing some residual sugar to remain. This can be done by chilling the wine and adding sulphur and other allowable additives to inhibit yeast activity, or sterile filtering the wine to remove all yeast and bacteria. In the case of sweet wines, initial sugar concentrations are increased by harvesting late (late harvest wine), freezing the grapes to concentrate the sugar (ice wine), allowing or encouraging &quot;Botrytis cinerea&quot; fungus to dehydrate the grapes or allowing the grapes to raisin either on the vine or on racks or straw mats. Often in these high sugar wines, the fermentation stops naturally as the high concentration of sugar and rising concentration of ethanol retard the yeast activity. Similarly in fortified wines, such as port wine, high proof neutral grape spirit (brandy) is added to arrest the ferment and adjust the alcohol content when the desired sugar level has been reached. In other cases, the winemaker may choose to hold back some of the sweet grape juice and add it to the wine after the fermentation is done, a technique known in Germany as süssreserve.

The process produces wastewater, pomace, and lees that require collection, treatment, and disposal or beneficial use.

Synthetic wines (also known as engineered wines or fake wines) are a product that do not use grapes at all. Starting with water and ethanol, a number of additives are included, such as acids, amino acids, sugars, and organic compounds.

== The grapes ==

The quality of the grapes determines the quality of the wine more than any other factor. Grape quality is affected by variety as well as weather during the growing season, soil minerals and acidity, time of harvest, and pruning method. The combination of these effects is often referred to as the grape&#x27;s &quot;terroir&quot;. Given the sensitivity of grapes to weather patterns, winemaking is affected by climate change.

Grapes are usually harvested from the vineyard from early September until early November in the northern hemisphere, and mid February until early March in the southern hemisphere. In some cool areas in the southern hemisphere (such as in Tasmania), harvesting extends into May.

The most common species of wine grape is Vitis vinifera, which includes nearly all varieties of European origin.

== Harvesting and destemming ==

Harvest is the picking of the grapes and in many ways the first step in wine production. Grapes are either harvested mechanically or by hand. The decision to harvest grapes is typically made by the winemaker and informed by the level of sugar (called °Brix), acid (TA or Titratable Acidity as expressed by tartaric acid equivalents) and pH of the grapes. Other considerations include phenological ripeness, berry flavor, tannin development (seed color and taste). Overall disposition of the grapevine and weather forecasts are taken into account.

Mechanical harvesters are large tractors that straddle grapevine trellises and, using firm plastic or rubber rods, strike the fruiting zone of the grapevine to dislodge the grapes from the rachis. Mechanical harvesters have the advantage of being able to cover a large area of vineyard land in a relatively short period of time, and with a minimum investment of manpower per harvested ton. A disadvantage of mechanical harvesting is the indiscriminate inclusion of foreign non-grape material in the product, especially leaf stems and leaves, but also, depending on the trellis system and grapevine canopy management, may include moldy grapes, canes, metal debris, rocks and even small animals and bird nests. Some winemakers remove leaves and loose debris from the grapevine before mechanical harvesting to avoid such material being included in the harvested fruit. In the United States mechanical harvesting is seldom used for premium winemaking because of the indiscriminate picking and increased oxidation of the grape juice. In other countries (such as Australia and New Zealand), mechanical harvesting of premium winegrapes is more common because of general labor shortages.
Manual harvesting is the hand-picking of grape clusters from the grapevines. In the United States, some grapes are picked into one- or two-ton bins for transport back to the winery. Manual harvesting has the advantage of using knowledgeable labor to not only pick the ripe clusters but also to leave behind the clusters that are not ripe or contain bunch rot or other defects. This can be an effective first line of defense to prevent inferior quality fruit from contaminating a lot or tank of wine.
Destemming is the process of separating stems from the grapes. Depending on the winemaking procedure, this process may be undertaken before crushing with the purpose of lowering the development of tannins and vegetal flavors in the resulting wine. Single berry harvesting, as is done with some German Trockenbeerenauslese, avoids this step altogether with the grapes being individually selected.

== Crushing and primary (alcoholic) fermentation ==


Crushing is the process when gently squeezing the berries and breaking the skins to start to liberate the contents of the berries. Destemming is the process of removing the grapes from the rachis (the stem which holds the grapes). In traditional and smaller-scale wine making, the harvested grapes are sometimes crushed by trampling them barefoot or by the use of inexpensive small scale crushers. These can also destem at the same time. However, in larger wineries, a mechanical crusher/destemmer is used.
The decision about destemming is different for red and white wine making. Generally when making white wine the fruit is only crushed, the stems are then placed in the press with the berries. The presence of stems in the mix facilitates pressing by allowing juice to flow past flattened skins. These accumulate at the edge of the press.
For red winemaking, stems of the grapes are usually removed before fermentation since the stems have a relatively high tannin content; in addition to tannin they can also give the wine a vegetal aroma (due to extraction of 3-isobutyl-2-methoxypyrazine which has an aroma reminiscent of green bell peppers). On occasion, the winemaker may decide to leave them in if the grapes themselves contain less tannin than desired. This is more acceptable if the stems have &#x27;ripened&#x27; and started to turn brown.
If increased skin extraction is desired, a winemaker might choose to crush the grapes after destemming. Removal of stems first means no stem tannin can be extracted. In these cases the grapes pass between two rollers which squeeze the grapes enough to separate the skin and pulp, but not so much as to cause excessive shearing or tearing of the skin tissues. In some cases, notably with &quot;delicate&quot; red varietals such as Pinot noir or Syrah, all or part of the grapes might be left uncrushed (called &quot;whole berry&quot;) to encourage the retention of fruity aromas through partial carbonic maceration.
Most red wines derive their color from grape skins (the exception being varieties or hybrids of non-vinifera vines which contain juice pigmented with the dark Malvidin 3,5-diglucoside anthocyanin) and therefore contact between the juice and skins is essential for color extraction.
Red wines are produced by destemming and crushing the grapes into a tank and leaving the skins in contact with the juice throughout the fermentation (maceration). It is possible to produce white (colorless) wines from red grapes by the fastidious pressing of uncrushed fruit. This minimizes contact between grape juice and skins (as in the making of &quot;Blanc de noirs&quot; sparkling wine, which is derived from Pinot noir, a red vinifera grape).

An alternative method to maceration is hot press or thermovinification. In this practice, winemakers heat up the grapes to extract the juice rather than pressing using a pressure method. The temperature and time ranges depending on the grape variety and preferences of the winemaker. In addition to extracting the juice, this method is sometimes referred to as pre-fermentation maceration as it extracts tannins and pigment from the skins. As a result this is applicable to red grape varieties that would otherwise undergo traditional maceration.

Most white wines are processed without destemming or crushing and are transferred from picking bins directly to the press. This is to avoid any extraction of tannin from either the skins or grapeseeds, as well as maintaining proper juice flow through a matrix of grape clusters rather than loose berries. In some circumstances winemakers choose to crush white grapes for a short period of skin contact, usually for three to 24 hours. This serves to extract flavor and tannin from the skins (the tannin being extracted to encourage protein precipitation without excessive Bentonite addition) as well as potassium ions, which participate in bitartrate precipitation (cream of tartar). It also results in an increase in the pH of the juice which may be desirable for overly acidic grapes. This was a practice more common in the 1970s than today, though still practiced by some Sauvignon blanc and Chardonnay producers in California.

In the case of rosé wines, the fruit is crushed and the dark skins are left in contact with the juice just long enough to extract the color that the winemaker desires. The must is then pressed, and fermentation continues as if the winemaker was making a white wine.

Yeast is normally already present on the grapes, often visible as a powdery appearance of the grapes. The primary, or alcoholic fermentation can be done with this natural yeast, but since this can give unpredictable results depending on the exact types of yeast that are present, cultured yeast is often added to the must. One of the main problems with the use of wild ferments is the failure for the fermentation to go to completion, that is some sugar remains unfermented. This can make the wine sweet when a dry wine is desired. Frequently wild ferments lead to the production of unpleasant acetic acid (vinegar) production as a by product.
During the primary fermentation, the yeast cells feed on the sugars in the must and multiply, producing carbon dioxide gas and alcohol. The temperature during the fermentation affects both the taste of the end product, as well as the speed of the fermentation. For red wines, the temperature is typically 22 to 25 °C, and for white wines 15 to 18 °C.
For every gram of sugar that is converted, about half a gram of alcohol is produced, so to achieve a 12% alcohol concentration, the must should contain about 24% sugars. The sugar percentage of the must is calculated from the measured density, the must weight, with the help of a specialized type of hydrometer called a saccharometer. If the sugar content of the grapes is too low to obtain the desired alcohol percentage, sugar can be added (chaptalization). In commercial winemaking, chaptalization is subject to local regulations.

Similar to chaptalization is amelioration. While chaptalization aims to raise final alcohol percentage through the addition of sugar, amelioration aims to raise the alcohol percentage and dilute the acidity levels through the addition of water and sugar into the grape must. This wine adjustment was commonly used in New York State&#x27;s cooler wine regions, such as the Finger Lakes AVA. Amelioration is also subject to federal regulations.

Alcohol of more than 12% can be achieved by using yeast that can withstand high alcohol. Some yeasts can produce 18% alcohol in the wine however extra sugar is added to produce a high alcohol content.

During or after the alcoholic fermentation, a secondary, or malolactic fermentation can also take place, during which specific strains of bacteria (lactobacter) convert malic acid into the milder lactic acid. This fermentation is often initiated by inoculation with desired bacteria.

=== Pressing ===
Pressing is the act of applying pressure to grapes or pomace in order to separate juice or wine from grapes and grape skins. Pressing is not always a necessary act in winemaking; if grapes are crushed there is a considerable amount of juice immediately liberated (called free-run juice) that can be used for vinification. Typically this free-run juice is of a higher quality than the press juice. Pressed juice is typically lesser in quality due to the release and increase of total phenolic compounds, as well as browning index and the C6-alcohol levels. These compounds are responsible for the herb-like taste perceived in wine with pressed grapes. However, most wineries do use presses in order to increase their production (gallons) per ton, as pressed juice can represent between 15%-30% of the total juice volume from the grape.

Presses act by positioning the grape skins or whole grape clusters between a rigid surface and a movable surface and slowly decrease the volume between the two surfaces. Modern presses dictate the duration and pressure at each press cycle, usually ramping from 0 Bar to 2.0 Bar. Sometimes winemakers choose pressures which separate the streams of pressed juice, called making &quot;press cuts.&quot; As the pressure increases the amount of tannin extracted from the skins into the juice increases, often rendering the pressed juice excessively tannic or harsh. Because of the location of grape juice constituents in the berry (water and acid are found primarily in the mesocarp or pulp, whereas tannins are found primarily in the exocarp, or skin, and seeds), pressed juice or wine tends to be lower in acidity with a higher pH than the free-run juice.
Before the advent of modern winemaking, most presses were basket presses made of wood and operated manually. Basket presses are composed of a cylinder of wooden slats on top of a fixed plate, with a moveable plate that can be forced downward (usually by a central ratcheting threaded screw). The press operator would load the grapes or pomace into the wooden cylinder, put the top plate in place and lower it until juice flowed from the wooden slats. As the juice flow decreased, the plate was ratcheted down again. This process continued until the press operator determined that the quality of the pressed juice or wine was below standard, or all liquids had been pressed. Since the early 1990s, modern mechanical basket presses have been revived through higher-end producers seeking to replicate the gentle pressing of the historical basket presses. Because basket presses have a relatively compact design, the press cake offers a relatively longer pathway for the juice to travel before leaving the press. It is believed by advocates of basket presses that this relatively long pathway through the grape or pomace cake serves as a filter to solids that would otherwise affect the quality of the press juice.

With red wines, the must is pressed after primary fermentation, which separates the skins and other solid matter from the liquid. With white wine, the liquid is separated from the must before fermentation . With rose, the skins may be kept in contact for a shorter period to give color to the wine, in that case the must may be pressed as well. After a period in which the wine stands or ages, the wine is separated from the dead yeast and any solids that remained (called lees), and transferred to a new container where any additional fermentation may take place.

=== Pigeage ===

Pigeage is a French term for the management of acidity and secondary pressing of grapes in fermentation tanks. To make certain types of wine, grapes are put through a crusher and then poured into open fermentation tanks. Once fermentation begins, the grape skins are floated to the surface by carbon dioxide gases released in the fermentation process. This layer of skins and other solids is known as the cap. As the skins are the source of the tannins, the cap needs to be mixed through the liquid each day, or &quot;punched&quot;, which traditionally is done by stomping through the vat.

== Cold stabilization ==

&quot;Cold stabilization&quot; is a process used in winemaking to reduce tartrate crystals (generally potassium bitartrate) in wine. These tartrate crystals look like grains of clear sand, and are also known as &quot;wine crystals&quot; or &quot;wine diamonds&quot;. They are formed by the union of tartaric acid and potassium, and may appear to be [sediment] in the wine, though they are not. During the cold stabilizing process after fermentation, the temperature of the wine is dropped to close to freezing for 1–2 weeks. This will cause the crystals to separate from the wine and stick to the sides of the holding vessel. When the wine is drained from the vessels, the tartrates are left behind. They may also form in wine bottles that have been stored under very cold conditions.

== Secondary (malolactic) fermentation and bulk aging ==

During the secondary fermentation and aging process, which takes three to six months, the fermentation continues very slowly. The wine is kept under an airlock to protect the wine from oxidation. Proteins from the grape are broken down and the remaining yeast cells and other fine particles from the grapes are allowed to settle. Potassium bitartrate will also precipitate, a process which can be enhanced by cold stabilization to prevent the appearance of (harmless) tartrate crystals after bottling. The result of these processes is that the originally cloudy wine becomes clear. The wine can be racked during this process to remove the lees.

The secondary fermentation usually takes place in large stainless steel vessels with a volume of several cubic meters, oak barrels or glass demijohns (also referred to as carboys), depending on the goals of the winemakers. Unoaked wine is fermented in a barrel made of stainless steel or other material having no influence on the final taste of the wine. Depending on the desired taste, it could be fermented mainly in stainless steel to be briefly put in oak, or have the complete fermentation done in stainless steel. Oak could be added as chips used with a non-wooden barrel instead of a fully wooden barrel. This process is mainly used in cheaper wine.

Amateur winemakers often use glass carboys in the production of their wine; these vessels (sometimes called &quot;demijohns&quot;) have a capacity of . The kind of vessel used depends on the amount of wine that is being made, the grapes being used, and the intentions of the winemaker.

== Malolactic fermentation ==
Malolactic fermentation occurs when lactic acid bacteria metabolize malic acid and produce lactic acid and carbon dioxide. This is carried out either as an intentional procedure in which specially cultivated strains of such bacteria are introduced into the maturing wine, or it can happen by chance if uncultivated lactic acid bacteria are present.

Malolactic fermentation can improve the taste of wine that has high levels of malic acid, because malic acid, in higher concentration, generally causes an unpleasant harsh and bitter taste sensation, whereas lactic acid is more gentle and less sour. Lactic acid is an acid found in dairy products. Malolactic fermentation usually results in a reduction in the amount of total acidity of the wine. This is because malic acid has two acid radicals (-COOH) while lactic acid has only one. However, the pH should be monitored and not allowed to rise above a pH of 3.55 for whites or a pH of 3.80 for reds. pH can be reduced roughly at a rate of 0.1 units per 1 gram/litre of tartaric acid addition.

The use of lactic acid bacteria is the reason why some chardonnays can taste &quot;buttery&quot; due to the production of diacetyl by the bacteria. Most red wines go through complete malolactic fermentation, both to lessen the acid of the wine and to remove the possibility that malolactic fermentation will occur in the bottle.
White wines vary in the use of malolactic fermentation during their making. Lighter aromatic wines such as Riesling, generally do not go through malolactic fermentation. The fuller white wines, such as barrel-fermented chardonnay, are more commonly put through malolactic fermentation. Sometimes a partial fermentation, for example, somewhere less than 50% might be employed.

== Laboratory tests ==
Whether the wine is aging in tanks or barrels, tests are run periodically in a laboratory to check the status of the wine. Common tests include Brix, pH, titratable acidity, residual sugar, free or available sulfur, total sulfur, volatile acidity (V.A.) and percent alcohol. Additional tests include those for the crystallization of cream of tartar (potassium hydrogen tartrate) and the precipitation of heat unstable protein; this last test is limited to white wines. These tests may be performed throughout the making of the wine as well as prior to bottling. In response to the results of these tests, a winemaker can decide on appropriate remedial action, for example the addition of more sulfur dioxide. Sensory tests will also be performed and again in response to these a winemaker may take remedial action such as the addition of a protein to soften the taste of the wine.

Brix (°Bx) is one measure of the soluble solids in the grape juice and represents not only the sugars but also includes many other soluble substances such as salts, acids and tannins, sometimes called total dissolved solids (TDS). Because sugar is the dominant compound in grape juice, these units are effectively a measure of sugar level. The level of sugar in the grapes determines the final alcohol content of the wine as well as indirect index of grape maturity. °Bx is measured in grams per hundred grams of solution, so 20 °Bx means that 100 grams of juice contains 20 g of dissolved compounds. There are other common measures of sugar content of grapes, specific gravity, Oechsle (Germany) and Baumé (France). °Bx is usually measured with a refractometer while the other methods use a hydrometer which measures specific gravity. Generally, hydrometers are a cheaper alternative. In the French Baumé (Be° or Bé° for short) one Be° corresponds approximately to one percent alcohol. One Be° is equal to 1.8 °Bx, that is 1.8 grams of sugar per one hundred grams. Therefore, to achieve one percent alcohol the winemaker adds sugar at a rate of 1.8 grams per 100 ml (18 grams per liter) – a practice known as chaptalization, which is illegal in some countries and in California.

Volatile acidity test verifies if there is any steam distillable acids in the wine. Mainly present is acetic acid (the dominant component of vinegar), but lactic, butyric, propionic, and formic acid can also be found. Usually the test checks for these acids in a cash still, but there are other methods available such as HPLC, gas chromatography and enzymatic methods. The amount of volatile acidity found in sound grapes is negligible, because it is a by-product of microbial metabolism. Because acetic acid bacteria require oxygen to grow, eliminating any air in wine containers as well as addition of sulfur dioxide (SO2) will limit their growth. Rejecting moldy grapes also prevents possible problems associated with acetic acid bacteria. Use of sulfur dioxide and inoculation with a low-V.A. producing strain of &quot;Saccharomyces&quot; may deter acetic acid producing yeast. A relatively new method for removal of volatile acidity from a wine is reverse osmosis. Blending may also help – a wine with high V.A. can be filtered (to remove the microbe responsible) and blended with a low V.A. wine, so that the acetic acid level is below the sensory threshold.

Sulphur dioxide can be readily measured with relatively simple laboratory equipment. There are several methods available; a typical test involves acidification of a sample with phosphoric acid, distillation of the liberated SO2, and capture by hydrogen peroxide solution. The SO2 and peroxide react to form sulphuric acid, which is then titrated with NaOH to an end point with an indicator, and the volume of NaOH required is used to calculate the SO2 level. This method has inaccuracies associated with red wine, inefficient condensers, and excessive aspiration rate, although the results are reproducible, having an accuracy with just a 2.5–5% error, which is sufficient to control the level of sulphur dioxide in wine.

== Blending and fining ==
Different batches of wine can be mixed before bottling in order to achieve the desired taste. The winemaker can correct perceived inadequacies by mixing wines from different grapes and batches that were produced under different conditions. These adjustments can be as simple as adjusting acid or tannin levels, to as complex as blending different varieties or vintages to achieve a consistent taste.

Fining agents are used during winemaking to remove tannins, reduce astringency and remove microscopic particles that could cloud the wines. The winemakers decide on which fining agents are used and these may vary from product to product and even batch to batch (usually depending on the grapes of that particular year).

Gelatin [gelatine] has been used in winemaking for centuries and is recognized as a traditional method for wine fining, or clarifying. It is also the most commonly used agent to reduce the tannin content. Generally no gelatin remains in the wine because it reacts with the wine components, as it clarifies, and forms a sediment which is removed by filtration prior to bottling.

Besides gelatin, other fining agents for wine are often derived from animal products, such as micronized potassium caseinate (casein is milk protein), egg whites, egg albumin, bone char, bull&#x27;s blood, isinglass (Sturgeon bladder), PVPP (a synthetic compound), lysozyme, and skim milk powder. Although not common, finely ground eggshell is also sometimes used.

Some aromatized wines contain honey or egg-yolk extract, or other woody extractives by artificial aging with small chips.

Non-animal-based filtering agents are also often used, such as bentonite (a volcanic clay-based filter), diatomaceous earth, cellulose pads, paper filters and membrane filters (thin films of plastic polymer material having uniformly sized holes).

== Preservatives ==
The most common preservative used in winemaking is sulfur dioxide (SO2), normally added in one of the following forms: liquid sulfur dioxide, sodium or potassium metabisulphite. Another useful preservative is potassium sorbate.

Sulfur dioxide has two primary actions, firstly it is an anti microbial agent and secondly an anti oxidant. In the making of white wine it can be added prior to fermentation and immediately after alcoholic fermentation is complete. If added after alcoholic fermentation it will have the effect of preventing or stopping malolactic fermentation, bacterial spoilage and help protect against the damaging effects of oxygen. Additions of up to 100 mg per liter (of sulfur dioxide) can be added, but the available or free sulfur dioxide should be measured by the aspiration method and adjusted to 30 mg per liter. Available sulfur dioxide should be maintained at this level until bottling. For rose wines smaller additions should be made and the available level should be no more than 30 mg per liter.

In the making of red wine, sulfur dioxide may be used at high levels (100 mg per liter) prior to ferment to assist in color stabilization. Otherwise, it is used at the end of malolactic ferment and performs the same functions as in white wine. However, small additions (say, ) should be used to avoid bleaching red pigments and the maintenance level should be about 20 mg/L. Furthermore, small additions (say 20 mg per liter) may be made to red wine after alcoholic ferment and before malolactic ferment to overcome minor oxidation and prevent the growth of acetic acid bacteria.

Without the use of sulfur dioxide, wines can readily suffer bacterial spoilage no matter how hygienic the winemaking practice.

Potassium sorbate is effective for the control of fungal growth, including yeast, especially for sweet wines in bottle. However, one potential hazard is the metabolism of sorbate to geraniol which is a potent and unpleasant by-product. The production of geraniol occurs only if sorbic acid is present during malo-lactic fermentation. To avoid this, either the wine must be sterile bottled or contain enough sulfur dioxide to inhibit the growth of bacteria. Sterile bottling includes the use of filtration.

Some winemakers practice natural wine making where no preservative is added. Once the wine is bottled and corked, the bottles are put into refrigeration with temperatures near .

== Filtration ==
Filtration in winemaking is used to accomplish two objectives, clarification and microbial stabilization. In clarification, large particles that affect the visual appearance of the wine are removed. In microbial stabilization, organisms that affect the stability of the wine are removed therefore reducing the likelihood of re-fermentation or spoilage.
The process of clarification is concerned with the removal of particles; those larger than for coarse polishing, particles larger than 1–4 micrometers for clarifying or polishing. Microbial stabilization requires a filtration of at least 0.65 micrometers for yeast retention and 0.45 μm for bacteria retention. However, filtration at this level may lighten a wine&#x27;s color and body. Microbial stabilization does not imply sterility, i.e. eliminating (removing) or killing (deactivating) of all forms of life and other biological agents. It simply means that a significant amount of yeast and bacteria has been removed to a harmless level for the wine stability.

Clarification of the wine can take place naturally by putting the wine into refrigeration at . The wine takes about a month to settle and it is clear. No chemicals are needed.

== Bottling ==
A final dose of sulfite is added to help preserve the wine and prevent unwanted fermentation in the bottle. The wine bottles are then traditionally sealed with a cork, although alternative wine closures such as less expensive synthetic corks and screw caps, which are less subject to cork taint, are becoming increasingly popular. The final step is adding a capsule to the top of the bottle which is then heated for a tight seal.

Wine bottle closure methods vary greatly considering taste, closure effectiveness, and aesthetic. These methods allow a minimal amount of air in the bottle while allowing the contents to age.

In some cases, wines are sold in bags and boxes instead of in bottles.

== Regulation ==
In the European Union, each member state is required by Article 146 of Regulation 1308/2013 - Establishing a common organisation of the markets in agricultural products and repealing Council Regulations (EEC) No 922/72, (EEC) No 234/79, (EC) No 1037/2001 and (EC) No 1234/2007 - to appoint one or more &quot;competent national authorities&quot; responsible for ensuring compliance with EU rules in the wine sector. A list of these authorities is maintained by the EU.

== Winemakers ==
Traditionally known as a &quot;vintner&quot;, a winemaker is a person engaged in making wine. They are generally employed by wineries or wine companies, although there are many independent winemakers who make wine at home for their own pleasure or small commercial operation. Additionally, winemaking is still carried in traditional ways by families producing wine for their own consumption.

<text>Avon County Council was the county council of the non-metropolitan county of Avon in south west England. It came into its powers on 1 April 1974 and was abolished on 1 April 1996 at the same time as the county. The county council was based at Avon House in Bristol. It was replaced with four authorities: Bristol City Council, South Gloucestershire Council, North Somerset Council and Bath and North East Somerset Council.

==Political control==
From the first election to the council in 1973 political control of the council was held by the following parties:

==Council elections==
*1973 Avon County Council election
*1977 Avon County Council election
*1981 Avon County Council election (new ward boundaries)
*1985 Avon County Council election

<text>The [[John von Neumann|von Neumann]] cardinal assignment is a cardinal assignment that uses ordinal numbers. For a well-orderable set &quot;U&quot;, we define its cardinal number to be the smallest ordinal number equinumerous to &quot;U&quot;, using the von Neumann definition of an ordinal number. More precisely:

:formula_1

where ON is the class of ordinals. This ordinal is also called the initial ordinal of the cardinal.

That such an ordinal exists and is unique is guaranteed by the fact that &quot;U&quot; is well-orderable and that the class of ordinals is well-ordered, using the axiom of replacement. With the full axiom of choice, every set is well-orderable, so every set has a cardinal; we order the cardinals using the inherited ordering from the ordinal numbers. This is readily found to coincide with the ordering via ≤&quot;c&quot;. This is a well-ordering of cardinal numbers.

== Initial ordinal of a cardinal ==
Each ordinal has an associated cardinal, its cardinality, obtained by simply forgetting the order. Any well-ordered set having that ordinal as its order type has the same cardinality. The smallest ordinal having a given cardinal as its cardinality is called the initial ordinal of that cardinal. Every finite ordinal (natural number) is initial, but most infinite ordinals are not initial. The axiom of choice is equivalent to the statement that every set can be well-ordered, i.e. that every cardinal has an initial ordinal. In this case, it is traditional to identify the cardinal number with its initial ordinal, and we say that the initial ordinal &quot;is&quot; a cardinal.

The formula_2-th infinite initial ordinal is written formula_3. Its cardinality is written formula_4 (the formula_2-th aleph number). For example, the cardinality of formula_6 is formula_7, which is also the cardinality of formula_8, formula_9, and formula_10 (all are countable ordinals). So we identify formula_11 with formula_4, except that the notation formula_4 is used for writing cardinals, and formula_11 for writing ordinals. This is important because arithmetic on cardinals is different from arithmetic on ordinals, for example formula_15 = formula_4 whereas formula_17 &gt; formula_11. Also, formula_19 is the smallest uncountable ordinal (to see that it exists, consider the set of equivalence classes of well-orderings of the natural numbers; each such well-ordering defines a countable ordinal, and formula_19 is the order type of that set), formula_21 is the smallest ordinal whose cardinality is greater than formula_22, and so on, and formula_23 is the limit of formula_24 for natural numbers formula_25 (any limit of cardinals is a cardinal, so this limit is indeed the first cardinal after all the formula_24).

Infinite initial ordinals are limit ordinals. Using ordinal arithmetic, formula_27 implies formula_28, and 1 ≤ &quot;α&quot; &lt; ω&quot;β&quot; implies &quot;α&quot; · ω&quot;β&quot; = ω&quot;β&quot;, and 2 ≤ &quot;α&quot; &lt; ω&quot;β&quot; implies &quot;α&quot;ω&quot;β&quot; = ω&quot;β&quot;. Using the Veblen hierarchy, &quot;β&quot; ≠ 0 and &quot;α&quot; &lt; ω&quot;β&quot; imply formula_29 and Γω&quot;β&quot; = ω&quot;β&quot;. Indeed, one can go far beyond this. So as an ordinal, an infinite initial ordinal is an extremely strong kind of limit.

<doc id="373182" wikidata="Q2360032" url="?curid=373182" title="Authenticity (philosophy)">
<text>Authenticity is a concept of personality in the fields of psychology, existential psychotherapy, existentialist philosophy, and aesthetics. In existentialism, authenticity is the degree to which a person&#x27;s actions are congruent with their values and desires, despite external pressures to social conformity. The conscious self comes to terms with the condition of , of having been &quot;thrown&quot; into an absurd world (without values and meaning) not of their own making, thereby encountering external forces and influences different from and other than the Self. A person’s lack of authenticity is considered &quot;bad faith&quot; in dealing with other people and with one&#x27;s self; thus, authenticity is in the instruction of the Oracle of Delphi: “Know thyself.” Concerning authenticity in art, the philosophers Jean Paul Sartre and Theodor Adorno held opposing views and opinions about jazz, a genre of American music; Sartre said that jazz is authentic and Adorno said that jazz is inauthentic. Many musical subcultures require artistic authenticity, lest the community consider an artist to be a poseur for lacking authenticity (creative, musical, or personal); artistic authenticity is integral to many genres of music, including but not limited to genres of rock (such as punk rock and heavy metal), club music (such as house and techno), and hip-hop.

In the 18th century, Romantic philosophers recommended intuition, emotion, and a connection to Nature as the necessary counterbalances to the intellectualism of the Age of Enlightenment. In the 20th century, Anglo–American preoccupations with authenticity centered on the writings of existentialist philosophers whose native tongue is not English; therefore, the faithful, true, and accurate translation of the term &quot;existentialism&quot; was much debated, to which end the philosopher Walter Kaufmann assembled a canon of existentialist philosophers. Kaufmann&#x27;s canon includes the Dane Søren Kierkegaard (1813–1855), the German Martin Heidegger (1889–1976), and the Frenchman Jean-Paul Sartre (1905–1980). For these existentialists, the conscious Self comes to terms with existence (being and living) in an absurd, materialist world featuring external forces, e.g. (Thrown-ness), and intellectual influences different from and other than the Self. 

Personal authenticity is exhibited in how a person acts and changes in response to the external world&#x27;s influences upon the Self. Among artists, authenticity in art describes a work of art faithful to the artist&#x27;s values. In the field of psychology, authenticity identifies a person living life in accordance with their true Self and personal values rather than according to the external demands of society, such as social conventions, kinship, and duty.

To identify, describe, and define &quot;authenticity&quot;, existential philosophers like Kierkegaard, Nietzsche, and Martin Heidegger investigated the existential and ontological significance of the social constructs that compose the norms of society. For a journalist, not blindly accepting social norms contributes to producing intellectually authentic reportage, achieved by the reporter choosing to be true to their professional ethics and personal values. Yet, in the praxis of journalism, the reporter’s authenticity (professional and personal) is continually contradicted by the business requirements of corporate publishing.

==Existential perspectives==

===Søren Kierkegaard===
According to Kierkegaard, personal authenticity depends upon a person finding an authentic faith and, in so doing, being true to themselves. Moral compromises inherent to the ideologies of bourgeois society and Christianity challenge the personal integrity of a person who seeks to live an authentic life as determined by the self. A mass-culture society diminishes the significance of personal individuality, by way of social “levelling” through news media that provide people with beliefs and opinions constructed by someone other than themselves. A person can attain authentic faith by facing reality and choosing to live according to the facts of the material world, or can deny authentic faith by passively accepting religious faith. Kierkegaard’s philosophy shows that personal authenticity is a personal choice based upon the experience of the real world; in &quot;Practice in Christianity&quot; (1850), Kierkegaard wrote: 

===Friedrich Nietzsche===
Personal authenticity can be achieved—without religion, which requires accepting pre-determined virtues (eternal valuations) as unquestionably true. In living authentically, a person elevates himself/herself above the mass culture to transcend the limits of conventional morality, thereby personally determining what is and what is not good and bad, without the pre-determined virtues of conformity “on account of which we hold our grandfathers in esteem”. An authentic life is achieved by avoiding the “herding animal morality”. To “stand alone [is to be] strong and original enough to initiate opposite estimates of value, to transvaluate and invert ‘eternal valuations’”. Common to the existential perspectives of Kierkegaard and Nietzsche are “the responsibilities they place on the individual to take an active part in the shaping of one’s beliefs, and then to be willing to act on that belief”.

===Jean-Paul Sartre===
It is difficult to describe &quot;authenticity&quot; intelligibly. One possibility is to describe instead the &quot;negative space&quot; surrounding the condition of being &quot;inauthentic&quot; by giving examples. To that end, the novels of Jean-Paul Sartre make &quot;authenticity&quot; conceptually intelligible through the stories of anti-heroic characters, people who base their actions upon external, psychological pressures — such as the social pressure to appear to be a certain kind of person; the pressure to adopt a given way of life; and the pressure to prostitute personal integrity (moral values and aesthetic standards) in exchange for the comfort (physical, mental, and moral) of social conformity. The novelist Sartre explains existential philosophy through characters who do not understand their reasoning for acting as they do—people who ignore crucial facts about their own lives to avoid learning about being an &quot;inauthentic&quot; person with an identity defined from outside the self.

Absolute freedom is the vertiginous experience necessary for being authentic, yet such freedom can be so unpleasant as to impel people to choose an inauthentic life. As an aspect of authenticity, absolute freedom determines a person’s &quot;relation&quot; with the real world, a relation not based upon or determined by a system of values or an ideology. In this manner, authenticity is connected with creativity, and the will to act must be born of the actor. In that vein, Heidegger speaks of absolute freedom as &quot;modes of living&quot; determined by personal choice. Sartre identified, described, and explained what is an inauthentic existence, not to define what is an authentic mode of living.

===Erich Fromm===
Erich Fromm proposed a very different definition of authenticity in the mid-twentieth century. He considered behavior of any kind, even that wholly in accord with societal mores, to be authentic if it results from personal understanding and approval of its drives and origins, rather than merely from conformity with the received wisdom of the society. Thus, a Frommean authentic may behave consistently in accord with cultural norms, if those norms appear on consideration to be appropriate, rather than simply in the interest of conforming with current norms. Fromm thus considers authenticity to be a positive outcome of enlightened and informed motivation, rather than a negative outcome of rejection of the expectations of others. He described the latter condition – the drive primarily to escape external restraints typified by the &quot;absolute freedom&quot; of Sartre – as &quot;the illusion of individuality&quot;, as opposed to the genuine individuality that results from authentic living.

==Musical subculture==
Some genres of rock music, especially the subcultures of punk and heavy metal, require a great deal of artistic authenticity from its musicians and fans and criticize and exclude musicians, composers, and bands they assess as being &quot;poseurs&quot; — insufficiently authentic or inauthentic as artists. A &quot;poseur&quot; is an artist or a musical band who copies the dress, the style of speech, and the manners of the subculture, yet is excluded for not understanding the artistic philosophy, not understanding the sociology, and not understanding the value system of the subculture; talking the talk, without walking the walk.

The authenticity of an artist has three bases: (I) long-term dedication to the music scene; (II) historical knowledge of the subculture; and (III) personal integrity (inner voice) for correct artistic choices. At one extreme of the heavy-metal genre, exists the subgenre of black metal whose adherents value above all else, artistic authenticity, emotional sincerity, and extremity of expression. Black metal artists emphatically profess that black metal performances are not for entertainment or spectacle, but rather that the extreme expression of such performances, are &quot;ritual expression&quot;, achieved through transcendence of the body and the self. In light of such systems of moral value in the arts, a working-class band, by accepting a formal recording contract, might appear to be sell outs within the heavy metal and punk rock communities. The academic Deena Weinstein said that “The code of authenticity, which is central to the heavy metal subculture, is demonstrated in many ways”, such as by clothing, an emotional singing voice, and thematic substance to the songs.

==Criticism==
The philosopher Jacob Golomb argues that existential authenticity is a way of life incompatible with a system of moral values that comprehends all persons.

<text>Asikkala () is a municipality of Finland. Its seat is in Vääksy, at the shores of the Lake Päijänne. It is located in the province of Southern Finland and is part of the Päijänne Tavastia region. Asikkala&#x27;s neighboring municipalities are Hämeenlinna, Heinola, Hollola, Lahti, Padasjoki and Sysmä.

The municipality has a population of () and covers an area of of which is water. The population density is .

The municipality is unilingually Finnish, by law since 1996.

== History ==
The oldest prehistoric objects discovered in Asikkala, primarily tools, are presumed to date back to approximately 3000 BCE. The island of Kotasaari in the village of Kalkkinen has been a significant source of finds as well; the settlement on the island dates back to the Stone Age. In the Middle Age, the hunters populating the area of Asikkala made excursions towards the north on the Päijänne. The oldest villages in the municipality are presumed to be Kalkkinen as well as Anianpelto, the former of which also housed the largest estate in the area, known as Iisakkila or Kalkkinen.

Asikkala is mentioned in writing for the first time in a document concerning a border dispute with Sysmä in 1443. It is mentioned in 1445 as an administrative parish, whose subordinates in taxation included the villages of Viitaila, Asikkala and Urajärvi, and later Ruuhijärvi in modern-day Nastola. In the early 1600s, Asikkala became an independent chapel parish from the mother parish of Hollola.

<doc id="373186" wikidata="Q730954" url="?curid=373186" title="Askainen">
<text>Askainen (; ) is a former municipality of Finland. Together with Lemu, it was consolidated with Masku on January 1, 2009.

It is located in southwestern part of the country in the Varsinais-Suomi region. The municipality had a population of 938 (2004-12-31) and covered an area of 61.52 km2 (excluding sea) of which 0.26 km2 is inland water. The population density was 15.31 inhabitants per km2.

The municipality was unilingually Finnish.

== History ==
Askainen was first mentioned in 1374 as &quot;Askais&quot;, when it was a part of the Nousiainen parish. It was included into the Lemu parish after its separation from Nousiainen sometime before 1404. Askainen was also held by the monastery of Naantali before the Reformation. Askainen was mentioned as a chapel community within Lemu in 1592, though chapel rights may have been granted earlier.

Askainen became a separate parish and municipality in 1910, but the parishes of Askainen and Lemu were reunited in 1960. Despite this, the two still acted as separate municipalities until 2009, when they became parts of Masku.

==Notable residents==
*Carl Gustaf Emil Mannerheim, field marshal and 6th President of Finland was born in Askainen on June 4, 1867.

<doc id="373189" wikidata="Q839834" url="?curid=373189" title="Rose-breasted grosbeak">
<text>The rose-breasted grosbeak (Pheucticus ludovicianus), colloquially called &quot;cut-throat&quot; due to its coloration, is a large, seed-eating grosbeak in the cardinal family (Cardinalidae). It is primarily a foliage gleaner. Males have black heads, wings, backs, and tails, and a bright rose colored patch on their white breast. Males and females exhibit marked sexual dimorphism.

Breeding habitat consists of cool-temperate open deciduous woods throughout much of eastern North America, with migration to tropical America in winter. Rose-breasted grosbeaks have an average maximum lifespan of 7.3 years in the wild, and up to 24 years in captivity. Death in the wild is generally due to collision with objects (buildings, cars, etc.) and predation, to eggs, nestlings and adults.

==Taxonomy==
In 1760 the French zoologist Mathurin Jacques Brisson included a description of the rose-breasted grosbeak in his &quot;Ornithologie&quot; based on a specimen collected in Louisiana. He used the French name &quot;Le gros-bec de la Louisiane&quot; and the Latin &quot;Coccothraustes Ludoviciana&quot;. Although Brisson coined Latin names, these do not conform to the binomial system and are not recognised by the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature. When in 1766 the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus updated his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; for the twelfth edition, he added 240 species that had been previously described by Brisson. One of these was the rose-breasted grosbeak. Linnaeus included a brief description, coined the binomial name &quot;Loxia ludoviciana&quot; and cited Brisson&#x27;s work. This species is now placed in the genus &quot;Pheucticus&quot; that was introduced by the German naturalist Ludwig Reichenbach in 1850. The species is monotypic.

The genus name &quot;Pheucticus&quot; is from Ancient Greek φευκτικός - &quot;pheuktikós&quot;, &quot;shy&quot;, from - &quot;pheúgo&quot;, &quot;to flee&quot;, and the specific &quot;ludovicianus&quot; is from Neo-Latin and refers to Louisiana.

==Description==
Adult birds are long, span across the wings and weigh . Grosbeaks measured during migration in the West Indies averaged , while those banded in Pennsylvania average about . Very little sexual dimorphism in size is seen; females were found to be marginally smaller in standard measurements, but in some seasons were marginally heavier than males when banded in Pennsylvania. At all ages and in both sexes, the beak is dusky horn-colored, and the feet and eyes are dark.

The adult male in breeding plumage has a black head, wings, back, and tail, and a bright rose-red patch on its breast; the wings have two white patches and rose-red linings. Its underside and rump are white. Males in nonbreeding plumage have largely white underparts, supercilium, and cheeks. The upperside feathers have brown fringes, and most wing feathers white ones, giving a scaly appearance. The bases of the primary remiges are also white. The coloration renders the adult male rose-breasted grosbeak (even while wintering) unmistakable if seen well.

The adult female has dark grey-brown upperparts – darker on wings and tail – a white supercilium, a buff stripe along the top of the head, and black-streaked white underparts, which except in the center of the belly have a buff tinge. The wing linings are yellowish, and on the upperwing are two white patches like in the summer male. Immatures are similar, but with pink wing-linings and less prominent streaks and usually a pinkish-buff hue on the throat and breast. At one year of age—in their first breeding season—males are scaly above like fully adult males in winter plumage, and still retain the immature&#x27;s browner wings. Unlike males, females can easily be confused with the black-headed grosbeak (&quot;Pheucticus melanocephalus&quot;) where their ranges overlap in the central United States and south-central Canada. The rose-breasted grosbeak female has slightly darker brown markings on the underside, paler rather yellowish streaking on both the head and wings and paler, pinkish (rather than bi-colored) bill when compared to the female black-headed grosbeak. A potential confusion species also is the female purple finch (&quot;Haemorhous purpureus&quot;), but that species is noticeably smaller with a less robust bill and a notched tail.

The song is a subdued mellow warbling, resembling a more refined, sweeter version of the American robin&#x27;s (&quot;Turdus migratorius&quot;). Males start singing early, occasionally even when still in winter quarters. The call is a sharp &quot;pink&quot; or &quot;pick&quot;, somewhat reminiscent of a woodpecker call.

==Distribution and habitat==
The rose-breasted grosbeak&#x27;s breeding habitat is open deciduous woods across most of Canada and the northeastern United States. In particular, the northern birds migrate south through the United States east of the Rocky Mountains, to winter from central-southern Mexico through Central America and the Caribbean to Peru and Venezuela. The southern limit of its wintering range is not well known; it was, for example, only recorded in the Serranía de las Quinchas (Colombia) in the 1990s. In winter, they prefer more open woodland, or similar habitat with a loose growth of trees, such as forest edges, parks, gardens, and plantations, ranging from sea level into the hills, e.g. up to above mean sea level in Costa Rica. Since 1966 the rose-breasted grosbeak has experienced a greater than 1.5% yearly decline in population throughout the eastern part of its summer range, but a coincident &gt;1.5% yearly increase in western parts of its summer range.

===Migration===
The first birds leave the breeding grounds as early as August, while the last ones do not return until mid-late May. In general, however, they migrate south in late September or in October, and return in late April or early May. It appears as if they remain on their breeding grounds longer today than they did in the early 20th century, when migrants were more commonly seen in May and August than in April or September. The rose-breasted grosbeak occurs as a very rare vagrant in western Europe. During breeding it is fairly territorial; in winter, it roams the lands in groups of about a handful of birds, and sometimes in larger flocks of a dozen or more.

==Behaviour and ecology==

===Breeding===
Rose-breasted grosbeaks were the only one of 70 migratory songbird species in the eastern United States shown in males to have produced sperm while still far south of their breeding location. Male grosbeaks tend to arrive a few days to a week before the females and pair formation apparently occurs on the breeding grounds. Nest building begins from as early as early May in Tennessee to as late as early June further north in Saskatchewan. Egg laying may occur anytime from mid-May to mid-July, as has been recorded in Quebec. Usually only a single brood is laid by these grosbeaks each summer but second broods are suspected in Canada and confirmed in semi-captivity. Both the male and the female apparently participate in selecting and building the nest, which is on a tree branch, over vines or any elevated woody vegetation. Nests have been recorded at off the ground, averaging high, almost always in the vicinity of openings in woodlands. Nests are typical of many passerines in both construct, material and size, made from leaves, twigs, rootlets or hair. Clutches are from 1 to 5 eggs, normally being 3–4, being pale blue to green with purplish to brownish red spotting. Males do a third of the incubation roughly, the female doing the remaining amount, and incubation can last from 11 to 14 days. Nestlings are at hatching and after 3–6 days of age, they gain at least each day. The young grosbeaks typically fledge at 9–13 days of age and are independent of their parents after approximately 3 weeks.

===Longevity and mortality===
Maximum lifespan recorded for a wild rose-breasted grosbeak was 12 years, 11 months. Captive grosbeaks have been recorded living up to 24 years of age, making them quite a long-living passerine excluding the pressures of surviving in the wild. Although frequently targeted by the brood parasite, the brown-headed cowbird (&quot;Molothrus ater&quot;), the rose-breasted grosbeak is apparently able to recognize cowbird eggs and has been seen to aggressively displace cowbirds near the nest. Typically, fewer than 7% of grosbeak nests have cowbird eggs per one study. Per the U.S. Bird Banding Laboratory, as of 1997, rose-breasted grosbeaks recovered when dead have largely collided with objects, including buildings and cars (17.2%) or had been shot (10%; mostly before 1960), 3.6% of the fatalities were caught by cats, 0.8% caught by dogs. Mortality due to natural causes, including disease, natural predators and inclement weather go largely unreported. It is known the main cause of nesting failure is predation. Natural predators of eggs and nestlings include blue jays (&quot;Cyanocitta cristata&quot;), common grackles (&quot;Quiscalus quiscula&quot;), raccoons (&quot;Procyon lotor&quot;), gray (&quot;Sciurus carolinensis&quot;) and red (&quot;Tamiasciurus hudsonicus&quot;) squirrels. Confirmed predators of adults include both Cooper&#x27;s (&quot;Accipiter cooperii&quot;) and sharp-shinned hawks (&quot;Accipiter striatus&quot;) as well as northern harriers (&quot;Circus cyaenus&quot;), eastern screech-owls (&quot;Megascops asio&quot;) and short-eared owls (&quot;Asio flammeus&quot;).

===Diet===
The rose-breasted grosbeak forages in shrubs or trees for insects, seeds and berries, also catching insects in flight and occasionally eating nectar. It usually keeps to the treetops, and only rarely can be seen on the ground. In the winter quarters, they can be attracted into parks, gardens, and possibly even to bird feeders by fruit like &quot;Trophis racemosa&quot;. They also survive on blackberries, mulberries, seeds of smartweed, pigweed, raspberries, and milkweed, in addition to sunflower seeds, garden peas, oats, wheat, tree blossoms, tree buds, and developed natural product. Other notable winter food includes &quot;jacaranda&quot; seeds and the fruits of the introduced busy Lizzy (&quot;Impatiens walleriana&quot;). In grosbeaks from the north-central United States and southern Canada, 52% of the stomach contents were comprised by invertebrates, predominantly beetles; 19.3% was made up of wild fruits; 15.7% by weed seeds; 6.5% by cultivated fruits and plants, including peas, corn (&quot;Zea mays&quot;), oats (&quot;Avena sativa&quot;) and wheat (&quot;Triticum vulgare&quot;); and the remaining 6.5% by other plant material, including tree buds and flowers.

==Status==
Fires are necessary to maintain many kinds of grassland (see Fire ecology). Fire suppression in the late-20th century allowed forests to spread on the Great Plains into areas where recurring fires would otherwise have maintained grassland. This allowed hybridization with the black-headed grosbeak subspecies &quot;P. melanocephalus papago&quot;. Range expansions also seem to have occurred elsewhere, for example in northern Ohio, where it bred rarely if at all in the 1900s (decade), but it is by no means an uncommon breeder today. In general, though it requires mature woodland to breed and is occasionally caught as a cage bird, the rose-breasted grosbeak is not at all rare, and not considered a threatened species by the IUCN. Its average maximum lifespan in the wild is 7.3 years.

<text>Harish-Chandra Mehrotra FRS (11 October 1923 – 16 October 1983) was an Indian-American mathematician and physicist who did fundamental work in representation theory, especially harmonic analysis on semisimple Lie groups.

==Early life==
Harish-Chandra Mehrotra was born in Kanpur. He was educated at B.N.S.D. College, Kanpur and at the University of Allahabad. After receiving his master&#x27;s degree in physics in 1940, he moved to the Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore for further studies under Homi J. Bhabha.

In 1945, he moved to University of Cambridge, and worked as a research student under Paul Dirac. While at Cambridge, he attended lectures by Wolfgang Pauli, and during one of them, Mehrotra pointed out a mistake in Pauli&#x27;s work. The two became lifelong friends. During this time he became increasingly interested in mathematics. He obtained his PhD, &quot;Infinite Irreducible Representations of the Lorentz&quot; &quot;Group&quot;, at Cambridge in 1947 under Dirac.

==Honors and awards==

He was a member of the National Academy of Sciences and a Fellow of the Royal Society. He was the recipient of the Cole Prize of the American Mathematical Society, in 1954. The Indian National Science Academy honoured him with the Srinivasa Ramanujan Medal in 1974. In 1981, he received an honorary degree from Yale University.

The mathematics department of V.S.S.D. College, Kanpur celebrates his birthday every year in different forms, which includes lectures from students and professors from various colleges, institutes and students&#x27; visit to Harish-Chandra Research Institute.

The Indian Government named the Harish-Chandra Research Institute, an institute dedicated to Theoretical Physics and Mathematics, after him.

Robert Langlands wrote in a biographical article of Harish-Chandra:

He was also a recipient of the Padma Bhushan in 1977.

== Death ==
Starting in 1969, Mehrotra began to experience heart attacks. A second and third heart attack occurred in 1970 and 1982, respectively. From then, his physical capabilities began to decline. A fourth heart attack occurred in 1983, leaving him mostly bedridden and in isolation. On the day after a conference organized for him and mathematician Armand Borel took place, Mehrotra died from his final heart attack.

<text>Exo, stylized as exo and officially known as the &#x27; (, RTM; ), is a public transport system in Greater Montreal, including the Island of Montreal, Laval (Île Jésus), and communities along both the North Shore of the Mille-Îles River and the South Shore of the St. Lawrence River. It was created on June 1, 2017, taking over Montreal&#x27;s commuter rail services from the former &#x27; as well as bus and paratransit services from the various suburban municipal and intermunicipal transit agencies. Exo operates the second busiest such system in Canada after Toronto&#x27;s GO Transit.

Exo&#x27;s territory is concurrent with Montreal Metropolitan Community limits, with the addition of the Kahnawake First Nations reserve and the city of Saint-Jérôme. It serves a population of approximately 4 million people who make more than 174,000 trips daily in the area radiating from Montreal.

== History ==

A regional transit agency in Greater Montreal was first created by the Quebec government in 1995 with the , with the mandate of developing, coordinating and promoting transit throughout the area; improve and develop the commuter rail network, and; encourage integration of different modes of transit. On December 20, 1996, the AMT took over responsibility of the commuter trains from the Société de transport de la Communauté urbaine de Montréal (STCUM).

On June 1, 2017, the AMT was disbanded in a reorganization of metropolitan transit authorities. A new agency, the (RTM) was created to be responsible for operating commuter rail and suburban transit services.

In May 2018, the RTM adopted the Exo brand (stylized &quot;exo&quot;, all-lowercase), to represent the sub- and exurban nature of its service area.

==Partners in transport==
Exo&#x27;s parent agency, the (ARTM), is charged with transportation planning for the Greater Montreal area.

Exo operates commuter train service as well as the bus service outside of the three main population centres of Greater Montreal. In these areas service is provided by the on the Island of Montreal, the in Laval, and the for the urban agglomeration of Longueuil.

==Commuter rail==

== Fares ==

Exo services operate within the Autorité régionale de transport métropolitain (ARTM)&#x27;s integrated fare structure for Greater Montreal, which manages its fare schedule and fare zones.

In 2022 the ARTM began a multi-year program of updating and simplifying the fare schedule. Through this process, and as the Réseau express métropolitain replaced some train and bus services, certain legacy fares were retained and new transitional fares were created, with the objective of slowly raising prices over time to match the simplified fare structure and then ultimately be phased out — a process called (smoothing). As of July 2024, Exo commuter rail and certain bus sectors still have these unique fares.

== Buses ==

Exo runs multiple bus lines through its subsidiaries serving Montréal suburbs. 

Exo operates all commuter bus services for the North Shore and South Shore suburbs, excepting the cities of Longueuil and Laval, which have their own transit agencies.

== Ridership ==
In 2018, Exo carried 174,710 passengers on a typical weekday — 77,210 on the trains and 97,500 by commuter bus, including adapted transport.

<doc id="373198" wikidata="Q2038386" url="?curid=373198" title="Sotho–Tswana languages">
<text>The Sotho-Tswana languages are a group of closely related Bantu languages spoken in Southern Africa. 
The Sotho-Tswana group corresponds to the S.30 label in Guthrie&#x27;s 1967–71 classification of languages in the Bantu family.

The various dialects of Tswana, Southern Sotho and Northern Sotho are highly mutually intelligible. On more than one occasion, proposals have been put forward to create a unified standardisation and declare a Sotho-Tswana language.

== Languages ==

The group is divided into four main branches:
* Sotho-Tswana
**S.31
***Tswana (&quot;Setswana&quot;), with dialects: Fokeng, Hurutshe, Kgatla, Kwena, Lete, Ngwaketse, Ngwato, Rolong, Tawana, Tlhaping, Tlharo, and Tlokwa
**S.311 
***Kgalagadi, with dialects: Nuclear Kgalagadi (Kgalagadi proper), Balaongwe, Kenyi, Khakhae, Koma, Ngologa, Pedi, Phaleng, Rhiti, Shaga, and Siwane
**S.32
***Birwa
***Tswapong
***Northern Sotho (&quot;Sesotho sa Leboa&quot;), with dialects including Masemola (Masemula, Tau), Kgaga (Khaga, Kxaxa), Koni (Kone), Tswene (Tsweni), Gananwa (Hananwa, Xananwa), Pulana, Phalaborwa (Phalaburwa, Thephalaborwa), Khutswe (Khutswi, Kutswe), Lobedu (Khelobedu, Lovedu, Lubedu), Tlokwa (Dogwa, Tlokoa, Tokwa), Pai, Dzwabo (Thabine-Roka-Nareng), Kopa (Ndebele-Sotho), Matlala-Moletshi.
**S.33
***Southern Sotho or Sotho (&quot;SeSotho&quot;): Phuthi, Taung
Northern Sotho, which appears largely to be a taxonomic holding category for what is Sotho-Tswana but neither identifiably Southern Sotho nor Tswana, subsumes highly varied dialects including Pedi (&quot;Sepedi&quot;), Tswapo (&quot;Setswapo&quot;), Lovedu (&quot;Khilobedu&quot;), Pai and Pulana. Maho (2002) leaves the &quot;East Sotho&quot; varieties of Kutswe, Pai, and Pulana unclassified within Sotho-Tswana.

==Sample==

The Lord&#x27;s Prayer in the various Sotho-Tswana languages.

English: &quot;Our Father in heaven, hallowed be your name, your kingdom come, your will be done, on earth as it is in heaven.&quot;

<text>The National Sports Centre at Crystal Palace in south London, England is a large sports centre and outdoor athletics stadium. It was opened in 1964 in Crystal Palace Park, close to the site of the former Crystal Palace Exhibition building which had been destroyed by fire in 1936, and is on the same site as the former FA Cup Final venue which was used here between 1895 and 1914.

It was one of the five National Sports Centres, run on behalf of Sport England, but responsibility was transferred to the London Development Agency (now GLA Land and Property) and is managed by Greenwich Leisure Limited, under their Better brand logo.

The athletics stadium has a capacity of 15,500, which can be increased to 24,000 with temporary seating. It hosts international athletics meetings.

As well as sporting events, the stadium has played host to a number of live open air concerts, by artists such as Coldplay, Bruce Springsteen, Sex Pistols and Depeche Mode.

==Architecture==
The stadium is open to the air, and has a larger West Stand and a smaller Jubilee Stand (from 1977).

The indoor sports building was designed by the LCC Architects Department under project architect Norman Engleback between 1953–54 and is a Grade II* listed building. It has a particularly interesting interior: there is a central concourse with a complex and delicate exposed concrete frame supporting the roof, which has a folded teak lining. The &quot;wet&quot; side of the central aisle houses a series of pools, including a 50m competition pool, and a diving pool with a dramatic reinforced concrete diving platform. The &quot;dry&quot; side has a smaller sports arena used for basketball, gymnastics and other sports.

The listing from Historic England describes the building as &quot;exceptional in the breadth of its vision, not only in the range of facilities carefully planned within it but also in being intended to serve serious performers from all nations (there is separate residential accommodation in the park) as well as local enthusiasts.&quot;

A hexagonal tower and low-rise communal area next to the main building provided accommodation for 130 athletes.

Since 2020 the 50m pool and diving pool have been closed for repairs, which will be funded by the Greater London Authority.

==Sports==

===Athletics===
The current 15,500 seater athletics stadium was built on the site of the football ground by M J Gleeson and opened in 1964. From 1999 to 2012 it hosted the London Grand Prix. The stadium can be expanded to 24,000 with temporary seating if required.

===Beach Volleyball===
Sand from the Beach Volleyball Courts at Horse Guards Parade during London 2012 was donated to Crystal Palace National Sports Centre in 2012. There are three courts outside the indoor building.

===Football===

The current athletics stadium is on the same land as a previous football ground, which hosted the FA Cup final from 1895 to 1914 as well as other sports. In 1905, the owners wanted their own football club to play at the venue, so they formed Crystal Palace F.C.. The club were forced to leave by the military in 1915, and now play at nearby Selhurst Park.

The largest &#x27;domestic&#x27; attendance ever at the stadium was in the 1913 Cup final between Aston Villa and Sunderland, when 121,919 spectators squeezed into the stands. The previous world record had been the 1901 Cup Final, when 114,815 amassed to watch Tottenham Hotspur and Sheffield United draw 2–2, (Spurs won the replay at Burnden Park).

The 1970–71 WFA Cup (Women&#x27;s FA Cup) third-place match and final were held at the new stadium in 1971, the first final of the modern competition; it was won by Southampton Women.

In January 2011, the owners of Crystal Palace F.C. announced plans to relocate the club back to their original home at the site of the National Sports Centre, redeveloping it into a 40,000-seater, purpose-built football stadium. Tottenham Hotspur F.C. also released plans to redevelop the NSC into a 25,000-seater stadium, maintaining it as an athletics stadium, as part of their plans to redevelop the Olympic Stadium after the 2012 Summer Olympics and Paralympics. However, their plans were cancelled due to their failure to obtain the Olympic Stadium.

The now defunct football team AC London used the stadium for their home games in the club&#x27;s 2015–16 season. Croydon F.C. announced a temporary switch of home ground to Crystal Palace in 2020.

====International football matches====
* 3 April 1897 – England 1–2 Scotland
* 30 March 1901 – England 2–2 Scotland
* 1 April 1905 – England 1–0 Scotland
* 3 April 1909 – England 2–0 Scotland
* 4 March 1911 – England Amateurs 4–0 Belgium

====FA Cup Finals (1895–1914)====
21 teams competed in the twenty FA Cup Finals staged at Crystal Palace, with ten different winners. Four more teams won the FA Cup during this time, after replays at other grounds. Newcastle United appeared in the most finals at the ground, five, but never lifted the cup there, whilst Aston Villa won all four of their games there.




===Rugby===

On 2 December 1905, the ground also held the first England rugby union international match against New Zealand in England, New Zealand winning 15–0.

On Wednesday 18 August 1965, the ground was the venue of the rugby league match in which the Commonwealth XIII rugby league team were defeated 7–15 by New Zealand.

It also played host to Fulham Rugby League in the mid-1980s for a couple of seasons, after they were forced to leave their previous ground of Craven Cottage.

===Cricket===
London County Cricket Club was a short-lived cricket club founded by the Crystal Palace Company. In 1898 they invited W. G. Grace to help them form a first-class cricket club. Grace accepted the offer and became the club&#x27;s secretary, manager and captain. As a result, he severed his connection with Gloucestershire County Cricket Club during the 1899 season. The club played first-class matches from 1900 to 1904. Some of the best players of the time played some matches for the club while continuing to play for their usual teams, among them CB Fry, Johnny Douglas and K S Ranjitsinhji. However, the games were little more than exhibition games – and money-making exercises for Dr Grace – and so it quickly lost its first-class status, and with that the ability to attract the top players. The club folded in 1908.

===Basketball===

The 2,000 capacity indoor Arena at the National Sports Centre was also home to former British Basketball League team&#x27;s Crystal Palace and London Towers. Crystal Palace eventually merged into the London Towers organisation in 1998, whilst after great success domestically and in European competition the Towers ran into severe financial difficulties and folded its professional team in 2006. During its most successful period, Towers alternated between Crystal Palace and Wembley Arena as its home venues.

For the 2012–2013 season, the London Lions played the home games at Crystal Palace National Sports Centre until they moved to the brand new Copper Box in 2013.

From 2018, the Arena once more became a BBL venue when it was announced as the home of the new London City Royals franchise, the second London based franchise in the league.

===American Football===

The stadium hosted the 1989 National Championship Game for American Football, called the Budweiser Bowl, where the Manchester Spartans won the Great Britain National Championship by defeating the Birmingham Bulls by a score of 21 – 14. This National Championship Game was broadcast nationally on Channel 4. This was the height of the Great Britain – NFL relationship and partnership as the NFL supported the game, and the NFL commissioner and front office attended the game. The Cleveland Browns and the Philadelphia Eagles players and cheerleaders also attended, as they were the two teams who were playing the next day in the American Bowl at Wembley Stadium. The NFL&#x27;s Tex Schramm presented Spartan player/head coach Terry Smith with the National Championship Trophy at Wembley Stadium the next day.

The stadium also hosted the 1990 National Championship Game for American Football, called the Coca-Cola Bowl, where the Manchester Spartans repeated as the Champions of Great Britain, winning their second National Championship in a row by defeating the Northampton Storm by a score of 21–19. The NFL also attended the 1990 Great Britain Championship Game at Crystal Palace, as did the players and cheerleaders for the New Orleans Saints and the Los Angeles Raiders as they were the two teams playing in the American Bowl the next day at Wembley Stadium.

The Manchester Spartans second National Championship came only one week after the Spartans had won the European Club Championship in Italy when the Spartans defeated Dublin, Amsterdam, Berlin, and Milan to become the first British team to ever win the European Club Championship.

The player/head coach of the Manchester Spartans was Terry Smith, who also was the Great Britain National Team Head Coach. With Smith at the helm of the Great Britain National Team in 1989, and with 12 Spartans players playing for Great Britain, the Spartans players and coach led Great Britain to the European Nations Championship in 1989 by defeating France, Germany, and Finland by a combined score of 99 – 6 for Great Britain&#x27;s first European Championship for the Great Britain National Team.

The Sports Arena was also used by the London Monarchs, who also played some games at the stadium as England Monarchs before the team became defunct. The Monarchs were unfortunately never able to follow up on their title-winning success in the inaugural World League of American Football season of 1991, never again making it to another World Bowl, the playoffs, or even a second winning record. Their title defence never materialised, ending 1992 with a 2-7-1 tally; after a two-year league hiatus, four seasons from 1995 to 1998 in a revived league of six European cities garnered three straight 4-6 records, before bowing out with a 3–7.

The main stadium pitch is currently used by the London Olympians and is the home of the Great Britain Lions, the national American football team. The stadium played host to the 2011 Britbowl, the championship game of the British American Football League, which was won by the London Blitz.

===Motor racing===

Crystal Palace race circuit was located in Crystal Palace Park, the outline of the track can still be seen on maps providing access to the Crystal Palace National Sports Centre that is also located in the park.

The circuit opened in 1927 and the first race, for motorcycles, was on 21 May 1927. The circuit was 1 mile long, and ran on pre-existing paths through the park, including a loop past the lake. The surface had tarmac-covered bends, but the straights only had hard-packed gravel.

Improvements begun in December 1936 increased the circuit to 2 miles, and tarmac-covered the entire length. 20 cars entered the first London Grand Prix on 17 July 1937, a race eventually won by Prince Bira in his ERA R2B &quot;Romulus&quot; at an average speed of . Later that year, during the International Imperial Trophy meeting also won by Bira, the BBC broadcast the first ever televised motor racing.

With the outbreak of World War II, the park was taken over by the Ministry of Defence, and it would not be until 1953 that race meetings could take place again. The circuit had been reduced in length to 1.39 miles, bypassing the loop past the lake, and pressure from the local residents reduced motor sport in the park to five days a year. A variety of races took place at the circuit including sports cars, Formula Three, the London Trophy for Formula Two, and even non-championship Formula One races.

The last International meeting was in May 1972, the final lap record going to Mike Hailwood at an average speed of . The final meeting was held on 23 September 1972, but club events continued until 1974. Although the circuit no longer exists, it can be driven in the Grand Prix Legends historical motor racing simulation, for which it was recreated in detail. It was later converted to several other racing simulation programs.
Adjacent to the Olympic swimming pool exists a small race circuit for radio-controlled cars. The site is the home of the London Radio Car Club (LRCC).

The first British Motor Show (then known as the &#x27;London Motor Show&#x27;, which was one of the first of its kind in the world), was held at Crystal Palace in 1903. Organised by the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) it subsequently moved to Olympia for the next 32 years.

==== Reuse of circuit (1997–) ====

In 1997, the Sevenoaks &amp; District Motor Club started a series of sprint events using part of the old infield link, the main straight and north tower corner. The events lasted three years before being stopped due to park development work. Following discussions with the local council and the London Development Agency, sprint racing restarted at the park, with the two-day event held 30/31 May 2010. This event was repeated on the same or adjacent weekend each year, until 2017, when it was held on the August Bank Holiday weekend. The event was suspended in 2018 but took place in May 2019. It was scheduled to take place again in May 2020 and May 2021 but was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

==Tennis==
The Crystal Palace National Recreation Center as it was first called opened in 1964. A number of notable tennis tournaments were held their including;
*Dewar Cup Finals
*Rothmans European Trophy Indoor

===Professional Wrestling===

The Sports Centre’s indoor sports arena has played host to professional wrestling events beginning in May 2018, with American independent promotion Ring of Honor hosting the second show of their ‘Honor United’ UK Tour.

In 2022, Japanese promotion New Japan Pro Wrestling hosted Royal Quest II, which took place over two nights on the 1st and 2nd October and returned in October 2024 to host Royal Quest IV. These shows featured a mix of New Japan’s regular roster along with talent from &quot;Joshi&quot; (all female) partner promotion Stardom and British partner promotion Revolution Pro Wrestling (RevPro), who also assisted with production.

RevPro hosted two events of their own, Uprising in December 2023 and High Stakes: Ospreay vs Oku in February 2024. Both shows featured talent from New Japan, with Uprising also featuring talent from Mexican promotion CMLL and High Stakes featuring All Elite Wrestling (AEW) star Orange Cassidy as a surprise entrant in the opening match, with AEW CEO Tony Khan also in attendance. High Stakes’ main event was the final match for Will Ospreay as a regular fixture on the British independent wrestling scene before joining AEW full time. High Stakes drew the Sports Centre&#x27;s largest crowd for pro wrestling with over 3000 attendees.

== Crystal Palace Sports Arena ==

Crystal Palace Sports Arena was a proposed football stadium to be built in Crystal Palace Park, to replace Selhurst Park as the home stadium of Crystal Palace Football Club. It was announced in January 2011, as a redevelopment of the current Crystal Palace National Sports Centre, and was planned to be ready for the 2015–16 football season. Crystal Palace F.C. submitted plans to rebuild the stadium as a 40,000 seater football stadium without a running track, but with a new indoor aquatic and sports centre as part of the complex. A London Tramlink extension to the area was proposed to coincide with the completion of the stadium.

However, on 4 December 2017, Crystal Palace F.C. unveiled plans to redevelop Selhurst Park and expand its capacity to 34,000, which suggested they have now abandoned plans to redevelop the National Sports Centre.

<text>Aurelia aurita (also called the common jellyfish, moon jellyfish, moon jelly or saucer jelly) is a species of the family Ulmaridae. All species in the genus are very similar, and it is difficult to identify &quot;Aurelia&quot; medusae without genetic sampling; most of what follows applies equally to all species of the genus.

The jellyfish is almost entirely translucent, usually about in diameter, and can be recognized by its four horseshoe-shaped gonads, easily seen through the top of the bell. It feeds by collecting medusae, plankton, and mollusks with its tentacles, and bringing them into its body for digestion. It is capable of only limited motion, and drifts with the current, even when swimming.

The moon jelly differs from many jellyfish in that they lack long, potent stinging tentacles. Instead they have hundreds of short, fine tentacles that line the bell margin. The sting has no effect on humans.

== Distribution ==
The species &quot;Aurelia aurita&quot; is found in the North, Black, Baltic and Caspian Seas, Northeast Atlantic, Greenland, northeastern USA and Canada, Northwest Pacific and South America. In general, &quot;Aurelia&quot; is an inshore genus that can be found in estuaries and harbors.
&quot;Aurelia aurita&quot; lives in ocean water temperatures ranging from ; with optimum temperatures of . It prefers temperate seas with consistent currents. It has been found in waters with salinity as low as 6 parts per thousand.
The relation between summer hypoxia and moon jellyfish distribution is prominent during the summer months of July and August where temperatures are high and dissolved oxygen (DO) is low. Of the three environmental conditions tested, bottom DO has the most significant effect on moon jellyfish abundance. Moon jellyfish abundance is the highest when bottom dissolved oxygen concentration is lower than 2.0 mg L−1. Moon jellyfish show a strong tolerance to low DO conditions, which is why their population is still relatively high during the summer. Generally, hypoxia causes species to move from the oxygen depleted zone, but this is not the case for the moon jellyfish. Furthermore, bell contract rate, which indicates moon jellyfish feeding activity, remains constant although DO concentrations are lower than normal. During July and August, it is observed that moon jellyfish aggregations of 250 individuals consumed an estimated 100% of the mesozooplankton biomass in the Seto Inland Sea. Other major fish predators that are also present in these coastal waters do not seem to show the same high tolerance to low DO concentrations that the moon jellyfish exhibit. The feeding and predatory performance of these fish significantly decreases when DO concentrations are so low. This allows for less competition between the moon jellyfish and other fish predators for zooplankton. Low DO concentrations in coastal waters such as Tokyo Bay in Japan and the Seto Inland Sea prove to be advantageous for the moon jellyfish in terms of feeding, growth, and survival.

== Feeding ==
&quot;Aurelia aurita&quot; and other &quot;Aurelia&quot; species feed on plankton that includes organisms such as mollusks, crustaceans, tunicate larvae, rotifers, young polychaetes, protozoans, diatoms, eggs, fish eggs, and other small organisms. Occasionally, they are also seen feeding on gelatinous zooplankton such as hydromedusae and ctenophores. Both the adult medusae and larvae of &quot;Aurelia&quot; have nematocysts to capture prey and to protect themselves from predators.

The food is caught with its nematocyst-laden tentacles, tied with mucus, brought to the gastrovascular cavity, and passed into the cavity by ciliated action. There, digestive enzymes from serous cells break down the food. Little is known about the requirements for particular vitamins and minerals, but due to the presence of some digestive enzymes, we can deduce in general that &quot;A. aurita&quot; can process carbohydrates, proteins, and lipids.

== Body system ==

&quot;Aurelia&quot; does not have respiratory parts such as gills, lungs, or trachea; it respires by diffusing oxygen from water through the thin membrane covering its body. Within the gastrovascular cavity, low oxygenated water can be expelled and high oxygenated water can come in by ciliated action, thus increasing the diffusion of oxygen through the cell. The large surface area membrane to volume ratio helps &quot;Aurelia&quot; diffuse more oxygen and nutrients into the cells.

The basic body plan of &quot;Aurelia&quot; consists of several parts. The animal lacks respiratory, excretory, and circulatory systems. The adult medusa of &quot;Aurelia&quot;, with a transparent look, has an umbrella margin membrane and tentacles that are attached to the bottom. It has four bright gonads that are under the stomach. Food travels through the muscular manubrium while the radial canals help disperse the food. There is a middle layer of mesoglea, a gastrodervascular cavity with a gastrodermis, and an epidermis. There is a nerve net that is responsible for contractions in swimming muscles and feeding responses. Adult medusae can have diameters up to .

The medusae are either male or female. The young larval stage, a planula, has small ciliated cells and after swimming freely in the plankton for a day or more, settles on an appropriate substrate, where it changes into a special type of polyp called a &quot;scyphistoma&quot;, which divides by strobilation into small ephyrae that swim off to grow up as medusae. There is an increasing size from starting stage planula to ephyra, from less than 1 mm in the planula stage, up to about 1 cm in ephyra stage, and then to several cm in diameter in the medusa stage.

A 2015 study has found that &quot;A. aurita&quot; are capable of life cycle reversal where individuals grow younger instead of older, akin to the &quot;immortal jellyfish&quot; &quot;Turritopsis dohrnii&quot;.

There has been a study presenting that &quot;Aurelia&quot;″s body system is not significantly affected by artificial materials like microbeads, which can be found in cosmetic and personal care products. &quot;Aurelia aurita&quot; was able to recognize that microbeads were not food so there was not any physiological or histological harm.

== Predators ==

&quot;Aurelia aurita&quot; have high proportions of polyunsaturated fatty acids compared to other prey types and are a source of vital nutrients for predators. &quot;Aurelia aurita&quot; are known to be eaten by a wide variety of predators, including the ocean sunfish (&quot;Mola mola&quot;), the leatherback sea turtle (&quot;Dermochelys coriacea&quot;), the scyphomedusa &quot;Phacellophora camtschatica&quot;, and a very large hydromedusa (&quot;Aequorea victoria&quot;). In 2016, it was reported from the Red Sea that &quot;Aurelia aurita&quot; was seasonally preyed upon by two herbivorous fish. Moon jellies are also fed upon by sea birds, which may be more interested in the amphipods and other small arthropods that frequent the bells of &quot;Aurelia&quot;, but in any case, birds do some substantial amount of damage to these jellyfish that often are found just at the surface of bays. &quot;A. aurita&quot; has been suggested to have high mortality during the ephyra stage, which potentially affects the population size of the later medusa stage. While the main cause remains unknown, it is believed that they are consumed by one of three potential predatory filter-feeding sessile organisms: mussels, ascidians, and barnacles.

&quot;Aurelia&quot; jellyfish naturally die after living and reproducing for several months. It is probably rare for these moon jellies to live more than about six months in the wild, although specimens cared for in public aquarium exhibits typically live several to many years. In the wild, the warm water at the end of summer combines with exhaustive daily reproduction and lower natural levels of food for tissue repair, leaving these jellyfish more susceptible to bacterial and other disease problems that likely lead to the demise of most individuals. Such problems are responsible for the demise of many smaller species of jellyfish. In 1997, Arai summarized that seasonal reproduction leaves the gonads open to infection and degradation.

Some metazoan parasites attack &quot;Aurelia aurita&quot;, as well as most other species of jellyfish.

<doc id="373210" wikidata="Q654006" url="?curid=373210" title="Northern War of 1655–1660">
<text>The Northern War of 1655–1660, also known as the Second Northern War, First Northern War or Little Northern War, was fought between Sweden and its adversaries the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth (1655–60), the Tsardom of Russia (1656–58), Brandenburg-Prussia (1657–60), the Habsburg monarchy (1657–60) and Denmark–Norway (1657–58 and 1658–60). The Dutch Republic waged an informal trade war against Sweden and seized the colony of New Sweden in 1655, but was not a recognized part of the Polish–Danish alliance.

In 1655, Charles X Gustav of Sweden invaded and occupied western Poland–Lithuania, the eastern half of which was already occupied by Russia. The rapid Swedish advance became known in Poland as the Swedish Deluge. The Grand Duchy of Lithuania became a Swedish protectorate, the Polish–Lithuanian regular armies surrendered and the Polish king John II Casimir Vasa fled to the Habsburgs. Frederick William, Elector of Brandenburg and Duke of Prussia initially supported the estates in Royal Prussia, but allied with Sweden in return for receiving the Duchy of Prussia as a Swedish fief. Exploiting the hurt religious feelings of the Roman Catholic population under Protestant occupation and organizing Polish–Lithuanian military leaders in the Tyszowce Confederation, John II Casimir Vasa managed to regain ground in 1656. Russia took advantage of the Swedish setback, declared war on Sweden and pushed into Lithuania and Swedish Livonia.

Charles X Gustav then granted Frederick William full sovereignty in the Duchy of Prussia in return for military aid, and in the Treaty of Radnot allied himself with the Transylvanian George II Rákóczi who invaded Poland–Lithuania from the southeast. John II Vasa found an ally in Leopold I of Habsburg, whose armies crossed into Poland–Lithuania from the southwest. This triggered Frederick III of Denmark&#x27;s invasion of the Swedish mainland in early 1657, in an attempt to settle old scores from the Torstenson War while Sweden was busy elsewhere. Brandenburg left the alliance with Sweden when granted full sovereignty in the Duchy of Prussia by the Polish king in the treaties of Wehlau and Bromberg.

Frederick III&#x27;s war on Sweden gave Charles X Gustav a reason to abandon the Polish–Lithuanian deadlock and fight Denmark instead. After marching his army to the west and making a dangerous crossing of the frozen straits in the winter of 1657/58, he surprised the unprepared Frederick III on the Danish isles and forced him into surrender. In the Treaty of Roskilde, Denmark had to abandon all Danish provinces in what is now Southern Sweden. The anti-Swedish allies meanwhile neutralized the Transylvanian army and Polish forces ravaged Swedish Pomerania.

In 1658 Charles X Gustav decided that instead of returning to the remaining Swedish strongholds in Poland–Lithuania, he would rather attack Denmark again. This time, Denmark withstood the attack and the anti-Swedish allies pursued Charles X Gustav to Jutland and Swedish Pomerania. Throughout 1659, Sweden was defending her strongholds in Denmark and on the southern Baltic shore, while little was gained by the allies and a peace was negotiated. When Charles X Gustav died in February 1660, his successor settled for the Treaty of Oliva with Poland–Lithuania, the Habsburgs and Brandenburg in April and the Treaty of Copenhagen with Denmark in May. Sweden was to keep most of her gains from Roskilde, the Duchy of Prussia became a sovereign state, and otherwise, the parties largely returned to the status quo ante bellum. Sweden had already concluded a truce with Russia in 1658, which gave way to a final settlement in the Treaty of Cardis in 1661.

==Terminology==

In English language, German, Russian and Scandinavian historiography, these conflicts were traditionally referred to as First Northern War. The term &quot;Second Northern War&quot;, coined in Polish historiography (&quot;Druga Wojna Północna&quot;), has lately been increasingly adopted by German and English language historiography. Another ambiguous term referring to the Second Northern War is the Little Northern War, which however might also refer to the 1741–43 war. In Poland, the term &quot;The Deluge&quot; is also ambiguous, as it is sometimes used for a broader series of wars against Sweden, Brandenburg, Russia, Transylvania and the Cossacks.

==Prelude==

In 1648, the Peace of Westphalia had ended the Thirty Years&#x27; War, during which the Swedish Empire emerged as a major European power. In the Torstenson War, a theater of the Thirty Years&#x27; War, Sweden had defeated the former Baltic great power Denmark-Norway. Sweden had been at peace with Russia since the Treaty of Stolbovo had ended the Ingrian War in 1617. Sweden had remained in a state of war with the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth since the Polish–Swedish War (1626–29), which was concluded by the repeatedly renewed truce (Altmark, Stuhmsdorf).
In 1651, an unsuccessful congress was organised in Lübeck to mediate peace talks between Sweden and Poland-Lithuania. 
On the other hand, the Commonwealth, under king John II Casimir Vasa since 1648, experienced a crisis resulting both from the Cossack Khmelnytsky Uprising in the southeast and from the paralysis of the administration due to the internal quarrels of the nobility, including feuds between the king and the Lithuanian hetman Janusz Radziwiłł and feuds among disagreeing sejmiks who had been able to stall each other&#x27;s ambitions with the liberum veto since 1652. As a consequence, the Commonwealth lacked a sufficient defense.

In January 1654, the anti-Polish alliance of Pereiaslav was concluded between the rebellious Cossack Hetman Bohdan Khmelnytsky and Alexis of Russia, who was in control of a well-equipped army that was undergoing modernization. In 1654, when Charles X Gustav succeeded his cousin Christina on the Swedish throne, Russian forces were advancing into the unprotected Commonwealth, and by focusing on the northeast these drew close to the Swedish sphere of interest at the Baltic coast. Seeing the great success on the Russian side, Sweden also decided to intervene, among other reasons using the explanation that it was to protect the Protestant population in Poland. Having a close relationship with the Prince of Transylvania, Sweden had intentions to defeat Catholic Poland. Sweden also drew the rising Cossack Hetmanate to its side that stood in strong opposition to the Polish government and promised military support if the Cossacks would break with the Russians. Bohdan Khmelnytsky sent an expedition headed by the Kiev colonel to Halychyna which soon turned back due to mutiny within its ranks. The leader of the Hetmanate did not participate in the actions due to poor health conditions.

Sweden, at that time an expansionist empire with an army designed to be maintained by the revenues of occupied territory, was conscious that a direct attack on her main adversary Russia could well result in a Dano-Polish–Russian alliance. Also, Sweden was prevented from forming a Swedish–Polish alliance by the refusal of John II Casimir to drop his claims to the Swedish crown and the unwillingness of the Polish–Lithuanian nobility to make the territorial and political concessions an alliance with Sweden would eventually cost, final negotiations in Lübeck during February 1655 ended without a result. Thus, Sweden opted for a preemptive attack on the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth to occupy its yet available territories before the Russians.

==Swedish campaigns in the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth==
Swedish forces entered Poland–Lithuania from Swedish Pomerania in the west, and Livonia in the north. The division on the western flank consisted of 13,650 men and 72 artillery pieces commanded by Arvid Wittenberg who entered Poland on 21 July 1655 and another 12,700 to 15,000 commanded by Charles X Gustav who followed in August, while the division on the northern flank consisted of 7,200 men commanded by Magnus De la Gardie who had already seized Dünaburg with them on 12 July.

On the western front, Wittenberg was opposed by a Polish levy of 13,000 and an additional 1,400 peasant infantry. Aware of the military superiority of the well-trained Swedish army, the nobles of Greater Poland surrendered to Wittenberg on 25 July in Ujście after the Battle of Ujście, and then pledged loyalty to the Swedish king. Wittenberg established a garrison in Poznań (Posen). 
On the northern front, Prince Janusz Radziwiłł signed the Treaty of Kėdainiai with Sweden on 17 August 1655, placing the Grand Duchy of Lithuania under Swedish protection. Though Radziwiłł had been negotiating with Sweden before, during his dispute with the Polish king, Kėdainiai provided a clause stipulating that the two parts of the Commonwealth, Poland and Lithuania, need not fight each other. Part of the Lithuanian army opposed the treaty however, forming a confederation led by the magnate and Polish–Lithuanian hetman Paweł Jan Sapieha at Wierzbołów.

On 24 August, Charles X Gustav joined Wittenberg&#x27;s forces. The Polish king John II Casimir left Warsaw the same month to confront the Swedish army in the west, but after some skirmishes with the Swedish vanguard retreated southwards to Kraków. On 8 September Charles X Gustav occupied Warsaw, then turned south to confront the retreating Polish king. The kings met at the Battle of Żarnów on 16 September, which like the next encounter at the Battle of Wojnicz on 3 October was a victory for Sweden. John II Casimir was exiled to Silesia while Kraków surrendered to Charles X Gustav on 19 October.

On 20 October, a second treaty was ratified at Kėdainiai in the north. The Union of Kėdainiai unified Lithuania with Sweden, with Radziwiłł recognizing Charles X Gustav as Grand Duke of Lithuania. Over the following days, most of the Polish army surrendered to Sweden: on 26 October Koniecpolski surrendered with 5,385 men near Kraków, on 28 October Field Crown Hetman Stanisław Lanckoroński and Great Crown Hetman Stanisław &quot;Rewera&quot; Potocki surrendered with 10,000 men, and on 31 October the levy of Mazovia surrendered after the Battle of Nowy Dwór.
==Occupation of Poland–Lithuania and the Brandenburgian intervention==
Meanwhile, Russian and Cossack forces had occupied the east of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth as far as Lublin, with only Lwow (Lviv, Lemberg) remaining under Polish–Lithuanian control. In late October, Charles X Gustav headed northwards and left Wittenberg in Kraków with a mobile force of 3,000 Swedish and 2,000 Polish troops, and an additional number scattered in garrisons, to control the southern part of the Swedish-occupied commonwealth.

In the north, the Royal Prussian nobles concluded a defensive alliance with the Electorate of Brandenburg on 12 November in the Treaty of Rinsk, permitting Brandenburgian garrisons. Danzig (Gdansk), Thorn (Torun) and Elbing (Elblag) had not participated in the treaty, with Thorn and Elbing surrendering to Sweden. In the Treaty of Königsberg on 17 January 1656, Frederick William, Elector of Brandenburg and Duke of Prussia, took the Duchy of Prussia, formerly a Polish fief, as a fief from Charles X Gustav. The Brandenburgian garrisons in Royal Prussia were withdrawn, and when Marienburg (Malbork) surrendered in March, Danzig remained the only town not under Swedish control.

The rapid Swedish invasion and occupation of the Polish–Lithuanian territories became known in Poland as the &quot;(Swedish) deluge.&quot;

==Polish–Lithuanian recovery==

The &quot;deluge&quot; and religious differences between the primarily Protestant Swedes and the primarily Catholic Poles, resulting in cases of maltreatment and murder of Catholic clergy and monks as well as cases of looting of Catholic churches and monasteries, gave rise to some partisan movements in the Swedish-occupied territory. A guerilla force attacked a small Swedish garrison at Koscian in October 1655 and killed Frederick of Hesse, brother-in-law of the Swedish king. The Pauline monastery Jasna Góra in Częstochowa successfully resisted a Swedish siege throughout November 1655 to January 1656. On 20 November a manifesto was issued in Opole (Oppeln) calling for public resistance and the return of John II Casimir, and in December a peasant force took Nowy Sącz. On 29 December, the partisan Tyszowce Confederation was constituted under participation of Lanckoroński and Potocki, and on 1 January 1656 John II Casimir returned from exile. Later in January, Stefan Czarniecki joined in, and by February most Polish soldiers who were in Swedish service since October 1655, had switched sides to that of the confederation.

Charles X Gustav, with a force of 11,000 horse, reacted by pursuing Czarniecki&#x27;s force of 2,400 men, confronting and defeating him in the Battle of Gołąb in February 1656. Charles X Gustav then intended to take Lwow, but his advance was halted in the Battle of Zamość, when he was nearly encircled by the growing Polish–Lithuanian armies under Sapieha and Czarniecki, and barely escaped on 5 and 6 April breaking through Sapieha&#x27;s lines during the Battle of Sandomierz at the cost of his artillery and baggage. A Swedish relief force under Frederick of Baden-Durlach was destroyed by Czarniecki on 7 April in the Battle of Warka. In the same month, John II Casimir with the Lwów Oath proclaimed Virgin Mary queen of Poland, and promised to lift the burdens inflicted on the peasantry if he regained control.

==Brandenburgian-Swedish alliance and Russia&#x27;s war on Sweden==

On 25 June 1656, Charles X Gustav signed an alliance with Brandenburg: the Treaty of Marienburg granted Greater Poland to Frederick William in return for military aid. While the Brandenburgian elector was free of Swedish vassalage in Greater Poland, he remained a Swedish vassal for the Duchy of Prussia. Brandenburgian garrisons then replaced the Swedish ones in Greater Poland, who went to reinforce Charles X Gustav&#x27;s army. On 29 June however, Warsaw was stormed by John II Casimir, who had drawn up to Charles X Gustav with a force of 28,500 regulars and a noble levy of 18,000 to 20,000. Thereupon, Brandenburg actively participated in the war on the Swedish side, prompting John II Casimir Vasa to state that while his Tartars already had the Swedes for breakfast, he would now take Frederick William into custody, where neither sun nor moon would shine.

Already in May 1656, Alexis of Russia had declared war on Sweden, taking advantage of Charles being tied up in Poland, and Livonia, Estonia and Ingria secured only by a Livonian army of 2,200 infantry and 400 dragoons, Magnus de la Gardie&#x27;s 7,000 men in Prussia, and 6,933 men dispersed in garrisons along the Eastern Baltic coast. Alexis invaded Livonia in July with 35,000 men and took Dünaburg.

In late July, Danzig was reinforced by a Dutch garrison, and a combined Danish and Dutch fleet broke the naval blockage imposed on Danzig by Charles X Gustav. On 28–30 July, a combined Brandenburgian-Swedish army was able to defeat the Polish–Lithuanian army in the Battle of Warsaw, forcing John II Casimir to retreat to Lublin. In August, Alexis&#x27; army took Livonian Kokenhausen (Koknese), laid siege to Riga and Dorpat (Tartu) and raided Estonia, Ingria and Kexholm.

On 4 October, John II Casimir stormed Łęczyca in Greater Poland before heading for Royal Prussia, and on 8 October, Wincenty Korwin Gosiewski with 12,000 to 13,000 Lithuanian and Crimean Tartar cavalry overran a Brandenburgian-Swedish force in the Battle of Prostken in Ducal Prussia. Gosiewski then ravaged Ducal Prussia, burning 13 towns and 250 villages, in a campaign that entered folklore because of the high death toll and the high number of captives deported to the Crimea.

On 22 October, Gosiewski was defeated by Swedish forces in the Battle of Filipów and turned to Lithuania. Also on 22 October, besieged Dorpat surrendered to Alexis, while the Russian siege of Swedish-held Riga was lifted. John II Casimir meanwhile took Bromberg (Bydgoszcz) and Konitz in Royal Prussia, and from 15 November 1656 until February 1657 stayed in Danzig, where a Swedish siege had to be lifted due to Dutch intervention, just 55 kilometers away from Charles X Gustav&#x27;s quarters in Elbing.

==Swedish–Brandenburgian–Transylvanian–Romanian alliance and the truces with Russia==
In the Treaty of Labiau on 20 November, Charles X Gustav of Sweden granted Frederick William of Brandenburg full sovereignty in the Duchy of Prussia in return for a more active participation in the war. In the Treaty of Radnot on 6 December, Charles X Gustav promised to accept George II Rákóczi of Transylvania as king of Poland and Grand Duke of Lithuania in return for his entrance into the war. Rákóczi entered the war in January 1657, crossing into the commonwealth with a force of 25,000 Transylvanian-Wallachian-Moldavian men and 20,000 Cossacks who reinforced Kraków before they met with Charles X Gustav, who had led a Swedish-Brandenburgian army southwards. The following month saw the Swedish-Brandenburg-Transylvanian-Romanian-Cossack forces play cat and mouse with the Polish–Lithuanian forces, moving about all of the commonwealth without any major engagements, except the capture of Brest by Charles X Gustav in May, and the capture of Warsaw by Rákóczi and Gustaf Otto Stenbock on 17 June.

Due to internal conflicts within the Cossacks there was practically no participation of the Cossack Hetmanate in that war. Worn out from previous campaigns and requesting Bohdan Khmelnytsky to break with Sweden, Alexis of Russia eventually signed the Truce of Vilna or Niemież with the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, and did not engage the Swedish army in any major battle throughout 1657 even though he still reinforced his armies in Livonia. On 18 June, a Swedish force defeated a Russian army of 8,000 men commanded by Matvey V. Sheremetev in the Battle of Walk, however, a month later it was defeated by the Russians near Gdov, after that the actions were in the nature of mutual raids. In early 1658, Sweden and Russia agreed on a truce, resulting in the Treaty of Valiesar (Vallisaare, 1658) and the Treaty of Kardis (Kärde, 1661). The Russian war with Poland–Lithuania on the other hand resumed in 1658.

==Austro–Brandenburgian–Polish alliance, Danish campaigns in Sweden==
Like Sweden, John II Casimir was also looking for allies to break the deadlock of the war. On 1 December 1656, he signed an alliance with Ferdinand III of Habsburg in Vienna, essentially a declaration of Ferdinand III&#x27;s intend to mediate a peace rather than provide military aid, which did not come into effect until Ferdinand&#x27;s death on 2 April 1657. The treaty was however renewed and amended on 27 May by Ferdinand&#x27;s successor Leopold I of Habsburg, who agreed in Vienna to provide John II Casimir with 12,000 troops maintained at Polish expense; in return, Leopold received Kraków and Posen in pawn. Receiving the news, Frederick III of Denmark promptly declared war on Sweden, and by June the Austrian army entered the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth from the south, immediately stabilizing the situation in southern Poland by conquering Kraków, while Denmark attacked Swedish Bremen-Verden and turned to Jämtland and Västergötland in July.

When Charles X Gustav left the Commonwealth and headed westwards for an anti-Danish counterstrike, the Swedish–Brandenburgian–Transylvanian alliance broke apart. Rákóczi of Transylvania was unable to withstand the combined Austrian and Polish–Lithuanian forces without Swedish support, and after a pursuit into Ukraine he was encircled and forced to capitulate, with the rest of the Transylvanian army defeated by the Tartars.

Brandenburg changed sides in return for Polish withdrawal of claims to Ducal Prussia, declaring Frederick William the sole sovereign in the Duchy with the treaties of Wehlau on 19 September and Bromberg on 6 November. In addition, the aforementioned treaties secured Brandenburg the Lands of Lauenburg and Bütow at the border of Brandenburgian Pomerania, while the Bishopric of Ermeland was returned to Poland.

==Denmark–Norway and Pomerania==

The attack of Frederick III of Denmark in June 1657, aimed at regaining the territories lost in 1645, provided an opportunity for Charles X Gustav to abandon the unfortunate Polish–Lithuanian battlefields. With 9,950 horse and 2,800 foot, he marched through Pomerania and Mecklenburg. In Holstein, the Swedish force was split with Carl Gustaf Wrangel heading west to clear Bremen-Verden and Charles X Gustav heading north to clear Jutland. When these aims were achieved, Charles X Gustav in September moved to the Swedish port of Wismar and ordered his navy into the inconclusive Battle of Møn.

Meanwhile, Polish forces led by general Stefan Czarniecki ravaged southern Swedish Pomerania, and destroyed and plundered Pasewalk, Gartz (Oder) and Penkun. The Habsburg and Brandenburg allies however were reluctant to join Czarniecki, and against John II Casimir&#x27;s wish decided against taking the war to the Holy Roman Empire fearing the start of a new Thirty Years&#x27; War.

The harsh winter of 1657/58 had forced the Dano-Norwegian fleet to stay in port, and the Great and Little Belts separating the Danish isles from the mainland were frozen. After entering Jutland from the south, a Swedish army of 7,000 veterans undertook the March across the Belts; on 9 February 1658, the Little Belt was crossed and the island Funen (Fyn) captured within a few days, and soon thereafter Langeland, Lolland and Falster. On 25 February, the Swedish army continued across the Great Belt to Zealand where the Danish capital Copenhagen is located. Although only 5,000 men made it across the belts, the Swedish attack was completely unexpected; Frederick III was compelled to surrender and signed the disadvantageous Treaty of Roskilde on 26 February 1658.

Sweden had won its most prestigious victory, and Denmark had suffered its most costly defeat. Denmark was forced to yield the provinces of Scania, Halland, Blekinge and the island of Bornholm. Halland had already been under Swedish control since the signing of the Treaty of Brömsebro in 1645, but they now became Swedish territory indefinitely. Denmark also had to surrender the Norwegian province Trøndelag to Sweden.

Yet, Swedish-held territory in Poland had been reduced to some towns in Royal Prussia, most notably Elbing, Marienburg and Thorn. With Transylvania neutralized and Brandenburg defected, Charles X Gustav&#x27;s position in the region was not strong enough to force his stated aim, the permanent gain of Royal Prussia. He was further pressed militarily when an Austro-Polish army laid siege to Thorn in July 1658, and diplomatically when he was urged by France to settle. France was unwilling to intervene militarily, and Sweden could not afford to violate the Peace of Westphalia by attacking the Habsburg and Brandenburgian possessions in the Holy Roman Empire, which would likely have driven several Germans into the anti-Swedish alliance. Thus, Charles X Gustav opted to instead attack Denmark again.

When the Danes stalled and prolonged the fulfillment of some provisions of the Treaty of Roskilde by postponing payments and not blocking foreign fleets from access to the Baltic Sea, and with half of the 2,000 Danish soldiers that were obliged by Roskilde to enter Swedish service deserting, the Swedish king embarked from Kiel with a force of 10,000 men on 16 August. While everyone expected him to head for Royal Prussia, he disembarked on Zealand on 17 August, and headed for Copenhagen, which was defended by 10,650 Danes and 2,000 Dutch. This time however, the town did not surrender, and a long siege ensued. When Swedish forces took Kronborg in September, they controlled both sides of the Øresund, yet in November a Dutch fleet broke the Swedish naval blockade of Copenhagen in the Battle of the Sound.

Meanwhile, the anti-Swedish alliance had deployed an army to Denmark, to confront Charles X Gustav with a force of 14,500 Brandenburgers commanded by Frederick William, 10,600 Austrians commanded by Raimondo Montecuccoli, and 4,500 Poles commanded by Czarniecki. By January 1659, the allied forces stood at Fredriksodde, Kolding and Als. Charles X Gustav then tried a decisive assault on Copenhagen on 21 and 22 February, but was repelled.

==Sweden entrenched==
In 1659, the war was characterized by Swedish forces defending their strongholds on the southern Baltic coast against allied assaults. A combined force of 17,000 Austrians and 13,000 Brandenburgers led by general Jean-Louis Raduit de Souches invaded Swedish Pomerania, took and burned Greifenhagen, took Wollin island and Damm, besieged Stettin and Greifswald without success, but took Demmin on 9 November. Counterattacks were mounted by general Müller von der Lühnen, who lifted the siege laid on Greifswald by the Brandenburgian prince-elector, and major general Paul Wirtz, who from besieged Stettin managed to capture the Brandenburgian ammunition depot at Curau and took it to Stralsund. The Brandenburgians withdrew ravaging the countryside while retreating.

In the occupied and annexed Danish provinces, guerilla movements pressed Swedish garrisons. After an uprising, Norwegians took Trondheim in late 1658. In Scania and Zealand, the &quot;&quot;snaphaner&quot; led by Lorenz Tuxen and Svend Poulsen (&quot;Gøngehøvdingen&quot;&quot;) ambushed Swedish forces. The Swedish garrison of Bornholm was forced to surrender to Danish insurgents, with the commander killed.

In Royal Prussia (Eastern Pomerania in contemporary Poland), Thorn had fallen already in December 1658, but Elbing and Marienwerder withstood. On 24 November, Sweden had to abandon Funen and Langeland after the defeat in the Battle of Nyborg. In January 1660, Sweden lost the Livonian fortress Mitau.

Meanwhile, conflicts arose within the anti-Swedish alliance between the Habsburgs and Poland–Lithuania when the Habsburgs demanded ever more contributions while not showing the war efforts Poland–Lithuania had expected. With the Russo-Polish War ongoing, most Polish–Lithuanian forces were tied up in Ukraine. England, France and the Dutch Republic had agreed on a petition in the First Concert of the Hague, urging Sweden to settle for peace with Denmark on the terms of Roskilde, and peace talks mediated by France were taking place throughout 1659.

== North American theatre ==

The colony of New Sweden lay along the Delaware River, a territory claimed but not settled by Dutch New Netherland. The Swedish colonists were the preferred trading partners of the Susquehannock, who at that time were the most powerful indigenous group in the Susquehanna River valley and rivals to the Iroquois Confederacy further north. The Iroquois in turn were allies of the Dutch.

The Dutch–Polish alliance in Europe left its mark in New Netherland. Among the small Polish community in New Amsterdam was Daniel Liczko, a military officer who took part in an expedition to erect a fort in Swedish territory in 1651. Director-General Peter Stuyvesant named the outpost Fort Casimir after the Polish king, but it was captured and renamed Fort Trinity (Swedish: &quot;Trefaldigheten&quot;) by Swedish governor Johan Risingh in May 1654. Following the outbreak of the Second Northern War in Europe, Stuyvesant retaliated. In the summer of 1655, he dispatched most of the colonial garrison to the Delaware River and led a squadron of ships to attack New Sweden. The Dutch recaptured Fort Trinity on 11 September and besieged the Swedish capital at Fort Christina for ten days before Risingh surrendered on 15 September. This effectively marked the end of New Sweden, but for a time the Swedish and Finnish settlers continued to enjoy local autonomy with their own militia, religion, court and lands. Sweden had no further territorial presence in the Americas until the acquisition of Saint Barthélemy from France in 1784.

On 15 September, while the bulk of the Dutch garrison was still in New Sweden, 500 Munsee occupied New Amsterdam in what in known as the Peach War. No bloodshed occurred until the Dutch opened fire as the Munsee were preparing to depart. In response the Munsee attacked Pavonia and Staten Island. Stuyvesant later reported 40 deaths and 100 captives taken. Many Dutch settlers from outlying farms took refuge at Fort Amsterdam.

The cause of the Peach War has been the subject of debate. The armed protest and raids may have been triggered by the murder of a Munsee woman who was stealing peaches from the orchard of a Dutch colonist. Many historians, however, have speculated that the Peach War was orchestrated by the Susquehannock in response to the Dutch attack on New Sweden.

After renegotiating land rights and securing the release of the hostages, the Dutch resettled most of their abandoned territory and constructed several additional fortifications. Stuyvesant decreed that &quot;like our neighbors of New England,&quot; the New Netherland colonists must now &quot;concentrate themselves... in the form of towns, villages and hamlets, so that they may be the more effectually protected&quot; against future attacks. Notably, the Staten Island colony was not reoccupied for several years. Its patroon was Cornelis Melyn, former chairman of the Council of Eight Men and a political rival of Stuyvesant; he had been imprisoned without trial earlier in the year. Melyn and his family defected to English New Haven soon after his release.

==Peace==
Charles X Gustav fell ill in early 1660 and died on 23 February of that year. With his death, one of the major obstacles to peace was gone and the Treaty of Oliva was signed on 23 April. Sweden was accepted as sovereign in Swedish Livonia, Brandenburg was accepted as sovereign in Ducal Prussia, and John II Casimir withdrew his claims to the Swedish throne, though he was to retain the title for life. All occupied territories were restored to their pre-war sovereigns.

However, Denmark was not keen on peace after its recent successes and witnessing the weakness of the Swedish efforts. The Dutch Republic withdrew its blockade but was soon convinced by Denmark to support them again. France and England intervened for Sweden and the situation again teetered on the edge of a major conflict. However, the Danish statesman Hannibal Sehested negotiated a peace treaty without any direct involvement by foreign powers. The conflict was resolved with the Treaty of Copenhagen (1660). Sweden returned Bornholm and Trøndelag to Denmark. The treaty of 1660 established political borders between Denmark, Sweden and Norway which have lasted to the present day, and secured the Swedish &quot;dominium maris baltici&quot;.

Russia, still engaged in the Russo-Polish War (1654–1667), settled its dispute with Sweden in the Treaty of Cardis, which restored Russian-occupied Swedish territory to Sweden.

<text>Crystal Palace is an interchange station between the Windrush line of the London Overground and National Rail services operated by Southern, situated in the London Borough of Bromley in south London. It is located in the Anerley area between the town centres of Crystal Palace and Penge, from . It is one of two stations built to serve the site of the 1851 exhibition building, the Crystal Palace, when it was moved from Hyde Park to Sydenham Hill after 1851.

The station was opened on 10 June 1854 by the West End of London and Crystal Palace Railway (WEL&amp;CPR) to take the crowds to the relocated Palace. It was formerly known as Crystal Palace (Low Level) to differentiate it from the nearby and now largely demolished Crystal Palace (High Level) railway station.

The station serves Southern trains running between London Bridge and London Victoria in addition to services terminating at Beckenham Junction and West Croydon. Since 23 May 2010, the station has also been a southern terminus of the Windrush line of the London Overground. This has been the catalyst for plans for a substantial redevelopment of the station.

==History==

From the outset trains were operated by the London, Brighton and South Coast Railway (LBSCR). Initially the station was the terminus of a spur line from Sydenham. In 1856 the station was able to take through train services to Wandsworth via West Norwood and Streatham Hill, following the completion of the 746 yard (690 m) Crystal Palace Tunnel. Although relatively short, the tunnel was regarded as a major engineering achievement as it was cut &quot;through the same treacherous material [clay], through the hill on which the Crystal Palace stands, and immediately under one of the great water towers, a superincumbent weight of 2,200 tons which taxed in its execution all the skill and workmanship of the eminent contractors.&quot;

In 1857, an eastward connection was made to (for the Brighton line to the south) and in 1858 the WEL&amp;CPR was extended as far as Beckenham. From 1860 direct services were extended to London Victoria.

As originally constructed, the station contained three island platforms, arranged to provide two terminal bay platforms and two through lines with platforms on either side. By the 1890s the central island had been removed and replaced by carriage sidings.

The frontage of the station was rebuilt in 1875, and was described: &quot;Although the Roman Catholic chapel room is no longer used the station still has a cathedral-like atmosphere as one passes from the period booking hall to the vault-like station and the stairs down to the original station area&quot;.

This is a description of the station trainshed roof above the staircases at the west end. Originally the whole length of the platforms beyond the bottom of the massive staircases was covered by an elegant dual bow-spring arch iron roof. This was removed as a precautionary measure shortly after the collapse of the similar structure at Charing Cross in 1905.

In 1905–08, Crystal Palace station was included in a proposal for an unusual new form of underground railway, the &quot;Kearney High-Speed Tube&quot;, devised by the Australian-born engineer Elfric Wells Chalmers Kearney. He envisaged the construction of a tunnel which would run from Crystal Palace to in north-west London, with a branch line terminating at Strand. It was to be operated with an unusual monorail system patented by Kearney which would be powered by gravity, like a type of underground roller coaster. Kearney failed to attract support for his scheme and the line was never built.

The line was electrified between Balham and Crystal Palace on 12 May 1911, using the LBSCR overhead system, in time for the Festival of Empire coinciding with the coronation of King George V. Electric trains from Victoria were advertised to complete the journey in fifteen minutes – a running time that has never been equalled.

The station is built on the junction of two lines: the original station platforms lying on the Sydenham route, and the later platforms on the southern spur to Norwood Junction and Beckenham Junction.

Following the fire in 1936 which destroyed the Crystal Palace, passenger numbers fell and most services through the station were diverted to serve London-Croydon routes rather than running along the London Bridge-Victoria loop. The southern platforms became the busier pair and the entrance to the station was moved to the south side of the building in the 1980s. A glazed ticket hall, which echoed the profile of the Crystal Palace with its arched roof structure, was constructed at this time on the southern flank of the Victorian building.

The two outer bay platforms, which were used by terminating trains, were abandoned in the 1970s and the third rail was removed, although the track and buffers were left in place. The southern bay was brought back into use in May 2010 as part of the East London line development.

The original station was partially refurbished in 2002 by Railtrack at a cost of £4 million. This included a substantial amount of work on the roof of the building and refurbishment of office space on the top floor.

==Station redevelopment for East London line==
To accommodate the additional East London line services (now the Windrush line), and to provide disabled access to all platforms of the station, substantial works were required at the station. A planning application was submitted to Bromley Council in February 2009, for alterations to the Victorian booking hall building, removal of the current ticket office, removal of the pedestrian bridge over platforms 1 and 2 and new stairs to platform 1, but funding constraints meant that this work had not started before East London line services started calling at the station in 2010.

London Overground trains terminate in either the southern (formerly disused) bay platform 3, or a new bay platform 5, part of the reinstated central platform which has been built over the site of the removed sidings, in the centre of the old station. The two through lines serve platform 4 (previously platform 3) and platform 6, the north side face of the new central island. The former platform 4 is no longer in public use, and while at the time of the East London line service commencing it still had its platform furniture and information displays, these have since been removed.

Refurbishment work funded by Transport for London started in 2012. The original Victorian booking hall was reopened on 24 September 2012 along with a new cafe in an adjacent part of the station building. The 1980s booking hall addition was demolished in October 2012.

Three lifts have been installed to improve accessibility within the station. These give access to all platforms - there are two levels below the refurbished Victorian ticket hall. Refurbishment and improvement works were completed on 26 March 2013.

Transport for London were also proposing to extend Tramlink from Harrington Road through Anerley to the bus station on Crystal Palace Parade. However, Mayor Boris Johnson cancelled the £170 million project in November 2008.

A new roof was built covering the four Northern platforms in 2015.

== Connections ==
London Buses routes 157, 249, 358, 410, 432 and night route N3 serve the station.

== Platforms ==
The platform arrangement at Crystal Palace is as follows:

*Platform 1 is used for northbound Southern services to London Victoria via Streatham Hill and westbound Southern services to London Bridge via Tulse Hill.
*Platform 2 is used for southbound Southern services to West Croydon (terminating at Norwood Junction in the evening) and Beckenham Junction.
*Platform 3 is used for Windrush line (London Overground) northbound services to Highbury &amp; Islington via New Cross Gate.
*Platform 4 is used for westbound Southern services to London Victoria via Streatham Hill.
*Platform 5 is mainly used for Windrush line (London Overground) northbound services to Highbury &amp; Islington via New Cross Gate.
*Platform 6 is used for eastbound Southern services to London Bridge via Forest Hill.

==Services==

Crystal Palace is a southern terminus of the Windrush line of the London Overground, with services operated using EMUs. Additional services at Crystal Palace are operated by Southern using EMUs.

The typical off-peak service in trains per hour is:

* 4 tph to 
* 4 tph to (2 of these run via and 2 run via )
* 4 tph to via (Windrush line)
* 2 tph to 
* 2 tph to 

During the evenings, the services between London Victoria and West Croydon do not run and the services between London Bridge and Beckenham Junction are reduced to hourly.

On Sundays, the services between London Bridge and Beckenham Junction do not run.

<text>Social research is research conducted by social scientists following a systematic plan. Social research methodologies can be classified as quantitative and qualitative.

* Quantitative designs approach social phenomena through quantifiable evidence, and often rely on statistical analyses of many cases (or across intentionally designed treatments in an experiment) to create valid and reliable general claims.
* Qualitative designs emphasize understanding of social phenomena through direct observation, communication with participants, or analyses of texts, and may stress contextual subjective accuracy over generality.

Most methods contain elements of both. For example, qualitative data analysis often involves a fairly structured approach to coding raw data into systematic information and quantifying intercoder reliability. There is often a more complex relationship between &quot;qualitative&quot; and &quot;quantitative&quot; approaches than would be suggested by drawing a simple distinction between them.

Social scientists employ a range of methods in order to analyze a vast breadth of social phenomena: from analyzing census survey data derived from millions of individuals, to conducting in-depth analysis of a single agent&#x27;s social experiences; from monitoring what is happening on contemporary streets, to investigating historical documents. Methods rooted in classical sociology and statistics have formed the basis for research in disciplines such as political science and media studies. They are also often used in program evaluation and market research.

==Methods==

Social scientists are divided into camps of support for particular research techniques. These disputes relate to the historical core of social theory (positivism and antipositivism; structure and agency). While very different in many aspects, both qualitative and quantitative approaches involve a systematic interaction between theory and data. The choice of method often depends largely on what the researcher intends to investigate. For example, a researcher concerned with drawing a statistical generalization across an entire population may administer a survey questionnaire to a representative sample population. By contrast, a researcher who seeks full contextual understanding of an individual&#x27;s social actions may choose ethnographic participant observation or open-ended interviews. Studies will commonly combine, or &quot;triangulate&quot;, quantitative &quot;and&quot; qualitative methods as part of a multi-strategy design.

==Sampling==

Typically a population is very large, making a census or a complete enumeration of all the values in that population infeasible. A sample thus forms a manageable subset of a population. In positivist research, statistics derived from a sample are analysed in order to draw inferences regarding the population as a whole. The process of collecting information from a sample is referred to as &quot;sampling&quot;. Sampling methods may be either random (random sampling, systematic sampling, stratified sampling, cluster sampling) or non-random/nonprobability (convenience sampling, purposive sampling, snowball sampling). The most common reason for sampling is to obtain information about a population. Sampling is quicker and cheaper than a complete census of a population.

==Methodological assumptions==

Social research is based on logic and empirical observations. Charles C. Ragin writes in his &quot;Constructing Social Research&quot; book that &quot;Social research involved the interaction between ideas and evidence. Ideas help social researchers make sense of evidence, and researchers use evidence to extend, revise and test ideas.&quot; Social research thus attempts to create or validate theories through data collection and data analysis, and its goal is exploration, description, explanation, and prediction. It should never lead or be mistaken with philosophy or belief. Social research aims to find social patterns of regularity in social life and usually deals with social groups (aggregates of individuals), not individuals themselves (although science of psychology is an exception here). Research can also be divided into pure research and applied research. Pure research has no application on real life, whereas applied research attempts to influence the real world.

There are no laws in social science that parallel the laws in natural science. A law in social science is a universal generalization about a class of facts. A fact is an observed phenomenon, and observation means it has been seen, heard or otherwise experienced by researcher. A theory is a systematic explanation for the observations that relate to a particular aspect of social life. Concepts are the basic building blocks of theory and are abstract elements representing classes of phenomena. Axioms or postulates are basic assertions assumed to be true. Propositions are conclusions drawn about the relationships among concepts, based on analysis of axioms. Hypotheses are specified expectations about empirical reality derived from propositions. Social research involves testing these hypotheses to see if they are true.

Social research involves creating a theory, operationalization (measurement of variables) and observation (actual collection of data to test hypothesized relationship). Social theories are written in the language of variables, in other words, theories describe logical relationships between variables. Variables are logical sets of attributes, with people being the &quot;carriers&quot; of those variables, for example, gender can be a variable with two or more attributes: male, female and non-binary gender. 

Variables are also divided into independent variables (data) that influences the dependent variables (which scientists are trying to explain). For example, in a study of how different dosages of a drug are related to the severity of symptoms of a disease, a measure of the severity of the symptoms of the disease is a dependent variable and the administration of the drug in specified doses is the independent variable. Researchers will compare the different values of the dependent variable (severity of the symptoms) and attempt to draw conclusions.

==Guidelines for &quot;good research&quot;==

When social scientists speak of &quot;good research&quot; the guidelines refer to how the science is mentioned and understood. It does not refer to how what the results are but how they are figured. Glenn Firebaugh summarizes the principles for good research in his book &quot;Seven Rules for Social Research&quot;. The first rule is that &quot;There should be the possibility of surprise in social research.&quot; As Firebaugh (p. 1) elaborates: &quot;Rule 1 is intended to warn that you don&#x27;t want to be blinded by preconceived ideas so that you fail to look for contrary evidence, or you fail to recognize contrary evidence when you do encounter it, or you recognize contrary evidence but suppress it and refuse to accept your findings for what they appear to say.&quot;

In addition, good research will &quot;look for differences that make a difference&quot; (Rule 2) and &quot;build in reality checks&quot; (Rule 3). Rule 4 advises researchers to replicate, that is, &quot;to see if identical analyses yield similar results for different samples of people&quot; (p. 90). The next two rules urge researchers to &quot;compare like with like&quot; (Rule 5) and to &quot;study change&quot; (Rule 6); these two rules are especially important when researchers want to estimate the effect of one variable on another (e.g. how much does college education actually matter for wages?). The final rule, &quot;Let method be the servant, not the master,&quot; reminds researchers that methods are the means, not the end, of social research; it is critical from the outset to fit the research design to the research issue, rather than the other way around.

Explanations in social theories can be idiographic or nomothetic. An idiographic approach to an explanation is one where the scientists seek to exhaust the idiosyncratic causes of a particular condition or event, i.e. by trying to provide all possible explanations of a particular case. Nomothetic explanations tend to be more general with scientists trying to identify a few causal factors that impact a wide class of conditions or events. For example, when dealing with the problem of how people choose a job, idiographic explanation would be to list all possible reasons why a given person (or group) chooses a given job, while nomothetic explanation would try to find factors that determine why job applicants in general choose a given job.

Research in science and in social science is a long, slow and difficult process that sometimes produces false results because of methodological weaknesses and in rare cases because of fraud, so that reliance on any one study is inadvisable.

==Ethics==
The ethics of social research are shared with those of medical research. In the United States, these are formalized by the Belmont report as:

===Respect for persons===

The principle of respect for persons holds that (a) individuals should be respected as autonomous agents capable of making their own decisions, and that (b) subjects with diminished autonomy deserve special considerations. A cornerstone of this principle is the use of informed consent.

===Beneficence===

The principle of beneficence holds that (a) the subjects of research should be protected from harm, and, (b) the research should bring tangible benefits to society. By this definition, research with no scientific merit is automatically considered unethical.

===Justice===

The principle of justice states the benefits of research should be distributed fairly. The definition of fairness used is case-dependent, varying between &quot;(1) to each person an equal share, (2) to each person according to individual need, (3) to each person according to individual effort, (4) to each person according to societal contribution, and (5) to each person according to merit.&quot;

==Foundations of social research==

===Sociological positivism===
The origin of the survey can be traced back at least early as the Domesday Book in 1086, while some scholars pinpoint the origin of demography to 1663 with the publication of John Graunt&#x27;s &quot;Natural and Political Observations upon the Bills of Mortality&quot;. Social research began most intentionally, however, with the positivist philosophy of science in the early 19th century.
Statistical sociological research, and indeed the formal academic discipline of sociology, began with the work of Émile Durkheim (1858–1917). While Durkheim rejected much of the detail of Auguste Comte&#x27;s philosophy, he retained and refined its method, maintaining that the social sciences are a logical continuation of the natural ones into the realm of human activity, and insisting that they may retain the same objectivity, rationalism, and approach to causality. Durkheim set up the first European department of sociology at the University of Bordeaux in 1895, publishing his &quot;Rules of the Sociological Method&quot; (1895). In this text he argued: main goal is to extend scientific rationalism to human conduct. ... What has been called our positivism is but a consequence of this rationalism.&quot;

Durkheim&#x27;s seminal monograph, &quot;Suicide&quot; (1897), a case study of suicide rates among Catholic and Protestant populations, distinguished sociological analysis from psychology or philosophy. By carefully examining suicide statistics in different police districts, he attempted to demonstrate that Catholic communities have a lower suicide rate than that of Protestants, something he attributed to social (as opposed to individual or psychological) causes. He developed the notion of objective &quot;suis generis&quot; &quot;social facts&quot; to delineate a unique empirical object for the science of sociology to study. Through such studies he posited that sociology would be able to determine whether any given society is &quot;healthy&quot; or &quot;pathological&quot;, and seek social reform to negate organic breakdown or &quot;social anomie&quot;. For Durkheim, sociology could be described as the &quot;science of institutions, their genesis and their functioning&quot;.

===Modern methodologies===
In the early 20th century innovation in survey methodology were developed that are still dominant. In 1928, the psychologist Louis Leon Thurstone developed a method to select and score multiple items with which to measure complex ideas, such as attitudes towards religion. In 1932, the psychologist Rensis Likert developed the Likert scale where participants rate their agreement with statement using five options from totally disagree to totally agree. Likert like scales remain the most frequently used items in survey.

In the mid-20th century there was a general—but not universal—trend for American sociology to be more scientific in nature, due to the prominence at that time of action theory and other system-theoretical approaches. Robert K. Merton released his &quot;Social Theory and Social Structure&quot; (1949). By the turn of the 1960s, sociological research was increasingly employed as a tool by governments and businesses worldwide. Sociologists developed new types of quantitative and qualitative research methods. Paul Lazarsfeld founded Columbia University&#x27;s Bureau of Applied Social Research, where he exerted a tremendous influence over the techniques and the organization of social research. His many contributions to sociological method have earned him the title of the &quot;founder of modern empirical sociology&quot;. Lazarsfeld made great strides in statistical survey analysis, panel methods, latent structure analysis, and contextual analysis. Many of his ideas have been so influential as to now be considered self-evident.

<doc id="373216" wikidata="Q2982293" url="?curid=373216" title="Kahan summation algorithm">
<text>In numerical analysis, the Kahan summation algorithm, also known as compensated summation, significantly reduces the numerical error in the total obtained by adding a sequence of finite-precision floating-point numbers, compared to the naive approach. This is done by keeping a separate &quot;running compensation&quot; (a variable to accumulate small errors), in effect extending the precision of the sum by the precision of the compensation variable.

In particular, simply summing formula_1 numbers in sequence has a worst-case error that grows proportional to formula_1, and a root mean square error that grows as formula_3 for random inputs (the roundoff errors form a random walk). With compensated summation, using a compensation variable with sufficiently high precision the worst-case error bound is effectively independent of formula_1, so a large number of values can be summed with an error that only depends on the floating-point precision of the result.

The algorithm is attributed to William Kahan; Ivo Babuška seems to have come up with a similar algorithm independently (hence Kahan–Babuška summation). Similar, earlier techniques are, for example, Bresenham&#x27;s line algorithm, keeping track of the accumulated error in integer operations (although first documented around the same time) and the delta-sigma modulation.

==The algorithm==
In pseudocode, the algorithm will be:

 function KahanSum(input)
 // Prepare the accumulator.
 var sum = 0.0
 // A running compensation for lost low-order bits.
 var c = 0.0
 // The array &quot;input&quot; has elements indexed input[1] to input[input.length].
 for i = 1 to input.length do
 // &quot;c&quot; is zero the first time around.
 var y = input[i] - c
 // Alas, &quot;sum&quot; is big, &quot;y&quot; small, so low-order digits of &quot;y&quot; are lost. 
 var t = sum + y
 // &quot;(t - sum)&quot; cancels the high-order part of &quot;y&quot;;
 // subtracting &quot;y&quot; recovers negative (low part of &quot;y&quot;)
 c = (t - sum) - y
 // Algebraically, &quot;c&quot; should always be zero. Beware
 // overly-aggressive optimizing compilers!
 sum = t
 // Next time around, the lost low part will be added to &quot;y&quot; in a fresh attempt.
 next i
 return sum

This algorithm can also be rewritten to use the Fast2Sum algorithm:

 function KahanSum2(input)
 // Prepare the accumulator.
 var sum = 0.0
 // A running compensation for lost low-order bits.
 var c = 0.0
 // The array &quot;input&quot; has elements indexed 
 for i = 1 to input.length do
 // &quot;c&quot; is zero the first time around.
 var y = input[i] + c
 // &quot;sum&quot; + &quot;c&quot; is an approximation to the exact sum.
 (sum,c) = Fast2Sum(sum,y)
 // Next time around, the lost low part will be added to &quot;y&quot; in a fresh attempt.
 next i
 return sum

===Worked example===
The algorithm does not mandate any specific choice of radix, only for the arithmetic to &quot;normalize floating-point sums before rounding or truncating&quot;. Computers typically use binary arithmetic, but to make the example easier to read, it will be given in decimal. Suppose we are using six-digit decimal floating-point arithmetic, codice_1 has attained the value 10000.0, and the next two values of codice_2 are 3.14159 and 2.71828. The exact result is 10005.85987, which rounds to 10005.9. With a plain summation, each incoming value would be aligned with codice_1, and many low-order digits would be lost (by truncation or rounding). The first result, after rounding, would be 10003.1. The second result would be 10005.81828 before rounding and 10005.8 after rounding. This is not correct.

However, with compensated summation, we get the correctly rounded result of 10005.9.

Assume that codice_4 has the initial value zero. Trailing zeros shown where they are significant for the six-digit floating-point number.
 y = 3.14159 - 0.00000 &quot;y = input[i] - c&quot;
 t = 10000.0 + 3.14159 &quot;t = sum + y&quot;
 = 10003.14159 Normalization done, next round off to six digits.
 = 10003.1 Few digits from &quot;input[i]&quot; met those of &quot;sum&quot;. Many digits have been lost!
 c = (10003.1 - 10000.0) - 3.14159 &quot;c = (t - sum) - y&quot; (Note: Parenthesis must be evaluated first!)
 = 3.10000 - 3.14159 The assimilated part of &quot;y&quot; minus the original full &quot;y&quot;.
 = -0.0415900 Because &quot;c&quot; is close to zero, normalization retains many digits after the floating point. 
 sum = 10003.1 &quot;sum = t&quot;

The sum is so large that only the high-order digits of the input numbers are being accumulated. But on the next step, codice_4, an approximation of the running error, counteracts the problem.
 y = 2.71828 - (-0.0415900) Most digits meet, since &quot;c&quot; is of a size similar to &quot;y&quot;.
 = 2.75987 The shortfall (low-order digits lost) of previous iteration successfully reinstated.
 t = 10003.1 + 2.75987 But still only few meet the digits of &quot;sum&quot;.
 = 10005.85987 Normalization done, next round to six digits.
 = 10005.9 Again, many digits have been lost, but &quot;c&quot; helped nudge the round-off.
 c = (10005.9 - 10003.1) - 2.75987 Estimate the accumulated error, based on the adjusted &quot;y&quot;.
 = 2.80000 - 2.75987 As expected, the low-order parts can be retained in &quot;c&quot; with no or minor round-off effects.
 = 0.0401300 In this iteration, &quot;t&quot; was a bit too high, the excess will be subtracted off in next iteration.
 sum = 10005.9 Exact result is 10005.85987, &quot;sum&quot; is correct, rounded to 6 digits.

The algorithm performs summation with two accumulators: codice_1 holds the sum, and codice_4 accumulates the parts not assimilated into codice_1, to nudge the low-order part of codice_1 the next time around. Thus the summation proceeds with &quot;guard digits&quot; in codice_4, which is better than not having any, but is not as good as performing the calculations with double the precision of the input. However, simply increasing the precision of the calculations is not practical in general; if codice_11 is already in double precision, few systems supply quadruple precision, and if they did, codice_11 could then be in quadruple precision.

==Accuracy==

A careful analysis of the errors in compensated summation is needed to appreciate its accuracy characteristics. While it is more accurate than naive summation, it can still give large relative errors for ill-conditioned sums.

Suppose that one is summing formula_1 values formula_6, for formula_7. The exact sum is
: formula_8 (computed with infinite precision).
With compensated summation, one instead obtains formula_9, where the error formula_10 is bounded by
: formula_11
where formula_12 is the machine precision of the arithmetic being employed (e.g. formula_13 for IEEE standard double-precision floating point). Usually, the quantity of interest is the relative error formula_14, which is therefore bounded above by
: formula_15

In the expression for the relative error bound, the fraction formula_16 is the condition number of the summation problem. Essentially, the condition number represents the &quot;intrinsic&quot; sensitivity of the summation problem to errors, regardless of how it is computed. The relative error bound of &quot;every&quot; (backwards stable) summation method by a fixed algorithm in fixed precision (i.e. not those that use arbitrary-precision arithmetic, nor algorithms whose memory and time requirements change based on the data), is proportional to this condition number. An &quot;ill-conditioned&quot; summation problem is one in which this ratio is large, and in this case even compensated summation can have a large relative error. For example, if the summands formula_6 are uncorrelated random numbers with zero mean, the sum is a random walk, and the condition number will grow proportional to formula_3. On the other hand, for random inputs with nonzero mean the condition number asymptotes to a finite constant as formula_19. If the inputs are all non-negative, then the condition number is 1.

Given a condition number, the relative error of compensated summation is effectively independent of formula_1. In principle, there is the formula_21 that grows linearly with formula_1, but in practice this term is effectively zero: since the final result is rounded to a precision formula_12, the formula_24 term rounds to zero, unless formula_1 is roughly formula_26 or larger. In double precision, this corresponds to an formula_1 of roughly formula_28, much larger than most sums. So, for a fixed condition number, the errors of compensated summation are effectively formula_29, independent of formula_1.

In comparison, the relative error bound for naive summation (simply adding the numbers in sequence, rounding at each step) grows as formula_31 multiplied by the condition number. This worst-case error is rarely observed in practice, however, because it only occurs if the rounding errors are all in the same direction. In practice, it is much more likely that the rounding errors have a random sign, with zero mean, so that they form a random walk; in this case, naive summation has a root mean square relative error that grows as formula_32 multiplied by the condition number. This is still much worse than compensated summation, however. However, if the sum can be performed in twice the precision, then formula_12 is replaced by formula_34, and naive summation has a worst-case error comparable to the formula_35 term in compensated summation at the original precision.

By the same token, the formula_36 that appears in formula_10 above is a worst-case bound that occurs only if all the rounding errors have the same sign (and are of maximal possible magnitude). In practice, it is more likely that the errors have random sign, in which case terms in formula_36 are replaced by a random walk, in which case, even for random inputs with zero mean, the error formula_10 grows only as formula_32 (ignoring the formula_24 term), the same rate the sum formula_42 grows, canceling the formula_3 factors when the relative error is computed. So, even for asymptotically ill-conditioned sums, the relative error for compensated summation can often be much smaller than a worst-case analysis might suggest.

==Further enhancements==
Neumaier introduced an improved version of Kahan algorithm, which he calls an &quot;improved Kahan–Babuška algorithm&quot;, which also covers the case when the next term to be added is larger in absolute value than the running sum, effectively swapping the role of what is large and what is small. In pseudocode, the algorithm is:
 function KahanBabushkaNeumaierSum(input)
 var sum = 0.0
 var c = 0.0 // A running compensation for lost low-order bits.
 for i = 1 to input.length do
 var t = sum + input[i]
 if |sum| &gt;= |input[i]| then
 c += (sum - t) + input[i] // If &quot;sum&quot; is bigger, low-order digits of &quot;input[i]&quot; are lost.
 else
 c += (input[i] - t) + sum // Else low-order digits of &quot;sum&quot; are lost.
 endif
 sum = t
 next i
 return sum + c // Correction only applied once in the very end.

This enhancement is similar to the Fast2Sum version of Kahan&#x27;s algorithm with Fast2Sum replaced by 2Sum.

For many sequences of numbers, both algorithms agree, but a simple example due to Peters shows how they can differ: summing formula_44 in double precision, Kahan&#x27;s algorithm yields 0.0, whereas Neumaier&#x27;s algorithm yields the correct value 2.0.

Higher-order modifications of better accuracy are also possible. For example, a variant suggested by Klein, which he called a second-order &quot;iterative Kahan–Babuška algorithm&quot;. In pseudocode, the algorithm is:

 function KahanBabushkaKleinSum(input)
 var sum = 0.0
 var cs = 0.0
 var ccs = 0.0
 for i = 1 to input.length do
 var c, cc
 var t = sum + input[i]
 if |sum| &gt;= |input[i]| then
 c = (sum - t) + input[i]
 else
 c = (input[i] - t) + sum
 endif
 sum = t
 t = cs + c
 if |cs| &gt;= |c| then
 cc = (cs - t) + c
 else
 cc = (c - t) + cs
 endif
 cs = t
 ccs = ccs + cc
 end loop 
 return sum + (cs + ccs)

==Alternatives==
Although Kahan&#x27;s algorithm achieves formula_45 error growth for summing &quot;n&quot; numbers, only slightly worse formula_46 growth can be achieved by pairwise summation: one recursively divides the set of numbers into two halves, sums each half, and then adds the two sums. This has the advantage of requiring the same number of arithmetic operations as the naive summation (unlike Kahan&#x27;s algorithm, which requires four times the arithmetic and has a latency of four times a simple summation) and can be calculated in parallel. The base case of the recursion could in principle be the sum of only one (or zero) numbers, but to amortize the overhead of recursion, one would normally use a larger base case. The equivalent of pairwise summation is used in many fast Fourier transform (FFT) algorithms and is responsible for the logarithmic growth of roundoff errors in those FFTs. In practice, with roundoff errors of random signs, the root mean square errors of pairwise summation actually grow as formula_47.

Another alternative is to use arbitrary-precision arithmetic, which in principle need no rounding at all with a cost of much greater computational effort. A way of performing correctly rounded sums using arbitrary precision is to extend adaptively using multiple floating-point components. This will minimize computational cost in common cases where high precision is not needed.
Another method that uses only integer arithmetic, but a large accumulator, was described by Kirchner and Kulisch; a hardware implementation was described by Müller, Rüb and Rülling.

==Possible invalidation by compiler optimization==
In principle, a sufficiently aggressive optimizing compiler could destroy the effectiveness of Kahan summation: for example, if the compiler simplified expressions according to the associativity rules of real arithmetic, it might &quot;simplify&quot; the second step in the sequence
: codice_13
: codice_14
to
: codice_15
and then to
: codice_16
thus eliminating the error compensation. In practice, many compilers do not use associativity rules (which are only approximate in floating-point arithmetic) in simplifications, unless explicitly directed to do so by compiler options enabling &quot;unsafe&quot; optimizations, although the Intel C++ Compiler is one example that allows associativity-based transformations by default. The original K&amp;R C version of the C programming language allowed the compiler to re-order floating-point expressions according to real-arithmetic associativity rules, but the subsequent ANSI C standard prohibited re-ordering in order to make C better suited for numerical applications (and more similar to Fortran, which also prohibits re-ordering), although in practice compiler options can re-enable re-ordering, as mentioned above.

A portable way to inhibit such optimizations locally is to break one of the lines in the original formulation into two statements, and make two of the intermediate products volatile:
 function KahanSum(input)
 var sum = 0.0
 var c = 0.0
 for i = 1 to input.length do
 var y = input[i] - c
 volatile var t = sum + y
 volatile var z = t - sum
 c = z - y
 sum = t
 next i
 return sum

==Support by libraries==
In general, built-in &quot;sum&quot; functions in computer languages typically provide no guarantees that a particular summation algorithm will be employed, much less Kahan summation. The BLAS standard for linear algebra subroutines explicitly avoids mandating any particular computational order of operations for performance reasons, and BLAS implementations typically do not use Kahan summation.
The standard library of the Python computer language specifies an fsum function for accurate summation. Starting with Python 3.12, the built-in &quot;sum()&quot; function uses the Neumaier summation.

In the Julia language, the default implementation of the codice_1 function does pairwise summation for high accuracy with good performance, but an external library provides an implementation of Neumaier&#x27;s variant named codice_18 for the cases when higher accuracy is needed.

In the C# language, HPCsharp nuget package implements the Neumaier variant and pairwise summation: both as scalar, data-parallel using SIMD processor instructions, and parallel multi-core.

<doc id="373221" wikidata="Q573515" url="?curid=373221" title="Anthony Lake">
<text>William Anthony Kirsopp Lake (born April 2, 1939) is an American diplomat and political advisor who served as the 17th United States National Security Advisor from 1993 to 1997 and as the sixth Executive Director of UNICEF from 2010 to 2017.

Lake has been a foreign policy advisor to many Democratic U.S. presidents and presidential candidates, and served as National Security Advisor under U.S. President Bill Clinton from 1993 to 1997. Lake is credited as being one of the individuals who developed the policy that led to the resolution of the Bosnian War. He also held the chair of Distinguished Professor in the Practice of Diplomacy at the Edmund A. Walsh School of Foreign Service at Georgetown University, in Washington, D.C.

==Early life==
Lake is the grandson of Kirsopp Lake, a member of the Church of England clergy who moved to the United States from Oxford, England, in 1914, to teach New Testament studies at Harvard. Lake&#x27;s father, Gerard Kirsopp Lake, was a New Deal Democrat, and his mother, Eleanor (née van Someren Hard), a Republican.

Lake himself was born in New York City. He attended Middlesex School and Harvard College, graduating with a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1961. Lake studied international economics at Trinity College, Cambridge for two years and later received a PhD from the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs at Princeton University in 1974 after completing a doctoral dissertation titled &quot;Caution and concern: the making of American policy toward South Africa, 1946-1971.&quot; He later (in 2001) co-edited a festschrift for his Princeton mentor, Richard H. Ullman.

Lake was good friends with Richard Holbrooke whom he met in Vietnam while both of them were in the foreign service. They frequently visited each other and Lake aided Holbrooke throughout the early years of his career. They grew apart when Holbrooke had an affair with Lake&#x27;s wife. Although this did not initially end their companionship, they rarely spoke, and by the time Lake became National Security Advisor, their friendship was over.

==Career==
Lake joined the State Department in 1962, serving until 1970 as a Foreign Service Officer. Lake was an assistant to Ambassador Henry Cabot Lodge Jr. during the Vietnam War. His State Department career included assignments as consul at the U.S. Embassy in Saigon, South Vietnam (1963), vice consul in Huế (1964–1965) and special assistant to the assistant to the president for national security affairs (1969–1970) in the Nixon administration. In 1969, he accompanied National Security Advisor Henry Kissinger on his first secret meeting with North Vietnamese negotiators in Paris. In 1970, he had a falling-out with Kissinger over the Nixon administration&#x27;s Cambodian Campaign and left the State Department as a result. He later wrote a book critical of Kissinger&#x27;s approach to Africa.

Lake worked for Democratic U.S. Senator Edmund Muskie of Maine in his 1972 presidential campaign. After Muskie lost the nomination to George McGovern, Lake served briefly at the Carnegie Endowment and International Voluntary Services before returning to serve as Director of Policy Planning under Jimmy Carter (1977–1981).

After Carter lost the 1980 election to Ronald Reagan, Lake became the Five College Professor of International Relations chair in Massachusetts (1981–1992), teaching first at Amherst College. In 1984, he moved to Mount Holyoke College, where he taught courses on the Vietnam War, Third World revolutions, and American foreign policy. (He left Mount Holyoke College in 1993 to become National Security Advisor from 1993 to 1997.) Among his protegees at Mount Holyoke was his student research assistant Mona Sutphen who would later serve in the Barack Obama White House as Deputy Chief of Staff for Policy. In 1997, he became Distinguished Professor in the Practice of Diplomacy at Georgetown University, until accepting his position with UNICEF.

During the 1992 presidential campaign, he was one of Clinton&#x27;s chief foreign policy advisers. Lake later served as National Security Advisor (1993–1997). In the aftermath of the Cold War, Lake advocated a policy of &quot;enlargement&quot; of the number free market democracies. Told by the White House to sell his stocks in energy companies when he took the office in 1993, Lake did not do so. When Clinton decided in 1994 to allow Iran to arm the Bosnian army, Lake admitted he made a mistake when he didn&#x27;t push to inform Congress of the decision.

===Director of Central Intelligence nomination===
Following Clinton&#x27;s 1996 re-election, he nominated Lake to become the Director of Central Intelligence, but his nomination was withdrawn due to Republican opposition. It has also been reported that the failure of his nomination was related to his decision to withdraw support at the last minute for an Iraqi coup that might have removed Saddam Hussein without U.S. intervention. However, others have speculated that Lake&#x27;s nomination &quot;failed, in part, because Lake stated in a television interview that he was not sure if Alger Hiss was guilty.&quot;
After the withdrawal of his CIA nomination, Lake became White House Special Envoy (1998–2000). As special envoy Lake mediated the drafting of the Algiers Agreement, ending the Eritrean-Ethiopian War.

Lake co-founded Intellibridge Corporation in 2000 with David Rothkopf. In 2005 the assets of Intellibridge were acquired by the Eurasia Group.

Lake was a foreign policy adviser for Barack Obama&#x27;s 2008 presidential campaign, having endorsed him over Senator Hillary Clinton, whom he had worked alongside during the Clinton administration. Lake was considered a potential Secretary of State until Senator Clinton was named to the position.

===UNICEF===
On March 16, 2010, Lake was named by United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki-moon as the next Executive Director of the United Nations Children&#x27;s Fund (UNICEF), following his nomination by U.S. President Barack Obama.

On April 30, 2010, he officially entered the post, succeeding Ann Veneman, a former U.S. Secretary of Agriculture. On May 2, 2014, he was reappointed Executive Director of UNICEF by United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and served through the end of 2017.

At UNICEF, he was active at effort to refocus investment towards the most disadvantaged children, and reducing child mortality.

==Other activities==
Lake was an advisory board member for the Partnership for a Secure America, a not-for-profit organization dedicated to recreating the bipartisan center in American national security and foreign policy. He has also served as chair on the boards of the United States Fund for UNICEF and the Marshall Legacy Institute. He also is serving a term from 2005-2010 on the Mount Holyoke College Board of Trustees.

For many years Lake served on the Board of Trustees for St. Mary&#x27;s College of Maryland. He played key roles in the establishment of the Center for the Study of Democracy at the college, where he also served on the advisory board.

==Religion==

Lake was raised in the Congregational Church, but recounts that he &quot;embarked on his spiritual journey as a young man,&quot; first converting to the Episcopal Church. However, since then he had &quot;long been drawn to Judaism,&quot; and &quot;began to feel strongly that I wanted to be part of that community.&quot; He ultimately converted to Judaism in 2005, before marrying Julie T. Katzman, currently the Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer of the Inter-American Development Bank. He credits Katzman&#x27;s religious faith as the impetus responsible for his decision to investigate his attraction to Judaism more fully, and began studying with former Navy Chaplain Rabbi Arnold Resnicoff (who was serving with him on the Board of Trustees of the Carnegie Council for Ethics in International Affairs) for a full year before his conversion. Later, Resnicoff officiated at his marriage to Katzman.

However, Lake jokes that he was Jewish in the eyes of others well before his formal conversion. First, in 1997, when news broke that Secretary of State Madeleine Albright had discovered that she had Jewish ancestors, and a story about other Jews in the Administration mistakenly reported that Clinton&#x27;s &quot;entire national security team was Jewish.&quot; Based on that news story, Lake recounts, his name was added to the list used by the White House Liaison to the Jewish community, and Lake began to receive invitations to special events, such as the White House Hanukkah Party—and he says he was delighted to accept those invitations. The second time was two years later, when a 1999 &quot;Washington Post&quot; story described a new release of Watergate tapes of conversations between President Richard Nixon and H.R. Haldeman, his Chief of Staff. Those tapes included a conversation where Nixon asks if Lake is Jewish, and Haldeman responds, &quot;Well, I&#x27;m not so sure, but he looks Jewish.&quot; Based on these tapes, Lake has said that, &quot;Now I can trace my [Jewish] heritage all the way back to Nixon!&quot;

==Personal life==

Lake was married to Antonia Plehn from 1962 to 1995; they had three children.

In 2000, Lake began a relationship with investment banker Julie Katzman. They married in 2005, and Lake converted to Judaism the same year.

<text>Sir Ninian Martin Stephen (15 June 1923 – 29 October 2017) was an English-born Australian judge who served as the 20th governor-general of Australia, in office from 1982 to 1989. He was previously a justice of the High Court of Australia from 1972 to 1982.

Stephen was born in England to Scottish parents. As a child he lived for periods in France, Germany, Scotland, and Switzerland, eventually arriving in Australia at the age of 16. Stephen served with the Australian Army during World War II, and after the war entered the legal profession. He became one of Australia&#x27;s leading constitutional lawyers. Stephen was appointed to the Supreme Court of Victoria in 1970, and then to the High Court in 1972, aged 48. He was considered a member of the court&#x27;s &quot;moderate centre&quot;. In 1982, Stephen was appointed governor-general on the recommendation of Malcolm Fraser. He approved two double dissolutions during his time in office, the only governor-general to do so. After his term expired, Stephen remained active in public life as a conservationist and member of various international tribunals. He died at the age of 94, making him Australia&#x27;s longest-lived governor-general.

==Early life==
Stephen was born in Nettlebed, Oxfordshire, England, to Scottish parents, Barbara (née Cruickshank) and Frederick Brown Stephen. His father, a chauffeur, poultry farmer and motorcycle courier in World War I, left the family shortly after his birth, emigrating to Canada and starting a new family; his son was told that he had died, and did not learn the truth until 2003. Stephen&#x27;s mother, formerly a lady&#x27;s maid was a paid companion for Nina Mylne, the wealthy heiress of the Queensland pastoralist Graham Mylne; his given name was in her honour. During his early childhood, the three of them lived for periods in Switzerland (Geneva where he was christened and Montreaux), France (Paris, Cannes, and Saint-Cast-le-Guildo) and Germany (Wiesbaden), where Mylne took him to Nuremberg for the 1938 Reichsparteitag Grossdeutschland (5-12 September) which he photographed. They eventually moved to Edinburgh in 1929 so Stephen could begin his formal schooling.

Mylne paid for Stephen&#x27;s education, which took place in Scotland (George Watson&#x27;s College and Edinburgh Academy), London (St Paul&#x27;s School), and Switzerland (Chillon College, Montreux). He and Mylne generally traveled together, while his mother remained in Scotland and ran a boardinghouse. In 1940, the three of them moved to Melbourne to avoid the war, booking first into the Oriental Hotel then taking a flat in Linden Hall opposite Scotch College which Stephen attended for two terms, and was then accepted into the University of Melbourne to study law.

==Second World War==
In December 1941, following the end of his first year at university, Stephen enlisted in the Citizens Military Force to serve part-time in the Melbourne University Regiment. Following Japan&#x27;s entry into World War II, Stephen completed full-time military training from 8 December 1941 to 15 February 1942 and was then posted to the 10th Field Regiment, Royal Australian Artillery, serving in Western Australia. He subsequently transferred to the Second Australian Imperial Force. In late 1943, Stephen transferred to the Royal Australian Engineers, serving in New Guinea from April to August 1944 with the 43rd Australian Water Transport Company. He then attended courses, culminating in a commissioning course in April 1945. As a lieutenant, he served in the 41st Australian Landing Craft Company in New Guinea and New Britain. In August 1945, he was posted to Labuan, Borneo, arriving after the war&#x27;s end and serving there until January 1946. After returning to Australia, he was discharged on 5 February 1946.

==Legal career==
Stephen completed his studies after the war&#x27;s end, and was admitted to the Victorian Bar in 1949. By the 1960s, he had become one of Australia&#x27;s leading constitutional and commercial lawyers. He was made a Queen&#x27;s Counsel in 1966.

==Judicial career==
On 30 June 1970, Stephen was appointed as a judge of the Supreme Court of Victoria. He held this position until 29 February 1972, relinquishing it to take up his appointment as a justice of the High Court of Australia. He was sworn of the Privy Council of the United Kingdom in 1979 and sat as a member of its Judicial Committee.

Although Stephen was appointed to the High Court by a Liberal government, he proved not to be a traditional conservative upholder of states&#x27; rights. He joined the &quot;moderate centre&quot; of the court, between the arch-conservatism of Sir Garfield Barwick and the radicalism of Lionel Murphy. In 1982 he was part of the majority that decided on a broad interpretation of the &quot;external affairs power&quot; of the Australian constitution in the &quot;Koowarta v Bjelke-Petersen&quot; case.

==Governor-general==
In March 1982, Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser announced that Queen Elizabeth II had approved his recommendation of Sir Ninian Stephen to succeed Sir Zelman Cowen as Governor-General of Australia. His appointment was praised by both sides of politics. He was sworn in on 29 July 1982, the first former High Court justice to become governor-general since Sir Isaac Isaacs in 1931. When Fraser was defeated by the Labor Party under Bob Hawke in 1983, Stephen had no difficulty working with a Labor government. In 1987, his term was extended by 18 months as a mark of personal respect and also to allow Bill Hayden (to whom Hawke had promised the position) to leave politics at a time of his choosing. Stephen is the only governor-general to have approved two double dissolutions – in 1983 (for Fraser) and 1987 (for Hawke).

==Later work==

In 1989, Stephen became Australia&#x27;s first Ambassador for the Environment and, in his three-year term, was particularly energetic in working for a ban of mining in Antarctica. In 1990 he became the chair of the Australian Antarctic Foundation, based in Hobart, and subsequently also became the chair of the Constitutional Centenary Foundation, based in Melbourne, which was established following the 1991 Constitutional Centenary Conference. In 1991, he undertook a difficult task when he was appointed chairman of the second strand of the Northern Ireland peace talks. From 1991 to 1995, he was a judge &quot;ad hoc&quot; of the International Court of Justice in the case &quot;East Timor (Portugal v. Australia) 1991–1995&quot;. From 1993 to 1997, he was a judge on the international tribunals investigating war crimes in Yugoslavia and Rwanda. He also served as chairman of the Australian Citizenship Council from 1998. In 1994, he acted as a special envoy of the UN Secretary General to resolve political conflicts in Bangladesh.

Stephen later moved back into the legal field, becoming president of an arbitral tribunal constituted under Chapter 11 of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), charged with the adjudication of an investment dispute between Mondev, a Canadian investor, and the United States.

A detailed scholarly biography of Stephen, &quot;Fortunate Voyager&quot; by Philip Ayres, was released in September 2013. Drawing upon it, Ayres also summarised Stephen&#x27;s career for the &quot;Victorian Bar News&quot;.

==Honours==

Stephen was made a Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire (KBE) on 20 April 1972 &quot;for distinguished services to the Law&quot;, and sworn of the Privy Council in 1979. As governor-general he was made a Knight of the Order of Australia (AK), Knight Grand Cross of the Order of St Michael and St George (GCMG) and Knight Grand Cross of the Royal Victorian Order (GCVO). In 1994 Queen Elizabeth II appointed him a Knight Companion of the Order of the Garter (KG), being the most recent Australian to be granted a knighthood in the personal gift of the monarch of Australia. He therefore had the unusual distinction of holding six separate knighthoods and joined Lord Casey and Sir Paul Hasluck as one of the few Australian Knights Companion of the Order of the Garter. In 1983 he was named a Commandeur of the French Légion d&#x27;honneur.

Stephen delivered the first Sir Ninian Stephen Lecture at the University of Newcastle&#x27;s law school in 1993, giving his name to this lecture series.

==Personal life and death==
In June 1949, Stephen married Valery Mary Sinclair (4 July 1925 – 3 November 2019) and they had five daughters. Stephen and his wife were patrons of the Australian Inland Botanic Gardens. He died in Melbourne on 29 October 2017, aged 94. A state funeral for Stephen was held on 8 November at St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral, Melbourne.

<text>Český Těšín (; ; ) is a town in Karviná District in the Moravian-Silesian Region of the Czech Republic. It has about 23,000 inhabitants.

Český Těšín lies on the west bank of the Olza river, in the heart of the historical region of Cieszyn Silesia. Until the 1920 division of the region between Poland and Czechoslovakia it was just a western suburb of the town of Teschen, which after the division fell to Poland as Cieszyn. The combined population of the Czech and Polish parts of the town is around 57,000 (23,500 in Český Těšín, 33,500 in Cieszyn).

The historic centre in Český Těšín is well preserved and is protected by law as an urban monument zone.

==Administrative division==
Český Těšín consists of seven municipal parts (in brackets population according to the 2021 census):

*Český Těšín (18,224)
*Dolní Žukov (1,318)
*Horní Žukov (850)
*Koňákov (356)
*Mistřovice (567)
*Mosty (1,253)
*Stanislavice (562)
==Geography==

Český Těšín is located about south of Karviná and east of Ostrava. It lies on the border with Poland in the historical region of Cieszyn Silesia and is a twin city with the Polish city of Cieszyn. The town is situated in the Moravian-Silesian Foothills, on the left bank of the Olza River. The highest point is the hill Šachta at above sea level.

==History==

The first written mention of Těšín is from 1155, when a castle called &quot;Tescin&quot; was mentioned in a deed of Pope Adrian IV. In 1290, the settlement was first referred to as a town.

The area was originally a small western suburb of the town of Cieszyn, the capital of the Duchy of Cieszyn, which was established in 1290, during the fragmentation of Poland into smaller duchies. It was ruled by the Piast dynasty until 1653, and by the Habsburg dynasty afterwards. Under Austrian rule, it was known under its Germanized name &quot;Teschen&quot;. It was known for its national and cultural diversity, consisting mostly of German, Polish, Jewish and Czech communities. In 1849, the western part of Teschen was home to only 14.9% of the town&#x27;s total population: in 1880 24% and in 1910 33.4%. There was also a small but lively Hungarian community in the town, mostly officers and administrative workers.

From 1870 (when the Košice–Bohumín Railway was put into operation) until 1914, there was a construction boom and the districts that forms the today&#x27;s Český Těšín were built.

According to the Austrian census of 1910, Teschen had 22,489 inhabitants, 13,254 (61.5%) of them were German-speaking, 6,832 (31.7%) were Polish-speaking and 1,437 (6.6%) were Czech-speaking. The most populous religious groups were Roman Catholics with 15,138 (67.3%) followed by Protestants with 5,174 (23%) and the Jews with 2,112 (9.4%).

Following the fall of Austria-Hungary, Czech and Polish local governments were established. Both of them claimed that the whole of Cieszyn Silesia belonged to Czechoslovakia or Poland respectively. To calm down the friction which developed, the local governments concluded an interim agreement on division of the area running along ethnic lines. The division line imposed by the interim agreement was seen as unacceptable by the central Czechoslovak government, mainly because the crucial railway connecting the Czech lands with eastern Slovakia was controlled by Poland, and access to that railway was vital for Czechoslovakia at that time.

Despite the division being only interim, Poland decided to organize elections to the Sejm (Polish parliament) in the area. To prevent this, Czechoslovakia decided to attack the Polish part of the region on 23 January 1919. After the Polish–Czechoslovak War, Czechoslovakia forced Poland, which was at that time at war also with the West Ukrainian National Republic, to withdraw from the larger part of the area. After a ceasefire, the entire area was divided by the decision of the Spa Conference from July 1920, thus in practice creating the Trans-Olza area, leaving a sizable Polish minority on the Czech side and dividing the town of Cieszyn between the two states.
Český Těšín was then the centre of Český Těšín District, existing in the years 1920–1938 and 1945–1960.

In 1938, following the Munich Agreement allowing the German annexation of the Sudetenland, Poland coerced Czechoslovakia to surrender the region of Trans-Olza (including Český Těšín). Following negotiations with Czech authorities, Polish troops and authorities entered it on 2 October 1938, and the territory was annexed by Poland and again joined to Cieszyn. After the German invasion of Poland in 1939, the entire territory was annexed by Nazi Germany. In 1941, Nazi Germany established the Stalag VIII-D prisoner-of-war camp for Polish, French, Belgian, British and Serbian POWs, which in September 1942 was converted into a subcamp of the Stalag VIII-B camp. After the war, the sizeable German-speaking community was expelled in accordance with the Potsdam Agreement, and the 1920 borders were restored.

===Jewish community===

The first Jews in the area of Český Těšín were first documented in the early 18th century. The oldest Jewish prayer houses had existed in Český Těšín since the early 20th century. It was run by the Schomre Schabos (Guardians of Shabbat) society. After 1869 the Jewish minority increased rapidly and in 1914 they made up 40% of the Těšín population. They significantly contributed to the establishment, development and maintenance of trade contacts with neighbouring countries.

After the division of Teschen in 1920, there were no synagogues and cemetery in the Czech part of the town, and new ones had to be established. The Jewish Community of Český Těšín was established in 1923.

In 1938, there was a sizeable Jewish minority in the town, about 1,500 in Cieszyn and 1,300 in Český Těšín. Nearly all of them were killed by Nazi Germany in concentration camps. Most of the synagogues were destroyed. Today, only one synagogue still stands in the town, used as a Polish cultural centre.

==Demographics==
As of 2021, the Poles make up 14.3% of the town&#x27;s population. The town is an important cultural and educational centre of the Polish minority in the Czech Republic. The number of Poles is however decreasing as a result of continuing assimilation. Although a border town, there is no longer any real ethnic tension between Czechs and Poles.

===Religion===

The diversity of the town is not only ethnic, but also religious. Many Christian denominations are present in the town. In the past a large Jewish community lived there. According to the 2021 census, 31.6% of the population is religious, out of whom 34.4% are Roman Catholics, and 3.7% are Czech Brethren.

==Economy==
The largest industrial employer based in the town is Kovona System, which is engaged in production of metal products. It employs about 800 people. The second notable industrial company is Finidr, one of the biggest producers of hardback and paperback books in Central Europe with about 600 employers.

==Culture==
Těšín Theatre has Czech and Polish ensembles, where plays are presented in both the Czech and Polish languages. It is one of the few theatres outside Poland which has a professional Polish ensemble.

==Education==
Alongside several Czech primary schools and one gymnasium, the town has both a Polish primary school and a gymnasium. The Pedagogical Centre for Polish National Education in Český Těšín takes care of the needs of schools with the Polish teaching language in the Czech Republic.

==Sights==

There is six church buildings in the town. The oldest is the Neo-Gothic Catholic Church of the Sacred Heart of Jesus, built by architect Ludwig Satzky in 1893–1894.

After the division of Teschen in 1920, there were no Lutheran churches in Český Těšín. In 1927 the local German population built a Lutheran church in the town, and in 1932 the second Lutheran church was built. The church of the Evangelical Church of Czech Brethren was constructed in 1929.

In 1928–1929 the Jewish community built a new synagogue on Breitegasse Street, which is to date the only synagogue in the town which still stands. It was the only synagogue not destroyed by Nazis due to its proximity to other residential buildings. In 1967 the building was bought by the Polish Cultural and Educational Union. It is not protected as a cultural monument. Together with fragment of the Jewish cemetery, which was established in 1926, it is the only Jewish monument in the town.

The railway station was built in the Neo-Renaissance style in 1889 and belongs to the most valuable railway station buildings in the country.

The town hall is the landmark of the town square. The -long building was built in 1928.

Český Těšín is home to the Museum of Cieszyn Silesia, founded in 1948.

<text>Blánaid Salkeld (born Florence Ffrench Mullen; 1880 – 1959) was an Irish poet, dramatist, actor, and publisher, whose well-known literary salon was attended by, among others, Patrick Kavanagh and Flann O&#x27;Brien.

==Early life and family==
Salkeld was born Florence Ffrench Mullen in Chittagong on 10 August 1880, and grew up in Dublin on Fitzwilliam Street. Her father, Lt Colonel Jarlath ffrench-Mullen, a doctor in the Indian Medical Service, was a friend of Rabindranath Tagore and also introduced her to the poetry of Keats. She had at least one brother, Padraic. She married Henry Salkeld in 1902 and spent the next six years in India with her husband, who worked in the Indian Civil Service, living in Dacca and Bombay. She returned to Dublin with her son Cecil, in 1910 following the death of her husband in 1909. Though some accounts have Salkeld back in Dublin as early as 1906.

==Career==
In Dublin, she joined the Abbey Players as an actor, using the Irish form of her name, Blánaid (then spelled Blathnaid) and the stage name Nell Byrne. She played the lead role in George Fitzmaurice&#x27;s three-act play &quot;The Country Dressmaker&quot;. She started writing verse plays in the 1930s, and one of these, &quot;Scarecrow Over the Corn&quot;, was staged in 1941 at the Gate Theatre with stage sets designed by Louis le Brocquy. Salkeld contributed numerous book reviews to &quot;The Dublin Magazine, Irish Writing&quot;, and &quot;The Bell&quot;. She translated Akhmatova, Bruisov, Blok, and Pushkin from the Russian into English. The salons she hosted in her home were frequented by Kate O&#x27;Brien, Arland Ussher, Patrick Kavanagh, Flann O&#x27;Brien, and Micheál Mac Liammóir. Her first volume of poetry, &quot;Hello Eternity&quot;, was praised by Samuel Beckett. She founded the Irish Women&#x27;s Writers&#x27; Club with Dorothy Macardle in 1933.

She co-founded the Gayfield Press with her son, Cecil, in 1937. It operated from the garden shed at their home at 43 Morehampton Road until 1946. The press was a small Adana wooden hand press. The Salkelds later loaned the press to Liam and Josephine Miller in 1951, with which they founded the Dolmen Press.

During the preparations for the Easter Rising, a room on the first floor of 130 St Stephen&#x27;s Green which she had lent to Thomas MacDonagh was his headquarters.

Salkeld died in Dublin in 1959. Her granddaughter Beatrice married Brendan Behan. Her work is considered overlooked within the canon of early 20th century Irish poetry, as it was neither of the Celtic revival or modernist.

==Poetry==
Salkeld published five books of poetry:

* &quot;Hello, Eternity&quot; (Elkin Mathews 1933)
* &quot;A Dubliner&quot; (Dublin: Gayfield 1942)
* &quot;The Fox’s Covert&quot; (JM Dent 1935)
* &quot;The engine is left running&quot; (Gayfield 1937)
* &quot;Experiment In Error&quot; (Aldington, Kent: Hand &amp; Flower Press 1955)

<text>AutoREALM is an open source program designed to draw maps for role-playing games, mainly in fantasy settings. The program is similar to the commercial Campaign Cartographer.

AutoREALM, in its 2.x series, is primarily written in Delphi and only works in Windows and Wine. Work is underway to recode the GUI to use wxWidgets and extending the support to Linux, FreeBSD and Mac OS X.

The program is a vector art program that supports various graphics layers. The program supports various kinds of grids and measurement methods. It supports drawing vector objects with both straight and fractal lines, and has various line styles. It also supports grouping of objects into map symbols that are arranged in a symbol library. The library shipping with the program includes various symbols from contributors.

The program also has some other modules, such as AutoNAME, a name generator based on context-free grammars.

<doc id="373232" wikidata="Q343124" url="?curid=373232" title="Great Eastern Islamic Raiders' Front">
<text>The Great Eastern Islamic Raiders&#x27; Front (&quot;İslami Büyükdoğu Akıncılar Cephesi&quot; in Turkish, abbreviated İBDA-C) is an Islamist militant organization. The group&#x27;s self-proclaimed goal is to dismantle Turkey and form the State of Grandsublime (), a Sunni Islamic federate state in the Middle East. They are notably hostile to Shia, Alevi, Christian and Jewish interests. IBDA-C carries on its pro-Islamic legacy with a newly born radicalism that wishes to restore religious rule to Turkey of whose government it finds illegal with an added willingness to commit acts of terrorism.

IBDA-C has a history of claiming credit for attacks most experts believe are beyond its capabilities, such as the November 2003 and July 2008 attacks on diplomatic, business, and religious interests in Istanbul. As such, its designation with the United States government continues to be as an &quot;Other Terrorist Group&quot;, as opposed to the better-organized and -financed groups designated as official &quot;Designated Foreign Terrorist Organizations&quot;.

==History==

IBDA-C was founded in 1970 by Salih İzzet Erdiş, better known as Salih Mirzabeyoğlu. The group moved from rhetoric to violence in the 1990s, culminating in a series of 90 bombings and attacks in 1994.

Salih İzzet Erdiş, a spiritual follower of Kısakürek, was captured on Dec. 31, 1998, and sentenced to death in April 2001 for &quot;attempting to overthrow Turkey&#x27;s secular state by force&quot;. His lawyer, Ahmet Arslan, maintained that his client was no more than &quot;a man of thought&quot;, arguing that there was a lack of concrete evidence supporting the charges. Erdiş&#x27;s death sentence was later commuted when Ankara abolished the death penalty in August 2002.

In August 2003, Erdiş claimed responsibility for his crimes and attributed his actions to &quot;mind control&quot;, seeking help from the Forensic Medicine Institute in Turkey. In March 2004, a Turkish court sentenced Erdiş to 20-years in prison for using handmade explosives and weapons in a riot against authorities at Metris Prison.

Following the imprisonment of Erdiş, IBDA-C continued its activities, being most heavily active in the Istanbul region, attacking bars, discothèques, and churches. Members of IBDA-C don&#x27;t operate under any defined hierarchical structure, and carry out actions in small independent groups that are united behind their common goals and ideologies.

==Doctrine==
The Great East Islamic Raiders Front comprises Turkish Sunni Jihadis, a contingent roughly defined as those who are willing to take up arms for the faith of Islam. Viewing Turkey&#x27;s secular governmental system as &quot;illegal,&quot; IBDA-C wishes to destroy the secular state and constitutional system and replace it with religious rule and law, first in Turkey, and then throughout the world. The group has gone about asserting these goals by inflicting armed terror primarily on civilian targets. IBDA-C shares ideological ties with Al-Qaeda.

Necip Fazıl Kısakürek, whom IBDA-C borrows its core ideology from, advocated a return to &quot;pure Islamic values&quot; and the restoration of a universal Islamic caliphate in the Muslim world. His system of thought, &quot;Büyük Doğu&quot;, was an absolutist ideology promising to bring Muslims closer to success and salvation, with the central idea that truth is only accessible through the practice of Islam. He also argued that the secular nature of Turkey was responsible for the state&#x27;s inability to ward off what he saw as Western imperialism. Kısakürek was seen as the pioneer of &quot;ideal Islamic society&quot; by the founders of IBDA-C.

The 2003 Istanbul bombings provide the strongest implication of ties between IBDA-C and Al-Qaeda, although the exact nature of their cooperation remains unclear. Al-Qaeda may have acted merely as an outside support base, or possibly in tandem with IBDA-C in terms of planning and execution. Some, on the other hand, assert that IBDA-C had no involvement at all; contradicting reports from the Turkish media solely credit al-Qaeda with the attacks, implying that IBDA-C did not have the means to carry out such a sophisticated act of terrorism. Indeed, IBDA-C showed no willingness to exercise suicide terrorism prior to November 2003. Regardless of whether or not IBDA-C actively participated in these particular attacks, the attention received provided the group with a heightened level of international infamy, as they were previously not well known at the global level.

Despite Al-Qaeda&#x27;s similar aims and superior stature as an international terrorist organization, IBDA-C views itself as the quintessential Islamic revivalist movement toward which all others should dedicate their resources. In addition to committing terrorist attacks, the organization also produces propagandist literature put out in bookstores and on the Internet, which has the potential to attract new members, including those from other countries.

In December 2003, the German newspaper &quot;Der Spiegel&quot; reported that the group could count on as many as 600 supporters in Germany. In another report regarding the possible German contingent, a Turkish rail worker claimed, &quot;Istanbul was nothing. The major butchery is yet to come.&quot; Although IBDA-C is thought to have supporters throughout Western Europe, the group has not performed any significant terrorist attacks there since their alleged actions in Istanbul. The number of extremist supporters actively participating in IBDA-C&#x27;s terrorist plots is not known, but thought to be small.

IBDA-C has kept relatively quiet in 2004, although seven members of the group were indicted in June for the murder of a Turkish cult leader, Col. :tr:İhsan Güven and his wife. Burak Çileli, one of the defendants, is said to have described Güven contemptuously in IBDA-C literature, calling him a &quot;pervert,&quot; a &quot;Jewish sympathizer,&quot; and &quot;pro-American.&quot; The accused were apparently angered that the murders were not immediately reported by the press, claiming that they also had plans to attack a TV talk show host and columnist named Savas Ay in order to heighten publicity for their organization.

IBDA-C is not an organization to be taken lightly, but it can perhaps be said to have a dubious future as its leader, Erdiş, sits in prison, and the group has no clearly defined hierarchical structure. By the same token, the lack of organized centrality makes the group more elusive and difficult to eliminate, much like al-Qaeda. IBDA-C will continue to be a threat if it is able to sustain external spheres of support, especially from other terrorist organizations such as al-Qaeda.

After Erdiş&#x27;s arrest and subsequent conviction on December 29, 1998, followed by the detention of many lower-ranking figures in the group, IBDA-C&#x27;s activity seemed to quiet down. However, IBDA-C burst back into the headlines when it claimed responsibility for the dual synagogue bombing in Istanbul on November 15, 2003, which killed 24 and injured 255, as well as a subsequent attack on the HSBC Bank and British consulate on November 20, 2003 (see 2003 Istanbul bombings). The second claim called the bombings a joint attack with Al Qaeda; the authenticity of the claim is disputed.

On November 29, police in Istanbul announced the arrest of a yet-unnamed man they stated had admitted to giving the order to suicide bombers to attack Beth Israel synagogue on November 15.

==Designation as a terrorist organisation==

The organisation is listed among the 12 active terrorist organisations in Turkey as of 2007 according to Counter-Terrorism and Operations Department of Directorate General for Security (Turkish police). In December 2001, IBDA-C was labeled an &quot;illegal organization&quot; by the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus.

It is also one of the 48 groups and entities to which European Union&#x27;s Common Position 2001/931/CFSP on the application of specific measures to combat terrorism has applied. In April 2003, the U.S. Department of State (DoS) designated the group as a &quot;terrorist group&quot; in their annual Patterns of Global Terrorism report.

==Human Resources==
According to information provided by the Intelligence Resource Program of the Federation of American Scientists based on the 2003 Patterns of Global Terrorism report the strength of the organisation in terms of human resources remains unknown.

A study carried out by the Counter-Terrorism and Operations Department of Directorate General for Security over a sample of files about people convicted of being a terrorist under Turkish laws including 200 militants from the organisation and the four other currently active Islamic organisations (see reference 1) 2.5% of the members are aged 10 to 14, 72.5% 15 to 24, 17% 25 to 29, 6% 30 to 34, and 2% 35 to 64. University graduates make up 22.5% of the members, high-school graduates 40%, secondary-school graduates 14%, primary-school graduates 19%, literate non-graduates 2.5% and illiterates 1.5%.

<doc id="373235" wikidata="Q6784005" url="?curid=373235" title="Mass-Observation">
<text>Mass-Observation is a United Kingdom social research project; originally the name of an organisation which ran from 1937 to the mid-1960s, and was revived in 1981 at the University of Sussex.

Mass-Observation originally aimed to record everyday life in Britain through a panel of around 500 untrained volunteer observers who either maintained diaries or replied to open-ended questionnaires (known as directives). The organisation also paid investigators to anonymously record people&#x27;s conversation and behaviour at work, on the street and at various public occasions, including public meetings and sporting and religious events.

==Origins==

The creators of the Mass-Observation project were three former students from Cambridge: anthropologist Tom Harrisson (who left Cambridge before graduating), poet Charles Madge and filmmaker Humphrey Jennings. Collaborators included literary critic William Empson, photographers Humphrey Spender and Michael Wickham, collagist Julian Trevelyan, novelists Inez Pearn and G.B. Edwards, spiritualist medium Rosemary Brown, journalist Anne Symonds, and painters William Coldstream and Graham Bell. Run on a shoestring budget with money from their own pockets and the occasional philanthropic contribution or book advance, the project relied primarily on its network of volunteer correspondents.

Harrisson had set up his base in a working-class street in the northern English industrial town of Bolton (known in Mass-Observation publications as &quot;Worktown&quot;), in order to &quot;systematically... record human activity in this industrial town&quot; (Madge &amp; Harrisson, 1938:7) using a variety of observational methods. Meanwhile, Madge, from his London home, had started to form a group of fellow-poets, artists and film-makers under the name &quot;Mass-Observation&quot;. The two teams began their collaboration in early 1937.

An important early focus was King Edward VIII&#x27;s abdication in 1936 to marry divorcée Wallis Simpson, and the succession of George VI. Dissatisfied with the pronouncements of the newspapers as to the public mood, the project&#x27;s founders initiated a nationwide effort to document the feelings of the populace about important current events by collecting anecdotes, overheard comments, and &quot;man-in-the-street&quot; interviews on and around the coronation of King George VI and Queen Elizabeth on 12 May 1937.

Their first published report, &quot;May the Twelfth: Mass-Observation Day-Surveys 1937 by over two hundred observers&quot; was published in book form. The result tended to subvert the Government&#x27;s efforts at image-making. The principal editors were Humphrey Jennings and Charles Madge, with the help of T. O. Beachcroft, Julian Blackburn, William Empson, Stuart Legg and Kathleen Raine. The 1987 reprint contains an afterword by David Pocock, director of the Tom Harrisson Mass-Observation archive.

In August 1939, Mass-Observation invited members of the public to record and send them a day-to-day account of their lives in the form of a diary. No special instructions were given to these diarists so they vary greatly in their style, content and length. 480 people responded to this invitation and their diaries are now held in the organisation&#x27;s archive.

==Impact==
During the Second World War, Mass-Observation research was occasionally influential in shaping British public policy. In 1939 Mass-Observation publicly criticised the Ministry of Information&#x27;s posters, which led to their being replaced with more appropriate ones. In addition, their study of saving habits was successfully used by John Maynard Keynes to argue for tax policy changes. During the war, there were also a few cases of Mass-Observation (MO) doing research on commission for government authorities trying to shape recruiting and war propaganda: Mary Adams, for example, employed Mass-Observation on commission for the Ministry of Information.

==Decline and end==
Following the war, and the departure of project founders Harrisson, Madge, and Jennings, research began to focus on the commercial habits of the country rather than the broader cultural research that characterised its first decade. This turn towards market research was formalised in 1949 when the project was incorporated as a private firm and, under new management, became registered as a market research limited company, Mass Observation (UK) Limited. Eventually the firm was merged with the advertising agency J. Walter Thompson&#x27;s UK research agency BMRB, to form MRB International, followed by a full merger in the early 1990s.

==Relaunch: The Mass Observation Project (1981–present)==

A re-evaluation of the Mass-Observation archives led to a relaunch of the project in 1981. Today, housed at the University of Sussex, Mass-Observation continues to collect the thoughts of its panel of writers through regular questionnaires (known as directives) and is used by students, academics, media researchers and the public for its unique collection of material on everyday life in Britain. The project issues annual call-outs for day diaries on the 12th of May each year, echoing the initial call on 12th May 1937; anyone is welcome to submit a diary of their activity on this day either digitally or physically.

The Mass-Observation archive of materials is currently housed in The Keep, an archive housing East Sussex and Brighton and Hove councils&#x27; historical record.

<text>Bhrikuti Devi (), known to Tibetans as &#x27;, Bhelsa Tritsun (&quot;Besa&quot; Nepal ) or simply &#x27; (), was a princess of the Licchavi kingdom in Nepal. In c.622 Bhrikuti became the first wife and queen of the king of Tibet, Songtsen Gampo (c.605–650 CE). Bhrikuti was seen as an incarnation of Green Tara, and is credited for bringing Buddhism to Tibet, together with the Jowo Mikyo Dorje statue for which the Jokhang Temple in Lhasa was built.
==Life==
Even though the historicity of Bhrikuti Devi is not certain, and no reference to her has been found among the documents discovered at Dunhuang, &quot;there are increasing indications supporting this hypothesis.&quot; There were certainly very close relationships between Tibet and Nepal at this period and, &quot;Such a mythological interpretation discredits in no way the historical likelihood of such a marriage...&quot;

Many Tibetan accounts make Bhrikuti the daughter of Amshuvarma (605–621 CE), co-ruler and successor of Śivadeva I. If this is correct, the marriage to Songtsen Gampo must have taken place sometime before 624 CE. Acharya Kirti Tulku Lobsang Tenzin, however, states that Songstän Gampo married Bhrkuti Devi, the daughter of king &quot;Angsu Varma&quot; or Amshuvarma (Tib: &quot;Waser Gocha&quot;) of Nepal in 632.

According to some Tibetan legends, however, a Nepali king named Go Cha (identified by Sylvain Lévi as &quot;Udayavarman&quot;, from the literal meaning of the Tibetan name) was said to have a daughter called Bri-btumn or Bhṛkuti.

&quot;Udayavarman&quot; was most likely the same king we know as Udayadeva, the son of Śivadeva I and later, the adopted son and heir to Aṃshuvarmā. He was also thought to be the father of Narendradeva (Tib: &quot;Miwang-Lha&quot;). If this is accepted, it means that Narendradeva and Bhrikuti Devi were brother and sister.

We do have some fairly detailed historical accounts of Narendradeva. The &quot;(Jiu) Tangshu&quot;, or &quot;Old Book of Tang&quot;, records that when the king of Nepal, the father of Licchavi king Naling Deva (or Narendradeva), died, an uncle (Yu.sna kug.ti = Vishnagupta) usurped the throne. &quot;The Tibetans gave him [Narendradeva] refuge and reestablished him on his throne [in 641]; that is how he became subject to Tibet.&quot;

It is not known exactly when Bhrikuti married Songtsen Gampo, but it was presumably about the time that Narendradeva fled to Tibet (c. 621 CE), following Dhruvadeva&#x27;s take-over of the throne (who, according to an inscription dated in 623, was ruling jointly with Jiṣṇugupta.)

==Bhrikuti in Tibet==

This is considered to be the oldest copy of the famous traditional history, the &quot;dBa&#x27; bzhed&quot;, states: 

:&quot;Then during the reign of bTsan po Khri Srong btsan, after his marriage with , the daughter of the king of Nepal, the temple (&quot;gtsug lag khang&quot;) of Ra sa [Lhasa] Pe har gling was built. Furthermore, the construction of the forty-two temples of the Ru bzhi was requested and the Brag lha [temple] was built. &#x27;Thon mi gSam po ra was sent by royal order [to India] in order to get the Indian doctrine and the model of the alphabet (&quot;yi ge&#x27;i dpe&quot;). . . .&quot;

Bhrikuti was a devout Buddhist as was her father, and she brought many sacred buddhist images along with expert Newa craftsmen to Tibet as part of her dowry. 
Songtsen Gampo and Bhrikuti built the great temple, the Tsulag Khang (or &#x27;House of Wisdom&#x27;) to house the images, which is now known as the Jokhang Temple (&#x27;House of the Lord&#x27;) in the heart of Lhasa, and is considered to be the most sacred temple in Tibet. Her statue of Jowo Mikyo Dorje was then housed in the Jokhang. They also built the red palace of dMar-po-ri which shifted the ancient seat of government in the Yarlung Valley at Yumbulakhang to the site of modern Lhasa. The Red Palace, or Red Fort (Mar-po-ri Pho-drang) on Marpo Ri (Red Mountain) in Lhasa that was later rebuilt into the thirteen storey Potala by the Fifth Dalai Lama, was originally constructed by Nepali craftsmen. She also had constructed the &quot;Tub-wang&quot; and other statues in Samye and the famous Nepali artist Thro-wo carved the revered statue of Chenresig, &quot;Thungji Chen-po rang-jung nga-ldan&quot;. 

The famous statue Bhrikuti brought is called the Jowo Mikyo Dorje, which came originally from Bodhgaya and, according to the 8th Dalai Lama, the statue rested in Swayambhunath for seven months before being brought into Tibet. This statue is also called the Manuvajra, the Ramoche Jowo, or Jowo Chungpa. It is currently housed in the Ramoche Temple in Lhasa.

Through history, the Jokhang temple had been sacked at least two times – first during the Mongol invasions and later it was gutted in the 1960s during the Chinese invasion and Cultural Revolution. It is said that the lower half of the statue was found in a Lhasa rubbish dump and the upper part found in Beijing. The parts have since been joined and the statue is surrounded by the Eight Bodhisattvas and located at Ramoche.

Bhrikuti is usually represented as Green Tara in Tibetan iconography. Songtsen Gampo also married the Chinese Princess Wencheng in 641, who is considered to be another incarnation of Tara, of White Tara. As queens, Bhrikuti and Wencheng are said to have worked together to establish temples and Buddhism in Tibet.

<doc id="373249" wikidata="Q941632" url="?curid=373249" title="Cortaderia">
<text>Cortaderia is a genus of plants in the Poaceae or grass family of plants.

All current species included in the &quot;Cortaderia&quot; genus are native to South and Central America, ranging from the Patagonia region of southern Chile and Argentina, to Costa Rica. For many years, five species native to New Zealand were included in the genus, but since 2011 these have been since reclassified into the genus &quot;Austroderia&quot; containing only species native to New Zealand.

==Etymology==
The common name pampas grass, though strictly referring to &quot;C. selloana&quot;, is frequently applied to all species in the genus, as well as the five former members reclassied into the genus Austroderia (sometimes also to species of &quot;Erianthus&quot; and &quot;Saccharum ravennae&quot;). The name of the genus is derived from the Argentine Spanish word &quot;cortadera&quot;, which in turn refers to the sharp serrations on the leaves. &quot;Cortaderia jubata&quot; and &quot;C. rudiuscula&quot; produce copious seed asexually.

==Description==
Cortaderia species are perennial grasses, characterised by robust culms and feathery inflorescent plumes held high above the foliage.Some species are relatively short, forming rounded hedgehog-like clumps less than 0.5 m tall, but many species, including &quot;Cortaderia selloana&quot; and &quot;Cortaderia jubata&quot; form wide tussocks, up to 4 m tall. Rhizomes or stolons are rare but some species, particularly the taller species, can form tussocks almost as wide as their height.

Across South America, the genus is a major component of the C3 temperate grasslands, from Tierra del Fuego in the far south, north to Venezuela (with some species extending to Costa Rica). They can be found from the Serro do Mar Atlantic coastal mountains near Rio de Janeiro to the Andes in Ecuador. At the southern extreme, species naturally grow at sea level, and in the Andes, certain species can be found growing up to 4500 m at the equator, where they make up a major component of paramo habitat.

== Cultivation ==

=== Horticulture ===
Several species of Cortaderia have been extensively planted in gardens or cultivated landscapes around the world, particularly &quot;Cortaderia selloana&quot;, having been planted as an ornamental garden plant outside of South America since the 19th century.

Many varieties or selections of &quot;Cortaderia selloana&quot; are or have been available, including variegated, silver leaved and dwarf varieties. The following varieties have received an Award of Garden Merit (AGM) by the Royal Horticultural Society (RHS): &#x27;Silver Feather&#x27;, &#x27;Pumila&#x27;, &#x27;Patagonia&#x27;, &#x27;Montrosa&#x27;, &#x27;Evita&#x27;, &#x27;Aureolineata&#x27;, and &#x27;Sunningdale Silver&#x27;.

=== Non-ornamental uses ===
&quot;Cortaderia jubata&quot;, and to a lesser extent &quot;Cortaderia selloana&quot;, can be used as green forage during dry summer months being able to be grazed to 30-50cm of the plant&#x27;s base and be used as a substitute for hay, with plants having been used in the past for forage in New Zealand and California. Both species have also been used as a means of erosion control and planted as a windbreak and to provide shelter.

=== As invasive species ===
&quot;Cortaderia selloana&quot; and &quot;Cortaderia jubata&quot; are considered invasive species in several disjunct parts of the world, capable of forming dense, often impenetrable, stands, and can damage grazing lands, interfere with afforested areas, affect visibility on roads and hinder access to certain natural areas, such as the margins of streams. In parts of the world with high forest or bush fire risk, the build up and slow decomposition of leaf litter and standing dead leaves produce large amounts of flammable material and increase fire-related hazards.

In regions where either species is considered invasive, plants are able to rapidly colonize areas, including grassland plains, dunes, sparse shrublands and riverine habitats, particularly those that have been disturbed or altered by humans in the past, such as disused farmland or afforested land.

&quot;Cortaderia selloana&quot; is considered invasive on the Atlantic coast of Europe across an &#x27;Atlantic arc&#x27; ranging from Portugal to France, particularly in the Cantabria province of Spain. In California, it is recorded as having colonized land in at least 19 counties. It also occurs in many Micronesian islands, South Africa and Hawaiian islands, being classed as a noxious species in New Zealand and some states of Australia. It is one of the emerging invasive species with the greatest potential range in South Africa, Lesotho and Swaziland, especially in grasslands.

&quot;Cordateria jubata&quot;, has similarly escaped from cultivation and become problematic especially in Australia, South Africa, New Zealand and parts of the United States. &quot;C. jubata&quot; is listed as a noxious weed in California, Hawaii and Oregon, and as a grade 1 invasive species in South Africa.

<doc id="373251" wikidata="Q1431081" url="?curid=373251" title="St Paul's tube station">
<text>St Paul&#x27;s is a London Underground station located in the City of London financial district. It takes its name from the nearby St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral. The station is on the Central line between Chancery Lane and Bank stations, and is in fare zone 1.

It should not be confused with the former &quot;St. Paul&#x27;s Thameslink&quot; railway station, a Thameslink railway station which opened in 1990, but has some distance from the Underground station. That station was subsequently renamed City Thameslink after one year, to avoid confusion for the emergency services. But for some years afterwards, many maps and guidebooks in circulation continued to carry the earlier name.

== History ==
The station was opened by the Central London Railway (CLR) on 30 July 1900 with the name Post Office, after the headquarters of the General Post Office on nearby St. Martin&#x27;s Le Grand. The name Post Office was possibly chosen instead of the more obvious St. Paul&#x27;s to differentiate it from a South Eastern Railway (SER) station which already held that name (but which today is called Blackfriars).
The station entrance was originally located on the north side of Newgate Street, on the west side of the junction with King Edward Street, but was moved to the east when the station was modernised in the 1930s with an underground ticket hall and escalators. A modern ventilation shaft in the centre of the traffic island at the junction indicates the location of the original lift shafts. When the SER station called St. Paul&#x27;s was renamed as Blackfriars in 1937, the Underground station called Post Office took the name St. Paul&#x27;s, which it has kept ever since.

At the end of the 19th century, Newgate Street was a narrow road with some of its medieval character remaining. To reduce land purchase and compensation payments, the CLR routed its tunnels directly under public roads. At St. Paul&#x27;s the narrowness of the road required the tunnels to be placed one above the other with the westbound tunnel uppermost. The lifts originally operated to a level between the two platforms, with stairs up or down to the platforms as necessary. A high-level access passageway is visible at the lowest level leading to the disused lift lobby.

During the Second World War the electricity grid control room for London and Southeast England was housed below ground in the lift shaft.

==The station today==

The station entrances are located around the junction of Newgate Street, Cheapside and St. Martin&#x27;s Le Grand. St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral is a short distance to the south. The main entrance to the cathedral is at its western end, a few minutes&#x27; walk away.

St Paul&#x27;s is also the nearest Underground station to the London Stock Exchange and One New Change. Other notable sites in the vicinity include the Old Bailey, Museum of London and the church of St Mary-le-Bow.

==Connections==
London Buses routes 4, 8, 25, 56, 76, 100, 133 and night routes N8, N25 and N242 serve the station.

==Future proposals==
An underground passageway linking City Thameslink railway station to St Paul&#x27;s tube station to provide an interchange between the Central line and National Rail services on the Thameslink railway has been suggested by London TravelWatch in a report in 2014, which suggested it would benefit passengers travelling from the Central line to Gatwick and Luton Airports.

<text>The Pampas (from the , meaning &quot;plain&quot;), also known as the Pampas Plain, are fertile South American low grasslands that cover more than and include the Argentine provinces of Buenos Aires, La Pampa, Santa Fe, Entre Ríos, and Córdoba; all of Uruguay; and Brazil&#x27;s southernmost state, Rio Grande do Sul. The vast plains are a natural region, interrupted only by the low Ventana and Tandil hills, near Bahía Blanca and Tandil (Argentina), with a height of and , respectively. This ecoregion has been changed by humans, especially since the release of animals like cattle, pigs, and especially sheep onto these plains.

The climate is temperate, with precipitation of that is more or less evenly distributed throughout the year, making the soils appropriate for agriculture. The area is also one of the distinct physiography provinces of the larger Paraná–Paraguay plain division.

It is considered that the limit of the Pampas plain is to the north with the Atlantic Forest and the Great Chaco Plain, to the west with the Pampas Mountains and the Cuyo Region, and to the south with Patagonia.

==Topography==
This region has generally low elevations, whose highest levels generally do not exceed in altitude. The coastal areas and most of the Buenos Aires Province are predominantly plain (with some wetlands) and the interior areas (mainly in the southern part of the Brazilian state of Rio Grande do Sul and Uruguay) have low ranges of hills (like Serras de Sudeste in Brazil and Cuchilla Grande in Uruguay). Low hills covered by grasslands are called &quot;coxilhas&quot; () in Portuguese and &quot;cuchillas&quot; () in Spanish, and it is the most typical landscape of the countryside areas in the northern parts of the Pampas. The highest elevations of the Pampas region are found in the Sierra de la Ventana mountains, in the southern part of Buenos Aires Province, with at the summit of Cerro Tres Picos.

==Climates==

The climate of the Pampas is generally temperate, gradually giving way to a more humid subtropical climate in the north (&quot;Cfa&quot;, according to the Köppen climate classification, with a &quot;Cwa&quot; tendency (drier winters) in the northwestern edge); a cold semi-arid climate (&quot;BSk&quot;) on the southern and western fringes (like San Luis Province, western La Pampa Province and southern Buenos Aires Province); and an oceanic climate (&quot;Cfb&quot;) in the southeastern part (in the localities of Mar del Plata, Necochea, Tandil and the Sierra de la Ventana mountains, Argentina). Summer temperatures are more uniform than winter temperatures, generally ranging from during the day. However, most cities in the Pampas occasionally have high temperatures that push , as occurs when warm, dry, northerly winds blow from southern Brazil, northern Argentina or Paraguay. Autumn arrives gradually in March and peaks in April and May. In April, highs range from and lows from . The first frosts arrive in mid-April in the south and late May or early June in the north.

Winters are generally mild, but cold waves often occur. Typical temperatures range from during the day, and from at night. With strong northerly winds, days of over can be recorded almost everywhere, and during cold waves, high temperatures can be only . Frost occurs everywhere in the Pampas, but it is much more frequent in the southwest than around the Parana and Uruguay Rivers. Temperatures under can occur everywhere, but values of or lower are confined to the south and west. Snow almost never falls in the northernmost third and is rare and light elsewhere, except for exceptional events in which depths have reached . Springs are very variable; it is warmer than fall in most areas (especially in the west) but significantly colder along the Atlantic. Violent storms are more common as well as wide temperature variations: days of can give way to nights of under or even frost, all within only a few days.

Precipitation ranges from in the northeast to about or less in the southern and western edges. It is highly seasonal in the West, with some places recording averages of monthly in the summer, and only monthly in the winter. The eastern areas have small peaks in the fall and the spring, with relatively rainy summers and winters that are only slightly drier. However, where summer rain falls as short, heavy storms, winter rain falls mostly as cold drizzle, and so the amount of rainy days is fairly constant. Very intense thunderstorms are common in the spring and summer, and it has among the most frequent lightning and highest convective cloud tops in the world. The severe thunderstorms produce intense hailstorms, both floods and flash floods, and the most consistently active tornado region outside the central and southeastern US.

== Wildlife ==
Human activity has caused major changes to the wildlife of the Pampas. Most big or medium-sized species such as puma, rhea, Capybara, plains viscacha, maned wolf, marsh deer and Pampas deer have lost their habitats especially due to the spread of agriculture and ranching, and are only present in very few relicts of the pampas. Other species, such as the Jaguar and the Guanaco have been extirpated completely from this habitat.

Mammals that are still fairly present include Brazilian guinea pig, southern mountain cavy, coypu, Pampas fox, Geoffroy&#x27;s cat, lesser grison, white-eared opossum, Molina&#x27;s hog-nosed skunk, big lutrine opossum, big hairy armadillo and southern long-nosed armadillo. Bird species of the pampas are ruddy-headed goose, pampas meadowlark, hudsonian godwit, maguari stork, white-faced ibis, white-winged coot, southern screamer, dot-winged crake, curve-billed reedhaunter, burrowing owl and the rhea. Invasive species include the European hare, wild boar and house sparrow.
Most of the large mammals native to the Pampas became extinct as part of the end-Pleistocene extinction event of most large mammals across the Americas around 12,000 years ago. Notable former inhabitants of the Pampas include the giant elephant-sized ground sloth &quot;Megatherium americanum&quot;, alongside the smaller (though still large) ground sloths &quot;Mylodon&quot;, &quot;Glossotherium&quot; &quot;Lestodon&quot; and &quot;Catonyx&quot;, the rhinoceros like ungulate &quot;Toxodon&quot;, the camel-like &quot;Macrauchenia&quot;, the gomphothere (elephant-relative) &quot;Notiomastodon,&quot; the equines &quot;Equus neogeus&quot; and &quot;Hippidion&quot;, and the glyptodonts (car-sized relatives of armadillos) &quot;Glyptodon&quot; and &quot;Doedicurus,&quot; the bear &quot;Arctotherium&quot; and the sabertooth cat &quot;Smilodon populator,&quot; the apex predator of the ecosystem and one of the largest cats ever, larger than any living big cat.

== Vegetation ==

The dominant vegetation types are grassy prairie and grass steppe, in which numerous species of the grass genus &quot;Stipa&quot; are particularly conspicuous. &quot;Pampas grass&quot; (&quot;Cortaderia selloana&quot;) is an iconic species of the Pampas. Vegetation typically includes perennial grasses and herbs. Different strata of grasses occur because of gradients of water availability.

Why the pristine pampas were treeless regions has been much debated. Perhaps the most commonly cited explanation is seasonal drought. A related hypothesis is that grass roots compete for water and exclude tree seedlings. The effect might be increased by heavy, clayed soils which limit tap root penetration. Other causes that have been proposed are fires set by indigenous peoples for land clearance; the existence of heavy-bodied herbivores; and that the pampas are relicts of drier past climates. These explanations have been criticised as mono-causal. &quot;Overall, we expect that low propagule pressure, abiotic stresses, biotic resistance, and a paucity of specific symbionts might have exerted a synergistic influence in slowing tree invasion rates &quot;.

The World Wildlife Fund divides the Pampas into three distinct ecoregions. The Uruguayan Savanna lies east of the Paraná River, and includes all of Uruguay, most of Entre Ríos and Corrientes provinces in Argentina, and the southern portion of Brazil&#x27;s state of Rio Grande do Sul. The Humid Pampas include eastern Buenos Aires Province, and southern Entre Ríos Province. The Semiarid Pampas includes western Buenos Aires Province and adjacent portions of Santa Fe, Córdoba, and La Pampa provinces. The Pampas are bounded by the drier Argentine Espinal grasslands, which form a semicircle around the north, west, and south of the Humid Pampas.

Winters are cold to mild, and summers are hot and humid. Rainfall is fairly uniform throughout the year but is a little heavier during the summer. Annual rainfall is heaviest near the coast and decreases gradually further inland. Rain during the late spring and summer usually arrives in the form of brief heavy showers and thunderstorms. More general rainfall occurs the remainder of the year as cold fronts and storm systems move through. Although cold spells during the winter often send nighttime temperatures below freezing, snow is quite rare. In most winters, a few light snowfalls occur over inland areas.

Central Argentina boasts a successful agricultural business, with crops grown on the Pampas south and west of Buenos Aires. Much of the area is also used for cattle, and more recently, to cultivate vineyards in the Buenos Aires wine region. The area is also used for farming honey using European honeybees. These farming regions are particularly susceptible to flooding during thunderstorms. The weather averages out to be year-round in the Pampas.

==Immigration==

Starting in the 1840s but intensifying after the 1880s, European immigrants began to migrate to the Pampas, first as part of government-sponsored colonization schemes to settle the land and later as tenant farmers &quot;working as either a sharecropper or as paid laborers for absentee landowners&quot; in an attempt to make a living for themselves.

However, many immigrants eventually moved to more permanent employment in cities as industrialization picked up after the 1930s. As a result, Argentina&#x27;s immigration history in Buenos Aires Province is typically associated with cities and urban life, unlike in Entre Ríos Province and Santa Fe Province, where European immigration took on a more rural profile.

<text>Chancery Lane () is a London Underground station. It is on the Central line between Holborn and St Paul&#x27;s stations, and is in fare zone 1. The station has entrances within both the London Borough of Camden and the City of London. It opened in 1900 and takes its name from the nearby Chancery Lane.

The station is located at the junction of High Holborn, Hatton Garden and Gray&#x27;s Inn Road, with subway entrances giving access to the ticket office under the roadway. Chancery Lane is one of the few London Underground stations which have no associated buildings above ground.

==History==
The station was opened by the Central London Railway (CLR) on 30 July 1900. The current station entrance is not the original. The original, disused station building is on the north side of High Holborn at Nos. 31–33, approximately to the west, closer to High Holborn&#x27;s junction with Chancery Lane. Originally provided with four lifts between ground and platform levels, the station was rebuilt in the early 1930s to operate with escalators. It was not possible to construct the inclined escalator shaft between the platforms and the existing entrance, so a new sub-surface ticket hall was constructed below the road junction. The new station entrance came into use on 25 June 1934. The old entrance building became redundant and, in recognition of the location of the new entrance, the station was renamed Chancery Lane (Gray&#x27;s Inn), although the suffix subsequently fell out of use.

When the CLR excavated the running tunnels it routed them to avoid passing under surface buildings in order to limit the risk to the buildings from vibration. At Chancery Lane, the eastbound tunnel runs above the westbound one.

It is one of eight Underground stations with a deep-level air-raid shelter underneath it; after World War II this was turned into Kingsway telephone exchange. Access to the shelter was via the original station building and lift shaft as well as subsidiary entrances in Furnival Street and Took&#x27;s Court.

==Accidents and incidents==
On 25 January 2003, a 1992 Stock train derailed at Chancery Lane, injuring 32 passengers, after a motor became detached from the train. All services on the entire Central line and the Waterloo &amp; City line (which used the same type of train) were suspended, as the trains had to be taken out of service whilst the cause of the failure was determined and appropriate modifications made to the trains.

==Connections==
London Buses routes and night routes serve the station.

<text>Covent Garden () is a London Underground station serving Covent Garden and the surrounding area in the West End of London. It is on the Piccadilly line between Leicester Square and Holborn stations and is in Travelcard Zone 1. The station is at the corner of Long Acre and James Street and the street-level concourse is a Grade II listed building.

==History==
The station was planned by the Great Northern and Strand Railway (GN&amp;SR), which had received parliamentary approval for a route from Wood Green station (now Alexandra Palace) to Strand in 1899. After the GN&amp;SR was taken over by the Brompton and Piccadilly Circus Railway (B&amp;PCR) in September 1901, the two companies came under the control of Charles Yerkes&#x27; Metropolitan District Electric Traction Company before being transferred to his new holding company, the Underground Electric Railways Company of London (UERL) in June 1902. To connect the two companies&#x27; planned routes, the UERL obtained permission for new tunnels between Piccadilly Circus and Holborn. The companies were formally merged as the Great Northern, Piccadilly and Brompton Railway following parliamentary approval in November 1902. The station was opened by the Great Northern, Piccadilly and Brompton Railway on 11 April 1907, four months after services on the rest of the line began operating on 15 December 1906.

In 1929, Covent Garden was suggested for closure in connection with the extension of the Piccadilly line: the elimination of less-busy stations in the central area would improve both reliability and journey times for long-distance commuters, though the closure did not proceed.

In 2011, English Heritage gave the station frontage Grade II listed status, on account of it being a good example of Leslie Green&#x27;s architecture.

==The station today==
===Design===

Like the rest of the original GNP&amp;BR stations, the street level station building and platform tiling were designed by Leslie Green in the Modern Style (British Art Nouveau style). As is commonplace with other Central London stations Green designed, the station building is a classic red &#x27;Oxblood&#x27; building which has two elevations fronting onto the end of James Street and Long Acre. The platform wall was tiled with two shades of yellow and white tiling which formed geometric shapes along with three blank spaces to incorporate the station name. As part of Transport for London&#x27;s investment programme, the ageing tiling dating back from the station&#x27;s opening was replaced in 2010 in a like-for-like basis, retaining the look and feel of the platforms.

====Platform level tiling====
The stations along the central part of the Piccadilly line, as well as some sections of the Northern line, were financed by Charles Yerkes, and are famous for the Leslie Green designed red station buildings and distinctive platform tiling. Each station had its own unique tile pattern and colours.
===Access===

Covent Garden station is one of the few stations in Central London for which platform access is only by lift or an emergency spiral staircase with 193 steps. There are four lifts that give access to street level, although a final flight of stairs from the lifts to the platforms means that the station is wheelchair-inaccessible.

At the bottom of the staircase, numerous posters, warning users of the long climb ahead, suggest they make use of the station’s lifts instead. 

==Proximity to Leicester Square==
The journey between Leicester Square station and Covent Garden takes only about 20 seconds, and measures only , the shortest distance between two adjacent stations on the Underground network. The stations are so close that a pedestrian standing halfway between them on Long Acre can see both tube stations by turning around 180°.

As of 2022, the cash fare for the journey is £6.30, or £36.21 per mile. In 2015, at £29.81/mi, the journey was more expensive per unit distance than the Venice-Simplon Orient Express. Posters at the station give details of the alternative methods of getting to and from Covent Garden using surrounding stations.

==Services and connections==
Train frequencies vary throughout the day, but generally operate every 3–7 minutes in both directions. As a part of the Piccadilly line, the train is served by Night Tube on Friday and Saturday nights.

==Folklore==
It is said that the ghost of actor William Terriss (murdered in 1897) haunts the station. It is claimed that he used to visit a bakery demolished when the station was built. The last reported sighting of Terriss was in 1972.

<text>Hyde Park Corner is a London Underground station near Hyde Park Corner in Hyde Park, London. It is on the Piccadilly line between Knightsbridge and Green Park stations, and is located in Travelcard zone 1. The station is currently inside Wellesley Hotel.

==History==
The station was opened by the Great Northern, Piccadilly and Brompton Railway on 15 December 1906. It was the connecting station between the two original companies, the London United Railway and the Piccadilly and City Railway, who amalgamated after Parliament demanded the entire line from Hammersmith to Finsbury Park should be built as one scheme.

The original, Leslie Green-designed station building still remains to the south of the road junction, notable by its ox-blood coloured tiles; it was until June 2010 used as a pizza restaurant, and since 14 December 2012 it has been the Wellesley Hotel. The building was taken out of use when the station was provided with escalators in place of lifts and a new sub-surface ticket hall that came into use on 23 May 1932 although an emergency stairway provides a connection to the platforms. The lift shafts are now used to provide ventilation. The 1932 station had showcases inset to the walls that showed a series of dioramas depicting the development of the London bus – long gone, some of the scale models survive in the LT Museum Collections.

When the station was rebuilt with escalators the adjacent little-used station at Down Street to the east (towards Green Park) was taken out of use.

==Present day==
It is one of the few stations which have no associated buildings above ground, the station being fully underground. The current entrance to the station is accessed from within the pedestrian underpass system around the Hyde Park Corner junction.

When the central section of the Piccadilly line is closed, the station becomes the terminus of the western part due to the crossover tunnel to the east of the station.

<doc id="373258" wikidata="Q28003" url="?curid=373258" title="Copley Medal">
<text>The Copley Medal is the most prestigious award of the Royal Society, only conferred &quot;for sustained, outstanding achievements in any field of science&quot;. The award alternates between the physical sciences or mathematics and the biological sciences. It is arguably the highest British and Commonwealth award for scientific achievement, and has been included among the most distinguished international scientific awards.

Given annually, the medal is the oldest Royal Society medal awarded and the oldest surviving scientific award in the world, having first been given in 1731 to Stephen Gray, for &quot;his new Electrical Experiments: – as an encouragement to him for the readiness he has always shown in obliging the Society with his discoveries and improvements in this part of Natural Knowledge&quot;. The medal is made of silver-gilt and awarded with a £25,000 prize.

It is awarded to &quot;senior scientists&quot; irrespective of nationality, and nominations are considered over three nomination cycles. Since 2022, scientific teams or research groups are collectively eligible to receive the medal; that year, the research team which developed the Oxford–AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine became the first collective recipient. John Theophilus Desaguliers has won the medal the most often, winning three times, in 1734, 1736 and 1741. In 1976, Dorothy Hodgkin became the first female recipient; Jocelyn Bell Burnell, in 2021, became the second.

== History ==
In 1709, Sir Godfrey Copley, the MP for Thirsk, bequeathed Abraham Hill and Hans Sloane £100 (roughly equivalent to £ in ) to be held in trust for the Royal Society &quot;for improving natural knowledge to be laid out in experiments or otherwise for the benefit thereof as they shall direct and appoint&quot;. After the legacy had been received the following year, the interest of £5 was duly used to provide recurring grants for experimental work to researchers associated with the Royal Society, provided they registered their research within a stipulated period and demonstrated their experiments at an annual meeting. In 1726, following a proposal by Sloane, the grants were extended to &quot;strangers&quot; unaffiliated with the Society to encourage &quot;new and useful experiments,&quot; though it was only five years later that Stephen Gray became the first such recipient. Prior to Gray, John Theophilus Desaguliers was apparently the only recipient of the grant, but had not always conducted the required annual demonstration.

In November 1736, Martin Folkes, then vice-president of the Society, suggested the Copley grant be converted to &quot;a medal or other honorary prize to be bestowed on the person whose experiment should be best approved...a laudable emulation might be excited among men of genius to try their invention, who in all probability may never be moved for the sake of lucre&quot;. On 7 December 1736, the Council of the Royal Society agreed to Folkes&#x27; proposal, passing a resolution that the annual Copley grant of five pounds (roughly equivalent to £ in ) be converted to a gold medal &quot;of the same Value, with the Arms of the Society impress’d on it,&quot; to be gifted &quot;for the best Experiment produced within the Year, and bestowed in such a manner as to avoid any Envy or Disgust in Rivalship&quot;. John Belchier was the first to receive the new award in 1737; due to delays in approving a medal design, however, the medal, designed and struck by John Sigismund Tanner of the Royal Mint, was only presented to Belchier in 1742. Gray and Desaguliers received their medals retrospectively.

Into the early 19th century, medal recipients were selected by the President of the Royal Society, though not always on the basis of publications and experimental demonstrations; political and social connections were also key considerations, along with service in the general interests of the Society. During the long presidency of Joseph Banks, the medal was frequently awarded to recipients whose researches were of a practical or technical nature, involving improvements to scientific equipment or instrument design. In 1831, new regulations adopted by the Royal Society Council made the medal an annual award, dropped the requirement for conducting the qualifying research within a certain period and officially opened it to scientists from any nation; although the medal had previously been awarded to foreign scientists including Alessandro Volta, the majority of recipients had been British subjects. A second donation of £1666 13s. 4d. (roughly equivalent to £ in ) was made by Sir Joseph William Copley in 1881, and the interest from that amount is used to pay for the medal.

==Prestige of the medal==
By the 1840s, the Copley Medal had achieved international prestige; in 1850, George Airy noted the distinction of the medal was that it was &quot;offered to the competition of the world.&quot; The Copley medal has been characterised as a predecessor to the Nobel Prize. Since its inception, it has been awarded to many distinguished scientists, including 52 winners of the Nobel Prize: 17 in Physics, 21 in Physiology or Medicine, and 14 in Chemistry.

<doc id="373259" wikidata="Q1366453" url="?curid=373259" title="Euston Square tube station">
<text>Euston Square () is a London Underground station at the corner of Euston Road and Gower Street, just north of University College London – its main (south) entrance faces the tower of University College Hospital. The multi-interchange Euston station is beyond Euston Square Gardens, which is one street east. The station is between Great Portland Street and King&#x27;s Cross St Pancras stations on the Circle, Hammersmith &amp; City and Metropolitan lines in Travelcard Zone 1.

==History==

The station was opened as Gower Street on 10 January 1863 by the Metropolitan Railway (MR), the world&#x27;s first underground railway. The line runs east–west under Euston Road at this point. The station originally had entrances in single-storey pavilions with stone-effect stucco render on each side of Euston Road with stairs to the platforms.

The MR was constructed using the cut-and-cover method with the tunnel and station platforms directly under the road. The walls to the rear of the platforms were originally lined in buttressed brickwork supporting a brick arch wide and high composed of between six and twelve layers of brickwork. Ventilation shafts lined with glazed white tiling were spaced along the platforms to let in light from openings in the front gardens of the houses at street level.

In 1864, Parliament authorised the North Western and Charing Cross Railway to construct a line to connect the mainline stations at Euston and Charing Cross. This would have connected to the MR to the west of Gower Street, but the company was unable to raise funds. A revised scheme under the name of the London Central Railway (LCR) was approved in 1871. The proposals included an interchange at Gower Street with the LCR&#x27;s platforms north of and parallel to the MR&#x27;s. LCR branches would have connected from east of Gower Street to Euston and St Pancras stations. As before, the LCR was unable to raise funding and the scheme was abandoned in 1874.

In 1890, the MR obtained parliamentary permission to construct a pedestrian subway under Euston Road from the station to the mainline station. This was never constructed.

In 1906, the original timber platforms were reconstructed in concrete as a fire precaution related to the electrification of the MR. The station was given its present name on 1 November 1909.

Between 1929 and 1931, the station buildings were reconstructed to a design by the MR&#x27;s architect C. W. Clark. A bridge was constructed above the tracks so that a single ticket office could be provided in place of the separate ones for each platform. At the same time the station platforms were lengthened requiring the closure of Euston Road to enable the roadway and tunnels to be excavated as quickly as possible. The brick arch of the tunnel roof and the side walls were removed and replaced with a flat roof on steel beams supported by concrete walls to the rear of the new platforms.

During World War II, much of the southern side of Euston Road between Gower Street and Gordon Street was destroyed by bombing. When the site was reconstructed post-war the southern entrance was reconstructed again to incorporate it into the corner of the new building that occupied the site. The north entrance remained. In the 1960s, in conjunction with the construction of an underpass at the junction of Euston Road and Tottenham Court Road, Euston Road was widened. At this time, the north entrance building was demolished and converted to a simple subway entrance.

In the 21st century, the buildings on the south side of Euston Road were again redeveloped and the station entrance was again reconstructed. Since late 2006, the south entrance is incorporated into the corner of the headquarters of the Wellcome Trust with the entrance in Gower Street. A linking pedestrian subway connects under Euston Road from the north side. Since 2011, two lifts provide access between the main entrance and the westbound platform.

==Future==
In December 2005, Network Rail announced plans to create a subway link between the station and Euston station as part of the re-development of Euston station. This will create a direct link for users of main line rail services which depart from Euston. These plans would also be pursued during a rebuilding for High Speed 2.

== Services ==

The station is served by the Metropolitan, Hammersmith &amp; City and Circle lines, between to the east and Great Portland Street to the west. All three lines share the same pair of tracks from Baker Street Junction to Aldgate Junction making this section of track one of the most intensely used on the London Underground network.

=== Circle line ===

The typical service in trains per hour (tph) is:

* 6 clockwise via Liverpool Street and Tower Hill
* 6 tph anti-clockwise to Hammersmith via Paddington

=== Hammersmith &amp; City line ===
The typical service in trains per hour (tph) is:

* 6 tph Eastbound to Barking
* 6 tph Westbound to Hammersmith via Paddington

=== Metropolitan line ===

The Metropolitan line is the only line to operate express services, though currently this is only during peak times (Westbound 06:30-09:30 / Eastbound 16:00-19:00). Fast services run non-stop between Wembley Park, and Moor Park, while semi-fast services run non-stop between Wembley Park and Harrow-On-The-Hill.

The typical off-peak service in trains per hour (tph) is:

* 12 tph Eastbound to Aldgate
* 2 tph Westbound to Amersham (all stations)
* 2 tph Westbound to Chesham (all stations)
* 8 tph Westbound to Uxbridge (all stations)

Off-peak services to/from Watford terminate at Baker Street

The typical peak time service in trains per hour (tph) is:
* 14 tph Eastbound to Aldgate
* 2 tph Westbound to Amersham (fast in the evening peak only)
* 2 tph Westbound to Chesham (fast in the evening peak only)
* 4 tph Westbound to Watford (semi-fast in the evening peak only)
* 6 tph Westbound to Uxbridge (all stations)

==Connections==
That station is served by London Buses day and night routes.

<text>Tower Hill is a London Underground station in Tower Hill in the East End of London. It is on the Circle line between Aldgate and Monument stations, and on the District line between Monument and Aldgate East stations. Tower Hill is within Travelcard zone 1 and is a short distance from Tower Gateway station for the Docklands Light Railway, Fenchurch Street station for National Rail mainline services, and Tower Millennium Pier for River Services.

==History==
The station was built on the site of the former Tower of London station that closed in 1884. The present Tower Hill station opened in 1967 and replaced a nearby station with the same name but which was originally called Mark Lane, that was slightly to the west.

In 2021, Transport for London made Tower Hill the tenth Underground station to replace some standard platform logos with &#x27;poppy roundels&#x27; for the period leading up to Remembrance Day each year. Opposite the station in Trinity Square Gardens is The Merchant Navy Memorial commemorating merchant seafarers lost in the two World Wars and Falklands Campaign who have no grave but the sea. Its total of some 36,000 names is greater than that of any other Commonwealth War Graves Commission memorial in the UK.

==Design==
The entrance to Tower Hill station is a few metres from one of the largest remaining segments of the Roman London Wall which once surrounded the historic City of London. A small section of this wall is visible above the track at the far Eastern end of the Westbound platform, near the ceiling. 

==Services==
Train frequencies vary throughout the day, but the typical off-peak service pattern is:

*District line:
**Eastbound:
***12 tph (trains per hour) to Upminster.
***3 tph to Barking
***3 tph terminate here 
**Westbound:
***6 tph to Ealing Broadway;
***6 tph to Richmond;
***6 tph to Wimbledon.
*Circle line:
**Anti-clockwise:
***6 tph to Hammersmith via Aldgate.
**Clockwise:
***6 tph to Edgware Road via Embankment.

==Future==
A Transport Supporting Paper released by the office of the Mayor of London envisages the closure of Tower Gateway DLR station and the branch serving it, with a replacement interchange being provided via new platforms at Tower Hill tube station. The reasoning is given that currently, 90 per cent of DLR City passengers use Bank station, but only 75 per cent of services go there; this would increase service to Bank from 23tph to 30tph, thereby unlocking more capacity on the Bank branch.

==Connections==
London Buses day and nighttime routes, plus long-distance coach routes serve the station.

<text>Tower Gateway is a Docklands Light Railway (DLR) station in the City of London and is located near the Tower of London and Tower Bridge. It adjoins the tracks to Fenchurch Street station and is located on the site of a former station called Minories. Tower Gateway is within London fare zone 1.

It is a short walk from both Tower Hill Underground station and Fenchurch Street. Access at street level from the Minories is via escalator, stairs or lift at the western end of the station. A pedestrian crossing connects the station with Tower Hill station, its closest London Underground connection. A narrow secondary staircase entrance at the eastern end of the platform, improved considerably in the early 2000s, descends to Mansell Street. It serves the eastern edge of the City of London financial district and development around St Katharine Docks.

==History==

It was opened in 1987 as the western terminus of the initial DLR system and the station closest to central London.

The underground extension to Bank, which opened in 1991, diverges from the original route between Tower Gateway and Shadwell, the next station to the east. It dives down a steep ramp not far from the eastern end of the platforms, from which it is clearly visible. Tower Gateway is the terminus for the less busy service to Beckton. Journeys to other branches of the DLR normally require a change.

In keeping with the DLR&#x27;s original basic lightweight philosophy, Tower Gateway is a simple elevated terminus. As built it had two tracks and a cross-over. When the extension to Bank opened, its importance was substantially reduced. Before reconstruction it had a fairly narrow central platform, and a single track leading from the main route to a set of points immediately prior to the platforms.

Further major alterations began on 30 June 2008. The station reopened on 2 March 2009, rebuilt as a single-track terminus to enable three-car trains with a platform on each side of the train, one for arriving passengers and the other for departures (the Spanish solution).

==Services==
The typical off-peak service in trains per hour from Tower Gateway is 6 tph to and from Beckton via . Additional services run to and from the station during the peak hours, increasing the service up to 8 tph to and from the station.


==Future==
A Transport Supporting Paper released by the office of the Mayor of London envisages the closure of Tower Gateway DLR station and the branch serving it, with a replacement interchange being provided via a new station on the Bank branch connected to Tower Hill station. The reasoning is given that currently, 90 per cent of DLR City passengers use Bank station, but only 75 per cent of services go there; this would increase service to Bank from 23tph to 30tph, thereby unlocking more capacity on the Bank branch. In exchange, services from Fenchurch Street railway station might move to the current Tower Gateway location.

==Connections==
London Buses routes 42, 78, 100, 343 and night route N551 serve the station.

<doc id="373272" wikidata="Q560209" url="?curid=373272" title="Superior Dome">
<text>The Superior Dome is a domed stadium on the campus of Northern Michigan University (NMU) in Marquette, Michigan, United States. It opened as the &quot;world’s largest wooden dome&quot; on September 14, 1991, and is home to the Northern Michigan Wildcats football, women&#x27;s lacrosse, and women&#x27;s track and field teams, the NMU Wildcat marching band, and hosts a variety of other campus and community events.

The dome is tall, has a diameter of , covers an area of and has a volume of 16,135,907 cubic feet. It is a geodesic dome constructed with 781 Douglas fir beams and of fir decking and is designed to support snow up to and withstand winds. It has a permanent seating capacity of 8,000 people, though the building can hold as many as 16,000 people. The 2010 edition of &quot;Guinness World Records&quot; listed it as the fifth-largest dome and largest wooden dome in the world.

==Construction==
The construction was finished in two phases. Phase I was finished in August 1991 and included the construction of the domed complex. Phase II, completed in May 1995, added locker rooms, department offices, meeting rooms, concession areas, a retail store and other building amenities. Phase I of the project cost $21.8 million and was funded entirely by the State of Michigan. Phase II was completed for $2.1 million, with $800,000 in private donations and $1.3 million in loans. Total cost for the Superior Dome stands at $23.9 million. The general contractor for Phase 1 was R.E. Dailey &amp; Company (Perini Corp.), Southfield, MI. The architect was TMP Associates, Bloomfield Hills, MI.

==Use==

The Wildcats football team was the first to christen the Dome, hosting the first event in the facility on September 14, 1991. Northern defeated Indianapolis, 31–20, in front of a crowd of 7,942. Later that season, a Superior Dome attendance record was set at 8,432, when Northern defeated Ferris State, 27–17, on October 5. On September 18, 2008, a new attendance record was set as 8,672 watched Northern lose to the Michigan Tech Huskies in a televised game.

The dome features a retractable artificial turf carpet, the largest of its kind in the world. When extended, the turf can accommodate football, soccer and field hockey. Underneath the carpet is a synthetic playing surface that features three basketball/volleyball courts, two tennis courts and a track. The carpet is winched in and out of place on a cushion of air. Retracting the turf carpet takes 30 minutes, with full setup taking approximately two hours.

The Superior Dome is also host to a number of campus and community events, including the Michigan High School Athletic Association 8 man football championship games, Marquette Marathon, trade shows (approximately of space), conventions, conferences, banquets, high school track meets, the Upper Peninsula &quot;Band Day&quot; competition/exhibition, Special Olympics and NMU&#x27;s commencement exercises.

President George W. Bush held a campaign rally in the stadium during the 2004 Presidential campaign.

The Superior Dome was host to a historic exhibition basketball game on October 13, 2024 where Northern Michigan lost to Michigan State with a final score of 70–53. Known as the Superior Dome Showdown, this event was the first to ever be broadcast on the Big Ten Network from the Superior Dome. It was put on as a homecoming for the Spartans&#x27; head coach Tom Izzo, an alumnus of Northern Michigan, where his number 10 jersey was retired during the game. The dome was retrofitted with a basketball court and over 3,000 extra seats for the game and new attendance record was set with a sold-out audience of over 11,000.

<text>Shadwell is a station on the Windrush line of the London Overground, located in Shadwell, East London. The station is between Whitechapel station to the north and to the south, in Travelcard Zone 2. Both platforms, which are located underground, are decorated with enamel panels designed by Sarah McMenemy in 1995.

Shadwell was formerly a London Underground station on the East London line until 2007, when the East London line extension project converted the station to Overground operation. There is an official out-of-station interchange with Shadwell DLR station on the Docklands Light Railway, located walk away. 

==History==
===London Underground===
The original station was one of the oldest on the network, and was built over a spring. First opened by the East London Railway on 10 April 1876, it was first served by the District Railway and Metropolitan Railway on 1 October 1884. It was renamed &quot;Shadwell &amp; St. George-in-the-East&quot; on 1 July 1900, but reverted to its original name in 1918. A new ticket hall was built on Cable Street in 1983, replacing the original building in Watney Street, which was demolished in May 2010. Access to the station platforms was through lifts or stairs. The station was closed between 1995 and 1998, owing to repair work on the East London line&#x27;s Thames Tunnel. The typical off-peak East London line service from the station was:

*9 tph to 
*5 tph to 
*4 tph to 

===London Overground===
The station closed on 22 December 2007; it reopened on 27 April 2010 for a preview service to and , and from 23 May 2010, the latter service was extended to West Croydon / , operated within the London Overground network. A new gated northern access fronting Cornwall Street has been added, easing interchange with Shadwell DLR station, while the rest of the station has been heavily refurbished.

==Services==
All times below are correct as of the December 2012 timetables.

===London Overground===
====Windrush line====
There is a service every 3–5 minutes throughout the day on the Windrush line. Current hourly off-peak frequency is:

*16 tph to Dalston Junction, of which 8 continue to Highbury &amp; Islington
*4 tph to West Croydon
*4 tph to 
*4 tph to 
*4 tph to via 

==Connections==
London Buses routes 100, 339 and D3 serve the station.

<text>Cernavodă () is a town in Constanța County, Northern Dobruja, Romania with a population of 15,088 as of 2021.

The town&#x27;s name is derived from the Bulgarian &quot;černa voda&quot; ( in Cyrillic), meaning &#x27;black water&#x27;. This name is regarded by some scholars as a calque of the earlier Thracian name &quot;Axíopa&quot;, from IE *&quot;n̥ksei&quot; &#x27;dark&#x27; and &quot;upā&quot; &#x27;water&#x27; (cf. Avestan &quot;axšaēna-&quot; &#x27;dark&#x27; and Lithuanian &quot;ùpė&quot; &#x27;river, creek&#x27;).

==Economy==
The town is a Danube fluvial port. It houses the Cernavodă Nuclear Power Plant, consisting of two CANDU reactors providing about 18% of Romania&#x27;s electrical energy output. The second reactor was built through a joint venture between Canada&#x27;s Atomic Energy of Canada Limited and Italy&#x27;s ANSALDO and became fully functional in November 2007.

The Danube–Black Sea Canal, opened in 1984, runs from Cernavodă to Agigea and Năvodari.

The outskirts of Cernavodă host numerous vineyards, producers of Chardonnay wine. The largest winery in the area is Murfatlar.

==History==
Cernavodă was founded under the name &quot;Axiopolis&quot; by the ancient Greeks in the 4th century BC as a trading post for contacts with local Dacians. A Roman fort was built as part of the defensive frontier system of the Moesian Limes along the Danube.

The railroad from Constanța to Cernavodă was opened in 1860 by the Ottoman administration.

Cernavodă was one of the capitals of the short-lived Silistra Nouă County (1878–1879).

The town gives its name to the late copper age Cernavodă archaeological culture, ca. 4000–3200 BC.

==Demographics==
At the 2021 census Cernavodă had a population of 15,088 with a majority of Romanians (80.4%) and minorities of Turks (2.23%), Roma (0.66%), Lipovans (0.47%), Tatars (0.15%), Hungarians (0.05%), Bulgarians (0.02%), others (0.7%) and unknown (15.32%). 

At the 2011 census Cernavodă had 16,129 inhabitants; of those, 14,969 were Romanians (92.81%), 463 Turks (2.87%), 374 Roma (2.32%), 106 Lipovans (0.66%), 40 Tatars (0.25%), 15 Hungarians (0.09%), and 162 others.

==Natives==
* Iulian Carabela (born 1996), footballer
* Alexandru Claudian (1898–1962), sociologist, political figure, and poet
* Iosipos Moisiodax (1725–1800), philosopher, deacon, and educator

<doc id="373278" wikidata="Q11348833" url="?curid=373278" title="Lie group decomposition">
<text>In mathematics, Lie group decompositions are used to analyse the structure of Lie groups and associated objects, by showing how they are built up out of subgroups. They are essential technical tools in the representation theory of Lie groups and Lie algebras; they can also be used to study the algebraic topology of such groups and associated homogeneous spaces. Since the use of Lie group methods became one of the standard techniques in twentieth century mathematics, many phenomena can now be referred back to decompositions.

The same ideas are often applied to Lie groups, Lie algebras, algebraic groups and p-adic number analogues, making it harder to summarise the facts into a unified theory.

==List of decompositions==
* The Jordan–Chevalley decomposition of an element in algebraic group as a product of semisimple and unipotent elements
* The Bruhat decomposition formula_1 of a semisimple algebraic group into double cosets of a Borel subgroup can be regarded as a generalization of the principle of Gauss–Jordan elimination, which generically writes a matrix as the product of an upper triangular matrix with a lower triangular matrix—but with exceptional cases. It is related to the Schubert cell decomposition of Grassmannians: see Weyl group for more details.
*The Cartan decomposition writes a semisimple real Lie algebra as the sum of eigenspaces of a Cartan involution.
* The Iwasawa decomposition formula_2 of a semisimple group formula_3 as the product of compact, abelian, and nilpotent subgroups generalises the way a square real matrix can be written as a product of an orthogonal matrix and an upper triangular matrix (a consequence of Gram–Schmidt orthogonalization).
*The Langlands decomposition formula_4 writes a parabolic subgroup formula_5 of a Lie group as the product of semisimple, abelian, and nilpotent subgroups.
* The Levi decomposition writes a finite dimensional Lie algebra as a semidirect product of a solvable ideal and a semisimple subalgebra.
* The LU decomposition of a dense subset in the general linear group. It can be considered as a special case of the Bruhat decomposition.
* The Birkhoff decomposition, a special case of the Bruhat decomposition for affine groups.

<text>Sir William Patrick Deane, (born 4 January 1931) is an Australian barrister and jurist who served as the 22nd governor-general of Australia, in office from 1996 to 2001. He was previously a Justice of the High Court of Australia from 1982 to 1995.

Deane received his undergraduate education at the University of Sydney, and later studied international law at The Hague Academy of International Law in the Netherlands. Prior to joining the judiciary, Deane worked for periods as a barrister and university lecturer. He was appointed to the Supreme Court of New South Wales in 1977, and later that year was also appointed to the Federal Court of Australia. Deane was elevated to the High Court in 1982, and during his tenure was generally considered to fall on the court&#x27;s progressive side. He retired from the court in 1995, and the following year was appointed governor-general on the recommendation of Paul Keating. Deane had a low profile during his five-year term, facing no major constitutional issues, but did come to international notice by officially opening the 2000 Summer Olympics.

==Early life==
Deane was born on 4 January 1931 in Melbourne. He was the youngest of three children and only son born to Lillian Elizabeth () and Cornelius Aloysius Deane. His father grew up in a large Catholic family in Wahring, Victoria, and won the Military Cross during World War I. He later worked as a patent examiner. The family moved to Canberra in 1933, and Deane grew up in the suburb of Griffith. He attended St Christopher&#x27;s Convent School in Manuka and later boarded in Sydney at St Joseph&#x27;s College, Hunters Hill. He won an exhibition and Canberra scholarship to attend the University of Sydney, where he graduated Bachelor of Arts and Bachelor of Laws and &quot;won numerous scholarships, exhibitions and prizes&quot;. He was a member of the staff of the &quot;Sydney Law Review&quot; and served on the Student&#x27;s Representative Council and as secretary and vice-president of the Sydney University Law Society. He also trained with the University Air Squadron and attained a pilot&#x27;s licence. In 1954 Deane won a Rotary Foundation Fellowship to undertake postgraduate studies in Europe. He was awarded a diploma from The Hague Academy of International Law in 1955.

After graduation, Deane worked in the federal Attorney-General&#x27;s Department in Canberra and at the law firm Minter Simpson (later to become Minter Ellison). He was called to the Sydney Bar in 1957 and also lectured in law at university.

Deane joined the Democratic Labor Party (DLP) in the 1950s and served on the party&#x27;s executive. He later recalled having &quot;very strong views on the threat of communism&quot; at the time. He subsequently became disillusioned by factional disputes and ceased to have any involvement in politics.

==Judicial career==
In 1977, Deane was appointed a Judge of the Supreme Court of New South Wales and, in the same year, he was appointed to the Federal Court of Australia and as President of the Australian Trade Practices Tribunal. In June 1982 he was appointed to the High Court of Australia, replacing Sir Ninian Stephen on his appointment as Governor-General. He received a knighthood in August 1982. On the court he formed part of the majority which recognised native title in the landmark &quot;Mabo&quot; case of 1992.

==Governor-General==

In August 1995, the Labor Prime Minister, Paul Keating, announced that Elizabeth II, Queen of Australia had agreed to the appointment of Deane as Governor-General to succeed Bill Hayden. Deane retired from the High Court in November and was sworn in as Governor-General on 16 February 1996. Less than a month later the Liberal/National coalition led by John Howard defeated Keating&#x27;s government in the 1996 Australian federal election.

Deane was Australia&#x27;s first Catholic governor-general. He &quot;represented the Catholic social justice position on just about every issue that came forward&quot;.

On 28 August 1996, as governor-general, Deane, issued a proclamation that officially established 3 September as Australian National Flag Day.

As governor-general, Deane received praise for his role in publicly mourning the victims of tragedies that took place during his term in office, including the Port Arthur massacre (1996), the Thredbo landslide (1997) the Swiss canyoning disaster (1999) and the Childers Palace Backpackers Hostel fire (2000). His speech in Switzerland titled &quot;It is still winter at home&quot; was especially well received. He also was asked to deliver the eulogies at the funerals of several prominent Australians, including Sir Donald Bradman, Nugget Coombs, Dame Roma Mitchell, Sir Marcus Oliphant, and Mum Shirl.

Deane&#x27;s term of office was due to expire on 31 December 2000, but was extended by six months to cover the Centenary of Federation celebrations. Upon leaving office in June 2001, he stated that his main regret as governor-general was that Australia did not achieve Reconciliation by the end of the 20th century as he had hoped. Howard stated he had &quot;displayed an unfailing interest in the place of the disadvantaged within Australian society&quot;.

===Olympics===

Deane officially opened the 2000 Summer Olympics, giving a brief speech in front of a crowd of 110,000 people at the Sydney Olympic Stadium. Prime Minister John Howard had originally planned to open the games himself, with the agreement of the organizing committee and the International Olympic Committee (IOC). However, in November 1999 he changed his mind and advised the IOC that Deane would be opening the games. Howard said this was due to &quot;a concern that my opening the Olympic Games would become a party political issue [...] I think in the long run it&#x27;ll be better for the Olympic Games for the Governor-General to open them because we will be removing that one area of political controversy&quot;. Members of the opposition Labor Party had advocated that the Queen be asked to perform the honours, arguing that it was hypocritical for Howard to support the retention of the monarchy at the 1999 republic referendum but not call upon the Queen to represent Australia.

==Later years==
As of Deane acted as Patron or co-Patron of a large number of charitable organisations working for the disadvantaged, including Matthew Talbot Homeless Services, Father Chris Riley&#x27;s Youth off the Streets, the Starlight Foundation and the Australian Indigenous Education Foundation. He was also a Patron of Reconciliation Australia and of the Australian Indigenous Doctors Association.

The A.C.T. Government appointed him as Patron of the National Capital&#x27;s 2013 Centenary Celebrations.

Deane is a former Patron and Chair of international aid-organization CARE Australia and a member of its advisory board.

==Honours==
Deane was appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire (KBE) on 10 August 1982, a few weeks after being appointed to the High Court. On Australia Day 1988, he was made a Companion of the Order of Australia (AC). He is also a Knight Commander with Star of the Papal Order of St. Gregory the Great and a Knight of the Venerable Order of St. John.

In 2001, Deane was awarded the Sydney Peace Prize &quot;for his consistent support of vulnerable and disadvantaged Australians and his strong commitment to the cause of reconciliation&quot;.

==Personal life==
Deane married solicitor Helen Russell on 6 January 1965. The couple had one son and one daughter. He was described in 2002 as &quot;a devout Catholic who regularly attends Mass at St Christopher&#x27;s, Canberra&quot;.

<text>Kurt Schneider (7 January 1887 – 27 October 1967) was a German psychiatrist known largely for his writing on the diagnosis and understanding of schizophrenia, as well as personality disorders then known as psychopathic personalities.

==Biography==
Schneider was born in Crailsheim, Kingdom of Württemberg in 1887. He began his psychiatric training in Cologne; however, his training was interrupted by the first World War, in which he served on the Western Front. When his post-war career began, Schneider was influenced and mentored by Max Scheler, a philosophy professor and one of the co-founders of the phenomenological movement in philosophy. Scheler served as Schneider’s supervisor for his postgraduate degree in philosophy in 1921.  Schneider applied Scheler’s theory of emotions to his studies and this theory was the topic of his first major publications.

In 1931 he became director of the German Psychiatric Research Institute in Munich, which was founded by Emil Kraepelin. Disgusted by the developing tide of psychiatric eugenics championed by the Nazi Party, Schneider left the institute, but did serve as a doctor for the German armed forces during World War II.

After the war, academics who had not taken part in the Nazi eugenics policies were appointed to serve in, and rebuild Germany&#x27;s medical institutions. Schneider was appointed Dean of the Medical School at Heidelberg University and remained there until his retirement in 1955.

==Heidelberg School of Psychiatry==
Schneider and Karl Jaspers founded the Heidelberg school of psychiatry.

== Publications ==
Schneider also wrote and published many books and articles; his first book on psychopathic personalities in 1923 ran to nine editions and discussed the psychological differences between two sorts of depressive conditions – melancholic and reactive. Schneider’s publication, “First Rank Symptoms,” remains one of his most notable contributions to the field of psychiatry and outlined the diagnostic criteria for schizophrenia. Even though he published “First Rank Symptoms” in 1939, the work remained unnoticed until much later, primarily due to the Second World War. His paper, &quot;The Stratification of Emotional Life and the Structure of Depressive States&quot;, was noted as one of the first applications of phenomenological philosophy to psychiatry. His most historically significant publication, &quot;Clinical Psychopathology&quot; was originally published in 1946, but it was later titled &quot;Beiträge zur Psychiatrie&quot;. In its third edition, it was titled &quot;Klinische Psychopathologie&quot;, before its final edition, which was translated into English as &quot;Clinical Psychopathology&quot;.

==Contributions to psychiatry==
Schneider was concerned with improving the method of diagnosis in psychiatry. He contributed to diagnostic procedures and the definition of disorders in the following areas of psychiatry:

===Mood disorders===
Schneider coined the terms &quot;endogenous depression&quot;, derived from Emil Kraepelin&#x27;s use of the adjective to mean biological in origin, and &quot;reactive depression&quot;, more usually seen in outpatients, in 1920.

===Schizophrenia===
Like Karl Jaspers, Schneider particularly championed diagnoses based on the form, rather than the content of a sign or symptom. For example, he argued that a delusion should not be diagnosed by the content of the belief, but by the way in which a belief is held.

He was also concerned with differentiating schizophrenia from other forms of psychosis, by listing the psychotic symptoms that are particularly characteristic of schizophrenia. These have become known as Schneiderian First-Rank Symptoms or simply, first-rank symptoms.

==== First-rank symptoms ====
* Auditory hallucinations.
** Auditory hallucinations taking the form of a voice or voices repeating the subject&#x27;s thoughts out loud.
** Auditory hallucinations discussing the subject or arguing about them and referring to them in the third person.
** Auditory hallucinations discussing the patient&#x27;s thoughts as or before they occur.
** Auditory hallucinations taking the form of a commentary on the subject&#x27;s thoughts or behavior.
* The experience of intrusion of unusual ideas or thoughts into the subject&#x27;s mind as a result of the action of some external agency (thought insertion).
* The experience that the subject&#x27;s thinking is no longer confined within their own mind but is shared by or is accessible to other people (thought broadcasting).
* The experience of being deprived of thought as a result of the removal of the subject&#x27;s thoughts from the mind by some person or influence (thought withdrawal).
* The experience that actions, sensations, bodily movements, emotions or thought processes are generated by an outside agency that takes over the will of the subject (passivity experiences).
* Primary delusions: beliefs arising suddenly ‘out of a clear blue sky’ from a normal perception which would seem commonplace and unrelated to others but which nevertheless generates an unshakable delusional conviction.
* Delusional perception - the belief that a normal perception has special significance or meaning.

The reliability of using first-rank symptoms for the diagnosis of schizophrenia has since been questioned, although the terms might still be used descriptively by mental health professionals who do not use them as diagnostic aids.

Individuals with complex dissociative disorders, like dissociative identity disorder, experience significantly more first-rank symptoms than patients with schizophrenia though patients with DID lack the negative symptoms of schizophrenia and normally do not mistake hallucinations for reality.
Differentiating between dissociative identity disorder and psychotic disorders is not done by listing first-rank symptoms as these conditions have a considerable overlap yet a different overall clinical picture and treatment approach.

===Psychopathic personalities===

Schneider also played a key role in developing concepts of psychopathy, used in a broad sense to mean personality disorder or particularly the connotation of Gemütlose psychopathy with antisocial personality disorder. He published the influential &#x27;The Psychopathic Personalities&#x27; in 1923. This was based in part on his earlier 1921 work &#x27;The Personality and Fate of Registered Prostitutes&#x27; where he outlined 12 character types.

Schneider sought to put psychopathy diagnoses on a morally neutral and scientific footing. He defined abnormal personality as a statistical deviation from the norm, vaguely conceptualised. He thought very creative or intelligent people had abnormal personalities by definition, but defined the psychopathic personality as those who suffered from their abnormal personality or caused suffering to society because of it. He did not see these as mental illnesses as such - thus adding to a divide, contrary to Eugen Bleuler for example, between those considered psychotic and those considered psychopathic.

Schneider&#x27;s unsystematic typology was based on his clinical views. He proposed 10 psychopathic personalities: those showing abnormal mood/activity; the insecure sensitive and insecure anankastic (drifting, feckless); fanatics; self-assertive; emotionally unstable; explosive; Gemütlose; Haltlose and asthenic.

Schneider&#x27;s work in this respect is said to have influenced all future descriptive typologies, including the current classifications of personality disorders in the DSM-V and ICD-11. Nevertheless, Schneider is considered to not exactly have succeeded in his attempted and claimed production of a value-free non-judgmental diagnostic system. In fact, Schneider&#x27;s mixing of the medical and the moral has been described as the most noteworthy aspect of this work, which has been linked back to German reception of Cesare Lombroso&#x27;s theory of the &#x27;born criminal&#x27;, redefined by Emil Kraepelin and others (see also Koch) in to psychiatric terms as a &#x27;moral defect&#x27;. After World War I it lived on in Schneider&#x27;s &#x27;gemütlos&#x27; (compassionless) psychopaths, or what Karl Birnbaum called &#x27;amoral&#x27; psychopaths. It has been described as remarkable that Schneider criticized Kraepelin and others for basing their personality diagnoses on moral judgments, yet appeared to do so himself. For example, Schneider admitted that the &#x27;suffering of society&#x27; was a &#x27;totally subjective&#x27; and &#x27;teleological’ criterion for defining psychopathic personalities, but said that in &#x27;scientific studies&#x27; this could be avoided by operating by the broader statistical category of abnormal personalities, which he believed were always congenital and therefore largely hereditary. The attempt to the problem of value judgments has been described as &#x27;clearly unsatisfactory&#x27;.

<text>Lewisham is an interchange station in Lewisham, south-east London, for Docklands Light Railway (DLR) and National Rail services. 

On the National Rail network, it is as measured from and is operated by Southeastern.

==Station layout==
There are four platforms for main-line trains: 3 and 4 on the North Kent Line, and 1 and 2 on the Mid-Kent line which is also used as a loop off the South Eastern Main Line.

The current station, which dates back to 1857, is constructed of yellow stock brick with stone dressing. Behind it survives, rather unusually, a wooden clapboard building. The facade is symmetrical, with three windows, three entrance doors, and three windows.

The original doors, sash windows, skirting, tiling, and banisters are present inside. The original corniced ceiling of the main hall is currently concealed by a lowered fake ceiling. Platform 3 has kept its original canopy with its elaborate cast iron brackets which depict cherries. Some of the original chamfered wood and cast iron supports of the original canopy survive on Platform 2.

The station has similarities with other listed stations built at around the same time such as the listed Ladywell railway station, Blackheath railway station and Gravesend railway station which has the same elaborate cast iron supporting brackets as can be found at Lewisham.

Platforms 5 and 6 are served by Docklands Light Railway trains to Bank and Stratford. The Docklands Light Railway station opened in 1999 following a southward extension from Island Gardens. The original canopy over Platform 4 was demolished at some point after 1990.

The original canopy over the main entrance was demolished in 2009 at a cost of £790k and replaced with a steel version.

From December 2009, Lewisham was fitted with electric ticket gates, in line with the Government&#x27;s new strategy to give all Greater London National Rail stations Oyster card accessibility and closing access to those who attempt to travel without tickets. This was controversial as it involved the closure of the gate on Platform 4 and led to a petition signed by over 1,000.

British Transport Police also maintains a neighbourhood policing presence at Lewisham.

== History ==

===Opening and early years (1849–1922)===
The North Kent line opened on 30 July 1849 by the South Eastern Railway linking Strood with the London and Greenwich Railway route to London Bridge. The original station was located east of the Lewisham Road overbridge with access off Lewisham Road.

With the opening of the Mid-Kent line on 1 January 1857 a new station was built to the west so both lines could be served. For a period Old Lewisham Station was also kept open.

Eleven passengers were killed in the 1857 Lewisham rail crash when a train ran into the back of a stationary train.

In 1898 the South Eastern Railway and the London Chatham and Dover Railway agreed to work as one railway company under the name of the South Eastern and Chatham Railway.

=== Southern Railway (1923–1947)===
Following the Railways Act 1921 (also known as the Grouping Act), Lewisham became a Southern Railway station on 1 January 1923.

The Mid-Kent line was electrified with services commencing on 28 February 1926.

The North Kent Line was electrified with the (750 V DC third rail) system. Electrification was initially to Dartford (6 June 1926) and was extended to Gillingham by the Second World War.

In 1929 large-scale remodelling of the junction was undertaken to enable cross-London freight traffic to be routed via Nunhead and Loughborough Junction. The new route utilised part of the former Greenwich Park branch (which had closed in 1917) and included an overpass.

The loop between Lewisham and the main line towards Hither Green, which had opened in 1929, was electrified on 16 July 1933, allowing Sidcup and Orpington local electric services to call.

The Nunhead line was electrified in summer 1935 and opened to electric traffic on 30 September 1935, with services from Bexleyheath and Sidcup to St Paul&#x27;s (later renamed Blackfriars). This service was cancelled during the Second World War as an economy measure, and recommenced on 12 August 1946.

===British Railways (1948–1994)===
After the Second World War and following nationalisation on 1 January 1948, the station fell under the auspices of British Railways Southern Region.

On 4 December 1957, the Lewisham rail crash occurred to the west of the station; there were 90 fatalities.

As part of the London Bridge re-signalling, a new loop line was opened with a reversible track down to the west (Fast Line) side of St Johns, which opened up on 1 April 1976.

Upon sectorisation in 1982, three passenger sectors were created: Provincial (later renamed Regional Railways) for local services outside of the London area; InterCity, operating principal express services; and London &amp; South East (renamed Network SouthEast in 1986) who operated commuter services in the London area.

===Franchise (1994–present day)===

Following de-nationalisation of British Rail on 1 April 1994 the infrastructure to St Johns station became the responsibility of Railtrack whilst a business unit operated the train services. On 13 October 1996 operation of the passenger services passed to Connex South Eastern who were originally due to run the franchise until 2011.

On 22 November 1999 Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott opened the 4·2 km Lewisham extension of London&#x27;s Docklands Light Railway with trains running through to Bank.

Following a number of accidents and financial issues Railtrack plc was sold to Network Rail on 3 October 2002 who became responsible for the infrastructure.

On 27 June 2003, the Strategic Rail Authority decided to strip Connex of the franchise citing poor financial management and run the franchise itself. Connex South Eastern continued to operate the franchise until 8 November 2003; the services transferred to the Strategic Rail Authority&#x27;s South Eastern Trains subsidiary the following day.

On 30 November 2005, the Department for Transport awarded Govia the Integrated Kent franchise. The services operated by South Eastern Trains transferred to Southeastern on 1 April 2006.

The loop line to St Johns was doubled in 2013.

There was formerly a bus terminus within the station, but this was relocated to Thurston Road as part of the Lewisham Gateway project.

==Incidents==
*On 4 December 1957, the Lewisham rail crash occurred to the west of the station, in which there were 90 fatalities. A plaque at the station commemorates this incident.
*In the early morning hours of 24 January 2017, a GB Railfreight train travelling from Grain to Neasden derailed at Lewisham. Although no railway workers or passengers were injured in the derailment, it caused widespread disruption across the Southeastern system, with numerous delays and cancellations for the day.
*On the evening of 2 March 2018, during exceptionally cold weather, several trains were delayed close to the station and passengers evacuated the train and went onto the tracks.

== Planned London Underground services ==

=== Fleet line service ===
In 1971 and 1972, parliamentary approval was given for construction of Phases 2 and 3 of the planned Fleet line. Phase 3 of the proposal would have extended the line from Fenchurch Street to Lewisham, with new platforms constructed underground. Further plans for Phase 4 of the extension considered the line taking over the mainline tracks on the Addiscombe and Hayes branch lines. Preliminary construction works were carried out elsewhere on the extension before the plan was postponed by lack of funds. Following a change of name to &quot;Jubilee line&quot;, the first part of the line opened in 1979, but the remaining plans were not carried out. When the Jubilee line was extended in 1999, a different route to Stratford was followed.

=== Bakerloo line service ===
TfL is currently considering extending the Bakerloo line to Lewisham. Both line options stop at Lewisham. If progressed the station is currently expected to open in 2030.

In its draft Kent Route Utilisation Strategy, Network Rail mentions the possibility of extending the Bakerloo line from Elephant &amp; Castle to Lewisham, and then taking over the Hayes branch line. Network Rail states that this would free up six paths per hour into central London and so increasing capacity on the Tonbridge main line, which would also relieve the junctions around Lewisham.

==Services==
Lewisham is the southern terminus of the DLR, the previous station being Elverson Road. It is on the boundary of Travelcard Zone 2 and Zone 3 and is a major transport hub, with many buses passing through or terminating here.

During infrastructure works on the Greenwich Line, Thameslink services are normally diverted through Lewisham, giving it a temporary link to Luton in the north and Rainham in the east.
===National Rail===

National Rail services at Lewisham are operated by Southeastern using , , and EMUs.

The typical off-peak service in trains per hour is:

* 6 tph to London Charing Cross (non-stop to )
* 4 tph to London Cannon Street (all stations)
* 2 tph to 
* 2 tph to via 
* 2 tph to via 
* 2 tph to via 
* 2 tph to via , continuing to London Cannon Street via and 
* 2 tph to Dartford via Bexleyheath 
* 2 tph to via Woolwich Arsenal

Additional trains serve the station during the peak hours.

===Docklands Light Railway===
The typical off-peak DLR service from Lewisham is 12 trains per hour to and from Bank. Additional services run to and from the station during the peak hours, increasing the service to up to 22 trains per hour, with up to 8 trains per hour running to and from instead of Bank.






==Connections==

London Buses routes 21, 47, 75, 89, 129, 136, 178, 181, 185, 199, 208, 225, 261, 273, 284, 321, 380, 436, 484, P4, school route 621 and night routes N21, N89, N136 and N199 serve the station.

Lewisham previously had an adjoining bus station for terminating routes. The station closed on 28 February 2014 for the major Lewisham Gateway redevelopment project.

<doc id="373289" wikidata="Q1147128" url="?curid=373289" title="Gusli">
<text>The gusli () is the oldest East Slavic multi-string plucked instrument, belonging to the zither family, due to its strings being parallel to its resonance board. Its roots lie in Veliky Novgorod in Novgorodian Republic. It has its relatives in Europe and throughout the world: kantele in Finland, kannel in Estonia, kanklės in Lithuania, kokles in Latvia, Zither in Germany, citera in the Czech Republic, and psalterium in France. Furthermore, the kanun has been found in Arabic countries, and the autoharp, in the United States. It is also related to such ancient instruments as Chinese gu zheng, which has a thousand-year history, and its Japanese relative koto. A stringed musical instrument called is listed as one of the Me in ancient Sumer.

==Etymology==

The term &quot;gusli&quot; derives from the verb *gǫsti (make sound, howl, play music) with the suffix *slь (from Proto-Indo-European *-trom). In the times of the Kievan Rus&#x27;, the term &quot;gusli&quot; is believed to have simply referred to any generic stringed instrument. The root of the term comes from a word meaning &quot;make sound in the wind.&quot; The term was eventually associated with the trapezoidal &quot;gusli-psaltyry&quot; (which may have originated in Byzantium).

==History==

The &quot;gusli&quot; is one of the oldest musical instruments that have played an important role in the Russian music culture. Vertkov states that the first mentions of the &quot;gusli&quot; date back to 591 AD to a treatise by the Greek historian Theophylact Simocatta which describes the instrument being used by Slavs from the area of the later Kievan Rus&#x27; kingdom. However, it is not exactly clear what instrument was meant by that word, because in Old Slavic or Old Russian &quot;gusli&quot; was used to refer to any stringed instrument. The first documented gusli were recorded in 1170 in Veliky Novgorod in Novgorodian Rus&#x27;. The Greek historian Theophan also mentioned the &quot;gusli&quot;. During the war at the end of the 6th century, the Greeks took Slavonic prisoners and found a musical instrument named the &quot;Gusli&quot;. This corresponds to what the Arabic authors Al-Masudi and Ibn-Dasta mentioned in the 10th century.

The &quot;gusli&quot; are thought to have been the instrument used by the legendary Boyan (a singer of tales) described in the Lay of Igor&#x27;s campaign.

The instruments were used by the wandering Skomorokh musicians and entertainers. Preserved instruments discovered by archaeologists in various digs have between five and nine strings with one example having twelve strings.

==Types==
Folk &quot;Gusli&quot; have from eleven to thirty-six gut or metal strings, tuned diatonically. 

There were two main forms: 

* helmet-shaped &quot;(Shlemovidnye gusli – )&quot;
* wing-shaped &quot;(Krylovidnye gusli)&quot;.

===&quot;Shlemovidnye gusli&quot;===
&quot;Shlemovidnye gusli&quot; (Helmet-shaped gusli; ) is a variety of Gusli held by the musician on his knees, so that the strings are horizontal, the resonator body under them. He uses his left hand to mute unnecessary strings and thus form chords, while strumming all the strings with his right hand. The instrument was spread in southern and western regions of Kievan Rus&#x27;.
===&quot;Krylovidnye gusli&quot;===
&quot;Krylovidnye gusli&quot; (&quot;wing-shaped gusli&quot;; ) is much smaller, and has more resemblance to Baltic psaltery such as the kankles, kokles, kannel and kantele. They are held much more like modern guitars (although the strings are still muted by the left hand through a special opening in the instrument&#x27;s body). This modification was more prevalent in northern parts of Russia, especially Novgorod and Pskov.

===&quot;Keyboard Gusli&quot;===
The &quot;Keyboard Gusli&quot; [&quot;Claviroobraznie Gusli&quot; | &quot;(&quot;)] is a heavily strung 19th-century variant with an iron frame, supported on a stand or with table legs. It has a one-octave piano-type chromatic keyboard. Pressing a key raises the dampers on all strings of that note. Pressing the keys for a chord enables its arpeggiated execution.

==Related instruments==

A number of Slavic folk music instruments have names which are related to Gusli such as the Czech violin &quot;housle&quot; and the Balkan one-stringed fiddle &quot;gusle&quot;. In western Ukraine and Belarus, &quot;husli&quot; can also refer to a fiddle or even a ducted flute. The violin-like variant of the instrument is also related to the South Slavic gusle.

The psaltery variant is related to the zither. It is also related to the Lithuanian kanklės, the Latvian kokles, the Estonian kannel and the Finnish kantele. Together these instruments make up the family known as Baltic psalteries.

A related instrument is the &quot;tsymbaly&quot;, a hammered dulcimer.

In Ukraine, it is thought that the gusli may have influenced the development of the multi-stringed bandura, which largely replaced it in the nineteenth century.

<doc id="373290" wikidata="Q7534861" url="?curid=373290" title="Ski Club of Great Britain">
<text>The Ski Club of Great Britain is a not-for-profit recreational snow sports club. It was founded on 6 May 1903 during a meeting at the Hotel Café Royal in London. Until the 1960s, the Ski Club of Great Britain was responsible for British Alpine ski racing teams.

In April 2020, the Ski Club had about 23,000 members, making it the largest membership-based snow sports club in the UK. 

==History==
The aims of the club, as outlined at the very first meeting, are to encourage people to learn to ski; help members to improve; get more enjoyment from skiing; and bring together people who are interested in the sport.

Before World War I, the club was primarily concerned with cross country (Nordic) skiing. The first official Ski Championship of Great Britain was held in Saanenmöser, Switzerland in 1914. The results were based on performance in cross country and ski jumping.

The first British Ski Championships to include Alpine skiing took place in Wengen on 6-7 January 1921. The championships were organised by Sir Arnold Lunn on behalf of the Ski Club. Sir Arnold Lunn was a central figure in this period of the Ski Club&#x27;s history and the development of ski racing, setting the first modern slalom in Murren in 1922 and helping to persuade the International Olympic Committee to include downhill and slalom in the 1936 Winter Olympic Games in Garmisch-Partenkirchen.

In the mid-1920s, the Ski Club began providing snow and weather reports for national newspapers.

The National Ski Federation of Great Britain (later the British Ski and Snowboard Federation) was founded in 1964 as the governing body for alpine skiing in Britain. The Ski Club of Great Britain thereafter became aligned more closely with recreational skiing.

==Member Services==

=== Ski Club Leaders===

The Ski Club sent its first representatives to the Alps in 1928. The Ski Club and its leaders began to organize touring parties during the 1930s. These were to teach people to ski and keep them entertained in the evenings. The Ski Club currently operates a volunteer-leading service in around 17 resorts worldwide. In France, the club operates an &#x27;Instructor Led Guiding Service&#x27; due to legal issues with volunteer leaders.

===Ski Club Freshtracks===

The Ski Club has a long history of running ski holidays. Family holidays were first introduced in the 1970s, and later extended to include adult and over-50s holidays; and Peak Experience holidays. In 1996–97 the holiday&#x27;s programme expanded once more with the incorporation of the off-piste ski company ‘Freshtracks’. This increased the off-piste programme and included many holidays with qualified mountain guides. On holidays a rating system is employed to match skiers of similar abilities. This rating system is a continuation of that used during the early decades of the club&#x27;s existence.

===Ski Industry Involvement===

The Ski Club publishes an annual Consumer Research Report, advises the media on snow sports-related matters, and raises awareness of British athletes and events through its website and social media channels.

===The Pery Medal===

The Pery medal was instituted in 1929 by the Hon. E. C. Pery, later the Earl of Limerick, DSO and President of the Ski Club of Great Britain (1925–27) and was first awarded in 1930. Previous recipients of the medal include inspirational explorers, ski pioneers, Olympic and Paralympic champions, scientists and authors. Arnold Lunn was the first to be presented with the Pery medal in 1930 (he was also knighted for services to British skiing and Anglo-Swiss relations in 1952) and Sir Ranulph Fiennes, Frans Klammer, Konrad Bartelski, Alain Baxter and Hermann Maier feature among some of the well-known recipients.

===Skiclub.co.uk===

In 1995, the Ski Club launched the first ever winter sports website; www.skiclub.co.uk. Despite constantly increasing competition, it remains one of the leading skiing websites. Relaunched in 2000, the website was transformed from a ‘brochure’ website into a fully interactive site. Ski Club TV, the first dedicated snow sports internet TV channel, was launched in 2006.

===Ski Club Insurance===

The Ski Club of Great Britain has provided snow sports insurance for over 40 years. Insurance policies are designed by experts specifically for snow sports enthusiasts.

==Publications==

In 1905 the Ski Club began publishing the &quot;British Ski Year Book&quot;. This provided a record of changes in equipment, clothes, facilities, ski techniques, and holidays over the decades. In 1972 the &quot;British Ski Year Book&quot; became &quot;Ski Survey&quot;. In 1997 &quot;Ski Survey&quot; became &quot;Ski+board Magazine&quot; and was redesigned. &quot;Ski+board&quot; is published five times in the winter months, in September, October, December, February and March (this fifth issue is online only). There is also a summer version of the magazine, called &quot;Elevation&quot;.

<text>4Kids TV (often stylized as 4K!DSTV and formerly known as FoxBox from September 14, 2002 to January 15, 2005) was an American television programming block and Internet-based video on demand children&#x27;s network operated by 4Kids Entertainment. It originated as a weekly block on Saturday mornings on the Fox network, which was created out of a four-year agreement reached on January 22, 2002, between 4Kids Entertainment and Fox to lease the five-hour Saturday morning time slot occupied by the network&#x27;s existing children&#x27;s program block, Fox Kids. It was targeted at children aged 7–11. The 4Kids TV block was part of the Fox network schedule, although it was syndicated to other broadcast television stations in certain markets where a Fox affiliate declined to air it.

The block aired a preview special on September 1, 2002, and was formally launched on September 14, 2002, under the name FoxBox, a joint venture between News Corporation and 4Kids Entertainment, replacing Fox Kids, which the network announced it would discontinue as a result of the 2001 purchase of Fox Family Worldwide by The Walt Disney Company (which resulted in much of the content featured on the block moving to Disney&#x27;s networks and blocks). The block was rebranded as 4Kids TV on January 22, 2005. 4Kids Entertainment was fully responsible for the content of the block and collected all of the advertising revenue accrued from it. However, Fox&#x27;s standards and practices department still handled content approval and responsibility of editing the series to meet FCC broadcast standards.

The programming block aired on Saturday mornings in most areas of the United States, though some stations carried it on Sundays (often due to scheduling conflicts resulting from the block airing on stations affiliated with other minor networks that had their own older children&#x27;s anime program blocks which competed with FoxBox/4Kids TV, including the Kids&#x27; WB on The WB and later The CW, and for its first year, the Disney&#x27;s One Too block on UPN). On October 2, 2007, 4Kids Entertainment announced it would program a competing Saturday morning lineup for The CW, the new block, The CW4Kids (later renamed Toonzai, with the original name becoming a secondary brand), premiered on May 24, 2008, replacing the Kids&#x27; WB programming block, which had been carried over to The CW from one of its predecessors, The WB, when it launched on September 23, 2006. The block was renamed as Toonzai on August 14, 2010, and continued to air until it ended August 18, 2012, being replaced by Vortexx a week later and the block continued to air until it ended on September 27, 2014.

On November 10, 2008, 4Kids Entertainment announced that 4Kids TV would conclude at the end of the year due to intervening conflicts between Fox and 4Kids, as the latter company had not paid the network for the time lease for some time, while the network was unable to maintain the guaranteed 90% clearance for the block due to affiliate refusals and an inability to secure secondary affiliates to carry the programming in markets where the Fox station denied clearance for the block. 4Kids TV ended on December 27, 2008, ending Fox&#x27;s nearly two-decade commitment to children&#x27;s animation programming. Fox announced that the four-hour time period would no longer be used for children&#x27;s programming, owing that it was no longer viable due to the insurmountable competition from children&#x27;s cable channels (such as Nickelodeon, Cartoon Network, and Disney Channel). On January 3, 2009, the network gave two hours of the programming time that the 4Kids TV block occupied back to its affiliates, while the other two hours would be retained by the network for a paid programming block titled &quot;Weekend Marketplace&quot;, which replaced 4Kids TV on January 3, 2009. The 4KidsTV logo now only exists as the closing logo for 4Kids Entertainment for shows produced by the company distributed outside of the United States (particularly those made before the 2012 auction of most of 4Kids&#x27; assets to Saban Brands).

Fox would reverse course and indirectly resume airing children&#x27;s programming for the first time since 4Kids TV ended through an agreement announced on December 17, 2013, when it signed a deal with Steve Rotfeld Productions to launch &quot;Xploration Station&quot;, a two-hour block of live-action educational programs focused on the STEM fields, which debuted on September 13, 2014. As the block accounts for two of the three weekly hours of educational programming required by the Federal Communications Commission&#x27;s Children&#x27;s Television Act, the Fox affiliates that opted against airing 4Kids TV, Fox Kids, or &quot;Weekend Marketplace&quot; (including those owned by the network that were acquired through its 1996 merger with New World Communications and those acquired through that deal that were owned by Tribune Broadcasting, now Nexstar Media Group) elected to run &quot;Xploration Station&quot; as it is an E/I-compliant lineup syndicated primarily to the network&#x27;s affiliates, relieving them of taking on the full burden of purchasing educational programming aimed at children from the syndication market (although some Fox stations, including those owned by the Sinclair Broadcast Group—the vast majority of its stations had carried Fox&#x27;s previous children&#x27;s blocks, decided to decline the block anyway due to existing commitments to syndicated programs compliant with Children&#x27;s Television Act recommendations).

As of 2024, some former 4Kids TV shows (such as &quot;Chaotic&quot; (only in Spanish), &quot;Dinosaur King&quot;, &quot;G.I. Joe: Sigma 6&quot;, &quot;Sonic X&quot;, and various entries in the &quot;Yu-Gi-Oh!&quot; franchise) are made available to stream on the free ad-supported Tubi streaming service, which launched on April 1, 2014 and was later acquired by Fox Corporation on April 20, 2020. Outside of Tubi, &quot;Sonic X&quot; is also available on Amazon Prime Video, Hulu, Crackle, and Netflix as of December 2019, though the latter two services only carry seasons 1 and 2. In addition, &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles&quot; is made available to stream on both the free ad-supported Pluto TV and subscription-based Paramount+ streaming services owned by Paramount Global following that property&#x27;s 2009 acquisition by Nickelodeon, while the English-language version of &quot;Chaotic&quot; is on NBCUniversal&#x27;s Peacock streaming service.

4Kids launched an online video player on its website on September 8, 2007, and gradually added full-length episodes as well as additional video clips and online-exclusive content.

==Relationship with Fox and broadcast ambiguities==
The block had a somewhat infrequent relationship to the Fox network. The programming was produced for Fox and offered to the network&#x27;s owned-and-operated stations and affiliates first, so the Fox station in any given area had the right of first refusal. In the event that a Fox affiliate or in some cases, an O&amp;O of the network—opted not to carry 4Kids TV, the block then became available for the local broadcast rights to be acquired by another television station. In fact, it was due in part to these carriage ambiguities that 4Kids dissolved the block in 2008, as they had been promised clearance on at least 90% of Fox&#x27;s stations.

Most of Fox&#x27;s owned-and-operated stations opted to carry 4Kids TV (these were mainly stations that had been owned by the network since Fox launched in October 1986 or were Fox charter affiliates that Fox Television Stations had acquired since that point). However dating back to the existence of the Fox Kids block, the twelve stations that Fox acquired from New World Communications in 1996 (and had earlier affiliated with the network through a 1994 multi-station affiliation deal—which prior to then, had been affiliated with ABC, NBC, or CBS) generally did not air 4Kids TV. In some of the New World markets, 4Kids was not carried on any station. In a majority of these markets, an independent station carried the block; in others, it was carried by either a WB or UPN affiliate, and later a MyNetworkTV or CW affiliate. The only exception was in St. Louis, Missouri, where Fox O&amp;O (now affiliate) KTVI carried the block (although it aired 4Kids TV two hours earlier than the network&#x27;s recommended scheduling for the block, beginning at 5:00 a.m., due to the station&#x27;s Saturday morning newscast).

Some of 4Kids TV&#x27;s programming (such as &quot;Winx Club&quot;, &quot;The Adrenaline Project&quot;, &quot;Magical DoReMi&quot;, &quot;Stargate Infinity&quot;, reruns of &quot;Back to the Future: the Animated Series&quot;, and &quot;Cubix&quot;) met the criteria to be considered educational and informational under the requirements defined by the Children&#x27;s Television Act, and counted toward the three-hour-per-week mandatory educational children&#x27;s programming quotas outlined by the Federal Communications Commission.

===Markets where 4Kids TV did not run===
===Markets where 4Kids TV ran on a MyNetworkTV affiliate===
===Markets where 4Kids TV ran on a CW affiliate===
&quot;Note: These CW affiliates ran 4Kids TV on Sundays, due to their obligation to carry their primary network&#x27;s children&#x27;s lineup on Saturday as scheduled.&quot;

<text>The Reverend Henry Lucas (c. 1610 – July 1663) was an English clergyman and politician who sat in the House of Commons from 1640 to 1648.

==Life==

Lucas was a student at St John&#x27;s College, Cambridge. He became secretary to Henry Rich, 1st Earl of Holland. In April 1640, he was elected Member of Parliament for Cambridge University in the Short Parliament. He was re-elected MP for Cambridge University for the Long Parliament in November 1640. He was excluded from parliament in 1648 under Pride&#x27;s Purge.

Lucas died unmarried in Chancery Lane, London, and was buried in Temple Church on 22 July 1663. He is now mainly remembered as a benefactor.

Family legend has that he died on 7/6/1663, and he was 1 of 5 children of Edward and Mary (Covert) Lucas.

==Bequest==

In his will, Lucas founded the Henry Lucas Charity with a bequest of £7,000, to be spent on building an almshouse for poor old men and on employing a chaplain as its Master. The men were to be chosen from the poorest inhabitants of the Forest Division of Berkshire and the Bailiwick of Surrey in or near the Forest. The original Hospital was built by Lucas’s executors on 1.5 acres (6,000 m²) of land in Wokingham in 1666. On the death of the executors in 1675, the Drapers&#x27; Company of the City of London inherited the trusteeship of the Hospital. In 1923 an Act of Parliament dissolved the ancient Corporation, and provided for the admission of married couples, and for the employment of a Matron.

By 1999, the original building was no longer suitable for use as a modern almshouse. The original Hospital was sold and in July 2002 the Henry Lucas Charity was merged with the Whiteley Homes Trust. Sixteen double cottages were built in Whiteley Village near Walton-on-Thames in Surrey to provide accommodation for more than twice as many people as was possible in the Hospital, and are known as &quot;The Henry Lucas Cottages&quot;.

The Drapers used a coat of arms to commemorate Lucas on the Henry Lucas Cottages at Whiteley Village, copying that on Lucas Hospital. This can be described as: &quot;Quarterly with a crescent for difference on the fess point: 1 and 4, Argent, a fesse between six annulets gules; 2 and 3, Gules, on a bend argent, seven billets one two one two and one palewise of the bend sable&quot;, a quartering of the Lucas and Morieux families&#x27; coats of arms.

Lucas also bequeathed his collection of 4,000 books (including Galileo&#x27;s &quot;Dialogo&quot; of 1632) to the University Library at Cambridge, along with enough land to give an income of £100 a year, which was to be used to fund a professorship of &quot;mathematick&quot;, now the Lucasian Professorship of Mathematics.
