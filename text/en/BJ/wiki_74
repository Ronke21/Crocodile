<text>Rocannon&#x27;s World is a science fiction novel by American writer Ursula K. Le Guin, her literary debut. Published in 1966, it appeared as an Ace Double, with an opening entitled &quot;Semley&#x27;s Necklace&quot; that first appeared as the stand-alone story, &quot;The Dowry of Angyar&quot;, in &quot;Amazing Stories&quot; in September 1964. The novel is one of several of Le Guin&#x27;s works taking place in the same universe and with relationships of characters and history, works that have been termed the Hainish Cycle (a term rejected by the author herself). Its story presents many elements of heroic fantasy. 

The novel&#x27;s protagonist, &quot;League of All Worlds&quot; ethnographer Gaveral Rocannon, returns to planet Fomalhaut II after its quarantine to lead a further advanced survey of its &quot;higher intelligence life forms&quot; (hilfs). As the novel opens, a rebel faction of the League violently attacks his ship, taking the lives of all of his colleagues—and, in presaging invasion, endangers the future of the planet&#x27;s sentient species. Rocannon engages with these, including the tall, feudal, aristocratic Angyar, and two shorter likewise intelligent species, the troglodyte technologists and makers, the Gdemiar, and the a-technological, colonially telepathic Fiia, to battle both harsh planetary elements and other sentients, to accomplish a quest—to beckon the distant League to thwart the invasion. 

In developing the story, Le Guin introduces the term &quot;ansible&quot; as a key technology (and plot element), one that allows instantaneous communication across vast distances, a term that went on to much wider used in science fiction, including by novelist Orson Scott Card and others.

== Plot summary ==

=== Prologue: The Necklace===

The novel opens with a prologue occurring many years prior to its main action, entitled &quot;The Necklace&quot; (from an earlier published stand-alone story, &quot;The Dowry of Angyar&quot;). A young woman, Semley, the wife of an aristocrat of the Angyar people, decries the fate of husband and clan for its lack of wealth, a consequence of constraint against gain by spoils by war, imposed on them by extraterrestrial starlords that had visited. She recalls a precious necklace, a family heirloom of great value, lost to another of the sentient races of the planet, and departs covertly by flight on a &quot;windsteed&quot;—a large, winged, domesticated, cat-like species—to set out to reclaim her legacy, for the sake of her lord&#x27;s and family&#x27;s future.

Semley engages a troglodyte species of sentients, the Gdemiar, by whom she understands the heirloom to have been taken, descending with them into their subterranean dwelling. Despite that species having been favoured by the starlords—they were selected to serve as intermediaries between the starlords and planet sentients, and given means to engage the starlords—the Gdemiar show deference to the stately Angyar Lady, and agree to take Semley to those holding her heirloom. As she proceeds, it becomes clear that the means by which the Gdemiar engage the starlords takes the form of an automated spacecraft that the starlords—visiting scientists from the more advanced, interstellar &quot;League of All Worlds&quot;—have placed at the disposal of the Gdemiar, who they judged technologically most capable of the planet&#x27;s sentients.

Hence, Semley takes a space voyage from the unnamed, technologically primitive planet, her destination an off-planet museum of collected ethnographic artifacts gathered by the League surveyors, Gaverel Rocannon and others. The survey scientists she engages are enthralled to meet this further, beautiful sentient, and gladly agree to return the artifact heirloom to her, and then to facilitate her return to Angyar. Unfortunately, the time dilation associated with her travel means that while of short duration for Semley, 16 years have passed on her planet, and with her lord and family. She returns with her prize, and is met by an old woman that she does not recognise, but who is a peer and confidante from her life before departure. She learns that her lord and husband has perished in an intervening battle in her absence, and that the young daughter she had left is now a grown woman.

=== The Starlord, The Wanderer, and Epilogue ===

The novel then follows Gaverel Rocannon, one of the ethnologists who met Semley at the museum. Years after meeting Semley, Rocannon embarks on an ethnological mission to her planet, Fomalhaut II. It was through Rocannon&#x27;s efforts that the planet had been placed under an &#x27;exploration embargo&#x27; in order to protect the native cultures. Unbeknown to him and his colleagues, the planet hosts a base of an enemy of the League of All Worlds: a young world named Faraday, which embarked on a career of interstellar war and conquest, and which chose this &quot;primitive&quot; world as the location of a secret base. After this enemy destroys his ship and his companions, Rocannon sets out to find their base so that he can alert the League of their presence with the enemy&#x27;s ansible. He must rely on alliances with the sentient species of the planet, and he must use other means of travel, including walking, boating, and riding on the back of windsteeds, the large, winged cat-like domesticated carnivores of the Angyar.

His long and dangerous quest, undertaken with loyal Angyar and other companions, take them through many lands, where they encounter various other cultures and species of the planet and faces numerous threats and obstacles that are unrelated to the enemy he intends to confront. He eventually recognises, in addition to his human-like companions, the Liuar of Angyar, four further species that bring to five the &quot;hilfs&quot; earlier identified: the dwarf-like Gdemiar, the elf-like Fiia, the nightmarish Winged Ones, and the rodent-like Kiemhrir. Increasingly, as the plot progresses, Rocannon&#x27;s experiences impact his personality, making him more attuned to the planet&#x27;s culture than with his previous interstellar sophisticate role. Before the final encounter, Rocannon has an intense encounter with an entity in a mountainside cave. Here, in exchange for &quot;giving himself to the planet&quot;, he receives the gift of &quot;mindspeech&quot;, a form of telepathy more common to the Gdemiar.

Finally, after traveling halfway across the globe and suffering much loss and bereavement, the party reaches the enemy&#x27;s stronghold, set in a land unknown to Rocannon and the Angyar, and occupied by distant relatives of the Angyar. Rocannon reverts from the effective role of a Bronze Age hero, into which he had been increasingly pushed during most of the book, and returns to his role as the resourceful operative of an interstellar civilization. He uses his mindspeech abilities to formulate a plan and successfully infiltrate the enemy base, entering one of the faster-than-light (FTL) ships. This he uses to send a communication, using its ansible, to alert his command, at the nearest base of the League of All Worlds, relaying to them the nature and layout of the base, and its planetary location.

Rocannon escapes via windsteed, although unsure until the last moment that his message has been received, and that he can and has suceeded in putting enough distance between himself and the base to survive. Shortly thereafter, Rocannon experiences the flash of light indicative that the base has been destroyed—the League has responded to his message with an unmanned Faster-Than-Light (FTL) ship, to destroy the enemy installation. Because of his new telepathic ability, Rocannon feels the shock of the deaths of a thousand men, occurring in that moment.

After the completion of his quest, Rocannon retires with the Angyar of the south continent, surrounded by sympathetic people, including the woman he would marry. When rescuers from the League arrive nine years later, they find that he has died. He could not know that as a result of his saving communication, the planet has been named after him.

== Literary significance and criticism ==

&quot;Rocannon&#x27;s World&quot; along with its two sequels combine emerging British New Wave science fiction sentiments with established American genre imagery and Le Guin&#x27;s signature anthropological interests into a tale of loss, companionship, isolation, redemption and love.

Science fiction scholar Andy Sawyer points out that &quot;Rocannon&#x27;s World,&quot; along with &quot;Planet of Exile&quot; and &quot;City of Illusions&quot; exhibits Le Guin&#x27;s struggle as an emerging writer to arrive at a plausible, uniquely memorable and straightforward locale for her stories. The tropes in &quot;Rocannon&#x27;s World&quot; adhere closely to those of high fantasy, with Clayfolk resembling Dwarves and the Fiia resembling Elves, especially in their dialogue. Additionally, &quot;Rocannon&#x27;s World&quot; is noted to be a lightly disguised fantasy in which the legendary characters are easily interpreted by the readers as characters from the real world&#x27;s future.

Polish literature scholar discussed the work in the context of the concepts of otherness and anthropocentrism.

Robert Silverberg described the novel as &quot;superior space opera, good vivid fun ... short, briskly told, inventive and literate.&quot;

==Publication history==
&quot;Rocannon&#x27;s World&quot; was initially published with no introduction, but Le Guin wrote an introduction for Harper &amp; Row&#x27;s 1977 hardcover edition. &quot;Rocannon&#x27;s World&quot; was also issued in a 1978 book club omnibus along with &quot;Planet of Exile&quot; and &quot;City of Illusions&quot; in a volume called &quot;Three Hainish Novels&quot; and in a 1996 volume with the same novels titled &quot;Worlds of Exile and Illusion.&quot;

<text>Television New Zealand (), more commonly referred to as TVNZ, is a television network that is broadcast throughout New Zealand and parts of the Pacific region. All of its currently-operating channels are free-to-air and commercially funded.

TVNZ was established in February 1980 following the merger of the two government-owned television networks, Television One (now TVNZ 1) and South Pacific Television (now TVNZ 2), under a single administration. It was the sole television broadcaster in New Zealand until November 1989 when private channel TV3 (now Three) was launched.

TVNZ operates playout services from its Auckland studio via Kordia&#x27;s fibre and microwave network for TVNZ 1, TVNZ 2 and TVNZ Duke, with new media video services via the American-owned Brightcove which is streamed on the Akamai RTMP/HLS DNS based caching network. Its former channels include TVNZ Kidzone (closed 30 April 2016), TVNZ Heartland (closed 31 May 2015), TVNZ U (closed August 2013), TVNZ 7 (closed June 2012), TVNZ 6 (closed 2011), and TVNZ Sport Extra (closed 2009).

TVNZ is state-owned but commercially funded through advertising. There has been reoccurring debate about TVNZ&#x27;s role and whether it should be treated as a public-service broadcaster or a fully commercial network.

==History==

===Formation===
TVNZ was created in February 1980, through the merger of Television One and South Pacific Television (which was renamed TV2). Until January 1989, it was paired with Radio New Zealand as the Broadcasting Corporation of New Zealand (BCNZ).

The broadcaster was initially based in Television One&#x27;s former headquarters at the Avalon television centre in Lower Hutt, with TV One broadcasting out of Avalon and TV2 broadcasting out of Auckland. However over the course of the 1980s, operations were gradually moved to Auckland. In 1989, TVNZ moved to a new television centre in central Auckland.

In preparation for the launch of TV3, TVNZ became a profit-oriented state-owned enterprise in 1988. 

Broadcasting in New Zealand was deregulated in 1989. Private broadcasters were allowed to operate in competition to TVNZ. The Broadcasting Act 1989 also established the organisation now called NZ on Air which funds public broadcasting and independent media production in New Zealand.

In 1990, TVNZ competed with TV3 with an advertising campaign backed by &quot;expensive imported programmes&quot; and local sports coverage. 

===Role as public broadcaster===

The Labour-led government under Helen Clark from 1999 to 2008 pursued a programme of public broadcasting reforms. New Zealand&#x27;s wide-ranging adoption of neoliberal policies in the mid-1980s and 1990s had large sections of the state sector privatised. As a state owned enterprise, TVNZ enjoyed enormous commercial success under CEO Julian Mounter (sustaining two-thirds of the overall audience share) and paid the Crown substantial dividends (over $250 million between 1989 and 1999). However, the commercial success had been achieved through an unabashed pursuit of ratings through populist and tabloid content, and prior to the 1999 election the National-led government was evidently positioning TVNZ for commercialisation Labour-led administrations since 1999 explicitly recognised the market failures of a wholly commercial broadcasting sector (e.g. saturation-level advertising, low levels of local content, heavy reliance on cheap imports and a disregard for quality genres and in-depth news and current affairs) and re-emphasised television&#x27;s cultural and democratic functions in their policy thinking.

The Clark government&#x27;s highest profile broadcasting reform to date was the restructuring of TVNZ as a Crown entity in 2003. This introduced a dual remit whereby the broadcaster had to maintain its commercial performance (continuing dividend payments to the Crown) while simultaneously implementing a new public service Charter.

The TVNZ Charter would require the negotiation and reconciliation of potentially contradictory commercial and public service imperatives. The final version of the TVNZ Charter included a range of public service objectives and expectations.

However, this dual remit precluded any transformation of TVNZ into fully-fledged public service broadcaster, and TVNZ&#x27;s efforts to balance its pursuit of commercial performance and Charter objectives were soon being criticised. Despite some investment in local content, including new documentaries and discussion programmes, the content on TV One and TV2 remained similar to the pre-charter schedules, with a continuing high proportion of light entertainment and reality-TV shows.

TVNZ continues to pay dividends to the Crown. However, from 2006 until 2009 TVNZ received $15.11 million each year from Government to assist it with fulfilling Charter obligations. There was much debate about the initial secrecy surrounding funding allocations and the programmes supported. The allocation of $5 million toward coverage of the 2008 Olympics, the rights for which are secured by a competitive tender between broadcasters, was possibly the most controversial. In 2009 the Government gave control of that funding to funding agency NZ On Air. NZ On Air announced the creation of the contestable &quot;Platinum Fund&quot; in April 2009, setting aside the $15.11 million for high quality drama, documentary and other programme types. Following the election of a National Party-led government under John Key in 2008, the Charter was abolished in favour of a return to the 1990s model of a full commercial broadcaster.

There is much debate on the future of TVNZ, which focuses on the nature of public service broadcasting and its commercial role. An example was in a memo called &quot;A More Public Broadcaster&quot; written by outgoing Chief Executive Ian Fraser to the board of TVNZ in October 2005, was obtained and released by Green MP Sue Kedgley. The memo outlined three (four) options.

These were:
* TV One as a fully non-commercial network, like ABC in Australia, charged with delivering Charter values, and possibly merging with Radio New Zealand and Māori Television
* TV One a semi-commercial broadcaster with no more than six minutes of advertisements an hour like SBS in Australia
* TV One and TV2 remaining unchanged, but two new public service channels being broadcast via digital television.
* TV One and TV2 are now fully commercial with 15 – 20 minutes of ads per hour, plus ads overplayed over programmes.

On 15 February 2006, a group of 31 prominent New Zealanders signed an open letter, published as a full-page newspaper advertisement, calling for better quality programmes and less advertising on TVNZ. These included mountaineer Sir Edmund Hillary, and former governors-general Sir Michael Hardie Boys and Dame Catherine Tizard. However, they were accused of being out of touch and nostalgic for local programmes from the 1970s and 1980s, when New Zealand had only one or two TV channels. While the Broadcasting Minister, Steve Maharey, ruled out turning TVNZ into an entirely non-commercial broadcaster, on 25 February 2006, he stated that the Labour Government was &quot;pretty much settled&quot; on the introduction of two new free-to-air, non-commercial channels available via digital television. One screening high-end international documentaries, re-runs of &quot;One News&quot; and minority programmes with a high local content, and another, primarily for children, screening serious drama and arts at night. These channels would eventually become known as TVNZ 7 and TVNZ 6 respectively.

===Digital era===
In early 2006, TVNZ purchased Harmonic branded H.262 encoding equipment for the upcoming Freeview DTH service, which is an Electra 1000 on-the-fly video re-encoder.

On 14 November 2006, TVNZ announced plans to launch two commercial-free digital channels. The first, with the working title TVNZ News 24, would feature news, sport and special interest content, and be launched in late 2007. This would be followed by a channel featuring children&#x27;s, families&#x27;, arts and documentary programming, with the working title of TVNZ Home, in early 2008. While 80 per cent of the programming would be local content, 70 per cent of this would consist of repeats from TVNZ&#x27;s existing channels or its archive.

In April 2008, TVNZ made another purchase of more H.264 encoding equipment for the upcoming Freeview HD DTT service, which are the Electra 7000 for HD and Electra 5400 for SD on-the-fly video re-encoders.

The proposal was criticised by TV3, which accused the Government of &quot;bailing out&quot; TVNZ and argued that the money would be better spent on new programming. Although Sue Kedgely welcomed the decision to make the channels (including children&#x27;s programming) commercial-free, she accused the Government of tight-fistedness.

In late 2011, TVNZ and its pay-TV rival Sky Network Television announced the joint venture &quot;Igloo&quot;, which is to provide a low-cost pay-TV service for households not currently covered by Freeview or Sky. &quot;Igloo&quot; closed in 2017.

In mid 2013, TVNZ changed its on-screen branding to a more flat, modern look. TVNZ went fully digital in December 2013, with the accompanying shutdown of the analogue transmitters to free up spectrum for telecommunications use.

In January 2017 TVNZ launched their &#x27;New Blood Web Series Competition&#x27; supported by NZ On Air. The competition is calling for aspiring content creators to submit a web series pilot episode. The winner will receive $100,000 to make a complete web series, which will launch through TVNZ&#x27;s online channels.

===Conflicts===
In addition to debates over whether TVNZ should be a public broadcaster or a commercial one, there have been other controversies.

In 1996, the defamation case &quot;Television New Zealand Ltd v Quinn&quot; was decided at the Court of Appeal of New Zealand.

For 3 weeks in January–February 1999, John Hawkesby became a weekday newsreader for One News, replacing Richard Long (who moved to presenting weekend bulletins alongside Liz Gunn). The change was short-lived, and Hawkesby received a $5.2m payout.

In 2000, the Broadcasting Standards Authority ruled against TVNZ over inaccuracies in a news story about the drug Lyprinol (an extract from the New Zealand green-lipped mussel), which was erroneously touted as a cure for cancer.

In 2004 current affairs veteran of 15 years Paul Holmes sparked a public outcry after he referred to United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan as a &quot;cheeky darkie&quot; on his radio show on Newstalk ZB and subsequently chose not to renew his contract at TVNZ.

Also in 2004 there was the public outcry over newsreader Judy Bailey&#x27;s $800,000 salary package, negotiated with head of news and current affairs at TVNZ Bill Ralston, she finished her final 12-month contract the following year after 34 years working at the broadcaster.

In late 2010, TVNZ garnered criticism over various comments made by &quot;Breakfast&quot; host Paul Henry. Henry had referred to Delhi Commonwealth Games organiser Sheila Dikshit as &quot;the dip shit woman&quot; and &quot;Dick Shit&quot;, going on to state that &quot;it&#x27;s so appropriate, because she&#x27;s Indian, so she&#x27;d be dick-in-shit wouldn&#x27;t she, do you know what I mean? Walking along the street... she&#x27;s just so funny, isn&#x27;t she?&quot; Henry also questioned whether the Governor-General of New Zealand Anand Satyanand was &quot;even a New Zealander&quot;, going on to ask, &quot;Are you going to choose a New Zealander who looks and sounds like a New Zealander this time ... are we going to go for someone who is more like a New Zealander this time?&quot; Following widespread public complaints and official criticism, Henry was suspended from TVNZ for 2 weeks without pay, eventually resigning from the broadcaster. Henry&#x27;s resignation polarised the New Zealand public, with supporters claiming he was a victim of political correctness, and critics accusing him of pandering to the lowest common denominator.

===Proposed merger===
Renewing previous debate about the role of TVNZ as a commercial broadcaster, the Sixth Labour Government announced a proposal to disestablish TVNZ and Radio New Zealand (RNZ) and establish a single public media entity. The television and radio broadcaster would have a public-service role to provide content on a variety of platforms, &quot;some of which may be advertising free&quot;. By mid-March 2021, the merger proposal was still in its early stages.

In late December 2021, former National Party Member of Parliament Simon Power was appointed as the chief executive of TVNZ. Power had recently stepped down as acting chief of Westpac Bank when the bank appointed Catherine McGrath as chief executive in November 2021. Power assumed the position in March 2022, on the 4th April 2023 Power Resigned effective from the 30th June 2023 with Brent McAnulty taking over as acting CEO.

In mid-June 2022, Broadcasting Minister Willie Jackson introduced draft legislation to TVNZ and fellow public broadcaster Radio New Zealand into a new non-profit autonomous Crown entity called Aotearoa New Zealand Public Media (ANZPM), commencing 1 March 2023. Under the proposed legislation, both TVNZ and RNZ would become subsidiaries of the ANZPM, which would be supported by both government and commercial funding. The new organisation would also be headed by a board and be governed by a media charter outlining its goals and responsibilities including editorial independence. The Government has also allocated NZ$370m over four years in operating expenditure and $306m in capital funding from the 2022 New Zealand budget for funding the ANZPM.

On 8 February 2023, Prime Minister Chris Hipkins announced that the merger of TVNZ and RNZ into ANZPM would be scrapped due to a shift in government priorities towards &quot;cost of living issues.&quot; He confirmed that RNZ and NZ On Air would receive additional government funding. Prior to the public media entity&#x27;s cancellation, the two public broadcasters had spent a total of NZ$1,023,701 on ANZPM; with TVNZ spending NZ$592,424 in the period between 1 March and 31 October 2022.

=== 2023–present ===
In February 2024 Jodi O&#x27;Donnell became CEO of TVNZ. 

In early March 2024, due to financial difficulties from competing large Internet companies such as Netflix and YouTube and a decline in advertisement revenue, the state-owned broadcaster proposed ending television programmes &quot;Fair Go&quot; and &quot;Sunday&quot; along with 1News&#x27; midday and late night news segments. In addition, TVNZ has proposed 68 job cuts (roughly 9 percent of its staff). In response to the proposed cuts and layoffs, the Better Public Media Trust has proposed funding TVNZ through a $60 annual levy on individuals or alternatively a digital services levy.

On 13 March 2024, TVNZ employees affiliated with the E tū union objected to TVNZ&#x27;s proposal to slash almost 70 jobs. E tū negotiations specialist Michael Wood said that E tū members were unhappy with the proposed restructure and &quot;shoddy&quot; consultation process. In early May 2024, E Tū filed a case against TVNZ with the Employment Relations Authority (ERA), arguing that the broadcaster failed to follow the consultation requirements of its collective agreement with its members. On 6 May, TVNZ executives, staff members, and Wood submitted evidence during an investigative meeting at ERA&#x27;s Auckland office. During the meeting, a &quot;Fair Go&quot; employee said that the company had not raised the issues of job cuts and progamme cancellations during staff meetings on TVNZ&#x27;s future direction. On 10 May, ERA ordered TVNZ to enter into mediation with the E tū union over THE staff redundancies caused by its programming cutbacks. TVNZ issued a statement voicing disappointment with ERA&#x27;s decision and that &quot;we will now take the time to consider the decision and our next steps.&quot; On 31 May, Employment Court Chief Judge Christina Inglis dismissed TVNZ&#x27;s appeal against the Employment Relations Authority&#x27;s ruling and ruled that TVNZ had to enter into collective bargaining with its employees.

On 7 October 2024, TVNZ&#x27;s management proposed several measures to find NZ$30 million in cost-savings including closing down the 1News website by February 2025, investing more in its TVNZ+ streaming service and reorienting its youth-oriented platform Re:News to focus on video storytelling. On 29 October, TVNZ abandoned plans to shut down its 1News website but proposed expanding the news content of TVNZ+. On 7 November 2024, TVNZ proposed cutting 90 roles and creating 41 new roles in order to save NZ$30 million. This includes cutting several roles on its &quot;Breakfast&quot; and &quot;Seven Sharp&quot; current affairs shows.

==Governance==
, the Media and Journalism Research Center evaluated TVNZ to be &quot;Independent State Managed/Owned Media&quot; under its State Media Matrix.

===Board of directors===
The TVNZ Board is the governing board of Television New Zealand. It is appointed by the Minister of Broadcasting and Media, who was at the time Willie Jackson. , the directors are: the chairperson Dame Therese Walsh (Wellington), deputy chairperson Andy Coupe (Hamilton), Abby Foote (Christchurch), Cameron Harland (Lower Hutt), Toko Kapea (Wellington), Kevin Malloy (Auckland), Julia Raue (Auckland) and Susan Turner (Auckland). Former board members include Roger MacDonnell (2010-2016).

===Charter===

The Fifth Labour Government introduced a &quot;TVNZ Charter&quot; in 2002. This was a list of objectives for TVNZ which specified it must broadcast a wide variety of New Zealand-made content; the broadcaster was given public responsibility to provide news, drama, documentaries and &quot;promote understanding of the diversity of cultures&quot;. In 2008 the Government announced that the broadcaster was to become &quot;more public-service&quot; like. TVNZ responded by launching two commercial free channels; TVNZ 6 and TVNZ 7. By 2011 Prime Minister John Key announced the closure of these channels. 6 in 2011, and 7 in mid-2012, with much of their content put into TVNZ Heartland and TVNZ Kidzone24 which are only available behind a Sky TV paywall. The Fifth National Government abolished the Charter in 2011. Political opponents accused the Government of reducing TVNZ&#x27;s commitments as a public broadcaster.

== Channels ==
=== TVNZ 1 ===
TVNZ 1 is TVNZ&#x27;s flagship channel. Launched on 1 June 1960, it has a broad range of programming, including news, sport, food, drama, and comedy. Its news service is &quot;1News&quot; and its sports division is &quot;1 Sport&quot;.

The channel, once the traditional home of television sport, has since lost the rights to most of the world&#x27;s main sporting events, including the Olympics, and All Blacks test matches to pay television competitor Sky. TVNZ&#x27;s outside broadcasting division, Moving Pictures was established in 1962. It provided the production facilities for such events with 8 outside broadcast trucks across the country. This wound up in the mid 2000s after then-Australian owned outside broadcaster Onsite Broadcasting started to expand and took the OB contract off Moving Pictures for the filming of major sports for Sky TV. OSB was then owned by Sky before it was sold to American OB provider NEP. TVNZ 1 also broadcasts rural focused programmes such as &quot;Country Calendar&quot; and &quot;Rural Delivery&quot;, Māori community presentations such as &quot;Waka Huia&quot;, &quot;Marae Investigates&quot; and &quot;Te Karere&quot;, a daily Māori language news bulletin, and shows for minorities, such as &quot;Attitude&quot;, &quot;Neighbourhood&quot;, &quot;A Taste of Home&quot; and &quot;Tagata Pasifika&quot;. Elsewhere TVNZ 1 specialises in food shows, including the locally produced &quot;MasterChef&quot;, and international shows, mostly from the BBC and Network Ten Australia.

=== TVNZ 2 ===

TVNZ 2 targets a younger audience than TVNZ 1. Launched on 30 June 1975, its line up consists of dramas, sitcoms, comedies, children&#x27;s programming, and reality shows, most of which are produced in New Zealand or imported from the United States.

Locally produced content includes &quot;Shortland Street&quot;, &quot;Motorway Patrol&quot; and &quot;What Now&quot;, and international shows (which are predominantly American) include &quot;The Big Bang Theory&quot;, &quot;The Simpsons&quot; and &quot;The Walking Dead&quot;. TVNZ 2 is sold by TVNZ as the &quot;home of entertainment&quot;.

===TVNZ Duke===
TVNZ Duke was launched on 20 March 2016. It initially broadcast between the hours of 6pm and midnight, although it occasionally screened live sport events outside of these hours. On average, the channel broadcasts from 10:30 am until late on weekdays, and from 7 am until late on weekends. It screens programming for a male audience with comedy, drama and factual series such as &quot;Two and a Half Men&quot;, &quot;Family Guy&quot;, &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, &quot;Everybody Hates Chris&quot; and &quot;River Monsters&quot;. It also screens a number of sporting events such as the Men&#x27;s and Women&#x27;s Hockey Pro Leagues and the Dream11 Super Smash domestic cricket tournament.

===Timeshift channels===
TVNZ broadcasts timeshift channels of its three television channels. These broadcast the Auckland feed, delayed by one hour. TVNZ 1+1 was launched on 1 July 2012, replacing TVNZ 7. TVNZ 2+1 was launched on 1 September 2013, replacing TVNZ U. TVNZ Duke+1 was launched on 17 November 2020.

==Other services==
Internationally, TVNZ has helped provide television services in Pacific Island nations such as the Cook Islands, Fiji, and the Solomon Islands. While TVNZ provides much of the programming, scheduling and continuity are done locally.

Because of its history TVNZ has inherited and developed its own services in the production and broadcasting services area. These include The New Zealand Television Archive, production facilities, television school.

===TVNZ Archive===

The TVNZ Archive collection contains over 600,000 hours of television spanning almost 55 years of New Zealand&#x27;s public television history. It includes iconic New Zealand content such as documentaries, dramas, sports programmes and every TVNZ news broadcast from December 1986 to 2014. In a 2014 briefing to Minister Craig Foss, the Ministry for Culture and Heritage noted that the long-term preservation of the TVNZ Archive collection did not align with broadcaster&#x27;s business needs and that transferring the collection to the Crown would allow for the proper preservation of the collection. Both the Ministry and TVNZ explicitly wanted to ensure the archive was preserved and that it was made increasingly available for re-use through online streaming and other means. On 1 August 2014 guardianship of the archive collection was transferred to the Crown. Budget 2014 included $24.4 million to facilitate the transfer and ongoing management of the archive. Of that, $11.32 million was for the purchase of the TVNZ Archive facility at Avalon – including land, building, fixtures, fittings and plant. $5.066 million was for the depreciation and capital charge of the facility, and $8 million (spread over four years) was for the ongoing management of the archive. The building and land were transferred to the Department of Internal Affairs and the Ministry for Culture and Heritage took over guardianship of the collection. The Ministry appointed Ngā Taonga Sound &amp; Vision as the initial archive manager.

===TVNZ+===
TVNZ+ is Television New Zealand&#x27;s on-demand streaming platform, TVNZ OnDemand was launched 20 March 2007, and is available on PlayStation 3 and PlayStation 4 via the TVNZ app on PlayStation Network for New Zealanders. It is also available on FreeviewPlus, iOS, Android, Xbox One and Windows 10. The content uses geotargeting for New Zealand only connections via a US-based Brightcove media company using the Akamai RTMP network, with some local content being made available to an international audience via their YouTube channel. At the end of 2012, the contract with Brightcove was expanded to include streaming to iOS devices via the Akamai HLS network. From 2012, TVNZ OnDemand began uploading episodes of select shows prior to their airing on TVNZ channels and usually within a day of their original overseas airings (although sometimes this was weeks or months after their international airing). In September 2014, it was announced that episodes of seventeen shows would be uploaded within a day of their airings in the US, coinciding with the 2014–2015 season. One of the shows, &quot;Manhattan Love Story&quot; was cancelled by the US network ABC, but episodes continued to be uploaded to TVNZ OnDemand in line with their intended US airings, making TVNZ the de facto original broadcaster of the series. On 1 May 2016 (01.06 am), when TVNZ Kidzone (channel version) closed it is now on TVNZ OnDemand with lot of the shows to watch (it is still use the former channel programs). On June 13 the service rebranded to TVNZ+ after on Friday 10 TVNZ sent an email out to staff saying &quot;exciting upgrade coming for TVNZ OnDemand.&quot;

=== Teletext ===

TVNZ began a teletext service in 1984 originally with the intention to help New Zealand&#x27;s deaf community get improved access to news and information. A captioning service was available for certain television shows and could be accessed by browsing to page 801. The TVNZ Teletext service could be received on all TVNZ channels and the TVNZ service could be received on TV3 including captioning of some TV3 shows. Trackside also operated a Teletext service called TAB Text which only displayed the racing pages of Teletext.

A Teletext capable television was usually required to receive Teletext. With the arrival of digital television services such as Freeview, Teletext could be received through a Freeview decoder. In this case captions were normally accessed by subtitle button on a Freeview remote.

In December 2012, TVNZ announced the closure of their Teletext service from 3 April 2013. The captioning service would however continue to be available. TVNZ cited the reasons for the closure due to a decline in use particularly since most services are now available from the TVNZ website or other websites.
=== TiVo ===
On 26 March 2009 TVNZ announced that it had acquired a 33% stake in Hybrid Television Services (67% owned by Australia&#x27;s Seven Media Group). Hybrid TV is the exclusive licensee of TiVo products in Australia and New Zealand. On the same day it was announced that TiVo would be arriving in New Zealand by Christmas 2009 (Hybrid launched it in Australia in July 2008). The TiVo service was discontinued on 31 October 2017.

=== Discontinued services ===
Between 1995 and 1997, TVNZ operated a network of regional TV stations under the &#x27;Horizon Pacific&#x27; name and through a subsidiary called Horizon Pacific Television. Its broadcast content included BBC World and NZ documentary programming. The network consisted of newly formed stations ATV in Auckland, Coast to Coast in Hamilton, Capital Television in Wellington and Southern Television in Dunedin. TVNZ subsequently also purchased CTV, based in Christchurch. CTV continues to broadcast, but is no longer owned by TVNZ.
Horizon Pacific was replaced by a local &#x27;free to air&#x27; version of the music video channel MTV, based on MTV&#x27;s UK service and local programming, although the channel was dropped in 1998. Prior to MTV&#x27;s demise, TVNZ had bought the channel&#x27;s competitor, &quot;Max TV&quot;.

TVNZ also operated a satellite services division organising and downlink facilities and across the globe, but this service was wound down in 2005.

TVNZ operated TVNZ 6 from 2007 to 2011. TVNZ 6 was a digital-only, commercial-free television channel. It was available in 60.3% of New Zealand homes on the Freeview and Sky Television Digital platforms. TVNZ 6 was on air daily from 6 am to midnight.

TVNZ 7 was launched in March 2008 and was a commercial-free news and information channel. It was available via the Freeview and Sky platforms. The New Zealand Government, under Prime Minister John Key and Broadcasting Minister Jonathan Coleman decided to discontinue funding for TVNZ 7. The final broadcast ended at midnight on 30 June 2012. TVNZ 7 was replaced with time shift channel TV One Plus 1 (now TVNZ 1 +1).

TVNZ launched U on 13 March 2011. U was a 24-hour youth orientated channel available via both Freeview and Sky. TVNZ U was launched to fill the gap when TVNZ 6 closed in 2011. TVNZ U specialised in musical tastes, reality, gaming, fashion and informative youth orientated documentaries.

On 29 July 2013, TVNZ announced that the channel would be closed on 31 August 2013 and be replaced by a time shift channel, TV2+1 (now TVNZ 2 +1).

TVNZ Heartland was a pay-TV channel that launched on the Sky Television platform on 1 June 2010. It was TVNZ&#x27;s first channel available exclusively on a pay-TV platform and featured 100% New Zealand made programming, mostly sourced from the TVNZ archives. The channel closed in May 2015.

TVNZ ceased delivering its Pacific Service in October 2015. The service was taken over by Pacific Cooperation Broadcasting Limited, who expanded the service in February 2016 as Pasifika TV. The service became a collaboration of all major New Zealand broadcasters, as opposed to just TVNZ. The transition of the service meant that it was now funded by Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade, and the objectives were broadened beyond supplying content, to focus on strengthening partnerships in the Pacific by building capacity and capabilities amongst the respective Pacific free to air broadcasters.

== Transmission network ==

=== High Definition ===
TVNZ has offered HD broadcasts since July/August 2008, when the 2008 Summer Olympics were broadcast in High Definition. The service is offered on the Freeview|HD platform, using DVB-T transmission. Only TV One and TV2 are offered in HD, and the majority of programming is still up-converted from Standard Definition. From 1 July 2009 the HD versions of TV One and TV2 became available to Sky TV subscribers who have the MySky HDi decoders. Content on the HD versions of TV One and 2 are the same as the Standard Definition versions however when watching certain shows that broadcast in High Definition the HD logo is displayed next to the channel logo, this logo is not seen when watching the same show on the Standard Definition versions of TV1 and 2.

TVNZ has adopted 1080i as their HD broadcast format.

=== Kordia, formerly BCL, TVNZ&#x27;s transmission partner ===
TVNZ&#x27;s transmission network is operated by Kordia, formerly a subsidiary of TVNZ known as &quot;Broadcast Communications Limited&quot; until 2006. The company owns and operates the terrestrial transmission network used for broadcast of all major terrestrial television networks in New Zealand, including Discovery New Zealand. and Sky Open – TVNZ&#x27;s major competitors, along with other voice and data telecommunications services.

=== Geographic history ===
TVNZ&#x27;s primary television channel TV One is provided as four distinct terrestrial feeds, localising to viewers within and around the Auckland, Waikato, Wellington and Christchurch regions. Localised satellite feeds were made available in 2010 to channel-locked SD receivers. Localised content currently only consists of targeted regional advertising spots toward the end of a commercial break. Localised regional news programming was discontinued in the late 1980s and all localised versions for TV2 were discontinued in the early 2000s in favour of only national advertising.

TVNZ&#x27;s predecessor, NZBC started as distinct stations in Auckland, Wellington, Christchurch and Dunedin. Nationwide networked services were first introduced in July 1969 to broadcast the Apollo 11 landing footage, flown in specially from Australia, from Wellington simultaneously across all stations. However, the network was still incomplete, and in some places, outside broadcast vans were strategically placed to temporarily complete missing links. The network was fully completed in November that year.

The national television network consisted of microwave links linking the major transmitters via intermediate repeaters. In 1985, the microwave network extended from Maungataniwha in Northland to Obelisk in Central Otago via Auckland, Waikato, Taupo, Hawke&#x27;s Bay (with a spur to Gisborne), Manawatu (with a spur to Taranaki), Wairarapa, Wellington, Marlborough (with a spur to Nelson and the West Coast), Canterbury, Dunedin and Southland. Broadcast relay stations served areas off the microwave network.

TVNZ also used to run telethons up until 1990 at locations around the country, viewers would be shown full coverage of the Telethon nearest their location. Originally when TVNZ began broadcasting TV One and TV2 on Sky Digital at the end of 2001 viewers would see only nationwide or Auckland advertisements when watching these channels through the Sky Digital service. In 2004 this was expanded to show one of three feeds for regional advertising spots targeting Auckland, Wellington or Christchurch with viewers outside of these regions seeing advertisements from the closest region. This was again dropped in March 2007 with a return to only nationwide advertising on TVNZ channels on Sky Digital before being reintroduced through the Freeview SD service. Regional advertising spots are only shown on TV One on both Digital and Analogue platforms however those that receive the HD version of TV One through their HD receiver will only see Auckland advertisements. Standard DVB satellite receivers will scan in all versions to be selected by the viewer.

Wellington-based Avalon Studios, long a nucleus of TV production in New Zealand, was finally put up for sale by TVNZ in 2011, with most of its remaining shows relocating to Auckland, completing a trend of northward drift by the broadcaster. TV production was spread evenly around the country in the 1970s, but according to Wellington-based TV personalities, the drift to Auckland began in 1980 with the formation of TVNZ, and the subsequent relocation of the TV One newsroom and headquarters to Auckland under then Prime Minister Rob Muldoon.

In Christchurch, the original TVNZ studios were located at Gloucester Street in the NZBC owned building used to broadcast 3YA and 3ZB. A 14-storey building was also built on Worcester Street as studios for various TVNZ shows, notable shows to be filmed here included &quot;What Now&quot; and &quot;The Son of a Gunn Show&quot;. In 1998 TVNZ closed its Christchurch studios. What Now was moved to the Wellington-based Avalon Studios for a few years but moved back to Christchurch to be filmed at the privately owned Whitebait studios. Prior to the 2011 Christchurch earthquake on 22 February, the Worcester Street building continued to house Christchurch radio stations previously owned by RNZ and now owned by NZME (formerly The Radio Network); stations included Newstalk ZB, Classic Hits 97.7 and 91ZM. The Gloucester Street building remained as Christchurch based newsroom for TVNZ until the building was badly damaged in the quake, and has since been demolished. The Worcester Street building was demolished on 5 August 2012 by implosion.

The Dunedin studios were used to film many iconic shows, such as &quot;Play School&quot;, &quot;University Challenge&quot;, &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot;, and &quot;Spot On&quot;. When TVNZ scaled back its Dunedin studios in 1989, they were purchased by Ian Taylor, the founder of Animation Research and Taylormade Media.

=== DVB-S availability ===
TV One, TV2 and the hour delayed versions are available &quot;in the clear&quot; over DVB-S on Optus D1 as standard definition only. A Sky set-top box is not required, any satellite set-top box or tuner will work. However the high definition versions on DVB-S2 are scrambled and require a Sky Television H.264 set-top box such as MySky, which costs the price of a basic subscription plus addition MySky rental fee.

=== Civil Defence ===
TVNZ&#x27;s functions are subject to &quot;lifeline utility requirements&quot; under NZ civil defence legislation. In practice, this status as a lifeline utility requires TVNZ to be able to function at least to a reduced level after an emergency, and to provide advice to civil defence authorities when requested.

=== Details prior to December 2013 digital switchover ===

==== Technical notes ====
New Zealand uses PAL B (7 MHz channel spacing) on VHF, and PAL G (8 MHz channel spacing) on UHF.
* While Australia also uses PAL B on VHF, the frequency allocations of NZ differ somewhat from Australia.
* Australia uses PAL B (7 MHz channel spacing) for UHF, so most UHF channels are on different frequencies.
* For stereo sound New Zealand uses NICAM on a non-standard offset from the monaural FM audio signal, while Australia uses the standard European offset for A2 Stereo. With NICAM being a digital signal, it has a higher chance of drop out over distance and from interference than A2 Stereo.
* Because of these differences, some Australian TV sets (when taken to NZ) are only capable of mono sound reproduction, and many VHF channels may not be received (properly) or come in at all.
* TVNZ (for historical and technical reasons) uses the greatest number of VHF frequencies in New Zealand.

==== NICAM stereo ====
New Zealand has a near nationwide implementation of NICAM stereo sound for TV One and TV2. 
NICAM stereo was first made available on TV2 in the Auckland region in 1989, also during the early 1990s Simulated Stereo was available in Wellington on TV2. NICAM stereo was not rolled out to the rest of the country or onto TV One until 1996 and for some regions (such as Southland) NICAM was not available until 2001. Rival network Three has offered NICAM stereo in all available regions since its launch in 1989; this is also the case with Prime TV. Stereo sound is available on all TVNZ channels if accessed through Sky Digital or Freeview.

== Visual identity ==
In 1980, TVNZ was launched as Television New Zealand, the logo consists of a four red stars overlap together with the name below. Later in 1982, the logo changed to four point stars on the red and blue octagon shape. 5 years later, the octagon was changed to blue and the stars are changed to red. In 1994, it changed the name to TVNZ, the logo consists of the letters TVNZ coloured in purple, red, green, and light blue. 10 years later, it consists of the name in a futuristic font with letters TV in black and letters NZ in light teal. Today, TVNZ launched a new logo consists of a blue spiral with the letters TVNZ in a new font.

== Competitors ==
TVNZ&#x27;s major competitors in the television market are

<text>Nguyễn (阮) (sometimes abbreviated as Ng̃) is the most common surname of the Vietnamese people. 

Outside of Vietnam, the surname is commonly rendered without diacritics as &quot;Nguyen&quot;. 

By some estimates 30 to 39 percent of Vietnamese people bear this surname.

==Origin and usage==
 is the transcription of the Sino-Vietnamese pronunciation of the character , which originally was used to write a name of a state in Gansu or an ancient Chinese instrument ruan. The same Chinese character is often romanized as in Mandarin and as in Cantonese.

The first recorded mention of a person surnamed Nguyễn is a description dating AD 317, of a journey to Giao Châu undertaken by Eastern Jin dynasty officer Nguyễn Phu and his family. Many events in Vietnamese history have contributed to the name&#x27;s prominence. In 1232, after usurping the Lý dynasty, Trần Thủ Độ forced the descendants of the Lý to change their surname to Nguyễn. When Hồ Quý Ly overturned the Trần dynasty, he killed many of their descendants so when the Hồ dynasty collapsed in 1407, many of his descendants changed their surname to Nguyễn in fear of retribution. In 1592, on the collapse of the Mạc dynasty, their descendants changed their surname to Nguyễn. In late 16th century, the Tư Mã clan from Thanh Hóa changed to Nguyễn and settled in Cochinchina. When the Nguyễn dynasty (the descendants of the Nguyễn Lords) took power in 1802, some of the descendants of the Trịnh Lords fearing retribution changed their surname to Nguyễn, while others fled north into China.

=== Other countries ===
The Nguyen surname also appears in China () but is significantly less common than its Vietnamese counterpart.

==Overseas Vietnamese usage==
The prevalence of Nguyễn as a family name in Vietnam extends to outside the country, due to numerous and widespread Vietnamese emigrants. Outside Vietnam, the surname is commonly rendered without diacritics, as &quot;Nguyen&quot;. Nguyen was the seventh most common family name in Australia in 2006 (second only to Smith in Melbourne phone books), and the 54th most common in France. It was the 41st most common surname in Norway in 2020 and tops the foreign name list in the Czech Republic.

In the United States, Nguyen is the 38th most-common surname and is shared by more than 437,000 individuals, according to the 2010 Census; it was the 57th and 229th most-common surname, respectively, in the 2000 and 1990 censuses. It is also the most common exclusively East Asian surname. It is ranked 124th in the U.S. Social Security Index. Nguyen was the 57th most common surname in the whole of Australia in 2022.

== Subfamilies ==

In Vietnamese tradition, people are referred to by their personal names and not by their family names even in formal situations. However, some groups distinguish themselves from other Nguyễn by passing elements of their names that are usually considered middle names to their children. This practice is more common with male than with female children. Some of the prominent subgroups within the Nguyễn family are:

* Nguyễn Phước or Nguyễn Phúc (阮福): Surname for the Nguyễn Lords family members, and all members of the Nguyễn dynasty emperors.
* Nguyễn Đình 
* Nguyễn Hữu 
* Nguyễn Cảnh 
* Nguyễn Khắc 
* Nguyễn Tiến 
* Nguyễn Đức 
* Nguyễn Minh 
* Nguyễn Thanh 
* Nguyễn Ngọc 
* Nguyễn Văn 
* Nguyễn Quang 
* Nguyễn Xuân 
* Nguyễn Huy 
* Nguyễn Hoàng 
* Tôn Thất (Tôn Nữ for females): surname for members of the Nguyễn dynasty royal family that were not direct descendants of the Emperor.

== Pronunciation ==
The Vietnamese pronunciation is in Northern dialect or in Southern dialect, in both cases, in one syllable. is the velar nasal found in the middle of the English word &quot;singer&quot;. is the semivowel found in the English word win&quot;. is a rising diphthong, the sound of which is similar to the diphthong found in the British English Received Pronunciation of &quot;ear&quot;. Finally, occurs in the English word net&quot;.

Furthermore, in Vietnamese Nguyễn is also pronounced with a tone. In Southern Vietnam, it is pronounced with the dipping tone: the pitch of the voice first drops from a mid-level to the bottom of the speaker&#x27;s range of pitch and then rises back to mid. In Northern Vietnam, it is pronounced with the creaky rising tone: the pitch of the voice rises from mid-level to the top of the speaker&#x27;s range of pitch, but with constricted vocal cords, akin to a glottal stop in the middle of the vowel.

Common pronunciations by English speakers include , and .

==Changes of family name==
There have been various points in Vietnam&#x27;s history at which people have changed their family name to Nguyễn.
When the Lý dynasty fell in 1232, Trần Thủ Độ, who orchestrated its overthrow, forced descendants of the Lý dynasty to adopt the name due to the naming taboo surrounding Trần Lý, grandfather to emperor Trần Cảnh.

From 457 to Hồ Quý Ly (1401), in Hải Dương and a part of Haiphong today there is the district of the Phí family (Vietnamese: ). At the end of the Lý and the Trần dynasty there were many people who changed their names to Nguyễn and Nguyễn Phí. By the Lê dynasty, the court changed the name of the district to Kim Thành.

When the Mạc dynasty fell in 1592, their descendants changed their family name to Nguyễn.

Trần Quang Diệu (like his wife Bùi Thị Xuân) worked as a major officer for the Tây Sơn dynasty, against Nguyễn Ánh. After the Tây Sơn dynasty was defeated, his children adopted various names or changed names (one of them into Nguyễn) in order to flee retaliation.

Historically in Vietnam and many East Asian countries, the rulers may let their courtiers share their family name as a reward for their loyalty. Many officials thereby changed their name to match that of the last Nguyễn dynasty (1802–1945). Civilians also adopted the name during the Trịnh–Nguyễn Civil War for purposes of social climbing, having migrated from the north to the south. Even the Tây Sơn Brothers changed their name to Nguyễn from Hồ.

==Notable people==

People with the name include:
*Heads of state (Nguyễn Minh Triết, Nguyễn Phú Trọng, Nguyễn Xuân Phúc, Nguyễn Xí, Nguyễn lords, Tây Sơn dynasty, Nguyễn dynasty, Nguyễn Văn Thiệu, Nguyễn Văn Xuân, Nguyễn Ngọc Thơ, Nguyễn Cao Kỳ...)
*Poets (Nguyễn Trãi, Nguyễn Du, Nguyễn Đình Chiểu, Nguyễn Khoa Điềm).
*Catholic clergymen (Nguyễn Văn Thuận)
*Writers (Viet Thanh Nguyen)
*Scientists (Nam-Trung Nguyen)
*Composers, actors (Dustin Nguyen)
*Models (Nguyễn Thúc Thùy Tiên)
*Professional poker players (Scotty Nguyen)
*Professional American football player (Dat Nguyen)
*Professional footballer (Lee Nguyen)
*Professional Badminton World Federation player Nguyễn Tiến Minh
Hồ Chí Minh was born Nguyễn Sinh Cung and used various names with the surname Nguyễn throughout his career (, ). He was not known as Hồ Chí Minh until late in his life.

<text>The Worshipful Company of Merchant Taylors is one of the 111 livery companies of the City of London.

The Company, originally known as the &quot;Guild and Fraternity of St John the Baptist in the City of London&quot;, was founded prior to 1300, first incorporated under a royal charter in 1327, confirmed by later charters in 1408, 1503 and 1719.

Its seat is the Merchant Taylors&#x27; Hall between Threadneedle Street and Cornhill, a site it has occupied since at least 1347. The Company&#x27;s motto is &quot;Concordia Parvae Res Crescunt&quot;, from the Roman historian Sallust meaning &quot;In Harmony Small Things Grow&quot;.

==History==
The Company was at first an association of tailors. By the end of the 17th century, its connection with the tailoring trade had virtually ceased and it became what it is today, a philanthropic and social association – albeit that it has recently rekindled its links with Savile Row and is the principal sponsor and organiser of the prestigious biannual &quot;Golden Shears&quot; competition for aspiring young tailors.

It owns Merchant Taylors&#x27; School in Sandy Lodge and St John&#x27;s Preparatory School in Northwood, both in Hertfordshire, and is associated with Merchant Taylors&#x27; School, Crosby, Merchant Taylors&#x27; Girls&#x27; School in Crosby, Wolverhampton Grammar School, Foyle and Londonderry College, Wallingford School, and The King&#x27;s School, Macclesfield. It is also associated with St John&#x27;s College, Oxford, founded by Sir Thomas White (a Master of the Company) in 1555, and with Pembroke College, Cambridge. It donates prizes to St. Helen&#x27;s School in Northwood, which is considered its &#x27;sister school&#x27;, and supports an opera student at the Guildhall School of Music and Drama. It also supports Treloar School in Hampshire, a school and college for children with physical disabilities.

It has a major interest in charitable support for the elderly and isolated in Inner London, as well as for people living with disabilities. It is a major provider of almshouses in the London Borough of Lewisham and has plans to develop brand new accommodation for local elderly people.

==Ranking==
Under an order issued by mayor Robert Billesden in 1484, the Company ranks in sixth or seventh place (making it one of the Great Twelve City Livery Companies) in the order of precedence of the Livery Companies, alternating with the Skinners&#x27; Company. The annual switch occurs at Easter. The Merchant Taylors are normally sixth in the order of precedence in odd numbered years, and at seven in even numbered years.

<text>A RAMDAC (random-access memory digital-to-analog converter) is a combination of three fast digital-to-analog converters (DACs) with a small static random-access memory (SRAM) used in computer graphics display controllers or video cards to store the color palette and to generate the analog signals (usually a voltage amplitude) to drive a color monitor. The logical color number from the display memory is fed into the address inputs of the SRAM to select a palette entry to appear on the data output of the SRAM. This entry is composed of three separate values corresponding to the three components (red, green, and blue) of the desired physical color. Each component value is fed to a separate DAC, whose analog output goes to the monitor, and ultimately to one of its three electron guns (or equivalent in non-CRT displays).

RAMDACs became obsolete as DVI, HDMI, DisplayPort and other digital interface technology became mainstream, which transfer video data digitally (via transition-minimized differential signaling or low-voltage differential signaling) and defer digital-to-analog conversion until the monitor&#x27;s pixels are actuated.

== History ==
The term &quot;RAMDAC&quot; did not enter into common PC-terminology until IBM introduced the IBM VGA display adapter in 1987. The IBM VGA adapter used the INMOS G171 RAMDAC. The INMOS VGA RAMDAC was a separate chip, featured a 256-color (8-bit CLUT) display from a palette of possible values, and supported pixel-rates up to approximately 30Mpix/s.

As clone manufacturers copied IBM VGA hardware, they also copied the INMOS VGA RAMDAC. Advances in semiconductor manufacturing and PC processing power allowed RAMDACs to add &quot;direct-color&quot; operation, which is a mode of operation that allows the SVGA-controller to pass a pixel&#x27;s color value directly to the DAC-inputs, thereby bypassing the RAM lookup-table. Another innovation was Edsun&#x27;s CEGDAC, which featured hardware-assisted spatial anti-aliasing for line/vector draw operations.

By the early 1990s, the PC chip industry had advanced to the point where RAMDACs were integrated into the display controller chip, thus reducing the number of discrete chips and the cost of video cards. Consequently, the market for standalone RAMDACs disappeared. Today, RAMDACs are still manufactured and sold for niche applications, but in obviously limited quantity.

In modern PCs, the RAMDAC(s) are integrated into the display controller chip, which itself may be mounted on an add-in-board or integrated into the motherboard core-logic chipset. The original purpose of the RAMDAC, to provide a CLUT-based display mode, is rarely used, having been supplanted by True Color display modes. However, many CAD and video editing applications use hardware overlay, combined with the programmable palette, to ensure the user interface does not disrupt the rendering of editing window.

== Design ==
The size of each DAC of the RAMDAC is 6 to 10 bits. The SRAM&#x27;s word length must be at least three times as large as the size of each DAC. The SRAM acts as a color lookup table (CLUT). It usually has 256 entries (and thus an 8-bit address). If the DAC&#x27;s word length is also 8 bits, we have a 256× 24-bit SRAM which allows a selection of 256 out of (16.7 million) possible colors for the display. The contents of this SRAM can be altered when no pixel needs to be generated for transmission to the display, which occurs during the vertical blanking interval between every frame.

The SRAM can usually be bypassed and the DACs can be fed color directly by display data, for True color modes. In fact this has become very much the normal mode of operation of a RAMDAC since the mid-1990s, so the programmable palette is mostly retained only as a legacy feature to ensure compatibility with old software. In many newer graphics cards, the RAMDAC can be clocked much faster in true color modes, when only the DAC part without the SRAM is used.

A quick estimation on the pixel clock for a given output can be found with:

: Pixels, horizontally, per line × lines, vertically, per display × 1.4 (factor in any blanking) × rate of display updates (refresh rate)

The ability to drive transitions for sharp edges usually incurs, for the RAMDAC, a significant requirement in excess of the pixel clock.

As of 2006, the DAC of a modern graphics card runs at a clock rate of 400MHz. However, video cards based on the XGI Volari XP10 run at 420 MHz DAC. The highest documented DAC frequency ever achieved on a production video card for the PC platform is 550 MHz, set by BarcoMed 5MP2 Aura 76Hz by Barco.

<text>The &#x27; (), also known as the &#x27; (German for &#x27;Viennese Music Association&#x27;), is an Austrian music organization that was founded in 1812 by Beethoven’s friend Joseph Sonnleithner, general secretary of the Court Theatre in Vienna, Austria.

==Overview==
Its official charter, drafted in 1814, stated that the purpose of the Gesellschaft was to promote music in all its facets. In early 1818, Franz Schubert was rejected for membership in the Gesellschaft as a professional musician, something that might have furthered his musical career. 

The Gesellschaft accomplished its goals by sponsoring concerts, founding the Vienna Conservatory in 1819, founding the Wiener Singverein in 1858, constructing the Musikverein building in 1870, and by systematically collecting and archiving noteworthy music-history documents. It is now one of the world&#x27;s leading music archives.

The first music director of the Gesellschaft was Carl Heissler, who was followed by Anton Rubinstein (appointed in 1871) and Johannes Brahms (appointed in 1872). Other notable music directors include Wilhelm Furtwängler, Herbert von Karajan and Gustav Mahler. Membership in the Gesellschaft has included a who&#x27;s who of notable 19th- and 20th-century musical figures, including composers, conductors and instrumentalists.

<text>nForce is a motherboard chipset created by Nvidia originally for AMD Athlon and Duron, with later revisions also supporting contemporary Intel processors. The chipset shipped in 3 varieties; 220, 415, and 420. 220 and 420 are very similar with each having the integrated GPU, but the 220 only has a single channel of memory available whereas 420 has the 128-bit TwinBank design. The 415 variant again has the dual-channel memory interface, but has no integrated graphics.

==Innovations==

===Dual channel &amp; GeForce2 MX IGP===
The nForce chipset introduced a dual-channel memory controller to the mainstream motherboard market, doubling theoretical throughput, and offering very competitive performance most especially in workstation class benchmarks. This dual-channel design was deemed necessary largely because of the added integrated GeForce 2 MX class video hardware. For the relatively fast integrated graphics processor (IGP) to have adequate memory bandwidth it needed more than to simply share a single memory channel with the Athlon XP CPU.

===Ethernet and DASP===
Nvidia also touted both their built-in Ethernet controller, and a new memory prefetch mechanism called the Dynamic Adaptive Speculative Pre-Processor (DASP). The Nvidia-built Ethernet controller was supposedly capable of reducing CPU overhead while being also very fast. The DASP unit helped reduce memory latency for the main CPU by prefetching often needed data, or data that the DASP predicted the CPU would need. Many considered it somewhat an advanced Level 3 cache device.

===nForce APU (SoundStorm) ===
Nvidia debuted their advanced NVAPU audio solution, branded SoundStorm, on the nForce MCP-D southbridge chip. It is the same as the audio processor in the Xbox chipset and supports many hardware-accelerated 2D/3D audio channels and advanced HRTF 3D audio spatialization provided largely by Sensaura. It also has a built-in processor for encoding computer audio into a Dolby Digital Live signal for external receivers to decode into a 5.1-channel audio spread. With its hardware acceleration, the difference in CPU usage when running popular multimedia applications was as much as 10-20%, potentially allowing faster performance in programs that are limited by the system CPU.

==Performance and problems==
The original nForce chipset was let down by patchy driver support and less than optimal hardware design. Performance of the dual-channel memory controller and &quot;DASP&quot; did not greatly surpass the VIA Technologies KT266A chipset that was usually as fast and cheaper. The optimized parallel ATA driver support was introduced and then withdrawn after hardware incompatibilities showed up, and the much heralded SoundStorm audio was seen to crackle under heavily loaded scenarios. In fact, the ATA driver would remain an issue at least into the life of nForce4 where it was still known to cause problems with some hard drives and optical drives .

<doc id="369477" wikidata="Q7015817" url="?curid=369477" title="New Zealand University Bursary">
<text>The New Zealand University Entrance, Bursaries and Scholarships, more commonly known as Bursary, was a former New Zealand secondary school qualification obtained by Year 13 (Form 7), and sometimes, Year 12 (Form 6), secondary school students. Bursary was used to qualify students for entrance to university, award of bursaries and/or scholarship grades. 

Up to six subjects could be taken, and depending on which, assessment could involve internal projects and/or a national examination undertaken near the end of the school year. Some examples include: Physical Education (PE), which was fully internally assessed, with external moderation (conducted by New Zealand Qualifications Authority); Biology, which included internally assessed components, as well as a national exam; or Practical Art, which was assessed on a folio of work submitted for national assessment.

To gain a Bursary, students had to achieve an aggregate score of at least 250 from up to five Bursary subjects; each subject marked out of 100 with Art counting as a double-subject. An &#x27;A&#x27; Bursary was awarded to candidates achieving a total score of 300 or higher, while &#x27;B&#x27; Bursaries were awarded for scores between 250 and 299. To gain University Entrance via the Bursaries Examinations, students were required to get a &#x27;C&#x27; grade or better in at least three subjects. Candidates who did not get an &#x27;A&#x27; or &#x27;B&#x27; Bursary had their Bursary scores count toward University Entrance provided their subjects scored at least 40%. Between 1989 and 2003, those coming in the top 3–4% of their subject also won a scholarship, whereas previously Scholarship had required entering additional examinations.

External examination results were scaled not only to ensure consistency from subject to subject and year to year, but, more controversially, also so that only 50% of the nationwide candidates achieved an &#x27;A&#x27; or &#x27;B&#x27; Bursary.

In 2004, the Bursary was replaced by the National Certificate of Educational Achievement at Level 3 and scholarships by the New Zealand Scholarship.

This qualification was awarded by the New Zealand Universities Entrance Board until 1990 and then was awarded by the New Zealand Qualifications Authority until Bursary&#x27;s demise.

<doc id="369479" wikidata="Q682257" url="?curid=369479" title="Actaea racemosa">
<text>Actaea racemosa, the black cohosh, black bugbane, black snakeroot, rattle-top, or fairy candle (syn. &quot;Cimicifuga racemosa&quot;), is a species of flowering plant of the family Ranunculaceae. It is native to eastern North America from the extreme south of Ontario to central Georgia, and west to Missouri and Arkansas. It grows in a variety of woodland habitats, and is often found in small woodland openings. 

The roots and rhizomes are used in traditional medicine by Native Americans. Its extracts are manufactured as herbal medicines or dietary supplements. Most dietary supplements containing black cohosh are not well-studied or recommended for safe and effective use in treating menopause symptoms or any disease. In contrast, some herbal medicinal products containing black cohosh extract hold a marketing authorization in several states of the European Union and are well-studied and recommended for safe and effective use for the relief of menopausal symptoms, such as hot flashes and profuse sweating. Such differentiation between the product types seems to be important.

==Taxonomy==
The plant species has a history of taxonomic uncertainty. Carl Linnaeus, on the basis of morphological characteristics of the inflorescence and seeds, placed the species into the genus &quot;Actaea&quot;. This designation was later revised by Thomas Nuttall reclassifying the species to the genus &quot;Cimicifuga&quot;. Nuttall&#x27;s classification was based solely on the dry follicles produced by black cohosh, which are typical of species in &quot;Cimicifuga&quot;. However, recent data from morphological and gene phylogeny analyses demonstrate that black cohosh is more closely related to species of the genus &quot;Actaea&quot; than to other &quot;Cimicifuga&quot; species. This has prompted the revision to &quot;Actaea racemosa&quot; as originally proposed by Linnaeus. Blue cohosh (&quot;Caulophyllum thalictroides&quot;), despite its similar common name belongs to another family, the Berberidaceae, is not closely related to black cohosh, and may be unsafe if used together.

==Description==
Black cohosh is a smooth (glabrous) herbaceous perennial plant that produces large, compound leaves from an underground rhizome, reaching a height of . The basal leaves are up to long and broad, forming repeated sets of three leaflets (tripinnately compound) having a coarsely toothed (serrated) margin.

The flowers are produced in late spring and early summer on a tall stem, tall, forming racemes up to long. The flowers have no petals or sepals, and consist of tight clusters of 55–110 white, long stamens surrounding a white stigma. The flowers have a distinctly sweet, fetid smell that attracts flies, gnats, and beetles.

The fruit is a dry follicle long, with one carpel, containing several seeds.

==Cultivation==
&quot;A. racemosa&quot; grows in dependably moist, fairly heavy soil. It bears tall tapering racemes of white midsummer flowers on wiry black-purple stems, whose mildly unpleasant, medicinal smell at close range gives it the common name &quot;Bugbane&quot;. The drying seed heads stay handsome in the garden for many weeks. Its deeply cut, superficially maple-like leaves, burgundy colored in the variety &quot;atropurpurea&quot;, add interest to gardens, wherever summer heat and drought do not make it die back, which make it a popular garden perennial. It has gained the Royal Horticultural Society&#x27;s Award of Garden Merit.

The plant was Virginia Native Plant Society’s 2017 wildflower of the year.

==Traditional medicine==
===History===
Native Americans used black cohosh in the belief it could treat gynecological and other disorders. Following the arrival of European settlers in the U.S. who continued the use of black cohosh, the plant appeared in the U.S. Pharmacopoeia under the name &quot;black snakeroot&quot;. In the 19th century, the root was used to treat snakebite, inflamed lungs, and pain from childbirth.

===Herbalism===
Extracts from the underground parts of the plant — the rhizome (&quot;Cimicifugae racemosae&quot; rhizoma) and the root (&quot;Cimicifugae racemosae&quot; radix) — are used in herbal medicine. The rhizomes and roots contain various saponins (triterpene saponins and triterpene glycosides, such as actein) as well as cimifugic acids and other phenol carboxylic acids.

In most European countries, China, Malaysia, Thailand, Argentina and some other countries, black cohosh products are available as herbal products which have been approved by regulatory authorities ensuring reliable pharmaceutical quality, safety and efficacy for the relief of menopausal complaints such as hot flushes and profuse sweating. In the U.S., India, and some other countries, black cohosh is used as a dietary supplement marketed mainly to women for treating menopausal symptoms and other gynecological problems. Meta-analyses of contemporary evidence support these claims on menopausal complaints only for products holding a marketing authorization for this indication, whereas there is no high-quality scientific evidence to support such uses for other products.

===Safety concerns===
The Herbal Medicinal Product Committee (HMPC) at the European Medicines Agency (EMA) has summarized the adverse drug reactions of herbal medicines made from cimicifuga with mentioning allergic skin reactions (urticaria, itching, exanthema), facial oedema and peripheral oedema, and gastrointestinal symptoms (i.e. dyspeptic disorders, diarrhoea).

Studies on the long-term safety of using herbal medicines made from black cohosh are available. They do not show harmful effects on breast tissue, endometrium, or breast cancer survivors. In contrast, such studies have not been published for dietary supplements made from black cohosh. Most black cohosh materials are harvested from the wild. Lack of proper authentication and adulteration of commercial preparations by other plant species are risk factors in dietary supplements and a critical matter of quality control in herbal medicinal products holding a marketing authorization. Very high doses of black cohosh may cause nausea, dizziness, visual effects, a lower heart rate, and increased perspiration.

Worldwide, some 83 cases of liver damage, including hepatitis, liver failure, and elevated liver enzymes, have been associated with using black cohosh, although a cause-and-effect relationship remains undefined. Millions of women have taken black cohosh without reporting adverse health effects, and a meta-analysis of clinical trials found no evidence that black cohosh preparations had adverse effects on liver function. Package leaflets of phytomedicines made from black cohosh caution that people with liver problems should not take it, although a 2011 meta-analysis of research evidence suggested this concern may be unfounded. In 2007, the Australian Government warned that black cohosh may cause liver damage, although rarely, and should not be used without medical supervision. Other studies concluded that liver damage from use of black cohosh is unlikely. The clinical picture is similar to an autoimmune hepatitis with centrilobular liver cell necrosis, which can be treated with corticosteroids.

===Phytochemicals===
The rhizomes and roots of black cohosh (&quot;Cimicifuga racemosa&quot; rhizoma) contain diverse phytochemicals, particularly triterpene glycosides, such as actein and cimicifugoside, cimicifugin, caffeic acid, various saponins, and phenolic acids.

<text>In organic chemistry, an addition reaction is an organic reaction in which two or more molecules combine to form a larger molecule called the &quot;adduct&quot;.
An addition reaction is limited to chemical compounds that have multiple bonds. Examples include a molecule with a carbon–carbon double bond (an alkene) or a triple bond (an alkyne). Another example is a compound that has rings (which are also considered points of unsaturation). A molecule that has carbon—heteroatom double bonds, such as a carbonyl group () or imine group (), can undergo an addition reaction because its double-bond.

An addition reaction is the reverse of an elimination reaction, in which one molecule divides into two or more molecules. For instance, the hydration of an alkene to an alcohol is reversed by dehydration. 

There are two main types of polar addition reactions: electrophilic addition and nucleophilic addition. Two non-polar addition reactions exist as well, called free-radical addition and cycloadditions. Addition reactions are also encountered in polymerizations and called addition polymerization. 

Depending on the product structure, it could promptly react further to eject a leaving group to give the addition–elimination reaction sequence.

Addition reactions are useful in analytic chemistry, as they can identify the existence and number of double bonds in a molecule. For example, bromine addition will consume a bromine solution, resulting in a color change: 

:&lt;chem display=block&gt;RR&#x27;C=CR&quot;R+ Br2(orange-brown) -&gt;[{}\atop\ce{CCl4}] RR&#x27;CBr-BrCR&quot;R(typically\ colorless)&lt;/chem&gt; 

Likewise hydrogen addition often proceeds on all double-bonds of a molecule, and thus gives a count of the number of a double and triple bonds through stoichiometry:
:&lt;chem display=block&gt;{(H2C=CH)2} + 2H2 -&gt;[{}\atop\ce{Pt}/\ce{Pd}] (H3C-CH2)2&lt;/chem&gt;

<text>The Worshipful Company of Skinners (also known as the Skinners&#x27; Company) is one of the Great Twelve Livery Companies of the City of London. Originally formed as an association of those engaged in the trade of skins and furs, the Company was granted a Royal Charter in 1327.

The Company&#x27;s motto is &quot;To God Only Be All Glory&quot;. 

The Master Skinner for 2024/25 is the Earl of Woolton and, since 2015, Major-General Andrew Kennett serves as Clerk to the Skinners&#x27; Company.

==History==
Under an order issued by the Lord Mayor of London on 10 April 1484 (known as the Billesdon Award), the Company ranks in sixth or seventh place (making it one of the &quot;Great Twelve City Livery Companies&quot;) in the order of precedence of City Livery Companies, alternating annually with the Merchant Taylors&#x27; Company; these livery companies have borrowed Chaucer&#x27;s phrase &quot;at sixes and sevens&quot; to describe their rivalry over precedence – specifically which company was entitled to be 6th in order of seniority – being a source of trouble between the Skinners and the Merchant Taylors for some time during the 15th, and perhaps even 14th centuries. Both companies received their first Royal Charters in 1327, but the dispute erupted into lethal violence at the 1484 Lord Mayor&#x27;s river procession, an occasion which the two guilds treated as their own private boat race. After justice was administered to some of the offenders the then-Lord Mayor, Haberdasher Sir Robert Billesdon, mediated between the two companies at the request of their Masters, and he resolved that each company should have precedence over the other in alternate years and that each company&#x27;s Master and Wardens should be invited to dine at the other&#x27;s Hall every year.

The Skinners are normally sixth in the order of precedence in even numbered years, and at seven in odd numbered years, but as the Lord Mayor (Sir David Brewer) for 2005/06 was a member of the Merchant Taylors&#x27; Company they kept precedence. The Merchant Taylors retained precedence in 2006/07, their regular turn.

==Education==
In the present day the Skinners&#x27; Company is primarily an educational and charitable institution, supporting the following schools:
*Tonbridge School and The Judd School, Tonbridge;
*The Skinners&#x27; School, Skinners&#x27; Kent Primary School and The Skinners&#x27; Kent Academy, Royal Tunbridge Wells;
*Skinners&#x27; Academy, Hackney;
*The Marsh Academy, Romney Marsh;
*The New Beacon Preparatory School, Sevenoaks.

<text>Charis Alliance is a Christian denomination in the Schwarzenau Brethren tradition of Anabaptism. The word &quot;charis&quot; is Greek in origin, meaning &quot;grace.&quot;

The Charis Alliance differs from traditional Schwarzenau Brethren groups in that it does not uphold the doctrine of conditional security as historically taught in Anabaptist theology.

==History==
For the early history see Church of the Brethren.

===The Great Schism===

The Brethren (at the time called &quot;German Baptist Brethren&quot;) suffered a three-way division early in the 1880s, and the more progressive group organized the Brethren Church in 1883. Led by charismatic leader Henry Holsinger, they maintained the standard Brethren doctrines, but wanted to adopt new methods, and desired more congregational autonomy and less centralization. These more progressive Brethren moved into the direction of the mainstream of Christian evangelicalism in America. Several events in the late 19th century and early 20th century, including the Bible Conference movement, emphasis on foreign missions, and the rise of fundamentalism, affected the church. The &quot;Foreign Missionary Society of the Brethren Church&quot; was formed on September 4, 1900, in Winona Lake, Indiana.

===Fundamentalism rising===

But, also in the early 1900s, two different viewpoints began to emerge. As Robert Clouse writes about this event &quot;the Progressives showed considerable agreement in what they opposed, but were less united in what they wished to create.&quot; The Brethren Church had rejected classical liberal theology in 1921 with &quot;The Message of the Brethren Ministry&quot;, written by J. Allen Miller and Alva J. McClain. However the aggressive approach of fundamentalism, led by Louis S. Bauman and McClain, conflicted with the drawn out approach of traditional Brethrenism. The fundamentalists desired strongly worded statements of faith, the traditional Brethren stressed non-creedalism. The classic dispensationalist belief held by the fundamentalists largely disregarded the Sermon on the Mount as a law for an earlier age, while the traditional Brethren statement &quot;the New Testament is our Rule of Faith and Practice&quot; placed a high emphasis on this passage in Matthew 5–7.

===Division from the Brethren Church===

This tension finally erupted in 1936–37 with a growing controversy at Ashland College. Although the school was under the control of the Brethren Church, it was transitioning from a Christian denominational school to a secular school with a more regional focus. Because of a push to enlarge non-Brethren representation on the board of trustees and establish a &quot;double standard&quot; of conduct for regular college students and pre-seminary students, Bauman and Charles Ashman, Sr. (1886–1967) resigned from the Ashland College board of trustees on June 1, 1937. The next day, professors Alva J. McClain and Herman Hoyt were fired from Ashland Seminary due to increasing tension between the college group and the seminary group. At a prayer meeting in the home of J.C. Beal that evening Grace Theological Seminary was born, where after prayer Bauman announced &quot;I want to give the first gift to the new school.&quot;

In the next two years two groups emerged in the Brethren Church: those sympathetic with Ashland College and those sympathetic with Grace Seminary. Traditional Brethren, in part because of their drawn out approach and in part due to their distaste for fundamentalist theology, sided with Ashland College, while the fundamentalists led by Bauman and McClain, sided with Grace Seminary. In 1939, the Grace Seminary group formed the National Fellowship of Brethren Churches. The Fellowship incorporated in 1987 as the &quot;Fellowship of Grace Brethren Churches&quot;.

===Departure of the Conservative Grace Brethren===

Another division occurred in 1992, involving a coalition of fundamentalist pastors who were troubled by the continuing &quot;neo-evangelical&quot; drift that they perceived taking root within the larger body of the FGBC, ultimately resulting in the formation of the Conservative Grace Brethren Churches, International (CGBCI). The immediate issue of dissension concerned the question of open membership in regard to individuals who had not been baptized by trine immersion (the historic Brethren standard, which the Brethren traditionally believe is taught in the language of Matt. 28:19). The Conservative pastors (so called because they desired to &quot;conserve&quot; Biblical truth) ultimately saw the broader issue as one involving Biblical Fundamentalism vs. an unduly pragmatic neo-evangelicalism, and ultimately withdrew from the larger body as a matter of conviction.

===Charis Alliance===
In 2015, delegates from ministries in all the countries who associate with the Grace Brethren gathered in Bangkok, Thailand and formed the Charis Alliance. The Global Charis alliance adopted the Charis Commitment to Common Identity. 

==Beliefs==
The denomination has a confession of faith based on evangelical theology and the Believers&#x27; Church beliefs. 

== Statistics ==
According to a denomination census released in 2023, it claimed 200 churches in the United States and Canada.

<doc id="369496" wikidata="Q1044145" url="?curid=369496" title="Cold Spring Harbor (album)">
<text>Cold Spring Harbor is the debut studio album by American recording artist Billy Joel, released on November 1, 1971, by Family Productions. The album sold poorly, receiving attention mainly after 1973&#x27;s &quot;Piano Man&quot; and later albums became popular. Due to a mastering error, the original LP release ran at a faster speed than originally recorded. In 1983, producer Artie Ripp oversaw a remixed, edited and speed-corrected version of the album. This revised edition was issued by Columbia Records.

==Composition and recording==
&quot;Cold Spring Harbor&quot; was named after the hamlet in the town of Huntington, New York, located on Long Island Sound near Joel&#x27;s hometown. The front cover was photographed at Harbor Road.

The song &quot;Tomorrow Is Today&quot; drew from his period of depression and hospitalization the year before. When it was released as a single, &quot;Record World&quot; remarked that Joel had &quot;a flair for dramatic, lush orchestral sounds.&quot;

Joel later released live versions of &quot;She&#x27;s Got a Way&quot; and &quot;Everybody Loves You Now&quot; on his 1981 live album, &quot;Songs in the Attic&quot;. &quot;She&#x27;s Got a Way&quot; was also released as a single in early 1982, peaking at No. 23 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart.

==Production==
===Mastering===
Through an error in the album&#x27;s mastering, the songs played slightly too fast, causing Joel&#x27;s voice to sound unnaturally high, which he later compared to the Bee Gees and Alvin and the Chipmunks. In 1996, Joel recalled that, upon the album&#x27;s release, he had organized a listening party with his friends and after hearing the album &quot;I was, like, furious. I took the thing and I threw it like a frisbee.&quot;

Artie Ripp, owner of Family Productions and hence the owner of the original master tapes, was responsible for the production error, and the mistake cost him his friendship with Joel. He had originally signed the 22-year-old Joel to a ten-record contract that stripped Joel of all rights to the original tapes and to the publishing rights to all current and future songs.

As part of a deal with Columbia Records to release Joel from his contract, Ripp was still able to collect royalties on sales of Joel&#x27;s records long after Joel&#x27;s acrimonious departure from Family Productions (up until 1986&#x27;s &quot;The Bridge&quot;). Ripp only sold the publishing rights to Joel&#x27;s song catalog back to Joel reluctantly after intense pressure from CBS/Columbia Records president Walter Yetnikoff, who later stated that he had to threaten Ripp to finalize the deal.

===Remix===
In July–September 1983, Ripp and Larry Elliot remixed &quot;Cold Spring Harbor&quot; at Ripp&#x27;s Fidelity Studios in Studio City, California. The album&#x27;s speed was adjusted to correct Joel&#x27;s vocal tone, and to enhance the album&#x27;s sound, Ripp brought in studio musicians Mike McGee (drums), Al Campbell (synthesizers), and L.D. Dixon (Fender Rhodes) to overdub new rhythm sections on &quot;Everybody Loves You Now&quot; and &quot;Turn Around&quot;. In addition, &quot;You Can Make Me Free&quot; was truncated by nearly three minutes (removing most of the original tail-end, fadeout jam), and the bass, drums, and orchestration on &quot;Tomorrow Is Today&quot; were removed.

The remix was released through Columbia Records, without any involvement from Joel. In a 2012 interview with actor Alec Baldwin, Joel stated that, despite the remix, he believes that &quot;there&#x27;s something wrong with it. It just doesn&#x27;t sound right.&quot; The original, uncorrected version of the album can still be heard on the music streaming service Spotify.

<text>St. Johann im Pongau (&quot;Saiga Håns&quot; or &quot;Sainig Håns&quot; in the local Pongau dialect, abbreviated St.Johann/Pg.) is a city in the state of Salzburg, Austria. It is the administrative centre of the St. Johann im Pongau District.

==Geography==
The city is located in the Salzach Valley of the Eastern Alps, between the Salzburg Slate Alps in the north, the Radstadt Tauern (part of the Niedere Tauern range) in the southeast, and the Ankogel Group (Hohe Tauern) in the southwest. 

The city lies in the centre of the Salzburg Pongau region. The municipal area consists of cadastral communities of Ginau, Hallmoos, Maschl, Einöden, Plankenau, Reinbach, Rettenstein, St. Johann, and Urreiting.

The setting of the city allows the area to be largely dependent on tourism, Alpine skiing in winter and hiking in the summer months. A gorge called Liechtensteinklamm lies south of the city. This gorge is about long and can be explored via walkways, first built by Prince Johann II of Liechtenstein in 1875.

==History==
The Salzach Valley, an ancient copper mining area, has been settled at least since the Bronze Age. The settlement was first mentioned as &quot;Sanctum Johannem in Villa&quot; in a 1074 deed, named after John the Baptist. For centuries, it was a possession held by the Prince-Archbishops of Salzburg.

In the course of the German Peasants&#x27; War of 1525/26, large parts of the population became Protestant. Under the rule of Prince-Archbishop Count Leopold Anton von Firmian in 1731, numerous inhabitants (called &quot;Exulanten&quot;) were forced to leave the country. Many of them found refuge in the Kingdom of Prussia, choosing to settle in Gumbinnen (now &quot;Gusev&quot;).

In 1939, following the Austrian &quot;Anschluss&quot; to Nazi Germany, St. Johann was renamed &quot;Markt Pongau&quot; and from 1941 was the site of the World War II Stalag XVIII-C (317) German prisoner-of-war camp run by the Wehrmacht. Mainly French, Serbian and Red Army POWs, but also Polish, Belgian, Dutch, British, American, Hungarian and Italian POWs, were interred here. About 4,000 Soviet inmates were killed or succumbed to the conditions of their detention. A Russian Cemetery and a monument to this camp are located on the north end of the city. The camp was liberated by American troops on May 8, 1945.

On 24 June 2000 St. Johann completed the &quot;Stadtserhebung&quot; process and received official city privileges from the Austrian government.

== Sport ==
TSV St. Johann im Pongau are an association football team, who play at the Sportplatz St. Johann stadium. Around the football pitch is a motorcycle speedway track that has been used for important events, including the Austrian qualifying rounds of the Speedway World Championship (starting in 1990).

<doc id="369505" wikidata="Q2393642" url="?curid=369505" title="Handwriting">
<text>Handwriting is the personal and unique style of writing with a writing instrument, such as a pen or pencil in the hand. Handwriting includes both block and cursive styles and is separate from generic and formal handwriting script/style, calligraphy or typeface. Because each person&#x27;s handwriting is unique and different, it can be used to verify a document&#x27;s writer. The deterioration of a person&#x27;s handwriting is also a symptom or result of several different diseases. The inability to produce clear and coherent handwriting is also known as dysgraphia.

==Uniqueness==
Each person has their own unique style of handwriting, whether it is everyday handwriting or their personal signature. Cultural environment and the characteristics of the written form of the first language that one learns to write are the primary influences on the development of one&#x27;s own unique handwriting style. Even identical twins who share appearance and genetics do not have the same handwriting.

Characteristics of handwriting include:
* the specific shape of letters, e.g. their roundness or sharpness
* regular or irregular spacing between letters
* the slope of the letters
* the rhythmic repetition of the elements or arrhythmia
* the pressure to the paper
* the average size of letters
* the thickness of letters
* the spacing between letters, words and sentences

==Medical conditions==

Developmental dysgraphia is very often accompanied by other learning and/or neurodevelopmental disorder like ADHD. Similarly, people with ADD/ADHD have higher rates of dyslexia. It is unknown how many individuals with ADD/ADHD who also struggle with penmanship actually have undiagnosed specific learning disabilities like developmental dyslexia or developmental dysgraphia causing their handwriting difficulties.

Children with ADHD have been found to be more likely to have less legible handwriting, make more spelling errors, more insertions and/or deletions of letters and more corrections. In children with these difficulties, the letters tend to be larger with wide variability of letters, letter spacing, word spacing, and the alignment of letters on the baseline. Variability of handwriting increases with longer texts. Fluency of the movement is normal but children with ADHD were more likely to make slower movements during the handwriting task and hold the pen longer in the air between movements, especially when they had to write complex letters, implying that planning the movement may take longer. Children who have ADHD were more likely to have difficulty parameterising movements in a consistent way. This has been explained with motor skill impairment either due to lack of attention or lack of inhibition. To anticipate a change of direction between strokes, constant visual attention is essential. With inattention, changes will occur too late, resulting in higher letters and poor alignment of letters on the baseline. The influence of medication on the quality of handwriting is not clear.

==Graphology==
Graphology is the pseudoscientific study and analysis of handwriting in relation to human psychology. Graphology is primarily used as a recruiting tool in the applicant screening process for predicting personality traits and job performance, despite research showing consistently null correlations for these uses.

==Handwriting recognition==
== Pedagogy ==

=== Significance in education ===
As pen-and-paper assignments remain common throughout the century, handwriting practice exercises are still issued by instructors worldwide because handwriting is recognized as a primary tool for the communication of ideas. In order for handwriting to be efficiently utilized by students, it is ideal for the process to be familiar and automatic. The letter-writing skill can reflect the beginnings of orthographic knowledge well, and this knowledge has been shown to be important to spelling in older children. Better letter recognition can be facilitated by practicing handwriting in late preschool, as studies suggest that elementary students benefit from explicit handwriting instruction. With sufficient practice, legibility tends to improve over time.

Additionally, research indicates that handwriting production is more cognitively costly and challenging for children than oral language production. Poor handwriting skills and autonomy have been shown to often impair higher-level cognition and creative thinking in children, leading them to become labelled by their instructors as dysgraphic or clumsy. Meta-analysis of classroom assignments also found that the legibility of handwriting affects the grading of work as clearer handwriting tends to receive better marks than illegible or messier handwriting, the phenomenon of which has been coined &quot;the presentation effect.&quot; 

Also, it was found that movements through handwriting help children organize their perceptions and improve their ability to recognize letters by shaping their spatial understanding. In further study, because of the implied importance of handwriting to academic success, considerable research has been conducted into the efficacy of a variety of teaching methods. When quantifying writing fluency through parameters such as writing speed and duration of intermissions, teaching handwriting through digital tablets/technology, individualized instruction, and rote motor practice produced statistically significant increases in legibility and writing fluency which were able to be quantified.

Students with different levels of handwriting ability, including those with physical challenges, showed greater improvements in manuscript handwriting after receiving instruction through a computer-based system, compared to traditional methods.

=== Cognitive processes in writers ===
Children with specific learning disorders, such as poor/slow handwriting, have been observed in psychological study to follow specific mental frameworks which instructors can use to help pinpoint weakness in linguistic skill and develop their students&#x27; fluency and writing composition. The Hayes &amp; Berninger framework is a stratified web of interconnected thought processes which relate different cognitive processes to each other in their function of writing in general, and this framework has seen considerable use in pedagological research. For example, underdevelopment of long-term memory, which is in the lower &quot;resource level&quot; of cognitive strata, can then be linked to underdeveloped motor planning for hand-writing individual letters, which bottleneck higher-order cognitive processes such as sentence structure and other critical thinking.

== Phenomenology ==
For a wide variety of writers, writing by hand has been described as a process which enhances expressivity and the discovery of individuality. The act of writing has been described as more &quot;intimate&quot;, and the physical manipulation of a writing utensil on another physical medium, such as paper and pen, has been asserted to be more effective in conveying personal experiences and creating writing as art. In comparison to technological methods of printing writing, such as with a typewriter or a word processor, handwriting is said to be less impersonal and distancing by writers such as Pablo Neruda and William Barrett. Among many writers who agree with such viewpoints, the sensuality, touch, feel and materiality of handwriting seem to all contribute to a bodily experience which allegedly enhance creative writing.

<text>Lon Luvois Fuller (June 15, 1902 – April 8, 1978) was an American legal philosopher best known as a proponent of a secular and procedural form of natural law theory. Fuller was a professor of law at Harvard Law School for many years, and is noted in American law for his contributions to both jurisprudence and the law of contracts. His 1958 debate with the British legal philosopher H. L. A. Hart in the &quot;Harvard Law Review&quot; (the Hart–Fuller debate) was important in framing the modern conflict between legal positivism and natural law theory. In his widely discussed 1964 book &quot;The Morality of Law&quot;, Fuller argues that all systems of law contain an &quot;internal morality&quot; that imposes on individuals a presumptive obligation of obedience. Robert S. Summers said in 1984: &quot;Fuller was one of the four most important American legal theorists of the last hundred years&quot;.

==Life==
Fuller was born in Hereford, Texas and grew up in the Imperial Valley in Southern California. He went to Stanford University as an undergraduate and for law school. He taught at the University of Oregon School of Law, then at Duke University School of Law, where one of his students was future US president Richard Nixon. In 1940, he joined Harvard Law School, and was elevated to the Carter chair of jurisprudence in 1948. He remained at Harvard until retiring in 1972. He also practiced law with the firm of Ropes, Gray, Best, Coolidge &amp; Rugg at Boston, where he worked in labor arbitration. At Harvard, he taught both contract law and jurisprudence, and pushed to reform the pedagogical approach of the law faculty.

Fuller died at age 75 at his home in Cambridge, Massachusetts. He was survived by his wife, Marjorie, two children from a previous marriage – F. Brock Fuller and Cornelia F. Hopfield – and two stepchildren, William D. Chapple and Mimi Hinnawi. He had eight grandchildren.

==The internal morality of law==

In his 1958 debate with Hart and more fully in &quot;The Morality of Law&quot; (1964), Fuller sought to steer a middle course between traditional natural law theory and legal positivism. Like most legal academics of his day, Fuller rejected traditional religious forms of natural law theory, which view human law as rooted in a rationally knowable and universally binding &quot;higher law&quot; that derives from God. Fuller accepted the idea, found in the writings of some traditional natural law theorists, that in some cases unjust laws or legal systems are not law. In his famous &quot;Reply to Professor Hart&quot;, part of the Hart–Fuller debate, he wrote:
I would like to ask the reader whether he can actually share Professor Hart&#x27;s indignation that, in the perplexities of the postwar re-construction, the German courts saw fit to declare this thing not a law. Can it be argued seriously that it would have been more beseeming to the judicial process if the postwar courts had undertaken a study of &quot;the interpretative principles&quot; in force during Hitler&#x27;s rule and had then solemnly applied those &quot;principles&quot; to ascertain the meaning of this statute? On the other hand, would the courts really have been showing respect for Nazi law if they had constructed the Nazi statutes on their own, quite different, standards of interpretation? (p. 655)

Professor Hart castigates the German courts and Radbruch, not so much for what they believed had to be done, but because they failed to see that they were confronted by a moral dilemma of a sort that would have been immediately apparent to Bentham and Austin. By the simple dodge of saying, &quot;When a statute is sufficiently evil it ceases to be law,&quot; they ran away from the problem they should have faced.

This criticism is, I believe, without justification. So far as the courts are concerned, matters certainly would not have been helped if, instead of saying, &quot;This is not law,&quot; they had said, &quot;This is law but it is so evil we will refuse to apply it.&quot; (p. 655)

To me there is nothing shocking in saying that a dictatorship which clothes itself with a tinsel of legal form can so far depart from the morality of order, from the inner morality of law itself, that it ceases to be a legal system. When a system calling itself law is predicated upon a general disregard by judges of the terms of the laws they purport to enforce, when this system habitually cures its legal irregularities, even the grossest, by retroactive statutes, when it has only to resort to forays of terror in the streets, which no one dares challenge, in order to escape even those scant restraints imposed by the pretence of legality - when all these things have become true of a dictatorship, it is not hard for me, at least, to deny to it the name of law. (p. 660)

Fuller also denied the core claim of legal positivism that there is no necessary connection between law and morality. According to Fuller, certain moral standards, which he calls &quot;principles of legality,&quot; are built into the very concept of law, so that nothing counts as genuine law that fails to meet these standards. In virtue of these principles of legality, the law has an inner morality that imposes a minimal morality of fairness. Some laws, he admits, may be so wicked or unjust that they should not be obeyed. But even in these cases, he argues, there are positive features of the law that impose a defensible moral duty to obey them.

According to Fuller, all purported legal rules must meet eight minimal conditions in order to count as genuine laws. The rules must be (1) sufficiently general, (2) publicly promulgated, (3) prospective (i.e., applicable only to future behavior, not past), (4) at least minimally clear and intelligible, (5) free of contradictions, (6) relatively constant, so that they don&#x27;t continuously change from day to day, (7) possible to obey, and (8) administered in a way that does not wildly diverge from their obvious or apparent meaning. These are Fuller&#x27;s &quot;principles of legality.&quot; Together, he argues, they guarantee that all law will embody certain moral standards of respect, fairness, and predictability that constitute important aspects of the rule of law.

Fuller presents these issues in &quot;The Morality of Law&quot; with an entertaining story about an imaginary king named Rex who attempts to rule but finds he is unable to do so in any meaningful way when any of these conditions are not met. Fuller contends that the purpose of law is to subject &quot;human conduct to the governance of rules&quot;. If any of the eight principles is flagrantly lacking in a system of governance, the system will not be a legal one. The more closely a system is able to adhere to them, the nearer it will be to the rule-of-law ideal, though in reality all systems must make compromises and will fall short of perfect ideals of clarity, consistency, stability, and so forth.

In a review of &quot;The Morality of Law&quot;, Hart criticises Fuller&#x27;s work, saying that these principles are merely ones of means-ends efficiency; it is inappropriate, he says, to call them a morality. Employing Fuller&#x27;s eight principles of legality, one could just as well have an inner morality of poisoning as an inner morality of law, which Hart claims is absurd. In this phase of the argument, the positions of the disputants are transposed. Fuller proposes principles that would easily fit into a positivistic account of law and Hart points out that Fuller&#x27;s principles could easily accommodate an immoral morality.

Other critics have challenged Fuller&#x27;s claim that there is a &quot;prima facie&quot; obligation to obey all laws. Some laws, it is claimed, are so unjust and oppressive that there is not even a presumptive moral duty to obey them.

In 1954 Fuller proposed the term eunomics to describe &quot;the science, theory or study of good order and workable arrangements&quot;. Stemming from behavioral systems theory, it was an attempt to fuse what Fuller saw as the inherent morality of law with the empirical data and methods of the objective sciences. Its main practical application appears to be as a form of industrial dispute resolution.

<text>Gandhi is a 1982 epic biographical film based on the life of Mahatma Gandhi, a major leader in the Indian independence movement against the British Empire during the 20th century. A co-production between India and the United Kingdom, the film was directed and produced by Richard Attenborough from a screenplay written by John Briley. It stars Ben Kingsley in the title role. The biographical film covers Gandhi&#x27;s life from a defining moment in 1893, as he is thrown off a South African train for being in a whites-only compartment and concludes with his assassination and funeral in 1948. Although a practising Hindu, Gandhi&#x27;s embracing of other faiths, particularly Christianity and Islam, is also depicted.

&quot;Gandhi&quot; was released by Columbia Pictures in India on 30 November 1982, in the United Kingdom on 3 December, and in the United States on 8 December. It was praised for providing a historically accurate portrayal of the life of Gandhi, the Indian independence movement and the deleterious results of British colonisation on India. Its production values, costume design, and Kingsley&#x27;s performance received worldwide critical acclaim. It became a commercial success, grossing $127.8 million on a $22 million budget. &quot;Gandhi&quot; received a leading eleven nominations at the 55th Academy Awards, winning eight, including Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Actor (for Kingsley). The British Film Institute ranked it as the 34th greatest British film of the 20th century. The American Film Institute ranked the film 29th on its list of most inspiring movies.

==Plot==
In June 1893 in South Africa, young lawyer Mohandas Gandhi is forcibly expelled from a whites-only train carriage in Pietermaritzburg despite having a first class ticket, subsequently campaigning for Indian equality in South Africa. Dada Abdullah, president of the Natal Indian Congress, notices his campaign and invites him to a demonstration where he burns his pass. The South African Government then attempts to enact a law where Indians will be fingerprinted, akin to criminals. Gandhi responds with numerous peaceful demonstrations against the new law&#x27;s unjust nature, and Jan Smuts, Prime Minister of South Africa, eventually orders his arrest. Later, the Government releases Gandhi and relents by granting some rights to Indians, fulfilling his short-term goal. Anglican clergyman Charles Freer Andrews joins his mission, and Vince Walker, an American journalist from the &quot;New York Times&quot;, takes special interest in him. Gandhi’s work is at his ashram, where many figures associated with him include Andrews, Hermann Kallenbuch, and later Madeleine Slade, whom Gandhi names Mirabehn.

Cordially invited to the Indian National Congress in 1915, Gandhi meets its leaders: Sardar Patel, a young Jawaharlal Nehru, Maulana Azad, and Muhammad Ali Jinnah, who is advocating self rule for India, as well as Gopal Krishna Gokhale, who becomes his mentor. Jinnah supports Gandhi’s involvement in politics, but opposes his unconventional approach. At a meeting of the Congress led by Jinnah, Gandhi&#x27;s speech captivates the ensemble, especially Patel.

Gandhi pledges allegiance to the British Empire in WW1, but simultaneously demands self rule for India. His satyagrahas at Champaran and Kheda are brutally curtailed by the British. Despite Indian involvement in WW1, the administration in India passes the Rowlatt Act, which is seen by the movement as betrayal. While a group of people listen to speeches about freedom, General Reginald Dyer orders his soldiers to fire upon them unawares, committing the Amritsar massacre.

Jinnah suggests non-cooperation for protesting against British rule, and Gandhi surprisingly agrees. Its immediate success causes the Chauri Chaura incident, where protestors kill and burn police officers in the United Provinces. Disgusted, Gandhi orders to call off the non-cooperation movement, enraging Jinnah, before he retreats to his ashram and fasts to call off the masses.

After organizing the Salt March against the British monopoly on salt in India, accompanied by Vince Walker and his associate, Gandhi is then invited to London by Ramsay MacDonald to attend the Round Table conferences regarding future Dominion status for the Indian Empire. However, they prove fruitless and Gandhi and the other Congress leaders are imprisoned during WW2. While under house arrest, Gandhi&#x27;s wife Kasturba dies, and he mourns her.

Dissatisfied by the Congress and Gandhi, Jinnah resigns and returns to the Muslim League, where he begins demands for a separate state to be made out of British India for the Muslim minority. Gandhi is upset, and in 1945, Viceroy Louis Mountbatten declares India&#x27;s upcoming independence as the territory&#x27;s final Governor-General. Gandhi offers Jinnah to be Prime Minister and to choose its first cabinet; Nehru agrees to it to maintain India&#x27;s independence, but Jinnah declines, stating that only independence for Pakistan will ensure Muslim safety, upsetting Patel, Nehru, and Azad.

India gains independence in August 1947, and millions of people cross the borders into the newly-formed countries, but sectarian violence occurs along the new borders between Hindus and Muslims alike. The military attempts to control uprisings in Delhi and Bombay, while in Calcutta murder and violence between Hindus and Muslims rampage through the streets. Devastated, Gandhi holds a fast unto death, causing Hindus to stand down and Huseyn Suhrawardy to call upon Muslims to stop fighting. Gandhi advises a concerned Hindu man, upset about murdering a Muslim infant to avenge his son&#x27;s death in the violence, to find a Muslim boy whose family had died in the violence and raise him as a faithful Muslim.

While heading to prayers on January 30, 1948, Gandhi is shot point blank 3 times by Nathuram Godse and exclaims “Oh, God!” as he perishes. After his funeral, his casket is carted throughout Delhi accompanied by a mourning Nehru, numerous Indians, and international dignitaries. His ashes are poured into the Ganges, and he is mourned by the leaders of the Congress and the Indian independence movement as a whole.

==Cast==
==Production==
This film had been Richard Attenborough&#x27;s dream project, although two previous attempts at filming had failed. In 1952, Gabriel Pascal secured an agreement with the Prime Minister of India (Jawaharlal Nehru) to produce a film of Gandhi&#x27;s life. However, Pascal died in 1954 before preparations were completed.

In 1962 Attenborough was contacted by Motilal Kothari, an Indian-born civil servant working with the Indian High Commission in London and a devout follower of Gandhi. Kothari insisted that Attenborough meet him to discuss a film about Gandhi. Attenborough agreed, after reading Louis Fischer&#x27;s biography of Gandhi and spent the next 18 years attempting to get the film made. He was able to meet prime minister Nehru and his daughter Indira Gandhi through a connection with Lord Louis Mountbatten, the last Viceroy of India. Nehru approved of the film and promised to help support its production, but his death in 1964 was one of the film&#x27;s many setbacks. Attenborough would dedicate the film to the memory of Kothari, Mountbatten, and Nehru.

David Lean and Sam Spiegel had planned to make a film about Gandhi after completing &quot;The Bridge on the River Kwai&quot;, reportedly with Alec Guinness as Gandhi. Ultimately, the project was abandoned in favour of &quot;Lawrence of Arabia&quot; (1962). Attenborough reluctantly approached Lean with his own Gandhi project in the late 1960s, and Lean agreed to direct the film and offered Attenborough the lead role. Instead Lean began filming &quot;Ryan&#x27;s Daughter&quot;, during which time Motilai Kothari had died and the project fell apart.

Attenborough again attempted to resurrect the project in 1976 with backing from Warner Brothers. Then prime minister Indira Gandhi declared a state of emergency in India and shooting would be impossible. Co-producer Rani Dube persuaded prime minister Indira Gandhi to provide the first $10 million from the National Film Development Corporation of India, chaired by D. V. S. Raju at that time, on the back of which the remainder of the funding was finally raised. Finally in 1980 Attenborough was able to secure the remainder of the funding needed to make the film. Screenwriter John Briley had introduced him to Jake Eberts, the chief executive at the new Goldcrest production company that raised approximately two-thirds of the film&#x27;s budget.

Shooting began on 26 November 1980 and ended on 10 May 1981. Some scenes were shot near Koilwar Bridge, in Bihar. Over 300,000 extras were used in the funeral scene, the most for any film, according to &quot;Guinness World Records&quot;.

===Casting===
During pre-production, there was much speculation as to who would play the role of Gandhi. The choice was Ben Kingsley, who is partly of Indian heritage (his father was Gujarati and his birth name is Krishna Bhanji).

==Release==
&quot;Gandhi&quot; premiered in New Delhi, India on 30 November 1982. Two days later, on 2 December, it had a Royal Premiere at the Odeon Leicester Square in London in the presence of Prince Charles and Princess Diana before opening to the public the following day. The film had a limited release in the US starting on Wednesday, 8 December 1982, followed by a wider release in January 1983. In February 1983 it opened on two screens in India as well as opening nationwide in the UK and expanding into other countries.

==Reception==
===Critical response===
Reviews were broadly positive not only in India but also internationally. The film was discussed or reviewed in &quot;Newsweek&quot;, &quot;Time&quot;, the &quot;Washington Post&quot;, &quot;The Public Historian&quot;, &quot;Cross Currents&quot;, &quot;The Journal of Asian Studies&quot;, &quot;Film Quarterly&quot;, &quot;The Progressive&quot;, &quot;The Christian Century&quot; and elsewhere. Ben Kingsley&#x27;s performance was especially praised. Among the few who took a more negative view of the film, historian Lawrence James called it &quot;pure hagiography&quot; while anthropologist Akhil Gupta said it &quot;suffers from tepid direction and a superficial and misleading interpretation of history.&quot; Also Indian novelist Makarand R. Paranjape has written that &quot;&quot;Gandhi&quot;, though hagiographical, follow a mimetic style of film-making in which cinema, the visual image itself, is supposed to portray or reflect &#x27;reality&#x27;&quot;. The film was also criticised by some right-wing commentators who objected to the film&#x27;s advocacy of nonviolence, including Pat Buchanan, Emmett Tyrrell and Richard Grenier. In &quot;Time&quot;, Richard Schickel wrote that in portraying Gandhi&#x27;s &quot;spiritual presence... Kingsley is nothing short of astonishing.&quot; A &quot;singular virtue&quot; of the film is that &quot;its title figure is also a character in the usual dramatic sense of the term.&quot; Schickel viewed Attenborough&#x27;s directorial style as having &quot;a conventional handsomeness that is more predictable than enlivening,&quot; but this &quot;stylistic self-denial serves to keep one&#x27;s attention fastened where it belongs: on a persuasive, if perhaps debatable vision of Gandhi&#x27;s spirit, and on the remarkable actor who has caught its light in all its seasons.&quot; Roger Ebert gave the film four stars and called it a &quot;remarkable experience&quot;, and placed it fifth on his 10 best films of 1983.

In &quot;Newsweek&quot;, Jack Kroll stated that &quot;There are very few movies that absolutely must be seen. Sir Richard Attenborough&#x27;s &quot;Gandhi&quot; is one of them.&quot; The movie &quot;deals with a subject of great importance... with a mixture of high intelligence and immediate emotional impact... [and] Ben Kingsley... gives what is possibly the most astonishing biographical performance in screen history.&quot; Kroll stated that the screenplay&#x27;s &quot;least persuasive characters are Gandhi&#x27;s Western allies and acolytes&quot; such as an English cleric and an American journalist, but that &quot;Attenborough&#x27;s &#x27;old-fashioned&#x27; style is exactly right for the no-tricks, no-phony-psychologizing quality he wants.&quot; Furthermore, Attenborough

mounts a powerful challenge to his audience by presenting Gandhi as the most profound and effective of revolutionaries, creating out of a fierce personal discipline a chain reaction that led to tremendous historical consequences. At a time of deep political unrest, economic dislocation and nuclear anxiety, seeing &quot;Gandhi&quot; is an experience that will change many minds and hearts.
According to the Museum of Broadcast Communications there was &quot;a cycle of film and television productions which emerged during the first half of the 1980s, which seemed to indicate Britain&#x27;s growing preoccupation with India, Empire and a particular aspect of British cultural history&quot;. In addition to &quot;Gandhi,&quot; this cycle also included &quot;Heat and Dust&quot; (1983), &quot;Octopussy&quot; (1983), &quot;The Jewel in the Crown&quot; (1984), &quot;The Far Pavilions&quot; (1984) and &quot;A Passage to India&quot; (1984).

Patrick French negatively reviewed the film, writing in &quot;The Telegraph&quot;:
An important origin of one myth about Gandhi was Richard Attenborough&#x27;s 1982 film. Take the episode when the newly arrived Gandhi is ejected from a first-class railway carriage at Pietermaritzburg after a white passenger objects to sharing space with a &quot;coolie&quot; (an Indian indentured labourer). In fact, Gandhi&#x27;s demand to be allowed to travel first-class was accepted by the railway company. Rather than marking the start of a campaign against racial oppression, as legend has it, this episode was the start of a campaign to extend racial segregation in South Africa. Gandhi was adamant that &quot;respectable Indians&quot; should not be obliged to use the same facilities as &quot;raw Kaffirs&quot;. He petitioned the authorities in the port city of Durban, where he practised law, to end the indignity of making Indians use the same entrance to the post office as blacks, and counted it a victory when three doors were introduced: one for Europeans, one for Asiatics and one for Natives.

Richard Grenier in his 1983 article, &quot;The Gandhi Nobody Knows&quot;, which was also the title of the book of the same name and topic, also criticized the film, arguing it misportrayed him as a &quot;saint&quot;. He also alleged the Indian government admitted to financing about a third of the film&#x27;s budget. He also criticized the film&#x27;s portrayal of Muhammed Ali Jinnah, although he does not elaborate much on this criticism. Grenier&#x27;s book later became an inspiration for G. B. Singh&#x27;s book &quot;&quot;. Parts of the book also discuss the film negatively.

One notable person, Mark Boyle (better known as &quot;The Moneyless Man&quot;) has stated that watching the film was the moment that changed his life and said that after that, he took Mahatma Gandhi&#x27;s message of peace and non-violence to heart and that the film inspired him to become an activist.

Review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes retrospectively collected 111 reviews and judged 89% of them to be positive, with an average rating of 8.30/10. The website&#x27;s critical consensus reads: &quot;Director Richard Attenborough is typically sympathetic and sure-handed, but it&#x27;s Ben Kingsley&#x27;s magnetic performance that acts as the linchpin for this sprawling, lengthy biopic.&quot; Metacritic gave the film a score of 79 out of 100 based on 16 critical reviews, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;. CinemaScore reported that audiences gave the film a rare &quot;A+&quot; grade. In 2010, the &quot;Independent Film &amp; Television Alliance&quot; selected the film as one of the 30 Most Significant Independent Films of the last 30 years.

The film was included by the Vatican in a list of important films compiled in 1995, under the category of &quot;Values&quot;.

===Box office===
The film grossed $81,917 in its first 6 days at the Odeon Leicester Square in London. In the United States and Canada, it grossed $183,583 in its first 5 days from 4 theatres (Ziegfeld Theatre in New York City; Uptown Theater in Washington D.C.; Century Plaza in Los Angeles; and the York in Toronto). Due to the running time, it could be shown only three times a day. It went on to gross in the United States and Canada, the 12th highest-grossing film of 1982.

<doc id="369509" wikidata="Q5148106" url="?curid=369509" title="Colonel Charles Pinckney">
<text>Charles Pinckney (March 7, 1732 - September 22, 1782), also known as Colonel Charles Pinckney, was a South Carolina lawyer and planter based in Charleston, South Carolina. Commissioned as a colonel for the Charles Towne Militia in the colonial era, he was widely known as &quot;Colonel Pinckney&quot;. He had a rice and indigo plantation known as Snee Farm along the Wando River, about nine miles from Charleston, and a townhouse on Queen Street in the city.

Captured by the British in 1780 in the fall of Charleston, Pinckney was among more than 160 men who signed loyalty oaths to protect their properties, which the British would otherwise have confiscated and possibly destroyed. After the war, to penalize his Loyalist oath, the state legislature assessed a fine against Pinckney based on the value of his property.

His son and namesake Charles Pinckney inherited the plantation and slaves and became a prominent politician after the American Revolution. After participating in the constitutional convention, he was elected to three non-consecutive terms as governor of the state, and as a US Senator and US Representative.

==Early life==

Pinckney was born to William Pinckney and Ruth Brewton in 1732 in Charleston. He was educated and grew up in a planter family. His grandfather, Thomas Pinckney immigrated at the age of 17 to Yorktown in 1698 from Shropshire and worked as a baker&#x27;s assistant. His father served as Master of Chancery. William had joined his older brother, Charles Pinckney, in setting up &quot;the first fire insurance company in America, the Friendly Society.&quot; 

It was profitable, but an extensive fire in 1740 in Charleston resulted in high damages, and William suffered financially. He sent his son to be cared and educated by his wealthier brother Charles. The younger Charles Pinckney studied law, passing the bar in 1752.

==Career==
Pinckney became a leading attorney in the city of Charleston. He bought his first plantation, now known as Snee Farm, in 1754, as a mark of his early success. The 715-acre plantation was used to produce the commodity crops of rice and indigo.

He also became a public figure, serving as colonel and commanding officer of the Charles Towne Militia, after which he became widely known as &quot;Colonel Pinckney&quot;. He was elected as a member of the General Assembly, the lower house of provincial government in South Carolina. In 1775, he was elected as president of the South Carolina Provincial Congress.

During the American Revolutionary War, Colonel Pinckney was among many persons captured by the British during the fall of Charleston in 1780. South Carolina Governor John Rutledge had left the city, intending to carry on a state government in exile in North Carolina. Colonel Pinckney was among more than 160 men in Charleston who took a loyalty oath to the British in order to keep their properties; the British hoped these influential men would help them lead the city.

Pinckney&#x27;s action as a Loyalist was extremely unpopular among the revolutionary forces. After the war, in February 1782, the South Carolina legislature voted a 12% amercement, or fine, against Colonel Pinckney&#x27;s property to punish him for his switch of allegiance.

On his death in 1782, Pinckney left the Snee Farm plantation and its slaves to Charles, his oldest surviving son. There were 40 slaves recorded in the probate record. Colonel Charles Pinckney was buried at St. Philip&#x27;s Church in Charleston.

==Marriage and family==
Pinckney had married his first cousin, Frances Brewton (b. June 11, 1733). She was a daughter of his uncle Robert Brewton, a goldsmith who was associated with banking and financial circles in the city, and Mary Loughton, a widow.

Frances&#x27;s siblings included an older brother Miles Brewton (1731-1775) (named after his paternal grandfather) and younger sister Rebecca Brewton (1737-1815) (named after her paternal aunt). Before the Revolutionary War, Miles had become wealthy, based largely on his success as a slave trader and merchant in Charleston. Their sister Rebecca married Jacob Motte, also a planter, who had a townhouse in Charleston. After Miles and all his family were lost at sea in August 1775 on their way to Philadelphia, where he was to serve as a delegate to the Second Continental Congress, Frances and her sister Rebecca jointly inherited Miles&#x27;s mansion in Charleston, which is now known as Miles Brewton House.

The Pinckneys had several children, Charles (his namesake), Thomas (named after Pinckney&#x27;s paternal grandfather), Miles Brewton (named after Frances&#x27;s brother), Mary, and Rebecca Pinckney.

In 1782, the younger Charles Pinckney inherited Snee Farm, the rice and indigo plantation, and its numerous enslaved African Americans at his father&#x27;s death. A monument originally intended for his father&#x27;s grave was moved to Snee Farm because his age was carved incorrectly. The younger Pinckney became a leading politician after the Revolutionary War. He served in numerous offices, including being elected as governor of South Carolina to three non-consecutive terms.

<text>Streetlife Serenade is the third studio album by American recording artist Billy Joel, released on October 11, 1974, by Columbia Records. 

The album peaked at No. 35 on the US album charts, eventually selling more than one million copies. Joel&#x27;s live shows in the 1970s frequently featured the instrumental &quot;Root Beer Rag&quot; and the short song &quot;Souvenir&quot;, which was often used as the final encore. Live versions of &quot;Streetlife Serenader&quot; and &quot;Los Angelenos&quot; appeared on Joel&#x27;s first live album, &quot;Songs in the Attic&quot; (1981). A live version of &quot;The Entertainer&quot; appeared on Joel&#x27;s 2006 album &quot;12 Gardens Live&quot;.

==Background==
It was recorded mostly with session musicians—the last such release until 1993&#x27;s &quot;River of Dreams.&quot; Joel sang and played piano and other keyboards, including his first work with the Moog synthesizer. Backing musicians included guitarists Don Evans and Al Hertzberg and banjo/pedal steel guitarist Tom Whitehorse. 

Joel said that he had been touring in clubs and theatres and opening for big acts such as The Beach Boys, thus leaving him little time to write new songs, but he was under pressure to put out a new album after &quot;Piano Man&quot;. He also says that he did not have many new songs, hence the inclusion of the instrumentals &quot;Root Beer Rag&quot; and &quot;The Mexican Connection&quot;. The back cover features a barefooted Joel sitting in a chair looking cross; Joel says that he had had his wisdom teeth extracted two days before the shoot. The front cover is a painting by Brian Hagiwara of a hotel and café located at 651 South Centre Street in Los Angeles, California.

In a retrospective interview, Joel said of the album: &quot;Interesting musical ideas, but nothing to say lyrically. I was trying to be Debussy in the title track — it didn’t work.&quot;

==Release history==
In addition to the usual two-channel stereo version, the album was also released by Columbia in a four-channel quadraphonic mix on LP record and 8-track tape in 1974. The quad LP release was encoded in the SQ matrix system. In 2015, the album was re-issued by Audio Fidelity in the Super Audio CD format containing both the complete stereo and quadraphonic mixes.

<doc id="369526" wikidata="Q2289211" url="?curid=369526" title="Single-wire earth return">
<text>Single-wire earth return (SWER) or single-wire ground return is a single-wire transmission line which supplies single-phase electric power from an electrical grid to remote areas at lowest cost. The earth (or sometimes a body of water) is used as the return path for the current, to avoid the need for a second wire (or &quot;neutral wire&quot;) to act as a return path.

Single-wire earth return is principally used for rural electrification, but also finds use for larger isolated loads such as water pumps. It is also used for high-voltage direct current over submarine power cables. Electric single-phase railway traction, such as light rail, uses a very similar system. It uses resistors to earth to reduce hazards from rail voltages, but the primary return currents are through the rails.

== History ==
Lloyd Mandeno, OBE (1888–1973) fully developed SWER in New Zealand around 1925 for rural electrification. Although he termed it &quot;Earth Working Single Wire Line&quot;, it was often called &quot;Mandeno’s Clothesline&quot;. More than 200,000 kilometres (100,000 miles) have now been installed in Australia and New Zealand. It is considered safe, reliable and low-cost, provided that safety features and earthing are correctly installed. The Australian standards are widely used and cited. It has been applied around the world, such as in the Canadian province of Saskatchewan; Brazil; Africa; and portions of the United States&#x27; Upper Midwest and Alaska (Bethel).

== Operating principle ==
SWER is a viable choice for a distribution system when conventional return current wiring would cost more than SWER&#x27;s isolation transformers and small power losses. Power engineers experienced with both SWER and conventional power lines rate SWER as equally safe, more reliable, less costly, but with slightly lower efficiency than conventional lines. SWER can cause fires when maintenance is poor, and bushfire is a risk.
Power is supplied to the SWER line by an isolating transformer of up to 300 kVA. This transformer isolates the grid from ground or earth. The voltage changes due to the transition from line-to-line to line-to-earth, typically reducing a 22 kV grid to 12.7 kV SWER or a 33 kV grid to 19.1 kV SWER.

The SWER line is a single conductor that may stretch for tens or even hundreds of kilometres, with a number of distribution transformers along its length. At each transformer, such as a customer&#x27;s premises, current flows from the line, through the primary coil of a step-down isolation transformer, to earth through an earth stake. From the earth stake, the current eventually finds its way back to the main step-up transformer at the head of the line, completing the circuit. SWER is therefore a practical example of a phantom loop.

In areas with higher-resistance soil, the grounding rod can float to higher voltages, wasting energy. The resistance may be high enough to affect self-resetting circuit breakers, which usually reset due to a difference in voltage between line and neutral. With dry, high-resistance soils, the reduced difference in voltage between line and neutral may prevent breakers from resetting. In Australia, locations with very dry soils need the grounding rods to be extra deep.
Experience in Alaska shows that SWER needs to be grounded below permafrost, which is high-resistance.

The secondary winding of the local transformer will supply the customer with either single ended single phase (N-0) or split-phase (N-0-N) power in the region&#x27;s standard appliance voltages, with the 0 volt line connected to a safety earth that does not normally carry an operating current.

A large SWER line may feed as many as 80 distribution transformers. The transformers are usually rated at 5 kVA, 10 kVA, and 25 kVA. The load densities are usually below 0.5 kVA per kilometer (0.8 kVA per mile) of line. Any single customer&#x27;s maximum demand will typically be less than 3.5 kVA, but larger loads up to the capacity of the distribution transformer can also be supplied.

Some SWER systems in the USA are conventional distribution feeders that were built without a continuous neutral (some of which were obsolete transmission lines that were refitted for rural distribution service). The substation feeding such lines has a grounding rod on each pole within the substation; then on each branch from the line, the span between the pole next to and the pole carrying the transformer would have a grounded conductor (giving each transformer two grounding points for safety reasons).

== Mechanical design ==
Proper mechanical design of a SWER line can lower its lifetime cost and increase its safety.

Since the line is high voltage, with small currents, the conductor used in historic SWER lines was Number-8 galvanized steel fence wire. More modern installations use specially-designed AS1222.1 high-carbon steel, aluminum-clad wires. Aluminum clad wires corrode in coastal areas, but are otherwise more suitable. Because of the long spans and high mechanical tensions, vibration from wind can cause damage to the wires. Modern systems install spiral vibration dampers on the wires.

Insulators are often porcelain because polymers are prone to ultraviolet damage. Some utilities install higher-voltage insulators so the line can be easily upgraded to carry more power. For example, 12 kV lines may be insulated to 22 kV, or 19 kV lines to 33 kV.

Reinforced concrete poles have been traditionally used in SWER lines because of their low cost, low maintenance, and resistance to water damage, termites and fungi. Local labor can produce them in most areas, further lowering costs. In New Zealand, metal poles are common (often being former rails from a railway line). Wooden poles are acceptable. In Mozambique, poles had to be at least high to permit safe passage of giraffes beneath the lines.

If an area is prone to lightning, modern designs place lightning ground straps in the poles when they are constructed, before erection. The straps and wiring can be arranged to be a low-cost lightning arrestor with rounded edges to avoid attracting a lightning strike.

== Characteristics ==
=== Safety ===
SWER is promoted as safe due to isolation of the ground from both the generator and user. Most other electrical systems use a metallic neutral connected directly to the generator or a shared ground.

Grounding is critical. Significant currents on the order of 8 amperes flow through the ground near the earth points. A good-quality earth connection is needed to prevent risk of electric shock due to earth potential rise near this point. Separate grounds for power and safety are also used. Duplication of the ground points assures that the system is still safe if either of the grounds is damaged.

A good earth connection is normally a 6 m stake of copper-clad steel driven vertically into the ground, and bonded to the transformer earth and tank. A good ground resistance is 5–10 ohms which can be measured using specialist earth test equipment. SWER systems are designed to limit the electric field in the earth to 20 volts per meter to avoid shocking people and animals that might be in the area.

Other standard features include automatic reclosing circuit breakers (reclosers). Most faults (overcurrent) are transient. Since the network is rural, most of these faults will be cleared by the recloser. Each service site needs a rewirable drop out fuse for protection and switching of the transformer. The transformer secondary should also be protected by a standard high-rupture capacity (HRC) fuse or low voltage circuit breaker. A surge arrestor (spark gap) on the high voltage side is common, especially in lightning-prone areas.

Most fire safety hazards in electrical distribution are from aging equipment: corroded lines, broken insulators, etc. The lower cost of SWER maintenance can reduce the cost of safe operation in these cases.

SWER avoids lines clashing in wind, a substantial fire-safety feature, but a problem surfaced in the official investigation into the Black Saturday bushfires in Victoria, Australia. These demonstrated that a broken SWER conductor can short to ground across a resistance similar to the circuit&#x27;s normal load; in that particular case, a tree. This can cause large currents without a ground-fault indication. This can present a danger in fire-prone areas where a conductor may snap and current may arc through trees or dry grass.

Bare-wire or ground-return telecommunications can be compromised by the ground-return current if the grounding area is closer than 100 m or sinks more than 10 A of current. Modern radio, optic fibre channels, and cell phone systems are unaffected.

Many national electrical regulations (notably the U.S.) require a metallic return line from the load to the generator. In these jurisdictions, each SWER line must be approved by exception.

=== Cost advantages ===
SWER&#x27;s main advantage is its low cost. It is often used in sparsely populated areas where the cost of building an isolated distribution line cannot be justified. Capital costs are roughly 50% of an equivalent two-wire single-phase line. They can cost 30% of 3-wire three-phase systems. Maintenance costs are roughly 50% of an equivalent three phase line.

SWER also reduces the largest cost of a distribution network: the number of poles. Conventional 2-wire or 3-wire distribution lines have a higher power transfer capacity, but can require 7 poles per kilometre (12 poles per mile), with spans of 100 to 150 metres (110 to 160 yards). SWER&#x27;s high line voltage and low current also permits the use of low-cost galvanized steel wire (historically, No. 8 fence wire). Steel&#x27;s greater strength permits spans of 400 metres (¼ mile) or more, reducing the number of poles to 2.5 per kilometre (4 per mile).

If the poles also carry optical fiber cable for telecommunications (metal conductors may not be used), capital expenditures by the power company may be further reduced.

=== Reliability ===
SWER can be used in a grid or loop, but is usually arranged in a linear or radial layout to save costs. In the customary linear form, a single-point failure in a SWER line causes all customers further down the line to lose power. However, since it has fewer components in the field, SWER has less to fail. For example, since there is only one line, winds can&#x27;t cause lines to clash, removing a source of damage, as well as a source of rural bush fires.

Since the bulk of the transmission line has low resistance attachments to earth, excessive ground currents from shorts and geomagnetic storms are more rare than in conventional metallic-return systems. So, SWER has fewer ground-fault circuit-breaker openings to interrupt service.

=== Upgradeability ===
A well-designed SWER line can be substantially upgraded as demand grows without new poles. The first step may be to replace the steel wire with more expensive copper-clad or aluminum-clad steel wire.

It may be possible to increase the voltage. Some distant SWER lines now operate at voltages as high as 35 kV. Normally this requires changing the insulators and transformers, but no new poles are needed.

If more capacity is needed, a second SWER line can be run on the same poles to provide two SWER lines 180 degrees out of phase. This requires more insulators and wire, but doubles the power without doubling the poles. Many standard SWER poles have several bolt holes to support this upgrade. This configuration causes most ground currents to cancel, reducing shock hazards and interference with communication lines.

Two-phase service is also possible with a two-wire upgrade: Though less reliable, it is more efficient. As more power is needed, the lines can be upgraded to match the load, from single wire SWER to two wire, single phase and finally to three wire, three phase. This ensures a more efficient use of capital and makes the initial installation more affordable.

Customer equipment installed before these upgrades will all be single phase, and can be reused after the upgrade. If small amounts of three-phase power are needed, it can be economically synthesized from two-phase power with on-site equipment.

=== Power-quality weakness ===
SWER lines tend to be long, with high impedance, so the voltage drop along the line is often a problem, causing poor regulation. Variations in demand cause variation in the delivered voltage. To combat this, some installations have automatic variable transformers at the customer site to keep the received voltage within legal specifications.

After some years of experience, the inventor advocated a capacitor in series with the ground of the main isolation transformer to counteract the inductive reactance of the transformers, wire and earth return path. The plan was to improve the power factor, reduce losses and improve voltage performance due to reactive power flow. Though theoretically sound, this is not standard practice. It does also allow the use of a DC test loop, to distinguish a legitimate variable load from (for example) a fallen tree, which would be a DC path to ground.

== Use ==
Single-wire earth return is used throughout the globe, most commonly in New Zealand and Australia.

== Colombia ==

SWER systems are forbidden for national electric regulation RETIE (REGLAMENTO DE INSTALACIONES ELECTRICAS).

== United States == 

=== Alaska ===
In 1981 a high-power 8.5 mile prototype SWER line was successfully installed from a diesel plant in Bethel to Napakiak in Alaska, United States. It operates at 80 kV, and was originally installed on special lightweight fiberglass poles that formed an A-frame. Since then, the A frames have been removed and standard wooden power poles were installed. The A-framed poles could be carried on lightweight snow machines, and could be installed with hand tools on permafrost without extensive digging. Erection of &quot;anchoring&quot; poles still required heavy machinery, but the cost savings were dramatic.

Researchers at the University of Alaska Fairbanks, United States estimate that a network of such lines, combined with coastal wind turbines, could substantially reduce rural Alaska&#x27;s dependence on increasingly expensive diesel fuel for power generation. Alaska&#x27;s state economic energy screening survey advocated further study of this option to use more of the state&#x27;s underutilized power sources.

=== In developing nations ===
At present, certain developing nations have adopted SWER systems as their mains electricity systems, notably Laos, South Africa and Mozambique. SWER is also used extensively in Brazil.

=== In HVDC systems ===
Many high-voltage direct current systems (HVDC) using submarine power cables are single wire earth return systems. Bipolar systems with both positive and negative cables may also retain a seawater grounding electrode, used when one pole has failed. To avoid electrochemical corrosion, the ground electrodes of such systems are situated apart from the converter stations and not near the transmission cable.

The electrodes can be situated in the sea or on land. Bare copper wires can be used for cathodes, and graphite rods buried in the ground, or titanium grids in the sea are used for anodes. To avoid electrochemical corrosion (and passivation of titanium surfaces) the current density at the surface of the electrodes must be small, and therefore large electrodes are required.

Examples of HVDC systems with single wire earth return include the Baltic Cable and Kontek.

<doc id="369573" wikidata="Q1069148" url="?curid=369573" title="Chelsea Physic Garden">
<text>The Chelsea Physic Garden was established as the Apothecaries&#x27; Garden in London, England, in 1673 by the Worshipful Society of Apothecaries to grow plants to be used as medicines. This four acre physic garden, the term here referring to the science of healing, is among the oldest botanical gardens in Britain, after the University of Oxford Botanic Garden. Its rock garden is the oldest in Europe devoted to alpine plants and Mediterranean plants. The garden has high brick walls which trap heat, giving it a warm micro-climate, and it claims the largest fruiting olive tree in Britain and the world&#x27;s northernmost grapefruit growing outdoors. Jealously guarded during the tenure of the Worshipful Society of Apothecaries, the garden became a registered charity in 1983 and was opened to the general public for the first time.

The garden is a member of the London Museums of Health &amp; Medicine. It is also Grade I listed in the Register of Historic Parks and Gardens of Special Historic Interest in England by English Heritage.

==History==


The Worshipful Society of Apothecaries initially established the garden on a leased site of Sir John Danvers&#x27; well-established garden in Chelsea, London. This house, called Danvers House, adjoined the mansion that had once been the house of Sir Thomas More. Danvers House was pulled down in 1696 to make room for Danvers Street.

In 1713, Sir Hans Sloane purchased from Charles Cheyne the adjacent Manor of Chelsea, about , which he leased in 1722 to the Society of Apothecaries for £5 a year in perpetuity, requiring in the Deed of Conveyance that the garden supply the Royal Society, of which he was a principal, with 50 good herbarium samples per year, up to a total of 2,000 plants.

That initiated the golden age of the Chelsea Physic Garden under the direction of Philip Miller (1722–1770), when it became the world&#x27;s most richly stocked botanic garden. Its seed-exchange programme was established following a visit in 1682 from Paul Hermann, a Dutch botanist connected with the Hortus Botanicus Leiden and has lasted until the present day. The seed exchange programme&#x27;s most notable act may have been the introduction of cotton into the colony of Georgia and more recently, the worldwide spread of the Madagascar periwinkle (&quot;Catharanthus roseus&quot;).

Isaac Rand, a member and a fellow of the Royal Society, published a condensed catalogue of the garden in 1730, &quot;Index plantarum officinalium, quas ad materiae medicae scientiam promovendam, in horto Chelseiano.&quot; Elizabeth Blackwell&#x27;s &quot;A Curious Herbal&quot; (1737–1739) was illustrated partly from specimens taken from the Chelsea Physic Garden. In 1781, the collection of specimens was donated by the Royal Society to the British Museum in Bloomsbury, then moved in 1881 to the Department of Botany of the British Museum in Kensington, now the Natural History Museum.

Sir Joseph Banks worked with the head gardener and curator John Fairbairn during the 1780–1814 period. Fairbairn specialized in growing and cultivating plants from around the world.

Parts of the garden have been lost to road development – the river bank during 1874 construction of the Chelsea Embankment on the north bank of the River Thames, and a strip of the garden to allow widening of Royal Hospital Road. What remains is a patch in the heart of London.

The Trustees of the London Parochial Charities took over management of the garden in 1899 and for the majority of the twentieth century, it was used for scientific research and was not open to the public. In 1983, the garden became a charity and was run by a private board of trustees, and a few years later in 1987, it was open to the general public for the first time.

In 2001 the then director Rosie Atkins led changes that improved the educational role of the garden.

As of 2025, the co-chair of the trust that manages the Garden are Anna Jobson and Andrew Woodward. Since 2014, the garden director is Sue Medway MBE. 

==Current garden==
As of October 2017, the garden included 5,000 plants, in areas such as:
*The Garden of Medicinal Plants
*The Pharmaceutical Garden, with plants arranged according to the ailment they are used to treat
*The Garden of World Medicine, with medicinal plants arranged by the culture which uses them
*The Garden of Edible and Useful Plants
*The World Woodland Garden

<text>Frank Gelett Burgess (January 30, 1866 – September 18, 1951) was an American artist, art critic, poet, author and humorist. 

He was an important figure in the San Francisco Bay Area literary renaissance of the 1890s, particularly through his iconoclastic little magazine, &quot;The Lark&quot;, and association with &quot;The Crowd&quot; literary group. He is best known as a writer of nonsense verse, such as &quot;The Purple Cow,&quot; and for introducing French modern art to the United States in an essay titled &quot;The Wild Men of Paris.&quot; He was the illustrator of the Goops murals, in Coppa&#x27;s restaurant, in the Montgomery Block and author of the popular Goops books. Burgess coined the term &quot;blurb.&quot;

== Early life ==
Born in Boston, Burgess was &quot;raised among staid, conservative New England gentry&quot;. He attended the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, graduating with a B.S. in 1887. After graduation, Burgess fled conservative Boston for the livelier bohemia of San Francisco, where he worked as a draftsman for the Southern Pacific Railroad. In 1891, he was hired by the University of California at Berkeley as an instructor of topographical drawing.

== Cogswell fountain incident ==
In 1894, Burgess lost his job at Berkeley as a result of his involvement in an attack on one of San Francisco&#x27;s three Cogswell fountains, free water fountains named after the pro-temperance advocate Henry Cogswell who had donated them to the city in 1883. As &quot;The San Francisco Call&quot; noted a year before the incident, Cogswell&#x27;s message, combined with his enormous image, irritated many:

It is supposed to convey a lesson on temperance, as the doctor stands proudly on the pedestal, with his whiskers flung to the rippling breezes. In his right hand he holds a temperance pledge rolled up like a sausage, and the other used to contain a goblet overflowing with heaven&#x27;s own nectar. But wicked boys shattered the emblem of teetotalism with their pea-shooters and now the doctor&#x27;s heart is heavy within him.

In response, numerous acts of minor vandalism had been inflicted upon the fountain.

Four iron posts with ornate lamps at the top originally graced the corners of this gurgling example of temperance, but now they lean and lurch and pitch like a drunken quadrille. Beer wagons heavy laden humped into the posts, shattered the stained-glass lamps and destroyed their equilibrium. Some of the lamps are canted over like a tipsy man&#x27;s hat, and the whole group presents a most convivial aspect.

The toppling incident took place in the early hours of January 1, 1894. As the &quot;Call&quot; reported,

Some iconoclastic spirits, probably made bold by too freely indulging in the convivialities of New Year&#x27;s day, found vent for their destructive proclivities in the small hours of the morning yesterday. With the greatest deliberation, apparently, a rope was coiled around the mock presentment of Dr. Cogswell and with a strong pull, and all together, he was toppled from his fountain pedestal at the Junction of California and Market streets.

The newspaper noted that &quot;no one professes to have knowledge of the perpetrators of the outrage,&quot; and no arrests had been, or were, made. However, Burgess&#x27;s involvement was suspected and is generally viewed as the reason for his resignation from the university, reported by the &quot;Call&quot; on March 10, 1894, with the note that the resignation was &quot;to take effect with the close of the year.&quot;

Burgess is now held in high regard at the University of California, Berkeley as a former professor and literary talent. A selection of his original works and his papers are housed in the Bancroft Library on the Berkeley campus.

== &quot;The Lark&quot; and its descendants ==
Burgess&#x27;s departure from the university became an opportunity to reconsider his professional aspirations. With a group of like-minded associates, he founded in 1895 a humorous little magazine entitled &quot;The Lark&quot;. &quot;The double meaning of its name was intended. While it would sing at heaven&#x27;s gate, it would do so as a merry adventure and have fun with the little-magazine movement.&quot;

&quot;The Lark&quot; was more successful than its makers intended, eventually reaching a circulation of over 3,000. Before the official publication date, local publisher/bookseller William Doxey, intrigued by the first number, agreed to act as official publisher of the venture. Volume 1, number 1 of the 16-page monthly appeared on May Day: May 1, 1895.

&lt;poem&gt;I never saw a purple cow
I never hope to see one;
But I can tell you, anyhow,
I&#x27;d rather see than be one!&lt;/poem&gt;

&quot;The Purple Cow&quot; (the full title was &quot;The Purple Cow: Reflections on a Mythic Beast Who&#x27;s Quite Remarkable, at Least&quot;), an illustrated four-line poem that appeared in the first number of &quot;The Lark&quot;, was to remain the &quot;ne plus ultra&quot; of nonsense verse that Burgess would spend his life unsuccessfully attempting to surpass.

At first, the magazine was edited and written primarily by Burgess, who took great delight in creating pseudonyms for himself. For example, in volume 1, four of the other &quot;authors&quot; are Burgess writing under different names.

The magazine soon attracted an eclectic group of contributors who hung out at the Montgomery Block building, who became known as &quot;Les Jeunes&quot; (English: &quot;the youth&quot;). Burgess was initially assisted by writer-artist Bruce Porter. These included Porter Garnett (who also took on editorial responsibilities), Carolyn Wells, Willis Polk, Yone Noguchi, and others. Local artists, including Ernest Peixotto, Florence Lundborg and Maynard Dixon, contributed illustrations and cover designs.

Number 24 of &quot;The Lark&quot; (April 1897) was declared to be the last, but a final issue, number 25 entitled &quot;The Epi-Lark&quot;, was published May 1, 1897.

By this point, Burgess had become thoroughly sick of &quot;The Purple Cow&quot;, and wrote the following &quot;Confession: and a Portrait Too, Upon a Background that I Rue&quot; in &quot;The Lark&quot;, number 24 (April 1, 1897).

&lt;poem&gt;Ah, yes, I wrote the &quot;Purple Cow&quot;—
I&#x27;m Sorry, now, I wrote it;
But I can tell you Anyhow
I&#x27;ll Kill you if you Quote it!&lt;/poem&gt;

&quot;Purple Cow&quot; has been used as a brand name.

Subsequently, Burgess and publisher William Doxey recycled Burgess&#x27;s contributions in such productions as &quot;The Purple Cow&quot; (1899) and &quot;The Lark Almanack (1899).

Another &quot;Lark&quot; spinoff, created by Burgess and friends one night in 1896, is &quot;Le Petit Journal des Refusées&quot;. Purporting to be composed of material written by women and rejected by other magazines, &quot;Le Petit Journal des Refusées&quot; was printed on wallpaper and cut to an irregular shape. It was announced with a mock call for submissions in the sixth issue of &quot;The Lark&quot;.

==New York, France, later life==
Burgess moved to New York City, where he wrote several books and articles for magazines including The Smart Set, Collier&#x27;s, and Century. He made several trips to France and was evidently fluent in French. Eventually he returned to California, where he died in Carmel-by-the-Sea in 1951.

In 1919, Rollin Lynde Hartt published an article about Burgess as one of &quot;the funniest men who ever lived,&quot; which appeared in newspapers nationwide.

Burgess married Estelle Loomis at a Unitarian church in New York City in June 1914, and they were honeymooning in France when World War I broke out. A writer in her own right, Estelle Loomis worked on a number of literary projects throughout her marriage with Burgess, the two conferring together on each other&#x27;s work. She was also an actress and a beauty contest winner. She was photographed shortly before their marriage by Arnold Genthe. Burgess and Loomis remained married until her death in 1947; however, she frequently suffered from illness and fatigue. They had no children.

==&quot;The Wild Men of Paris&quot;==
Leading up to 1910, one year before the scandalous group exhibiting that brought &quot;Cubism&quot; to the attention of the general public, Burgess wrote an influential article titled, &quot;The Wild Men of Paris&quot;. This illustrated text introduced Proto-Cubist art in the United States for the first time. It included the first reproduction of Pablo Picasso&#x27;s &quot;Les Demoiselles d&#x27;Avignon&quot;.

Written after his visit to the 1910 Salon des Indépendants—the well-established anti-establishment art exhibition in Paris—the article drew from interviews with Henri Matisse, Pablo Picasso, Georges Braque, André Derain, Othon Friesz, Jean Metzinger, Auguste Herbin and Béla Czóbel. &quot;The Wild Men of Paris&quot; was partly humorous but partly serious.

Burgess wrote of Matisse&#x27;s 1907 painting &quot;Blue Nude (Souvenir de Biskra)&quot; in humorist fashion:

&lt;poem&gt;There were no limits to the audacity and the ugliness of the canvasses. Still-life sketches of round, round apples and yellow, yellow oranges, on square, square tables, seen in impossible perspective; landscapes of squirming trees, with blobs of virgin color gone wrong, fierce greens and coruscating yellows, violent purples, sickening reds and shuddering blues.

But the nudes! They looked like flayed Martians, like pathological charts—hideous old women, patched with gruesome hues, lopsided, with arms like the arms of a Swastika, sprawling on vivid backgrounds, or frozen stiffly upright, glaring through misshapen eyes, with noses or fingers missing. They defied anatomy, physiology, almost geometry itself!&lt;/poem&gt;

==Other literary works==
Burgess&#x27;s completely serious writings include &quot;War the Creator&quot;, an account of a young man he had met in Paris in July 1914, and saw again as a wounded soldier a few months later: &quot;a boy who, in two months, became a man.&quot;

Burgess wrote and illustrated several children&#x27;s books about the habits of strange, baldheaded, idiosyncratic childlike creatures he called the Goops. He created the syndicated comic strip &quot;Goops&quot; in 1924, and worked on it to its end in 1925.

His books &quot;The Maxims of Methuselah&quot; and &quot;The Maxims of Noah&quot; were illustrated by Louis D. Fancher.
== Film adaptations ==

Many of Burgess&#x27;s works were adapted for the screen, beginning with &quot;The Persistent Mr. Prince&quot;, a short film released by Vitagraph in 1914. Two films based on Burgess&#x27;s stories were released in 1917, &quot;The Mysterious Miss Terry&quot; and &quot;The Countess Charming&quot;. Burgess&#x27;s novel &quot;The White Cat&quot; (1907) was adapted into two films, &quot;The Two-Soul Woman&quot; (1918) and &quot;The Untameable&quot; (1923). &quot;A Manhattan Knight&quot; (1920) was adapted from Burgess&#x27;s novel &quot;Find the Woman&quot;. &quot;The Heart Line&quot; (1921) was based on Burgess&#x27;s novel of the same name. &quot;The Caveman&quot; (1926) was adapted from Burgess&#x27;s 1915 play. All of these were silent films.

In the sound film era, Burgess&#x27;s novel &quot;Two O&#x27;Clock Courage&quot; was adapted into the 1936 film &quot;Two in the Dark&quot; and the 1945 movie &quot;Two O&#x27;Clock Courage&quot;.

== Legacy ==
The word &quot;blurb&quot;, meaning a short description of a book, film, or other product written for promotional purposes, was coined by Burgess in 1906, in attributing the dust jacket of his book, &quot;Are You a Bromide?&quot;, to a &quot;Miss Belinda Blurb&quot; depicted &quot;in the act of blurbing&quot;. His definition of &quot;blurb&quot; is &quot;a flamboyant advertisement; an inspired testimonial&quot;.

In that book &quot;Are You a Bromide?&quot; and related essay &quot;The Sulphitic Theory&quot;, Burgess is credited for coining the usage of the word &quot;bromide&quot; as a personification of a sedate, dull person who said boring things. Bromide meant either the boring person himself or the trite statement of that person.

In his blurb for &quot;Are You a Bromide?&quot;, Burgess mentions a popular book titled &quot;Janice Meredith&quot;, which was written by Paul Leicester Ford, and published in 1899 by Dodd Mead. &quot;Janice Meredith&quot; happens to be one of the first books to have a blurb on its dust jacket. It was originally printed with a blue cover, and Burgess&#x27; humorous mention (in 1906) that its cover has &quot;faded to a mauve magenta&quot;, seems to be a suggestion that it is time for a new book.

He also coined the phrase, &quot;Love is only chatter; friends are all that matter.&quot;

The Gelett Burgess Center for Creative Expression was formed in Burgess&#x27;s name in Portland, Oregon, in December 2011 to promote &quot;family-friendly books&quot; to parents and educators. Annually, the Gelett Burgess Children&#x27;s Book Award is given in his honor to the top children&#x27;s books of the year.

Burgess founded the San Francisco Boys&#x27; Club Association, now the Boys &amp; Girls Clubs of San Francisco, in 1891 and became its first president. The club was the first of its kind west of the Mississippi River.

Burgess was a friend of the British writer Oliver Onions, and encouraged Onions to write fiction.

<text>The New York Botanical Garden (NYBG) is a botanical garden at Bronx Park in the Bronx, New York City. Established in 1891, it is located on a site that contains a landscape with over one million living plants; the Enid A. Haupt Conservatory, a greenhouse containing several habitats; and the LuEsther T. Mertz Library, which contains one of the world&#x27;s largest collections of botany-related texts. , over a million people visit the New York Botanical Garden annually.

NYBG is also a major educational institution, teaching visitors about plant science, ecology, and healthful eating through NYBG&#x27;s interactive programming. Nearly 90,000 of the annual visitors are children from underserved neighboring communities. An additional 3,000 are teachers from New York City&#x27;s public school system participating in professional development programs that train them to teach science courses at all grade levels. NYBG operates one of the world&#x27;s largest plant research and conservation programs.

NYBG was established in 1891 and the first structures on the grounds opened at the end of that decade. Since 1967, the garden has been listed as a National Historic Landmark, and several buildings have been designated as official New York City landmarks.

==Mission statement==
==History==

=== Context ===
As early as 1877, ideas had been circulating in New York City to create a botanical garden; funding could not be obtained at the time, although the efforts led to parkland being set aside for future use. By 1888, the Torrey Botanical Society was promoting the construction of a large botanical garden in New York City. The Garden&#x27;s creation followed a fund-raising campaign led by the Torrey Botanical Society and Columbia University botanist Nathaniel Lord Britton and his wife Elizabeth Gertrude Britton, who were inspired to emulate the Royal Botanic Gardens in London.

In 1889, the Torrey Botanical Society&#x27;s members decided to build the botanical garden at Bronx Park in the center of the Bronx, New York City&#x27;s northernmost borough. The Lorillard family owned most of the land at that location. The city had already been given authorization to acquire the land as part of the 1884 New Parks Act, which was intended to preserve lands that would soon become part of New York City. Some of land surrounding the Lorillard estate was acquired by the City of New York as part of Bronx Park in 1888–1889.

=== Establishment ===
By act of the New York State Legislature, the New York Botanical Garden was established on April 28, 1891. The garden occupied part of the grounds of the Lorillard estate and a parcel that was formerly the easternmost portion of the campus of St. John&#x27;s College (now Fordham University); the latter included three graves of the Fordham University Cemetery, which were then relocated. The stated purpose of the act was:

As per the acts of incorporation, a board of directors would manage the NYBG. The board of directors included Columbia College&#x27;s president and professors of biology, chemistry, and geology; the presidents of the Torrey Society, New York City Board of Education, and the Department of Public Parks&#x27; board of commissioners; the Mayor of New York City; and nine other members elected to the board. The legislation would provide within Bronx Park to the NYBG, and enable the board of directors to construct a library and conservatory, if at least $250,000 was raised within five years. If this condition were reached, the city would then issue $0.5 million in bonds. The principal officers of the new corporation set up for the garden were Cornelius Vanderbilt II, Andrew Carnegie and J.P. Morgan, with Nathaniel Lord Britton as the new secretary.

Prominent civic leaders and financiers, including Vanderbilt, Carnegie, and Morgan, agreed to match the City&#x27;s commitment to finance the buildings and improvements. By May 1895, the $250,000 in bonds had been raised but the plans had not been fully confirmed. The Board of Directors then asked landscape architect Calvert Vaux and his partner, Parks Superintendent Samuel Parsons Jr., to consult on site selection. The north end of Bronx Park was decided as the best location for the NYBG. By August 1895, the architects had started a survey on the site. Because the Bronx River and various small tributaries ran through the park, drainage was a major consideration. Though Vaux&#x27;s preliminary layout was approved in October 1895, he died the following month. The topographical survey was completed in March 1896. The master plan was created by a team that included Britton &amp; Parsons, as well as landscape engineer John R. Brinley, landscape gardener Samuel Henshaw, botanist Lucien Marcus Underwood, and architects Robert W. Gibson and Lincoln Pierson (the latter from the firm Lord &amp; Burnham).

The LuEsther T. Mertz Library and Enid A. Haupt Conservatory were among the first structures at the NYBG to open. The Library was built between 1897 and 1900, and the Conservatory was built around the same time, being completed in 1902.

=== 1900s to 1980s ===
For over a century after its opening, the NYBG refused to charge admission. Because of this, as well as insufficient government and private funding, its budget deficit started to increase in the 1950s. After the city cut the NYBG&#x27;s budget in 1970, the garden was forced to remain closed for 3 to 4 days a week, and officials worried that this could eventually lead to permanent closure. In 1974, for the first time in the botanical garden&#x27;s history, officials had to annually petition New York State Legislature for funds. That year, the NYBG announced a major renovation to the conservatory and the addition of a building dedicated to displaying plants in different habitats. The next year, budget cuts related to the 1975 New York City fiscal crisis resulted in the NYBG being closed on weekdays for the first time in its history.

In 1988, the NYBG announced a renovation of its museum building, including the addition of a new annex, which was supposed to open in 1991. By the early 1990s, the NYBG facilities were neglected. The garden did not have enough space in its parking lots to accommodate all its visitors, turning away potential guests. Many areas were neglected, except for the surrounding the conservatory, and a wetland had even been created unintentionally due to a broken sewer. A controversy arose in 1994 when the adjacent Fordham University proposed building a radio tower for its radio station WFUV directly across from the Haupt Conservatory. The dispute continued until 2002, after several years of failed resolutions, when Montefiore Medical Center offered to move WFUV&#x27;s antenna to its own facilities.

=== 1990s to present ===
By the mid-1990s, additions to the NYBG were being undertaken to reverse years of neglect. In 1994 the formerly free garden started charging an admission fee to fund these improvements as well as the continued maintenance of existing facilities. The Everett Children&#x27;s Garden opened in mid-1998. By 2000, the NYBG had requested $300 million for renovations, including a new gift shop and renovation of the greenhouses and roads. A new visitor center and gift shop were announced the following year, which would replace temporary facilities built in 1990. The new main entrance, with a gift shop, bookstore, plaza, restrooms, cafe, and information kiosks, was completed in 2004 at a cost of $21 million. Meanwhile, the addition of the library annex was delayed to 1994, then to 2000. Construction on the annex started in 1998 and it opened in 2002 as the International Plant Science Center.

In 2000, the NYBG began raising money for a $300 million renovation campaign after the city government donated $22 million. The NYBG&#x27;s International Plant Science Center reopened in 2002 following a renovation. Several other projects were completed and programs implemented in the 2000s. In 2004, the Leon Levy Visitor Center opened as the Botanical Garden&#x27;s main entrance. It included the NYBG Shop and the Pine Tree Café. The following year, the Nolen Greenhouses for Living Collections opened with its publicly accessible Bourke-Sullivan Display House. The Plant Research Laboratory was completed in early 2005 and opened the next year at a cost of $23 million. In addition to restoring or redesigning existing gardens and collections, such as the Ladies&#x27; Border (2002), the Benenson Ornamental Conifers (2004), the Peggy Rockefeller Rose Garden (2007), the Thain Family Forest (2011), and the Marjorie G. Rosen Seasonal Walk by Piet Oudolf (2014), the New York Botanical Garden added new gardens and collections to its grounds: the Home Gardening Center (2005), the Maureen K. Chilton Azalea Garden (2011) by landscape architect Shavaun Towers of Towers|Golde LLC, and Native Plant Garden (2013), by landscape architect Sheila Brady of Oehme, van Sweden.

Off-site, the institution opened The New York Botanical Garden Midtown Education Center in Manhattan in 2010. NYBG added a parking garage, the Peter J. Sharp Building, nearby in 2012, along with a Bedford Gate entrance to the Garden. NYBG restored its Lorillard Snuff Mill in 2010 and it was named the Lillian and Amy Goldman Stone Mill. NYBG&#x27;s Humanities Research Institute, supported by The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, was created in 2014 to stimulate public discourse about humankind&#x27;s relationship with nature and the environment. NYBG opened an on-site restaurant, the Hudson Garden Grill, in 2015. It redesigned and reopened its East Gate entrance in 2017. The Edible Academy, an educational facility for teaching children, families, educators, and the general public about vegetable gardening, nutrition awareness, and environmental stewardship, opened in 2018. In February 2020, NYBG announced that it was partnering with Douglaston Development to create affordable apartments on the northwest edge of the garden. In January 2024, the NYBG revealed a major rebranding, developed in partnership with global brand consultancy Wolff Olins. The rebrand included a new logo featuring a bespoke typeface &quot;NY Botanical Gothic&quot;, as well as a new color palette.

== Grounds ==

The Garden contains 50 different gardens and plant collections. There is a serene cascade waterfall, as well as wetlands and a tract of original, never-logged, old-growth New York forest.

Garden highlights include the 1890s-vintage Haupt Conservatory, designed by Lord &amp; Burnham; the Peggy Rockefeller Rose Garden, originally laid out by Beatrix Jones Farrand in 1916; an alpine rock garden, designed and installed by Thomas H. Everett in the 1930s; an Herb Garden, designed by Penelope Hobhouse; and a conifer collection. The NYBG&#x27;s extensive research facilities include a propagation center, 550,000-volume research library, and an herbarium of 7.2 to 7.8 million botanical specimens dating back more than three centuries, among the largest in the world.

=== Specialty gardens and collections ===
At the heart of the Garden is the Thain Family Forest, an old-growth forest. It is the largest existing remnant of the original forest which covered all of New York City before the arrival of European settlers in the 17th century. The forest, which was never logged, contains oaks, American beeches, cherry, birch, tulip and white ash trees, some more than two centuries old.

The forest itself is split by the Bronx River, the only freshwater river in New York City, and this stretch of the river includes a riverine canyon and rapids. Along the shores sits the Stone Mill, previously known as the Lorillard Snuff Mill, built in 1840. Sculptor Charles Tefft created the &quot;Fountain of Life&quot; on the grounds in 1905.

The Ladies&#x27; Border, originally commissioned by the Women&#x27;s Auxiliary Committee in the 1920s, was designed by Ellen Shipman and installed between 1931 and 1933. It consists of a sheltered area measuring across, near the Haupt Conservatory. In 2000, designer Lynden B. Miller created a new plan for the Ladies&#x27; Border. The Jane Watson Irwin Perennial Garden was designed in the 1970s by Dan Kiley and redefined by Miller in the 1980s and again in 2003.

=== Structures ===

==== Research laboratories ====
The Pfizer Plant Research Laboratory, named for Pfizer, is a two-story. research building that opened in 2006. The laboratory studies plant genomics, molecular systematics, plant use in New York City&#x27;s immigrant communities , and the processes through which plants create neurotoxins. The building has nine labs, one of which is a lab with robotic workstations on the second floor. Genomic DNA from many different species is extracted to create a library of the DNA of the world&#x27;s plants. This collection is stored in a DNA storage room with 20 freezers housing millions of specimens, including rare, endangered or extinct species.

==== LuEsther T. Mertz Library ====

Founded in 1899 and named after supporter LuEsther Mertz, the LuEsther T. Mertz Library is located in the northern section of the NYBG. A 2002 &quot;New York Times&quot; article mentioned that the library had 775,000 items and 6.5 million plant specimens in its collection, while a book published in 2014 by the NYBG mentioned that the library had &quot;550,000 physical volumes and 1,800 journal titles&quot;. the Mertz Library still contained one of the world&#x27;s largest collections of botany-related texts. The library is housed in what was formerly known as the NYBG&#x27;s Museum Building or Administration Building, which started construction in 1897 and was completed in 1900. The structure was designed by Robert W. Gibson in the Renaissance Revival style.

==== Enid A. Haupt Conservatory ====

The Enid A. Haupt Conservatory, named after Enid A. Haupt, is a greenhouse near the western end of the NYBG. The conservatory was designed by the major greenhouse company of the late 1890s, Lord and Burnham Co. The design was modeled after the Palm House at the Royal Botanic Garden and Joseph Paxton&#x27;s Crystal Palace in Italian Renaissance style. Groundbreaking took place on January 3, 1899, and the conservatory was completed in 1902 at a cost of $177,000. The building was constructed by John R. Sheehan under contract for the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation. Since the original construction, major renovations took place in 1935, 1950, 1978, and 1993.

The conservatory houses numerous tropical plants and flowers, cacti and other desert plants, and rainforest vegetation. In summer months, the two pools adjacent to the conservatory display many varieties of lotuses and water lilies.

=== William &amp; Lynda Steere Herbarium ===
The William &amp; Lynda Steere Herbarium, in the International Plant Science Center behind the library, is one of the largest herbaria in the world, with approximately 7.9 million specimens. after the French National Museum of Natural History in Paris. Founded in 1891, the herbarium quickly became a repository for many important collections. In 1895 the garden incorporated the herbarium of Columbia College, an acquisition of approximately 600,000 specimens, including the private herbaria of John Torrey and C. F. Meisner. In 1945 the garden incorporated the herbaria of the Columbia College of Pharmacy and Princeton University. The herbarium is named after William Steere (son of William C. Steere) and his wife Lynda, who endowed the herbarium in 2002.

The &quot;Index Herbariorum&quot; code assigned to this botanic garden is NY and it is used when citing housed specimens.

== Programs ==
In 2008, Alfred P. Sloan Foundation granted the NYBG $572,000 to begin a project called TreeBOL, the Tree Barcode of Life. By sampling the DNA from as many as 100,000 different species of trees from around the world, TreeBOL will document the diversity of plant life, and advance the process of plant DNA barcoding.

A staff of 200 trains 42 doctoral students at a time. Since the 1890s, scientists from the NYBG have mounted about 2,000 exploratory missions worldwide to collect plants in the wild.

=== School of Professional Horticulture ===
In 1932, Thomas H. Everett expanded an existing training program into a robust curriculum for developing professional horticulturists. Patterned after diploma programs at the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew and the Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh, the School for Gardeners combined academic studies with hands-on practical experience in a two-year, full-time program. With the exception of a hiatus during and after the Second World War, the School has trained students since then. Now called the School of Professional Horticulture, this fully-accredited program continues to develop horticulturists of the highest caliber for positions in both public and private gardens. After successfully completing the program, students receive The New York Botanical Garden&#x27;s Diploma in Horticulture.

==Exhibitions==
The New York Botanical Garden has mounted public exhibitions throughout its history. In 1992, NYBG began presenting what would eventually be called the Holiday Train Show, an annual exhibition of model trains running through a display of New York landmarks made of natural materials. In 2002, it introduced The Orchid Show, an annual exhibition of orchid displays and designed installations with changing themes. Beginning in 2007, the Garden added an annual fall exhibition of kiku, Japanese chrysanthemums trained to grow in modern and ancient forms. 

The New York Botanical Garden has also presented large-scale, stand-alone exhibitions, including: Sculpture from the Museum of Modern Art at The New York Botanical Garden (2002), Chihuly at The New York Botanical Garden (2006), Darwin&#x27;s Garden: An Evolutionary Adventure (2008), Moore in America: Monumental Sculpture at The New York Botanical Garden (2008–2009), Emily Dickinson&#x27;s Garden: The Poetry of Flowers (2010), Spanish Paradise: Gardens of the Alhambra (2011), Monet&#x27;s Garden (2012), Manolo Valdés: Monumental Sculpture (2012), Frida Kahlo: Art, Garden, Life (2015), Impressionism: American Gardens on Canvas (2016), CHIHULY (2017), Georgia O&#x27;Keeffe: Visions of Hawai&#x27;i (2018), Brazilian Modern: The Living Art of Roberto Burle Marx (2019), KUSAMA: Cosmic Nature (2021), and …things come to thrive…in the shedding…in the molting… by Ebony Patterson.

<text>Turnstiles is the fourth studio album by American singer-songwriter Billy Joel, released May 19, 1976, by Family Productions and Columbia Records. 

==Production==
Joel recorded &quot;Turnstiles&quot; in part as a celebration of his return to his native New York City. Three of the album&#x27;s tracks reference New York: &quot;Summer, Highland Falls&quot;, &quot;New York State of Mind&quot; and &quot;Miami 2017 (Seen the Lights Go Out on Broadway)&quot;. It begins with &quot;Say Goodbye to Hollywood&quot; (inspired by The Ronettes song &quot;Be My Baby&quot;) and also includes &quot;I&#x27;ve Loved These Days&quot;, a tongue-in-cheek expression of regret at leaving behind Hollywood decadence. In an interview, Joel stated that the lyrics to the song &quot;James&quot; referred to various different people he knew in real life, with the title character being a &quot;composite&quot; of those people. In the song &quot;Prelude/Angry Young Man&quot;, Joel opens and closes the song rapidly hammering the piano, which was meant to simulate the drum part in the song &quot;Wipe Out&quot; by The Surfaris.

The songs were first recorded at Caribou Ranch (near Nederland, Colorado), with members of Elton John&#x27;s band (Nigel Olsson on drums and Dee Murray on bass) and produced by Chicago producer James William Guercio. Dissatisfied with the results, Joel took over as producer and returned to New York, where he re-recorded the album from start to finish, with his own touring band, which consisted of Long Island musicians Richie Cannata and the members of the band Topper: Liberty DeVitto, Russell Javors, Howie Emerson, and Doug Stegmeyer. &quot;Turnstiles&quot; marked the first time that Joel&#x27;s band played on one of his studio albums.

The album cover photo was shot in the uptown platform of the New York City Subway&#x27;s Astor Place station. According to Joel, each of the characters on the album cover was meant to represent a particular song (e.g., the girl in headphones for &quot;All You Wanna Do is Dance&quot;, the wealthy couple for &quot;I&#x27;ve Loved These Days&quot;).

Barbra Streisand covered &quot;New York State of Mind&quot; on her album &quot;Superman&quot;, released in the Spring of 1977, opening up Billy Joel&#x27;s music to a mainstream audience. He thanked her for the exposure, and also told her his New York relatives were duly impressed to have the Queen of Brooklyn cover one of his songs.

==Critical reception==

Robert Christgau of &quot;The Village Voice&quot; wrote that Joel&#x27;s craft improves, but &quot;he becomes more obnoxious: the anti-idealism of &#x27;Angry Young Man&#x27; isn&#x27;t any more appealing in tandem with the pseudoironic of &#x27;I&#x27;ve Loved These Days.&#x27;&quot; In a retrospective review, Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic wrote that &quot;the key to the record&#x27;s success is variety, the way the album whips from the bouncy, McCartney-esque &#x27;All You Wanna Do Is Dance&#x27; to the saloon song &#x27;New York State of Mind&#x27;; the way the bitterly cynical &quot;Angry Young Man&quot; gives way to the beautiful &#x27;I&#x27;ve Loved These Days&#x27; and the surrealistic apocalyptic fantasy &#x27;Miami 2017 (Seen the Lights Go Out on Broadway).&#x27; No matter how much stylistic ground Joel covers, he&#x27;s kept on track by his backing group.&quot;

&quot;Cash Box&quot; called the single &quot;James&quot; &quot;a song to an old friend, wondering what he’s doing now,&quot; saying &quot;This beautiful tune kicks off with some sensitive playing on the Fender Rhodes, accompanied solely by bass. Gradually, as the song builds, so does the instrumentation.&quot;

&quot;Cash Box&quot; said that the single &quot;I&#x27;ve Loved These Days&quot; creates &quot;a perfect mood of grand cinema romance&quot; and commented on &quot;its elegant strings and crashing piano.&quot; &quot;Record World&quot; said that &quot;both melody and lyrics stand out on this powerful ballad, that could put him over the top.&quot;

==Track listing==

Many tracks have alternate mixes exclusive to the Quadrophonic LP release including &quot;New York State of Mind&quot;, &quot;Prelude/Angry Young Man&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;ve Loved These Days&quot; and &quot;Miami 2017 (Seen the Lights Go Out on Broadway)&quot;. Contrary to some sources, the saxophone solo on &quot;New York State of Mind&quot; was never re-recorded by Phil Woods for the release of &quot;Greatest Hits, Vols. I and II&quot;. The only time that Phil Woods performed on a Billy Joel recording was the song &quot;Just the Way You Are&quot; in 1977.

<doc id="369601" wikidata="Q3129699" url="?curid=369601" title="The Mighty Hercules">
<text>The Mighty Hercules is an animated television series based loosely on the Greek mythology character of Heracles, under his Roman name Hercules. It debuted on television in 1963. The show ran until 1966, coinciding with the sword-and-sandal genre of films popular between 1958 and 1965. Each stand-alone episode runs 5½ minutes, and in syndication was aired either as part of a block with other cartoons, or with several episodes airing consecutively to fill 30-minute time slots.

==Summary==
The cartoon features Hercules, the legendary hero, who dwells on Mount Olympus. Villains threaten the people of ancient Greece, often in the kingdom of Calydon, and Hercules comes to the rescue. When in serious danger, he puts on a magic ring which gives him superpowers. Once he puts the ring on and raises his fist, flashes of lightning (referred to as the Thunder of Zeus in several episodes) strike the ring, and Hercules is then endowed with super-strength. He does battle with such as Daedalus, an evil wizard who is the chief villain (sometimes accompanied by his pet cat Dydo). Other villains include Wilhelmine the Sea Witch (accompanied by her pet bird Elvira) and Murtis, who is invulnerable because he wears an iron helmet known as the Mask of Vulcan.

Hercules&#x27;s friends and allies are:

*Newton, his main sidekick, a helpful boy centaur who calls Hercules &quot;Herc&quot; and has a habit of repeating himself every time he speaks
*Helena, Hercules&#x27;s girlfriend
*Prince (later King) Dorian of Calydon
*Tewt, a small satyr who vocalizes only by playing his syrinx
*Timon, a young human from Calydon
*Pegasus, Hercules&#x27;s winged steed.

Also featured atop Mount Olympus are Hercules&#x27;s father Zeus and Dodonis with his crystal rock of seeing. Both often warn Hercules of the troubles going on down below in and around the Kingdom of Calydon or deep in the Lernaean Forest.

The original episode has relatively lavish animation by John Gentilella. In it, Hercules beats his friend Theseus in a footrace and a wrestling match, and for his victory Zeus rewards him by promising to grant any request Hercules makes. Hercules wishes to go to Earth to fight evil and injustice, but Zeus reminds him that going to Earth would cause him to lose his godly powers and become a mortal. Zeus then creates a magic ring that allows Hercules access to his godly strength while on Earth. The rest of the episode involves Hercules meeting Helena and fighting a giant named Cacus and the giant&#x27;s pet dragon. None of the other familiar characters make an appearance in the episode, and it features different character designs for Hercules and Helena.

The show generally used Greek myths as the inspiration for its episodes, but used the influences oddly. Daedalus is the evil wizard who is Hercules&#x27;s most frequent foe in the cartoon, but in Greek mythology Daedalus was a skilled artisan who was rarely villainous. Cacus, the giant of the first episode, is based on the mythological monster Cacus. Other recurring creatures – such as the Nemean lion, the Lernaean Hydra, the Erymanthian Boar, and the Stymphalian birds — were taken directly from the Twelve Labors of Hercules but, unlike in the Twelve Labors, most of the creatures are not presented in the cartoon as trials for Hercules to overcome.

In addition to the ring, later episodes added new equipment for Hercules and his friends to use, such as a &quot;moonstone beam&quot; in his belt and an invulnerable sword and shield. Episodes invariably ended with Hercules racing towards Mount Olympus and shouting &quot;Olympia!&quot; after defeating the villain.

==Production==

Adventure Cartoon Productions made &quot;The Mighty Hercules&quot; in connection with Trans-Lux Television, the same company that later brought the Japanese anime series &quot;Speed Racer&quot; to audiences in the United States. The company produced 128 episodes of &quot;The Mighty Hercules&quot;, each approximately five minutes in length. Joe Oriolo was the producer and director, and many of the animators were veterans of the New York City animation scene, including Grim Natwick, Frank Endres, John Gentilella, George Germanetti, Reuben Grossman, and George Rufle. Jack E. Miller, also known as creator and writer for DC Comics, wrote many of the episodes.

The show featured two different sets of voices for the characters. The most noticeably different voice was that of Newton: his original voice sounds as if he has just hit puberty, with his voice constantly cracking, while the later episodes give him a high-pitched Mickey Mouse-like voice. There is no gradual change in the voices. Most of the early episodes have the first set of voices, and the rest have the second set, and in the seventh episode during the first season, &quot;Double Trouble,&quot; the voices actually change during the episode, with Newton near the end of the episode speaking a line in his original cracking voice and in his very next line switching to his second, high-pitched voice, while Hercules speaks in his first voice until his final two lines of the episode, which are in Hercules&#x27;s second voice.

In early episodes of the first season, voice actor David Hartman, who later hosted the television show &quot;Good Morning America&quot;, voices Hercules before a different actor takes over for the remainder of the series&#x27;s run; &quot;The Mighty Hercules&quot; always credits Jimmy Tapp as the voice of Hercules despite Hartman&#x27;s early portrayal of the character. The series credits Daedalus&#x27;s voice, depending on the episode, to Jack Mercer or Gerry Bascombe. Early episodes also feature Mercer voicing Newton and other incidental characters. The voice actress for all the female voices is Helene Nickerson. The animation for the sequence of Hercules putting on and charging up his magic ring also changed subtly along with the voices. The episodes &quot;The Minotaur&quot; and &quot;The Chair of Forgetfulness&quot; provide good examples of the first set of voices and the first version of the ring sequence, while the episodes &quot;The Nemean Lion&quot; and &quot;The Chameleon Creature&quot; are good examples of the second set of voices and later ring sequence.

==Music==

&quot;The Mighty Hercules&quot; features a theme song sung by Johnny Nash, the American reggae singer-songwriter best known for 1956&#x27;s &quot;A Very Special Love&quot; and 1972&#x27;s &quot;I Can See Clearly Now&quot;. The theme music is credited to Winston Sharples (as &quot;Win Sharples&quot;), who in more than two decades at Paramount Pictures had composed background music for the &quot;Superman&quot; (1941) and Popeye theatrical cartoons produced by Fleischer Studios, while the theme&#x27;s lyrics were written by Sharples&#x27;s son Winston Sharples, Jr., under the pseudonym &quot;Win Singleton&quot; (his first and middle names).
The transformative &quot;ring anthem&quot; frequently used as Hercules slips on his magic ring, along with several bridges of music used throughout the episodes, were taken from the 1954 film &quot;The Black Shield of Falworth&quot;, with the music credited to Joseph Gershenson but actually composed by Hans J. Salter, Herman Stein, and Frank Skinner, the longtime in-house film composer for Universal Studios.

In 2005, &quot;The Mighty Hercules&quot; was re-issued to television in a newly remastered version and was reformatted, with new title music performed by an unidentified singer replacing the familiar theme music. The version that aired on the Canadian network Teletoon Retro used the original Nash theme music.

==Audio recording==

In 1963, Golden Records released a tie-in long-playing record for children entitled &quot;The Mighty Hercules&quot; (LP-108), with words and music by Winston Sharples.

==In popular culture==

In 2009, the Canadian jazz musician John Stetch covered the theme song from &quot;The Mighty Hercules&quot; on his album &quot;TV Trio&quot;.

When doing &quot;&quot;, Bruce Timm was inspired by the design of Hercules in what became the design for Superman in the show.

==DVD release==

On October 4, 2011, Classic Media (now DreamWorks Classics) brought the series to DVD for the first time with a single-disc selection entitled &quot;The Mighty Hercules&quot;, in Region 1. All 20 episodes are from season 1, the last one being episode 40.

<doc id="369602" wikidata="Q1073440" url="?curid=369602" title="Governor-General of Papua New Guinea">
<text>The governor-general of Papua New Guinea () is the representative of the Papua New Guinean monarch, currently King Charles III, in Papua New Guinea. The governor-general is appointed by the monarch after their nomination by the National Parliament by vote. The functions of the governor-general include appointing ministers, judges, and ambassadors; and issuing writs for election.

In general, the governor-general observes the conventions of the Westminster system and responsible government, maintaining a political neutrality, and has to always act only on the advice of the prime minister. The governor-general also has a ceremonial role: hosting events at the official residenceGovernment House in the capital, Port Moresbyand bestowing Papua New Guinean honours to individuals and groups who are contributing to their communities. When travelling abroad, the governor-general is seen as the representative of Papua New Guinea and its monarch. The governor-general is supported by a staff headed by the official secretary to Government House

Governors-general are appointed for a six-year term of office. Since 28 February 2017, the governor-general has been Sir Bob Dadae.

The office of the governor-general was created on 16 September 1975, when Papua New Guinea gained independence from Australia as a sovereign state and an independent constitutional monarchy. Since then, 10 individuals have served as governor-general.

==Appointment==

Unlike the governor-generals of most other Commonwealth realms, the governor-general of Papua New Guinea is nominated by the country&#x27;s Parliament, rather than being proposed by its prime minister. The appointment is made by the monarch of Papua New Guinea following a simple majority vote of the National Parliament. Section 88(1) of the constitution provides that the monarch must act &quot;in accordance with the advice of the National Executive Council given in accordance with a decision of the Parliament&quot;, while section 88(2) provides that the nomination for governor-general must be &quot;made by a simple majority vote, in an exhaustive secret ballot conducted in accordance with an Organic Law.&quot;

The term in office is six years. 

To be appointed for a second term, the governor-general must be supported by a two-thirds majority in the National Parliament. No person may serve for more than two terms. Thus far all retired governors-general have been knighted.

If the office of governor-general becomes vacant, due to death or dismissal, the speaker of the National Parliament of Papua New Guinea becomes acting governor-general until a new appointment is made. If the speakership is vacant, the chief justice instead assumes the role.

==Dismissal==

The governor-general may be dismissed by either a decision of the National Executive Council or an absolute majority of the National Parliament. 

No governor-general has been dismissed from office, although in 1991, Sir Vincent Serei Eri resigned from office after Prime Minister Sir Rabbie Namaliu advised the Queen to dismiss him.

==Functions==

Papua New Guinea shares the person of the sovereign equally with 14 other countries in the Commonwealth of Nations. As the sovereign works and resides predominantly outside of Papua New Guinea&#x27;s borders, the governor-general&#x27;s primary task is to perform the monarch&#x27;s constitutional duties on his or her behalf. As such, the governor-general carries out his or her functions in the government of Papua New Guinea on behalf and in the name of the Sovereign.

The governor-general&#x27;s powers and roles are derive from the Constitution of the Independent State of Papua New Guinea Part V Section 1, 2 &amp; 3 and set out certain provisions relating to the governor-general.

===Constitutional role===

The governor-general is responsible for dissolving parliament and issues writs for new elections. After an election, the governor-general formally requests the leader of the political party which gains the support of a majority in parliament to form a government. the governor-general commissions the prime minister and appoints other ministers after the election.

The governor-general acts on the advice of government ministers through the National Executive Council, to issue regulations, proclamations under existing laws, to appoint state judges, ambassadors and high commissioners to overseas countries, and other senior government officials.

The governor-general is also responsible for issuing Royal Commissions of Inquiry, and other matters, as required by particular legislation; and authorises many other executive decisions by ministers such as approving treaties with foreign governments.

The governor-general may, in certain circumstances, exercise without – or contrary to – ministerial advice. These are known as the reserve powers, and include:
*appointing a prime minister if an election has resulted in a &#x27;hung parliament&#x27;.
*dismissing the prime minister who has lost the confidence of the parliament.
*dismissing any minister acting unlawfully.
*refusing to dissolve Parliament despite a request from the prime minister.

===Ceremonial role===

The governor-general&#x27;s ceremonial duties include opening new sessions of parliament, welcoming visiting heads of state, and receiving the credentials of foreign diplomats.

As Commander-in-Chief of the Papua New Guinea Defence Force, the governor-general attends military parades and special occasions such as ANZAC Day and Remembrance Day, and presents Colours and other insignia to units of the Defence Force and the Police Force.

The governor-general also presents honours at investitures under the Papua New Guinea Honours system to persons for notable service to the community, or for acts of bravery.

===Community role===

The governor-general provides non-partisan leadership in the community, acting as patron of many charitable, service, sporting and cultural organisations, and attending functions throughout the country.

The governor-general also encourages, articulates and represents those things that unite Papua New Guineans together. In this role, the governor-general:

*travels widely throughout Papua New Guinea visiting cities, regional centres, rural districts, indigenous communities and disadvantaged groups.
*accepts patronage of many national, charitable, cultural, educational, sporting and professional organisations.
*opens and participates in conferences where topics of national importance are discussed – such as educational, health, cultural, welfare, defence, economic and rural issues.
*attends services, functions, commemorations and exhibitions of local significance, lending their encouragement to individuals and groups who are making a substantial contribution to their communities and to Papua New Guinea.
*issues congratulatory messages to Papua New Guineans who achieve significant milestones in their lives such as 100th birthdays and 50th wedding anniversaries.

==Privileges==

The governor-general acts as the chancellor of the Orders of Papua New Guinea. As chancellor of the orders, the governor-general is appointed as Grand Companion of the Order of Logohu and bestowed the title of &quot;Grand Chief&quot;.

===Symbols===

The governor-general uses a personal flag, which features a lion passant atop a St. Edward&#x27;s royal crown with &quot;Papua New Guinea&quot; written across a scroll underneath, all on a blue background. It is flown on buildings and other locations in Papua New Guinea to mark the governor-general&#x27;s presence.

===Residence===
Government House in Port Moresby is the official residence of the governor-general of Papua New Guinea.

The site for Government House was chosen by Sir Peter Scratchely, Special Commissioner for the Protectorate of British New Guinea, who arrived in Port Moresby in 1885. Government House has occupied this site ever since. In 1913, Sir Hubert Murray took the task of building a new House which superseded the original one.

<doc id="369603" wikidata="Q1146283" url="?curid=369603" title="Turnstile">
<text>A turnstile (also called a gateline, baffle gate, automated gate, turn gate in some regions) is a form of gate which allows one person to pass at a time. A turnstile can be configured to enforce one-way human traffic. In addition, a turnstile can restrict passage only to people who insert a coin, ticket, transit pass, security credential, or other method of payment or verification. Modern turnstiles can incorporate biometrics, including retina scanning, fingerprints, and other individual human characteristics which can be scanned. Thus a turnstile can be used in the case of paid access (sometimes called a faregate or ticket barrier when used for this purpose), for example to access public transport, a pay toilet, or to restrict access to authorized people, for example in the lobby of an office building.

==History==

Turnstiles were originally used, like other forms of stile, to allow human beings to pass while excluding livestock, grave yards being one application. They may have been used from the early modern period to control access to toll roads, and retail streets, the Holborn Great Turnstile appearing in 16th century literature Turnstiles were adopted as a means to control access to building and amusements during the 19th century, with many sports stadium and swimming pools installing them, patents for improvements to the concept being granted to manufacturers. Coin and later ticket operated turnstiles appeared on mass transit systems during the 20th century, magnetic strip encoded tickets and passes replacing earlier perforated tickets, during the late 1960s, in Tokyo. The use of turnstiles, in 20th century USA, has been credited to Clarence Saunders, who used them in his first Piggly Wiggly store.

==Applications==

Turnstiles are used at a wide variety of settings, including stadiums, amusement parks, mass transit stations, office lobbies, airports, ski resorts, factories, power plants and casinos.

From a business/revenue standpoint, turnstiles give an accurate, verifiable count of attendance. From a security standpoint, they lead patrons to enter single-file, so security personnel have a clear view of each patron. This enables security to efficiently isolate potential trouble or to confiscate any prohibited materials. On the other hand, physical barriers become a serious safety issue when a speedy evacuation is needed, requiring emergency exits that bypass any turnstiles. The ticket barriers on the London Underground and some busy UK railway stations have to be open if either the gates are unmanned or in an emergency.

Persons with disabilities may have difficulties using turnstiles. In these cases, generally a wide aisle gate or a manual gate may be provided. At some locations where luggage is expected, a line of turnstiles may be entirely formed of wide aisle gates, for example at Heathrow Terminals 2 &amp; 3 Underground station.

Turnstiles often use ratchet mechanisms to allow the rotation of the stile in one direction allowing ingress but preventing rotation in the other direction. They are often designed to operate only after a payment has been made, usually by inserting a coin or token in a slot; or by swiping, tapping, or inserting a paper ticket or electronically-encoded card.

Turnstiles are often used for counting the numbers of people passing through a gate, even when payment is not involved. They are used extensively in this manner in amusement parks, in order to keep track of how many people enter and exit the park and ride each ride. The, 1873, old Hampden Park stadium in Glasgow, Scotland, was one of the first soccer stadium to install turnstiles. 

==Types==
===Waist-high===
Waist-high turnstiles are often used in fairs, attractions, and arenas. The user inserts a ticket or pass into the slot, from which a barcode is read; if access is to be granted, a sensor determines the speed with which the user passes through, and sets the electric motor to turn the turnstile at the corresponding speed.
Sometimes also referred to as &quot;half-height&quot; turnstiles, this fixed arm style has traditionally been the most popular type of turnstile. There are many variations of this style available, including one which is designed to be accompanied by a matching ticket box, and one with a ticket box built in. Some styles are designed to allow entry only after a payment (actual coins and tokens) are inserted, while others allow access after a valid barcode is electronically read.
A disadvantage to this type is people can &quot;jump the turnstile&quot; as happens commonly on the Moscow Metro and other mass transport systems in Russia.

===Wall mount tripod turnstile===
The wall mount tripod turnstiles are suitable for places where installation on ground becomes impossible. The turnstile is directly fixed to the wall and all functions are achieved. Such turnstiles are usually used in narrow lanes and where wall installation is more feasible.

===Optical===

Optical turnstiles are an alternative to the traditional &quot;arm&quot;-style turnstile and are increasingly used in locations where a physical barrier is deemed unnecessary or unaesthetic. Optical turnstiles generally use an infrared beam to count patrons and recognize anyone attempting to enter a site without a valid entry pass.

===Drop-arm optical===

The drop-arm optical turnstile is a combination of the security of a tripod or barrier turnstile and a fully optical turnstile. The lanes can have either single or double arms. When access is granted the arms drop into recesses in the cabinet. Once the arms drop out of the way, the turnstile functions as a fully optical turnstile.

=== Full-height turnstiles ===
The full-height turnstilea larger version of the waist-high turnstile, commonly high is based on the same principle as the revolving door. Furthermore, full-height turnstiles offer better security inasmuch as they can neither be climbed over nor ducked under, and can be designed to lock after each person enters such that the following person must themselves pay a fee or present credentials. Too, they may be designed to allow traffic in both directions, or in a single direction. It is sometimes called a &quot;rotogate&quot;, especially in Chicago, where it is used at unstaffed exits of Chicago &quot;L&quot; stations, and is also used increasingly in New York City Subway stations since the turn of the 21st century.

<doc id="369616" wikidata="Q986069" url="?curid=369616" title="Politics of Quebec">
<text>The politics of Quebec are centred on a provincial government resembling that of the other Canadian provinces, namely a constitutional monarchy and parliamentary democracy. The capital of Quebec is Quebec City, where the Lieutenant Governor, Premier, the legislature, and cabinet reside.

The legislature — the Parliament of Quebec — is unicameral, consisting of the Lieutenant Governor and the National Assembly, which has 125 members. Government is conducted based on the Westminster model.

==Political system==

The British-type parliamentarism based on the Westminster system was introduced in the province of Lower Canada in 1791. The diagram at right represents the political system of Québec since the 1968 reform. Prior to this reform, the Parliament of Québec was bicameral.

Lieutenant Governor

* asks the leader of the majority party to form a government in which he will serve as Premier
* enacts the laws adopted by the National Assembly
* has the power to veto.

Premier

* appoints the members of the Cabinet and the heads of public corporations
* determines the date of the coming general elections

Members of the National Assembly (MNAs)

* are elected using the first-past-the-post voting system
* there are 125 Members of the National Assembly, so approximately one MNA for each 45,000 electors.

==Institutions==
Many of Quebec&#x27;s political institutions are among the oldest in North America. The first part of this article presents the main political institutions of Quebec society. The last part presents Québec&#x27;s current politics and issues.

===Parliament===
The Parliament of Québec holds the legislative power. It consists of the National Assembly of Québec and the Lieutenant Governor of Quebec.

==== Lieutenant Governor ====
While the powers of the Crown are vested in the monarch, they are exercised by the lieutenant governor, personal representative, typically on the binding advice of the premier and Executive Council.

=====Constitutional role=====

In Canada, lieutenant governor is appointed by the governor general, on the advice of the prime minister of Canada.Thus, it is typically the lieutenant governor whom the premier and ministers advise, in exercising much of the royal prerogative.

While the advice of the premier and Executive Council is typically binding on the lieutenant governor, there are occasions when the lieutenant governor has refused advice. This usually occurs if the premier does not clearly command the confidence of the elected National Assembly.

=====Ceremonial role=====

The lieutenant governor is tasked with a number of governmental duties. Not among them, though, is delivering the Throne Speech, which sets the lieutenant governor of Quebec apart from the other Canadian viceroys. (Instead, new sessions begin with the Opening Speech by the premier.) The lieutenant governor is also expected to undertake various ceremonial roles. For instance, upon installation, the lieutenant governor automatically becomes a Knight or Dame of Justice and the Vice-Prior in Quebec of the Most Venerable Order of the Hospital of Saint John of Jerusalem. The lieutenant governor presents numerous other provincial honours and decorations and various awards that are named for and presented by the lieutenant governor, which were reinstated in 2000 by Lieutenant Governor Lise Thibault. These honours are presented at official ceremonies, which count among hundreds of other engagements the lieutenant governor takes part in each year, either as host or guest of honour; in 2006, the lieutenant governor of Quebec undertook 400 engagements and 200 in 2007.

====National Assembly====
The National Assembly is part of a legislature based on the Westminster System. However, it has a few special characteristics, one of the most important being that it functions primarily in French, although French and English are Constitutionally official and the Assembly&#x27;s records are published in both languages. The representatives of the Québec people are elected with the first-past-the-post electoral method. Never varying from first-past-the-post, of all the provinces of Canada, Quebec is the only province that since 1867 has not ever used a multi-seat district.

The government is constituted by the majority party and it is responsible to the National Assembly. Since the abolition of the Legislative Council at the end of 1968, the National Assembly has all the powers to enact laws in the provincial jurisdiction as specified in the Constitution of Canada.

===Government===
The government of Quebec consists of all the ministries and governmental branches that do not have the status of independent institutions, such as municipalities and regional county municipalities.

====Executive Council====
The Executive Council is the body responsible for decision-making in the government. It is composed of the Lieutenant Governor (known as the Governor-in-Council), the Premier (in French &quot;Premier ministre&quot;), the government ministers, the ministers of state and delegate ministers. The Executive Council directs the government and the civil service, and oversees the enforcement of laws, regulations and policies. Together with the Lieutenant Governor, it constitutes the government of Québec. See also Premier of Québec.

====Quebec Ombudsman====
The Quebec Ombudsman is a legislative officer responsible for handling complaints from individuals, companies and associations who believe the government of Quebec or any of its branches has made an error or treated them unjustly. The Ombudsman has certain powers defined by the Public Protector Act. The Québec Ombudsman has a social contract with Québécois to ensure the transparency of the state.

====Human Rights and Youth Rights Commission====
The Commission des droits de la personne et des droits de la jeunesse (Human Rights and Youth Rights Commission) is a publicly funded agency created by the Charter of Human Rights and Freedoms. Its members are appointed by the National Assembly. The commission has been given powers to promote and protect human rights within all sectors of Québec society. Government institutions and Parliament are bound by the provisions of the Charter. The commission may investigate into possible cases of discrimination, whether by the State or by private parties. It may introduce litigation if its recommendations were not followed.

====Québec Office of the French language====
The Office Québécois de la Langue Française (Quebec Office of the French language) is an organization created in 1961. Its mandate was greatly expanded by the 1977 &quot;Charter of the French Language&quot;. It is responsible for applying and defining Québec&#x27;s language policy pertaining to linguistic officialization, terminology and francization of public administration and businesses.

See language policies for a comparison with other jurisdictions in the world.

====Council on the Status of Women====
Established in 1963, the Conseil du statut de la femme (Council on the Status of Women) is a government advisory and study council responsible for informing the government of the status of women&#x27;s rights in Québec. The council is made of a chair and 10 members appointed by the Québec government every four to five years. The head office of the council is in Québec City and it has 11 regional offices throughout Québec.

====Quebec Commission on Access to Information====
A first in North America, the Commission d&#x27;accès à l&#x27;information du Québec (Quebec Commission on Access to Information, CAI) is an institution created in 1982 to administer the Quebec legislative framework of access to information and protection of privacy.

The first law related to privacy protection is the Consumer Protection Act, enacted in 1971. It ensured that all persons had the right to access their credit record. A little later, the Professional Code enshrined principles such as professional secrecy and the confidential nature of personal information.

Today, the CAI administers the law framework of the Act respecting access to documents held by public bodies and the protection of personal information as well as the Act respecting the protection of personal information in the private sector.

===Chief electoral officer of Québec===
Independent from the government, this institution is responsible for the administration of the Québec electoral system.

===Judicial bodies===
The principal judicial courts of Québec are the Court of Quebec, the Superior Court and the Court of Appeal. The judges of the first are appointed by the Government of Quebec, while the judges of the two others are appointed by the Government of Canada.

In 1973, the Tribunal des professions was created to behave as an appeal tribunal to decisions taken by the various discipline committees of Quebec&#x27;s professional orders. The current president is Paule Lafontaine.

On December 10, 1990, the Human Rights Tribunal of Quebec was created. It became the first judicial tribunal in Canada specializing in human rights. The current president is Michèle Rivet.

An administrative tribunal, the Tribunal administratif du Québec is in operation since April 1, 1998, to resolve disputes between citizens and the government. The current president is Jacques Forgues.

===Municipal and regional institutions===
The territory of Quebec is divided into 17 administrative regions: Bas-Saint-Laurent, Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean, Capitale-Nationale, Mauricie, Estrie, Montreal, Outaouais, Abitibi-Témiscamingue, Côte-Nord, Nord-du-Québec, Gaspésie-Îles-de-la-Madeleine, Chaudière-Appalaches, Laval, Lanaudière, Laurentides, Montérégie, and Centre-du-Québec.

Inside the regions, there are municipalities and regional county municipalities (RCMs).

===School boards===

On July 1, 1998, 69 linguistic school boards, 60 Francophone and 9 Anglophone, were created in replacement for the former 153 Catholic and Protestant boards. In order to pass this law, which ended a debate of over 30 years, it was necessary for the Parliament of Canada to amend Article 93 of the Constitution Act 1867.

===Sharia law ban===
Sharia law is explicitly banned in Quebec, upheld by a unanimous vote against it in 2005 by the National Assembly.

===Voting patterns===
Voting patterns break down as follows:
*2022 Quebec general election – Sovereignists 30.04%, Federalists 27.28%, Autonomist/Others 40.98%
*2018 Quebec general election – Sovereignists 33.16%, Federalists 27.96%, Autonomist/Others 37.42%

==Political history==
When Quebec became one of the four founding provinces of the Canadian Confederation, guarantees for the maintenance of its language and religion under the Quebec Act of 1774 formed part of the British North America Act, 1867. English and French were made the official languages in Quebec Courts and the provincial legislature. The Quebec school system was provided public funding for a dual system based on the Roman Catholic and Protestant religions. Under the Constitution Act, 1867 the provinces were granted control of education. The religious-based separate school systems continued in Quebec until the 1990s when the Parti Québécois government of Lucien Bouchard requested an amendment under provisions of the Constitution Act, 1982 to formally secularize the school system along linguistic lines.

===19th century===
===Early 20th century or Liberal Era===
===&quot;La grande noirceur&quot;, the Quiet Revolution and Pre-National Assembly===

====Duplessis years 1936–1959====
Premier Maurice Duplessis and his Union Nationale party emerged from the ashes of the Conservative Party of Quebec and the Paul Gouin&#x27;s Action libérale nationale in the 1930s. This political lineage dates back to the 1850s Parti bleu of Louis-Hippolyte Lafontaine, a centre-right party in Quebec that emphasized provincial autonomy and allied itself with Conservatives in English Canada. Under his government, the Roman Catholic and Protestant Churches maintained the control they previously gained over social services such as schools and hospitals. The authoritarian Duplessis used the provincial police and the &quot;Padlock Law&quot; to suppress unionism and gave the Montreal-based Anglo-Scot business elite, as well as British and American capital a free rein in running the Quebec economy. His government also continued to attempt to prevent circulation of books banned by the Catholic Church, combated communism and even tried to shut down other Christian religions like the Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses who evangelized in French Canada. The clergy used its influence to exhort Catholic voters to continue electing with the &quot;Union Nationale&quot; and threaten to excommunicate sympathisers of liberal ideas. For the time it lasted, the Duplessis regime resisted the North American and European trend of massive State investment in education, health, and social programs, turning away federal transfers of funds earmarked for these fields; he jealously guarded provincial jurisdictions. Common parlance speaks of these years as &quot;La Grande Noirceur&quot; The Great Darkness, as in the first scenes of the film Maurice Richard.

====Quiet Revolution 1960–1966====
In 1960, under a new Liberal Party government led by Premier Jean Lesage, the political power of the church was greatly reduced. Quebec entered an accelerated decade of changes known as the Quiet Revolution. Liberal governments of the 1960s followed a robust nationalist policy of &quot;maîtres chez nous&quot; (&quot;masters in our own home&quot;) that would see French-speaking Quebecers use the state to elevate their economic status and assert their cultural identity. The government took control of the education system, nationalized power production and distribution into Hydro-Québec (the provincial power utility), unionized the civil service, founded the Caisse de Depot to manage the massive new government pension program, and invested in companies that promoted French Canadians to management positions in industry. In 1966, the Union Nationale returned to power despite losing the popular vote by nearly seven points to the Liberal Party, but could not turn the tide of modernization and secularization that the Quiet Revolution had started. Both Liberal and Union Nationale governments continued to oppose federal intrusion into provincial jurisdiction.

===Post-National Assembly, Rise of Quebec nationalist movements and Recent political history===
====René Lévesque and &quot;Sovereignty-Association&quot;====
A non-violent Quebec independence movement slowly took form in the late 1960s. The &quot;Parti Québécois&quot; was created by the sovereignty-association movement of René Lévesque; it advocated recognizing Quebec as an equal and independent (or &quot;sovereign&quot;) nation that would form an economic &quot;association&quot; with the rest of Canada. An architect of the Quiet Revolution, Lévesque was frustrated by federal-provincial bickering over what he saw as increasing federal government intrusions into provincial jurisdictions. He saw a formal break with Canada as a way out of this. He broke with the provincial Liberals who remained committed to the policy of defending provincial autonomy inside Canada.

====Pierre Trudeau&#x27;s liberalism====
In reaction to events in Quebec and formal demands of the Lesage government, Lester Pearson&#x27;s ruling Liberal government in Ottawa sought to address the new political assertiveness of Quebec. He commissioned the Royal Commission on Bilingualism and Biculturalism in 1963. Pearson also recruited Pierre Trudeau, who campaigned against the violation of civil liberties under Duplessis and the economic and political marginalization of French Quebecers in the 1950s. Trudeau saw official bilingualism in Canada as the best way of remedying this.

In 1968, Trudeau was elected Prime Minister on a wave of &quot;Trudeaumania&quot;. In 1969, his government instituted Official Bilingualism with the Official Languages Act which made French and English official languages and guaranteed linguistic minorities (English-speaking in Quebec, French-speaking elsewhere) the right to federal services in their language of choice, where the number justifies federal spending. He also implemented the policy of multiculturalism, answering the concern of immigrant communities that their cultural identities were being ignored. In 1971, Trudeau also failed in an attempt to bring home the Canadian Constitution from Great Britain at the Victoria conference when Robert Bourassa refused to accept a deal that would not include a Constitutional veto on federal institutions for Quebec.

Trudeau&#x27;s vision was to create a Constitution for a &quot;Just Society&quot; with a strong federal government founded on shared values of individual rights, bilingualism, social democratic ideals, and, later on, multiculturalism. As Liberal Justice Minister in 1967, he eliminated Canada&#x27;s sodomy law stating &quot;The state has no business in the bedrooms of the nation&quot;; he also created the first Divorce Act of Canada. This government also repealed Canada&#x27;s race-based immigration law.

====FLQ and the October Crisis====
During the 1960s, a violent terrorist group known as the Front de libération du Québec (FLQ) was formed in an effort to attain Quebec independence. In October 1970, their activities culminated in events referred to as the October Crisis when the British Trade commissioner James Cross was kidnapped along with Pierre Laporte, a provincial minister and Vice-Premier, who was killed a few days later. Quebec Premier Robert Bourassa called for military assistance to guard government officials. Prime Minister Trudeau responded by declaring the War Measures Act to stop what was described as an &quot;Apprehended Insurrection&quot; by the FLQ. Critics charge that Trudeau violated civil liberties by arresting thousands of political activists without a warrant as allowed by the Act. Supporters of these measures point to their popularity at the time and the fact that the FLQ was wiped out. Independence-minded Quebecers would now opt for the social democratic nationalism of the Parti Québécois.

====Sovereigntists elected and the Anglophone exodus====
Broad-based dissatisfaction by both English and French-speaking Quebecers with the government of Robert Bourassa saw Parti Québécois led by René Lévesque win the Quebec provincial election in 1976. The first PQ government was known as the &quot;republic of professors&quot;, for its high number of candidates teaching at the university level. The PQ government passed laws limiting financing of political parties and the Charter of the French Language (Bill 101). The Charter established French as the sole official language of Quebec. The government claimed the Charter was needed to preserve the French language in an overwhelmingly anglophone North American continent.

The enactment of Bill 101 was highly controversial and led to an immediate and sustained exodus of anglophones from Quebec that, according to Statistics Canada (2003), since 1971 saw a drop of 599,000 of those Quebecers whose mother tongue was English. This exodus of English speakers provided a substantial and permanent boost to the population of the city of Toronto, Ontario. This Quebec diaspora occurred for a number of reasons including regulations that made French the only language of communication allowed between employers and their employees. Under pain of financial penalties, all businesses in Quebec having more than fifty employees were required to obtain a certificate of francization [Reg.139-140] and those businesses with over one hundred employees were obliged to establish a Committee of francization [Reg.136] As well, the language law placed restrictions on school enrollment for children based on parental language of education and banned outdoor commercial signs displaying languages other than French. The section of the law regarding language on signs was deemed unconstitutional by the Supreme Court of Canada under the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, see: Ford v Quebec (AG). The revised law of 1988 adheres to the Supreme Court judgment, specifying that signs can be multilingual so long as French is predominant. The maintenance of an inspectorate to enforce the sign laws remains controversial. However, most Quebeckers adhere to the sign laws, as remembrance of what Montreal looked like (an English city for a French majority) before the sign laws is still vivid.

====1980 referendum and the Constitution Act of 1982====
In the 1980 Quebec referendum, Premier René Lévesque asked the Quebec people for &quot;a mandate to negotiate&quot; his proposal for &quot;sovereignty-association&quot; with the federal government. The Referendum promised that a subsequent deal would be ratified with a second referendum. Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau would campaign against it, promising a renewed federalism based on a new Canadian Constitution. Sixty per cent of the Quebec electorate voted against the sovereignty-association project. After opening a final round of constitutional talks, the Trudeau government patriated the constitution in 1982 without the approval of the Quebec government, which sought to retain a veto on constitutional amendments along with other special legal recognition within Canada. The new constitution featured a modern Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms based on individual freedoms that would ban racial, sexual, and linguistic discrimination and enshrine minority language rights (English in Quebec, French elsewhere in Canada). After dominating Quebec politics for more than a decade, both Lévesque and Trudeau would then retire from politics shortly in the early 1980s.

====Meech Lake Accord of 1987====
From 1985 to 1994, the federalist provincial Liberal Party governed Quebec under Robert Bourassa. The Progressive Conservatives replaced the Liberals federally in 1984 and governed until 1993. Progressive Conservative Prime Minister Brian Mulroney brought together all provincial premiers, including Robert Bourassa, to get the Quebec government&#x27;s signature on the constitution. The Meech Lake Accord in 1987 recognized Quebec as a &quot;distinct society&quot;. The Mulroney government also transferred considerable power over immigration and taxation to Quebec.

The Accord faced stiff opposition from a number of quarters. In Quebec and across Canada, some objected to it arguing that &quot;distinct society&quot; provisions were unclear and could lead to attempts at a gradual independence for Quebec from Canada, and compromising the Charter of Rights. The Parti Québécois, by then led by sovereigntist Jacques Parizeau, opposed the Meech Lake agreement because it did not grant Quebec enough autonomy. The Reform Party in Western Canada led by Preston Manning said that the Accord compromised principles of provincial equality, and ignored the grievances of the Western provinces. Aboriginal groups demanded &quot;distinct society&quot; status similar to Quebec&#x27;s.

The Accord collapsed in 1990 when Liberal governments came to power in Manitoba and Newfoundland, and did not ratify the agreement. Prime Minister Mulroney, Premier Bourassa, and the other provincial premiers negotiated another constitutional deal, the Charlottetown Accord. It weakened Meech provisions on Quebec and sought to resolve the concerns of the West, and was soundly rejected by a country-wide referendum in 1992. 

The collapse of the Meech Lake Accord reshaped the entire Canadian political landscape. Lucien Bouchard, a Progressive Conservative Cabinet Minister who felt humiliated by the defeat of the Meech Lake Accord, led other Quebec Progressive Conservatives and Liberals out of their parties to form the sovereigntist Bloc Québécois. Mario Dumont, leader of the Quebec Liberal Party&#x27;s youth wing left Bourassa&#x27;s party to form a &quot;soft nationalist&quot; and sovereigntist Action démocratique du Québec party. The Progressive Conservative Party collapsed in the 1993 election, with Western conservatives voting Reform, Quebec conservatives voting for the Bloc Québécois, and Ontario and Western Montreal voters putting the Liberal Party led by Jean Chrétien into power. Jean Charest in Sherbrooke, Quebec, was one of two Progressive Conservatives left in Parliament, and became party leader.

====1995 referendum, its aftermath and fall of interest in Quebec Independence 1995–2018====
The Parti Québécois won the 1994 provincial election under the leadership of Jacques Parizeau amid continued anger over the rejection of the Meech Lake Accord. The Parizeau government quickly held a referendum on sovereignty in 1995. Premier Parizeau favoured a unilateral declaration of independence (UDI) followed by negotiations with the federal government if sovereignty were endorsed in the referendum. Lucien Bouchard and Dumont insisted that negotiations with the federal government should come before a declaration of independence. They compromised with an agreement to work together followed by a referendum question that would propose resorting to a UDI by the National Assembly only if negotiations to negotiate a new political &quot;partnership&quot; under Lucien Bouchard failed to produce results after one year.

The sovereigntist campaign remained moribund under Parizeau. It was only with a few weeks to go in the campaign that support for sovereignty skyrocketed to above 50%. On October 30, 1995, the partnership proposal was rejected by an extremely slim margin of less than one per cent.

Parizeau resigned and was replaced by Bouchard. The sovereigntist option was pushed aside until they could establish &quot;winning conditions&quot;. Bouchard was suspected by hard-line sovereigntists as having a weak commitment to Quebec independence. Bouchard, in turn, was ill at ease with the ardent nationalism of some elements in the Parti Québécois. He eventually resigned over alleged instances of anti-Semitism within the hard-line wing of the party and was replaced by Bernard Landry. Tensions between the left wing of the party and the relatively fiscal conservative party executive under Bouchard and Landry also led to the formation of the Union des forces progressistes, another social-democratic sovereigntist party that later merged with other left-wing groups to form Québec solidaire.

Mario Dumont and the Action démocratique du Québec put the sovereigntist option aside entirely and ran on a fiscally conservative agenda. They won three consecutive byelections, and their popularity soared fleetingly in opinion polls shortly before the 2003 provincial election, in which they won only four seats and 18% of the popular vote.

The federal Liberal Party Prime Minister Jean Chrétien came under sharp criticism for mishandling the &quot;No&quot; side of the referendum campaign. He launched a hard-line &quot;Plan B&quot; campaign by bringing in Montreal constitutional expert Stéphane Dion, who would attack the perceived ambiguity of the referendum question through a Supreme Court reference on the unilateral secession of Quebec in 1998 and draft the Clarity Act in 2000 to establish strict criteria for accepting a referendum result for sovereignty and a tough negotiating position in the event of a Quebec secession bid.

Jean Charest was lauded by federalists for his impassioned and articulate defense of Canada during the referendum. He left the Progressive Conservative Party to lead the provincial Liberals (no legal relation to its federal counterpart) and a &quot;No&quot; campaign in the event of another referendum, and led his new party to an election victory in 2003. He was re-elected as provincial Premier in the election of 2007, and again in 2008, after having called a snap election.

Prior to the 2018 election, the political status of Quebec inside Canada used to remain a central question. This desire for greater provincial autonomy has often been expressed during the annual constitutional meetings of provincial premiers with the Prime Minister of Canada. In Quebec, no single option regarding autonomy currently gathers a majority of support. Therefore, the question remains unresolved after almost 50 years of debate.

====Return of Quebec Autonomy movement and Rise of Coalition Avenir Québec 2018–====
In 2018 election, the Coalition Avenir Québec, a Quebec Autonomist Party, won the majority of seats, the first time since 1966 that neither the Parti Québécois (which also lost its official party status for the first time but however to regain months later) nor the Quebec Liberals won a majority. Québec Solidaire also gained a few seats from the Parti Québécois collapse and a couple from Quebec Liberals. This also ended the interest of Quebec independence from Canada for a while, as seemingly half of Quebecers preferred returning to the idea of receiving more political autonomy within Canada.

In the 2022 Quebec general election, the ruling party, Coalition Avenir Québec (CAQ), secured 90 seats out of 125.

==National Question==
The National Question is the debate regarding the future of Quebec and the status of it as a province of Canada. Political parties are organized along ideologies that favour independence from Canada (sovereigntist or separatist) and various degrees of autonomy within Canada (autonomists or federalists). Social democrats, liberals, and conservatives are therefore present in most major parties, creating internal tensions.

===Federalism===
====Canadian Liberalism====
Federal Liberals largely defend Quebec&#x27;s remaining within Canada and keeping the status quo regarding the Canadian constitution. They embrace the liberalism held by former Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau and view Canada as a bilingual, multicultural nation based on individual rights. They stress that their nationalism is based on shared civic values, and reject nationalism defined solely on English or French Canadian culture. They defend the need for the federal government to assume the major role in the Canadian system, with occasional involvement in areas of provincial jurisdiction. English-speaking Quebecers, immigrants, and aboriginal groups in northern Quebec strongly support this form of federalism. They may recognize the national status of Quebec, but only informally in the cultural and sociological sense. The traditional vehicle for &quot;status-quo&quot; federalists is the Liberal Party of Canada, although elements of the Conservative Party of Canada have adopted aspects of this position.

The social-democratic New Democratic Party supports Quebec&#x27;s right to self-determination, but they are firmly opposed to sovereignty, and do not support any major devolving of economic and political powers to Quebec&#x27;s provincial government.

====Federalist Quebec autonomism====

The Quebec autonomists are pro-autonomy movement who believe Quebec should seek to gain more political autonomy as a province while remaining a part of the Canadian federation. In 2018 election that the only Autonomist party Coalition Avenir Québec successfully won over most of Quebec population since the Union Nationale in the mid-20th century with this view about the future of Quebec&#x27;s political status.

====Federalist Quebec nationalism====
The federalist nationalists are nationalists who believe it is best for the people of Quebec to reform the Canadian confederation in order to accommodate the wish of Quebecers to continue to exist as a distinct society by its culture, its history, its language, and so on. They recognize the existence of the Quebec political (or civic) nation; however, they do not think Quebecers truly wish to be independent from the rest of Canada. Before the arrival of the Parti Québécois, all major Quebec parties were federalist and nationalist. Since then, the party most associated with this view is the Liberal Party of Quebec. On two occasions, federalist nationalists of Quebec attempted to reform the Canadian federation together with allies in other provinces. The 1990 Meech Lake Accord and the 1992 Charlottetown Accord were both ultimately unsuccessful.

===Sovereignism (separatism)===
====Soft nationalists====

So-called &quot;soft nationalists&quot; have been characterized as &quot;those who were willing to support Quebec independence only if they could be reasonably reassured that it would not produce economic hardship in the short term&quot;, and as &quot;people who call themselves Quebecers first, Canadians second&quot;. They are the voters who gave Brian Mulroney two back-to-back majorities in the 1980s, when he promised to bring Quebec into Canada&#x27;s constitution &quot;with honour and enthusiasm.&quot;&quot; They swing between a desire for full independence, and for the recognition of Quebec nationhood and independence within Canada. They are typically swing voters, and tend to be swayed by the political climate, becoming &quot;harder&quot; nationalists when angered by perceived rejection by English Canada (such as the blocking of the Meech Lake Accord), but &quot;softening&quot; when they perceive sovereigntists as threatening the economic and social stability seemingly afforded by Canadian federalism.

Many also view the spectre of Quebec secession as a useful negotiation tool to gain more powers within Confederation. For example, Daniel Johnson Sr ran on a platform of &quot;Égalité ou indépendance&quot; (Equality or independence) in the late 1960s as a way of pressing for increased powers from the federal government. Lucien Bouchard expressed similar sentiments as a student. 

====Sovereigntists====

Sovereigntists are moderate nationalists who do not believe Canada to be reformable in a way that could answer what they see as the legitimate wish of Quebecers to govern themselves freely. They opt for the independence of Quebec; however, at the same time, they insist on offering an economic and political partnership to the rest of Canada on the basis of the equality of both nations. The political parties created by the sovereigntists created are the Bloc Québécois and the Parti Québécois, which its members define as a party of social democratic tendency. The Parti Québécois organized a 1980 referendum and a 1995 referendum, each of which could have led to negotiations for independence had it succeeded. The &quot;No&quot; side prevailed in both, but its margin was very narrow in the second referendum (50.6% &quot;No&quot;, 49.4% &quot;Yes&quot;). Sovereigntists find their ideological origins in the Mouvement Souveraineté-Association, René Lévesque&#x27;s short-lived precursor to the Parti Québécois.

====Indépendantistes====

Indépendentistes are fully nationalist in outlook. They view the federal government as a successor state to the British Empire, and as a &quot;de facto&quot; colonizing agent of English Canada. Consequently, they demand complete independence for Quebec, which they view in the context of national liberation movements in Africa and the Caribbean of the 1960s. Independence is seen as the culmination of a natural societal progression, from colonization to provincial autonomy to outright independence. Accordingly, they tend to favour assertive declarations of independence over negotiations, idealizing the Patriote movement of the 1830s. Their ideological origins can be found within the Rassemblement pour l&#x27;indépendance nationale headed by Pierre Bourgault, a founding organization of the Parti Québécois.

==Public policies==
===National policy===

Quebec&#x27;s national policy covers all areas relating to the Quebec nation. It establishes the values and foundations on which Quebec society bases its cohesion and its specificity. The Québécois constitution is enshrined in a series of social and cultural traditions that are defined in a set of judicial judgments and legislative documents, including the (&quot;Law on the National Assembly&quot;), the (&quot;Law on the Executive&quot;), and the (&quot;Electoral Law of Quebec&quot;). Other notable examples include:

* the Charter of Human Rights and Freedoms
* the Charter of the French language
* the Civil Code of Quebec

It is also based on a set of statements which clarify and reinforce already established social practices. For example, in his press release on February 8, 2007, Jean Charest reaffirmed three of Quebec society&#x27;s fundamental values:

* the equality between men and women
* the primacy of French
* the separation of State and religion

In addition, Quebec defines itself as a free and democratic state of law.

On October 30, 2003, the National Assembly adopted a resolution reaffirming that the people of Quebec form a nation, as well as a motion on May 22, 2008, citing:
===Federal policy===
Quebec participates in federal political life in different ways.

Since 1969, the Official Languages Act has allowed Quebec to integrate better into the Canadian community, in addition to guaranteeing a legal and linguistic context conducive to the development of the province.

The Quebec premier is part of the Council of the Federation, which allows it to participate proactively in the federation.

Quebec possesses a network of three offices, each led by one station chief, for representing itself and defending its interests in Canada: one in Moncton (for Atlantic Canada), one in Toronto (for Ontario and Western Canada) and one in Ottawa (for the federal government). These offices&#x27; mandate is to ensure an institutional presence of the Government of Quebec near other Canadian governments and to allow Quebec to interact effectively with the other provinces of the country.

===International policy===
Quebec&#x27;s international policy is founded upon the , formulated in 1965. While Quebec&#x27;s Ministry of International Relations coordinates guiding principles in international policy, its Quebec&#x27;s general delegations that are the main interlocutors in foreign countries. In matters relating to Quebec law, or matters relating to treaties, deals, accords and programs, only Quebecois political bodies have negotiatic power, along with heads of state, governments, embassies and foreign consulates. Under the rule of law, any agreement made abroad, by the federal or Quebecois government, is only applicable in domestic politics by the consent of popular sovereignty.

Quebec is the only Canadian province that has set up a ministry to exclusively embody the state&#x27;s powers for matters of international relations. In other provinces, the general tendency is to entrust this type of mandate to a minister that was already carrying out other responsibilities (most likely in intergovernmental relations).

Quebec is a member of the Assemblée parlementaire de la Francophonie and of the Organisation internationale de la francophonie.

===Environmental and energy policies===

Since 2006, Quebec has adopted a green plan in order to meet the objectives of the Kyoto Protocol regarding climate change. The Ministry of Sustainable Development, Environment, and Fight Against Climate Change (MELCC) is the primary entity responsible for the application of environmental policy on the Québécois territory. The Société des établissements de plein air du Québec (SEPAQ) is the main body responsible for the management of national parks, wildlife reserves, etc.

On November 23, 2009, Jean Charest announced Quebec&#x27;s greenhouse gas reduction targets at the Copenhagen conference: Quebec intended to reduce its emissions by 20% by 2020 (compared to the emissions of 1990) and will focus on the transportation sector, which accounts for 40% of GHG emissions in Quebec. Following this announcement, the government undertook the initiatives needed to keep its promises. On January 14, 2010, a law came into effect aimed at reducing vehicle GHGs. Automobile manufacturers who sell vehicles in Quebec have to comply with an emission ceiling of 187 g of GHG/km. This emission level was also lowered every year until it fell to 127 g of GHG/km in 2016. Manufacturers have to obtain an emission average equivalent to that of the enforced level, so they are still be able to sell vehicles that sometimes exceed this threshold. These standards are as strict as those of California (United States), according to the Government of Quebec.

Hydroelectricity is Quebec&#x27;s main energy source. The Hydro-Québec corporation, owned by the government of Quebec, is the main producer and provider of this renewable and low-pollution energy. Hydro-Québec is a profitable company in constant expansion (for example the , the James Bay Project, the , etc.). Wind energy also sees modest use.

The population of Quebec seems to be more sensitive to environmental issues than the population of other Canadian provinces. According to a 2019 university study, 67% of Québécois residents are aware of humanity&#x27;s impact on global warming, while the figure drops to 47% in Saskatchewan and to 42% in Alberta. The economic structure of each of these provinces could be one explanation: &quot;Quebec does not produce petroleum, but mainly hydroelectricity. Compared to Alberta... There is the whole structure of the economy that could explain this phenomenon&quot; analyzes the academic Erick Lachapelle. Nearly 500,000 people took part in a climate protest on the streets of Montreal in 2019.

===Agricultural and forestry policies===
Agriculture in Quebec has been subject to agricultural zoning regulations since 1978. Faced with the problem of expanding urban sprawl, agricultural zones were created to ensure the protection of fertile land, which make up 2% of Quebec&#x27;s total area. The (CPTAQ) is the main guarantor. The city of Saint-Hyacinthe is the agricultural technopole of Quebec and is recognized for its agro-food, veterinary and agro-environmental biotechnology.

 are essentially public property. The calculation of annual cutting possibilities is the responsibility of the . The (SOPFEU) works in a public-private partnership with the Quebec government in order to protect forests against forest fires. The Union des producteurs agricoles (UPA) seeks to protect the interests of its members, including forestry workers, and works jointly with the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (MAPAQ) and the Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources.

===Employment, taxation and immigration policies===

The has the mandate to oversee social and workforce developments through Emploi-Québec and its local employment centers (CLE). This ministry is also responsible for managing the (QPIP) as well as last-resort financial support for families and people in need. The (CNESST) is the main body responsible for the application of labour laws in Quebec and enforcing the collective agreements concluded between unions of employees and their employers.

When it comes to taxation, Revenu Québec takes the majority of its revenue through a progressive income tax, a 9.975% sales tax and various other taxes (such as carbon, corporate and capital gains taxes), equalization payments from the federal government, transfer payments from other provinces and direct payments. By some measures Quebec is the highest taxed province; a 2012 study indicated that &quot;Quebec companies pay 26 per cent more in taxes than the Canadian average&quot;. A 2014 report by the Fraser Institute indicated that &quot;Relative to its size, Quebec is the most indebted province in Canada by a wide margin&quot;.

Immigration to Quebec is supported by integration programs favouring French, as it is the common language, as well as the principles of pluralism and interculturalism. The is responsible for the selection and integration of immigrants, and immigration policy favours respect for Québécois values as well as respect for Quebec&#x27;s cultural, historical and social characteristics.

===Health, social and education policies===
Quebec&#x27;s health and social services network is administered by the Ministry of Health and Social Services. It is composed of 95 (RLS; &#x27;local service networks&#x27;) and 18 (ASSS; &#x27;health and social services agencies&#x27;). Quebec&#x27;s health system is supported by the &quot;Régie de l&#x27;assurance maladie du Québec&quot; (RAMQ) which works to maintain the accessibility of services for all citizens of Quebec. Pre-hospital care and rescue missions are provided by foundations and non-profit organizations.

The (CPEs; &#x27;centres for young children&#x27;) are institutions that link family policies to education. They are administered by the . Quebec&#x27;s education system is administered by the Ministry of Education and Higher Education (primary and secondary schools), the (CEGEP) and the . Postsecondary studies include : the public university of the University of Quebec, vocational training centers, private colleges, public colleges (CEGEPs), and private universities.

In 2012, the annual cost for postsecondary tuition was CA$2,168 (€1,700)—less than half of Canada&#x27;s average tuition. Quebec universities are among the least expensive in Canada. Part of the reason for this is the relative democratization of higher education implemented during the Quiet Revolution of the 1960s, when the Quebec government froze tuition fees to a relatively low level and created CEGEPs. When Jean Charest&#x27;s government decided in 2012 to sharply increase university fees, students protests erupted. Because of these protests, Quebec&#x27;s tuition fees remain relatively low today.

== International organizations ==
Quebec is a participating government in the international organization the Francophonie, which can be seen as a sort of Commonwealth of Nations for French-speaking countries. Since the 1960s, Quebec has an international network of delegations which represent the Government of Quebec abroad. It is currently represented in 28 foreign locations and includes six General delegations (government houses), four delegations (government offices), nine government bureaus, six trade branches, and three business agents.

Through its civil society, Quebec is also present in many international organizations and forums such as Oxfam, the World Social Forum, and World March of Women.

<text>Sigma Phi Delta () is an international professional-social fraternity of engineers. As &quot;The Premier International Fraternity of Engineers&quot;, the organization is the only fraternity of its kind that draws its membership exclusively from male engineering students at ABET-accredited colleges and universities, as other similar organizations are co-ed or admit students not strictly in traditional engineering programs (such as architecture or technical sciences).

==History==
Sigma Phi Delta was founded at University of Southern California on April 11, 1924 and currently has 25 active chapters.

==Symbols==
===Blazon for the Sigma Phi Delta Coat of Arms===

The description of the crest, using heraldic language, is: Gules, a pall or, between, in chief two retorts crossed argent, in dexter base a quill sable surmounting a key in saltire, of the third, in sinister base a hammer fesswise of the fourth debruising a compass, points downward, of the third; over all the escutcheon of pretense, azure, charged with a castle or, masoned sable, with a bordure argent.

Crest, over a duke&#x27;s helmet and a torse of the colors, a dexter cubit arm, proper, grasping a thunderbolt, winged or
Mantling: Gules doubled, or
Supporters: Two lions, rampant, proper

Motto: Sigma Phi Delta, in upper and lower case Greek letters

===Insignia===
The Name of the Fraternity is represented by the capital form of the Greek letters Sigma (Σ), Phi (Φ), Delta (Δ) which stand for Science, Friendship and Duty.

===Pledge Pin===
The Pledge Pin is described as: &quot;A red triangular background on which is a black Castle, the whole bordered in gold&quot;.

===Membership Badge===
The Membership Badge is described as: &quot;A triangle having concave corners on which are superimposed three smaller triangles having concave sides and having their vertices at the center of the badge on which is placed a ruby. The smaller triangles, which contain the letters Sigma, Phi and Delta, are black, the background between them being white. A gold star is located near each of the vertices of the large triangle. The border may be engraved gold or may be jeweled. The crown pearl badge has four pearls on each side of the badge. The ruby point badge has two rubies and two pearls on each side, the pearls being in the middle and the rubies at the outside&quot;.

===Fraternity flag===

The fraternity flag is 4&#x27; × 6&#x27; cotton bunting or nylon. The design is black letters, bordered with white and a gold Castle on a red field. This is a standard flag, that is, read correctly from left to right on one side and in reverse on the other.

== Strategic partnerships ==
In 2015, Sigma Phi Delta and Alpha Omega Epsilon joined together to form a strategic partnership with the FIRST Robotics Competition in order to fulfill their respective mission to further Engineering Education. Together, they plan to advocate and promote career opportunities in STEM, within grades K–12 as well as higher education, build on existing STEM related programs, and seek ways to engage their memberships in FIRST Mentor/Coach opportunities as a means of workforce development, increased community involvement and/or encourage employees to give back to the communities where they live/work. Most Sigma Phi Delta chapters were already involved with their respective communities FIRST teams, but this further cements Sigma Phi Delta&#x27;s object of further Engineering as a whole.

== Chapters ==

<doc id="369636" wikidata="Q7427972" url="?curid=369636" title="Save A Lot">
<text>Save A Lot Food Stores Ltd. is an American discount supermarket chain store headquartered in St. Ann, Missouri, in Greater St. Louis. It has about 900 independently owned and operated stores across 32 states in the United States with over $4 billion in annual sales.

Stores carry most grocery products, with an assortment of fresh, canned and frozen produce, meat, meal products, household items and everyday groceries. Save A Lot grocery stores sell national brands and private label brands at a discounted price. A typical Save A Lot grocery store is with items displayed in their cardboard shipping boxes.
==History==
Save A Lot was founded in 1977 by Bill Moran as an alternative to larger supermarkets. He opened the first Save A Lot store in Cahokia, Illinois, and remained with the company until his retirement in 2006.

In 1978, General Grocer Company expanded the company&#x27;s presence in the greater St. Louis area. Eventually, the store network grew to 30 stores by the end of the decade. At the root of company&#x27;s growth strategy is its licensee relationship, in which Save A Lot acts as a wholesaler to its independent store owners as opposed to a franchisor. Smaller, independent grocery retailers soon found the limited assortment model to be an effective defensive strategy against the larger chain supermarkets. With help from new licensees, in 1980 alone Save A Lot added 50 stores in the Mid-South region, and a warehouse in Jackson, Tennessee.

In 1984, Save A Lot purchased 75 similar format Jewel T stores and two distribution centers from Jewel in Florida and Pennsylvania.
In 1987, Save A Lot was purchased by St. Louis-based food retailer and wholesaler Wetterau Inc, then owner of former sister stores Shop &#x27;n Save.

===Acquisition by SuperValu, 1994–2016===
In 1994, both the Save A Lot and Shop &#x27;n Save banners became wholly owned subsidiaries of Supervalu Inc, one of the largest independent grocery wholesalers, and the owners of Cub Foods and Scott&#x27;s Food &amp; Pharmacy at the time. The acquisition opened up Save A Lot&#x27;s licensee opportunities to conventional Supervalu-supplied operators, including Niemann Foods.

Save A Lot expanded into Southern California with the purchase of 21 discount-grocery Sav U Foods stores, and a distribution center from the Fleming Companies in late 1996.

In 2002, Save A Lot acquired discount variety store chain Deals with 45 stores in the Midwest. The typical Deal$ store had a slightly smaller footprint than Save A Lot and carried mostly non-food merchandise at dollar-increment price points. The Deal$ concept was expanded under Save A Lot to 138 stores by 2006. The acquisition also allowed Save A Lot grocery stores to stock more general merchandise in its grocery stores. The company experimented with hypermarkets which combined the discount grocery and merchandise concepts under one roof. This eventually led to 480 combination stores that did not carry the Deal$ banner. In 2006, Save A Lot sold Deal$ to Dollar Tree for $30.5 million plus inventory. Save A Lot reduced the amount of general merchandise in its combination stores and returned them to its grocery-focused model.

In 2009, Save A Lot expanded its presence internationally. In the Caribbean, Save A Lot opened the first three international licensee grocery stores in Aruba, Freeport- Bahamas and Dominica. Expansion continued with secondary locations opening in Aruba and 8 mile Rock-Bahamas. International interest and growth continued with additional stores opening in St. Vincent, Curaçao, Trinidad and Tobago- (Mount Hope and Diego Martin). From the Caribbean, expansion moved to Central America establishing the brand with the opening of two retail sites in Guatemala City. Grenada was the last international licensee scheduled opening. As of 2018, with the change of corporate ownership the overall corporate strategy shifted to focus all efforts on stateside store growth. The international retail licenses were dissolved and existing international accounts were converted to wholesale accounts. The international stores no longer operate under the Save A Lot brand name or Save A Lot Licensee agreement but as independent retailers.

In late 2009, newly hired Supervalu CEO Craig Herkert announced the goal to double the Save A Lot grocery store network to 2,400 locations within five years. The company opened nearly 100 stores in 2010 with a major focus on the Southeastern United States.

Save A Lot entered into a licensing affiliation with Hispanic grocer Rafael Ortega to rebrand six former Save A Lots in Houston, Texas, and South Texas as &quot;El Ahorro Save A Lot&quot;. new stores featured Save A Lot product offerings along with more traditional Hispanic staples.

In late 2010, Rite Aid became a licensed Save A Lot operator when it converted 10 of its existing pharmacies in the Greenville, South Carolina, area to co-branded &quot;Save A Lot/Rite Aid&quot; units.

In September 2012, Supervalu announced it would close 22 Save A Lot stores in seven states. Several executive changes were made by Supervalu on March 4, 2013, including replacing Save-A-Lot CEO Roces with Ritchie Casteel. This came in the midst of plans by Supervalu to sell a number of its other grocery chains to Cerberus Capital Management.

===Sale to Onex Corporation, 2016–2020===
In October 2016, SuperValu sold Save A Lot to Onex Corporation. In April 2020, Save A Lot completed a recapitalization of the business with the company&#x27;s lenders that canceled approximately $500 million in debt and provided a $350 million capital infusion to the company. Save A Lot is now privately held by institutional investors.

===Transition to wholesale model, 2020–2023===
In early 2020, Save-a-Lot began a financial restructuring towards a wholesale model in order to reduce its debt load. It&#x27;s sought to no longer operate its locations and instead license them off to independent retailers.

In August 2023, Save-a-Lot revealed that the remaining 18 stores that it operated directly were to be acquired by Leevers Supermarkets. Leevers is an employee-owned company that also operate Leevers Locavore, El Mercado De Colorado, and had already been operating 29 Save-a-Lots. As of February 2024, Leevers Supermarkets operated a total of 52 Save-a-Lots (14 in Colorado, 20 in the mid-Atlantic, and 18 in the greater St Louis area).

<text>Mariano Grueiro (born 1975) is a Galego (Galician language) cultural activist, writer, photographer, filmmaker, artist.

He was born in 1975 in Narón, Galicia/Galiza, Spain, and grew up in the naval dockyard town of Ferrol in the 1980s, during a period of major crisis in the Galician shipbuilding industry.

As a photographer his main areas of work are landscapes and documentary. His earliest photographic work was &quot;People in Compostela&quot;, a photographic essay about the Galician capital Santiago de Compostela (1996–1999). This was followed by a series on the Galician coast (1999) and subsequently on the December 2002 political demonstrations in Santiago de Caompostela. His SO2 project linked the Berlin Alexanderplatz communications tower and a depopulated village in rural Galicia.

He has been writing about Galician society since 1994 and in 2001, published a collection of essays under the title Wildliza.

His work as a filmmaker has been closely linked to his activities as a political campaigner on the environmental and political issues raised by the 2002 Prestige oil spill, a marine environmental disaster on a scale exceeding the Exxon Valdez incident. His most well-known film is &quot;Awaking of the Nightmare&quot;[sic] (&quot;1-12-2002. A manifestación: O espertar do sono&quot;), about the great Galician nationalist and environmentalist protest rally on 1 December 2002.

He campaigns for economic development and grassroots artistic activity in rural Galicia and in particular provision of comprehensive rural broadband access as an instrument of social cohesion. He publishes a &quot;gueblo&quot; (blog) in which he is strongly critical of the poverty and political and economic inequalities of rural Galicia and the harsh impact of economic migration. He is particularly critical of the persistence of &quot;caciquismo&quot; – the control exercised by powerful local figures over the political process in rural areas. He stood in the 2008 elections as candidate for the Partido Obreiro Socialista Internacionalista (POSI) to represent the province of Lugo – a province described as ridden with &quot;caciquismo&quot; – in the Spanish Senate. He is also a pioneer of podcasting in the Galego language.

<text>Dambulla ( &quot;Dam̆bulla&quot;, &quot;Tampuḷḷai&quot;) is a city situated in the north of Matale District, in Sri Lanka&#x27;s Central Province. It is the second largest populated and urbanised centre after Matale in the Matale District. It is situated north-east of Colombo, north of Matale and north of Kandy. Due to its location at a major junction, it is the centre of major vegetable distribution in the country.

Major attractions of the area include the largest and best preserved cave temple complex of Sri Lanka, sigiriya rock fortress located in the division and the Rangiri Dambulla International Stadium, famous for being built in just 167 days. The area also boasts the largest rose quartz mountain range in South Asia, and the Iron wood forest, or Na Uyana Aranya.

Ibbankatuwa prehistoric burial site near Dambulla cave temple complexes is the latest archaeological site of significant historical importance found in Dambulla, which is located within of the cave temples providing evidence of the presence of indigenous civilisations long before the arrival of Indian influence on the Island nation.

==History==

The area is thought to be inhabited from as early as the 7th to 3rd century BC. Statues and paintings in these caves date back to the 1st century BC. But the paintings and statues were repaired and repainted in the 11th, 12th, and 18th century AD. The caves in the city provided refuge to King Valagamba (also called &quot;Vattagamini Abhaya&quot;) in his 14-year-long exile from the Anuradhapura kingdom. Buddhist monks meditating in the caves of Dambulla at that time provided the exiled king protection from his enemies. When King Valagamba returned to the throne at Anuradapura kingdom in the 1st century BC, he had a magnificent rock temple built at Dambulla in gratitude to the monks in Dambulla.

At the Ibbankatuwa Prehistoric burial site near Dhambulla, prehistoric (2700 years old) human skeletons were found on scientific analysis to give evidence of civilisations in this area long before the arrival of Buddhism in Sri Lanka. Evidence of ancient people living on agriculture have been detected in this area for over 2700 years according to archaeological findings. (750 BC)

It was earlier known as Dhamballai and was ruled by Kings like Raja Raja Chola and Rajendra Chola during their tenure in the late 10th and early 11th centuries.

==Dambulla Cave Temple==
It is the largest and best preserved cave temple complex in Sri Lanka. The rock towers over the surrounding plains. There are more than 80 documented caves in the surrounding. Major attractions are spread over 5 caves, which contain statues and paintings. This paintings and statues are related to Buddha and his life. There are a total of 153 Buddha statues, three statues of Sri Lankan kings and four statues of god and goddess. The latter four include two statues of Hindu gods, Vishnu and Ganesh. The murals cover an area of 2,100 m2. Depictions in the walls of the caves include Buddha&#x27;s temptation by demon Mara and Buddha&#x27;s first sermon.

== Demographics ==

<doc id="369646" wikidata="Q2527484" url="?curid=369646" title="Automatic vehicle location">
<text>Automatic vehicle location (AVL or ~locating; telelocating in EU) is a means for automatically determining and transmitting the geographic location of a vehicle. This vehicle location data, from one or more vehicles, may then be collected by a vehicle tracking system to manage an overview of vehicle travel. As of 2017, GPS technology has reached the point of having the transmitting device be smaller than the size of a human thumb (thus easier to conceal), able to run 6 months or more between battery charges, easy to communicate with smartphones (merely requiring a duplicate SIM card from one&#x27;s mobile phone carrier in most cases) — all for less than $20 USD. 

Most commonly, the location is determined using GPS and the transmission mechanism is SMS, GPRS, or a satellite or terrestrial radio from the vehicle to a radio receiver. A single antenna unit covering all the needed frequency bands can be employed. GSM and EVDO are the most common services applied, because of the low data rate needed for AVL, and the low cost and near-ubiquitous nature of these public networks. The low bandwidth requirements also allow for satellite technology to receive telemetry data at a moderately higher cost, but across a global coverage area and into very remote locations not covered well by terrestrial radio or public carriers.
Other options for determining actual location, for example in environments where GPS illumination is poor, are dead reckoning, i.e. inertial navigation, or active RFID systems or cooperative RTLS systems. These systems may be applied in combination in some cases. In addition, terrestrial radio positioning systems using a low frequency switched packet radio network have also been used as an alternative to GPS based systems.

== Applications ==
Automatic vehicle locating is a powerful tool for managing fleets of vehicles such as service vehicles, emergency vehicles, and public transport vehicles such as buses and trains. It is also used to track mobile assets, such as non wheeled construction equipment, non motorized trailers, and mobile power generators. AVL is often utilized by government agencies, such as Public Safety and Parks and Recreation, to track the movement of patrol units, emergency responders, and field workers. 

Another purpose of tracking is to provide graded service or to manage a large driver and crewing staff effectively. For example, suppose an ambulance fleet has an objective of arriving at the location of a call for service within six minutes of receiving the request. Using an AVL system allows to evaluate the locations of all vehicles in service with drivers and other crew in order to pick the vehicle that will most likely arrive at the destination fastest, (meeting the service objective).

== Types of systems ==
=== Simple direction finding ===
Amateur radio and some cellular or PCS wireless systems use direction finding or triangulation of transmitter signals radiated by the mobile. This is sometimes called radio direction finding or RDF. The simplest forms of these systems calculate the bearing from two fixed sites to the mobile. This creates a triangle with endpoints at the two fixed points and the mobile. Trigonometry tells you roughly where the mobile transmitter is located. In wireless telephone systems, the phones transmit continually when off-hook, making continual tracking and the collection of many location samples possible. This is one type of location system required by Federal Communications Commission Rules for wireless Enhanced 911.

=== Former LORAN-based locating ===
Motorola offered a 1970s-era system based on the United States Coast Guard LORAN maritime navigation system. The LORAN system was intended for ships but signal levels on the US east- and west-coast areas were adequate for use with receivers in automobiles. The system may have been marketed under the Motorola model name &quot;Metricom&quot;. It consisted of an LF LORAN receiver and data interface box/modem connected to a separate two-way radio. The receiver and interface calculated a latitude and longitude in degrees, decimal degrees format based on the LORAN signals. This was sent over the radio as MDC-1200 or MDC-4800 data to a system controller, which plotted the mobile&#x27;s approximate location on a map. The system worked reliably but sometimes had problems with electrical noise in urban areas. Sparking electric trolley poles or industrial plants which radiated electrical noise sometime overwhelmed the LORAN signals, affecting the system&#x27;s ability to determine the mobile&#x27;s geolocation. Because of the limited resolution, this type of system was impractical for small communities or operational areas such as a pit mine or port.

=== Signpost systems ===
To track and locate vehicles along fixed routes, a technology called Signpost transmitters is employed. This is used on transit routes and rail lines where the vehicles to be tracked continually operated on the same linear route. A transponder or RFID chip along the vehicle route would be polled as the train or bus traverses its route. As each transponder was passed, the moving vehicle would query and receive an ack, or handshake, from the signpost transmitter. A transmitter on the mobile would report passing the signpost to a system controller. This allows supervision, a call center, or a dispatch center to monitor the progress of the vehicle and assess whether or not the vehicle was &quot;on schedule&quot;. These systems are an alternative inside tunnels or other conveyances where GPS signals are blocked by terrain.

=== Today&#x27;s GPS-based locating ===
The low price and ubiquity of Global Positioning System or GPS equipment has lent itself to more accurate and reliable telelocation systems. GPS signals are impervious to most electrical noise sources and do not require the user to install an entire system. Usually only a receiver to collect signals from the satellite segment is installed in each vehicle and radio or GSM to communicate the collected location data with a dispatch point.

Large private telelocation or AVL systems send data from GPS receivers in vehicles to a dispatch center over their private, user-owned radio backbone. These systems are used for businesses like parcel delivery and ambulances. Smaller systems which do not justify building a separate radio system use cellular or PCS data services to communicate location data from vehicles to their dispatching center. Location data is periodically polled from each vehicle in a fleet by a central controller or computer. In the simplest systems, data from the GPS receiver is displayed on a map allowing humans to determine the location of each vehicle. More complex systems feed the data into a computer assisted dispatch system which automates the process. For example, the computer assisted dispatch system may check the location of a call for service and then pick a list of the four closest ambulances. This narrows the dispatcher&#x27;s choice from the entire fleet to an easier choice of four vehicles.

Some wireless carriers such as Nextel have decided GPS was the best way to provide the mandated location data for wireless Enhanced 9-1-1. Newer Nextel radios have embedded GPS receivers which are polled if 9-1-1 is dialed. The 9-1-1 center is provided with latitude and longitude from the radio&#x27;s GPS receiver. In centers with computer-aided dispatch, the system may assign an address to the call based on these coordinates or may project an icon depicting the caller&#x27;s location onto a map of the area.

=== Sensor-augmented AVL ===
The main purpose of using AVL is not only to locate the vehicles, but also to obtain information about engine data, fuel consumption, driver data and sensor data from i.e. doors, freezer room on trucks or air pressure. Such data can be obtained via the CAN-bus, via direct connections to AVL systems or via open bus systems such as UFDEX that both sends and receives data via SMS or GPRS in pure ASCII text format. Because most AVL consists of two parts, GPS and GSM modem with additional embedded AVL software contained in a microcontroller, most AVL systems are fixed for its purposes unless they connect to an open bus system for expansion possibilities.

With an open bus system the users can send invoices based on goods delivered with exact location, time and date data where if connected to scale, RFID or barcode readers, can make a fairly good automated system to avoid human errors.

In countries with high prices on gasoline external fuel sensors are used to prevent cases of fuel theft.

=== Logbook functions ===
Another scenario for sensor functions is to connect the AVL to driver information, to collect data about driving time, stops, or even driver absence from the vehicle. If the driver/worker conditions is such as the hourly rates for driving and working outside is not the same, this can be monitored by sensors, by using iButton or other personal identification devices. Later by analyzing log-file it is possible to get reports on any kind of events, like stops, visited streets, speed limits violations, etc.

== Differentiating between automatic vehicle location and events activated tracking systems ==
It might be helpful to draw a distinction between vehicle location systems which track automatically and event activated tracking systems which track when triggered by an event. There is increasingly crossover between the different systems and those with experience of this sector will be able to draw on a number of examples which break the rule.

A.V.L (Automatic Vehicle Location)&lt;br&gt;
This type of vehicle tracking is normally used in the fleet or driver management sector. The unit is configured to automatically transmit its location at a set time interval, e.g. every 5 minutes. The unit is activated when the ignition is switched on/off.

E.A.T.S (Events Activated Tracking system)&lt;br&gt;
This type of system is primarily used in connection with vehicle or driver security solutions. If, for example a thief breaks into your car and attempts to steal it, the tracking system can be triggered by the immobiliser unit or motion sensor being activated. A monitoring bureau will then be automatically notified that the unit has been activated and begin tracking the vehicle.

Some products on the market are a hybrid of both AVL and EATS technology. However industry practice has tended to lean towards a separation of these functions. It is worth taking note that vehicle tracking products tend to fall into one, not both of the technologies.

AVL technology is predominantly used when applying vehicle tracking to fleet or driver management solutions. The use of Automatic Vehicle Location is given in the following scenario; A car breaks down by the side of the road and the occupant calls a vehicle recovery company. The vehicle recovery company has several vehicles operating in the area. Without needing to call each driver to check his location the dispatcher can pinpoint the nearest recovery vehicle and assign it to the new job. If you were to incorporate the other aspects of vehicle telematics into this scenario; the dispatcher, rather than phoning the recovery vehicle operative, could transmit the job details directly to the operative&#x27;s mobile data device, who would then use the in-vehicle satellite navigation to aid his journey to the job.

EATS technology is predominantly used when applying vehicle tracking to vehicle security solutions. An example of this distinction is given in the following scenario; A construction company owns some pieces of plant machinery that are regularly left unattended, at weekends, on building sites. Thieves break onto one site and a piece equipment, such as a digger, is loaded on the back of a flat bed truck and then driven away. Typically the ignition wouldn’t need to be turned on and as such most of the AVL products available wouldn’t typically be activated. Only products that included a unit that was activated by a motion sensor or GeoFence alarm event, would be activated.

Both AVL and EATS systems track, but often for different purposes.

== Special applications of automatic vehicle locating ==
Vehicle location technologies can be used in the following scenarios:

* Fleet management: when managing a fleet of vehicles, knowing the real-time location of all drivers allows management to meet customer needs more efficiently. Vehicle location information can also be used to verify that legal requirements are being met: for example, that drivers are taking rest breaks and obeying speed limits.
* Passenger Information: Real-time passenger information systems use predictions based on AVL input to show the expected arrival and departure times of public transport services.
* Asset tracking: companies needing to track valuable assets for insurance or other monitoring purposes can now plot the real-time asset location on a map and closely monitor movement and operating status. For example, haulage and logistics companies often operate trucks with detachable load carrying units. In this case, trailers can be tracked independently of the cabs used to drive them. Combining vehicle location with inventory management that can be used to reconcile which item is currently on which vehicle can be used to identify physical location down to the level of individual packages.
* Field worker management: companies with a field service or sales workforce can use information from vehicle tracking systems to plan field workers&#x27; time, schedule subsequent customer visits and be able to operate these departments efficiently.
* Covert surveillance: vehicle location devices attached covertly by law enforcement or espionage organizations can be used to track journeys made by individuals who are under surveillance

<text>Aristides Maria Pereira (; 17 November 1923 – 22 September 2011) was a Cape Verdean politician. He was the first President of Cape Verde, serving from 1975 to 1991.

==Biography==
Pereira was born in Fundo das Figueiras, on the island of Boa Vista. His first job was chief of telecommunications in Guinea-Bissau. From the late 1940s until Cape Verde&#x27;s independence, Pereira was heavily involved in the anti-colonial movement, organizing strikes and rising through the hierarchy of his party, the African Party for the Independence of Guinea and Cape Verde (&quot;Partido Africano da Independência da Guiné e Cabo Verde&quot;, known as PAIGC). In clandestine activity he often used the pseudonym Alfredo Bangura.

Although Pereira initially promised to lead a democratic and socialist nation upon becoming president, he compounded the country&#x27;s chronic poverty by crushing dissent following the overthrow of Luís Cabral, who was President of Guinea-Bissau and Pereira&#x27;s ally in the drive to unite the two Lusophone states. However, Cape Verde had a much better human rights record than most countries in Africa and was known as one of the most democratic (despite the restriction on party activity) because of the power delegated to local citizens&#x27; committees and his own government was able to cope with the drought that hit the country. Cape Verde is one of the few African countries that never had the death penalty, in fact it was banned in 1983. While Guinea-Bissau remained close to the Soviet Union, Cape Verde maintained a policy of non-alignment.

On November 14, 1980, a coup, led by João Bernardo Vieira, overthrew Cabral and replaced the one-party regime with a Military Junta. In response to this, Pereira and his Prime Minister, Pedro Pires, cut diplomatic relations with Guinea-Bissau, dissolved the PAIGC and replaced it with the African Party for the Independence of Cape Verde, removing the name of Guinea. Guinea-Bissau and Cape Verde restored bilateral relations in 1982, when Mozambican President Samora Machel managed to bring together the two leaders (Vieira and Pereira) in Maputo, and a Cape Verdean ambassador was sent to Guinea-Bissau in 1983.

Another major difference between the two countries was the difference between the political tranquility of Cape Verde, which would later become multiparty in an extremely peaceful way, and the constant authoritarianism and strong instability in Guinea-Bissau.

The country&#x27;s policies during Pereira&#x27;s rule tended toward Cold War nonalignment and economic reforms to help the peasantry. Pedro Pires served as prime minister for the duration of Pereira&#x27;s presidency.

After PAICV decided to introduce multiparty democracy in February 1990, Pereira stepped down as General Secretary of PAICV in July 1990 and was succeeded in that post by Pires. Pereira was the PAICV candidate in the February 1991 presidential election, but António Mascarenhas Monteiro defeated him by a large margin.

While hospitalized in Portugal, Pereira died on September 22, 2011. Rabil Airport on the Cape Verdean island of Boa Vista was officially renamed as Aristides Pereira International Airport in tribute to him on November 19, 2011. His widow, Carlina Pereira, the former First Lady and a leading figure in the country&#x27;s independence movement, died on December 11, 2011, at the age of 87.

<text>George William Lewis (March 10, 1882 – July 12, 1948) was the director of aeronautical research at the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA) until he retired in 1947. He taught at Swarthmore College from 1910 to 1917.

==Biography==
In 1910, Lewis graduated from Cornell University with a master&#x27;s degree in mechanical engineering and proceeded to teach at Swarthmore College until 1917. He became involved in aircraft engines, which led to his membership in NACA&#x27;s Power Plants Subcommittee. In 1919, he was appointed as NACA&#x27;s first executive officer. Five years later, he was named as the director of aeronautical research, a position he held until his retirement. During those years, Lewis was stationed in Washington, D.C., to handle many of NACA&#x27;s political and bureaucratic issues. At the same time, he oversaw research advancements and technical publications at NACA&#x27;s Langley Research Center. During his time as director, engineers at the Langley facility were responsible for numerous advancements in the understanding of aerodynamics. These achievements earned Lewis international renown, and NACA expanded from a few employees to several thousand during his tenure.

Dr. Hugh L. Dryden succeeded Lewis as the director of aeronautical research at NACA. The NASA John H. Glenn Research Center at Lewis Field in Cleveland, Ohio is partly named after him.

<text>Kimberly J. Ng (; born November 17, 1968) is an American executive best known for her work on Major League Baseball. She is the former general manager of the Miami Marlins. She was the first woman to serve as general manager of a team in the Big Four leagues in North America and the first person of East Asian descent to serve as general manager of an MLB team. She is currently an advisor for Athletes Unlimited Pro Softball.

A graduate of the University of Chicago, Ng played college softball. She then worked her way up in the front office of several Major League Baseball teams and became a vice president of the league. She was named the Marlins&#x27; general manager in 2020.

==Early life==
Ng was born in Indianapolis, Indiana, the first of five daughters, to Virginia and Jin Ng. Her father, an American of Cantonese Chinese descent, was a financial analyst, and her mother, Thailand-born of Chinese descent, was a banker. She attended elementary school in Fresh Meadows, Queens and junior high in Glen Cove, New York. Her interest in baseball started when she played stickball on the street in Queens and her father taught her about sports. She played tennis and softball at Ridgewood High School in Ridgewood, New Jersey and graduated in 1986. She graduated from the University of Chicago in 1990, where she played softball for four years and was named MVP infielder, and earned a B.A. in public policy. During her senior year at the University of Chicago, she served as president of the university&#x27;s Women&#x27;s Athletic Association.

==Career==

Ng began her career as an intern with the Chicago White Sox after graduating from the University of Chicago and her first project was to conduct research on Rule 5 draftees which took advantage of Ng&#x27;s love of statistics and analyzing scouting reports. She was hired full time in 1991 and became special projects analyst before being promoted to assistant director of baseball operations under then-GM Ron Schueler in 1995. In 1995 she became the youngest person, and the first woman, to present a salary arbitration case in the major leagues when she worked for the White Sox, regarding the case of pitcher Alex Fernandez, and won. Prompted by a desire to expand her networks and learn how executives from other clubs conducted business, Ng then worked in the offices of the American League in 1997, where she was director of waivers and records, reviewing all transactions.

In March 1998, she was recruited by general manager Brian Cashman to work for the New York Yankees as assistant general manager, becoming the youngest in the major leagues, at age 29, and the second woman ever to hold the position behind only Elaine Weddington Steward, who, in 1990, became the assistant general manager of the Boston Red Sox. Ng joined the Los Angeles Dodgers as vice president and assistant general manager in 2001. In 2003, Bill Singer was fired from his position as special assistant of the New York Mets after making drunken racist remarks against Ng at a hotel bar during general managers&#x27; meetings, including asking her &quot;Where are you from?&quot; and speaking in a mock Chinese accent.

In 2005, Ng was interviewed for the vacant position of Dodgers general manager. No woman had ever been a GM in any major sport. The Dodgers hired Ned Colletti as their GM, who immediately kept Ng on as his assistant. Between 2005 and 2020, Ng interviewed for the general manager position with at least five teams, including the Seattle Mariners, San Diego Padres, Anaheim Angels, and San Francisco Giants. On March 8, 2011, Ng announced that she was leaving the Dodgers to take on the position of senior vice president of baseball operations for Major League Baseball, where she would report to former Yankees and Dodgers manager Joe Torre.

===Marlins general manager===

On November 13, 2020, Ng was hired as general manager of the Miami Marlins. She became the first woman to become a general manager of a men&#x27;s team in the history of major North American sports, as well as the first female Asian-American and first East Asian-American general manager in MLB history. Upon being unveiled as the new Marlins&#x27; general manager, Ng received congratulatory messages from figures such as Michelle Obama, Billie Jean King, and Martina Navratilova. On September 30, 2023, with the Marlins&#x27; 7–3 win in Pittsburgh, the Marlins clinched their fourth postseason berth, making her the first woman GM in MLB history to lead a playoff team. It was the club&#x27;s first postseason appearance since 2020, although Ng&#x27;s team was immediately eliminated without a playoff win. In October, Ng declined to exercise her option for the 2024 season, reportedly because she learned the team sought to hire a president of baseball operations, which would have left her second in command in her department.

===Athletes Unlimited Softball League===
In July 2024, Ng joined the Athletes Unlimited Pro Softball as a senior advisor.

==Awards==
In 2014, &quot;Bleacher Report&quot; included Ng on its list of the 25 Most Powerful Women in Sports. In 2015, &quot;Forbes&quot; ranked Ng #13 on its list of the most influential minorities in sports and #5 on its list of the most powerful women in sports. In 2017, &quot;Adweek&quot; named Ng one of the most powerful women in sports.

Ng was selected for the inaugural 2021 Forbes 50 Over 50; made up of entrepreneurs, leaders, scientists and creators who are over the age of 50.

==Personal life==
Ng is married to Tony Markward, co-owner of Silas Wines in Oregon.

<doc id="369656" wikidata="Q229246" url="?curid=369656" title="Julia Domna">
<text>Julia Domna (; – 217 AD) was Roman empress from 193 to 211 as the wife of Emperor Septimius Severus. She was the first empress of the Severan dynasty. Domna was born in Emesa (present-day Homs) in Roman Syria to an Arab family of priests of the deity Elagabalus. In 187, she married Severus, who at the time was governor of the Roman province of Gallia Lugdunensis. They had two sons, Caracalla and Geta. A civil war over the Roman throne broke out in 193, and shortly afterwards Severus declared himself emperor. The war ended in 197 with the defeat of the last of Severus&#x27;s opponents.

As empress, Domna was famous for her political, social, and philosophical influence. She received titles such as &quot;Mother of the Invincible Camps&quot;. After the elder of her sons, Caracalla, started ruling with his father, she was briefly co-empress with Caracalla&#x27;s wife, Fulvia Plautilla, until the latter fell into disgrace. Following the death of Severus in 211, Domna became the first empress dowager to receive the title combination &quot;Pia Felix Augusta&quot;, which may have implied greater powers being vested in her than what was usual for a Roman empress mother. Her sons jointly inherited the throne, and she acted as mediator in the conflicts that arose between them. Caracalla had Geta killed later that year. 

Domna remained active in Caracalla&#x27;s court, accompanying her son on the military campaigns which occupied most of his reign. During his war against Parthia she lived at Antioch (present-day Antakya, Turkey). There she killed herself in 217, upon hearing of Caracalla&#x27;s assassination and the Severan dynasty&#x27;s loss of power. Her older sister Julia Maesa restored the family&#x27;s imperial status in 218.

== Family background ==
Julia Domna was born in Emesa (modern day Homs) in Syria around 160 AD
to an Arab family that was part of the Emesene dynasty. Her name, Domna, is an archaic Arabic word meaning &quot;black&quot;, referencing the nature of the sun god Elagabalus which took the form of a black stone. She was the youngest daughter of the high priest of Baal, Julius Bassianus, and sister to Julia Maesa. Through Maesa and her husband Julius Avitus, Domna had two nieces: Julia Soaemias and Julia Mamaea, the respective mothers of future Roman emperors Elagabalus () and Severus Alexander ().

Domna&#x27;s ancestors were priest kings of the temple of Elagabalus. The family had enormous wealth and was promoted to Roman senatorial aristocracy. Before her marriage, Domna inherited the estate of her paternal great-uncle Julius Agrippa, a former leading centurion.

=== Marriage ===
The &quot;Historia Augusta&quot;, a generally unreliable source, relates that, after losing his first wife around 186, politician Septimius Severus heard a foretelling of a woman in Syria who would marry a king. So Severus sought her as his wife. This woman was Domna. Bassianus accepted Severus&#x27; marriage proposal in early 187, and in the summer the couple married in Lugdunum (modern-day Lyon, France), of which Severus was the governor. The marriage proved happy, and Severus cherished Domna and her political opinions. Domna built &quot;the most splendid reputation&quot; by applying herself to letters and philosophy. She gave birth to their two sons, Lucius Septimius Bassianus in 188 in Lugdunum, and Publius Septimius Geta the following year in Rome.

== Civil war==

After the Roman emperor Commodus was murdered without an heir in 192, many contenders rushed for the throne, including Domna&#x27;s husband Severus. An elder senator, Pertinax, was appointed by the Praetorian Guard as the new emperor of Rome. But when Pertinax would not meet the Guard&#x27;s demands, he too was murdered. Another politician, Didius Julianus, was called to Rome and appointed emperor. Severus, coming from the north into Rome, overthrew Julianus and had him executed. 

Severus claimed the title of emperor in 193. By offering Clodius Albinus, a powerful governor of Britannia, the rank of Caesar (successor), Severus could focus on his other rival to the throne, Pescennius Niger, whom he defeated at the Battle of Issus in 194. When afterwards Severus openly declared his son Caracalla as his successor, Clodius Albinus was hailed emperor by his troops. At the Battle of Lugdunum in 197, Severus defeated and killed Albinus, establishing himself as Emperor. Thus, Domna became Empress-consort.

== Power and influence ==

Unlike most imperial wives, Domna remarkably accompanied her husband on his military campaigns and stayed in camp with the army. As worded by Barbara Levick, Domna &quot;was to exceed all other empresses in the number and variety of her official titles.&quot; Honorary titles were granted to Domna similar to those given to Faustina the Younger, including &quot;Mother of the Invincible Camps&quot;, and &quot;Mater Augustus&quot; (Mother of Augustus). She was respected and viewed positively for most of her tenure, as indicated by coins minted with her portrait that mention her titles or simply refer to her as &quot;Julia Augusta&quot;. The title &quot;Pia Felix Augusta&quot; () which she received after Severus&#x27; death was &quot;perhaps a way of implying that Domna had absorbed and was continuing her husband&#x27;s attributes&quot; after his death.

Several medallions for Domna were issued by Severus as early as 207, on the reverses of which is &quot;Vesta Mater&quot; (Mother Vesta), which, according to Molly M. Lindner, &quot;could refer to an invocation to Vesta during prayers and supplications that the Vestal Virgins made whenever they prayed publicly&quot;. According to Lindner,
== Transition of power ==
When Severus died in 211 in Eboracum (York), Domna became the mediator between their two sons, Caracalla and Geta, who were supposed to rule as joint emperors, according to their father&#x27;s wishes expressed in his will. However, the two young men had a discordant relationship, and Geta was murdered by Caracalla&#x27;s soldiers in December of the same year. Geta&#x27;s name was then removed from inscriptions and his image erased as the result of a &quot;damnatio memoriae&quot;. As explained by Caillan Davenport:
=== Death ===

In 217, Caracalla began a new war with Parthia. Domna went with Caracalla as far as Antioch. There she stayed, helping to deal with his correspondence, while he went on to the frontier. During the campaign, Caracalla was assassinated by a Roman soldier. Domna chose to commit suicide after hearing about the rebellion, perhaps a decision hastened by the fact that she was suffering from breast cancer, as well as a reluctance to return to private life. Her sister, Julia Maesa, restored the Severan dynasty in 218. Domna&#x27;s body was brought to Rome and placed in the &quot;Sepulcrum C. et L. Caesaris&quot; (perhaps a separate chamber in the Mausoleum of Augustus). Later, however, both her bones and those of Geta were transferred by Maesa to the Mausoleum of Hadrian.

== Legacy ==
Domna encouraged Philostratus to write the &quot;Life of Apollonius of Tyana&quot;, but is thought to have died before he finished the eight-volume work. She also influenced Roman fashion: the hairstyle that she used would later be worn by Roman empress Cornelia Salonina and Palmyran queen Zenobia. Domna seems to have made the wearing of wigs, a custom of Assyrians, popular among Romans.

The scholar C.T. Mallan remarks upon the analysis of Domna&#x27;s career given by Cassius Dio, a contemporary observer who &quot;held the former Augusta in high esteem&quot;: &quot;Dio concludes that Julia&#x27;s life was ultimately an unhappy one, a life without pleasure or enduring good fortune... [it] is noteworthy, and perhaps significant that the only other individual to attract a similar eulogy in [Dio&#x27;s] &quot;Roman History&quot; was Marcus Aurelius&quot;. According to Mallan, Dio may have seen a parallel between Domna and Aurelius, both virtuous philosophers whose later lives were troubled by the bad character of their sons.

<doc id="369661" wikidata="Q1346101" url="?curid=369661" title="James Dyson">
<text>Sir James Dyson (born 2 May 1947) is a British inventor, industrial designer, farmer, and business magnate who founded the Dyson company. He is best known as the inventor of the bagless vacuum cleaner, which works on the principle of cyclonic separation. According to the &quot;Sunday Times&quot; Rich List 2023, he is the fifth-richest person in the United Kingdom, with an estimated family net worth of £23 billion. As of March 2024, &quot;Forbes&quot; lists Dyson&#x27;s net worth as $13.4 billion.

He served as the Provost of the Royal College of Art from August 2011 to July 2017, and opened a new university, the Dyson Institute of Engineering and Technology, on Dyson&#x27;s Wiltshire campus in September 2017.

==Early life and education==
James Dyson was born 2 May 1947 in Cromer, Norfolk, one of three children of Janet M. (&quot;née&quot; Bolton) and Alec William Dyson. He was named after his grandfather, James Dyson. His father died of prostate cancer when he was nine years old and he described his childhood home as &#x27;penniless&#x27; after his father&#x27;s death. He was nonetheless educated at Gresham&#x27;s School, an independent boarding school in Holt, Norfolk, from 1956 to 1965, due to the Headmaster agreeing to pay his school fees. At school he excelled at long-distance running, and said he learned determination from it.

Dyson spent a year, 1965–1966, at the Byam Shaw School of Art, choosing the school because of its excellent reputation under principal Maurice de Sausmarez&#x27;s leadership. Dyson credits de Sausmarez’s guidance and teaching with inspiring him to become a designer. In 2015 Dyson spoke at the opening of a retrospective exhibition of de Sausmarez&#x27;s work at the University of Leeds, speaking of the great influence the artist and former principal had on him and his career. 

He studied furniture and interior design at the Royal College of Art,1966–1970, before moving into engineering. It was while attending the Royal College of Art to study fine art that he transferred to industrial design, partly because of the tutorage of structural engineer Anthony Hunt.

==Early inventions==
In 1970, Dyson helped to design the Sea Truck while studying at the Royal College of Art. His first original invention, the Ballbarrow, was a modified version of a wheelbarrow using a ball instead of a wheel and was featured on the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Tomorrow&#x27;s World&quot; television programme. Dyson persisted with the idea of ball instead of wheel and invented the Trolleyball, a trolley that launched boats. He designed the Wheelboat which could travel at speeds of 64 kilometres per hour (40 mph) on land and water.

==Vacuum cleaners==
In the late 1970s, Dyson had the idea of using cyclonic separation to create a vacuum cleaner that would not lose suction as it picked up dirt. He became frustrated with his Hoover Junior&#x27;s diminishing performance: the dust bag pores kept becoming clogged with dust, which reduced suction. The cyclone idea came from a sawmill that used cyclone technology.

Partly supported by his wife&#x27;s salary as an art teacher, and after five years and about 5,127 prototypes, Dyson launched the &quot;G-Force&quot; cleaner in 1983. No manufacturer or distributor would handle his product in the UK, as it would have disturbed the market for replacement dust bags, so Dyson launched it in Japan through catalogue sales. Manufactured in bright pink, the G-Force sold for the equivalent of $2,000, or around $5,500 in 2023 taking inflation into account. It won the 1991 International Design Fair Prize in Japan. Dyson filed a series of patents for his dual cyclone vacuum cleaner EP0037674 in 1980, and when his invention was rejected by the major manufacturers, he set up his own manufacturing company, Dyson Ltd. In June 1993, he opened a research centre and factory in Malmesbury, Wiltshire.

Dyson&#x27;s slogan, &quot;say goodbye to the bag&quot;, proved attractive to the buying public. The Dyson Dual Cyclone became the fastest-selling vacuum cleaner ever made in the UK. It outsold those of some of the companies that had rejected his idea, and became one of the most popular brands in the UK. In early 2005, it was reported that Dyson cleaners had become the market leaders in the United States by value (though not by the number of units sold). Dyson licensed the technology in North America from 1986 to 2001 to Fantom Technologies, after which Dyson entered the market directly.

Following this success, other major manufacturers began to market their own cyclonic vacuum cleaners. In 1999, Dyson sued Hoover (UK) for patent infringement, and the High Court ruled that Hoover had deliberately copied a fundamental part of his patented designs in making its Triple Vortex bagless vacuum cleaner range. Hoover agreed to pay damages of £4 million.

In mid-2014, Dyson personally appeared in Tokyo to introduce his &quot;360 Eye&quot; robotic vacuum cleaner. The new model featured 360° scanning and mapping for navigation, cyclonic dust separation, a custom-designed digital motor for high suction, tank treads for traction, a full-width brushroll bar, and user interface via a free iOS or Android app.

Interviewed by &quot;Fast Company&quot; (May 2007), Dyson asserted the importance of failure in one&#x27;s life. &quot;I made 5,127 prototypes of my vacuum before I got it right. There were 5,126 failures. But I learned from each one. That&#x27;s how I came up with a solution. So I don&#x27;t mind failure. I&#x27;ve always thought that schoolchildren should be marked by the number of failures they&#x27;ve had. The child who tries strange things and experiences lots of failures to get there is probably more creative.&quot;

== Other inventions ==
In 2000, Dyson expanded his appliance range to include a washing machine called the ContraRotator, which had two rotating drums moving in opposite directions. The range was offered in bright colours, rather than the usual white or silver, although white versions came later. It was not a commercial success and was discontinued in 2005.

In 2002, the company created a model of the optical illusions depicted in the lithographs of Dutch artist M. C. Escher. Engineer Derek Phillips, after a year of work, created a water sculpture in which the water appeared to flow upwards to the tops of four ramps arranged in a square, before cascading to the bottom of the next ramp. Called &quot;Wrong Garden&quot;, the sculpture was displayed at the Chelsea Flower Show in 2003. The illusion was accomplished by having water containing air bubbles pumped to a slit at the top from which it cascaded down, making it appear that the water was flowing upwards.

In October 2006, Dyson launched a fast hand dryer, the Dyson Airblade, that used a thin layer of air as a squeegee to remove water from the skin, rather than using heat.
A fan without external blades called the Air Multiplier was launched in October 2009. Functions such as heating, air-purifying and humidifying were added later. 

In April 2016, Dyson launched a smaller and quieter hair dryer, the Dyson Supersonic.

==Research and development==

In 2017, Dyson spent £7 million a week on research and development of new products. The company is the UK&#x27;s biggest investor in robotics and artificial intelligence research, employing over 3,500 engineers and scientists, and engaging in more than 40 university research programmes. Speaking to the &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot;, Dyson said, “We’re looking at more non-domestic products but we are not rushing to do lots of different things,” he said. “We are a private company so we can do it when we are ready.”

In November 2014, Dyson announced plans to invest a further £1.5 billion into the research and development of new technology, including funding for an expanded campus at the Dyson UK headquarters in Malmesbury which will create up to 3,000 jobs.

The then Prime Minister David Cameron, said: &quot;Dyson is a great British success story and the expansion of the Malmesbury campus will create thousands of new jobs, providing a real boost to the local economy and financial security for more hardworking families. Investment on this scale shows confidence in our long-term economic plan to back business, create more jobs and secure a brighter future for Britain&quot;.

In March 2016, Dyson announced a second new multimillion-pound research and development centre on a former Ministry of Defence (MoD) site at Hullavington, Wiltshire. The company said it aimed to double its UK-based workforce in the next five or six years. Dyson said: &quot;After 25 years of UK growth, and continuing expansion globally, we are fast outgrowing our Malmesbury Campus. To win on the world stage you have to develop new technology and develop great products and that&#x27;s what we&#x27;re doing here.&quot;.

In September 2017, Dyson announced plans to produce an electric vehicle, aiming to be launched in 2020, investing £2 billion of his own money. He assembled a team of more than 400 people for the project. According to reports, the vehicle was intended to be powered by a solid-state battery, Dyson having acquired the battery company Sakti3 in 2015. In October 2019, Dyson announced that the electric car project had been cancelled due to it not being commercially viable.

In 2017, he launched the Dyson Institute of Engineering and Technology.

===Allegations of copyright infringement===
Dyson has several times accused Chinese spies and students of copying technological and scientific secrets from the UK through the planting of software bugs and by infiltrating British industries, institutions, and universities after they left. He also complained that China benefits from stealing foreign designs, flouting of product copyrights, and a two-speed patent system that discriminates against foreign firms with unreasonably longer times.

== Tax affairs ==

Dyson&#x27;s tax affairs have been subject to considerable scrutiny in the British press across the political spectrum.

=== Lux Leaks ===
Dyson publicly stated in 2008, &quot;I think it&#x27;s wrong to direct your business for tax reasons. Your business should be where you can do it best&quot;. However, in 2009, his company Dyson Ltd incorporated a new parent company in Malta to create £300 million and £550 million in intercompany loans via Luxembourg and Isle of Man companies that increased tax-deductible interest payments in the UK between 2009 and 2012. The creation of the additional UK tax-deductible interest payments relied on deals with the Luxembourg tax authorities revealed in the 2014 Lux Leaks. The Dyson group stated to &quot;The Guardian&quot; in 2014: &quot;At no time did the [group&#x27;s former] non-UK structure deliver any significant tax advantage and, of the entities in question, all have been dissolved&quot;.

=== Estimated tax contributions ===
In the 2022 Tax List published by &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; in January 2022, Dyson and his family were listed as 11th of the UK&#x27;s 50 biggest taxpayers. The newspaper estimated £101 million was contributed for the last full year on record. The IPPR think tank noted that only two of those listed in the 2021 &quot;Sunday Times&quot; Rich List – Dyson and the Weston family – were listed in that year&#x27;s Tax List. In the previous three years, Dyson had featured at 6th, 4th and 3rd in the &quot;Sunday Times&quot; Tax List, with the newspaper estimating a total contribution of £345.8 million to the UK exchequer. However the Tax List methodology includes the taxes paid by the businesses owned by the people listed rather than just the individual personal taxes paid, and so is not a measure of how much tax is paid by Dyson himself on his personal income. 

== Political views ==
===Pro-Eurozone===
In 1998, Dyson was one of the chairmen and chief executives of 20 FTSE 100 companies who signed a statement published in &quot;The Financial Times&quot; calling on the government for early British membership of the Eurozone. He claimed that failure to join the euro would lead to the destruction of the British manufacturing base. In February 2000 claiming that the strength of the pound was affecting his company&#x27;s profits on exports to France and Germany, Dyson threatened to shift focus from his Malmesbury plant to a new plant set up in Malaysia because the government would not join the euro. Later in 2000 Dyson again threatened to shift production abroad. In February 2002, Dyson announced that production was being shifted to the Far East. In August 2003, the assembly of washing machines was also switched from Malmesbury to Malaysia.

===Pro-Brexit===
Dyson was one of the most prominent UK business leaders to publicly support Brexit before the referendum in June 2016. Since the referendum, Dyson has stated that Britain should leave the EU Single Market and that this would &quot;liberate&quot; the economy and allow Britain to strike its own trade deals around the world. During 2016, 19% of Dyson Ltd exports went to EU countries, compared with 81% to non-EU countries. In 2017, Dyson suggested that the UK should leave the EU without an interim deal and that &quot;uncertainty is an opportunity&quot;. Previously, in 2014, Dyson had said he would be voting to leave the European Union to avoid being &quot;dominated and bullied by the Germans&quot;. In November 2017, Dyson was critical of the UK government Brexit negotiations and said &quot;we should just walk away and they will come to us&quot;. After it became public in January 2019 that Dyson&#x27;s company was to move its headquarters from Malmesbury to Singapore, he was accused of hypocrisy regarding his campaign for Brexit.

===European Court of Justice===
In November 2015, Dyson lost its case against EU energy labelling laws in the European General Court; however, a subsequent appeal in the European Court of Justice said that the previous ruling had &quot;distorted the facts&quot; and &quot;erred in law&quot;.

=== Criticism of Rishi Sunak policies ===
Dyson criticised Prime Minister Rishi Sunak in January 2023 for what he called &quot;ever higher tax bills&quot; for corporations. That May, Dyson said that Sunak had a &quot;scandalous neglect&quot; of the science and technology sector.

==Libel cases==
In 2022, Dyson sued Channel 4 and ITN over allegations of exploitation of workers at one of his suppliers&#x27; factories. In the High Court, it was ruled that there was no personal defamation.

In December 2023, Dyson unsuccessfully brought a libel claim against Mirror Group Newspapers in which he claimed that an opinion article published in the Daily Mirror in January 2022 criticising his company&#x27;s move to Singapore following his support of Brexit was &quot;highly distressing and hurtful&quot;.

==Philanthropy==

Dyson set up the James Dyson Foundation in 2002 to support design and engineering education. It is a registered charity under English law and operates in the UK, US, and Japan. The foundation aims to inspire young people to study engineering and become engineers by encouraging students to think differently and to make mistakes. The foundation supports engineering education in schools and universities, as well as medical and scientific research in partnership with charities. It achieves this by funding resources such as the &quot;Engineering Box&quot;, a box filled with activities for a school to use as a teaching aid.

In May 2014, the foundation announced an £8 million donation to create a technology hub at the University of Cambridge. The donation would also allow for a design and construction lab to be developed for undergraduate engineering students.

In March 2015, the foundation gave £12 million to Imperial College London to allow the purchase of a Post Office building in Exhibition Road from the Science Museum. Imperial College was to open the Dyson School of Design Engineering in this building, and teach a new four-year master&#x27;s degree in design engineering.

Around 2021, the foundation gave £4million towards the construction of a £27 million hub for cancer services at the Royal United Hospital, Bath, to be called the Dyson Cancer Centre. This followed a £500,000 donation to the Dyson Centre for Neonatal Care at the same hospital, which opened in 2011.

The foundation supports the work of young designers through the James Dyson Award, an international design award that &quot;celebrates, encourages and inspires the next generation of design engineers&quot;.

Dyson is also a trustee of The James and Deirdre Dyson Trust, a separate charity through which he and his wife make personal donations in various fields. In June 2019, the charity donated £18.75 million to Dyson&#x27;s old school, Gresham&#x27;s, to build a new STEAM Education building, which was completed in 2021. In November 2023, the charity made a further donation of £35 million to Gresham’s School to develop a prep school with a new building incorporating STEAM education facilities for pupils aged seven to 13.

<text>Ice milk, or iced milk, is a frozen dessert made with frozen dairy milk, but with less milk fat than regular ice cream. Ice milk is sometimes priced lower than ice cream.

In the United States, ice milk is defined as containing less than 10 percent milk fat and the same sweetener amount as ice cream. A 1994 change in United States Food and Drug Administration rules allowed ice milk to be labeled as &quot;non-fat ice cream&quot;, &quot;low-fat ice cream&quot;, or &quot;light ice cream&quot; in the United States (depending on its fat content). In Canada, ice milk is defined as containing 3%–5% milk fat content, while 5%–7.5% milk fat content would instead be considered &quot;light ice cream&quot;; a product with an undefined milk fat content would be defined simply as a &quot;frozen dairy dessert&quot;.

<doc id="369671" wikidata="Q618728" url="?curid=369671" title="Glenn Research Center">
<text>NASA John H. Glenn Research Center at Lewis Field is a NASA center within the cities of Brook Park and Cleveland between Cleveland Hopkins International Airport and the Rocky River Reservation of Cleveland Metroparks, with a subsidiary facility in Sandusky, Ohio. Its director is James A. Kenyon. Glenn Research Center is one of ten major NASA facilities, whose primary mission is to develop science and technology for use in aeronautics and space. , it employed about 1,650 civil servants and 1,850 support contractors on or near its site.

In 2010, the formerly on-site NASA Visitors Center moved to the Great Lakes Science Center in the North Coast Harbor area of downtown Cleveland.

==History==

The installation was established in 1942 as part of the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA) and was later incorporated into the National Aeronautics and Space Administration as a laboratory for aircraft engine research.

It was first named the Aircraft Engine Research Laboratory after funding was approved in June 1940. It was renamed the Flight Propulsion Research Laboratory in 1947, the Lewis Flight Propulsion Laboratory (LFPL) in 1948 (after George W. Lewis, the head of NACA from 1919 to 1947), and the NASA Lewis Research Center in 1958.

On March 1, 1999, the center was officially renamed the NASA John H. Glenn Research Center at Lewis Field, in honor of John Glenn, who was a fighter pilot, astronaut (the first American to orbit the Earth) and a politician.

As early as 1951, researchers at the LFPL were studying the combustion processes in liquid rocket engines.

== Facilities ==

===Neil A. Armstrong Test Facility===
The NASA John H. Glenn Research Center at the Neil A. Armstrong Test Facility or just Neil A. Armstrong Test Facility, formerly the NASA John H. Glenn Research Center at Plum Brook Station or just Plum Brook Station, in southern Erie County, Ohio, near Sandusky, is also part of Glenn (). It is located about from the main campus. It specializes in very large scale tests that would be hazardous on the main campus.

 the station consisted of five major facilities:
* B-2 Spacecraft Propulsion Research Facility
* Combined Effects Chamber
* Cryogenic Components Laboratory: slated for demolition
* Hypersonic Test Facility
* Space Power Facility

The Plum Brook Reactor was decontaminated and decommissioned under a 2008 cost-plus-fee contract valued at more than $33.5 million.

In 2019 the U.S. senators from Ohio, Rob Portman and Sherrod Brown, proposed to rename Plum Brook Station after Neil Armstrong. The legislation was signed into law on December 30, 2020, and Plum Brook Station was renamed the Neil A. Armstrong Test Facility.

====B-2 Spacecraft Propulsion Research Facility====

The B-2 Spacecraft Propulsion Research Facility is the world&#x27;s only facility capable of testing full-scale, upper-stage launch vehicles and rocket engines under simulated high-altitude conditions. The Space Power Facility houses the world&#x27;s largest space environment vacuum chamber.

=== Icing Research Tunnel ===
The icing Research Tunnel is a wind tunnel capable of simulating atmospheric icing condition to test the effect of ice accretion on aircraft wings and body as well as to test anti-icing systems for aircraft.

=== Zero Gravity Research Facility ===

The Zero Gravity Research Facility is a vertical vacuum chamber used for dropping experiment payloads for testing in microgravity. It enables the investigation of the behavior of components, systems, liquids, gases, and combustion when dropped in vacuum.

The facility consists of a concrete-lined shaft, in diameter, that extends below ground level. An aluminum vacuum chamber, in diameter and high, is contained within the concrete shaft. The pressure in this vacuum chamber is reduced to 13.3 newtons per square meter (1.3atm) before use.

The facility also includes a smaller drop tower with a free fall time of 2.2 seconds and a much lower cost per drop. It is used for the Dropping In Microgravity Environment (DIME) educational program.

The facility was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1985. It has been the world&#x27;s largest microgravity facility since the 2003 closing of the Japan Microgravity Centre.

==Developments==
===Aeronautics science and technology===
NASA Glenn does research and technology development on jet engines, producing designs that reduce energy consumption, pollution, and noise. The chevrons it developed for noise reduction appear on many commercial jet engines today, including those used on the Boeing 787 Dreamliner.

===Space science and technology===
The Glenn Research Center, along with companies it has hired, are credited with the following:
* The liquid hydrogen rocket engine, which Wernher von Braun called the critical technology that allowed the Apollo Moon landings.
* The Centaur upper-stage rocket
* The gridded ion thruster, a high-efficiency engine for spaceflight. A Glenn-derived ion engine was used on the NASA probe &quot;Deep Space 1&quot;.
* The Electrical Power System for Space Station Freedom. A slightly modified version is used on the International Space Station.
* The Universal Stage Adapter for the planned Block 1B iteration of the Space Launch System (SLS).

==Contributions==
NASA Glenn&#x27;s core competencies are:
* Air-breathing propulsion
* Communications technology and development
* Space propulsion and cryogenic fluids management
* Power, energy storage, and conversion
* Materials and structures for extreme environments

===Education===

The Glenn Research Center is home to the Lewis&#x27; Educational and Research Collaborative Internship Program (LERCIP). It provides internships for high school and college students and high school teachers. The high school program is an eight-week internship for sophomores and juniors with interests in science, technology, engineering, math, or professional administration. The college level consists of a 10-week internship and is open to college students at all levels. Only residents of the Cleveland area are eligible for high school LERCIP, but college LERCIP is open to students nationwide. Interns work closely with their NASA mentors and are involved in the daily activities of the center. They are expected to be available to work 40 hours a week for the duration of the internship. The LERCIP Teacher program is a 10-week internship for educators in STEM fields.

====Other====

The Dropping In Microgravity Environment is an annual contest held yearly by the center. Teams of high school students write proposals for experiments to be performed in the Drop Tower. The winners travel to the center, perform their experiments, and submit a research report to NASA.

==Future ==
After 2004, NASA had been shifting its focus towards space exploration as mandated by the Vision for Space Exploration. Because of this, it was perceived by some that regional NASA centers like Glenn, which focus on research and technology, were becoming more and more marginalized in terms of resources and relevance. However, on May 13, 2006, it was announced that NASA Glenn Research Center had secured management of the Crew Exploration Vehicle&#x27;s service module, which promised to generate billions of dollars and hundreds of jobs for the center. This work secured the center&#x27;s future in the near term, and signalled a shift in priority for the center from aeronautical research to space exploration, aligning itself closer with NASA&#x27;s new mission.

Another change of direction created uncertainty in 2010, however, when President Obama and Congress declared the end of the Vision for Space Exploration and sought to chart a new course for human space flight and NASA. However, the 2015 budget for NASA made substantial increases to projects in which the Research Center participates, such as aeronautics research, planetary science and space technology, and some of that funding was expected to flow down to the center.

==NASA Glenn Visitor Center==
The Visitor Center closed in September 2009 with many displays shifted to the Great Lakes Science Center, and new ones created there. This move was done to reduce the public relations budget and to provide easier access to the general public, especially the under-served community. It was hoped that putting the displays at the much more visited science center will bring the NASA Glenn facility more public exposure. In fact, this proved true: compared to the 60,000 visitors per year at its former site, the Glenn Visitor Center enjoyed 330,000 visitors in the first year at the Great Lakes Science Center. The new display area at the science center is referred to as the Glenn Visitor Center.

The NASA Glenn Research Center also offers public tours of its research facilities on the first Saturday of each month. Reservations must be made in advance.

<text>Located in the eastern part of Canada, and (from a historical and political perspective) part of Central Canada, Quebec occupies a territory nearly three times the size of France or Texas. It is much closer to the size of Alaska. As is the case with Alaska, most of the land in Quebec is very sparsely populated. Its topography is very different from one region to another due to the varying composition of the ground, the climate (latitude and altitude), and the proximity to water. The Great Lakes–St. Lawrence Lowlands and the Appalachians are the two main topographic regions in southern Quebec, while the Canadian Shield occupies most of central and northern Quebec.

With an area of , it is the largest of Canada&#x27;s provinces and territories and the tenth largest country subdivision in the world. More than 90% of Quebec&#x27;s area lies within the Canadian Shield, and includes the greater part of the Labrador Peninsula. Quebec&#x27;s highest mountain is Mont D&#x27;Iberville, which is located on the border with Newfoundland and Labrador in the northeastern part of the province in the Torngat Mountains. The addition of parts of the vast and scarcely populated District of Ungava of the Northwest Territories between 1898 and 1912 gave the province its current form.

The territory of Quebec is extremely rich in resources in its coniferous forests, lakes, and rivers—pulp and paper, lumber, and hydroelectricity are still some of the province&#x27;s most important industries. The far north of the province, Nunavik, is subarctic or Arctic and is mostly inhabited by Inuit.

The most populous region is the Saint Lawrence River valley in the south, where the capital, Quebec City, and the largest city, Montreal, are situated. North of Montreal are the Laurentian Mountains, a range of ancient mountains, and to the east are the Appalachian Mountains which extends into the Eastern Townships and Gaspésie regions. The Gaspé Peninsula juts into the Gulf of Saint Lawrence to the East. The Saint Lawrence River Valley is a fertile agricultural region, producing dairy products, fruit, vegetables, maple sugar (Quebec is the world&#x27;s largest producer of maple syrup), and livestock.

==Borders==
Quebec is bordered by the province of Ontario, James Bay and Hudson Bay (including the circular Nastapoka arc) to the west, the provinces of New Brunswick and Newfoundland and Labrador to the east and Hudson Strait and Ungava Bay to the north. Its northernmost point is Cape Wolstenholme. Quebec also shares a land border with four northeast states of the United States (Maine, New Hampshire, New York and Vermont) to the south. 

In 1927, the border between the Province of Quebec and the Dominion of Newfoundland was delineated by the British Judicial Committee of the Privy Council. The government of Quebec does not officially recognize the Newfoundland and Labrador–Quebec border. A border dispute remains regarding the ownership of Labrador. A maritime boundary also exists with the territories of Nunavut, Prince Edward Island and Nova Scotia. Quebec has officially more than of borders of all types. Half of these are land limits, 12% river limits and 38% marine limits.

==Topography==
Quebec&#x27;s highest point at is Mont d&#x27;Iberville, known in English as Mount Caubvick, located on the border with Newfoundland and Labrador in the northeastern part of the province, in the Torngat Mountains. The most populous physiographic region is the Great Lakes–St. Lawrence Lowlands. It extends northeastward from the southwestern portion of the province along the shores of the Saint Lawrence River to the Quebec City region, limited to the North by the Laurentian Mountains and to the South by the Appalachians. It mainly covers the areas of the Centre-du-Québec, Laval, Montérégie and Montreal, the southern regions of the Capitale-Nationale, Lanaudière, Laurentides, Mauricie. It includes Anticosti Island, the Mingan Archipelago, and other small islands of the Gulf of St. Lawrence lowland forests ecoregion. Its landscape is low-lying and flat, except for isolated igneous outcrops near Montreal called the Monteregian Hills, formerly covered by the waters of Lake Champlain. The Oka hills also rise from the plain. Geologically, the lowlands formed as a rift valley about 100 million years ago and are prone to infrequent but significant earthquakes. The most recent sedimentary rock layerswere formed as the seabed of the ancient Champlain Sea at the end of the last ice age about 14,000 years ago. The combination of rich and easily arable soils and Quebec&#x27;s relatively warm climate makes this valley the most prolific agricultural area of Quebec province. Mixed forests provide most of Canada&#x27;s springtime maple syrup crop. The rural part of the landscape is divided into narrow rectangular tracts of land that extend from the river and date back to settlement patterns in 17th century New France.

More than 95% of Quebec&#x27;s territory lies within the Canadian Shield. It is generally a quite flat and exposed mountainous terrain interspersed with higher points such as the Laurentian Mountains in southern Quebec, the Otish Mountains in central Quebec and the Torngat Mountains near Ungava Bay. The topography of the Shield has been shaped by glaciers from the successive ice ages, which explains the glacial deposits of boulders, gravel and sand, and by sea water and post-glacial lakes that left behind thick deposits of clay in parts of the Shield. The Canadian Shield also has a complex hydrological network of perhaps a million lakes, bogs, streams and rivers. It is rich in the forestry, mineral and hydro-electric resources that are a mainstay of the Quebec economy. Primary industries sustain small cities in regions of Abitibi-Témiscamingue, Saguenay–Lac-Saint-Jean, and Côte-Nord.

The Labrador Peninsula is covered by the Laurentian Plateau (or Canadian Shield), dotted with mountains such as Otish Mountains. The Ungava Peninsula is notably composed of D&#x27;Youville mountains, Puvirnituq mountains and Pingualuit crater. While low and medium altitude peak from western Quebec to the far north, high altitudes mountains emerge in the Capitale-Nationale region to the extreme east, along its longitude. In the Labrador Peninsula portion of the Shield, the far northern region of Nunavik includes the Ungava Peninsula and consists of flat Arctic tundra inhabited mostly by the Inuit. Further south lie the subarctic taiga of the Eastern Canadian Shield taiga ecoregion and the boreal forest of the Central Canadian Shield forests, where spruce, fir, and poplar trees provide raw materials for Quebec&#x27;s pulp and paper and lumber industries. Although the area is inhabited principally by the Cree, Naskapi, and Innu First Nations, thousands of temporary workers reside at Radisson to service the massive James Bay Hydroelectric Project on the La Grande and Eastmain rivers. The southern portion of the shield extends to the Laurentians, a mountain range just north of the Great Lakes–St. Lawrence Lowlands, that attracts local and international tourists to ski hills and lakeside resorts.

The Appalachian region of Quebec has a narrow strip of ancient mountains along the southeastern border of Quebec. The Appalachians are actually a huge chain that extends from Alabama to Newfoundland. In between, it covers in Quebec near , from the Montérégie hills to the Gaspé Peninsula. In western Quebec, the average altitude is about , while in the Gaspé Peninsula, the Appalachian peaks (especially the Chic-Choc) are among the highest in Quebec, exceeding .

==Hydrography==

Quebec has several notable islands, namely the numerous islands of the Hochelaga Archipelago that includes the Island of Montreal and Îles Laval which make up full or parts of the major cities of Montreal and Laval. Île d&#x27;Orléans near Quebec City, the sparsely populated Anticosti Island in the outlet of the Saint Lawrence River, and the Magdalen Islands archipelago in the Gulf of Saint Lawrence are other noteworthy islands.

Quebec has one of the world&#x27;s largest reserves of fresh water, occupying 12% of its surface. It has 3% of the world&#x27;s renewable fresh water, whereas it has only 0.1% of its population. More than half a million lakes, including 30 with an area greater than , and 4,500 rivers drain into the Atlantic Ocean, through the Gulf of Saint Lawrence and the Arctic Ocean, by James, Hudson, and Ungava bays. The largest inland body of water is the Caniapiscau Reservoir, created in the realization of the James Bay Project to produce hydroelectric power. Lake Mistassini is the largest natural lake in Quebec.

The Saint Lawrence River has some of the world&#x27;s largest sustaining inland Atlantic ports at Montreal (the province&#x27;s largest city), Trois-Rivières, and Quebec City (the capital). Its access to the Atlantic Ocean and the interior of North America made it the base of early French exploration and settlement in the 17th and 18th centuries. Since 1959, the Saint Lawrence Seaway has provided a navigable link between the Atlantic Ocean and the Great Lakes. Northeast of Quebec City, the river broadens into the world&#x27;s largest estuary, the feeding site of numerous species of whales, fish, and seabirds. The river empties into the Gulf of Saint Lawrence. This marine environment sustains fisheries and smaller ports in the Lower Saint Lawrence (&quot;Bas-Saint-Laurent&quot;), Lower North Shore (&quot;Côte-Nord&quot;), and Gaspé (&quot;Gaspésie&quot;) regions of the province. The Saint Lawrence River with its estuary forms the basis of Quebec&#x27;s development through the centuries. Other notable rivers include the Ashuapmushuan, Chaudière, Gatineau, Manicouagan, Ottawa, Richelieu, Rupert, Saguenay, Saint-François, and Saint-Maurice.

==Climate==

In general, the climate of Quebec is cold and humid. The climate of the province is largely determined by its latitude, maritime and elevation influences. According to the Köppen climate classification, Quebec has three main climate regions. Southern and western Quebec, including most of the major population centres and areas south of 51oN, have a humid continental climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Dfb&quot;) with four distinct seasons having warm to occasionally hot and humid summers and often very cold and snowy winters. 

The main climatic influences are from western and northern Canada and move eastward, and from the southern and central United States that move northward. Because of the influence of both storm systems from the core of North America and the Atlantic Ocean, precipitation is abundant throughout the year, with most areas receiving more than of precipitation, including over of snow in many areas. During the summer, severe weather patterns (such as tornadoes and severe thunderstorms) occur occasionally. Most of central Quebec, ranging from 51 to 58 degrees North has a subarctic climate (Köppen &quot;Dfc&quot;). Winters are long, very cold, and snowy, and among the coldest in eastern Canada, while summers are warm but very short due to the higher latitude and the greater influence of Arctic air masses. Precipitation is also somewhat less than farther south, except at some of the higher elevations. The northern regions of Quebec have an arctic climate (Köppen &quot;ET&quot;), with very cold winters and short, much cooler summers. The primary influences in this region are the Arctic Ocean currents (such as the Labrador Current) and continental air masses from the High Arctic.

The four calendar seasons in Quebec are spring, summer, autumn and winter, with conditions differing by region. They are then differentiated according to the insolation, temperature, and precipitation of snow and rain. In Quebec City, the length of the daily sunshine varies from 8:37 hrs in December to 15:50 hrs in June; the annual variation is much greater (from 4:54 to 19:29 hrs) at the northern tip of the province. From temperate zones to the northern territories of the Far North, the brightness varies with latitude, as well as the Northern Lights and midnight sun.

Quebec is divided into four climatic zones: arctic, subarctic, humid continental and East maritime. From south to north, average temperatures range in summer between and, in winter, between . In periods of intense heat and cold, temperatures can reach in the summer and during the Quebec winter, They may vary depending on the Humidex or Wind chill. The all time record high was and the all time record low was .

The all-time record of the greatest precipitation in winter was established in winter 2007–2008, with more than five metres of snow in the area of Quebec City, while the average amount received per winter is around three metres. March 1971, however, saw the &quot;Century&#x27;s Snowstorm&quot; with more than in Montreal to in Mont Apica of snow within 24 hours in many regions of southern Quebec. Also, the winter of 2010 was the warmest and driest recorded in more than 60 years.

==Wildlife==
The province is home to a wide variety of flora and fauna. The birdlife is diverse including wild turkey (&quot;Meleagris gallopavo&quot;), yellow-bellied sapsucker (&quot;Sphyrapicus varius&quot;) and loggerhead shrike (&quot;Lanius ludovicianus&quot;).

The large land wildlife is mainly composed of the white-tailed deer, the moose, the muskox, the caribou (reindeer), the American black bear and the polar bear. The medium-sized land wildlife includes the cougar, the coyote, the eastern wolf, the bobcat, the Arctic fox, the fox, etc. The small animals seen most commonly include the eastern grey squirrel, the snowshoe hare, the groundhog, the skunk, the raccoon, the chipmunk and the Canadian beaver.

Biodiversity of the estuary and gulf of Saint Lawrence River consists of an aquatic mammal wildlife, of which most goes upriver through the estuary and the Saguenay–St. Lawrence Marine Park until the &quot;Île d&#x27;Orléans&quot; (French for Orleans Island), such as the blue whale, the beluga, the minke whale and the harp seal (earless seal). Among the Nordic marine animals, there are two particularly important to cite: the walrus and the narwhal.
Inland waters are populated by small to large fresh water fish, such as the largemouth bass, the American pickerel, the walleye, the &quot;Acipenser oxyrinchus&quot;, the muskellunge, the Atlantic cod, the Arctic char, the brook trout, the &quot;Microgadus tomcod&quot; (tomcod), the Atlantic salmon, the rainbow trout, etc.

Among the birds commonly seen in the southern inhabited part of Quebec, there are the American robin, the house sparrow, the red-winged blackbird, the mallard, the common grackle, the blue jay, the American crow, the black-capped chickadee, some warblers and swallows, the common starling and the rock dove, the latter two having been introduced in Quebec and are found mainly in urban areas. Avian fauna includes birds of prey like the golden eagle, the peregrine falcon, the snowy owl and the bald eagle. Sea and semi-aquatic birds seen in Quebec are mostly the Canada goose, the double-crested cormorant, the northern gannet, the American herring gull, the great blue heron, the sandhill crane, the Atlantic puffin and the common loon. Many more species of land, maritime or avian wildlife are seen in Quebec, but most of the Quebec-specific species and the most commonly seen species are listed above.

Some livestock have the title of &quot;Québec heritage breed&quot;, namely the Canadian horse, the Chantecler chicken and the Canadian cow. Moreover, in addition to food certified as &quot;organic&quot;, Charlevoix lamb is the first local Quebec product whose geographical indication is protected. Livestock production also includes the pig breeds Landrace, Duroc and Yorkshire and many breeds of sheep and cattle.

The Wildlife Foundation of Quebec and the Data Centre on Natural Heritage of Quebec (CDPNQ) (French acronym) are the main agencies working with officers for wildlife conservation in Quebec.

==Vegetation==

Given the geology of the province and its different climates, there is an established number of large areas of vegetation in Quebec. These areas, listed in order from the northernmost to the southernmost are: the tundra, the taiga, the Canadian boreal forest (coniferous), mixed forest and deciduous forest.

On the edge of the Ungava Bay and Hudson Strait is the tundra, whose flora is limited to a low vegetation of lichen with only less than 50 growing days a year. The tundra vegetation survives an average annual temperature of . The tundra covers more than 24% of the area of Quebec. Further south, the climate is conducive to the growth of the Canadian boreal forest, bounded on the north by the taiga.
Not as arid as the tundra, the taiga is associated with the sub-Arctic regions of the Canadian Shield and is characterized by a greater number of both plant (600) and animal (206) species, many of which live there all year. The taiga covers about 20% of the area of Quebec. The Canadian boreal forest is the northernmost and most abundant of the three forest areas in Quebec that straddle the Canadian Shield and the upper lowlands of the province. Given a warmer climate, the diversity of organisms is also higher, since there are about 850 plant species and 280 vertebrates species. The Canadian boreal forest covers 27% of the area of Quebec. The mixed forest is a transition zone between the Canadian boreal and deciduous forests. By virtue of its transient nature, this area contains a diversity of habitats resulting in large numbers of plant (1000) and vertebrate (350) species, despite relatively cool temperatures. The ecozone mixed forest covers 11.5% of Quebec and is characteristic of the Laurentians, the Appalachians and the eastern lowlands forests. The third most northern forest area is characterized by deciduous forests. Because of its climate (average annual temperature of ), it is in this area that one finds the greatest diversity of species, including more than 1600 vascular plants and 440 vertebrates. Its relatively long growing season lasts almost 200 days and its fertile soils make it the centre of agricultural activity and therefore of urbanization of Quebec. Most of Quebec&#x27;s population lives in this area of vegetation, almost entirely along the banks of the Saint Lawrence. Deciduous forests cover approximately 6.6% of Quebec.

The forest area of Quebec is estimated at . From the Abitibi-Témiscamingue to the North Shore, the forest is composed primarily of conifers such as the balsam fir, the jack pine, the white spruce, the black spruce and the tamarack. Some species of deciduous trees such as the yellow birch appear when the river is approached in the south. The deciduous forest of the Great Lakes–St. Lawrence Lowlands is mostly composed of deciduous species such as the sugar maple, the red maple, the white ash, the American beech, the butternut (white walnut), the American elm, the basswood, the bitternut hickory and the northern red oak as well as some conifers such as the eastern white pine and the northern whitecedar. The distribution areas of the paper birch, the trembling aspen and the mountain ash cover more than half of Quebec territory.

<text>Lost in Translation is a 2003 romantic comedy-drama film written and directed by Sofia Coppola. Bill Murray stars as Bob Harris, a fading American movie star who is having a midlife crisis when he travels to Tokyo to promote Suntory whisky. There, he befriends another estranged American named Charlotte (Scarlett Johansson), a young woman and recent college graduate. Giovanni Ribisi, Anna Faris, and Fumihiro Hayashi are also featured. The film explores themes of alienation and disconnection against a backdrop of cultural displacement in Japan. It defies mainstream narrative conventions and is atypical in its depiction of romance.

Coppola started writing the film after spending time in Tokyo and becoming fond of the city. She began forming a story about two characters experiencing a &quot;romantic melancholy&quot; in the Park Hyatt Tokyo, where she stayed while promoting her first feature film, the 1999 drama &quot;The Virgin Suicides&quot;. Coppola envisioned Murray playing the role of Bob Harris from the beginning and tried to recruit him for up to a year, relentlessly sending him telephone messages and letters. While Murray eventually agreed to play the part, he did not sign a contract; Coppola spent a quarter of the film&#x27;s $4 million budget without knowing if he would actually appear for shooting. When Murray finally arrived, Coppola described feelings of significant relief.

Principal photography began on September 29, 2002, and lasted 27 days. Coppola kept a flexible schedule during filming with a small crew and minimal equipment. The screenplay was short and Coppola often allowed a significant amount of improvisation during filming. The film&#x27;s director of photography, Lance Acord, used available light as often as possible, and many Japanese places of business and public areas were used as locations for shooting. After 10 weeks of editing, Coppola sold distribution rights for the United States and Canada to Focus Features, and the company promoted the film by generating positive word of mouth before its theatrical release.

&quot;Lost in Translation&quot; premiered on August 29, 2003, at the Telluride Film Festival, and was distributed to American theatres on September 12, 2003, to major commercial success, grossing $118 million worldwide, and receiving critical acclaim, with praise for the performances of Murray and Johansson as well as the writing and direction of Coppola; minor criticism was given to the film&#x27;s depiction of Japan and Japanese people. At the 76th Academy Awards, &quot;Lost in Translation&quot; won Coppola Best Original Screenplay, and the film was also nominated for Best Picture, Best Director (Coppola), and Best Actor (Murray). Other accolades won include three Golden Globe Awards and three British Academy Film Awards.

==Plot==
Bob Harris is a fading American movie star who arrives in Tokyo to appear in lucrative advertisements for Suntory&#x27;s &quot;Hibiki&quot; whisky. He stays at the upscale Park Hyatt Tokyo and is miserable due to problems within his 25-year marriage and a midlife crisis.

Charlotte, another American staying at the hotel, is a young Yale graduate in philosophy who is accompanying her husband John while he works as a celebrity photographer. Charlotte is feeling similarly disenchanted as she questions her marriage and is anxious about her future. They both struggle additionally with bouts of jet lag and culture shock in Tokyo and pass the time loitering around the hotel, Charlotte also trying &quot;ikebana&quot; by chance.

Charlotte is repelled by a vacuous Hollywood actress named Kelly, who is also at the hotel promoting a film. Kelly bumps into Charlotte and John, gushing over photography sessions she has previously done with him. Bob and Charlotte frequently cross paths in the hotel and eventually introduce themselves to each other in the hotel bar.

After several encounters, when John is on assignment outside Tokyo, Charlotte invites Bob into the city to meet some local friends. They bond over an evening in Tokyo, where they experience the city nightlife together and end up singing at a karaoke box. In the days that follow, Bob and Charlotte spend more time together, and their friendship strengthens. One night while watching television and drinking &quot;sake&quot;, while neither can sleep, the two share an intimate conversation about Charlotte&#x27;s personal uncertainties and their married lives.

Bob has a cold conversation with his wife, then spends the night with a jazz singer from the hotel bar. Charlotte hears the woman singing in Bob&#x27;s room the next morning, leading to tension between Bob and Charlotte during a &quot;shabu-shabu&quot; lunch together later that day. The pair re-encounter each other in the evening and Bob reveals that he will be leaving Tokyo the following day.

Bob and Charlotte reconcile and express how they will miss each other, making a final visit to the hotel bar. The next morning, when Bob is leaving the hotel, he and Charlotte share sincere but unsatisfactory goodbyes. On Bob&#x27;s taxi ride to the airport, he sees Charlotte on a crowded street, stops the car, and walks to her. He then embraces her and whispers something in her ear. The two share a kiss and say goodbye before Bob departs, with Bob smiling for the first time.

==Analysis==

===Themes===

The film&#x27;s writer-director, Sofia Coppola, has described &quot;Lost in Translation&quot; as a story about &quot;things being disconnected and looking for moments of connection&quot;, a perspective that has been shared by critics and scholars. In a cultural sense, Bob and Charlotte are disoriented by feelings of jet lag and culture shock as a result of foreign travel to Japan. Bob is bewildered by his interactions with a Japanese commercial director whom he cannot understand, realizing that the meaning of his communication is &quot;lost in translation&quot; by an interpreter. Moreover, both are sleepless from a change in time zone, choosing to cope with their wakefulness by making late-night visits to the hotel bar. Such feelings provoke a sense of estrangement from their environment, but they also exacerbate deeper experiences of alienation and disconnection in their lives. Bob and Charlotte are both in troubled marriages and facing similar crises of identity, as Charlotte is unsure of what to do with her life and questions what role she should embrace in the world, while Bob is invariably reminded of his fading stature as a movie star and feels disassociated from the identity by which he is already defined.

Such experiences are heightened by the characters&#x27; contact with the city environment of Tokyo. Bob feels alienated by seeing his likeness used in an advertisement while he is driven from the airport to his hotel, and the colorful cityscape is rendered as a frenetic environment by which he is overwhelmed. Charlotte feels adrift as she attempts to find meaning while wandering Tokyo, and feels isolated as she peers over the city from her hotel room window. The Park Hyatt Tokyo offers hermetic qualities that insulate the characters from the city and is the site Bob chooses to seek refuge from his ails. These shared impressions of alienation create common ground for Bob and Charlotte to cultivate a personal connection. When Charlotte invites Bob to experience the Tokyo nightlife, she reduces his sense of distance from the city and the two develop a connection based on small moments together. In the little time they have together, each realize they are not alone in seeking a sense of something deeper in their lives. Coppola, speaking about the brief nature of their encounter, remarked, &quot;For everyone, there are those moments when you have great days with someone you wouldn&#x27;t expect to. Then you have to go back to your real lives, but it makes an impression on you. It&#x27;s what makes it so great and enjoyable.&quot;

Geoff King, a scholar who wrote a book about the film, comments that the experiences of the central characters are one factor that lends &quot;Lost in Translation&quot; to varied interpretations by academics. Todd McGowan reads the film from a Lacanian psychoanalytic perspective, arguing that the film encourages the embrace of &quot;absence&quot; in one&#x27;s life and relationships. He describes Coppola&#x27;s depiction of Tokyo &quot;as a city bubbling over with excess&quot;, which offers an empty promise of gratification. In his view, both Bob and Charlotte recognize that they cannot find meaning in Tokyo&#x27;s attractions, so they bond over their shared sense of emptiness in them. Lucy Bolton offers a feminist reading, arguing that &quot;Lost in Translation&quot; evokes the thought of feminist philosopher Luce Irigaray by highlighting issues of young womanhood. She argues that the film provides a complex portrait of Charlotte&#x27;s female subjectivity and an optimistic rendering of the character&#x27;s pursuit for individual expression.

===Narrative===
&quot;Lost in Translation&quot; has been broadly examined in terms of its narrative structure, with commentators noting that it contains few plot events as compared with films in the Hollywood mainstream. Narrative events are mostly focused on the development of Bob and Charlotte&#x27;s relationship, with few &quot;external&quot; obstacles that impact the central characters. King notes, &quot;More time is taken to evoke the impressions, feelings, and experiences of the central characters&quot;, which represents &quot;a shift in the hierarchical arrangement of [film elements]&quot; that prioritizes character experiences over plot. The literary critic Steve Vineberg argues that &quot;the links of the story are indeed there, only they&#x27;re not typical cause-and-effect connections. They&#x27;re formed by the emotions that gather at the end of one episode and pour into the next&quot;. King maintains that while the plot does progress according to a basic linear causality, &quot;If the episodic quality often seems to the fore, this is partly a matter of the pacing of individual sequences that are very often leisurely and dedicated to the establishment or development of mood and atmospherics&quot;. Coppola said she wanted the story to emphasize the qualities of an intimate moment, and she did not want to impose grandiose narrative devices on the characters such as &quot;a war keeping them apart&quot;.

&quot;Lost in Translation&quot; has also been noted for defying the conventions of mainstream romantic films. Film historian Wendy Haslem writes that the classic romantic comedy assures the audience that the couple has a future, but Coppola defies expectations by refusing to unite the central characters. She points to elements such as Bob and Charlotte&#x27;s lack of sexual consummation as one factor that obscures whether their pairing is more romantic or platonic. Writing about the concluding sequence in which the characters make their final goodbyes, Haslem argues, &quot;Conventionally in mainstream cinema, the kiss... signifies resolution by reinforcing the myth of romantic love. But in this new wave of contemporary anti-romance romance, the kiss signifies ambiguity.&quot; The academic Nicholas Y.B. Wong contends that the film&#x27;s lack of &quot;heart-melting connections and melodramatic (re)unions between characters&quot; represents a postmodern portrait of love, writing that &quot;Lost in Translation&quot; is &quot;about non-love, the predominance of affairs and the complexities of intimacy. Characters vacillate between falling in love and out of love. They are neither committed to someone nor emotionally unattached.&quot; Coppola said Bob and Charlotte&#x27;s relationship is &quot;supposed to be romantic but on the edge... [A] little bit more than friends but not an actual romance... To me, it&#x27;s pretty un-sexual between them—innocent and romantic, and a friendship.&quot;

===Opening shot===

The film&#x27;s opening shot, a 36-second take of Charlotte&#x27;s lower back and buttocks as she lies on a bed wearing semi-transparent pink panties and a gray sweater with white T-shirt underneath, as the credits begin to roll, has been another point of discussion among critics and scholars. It is based on the photorealist paintings of John Kacere and has often been compared to the initial appearance of Brigitte Bardot&#x27;s character Camille Javal in the 1963 film &quot;Contempt&quot;.

&quot;Slate&quot; critic David Edelstein called the scene the only &quot;head-scratcher&quot; in the film, which he otherwise appreciated:
It has been described as a foreshadowing of a romance between Bob and Charlotte, but other writers have a different interpretation. Correspondingly, the academic Maria San Filippo maintains that &quot;[Coppola] doesn&#x27;t seem to be making a statement at all beyond a sort of endorsement of beauty for beauty&#x27;s sake.&quot; King notes that the image contains both &quot;subtle&quot; and &quot;obvious&quot; appeal in its combination of aesthetic and erotic qualities, which signifies &quot;Lost in Translation&quot;″s position between mainstream and independent film.

While film scholar Todd Kennedy interprets it in terms of feminist film theorist Laura Mulvey&#x27;s conception of the male gaze, arguing that the shot &quot;lasts so long as to become awkward—forcing the audience to become aware of (and potentially even question) their participation in the gaze&quot;, other critics see it as inherently subverting the objectification of Charlotte. Haslem argues that &quot;Coppola&#x27;s intention with this opening shot appears to be to defy taboos and to undermine expectations surrounding what might be considered the &#x27;money shot&#x27; in more traditionally exploitative cinema.&quot; Bolton points out that Charlotte&#x27;s &quot;state of undress is not designed to be seen by anyone else, as she is alone in the room. Her solitary, meditative state de-sexualizes her appearance by naturalizing her appearance as the state of undress a woman would be likely to adopt if she was on her own.&quot; Fiona Handyside elaborates on Kennedy&#x27;s notion, that the stillness of the image reduces its voyeuristic appeal and &quot;the very weight of time pulls [Charlotte] from being pure empty iconic spectacle and into the material matter of history itself.&quot;

&quot;I don&#x27;t have a really good reason for it&quot;, Coppola said when asked to explain the shot. &quot;It&#x27;s just how I wanted to start the movie. I liked having a hint of the character—a sweet, young girl waiting around in her hotel room—and then go into the story&quot;. Suzanne Ferriss, a film scholar who has written extensively about Coppola&#x27;s work, notes that in the original screenplay, the film opened with Harris&#x27;s arrival and then went to Charlotte in the hotel. Due to this change, Coppola&#x27;s comment belies the complexity of the shot. Ferriss observes that the first 10 seconds lead the audience to believe it might be looking at a still, until Charlotte shifts her upper leg:

===Writing===

After dropping out of college in her early twenties, Coppola often traveled to Tokyo, trying out a variety of jobs in fashion and photography. Unsure of what to do for a career, she described this period as a &quot;kind of crisis&quot; in which she meandered around the city contemplating her future. She came to feel fond of Tokyo, noting an otherworldly quality brought on as a foreigner grappling with feelings of jet lag in an unfamiliar setting. After many years, she settled on a career in filmmaking and returned to the city, staying at the Park Hyatt Tokyo to promote her first feature film, the 1999 drama &quot;The Virgin Suicides&quot;.

Coppola began writing &quot;Lost in Translation&quot; after returning home from this press tour. Having been influenced by her background in Tokyo, she resolved to write a screenplay set there and began forming a story about two characters experiencing a &quot;romantic melancholy&quot; in the Park Hyatt Tokyo. Coppola was long attracted to the neon signs of the city and envisaged Tokyo taking on a &quot;dreamy feeling&quot; in the film. She recruited her friend Brian Reitzell, who ultimately served as the film&#x27;s music producer, to create dream pop compilation mixes that she listened to while writing to help establish this mood.

Coppola did not initially write the screenplay in traditional script form, citing the difficulty of mapping out a full plot. Instead, she opted to write &quot;little paragraphs&quot; largely based on disparate impressions and experiences of her life in Tokyo, which she then adapted to a script. Among the first images she included was of her friend Fumihiro Hayashi performing a karaoke rendition of the Sex Pistols&#x27; &quot;God Save the Queen&quot;, which Coppola saw him perform during the time she worked in Tokyo. After writing the first 20 pages with help from her brother, Roman Coppola, she returned to Tokyo for further inspiration. There, she videotaped anything she could use as a further writing aid.

Coppola envisioned Murray playing the role of Bob from the beginning, wanting to show off &quot;his more sensitive side&quot; and feeling amused by the image of him dressed in a kimono. She described her mental pictures of Murray as a significant source of inspiration for the story. For the character of Charlotte, Coppola drew from her own feelings of early-twenties disorientation, citing the strain in her relationship with her then-husband Spike Jonze as an influence for the relationship between Charlotte and John. She also drew inspiration from J. D. Salinger&#x27;s character Franny Glass in &quot;Franny and Zooey&quot;, finding appeal in &quot;the idea of a preppy girl having a breakdown&quot;.

As she developed the relationship between Bob and Charlotte, Coppola was compelled by the juxtaposition of the characters having similar internal crises at different stages of their lives. She cited the dynamic between Philip Marlowe (Humphrey Bogart) and Vivian Sternwood Rutledge (Lauren Bacall) in &quot;The Big Sleep&quot; as a source of inspiration for their relationship. Coppola reported doing little re-writing of the script, which took six months to complete and culminated in 75 pages, much shorter than the average feature film script. Despite worrying that the screenplay was too short and &quot;indulgent&quot; for including assortments of her personal experiences, she resolved to begin production of the film.

===Development===

Coppola maintained that she would not have made &quot;Lost in Translation&quot; without Murray. Murray had an 800 number for prospective clients interested in casting him, but he had a reputation as a recluse who was difficult to contact. Coppola relentlessly pursued him and sent telephone messages and letters for months. She also sought people in her professional network that might help her make contact. She recruited screenwriter Mitch Glazer, who was a longtime friend of Murray&#x27;s, to accept an early version of the script and try to persuade him. Glazer was impressed with the story and said he called Murray frequently, telling him, &quot;You need to read this&quot;, but he would not provide an answer. After up to a year of cajoling, Murray finally agreed to meet with Coppola at a restaurant to discuss the film. He then accepted the role, saying &quot;she spent a lot of time getting me to be the guy. In the end, I felt I couldn&#x27;t let her down.&quot;

Despite Murray&#x27;s agreement, Coppola had to take him at his word, as he did not sign a formal contract. She described this as &quot;nerve-wracking&quot;, wondering if he would show up for filming in Tokyo. She discussed the issue with director Wes Anderson, who had previously worked with Murray and encouraged her, saying, &quot;If he says he&#x27;s going to do it, he&#x27;ll show up.&quot; For Murray&#x27;s co-star, Coppola liked Johansson&#x27;s performance in &quot;Manny &amp; Lo&quot;, remembering her &quot;as a cute little girl with that husky voice&quot;. She then invited Johansson to a restaurant to discuss the role. Initially worried that the 17-year-old Johansson might be too young to play a character in her twenties, Coppola concluded that she appeared older and could convincingly play the part. Coppola offered Johansson the role without an audition, which she accepted.

Feeling a sense of personal investment in the project, Coppola wanted to maintain final cut privilege and feared that a distribution deal with a North American studio would threaten her influence. It was also unlikely that a studio would provide such backing, given the short length of the screenplay and Murray&#x27;s lack of formal involvement. Instead, she and her agent opted to sell foreign distribution rights to an assortment of companies to fund production costs of $4 million. She struck a deal first with Japan&#x27;s Tohokushinsha Film, then with distributors in France and Italy, and finally with the international arm of Focus Features for the remaining foreign market. By piecing together the funding from multiple distributors, Coppola reduced the influence of any single financier. Still not knowing if Murray would show up in Tokyo, Coppola spent $1 million of the budget, knowing that his absence would doom the production. When he finally arrived, days before filming, she expressed significant relief.

The idea for Bill Murray&#x27;s character doing an advertising campaign for Suntory came from Coppola&#x27;s father Francis Ford Coppola and director Akira Kurosawa&#x27;s Suntory Whiskey advertisement from the 1970s. In 2023 for Suntory&#x27;s 100th anniversary, and 20 years after the appearance of &quot;Lost in Translation&quot;, she was asked to direct the company&#x27;s anniversary tribute video starring Keanu Reeves, with a mix that included scenes from her film along with footage of her father and Kurosawa&#x27;s original advertisement.

===Filming===

Principal photography began on September 29, 2002, and lasted 27 days. With a tight schedule and a limited $4 million budget, filming was done six days per week, without permits, marked by a &quot;run-and-gun&quot; approach: Coppola was keen to stay mobile with a small crew and minimal equipment. She conducted few rehearsals and kept a flexible schedule, sometimes scrapping filming plans to shoot something she noticed on location if she thought it better served the story. Since the screenplay was sparse, missing details were often addressed during shooting, and Coppola allowed a significant amount of improvisation in dialogue, especially from Murray. One example includes the scene in which Bob is being photographed for Suntory whisky, wherein Coppola encouraged Murray to react to the photographer spontaneously as she whispered names for the man to repeat to Murray as unrehearsed dialogue, such as &quot;Roger Moore&quot;.

While key crew members were Americans that Coppola invited to Tokyo, most of the crew was hired locally. This proved to be challenging for the production, as most of the Japanese crew could not communicate with Coppola in English, so both sides relied on translations by a bilingual assistant director and a gaffer. The production encountered frequent delays while translations took place and suffered from occasional cultural misunderstandings, such as one example when Coppola described a shoot in a restaurant that ran 10–15 minutes late, something she said was normal on an American shoot, but it prompted the restaurant owner to feel disrespected; he subsequently disconnected the crew&#x27;s lights and the film&#x27;s Japanese location manager resigned. Despite this, Coppola said she worked to adapt to a Japanese style of filmmaking, not wanting to impose an approach that her crew was not used to.

Coppola worked closely to visualize the film with her director of photography, Lance Acord. She showed him and other key crew members a book of photographs she created that represented the visual style she wanted to convey in the film. To evoke a sense of isolation in Bob, Coppola and Acord used stationary shots in the hotel and avoided conspicuous camera movements. They also had numerous discussions about shooting on video, but they ultimately decided that film better suited the romantic undertones of the story. Coppola remarked, &quot;Film gives a little bit of a distance, which feels more like a memory to me. Video is more present tense&quot;. Acord believed that new film stocks would reduce the need for excessive lighting, ultimately using Kodak Vision 500T 5263 35 mm stock for night exteriors and Kodak Vision 320T 5277 stock in daylight. Most of the film was shot with an Aaton 35-III camera. For some confined locations where the Aaton would have been too noisy, a Moviecam Compact was used.

With high-speed film stocks, Acord chose to utilize available light as often as possible, only supplementing with artificial lights when necessary. He reported &quot;never really&quot; rigging lights for night exteriors, relying on the natural light on Tokyo&#x27;s city streets. For interior sequences in the Park Hyatt Tokyo, he relied mostly on the hotel&#x27;s practical lighting sources, shooting at a wide open f-stop and heavily cutting the light to eliminate reflections in the hotel window. Acord said he heard objections about lighting from some of the Japanese electricians, who were unaccustomed to relying so much on available light and were concerned that the exposure would not be sufficient. Acord, assured that the film stocks would hold up against lower lighting, ultimately shot much of the film two stops underexposed.

Many of the shooting locations were local places of business and public areas at the time of filming, including rooms, bar and swimming pool in the Park Hyatt Tokyo and Shibuya Crossing in Tokyo. Filming also took place at Jōgan-ji (Nakano, Tokyo). The opening scene was done at Yasukuni-dōri in Kabuki-chō. Charlotte&#x27;s ride at the subway was taken at Omote-sando Station at the Hanzōmon and Ginza lines platform. The chase scene after the bar and through the Pachinko parlor &quot;Botan&quot; were around Naka-Meguro Station. Brief scenes were also filmed in Kyoto at the Heian Shrine, and Nanzen-ji. The hospital scene was at the Tokyo Medical University. The last scene was done at Chūō-dōri (35°41&#x27;21.8&quot;N 139°41&#x27;50.3&quot;E) in Nishi-Shinjuku close to Shinjuku train station.

On public streets and subways, the production did not secure filming permits and relied on city bystanders as extras. Coppola described the shooting as &quot;documentary-style&quot; and was worried at times about getting stopped by police, so she kept a minimal crew. In the hotel, the production was not allowed to shoot in public areas until 1 or 2 a.m. to avoid disturbing guests. In the film&#x27;s concluding sequence in which Bob and Charlotte make their final goodbyes, Coppola reported being unhappy with the dialogue she had scripted, so Murray improvised the whisper in Johansson&#x27;s ear. Too quiet to be understandable, Coppola considered dubbing audio in the scene, but she ultimately decided it was better that it &quot;stays between the two of them&quot;. After production concluded, Coppola supervised 10 weeks of editing by Sarah Flack in New York City.

==Soundtrack==
The film&#x27;s soundtrack was released by Emperor Norton Records on September 9, 2003. It contains 15 tracks, largely from the shoegaze and dream pop genres of indie and alternative rock. The soundtrack was supervised by Brian Reitzell and contains songs from artists and groups including Death in Vegas, Phoenix, Squarepusher, Sébastien Tellier, and Happy End. The Jesus and Mary Chain&#x27;s song &quot;Just Like Honey&quot; and &quot;Sometimes&quot; by My Bloody Valentine featured, and four original tracks were written for &quot;Lost in Translation&quot; by the latter band&#x27;s frontman, Kevin Shields. Other tracks produced for the film include two co-written by Reitzell and Roger Joseph Manning Jr., and one by Air. Songs featured in the film that are not in the soundtrack include karaoke performances of Elvis Costello&#x27;s cover of &quot;(What&#x27;s So Funny &#x27;Bout) Peace, Love, and Understanding&quot; and the Pretenders&#x27; &quot;Brass in Pocket&quot;. A further performance by Murray of Roxy Music&#x27;s &quot;More Than This&quot; is included as a bonus track.

During the screenwriting stage, Coppola spoke to Reitzell about the &quot;moody&quot; and &quot;melancholic&quot; qualities she wanted the music to convey in the film, as well as what Reitzell understood to be the &quot;strange, floating, jet-lagged weirdness&quot; that would define the central characters. Coppola said she wanted the soundtrack &quot;to be less like a score&quot; and more like the dream-pop mixes Reitzell made to assist her writing of the film. While Shields had released little music since the release of &quot;Loveless&quot; in 1991, at Reitzell&#x27;s suggestion, he and Coppola enlisted him to help write original music for the film; Reitzell believed Shields &quot;could capture that droning, swaying, beautiful kind of feeling that we wanted.&quot; He then joined Shields in London for some two months of overnight recording sessions, and they used the screenplay and dailies from production as inspiration while they worked on songs for the film. Shields commented on the challenge he felt in songwriting for a film, saying &quot;I was barely aware of the language of music that&#x27;s not essentially just for your ears. ... In the end, just the physical movement of the film, that was a delicacy. And I suppose that&#x27;s why I ended up doing stuff that was so delicate.&quot;

King argues that music often plays the most significant role in setting mood and tone in the film, writing that it is substantial &quot;in evoking the dreamy, narcotised, semi-detached impressions of jet-lag&quot; as well as broader feelings of alienation and disconnection, &quot;making what is probably the largest single contribution to the widespread understanding of the film as a &#x27;mood piece&#x27;.&quot; He points to the use of &quot;Girls&quot; by Death in Vegas, featured in the early sequence in which Bob is driven from the airport to the hotel, arguing that it &quot;plays a role equal to if not dominating that of the visuals..., creating a drifting, ethereal and somewhat dreamy quality that precisely captures the impressions of temporal and spatial disjunction&quot;. He also points to the use of &quot;cool and distant&quot; tracks like &quot;Tommib&quot;, used in the extended sequence featuring Charlotte observing Tokyo while seated in her hotel room window, as playing a significant role in establishing feelings of isolation and disorientation in the character. In King&#x27;s view, some sequences feature combinations of music and visuals so as to function as &quot;audio-visual set pieces&quot;, which offer distinct points of appeal in the film for its target audience.

==Release==

===Marketing===
Coppola did not sell distribution rights for the United States and Canada until she and Flack finished editing the film. In February 2003, the director showed the film to top executives at the domestic arm of Focus Features, the company to which it had already sold most of the foreign distribution. The prior contract proved to be significant for Focus, as it received privileged access to the film while competing buyers complained that they were restricted to the viewing of a three-minute trailer in the Focus offices at the American Film Market. Coppola initially offered the domestic distribution rights for $5 million, but she decided to sell them to Focus for $4 million, citing her appreciation for the international deals the company had secured for the film.

Once Focus was involved, it began promoting the film by employing a conventional &quot;indie-style&quot; marketing campaign. The strategy involved generating positive word of mouth for the film well before its September 2003 release. The distributor arranged advance press screenings throughout the summer of 2003 and combined this with a magazine publicity campaign. Posters and trailers emphasized the recognizable star presence of Murray, highlighting his performance in the film&#x27;s comic sequences, which favored wider audience appeal. Immediately prior to its release, Focus placed &quot;Lost in Translation&quot; in film festivals and hosted &quot;intimate media screenings&quot; that included question-and-answer panels with Coppola and Murray. Many of these marketing tacks were designed to promote the film at minimal cost, a departure from more costly strategies often employed in the Hollywood mainstream, such as major television advertising.

===Theatrical run===
&quot;Lost in Translation&quot; had its premiere on August 29, 2003, at the Telluride Film Festival in the United States. Over the next week, it appeared at the 60th Venice International Film Festival and the 2003 Toronto International Film Festival. It opened to the public in limited release on September 12, 2003, at 23 theaters in major cities in the United States. The film had already generated speculation about Oscar contention from advance screenings and was noted for opening several weeks earlier than expected for an indie vying for awards—a risk being that opening too early might cause the film to be forgotten by the time nominations were made for major prizes like the Academy Awards. Focus Features co-presidents James Schamus and David Linde commented that the company chose an early release date on the basis of factors including the film&#x27;s quality and early marketing campaign, as well as a lack of competition from other films. The strategy was intended to give &quot;Lost in Translation&quot; more time to command the marketplace.
The film grossed $925,000 in its opening weekend and was expanded the next week from 23 theaters to 183 in the top 25 markets of the country. There, it grossed more than $2.62 million over the weekend and nearly paid off the total budget of the film. It entered wide release on October 3, its fourth weekend, peaking at a rank of seven in the box office chart; a week later, it expanded to an estimated 882 theaters, the film&#x27;s highest theater count over its run. &quot;Lost in Translation&quot; grossed an estimated to-date total of $18.5 million through October 13 and was noted by &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; to have been performing well even &quot;in smaller and medium-sized markets where audiences don&#x27;t always respond to this type of upscale material&quot;. Following this performance, &quot;Lost in Translation&quot; saw a gradual decline in theater presence progressing into the new year, though it was expanded again after the film received nominations for the 76th Academy Awards. The film was widened from a late December low of 117 theaters to an estimated 632 at the end of January, ultimately ending its run in the United States and Canada on March 25 and earning $44.6 million. Its international release earned $74.1 million, for a worldwide total of $118.7 million.

===Home media===
The DVD of &quot;Lost in Translation&quot; was released on February 3, 2004, and includes deleted scenes, a behind-the-scenes featurette, a conversation about the film featuring Murray and Coppola, and a music video for &quot;City Girl&quot;, one of the original songs composed for the film by Kevin Shields. Wanting to capitalize on the publicity surrounding &quot;Lost in Translation&quot;″s presence at the Academy Awards, Focus Features made the unusual move of releasing the film on home media while it was still screening in theaters, immediately after its Oscar nominations were announced. The strategy was seen as risky, as the industry was generally concerned that theatrical revenues could be harmed by early home video release. &quot;Lost in Translation&quot; ultimately earned nearly $5 million from its first five days of video rentals and sold one million retail copies during its first week of release. Early returns showed it was the second-best selling DVD during this period while the film screened in 600 theaters and box office revenues dropped 19% from the previous week, which &quot;Variety&quot; described as &quot;relatively modest&quot;. Focus credited the performance to positive word of mouth and cited the marketing for the film on both media as helpful for whichever platform consumers chose.

&quot;Lost in Translation&quot; was later released on the now-obsolete HD DVD format on May 29, 2007, and on Blu-ray on December 7, 2010. In June 2023, Kino Lorber announced it would release the film on Ultra HD Blu-ray, featuring a new 4K scan of the film.

==Reception==

===Critical response===
&quot;Lost in Translation&quot; received widespread critical acclaim, particularly for Murray&#x27;s performance and for Coppola&#x27;s direction and screenplay. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 95% based on 232 reviews, with an average rating of 8.4/10. The site&#x27;s critical consensus reads, &quot;Effectively balancing humor and subtle pathos, Sofia Coppola crafts a moving, melancholy story that serves as a showcase for both Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson.&quot; On Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating to reviews, the film has an average score of 91 out of 100 based on 44 reviews, indicating &quot;universal acclaim&quot;.

Critics widely praised Murray&#x27;s performance as Bob, commending his handling of a more serious role that was combined with the comic persona for which he was already broadly known. Edelstein argued that it was &quot;the Bill Murray performance we&#x27;ve been waiting for&quot;, adding that &quot;his two halves have never come together as they do here, in a way that connects that hilarious detachment with the deep and abiding sense of isolation that must have spawned it&quot;. Lisa Schwarzbaum of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; regarded Murray&#x27;s performance as Oscar-worthy and lauded it as his &quot;most vulnerable and unmannered&quot; to date; she praised his treatment of a more delicate role as well as his improvisations in the film&#x27;s comic sequences. Roger Ebert gave &quot;Lost in Translation&quot; four out of four stars and named it the second best film of the year, describing it as &quot;sweet and sad at the same time as it is sardonic and funny&quot;. &quot;The New York Times&quot; critic Elvis Mitchell had similar praise, calling &quot;Lost in Translation&quot; &quot;Mr. Murray&#x27;s movie&quot; and remarking that the actor &quot;supplies the kind of performance that seems so fully realized and effortless that it can easily be mistaken for not acting at all&quot;.

Coppola received a similar level of acclaim for her screenplay and direction. Kenneth Turan of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; commented that &quot;Lost in Translation&quot; was &quot;tart and sweet, unmistakably funny and exceptionally well observed—[which] marks... Coppola as a mature talent with a distinctive sensibility and the means to express it&quot;. Much of the praise was directed specifically at her attention to qualities of subtlety and atmosphere; David Rooney of &quot;Variety&quot; praised the film as &quot;a mood piece&quot;, adding that its &quot;deft balance of humor and poignancy makes it both a pleasurable and melancholy experience&quot;. Likewise, &quot;Salon&quot; critic Stephanie Zacharek lauded Coppola as a &quot;stealth dramatist&quot; whose understated narrative style made for an artful depiction of emotion; she praised &quot;Lost in Translation&quot; as an intimate story that marks Coppola as an exceptional filmmaker.

In his review for &quot;The New York Observer&quot;, Andrew Sarris called the film &quot;that rarity of rarities, a grown-up romance based on the deliberate repression of sexual gratification ... when independent films are exploding with erotic images edging ever closer to outright pornography, Ms. Coppola and her colleagues have replaced sexual facility with emotional longing, without being too coy or self-congratulatory in the process.&quot; &quot;USA Today&quot; gave the film three and a half stars out of four and wrote that it &quot;offers quiet humor in lieu of the bludgeoning direct assaults most comedies these days inflict&quot;. &quot;Time&quot;″s Richard Corliss praised Murray&#x27;s performance: &quot;You won&#x27;t find a subtler, funnier or more poignant performance this year than this quietly astonishing turn.&quot; His performance has been likened to the sardonic persona of W. C. Fields.
In his review for &quot;The Observer&quot;, Philip French wrote: &quot;While &quot;Lost in Translation&quot; is deeply sad and has a strongly Antonioniesque flavour, it&#x27;s also a wispy romantic comedy with little plot and some well-observed comic moments.&quot; In &quot;The Guardian&quot;, Joe Queenan praised Coppola&#x27;s film as &quot;one of the few Hollywood films I have seen this year that has a brain; but more than that, it has a soul.&quot; &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s Peter Travers gave it four out of four stars and wrote: &quot;Before saying goodbye, they whisper something to each other that the audience can&#x27;t hear. Coppola keeps her film as hushed and intimate as that whisper. &quot;Lost in Translation&quot; is found gold. Funny how a wisp of a movie from a wisp of a girl can wipe you out.&quot; J. Hoberman, in his review for the &quot;Village Voice&quot;, wrote: &quot;&quot;Lost in Translation&quot; is as bittersweet a brief encounter as any in American movies since Richard Linklater&#x27;s equally romantic &quot;Before Sunrise&quot;. But &quot;Lost in Translation&quot; is the more poignant reverie. Coppola evokes the emotional intensity of a one-night stand far from home—but what she really gets is the magic of movies&quot;.

Praise was also offered for Johansson&#x27;s performance as Charlotte; Rooney commented that she &quot;gives a smartly restrained performance as an observant, questioning woman with a rich interior life&quot;, and Turan added that Johansson &quot;makes what could have been an overly familiar characterization come completely alive&quot;.

&quot;Lost in Translation&quot; was listed as a best film of the year by more than 235 critics and has appeared on other &quot;best of&quot; lists in the years after its release. &quot;Paste&quot; ranked it number seven on its list of &quot;The 50 Best Movies of the 2000s&quot;, &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; ranked it number nine on its list of the decade&#x27;s top ten, and the film was ranked number 22 on a 2016 list of the BBC&#x27;s 100 Greatest Films of the 21st Century, based on a poll of 177 critics. In 2021, the Writers Guild of America ranked the film&#x27;s screenplay the 19th greatest of the 21st century so far.

The Los Angeles Film Critics Association voted Bill Murray best actor of the year at the 29th LAFCA Awards and the National Society of Film Critics also awarded Murray best actor at the 38th NSFC Awards. The New York Film Critics Circle also voted Murray best actor and Sofia Coppola best director at the 69th New York Film Critics Circle Awards. Coppola received an award for special filmmaking achievement from the National Board of Review at the 75th NBR Awards where the film also placed on their Top Ten Films list. &quot;Lost in Translation&quot; also appeared on several critics&#x27; top ten lists for 2003. Roger Ebert added it to his &quot;great movies&quot; list on his website. &quot;Paste Magazine&quot; named it one of the 50 Best Movies of the Decade (2000–2009), ranking it at #7. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; named it one of the best films of the decade, writing: &quot;Six years later, we still have no clue what Bill Murray whispered into Scarlett Johansson&#x27;s ear. And we don&#x27;t want to. Why spoil a perfect film?&quot; Director Quentin Tarantino included &quot;Lost in Translation&quot; in his list of top 20 films released since 1992, when his career as a filmmaker began.

===Accusations of racial stereotyping===
&quot;Lost in Translation&quot; received some charges of Orientalist racial stereotyping. The filmmaker E. Koohan Paik argued that its comedy is &quot;rooted in the &quot;otherness of the Japanese people&quot;, and that the story fails to offer balanced characterizations of the Japanese. Paik wrote that it is &quot;the shirking of responsibility to depict them as full human beings, either negative or positive, which constitutes discrimination, or racism&quot;. The artist Kiku Day wrote in &quot;The Guardian&quot;: &quot;There is no scene where the Japanese are afforded a shred of dignity. The viewer is sledgehammered into laughing at these small, yellow people and their funny ways.&quot;

Japanese distributors were concerned about how it would be received. The critic Yoshiro Tsuchiya of &quot;Yomiuri Shimbun&quot; wrote that Coppola&#x27;s representation of Japan was &quot;outrageously biased and banal&quot;. Perceptions of stereotyping also led to a campaign by an Asian-American organization that urged members of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences to vote against it at the 76th Academy Awards.

The film scholar Homay King argues that while the film does little to counter Orientalist stereotypes, it fails to establish the perspective from which Japanese representations are made, writing that &quot;the film [does not] sufficiently clarify that its real subject is not Tokyo itself, but Western perceptions of Tokyo... When Japan appears superficial, inappropriately erotic, or unintelligible, we are never completely sure whether this vision belongs to Coppola, to her characters, or simply to a Hollywood cinematic imaginary.&quot; King wrote that while depictions such as Charlotte&#x27;s alienation from experiences like ikebana are evidence that the film abstains from the Orientalist &quot;mythology of Japanese tradition as source of solace&quot;, the film often situates Japan as a source of &quot;difference&quot; for the characters by relying on crude jokes and stereotypes of Japanese people as &quot;crazy&quot; or &quot;extreme&quot;.

Coppola was surprised by the criticism, saying, &quot;I think if everything&#x27;s based on truth you can make fun, have a little laugh, but also be respectful of a culture. I just love Tokyo and I&#x27;m not mean-spirited ... I think that everything you do, people could be offended by — unless you&#x27;re just trying to be nice about everyone.&quot; She said the film &quot;came from experience&quot;, and gave the example of the confusion between L and R sounds, which appeared on the daily call sheets.

===Accolades===
&quot;Lost in Translation&quot; received awards and nominations in a variety of categories, particularly for Coppola&#x27;s direction and screenwriting, as well as the performances of Murray and Johansson. At the 76th Academy Awards, it won Best Original Screenplay (Coppola) and the film received three further nominations for Best Picture, Best Director (Coppola), and Best Actor (Murray). The film garnered three Golden Globe Awards from five nominations: Best Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy, Best Actor – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy, and Best Screenplay. At the 57th British Academy Film Awards, &quot;Lost in Translation&quot; won three awards: Best Actor in a Leading Role, Best Actress in a Leading Role (Johansson), and Best Editing (Flack).

&quot;Lost in Translation&quot; also received awards from various foreign award ceremonies, film festivals, and critics&#x27; organizations. These include Best American Film at the 58th Bodil Awards, Best Foreign Film at the 30th César Awards, and Best Foreign Film at the Film Critics Circle of Australia Awards 2004, French Syndicate of Cinema Critics Awards, and the German Film Awards, as well as the Nastro d&#x27;Argento for Best Foreign Director. The film also won Independent Spirit Awards for Best Film, Best Director, Best Actor and Best Screenplay at the 19th Independent Spirit Awards, as well as Best Film – Comedy or Musical, Best Actor – Comedy or Musical and Best Original Screenplay at the 8th Golden Satellite Awards, and two prizes at the Venice International Film Festival. From critics&#x27; organizations, &quot;Lost in Translation&quot; received a number of awards including Best Film and Best Actor at the San Francisco Film Critics Circle Awards 2003, Best Film, Best Actor and Best Screenplay (tied with Denys Arcand for &quot;The Barbarian Invasions&quot;) at the Toronto Film Critics Association Awards 2003, and Best Film at the Vancouver Film Critics Circle Awards 2003.

<text>A walkie-talkie, more formally known as a handheld transceiver, HT, or handheld radio, is a hand-held, portable, two-way radio transceiver. Its development during the Second World War has been variously credited to Donald Hings, radio engineer Alfred J. Gross, Henryk Magnuski and engineering teams at Motorola. First used for infantry, similar designs were created for field artillery and tank units, and after the war, walkie-talkies spread to public safety and eventually commercial and jobsite work.

Typical walkie-talkies resemble a telephone handset, with a speaker built into one end and a microphone in the other (in some devices the speaker also is used as the microphone) and an antenna mounted on the top of the unit. They are held up to the face to talk. A walkie-talkie is a half-duplex communication device. Multiple walkie-talkies use a single radio channel, and only one radio on the channel can transmit at a time, although any number can listen. The transceiver is normally in receive mode; when the user wants to talk they must press a &quot;push-to-talk&quot; (PTT) button that turns off the receiver and turns on the transmitter. Some units have additional features such as sending calls, call reception with vibration alarm, keypad locking, and a stopwatch. Smaller walkie-talkies are also very popular among young children. 

In accordance with ITU Radio Regulations, article 1.73, a walkie-talkie is classified as radio station/land mobile station.

== History ==

Handheld two-way radios were developed by the military from backpack radios carried by a soldier in an infantry squad to keep the squad in contact with their commanders. The Canadian inventor Donald Hings was the first to create a portable radio signaling system for his employer CM&amp;S in 1937. He called the system a &quot;packset&quot;, although it later became known as a &quot;walkie-talkie&quot;. In 2001, Hings received the Order of Canada for the device&#x27;s significance to the war effort. Hings&#x27; model C-58 &quot;Handie-Talkie&quot; was in military service by 1942, the result of a secret R&amp;D effort that began in 1940.

Alfred J. Gross, a radio engineer and one of the developers of the Joan-Eleanor system, also worked on the early technology behind the walkie-talkie between 1938 and 1941, and is sometimes credited with inventing it.

The first device to be widely nicknamed a &quot;walkie-talkie&quot; was developed by the US military during World War II, the backpacked Motorola SCR-300. It was created by an engineering team in 1940 at the Galvin Manufacturing Company (forerunner of Motorola). The team consisted of Marion Bond, Lloyd Morris, Bill Vogel, Dan Noble, who conceived of the design using frequency modulation, and Henryk Magnuski, who was the principal RF engineer. 

The first handheld walkie-talkie was the AM SCR-536 transceiver from 1941, also made by Motorola, named the Handie-Talkie (HT). The terms are often confused today, but the original walkie-talkie referred to the back mounted model, while the handie-talkie was the device which could be held entirely in the hand. Both devices used vacuum tubes and were powered by high voltage dry cell batteries.

Following World War II, Raytheon developed the SCR-536&#x27;s military replacement, the AN/PRC-6. The AN/PRC-6 circuit used 13 vacuum tubes (receiver and transmitter); a second set of thirteen tubes was supplied with the unit as running spares. The unit was factory set with one crystal which could be changed to a different frequency in the field by replacing the crystal and re-tuning the unit. It used a 24-inch whip antenna. There was an optional handset that could be connected to the AN/PRC-6 by a 5-foot cable. An adjustable strap was provided for carrying and support while operating.

In the mid-1970s, the United States Marine Corps initiated an effort to develop a squad radio to replace the unsatisfactory helmet-mounted AN/PRR-9 receiver and receiver/transmitter handheld AN/PRT-4 (both developed by the US Army). The AN/PRC-68, first produced in 1976 by Magnavox, was issued to the Marines in the 1980s, and was adopted by the US Army as well.

The abbreviation HT, derived from Motorola&#x27;s &quot;Handie-Talkie&quot; trademark, is commonly used to refer to portable handheld ham radios, with &quot;walkie-talkie&quot; often used as a layman&#x27;s term or specifically to refer to a toy. Public safety and commercial users generally refer to their handhelds simply as &quot;radios&quot;. Surplus Motorola Handie-Talkies found their way into the hands of ham radio operators immediately following World War II. Motorola&#x27;s public safety radios of the 1950s and 1960s were loaned or donated to ham groups as part of the Civil Defense program. To avoid trademark infringement, other manufacturers use designations such as &quot;Handheld Transceiver&quot; or &quot;Handie Transceiver&quot; for their products.

== Uses ==


Walkie-talkies are widely used in any setting where portable radio communications are necessary, including business, public safety, military, outdoor recreation, and the like, and devices are available at numerous price points from inexpensive analog units sold as toys up to ruggedized (i.e. waterproof or intrinsically safe) analog and digital units for use on boats or in heavy industry. Most countries allow the sale of walkie-talkies for, at least, business, marine communications, and some limited personal uses such as CB radio, as well as for amateur radio designs.

Walkie-talkies for public safety, and commercial and industrial uses may be part of trunked radio systems, which dynamically allocate radio channels for more efficient use of the limited radio spectrum. Such systems always work with a base station that acts as a repeater and controller, although individual handsets and mobiles may have a mode that bypasses the base station.

Walkie-talkies, thanks to increasing use of miniaturized electronics, can be made very small, with some personal two-way UHF radio models being smaller than a deck of cards (though VHF and HF units can be substantially larger due to the need for larger antennas and battery packs). In addition, as costs come down, it is possible to add advanced squelch capabilities such as CTCSS (analog squelch) and DCS (digital squelch) (often marketed as &quot;privacy codes&quot;) to inexpensive radios, as well as voice scrambling and trunking capabilities. Some units (especially amateur HTs) also include DTMF keypads for remote operation of various devices such as repeaters. Some models include VOX capability for hands-free operation, as well as the ability to attach external microphones and speakers.

Consumer and commercial equipment differ in a number of ways; commercial gear is generally ruggedized, with metal cases, and often has only a few specific frequencies programmed into it (often, though not always, with a computer or other outside programming device; older units can simply swap crystals), since a given business or public safety agent must often abide by a specific frequency allocation. Consumer gear, on the other hand, is generally made to be small, lightweight, and capable of accessing any channel within the specified band, not just a subset of assigned channels.

=== Military ===

Military organizations use handheld radios for a variety of purposes. Modern units such as the AN/PRC-148 Multiband Inter/Intra Team Radio (MBITR) can communicate on a variety of bands and modulation schemes and include encryption capabilities.

=== Amateur radio ===

Walkie-talkies (also known as HTs or &quot;handheld transceivers&quot;) are widely used among amateur radio operators. While converted commercial gear by companies such as Motorola are not uncommon, many companies such as Yaesu, Icom, and Kenwood design models specifically for amateur use. While superficially similar to commercial and personal units (including such things as CTCSS and DCS squelch functions, used primarily to activate amateur radio repeaters), amateur gear usually has a number of features that are not common to other gear, including:

* Wide-band receivers, often including radio scanner functionality, for listening to non-amateur radio bands.
* Multiple bands; while some operate only on specific bands such as 2 meters or 70 cm, others support several UHF and VHF amateur allocations available to the user.
* Since amateur allocations usually are not channelized, the user can dial in any frequency desired in the authorized band (whereas commercial HTs usually only allow the user to tune the radio into a number of already programmed channels). This is known as variable frequency operation (&quot;VFO&quot;) mode.
* Multiple modulation schemes: a few amateur HTs may allow modulation modes other than FM, including AM, SSB, and CW, and digital modes such as radioteletype or PSK31. Some may have TNCs built in to support packet radio data transmission without additional hardware.

Digital voice modes are available on some amateur HTs. For example, newer additions to the Amateur Radio service are Next Generation Digital Narrowband (NXDN) and Digital Smart Technology for Amateur Radio or D-STAR. Handheld radios with these technologies have several advanced features, including narrower bandwidth, simultaneous voice and messaging, GPS position reporting, and callsign routed radio calls over a wide-ranging international network.

As mentioned, commercial walkie-talkies can sometimes be reprogrammed to operate on amateur frequencies. Amateur radio operators may do this for cost reasons or due to the fact that Public Safety grade commercial gear is more solidly constructed and better designed than purpose-built amateur gear that is built to a price.

=== Personal use ===
The personal walkie-talkie has become popular also because of licence-free services (such as the U.S. FRS, Europe&#x27;s PMR446 and Australia&#x27;s UHF CB) in other countries. While FRS walkie-talkies are also sometimes used as toys because mass-production makes them low in cost, they have proper superheterodyne receivers and are a useful communication tool for both business and personal use. The boom in licence-free transceivers has, however, been a source of frustration to users of licensed services which are sometimes interfered with. For example, FRS and GMRS overlap in the United States, resulting in substantial pirate use of the GMRS frequencies. Use of the GMRS frequencies (USA) requires a license; however most users either disregard this requirement or are unaware. Canada reallocated frequencies for licence-free use due to heavy interference from US GMRS users. The European PMR446 channels fall in the middle of a United States UHF amateur allocation, and the US FRS channels interfere with public safety communications in the United Kingdom. Designs for personal walkie-talkies are in any case tightly regulated, generally requiring non-removable antennas (with a few exceptions such as CB radio and the United States MURS allocation) and forbidding modified radios.

Most personal walkie-talkies sold are designed to operate in UHF allocations, and are designed to be very compact, with buttons for changing channels and other settings on the face of the radio and a short, fixed antenna. Most such units are made of heavy, often brightly colored plastic, though some more expensive units have ruggedized metal or plastic cases. Commercial-grade radios are often designed to be used on allocations such as GMRS or MURS (the latter of which has had very little readily available purpose-built equipment). In addition, CB walkie-talkies are available, but less popular due to the propagation characteristics of the 27 MHz band and the general bulkiness of the gear involved.

Personal walkie-talkies are generally designed to give easy access to all available channels (and, if supplied, squelch codes) within the device&#x27;s specified allocation.

Personal two-way radios are also sometimes combined with other electronic devices; Garmin&#x27;s Rino series combine a GPS receiver in the same package as an FRS/GMRS walkie-talkie (allowing Rino users to transmit digital location data to each other) Some personal radios also include receivers for AM and FM broadcast radio and, where applicable, NOAA Weather Radio and similar systems broadcasting on the same frequencies. Some designs also allow the sending of text messages and pictures between similarly equipped units.

While jobsite and government radios are often rated in power output, consumer radios are frequently and controversially rated in mile or kilometer ratings. Because of the line of sight propagation of UHF signals, experienced users consider such ratings to be wildly exaggerated, and some manufacturers have begun printing range ratings on the package based on terrain as opposed to simple power output.

While the bulk of personal walkie-talkie traffic is in the 27 MHz and 400–500 MHz area of the UHF spectrum, there are some units that use the &quot;Part 15&quot; 49 MHz band (shared with cordless phones, baby monitors, and similar devices) as well as the &quot;Part 15&quot; 900 MHz band; in the US at least, units in these bands do not require licenses as long as they adhere to FCC Part 15 power output rules. A company called TriSquare is, as of July 2007, marketing a series of walkie-talkies in the United States, based on frequency-hopping spread spectrum technology operating in this frequency range under the name eXRS (eXtreme Radio Service—despite the name, a proprietary design, not an official allocation of the US FCC). The spread-spectrum scheme used in eXRS radios allows up to 10 billion virtual &quot;channels&quot; and ensures private communications between two or more units.

=== Recreation ===

Low-power versions, exempt from licence requirements, are also popular children&#x27;s toys such as the Fisher Price Walkie-Talkie for children illustrated in the top image on the right. Prior to the change of CB radio from licensed to &quot;permitted by part&quot; (FCC rules Part 95) status, the typical toy walkie-talkie available in North America was limited to 100 milliwatts of power on transmit and using one or two crystal-controlled channels in the 27 MHz citizens&#x27; band using amplitude modulation (AM) only. Later toy walkie-talkies operated in the 49 MHz band, some with frequency modulation (FM), shared with cordless phones and baby monitors. The lowest cost devices are very simple electronically (single-frequency, crystal-controlled, generally based on a simple discrete transistor circuit where &quot;grown-up&quot; walkie-talkies use chips), may employ superregenerative receivers, and may lack even a volume control, but they may nevertheless be elaborately decorated, often superficially resembling more &quot;grown-up&quot; radios such as FRS or public safety gear. Unlike more costly units, low-cost toy walkie-talkies may not have separate microphones and speakers; the receiver&#x27;s speaker sometimes doubles as a microphone while in transmit mode.

An unusual feature, common on children&#x27;s walkie-talkies but seldom available otherwise even on amateur models, is a &quot;code key&quot;, that is, a button allowing the operator to transmit Morse code or similar tones to another walkie-talkie operating on the same frequency. Generally the operator depresses the PTT button and taps out a message using a Morse Code crib sheet attached as a sticker to the radio. However, as Morse Code has fallen out of wide use outside amateur radio circles, some such units either have a grossly simplified code label or no longer provide a sticker at all.

In addition, Family Radio Service UHF radios will sometimes be bought and used as toys, though they are not generally explicitly marketed as such (but see Hasbro&#x27;s ChatNow line, which transmits both voice and digital data on the FRS band).

Some cellular telephone networks offer a push-to-talk handset that allows walkie-talkie-like operation over the cellular network, without dialing a call each time. However, the cellphone provider must be accessible.

=== Specialized uses ===

In addition to land mobile use, waterproof walkie talkie designs are also used for marine VHF and aviation communications, especially on smaller boats and ultralight aircraft where mounting a fixed radio might be impractical or expensive. Often such units will have switches to provide quick access to emergency and information channels. They are also used in recreational UTVs to coordinate logistics, keep riders out of the dust and are usually connected to an intercom and headsets

Intrinsically safe walkie-talkies are often required in heavy industrial settings where the radio may be used around flammable vapors. This designation means that the knobs and switches in the radio are engineered to avoid producing sparks as they are operated.

== Software emulation ==

A variety of mobile apps exist that mimic a walkie-talkie/push-to-talk style interaction. They are marketed as low-latency, asynchronous communication. The advantages touted over two-way voice calls include: the asynchronous nature not requiring full user interaction (like SMS) and it is voice over IP (VOIP) so it does not use minutes on a cellular plan.

Applications on the market that offer this walkie-talkie style interaction for audio include Hytera, Voxer, Zello, Orion Labs, Motorola Wave, and HeyTell, among others.

Other smartphone-based walkie-talkie products are made by companies like goTenna, Fantom Dynamics and BearTooth, and offer a radio interface. Unlike mobile data dependent applications, these products work by pairing to an app on the user&#x27;s smartphone and working over a radio interface.

== Accessories ==

There are various types of accessories available for walkie-talkies such as rechargeable batteries, drop-in rechargers, multi-unit rechargers for charging as many as six units at a time, and an audio accessory jack that can be used for headsets or speaker microphones. Newer models allow the connection to wireless headsets via Bluetooth. Some models also came up with the wifi integration such as Motorola XIRP 8600i series.

<text>In structural biology, a protein subunit is a polypeptide chain or single protein molecule that assembles (or &quot;coassembles&quot;) with others to form a protein complex.
Large assemblies of proteins such as viruses often use a small number of types of protein subunits as building blocks.

A subunit is often named with a Greek or Roman letter, and the numbers of this type of subunit in a protein is indicated by a subscript. For example, ATP synthase has a type of subunit called α. Three of these are present in the ATP synthase molecule, leading to the designation α3. Larger groups of subunits can also be specified, like α3β3-hexamer and c-ring.

Naturally occurring proteins that have a relatively small number of subunits are referred to as oligomeric. For example, hemoglobin is a symmetrical arrangement of two identical α-globin subunits and two identical β-globin subunits. Longer multimeric proteins such as microtubules and other cytoskeleton proteins may consist of very large numbers of subunits. For example, dynein is a multimeric protein complex involving two heavy chains (DHCs), two intermediate chains (ICs), two light-intermediate chains (LICs) and several light chains (LCs).

The subunits of a protein complex may be identical, homologous or totally dissimilar and dedicated to disparate tasks.
In some protein assemblies, one subunit may be a &quot;catalytic subunit&quot; that enzymatically catalyzes a reaction, whereas a &quot;regulatory subunit&quot; will facilitate or inhibit the activity. Although telomerase has telomerase reverse transcriptase as a catalytic subunit, regulation is accomplished by factors outside the protein.

An enzyme composed of both regulatory and catalytic subunits when assembled is often referred to as a holoenzyme. For example, class I phosphoinositide 3-kinase is composed of a p110 catalytic subunit and a p85 regulatory subunit. One subunit is made of one polypeptide chain. A polypeptide chain has one gene coding for it – meaning that a protein must have one gene for each unique subunit.

<text>Deals (previously stylized as DEAL$) was a chain of discount variety stores owned by Dollar Tree. The chain operated more than 221 stores located in shopping centers, malls (until 2015), and urban areas in 19 states throughout the United States.

Each store stocked a variety of products including national, regional, and private-label brands, and accepted manufacturers&#x27; coupons. Departments found in a Deals store included health and beauty, food and snacks, party, seasonal décor, housewares, glassware, dinnerware, household cleaning supplies, candy, toys, gifts, gift bags and wrap, stationery, craft supplies, teaching supplies, and books. The majority of Deals stores also sold frozen foods and dairy items such as milk, eggs, pizza, ice cream, frozen dinners, and pre-made baked goods.

==History==
Tom Holley owned the local Grandpa&#x27;s chain in St. Louis, which he sold in November 1999 to Value City so he could open additional Deal$ stores after the first few proved successful. It eventually evolved into a chain of 41 discount dollar stores located from Missouri to Ohio. Later acquired by SuperValu on May 20, 2002, Deal$ had grown to 53 stores. And finally by March 29, 2006, Dollar Tree, Inc. acquired all Deal$ stores from SuperValu Inc, now 138 outlets.

On March 1, 2016, Dollar Tree converted most of the company&#x27;s Deals stores into Dollar Tree stores. The conversion was done due to the parent company&#x27;s acquisition of Family Dollar. The remaining 5 Deals stores were converted to Family Dollar stores.

Since 2018, some Dollar Tree stores previously known as Deals locations, many located in the Northern United States, closed down.

==Website==
In 2013, Deals launched a full e-commerce website, &quot;deals-stores.com&quot;, to sell merchandise in both single items and larger quantities to individuals, small businesses, and organizations. The website was also used to advertise in-store events, specials, seasonal promotions, and featured products. As a part of its re-branding in 2016, it now redirects to Dollar Tree&#x27;s website.

<doc id="369707" wikidata="Q1864884" url="?curid=369707" title="Adjuntas, Puerto Rico">
<text>Adjuntas () is a small mountainside town and municipality in Puerto Rico located in the central midwestern portion of the island on the Cordillera Central, north of Yauco, Guayanilla, and Peñuelas; southeast of Utuado; east of Lares and Yauco; and northwest of Ponce. Adjuntas is spread over 16 &quot;barrios&quot; and Adjuntas Pueblo (the downtown area and the administrative center of the city). Adjuntas is about two hours by car westward from the capital, San Juan.

Adjuntas is nicknamed &quot;the Switzerland of Puerto Rico&quot; because of its relatively chilly weather. Many Puerto Rican mountain towns have cooler weather than the rest of the island; Adjuntas is no exception: the average yearly weather is 70 °F (21 °C) (High: 83 °F/28 °C; Low: 58 °F/14 °C). Puerto Rico&#x27;s lowest temperature were recorded in Adjuntas at 38 °F in 2018. Its mild climate attracts a good number of island tourists during the summer months. The town has a small hotel named Monte Rio and a good-sized &quot;parador&quot;, or country inn, called Villa Sotomayor.

Adjuntas&#x27; ZIP Code, 00601, is the lowest standard ZIP code in the United States ZIP code system.

== Etymology and nicknames ==

The name &quot;Adjuntas&quot; literally translates to &quot;attached&quot; in Spanish. The name is most likely a shortening of &quot;tierras &quot;adjuntas&quot; a Coamo&quot; or &#x27;lands &quot;attached&quot; (or &quot;in proximity&quot;) to Coamo&quot; as the territory was originally part of the lands of Villa de San Blas de Illescas, one of the oldest settlements in Puerto Rico, which the municipality gained autonomy from in 1739.

The municipality has received numerous nicknames throughout its history, such as &quot;La Ciudad del Gigante Dormido&quot;, Spanish for &quot;city of the sleeping giant&quot; after the mountain that overlooks the town; &quot;La Suiza de Puerto Rico&quot; (&quot;Puerto Rico&#x27;s Switzerland&quot;) due to its relative cool temperatures and mountainous terrain; and &quot;La Tierra de los Lagos&quot; (&quot;Land of the Lakes&quot;) after the many natural pools or &quot;charcas&quot; that are formed by the numerous rivers that flow through the municipality.

==History==
Although there are petroglyphs and traces of Taíno people in Adjuntas, there is no proof that the region was dominated by any specific cacique. Nearby caciques like Guarionex and Urayoán could have had some control over the area.

According to historian Aurelio Tió, during the Spanish colonization of Puerto Rico in the 16th century, it is believed that a Spanish interpreter called Juan González settled in the region. Also, historian Cayetano Coll y Toste wrote a legend about Spanish people looking for gold in the region of Adjuntas.

As colonization progressed, Adjuntas became part of the San Blas de Illescas (Coamo village), which was founded in 1579 and became the most important settlement in the south. It is believed that the name &quot;Adjuntas&quot; derives from the term of &quot;being close&quot; to Coamo. As population shifted to Ponce, Adjuntas became more linked to that town, and then to Utuado, being a barrio of this municipality in 1739.

With 20 families established in the region, the residents of Adjuntas asked for the settlement to be officially recognized. The town of Adjuntas was then founded on August 11, 1815, with Diego Maldonado being elected as its representative. A city hall and public square were built shortly after.

Adjuntas was one of the main cities where the Anusim, Maranos, and other Sephardi Jews settled in Puerto Rico.
After the mid-19th century, Adjuntas welcomed many immigrants from the Mediterranean islands Corsica and Majorca. Some of them established coffee plantations. During the last decades of the 19th century, the coffee produced in Adjuntas was exported to Europe, United States and even the Vatican.

Adjuntas was proclaimed a &quot;villa&quot;, or a first order municipality, by the Spanish Government Monarchy in 1894. Several years after, the town was occupied by the United States Army forces during the Spanish–American War of 1898 and was visited by President Theodore Roosevelt in 1906.

The discovery of rich deposits of copper, gold and other minerals during the 1960s motivated some local community and environmental leaders to oppose the mining. Casa Pueblo, a local community organization settled in Adjuntas, opposed to the mining and advocates for the preservation of natural resources in Puerto Rico.

In 1992, Southern Gold Resources, a US company, was granted permission to explore for gold in Adjuntas and Utuado, Puerto Rico.

Hurricane Maria on September 20, 2017, triggered numerous landslides all across Adjuntas, with its winds and significant amount of rain, 18.38 inches in Adjuntas. The hurricane winds and rain damaged infrastructure and the electrical system of Adjuntas collapsed leaving its over 18,000 residents with no electrical power. PR-10 which connects Adjuntas to Utuado collapsed by 9 feet, and according to the mayor of Adjuntas, 1500 homes were completely destroyed. Nearly 62% of the residents of Adjuntas were already living below the poverty level when Hurricane María hit Puerto Rico. The municipality was also affected by the 2020 earthquakes which caused landslides and power outages in the region.

===Folklore===

El Gigante Dormido (&quot;the sleeping giant&quot;) is a mountain (Cerro El Gigante) and panoramic view that resembles the shape of a man lying on his back, the profile of his face is reflected in the mountain ridges of Adjuntas. Legend says that many years ago a sole resident lived in the region, and he was a giant. The people wanted to live in those fertile lands, but they would observe the giant stretching his arms widely over the area, even peeping his head over the mountain peaks. A witch learned that to kill the giant she would have to hit him in his right eye with a poisoned arrow, which she did one day as he stood up. Being hit in the eye, the giant leapt in pain and fell flat on his back but not before punching the ground hard and that formed an area from where water foamed up. Eventually, the giant on his back became petrified in that position forming the panorama of the profile of his face.
