<text>The Sun Also Rises is the first novel by the American writer Ernest Hemingway. It portrays American and British expatriates who travel from Paris to the Festival of San Fermín in Pamplona and watch the running of the bulls and the bullfights. An early modernist novel, it received mixed reviews upon publication. Hemingway biographer Jeffrey Meyers writes that it is now &quot;recognized as Hemingway&#x27;s greatest work,&quot; and Hemingway scholar Linda Wagner-Martin calls it his most important novel. The novel was published in the United States in October 1926, by Scribner&#x27;s. A year later, Jonathan Cape published the novel in London under the title Fiesta. It remains in print.

The novel is a &quot;roman à clef&quot;: the characters are based on people in Hemingway&#x27;s circle and the action is based on events, particularly Hemingway&#x27;s life in Paris in the 1920s and a trip to Spain in 1925 for the Pamplona festival and fishing in the Pyrenees. Hemingway converted to Catholicism as he wrote the novel, and Jeffrey Herlihy-Mera notes that protagonist Jake Barnes, a Catholic, was &quot;a vehicle for Hemingway to rehearse his own conversion, testing the emotions that would accompany one of the most important acts of his life.&quot; Hemingway presents his notion that the &quot;Lost Generation&quot;—considered to have been decadent, dissolute and irretrievably damaged by World War I—was in fact resilient and strong. Hemingway investigates the themes of love and death, the revivifying power of nature, and the concept of masculinity. His spare writing style, combined with his restrained use of description to convey characterizations and action, demonstrates his &quot;Iceberg Theory&quot; of writing.

== Background ==
In the 1920s, Hemingway lived in Paris as a foreign correspondent for the &quot;Toronto Star&quot;, and traveled to İzmir to report on the Greco–Turkish War. He wanted to use his journalism experience to write fiction, believing that a story could be based on real events when a writer distilled his own experiences in such a way that, according to biographer Jeffrey Meyers, &quot;what he made up was truer than what he remembered&quot;.
With his wife Hadley Richardson, Hemingway first visited the Festival of San Fermín in Pamplona in 1923, where he was following his recent passion for bullfighting. The couple returned to Pamplona in 1924—enjoying the trip immensely—this time accompanied by Chink Dorman-Smith, John Dos Passos, and Donald Ogden Stewart and his wife. The two returned a third time in June 1925 and stayed at the hotel of his friend Juanito Quintana. That year, they brought with them a different group of American and British expatriates: Bill Smith, Hemingway&#x27;s Michigan boyhood friend; Stewart; recently divorced Duff, Lady Twysden and her lover Pat Guthrie; and Harold Loeb. Hemingway&#x27;s memory spanning multiple trips might explain the inconsistent time frame in the novel indicating both 1924 and 1925. In Pamplona, the group quickly disintegrated. Hemingway, attracted to Duff, was jealous of Loeb, who had recently been on a romantic getaway with her; by the end of the week the two men had a public fistfight. Against this background was the influence of the young matador from Ronda, Cayetano Ordóñez, whose brilliance in the bullring affected the spectators. Ordóñez honored Hemingway&#x27;s wife by presenting her, from the bullring, with the ear of a bull he killed. Outside of Pamplona, the fishing trip to the Irati River (near Burguete in Navarre) was marred by polluted water.

Hemingway had intended to write a nonfiction book about bullfighting, but then decided that the week&#x27;s experiences had presented him with enough material for a novel. A few days after the fiesta ended, on his birthday (21 July), he began writing what would eventually become &quot;The Sun Also Rises&quot;. By 17 August, with 14 chapters written and a working title of &quot;Fiesta&quot; chosen, Hemingway returned to Paris. He finished the draft on 21 September 1925, writing a foreword the following weekend and changing the title to &quot;The Lost Generation&quot;.

A few months later, in December 1925, Hemingway and his wife spent the winter in Schruns, Austria, where he began revising the manuscript extensively. Pauline Pfeiffer joined them in January, and—against Hadley&#x27;s advice—urged him to sign a contract with Scribner&#x27;s. Hemingway left Austria for a quick trip to New York to meet with the publishers, and on his return, during a stop in Paris, began an affair with Pauline. He returned to Schruns to finish the revisions in March. In June, he was in Pamplona with both Richardson and Pfeiffer. On their return to Paris, Richardson asked for a separation, and left for the south of France. In August, alone and depressed in Paris, Hemingway considered suicide and drafted a last will, but he completed the proofs, dedicating the novel to his wife and son. After the publication of the book in October, Hadley asked for a divorce; Hemingway subsequently gave her the book&#x27;s royalties.

== Publication history ==

Hemingway maneuvered his publisher Boni &amp; Liveright into terminating their contract with him so that &quot;The Sun Also Rises&quot; could be published by Scribner&#x27;s instead. In December 1925, he quickly wrote &quot;The Torrents of Spring&quot;, a satirical novella parodying Sherwood Anderson&#x27;s novel &quot;Dark Laughter&quot;, and sent it to Boni &amp; Liveright. His three-book contract with them included a termination clause should they reject a single submission. Unamused by the satire aimed at one of their most saleable authors, Boni &amp; Liveright immediately rejected it and terminated the contract. Within weeks Hemingway signed a contract with Scribner&#x27;s, who agreed to publish &quot;The Torrents of Spring&quot; and all of his subsequent work.

Scribner&#x27;s published the novel on 22 October 1926. Its first edition consisted of 5,090 copies, selling at $2.00 per copy. Cleo Damianakes illustrated the dust jacket with a Hellenistic design of a seated, robed woman, her head bent to her shoulder, eyes closed, one hand holding an apple, her shoulders and a thigh exposed. Editor Maxwell Perkins intended &quot;Cleon&#x27;s respectably sexy&quot; design to attract &quot;the feminine readers who control the destinies of so many novels&quot;.

Two months later the book was in a second printing with 7,000 copies sold. Subsequent printings were ordered; by 1928, after the publication of Hemingway&#x27;s short story collection &quot;Men Without Women&quot;, the novel was in its eighth printing. In 1927, the novel was published in the United Kingdom by Jonathan Cape, titled &quot;Fiesta&quot;, without the two epigraphs. Two decades later, in 1947, Scribner&#x27;s released three of Hemingway&#x27;s works as a boxed set, including &quot;The Sun Also Rises&quot;, &quot;A Farewell to Arms&quot;, and &quot;For Whom the Bell Tolls&quot;.

By 1983, &quot;The Sun Also Rises&quot; had been in print continuously since its publication in 1926, and was likely one of the most translated titles in the world. At that time, Scribner&#x27;s began to print cheaper mass-market paperbacks of the book, in addition to the more expensive trade paperbacks already in print. In the 1990s, British editions were titled &quot;Fiesta: The Sun Also Rises.&quot; In 2006, Simon &amp; Schuster began to produce audiobook versions of Hemingway&#x27;s novels, including &quot;The Sun Also Rises&quot;. In May 2016, a new &quot;Hemingway Library Edition&quot; was published by Simon &amp; Schuster, including early drafts, passages that were deleted from the final draft, and alternative titles for the book, which help to explain the author&#x27;s journey to produce the final version of the work.

== Plot summary ==
On the surface, the novel is a love story between the protagonist Jake Barnes—a man whose war wound has made him unable to have sex—and the promiscuous divorcée Lady Brett Ashley. Jake is an expatriate American journalist living in Paris, while Brett is a twice-divorced Englishwoman with bobbed hair and numerous love affairs, and embodies the new sexual freedom of the 1920s. Brett&#x27;s affair with Jake&#x27;s Princeton friend Robert Cohn (whom the characters often refer to by his last name) causes Jake to be upset and break off his friendship with Cohn; her seduction of the 19-year-old matador Romero causes Jake to lose his good reputation among the Spaniards in Pamplona.

Book One is set in the café society of young American expatriates in Paris. In the opening scenes, Jake plays tennis with Cohn, picks up a prostitute named Georgette, and runs into Brett and Count Mippipopolous in a nightclub. Later, Brett tells Jake she loves him, but they both know that they have no chance at a stable relationship.

In Book Two, Jake is joined by Bill Gorton, recently arrived from New York, and Brett&#x27;s fiancé Mike Campbell, who arrives from Scotland. Jake and Bill travel south and meet Cohn at Bayonne for a fishing trip in the hills northeast of Pamplona. Instead of fishing, Cohn stays in Pamplona to wait for the overdue Brett and Mike. Cohn had an affair with Brett a few weeks earlier and still feels possessive of her despite her engagement to Mike. After Jake and Bill enjoy five days of fishing the streams near Burguete, they rejoin the group in Pamplona.

All begin to drink heavily. Cohn is resented by the others, who taunt him with antisemitic remarks. During the , the characters drink, eat, watch the running of the bulls, attend bullfights, and bicker. Jake introduces Brett to the 19-year-old matador Romero at the Hotel Montoya; she is smitten with him and seduces him. The jealous tension among the men builds—Jake, Mike, Cohn, and Romero each want Brett. Cohn, who had been a champion boxer in college, has a fistfight with Jake and Mike, and another with Romero, whom he beats up. Despite his injuries, Romero continues to perform brilliantly in the bullring.

Book Three shows the characters in the aftermath of the fiesta. Sober again, they leave Pamplona; Bill returns to Paris, Mike stays in Bayonne, and Jake goes to San Sebastián on the northern coast of Spain. As Jake is about to return to Paris, he receives a telegram from Brett asking for help; she had gone to Madrid with Romero. He finds her in a cheap hotel, without money, and without Romero. She announces she has decided to go back to Mike. The novel ends with Jake and Brett in a taxi speaking and thinking of what might have been.

== Themes and analysis ==

=== Paris and the Lost Generation ===

The first book of &quot;The Sun Also Rises&quot; is set in mid-1920s Paris. Americans were drawn to Paris in the Roaring Twenties by the favorable exchange rate, with as many as 200,000 English-speaking expatriates living there. The &quot;Paris Tribune&quot; reported in 1925 that Paris had an American Hospital, an American Library, and an American Chamber of Commerce. Many American writers were disenchanted with the US, where they found less artistic freedom than in Europe. (For example, Hemingway was in Paris during the period when &quot;Ulysses&quot;, written by his friend James Joyce, was banned and burned in New York.)

The themes of &quot;The Sun Also Rises&quot; appear in its two epigraphs. The first is an allusion to the &quot;Lost Generation&quot;, a term coined by Gertrude Stein referring to the post-war generation; the other epigraph is a long quotation from Ecclesiastes: &quot;One generation passeth away, and another generation cometh: but the earth abideth for ever. The sun also ariseth, and the sun goeth down, and hasteth to his place where he arose.&quot; Hemingway told his editor Max Perkins that the book was not so much about a generation being lost, but that &quot;the earth abideth forever.&quot; He thought the characters in &quot;The Sun Also Rises&quot; may have been &quot;battered&quot; but were not lost.

Hemingway scholar Wagner-Martin writes that Hemingway wanted the book to be about morality, which he emphasized by changing the working title from &quot;Fiesta&quot; to &quot;The Sun Also Rises.&quot; Wagner-Martin argues that the book can be read either as a novel about bored expatriates or as a morality tale about a protagonist who searches for integrity in an immoral world. Months before Hemingway left for Pamplona, the press was depicting the Parisian Latin Quarter, where he lived, as decadent and depraved. He began writing the story of a matador corrupted by the influence of the Latin Quarter crowd; he expanded it into a novel about Jake Barnes at risk of being corrupted by wealthy and inauthentic expatriates.
The characters form a group, sharing similar norms, and each greatly affected by the war. Hemingway captures the angst of the age and transcends the love story of Brett and Jake, although they are representative of the period: Brett is starved for reassurance and love and Jake is sexually maimed. His wound symbolizes the disability of the age, the disillusion, and the frustrations felt by an entire generation.

Hemingway thought he lost touch with American values while living in Paris, but his biographer Michael S. Reynolds claims the opposite, seeing evidence of the author&#x27;s midwestern American values in the novel. Hemingway admired hard work. He portrayed the matadors and the prostitutes, who work for a living, in a positive manner, but Brett, who prostitutes herself, is emblematic of &quot;the rotten crowd&quot; living on inherited money. It is Jake, the working journalist, who pays the bills again and again when those who can pay do not. Hemingway shows, through Jake&#x27;s actions, his disapproval of the people who did not pay up. Reynolds says that Hemingway shows the tragedy, not so much of the decadence of the Montparnasse crowd, but of the decline in American values of the period. As such, the author created an American hero who is impotent and powerless. Jake becomes the moral center of the story. He never considers himself part of the expatriate crowd because he is a working man; to Jake a working man is genuine and authentic, and those who do not work for a living spend their lives posing.

=== Women and love ===
The twice-divorced Brett Ashley represented the liberated New Woman (in the 1920s, divorces were common and easy to be had in Paris). James Nagel writes that, in Brett, Hemingway created one of the more fascinating women in 20th-century American literature. Sexually promiscuous, she is a denizen of Parisian nightlife and cafés. In Pamplona she sparks chaos: the men drink too much and fight over her. She also seduces the young bullfighter Romero and becomes a Circe in the festival. Critics describe her variously as complicated, elusive, and enigmatic; Donald Daiker writes that Hemingway &quot;treats her with a delicate balance of sympathy and antipathy.&quot; She is vulnerable, forgiving, independent—qualities that Hemingway juxtaposes with the other women in the book, who are either prostitutes or overbearing nags.

Nagel considers the novel a tragedy. Jake and Brett have a relationship that becomes destructive because their love cannot be consummated. Conflict over Brett destroys Jake&#x27;s friendship with Robert Cohn, and her behavior in Pamplona affects Jake&#x27;s hard-won reputation among the Spaniards. Meyers sees Brett as a woman who wants sex without love while Jake can only give her love without sex. Although Brett sleeps with many men, it is Jake she loves. Dana Fore writes that Brett is willing to be with Jake in spite of his disability, in a &quot;non-traditional erotic relationship.&quot; Other critics such as Leslie Fiedler and Nina Baym see her as a supreme bitch; Fiedler sees Brett as one of the &quot;outstanding examples of Hemingway&#x27;s &#x27;bitch women. Jake becomes bitter about their relationship, as when he says, &quot;Send a girl off with a man ... Now go and bring her back. And sign the wire with love.&quot;

Critics interpret the Jake–Brett relationship in various ways. Daiker suggests that Brett&#x27;s behavior in Madrid—after Romero leaves and when Jake arrives at her summons—reflects her immorality. Scott Donaldson thinks Hemingway presents the Jake–Brett relationship in such a manner that Jake knew &quot;that in having Brett for a friend &#x27;he had been getting something for nothing&#x27; and that sooner or later he would have to pay the bill.&quot; Daiker notes that Brett relies on Jake to pay for her train fare from Madrid to San Sebastián, where she rejoins her fiancé Mike. In a piece Hemingway cut, he has Jake thinking, &quot;you learned a lot about a woman by not sleeping with her.&quot; By the end of the novel, although Jake loves Brett, he appears to undergo a transformation in Madrid when he begins to distance himself from her. Reynolds believes that Jake represents the &quot;everyman,&quot; and that in the course of the narrative he loses his honor, faith, and hope. He sees the novel as a morality play with Jake as the person who loses the most.

=== The &quot;corrida&quot;, the fiesta, and nature ===

In &quot;The Sun Also Rises&quot;, Hemingway contrasts Paris with Pamplona, and the frenzy of the fiesta with the tranquillity of the Spanish countryside. Spain was among Hemingway&#x27;s favorite European countries; he considered it a healthy place, and the only country &quot;that hasn&#x27;t been shot to pieces.&quot; He was profoundly affected by the spectacle of bullfighting, writing, It isn&#x27;t just brutal like they always told us. It&#x27;s a great tragedy—and the most beautiful thing I&#x27;ve ever seen and takes more guts and skill and guts again than anything possibly could. It&#x27;s just like having a ringside seat at the war with nothing going to happen to you. He demonstrated what he considered the purity in the culture of bullfighting—called &quot;afición&quot;—and presented it as an authentic way of life, contrasted against the inauthenticity of the Parisian bohemians. To be accepted as an &quot;aficionado&quot; was rare for a non-Spaniard; Jake goes through a difficult process to gain acceptance by the &quot;fellowship of &quot;afición.&quot;&quot;

Allen Josephs thinks the novel is centered on the &quot;corrida&quot; (the bullfighting), and how each character reacts to it. Brett seduces the young matador; Cohn fails to understand and expects to be bored; Jake understands fully because only he moves between the world of the inauthentic expatriates and the authentic Spaniards; the hotel keeper Montoya is the keeper of the faith; and Romero is the artist in the ring—he is both innocent and perfect, and the one who bravely faces death. The &quot;corrida&quot; is presented as an idealized drama in which the matador faces death, creating a moment of existentialism or &quot;nada&quot; (nothingness), broken when he vanquishes death by killing the bull.
Hemingway presents matadors as heroic characters dancing in a bullring. He considered the bullring as war with precise rules, in contrast to the messiness of the real war that he, and by extension Jake, experienced. Critic Keneth Kinnamon argues that young Romero is the novel&#x27;s only honorable character. Hemingway named Romero after Pedro Romero, an 18th-century bullfighter who killed thousands of bulls in the most difficult manner: having the bull impale itself on his sword as he stood perfectly still. Reynolds says Romero, who symbolizes the classically pure matador, is the &quot;one idealized figure in the novel.&quot; Josephs says that when Hemingway changed Romero&#x27;s name from Guerrita and imbued him with the characteristics of the historical Romero, he also changed the scene in which Romero kills a bull to one of &quot;recibiendo&quot; (receiving the bull) in homage to the historical namesake.

Before the group arrives in Pamplona, Jake and Bill take a fishing trip to the Irati River. As Harold Bloom points out, the scene serves as an interlude between the Paris and Pamplona sections, &quot;an oasis that exists outside linear time.&quot; On another level it reflects &quot;the mainstream of American fiction beginning with the Pilgrims seeking refuge from English oppression&quot;—the prominent theme in American literature of escaping into the wilderness, as seen in Cooper, Hawthorne, Melville, Twain, and Thoreau. Fiedler calls the theme &quot;The Sacred Land&quot;; he thinks the American West is evoked in &quot;The Sun Also Rises&quot; by the Pyrenees and given a symbolic nod with the name of the &quot;Hotel Montana.&quot; In Hemingway&#x27;s writing, nature is a place of refuge and rebirth, according to Stoltzfus, where the hunter or fisherman gains a moment of transcendence at the moment the prey is killed. Nature is the place where men act without women: men fish, men hunt, men find redemption. In nature Jake and Bill do not need to discuss the war because their war experience, paradoxically, is ever-present. The nature scenes serve as counterpoint to the fiesta scenes.

All of the characters drink heavily during the fiesta and generally throughout the novel. In his essay &quot;Alcoholism in Hemingway&#x27;s &quot;The Sun Also Rises&quot;&quot;, Matts Djos says the main characters exhibit alcoholic tendencies such as depression, anxiety and sexual inadequacy. He writes that Jake&#x27;s self-pity is symptomatic of an alcoholic, as is Brett&#x27;s out-of-control behavior. William Balassi thinks that Jake gets drunk to avoid his feelings for Brett, notably in the Madrid scenes at the end where he has three martinis before lunch and drinks three bottles of wine with lunch. Reynolds, however, believes the drinking is relevant as set against the historical context of Prohibition in the United States. The atmosphere of the fiesta lends itself to drunkenness, but the degree of revelry among the Americans also reflects a reaction against Prohibition. Bill, visiting from the US, drinks in Paris and in Spain. Jake is rarely drunk in Paris where he works but on vacation in Pamplona, he drinks constantly. Reynolds says that Prohibition split attitudes about morality, and in the novel Hemingway made clear his dislike of Prohibition.

=== Masculinity and gender ===
Critics have seen Jake as an ambiguous representative of Hemingway manliness. For example, in the bar scene in Paris, Jake is angry at some homosexual men. The critic Ira Elliot suggests that Hemingway viewed homosexuality as an inauthentic way of life, and that he aligns Jake with homosexual men because, like them, Jake does not have sex with women. Jake&#x27;s anger shows his self-hatred at his inauthenticity and lack of masculinity. His sense of masculine identity is lost—he is less than a man. Elliot wonders if Jake&#x27;s wound perhaps signifies latent homosexuality, rather than only a loss of masculinity; the emphasis in the novel, however, is on Jake&#x27;s interest in women. Hemingway&#x27;s writing has been called homophobic because of the language his characters use. For example, in the fishing scenes, Bill confesses his fondness for Jake but then goes on to say, &quot;I couldn&#x27;t tell you that in New York. It&#x27;d mean I was a faggot.&quot;

In contrast to Jake&#x27;s troubled masculinity, Romero represents an ideal masculine identity grounded in self-assurance, bravery and competence. The Davidsons note that Brett is attracted to Romero for these reasons, and they speculate that Jake might be trying to undermine Romero&#x27;s masculinity by bringing Brett to him and thus diminishing his ideal stature.

Critics have examined issues of gender misidentification that are prevalent in much of Hemingway&#x27;s work. He was interested in cross-gender themes, as shown by his depictions of effeminate men and boyish women. In his fiction, a woman&#x27;s hair is often symbolically important and used to denote gender. Brett, with her short hair, is androgynous and compared to a boy—yet the ambiguity lies in the fact that she is described as a &quot;damned fine-looking woman.&quot; While Jake is attracted to this ambiguity, Romero is repulsed by it. In keeping with his strict moral code he wants a feminine partner and rejects Brett because, among other things, she will not grow her hair.

=== Antisemitism ===

Hemingway has been called antisemitic, most notably because of the characterization of Robert Cohn in the book. The other characters often refer to Cohn as a Jew, and once as a &#x27;kike&#x27;. Shunned by the other members of the group, Cohn is characterized as &quot;different&quot;, unable or unwilling to understand and participate in the fiesta. Cohn is never really part of the group—separated by his difference or his Jewish faith. Barry Gross, comparing Jewish characters in literature of the period, commented that &quot;Hemingway never lets the reader forget that Cohn is a Jew, not an unattractive character who happens to be a Jew but a character who is unattractive because he is a Jew.&quot; Hemingway critic Josephine Knopf speculates that Hemingway might have wanted to depict Cohn as a &quot;shlemiel&quot; (or fool), but she points out that Cohn lacks the characteristics of a traditional shlemiel.

Cohn is based on Harold Loeb, a fellow writer who rivaled Hemingway for the affections of Duff, Lady Twysden (the real-life inspiration for Brett). Biographer Michael Reynolds writes that in 1925, Loeb should have declined Hemingway&#x27;s invitation to join them in Pamplona. Before the trip, he was Duff&#x27;s lover and Hemingway&#x27;s friend; during the fiasco of the fiesta, he lost Duff and Hemingway&#x27;s friendship. Hemingway used Loeb as the basis of a character remembered chiefly as a &quot;rich Jew.&quot;

== Writing style ==
The novel is well known for its style, which is variously described as modern, hard-boiled, or understated. As a novice writer and journalist in Paris, Hemingway turned to Ezra Pound—who had a reputation as &quot;an unofficial minister of culture who acted as mid-wife for new literary talent&quot;—to mark and blue-ink his short stories. From Pound, Hemingway learned to write in the modernist style: he used understatement, pared away sentimentalism, and presented images and scenes without explanations of meaning, most notably at the book&#x27;s conclusion, in which multiple future possibilities are left for Brett and Jake. The scholar Anders Hallengren writes that because Hemingway learned from Pound to &quot;distrust adjectives,&quot; he created a style &quot;in accordance with the esthetics and ethics of raising the emotional temperature towards the level of universal truth by shutting the door on sentiment, on the subjective.&quot;

F. Scott Fitzgerald told Hemingway to &quot;let the book&#x27;s action play itself out among its characters.&quot; Hemingway scholar Linda Wagner-Martin writes that, in taking Fitzgerald&#x27;s advice, Hemingway produced a novel without a central narrator: &quot;Hemingway&#x27;s book was a step ahead; it was the modernist novel.&quot; When Fitzgerald advised Hemingway to trim at least 2500 words from the opening sequence, which was 30 pages long, Hemingway wired the publishers telling them to cut the opening 30 pages altogether. The result was a novel without a focused starting point, which was seen as a modern perspective and critically well received.
Wagner-Martin speculates that Hemingway may have wanted to have a weak or negative hero as defined by Edith Wharton, but he had no experience creating a hero or protagonist. At that point his fiction consisted of extremely short stories, not one of which featured a hero. The hero changed during the writing of &quot;The Sun Also Rises&quot;: first the matador was the hero, then Cohn was the hero, then Brett, and finally Hemingway realized &quot;maybe there is not any hero at all. Maybe a story is better without any hero.&quot; Balassi believes that in eliminating other characters as the protagonist, Hemingway brought Jake indirectly into the role of the novel&#x27;s hero.

As a roman à clef, the novel based its characters on living people, causing scandal in the expatriate community. Hemingway biographer Carlos Baker writes that &quot;word-of-mouth of the book&quot; helped sales. Parisian expatriates gleefully tried to match the fictional characters to real identities. Moreover, he writes that Hemingway used prototypes easily found in the Latin Quarter on which to base his characters. The early draft identified the characters by their living counterparts; Jake&#x27;s character was called Hem, and Brett&#x27;s was called Duff.

Although the novel is written in a journalistic style, Frederic Svoboda writes that the striking thing about the work is &quot;how quickly it moves away from a simple recounting of events.&quot; Jackson Benson believes that Hemingway used autobiographical details as framing devices for life in general. For example, Benson says that Hemingway drew out his experiences with &quot;what if&quot; scenarios: &quot;what if I were wounded in such a way that I could not sleep at night? What if I were wounded and made crazy, what would happen if I were sent back to the front?&quot; Hemingway believed that the writer could describe one thing while an entirely different thing occurs below the surface—an approach he called the iceberg theory, or the theory of omission.
Balassi says Hemingway applied the iceberg theory better in &quot;The Sun Also Rises&quot; than in any of his other works, by editing extraneous material or purposely leaving gaps in the story. He made editorial remarks in the manuscript that show he wanted to break from the stricture of Gertrude Stein&#x27;s advice to use &quot;clear restrained writing.&quot; In the earliest draft, the novel begins in Pamplona, but Hemingway moved the opening setting to Paris because he thought the Montparnasse life was necessary as a counterpoint to the later action in Spain. He wrote of Paris extensively, intending &quot;not to be limited by the literary theories of others, [but] to write in his own way, and possibly, to fail.&quot; He added metaphors for each character: Mike&#x27;s money problems, Brett&#x27;s association with the Circe myth, Robert&#x27;s association with the segregated steer. It wasn&#x27;t until the revision process that he pared down the story, taking out unnecessary explanations, minimizing descriptive passages, and stripping the dialogue, all of which created a &quot;complex but tightly compressed story.&quot;

Hemingway said that he learned what he needed as a foundation for his writing from the style sheet for &quot;The Kansas City Star,&quot; where he worked as cub reporter. The critic John Aldridge says that the minimalist style resulted from Hemingway&#x27;s belief that to write authentically, each word had to be carefully chosen for its simplicity and authenticity and carry a great deal of weight. Aldridge writes that Hemingway&#x27;s style &quot;of a minimum of simple words that seemed to be squeezed onto the page against a great compulsion to be silent, creates the impression that those words—if only because there are so few of them—are sacramental.&quot; In Paris Hemingway had been experimenting with the prosody of the King James Bible, reading aloud with his friend John Dos Passos. From the style of the biblical text, he learned to build his prose incrementally; the action in the novel builds sentence by sentence, scene by scene and chapter by chapter.

The simplicity of his style is deceptive. Bloom writes that it is the effective use of parataxis that elevates Hemingway&#x27;s prose. Drawing on the Bible, Walt Whitman and &quot;Adventures of Huckleberry Finn&quot;, Hemingway wrote in deliberate understatement and he heavily incorporated parataxis, which in some cases almost becomes cinematic. His skeletal sentences were crafted in response to Henry James&#x27;s observation that World War I had &quot;used up words,&quot; explains Hemingway scholar Zoe Trodd, who writes that his style is similar to a &quot;multi-focal&quot; photographic reality. The syntax, which lacks subordinating conjunctions, creates static sentences. The photographic &quot;snapshot&quot; style creates a collage of images. Hemingway omits internal punctuation (colons, semicolons, dashes, parentheses) in favor of short declarative sentences, which are meant to build, as events build, to create a sense of the whole. He also uses techniques analogous to cinema, such as cutting quickly from one scene to the next, or splicing one scene into another. Intentional omissions allow the reader to fill the gap as though responding to instructions from the author and create three-dimensional prose. Biographer James Mellow writes that the bullfighting scenes are presented with a crispness and clarity that evoke the sense of a newsreel.

Hemingway also uses color and visual art techniques to convey emotional range in his descriptions of the Irati River. In &quot;Translating Modernism: Fitzgerald and Hemingway,&quot; Ronald Berman compares Hemingway&#x27;s treatment of landscape with that of the post-Impressionist painter Paul Cézanne. During a 1949 interview, Hemingway told Lillian Ross that he learned from Cézanne how to &quot;make a landscape.&quot; In comparing writing to painting he told her, &quot;This is what we try to do in writing, this and this, and woods, and the rocks we have to climb over.&quot; The landscape is seen subjectively—the viewpoint of the observer is paramount. To Jake, landscape &quot;meant a search for a solid form ... not existentially present in [his] life in Paris.&quot;

== Reception ==
Hemingway&#x27;s first novel was arguably his best and most important and came to be seen as an iconic modernist novel, although Reynolds emphasizes that Hemingway was not philosophically a modernist. In the book, his characters epitomized the post-war expatriate generation for future generations. He had received good reviews for his volume of short stories, &quot;In Our Time&quot;, of which Edmund Wilson wrote, &quot;Hemingway&#x27;s prose was of the first distinction.&quot; Wilson&#x27;s comments were enough to bring attention to the young writer.
Good reviews came in from many major publications. Conrad Aiken wrote in the &quot;New York Herald Tribune&quot;, &quot;If there is a better dialogue to be written today I do not know where to find it&quot;; and Bruce Barton wrote in &quot;The Atlantic&quot; that Hemingway &quot;writes as if he had never read anybody&#x27;s writing, as if he had fashioned the art of writing himself,&quot; and that the characters &quot;are amazingly real and alive.&quot; Many reviewers, among them H. L. Mencken, praised Hemingway&#x27;s style, use of understatement, and tight writing.

Other critics, however, disliked the novel. &quot;The Nation&quot; critic believed Hemingway&#x27;s hard-boiled style was better suited to the short stories published in &quot;In Our Time&quot; than his novel. Writing in the &quot;New Masses&quot;, Hemingway&#x27;s friend John Dos Passos asked: &quot;What&#x27;s the matter with American writing these days? ... The few unsad young men of this lost generation will have to look for another way of finding themselves than the one indicated here.&quot; Privately he wrote Hemingway an apology for the review. The reviewer for the &quot;Chicago Daily Tribune&quot; wrote of the novel, &quot;&quot;The Sun Also Rises&quot; is the kind of book that makes this reviewer at least almost plain angry.&quot; Some reviewers disliked the characters, among them the reviewer for &quot;The Dial&quot;, who thought the characters were shallow and vapid; and &quot;The Nation and Atheneum&quot; deemed the characters boring and the novel unimportant. The reviewer for &quot;The Cincinnati Enquirer&quot; wrote of the book that it &quot;begins nowhere and ends in nothing.&quot;

Hemingway&#x27;s family hated it. His mother, Grace Hemingway, distressed that she could not face the criticism at her local book study class—where it was said that her son was &quot;prostituting a great ability ... to the lowest uses&quot;—expressed her displeasure in a letter to him:
The critics seem to be full of praise for your style and ability to draw word pictures but the decent ones always regret that you should use such great gifts in perpetuating the lives and habits of so degraded a strata of humanity ... It is a doubtful honor to produce one of the filthiest books of the year ... What is the matter? Have you ceased to be interested in nobility, honor and fineness in life? ... Surely you have other words in your vocabulary than &quot;damn&quot; and &quot;bitch&quot;—Every page fills me with a sick loathing.

Still, the book sold well, and young women began to emulate Brett while male students at Ivy League universities wanted to become &quot;Hemingway heroes.&quot; Scribner&#x27;s encouraged the publicity and allowed Hemingway to &quot;become a minor American phenomenon&quot;—a celebrity to the point that his divorce from Richardson and marriage to Pfeiffer attracted media attention.

Reynolds believes &quot;The Sun Also Rises&quot; could have been written only circa 1925: it perfectly captured the period between World War I and the Great Depression, and immortalized a group of characters. In the years since its publication, the novel has been criticized for its antisemitism, as expressed in the characterization of Robert Cohn. Reynolds explains that although the publishers complained to Hemingway about his description of bulls, they allowed his use of Jewish epithets, which showed the degree to which antisemitism was accepted in the US after World War I. Hemingway clearly makes Cohn unlikeable not only as a character but as a character who is Jewish. Critics of the 1970s and 1980s considered Hemingway to be misogynistic and homophobic; by the 1990s his work, including &quot;The Sun Also Rises&quot;, began to receive critical reconsideration by female scholars.

== Legacy and adaptations ==
Hemingway&#x27;s work continued to be popular in the latter half of the century and after his suicide in 1961. During the 1970s, &quot;The Sun Also Rises&quot; appealed to what Beegel calls the lost generation of the Vietnam era. Aldridge writes that &quot;The Sun Also Rises&quot; has kept its appeal because the novel is about being young. The characters live in the most beautiful city in the world, spend their days traveling, fishing, drinking, making love, and generally reveling in their youth. He believes the expatriate writers of the 1920s appeal for this reason, but that Hemingway was the most successful in capturing the time and the place in &quot;The Sun Also Rises&quot;.

Bloom says that some of the characters have not stood the test of time, writing that modern readers are uncomfortable with the antisemitic treatment of Cohn&#x27;s character and the romanticization of a bullfighter. Moreover, Brett and Mike belong uniquely to the Jazz Age and do not translate to the modern era. Bloom believes the novel is in the canon of American literature for its formal qualities: its prose and style.

The novel made Hemingway famous, inspired young women across America to wear short hair and sweater sets like the heroine&#x27;s—and to act like her too—and changed writing style in ways that could be seen in any American magazine published in the next twenty years. In many ways, the novel&#x27;s stripped-down prose became a model for 20th-century American writing. Nagel writes that &quot;&quot;The Sun Also Rises&quot; was a dramatic literary event and its effects have not diminished over the years.&quot;

The success of &quot;The Sun Also Rises&quot; led to interest from Broadway and Hollywood. In 1927 two Broadway producers wanted to adapt the story for the stage but made no immediate offers. Hemingway considered marketing the story directly to Hollywood, telling his editor Max Perkins that he would not sell it for less than $30,000—money he wanted his estranged wife Hadley Richardson to have. Conrad Aiken thought the book was perfect for a film adaptation solely on the strength of dialogue. Hemingway would not see a stage or film adaption anytime soon: he sold the film rights to RKO Pictures in 1932, but only in 1956 was the novel adapted to a film of the same name. Peter Viertel wrote the screenplay. Tyrone Power as Jake played the lead role opposite Ava Gardner as Brett and Errol Flynn as Mike. The royalties went to Richardson.

Hemingway wrote more books about bullfighting: &quot;Death in the Afternoon&quot; was published in 1932 and &quot;The Dangerous Summer&quot; was published posthumously in 1985. His depictions of Pamplona, beginning with &quot;The Sun Also Rises&quot;, helped to popularize the annual running of the bulls at the Festival of St. Fermin.

<text>The Battle of the Golden Spurs (; ) or 1302 Battle of Courtrai was a military confrontation between the royal army of France and rebellious forces of the County of Flanders on 11 July 1302 during the 1297–1305 Franco-Flemish War. It took place near the town of Kortrijk in modern-day Belgium and resulted in an unexpected victory for the Flemish.

On 18 May 1302, after two years of French military occupation and several years of unrest, many cities in Flanders revolted against French rule, and the local militia massacred many Frenchmen in the city of Bruges. King Philip IV of France immediately organized an expedition of 8,000 troops, including 2,500 men-at-arms, under Count Robert II of Artois to put down the rebellion. Meanwhile, 9,400 men from the civic militias of several Flemish cities were assembled to counter the expected French attack.

When the two armies met outside the city of Kortrijk on 11 July, the cavalry charges of the mounted French men-at-arms were unable to defeat the mail-armoured and well-trained Flemish militia infantry&#x27;s pike formation. The result was a rout of the French nobles, who suffered heavy losses at the hands of the Flemish. The 500 pairs of spurs that were captured from the French horsemen gave the battle its popular name. The battle was a famous early example of an all-infantry army defeating an enemy force reliant on heavy cavalry by means of superior numbers, the environment, and by taking advantage of their foes&#x27; overconfidence.

While France was victorious in the overall Franco-Flemish War, the Battle of the Golden Spurs became an important cultural reference point for the Flemish Movement during the 19th and 20th centuries. In 1973, the date of the battle was chosen for the official holiday of the Flemish Community in Belgium. A 1985 film called &quot;De leeuw van Vlaanderen (The Lion of Flanders)&quot; depicts a vision of the battle, and the politics that led up to it.

==Background==
The origins of the Franco-Flemish War (1297–1305) can be traced back to the accession of Philip IV &quot;the Fair&quot; to the French throne in 1285. Philip hoped to reassert control over the County of Flanders, a semi-independent polity notionally part of the Kingdom of France, and possibly even to annex it into the crown lands of France. In the 1290s, Philip attempted to gain support from the Flemish aristocracy and succeeded in winning the allegiance of some local nobles, including John of Avesnes (Count of Hainaut, Holland and Zeeland). He was opposed by a faction led by the Flemish knight Guy of Dampierre, who attempted to form a marriage alliance with the English against Philip. In Flanders, however, many of the cities were split into factions known as the &quot;Lilies&quot; (&quot;Leliaerts&quot;), who were pro-French, and the &quot;Lions&quot; (&quot;Liebaards&quot;), who would later be referred to as the &quot;Claws&quot; (&quot;Klauwaerts&quot;), led by Pieter de Coninck in Bruges and seeking independence.
In June 1297, the French invaded Flanders and gained some rapid successes. King Edward I of England had been at war against Philip for three years but was obliged to withdraw most of his attention from France to face the First War of Scottish Independence. He entered negotiations with France leading to the 1299 Treaty of Montreuil, while the Flemish and French signed the 1297 Truce of Sint-Baafs-Vijve, a temporary armistice which halted their conflict. When the truce expired in January 1300, Edward had just married Philip&#x27;s sister Margaret and the French invaded Flanders again. By May, were in total control of the county. Guy of Dampierre was imprisoned and Philip himself toured Flanders while setting up a French-controlled administrative apparatus.

After Philip left Flanders, unrest broke out again in the Flemish city of Bruges in the form of a rebellion against the new French governor, Jacques de Châtillon. On 18 May 1302, rebellious citizens who had fled Bruges returned to the city and murdered every Frenchman they could find, an act known as the &quot;Bruges Matins&quot;. With Guy of Dampierre still imprisoned, command of the rebellion fell to his allies John and Guy of Namur. Most of the towns of the County of Flanders agreed to join the Bruges rebellion, except for the city of Ghent which refused to take part. Most of the Flemish nobility also took the French side, fearful of what they perceived as an attempt by the lower classes to seize power.

===Forces===
To quell the revolt, Philip sent a powerful force led by Count Robert II of Artois to march on Bruges. Against the French, the Flemish under William of Jülich fielded an army of mostly infantry, drawn mainly from Bruges, West Flanders, and the east of the county. The city of Ypres sent a contingent of five hundred men under Jan van Renesse, and despite their city&#x27;s refusal to join the revolt, Jan Borluut arrived with seven hundred volunteers from Ghent.
The Flemish forces were primarily town militia who were well equipped and trained. The militia fought primarily as infantry, were organized by guild, and were equipped with steel helmets, mail haubergeons, spears, pikes, bows, crossbows and the &quot;goedendag&quot;, a specifically Flemish weapon made from a thick, wooden shaft and topped with a steel spike. All Flemish troops at the battle had helmets, neck protection, iron or steel gloves and effective weapons, though not all could afford mail armor. They were a well-organized force of 8,000–10,000 infantry, as well as four hundred noblemen acting as officers, and the urban militias of the time prided themselves on their regular training and preparation. About 900 of the Flemish were trained crossbowmen. The Flemish militia formed a line formation against the French cavalry with &quot;goedendags&quot; and pikes pointed outward. Because of the high rate of defections among the Flemish nobility, there were few mounted knights on the Flemish side; the &quot;Annals of Ghent&quot; claimed that there were just ten cavalrymen in the Flemish force.

The French, by contrast, fielded an army built around a core of 2,500 noble cavalry, including knights and squires, arrayed into ten formations of 250 armored horsemen. During the deployment for the battle, they were arranged into three battles, of which the first two were to attack and the third to function as a rearguard and reserve. They were supported by about 5,500 infantry, a mix of crossbowmen, spearmen, and light infantry. The French had about 1,000 crossbowmen, most of whom were from the Kingdom of France and perhaps a few hundred recruited from northern Italy and Spain. Contemporary military theory valued each knight as equal to roughly ten footmen.

==Battle==


The combined Flemish forces met at Kortrijk on 26 June and laid siege to the local castle, which housed a French garrison. Anticipating a French attempt to break the siege, they prepared to face their enemies in a field battle. The size of the French response was impressive, with 3,000 knights and 4,000–5,000 infantry being an accepted estimate. The Flemish ultimately chose to break off the siege and the two forces clashed on 11 July in an open field next to the Groeninge stream.

The field near Kortrijk was crossed by numerous ditches and streams dug by the Flemish as Philip&#x27;s army assembled. Some drained from the river Leie (or Lys), while others were concealed with dirt and tree branches, resulting in an uneven terrain that made cavalry charges, the main French battle tactic, less effective by limiting the momentum and maneuverability of horsemen and their mounts. The French assigned scouting parties to cover the marsh with wood planks, but they were driven off before the task was finished. The Flemish placed themselves in a strong defensive position, in deeply stacked lines forming a square. The rear of the square was covered by a curve of the river. The front presented a wedge to the French army and was placed behind larger rivulets.

The 1,000 French crossbowmen began the battle by attacking their 900 Flemish counterparts and succeeded in forcing them back. Eventually, the French crossbow bolts and arrows began to hit the main Flemish infantry formations&#x27; front ranks, but inflicted little damage due to the strong defensive lines.

Robert II of Artois expressed concern that his outnumbered infantry would be overwhelmed by the Flemish soldiers positioned on the other side of the brooks. Furthermore, the Flemish would then have their formations blocking the brooks physically and a successful French cavalry crossing would be extremely difficult. He therefore recalled his foot soldiers to clear the way for 2,300 heavy cavalry arranged into two attack formations. The French cavalry unfurled their banners and advanced on the command &quot;Forward!&quot;
Some of the French footmen were trampled to death by the advancing cavalry, but most managed to get around them or through the gaps in their lines. The cavalry advanced rapidly, hoping to give the Flemish no time to react. The brooks presented difficulties for the French horsemen and a few fell from their steeds. Despite this, the crossing was successful in the end. The French then hastily reorganized themselves for a direct assault.

Ready for combat, the French knights and men-at-arms charged at a quick trot and with their lances ready against the main Flemish line. The Flemish crossbowmen and archers fell back behind the pikemen. A great noise rose throughout the dramatic battle scene. The disciplined Flemish foot-soldiers kept their pikes ready on the ground and their &quot;goedendags&quot; raised to meet the French charge. The Flemish infantry wall did not flinch as expected and a part of the French cavalry hesitated. The bulk of the French formations continued their attack and fell on the Flemish in an ear-splitting crash of horses against men. Unable at most points to break the Flemish line of pikemen, many French knights were quickly knocked from their horses and killed with the &quot;goedendag&quot;, the spike of which was designed to penetrate the spaces between armour segments. The few that managed to break through ran right into the Flemish reserves; they were swiftly routed and cut down.
Realizing that the attack had failed, Artois ordered his rearguard of 700 men-at-arms to advance. As trumpets blared, he then rode forward with his own knights to lead them. The rearguard failed to obey Artois&#x27; orders in full; after the initial advance, they soon turned back to protect their vulnerable baggage train. Without support, the count and his men were unable to break through the Flemish line. As they were surrounded and cut off from their forces, the men-at-arms showed great courage as they fought for their lives. Artois in particular was said to have defended himself skillfully. His horse was struck down by a lay brother, Willem van Saeftinghe, and the count himself was soon felled by multiple wounds. According to some tales, he begged for his life, but the Flemish mocked him by claiming they did not understand French.

The death of Artois, coupled with the collapse of their advance, shattered the resolve of the surviving knights and they were soon driven back into the marshes. There, disorganized, unhorsed, and encumbered by the mud, they were easy targets. A last-ditch effort by the garrison to reinforce their countrymen failed when they were ambushed by Flemish troops waiting to prevent such an attempt. By this point, the only remaining French soldiers were the recalled infantry. Overcome with fear, they abandoned their lines and tried to retreat. The Flemish charged forth and killed many while pursuing the rest over . Unusually for the period, the Flemish infantry took few if any of the French knights prisoner for ransom, in revenge for the French &quot;cruelty&quot;.

The &quot;Annals of Ghent&quot; concludes its description of the battle:
==Aftermath==
With the French army defeated, the Flemish consolidated their control over the area. Kortrijk castle surrendered on 13 July and John of Namur entered Ghent on 14 July. The patrician regime in the city and in Ypres, who had supported the French, were overthrown and replaced. Guilds, which had contributed heavily to the Flemish cause, were also officially recognised.

The battle soon became known as the Battle of the Golden Spurs, after the 500 pairs of spurs taken from the bodies of the French dead and presented as a gift to the nearby Church of Our Lady. After the Battle of Roosebeke in 1382, the spurs were taken back by the French and Kortrijk was sacked by Charles VI in retaliation.

According to the &quot;Annals&quot;, the French lost more than 1,000 men during the battle, including 75 important nobles. These included:
*Robert II, Count of Artois and his half-brother James
*Raoul of Clermont-Nesle, Lord of Nesle, Constable of France
*Guy I of Clermont, Lord of Breteuil, Marshal of France
*Simon de Melun, Lord of La Loupe and Marcheville, Marshal of France
*John I of Ponthieu, Count of Aumale
*John II of Trie, Count of Dammartin
*John II of Brienne, Count of Eu
*John of Avesnes, Count of Ostrevent, son of John II, Count of Holland
*Godfrey of Brabant, Lord of Aarschot and Vierzon, and his son John of Vierzon
*Jacques de Châtillon, Lord of Leuze and former royal governor
*Pierre de Flotte, chief advisor to Philip IV the Fair
*Raoul de Nesle, son of John III, Count of Soissons.

The Flemish victory at Kortrijk in 1302 was quickly reversed by the French. In 1304, the French destroyed the Flemish fleet at the Battle of Zierikzee and won a major victory at the Battle at Mons-en-Pévèle. In June 1305, negotiations between the two sides led to the Peace of Athis-sur-Orge in which the Flemish were forced to pay the French substantial tribute. Robert of Béthune subsequently led a war of resistance to French occupation between 1314 and 1320, but was eventually defeated.

The town of Kortrijk hosts many monuments and a museum dedicated to the battle.

==Historical significance==

===Effect on warfare===
The Battle of the Golden Spurs had been seen as the first example of the gradual &quot;Infantry Revolution&quot; in medieval warfare across Europe during the 14th century. Conventional military theory placed emphasis on mounted and heavily armoured knights which were considered essential to military success. Infantry remained, however, an essential arm in parts of Europe, such as the British Isles, throughout the Middle Ages. This meant that warfare was the preserve of a wealthy elite of &quot;bellatores&quot; (nobles specialized in warfare) serving as men-at-arms. The fact that this form of army, which was expensive to maintain, could be defeated by militia drawn from the &quot;lower orders&quot; led to a gradual change in the nature of warfare during the subsequent century. The tactics and composition of the Flemish army at Courtrai were later copied or adapted at the battles of Bannockburn (1314), Crécy (1346), Aljubarrota (1385), Sempach (1386), Agincourt (1415), Grandson (1476) and in the battles of the Hussite Wars (1419–34). As a result, cavalry became less important and nobles more commonly fought dismounted. The comparatively low costs of militia armies allowed even small states (such as the Swiss) to raise militarily significant armies and meant that local rebellions were more likely to achieve military success.

===In Flemish culture and politics===
Interest in medieval history in Belgium emerged during the 19th century alongside the rise of Romanticism in art and literature. According to the historian Jo Tollebeek, it soon became connected to nationalist ideals because the Middle Ages were &quot;a period that could be linked with the most important contemporary aspirations&quot; of romantic nationalism.
Amid that resurgence, the Battle of the Golden Spurs became the subject of an &quot;extensive cult&quot; in 19th- and 20th-century Flanders. After Belgian independence in 1830, the Flemish victory was interpreted as a symbol of local pride. The battle was painted in 1836 by a leading Romanticist painter Nicaise de Keyser. Probably inspired by the painting, the Flemish writer Hendrik Conscience used it as the centerpiece of his classic 1838 novel, &quot;The Lion of Flanders&quot; (&quot;&quot;) which brought the events to a mass audience for the first time. It inspired an engraving by the artist James Ensor in 1895. A large monument and triumphal arch were also subsequently erected on the site of the battle between 1906 and 1908. The battle was evoked by King Albert I at the start of World War I to inspire bravery among Flemish soldiers as an equivalent of the Walloon six hundred Franchimontois of 1468. In 1914, the Belgian victory against German cavalry at the Battle of Halen was dubbed the &quot;Battle of the Silver Helmets&quot; in analogy to the Golden Spurs. Its anniversary, 11 July, became an important annual Flemish observance. In 1973, the date was formalised as the official holiday of the Flemish Community.

As the Battle of the Golden Spurs became an important part of Flemish identity, it became increasingly important within the Flemish Movement. Emerging in the 1860s, it sought autonomy or even independence for Flemish (Dutch)-speaking Flanders and became increasingly radical after World War I. The battle was seen as a &quot;milestone&quot; in a historic struggle for Flemish national liberation and a symbol of resistance to foreign rule. Flemish nationalists wrote poems and songs about the battle and celebrated its leaders. As a result of that linguistic-based nationalism, the contribution of French-speaking soldiers and command of the battle by the Walloon noble Guy of Namur was neglected.

<text>Bergerac ( ) is a British crime drama television series. Set in Jersey, it ran from 18 October 1981 to 26 December 1991. Produced by the BBC in association with the Australian Seven Network, and first screened on BBC1, it stars John Nettles as the title character Jim Bergerac, who is initially a detective sergeant in Le Bureau des Étrangers (&quot;The Foreigners&#x27; Office&quot;, a fictional department dealing with non-Jersey residents), within the States of Jersey Police, but later leaves the force and becomes a private investigator.

Westward Studios executive producer Brian Constantine has said that a &quot;Bergerac&quot; reboot was in the final stages of development, and will air in 2025.

==Background==
The series ran from 1981 to 1991. It was created by producer Robert Banks Stewart after an earlier detective series, &quot;Shoestring,&quot; starring Trevor Eve, came to an abrupt end. Like &quot;Shoestring&quot;, the series begins with a man returning to work after a particularly bad period in his life: Eddie Shoestring from a nervous breakdown; Jim Bergerac from alcoholism and from a crushed and badly-broken leg.

&quot;Bergerac&quot; sometimes dealt with controversial topics; for example, when an old man is unmasked as a Nazi war criminal, his age raised various moral dilemmas. Supernatural elements occasionally appear in the series, and some episodes end with unpleasant twists, as in &quot;Offshore Trades&quot; and &quot;A Hole In The Bucket&quot;.

The final episode filmed was the 1991 Christmas Special titled &quot;All for Love&quot;, set partly in Bath. The final scene provides a strong hint about Bergerac&#x27;s future, after Charlie Hungerford recommends Bergerac for a new position heading an expanded Bureau des Étrangers covering the whole of the Channel Islands following its success in Jersey.

The show is repeated on channels such as Alibi and Drama. On 24 February 2014, the BBC started a rerun of the series on daytime afternoons on BBC Two. The repeats concluded with series 3, in order to avoid showing the Haut de la Garenne location, a former children&#x27;s home which had been the focus of an investigation into historic child abuse which identified a number of instances of abuse towards its former residents.

==Lead character and casting==
Jim Bergerac is a complex character, presented by the series as a somewhat unorthodox police officer. He is recovering from alcoholism, partly resulting from an unpleasant divorce.

A Jersey native, he returns to the island at the start of the series after recuperating in England from ill health, dipsomania and major surgery on his leg following an accident caused by his drinking heavily prior to an attempted arrest. The accident is shown in episode two as a flashback: Bergerac was swigging brandy during a surveillance when he noticed his suspect and gave chase. He attempted to prevent the man&#x27;s escape by leaping onto his boat. Under the influence of his drinking, he slipped back and his left leg was crushed against the harbour wall by the boat.

As a result of this accident, Bergerac begins episode one deemed unfit to serve, but he seeks to remain on the police force. While his status is being considered, he is key to solving a case with old colleagues in the recently formed &quot;Bureau des Étrangers&quot;; he is then posted to that unit and does well. By the end of the series, Bergerac has become a private detective.

As an aspect of his unorthodox behaviour, Bergerac drives a burgundy 1947 Triumph Roadster instead of an approved police vehicle.

According to a 2001 interview with Robert Banks Stewart, John Nettles was cast on his insistence. He said, &quot;A programme like that would never get made today without having a household name, but back then I fought to have John Nettles play Bergerac because he was right for it.&quot;

=== Romance ===
Bergerac&#x27;s relationships with women are a frequent theme, often as a subplot to the main crime investigation. Bergerac&#x27;s girlfriends include Francine Leland (Cécile Paoli) (who had been the fiancée of a dead colleague), Marianne Bellshade (Celia Imrie), Susan Young (Louise Jameson) and Danielle Aubry (Thérèse Liotard). He has several encounters with ex-wife Deborah (Deborah Grant), who has custody of their daughter Kim (Lindsay Heath).

==Other characters==
The main supporting character was Jim Bergerac&#x27;s former father-in-law Charlie Hungerford (played by Terence Alexander). Charlie was a lovable rogue and would-be tycoon often involved in shady dealings, but paradoxically something of an innocent. Bergerac usually had a good relationship with him, although in the first episode, &quot;Picking It Up&quot;, they were not on the best of terms. Charlie was involved in all but two of the 87 episodes.

Other regular characters in the series included Bergerac&#x27;s ex-wife, Deborah (Deborah Grant), and his boss, Superintendent Barney Crozier (Sean Arnold), initially an inspector (promoted from sergeant immediately before the first episode) and later chief inspector. Bergerac had several sidekicks who were generally detective constables.

Bergerac had an ongoing flirtatious relationship with glamorous jewel thief Philippa Vale (Liza Goddard), who went by the nickname of the Ice Maiden (Series 3: &quot;Ice Maiden&quot;, Series 4: &quot;Return of the Ice Maiden&quot;, Series 5: &quot;SPARTA&quot;, and Series 7: &quot;Old Acquaintance&quot;).

Many well-known actors had guest roles in &quot;Bergerac&quot;, either before or after rising to fame. These include Philip Glenister, Julian Glover, Connie Booth, Greta Scacchi, Ray Winstone, Prunella Scales, Louise Lombard, Ronald Pickup, Norman Wisdom, Charles Gray, John Forgeham, Bernard Hepton, Bill Nighy, Joanne Whalley, and Steve McFadden.

==Locations==
The series played heavily on its Jersey location. The early storylines were usually in and around Jersey with short scenes shot in England and France. In later episodes the action strayed further away from Jersey and was increasingly based in France.

As Jersey is a small island, most of the filming locations there can be tracked down with ease. Jim Bergerac and Susan Young&#x27;s flat was located just above St Aubin, a few doors along from the Somerville Hotel; part of the interior was shot within another flat at Gorey, six miles away. Jim&#x27;s original home in the first few series was submerged when the States of Jersey flooded the valley to create the Queen&#x27;s Valley reservoir in 1991. Plans for this reservoir were referred to at the start of series four, when Bergerac was forced to seek new accommodation because of them, in the process meeting an estate agent who became his lover.

One of the main locations of the series achieved later notoriety. The Bureau des Étrangers from the third season onwards was located at Haut de la Garenne, a former children&#x27;s home which in February 2008 became the focus of the Jersey child abuse investigation. The building, on Mont de la Garenne overlooking Mont Orgueil and the Royal Bay of Grouville, ceased being a children&#x27;s home in 1983 (before the series started filming there) and was re-opened as Jersey&#x27;s first and only youth hostel.

The original Bureau in the TV series was located in St Helier&#x27;s Royal Square, but filming there became difficult after the first series as the pretence of filming a documentary series was spoilt by public recognition of Bergerac&#x27;s Triumph.
Windward House, Le Mont Sohier, St Brelade (built in 1924, since demolished c.2010) with lush grounds overlooking Ouaisné and St Brelade&#x27;s Bay, was used internally and externally throughout all nine series and the Christmas specials. This pink-and-grey building, with a white pillared entrance, first appeared in series 1, episode 6, &quot;Portrait of Yesterday&quot;, as the home and wedding venue of the incidental characters. Windward House then reappeared from series 2, episode 1, as Charlie Hungerford&#x27;s main residence, where he hosted a large garden fête, and then in almost every episode of the show—used either as part of the central plot or as a backdrop for family gatherings, drinks parties, business meetings, barbecues and marquee events. The entire house was used over time, particularly the living room with French windows, dining room, conservatory and long gallery hallways. External filming regularly included the gardens, paddock, driveways, fruit gardens, greenhouse, cider press and rockery.

Noirmont Manor, Noirmont, was Charlie Hungerford&#x27;s home throughout series one.

As the series ran for a decade, directors found it increasingly difficult to find locations which had not been overused. While promoting his film &quot;White Noise&quot; in an interview with &quot;Xpose&quot; magazine, director Geoffrey Sax described how he made an effort to find new locations, only to return for the actual shoot to find camera tripod marks in the ground, another director having shot there in the meantime. They became tourist attractions, with signs advertising &quot;Visit Bergerac&#x27;s Location&quot; or &quot;See Bergerac&#x27;s Car&quot;.

Plot lines occasionally took the action onto the British mainland, particularly London, and Richmond riverside figured prominently.

==Home media==
&quot;Bergerac&quot; was made available on DVD by 2 Entertain / Cinema Club. The first series was released on 8 May 2006, including audio commentaries on three episodes.

Mistakes occurred in the supply of the source material for the DVD releases, which meant the episodes of series 1 and 6 were edited versions broadcast originally on UK daytime television. This was amended for &quot;Bergerac: The Complete Collection&quot;, a 27-DVD box set released in 2009 which includes all episodes in their full length.

In June 2021, the first two series became available on BritBox and series 3 to series 9 with all the Christmas special episodes became available in October 2021.

As of September 2021, seasons 1–3 and 5–9 were available to stream in the United States via Amazon Prime with a BritBox subscription.

== Theme music ==
The &quot;Bergerac&quot; theme music, composed by George Fenton, featured a reggae and accordion refrain. In 1982, he won a BAFTA Best Original Television Music award for the music. In 2018, a DJ known as Youngr re-recorded the track, entitled &quot;Bergerac Remastered&quot;, with a video shot in locations around Jersey.

==Reboot==

Writer Toby Whithouse will helm a new six-episode &quot;Bergerac&quot; series to be aired in 2025. Damien Molony has been cast in the title role, with filming set to take place in Jersey and Plymouth for exterior and interior shots.

Co-stars include Zoë Wanamaker as a gender flipped Charlie Hungerford, and Robert Gilbert as Barney Crozier. New characters include Arthur Wakefield (Philip Glenister), Margaret Heaton (Pippa Haywood), Uma Dalal (Sasha Behar) and Kara (Celine Arden).

== In popular culture ==
Portions of &quot;Bergerac&quot;&#x27;s credits were featured in the &quot;Black Mirror&quot; episode &quot;Loch Henry&quot;: in the episode&#x27;s story, it is revealed that VHS recordings of &quot;Bergerac&quot; had been taped over with snuff films.

<doc id="360251" wikidata="Q207661" url="?curid=360251" title="A Saucerful of Secrets">
<text>A Saucerful of Secrets is the second studio album by the English rock band Pink Floyd, released on 28 June 1968 by EMI Columbia in the UK and in the US by Tower Records. The mental health of the singer and guitarist Syd Barrett deteriorated during recording, so David Gilmour was recruited; Barrett left the band before the album&#x27;s completion.

Whereas Barrett had been the primary songwriter on Pink Floyd&#x27;s debut album, &quot;The Piper at the Gates of Dawn&quot; (1967), on &quot;A Saucerful of Secrets&quot; each member contributed songwriting and lead vocals. Gilmour appeared on all but two songs, while Barrett contributed to three. &quot;Set the Controls for the Heart of the Sun&quot; is the only song on which all five members appear.

&quot;A Saucerful of Secrets&quot; reached number nine in the UK charts, but did not chart in the US until April 2019, peaking at number 158. It received mostly positive reviews, though many critics have deemed it inferior to &quot;The Piper at the Gates of Dawn&quot;.

==Recording==

Pink Floyd released their debut album, &quot;The Piper at the Gates of Dawn,&quot; in August 1967. Work began on &quot;A Saucerful of Secrets&quot; in the same month at EMI Studios (now Abbey Road Studios) in London with the producer Norman Smith. The first songs recorded were &quot;Scream Thy Last Scream&quot;, written by the singer and guitarist, Syd Barrett, with additional vocals sung by the drummer, Nick Mason; &quot;Set the Controls for the Heart of the Sun&quot;, written by the bassist, Roger Waters, and despite having only two complete takes of the song, &quot;Scream Thy Last Scream&quot; was viewed as a potential single. Both songs were recorded on 7 and 8 August 1967. They were planned for release as a single on 8 September, but this was vetoed by Pink Floyd&#x27;s record company, EMI.

Following a brief European tour, in early October of &#x27;67, the band returned to the studio and recorded &quot;Vegetable Man&quot;, another Syd Barrett composition (who also performed lead vocals), and &quot;Scream Thy Last Scream&quot; which was again rescheduled for release, only this time with &quot;Vegetable Man&quot; as the B-side, but it was once again vetoed by their label EMI. The band returned on 19 October to record &quot;Jugband Blues&quot;, another Barrett composition, with Smith booking a Salvation Army band on Barrett&#x27;s recommendation. During these sessions, Barrett, overdubbed slide guitar onto &quot;Remember a Day&quot;, an outtake from &quot;The Piper at the Gates of Dawn&quot;. In late October, the band took a break from the album sessions to record what was to be the third and final Pink Floyd single by Barrett, &quot;Apples and Oranges&quot;, on 26 and 27 October. A few days later, they recorded what would become the B-side, &quot;Paint Box&quot;, before leaving for their first US tour. On 17 November 1967, &quot;Apples and Oranges&quot; was released as a single following Pink Floyd&#x27;s US tour. Despite the band performing it on American Bandstand on 7 November which was their US television debut, it failed to chart higher than number 55 in the UK charts, thus failing to match the chart success of their earlier singles &quot;See Emily Play&quot; and &quot;Arnold Layne&quot;. Roger Waters later blamed Norman Smith&#x27;s production for the single&#x27;s failure to top the charts, stating &quot;&#x27;Apples and Oranges&#x27; was destroyed by the production. It&#x27;s a fucking good song&quot;. When asked in December 1967 by &quot;Melody Maker&quot; about the song&#x27;s disappointing chart run, Barrett replied he &quot;couldn’t care less really. All we can do is make records which we like. If the kids don&#x27;t, then they won&#x27;t buy it. All middle men are bad.&quot;

Around this time, the mental health of guitarist Syd Barrett was being called into question by the band; he was often unresponsive and would not play, leading to the cancellation of several performances and Pink Floyd&#x27;s first US tour. In December 1967, reaching a crisis point with Barrett, Pink Floyd added the guitarist David Gilmour as the fifth member. According to Jenner, the group planned that Gilmour would &quot;cover for [Barrett&#x27;s] eccentricities&quot;. When this proved unworkable, &quot;Syd was just going to write. Just to try to keep him involved.&quot;

For two days from 10 January 1968, Pink Floyd reconvened at EMI Studios, attempting to work on older tracks: Waters&#x27; vocals and keyboardist Richard Wright&#x27;s organ were overdubbed onto &quot;Set the Controls for the Heart of the Sun&quot;, while drummer Nick Mason added vocals to &quot;Scream Thy Last Scream&quot;.

From 12 January till the 20th, Pink Floyd performed briefly as a five-piece. Gilmour played and sang while Barrett wandered around on stage, occasionally joining in with the playing. Between these gigs, the group rehearsed new songs written by Waters on 15 and 16 January. During the next session, on 18 January, the band jammed on rhythm tracks, joined by Smith; Barrett did not attend. On 24 and 25 January, they recorded a song logged as &quot;The Most Boring Song I&#x27;ve Ever Heard Bar 2&quot; at EMI. The band recorded &quot;Let There Be More Light&quot;, &quot;Corporal Clegg&quot; (which features lead vocals by Mason), and &quot;See-Saw&quot;, all without Barrett, though manager Andrew King said Barrett performed the slide solo at the end of &quot;Let There Be More Light&quot;.

On 26 January 1968, when the band was driving to a show at Southampton University, they decided not to pick up Barrett. Barrett was finally ousted in late January 1968, leaving the band to finish the album without him. &quot;Set the Controls for the Heart of the Sun&quot; is the only song on which all five band members appeared. With Barrett removed from the sessions, the band struggled to come up with new material, but in February 1968 recorded Wright&#x27;s &quot;It Would Be So Nice&quot; and Waters&#x27; &quot;Julia Dream&quot;. In early February, it was announced Waters’ track &quot;Corporal Clegg&quot; would be the next single; however, due to pressure from the label, the song was earmarked for the album, and &quot;It Would Be So Nice&quot; was released in April, with &quot;Julia Dream&quot; on the B-side. The single failed to make the charts.

Throughout April, the band took stock of their work. Waters blocked &quot;Vegetable Man&quot; and &quot;Scream Thy Last Scream&quot; from the album. Years later Nick Mason had offered the following opinion on the two tracks not being included in the album: &quot;they were initially intended to be potential singles, but were never satisfactorily finished. Both of these had vocals from me included in the mix, which may have had some bearing on the matter.&quot;
In lieu of the two songs, the band retained &quot;Jugband Blues&quot; and &quot;Set the Controls for the Heart of the Sun&quot;. Without enough material to fill an album, the band started putting together music that became the title track. Mason and Waters planned it out as if it were an architectural design, including peaks and troughs. Smith did not approve, telling them they had to stick to three-minute songs. On 25 June, the band recorded another session for the BBC radio show &quot;Top Gear&quot;, including two tracks from the album: the session featured two tracks from Saucerful: &quot;Let There Be More Light&quot; and an abridged version of the title track, &quot;The Massed Gadgets of Hercules&quot;.

==Songs==
Unlike &quot;The&quot; &quot;Piper at the Gates of Dawn&quot;, which was dominated by Barrett&#x27;s compositions, &quot;A Saucerful of Secrets&quot; contains only one Barrett original: &quot;Jugband Blues&quot;. AllMusic described that with &quot;A Saucerful of Secrets&quot;, &quot;the band begin to map out the dark and repetitive pulses that would characterize their next few records.&quot; Wright sings or shares lead vocals on four of the album&#x27;s seven songs, and contributes vocals on the eleven-and-a-half-minute instrumental opus &quot;A Saucerful of Secrets&quot;, making this the only Pink Floyd album where his vocal contributions outnumber those of the rest of the band.

With Barrett seemingly detached from proceedings, it came down to Waters and Wright to provide adequate material. The opening, &quot;Let There Be More Light&quot;, written by Waters, continues the space rock approach established by Barrett on their debut LP on songs like &quot;Astronomy Domine&quot; and &quot;Interstellar Overdrive&quot;. &quot;Let There Be More Light&quot; evolved from a bass riff that was part of &quot;Interstellar Overdrive&quot;. Both &quot;Remember a Day&quot; and &quot;See-Saw&quot; use a similar whimsical approach that Barrett had also established on their debut. Wright remained critical of his early contributions to the band.

&quot;Set the Controls for the Heart of the Sun&quot; was first performed with Barrett in 1967. The success of the track was such that it remained in their live setlist until 1973 where it appeared in a greatly extended form. Waters later performed the track during solo concerts from 1984 and later. Waters borrowed the lyrics from a book of Chinese poetry from the Tang dynasty, like Barrett had used in &quot;Chapter 24&quot;.

&quot;Corporal Clegg&quot; is the first Pink Floyd song to address issues of war, a theme which would endure throughout the career of Waters as a songwriter for the band, culminating on the 1983 album &quot;The Final Cut&quot;. The title track was originally written as a new version of &quot;Nick&#x27;s Boogie&quot;. The track is titled as four parts on &quot;Ummagumma&quot;. A staple in the band&#x27;s live set until summer 1972, a live version of the song was recorded on 27 April 1969 at the Mothers Club in Birmingham for inclusion on &quot;Ummagumma&quot;.

&quot;Jugband Blues&quot; is often thought to refer to Barrett&#x27;s departure from the group (&quot;It&#x27;s awfully considerate of you to think of me here / And I&#x27;m most obliged to you for making it clear that I&#x27;m not here&quot;). A promotional video was recorded for the track. The band&#x27;s management wanted to release the song as a single, but it was vetoed by the band and Smith.

===Unreleased songs===

As well as &quot;Jugband Blues&quot;, the album was to include &quot;Vegetable Man&quot;, another Barrett composition. The song was to appear on a single as the B-side to Barrett&#x27;s &quot;Scream Thy Last Scream&quot;. The band performed &quot;Jugband Blues&quot;, &quot;Vegetable Man&quot; and &quot;Scream Thy Last Scream&quot; for a &quot;Top Gear&quot; session, recorded on 20 December 1967, and broadcast on the 31st. Two additional Barrett songs, &quot;In the Beechwoods&quot;, and &quot;No Title&quot; (frequently referred to on bootlegs as &quot;Sunshine&quot;), were recorded early in the album sessions. After years of only being available via bootlegs, &quot;Vegetable Man&quot;, &quot;Scream Thy Last Scream&quot;, and &quot;In the Beechwoods&quot; were officially released on &quot;The Early Years 1965–1972&quot; compilation. At least one other song, &quot;John Latham&quot;, was recorded during these sessions and has been released.

==Album cover==
&quot;A Saucerful of Secrets&quot; was the first of several Pink Floyd album covers created by the design group Hipgnosis. After the Beatles, it was the second time that EMI had permitted one of their acts to hire outside designers for an album jacket. The cover, designed by Storm Thorgerson, contains an image of Doctor Strange from issue #158 of the comic book &quot;Strange Tales&quot;, illustrated by Marie Severin.

==Release and reception==

The album was released in the UK on 28 June 1968 on EMI&#x27;s Columbia label, reaching number 9 in the UK charts. It was released in the US by the Tower Records division of Capitol, where it was the only Pink Floyd album not to chart until 2019, when it peaked at 158. However, when reissued as &quot;A Nice Pair&quot; with the original version of &quot;The Piper at the Gates of Dawn&quot; after the success of &quot;The Dark Side of the Moon&quot;, the album did chart at number 36 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. &quot;Let There Be More Light&quot; was released as a single, backed with &quot;Remember a Day&quot;, in the US on 19 August 1968. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; was unfavourable, writing that the album was &quot;not as interesting as their first&quot; and &quot;rather mediocre&quot;, highlighting the reduced contributions from Barrett. However, in recent years via &quot;The Rolling Stone Album Guide&quot;, it was given an updated rating of 3 stars, which indicates a positive rating.

The stereo mix of the album was first released on CD in 1988, and in 1992 was digitally remastered and reissued as part of the &quot;Shine On&quot; box set. The remastered stereo CD was released on its own in 1994 in the UK and the US. The mono version of the album has never been officially released on CD. The stereo mix was remastered and re-issued in 2011 by Capitol/EMI as part of the &quot;Discovery&quot; series, and again in 2016 by Sony Music under the Pink Floyd Records label. The mono mix was reissued on vinyl for Record Store Day in April 2019 by Sony Music and Warner Music Group under the Pink Floyd Records label. The album finally charted on the Billboard 200 as a standalone peaking at No. 158 when the mono mix was re-released for Record Store Day.

In a retrospective review for AllMusic, Richie Unterberger draws attention to the album&#x27;s &quot;gentle, fairy-tale ambience&quot;, with songs that move from &quot;concise and vivid&quot; to &quot;spacy, ethereal material with lengthy instrumental passages&quot;. In a review for BBC Music, Daryl Easlea said &quot;Saucerful&quot; was &quot;not without filler&quot;, adding that &quot;Jugband Blues&quot; was &quot;the most chilling&quot; song on the album.

In 2014, Mason named &quot;A Saucerful of Secrets&quot; his favourite Pink Floyd album: &quot;I think there are ideas contained there that we have continued to use all the way through our career. I think [it] was a quite good way of marking Syd&#x27;s departure and Dave&#x27;s arrival. It&#x27;s rather nice to have it on one record, where you get both things. It&#x27;s a cross-fade rather than a cut.&quot;

<text>John Tzetzes (; , Constantinople – 1180, Constantinople) was a Byzantine poet and grammarian who lived at Constantinople in the 12th century. He is known for making significant contributions in preserving much valuable information from ancient Greek literature and scholarship. Of his numerous works, the most important one is the &quot;Book of Histories&quot;, also known as (&#x27;Thousands&#x27;). The work is a long poem containing knowledge that is unavailable elsewhere and serves as commentary on Tzetzes&#x27;s own letters. Two of his other important works are the on the &quot;Iliad&quot; and the &quot;Odyssey&quot;, which are long didactic poems containing interpretations of Homeric theology.

== Biography ==
Tzetzes described himself as pure Greek on his father&#x27;s side and part Iberian (Georgian) on his mother&#x27;s side. In his works, Tzetzes states that his grandmother was a relative of the Georgian Bagratid princess Maria of Alania who came to Constantinople with her and later became the second wife of the &quot;sebastos&quot; Constantine Keroularios, &quot;megas droungarios&quot; and nephew of the patriarch Michael Keroularios.

He worked as a secretary to a provincial governor for a time and later began to earn a living by teaching and writing. He was described as vain, seems to have resented any attempt at rivalry, and violently attacked his fellow grammarians. Owing to a lack of written material, he was obliged to trust to his memory; therefore caution has to be exercised in reading his work. However, he was learned, and made a great contribution to the furtherance of the study of ancient Greek literature.

== Works ==
Tzetzes published a collection of 107 of his &quot;Letters&quot; addressed partly to fictitious/unidentified personages, and partly to influential men and women of the writer&#x27;s time. They contain a considerable amount of social and biographical information, and are full of learned allusions to history, rhetoric, and mythology.

These letters became the springboard for what became during the Renaissance perhaps the most influential of his many works, the &quot;Book of Histories&quot;, usually called &quot;Chiliades&quot; (&quot;thousands&quot;) from the arbitrary division by its first editor (N. Gerbel, 1546) into books each containing 1,000 lines. The work consists of 12,674 lines of political verse, divided into 660 topics, each of which is a gloss on a literary, historical, or other learned reference in one of his published letters. The first 141 histories serve as poetic footnotes to a verse letter Tzetzes addressed to John Lachanas, an official in Constantinople.

This collection of literary, historical, theological, and antiquarian miscellanies provides an important snapshot of the intellectual world of Constantinople in the mid-12th century, and also preserves fragments of more than 200 ancient authors, including many whose works have been lost. The author subsequently brought out a revised edition with marginal notes in prose and verse (ed. T. Kiessling, 1826; on the sources see C. Harder, &quot;De J. T. historiarum fontibus quaestiones selectae&quot;, diss., Kiel, 1886).

Tzetzes supplemented Homer&#x27;s &quot;Iliad&quot; by a work that begins with the birth of Paris and continues the tale to the Achaeans&#x27; return home.

The &quot;Homeric Allegories&quot;, in &quot;political&quot; verse and dedicated initially to the German-born empress Irene and then to Constantine Cotertzes, are two didactic poems, the first based on the &quot;Iliad&quot; and the second based on the &quot;Odyssey,&quot; in which Homer and the Homeric theology are set forth and then explained by means of three kinds of allegory: euhemeristic (), anagogic () and physic (). These works were translated into English in 2015 and 2019 by Adam J. Goldwyn and Dimitra Kokkini.

In the &quot;Antehomerica&quot;, Tzetzes recalls the events taking place before Homer&#x27;s &quot;Iliad&quot;. This work was followed by the &quot;Homerica&quot;, covering the events of the &quot;Iliad&quot;, and the &quot;Posthomerica&quot;, reporting the events taking place between the &quot;Iliad&quot; and the &quot;Odyssey&quot;. All three are currently available in English translations.

Tzetzes also wrote commentaries on a number of Greek authors, the most important of which is that elucidating the obscure &quot;Cassandra&quot; or &quot;Alexandra&quot; of the Hellenistic poet Lycophron, usually called &quot;On Lycophron&quot; (edited by K.O. Müller, 1811), in the production of which his brother Isaac is generally associated with him. Mention may also be made of a dramatic sketch in iambic verse, in which the caprices of fortune and the wretched lot of the learned are described; and of an iambic poem on the death of the emperor Manuel I Komnenos, noticeable for introducing at the beginning of each line the last word of the line preceding it (both in Pietro Matranga, &quot;Anecdota Graeca&quot; 1850).

For the other works of Tzetzes see J. A. Fabricius, &quot;Bibliotheca graeca&quot; (ed. Harles), xi.228, and Karl Krumbacher, &quot;Geschichte der byz. Litt.&quot; (2nd edition, 1897); monograph by G. Hart, &quot;De Tzetzarum nomine, vitis, scriptis,&quot; in Jahn&#x27;s &quot;Jahrbucher für classische Philologie. Supplementband xii&quot; (Leipzig, 1881).

<text>Le Chambon-sur-Lignon (, literally &quot;Le Chambon on Lignon&quot;; ) is a commune in the Haute-Loire department in south-central France.

Residents have been primarily Huguenot or Protestant since the 17th century. During World War II these Huguenot residents made the commune a haven for Jews and other refugees fleeing from Nazi Germany and countries controlled by Nazi Germany. The refugees were hidden both within the town and in the countryside or were helped to flee to neutral Switzerland. Humanitarian organizations, both Jewish and non-Jewish, and local religious leaders had a priority of hiding children to protect them from deportation to Nazi concentration camps. Estimates of the number of people sheltered in Chambon and its area range from 800 to 5,000. In 1990 the town was one of two collectively honoured as the Righteous Among the Nations by Yad Vashem in Israel for saving Jews in Nazi-occupied Europe. The other awardee was the Dutch village of Nieuwlande.

==Geography==

Le Chambon-sur-Lignon is located on the Vivaris-Lignon plateau in the highland Massif Central of southern France. The town lies in the middle of the commune, on the right bank of the Lignon du Velay River, which flows north-northwestward through the commune and forms part of its northwestern border. Le Chambon is one of the three largest villages of seventeen on the plateau. The region has traditionally been isolated with a population of mostly farmers who raised cattle and sheep. 

===Climate===
Le Chambon-sur-Lignon has a Cfb climate (Mild temperate, warm summers, cool winters) by the Köppen climate classification system. The altitude of almost results in cooler summers and colder winters than in most places of similar latitudes in France. 
==Early history==
In the 16th century, Chambon was a refuge for French Protestants (Huguenots) who fled persecution by Roman Catholics, by taking refuge in the remote Massif Central. Chambon and its region, still called the &quot;Protestant Mountain&quot;, continues to have mostly Protestant residents.

Tourism became important to the economy in the late 19th century. Among the tourists were children brought to Chambon from polluted industrial cities for their health and wealthy Protestants who built summer homes. By the 1940s, the population of Chambon was &quot;900 in the winter, 6,000 in the summer, and 4,000 in September.&quot; The influx of tourists resulted in the establishment of 42 hotels, 50 &quot;pensions&quot;, and 12 youth hostels in the region, most of them in the village of Chambon. Tourism declined during World War II and the existence of these unused facilities, the familiarity of the residents with outsiders, and the town&#x27;s history as a refuge against repression contributed to the welcome Chambon and its region gave refugees.

==World War II refugees==

The influx of refugees into Chambon and the Haute Loire department began in the 1930s with the coming of power of the Nazis in Germany in 1933 and the defeat of the Republicans in the Spanish Civil War in 1939. Chambon was not especially welcoming to these first refugees. In 1939, Spanish refugees were asked to leave at the beginning of tourist season and in 1940 anti-Nazi refugees, mostly Jews, were interned in a camp near Chambon before being sent to the Gurs internment camp as &quot;undesirable&quot; aliens in October. Poor conditions, including starvation, for people confined in the internment camps scattered around southern France led humanitarian organizations involved in aid to the internees to establish a priority of getting people, especially children, out of the internment camps, even though that policy could result in separation of children from their parents. In August 1942 when the first deportations of Jews from southern (Vichy) France to Germany took place the magnitude of the threat to the lives of Jews became apparent.

Jews were the most numerous of the refugees in Chambon during World War II but the town also sheltered anti-Nazi Germans and people active in the French Resistance to the German occupation or avoiding compulsory labor service, the Service du travail obligatoire, imposed on France by Germany. Whole families from cities such as Nice and Lyon sought shelter in Chambon. Many of the refugees continued onward from Chambon to safety in neutral Switzerland, assisted by the former mayor of Chambon, Charles Guillon. 

Several persons were prominent as participants in Chambon&#x27;s shelter of Jews and anti-Nazi refugees: Protestant pastors and pacifists André Trocmé and Eduoard Theis; Charles Guillon; and schoolteacher Roger Darcissac who forged documents for Jews to conceal their identities. Schoolteacher Daniel Trocmé, cousin of André, died in a German concentration camp. All 13 Protestant pastors in Chambon participated in the rescue efforts.

The Chambon region attracted the attention of French and international humanitarian organizations operating in Vichy France. Among the organizations involved were Cimade, a French youth organization, the Jewish OSE, the Swiss Red Cross, the American Friends Service Committee (Quakers), and the European Student Relief Fund, represented by an American, Tracy Strong, Jr. The Vichy French, although collaborators with the Germans, were initially amendable to releasing children from the overcrowded camps to live in children&#x27;s homes.

In late 1940, André Trocmé met with Burns Chalmers who worked for the Quaker AFSC, in Marseilles. Chalmers and Trocmé agreed to establish homes for refugee children utilizing the now-vacant tourist hotels in Chambon. Chalmers offered financial support for the venture. One of the advantages of Chambon as a refuge was the abundance of food as compared to the scarcity in other parts of France. In May 1941, the Swiss established the first children&#x27;s home in Chambon. Seven children&#x27;s homes housing 240 children were established by the end of 1942. Former mayor Charles Guillon was well-connected and helped Strong and the YMCA open one of the children&#x27;s home at the Maison des Roches in October 1941. Eighty-six children, at least 46 of whom were Jews, were housed at Maison des Roches for varying periods of time. 

In late summer 1942, Vichy Minister of Youth Georges Lamirand visited Chambon. A delegation of thirty students and two pastors told Lamirand that they would resist any attempt &quot;to molest the Jewish guests in our village.&quot; The first French police raid on Chambon to arrest Jews began on August 26 and lasted three weeks. Twenty-one Jewish students successfully hid in the countryside until the police departed three weeks later. Many of the students made their way to safety in Switzerland. The only successful raid came on June 29, 1943 when fifty German police raided a children&#x27;s home in Chambon and arrested 25 students, 20 of them Jewish, and teacher Daniel Trocmé. Few of those arrested survived the war. Most of the time the French authorities and the German commander in the region chose to ignore the existence of Jewish refugees and anti-Nazi resistors in Chambon. The Germans were well aware of the presence of the Jews and other refugees. They commandeered three hotels in Chambon for convalescence of their wounded and ill soldiers. 

While the children&#x27;s homes received the attention of the humanitarian organizations, many refugee children and families were integrated into the general population and lived with local farmers who made up 70 percent of the region&#x27;s population. Historians have focused on the children&#x27;s homes, but encountered silence about other rescue activities. A teacher said, &quot;Nobody talked about what was going on in Le Chambon...I did not know at all that a colleague with a strong accent who taught Latin and Greek was a rabbi&quot; A pastor said, &quot;we never really discussed refugees...we also never told parishioners that they were hosting Jews, who had become &#x27;non-Jews&#x27; with their new identification papers...if they were hiding someone and were caught, they could always sincerely say, &#x27;I did not know he was Jewish.&#x27;&quot;

Because of the secrecy involved, estimates of the number of Jews rescued in the Chambon region vary widely up to 5,000, counting those who passed through, resided temporarily, or continued onwards to Switzerland. Eight hundred to one thousand is a common estimate of Jews sheltered throughout the war in Chambon.

==Present day==
The ethos and practice of sheltering refugees continues, with migrants coming from many war zones, including Congo, Libya, Rwanda, South Sudan, Kosovo and Chechnya.

In 2021 the commune was bequeathed around €2m by Eric Schwam who was hidden in a school in 1943 and remained until 1950.

==Population==
==Honors==
*In 1981 the entire town was awarded an honorary degree by Haverford College in Pennsylvania in recognition of its humanitarian efforts. 
*In 1982, documentary filmmaker Pierre Sauvage – who was born and sheltered in Le Chambon – returned there to film &quot;Weapons of the Spirit&quot; (1989). 
*In 1990, for risking their lives to rescue Jews, the entire town was recognized as &quot;Righteous Among the Nations&quot;. A small garden and plaque on the grounds of the Yad Vashem memorial to the Holocaust in Israel was dedicated to the people of Chambon-sur-Lignon. 
*In 2004 French President Jacques Chirac officially recognized the heroism of the town. 
*In January 2007 they were honoured along with the other French Righteous Among the Nations in a ceremony at the Panthéon in Paris.

Eric Schwam, an Austrian man who fled the Nazis with his family during the Second World War and found refuge in the village, bequeathed approximately €2 million for the village.

==Education==
The town of Chambon-sur-Lignon was home to Le Collège-Lycée Cévenol International, a private boarding school founded in 1938 by local Protestant ministers André Trocmé and Edouard Theis. The school closed its doors in 2014 due to financial troubles and declining enrollment, three years after the rape and murder of a 14-year-old student.

==Personalities==
Alexander Grothendieck, a central figure of 20th-century mathematics, was among the Jewish children sheltered during the war.

The paternal grandfather of actor Timothée Chalamet was from the town.

==Popular culture==
Malcolm Gladwell uses Chambon-sur-Lignon in his book &quot;David and Goliath&quot; as an example of how the rebellious origin of its people influenced their actions when protecting Jewish people during the Second World War. The town also appears in the last book French author Romain Gary published before his death, &quot;The Kites&quot;, and recounts the bravery of its inhabitants in the face of danger. In R.J. Palacio&#x27;s White Bird, Le Chambon-sur-Lignon is the inspiration for the fictional town of Aubervilliers-aux-Bois.

<doc id="360259" wikidata="Q7043453" url="?curid=360259" title="No. 3 Commando">
<text>No. 3 Commando was a battalion-sized Commando unit raised by the British Army during the Second World War. Formed in July 1940 from volunteers for special service, it was the first such unit to carry the title of &quot;Commando&quot;. Shortly afterwards the unit was involved in a largely unsuccessful raid upon the German-occupied Channel Island of Guernsey.

In 1941 they were involved in successful raids on the Lofoten Islands and Vaagso, in Norway, before taking part in the costly Dieppe raid in August 1942, where the unit was tasked with knocking out a German coastal artillery battery on the eastern flank of the main landings, although due to a chance encounter in the Channel with a German convoy, a large majority of the unit failed to make it ashore.

In early 1943, the unit was sent to Gibraltar before moving to North Africa in April from where they were involved in the Allied invasion of Sicily and operations in Italy prior to being withdrawn to Britain to prepare for Operation Overlord. On D-Day they went ashore on 6 June 1944 as part of the 1st Special Service Brigade tasked with linking up with the 6th Airborne Division on the eastern flank of Sword before being withdrawn. Later they took part in the Allied counterattack during the Ardennes Offensive in early 1945 before taking part in the advance into Germany as part of Operation Plunder.

Following the end of the war, No. 3 Commando carried out occupation duties in Germany before it was disbanded on 4 January 1946.
==History==
===Formation and early raids===
Formed in Plymouth in late June 1940 following the Dunkirk evacuation, under the command of Lieutenant Colonel John Durnford-Slater, No. 3 Commando was the first British unit to use the title of &quot;Commando&quot;. By 5 July 1940 they had been fully raised and a little more than a week later they carried out one of the first Commando raids of the war. This raid, known as Operation Ambassador, which had been hastily organised at the behest of the British prime minister, Winston Churchill, was probing raid on the German-occupied island of Guernsey. As a result of a number of mishaps and hurried planning, the raid proved to be unsuccessful.

In October 1940, as part of a reorganisation of the Commando formations, the unit was amalgamated with No. 8 (Guards) Commando into a single special service battalion known as the 4th Special Service Battalion, under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Robert Laycock. As a part of this organisation, the unit&#x27;s name was changed to &#x27;A&#x27; Special Service Company. At the end of 1940, the special service battalions were reorganised into a headquarters and two Commandos and the name of the unit reverted to No. 3 Commando. In January 1941 the special service battalions were broken up, the Commandos were delinked and raised back to full battalion-sized units themselves.

In March 1941, 250 officers and men from No. 3 Commando took part in the first large-scale Commando raid, which was launched on four ports in the Lofoten Islands in Norway. The raid, codenamed Operation Claymore, proved to be a considerable success, resulting in the capture of a number of wheels of the German Enigma encoding machine which helped the Allies to decode German radio traffic later in the war, as well as the destruction of a considerable amount of petrol and oil and the capture of several hundred Germans.

===Vaagso===

On 27 December 1941, the Commandos carried out another raid in Norway, this time on the port of Vaagso (Nor:Vågsøy) and the island of Maaloy (Måløy) known as Operation Archery. Under overall operational command of Brigadier Joseph (Charles) Haydon who directed the operation from HMS &quot;Kenya&quot;, Nos. 5 and 6 Troops under Major Jack Churchill landed on Maaloy while Durnford-Slater led Nos. 1, 2, 3 and 4 Troops ashore on Vaagso. In addition to the troops from No. 3 Commando, there were two troops from No. 2 Commando acting as the floating reserve.

Following a brief naval bombardment the troops on Maaloy succeeded in securing the island; however, the four troops in Vaagso experienced considerable resistance from the German garrison and their attack up the main street briefly stalled before Durnford-Slater signalled Haydon requesting the floating reserve be released to him and No. 6 Troop under Peter Young were ferried across from Maaloy.

Overhead a considerable air battle ensued, while in the anchorage the naval force continued to bombard the shore line and attack German shipping in the port. On the shore the fighting in the streets continued for a number of hours and as the Commandos advanced up the main street intelligence teams searched buildings for valuable documents before demolition teams planted explosives and destroyed them. Finally, by 13:45 the order for the Commandos to withdraw was given. Withdrawing by troops back down the road, they moved back to the landing craft and by 14:45 they had re-embarked, taking a number of German prisoners and Norwegian volunteers with them.

The overall losses for the Commandos were 19 killed and 57 wounded, the majority of which were from No. 3 Commando while 120 Germans were killed and a further 98 captured.

===Dieppe===
In August 1942 No. 3 Commando was involved in the ill-fated Operation Jubilee, an exploratory raid on Dieppe in France. The plan called for a frontal assault on the port by the Canadian 2nd Division. Before this would take place, however, Troops from No. 3 and 4 Commandos would land at beaches on the eastern and western flanks and neutralise two German artillery batteries that were covering the main anchorage. No. 3 Commando was assigned the task of attacking the Goebbels Battery, landing on the eastern flank, under Durnford-Slater&#x27;s command. The battery was located near Berneval-le-Grand, about half a mile from the sea with steep cliffs in front of it. It was decided that No. 3 Commando would land on two beaches to the east and west of the battery, from which gullies rose towards the battery and which would provide concealment while the Commandos approached the battery.

As the convoy of landing craft and other vessels ferried the Commandos across the English Channel; however, they had a chance encounter with a German tanker escorted by a number of armed trawlers which proceeded to fire upon them. In the confusion that followed a number of the landing craft were damaged and forced to turn back, while others were reported as missing and believed sunk. As a result the decision was made to abandon the attack.

Nevertheless, unbeknown to their commanders and each other, and having lost communications, the seven landing craft that had been reported missing made for their assigned beaches, determined to press on with the attack. In the end two parties landed, one party consisting of six craft carrying approximately 120 men under Captain R.L Willis landed on the beach opposite Le Petit Berneval to the east of the battery—Yellow I—while the other, consisting of only one craft of 20 men from No. 6 Troop under Major Peter Young landed to the west at Yellow II.

Of the 120 men that landed at Yellow I, 37 were killed, 81 were captured, mostly after having been wounded, and just one managed to evade capture and return to Britain. Among those that were killed was Lieutenant Edward Loustalot, a United States Army Ranger, who was the first American soldier to be killed in the European theatre of operations. The smaller party, under Young, however, fared better and managed to advance within of the battery, however, due to lack of numbers they were unable to launch an assault on the battery and instead proceeded to harass the gunners for a number of hours and distract them from their purpose of firing on the anchorage before they were forced to withdraw. They succeeded, albeit briefly, to divert the guns from their task of firing on the ships off the coast. Major Young&#x27;s withdrawal was effected with such haste, and under such heavy fire, that he did not have time to board the Motor Launch (ML346, commanded by Lt A.D. Fear DSC RNVR) on which he returned home; he was towed part of the way, in the water, clinging to a line attached to the stern of the ship.

===Sicily and Italy===
After the Dieppe raid, a long period of lull followed for No. 3 Commando during which time they were based around Weymouth and were brought back up to strength with an intake of 120 former policemen who had volunteered for service with the Commandos and had just completed their training at the Commando Depot at Achnacarry in Scotland. In January 1943, however, the unit received orders to move to Gibraltar, where they were stationed as a precaution in case Germany decided to invade Spain. While there the commanding officer, John Durnford-Slater, carried out reconnaissance of potential targets in Spain from the air and sent officers on leave across the border to gather intelligence.

In April 1943 the unit was moved to North Africa, landing at Algiers before later moving to Alexandria where they began preparing for operations as part of Operation Husky, the Allied invasion of Sicily. On 10 July 1943, landing ahead of the main force near Cassibile, a few miles south of Syracuse on the Sicilian coast, half of No. 3 Commando—Nos. 4, 5 and 6 Troops, under the command of Durnford-Slater, carried out a night time attack on an Italian artillery battery without suffering a single casualty. Meanwhile, Nos. 1, 2 and 3 Troops under the command of Peter Young, carried out a landing at Scoglio Imbiancato, a beach near Fontane Bianche, which was unopposed but a series of navigational delays meant that they landed later than planned. Nevertheless, the two forces managed to link up before capturing the town of Cassibile later that night.

On 13 July, the Commandos embarked once more upon the &quot;Prince Albert&quot; with the task of landing in the Bay of Agnone, behind enemy lines and capture the Ponte dei Malati bridge and hold it, intact, until the 50th Division, which formed the vanguard of the advancing British Eighth Army, under General Bernard Montgomery, could relieve them. It was described as the &quot;most perilous enterprise of its career&quot;.

The landing took place in two waves due to a shortage of landing craft. The first wave hit the beach near Agnone Bagni, about from the bridge, at 22:00 hours and took fire from the Italian defenders almost immediately. Under the leadership of Durnford-Slater, Young and Lieutenant George Herbert, all experienced combat officers, the Commandos eventually managed to fight their way off the beach and push inland. The second wave followed a few hours later, also under fire, and despite one of the eight landing craft running aground on some rocks, most of the men were also able to get off the beach.

The Commandos were involved in a number of minor skirmishes as they advanced towards the bridge, however, by 03:00 on 14 July the lead elements reached the north-east end of the bridge, where Durnford-Slater halted the men to re-organise before launching the assault. Shortly after the assault began, with No. 4 Troop leading the way. Within ten minutes the pillboxes had been cleared and No. 3 Commando, had taken control of the bridge.

With a strength that continued to grow until there was about 350 men around the bridge, the charges that had been placed on the bridge were removed and No. 3 Commando settled in to defend the bridge as they waited for 50th Division to arrive. Over the course of the next few hours they were subjected to mortar fire and shelling from a Panzer IV tank. Eventually, as casualties mounted and their reinforcement became overdue the Commandos were forced to abandon the position, nevertheless they had prevented the bridge from being blown up and it was eventually recaptured as the Eighth Army arrived a short time later. The unit, however, suffered heavily for the success, suffering 30 killed, 66 wounded and 59 missing or captured. The bridge was later renamed No. 3 Commando Bridge in their honour.

At the end of the Sicilian campaign Durnford-Slater took over command of a brigade-sized element consisting of No. 3 and No. 40 (Royal Marine) Commando and the Special Raiding Squadron and as a result Peter Young took over command of the unit. Following this, in late August 1943, after receiving replacements from No. 12 Commando which was in the process of being disbanded, the unit carried out a number of reconnaissance operations across the Strait in preparation for the invasion of Italy.

On 8 September, two troops from No. 3 Commando took part in a dawn landing at Porto San Venere (now Vibo Marina in Calabria) as part of the main invasion, helping to clear the quay. The rest of unit arrived shortly afterwards and then they moved on to Vibo Valentia, where they waited for further orders. On 19 September, No. 3 Commando received orders to proceed to Bari along with the rest of Durnford-Slater&#x27;s brigade. Arriving there on 30 September, two days later 180 men from No. 3 Commando, organised into four troops under Captain Arthur Komrower, embarked from Manfredonia as part of the attack force tasked with capturing the port of Termoli. 

The detachment from No. 3 Commando went ashore in the first wave, securing a bridgehead through which the rest of the force proceeded to advance. By 08:00 on 3 October Termoli had been captured; however a counterattack by 16th Panzer Division continued until early on 6 October, during which No. 3 Commando defended an exposed forward position in what Durnford-Slater described as &quot;probably their finest performance of the war&quot;. Shortly after they received orders to return to the United Kingdom in order to prepare for the invasion of Normandy.

===D-Day and beyond===
After returning from Italy, No. 3 Commando became part of the 1st Special Service Brigade, commanded by Brigadier The Lord Lovat. It marked the end of the unit&#x27;s independence, as from then they were part of a larger organisation, and the role of the Commandos had evolved from small scale raiding and precision operations, to more large scale operations in which they were mainly used as highly trained infantry assault units.

On D-Day, the 1st Special Service Brigade was tasked with linking up with the 6th Airborne Division on the eastern flank of Sword and securing the high ground near La Plein. No. 3 Commando landed at La Breche, west of Ouistreham at 09:05 coming ashore in the second wave. They were engaged before they hit the beach, and three of the landing craft that the Commandos were travelling in were hit by high-velocity shells. Casualties were high, with No. 6 Troop suffering at least 20 wounded, but in the end they were lower than had been expected.

Despite one of the landing craft running aground on a false beach, the majority of the unit crossed the beach and reached the form-up point about inland. Apart from the men from No. 6 Troop which had been wounded in their landing craft, the commanding officer, Peter Young, found that his command was largely intact. Nevertheless, he was unable to begin the advance immediately as the narrow route upon which they were to march was blocked by No. 6 Commando. As a result they were held up in the form-up point for a while, where they were subjected to more German mortar fire.

Later, No. 3 Commando resumed the advance, passing through No. 45 (Royal Marine) Commando&#x27;s positions in Collevile and marching along the road to Saint-Aubin-d&#x27;Arquenay where they met up again with No. 6 Commando. From there they advanced quickly to the bridge that spanned the River Orne, where they linked up with the airborne and glider troops that had seized the bridge in the early hours of the morning. Crossing the bridge, which was still under fire from enemy snipers, Peter Young made contact with the airborne headquarters and was told to take the unit to Le Bas de Ranville instead of advancing on Cabourg. Detaching No. 3 Troop to capture Amfreville and Le Plein, the rest of the No. 3 Commando took up positions as ordered, but were shortly relieved and were able to rejoin No. 3 Troop, tasked with holding the high ground around Le Plein.
On 7 June, a combined force from Nos. 4 and 5 Troops under command of the second-in-command, Major John Pooley, carried out an attack on the Merville battery near the coast where there were still guns firing on the landing beaches. The battery had been taken the previous day by a force from the 9th Parachute Battalion, but had been reoccupied later by the Germans and it was heavily defended by mortars and landmines. Approaching from the south, No. 4 Troop moved across the open ground before taking up position behind the hedgerows 300 yards from the battery and from where laid down covering fire for No. 5 Troop which approached from the east with fixed bayonets.

After a stubborn defence, in which a number of Commandos, including Pooley, were killed, they took the battery, however, shortly afterwards they were counterattacked by German force supported by self-propelled artillery. Casualties during this attack were high and eventually the Commandos were forced to withdraw back to La Plein.

Following this the unit became involved in largely defensive operations as the 1st Special Service Brigade dug in. Nevertheless they kept up the pressure on the Germans by carrying out offensive patrols, small scale raids and sniping. In mid-July a breakout from the beachhead was attempted and the 1st Special Service Brigade moved through the Le Bois de Bavent, a large wooded area, as the Germans began to withdraw. No. 3 Commando was involved in this advance, moving to Varaville where they caught up with the German rearguard and proceeded to clear the village. The advance continued into the following month and on 19 August they were ordered to seize the high ground to the north of Dozule. Attacking at night, the brigade advanced with No. 3 Commando leading the main body behind the vanguard and was able to infiltrate the German positions before the lead sections ran into the German headquarters units.

Over the next five days, the brigade advanced a further before a halt was finally called on 26 August 1944. On 7 September, No. 3 Commando, along with the rest of the 1st Special Service Brigade, were withdrawn from the line and returned to the United Kingdom to prepare to be redeployed to the Far East for operations against the Japanese. They had been in action continuously for 83 days. Shortly after this, No. 3 Commando&#x27;s commanding officer, Peter Young, was promoted to colonel and left to take command of the 3rd Commando Brigade in Burma. As a result, Arthur Komrower took command of No. 3 Commando.

===Final operations===

Throughout 1944, plans were made to send the brigade, which had been renamed the 1st Commando Brigade, to the Far East; however, the effect of the German Ardennes Offensive resulted in these being cancelled. In January 1945, under the command of Brigadier Derek Mills-Roberts, No. 3 Commando was deployed to Asten on the Maas. Later in the month, the unit took up positions at Maeseyck and on 24–25 January, with snow falling on the streets and a heavy German artillery barrage on the town, they took part in an assault on Linne. The assault was only partially successful and due to the destruction of the bridges that spanned the frozen Montforterbeek Canal, the Allies were unable to bring up armour to support No. 3 Commando which had moved across the ice on foot. When the Germans brought up their own tanks, the advance came to a halt.

The Commandos were forced to spend the night freezing in the open in a ditch. The following day, after sappers from the Royal Engineers managed to erect a temporary bridge across the canal, a number of Churchill and Sherman tanks from the 8th Hussars managed to get across and No. 1 and No. 6 Troops climbed on top and advanced across the open ground and into the centre of the town.

A brief period of lull followed as the 1st Commando Brigade prepared to resume operations and on 13 February they were relieved in Linne by No. 46 Royal Marine Commando and went back to Maasbrecht for a rest. The rest did not last long, however, and later in the month they relieved the marines at Smakt and began preparing for Operation Plunder, the crossing of the Rhine. At 22:00 on 23 March 1945, No. 3 Commando crossed the river in Buffalo landing vehicles and began moving on Wesel, where, on 25 March they cleared the centre of the town and captured a large number of German prisoners.

After this the brigade continued to advance, moving through Ruddenburg and Greven before carrying out an attack on Osnabruck, which No. 3 Commando led, on 4 April 1945. The next day, they crossed the Weser River in assault boats and under the cover of darkness carried out a flanking manoeuvre on the Germans occupying the town of Leese. As other elements from the brigade attacked from the east, No. 3 Commando, now under the command of Peter Bartholomew after Komrower had been posted to the Commando Training Depot, carried out a follow-up operation to the north. The operation was an attack on a factory that had been producing V-2 rockets and after No. 3 Commando had captured it with the support of a number of tanks, a search found a number of these weapons, along with about 100 scientists who had been working in the factory.

The advance continued throughout the month and by 29 April, No. 3 Commando crossed the Elbe and carried out an attack on Lauenberg. No. 6 Commando led the assault, with Brigade Headquarters and No. 3 Commando following shortly behind them and established themselves on the high ground, before being clearing operations in Lauenberg itself. By the end of the month all German opposition in the area had ceased and it marked the end of No. 3 Commando&#x27;s offensive operations. On 7 May, when the Germans surrendered, No. 3 Commando was firmly established in Lübeck, where they began the next phase of their service history as occupation troops.

===Disbandment===
After undertaking occupation duties in Germany after the war, No. 3 Commando was finally disbanded on 4 January 1946 while at Victoria Station. During the course of their operational service, members of the unit received the following decorations: 6 Distinguished Service Orders, 23 Military Crosses, 33 Military Medals, 6 Distinguished Conduct Medals, 18 Mentions in Despatches, and 1 George Medal. One member of the unit was also appointed as a Member of the Order of the British Empire.

==Structure==
The Commando units went through a number of organisational structures as the concept was refined and their roles became clearer throughout the course of the war. Upon formation, No. 3 Commando had an establishment of 535 all ranks organised into ten troops each with 50 men underneath a headquarters troop. In late 1940, the Commando units were merged into a special service brigade which was made up of five special service battalions, each of which were made up of two company-sized elements. By the end of the year, this was changed again as the battalions were organised around a headquarters and two Commandos. The special service battalion organisation was discontinued in March 1941, and the unit establishment was set at 470 all ranks, with a headquarters troop of 80 officers and men and six troops of three officers and 62 other ranks.

<text>Karl Ludwig Lehrs (January 14, 1802 – June 9, 1878), was a German classical scholar.

Born at Königsberg, he was Jewish, but in 1822 he converted to Christianity. In 1845 he was appointed professor of ancient Greek philology at Königsberg University, a post he held until his death.

==Work==
His most important works are:
*&quot;De Aristarchi Studiis Homericis&quot; (1833), which laid a new foundation for Homeric exegesis (on the Aristarchean lines of explaining Homer from the text itself) and textual criticism.
*&quot;Quaestiones Epicae&quot; (1837).
*&quot;De Asclepiade Myrleano&quot; (1845).
*&quot;Herodiani Scripta Tria emendatiora. Accedunt Analecta&quot; (1848).
*&quot;Populäre Aufsätze aus dem Altertum&quot; (1856, Second much enlarged edition, 1875), his best known work.
*&quot;Horatius Flaccus&quot; (1869), in which, on aesthetic grounds, he rejected many of the odes as spurious.
*&quot;Die Pindarscholien&quot; (1873).
Lehrs was a man of decided opinions; his enthusiasm for everything Greek caused him to insist on the undivided authorship of the &quot;Iliad&quot;; comparative mythology and the symbolical interpretation of myths he regarded as a species of sacrilege.

<text>Kuala Lumpur Sentral Station (KL Sentral) is a transit-oriented development that houses the main railway station of Kuala Lumpur, the capital of Malaysia. Opened on 16 April 2001, KL Sentral replaced the old Kuala Lumpur railway station as the city&#x27;s main inter-city railway station. KL Sentral is the largest railway station in Malaysia, and also in Southeast Asia from 2001 to 2021, before Krung Thep Aphiwat Central Terminal in Bangkok, Thailand was completed.

KL Sentral is designed as an intermodal transport hub. All of Kuala Lumpur&#x27;s passenger rail lines serve KL Sentral except the Ampang line, Sri Petaling line, Shah Alam line and Putrajaya line. Many intercity trains serving Peninsular Malaysia start here. All the railway components of the scheme have been completed. It was also designed to be a new business and financial hub for Kuala Lumpur.

==Overview==

KL Sentral refers to the entire of development built on the former Keretapi Tanah Melayu marshalling yard in Brickfields. The development includes the transport hub, hotels, office towers, condominiums and shopping malls and was expected to be completed in 2015.

KL Sentral has been divided into 14 land parcels, each representing a different function. Some of these lots have been fully constructed and are already in use, while others are either in the process of being built, or are still awaiting development, according to the phased programme.

KL Sentral is being developed by a consortium made up of Malaysian Resources Corporation Berhad (MRCB), Keretapi Tanah Melayu Berhad (KTMB) and Pembinaan Redzai Sdn Bhd.

==History==
Kuala Lumpur Sentral station stands on the site of the former Malayan Railway&#x27;s marshalling yard called the Central Railroad Repair Shops. In the Second World War during the Japanese occupation of Malaya, the yard was the target of the Allies&#x27; 1945 bombing of Kuala Lumpur. The yard was targeted twice, on 19 February 1945 and 10 March 1945. The second bombing raid also damaged a nearby museum.

In 1994, with the objective of enhancing Kuala Lumpur city&#x27;s public transport, the Government of Malaysia awarded a contract to a consortium to transform at the old railway marshalling yard into a modern transit hub within a self-contained urban development. The consortium, led by Malaysian Resources Corp Bhd (MRCB), appointed architect Kisho Kurokawa and Associates, who also designed the Kuala Lumpur International Airport (KLIA), to design the master plan for the entire development.

In July 2010, a number two trains crashed into each other. One was an airport bound train and the other was a parked train. The crash injured three people.

In early August 2019, KL Sentral was one of the locations affected by two online bomb threats posted on Twitter; the other being the Russian Embassy in Kuala Lumpur. These threats were posted via a hacked account by an individual calling himself &quot;limzhengyan&quot;; as a result the Malaysian police carried out a search on those locations and determined that the threats were hoaxes, although coincidentally on the same day an incomplete improvised explosive device was found at the Bukit Damansara area.

Starting from 29 May 2023, KL Sentral LRT station officially rebranded as KL Sentral - redONE. The partnership is part of a five-year station naming rights agreement between Prasarana Integrated Development and redONE, the largest mobile virtual network operator (MVNO) in ASEAN.

==Development zones==
The KL Sentral development area is divided into several plots of land, each with a specific development purpose. All constructions were scheduled to be completed by 2015.

==Office zones==
Office zones in KL Sentral account for more than 50% of the total land area. The developer intends that KL Sentral will ultimately be the business and financial hub of Kuala Lumpur.

===Lot A: CIMB Headquarters (Menara CIMB)===
Lot A will be the new headquarters for CIMB Group which is located facing the National Museum. As of June 2011, the new headquarters&#x27; name which appears on the construction site is &quot;Menara CIMB&quot; (CIMB Tower). The company acquired the land in July 2008, and construction is expected to begin in Q4 2007 and complete in 2011. It is unknown how many floors there will be but it should have around of office space available.

===Lot M: Plaza Sentral===
Lot M or Plaza Sentral is a completed office complex in the west of KL Sentral. The complex was completed in two stages.

*Phase I was completed in June 2001, comprising three blocks and total gross floor area of . Offering prestigious office suites, Plaza Sentral was sold and quickly taken up by multinationals and Malaysian companies alike, eager to take advantage of the global connectivity and convenience of working in KL Sentral. Its take-up rate is reaching 100%.
*Phase II was launched in September 2003 due to the escalating demand for premium office space. It has since been fully taken up. Comprising two towers – 18-storey and 26-storey – made up of four blocks and a total gross floor area of , the building was completed in 2006. Tenants include British Telecom and Maxis Communications.

===Lot J: Sooka Sentral &amp; 4 Office Towers===
Lot J is a development lot for four 35-storey office towers of identical architecture.

Lot J was sold to United Engineers (M) Bhd (UEM) in May 2005 with plans for four towers. Tower A was built by UEM for its corporate headquarters called &quot;Mercu UEM&quot; on the prime piece of land with a gross floor area of . Tower B will be an office tower for the Malaysian Industrial Development Authority. Tower C was built by Quill Realty Sdn Bhd and sold to Suruhanjaya Syarikat Malaysia (SSM) for its corporate headquarters. Tower D is an office building built by Quill, named Quill 7. 

A development on Lot J is the six-storey lifestyle centre which houses a fitness and spa centre, business centre, food court, restaurants and alfresco dining facilities. This development, called Sooka Sentral, opened its doors in December 2007.

===Lot N: 1 Sentral Tower===

Lot E will be a hub for entertainment and convention centre. The deck of this development has been completed.

===Lot G: NU Sentral===
Lot G, located in the south of KL Sentral consist of shopping complex, office block, serviced apartments, and a three-star hotel. NU Sentral is the shopping mall in the area, and directly acts as a pathway between Stesen Sentral and the KL Sentral monorail station. Development works commenced in 2008 and was completed in 2014. The land was previously used as a parking lot and a short-cut for pedestrians from Brickfields and the KL Sentral Monorail station to KL Sentral proper.

In January 2008, MRCB set up a joint venture company with Pelaburan Hartanah Bumiputera Bhd (PHBB) named Jewel Surprises Sdn Bhd to develop the area. The new company will hold a lease on the plot of land for 99 years.

==Transport hub==
===Lot H: Stesen Sentral===

Stesen Sentral () is the name of Lot H, which is the designated transport hub within the KL Sentral development project, although both the public and connected transit lines generally refer to the station itself as &quot;KL Sentral&quot;.

Stesen Sentral, designed to house six rail networks, was completed in December 2000 and the rail, retail and food and beverage operations began in April 2001. Standing on , the main building has a gross floor area of and the specifications were based on passenger projections up to the year 2020, which was when Malaysia aspired to be a fully developed nation.

In 2008, Stesen Sentral registered over 100,000 passengers daily, which translates into 36.5 million people a year.

The station has a parking lot for visitors and people working around the KL Sentral area.

====Rail services====
KL Sentral is served by the following services: 
*Express Rail Link (ERL): airport rail link to Kuala Lumpur International Airport (KLIA)
** KLIA Ekspres: non-stop express trains to KLIA T1 and KLIA T2 stations.
** KLIA Transit: commuter-style trains to KLIA that also calls at all stations in between, i.e. Bandar Tasik Selatan, Putrajaya/Cyberjaya (Putrajaya Sentral), and Salak Tinggi.
*KTM Komuter: Commuter trains serving the Klang Valley region

*Rapid KL: Light rapid transit (LRT) service
** Kelana Jaya Line: Putra Heights – Gombak 
(Note: the Kelana Jaya Line station is branded as KL Sentral - redONE due to sponsorship reasons.) 

=====KL City Air Terminal (KL CAT)=====
KL City Air Terminal is located at the eastern and western ends of the station building and was opened on 14 April 2002 together with the KLIA Ekspres. Designed as an &quot;Airport Terminal in the City&quot;, KL CAT is an IATA-indexed station and is assigned with the IATA code XKL. 

As of October 2023, passengers flying Malaysia Airlines and Batik Air can check-in their baggage at KL CAT before boarding a KLIA Ekspres train to Kuala Lumpur International Airport. 

KL CAT is divided into two halls: 

* KL CAT Departure Hall is located at the western end of the station building and houses the check-in counters, ticketing counters, and faregates to access KLIA Ekspres departure platform. 
* KL CAT Arrival Hall is located at the eastern end of the station building and houses the exit faregates from KLIA Ekspres arrival platform. The linkway that connects to Muzium Negara for the MRT Kajang Line is also located at this hall. 

When KL CAT was built, there were plans to offer through checked baggage service from KLIA to KL CAT where checked baggage of passengers arriving at KLIA would be conveyed to KL CAT and collected by passengers at KL CAT. However, these plans have not materialised.

====Connecting rail services====

The following lines have stations located within the vicinity of KL Sentral complex: 

* KL Monorail: KL Sentral Monorail station at Jalan Tun Sambanthan can be accessed via NU Sentral shopping mall located adjacent to KL Sentral complex.
* MRT Kajang Line: Muzium Negara MRT station at Jalan Damansara can be accessed via a underground walkway from the KL Sentral complex. 

===Connecting stations===
====KL Sentral Monorail station====
The KL Sentral monorail station stands on Jalan Tun Sambanthan in Brickfields, behind the NU Sentral shopping mall. The station acts as a terminating stop for the KL Monorail line. It is directly connected to NU Sentral which allows for uninterrupted walking between Stesen Sentral and the monorail station.
The monorail station is also equipped with new ticket vending machines, ticketing gates as well as a new Customer Service Office. Tactile paving for the visually impaired is also provided beginning from NU Sentral. The completion of the overhead bridge now enables customers to travel between KL Sentral and the monorail station safely and conveniently.
The station uses the Spanish solution, having one rail line with a platform on each side, for passengers embarking and disembarking the train separately.

Before NU Sentral was built, passengers who wanted to move from the monorail station to Stesen Sentral and vice versa had to walk through the busy Jalan Tun Sambanthan.

The monorail and LRT stations are not the interchange station or out-of-station interchange stations. The commuter will be charged 2 single-way journey fares instead of integrated fares whenever using these connecting stations.

====Muzium Negara MRT station====
Due to space constraints, an MRT station could not be built in the Stesen Sentral area, therefore an MRT station had to be built in front of the nearby National Museum to allow connections to Stesen Sentral. The Muzium Negara MRT station opened on 17 July 2017, along with the underground footbridge that connects the MRT station to the main KL Sentral building.

===KL Sentral bus hub===

KL Sentral has also been made a city bus hub by Rapid KL as part of its bus network revamp. It is the bus hub for city shuttle and trunk bus routes. 

Buses to Singapore and the Kuala Lumpur International Airport also operate from KL Sentral, while most other bus operators go near KL Sentral along Jalan Tun Sambanthan. Also, a hop-on/hop-off tourist bus stop is located between Hilton and the station. Traveling by bus to Genting Highlands is also available here.

<doc id="360262" wikidata="Q12797547" url="?curid=360262" title="No. 4 Commando">
<text>No. 4 Commando was a battalion-sized Commando unit of the British Army during the Second World War formed in 1940. Although it was intended to conduct small-scale raids and harass enemy garrisons along the coast of German-occupied France, the unit was mainly employed as a highly trained infantry assault unit.

The unit&#x27;s first operation was the successful raid on the Lofoten Islands on 4 March 1941. However, their next two planned operations were both cancelled and it was not until 22 April 1942 that No. 4 Commando took part in another raid on the French coastal town of Hardelot. On 22 August 1942, No. 4 Commando was one of three Commando units selected for the Dieppe raid. Under the command of Lord Lovat, the unit landed on the right flank of the main landings and successfully silenced a German gun battery. This was the only complete success of the operation, which was eventually aborted, after less than 10 hours, following heavy Allied losses.

As part of the 1st Special Service Brigade, No. 4 Commando took part in the Normandy landings in June 1944. Landing on Sword Beach 30 minutes before the rest of the brigade, their first objectives were to capture a German strong point and gun battery in Ouistreham. After the unit neutralised these positions they rejoined the brigade, reinforcing the 6th Airborne Division at the Orne bridges. Before the invasion, the brigade had been informed that they would stay in France for only a few days. No. 4 Commando remained there for a further 82 days, protecting the beachhead&#x27;s left flank. During that period, the unit endured over 50% casualties. Finally withdrawn to Britain in September 1944, they were reassigned to the 4th Special Service Brigade for the assault on Walcheren island. At the end of the war No. 4 Commando became part of the British Army of the Rhine, but together with all of the British Army&#x27;s Commando units was disbanded in 1946.

==Background==

The British Commandos were organised for special service in June 1940. After the Dunkirk evacuation, the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, Winston Churchill, called for a force to be assembled and equipped to inflict casualties on the Germans and bolster British morale. Churchill told the joint Chiefs of Staff to propose measures for an offensive against German-occupied Europe, and stated, &quot;they must be prepared with specially trained troops of the hunter class who can develop a reign of terror down the enemy coast.&quot; One staff officer, Lieutenant Colonel Dudley Clarke, had already submitted such a proposal to General Sir John Dill, the Chief of the Imperial General Staff (CIGS). Dill, aware of Churchill&#x27;s intentions, approved Clarke&#x27;s proposal and on 23 June 1940, the first commando raid took place.

The request for volunteers for special service was initially restricted to serving Army soldiers within certain formations still in Britain, and from men of the disbanding divisional Independent Companies originally raised from Territorial Army (TA) divisions who had served in the Norwegian Campaign.

By November 1940, more than 2,000 men had volunteered and were organised into four battalions in a Special Service Brigade, under the command of Brigadier J. C. Haydon. The Brigade quickly expanded to 12 battalions, which were renamed commandos. Each commando had a lieutenant colonel as the commanding officer (CO) and numbered around 450 men (divided into 75 man troops that were further divided into 15 man sections). Technically these men were only on secondment to the commandos; they retained their regimental cap badges and remained on the regimental roll for pay. The new force of commandos came under the operational control of the Combined Operations Headquarters.

==Formation==
No. 4 Commando was formed in Weymouth on 21 July 1940, when the first intake of 500 volunteers arrived. The unique nature of the commandos immediately became apparent when every man was held responsible for finding his own quarters. As commandos were expected to be fighting troops, they had no administrative personnel, such as clerks and cooks for example. To assist them with living &#x27;off camp&#x27;, with no cook house all ranks were given a daily allowance and a ration card, the allowance being 67 pence for officers and of 34 pence for other ranks. This arrangement meant that commandos lived on civilian rations, while the rest of the armed forces had the more plentiful military scale of rations.

Lieutenant Colonel C.P.D Legard, 5RIDG and the Regimental Sergeant Major W. Morris held their first parade on 22 July 1940, at Weymouth Pavilion. The volunteers were informed of the intended role for the commandos and that training would be &quot;tough and demanding and any who could not measure up to the standard required would be returned to their parent unit without any leave of appeal&quot;.

Training started immediately and concentrated on physical fitness, weapons training, movement across country including cliff climbing, obstacle crossing and raiding operations. Weapons training was limited by the lack of anything other than the personal weapons (rifles and pistols) that each man had brought with him. Machine guns or anything heavier were not available at the time. In August 1940, some officers and non-commissioned officers (NCO) were sent to Achnacarry in the Scottish Highlands on a commando course. These men were then responsible for teaching the rest of the unit.

No. 4 Commando remained at Weymouth until 13 October 1940, when it boarded trains for Scotland. Arriving on the River Clyde at 06:00 the next day, they were sent on board HMS &quot;Glengyle&quot;, an Infantry landing ship. &quot;Glengyle&quot; sailed on 18 October for Inveraray, to conduct training for the first time with Assault Landing Craft. The move to Scotland became permanent and No. 4 Commando were based at Ayr.

While all this was going on, a decision was made to concentrate the commandos and Independent Companies into five large 1,000 man battalions, each of two companies. No. 4 Commando was renamed the No. 1 Company of the 3rd Special Service Battalion, under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Dudley Lister. No. 2 Company was formed by the re-designation of No. 7 Commando. This new formation proved to be too large and unwieldy in practice. Within three months, the Special Service Battalions were disbanded and the original commando units reformed but on a smaller scale with six troops instead of the original ten. Each troop would comprise three officers and 62 other ranks; this number was set so each troop would fit into two Assault Landing Craft. The new formation also meant that two complete Commando units could be carried in the &#x27;Glen&#x27; type landing ship and one unit in the &#x27;Dutch&#x27; type landing ship.

==Operational history==

===Lofoten Islands===
On 20 February 1941, No. 4 Commando were informed they would be going to Troon in Scotland for an exercise. The next day the unit boarded HMS &quot;Queen Emma&quot;, but on 22 February 1941, after they anchored at Scapa Flow, their real objective was divulged. Together with No. 3 Commando they were to conduct Operation Claymore, a raid on the Lofoten Islands. Claymore&#x27;s main objective was to stop the manufacture of fish oil and its exportation to Germany, where it was used in making explosives.

Extra training commenced on board ship, including how the men were to get to their boat stations to disembark. Each troop also rehearsed its own part in the mission. Lectures were given in escape and evasion and troop commanders and NCO&#x27;s were given small silk maps of Norway to help with any escape attempt. Another item of escape equipment issued was a pair of trouser fly buttons that, when placed one on top of the other, became a small compass.

Claymore took place on 4 March 1941. The Germans were caught unprepared and the landings were unopposed. Within an hour No. 4 Commando had taken all its objectives. The raid was a success: 11 fish oil factories and storage tanks were destroyed, 10 ships sunk, 225 prisoners taken with an unknown number of German sailors killed on the sunken ships. An added bonus were the 315 Norwegian volunteers brought back to join the Free Norwegian Forces.

===Operation Puma===
After returning from Norway, training started for Operation Puma, the occupation of the Canary Islands. The operation was planned following intelligence that Spain was going to join the war on the side of the Axis forces. The intention was to prevent Germany using the islands as a U-boat base. The force assembled included five commando units, an army brigade, two Royal Marine brigades and supporting arms. Training for Operation Puma culminated in landing exercises in the Hebrides from the Landing Ship, Infantry HMS &quot;Royal Scotsman&quot;. The operation was renamed Operation Pilgrim and after a number of delays was put on hold by the Chiefs-of-Staff. On 13 September a token force including a troop from No. 4 Commando was dispatched to West Africa. The troop was based in Sierra Leone and Nigeria until returning to Britain in February 1942, after the cancellation of the operation. While this was happening a new second in command (2IC) was appointed, Major Charles Vaughan, and a Captain Lord Lovat joined the unit as the training officer. Lovat had been attached to the Lofoten raid as an observer and had applied for a posting to the commandos.

===Operation Bludgeon===
In February 1942, A, B and C Troops were dispatched to the Outer Hebrides under the command of Captain Lord Lovat for extra training. Returning to Troon in March, they were immediately sent to Dartmouth, Devon where they embarked on HMS &quot;Prins Albert&quot;. Once on board they were informed about Operation Bludgeon and started mission training. The objective of this raid was a large building that was a short distance inland from the Dutch coast, and that was used by senior German officers. For the duration of the operation B Troop were issued with flamethrowers to set the building on fire. After several days training, the commandos moved around the coast and anchored in the Thames waiting for the order to go. The operation was eventually cancelled, due to the increased German E-Boat activity in the area of the landing.

===St Nazaire===

The St Nazaire raid had the objective of destroying the Normandie dry dock, which would prevent its use by any large German warship if that had been damaged or in need of repair. The majority of land force for the raid was supplied by No. 2 Commando, led by Lieutenant Colonel Newman. However the Special Service Brigade headquarters, used the raid to provide experience for their other units and 92 men were drawn from, No&#x27;s 1, 3, 4, 5, 9 and 12 Commandos to go on the raid. The No. 4 Commando contingent was 12 other ranks commanded by Lieutenant H Pennington. They had all previously served in the Royal Engineers and left under the impression they were going on a Harbour Demolition Course. After their training at Cardiff and Southampton Docks only six of the 12 were selected to go on the raid. Three of the six including Lieutenant Pennington were killed before they were able to land, when their Motor Launch was engaged by the German coastal defence batteries. The other men who had not been selected for the raid were returned to No. 4 Commando.

===Operation Abercrombie===
Operation Abercrombie was a raid on the French coastal town of Hardelot. Only B and C Troops supported by detachments from the Royal Engineers and the Carleton and York Regiment of Canada participated. The raid was under the overall command of Lord Lovat, with the objective of capturing prisoners and causing as much damage as possible. For this raid they were going to try a different system to cross the channel. Instead of using Infantry Landing Ships to cross the Channel they would be taken across on Motor Gun Boats towing Assault Landing Craft (LCA). The combined force left Dover on 19 April 1942. En route, one LCA sank with the loss of two commandos who were manning a Bren gun in the bow. The raid was called off and they returned to Dover. A replacement LCA was obtained and they returned to France on 21 April. This time the crossing was uneventful and the commandos made a successful landing. However, the two commando troops were discovered cutting the barbed wire beach obstacles and German machine guns opened fire. The raiders did carry out a reconnaissance of the area but were unable to capture any prisoners. The commandos returned without loss, but one man was wounded in the leg. The smaller Canadian detachment was unable to locate the target beach and returned to Britain. After the raid there was another change in command. Lieutenant Colonel Lister left to form No. 10 (Inter-Allied) Commando and Major Vaughan became the temporary commanding officer. Vaughan left shortly afterwards to take over command of the Commando Depot at Achnacarry and was succeeded by Lord Lovat with Major Derek Mills-Roberts becoming the 2IC.

===Dieppe Raid===
Originally conceived in April 1942, &quot;Operation Rutter&quot; was to conduct a major division-sized raid on a German held port of Dieppe on the French channel coast and to hold it for the duration of at least two tides. They would effect the greatest amount of destruction of enemy facilities and defences before withdrawing. The original plan was approved by the Chiefs of Staff in May 1942. This plan included two parachute landings behind the artillery batteries on either side of the main landing beaches. The parachute operation was later cancelled and instead No. 3, No. 4 and the newly formed &#x27;A&#x27; (Royal Marine) Commando were to land by sea and attack the artillery batteries and the harbour.
The Dieppe Raid was a major operation planned by Admiral Lord Mountbatten and Combined Operations Headquarters. The attacking force consisted of around 6,000 troops. The Royal Navy supplied 237 ships and landing craft, and the Royal Air Force 74 squadrons of aircraft, of which 66 were fighter squadrons.

Landing on the eastern flank No. 3 Commando would assault the &quot;Goebbels&quot; artillery battery, while No. 4 Commando would be responsible for the &quot;Hess&quot; battery on the western flank. The &quot;Hess&quot; battery consisted of six guns in a concrete emplacement inland from the coastal cliffs. The emplacement was surrounded by two rows of barbed wire, and protected by several machine gun posts. A nearby anti-aircraft tower could also defend against a ground attack on the guns. The commandos were responsible for their own planning and selected two landing beaches codenamed Orange one and two. Orange One at Varengeville was overlooked by a chalk cliff but had two gullies leading to the top of the cliff. Before the war there were steps down to the beach. But these had been removed and the gullies filled with barbed wire and other obstacles. The second beach Orange Two was at Quiberville further west at the mouth of the River Saane. This offered access to the top of the cliffs but was covered by two machine gun pillboxes and barbed wire and it was further away from their target. Intelligence had estimated that the strength of the battery was between 120–175 men, supported by two infantry companies stationed nearby.

The plan was for four troops (A, B, C and F), headquarters and attached specialists, to be divided into two groups. Group one under the command of Major Mills-Roberts would land at Orange One and consisted of C Troop, a section from A Troop, the mortar detachment and some of the specialists. They would scale the cliffs and form a fire base in the woods in front of the battery to support the assault. Group two commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Lovat would land at Orange Two and take out the beach defences. B and F Troops would then advance move along the river and assault the battery from the rear. The rest of A Troop would be the reserve, positioned between the two beaches. After the attack Group two would withdraw through Group one and be picked up by the waiting LCAs on Orange One beach.

No. 4 Commando made the crossing to Dieppe on board HMS &quot;Prins Albert&quot;. The crossing was uneventful and at 04:50 just before daybreak Group one landed unopposed. Using two Bangalore torpedoes to blow a hole in the barbed wire, they managed to scale the cliffs. As they approached the battery at 05:45 it opened fire on the main landing force coming ashore at Dieppe. This was 30 minutes before Group one was expected to be in a position but Mills-Roberts responded by speeding up the advance to get their guns into action sooner. Once in position they opened fire on the battery with their mortars, Bren machine guns and sniper rifles. One of the mortar bombs landed inside the battery and exploded the stored charges, putting the guns out of action.

Group two had an opposed landing being greeted by machine gun fire from the two pillboxes guarding the beach. Leaving a section from A Troop to deal with them the rest of the Group ran the to the rear of the battery, bypassing German infantry positions on the way. The A Troop section having finished off the pillboxes, set out for Orange one beach, ambushing a German patrol en route. While this was happening Lovat and the other two troops, were preparing to assault the battery from different directions. The men from B Troop approached from behind the anti-aircraft tower, as they could still see some Germans moving about on it, they detached three men to deal with them. At the same time they stumbled across and captured a machine gun post. At 06:15 the assault started, F Troop discovered a group of Germans forming up to put in their own assault on the fire base. Charging into them they were dispersed without loss to the commandos. The troop continued their advance, moving between some buildings and an orchard, when they were themselves caught in the open by heavy gun fire. Two men in the lead the troop commander Captain Pettiward and Lieutenant McDonald were killed while Troop Sergeant Major Stockdale was wounded. It was during this action that the already wounded Captain Porteous, acting as the liaison officer between the two groups was awarded the Victoria Cross.

The two Groups were in position, when a pre arranged strafing attack by the Royal Air Force commenced, this signalled an increasing in the rate of fire from Group one. At 06:30 a very flare fired by Lovat signalled the start of the assault. Group one ceased firing and B and F Troops charged the battery with bayonets fixed. The objective for B Troop was the battery buildings, while F Troop targeted the guns. Captain Porteous now commanding F Troop was wounded again, this time in the thigh but urged his men on. He was shot for the third time and passed out just as the guns were captured. Demolition experts from F Troop destroyed the guns with pre-formed charges while B Troop searched the battery buildings for intelligence materials. Carrying their wounded with them and escorting prisoners both troops withdrew through the fire base. Still in contact with the Germans both groups of commandos made it to Orange One beach and at 08:15 were taken off by the LCAs. They crossed the channel without incident arriving at Newhaven docks at 17:45 the same day.

For their part in the raid Lovat was awarded the Distinguished Service Order and Mills-Roberts the Military Cross. The cost to the Commando was at first thought to be 23 dead but six were only severely wounded and were eventually reported to be prisoners of war. No. 4 Commandos&#x27; assault on the battery was the only successful part of the whole operation. The War Office claimed it as &quot;a classic example of the use of well trained infantry...and a thoroughness in planning, training and execution&quot;, and in February 1943 issued an infantry training pamphlet &quot;in order that all may benefit from the story of a stimulating achievement&quot;.

===Between Dieppe and Normandy===
After Dieppe the headquarters staff changed again. Lovat was promoted to brigadier and given command of the 1st Special Service Brigade. Mills-Roberts was promoted and sent to North Africa to take over command of No. 6 Commando. They were replaced by Robert Dawson as the CO and Ronald Menday as 2IC. Other changes included moving to a new base in Falmouth and the formation of a heavy weapons troop in each commando. The new troop with mortar and Vickers machine gun sections provided the heavy weapons needed for their new role as assault infantry. By now the Commandos had started to move away from smaller raiding operations. They were formed into units intended to spearhead future Allied landing operations. To assist in this they were given the organic fire support weapons, that had been absent when they were a raiding force.

In June 1943, 10 months after the Dieppe raid, No. 4 Commando started a new round of training. The program included mountain warfare training at the Commando Snow and Mountain Warfare Training Centre in Scotland. The emphasis here was on fighting and living in the mountains and instruction in how to train a partisan force. Afterwards they moved to another new base in Sussex. Instead of occupying one town, the troops spread out. A and B Troops were billeted at Seaford, C and D Troops at Newhaven and E and F Troops at Lewes. Training was now almost non stop and a number of large scale landing exercises, using the new Landing Craft Infantry took place. In February 1944, while the rest of No. 4 continued to practice day and night assault landings and live firing exercises. C Troop was sent to qualify as parachutists at the parachute training centre RAF Ringway. The ranks of No. 4 Commando swelled in April 1944 with the arrival of two French troops from No. 10 (Inter-Allied) Commando. Other new arrivals were the Lee–Enfield No. 4 rifle, which replaced the old SMLE rifles and the Vickers K machine gun, issued two per troop to provide fire support. To learn the characteristics of these new weapons, the commandos spent days on the rifle ranges learning how to handle them.

===Normandy===

Brigadier Lord Lovat, in command of the 1st Special Service Brigade, issued orders for the brigade&#x27;s forthcoming role in the landings.

&quot;The Intention&quot;. The 6th Airborne Division and 1st Special Service Brigade would be responsible for holding the left flank of the Allied bridgehead of the invasion of Normandy.

&quot;The method&quot;. The Commando Brigade, consisting of No.s 3, 4 and 6 Army Commandos and No. 45 (Royal Marine) Commando, to land on the extreme flank of the Allied Forces on Queen beach (Sword) and cut inland to join forces with two brigades dropped inland by glider and parachute. No. 4 Commando to destroy a battery and the garrison in Ouistreham and then rejoin the Brigade. The rest of the Brigade, landing 30 minutes after No.4, to fight through enemy defences to reach and reinforce Brigades of the 6th Airborne Division, meeting astride the bridges spanning the River Orne and the Caen Canal. Glider Regiments of the Airlanding Brigade would arrive later the same evening descending in country cleared of the enemy.
On 25 May 1944, No. 4 Commando arrived in Southampton. They occupied a large marshalling area with tight security. Orders detailed their role in the invasion. &quot;The two French troops would attack and destroy a strong point that dominated the beaches known as the Casino, followed by the five British fighting troops, supported by the heavy weapons troop, who were to push on further into the town to destroy a coastal battery.&quot; The German defenders in the area came from the 1st Battalion, 736th Infantry Regiment part of the 716th Infantry Division. They were responsible for the Casino strong point with its and guns, the coastal battery with its six guns and ten machine guns posts, stretching from the Orne canal along the seafront to &quot;Queen&quot; beach at La Breche, where the commando would be landing.

The six British troops on board the Infantry Landing Ships, HMS &quot;Princess Astrid&quot; and HMS &quot;Maid of Orleans&quot; and the two French troops on LCIs 523 and 527 left the Solent on 5 June 1944. When out at sea they were informed that the invasion was going to be in Normandy and more specifically Ouistreham.
For the landing each man carried a rucksack weighing containing extra ammunition, for the Brens, mortars, Vickers K guns and PIATs. This was on top of their own personal weapon and ammunition. Unusually each man chose whether to would wear a steel helmet or the Commando green beret. No. 4 Commando were in the second wave and landed behind the initial assault battalion, from the East Yorkshire Regiment, part of the 3rd Infantry Division. Captain Porteous described how their dead and wounded were &quot;just swilling around in the water.&quot; Captain McDougal later wrote, &quot;as we were coming ashore the assault troops were committing suicide by trying to dig in on the beach. In passing I kicked the nearest man telling him to keep going. The man was dead. So was the man next to him and a third was seriously wounded by machine gun fire.&quot; The Commandos followed their drills and cleared the beach as quickly as possible. Once clear they headed for their assembly area, which was also the commando medical post. Leaving their rucksacks behind, they set off along the Lion sur Mer road towards their objectives.

Lieutenant Colonel Dawson had decided that the two French troops should take the lead into Ouistreham, followed by the six British troops. The French were unopposed apart from some mortar rounds and machine gun fire as they neared their objective. No. 1 French Troop occupied houses at the front and sides of the Casino strong point. An assault to capture the Casino was driven back. While this was going on the other French troop, No. 8, approached the Casino from the rear. Taking up firing positions they too started to engage the strong point but their fire had almost no effect. The French commander Capitaine de frégate Philippe Kieffer was just about to order an all-out assault by both troops, when reports that British amphibious tanks were in Ouistreham reached him. Sending a guide to bring one forward, the tank arrived in front of the Casino and proceeded to destroy the German gun emplacements. Within 30 minutes of the tanks&#x27; arrival, all the strong point guns were silenced and No. 1 Troop had assaulted and captured the objective. With its capture the French Commandos were now in control of the western suburbs of Ouistreham.

The rest of No. 4 Commando was moving along the Lion sur Mer road towards their objective the gun battery. The battery was located at the extreme left of the landing beaches. The Orne canal formed its northern boundary and the Casino strong point was to the south. It was surrounded by barbed wire and had three machine gun posts. Two of the posts faced where the canal joined the sea and the third faced up the canal towards the port. To the west of the battery were the houses of the town and the port area of Ouistreham. The order of march was: C Troop to deal with any opposition en route, D Troop who were to force an entrance into the battery, A Troop to provide covering fire for the assaulting troops. In the assault E Troop would take the left hand guns, and F Troop the right. Bringing up the rear was the headquarters and the heavy weapons troop. The heavy weapons troop set up a fire base to support both the French and British attacks if needed. Progress along the road was rapid with only intermittent artillery fire slowing them down. As they advanced, a tank from the 13th/18th Royal Hussars joined them, just in time to engage German snipers who had started shooting at E and F Troops.
As C Troop reached the forming up point for the assault it met heavy machine gun fire from the gun battery. A Troop bypassed them to occupy houses to cover the assault. The next to arrive was D Troop, which had a special ladder to cross the anti-tank ditch around the battery. Realising that the man carrying the ladder had been killed crossing the beach and the ladder left behind, they looked for another way to cross. They discovered wooden planks bridging the gap that the defenders used to access the town. D Troop crossed and captured the machine gun posts around the battery. With the machine guns taken, E and F Troops began their assault. The attack was successful but they discovered the guns were only wooden dummies made from telegraph poles. The real guns had been removed three days previously and positioned further inland.

Having captured its objectives, No. 4 Commando reformed and set out to join the rest of the brigade, about away. Lieutenant Colonel Dawson was wounded during the fighting and Major Menday temporarily took command. The march inland to the Orne bridges was uneventful and upon arrival No. 4 Commando dug in on a ridge of high ground to the east of the River Orne towards Sallenelles. Their new position was towards Sallenelles beside the Hauger château. Not long after they arrived and started digging in, the gliders of the 6th Airlanding Brigade began landing to their rear.

===Orne bridgehead===

Expecting a Germans counterattack, protective trenches were completed by nightfall. The first night 6/7 June was uneventful and &quot;stand to&quot; was 04:30, but there were still no signs of a German attack. During the day there was some sniping in the morning and in the afternoon E and F Troop were subjected to a mortar barrage. By now the trenches were complete with overhead protection and arranged to give an all-round defence. In the French troops&#x27; area some activity was observed and Menday, still in command, suspected an attack from the direction of Sallenelles. Nothing come of that but in the evening of 7 June, some dive bombers strafed the brigade position.
By the end of the second day there was still no signs of the expected German ground attack. That night was also uneventful but just after stand to on 8 June, German infantry were observed advancing through the woods to their front. Holding fire until the last minute, the Germans were beaten back but A Troop found themselves surrounded on three sides and forced to withdraw. That night the Germans attacked again, this time targeting C Troop, but were again driven back. Shortly thereafter a group from No. 45 (Royal Marine) Commando arrived and reported that the Germans had broken through and were on the road behind No. 4 Commando. Captain Porteous and D Troop moved down the road to deal with them. Outnumbered two to one D Troop charged, killing some and forcing the rest to withdraw.

The next morning 10 June, from 09:30 to 10;00 the No. 4 Commandos position was subjected to heavy artillery and mortar bombardment. For the two hours before this, No. 6 Commando was heavily bombed, which was followed up by a ground assault that lasted until midday. Suspecting an attack on their own position No. 4 Commando stood to. The attack did not materialise until 17:00, when massed German infantry were observed forming up in front of F Troop. At the same time an artillery Forward Observation Officer arrived from brigade, he contacted the 25 pounder guns attached to the 6th Airborne Division and requested 12 rounds of rapid fire. The rounds landed on target and another 12 were called for, breaking the German attack. The British artillery was not alone—since digging in, the Commandos had been on the receiving end of artillery and mortars which was steadily taking its toll in casualties. E Troop for example were now under the command of a section sergeant and had only 20 men left from a complement of 65.

Elsewhere the Germans were attacking A, C and the French troops. C Troop had ambushed the Germans, moving forward to attack and then fought off a second attack. The attack on the French position was supported by a tank, which they only managed to knock out with a PIAT after it had got behind them. In both these attacks the commandos were involved in hand-to-hand combat to keep the Germans from overrunning their positions. From 11 June the German pressure on the commando line lessened. They were still subject to artillery and mortar fire but there were no more infantry attempts to dislodge them. In the days since landing No. 4 Commando had taken 50 per cent casualties. Before the landings 1st Special Service brigade had been informed they would be withdrawn in a few days, after the Allies had broken out from the beachhead. Problems capturing Caen meant the commandos and airborne division had to remain to secure the left flank along the line of the Orne. They did not get relieved for 82 days, during which they not only held the left flank but on 18 August started their own break out. With No. 4 Commando leading the first village liberated was Bavent followed by Beaumont en Auge. Breuzville was entered over the night of 25/26 August and Boulleville the following day. Here they remained until 6 September when the brigade was withdrawn and sent back to Britain, for 14 days leave.

===Walcheren===
On their return from leave, No, 4 Commando had been made back up to full strength with casualty replacements. The commando were informed they would be joining the 4th Special Service Brigade to replace No. 46 (Royal Marine) Commando. Arriving in Belgium they discovered that the brigade was already well into training for Operation Infatuate. This was an assault landing on the island of Walcheren to open the sea route into Antwerp. The city had already been liberated but the northern bank of the Scheldt was still in German hands, enabling them to sink shipping trying to use the port. The First Canadian Army would attack across the causeway from the east. In support of them 4th Special Service Brigade would carry out an assault from the sea. The majority of the brigade would land at Westkapelle, No. 4 Commandos objective was further south at Flushing, with the 155th (South Scottish) Brigade landing behind them.

In preparation for the landing orders were issued to ensure everyone was fit and to concentrate on weapons firing and street fighting. The two French troops were still under command and just for this operation No. 4 Commando took command of a section from the Dutch Troop, No. 10 (Inter-Allied) Commando, and groups from the Special Boat Section (SBS), Royal Engineers and the Royal Artillery to call for artillery fire support. For some reason the old method of calling troops by letters of the alphabet was dropped and the troops were now numbered. The No.1 to No.4 Troops were British and No.s 5 and 6 French. The heavy weapons troop was No. 4 Troop. The final plan for the assault was for the SBS and a section from No. 1 Troop, to go first and reconnoitre a suitable landing point. Following them, the rest of No.1, No. 2 Troop and commando headquarters would secure the beachhead. They would then be joined by the remaining troops, passing through the beachhead and into the town. No.1 Troop would secure the left flank and No. 2 Troop the right.

The operation to liberate the island started at 04:45 1 November 1944, when No. 4 Commando left Breskens by LCAs for their objective the town of Flushing. On their way in and 60 minutes before they were expected to land a heavy artillery bombardment started. By 05:45 the SBS group landed beside the Oranje Molen windmill. They cleared the mines, other obstacles and dealt with the German guards without firing a shot. Then they marked the landing spot for the rest of the commando, No. 1 and No.2 Troops were the next to land. They extended the beachhead and captured machine gun posts and heavy gun emplacements. Another weapon captured was a anti-aircraft gun which supported the other troops when they moved into the town. The final wave landed at 06:30, but had to contend with heavy and accurate fire. One LCA carrying the heavy weapons troop was sunk containing most of their weapons and equipment. Once on the island No. 3 and No.5 Troop moved into the town held by the large numbers of Germans defending the area. No. 6 Troop captured the post office and 50 prisoners. In the afternoon No. 1 Troop was released to support No. 3 and together they advanced again before nightfall. No. 4 Commando had by then secured most of the old town and their flanks were secure.

The advance continued the next day. No. 5 Troop, unable to use the streets, advanced by mouse-holing - blowing holes in house walls with ready-made charges every man carried. No. 6 Troop had dug in and controlled the area between the old and new towns, which allowed the 155th (South Scottish) Brigade which was following up to bypass them. By that afternoon No. 4 Commando controlled the town.
On 3 November the commandos gave control of Flushing to the 52nd (Lowland) Infantry Division and prepared to move by sea to support the rest of the brigade at Westkapelle. Before they could disembark, weather conditions deteriorated and they were forced to march around the coast to reach brigade headquarters at Zoutelande. Lack of supplies curtailed their involvement in the battle for the next two days. Supplies eventually caught up with them and on 6 November they prepared to continue. By now intelligence from Dutch residents and prisoners had revealed that the remaining Germans were holed up in the wooded area between Domburg and Vrouwenpolder.

At 04:45, 7 November No. 4 Commando were ready to start their assault, with No. 3 Troop on the left, the two French troops in the middle and No. 2 Troop on the right. The commandos moved forward, winning a number of small skirmishes, when at 08:15 three German officers appeared and offered the surrender of all the remaining German forces in the area. Lieutenant Colonel Dawson met with the German commander and a formal surrender was agreed and 900 prisoners were taken. Other Germans surrendered to some of the Royal Marine commandos at the same time. In the whole operation No. 4 Commando had suffered 13 dead, 21 wounded versus about 200 German dead and the capture of 1,200 prisoners and large amounts of weapons and equipment.
The total casualties for 4th Special Service Brigade were 103 dead, 68 missing and 325 wounded.

===Disbandment===
No. 4 Commando remained at Walcheren until 14 November 1944, then moved to De Haan, Belgium, to rest and re-equip. They then moved to Blankenberge in Belgium where reinforcements arrived to bring them back up to full strength. They returned to Walcheren to defend the northern coastal areas. Of particular concern was the island of Schouwen-Duiveland, with an estimated garrison of 5,000 men and artillery. The objective was &quot;to prevent enemy infiltration and sabotage&quot;. Lieutenant Colonel Dawson allocated stretches of the coast to each troop and taking the offensive to the enemy, started a programme of raids on Schouwen-Duiveland. At this stage of the war these raids were generally successful. Most patrols brought back prisoners and inflicted casualties on the German defenders. One raid was supposed to meet a party from the Dutch resistance that landed without being discovered, but was then disturbed by a German patrol who first fled rather than putting up any resistance. The commandos later learned that this Dutch resistance group had been captured by the German patrol and all its members were hanged the next morning.

In March 1945, No. 4 Commando was relieved by No. 47 (Royal Marine) Commando and moved to Middelburg and stayed at Bergen-Op-Zoom by April. While responsible for the security of the immediate area, they conducted small raids from the sea against South Holland. Germany surrendered on 8 May 1945. On the No. 4 Commando front the two French troops crossed the channel to Schouwen and Lieutenant Colonel Dawson accepted the unconditional surrender of all German forces in the region. Within days of the surrender No. 4 Commando moved to Recklinghausen in Germany as part of the occupation forces. In Recklinghausen part of their duties were to provide the guard force for a civilian internment camp. The camp housed several thousand German civilians who were not prisoners of war. Inmates included those with no identification and those known to have served in concentration camps. The two French troops returned to French control and were demobilised. Other men were posted to No.s 3 and 6 Commandos in Britain, who were preparing for a move to the Far East to continue the fight in the Burma campaign. By June 1945 the strength of No. 4 Commando had been reduced to 188 all ranks. During a visit in October 1945, Lieutenant General Robert Sturges informed them that the War Office had decided to disband all army commandos. Those not due to be demobilised would be returned to their parent regiment or corps. No. 4 Commando was formally disbanded in January 1946.

<text>David Nicholas O&#x27;Doherty (; born 18 December 1975) is an Irish comedian, author, musician, actor and playwright and son of renowned jazz pianist Jim Doherty. His stand-up has won many international awards, including the if.comedy award in 2008 and Best International Comedian at the 2014 Sydney Comedy Festival.

He attended Trinity College Dublin, where his comedy career began. &quot;I spent a lot of my time introducing things&quot;, he says, &quot;concerts and bands, that sort of thing&quot;. &quot;I remember my brother once bet me I couldn&#x27;t get the word &#x27;spaghetti&#x27; into an introduction for a piano recital in the Edmund Burke so I stood-up and said &#x27;my brother has bet me I can&#x27;t say the word spaghetti&#x27; and I got a laugh.&quot;

O&#x27;Doherty has written several books, written two plays and released three comedy CDs. His latest book for children, &quot;Danger Is Everywhere&quot;, illustrated by Chris Judge has been selected for the UNESCO Dublin, City of Literature Citywide Reading Campaign. In 2015 it was published in 10 languages around the world.

He regards himself as &quot;a failed jazz musician, scrambling about for something else to do with his life&quot;.

He has also written a series for RTÉ Radio about bee detectives with his brother Mark, entitled &quot;The Bees of Manulla&quot;.

<doc id="360267" wikidata="Q334073" url="?curid=360267" title="George Brown, Baron George-Brown">
<text>George Alfred George-Brown, Baron George-Brown, (; 2 September 1914 – 2 June 1985), was a British Labour Party politician who was Deputy Leader of the Labour Party from 1960 to 1970 and held several Cabinet roles under Prime Minister Harold Wilson, including Foreign Secretary and First Secretary of State.

After leaving school at the age of 15, Brown began work as a clerk, before joining the Transport and General Workers&#x27; Union. He rose quickly through the union ranks as an organiser, and shortly before the 1945 election he was chosen as the Labour Party candidate for the seat of Belper. He defeated the Conservative incumbent and went on to hold the seat until his own defeat at the 1970 election. He briefly served in the Attlee government as Minister of Works in 1951. After Labour lost office he was appointed to the Shadow Cabinet, and came to be regarded as a leader of the trade-union-supporting faction on the right of the Labour Party. Following the sudden death of Aneurin Bevan in 1960, Brown was successful in the election to replace him as Deputy Leader of the Labour Party.

Three years later, following the sudden death of Hugh Gaitskell, Brown became Acting Leader of the Labour Party, and consequently was briefly Leader of the Opposition. He stood in the election to gain the role permanently, but was beaten by Harold Wilson; one factor in his defeat was concern from colleagues about the impact of his well-known alcoholism, an affliction that remained with him through his life. Following Labour&#x27;s victory at the 1964 election, Wilson appointed Brown as First Secretary of State, making him the next-most senior member of the Cabinet, and appointed him to the new position of Secretary of State for Economic Affairs, in an ultimately unsuccessful attempt to curtail the power of HM Treasury.

Two months after Labour&#x27;s landslide victory at the snap 1966 election, Wilson moved Brown to the role of Foreign Secretary, a job he had always coveted. Despite this, Brown continued to struggle with his alcoholism, and after several arguments with Wilson in 1968, the two agreed that Brown would resign. Brown lost his seat of Belper in 1970, and shortly thereafter was elevated to the House of Lords; he insisted, having always been known simply as &quot;George Brown&quot;, that upon taking his peerage in November 1970 he would combine his first name and surname to create his title, Baron George-Brown, of Jevington in the County of Sussex.

== Early life ==
Brown was the eldest of four children born to George Brown and Rosina Harriett (née Mason), at Flat 22, I Block, Peabody Buildings, Duke Street, Lambeth, in the flat of his maternal grandmother, Ann Martha Mason, widow of a Scottish asphalter; the flat was in a working-class housing estate built by the Peabody Trust, a housing charity. Soon after the birth, his family left and moved to the Peabody Trust block at Peabody Square, Blackfriars Road, Southwark, near Waterloo station. His father, of a family long settled in The Borough, but who believed themselves to have Irish origins, had worked in his earlier years as a grocer&#x27;s packer, then as a lorry and van driver (for Lyons, later for the &quot;Evening Standard&quot;), and served in the First World War as a chauffeur to senior British Army officers; he later became a fur salesman. A staunch trade unionist, he eventually served as a member of the executive council of the Transport and General Workers&#x27; Union, and was later employed as a full-time official. Aspersions were thus cast on his son&#x27;s &#x27;working-class credentials&#x27; in light of what were perceived to be (however inaccurately given his English, Scottish and Irish forebears) his &#x27;East End commercial middle-class Jewish&#x27; roots.

Brown attended Gray Street Elementary School in Blackfriars where he did well enough to pass an entrance examination to the West Square Central School, a junior grammar school and now part of a conservation area. Brown had already adopted his parents&#x27; left-wing views and later claimed to have delivered leaflets for the Labour Party in the 1922 general election when he was eight years old.

The school wanted Brown to stay on beyond the age of 15, but he decided to leave to earn his living and help his parents financially. He started work as a junior clerk in the ledger department of a City firm, but was made redundant after pressing his fellow clerks to join a trade union. From 1932, he worked as a fur salesman for the John Lewis Partnership, dropping his Cockney accent to appeal to society customers. Brown earned a great deal on commission. During this time, Brown continued his education through London County Council evening schools and the Workers&#x27; Educational Association. The poverty of his upbringing led Brown in later life to resent those who had a more privileged background and a university education.

===Trade union organiser===
Shortly after his marriage on 27 April 1937 to Sophie Levene, daughter of Solomon Levene, a bookbinder, Brown was employed as a ledger clerk with the Transport and General Workers Union, and appointed District Organiser for Watford the next year. By now Brown was active within the Labour Party and the Labour League of Youth. He ran as a moderate candidate for the Chairmanship but at the 1937 Labour Party conference he was defeated by a left-wing candidate, Ted Willis, later a writer for television. At the 1939 Party conference Brown made his mark by a strong speech demanding the expulsion of Stafford Cripps for his advocacy of a Popular Front. For the rest of Cripps&#x27;s life he refused to speak to Brown.

After the outbreak of the Second World War in September 1939, Brown volunteered for the Royal Air Force but Ernest Bevin, the Minister of Labour, kept Brown and other trade union officials in their civilian jobs. Bevin was one of the Labour leaders brought into the wartime coalition government. Brown himself served as a temporary civil servant in the Ministry of Agriculture from 1940 onwards.

== Early political career ==
=== Member of Parliament ===
As a TGWU official, Brown was an attractive candidate to Labour constituencies seeking a candidate, as the TGWU would sponsor him and pay election expenses. He was selected for Belper, a mixed constituency near Derby which was one of Labour&#x27;s principal target seats. In the 1945 general election, Brown gained the seat from the Conservatives with a majority of 8,881. He was invited as one of a dozen &#x27;Young Victors&#x27; to a private dinner given by Hugh Dalton on 30 July 1945 who was talent-spotting and networking. Brown was immediately chosen to be a Parliamentary Private Secretary (PPS) by George Isaacs, who had followed the promoted Bevin as Minister of Labour, but his time with Isaacs was brief.

Brown was both adept at understanding political issues and how to communicate them, and convivial and generally popular within the Parliamentary Labour Party (save among the left-wing faction, whom he attacked as &#x27;long-haired intellectuals&#x27;). He briefly worked as PPS for Chancellor of the Exchequer Hugh Dalton from April 1947, at a time when the economic situation of Britain had barely improved and the Chancellor needed the maximum political support. Brown launched an unsuccessful plot to have Clement Attlee replaced as Prime Minister by Ernest Bevin, although without consulting Bevin who did not approve.

===Ministerial office===
Attlee, despite knowing all about Brown&#x27;s plot to depose him, swiftly appointed Brown as Joint Parliamentary Secretary to the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries. The Prime Minister had decided that it would be best if Brown were kept busy. At the Ministry of Agriculture, Brown worked to pass the Agriculture Act 1947 which provided price support to farmers and also to provide more arable land and ease shortages of machinery and foodstuffs. Government policy aimed at increasing food production so that rationing in the United Kingdom could be lifted but progress was slow; Attlee grew to appreciate his talent. When his mentor Bevin died in April 1951, Brown was appointed Minister of Works in the Cabinet reshuffle – at the head of a Ministry but not in the Cabinet. Brown inherited a long-running struggle by the Government to have the Tower of London open to tourists on Sunday and managed to solve it by outsmarting the Constable of the Tower in negotiations.

==Opposition==
=== Election of 1951 ===
Brown ceased to be a minister when Labour lost the 1951 general election at the end of October. Like other Labour ex-ministers, Brown found himself forced to rely on an inadequate parliamentary salary; this led him to consider a return to being a trade union official. However, in 1953 he was hired as a consultant by the Mirror Group newspapers, enabling him to stay in politics.

Brown was a partisan participant in the Labour Party&#x27;s internecine struggles in the early 1950s, opposing the Bevanite campaign. His natural campaigning ability became well-known, as did his tendency to be rude to those with whom he had disagreements. Shortly after the 1955 general election, Brown was elected to the Shadow cabinet for the first time; from that December, when his friend Hugh Gaitskell became Leader of the Labour Party, Brown found it easier to win promotion. Brown had a private but widely publicised shouting-match with Soviet leaders Nikita Khrushchev and Nikolai Bulganin when he was part of a Labour Party delegation invited to dine with them on their British visit in April 1956. In October that year, he lost the election for Treasurer of the Labour Party to Aneurin Bevan by 3,029,000 to 2,755,000 votes.

===Deputy leadership===
When Bevan died in July 1960, the Deputy Leadership of the Labour Party became vacant at a time when the Labour Party was severely divided over Clause IV of the party constitution. Brown was encouraged to stand as the candidate of the Gaitskellite right; the other candidates were left-winger Frederick Lee and the moderate but insufficiently senior James Callaghan. Brown was elected, beating Lee by 146 votes to 83 when Callaghan had been eliminated. Gaitskell as Leader and Brown as Deputy Leader were not viewed by most of the Labour left as a balanced ticket, and Brown was challenged for the job in both 1961, by Barbara Castle, and 1962, by Harold Wilson. Part of his job was to improve Labour&#x27;s by-election campaigning, and he was successful in winning several, such as that at Middlesbrough West.

Gaitskell&#x27;s sudden death in January 1963 made Brown&#x27;s challenge for the party leadership inevitable. However, he mishandled the opening of his campaign. At the first Shadow Cabinet meeting after Gaitskell&#x27;s death, Brown and his leadership rival Harold Wilson agreed to a clean fight. Wilson, who was accused by the right of undermining party unity, then informed the press that each agreed to serve under the other, which countered his reputation for plotting; Brown repudiated any such agreement, laying himself open to that accusation.

===Personal problems===

Many on the right of the Labour Party, including Anthony Crosland and Denis Healey, supported James Callaghan for the leadership. They were opposed to Wilson&#x27;s being elected leader, but they had good reason not to trust Brown. Partly this was because of private knowledge of his excessive drinking, which exacerbated his rude and aggressive style of politics and originated the &quot;Private Eye&quot; euphemism for intoxication, &quot;tired and emotional&quot;. Crosland called the leadership election &quot;A choice between a crook (Wilson) and a drunk (Brown).&quot; Many Labour MPs who were prepared to accept Brown as deputy leader were unhappy with the idea of his being in charge, and Wilson was easily elected. His colleague Roy Jenkins says that he was:
:unenthusiastically but firmly for Brown...Brown was certainly not a tepid character. He had great qualities both of intellect and personality, although they were balanced by appalling faults. He drank too much, particularly for his not very strong head...And he confounded the trouble by being also capable of violent switches of mood, even when sober. On the big issues, he was almost invariably right and pursued his conviction with persistent courage.

The mainstream press had not publicised his drinking, but it later became apparent when Brown was invited on Associated-Rediffusion television to pay tribute to John F. Kennedy after his assassination (Brown was probably the closest Labour politician to Kennedy). Brown had come from a dinner in Shoreditch where he had already drunk a great deal, and drank more while preparing to go on air – having a row with actor Eli Wallach which became physical. When Brown went on air, millions of viewers saw him interpret a fair question as an accusation of his having overstated his closeness, then give a morose and slurred tribute from which it was apparent he was intoxicated. Brown had to issue a public apology.

Brown bitterly resented his leadership defeat, which came only weeks after he had defeated Wilson for the deputy leadership. He disappeared for five days after the result was declared, using an assumed name to book a flight to Glasgow; the newspapers were full of stories about the vanishing politician. When he returned he demanded of Wilson that he be appointed Shadow Foreign Secretary, which Wilson refused.

He retained the deputy leadership and despite his personal differences, played an important part in advising Wilson about Labour&#x27;s campaign strategy in the 1964 general election. It was decided that Wilson would make only a limited number of major campaign speeches outside London, while Brown would tour the country speaking in all the marginal seats (his main theme was predicting an imminent economic crisis). Brown later calculated that he had made 100 speeches. In one he made a gaffe by suggesting that the mortgage interest rate could be cut to 3%; the Conservative Chancellor of the Exchequer Reginald Maudling was quick to capitalise on this and ask how much it would cost.

== Secretary of State for Economic Affairs ==
===Department of Economic Affairs===
Labour won the election with a small parliamentary majority in 1964. As previously arranged with Wilson, Brown was appointed to the newly created Department of Economic Affairs and Deputy Prime Minister in October 1964 through which they both hoped to institute long-term economic planning and remove some of the power of the Treasury.

Immediately on taking office Brown was told that the budget deficit for the coming year was forecast at £800 million, double what the Labour Party had predicted as the worst possible figure before the election. The leading economic ministers were presented with three options, including devaluation of the pound sterling, to meet the crisis. They decided on a temporary surcharge on imported goods. However, over the next few months Brown was persuaded by his deputy Anthony Crosland that ruling out devaluation had been a mistake. The pound continued to be under pressure in 1965 and Brown struggled over a 12-hour meeting at the Trades Union Congress to persuade the unions to accept a tougher prices and incomes policy, to which he was personally opposed.

The most important function of the DEA was to prepare a &#x27;National Plan&#x27; for the economy. Brown became personally identified with the project, which helped increase enthusiasm for it among officials and the Labour Party, while also interesting the press. After nearly a year&#x27;s work the Plan was unveiled on 16 September 1965, pledging to cover &quot;all aspects of the country&#x27;s development for the next five years&quot;. The Plan called for a 25% growth in Gross Domestic Product (GDP) from 1964 to 1970, which worked out at 3.8% annually. There were 39 specific actions listed, although many were criticised as vague.

===July measures===
Following the 1966 general election at which Labour won re-election with a parliamentary majority of 96, the government was hit by a severe financial crisis. The question of devaluation was raised again in a more pressing way, with Brown now strongly supporting it, but Harold Wilson was firmly opposed, preferring a set of deflationary measures including spending cuts and interest rate rises. Brown believed that these measures would damage the economy. Chancellor of the Exchequer James Callaghan found himself in the middle, as he opposed devaluation but felt that without prompt action it was inevitable. Wilson tried to keep Brown on board, even offering to make him Chancellor should Callaghan resign, but Brown stood firm. When the Cabinet voted by 17–6 against devaluation, Brown sent a letter of resignation.

Wilson craftily sent the letter back to Brown so that he could deny having received it, and then sent George Wigg to try to talk Brown out of it. This did not prevent the news reaching the public; Wigg then changed his position and told Brown that Wilson would accept his resignation. Bizarrely this convinced Brown to stay and he accepted all of Wilson&#x27;s terms for staying in the government in a late night meeting before announcing his &quot;un-resignation&quot; to the press in Downing Street.

==Foreign Secretary==
=== Move to Foreign Office ===

Brown was reshuffled to become Foreign Secretary in August 1966, a job he coveted. He was considered by some of his Cabinet colleagues not to have &#x27;precisely the right temperament for the Foreign Office&#x27;. This decision had implications for the government&#x27;s stance on the European Economic Community as Brown had always favoured entry. Wilson had been sceptical, but not opposed outright, to joining but Brown persuaded him and the rest of the Labour Party to support an application. In May 1967 it was announced that Britain had made its second application to join. Like the first, it was vetoed by Charles de Gaulle.

Brown&#x27;s drinking became more pronounced as he became depressed by his loss of face in July 1966. His reaction to his depression was to launch vituperative attacks, for example at the son of newspaper proprietor Cecil King in October 1967. In 1968, he publicly insulted the wife of the British ambassador to France, Sir Patrick Reilly, at a dinner party at the French embassy in London, and later ended the ambassador&#x27;s career over personal differences. After Wilson was told of the incident with King, Brown came round and told Wilson that he had just had a terrible row with his wife and could not continue in Government. More and more people were becoming aware of Brown&#x27;s alcoholism, and &quot;Private Eye&quot; magazine managed to hint at the scandal with a parody of a memo titled &quot;Brown: F.O. Acts&quot;. The memo gave translations into various languages for the words tired, overwrought, expansive, overworked, colourful and emotional, and coined the phrase &quot;tired and emotional&quot; as a euphemism for &#x27;drunk&#x27;. A number of anecdotes recounting stories of his drunkenness circulated. The most well known was that, while drunk attending a formal function in Peru, he supposedly asked the Archbishop of Lima to dance with him, mistaking the Archbishop for a woman and not realising that the Peruvian national anthem was being played. The story is likely to be untrue as Brown did not visit South America during his term.

Brown, indeed, once boasted that &quot;Many members of parliament drink and womanise – now, I&#x27;ve never womanised&quot;; which was almost certainly true. There was never a whisper about his sex-life during his career.

===Resignation===
Despite devaluation in November 1967, the pound came again under severe pressure in March 1968. When Wilson wanted to declare an emergency bank holiday to give breathing space, he attempted to contact his Foreign Secretary. Brown could not be found and his staff reported his condition as &quot;only &#x27;so-so&#x27; when last seen&quot;, and so Wilson convened a special meeting of the Privy Council without him. Brown was incensed that Wilson had not tried further to contact him, and got together with other ministers who had not been informed to face down Wilson at a meeting in the early hours of the morning. Brown, who appeared very drunk, incoherently shouted at Wilson, who was almost as angry and stood up for himself. At the end of the meeting Brown stormed out.

It was unclear whether he had resigned but Brown did nothing the next day to apologise. At six o&#x27;clock that evening he sent a letter which said &quot;I think it better that we should part company&quot; but did not mention &quot;resignation&quot;. Wilson decided to reply by accepting Brown&#x27;s resignation but also sent a message saying that Brown had half an hour to say whether the letter had been misinterpreted. Brown did not act on this and so left the government, but not in the blaze of glory for which he had hoped.

In Cabinet papers released in 1999 it was clear that Wilson was in turmoil over Brown&#x27;s resignation in 1968: seventeen drafts of his reply were written before finally accepting his resignation.

=== Defeat ===
Brown&#x27;s constituency of Belper had undergone considerable development since he had been elected. Most of the new housing was for middle class areas near Derby and contained mostly Conservative voters. Although a Boundary Commission report in 1969 recommended the abolition of the seat, the Government decided to postpone the changes and Brown was obliged to stand in a seat which was shifting away from his party. Added to this problem, he remained deputy leader of the Labour Party and toured the country making speeches for other Labour candidates during the 1970 general election. His Conservative opponent Geoffrey Stewart-Smith had spent the last four years nursing the Parliamentary constituency. Brown lost his seat by more than 2,000 votes.

In Brown&#x27;s speech shortly after the result, he said that he would &quot;lend&quot; his constituency to the Conservatives.

== Later life ==
===Life peerage===
Brown swiftly decided not to try to regain his seat and received a life peerage in the Dissolution Honours List. When the award was announced, Brown told the press, &quot;As I understand it, I have to pick a title – but I hope to everybody, I will simply remain George Brown.&quot; This foreshadowed a long dispute over the wording of the title. Brown wished to be &quot;Lord George Brown&quot;, but Garter King of Arms argued that peerage titles traditionally included only surnames, not forenames. Brown had no sympathy with the objection, and noted that there had been counter-examples such as Lord Ritchie-Calder and Lord Francis-Williams. Also Field Marshal Sir Alan Brooke became Viscount Alanbrooke. Eventually, Garter King of Arms gave way on condition that Brown simultaneously change his surname to George-Brown, so finally his title ended as Baron George-Brown, &quot;of Jevington in the County of Sussex&quot;. In 1971, he published his memoirs, entitled &quot;In My Way&quot;. On hearing the title Harold Wilson supposedly commented that it was very appropriate, because that was just where he had always found George Brown over the years. He found work at the textile company Courtaulds, and later worked for Commercial Credit (Holdings) and British Northrop. He was also hired by the advertising agency, Fletcher Shelton Delaney, to make television commercials for P&amp;O&#x27;s Normandy Ferries.

On 2 March 1976, George-Brown announced that he was leaving the Labour Party in protest at government legislation which strengthened the closed shop. This announcement was overshadowed when he collapsed and fell into a gutter, having to be helped out by newspaper reporters, which was presumed to be a result of his drinking. &quot;The Times&quot; the next day printed the opinion that &quot;Lord George-Brown drunk is a better man than the Prime Minister sober.&quot;

George-Brown was invited to deliver the 1978 Marlow (Scotland) Lecture to the Institution of Engineers and Shipbuilders in Scotland. He chose the subject &quot;Britain&#x27;s future: the significance of the European dimension&quot;.

George-Brown became the president of the Social Democratic Alliance in January 1981, and was a signatory to an advertisement in &quot;The Guardian&quot; on 5 February in support of the Limehouse Declaration. However, he did not announce his membership of the Social Democratic Party (SDP) for another four years. By that point, his reputation had so declined that Bill Rodgers, who had been Brown&#x27;s Parliamentary Private Secretary at the Department of the Secretary of State for Economic Affairs (DEA) and the Foreign Office, described him as &quot;an embarrassment rather than an asset to his old friends who founded the SDP.&quot; His brother Ron, who had been a Labour MP since 1964, had also joined the party.

In 1978, George-Brown hired a young Canadian woman, Kathy Mason, as his personal secretary, and she worked for him until the spring of 1980. At that time, before returning to Canada, Mason trained the newly hired Maggie Haimes, then aged 31, to fill her position. Two years later, on 24 December 1982, after 45 years of marriage, Brown walked out on his wife and set up home with Haimes. He did not, however, change his 1969 will which gave his estate to Lady George-Brown.

===Death===
As his health deteriorated, George-Brown, an Anglo-Catholic Anglican was received into the Roman Catholic faith. Suffering from cirrhosis of the liver, he died following a stroke on 2 June 1985 at the age of 70 at Duchy Hospital in Truro, Cornwall. He was cremated at Golders Green Crematorium in London, and his ashes buried under a rose bush in the crematorium gardens. He was survived by his wife, Sophie, Lady George-Brown (née Levene) (1911–1990), daughters, Frieda and Pat, and mistress, Margaret &quot;Maggie&quot; Haimes.

<doc id="360268" wikidata="Q206271" url="?curid=360268" title="Ummagumma">
<text>Ummagumma is the fourth album by English rock band Pink Floyd. It is a double album and was released on 7 November 1969 by Harvest Records. The first disc consists of live recordings from concerts at Mothers Club in Birmingham and the College of Commerce in Manchester that contained part of their normal set list of the time, while the second contains solo compositions by each member of the band recorded at EMI Studios (now Abbey Road Studios). The artwork was designed by regular Pink Floyd collaborators Hipgnosis and features a number of pictures of the band combined to give a Droste effect. It was the last album cover to feature the band.

Although &quot;Ummagumma&quot; was well received at the time of release, and was a top-five hit in the UK album charts, it has since been looked upon unfavourably by critics and by the band, who have expressed lukewarm opinions about it in interviews. The album has been reissued on CD several times, along with the rest of their catalogue.

== Title ==
The album&#x27;s title supposedly comes from Cambridge slang for sex, commonly used by Pink Floyd friend and occasional roadie Iain &quot;Emo&quot; Moore, who would say, &quot;I&#x27;m going back to the house for some ummagumma&quot;. According to Moore, he made up the term himself. Drummer Nick Mason later said the album was titled &quot;because it sounded interesting and nice.&quot;

== Background ==

The original idea behind the live album was to feature fan favourites that would subsequently be dropped from the set. Although the sleeve notes say that the live material was recorded in June 1969, the live album of &quot;Ummagumma&quot; was recorded live at Mothers Club in Birmingham on 27 April 1969 and the following week at Manchester College of Commerce on 2 May as part of The Man and The Journey Tour. Keyboardist Richard Wright later said the recording of &quot;A Saucerful of Secrets&quot; was a composite from both gigs. A show at Bromley Technical College on 26 April was also recorded but not used. The band had also recorded a live version of &quot;Interstellar Overdrive&quot; (from &quot;The Piper at the Gates of Dawn&quot;) intended for placement on side one of the live album, and &quot;Embryo&quot;, which was recorded in the studio before it was decided that the band members each come up with their own material.

The studio album was recorded in stages between September 1968 and July 1969. The structure came as a result of Wright wanting to make &quot;real music&quot;, where the four group members (in order: Wright, Roger Waters, David Gilmour and Mason) each had half an LP side to create a solo work without involvement from the others. Wright&#x27;s contribution, &quot;Sysyphus&quot;, was named after a character in Greek mythology, usually spelled &quot;Sisyphus&quot;, and contained a combination of various keyboards, including piano and mellotron. Although initially enthusiastic about making a solo contribution, Wright later described it as &quot;pretentious&quot;.

Waters&#x27; &quot;Grantchester Meadows&quot; was a more pastoral acoustic offering that referred back to his youth in the Cambridge suburbs. It originated from an instrumental piece that had been occasionally performed live and was usually played as an opening to concerts during 1969, with vocals. His other track, &quot;Several Species of Small Furry Animals Gathered Together in a Cave and Grooving with a Pict&quot;, contained a variety of vocal and percussion effects treated at various speeds, both forwards and backwards, and was influenced by Ron Geesin, who would later collaborate with both Waters and Pink Floyd. The two tracks were bridged by the sound of a fly being swatted.

Gilmour has since stated he was apprehensive about creating a solo work, and admits he &quot;went into a studio and started waffling about, tacking bits and pieces together&quot;, although part one of &quot;The Narrow Way&quot; had already been performed as &quot;Baby Blue Shuffle in D Major&quot; in a BBC radio session in December 1968. Gilmour said he &quot;just bullshitted&quot; through the piece. He asked Waters to write some lyrics for his compositions, but Waters refused to do so. The third part of the suite was briefly performed live in early 1969.

Mason&#x27;s three-part &quot;The Grand Vizier&#x27;s Garden Party&quot; featured his then wife, Lindy, playing uncredited flute on the first and third parts. The seven-minute second part incorporated percussion, tape effects and drum soloing. Although this track was not performed live, a similar drum solo, &quot;Doing It&quot;, was incorporated into &quot;The Man&quot; live suite.

== Packaging ==
The album was the first album by the band released on the Harvest label. The cover artwork shows a Droste effect featuring the group, with a picture hanging on the wall showing the same scene, except that the band members have switched positions, and this is then repeated two more times. On most older editions, in the very center of the Droste pattern is a tiny rendering of the band&#x27;s previous LP &quot;A Saucerful of Secrets&quot;; newer editions depict the Droste pattern repeating indefinitely. The cover of the original LP varies between the British, United States, Canadian and Australian releases. The British version has the &quot;Gigi&quot; soundtrack album leaning against the wall immediately above the &quot;Pink Floyd&quot; letters. Storm Thorgerson explained that the album was introduced as a red herring to provoke debate, and that it has no intended meaning. On most copies of US and Canadian editions, the &quot;Gigi&quot; cover is airbrushed to a plain white sleeve, apparently because of copyright concerns, but the earliest US copies do show the &quot;Gigi&quot; cover, and it was restored for the US remastered CD edition. On the Australian edition, the &quot;Gigi&quot; cover is completely airbrushed, not even leaving a white square behind. The house used as the location for the front cover of the album is located in Great Shelford, near Cambridge.

On the rear cover, roadies Alan Styles (who also appears in &quot;Alan&#x27;s Psychedelic Breakfast&quot;) and Peter Watts are shown with the band&#x27;s equipment laid out on a taxiway at London Biggin Hill Airport. This concept was proposed by Mason, with the intention of replicating the &quot;exploded&quot; drawings of military aircraft and their payloads, which were popular at the time. The inner gatefold art shows separate black-and-white photos of the band members. Gilmour is seen standing in front of the Elfin Oak. Original vinyl editions showed Waters with his first wife, Judy Trim, but she has been cropped out of the picture on most CD editions (with the original photo&#x27;s caption &quot;Roger Waters (and Jude)&quot; accordingly changed to just &quot;Roger Waters&quot;). The uncropped picture was restored for the album&#x27;s inclusion in the box set &quot;Oh, by the Way&quot;.

On the US and Canadian release there are additional titles of the four sections of the song &quot;A Saucerful of Secrets&quot;. These titles did not appear on British editions, nor on any copies of the earlier album &quot;A Saucerful of Secrets&quot;.

== Release history ==
&quot;Ummagumma&quot; was released in the UK and US on 7 and 8 November 1969, respectively. It reached number 5 on the UK albums chart and number 74 in the US, marking the first time the band reached the top 100 there. Similarly in Canada, it was their first appearance on the charts, reaching number 78. The album was certified gold in the US in February 1974 and platinum in March 1994. US versions of the cassette retained only &quot;Astronomy Domine&quot; from the live set and omitted the three other tracks. In 1987, the album was re-released on a two-CD set. A digitally remastered version was issued in 1994.

In 2009, to mark the 40th anniversary of the album&#x27;s release, Thorgerson sold a limited number of autographed lithographs of the front cover.

In 2011, it was reissued featuring a remastered version with various other material. Although the 2011 re-release campaign &quot;Why Pink Floyd...?&quot; presented all fourteen albums newly remastered in 2011, only the studio disc of &quot;Ummagumma&quot; was remastered – the live disc is the previous 1994 version. Both the live and studio album were re-issued in 2016 with Pink Floyd Records label.

== Reception ==

On release, &quot;Ummagumma&quot; received favourable reviews. &quot;International Times&quot; was particularly positive about the live album, with the reviewer describing it as &quot;probably one of the best live recordings I have ever heard&quot;. &quot;Stylus Magazine&quot; was very positive towards the album, saying the live album was &quot;as a visceral document of the early Floyd&#x27;s proclivity for atmospheric, energetic jamming, there&#x27;s nothing else like it&quot; and that the studio one &quot;somehow transcends its fractured construction to make a full album-length statement&quot;.

However, retrospective reviewers have given it mixed-to-negative ratings. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; and &quot;MusicHound&quot; each awarded the album a score of 2.5 out of 5, while &quot;Paste&quot;, reviewing the 2011 re-release, described the album as &quot;rock excess of the worst kind&quot;, although the writer praised the live version of &quot;Careful with that Axe, Eugene&quot;. In his review for the Pink Floyd album &quot;Atom Heart Mother&quot;, Robert Christgau suggested that &quot;Ummagumma&quot;″s &quot;hypnotic melodies&quot; made it &quot;an admirable record to fall asleep to&quot;. Paul Stump, in his book &quot;The Music&#x27;s All that Matters: A History of Progressive Rock&quot;, approved of the first disc for its &quot;often involvingly spiritual live improvisation&quot;, while deriding most of the studio disc, going so far as to liken &quot;Sysyphus&quot; to &quot;an excitable two-year-old let loose on the bass end of a piano keyboard&quot;. However, he praised both of Waters&#x27;s solo contributions and the editing and splicing techniques used on &quot;The Grand Vizier&#x27;s Tea Party&quot;. Bradley Smith&#x27;s &quot;The Billboard Guide to Progressive Music&quot; (1997) recognises the studio disc as the more significant half of the record and also as &quot;perhaps one of the most adventurous recordings ever released by a major label group.&quot;

The band have since been dismissive and critical of the work. Recalling the album in later years, Waters said: &quot;&quot;Ummagumma&quot; – what a disaster!&quot; In 1995, Gilmour described the album as &quot;horrible&quot;, though he thought the live album might be acceptable musically. In a 1984 interview, Mason said: &quot;I thought it was a very good and interesting little exercise, the whole business of everyone doing a bit. But I still feel really that that&#x27;s quite a good example of the sum being greater than the parts ...&quot; Later, he described it as &quot;a failed experiment&quot;, adding that &quot;the most significant thing is that we didn&#x27;t do it again&quot;.

=== Dragonfly species ===

In December 2015 scientists named a newfound insect of the genus &quot;Umma&quot; – a damselfly – &quot;Umma gumma&quot; after the album.

<text>Arla Foods Group is a Danish-Swedish multinational co-operative based in Viby, Denmark. It is the fifth biggest dairy company in the world and the largest producer of dairy products in Scandinavia and United Kingdom.

Arla Foods was formed as the result of a merger between the Swedish dairy co-operative Arla and the Danish dairy company MD Foods on 17 April 2000. The name Arla derives from the same word as the English word &#x27;early&#x27; and is an archaic Swedish term for &#x27;early (in the morning)&#x27;.

==History ==
===Origins===
In the 1880s, dairy farmers in Sweden and Denmark formed small co-operatives to invest in common dairy production facilities. The first dairy co-operative was established in Sweden at Stora Arla Gård in Västmanland in 1881 under the name of Arla Mejeriförening, and the first Danish cooperative dairy was established in Hjedding, outside Ølgod, Southern Jutland in 1882.

On 26 April 1915, dairy farmers in Stockholm and adjoining counties created Sweden&#x27;s largest co-operative dairy organisation, Lantmännens mjölkförsäljningsförening (the Farmers&#x27; Milk Retail Association), which operated dairies as well as a chain of shops selling dairy products.

In 1927, the company registered the name Mjölkcentralen (The Milk Centre, shortened MC) and from the 1950s a growing number of cooperative dairies in other parts of Sweden began joining MC. In 1975, MC changed its name to Arla, a name previously used not only by Sweden&#x27;s first co-operative dairy, but also by the largest dairy retailer in Gothenburg between 1909 and 1965.

By the end of the 20th century, Arla had a 65% market share in Sweden.

On 1 October 1970, Mejeriselskabet Danmark (MD) was established by four dairy companies and three individual dairies. In 1988, the company changed name to MD Foods. In 1992, MD Foods and Denmark&#x27;s second largest dairy company, Kløver Mælk, signed a financially binding co-operation agreement, and in 1999, the two companies merged to become MD Foods, gaining 90% of the Danish milk production.

In April 2000, MD Foods merged with Swedish Arla and formed Arla Foods A.m.b.A with headquarters in Aarhus, Denmark, and became Arla Foods as it is known today.

In 2012 the UK&#x27;s leading dairy farmer co-operative Milk Link joined Arla Foods Amba, to become one of the largest and most successful European Dairy Co-operatives.

===Current operations===
Arla Foods is the fourth largest dairy company in the world with respect to milk volume, seventh with respect to turnover. At the start of 2022, 8,492 farmers across Denmark, Sweden, Germany, the UK, Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg owned the cooperative.

Arla Foods has many brands; several minor brands and four strategic brands. The major and strategic brands are: Arla, Lurpak, Puck and Castello cheeses that are sold worldwide. The Arla Brand is both a co-operative brand and a brand across all product categories. The Lurpak brand of butter and spreads is owned by the Danish Dairy Board, Puck is Arla brand equivalent in the MENA region, and Castello is a cheese brand including blue cheese and yellow cheeses.

Next to the four major brands, Arla also has a long-term strategic partnership with Starbucks to manufacture, distribute and market their RTD (ready to drink) coffee products for the EMEA region (Europe, the Middle East and Africa).

In 2011 Arla Foods incorporated Arla Foods Ingredients (AFI), a former division, as an independent subsidiary. The company develops and manufactures milk based ingredients, primarily functional and nutritional milk proteins, bioactive phospholipids, minerals, permeate and lactose for the food industry.

The head office is located in Denmark. Arla Foods Ingredients has one wholly owned production plant in Denmark, with joint venture production at facilities in Argentina and Germany. In March 2011, Arla Foods and DMK formed the joint venture company ArNoCo GmbH &amp; Co. KG, to produce whey proteins for the food industry. In February 2018, Arla Foods announced its plans to invest £70 million in the UK, as part of its strategy to secure long-term opportunities for its farmers across Europe. In October 2019, Arla Foods has invested an estimated €50 million (US$55 million) in a cheese production site in Bahrain. By 2025, Arla expects to increase annual production in Bahrain to more than 100,000 tons under its Puck, Arla, Dano, Kraft and Private Label brands.

==== 2006 boycott ====
Arla&#x27;s sales were seriously affected by a two-month long boycott of Danish products in the Middle East in 2006. Anger among Muslims over satirical cartoons of Prophet Muhammad published in Denmark was the initial cause.

When the Danish government refused to condemn the cartoons or meet with eleven ambassadors from Muslim nations, a boycott of Danish products was organised, starting in Saudi Arabia and spreading across the Middle East. The Middle East is Arla&#x27;s largest market outside of Europe.

On 3 February 2006, the company said that sales in the Middle East dried up completely, costing the company US$2 million a day. Soon after the boycott hit Arla&#x27;s sales, the Danish government met with Muslim ambassadors and the newspaper issued an apology. Despite this, the boycott continued unabated for two months.

In March 2006, Arla took out full page advertising in Saudi Arabia, apologising for the cartoons and indicating Arla&#x27;s respect for Islam in the country. This caused controversy in Denmark, where women&#x27;s organisations and some politicians criticised Arla, and called on Danish women to boycott Arla&#x27;s products in Denmark. In April 2006, the company said that its products were being placed back in shops in the Middle East.

Before the boycott, it supplied shops in the area. It announced that many of its largest clients in Saudi Arabia would start selling its butter and cheese on 8 April 2006. At that time, Arla began sponsoring humanitarian causes in the Middle East to foster good public relations with the region.

==== Don&#x27;t Cancel the Cow campaign ====
In 2022, Arla launched an advertising campaign called Don&#x27;t Cancel the Cow claiming the rise of veganism among young people was the reason the dairy industry&#x27;s future is uncertain. The campaign targets young people over their concern about the environmental impact of cows milk.

==== Bovaer ====
In November 2024 in the UK, the use of Bovaer led to calls on social media for a consumer boycott of Arla products, including Lurpak butter. Arla Foods had announced that 30 of its farms across the country would test the additive, which can reduce cow methane emissions by between 30 and 45%. Bovaer is approved for use by UK regulators, however SVT reported that conspiracy theories were being spread that the feed supplement was poisonous, with some online users raising concerns, citing issues around the safety of certain compounds used in it. The manufacturer, DSM-Firmenich, said &quot;mistruths and misinformation, external&quot; had been spread about the product, that it was &quot;totally safe&quot; for use, and that it had been &quot;tested over many years in many countries.&quot; The supplement had already been tested by Arla in Sweden during 2023 on five farms.

<doc id="360274" wikidata="Q61718" url="?curid=360274" title="Frederick Schomberg, 1st Duke of Schomberg">
<text>Frederick Herman de Schomberg, 1st Duke of Schomberg (6 December 1615 – 1 July 1690) was a German-born army officer who served as the English Master-General of the Ordnance from 1689 to 1690. Having fought in the French, Portuguese, Dutch and English armies, he was killed in action fighting on the Williamite side at the Battle of the Boyne in 1690.

==Early career==
Descended from an old family of the Electorate of the Palatinate, he was born at Heidelberg, the son of Count Hans Meinhard von Schönberg (1582–1616) and Anne, a daughter of Edward Sutton, 5th Baron Dudley, and Theodosia Harington. An orphan within a few months of his birth, he was educated by various family friends, among whom was Frederick V, Elector Palatine, in whose service his father had been. He began his military career under Frederick Henry, Prince of Orange, and in 1634 passed into the service of Sweden, entering that of France in 1635. His family, and the allied house of the Saxon Schönbergs, had already attained eminence in France with Henri de Schomberg and Charles de Schomberg, both marshals of France.

After a time he retired to his family estate at Geisenheim on the Rhine, but in 1639 he re-entered the Dutch States Army, in which, apparently, apart from a few intervals at Geisenheim, he remained until about 1650. He then rejoined the French army as a general officer (&quot;maréchal de camp&quot;), served under Turenne in the campaigns against Condé, and became a lieutenant-general in 1665, receiving this rapid promotion perhaps partly owing to his relationship with Charles de Schomberg, duc d&#x27;Halluin.

After the peace of the Pyrenees (1659), the independence of Portugal was threatened by Spain, and Schomberg was sent as military adviser to Lisbon with the secret approval of Charles II of England. Louis XIV of France, in order not to infringe the treaty just made with Spain, deprived Schomberg of his French officers. Schomberg thus took command of the English brigade which consisted of three regiments in total 3,000 men. Many of these were ex Royalist and New Model Army troops from the Civil War. After many difficulties in the three first campaigns resulting from the opposition of Portuguese officers, the Portuguese commander António Luís de Meneses, 1st Marquis of Marialva, together with Schomberg won the victory of Montes Claros on 17 June 1665 over the Spaniards under Luis de Benavides Carrillo, Marquis of Caracena.

After participating with his army in the revolution which deposed the reigning king Afonso VI of Portugal in favour of his brother Dom Pedro, and ending the war with Spain, Schomberg returned to France, became a naturalised Frenchman and bought the lordship of Coubert near Paris. He had been rewarded by the king of Portugal, in 1663, with the rank of Grandee, the title of count of Mértola and a pension of f 5000 a year. In 1673 he was brought by Charles II to England to take command of the newly formed Blackheath Army, which was planned to take part in an invasion of the Dutch Republic during the Third Anglo-Dutch War. However the army did not go into action before the Treaty of Westminster established peace, and was disbanded by the King following Parliamentary pressure.

He therefore again entered the service of France. His first operations in Catalonia were unsuccessful owing to the disobedience of subordinates and the rawness of his troops. On 19 June 1674, he was dealt a defeat at the Battle of Maureillas by Francisco de Tutavilla y del Rufo, but he retrieved the failure by retaking Fort de Bellegarde in 1675. For this he was made a marshal, being included in the promotion that followed the death of Turenne. The tide had now turned against the Huguenots, and Schomberg&#x27;s merits had been long ignored on account of his adherence to the Protestant religion. The revocation of the Edict of Nantes (1685) forced him to leave his adopted country.

Ultimately he became general-in-chief of the forces of the Frederick William, Elector of Brandenburg, and at Berlin he was the acknowledged leader of the thousands of Huguenot refugees there. Soon afterwards, with the Electors consent, he joined the Prince of Orange on his expedition to England in 1688, the Glorious Revolution, as second in command to the prince. The following year he was made a Knight of the Garter, was appointed Master-General of the Ordnance, was created Duke of Schomberg, and received from the House of Commons a vote of £100,000 to compensate him for the loss of his French estates, of which Louis had deprived him.

==Ireland==

In July 1689, William appointed him commander-in-chief of the expedition that he undertook to drive James II out of Ireland. Before departing to Ireland, Schomberg took his leave from parliament on 16 July 1689. On 20 July Schomberg arrived at Chester where the expedition&#x27;s troops were gathering. Sailing with a fleet from Hoylake, he landed on 13 August 1689 at Ballyholme Bay near Bangor. He made the passage on the royal yacht Cleveland. He then marched over Bangor and Belfast to Carrickfergus, which had a Jacobite garrison. He began the siege of Carrickfergus on 20 August. The town surrendered on 28 August. Thereafter he marched unopposed through a country desolated before him to Dundalk, but, as the bulk of his forces were raw and undisciplined as well as inferior in numbers to the enemy Irish Army, he deemed it imprudent to risk a battle, and entrenching himself at Dundalk declined to be drawn beyond the circle of his defences. Shortly afterwards pestilence broke out, and when he retired to winter quarters in Ulster his forces were more shattered than if they had sustained a severe defeat.

His conduct was criticized in ill-informed quarters, but the facts justified his inactivity, and he gave what was said at the time to be a &quot;striking example of his generous spirit&quot; in placing at William of Orange&#x27;s disposal for military purposes the £100,000 recently granted to him. In the spring he began the campaign with the capture of Charlemont, but no advance southward was made until William arrived with reinforcements. At the Battle of the Boyne (1 July 1690 O.S.), Schomberg gave his opinion against the determination of William to cross the river in face of the opposing army. After riding through the river to rally his men, he was wounded twice in the head by sabre cuts, and was shot in the neck by Cahir O&#x27;Toole of Ballyhubbock and instantly killed.

==Family==
His eldest son Charles Schomberg, the second duke in the English peerage, died in the year 1693 of wounds received at the Battle of Marsaglia. His other son was Meinhardt Schomberg, 3rd Duke of Schomberg.

==Burial and inscription==

He was buried in St Patrick&#x27;s Cathedral, Dublin, where there is a monument to him, erected in 1731. On the monument is a Latin inscription by Jonathan Swift, which reads:

The English translation:

Additionally, the Boyne Obelisk (which was erected on the north bank of the River Boyne in 1736, to commemorate the Williamite victory at the Battle of the Boyne, and later destroyed in 1923) contained an inscription to him on its south side base, reading:

The village of Schomberg, Ontario is named after him.

<doc id="360275" wikidata="Q210140" url="?curid=360275" title="Obscured by Clouds">
<text>Obscured by Clouds is the seventh studio album by the English progressive rock band Pink Floyd, released on 2 June 1972 by Harvest and Capitol Records. It serves as the soundtrack for the French film &quot;La Vallée&quot;, by Barbet Schroeder. It was recorded in two sessions in France, while Pink Floyd were in the midst of touring, and produced by the band.

&quot;Obscured by Clouds&quot; is among Pink Floyd&#x27;s shorter albums and makes heavy use of the acoustic guitar. Lyrically, the songs centre around love, a theme the album has in common with the film. The album&#x27;s only single was &quot;Free Four&quot;. &quot;Obscured by Clouds&quot; has been seen as a stopgap for the band, who had started work on their next album, &quot;The Dark Side of the Moon&quot; (1973). The album reached number six in the United Kingdom and number 46 in the United States; retrospective opinions from both fans and critics have been mixed, some critics noting the similarities to their later material.

==Background==
By 1972, Pink Floyd had recorded the soundtracks to the films &quot;The Committee&quot; (1968) and &quot;More&quot; (1969), and part of &quot;Zabriskie Point&quot; (1970). On the back of &quot;More&quot;″s success, its director, Barbet Schroeder, asked them to record the soundtrack to his next major project. The new film, &quot;La Vallée&quot;, features two travellers on a spiritual quest in New Guinea, and Schroeder thought Pink Floyd would be suitable to provide the music. The group had already started working on another album, &quot;The Dark Side of the Moon&quot;, including some basic recording and live performances, but took two breaks to Strawberry Studios, Château d&#x27;Hérouville, France, just before and after doing a Japanese tour, to write and record music for the film. The album was mixed from 4–6 April at Morgan Sound Studios in London.

As they had done on &quot;More&quot;, the band saw a rough cut of the film and noted certain timings for cues with a stopwatch. From this, they created a number of pieces that they felt could be cross-faded at various points in the final cut of the film. They were not worried about creating complete songs, feeling that any musical piece would be workable without the need for any solos, but nevertheless, under pressure to produce enough material, they managed to create a series of well-structured songs. Drummer Nick Mason recalls that the sessions were very hurried, and the band spent most of the time in Paris locked away in the studio.

During the first recording session in February 1972, the French television station ORTF filmed a short segment of the band recording the album, including interviews with bassist Roger Waters and guitarist David Gilmour. In a snippet of interview footage at Abbey Road Studios that appeared in the 1974 theatrical version (later released on VHS and Laserdisc and subsequent &quot;Director&#x27;s Cut&quot; DVD) of &quot;Pink Floyd: Live at Pompeii&quot;, Waters said that early UK pressings of the album contained excessive sibilance.

After recording had finished, the band fell out with the film company, prompting them to release the soundtrack album as &quot;Obscured by Clouds&quot;, rather than &quot;La Vallée&quot;. In response, the film was retitled &quot;La Vallée (Obscured by Clouds)&quot; on its release.

==Songs==
The songs on &quot;Obscured by Clouds&quot; are all short and economical, in contrast to the lengthy instrumentals found on other Floyd albums. A strong country music influence is present on several tracks, with prominent use of acoustic guitar. The album also features the VCS 3 synthesiser, which Wright had purchased from the BBC Radiophonic Workshop.

The title track makes prominent use of the VCS 3, and features Mason playing electronic drums. The following track, &quot;When You&#x27;re In&quot;, is similar in style. Its title came from a phrase said by roadie Chris Adamson. The two pieces were played back-to-back live in late 1972 and on the 1973 tours. They were also part of the set used for the group&#x27;s collaboration with Roland Petit and the Ballet National de Marseille at the Palais de Sports, Paris, in early 1973.

&quot;Burning Bridges&quot; is one of two songwriting collaborations on the album between keyboardist Richard Wright (who wrote the music) and Waters (who wrote the lyrics). &quot;Wot&#x27;s... Uh the Deal?&quot; is a straightforward acoustic piece. It was never performed live by Pink Floyd, but Gilmour resurrected the piece for his solo tour in 2006. One of these performances features on Gilmour&#x27;s 2007 DVD &quot;Remember That Night&quot; and the vinyl version of his 2008 live album, &quot;Live in Gdańsk&quot;. &quot;Mudmen&quot; is an instrumental adaptation of &quot;Burning Bridges&quot; in a different time signature, and one of the few tracks from this era to be credited to just Wright and Gilmour.

&quot;Childhood&#x27;s End&quot; was the last song Pink Floyd released to have lyrics written by Gilmour until the release of &quot;A Momentary Lapse of Reason&quot; in 1987. The title may have been derived from the Arthur C. Clarke novel of the same name. It was performed live at a few gigs in late 1972 and early the following year; the drum pattern opening the track was recycled for &quot;Time&quot; on &quot;The Dark Side of the Moon&quot;.

&quot;Free Four&quot; was the first Pink Floyd song since &quot;See Emily Play&quot; to attract significant airplay in the US, and the second (after &quot;Corporal Clegg&quot; from &quot;A Saucerful of Secrets&quot;) to refer to the death of Waters&#x27; father during World War II. The title is derived from the count-in &quot;One, two, &#x27;free, four!&quot;, spoken in a Cockney accent. The track was released as a single in the US, as the band felt it was suitable for AM radio.

&quot;Stay&quot; was written and sung by Wright, with lyrics by Waters. It is superficially a love song, except the protagonist cannot remember the girl&#x27;s name, suggesting that she might have been a groupie. &quot;Absolutely Curtains&quot;, the closing instrumental on the album, is primarily based around Wright&#x27;s keyboards. It ends with a recording of the Mapuga tribe chanting, as seen in the film.

==Cover==
The album&#x27;s cover was, like several other Pink Floyd albums, designed by Storm Thorgerson and Aubrey Powell of Hipgnosis. The cover is a still from a workprint of &quot;La Vallée&quot; depicting a man (Jean-Pierre Kalfon as Gaëtan) sitting in a tree, reaching out to pick the fruit from one of its branches. The still is out of focus to the point of complete distortion. Hipgnosis viewed a number of stills from the film on a 35mm projector and liked the visual effect when the slide jammed. Schroeder later said the band did not want to make the cover particularly good as &quot;The Dark Side of the Moon&quot; would have to compete with it, but Thorgerson insisted it be given proper consideration like any other Floyd album.

==Release and reception==
&quot;Obscured by Clouds&quot; was released in the UK on 2 June 1972 and then in the United States on 15 June 1972, both on Harvest. The album reached number one in France, number six on the UK Albums Chart, and number 46 on the US albums chart (where it was certified Gold by the RIAA in 1997). In 1986, the album was released on CD. A digitally remastered CD was released in March 1996 in the UK and August 1996 in the US. It was remixed in 2016 for the &quot;Early Years&quot; box set, and released individually the following year.

Even among fans, it is not one of Pink Floyd&#x27;s more popular albums, though Mason has said it is one of his favourite Floyd albums. Retrospective critical reception has been mixed; &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; said &quot;its elegant instrumentals point the way to &quot;Dark Side&quot;&quot;, while &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; said it was a &quot;dull film soundtrack&quot;.

<text>The Malaysian ringgit (; plural: ringgit; symbol: RM; currency code: MYR; Malay name: &quot;Ringgit Malaysia&quot;; formerly the Malaysian dollar) is the currency of Malaysia. Issued by the Central Bank of Malaysia, it is divided into 100 cents (Malay: ).

== Etymology ==

The word &quot;ringgit&quot; is an obsolete term for &quot;jagged&quot; in the Malay language. The word was originally used to refer to serrated edges. The first European coins to circulate widely in the region were Spanish &quot;pieces of eight&quot; or &quot;cob&quot;, their crude appearance resembling stones, hence the word jagged. The availability and circulation of this Spanish currency were due to the Spanish controlling nearby Philippines.

An early printed source, the &quot;Dictionary of the Malayan Language&quot; from 1812 had already referred to the ringgit as a unit of money.

In modern usage, &quot;ringgit&quot; is used almost solely for the currency. Due to the common heritage of the three modern currencies, the Singapore dollar and the Brunei dollar are also called &quot;ringgit&quot; in Malay (currencies such as the US and Australian dollars are translated as &quot;dolar&quot;), although nowadays the Singapore dollar is more commonly called &quot;dolar&quot; in Malay. To differentiate between the three currencies, the Malaysian currency is referred to as &quot;Ringgit Malaysia&quot;, hence the official abbreviation and currency symbol &quot;RM&quot;. Internationally, the ISO 4217 currency code for Malaysian ringgit is &quot;MYR&quot;.

The Malay names &quot;ringgit&quot; and &quot;sen&quot; were officially adopted as the sole official names on 28 August 1975. Previously they had been known officially as dollars and cents in English and ringgit and sen in Malay, and in some parts of the country this usage continues. In the northern states of Peninsular Malaysia, denominations of 10 &quot;sen&quot; are called &quot;kupang&quot; in Northern Malay and called &quot;pua̍t&quot; (鏺/鈸) in Penang Hokkien which is thought to be derived from the Thai word &quot;baht&quot;. e.g. 50 &quot;sen&quot; is &quot;lima kupang&quot; in Malay or &#x27;samah&#x27; in the Kelantan dialect and &quot;gōo-pua̍t&quot; (五鏺/鈸) in Hokkien. The Tamil speaking communities in Malaysia use &quot;veḷḷi&quot; (வெள்ளி) meaning &quot;silver&quot; in Tamil to refer to &quot;ringgit&quot;, while for &quot;sen&quot;, the word &quot;kācu&quot; (காசு) is used, from which the English word &quot;cash&quot; is derived.

== History ==

=== Before independence ===

The Spanish-American silver dollar brought over by the Manila galleons was the primary currency for international trade, used in Asia and the Americas from the 16th to 19th centuries; it was eventually called the &quot;ringgit&quot;. The various dollars introduced in the 19th century were itself derived from the Spanish dollar: the Straits dollar, Sarawak dollar and the British North Borneo dollar. From these dollars were derived their successor currencies the Malayan dollar and the Malaya and British Borneo dollar, and eventually the modern-day Malaysian ringgit, Singapore dollar and Brunei dollar.

=== After independence (1967–1997) ===

On 12 June 1967, the Malaysian dollar, issued by the new central bank, Central Bank of Malaysia, replaced the Malaya and British Borneo dollar at par. The new currency retained all denominations of its predecessor except the $10,000 denomination, and also brought over the colour schemes of the old dollar. Over the course of the following decades, minor changes were made to the notes and coins issued, from the introduction of the M$1 coin in 1967, to the demonetization of RM500 and RM1,000 notes in 1999.

As the Malaysian dollar replaced the Malaya and British Borneo dollar at par and Malaysia was a participating member of the sterling area, the new dollar was originally valued at dollars per 1 British pound sterling; in turn, £1 = US$2.80 so that US$1 = M$3.06. In November 1967, five months after the introduction of the Malaysian dollar, the pound was devalued by 14.3% from US$2.80 to US$2.40, leading to a collapse in confidence for the sterling area and its demise in 1972. The new currency stayed pegged to the U.S. dollar at US$1 = M$3.06, but earlier notes of the Malaya and British Borneo dollar were devalued from US$2.80 to US$2.40 for 8.57 dollars; consequently these notes were reduced in value to 85 cents per dollar.

Despite the emergence of new currencies in Malaysia, Singapore and Brunei, the Interchangeability Agreement which the three countries adhered to as original members of the currency union meant the Malaysian dollar was exchangeable at par with the Singapore dollar and Brunei dollar. This ended on 8 May 1973, when the Malaysian government withdrew from the agreement. The Monetary Authority of Singapore and the Brunei Currency and Monetary Board still maintain the interchangeability of their two currencies, as of 2021. The Malaysian Ringgit name was introduced in 1975.

In 1993, the currency symbol &quot;RM&quot; (Ringgit Malaysia) was introduced to replace the use of the dollar sign &quot;$&quot; (or &quot;M$&quot;).

=== Asian financial crisis and US dollar currency peg (1997–2005) ===

Between 1995 and 1997, the ringgit was trading as a free float currency at around 2.50 to the US dollar, but following the onset of the 1997 Asian financial crisis, the ringgit witnessed major dips to under 3.80 MYR/USD by the end of 1997 as a result of capital flight. During the first half of 1998, the currency fluctuated between 3.80 and 4.40 MYR/USD, before the Central Bank of Malaysia moved to peg the ringgit to the US dollar in September 1998, maintaining its 3.80 MYR/USD value while remaining floated against other currencies. In addition, the ringgit was designated non-tradeable outside of Malaysia in 1998 to stem the flow of money out of the country.

While the printing of RM500 and RM1,000 notes had ceased in 1996 in response to risks of money laundering and capital flight, the underestimated effects of the financial crisis prompted the central bank to completely discontinue the use of the notes by demonetising the remaining notes in circulation beginning 1 July 1999. The two denominations hereby ceased to be legal tender and were only exchangeable directly at the central bank; at the time of the demonetization, RM500 and RM1,000 notes were each worth approximately US$130 and US$260 respectably, based on the 3.80 MYR/USD peg rate. Despite these measures, some 7.6% of RM500 notes and 0.6% of RM1,000 notes remain in circulation as of 30 January 2011. During a 2011 parliamentary session, then Deputy Finance Minister Donald Lim Siang Chai asserted that a total of 150,599 and 26,018 pieces of RM500 and RM1,000 notes (RM75,299,500 worth of RM500 notes and RM26,018,000.00 worth of RM1,000 notes) have yet to be &quot;recalled&quot; through the central bank. 

The ringgit lost 50% of its value against the US dollar between 1997 and 1998, and suffered general depreciation against other currencies between December 2001 and January 2005. As of 4 September 2008, the ringgit had yet to regain its value circa 2001 against the Singapore dollar (2.07 to 2.40 MYR/SGD), the euro (3.40 to 4.97 MYR/EUR), the Australian dollar (1.98 to 2.80 MYR/AUD), and the British pound (5.42 to 6.10 MYR/GBP).

On 21 July 2005, Central Bank of Malaysia announced the end of the peg to the US dollar immediately after China&#x27;s announcement of the end of the renminbi peg to the US dollar. According to Bank Negara, Malaysia allows the ringgit to operate in a managed float against several major currencies. This has resulted in the value of the ringgit rising closer to its perceived market value, although Central Bank of Malaysia has intervened in financial markets to maintain stability in the trading level of the ringgit, a task made easier by the fact that the ringgit was pegged and has remained non-tradeable outside Malaysia since 1998.

=== Post-US dollar currency peg performance (2005–present) ===
Following the end of the currency peg, the ringgit appreciated to as high as 3.16 MYR/USD in April 2008. The ringgit had also enjoyed a period of appreciation against the Hong Kong dollar (from 0.49 to 0.44 MYR/HKD) and the renminbi (0.46 to 0.45 MYR/CNY) as recently as May 2008. The initial stability of the ringgit in the late-2000s had led to considerations to reintroduce the currency to foreign trading after over a decade of being non-internationalised. In a CNBC interview in September 2010, Najib Tun Razak, the then Prime Minister and Finance Minister of Malaysia, was quoted in stating that the government was planning the reentry of the ringgit into off-shore trading if the move will help the economy, with the condition that rules and regulations were put in place to prevent abuses. Despite considerations, the ringgit has continued to remain non-internationalised in a deliberate move to continue discouraging off-shore trading of the currency.

Political uncertainty following the country&#x27;s 2008 general election and the 2008 Permatang Pauh by-election, falling crude oil prices in the late-2000s, and the lack of intervention by the Central Bank of Malaysia to increase already low interest rates (which remained at 3.5% between April 2006 and November 2008) led to a slight fall of the ringgit&#x27;s value against the US dollar between May and July 2008, followed by a sharper drop between August and September of the same year. As a result, the US dollar appreciated significantly to close at 3.43 MYR/USD as of 4 September 2008, while other major currencies, including the renminbi and Hong Kong dollar, followed suit. The ringgit spiked at 3.73 MYR/USD by March 2009, before gradually recovering to 3.00 MYR/USD by mid-2011 and normalising at around 3.10 MYR/USD between 2011 and 2014.

The ringgit experienced more acute plunges in the value since mid-2014 following the escalation of the 1Malaysia Development Berhad scandal that raised allegations of political channeling of billions of ringgit to off-shore accounts, and uncertainty from the 2015–16 Chinese stock market turbulence and the effects of the 2016 United States presidential election results. The currency&#x27;s value fell from an average of 3.20 MYR/USD in mid-2014 to around 3.70 MYR/USD by early 2015; with China being Malaysia&#x27;s largest trading partner, a Chinese stock market crash in June 2015 triggered another plunge in value for the ringgit, which reached levels unseen since 1998 at lows of 4.43 MYR/USD in September 2015, before stabilising around 4.10 to 4.20 to the US dollar soon after; the currency later plummeted and hover below the 1998 lows at 4.40 and 4.50 MYR/USD, following the wake of the victory of pro-protectionist Donald Trump in the 2016 United States presidential election, which has raised questions of the United States&#x27; participation in the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) (which Malaysia is a signatory of, and the United States had promptly pulled out from in January 2017) and Malaysia–United States trade as a whole (as the United States is among Malaysia&#x27;s largest trading partners).

In response to the sharp drop of the ringgit in November 2016, Central Bank of Malaysia began a series of tougher crackdowns on under-the-counter non-deliverable forward trading of the ringgit in order to curb currency speculation. Since then, the currency has seen a steady but consistent rate of appreciation against the US dollar, with significant increases since early-November 2017 following reports of positive economic performance, the restructuring of the TPP into the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership and increasing global oil prices. After appreciating as high as 3.86 to the US dollar as of early April 2018, the value dropped to around 4.18 MYR/USD by the end of October 2018 following increasing trade war tensions in response to the China–United States trade war, selloff panic from other emerging markets, as well as uncertainty in economic policy following an upset by the Pakatan Harapan coalition in the 2018 general election. With the exception of the Euro, the currency&#x27;s has also seen some recovery of value to pre-late 2016 levels against other major currencies, including the renminbi, British pound, Australian dollar, Japanese yen and Singaporean dollar, but remains less valuable overall than before the end of 2013.

== Coinage ==

=== First series (1967) ===
The first series of sen coins were introduced in 1967 in denominations of 1, 5, 10, 20 and 50 sen, followed by the introduction of the 1 ringgit coin (which used the $ symbol and is the largest coin in the series) in 1971. While varied by diameters, virtually all the coins were minted in near-consistent obverse and reverse designs and were very generic, with the obverse depicting the then recently completed Malaysian Houses of Parliament and the federal star and crescent moon from the canton of the Malaysian flag. All coins were minted from cupronickel, the only exception being the 1 sen coin, which was first composed from bronze between 1967 and 1972, then in steel clad with copper from 1973 onwards. The 50 sen coin is the only one in the series to undergo a redesign, a minor 1971 modification on its edge to include &quot;Bank Negara Malaysia&quot; letterings. All coins have the initials GC on the reverse, below the Parliament House. It stands for Geoffrey Colley, Malaysia first coin series&#x27; designer. The 1 ringgit coin was never popular at the time due to being in conflict with a banknote of equal face value, similar to the current situation regarding the 1 dollar coin of the United States dollar.

The coins of this first series were identical in size and composition to those of the former Malaya and British Borneo dollar. Though the Malayan currency union coins were withdrawn, they still appear in circulation on very rare occasions.

Minting of the first sen series ended in 1989, when the second series was introduced. The older coins remain legal tender as of 2019, but have steadily declined in number and are seldom seen in circulation in Malaysia.

=== Second series (1989) ===
The second series of sen coins entered circulation in late 1989, sporting completely redesigned obverses and reverses, but predominantly retaining the design of edges, diameters and composition of the previous series&#x27; coins previous to 1989, the 1 ringgit coin being the exception. Changes include the depiction of items of Malay culture on the obverse, such as a local mancala game board called congkak on the 10 sen and the wau bulan or &quot;moon kite&quot; on the 50 sen among other things, as well as the inclusion of a Hibiscus rosa-sinensis (Malay: &quot;Bunga Raya&quot;), the national flower of Malaysia, on the upper half of the reverse. The second series was designed by Low Yee Kheng.

In addition to changes on its obverse and reverse, the size of the 1 ringgit coin was also reduced from a diameter of 33 mm to 24 mm, and was minted from an alloy of copper, zinc and tin, as opposed to the first series&#x27; cupronickel. The $ symbol was brought over to the new coin, but was dropped in favour of &quot;RINGGIT&quot; for coins minted from 1993 onwards. On 7 December 2005, the 1 ringgit coin was demonetised and withdrawn from circulation. This was partly due to problems with standardisation (two different versions of the second series coin were minted) and forgery.

As of 1 April 2008, a rounding mechanism of prices to the nearest 5 sen, applied to the total bill only, is in force, which was first announced in 2007 by Central Bank of Malaysia, in an attempt to render the 1 sen coin irrelevant. Individual items and services can still be priced in multiples of 1 sen with the final totalled rounded to the nearest 5 sen. For example, purchasing two items priced RM4.88 and RM3.14, totalling RM8.02, would then be rounded to RM8.00. If each item had been individually rounded (to RM4.90 and RM3.15 respectively) the incorrect total would have been RM8.05. In practice, individual items will probably remain priced at so-called &quot;price points&quot; (or psychological pricing and odd-number pricing) ending in 98 and 99 to maximise rounding gains for the vendor, especially in the case of single item purchases. Existing 1 sen coins in circulation remain legal tender for payments up to RM2.00.

=== Third series (2012) ===

The third series of coins were announced on 25 July 2011, first being issued as commemorative coins to mark their release on 16 January 2012. The third series carry a theme named &quot;Distinctively Malaysia&quot; and are inspired from motifs of flora and fauna drawn from various cultures in Malaysia to &quot;reflect the diversity and richness of Malaysia&#x27;s national identity&quot;. The denominations issued are 5, 10, 20 and 50 sen. On 24 October 2011, Deputy Finance Minister Datuk Donald Lim named Poogsan Corporation of South Korea as the series&#x27; coin suppliers and the coins are minted at the Bank Negara Mint in Shah Alam.

According to Lim, costs in producing the coins will be reduced by 49% due to the change in metal composition. Other changes in the series include the diameter, the colour on the 20- and 50 sen coins (from silver to yellow) and a redesign on the obverse (featuring different motifs for each denomination), fourteen dots symbolising the thirteen states and the collective Federal Territories, and five horizontal lines indicating the five principles of Rukunegara.

The 50-cent coin is more distinctive than the other denominations. The round shape of the coin has nine indentations, forgoing the original &quot;BANK NEGARA MALAYSIA&quot; lettering. The obverse does not feature the five horizontal lines, but instead a latent image security feature is placed over the coin, where lettering of the denomination &quot;50&quot; and &quot;SEN&quot; can be seen when the coin is tilted slightly.

The 20 sen and 50 sen coins look similar to €0.10 and €0.20 coin in size, edge design and colour; however, they are only worth at €0.047 and €0.12 respectively.

=== Kijang Emas ===
Three denominations of gold bullion coins, the &quot;Kijang Emas&quot; (the kijang, a species of deer, being part of Central Bank of Malaysia&#x27;s logo) are also issued, at the face value of RM 50, RM 100 and RM 200, weighing oz, oz and 1 oz (Troy ounce), respectively. It is minted by the Kilang Wang Central Bank of Malaysia and was launched on 17 July 2001 by Central Bank of Malaysia, making Malaysia the twelfth country to issue its own gold bullion coins. Like other bullion coins issued around the world, the Kijang Emas is primarily used as an investment rather than in day-to-day circulation. The purchase and resale price of Kijang Emas is determined by the prevailing international gold market price. Current price of the Kijang Emas is rated at RM 8266 for 1oz, RM 4211 for oz and RM 2144 for oz (November 17, 2020).

== Banknotes ==

=== First series (1967) ===

Central Bank of Malaysia first issued Malaysian dollar banknotes on 6 June 1967 in $1, $5, $10, $50 and $100 denominations. The $1000 denomination was first issued on 2 September 1968. The first Malaysian banknotes carried the image of Tuanku Abdul Rahman, the first Yang di-Pertuan Agong of independent Malaya and bore the signature of Tun Ismail bin Mohamed Ali, the first Malaysian Governor of Central Bank of Malaysia. On 16 August 1972, Central Bank of Malaysia adopted official new spelling system of the national language, Bahasa Melayu, into the printing of its currency notes while retaining the designs. The banknotes with new spellings are circulated alongside the old banknotes.

=== Second series (1982-1984) ===
The second series was issued with the main theme being that of Malaysian traditional ornamental designs. Two new denominations, that of $20 and $500, was introduced in 1982; it was followed by redesigned banknotes for the $10, $50 and $100 denominations in 1983 before completing with redesigned $1, $5 &amp; $1000 notes in 1984. All banknotes of this series were printed by Thomas De La Rue. Until 2010, the second series notes was still occasionally encountered.

In 1986, the mark for the blind on the upper left hand corner was removed, and a security strip was added to all denominations except for the 1 ringgit.

Printing of $1 notes were discontinued in 1993 with the $1 coin replacing it.

Due to its unpopularity, the $20 (RM20) denominations were discontinued and gradually removed from circulation in 1995.

In 1999 the RM500 and RM1000 notes were discontinued and ceased to be legal tender. This was due because of the Asian monetary crisis of 1997 when huge amounts of ringgit were taken out of the country to be traded in these notes. In effect the notes were withdrawn out of circulation and the amount of ringgit taken out of the country in banknotes was limited to RM1000.

=== Third series (1996) ===

The third series was issued with designs in the spirit of Wawasan 2020 in 1996 in denominations of RM1, RM2, RM5, RM10, RM50 and RM100. The larger denomination RM50 and RM100 notes had an additional hologram strip to deter counterfeiters.

In 2004, Central Bank of Malaysia issued a new RM10 note with additional security features including the holographic strip previously only seen on the RM50 and RM100 notes. A new RM5 polymer banknote with a distinctive transparent window was also issued. Both new banknotes are almost identical to their original third series designs. At one time, Central Bank of Malaysia announced its intention to eventually phase out all paper notes and replace them with polymer notes.

=== Fourth series (2012) ===
In early 2008, the bank released a newly designed RM50 banknote, which according to the bank, were to enter general circulation beginning 30 January 2008. Earlier, 20,000 more such notes with special packaging were distributed by the bank on 26 December 2007.

The newly designed RM50 banknote retains the predominant colour of green-blue, but is designed in a new theme, dubbed the &quot;National Mission&quot;, expressing the notion of Malaysia &quot;[moving] the economy up the value chain&quot;, in accordance to Malaysia&#x27;s economic transformation to higher value-added activities in agriculture, manufacturing and services sectors of the economy. The dominant intaglio portrait of the first Yang di-Pertuan Agong, Tuanku Abdul Rahman, is retained on the right and the national flower, the hibiscus, is presented in the center on the obverse of the note. Design patterns from songket weaving, which are in the background and edges of the banknote, are featured to reflect the traditional Malay textile handicraft and embroidery.

The first 50 million pieces of the new RM50 banknote features Malaysia&#x27;s first Prime Minister, Tunku Abdul Rahman, at the historic declaration of Malaya&#x27;s independence, and the logo of the 50th Anniversary of Independence on the reverse. Security features on the banknote include a watermarked portrait of the Yang di-Pertuan Agong, a security thread, micro letterings, fluorescent elements visible only under ultraviolet light, a multi coloured latent image which changes colour when viewed at different angles, and a holographic stripe at the side of the note and an image that is visible only via a moiré effect to prevent counterfeiting using photocopiers. Circulation for the first edition of this new RM50 banknote was eventually curtailed by the Central Bank due to the various Malaysia banks&#x27; automatic teller machines inability to accept it. The bank began to re-release the new series for general circulation beginning 15 July 2009 without the 50th Anniversary logo. This edition include new enhanced security features such as two color number fluorescents and security fibres.

In May 2011, Central Bank of Malaysia had announced that they will introduce a new series of banknotes to replace the current design that has been in circulation for around 15 years. The most highlighted part of the announcement is the re-introduction of the RM20 note, which was not included in the third series. The design of the new notes was announced on 21 December 2011, and the notes are expected to be put into circulation in the second half of 2012. The new series banknotes are legal tender and will co-circulate with the existing series. The existing series will be gradually phased out. All 4 series of banknotes (except 500, and 1000) are technically still legal tender, but some vendors may not accept the first and second series banknotes (rarely seen now). All banknote denominations in the new series will retain the portrait of the first Yang di-Pertuan Agong, Tuanku Abdul Rahman. The banknotes are supplied by Crane AB of Sweden, Giesecke &amp; Devrient GmbH of Germany, Oberthur Technologies of France and Orell Fussli of Switzerland. They were put into circulation on 16 July 2012.

=== Commemorative banknotes ===
====1998 Commonwealth Games====
To commemorate the 1998 Commonwealth Games in Kuala Lumpur, a commemorative RM50 polymer banknote was issued on 1 June 1998. This was the first polymer banknote to be issued by Central Bank of Malaysia and was printed by Note Printing Australia (NPA). A total of 500,000 sets were issued. They were sold in special packaging and at a premium price of 80 ringgit. This note is hardly ever seen in normal usage, its use being a collector&#x27;s commemorative.

====50th Anniversary of Independence====
On 21 December 2007, Central Bank of Malaysia issued a commemorative 50 ringgit banknote to commemorate Malaysia&#x27;s 50th Anniversary of Independence. The design was that of the 50 ringgit banknote of the fourth series, except with the additional logo of the 50th Anniversary of Independence at the top right of the reverse side, and the inscription &quot;1957-2007&quot; also on the reverse side of the banknote. The regular 50 ringgit notes which were issued later from 2009 onward did not carry these additional design features

A total of 50 million banknotes which bore the commemorative design, with serial number letter prefixes from AA to AE, were issued. Subsequent regular banknotes had serial number prefixes from AF onward. Of the 50 million commemorative banknotes, the first 20,000 were sold with a special packaging at a premium price of 60 ringgit.

====60th Anniversary of the Signing of the Federation of Malaya Independence Agreement====
On 14 December 2017, Central Bank of Malaysia announced the issue of two paper-polymer hybrid commemorative banknotes in conjunction with the sixtieth anniversary of the Signing of the Federation of Malaya Independence Agreement. The banknotes were in the denominations of 60 ringgit and 600 ringgit. The 60 ringgit note was also made available in a 3-in-1 format.

The 600 ringgit note is the largest legal tender banknote in terms of size to be issued in the world, measuring 370mm by 220mm.

The notes were released for sale online on 29 December 2017 at a premium, with the 60 ringgit note sold at 120 ringgit, the 3-in-1 60 ringgit note at 500 ringgit and the 600 ringgit note at 1,700 ringgit.

<text>Deutsche Bank Center (also known as One Columbus Circle and formerly Time Warner Center) is a mixed-use building on Columbus Circle in Manhattan, New York City, United States. The building occupies the western side of Columbus Circle and straddles the border between Hell&#x27;s Kitchen and the Upper West Side. It was developed by The Related Companies and Apollo Global Management, and designed by David Childs and Mustafa Kemal Abadan of Skidmore, Owings &amp; Merrill.

Deutsche Bank Center features twin towers, connected by a multi-story atrium. The building has a total floor area of . It contains office space, residential condominiums, the Mandarin Oriental, New York hotel, and the Jazz at Lincoln Center entertainment venue. The Shops at Columbus Circle shopping mall is placed at the base of the building, with a large Whole Foods Market grocery store on the lower level.

The building was built on the site of the New York Coliseum, formerly New York City&#x27;s main convention center. Plans for the project, then known as Columbus Center, were approved in 1998. Construction began in November 2000 and a topping-out ceremony was held in 2003; the project was known as AOL Time Warner Center during construction, but the &quot;AOL&quot; name was dropped before opening. Time Warner Center officially opened on February 5, 2004. Deutsche Bank replaced WarnerMedia as the anchor tenant of the office area in May 2021 and it was renamed Deutsche Bank Center.

== Site ==
The center is on the west side of Columbus Circle, on the border of Hell&#x27;s Kitchen and the Upper West Side, in Manhattan, New York City, United States. It occupies an irregular plot of land bounded by 60th Street to the north, the Coliseum Park apartment complex to the west, and 58th Street to the south. The eastern boundary consists of Eighth Avenue, Columbus Circle, and Broadway from south to north. The land lot covers , with a frontage of on Columbus Circle and a depth of . Deutsche Bank Center&#x27;s primary address is 1 Columbus Circle. The building also uses the addresses 25 Columbus Circle for its south tower and 80 Columbus Circle for the north tower.

The building is near Trump International Hotel and Tower to the northeast, Central Park to the east, 2 Columbus Circle and 240 Central Park South to the southeast, and Central Park Place to the south. Entrances to the New York City Subway&#x27;s 59th Street–Columbus Circle station, served by the , are directly outside the building. As part of the construction of what was then Time Warner Center, the existing subway staircase was refurbished and an elevator was added to the subway entrance. Because the building did not include a zoning bonus, the developers did not need to fund a renovation of the subway station, as Hearst Communications was obligated to do when it built Hearst Tower one block south.

Deutsche Bank Center occupies the site of the New York Coliseum, which itself replaced two city blocks bounded by Columbus Circle, 60th Street, Ninth Avenue, and 58th Street. The Coliseum opened in 1956 as New York City&#x27;s main convention center, being superseded by the Javits Center in the 1980s. Around the same time, the area around Columbus Circle was being redeveloped, in part because of the Coliseum&#x27;s success. This prompted the Coliseum&#x27;s owner, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA), to place the building up for sale in 1985. An agreement on the site&#x27;s redevelopment was not finalized until 1998, and designs for the Coliseum replacement itself were not in place until 1999. This was in part due to disagreements over the site, as well as a weak economy in the late 1980s and early 1990s.

==Architecture==

Deutsche Bank Center was designed by David Childs of Skidmore, Owings &amp; Merrill (SOM), working with T. J. Gottesdiener and Mustafa K. Abadan of the same firm. Specific portions of the interior were designed by different architects. AOL Time Warner, Apollo Global Management, Mandarin Oriental Hotel Group, Palladium Company, and the Related Companies were the developers. Stephen M. Ross, CEO of the Related Companies, said that SOM had been selected since they &quot;create great architecture but also speak the language of business&quot;. Bovis Lend Lease was the construction manager for much of the interior, including mechanical systems. Another 80 to 100 subcontractors were also hired for different parts of construction.

Deutsche Bank Center includes towers to the north and south, joined at the base. The building is split into eight different ownership units: the basement parking garage, the Shops at Columbus Circle mall, Jazz at Lincoln Center&#x27;s facilities, the original AOL Time Warner office space, the six other office stories, the condominium units in the north and south towers, and the Mandarin Oriental New York hotel. The building has about of interior space in total. About of mechanical and underground space is not counted under zoning law. This gives a gross floor area of , which is close to the maximum area allowed under a floor area ratio of 15. Deutsche Bank Center uses a total of of glass, as well as of steel and of concrete.

=== Form and facade ===
The base of Deutsche Bank Center measures wide, as measured from north to south, by deep. The building is designed to face Central Park, with a general trapezoidal shape. Two towers with a parallelogram-shaped massing rise from the base. The towers are aligned with Broadway, which runs diagonally relative to the Manhattan street grid, while the base is aligned with the street grid. The space between the towers is on axis with 59th Street and Central Park South. The western and eastern facades of both towers are aligned 30 degrees counterclockwise from the axis of Eighth Avenue and Central Park West. Both towers are 55 stories tall with a roof height of . The pinnacle of each tower consists of a lantern measuring tall.

The base of Deutsche Bank Center contains a limestone facade with large window openings, which taper off into glass bands. The facade of the upper stories is clad with glass. There are small, projecting glass fins every , which, from an angle, give the facade the appearance of a myriad of small shards. The glass panes were initially specified to be thick, but the architects changed the specification during construction to to stiffen the panes. The architects had originally intended for the glass to be light gray, but a darker shade was later specified. Atop the towers are glass parapets that absorb natural lights.

A multistory cable structure, facing 59th Street across Columbus Circle, serves as the entrance to an atrium between the building&#x27;s twin towers. The structure consists of a grid of stainless-steel cables apart vertically and apart horizontally. Laminated-glass panels measuring thick are placed within the cables. Measuring across and high, the cable structure was the largest in North America at the time of its completion. It was designed by James Carpenter Design Associates. According to Carpenter, the cable grid was intended &quot;to be as delicate, transparent and diaphanous as possible&quot; to allow simultaneous views into and out of the atrium. Abby Bussel, author of a book about SOM, wrote that the main entrance was intended to &quot;project a civic face to the community&quot; at night.

The southeast corner of the building, at Eighth Avenue and 58th Street, contains a triangular wedge-shaped glass structure measuring about tall. For the first months of the complex&#x27;s existence, the glass structure was empty. As part of an agreement with the New York City government, the structure could not include advertising. &quot;Prow Sculpture&quot;, an art installation by David Rome, was then installed in the structure by 2004. This consists of 12 sets of 36 translucent panels, each supported by vertical trusses. The panels each contain light-emitting diodes that change color once every few minutes. The panels also change color to display the time at 15-minute intervals. The lights can be illuminated in different colors to mark special occasions. The artwork requires 200 tons of air conditioning (equivalent to ), as well as frequent cleaning.

=== Lower stories ===
The base of the building contains a steel superstructure with the Shops at Columbus Circle, Jazz at Lincoln Center, broadcast studios, and originally AOL Time Warner&#x27;s headquarters. The towers&#x27; concrete superstructures rest above the base. Structurally, the building&#x27;s base also includes the steel-framed lower sections of both towers. The steel frame extends high below the north tower and high below the south tower. The steel superstructure allowed the architects to use several column arrangements to accommodate the differing needs of each tenant, and it allowed the architects to create large, column-free spaces for hotel ballrooms, broadcast studios, and offices. Twenty-four entrances were originally provided at the base. To avoid interfering with the entrances and other open spaces, the building uses diagonal steel columns; concrete columns with stepped notches; and columns hanging from trusses.

The property&#x27;s foundation is surrounded by a concrete cofferdam measuring deep and across. The building plans were technically an &quot;alteration&quot; to the New York Coliseum, since the building incorporates the Coliseum&#x27;s underground parking garage. The parking garage, originally leased to the Central Parking Corporation, has 504 spots. The garage spans three stories and has sensors to monitor how many vehicles are parked in the garage. The garage also has a valet parking service. At ground level, the lobby for the south tower&#x27;s residences is on 58th Street while the north tower&#x27;s hotel and condominium lobby is on 59th Street. In addition, there are office lobbies on both 58th and 59th Streets; that on 58th Street originally served the Time Warner lobby.

==== Mall ====
Deutsche Bank Center has a four-story retail mall, the Shops at Columbus Circle, which opened in 2004 along with the rest of the complex. Designed by Elkus Manfredi Architects, it was known during planning as the Palladium. The mall&#x27;s ground-floor tenants include designer shops and restaurants. Among the first retail tenants in the mall were a Whole Foods Market, as well as an Equinox gym, both in the basement. The third and fourth stories contain the Restaurant Collection, with two Michelin 3-star restaurants (Masa and Per Se), as well as other eateries such as Porter House New York and Bad Roman.

The mall is designed to follow the curve of Columbus Circle, measuring long. It contains an atrium high, leading west from Columbus Circle. This atrium, known as the &quot;Great Room&quot;, is about wide and long with . A passageway, extending north and south from the atrium, covers .

==== Jazz at Lincoln Center ====

Within the base of Deutsche Bank Center is Frederick P. Rose Hall, a complex for Jazz at Lincoln Center, designed by Rafael Viñoly. It was proposed with two auditoriums, two rehearsal studios, a cafe, and a classroom. It consists of three venues. The Rose Theater, on the fifth floor, is the primary venue for Jazz at Lincoln Center, with 1,100 to 1,300 seats. The Appel Room, originally the Allen Room, is above the atrium with a large glass wall facing Columbus Circle, with space for up to 600 seats. Dizzy&#x27;s Club is named after trumpeter Dizzy Gillespie and contains 140 seats. Jazz at Lincoln Center&#x27;s space at Rose Hall also includes the Ertegun Atrium, facing Central Park, as well as the Nesuhi Ertegun Jazz Hall of Fame.
Rose Theater is acoustically separated from the rest of Deutsche Bank Center. The auditorium, weighing , is supported by 26 insulating gaskets on concrete footings. The gaskets consist of steel plates measuring thick, between which are neoprene synthetic-rubber pads. There are also neoprene pads, measuring thick, on the wall of the auditorium. Steven H. Sommer of Bovid Lend Lease, the hall&#x27;s construction manager, compared the layout to &quot;a small cardboard box in a larger cardboard box packed with Styrofoam peanuts&quot;.

In 2005, Jazz at Lincoln Center announced a partnership with XM Satellite Radio, which gave XM studio space at Rose Hall to broadcast both daily jazz programming and special events. Anderson Cooper&#x27;s daytime talk show, &quot;Anderson,&quot; recorded in Jazz at Lincoln Center&#x27;s Allen Room from 2011 to 2012.

==== Studios ====
The eighth floor of the north tower has studios originally designed for Time Warner&#x27;s subsidiary CNN. The studios were designed by Kostow Greenwood Architects, with scenic design by Production Design Group. The CNN studios covered or on five full stories and portions of two others. The spaces covered floors four through nine. The complex consisted of three large &quot;black box&quot; studios, three smaller studios, two newsrooms, and four control rooms. The black-box studios overlooked the park, as did one of the newsrooms, designed for financial news subsidiary CNNfn.

The wide studio spaces required the columns to be spaced apart. To accommodate large overhead lights, SOM omitted alternating floor slabs so CNN&#x27;s studios contained a floor-to-ceiling height of . The studio floors were flattened to prevent camera equipment from vibrating, and thick insulating pads were placed under the floors. In addition, double walls were placed in each studio: an inner wall connecting to the studio floor and an outer wall connected to the rest of the building. Observation windows were placed near the top of the studio walls. The studios had their own power and backup control systems. A dedicated freight elevator was also installed so large props and pieces of sets could be carried into and out of the studios.

The CNNfn newsroom was designed so cameras could pan over the width of the room. Materials such as vinyl partitions and striped carpet tiles were selected according to how they looked on digital cameras. A feature of the CNNfn newsroom was double-tiered wooden oval desks, often shown in wide shots of the newsroom; the desks themselves were arranged in a curve. Kostow Greenwood redesigned the offices for CNNfn, later CNNMoney, in 2013. Among the changes were the addition of office modules along the walls of some of the 27-foot-tall spaces. CNN&#x27;s studios in Time Warner Center operated until the network relocated to 30 Hudson Yards in 2019.

==== Offices ====
At the building&#x27;s completion, it had a total office area of approximately . About was used as the headquarters for Time Warner. Time Warner&#x27;s offices were designed by HLW International, though Perkins and Will oversaw the final fit-out of the office spaces. The Time Warner offices originally accommodated 1,600 employees on 17 floors in the building&#x27;s southern section. Time Warner&#x27;s former spaces are spanned by beams. Ten stories were designed as corporate offices in conjunction with Mancini Duffy; the corporate offices contained wooden millwork, as well as gray-and-gold finishes on the walls and carpets. Meeting rooms had curved walls with encaustic finishes and brightly colored accents. Floor spaces were arranged in a modular format, with three offices or four workstations to a module, and meeting areas and copying rooms were placed in uniform positions throughout each floors. According to Mancini Duffy&#x27;s director of design, &quot;mullions, frames, reveals, and the use of painted drywall, glass, and millwork&quot; served to enhance the design of the office corridors.

There were originally of offices not used by AOL Time Warner. The non-Time Warner offices covered six stories. Half of this space was initially occupied by Apollo and Related, two of the developers, after they had difficulty marketing the space; the other half was purchased by Time Warner. , almost all of the building&#x27;s office space, including both the Time Warner office space and the other space, is occupied by Deutsche Bank.

=== Upper stories ===
The apartments and hotel rooms on the upper floors have a concrete superstructure, since they did not need the large column spacing or small columns that a steel superstructure would provide. The concrete superstructures weigh each. There is a truss at the 17th floor of the north tower, above the ground, and at the 23rd floor of the south tower, above the ground. The trusses distribute the weight of the concrete above to the steel columns below; they also contain ducts, elevator rooms, and hallways between the emergency stairwells of the towers and the base. Each tower also has a concrete core measuring across, which extends to the layer of Manhattan schist below the building. The cores are up to thick at the base.

==== Hotel ====
The north tower contains the Mandarin Oriental New York hotel, designed by Brennan Beer Gorman. The hotel contains 248 units in total, composed of 202 guestrooms and 46 suites. The Mandarin Oriental New York spans floors 35 through 54, taking up in Deutsche Bank Center. The hotel in general is designed in an Art Deco-inspired Asian contemporary style. The interior decorations were mostly created by Hirsch Bedner Associates, except for the Asiate restaurant, which was designed by Tony Chi. , Reliance Industries owns a majority stake in the hotel.

The only entrance to the hotel is from 60th Street, where there are elevators to the hotel lobby. The ground-floor vestibule, designed as an ellipse, contains a glass chandelier by Dale Chihuly. Floor 35 contains the hotel lobby, the Asiate restaurant, and the MObar lounge. Also in the hotel is a two-story, spa. There is also a fitness center with a lap pool overlooking Central Park, as well as banquet rooms and ballrooms. Each of the guest rooms has a different set of decorations with Asian artwork and complex color schemes, as well as full-height windows. The layouts of the different hotel suites also vary.

==== Residences ====
Both towers contain residences, though they begin 24 stories above ground in the south tower and 37 stories above ground in the north tower. The north-tower residences are marketed as the Residences at Mandarin Oriental, while the south-tower residences are marketed as One Central Park, despite the fact that there is no street named Central Park. There are 66 residences in the north tower, occupying sixteen stories. The residents of the north tower are given access to the Mandarin Oriental New York&#x27;s amenities, being treated as if they were permanent guests of the hotel. These include spa and health club access as well as room service. The south tower has 133 or 134 residences, occupying twenty-nine stories. The condominiums have multiple entrances, including through the hotel, garage, and mall.

Ismael Leyva Architects designed the One Central Park residences, with furnishings by Thad Hayes. Leyva&#x27;s furnishings include granite floors and counters, as well as marble tiles and appliances. The residential condominiums all have ceilings measuring high, with full-height windows providing views of the Hudson River to the west. Four different floor plans are used in the towers, and the spaces are spanned by beams.

The top stories of each tower are marketed as floor 80, though this story is actually the 53rd-story penthouse. The tops of each tower are designed with five full-story penthouse condominiums, measuring and spanning a full floor. Unlike the other residences, the penthouses were originally offered as unfurnished spaces. Related Companies CEO Stephen Ross had occupied one of the full-story penthouses in the south tower until he sold it in 2023.

=== Mechanical features ===
Deutsche Bank Center includes a system of four emergency diesel generators for the residential tenants, each capable of . The base is powered by two diesel generators, also capable of . There is also a uninterruptible power system that runs at all times. The backup generation system powers three elevators, as well as lighting in each hallway and apartment intercoms, in case of emergencies. Two service rooms were installed by Zwicker Electric. The heating, ventilation, and air conditioning system was automated, increasing its efficiency by 10 to 15 percent.

As part of the construction of Time Warner Center, its developers spent $21 million on technological advances. From the building&#x27;s opening, the entirety of Time Warner Center was equipped with Wi-Fi, which at the time was still relatively uncommon in New York City buildings. A direct Ethernet connection was also included in the building when it was built, and each residence had an in-house internet phone service. In addition, residents received a notebook computer that served as their &quot;digital concierge&quot;, where they could look up the building&#x27;s restaurants, stores, and entertainment areas. The security screening systems at the elevators contained fingerprint readers. While the Wi-Fi services were available to visitors for a fee, the other tech services were only offered to residents and Mandarin Oriental hotel guests. Time Warner provided internet service for its own office space, but the residences and hotel rooms were served by RCN&#x27;s network instead, because RCN service was less expensive than Time Warner service.

== History ==

=== Planning ===

After putting the Coliseum up for sale in 1985, the MTA received numerous bids for the redevelopment of the site. Mortimer Zuckerman&#x27;s Boston Properties won the bidding contest, with plans to erect a headquarters for Salomon Brothers on the site, to be designed by Moshe Safdie. The community heavily opposed Zuckerman&#x27;s initial plan, and the sale was nullified in 1987, with Salomon Brothers withdrawing from the project.

==== Competing plans ====
New York City and Boston Properties first hired David Childs in 1987 to design the Coliseum replacement, to be known as Columbus Center. Childs&#x27;s initial plan, released in June 1988, called for a set of brick-and-glass towers rising as high as . Similar to what would ultimately be built, the complex would have been composed of twin towers. Childs&#x27;s plan faced heavy opposition from the community, leading to a redesign of the project. His second proposal was published in April 1988, with a twin-towered complex rising , as well as a pedestrian bridge connecting the two towers. This plan, too, faced political opposition and lawsuits. Following the prolonged delays, Zuckerman and the MTA severed negotiations for the site in 1994. Related CEO Stephen Ross had proposed converting the Coliseum into a Kmart store, though nothing came of that plan. As a result, Ross contacted his friend, Kenneth A. Himmel, to devise a proposal for the site.

Planning for Columbus Center restarted in May 1996, with the MTA outlining several criteria for the shape of the proposed development, as well as a stipulation that the winner could not seek tax breaks. The city and MTA received nine proposals for the site that November. The Municipal Art Society displayed models of these proposals to gauge public opinion for the project. By May 1997, the city and MTA had selected five finalists: Related Companies, Trump Organization, Tishman Speyer, Bruce C. Ratner &amp; Daniel Brodsky, and Millennium Partners. New York state officials tentatively considered selecting Millennium Partners&#x27; bid that July, to be designed by James Polshek. To the surprise of the developers submitting the bids, New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani announced he would revoke a tax break that he had promised to give to the winning bidder. Giuliani also threatened to block any potential sale of the Coliseum unless the project contained a theater of 1,000 to 2,000 seats for Lincoln Center. The mayor&#x27;s demand for a theater had hitherto been unknown to the public, but Lincoln Center executives expressed interest in the proposal.

In February 1998, the city and state agreed that the new building would have a 1,100-seat concert hall for Jazz at Lincoln Center, as well as rehearsal rooms and educational spaces. The facility would cost $40 to $45 million, of which Jazz at Lincoln Center would raise $20 million and the city would raise $18 million. The developers were asked to resubmit their bids. That April, Time Warner partnered with the Related Companies, with plans to move CNN&#x27;s New York City offices and NY1 broadcast studios to the development if Related&#x27;s bid was successful. Ross and Himmel had convinced Time Warner CEO Richard D. Parsons the previous year to join the project. The joint bid was $45 million less than the high bid offered by Trump, though government officials preferred Millennium&#x27;s and Related&#x27;s twin-tower plans to Trump&#x27;s single slab. Nevertheless, city officials were mainly considering Millennium&#x27;s and Related&#x27;s bids by June 1998. Millennium had proposed two luxury hotels and 450 residential condominiums, while the city government backed Related&#x27;s bid because of Time Warner&#x27;s involvement. By then, Childs, who had designed Related&#x27;s proposal, had designed five separate plans for the site.

==== Plan selection and finalization ====

The city selected Time Warner and Related&#x27;s $345 million bid in late July 1998. Childs was again hired to design the building, which would contain 425 hotel rooms, 375 condos, an auditorium for Jazz at Lincoln Center, and a 12-screen movie theater. There would also be a shopping mall, office space for Time Warner&#x27;s headquarters, and studio space for CNN and NY1. The proposal called for a pair of towers, separated by an atrium aligned with the axis of 59th Street. Unlike in earlier plans, the towers were only 55 stories tall, had a glass facade, and ran along the circumference of Columbus Circle, with the towers&#x27; sides running parallel to Broadway&#x27;s diagonal route through the circle. Apollo Global Management, which would issue financial capital for the development, was to be a co-owner alongside Related. The Palladium Company, jointly owned by Himmel and Related, would operate the retail space at the building. The developers likened the planned development to Rockefeller Center.

The MTA quickly approved the plans for the site. The Coliseum was demolished starting in September 1999 with the removal of plaques that had hung on the Coliseum&#x27;s facade. While the Coliseum&#x27;s demolition was ongoing, the Columbus Center project was still undergoing design changes. As late as February 2000, when the Coliseum&#x27;s interior had been demolished, SOM, Related, and the city were still negotiating over details such as how much stone the facade should have. There were also disagreements over the distance between the building&#x27;s twin towers, which was originally only , as well as the extent to which the Jazz at Lincoln Center performance space should be recessed from Columbus Circle. By the time the Coliseum&#x27;s exterior was demolished in June 2000, the structural steel had already been ordered. By then, even Childs had become exasperated with the delays, and the developers were ready to construct the building based on the interim plans, with which none of the involved parties were satisfied. Childs, working with T. J. Gottesdiener and Mustafa K. Abadan, proposed a pair of glass-clad parallelograms, which officials approved.

Childs announced his revised scheme at the end of June 2000. The building would be called the AOL Time Warner Center, in advance of the merger between AOL and Time Warner. The building was planned to be about , including mechanical space. The same month, General Motors Acceptance Corporation (GMAC) agreed to provide $1.3 billion for the building&#x27;s construction, believed to be the largest construction financing ever for a real estate development in New York City at the time. GMAC&#x27;s financing came with a $1.1 billion senior loan and $200 million in mezzanine financing. The remainder of the $1.7 billion development cost would come from equity of Apollo, Related, AOL Time Warner, and the Mandarin Oriental Hotel Group. Including furnishings, the building was expected to cost $2.2 billion. Time Warner had paid $150 million upfront for the right to occupy the development. City officials had indicated that Time Warner would receive a large tax abatement for the project, but the New York City Department of Finance ruled in 2001 that the project was ineligible for such incentives under the 1996 request for proposals. Further tweaks were made to the design, including reducing the hotel from 400 to 251 rooms to allow for the construction of office space.

=== Construction ===

==== 2000 and 2001 ====
A groundbreaking ceremony for the building occurred on November 14, 2000. At the time, the project was planned to employ 2,300 workers. Bovis Lend Lease was hired as general contractor based on a guaranteed maximum price at-risk contract, while Insignia/ESG was hired as the leasing agent for AOL Time Warner Center. By early 2001, the first large retail tenant had leased space in the building&#x27;s mall, and the developers were interviewing restaurateurs to operate six eateries in the mall. That June, Central Parking was hired to run the three-story parking garage in the complex&#x27;s basement. The condominiums went on sale in August 2001. Ross was planning to market some of the higher-story condominiums at between , which would make these apartments the most expensive in New York City by far. The condos ranged from $1.8 million for a two-bedroom unit to $35 million for a penthouse unit.

Plans for the 12-screen movie theater in Related&#x27;s winning bid were scrapped by 2001. By mid-2001, the building had grown to about , drawing the consternation of neighborhood groups who opposed the project. One such group, the Committee for Environmentally Sound Development, stated that AOL Time Warner Center was 33 percent larger than what was approved in an environmental impact statement in 1997. Other opponents, like City Councilwoman Ronnie Eldridge, wished to know why construction plans for the center had been filed as an alteration to the Coliseum, rather than as a new building. The Committee for Environmentally Sound Development filed a lawsuit against the project. While a New York Supreme Court judge ruled against the group in December 2001, the judge noted that a government agency still had to ensure AOL Time Warner Center did not exceed its maximum size.

Following the September 11 attacks on the World Trade Center in Lower Manhattan later in 2001, work on AOL Time Warner Center was slowed during the rescue and recovery effort, as many skilled workers had left the job to help with the rescue effort at the World Trade Center site. Additionally, since many roads into Manhattan were closed after the attacks, concrete deliveries were delayed, prompting concerns that the building&#x27;s construction would also be held up. Despite the attacks, the Time Warner complex had reached 19 stories by the end of 2001. Even though a few prospective buyers had withdrawn, forty apartments had sold for a cumulative $200 million between September and December 2001. These included Sandie N. Tillotson, who bought the top floor of the north tower for $30 million shortly after the attacks, then a record for a condominium. Five retailers also leased space in the months after the attacks. To address security concerns, the architects strengthened AOL Time Warner Center&#x27;s security features at entrances to garages and loading docks. The architects also increased the strength of the steel and added backup generators for the elevators.

==== 2002 and 2003 ====
By early 2002, a thousand workers were employed in the construction of the superstructure. Several officials, including mayor Michael Bloomberg, signed a steel beam that February to mark the topping-out of the lower floors&#x27; steel superstructure. A speech was given to honor workers who helped with the September 11 recovery effort. By then, sixty of the residential units had been sold. The Related Companies did not reduce its apartment prices, even as the attacks resulted in a decline in condominium sales citywide. Eighty percent of the retail space had been leased by mid-2002, as was forty percent of the residential units. At the time, AOL Time Warner&#x27;s stock value was declining, and the company reportedly planned to sublease some space, which executives believed the company could not fully occupy. &quot;New York&quot; magazine compared AOL Time Warner Center to a situation where &quot;your marriage is a wreck, you hate each other, everybody thinks you should get divorced, and yet you’re still building a lavish new home together.&quot;

During construction, Bovis Lend Lease received several notices of minor construction violations from the New York City Department of Buildings. During a heavy windstorm in September 2002, a piece of debris flew off the construction site, injuring a carpenter and two passersby. The carpenter ultimately died of his injuries, and a forklift driver was also killed on the eighth floor that year. In October 2002, California pension fund CalPERS and MacFarlane Partners offered to buy a half-ownership stake in the retail space, the office space not occupied by AOL Time Warner, and the center&#x27;s parking structure. The sale to CalPERS and MacFarlane was finalized in February 2003, with the partners receiving a 49.5 percent stake; the stake was estimated at $500 million. That year, the Department of Finance valued AOL Time Warner Center at $820 million, a 275 percent increase from the previous year&#x27;s valuation of $220 million. The construction process continued to experience difficulties; in April 2003, a fire damaged the fourth through seventh stories, including part of Jazz at Lincoln Center&#x27;s future space. There were also thirty-nine open construction violations by late 2003, when around sixty percent of the condos had been sold.

AOL Time Warner, facing further financial setbacks, was compelled to reduce some costs at the new headquarters, including canceling plans for a technology lab. By September 2003, the company had voted to rebrand itself as Time Warner, with the building to be known simply as &quot;Time Warner Center&quot;. Despite Time Warner&#x27;s problems, in the two years after the September 11 attacks, residential prices at Time Warner Center were increased five times. &quot;Architectural Digest&quot; hired twenty-three developers to decorate one room each on floor 73, then held a fundraiser in these rooms in October 2003. The rooms were decorated for free and were left in place for six months so the remaining 77 apartments could be sold. Though most of the office space was to be occupied by Time Warner, there was no interest in the remaining office space. This led Apollo Real Estate and the Related Companies to occupy half of the vacant space, with Time Warner buying the rest for its subsidiaries. The difficulty in leasing the space was in part because the developers felt the offices were best suited for media outlets that would compete with Time Warner.

=== Time Warner use ===
Time Warner Center was the first major building to be developed in Manhattan after the September 11 attacks, and its development had directly resulted in an increase in nearby land values even before its completion. AOL Time Warner sought four companies to sponsor the new building, one each in the electronics, technology, automotive, and financial-services segments; the sponsors would have retail or exhibit space in the building. The first sponsor, electronics company Samsung, signed an agreement in mid-2003. Lincoln Motor Company was the automotive sponsor, while First Republic Bank was the financial-services sponsor. At the end of 2003, Credit Suisse First Boston provided $620 million to refinance part of the development&#x27;s construction loan.

====Opening====

The development was opened in phases starting in 2003. The first part of Time Warner Center to officially open was the Mandarin Oriental New York, which opened on November 15, 2003, although a formal ceremony was held in December 2003. Time Warner Center&#x27;s formal opening ceremony was held on February 5, 2004, with a benefit party being hosted upon the completion of the Shops at Columbus Circle. At the time of the mall&#x27;s opening, over four-fifths of the 40 stores and 10 restaurants were open. There were concerns among retail-industry experts that Time Warner Center&#x27;s &quot;vertical mall&quot; concept would not be successful since high-rise malls in New York City had historically not been successful.

Final touches were still being placed on the building when, in April 2004, a piece of metal sheeting fell off the facade. This prompted Bloomberg to order that all work on the building be temporarily halted, since this was the fourth time since 2002 that debris had fallen from the building. The retail complex also faced challenges, such as an early 2004 fire in the Per Se restaurant, the first to open in the mall. Jazz at Lincoln Center opened in October 2004, almost a year after the rest of the complex had been completed. In total, the project had cost $1.8 billion.

==== Operation ====
The Sunshine Group was in charge of marketing the building. Businessman David Martínez bought one penthouse unit and a portion of another; at $40 to $45 million, the unit was the most expensive residence recorded in Manhattan at the time. Other early residents included designer Lady Henrietta Spencer-Churchill and musician Ricky Martin, as well as architect Jon Stryker, who used Time Warner Center as a temporary apartment because he did not want to rent a residence. The south tower&#x27;s residents also included Saudi royal Turki bin Faisal Al Saud, art collector Tobias Meyer, producer Verna Harrah, and businessmen Gregory Olsen and John Kluge. Those of the north tower included ten doctors; businessmen Alan B. Miller, Michael Spencer, and Gerard Cafesjian; and two daughters of Turkish businessman Sakıp Sabancı. By late 2004, the apartments were about 85 percent sold. About a quarter of the original buyers were foreign buyers, and a third of the total buyers used shell corporations to obscure their identities.

Within a year and a half of Time Warner Center&#x27;s opening, the hotel and some of the shopping mall&#x27;s retail spaces were relatively successful. However, several restaurateurs had already closed their operations in the building or were in the process of doing so. The property had the highest-listed market value in New York City, $1.1 billion, in 2006. The building&#x27;s last condominium was sold that March. By that time, a monthly parking pass alone ran from $550 to $600, more expensive than a one-bedroom residence in several Southern and Midwestern U.S. cities. Time Warner Center had become a popular destination by 2008; its presence had helped raise the value of surrounding properties by as much as 400 percent since 2004. Average condominium prices had risen 127 percent since the building&#x27;s opening, with condos being listed at between $7 and $60 million.

Following the completion of the nearby 15 Central Park West in the late 2000s, condo prices at Time Warner Center began to decline. One unit in Time Warner Center was listed on the market in 2007 and was not sold for more than a decade. In 2013, Time Warner announced its intention to move most of its offices to 30 Hudson Yards on the west side of Manhattan. The following January, Time Warner sold its stake in the Columbus Circle building for $1.3 billion to the Related Companies, the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, and GIC Private Limited. The companies funded the purchase of the office space with a five-year, $675 million mortgage from Deutsche Bank and Bank of China.

By the 2010s, the residential apartments of Time Warner Center were acquired by a large number of extremely wealthy residents. In 2015, &quot;The New York Times&quot; found that Time Warner Center&#x27;s condominium owners had included seventeen people on &quot;Forbes&quot; magazine&#x27;s &quot;The World&#x27;s Billionaires&quot; list, as well as five major art collectors, eight chief executives, and celebrities such as singer Jimmy Buffett, football player Tom Brady, and talk show host Kelly Ripa. The vast majority of condominiums, about eighty percent, had been purchased by shell companies by 2014, with some of the tenants being involved in controversy. These included Vitaly Malkin, a Russian senator accused of ties to organized crime; Wang Wenliang, a Chinese businessman whose company was accused of dangerous construction conditions; and Anil Agarwal, an Indian businessman whose mining company had been charged with pollution in India and Zambia. The controversy in part influenced the United States Department of the Treasury to regulate large all-cash property sales in Manhattan starting in 2016.

===Deutsche Bank use===
In May 2018, Deutsche Bank announced it would lease all of office space for 25 years, relocating from 60 Wall Street beginning in the third quarter of 2021. The move represented a reduction in space for the bank, which had occupied at 60 Wall Street. Following the news, Related Companies announced that the building would be officially renamed &quot;Deutsche Bank Center&quot; upon the company&#x27;s arrival. In May 2019, Related refinanced the office portion of the development with a $1.1 billion loan from Wells Fargo. After announcing plans to drastically reduce its overseas activities in mid-2019, Deutsche Bank returned two of the floors, covering , to the Related Companies. Meanwhile, the CNN studios had relocated to Hudson Yards by late 2019.

Between March 2020 and April 2021, the Mandarin Oriental hotel in Time Warner Center was closed due to the COVID-19 pandemic in New York City, undergoing a minor renovation during that time. Time Warner Center was renamed to Deutsche Bank Center in May 2021, with Time Warner signage being replaced with that of Deutsche Bank over a one-week period. The bank was scheduled to relocate 5,000 employees to the building, but the relocation was delayed. The bank&#x27;s employees were being relocated by July 2021.

== Critical reception ==

When the original design was announced in July 1998, Herbert Muschamp wrote for &quot;The New York Times&quot; that the glass facade was a &quot;major improvement&quot; compared to Childs&#x27;s earlier proposals of the late 1980s, but he believed that the design was &quot;skillful, earnest and devoid of meaning&quot;. At the end of the year, Muschamp was even more negative, characterizing the building as an example of &quot;architecture of denial&quot; and derided it as indicating &quot;an utter lack of awareness that New York today differs dramatically from the city in the 1930&#x27;s&quot;. Peter Blake, editor of &quot;Architectural Record&quot;, wrote of the project in late 1998: &quot;Manhattan is about to have a building of singular klutziness imposed upon it.&quot; Both Muschamp&#x27;s and Blake&#x27;s complaints originated from the fact that the original plans resembled the setback-laden massing of older stone-faced apartment buildings on Central Park West, except with a glass cladding.

When the updated plan was announced in June 2000, Muschamp wrote that the design &quot;is an asymmetrical composition of crystalline contours&quot; and that, in sharp contrast to the previous plan, it was not derivative of older Central Park West towers. Muschamp disliked the &quot;lanterns&quot; that were to be placed atop the towers, and he found the facade of the base to be &quot;infected&quot; by &quot;aesthetic backsliding&quot;, but overall he thought the design to be a homage to the city&#x27;s Art Deco architecture. By contrast, Martin Filler of &quot;The New Republic&quot; was dissatisfied with the revised glass design, especially as opposed to the masonry plans: &quot;Light construction [...] implies the dual phenomena of weightlessness and transparency; and there is none of the former and little of the latter in evidence here.&quot; The plans also faced opposition from community groups that considered the building to be too large.

After the September 11 attacks, the towers of Time Warner Center were compared to the destroyed World Trade Center, though the building&#x27;s developers denied any intentional similarity to the fallen Twin Towers. In 2003, &quot;Architectural Record&quot; wrote: &quot;AOL Time Warner Center with its new twin towers is testimony of how the people of the city can overcome great obstacles to get on with life.&quot; When Time Warner Center was almost completed, Paul Goldberger wrote for &quot;The New Yorker&quot; that, though the design had been intended to conform with the surrounding street grid, this was nullified by the building&#x27;s sheer size. According to Goldberger, &quot;The best you can say is that they prevent it from being worse than it is, or as bad as earlier versions, which date from the nineteen-eighties.&quot; Peggy Deamer of the &quot;Journal of the American Institute of Architects&quot; wrote in 2004: &quot;Shouldn&#x27;t the designers have broadened the notion of context beyond the building envelope?&quot;

In spite of criticism over the building&#x27;s size, architectural critics generally approved of Time Warner Center when it was completed. Ada Louise Huxtable wrote for &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; in early 2004: &quot;The AOL Time Warner Center is exactly what a New York skyscraper should be—a soaring, shining, glamorous affirmation of the city&#x27;s reach and power, and its best real architecture in a long time.&quot; Muschamp said of the completed building: &quot;...The mood is modern noir. The two towers are worthy descendants of Radio City.&quot; Even though Goldberger did not like the building&#x27;s size, he said, &quot;If you don’t look up, you could like this building&quot;, though he regarded it as &quot;a theme-park version of a sophisticated urban building&quot;. A writer for &quot;Reason&quot; magazine said that, while critics did not praise Time Warner Center as they did the Hearst Tower or the New York Times Building, &quot;they do agree the commercial behemoth deserves its place in this emerging pantheon of buildings&quot;. The American Institute of Architects&#x27; 2007 survey &quot;List of America&#x27;s Favorite Architecture&quot; ranked the Time Warner Center among the top 150 buildings in the United States.

<text>Route 168 is a state highway in the southern part of New Jersey. The route&#x27;s southern terminus is an interchange with Route 42 and the Atlantic City Expressway in the Turnersville section of Washington Township, Gloucester County. The northern terminus is an intersection of Ferry Avenue (CR 603) on the border of Camden and Woodlynne in Camden County. At this point, the route continues toward Downtown Camden as Mt Ephraim Avenue (CR 605). Route 168 follows the Black Horse Pike for most of its length, running through suburban areas in Gloucester Township, Runnemede, Bellmawr, and Mount Ephraim. It intersects and interchanges many major roads, including the Route 42 freeway in Gloucester Township, Route 41 in Runnemede, the New Jersey Turnpike and I-295 in Bellmawr, Route 76C (an access ramp to I-76 and I-676) in Haddon Township, and US 130 in Camden.

What is now Route 168 runs along the Black Horse Pike, a turnpike established in 1855 that was to run from Camden to Atlantic City. In 1927, Route 42 was designated along this portion of road as part of its route between Camden and McKee City. In the 1940s, a freeway was proposed for Route 42 between Turnersville and the Camden area; construction began on this freeway in the 1950s. After this freeway was entirely completed in 1959, the Route 42 designation was moved to it and the former alignment of Route 42 along the Black Horse Pike north of Turnersville became Route 168.

==Route description==

Route 168 begins at an interchange with the west end of the Atlantic City Expressway, which feeds into Route 42 in the Turnersville section of Washington Township, Gloucester County; the North–South Freeway begins at that interchange, carrying Route 42 and through traffic from Atlantic City towards Camden. Meanwhile, Route 168 continues on Black Horse Pike as a four-lane divided surface road, with the route officially beginning at the intersection of Hurff Lane. Access from Route 168 south to Route 42 is provided via a one-way ramp continuing from the southern terminus of Route 168. However, northbound traffic from Route 42 must take the ramp to the freeway and exit immediately from the collector/distributor road onto northbound Sicklerville Road (CR 705) to access Route 168.

From here, Route 168 continues north through commercial areas before crossing the Big Timber Creek into Gloucester Township, Camden County, where it becomes a three-lane road with a center left-turn lane and immediately intersects with College Drive (CR 673), which provides access to Camden County College. The road heads west of the Gloucester Premium Outlets and passes through suburban areas of homes and businesses, coming to the intersection of Lakeland Road (CR 747). From here, the route heads through the Blackwood section of Gloucester Township, where it intersects with Church Street (CR 534). The route leaves the Blackwood area and comes to an intersection of Alomnesson Road/Erial Road (CR 706). The road passes businesses past this intersection as a three-lane road with two southbound lanes and one northbound lane before coming to an interchange with Route 42. At this interchange, there is full access between northbound Route 42 and Route 168 and between southbound Route 42 and Route 168.

Past the interchange with Route 42, the route intersects with Old Black Horse Pike (CR 676) and narrows to two lanes as it heads through commercial areas of Hilltop. It gains a center left-turn lane again before it crosses the intersection of Lower Landing Road (CR 681) and the North Branch of the Big Timber Creek. Route 168 comes to the intersection of Chews Landing Road (CR 683) and enters the Glendora section of Gloucester Township, where it heads into residential and commercial areas. Here, the route intersects with Station Avenue (CR 682). At the intersection of Evesham Road (CR 544), the road crosses into Runnemede and becomes a two-lane road. Route 168 crosses the intersection of Clements Bridge Road (Route 41/CR 573) and heads through the center of Runnemede. The center-left turn lane along the route returns before it comes to a double trumpet interchange with the New Jersey Turnpike on the border of Runnemede and Bellmawr. Past here, Route 168 passes more businesses and crosses the intersection of Browning Road (CR 659). A short distance later, the route comes to an interchange with I-295, where it becomes a four-lane undivided road.
The route forms the border between Mount Ephraim to the west and Haddon Heights to the east past this interchange and intersects with Prospect Ridge Boulevard (CR 654) and Bell Road (CR 658). At the intersection with the latter, Route 168 entirely enters Mount Ephraim and crosses CR 551 Spur. Past this intersection, the road enters a mix of residential and commercial areas and comes to the intersection of Valley Road (CR 660). Upon crossing Audubon Lake, Route 168 forms the border between Haddon Township to the west and Audubon to the east and becomes a divided highway again with several jughandles. The route crosses the intersection of Nicholson Road (CR 635), where it becomes the border of Haddon Township and Audubon Park as a six-lane divided highway. An interchange with Route 76C provides access to I-76, I-676, and the Walt Whitman Bridge to and from the southbound direction of Route 168.

Immediately past this interchange, Route 168 narrows to four lanes and intersects with Kendall Boulevard (CR 650), crossing the Newton Creek, where it forms the border between Camden to the west and Haddon Township to the east. Here, the route crosses the channelized intersection of Crescent (US 130). After crossing over the channelized intersection of US 130, Route 168 drops the Black Horse Pike designation and becomes Mt Ephraim Avenue as is runs between the Fairview section of Camden and the West Collingswood Extension section of Haddon Township. Here, the route narrows to a two-lane undivided road and passes through urban areas. It crosses over the intersection of Collings Road/Collings Avenue (CR 630) before it becomes a three-lane road with a center left-turn lane and entirely enters Camden. The road crosses the North Branch of the Newton Creek, where it forms the border between Camden to the west and Woodlynne to the east. It becomes a four-lane undivided road that passes through industrial sectors before crossing Conrail Shared Assets Operations&#x27; Beesleys Point Secondary railroad line and heading past more urban development. Route 168 ends at the intersection of Ferry Avenue (CR 603), where Mt Ephraim Avenue continues north as CR 605 to Downtown Camden, ending at an intersection of Haddon Avenue (CR 561).

==History==

The predecessor to today&#x27;s Route 168 was a set of Lenni Lenape trails that followed the Timber Creek. In 1855, the Camden and Blackwoodstown Turnpike Company was established by entrepreneurs who had helped create the White Horse Pike to build a gravel road that would run from Camden south to Blackwoodtown and eventually to Atlantic City; this road became the Black Horse Pike. The creation of the Black Horse Pike led to the development of several towns along the route. The Black Horse Pike was transferred from the turnpike company to the county in 1903, at a time where many private turnpikes would become public roads. In the 1927 New Jersey state highway renumbering, this portion of the Black Horse Pike was designated as part of a new route, Route 42, that was to run from Ferry Avenue in Camden south to Route 48 (now US 40) in McKee City. This portion of road retained the Route 42 designation in the 1953 New Jersey state highway renumbering.

In the late 1940s, a freeway was planned to bypass this portion of Route 42, with right-of-way acquisition and construction starting in the 1950s. This new freeway, called the North–South Freeway, opened between Bellmawr and the Black Horse Pike in Blackwood in 1958 and from Blackwood to Turnersville in 1959. With the opening of the freeway, the Route 42 designation was moved to the North–South Freeway and the Black Horse Pike between Turnersville and Camden became Route 168.

<doc id="360300" wikidata="Q208227" url="?curid=360300" title="The Final Cut (album)">
<text>The Final Cut is the twelfth studio album by the English rock band Pink Floyd, released on 21 March 1983 through Harvest and Columbia Records. It comprises unused material from the band&#x27;s previous studio album, &quot;The Wall&quot; (1979), alongside new material recorded throughout 1982.

&quot;The Final Cut&quot; is the last Pink Floyd album to feature founding member Roger Waters, who left the band in 1985. It is the only Pink Floyd album without founding member and keyboardist Richard Wright, who had left the band under pressure from Waters after the &quot;Wall&quot; sessions. The recording was plagued by conflict; guitarist David Gilmour felt many of the tracks were not worthy of inclusion, but Waters accused him of failing to contribute material himself. The contributions from drummer Nick Mason were limited mostly to sound effects.

Waters planned the album as a soundtrack for the 1982 film adaptation of &quot;The Wall&quot;. With the onset of the Falklands War, he rewrote it as a concept album exploring what he considered the betrayal of those — including his father — who died defending freedom in World War II. Waters sang lead vocals on all but one track, and he is credited for all songwriting. The album was accompanied by a short film released in the same year.

&quot;The Final Cut&quot; received mixed reviews, though retrospective reception has been more favourable. Though it reached number one in the UK and number six in the US, it was the lowest-selling Pink Floyd studio album worldwide since their sixth album, &quot;Meddle&quot; (1971).

==Background==
&quot;The Final Cut&quot; was conceived as a soundtrack album for &quot;Pink Floyd – The Wall&quot;, the 1982 film based on Pink Floyd&#x27;s previous studio album &quot;The Wall&quot; (1979). Under its working title &quot;Spare Bricks&quot;, it would have featured new music rerecorded for the film, such as &quot;When the Tigers Broke Free&quot;. Bassist, vocalist, and primary songwriter Roger Waters also planned to record a small amount of new material, expanding &quot;The Wall&quot;&#x27;s narrative.

As a result of the Falklands War, Waters changed direction and wrote new material. He saw British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher&#x27;s response to Argentina&#x27;s invasion of the islands as jingoistic and unnecessary, and dedicated the new album—provisionally titled &quot;Requiem for a Post-War Dream&quot;—to his father, Eric Fletcher Waters. A second lieutenant of the 8th Royal Fusiliers, Eric Waters died during the Second World War at Aprilia in Italy, on 18 February 1944, when Roger was five months old. Waters said:

Waters had conflicting feelings about how his generation was tackling issues that greatly affected his father&#x27;s generation. In an interview in 1987, he confessed: It says something about a sense, I suppose for me personally, a sense that &quot;I&quot; may have betrayed him. He died in the last war and I kind of feel that I personally may have betrayed him, because we haven’t managed to improve things very much. That the economic cycles still over-ride everything, with the best intentions, the cycle of economic recession followed by resurgence still governs our actions. Guitarist David Gilmour disliked Waters&#x27; politicising, and the new creative direction prompted arguments. Five other tracks not used on &quot;The Wall&quot; (&quot;Your Possible Pasts&quot;, &quot;One of the Few&quot;, &quot;The Final Cut&quot;, &quot;The Fletcher Memorial Home&quot;, and &quot;The Hero&#x27;s Return&quot;) had been set aside for &quot;Spare Bricks&quot;, and although Pink Floyd had often reused material, Gilmour felt the songs were not good enough for a new studio album. He wanted to write new material, but Waters remained doubtful as Gilmour had lately contributed little new music. Gilmour said:

The title &quot;The Final Cut&quot; is a reference to William Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Julius Caesar&quot;: &quot;This was the most unkindest cut of all&quot;. &quot;When the Tigers Broke Free&quot; was issued as a single titled &quot;Pink Floyd: The Wall: Music from the Film&quot; on 26 July 1982, with the film version of &quot;Bring the Boys Back Home&quot; on the B-side; the single was labelled &quot;Taken from the album &quot;The Final Cut&quot;&quot; but was not included on that album until the 2004 CD reissue.

==Concept==

&quot;The Final Cut&quot; is an anti-war concept album that explores what Waters regards as the betrayal of fallen British servicemen—such as his father—who during the Second World War sacrificed their lives in the spirit of a post-war dream. This dream was that their victory would usher in a more peaceful world, whose leaders would no longer be so eager to resolve disputes by resorting to war. The album&#x27;s lyrics are critical of Thatcher, whose policies and decisions Waters regarded as an example of this betrayal. She is referred to as &quot;Maggie&quot; throughout the album.

The opening track, &quot;The Post War Dream&quot;, begins with a recorded announcement that the replacement for the &quot;Atlantic Conveyor&quot;, a ship lost during the Falklands campaign, will be built in Japan. Waters&#x27; lyrics refer to his dead father, the loss of Britain&#x27;s shipbuilding industry to Japan, and Margaret Thatcher, before moving on to &quot;Your Possible Pasts&quot;, a rewritten version of a song rejected for &quot;The Wall&quot;. In &quot;One of the Few&quot;, another rejected song, the schoolteacher from &quot;The Wall&quot; features as the main character of the &quot;Final Cut&quot; short film, presented as a war hero returned to civilian life. He is unable to relate his experiences to his wife, and in &quot;The Hero&#x27;s Return&quot; is tormented by the loss of one of his aircrew. &quot;The Gunner&#x27;s Dream&quot; discusses the hope of a world free from tyranny and the threat of terrorism (with a reference to the Hyde Park bombing). It is followed in &quot;Paranoid Eyes&quot; by the teacher&#x27;s descent into alcoholism.

The second half deals with various war issues. While &quot;Southampton Dock&quot; is a lament to returning war heroes and those who did not return, &quot;Not Now John&quot; addresses society&#x27;s ignorance of political and economic problems. &quot;Get Your Filthy Hands Off My Desert&quot; deals with Waters&#x27; feelings about war and invasion, and &quot;The Fletcher Memorial Home&quot; (the title is a nod to Waters&#x27; father) reflects a fantastical application of &quot;the final solution&quot; on a gathering of political leaders including Leonid Brezhnev, Menachem Begin and Thatcher. The album&#x27;s titular song deals with the aftermath of a man&#x27;s isolation and sexual repression, as he contemplates suicide and struggles to reconnect with the world around him. The album ends with &quot;Two Suns in the Sunset&quot;, which portrays a nuclear holocaust: the final result of a world obsessed with war and control.

==Recording==

American composer Michael Kamen, who had contributed to &quot;The Wall&quot;, co-produced, oversaw the orchestral arrangements, and mediated between Waters and Gilmour. He also stood in for keyboardist Richard Wright, who had left the band under pressure from Waters during the recording of &quot;The Wall&quot;. James Guthrie was studio engineer and co-producer, while Mason&#x27;s drumming was supplemented by Ray Cooper on percussion; when Mason was unable to perform the complex time changes on &quot;Two Suns in the Sunset&quot;, he was replaced by session musician Andy Newmark. Mason also suggested the repeated reprises of &quot;Maggie, what have we done&quot; be rendered instrumental rather than sung. Raphael Ravenscroft was hired to play the saxophone. Recording took place in the latter half of 1982 across eight studios, including Gilmour&#x27;s home studio at Hook End Manor, and Waters&#x27; Billiard Room Studios at East Sheen. The other studios were Mayfair Studios, Olympic Studios, Abbey Road Studios, Eel Pie Studios, Audio International and RAK Studios.

Tensions soon emerged, and while Waters and Gilmour initially worked together, playing the video game &quot;Donkey Kong&quot; (1981) in their spare time, they eventually chose to work separately. Engineer Andy Jackson worked with Waters on vocals; Guthrie with Gilmour on guitars. They would occasionally meet to discuss the work that had been completed; while this method was not in itself unusual, Gilmour began to feel strained, sometimes barely maintaining his composure. Kamen too felt pressured; Waters had never been a confident vocalist and, on one occasion, after repeated studio takes, Waters noticed him writing on a notepad. Losing his temper, he demanded to know what Kamen was doing, only to find that Kamen had been writing, &quot;I Must Not Fuck Sheep&quot; repeatedly. Waters said that &quot;a lot of that aggravation came through in the vocal performance, which, looking back, really was quite tortured.&quot;

Like previous Pink Floyd albums, &quot;The Final Cut&quot; used sound effects combined with advances in audio recording technology. Mason&#x27;s contributions were mostly limited to recording sound effects for the experimental Holophonic system, an audio processing technique used to add an enhanced three-dimensional effect to the recordings; &quot;The Final Cut&quot; is the second album ever to feature this technology. The technique is featured on &quot;Get Your Filthy Hands Off My Desert&quot;, creating a sound of a rocket flying by and exploding which surrounds the listener, especially when headphones are used. Sound effects are reused from the Pink Floyd albums &quot;Meddle&quot; (1971), &quot;The Dark Side of the Moon&quot; (1973), &quot;Wish You Were Here&quot; (1975), &quot;Animals&quot; (1977) and &quot;The Wall&quot; (1979).

After months of poor relations, and following a final confrontation, Gilmour had his name removed from the credit list as producer, although he was still paid production royalties. Waters later said that he was also under significant pressure and that early in production believed he would never record with Gilmour or Mason again. He may have threatened to release the album as a solo record, although Pink Floyd were contracted to EMI and such a move would have been unlikely to succeed. Mason kept himself distant, dealing with marital problems. In an August 1987 interview, Waters recalled &quot;The Final Cut&quot; as an &quot;absolute misery to make&quot;, and that the band members were &quot;fighting like cats and dogs&quot;. He said the experience forced them to accept that they had not worked together as a band since their ninth studio album &quot;Wish You Were Here&quot; (1975).

==Packaging==

Storm Thorgerson, a founder member of Hipgnosis (designers of most of Pink Floyd&#x27;s previous and future artwork), was passed over for the cover design. Instead, Waters created the cover himself, using photographs taken by his brother-in-law, Willie Christie. The front cover shows a Remembrance poppy and four Second World War medal ribbons against the black fabric of the jacket or blazer on which they are worn. From left to right, the medals are the 1939–1945 Star, the Africa Star, the Defence Medal, and the Distinguished Flying Cross.

The poppy is a recurring design theme. The interior gatefold features three photographs, the first depicting an outdoor scene with an outstretched hand holding three poppies and in the distance, a soldier with his back to the camera. Two more photographs show a welder at work, his mask emblazoned with the Japanese Rising Sun Flag, and a nuclear explosion (a clear reference to &quot;Two Suns in the Sunset&quot;). The album&#x27;s lyrics are printed on the gatefold. Side one of the vinyl disc carries an image of a poppy field, and on side two, a soldier with a knife in his back lies face down amongst the poppies, a dog beside him. 

The back cover features a photograph of an officer standing upright and holding a film canister, with a knife protruding from his back: the film canister and knife may reflect Waters&#x27; tumultuous relationship with &quot;The Wall&quot; film director Alan Parker.

== Film ==
&quot;The Final Cut&quot; was accompanied by a short film. It features the songs &quot;The Gunner&#x27;s Dream&quot;, &quot;The Final Cut&quot;, &quot;The Fletcher Memorial Home&quot; and &quot;Not Now John&quot;. Produced and written by Waters and directed by his then brother-in-law Willie Christie, it features Waters talking to a psychiatrist named A. Parker-Marshall. The character name was meant to be a dig at both &quot;Pink Floyd: The Wall&quot; director Alan Parker and Alan Marshall, the film&#x27;s producer. Alex McAvoy, who played the teacher in &quot;Pink Floyd – The Wall&quot;, also appears. The film was released on Betamax and VHS in July 1983 and was one of EMI&#x27;s first &quot;video EPs&quot;.

== Release and sales ==
&quot;The Final Cut&quot; was released in the UK on 21 March 1983. It reached number one in the UK, surpassing &quot;The Dark Side of the Moon&quot; and &quot;The Wall&quot;. It was less successful in America, peaking at number six on the &quot;Billboard&quot; album charts. Issued as a single, &quot;Not Now John&quot; reached the UK Top 30, with its chorus of &quot;Fuck all that&quot; bowdlerised to &quot;Stuff all that&quot;.

With over 1,000,000 units shipped in the United States, the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) certified &quot;The Final Cut&quot; Platinum in May 1983. It was given double Platinum certification in 1997. However, &quot;The Final Cut&quot; was the lowest-selling Pink Floyd studio album in the United States and worldwide since &quot;Meddle&quot;. Gilmour claimed that this relative commercial failure supported his assertion that much of the material was weak. Waters responded that it was &quot;ridiculous&quot; to judge a record by its sales, and that he had been approached by a woman in a shop whose father had also been killed in World War II and told him &quot;The Final Cut&quot; was &quot;the most moving record she had ever heard&quot;. In 1983, Gilmour said &quot;The Final Cut&quot; was &quot;very good but it&#x27;s not personally how I would see a Pink Floyd record going&quot;.

&quot;The Final Cut&quot; was released on CD in 1983. A remastered and repackaged CD was issued by EMI in Europe and on Capitol Records in the US in 2004; this included an extra song, the previously released &quot;When the Tigers Broke Free&quot;. In 2007, a remastered version was released as part of the &quot;Oh, by the Way&quot; box set, packaged in a miniature replica of the original gatefold LP sleeve.

==Critical reception==
&quot;The Final Cut&quot; received mixed reviews. &quot;Melody Maker&quot; deemed it &quot;a milestone in the history of awfulness&quot;, and the &quot;NME&quot;″s Richard Cook wrote: &quot;Like the poor damned Tommies that haunt his mind, Roger Waters&#x27; writing has been blown to hell ... Waters stopped with &quot;The Wall&quot;, and &quot;The Final Cut&quot; isolates and juggles the identical themes of that elephantine concept with no fresh momentum to drive them.&quot; Robert Christgau wrote in &quot;The Village Voice&quot;: &quot;it&#x27;s a comfort to encounter antiwar rock that has the weight of years of self-pity behind it&quot;, and awarded the album a C+ grade.

More impressed, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;&#x27;s Kurt Loder viewed it as &quot;essentially a Roger Waters solo album ... a superlative achievement on several levels&quot;. Dan Hedges of &quot;Record&quot; also approved, writing: &quot;On paper it sounds hackneyed and contrived – the sort of thing that was worked into the ground by everyone from P. F. Sloan to Paul Kantner. In Pink Floyd&#x27;s case, it still works, partially through the understatement and ingenuity of the music and the special effects ... but mostly through the care Waters has taken in plotting out the imagery of his bleak visions.&quot;

==Aftermath and legacy==
With no plans to tour in support of the album, Waters and Gilmour instead turned to solo projects. Gilmour recorded and toured his second solo studio album &quot;About Face&quot; in 1984, using it to express his feelings on a range of topics from the murder of John Lennon to his relationship with Waters, who also began to tour his debut solo studio album, &quot;The Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking&quot; the same year. Mason released his second solo studio album, &quot;Profiles&quot;, in August 1985.

In 1985, faced with a potentially ruinous lawsuit from his record company and band members, Waters resigned. He believed that Pink Floyd was a &quot;spent force&quot;. He applied to the High Court to prevent the Pink Floyd name from ever being used again. His lawyers discovered that the partnership had never been formally confirmed, and Waters returned to the High Court in an attempt to gain a veto over further use of the band&#x27;s name. Gilmour&#x27;s team responded by issuing a press release affirming that Pink Floyd would continue; he told a &quot;Sunday Times&quot; reporter that &quot;Roger is a dog in the manger and I&#x27;m going to fight him&quot;.

Waters wrote to EMI and Columbia declaring his intention to leave the group, asking them to release him from his contractual obligations. With a legal case pending, he dispensed with manager Steve O&#x27;Rourke and employed Peter Rudge to manage his affairs. He later contributed to the soundtrack for &quot;When the Wind Blows&quot; (1986) and recorded a second solo studio album, &quot;Radio K.A.O.S.&quot; (1987)

Owing to the combination of Pink Floyd&#x27;s partial break-up and Waters&#x27; dominance on the project, &quot;The Final Cut&quot; is sometimes viewed as a &quot;de facto&quot; Waters solo album. The personal quality assigned to the lyrics are related to Waters&#x27; struggle to reconcile his despair at the changing social face of Britain, and also the loss of his father during the Second World War. Gilmour&#x27;s guitar solos on &quot;Your Possible Pasts&quot; and &quot;The Fletcher Memorial Home&quot; are, however, sometimes considered the equal of his best work on &quot;The Wall&quot;. More recent reviews of the album have weighed its importance alongside the band&#x27;s break-up. Writing for AllMusic, Stephen Thomas Erlewine said &quot;with its anger, emphasis on lyrics, and sonic textures, it&#x27;s clear that it&#x27;s the album that Waters intended it to be. And it&#x27;s equally clear that Pink Floyd couldn&#x27;t have continued in this direction.&quot; &quot;Stylus Magazine&quot; wrote: &quot;It&#x27;s about pursuing something greater even when you have all the money that you could ever want. And either failing or succeeding brilliantly. It&#x27;s up to you to decide whether this record is a success or a failure, but I&#x27;d go with the former every time.&quot; Rachel Mann of The Quietus said &quot;flawed though it is, &quot;The Final Cut&quot; remains a tremendous album&quot; and &quot;still has something fresh to say&quot;. Mike Diver of &quot;Drowned in Sound&quot; was less generous: &quot;Rays of light are few and far between, and even on paper the track titles – including &#x27;The Gunner&#x27;s Dream&#x27; and &#x27;Paranoid Eyes&#x27; – suggest an arduous listen.&quot;

<text>Kew Bridge is a wide-span bridge over the Tideway (upper estuary of the Thames) linking the London Boroughs of Richmond upon Thames and Hounslow. The present bridge, which was opened in 1903 as King Edward VII Bridge by King Edward VII and Queen Alexandra, was designed by John Wolfe-Barry and Cuthbert A Brereton. Historic England listed it at Grade II in 1983.

== Location ==
Kew Bridge crosses the west of the Tideway between the Kew Green neighbourhood of Kew on the south bank and Brentford on the north bank. Its southern approach adjoins the Royal Botanic Gardens; the northern adjoins the former Grand Junction Waterworks Company buildings and reservoirs (the remnant of which is the London Museum of Water &amp; Steam).

The bridge forms a primary route joining the South Circular and North Circular roads to the west of London, and can be very congested. 

On the eastward Kew bank is Kew Pier, which serves tourist ferries operating under licence from London River Services.

== History ==


The Museum of Richmond has an engraving by John Barnard, architect of the design for the first Kew Bridge, dedicated to George, Prince of Wales and his mother Augusta and dated 1759. Bernard describes it as the &quot;Bridge over the River of Thames from Kew in the County of Surry to the opposite shore in the County of Middlesex&quot;. Kew and the area around the bridge was significant to George as his father Frederick took a lease on Kew House, now part of the Royal Botanic Gardens from 1731 and rebuilt the house to designs by William Kent. George&#x27;s mother Augusta started the botanic gardens and created many of the garden buildings.

The first bridge was built by Robert Tunstall of Brentford who previously owned the ferry on the site. The bridge was inaugurated on 1 June 1759 by the Prince of Wales driving over it with his mother and a number of other royals, and was opened to the public three days later. Such was the excitement that over 3,000 people crossed in one day. Tolls ranged from 1 penny for each pedestrian to one shilling and six pence for a coach and four horses (these are equivalent to p and £ in ).


The first bridge was constructed with two stone arches at each end and seven timber arches in between, which proved costly to maintain and as a consequence the bridge only lasted 30 years. In 1782 Robert Tunstall, son of the builder of the first bridge, obtained consent in the (22 Geo. 3. c. 42) to replace the bridge and work began on 4 June 1783, the anniversary date of the first bridge opening to the public. The new bridge was designed by James Paine who had previously been responsible for Richmond Bridge. The cost was £16,500 (equivalent to £ million in ) which was raised by means of a tontine.

The second bridge was built alongside the first, to avoid hindrance to traffic during construction work, and this time was built entirely of stone. It was again opened, on 22 September 1789, by George, who by this time had become King George III, crossing with &quot;a great concourse of carriages&quot;. The tolls were a half penny per pedestrian and 6 pence for each horse (these are equivalent to p and £ in ). The bridge was sold by auction to a Mr Robinson for £23,000 in 1819 (equivalent to £ million in ) and again in 1873, to the City of London Corporation and the Metropolitan Board of Works for £57,300 (equivalent to £ million in ). The exhibition included a copy of a J. M. W. Turner sketch of the second bridge from Brentford Ait 1805/6 with barges on the left.

The tollbooths were at the Brentford end of the bridge and were originally planned as pavilions with Doric porticos. To save on the cost rather simpler Italianate booths were built instead of brick and stucco. Tolls were abolished on 8 February 1873 and a triumphal arch was built at the Brentford entrance to the bridge. The gates were removed and paraded on a brewer&#x27;s dray through Brentford and around Kew Green.
By the 1890s it was clear that the second bridge could not really cope with the weight of traffic and in any case the approach was too narrow and steep on the Brentford side. The engineer Sir John Wolfe Barry was invited to assess the bridge in 1892 and recommended building a new bridge rather than modifications to the second one.

The (61 &amp; 62 Vict. c. clv) paved the way and the third bridge was commissioned jointly by the Middlesex and Surrey county councils at a cost of £250,000 (equivalent to £ million in ). The engineers were Barry and Brereton and the building contractors were Easton Gibbs and Son. The third bridge is long, and the largest of its three arches has a span of . The roadway is wide (compared to on the second bridge), and the pavements compared to . It was built of granite from Kemnay Quarry.

A temporary wooden bridge was put in place upstream of the second bridge before demolition during October to December 1899. The third bridge was completed for an official opening on 20 May 1903 by King Edward VII and Queen Alexandra who processed through Kensington, Hammersmith, Chiswick and Brentford on the way to the ceremony, returning via Mortlake and Barnes and re-crossing the Thames at Putney Bridge.

The centre of the bridge was provided with a tented pavilion 60 yards long and spanning its whole width. A special temporary balcony, projecting from this, was installed so that the crowds on the banks and on the water could see the royal visitors. The king laid the last coping stone with a silver trowel and declared the bridge open. He and the queen were given a number of gifts including bouquets, a bound history of the bridge and various other commemorative items including a silver-mounted prehistoric flint axe found during construction work, another axe with part of its haft remaining and a fine silver spirit level made in the shape of the bridge itself. Later the Mayor of Richmond presented a chair with the ladders in its back carved in the shape of the three bridges. The inhabitants of Brentford and Chiswick presented a 1721 silver tankard.

After the departure of the royals a huge party took place on the lawns at Kew Gardens and 1,000 children were entertained to tea in a marquee on Kew Green, an event hosted by Cuthbert Brereton.

During the silent era of film, a Kew Bridge Studios operated along part of the northern approach. The site was later used by the Q Theatre.
== Kew Bridge in art ==
A drawing made in 1759 by Paul Sandby, showing the first Kew Bridge built in 1758–1759 by John Barnard, and &quot;Old Kew Bridge, London&quot; by James Webb, an oil painting dating from 1876 to 1885, are held at the Museum of London.

The oil painting &quot;Kew Bridge&quot; by Henry Muhrman (1854–1916) was painted in about 1898, when the artist was living in Gunnersbury. It is now in the Tate Gallery&#x27;s collection.

The Tate also holds J. M. W. Turner&#x27;s pen and ink sketch &quot;The Thames at Kew with Kew Bridge&quot; (1805) and his oil painting &quot;The Thames Glimpsed between Trees, possibly at Kew Bridge c.1806-7&quot;.

Myles Birket Foster (1825–1899) painted &quot;Kew Bridge from Strand on the Green&quot;.

Landscapist Lewis Pinhorn Wood (1848–1918), who lived in Chiswick between 1897 and 1908, painted &quot;Arrival of a Steamer at the Old Kew Bridge&quot;, portraying passengers embarking from the river transport service at Kew Pier in front of the second bridge.

Chiswick Local Studies Library has a painting &quot;Kew Bridge and Strand-on-the-Green&quot; attributed to Smyth Watson and also &quot;Strand-on-the-Green and Kew Bridge&quot; by an unknown artist.

Hounslow Local Studies Library has &quot;Kew Bridge&quot; by James Isaiah Lewis, painted in about 1900.

<text>Route 171 is a state highway in New Jersey, United States. It runs just under as an extension of U.S. Route 130 (US 130) past its northern terminus at US 1 in North Brunswick Township. The state highway ends along Georges Road near the border of North Brunswick Township and the city of New Brunswick. The route formerly extended into downtown New Brunswick ending at an intersection with Route 27, though the route was mostly unsigned inside New Brunswick. The route is a major thoroughfare in North Brunswick. The route originated as an alignment of pre-1927 Route 1 and later of US 130. After US 130 was truncated, the alignment, which had also been designated Route 25M, was later re-designated as Route 171.

==Route description==

Route 171 begins at an interchange with US 130 and US 1 in North Brunswick (the official beginning being at the ramp from southbound US 1). The route, which continues as a right-of-way for US 130, heads northward along Georges Road as a four-lane road (two lanes in each direction) passing retail and office buildings and an apartment complex. At an intersection with Cranbury Cross Road, Route 171 turns to the northeast. The route heads northward, passing the Brunswick Shopping Center and intersects County Route 606 (CR 606; Milltown Road). The route continues to the northwest through North Brunswick narrowing to one lane in each direction with a center turn lane. Route 171 passes some retail businesses, the Van Liew Cemetery, and a residential neighborhood. After an intersection with Nassau Street, the road passes Elmwood Cemetery. Around the location where the center turn lane ends, state maintenance of Georges Road ends, therefore terminating the Route 171 designation, however the road continues into the city of New Brunswick.

==History==
The highway dates back to the alignment of Route 1, assigned in the early 1920s. The designation remained in place until the 1927 New Jersey State highway renumbering, when New Jersey Route 25 was designated onto the alignment of U.S. Route 130, which was also designated in 1927. Route 25 was aligned on the entire alignment of Route 171, but by 1930, the route was realigned onto U.S. Route 1. The alignment of U.S. Route 130 remained along the alignment of Route 171 for several years, and by 1940, the northern alignment of Route 171 was designated as Route 25M. In the 1953 renumbering, Route 25M was redesignated Route 171, when Route 25 was decommissioned.

Prior to the truncation of Route 171 to North Brunswick by 2019, the Route 171 was carried along the county and city-maintained Georges Road, Commercial Avenue (renamed to Paul Robeson Boulevard in 2019), Suydam Street, Livingston Avenue, and George Street (the final street concurrent with CR 527) before ending at Albany Street (Route 27). With a small extension to the US 130 ramp to US 1 north at its southern end, the total length of the original route was . No signage for Route 171 appeared along the New Brunswick segments of the route though one sign for it appeared at its intersection with Route 27 in July 2016.

<doc id="360310" wikidata="Q1367947" url="?curid=360310" title="Reaper">
<text>A reaper is a farm implement that (cuts and often also gathers) crops at harvest when they are ripe. Usually the crop involved is a cereal grass, especially wheat. The first documented reaping machines were Gallic reapers that were used in Roman times in what would become modern-day France. The Gallic reaper involved a comb which collected the heads, with an operator knocking the grain into a box for later threshing. 

Most modern mechanical reapers cut grass; most also gather it, either by windrowing or picking it up. Modern machines that not only cut and gather the grass but also thresh its seeds (the grain), winnow the grain, and deliver it to a truck or wagon, are called combine harvesters or simply combines, and are the engineering descendants of earlier reapers.

Hay is harvested somewhat differently from grain; in modern haymaking, the machine that cuts the grass is called a hay mower or, if integrated with a conditioner, a mower-conditioner. As a manual task, cutting of both grain and hay may be called reaping, involving scythes, sickles, and cradles, followed by differing downstream steps. Traditionally all such cutting could be called reaping, although a distinction between &quot;reaping&quot; of grain grasses and &quot;mowing&quot; of hay grasses has long existed; it was only after a decade of attempts at combined grain reaper/hay mower machines (1830s to 1840s) that designers of mechanical implements began resigning them to separate classes.

Mechanical reapers substantially changed agriculture from their appearance in the 1830s until the 1860s through 1880s, when they evolved into related machines, often called by different names (self-raking reaper, harvester, reaper-binder, grain binder, binder), that collected and bound the sheaves of grain with wire or twine.

==Hand reaping==
Hand reaping is done by various means, including plucking the ears of grains directly by hand, cutting the grain stalks with a sickle, cutting them with a scythe, or a scythe fitted with a grain cradle. Reaping is usually distinguished from &quot;mowing&quot;, which uses similar implements, but is the traditional term for cutting grass for hay, rather than reaping cereals. The stiffer, dryer straw of the cereal plants and the greener grasses for hay usually demand different blades on the machines. 

The reaped grain stalks are gathered into sheaves (bunches), tied with string or with a twist of straw. Several sheaves are then leant against each other with the ears off the ground to dry out, forming a stook. After drying, the sheaves are gathered from the field and stacked, being placed with the ears inwards, then covered with thatch or a tarpaulin; this is called a &quot;stack&quot; or &quot;rick&quot;. In the British Isles a rick of sheaves is traditionally called a &quot;corn rick&quot;, to distinguish it from a &quot;hay rick&quot; (&quot;corn&quot; in British English retains its older sense of &quot;grain&quot; generally, not &quot;maize&quot;). Ricks are made in an area inaccessible to livestock, called a &quot;rick-yard&quot; or &quot;stack-yard&quot;. The corn-rick is later broken down and the sheaves threshed to separate the grain from the straw. Collecting spilt grain from the field after reaping is called &quot;gleaning&quot;, and is traditionally done either by hand, or by penning animals such as chickens or pigs onto the field. 

Hand reaping is now rarely done in industrialized countries, but is still the normal method where machines are unavailable or where access for them is limited (such as on narrow terraces).

==Mechanical reaping==
A mechanical reaper or reaping machine is a mechanical, semi-automated device that harvests crops. Mechanical reapers and their descendant machines have been an important part of mechanized agriculture and a main feature of agricultural productivity.

===Mechanical reapers in the U.S.===

The 19th century saw several inventors in the United States claim innovation in mechanical reapers. The various designs competed with each other, and were the subject of several lawsuits.

Obed Hussey in Ohio patented a reaper in 1833, the &quot;Hussey Reaper&quot;. Made in Baltimore, Maryland, Hussey&#x27;s design was a major improvement in reaping efficiency. The new reaper only required two horses working in a non-strenuous manner, a man to work the machine, and another person to drive. In addition, the Hussey Reaper left an even and clean surface after its use.

The &quot;McCormick Reaper&quot; was designed by Robert McCormick in Walnut Grove, Virginia. However, Robert became frustrated when he was unable to perfect his new device. His son Cyrus asked for permission to try to complete his father&#x27;s project. With permission granted, the McCormick Reaper was patented by his son Cyrus McCormick in 1834 as a horse-drawn farm implement to cut small grain crops. This McCormick reaper machine had several special elements:

* a main wheel frame
* projected to the side a platform containing a cutter bar having fingers through which reciprocated a knife driven by a crank
* upon the outer end of the platform was a divider projecting ahead of the platform to separate the grain to be cut from that to be left standing
* a reel was positioned above the platform to hold the grain against the reciprocating knife to throw it back upon the platform
* the machine was drawn by a team walking at the side of the grain.
Cyrus McCormick claimed that his reaper was actually invented in 1831, giving him the true claim to the general design of the machine. Over the next few decades the Hussey and McCormick reapers would compete with each other in the marketplace, despite being quite similar. By the 1850s, the original patents of both Hussey and McCormick had expired and many other manufacturers put similar machines on the market.

In 1861, the United States Patent and Trademark Office issued a ruling on the invention of the polarizing reaper design. It was determined that the money made from reapers was in large part due to Obed Hussey. S. T. Shubert, the acting commissioner of patents, declared that Hussey&#x27;s improvements were the foundation of their success. It was ruled that the heirs of Obed Hussey would be monetarily compensated for his hard work and innovation by those who had made money from the reaper. It was also ruled that McCormick&#x27;s reaper patent would be renewed for another seven years.

Although the McCormick reaper was a revolutionary innovation for the harvesting of crops, it did not experience mainstream success and acceptance until at least 20 years after it was patented by Cyrus McCormick. This was because the McCormick reaper lacked a quality unique to Obed Hussey&#x27;s reaper. Hussey&#x27;s reaper used a sawlike cutter bar that cut stalks far more effectively than McCormick&#x27;s. Only once Cyrus McCormick was able to acquire the rights to Hussey&#x27;s cutter-bar mechanism (around 1850) did a truly revolutionary machine emerge. Other factors in the gradual uptake of mechanized reaping included natural cultural conservatism among farmers (proven tradition versus new and unknown machinery); the poor state of many new farm fields, which were often littered with rocks, stumps, and areas of uneven soil, making the lifespan and operability of a reaping machine questionable; and some amount of fearful Luddism among farmers that the machine would take away jobs, most especially among hired manual labourers.

Another strong competitor in the industry was the Manny Reaper by John Henry Manny and the companies that succeeded him. Even though McCormick has sometimes been simplistically credited as the [sole] &quot;inventor&quot; of the mechanical reaper, a more accurate statement is that he independently reinvented aspects of it, created a crucial original integration of enough aspects to make a successful whole, and benefited from the influence of more than two decades of work by his father, as well as the aid of Jo Anderson, a slave held by his family.

===Reapers in the late 19th and 20th century===
After the first reapers were developed and patented, other slightly different reapers were distributed by several manufacturers throughout the world. The &quot;Champion (Combined) Reapers and Mowers&quot;, produced by the Champion Interest]group (&quot;Champion Machine Company&quot;, later &quot;Warder, Bushnell &amp; Glessner&quot;, absorbed in IHC 1902) in Springfield, Ohio in the second half of the 19th century, were highly successful in the 1880s in the United States. Springfield is still known as &quot;The Champion City&quot;.

Generally, reapers developed into the 1872 invented reaper-binder, which reaped the crop and bound it into sheaves. By 1896, 400,000 reaper-binders were estimated to be harvesting grain. This was in turn replaced by the swather and eventually the combine harvester, which reaps and threshes in one operation.

In Central European agriculture reapers were – together with reaper-binders – common machines until the mid-20th century.

<text>Route 440 is a state highway in New Jersey, United States. It comprises two segments, a freeway in Middlesex County linking Interstate 287 (I-287) and the New Jersey Turnpike (I-95), in Edison to the Outerbridge Crossing in Perth Amboy and an four-lane divided highway in Hudson County running from the Bayonne Bridge in Bayonne to US Route 1-9 Truck (US 1-9 Truck) in Jersey City. These two segments are connected by New York State Route 440 (NY 440), which runs across Staten Island. The freeway portion in Middlesex County is six lanes wide and intersects the Garden State Parkway and US 9 in Woodbridge.

What is now Route 440 was designated as two different routes in 1927: the Middlesex County portion between Route 4 (now Route 35) and the proposed Outerbridge Crossing was designated Route S4 (a spur of Route 4) while the Hudson County portion was designated as a part of Route 1. In 1953, Route 440 replaced Route S4 as well as Route 1 south of Communipaw Avenue; the number was chosen to match NY 440. A freeway was built for the route in Middlesex County between 1967 and finished in 1972. A freeway was also proposed for the route in Hudson County to fill in the gap between the Bayonne Bridge and West 63rd Street; however, it was never built. In 2001, Route 440 replaced Route 169 along the Bayonne waterfront.

==Route description==

=== Middlesex County ===

Route 440 begins in Edison at an interchange with the southern terminus of I-287 and the New Jersey Turnpike (I-95); from Route 440&#x27;s southern terminus, the road becomes northbound I-287. Within this interchange, Route 440 also has access to County Route 514 (CR 514). It continues to the east as a six-lane road through wooded surroundings and enters Woodbridge at the underpass of King Georges Post Road. Here, the route intersects Smith Street (CR 656) before intersecting the Garden State Parkway and US 9 at a large interchange. Within this interchange, the route passes under Conrail Shared Assets Operations&#x27; (CSAO) Raritan Industrial Track line. From here, the freeway turns northeast and passes under CSAO&#x27;s Perth Amboy Running Track line before it enters Perth Amboy at the point where it crosses under New Brunswick Avenue (CR 616). Route 440 passes near homes before coming to the next interchange for CR 501 and Route 184. At this point, CR 501 joins Route 440 to run concurrently, and the road comes to an interchange with Route 35 a short distance later. The road continues east-southeast, with an exit for Amboy Avenue (CR 653) before it passes through more residential neighborhoods. The final exit on the Middlesex County portion of Route 440 serves State Street (CR 611). Past this interchange, Route 440 becomes the Outerbridge Crossing, a four-lane bridge maintained by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey (PANYNJ). It passes over NJ Transit’s North Jersey Coast Line and State Street before crossing over the Arthur Kill onto Staten Island. At the New Jersey-New York state line on the middle of the bridge, the southern segments of Route 440 and CR 501 end and become NY 440. An extension of Route 440 also intersects with Route 35 right after the Victory Bridge crossing in Perth Amboy (around ShopRite) 

=== Hudson County ===

After NY 440 runs through Staten Island, it enters New Jersey again via the Bayonne Bridge, a four-lane bridge over Kill Van Kull that is also maintained by the PANYNJ. Upon entering Bayonne in Hudson County, the road becomes the northern segment of Route 440 and CR 501 and continues north into residential sections of the city. Continuing north as a four-lane freeway maintained by the New Jersey Department of Transportation (NJDOT), CR 501 splits from the route by heading north on Kennedy Boulevard at an interchange. Meanwhile, Route 440 turns to the east, with CSAO&#x27;s Avenue A Industrial Track and NJ Transit&#x27;s Hudson–Bergen Light Rail line parallel to the north, before heading northeast and passing through industrial areas as a four-lane expressway, crossing under a CSAO railroad line. It heads north-northeast as it passes between neighborhoods and the parallel CSAO Bayonne Industrial Track and NJ Transit&#x27;s Hudson–Bergen Light Rail lines to the west and port areas to the east, including the former Military Ocean Terminal.
The route crosses into Jersey City, where it comes to an interchange with the Newark Bay Extension of the New Jersey Turnpike (I-78) that provides access to the Jersey City and Hoboken waterfronts and the Holland Tunnel. Following this, Route 440 reaches an interchange with the southern terminus of Route 185. Here, the mainline becomes Route 185, and Route 440 exits onto another four-lane expressway. From here, Route 440 continues northwest, crossing under I-78 and passing over CSAO&#x27;s Bayonne Industrial Track and NJ Transit&#x27;s Hudson–Bergen Light Rail lines before closely paralleling the north side of I-78 and the south side of CSAO&#x27;s National Docks Branch line. The route interchanges with Avenue C before reentering Bayonne and crossing over Kennedy Boulevard (CR 501) without an interchange. Past this intersection, Route 440 makes a sharp turn to the south and passes under the Newark Bay Bridge (I-78). After making a hairpin turn back to the north, it passes under the Newark Bay Bridge another time and runs along the eastern shore of Newark Bay, crossing under CSAO&#x27;s National Docks Branch line. The route interchanges with West 63rd Street before crossing back into Jersey City and passing residences to the east. Route 440 becomes a four-lane arterial road before intersecting with Danforth Avenue (CR 602) as the road heads into business sectors farther to the east of Newark Bay. The road heads past industrial establishments before running through commercial areas again, passing to the east of the Hudson Mall. Route 440 ends at an intersection with US 1/9 Truck and Communipaw Avenue (CR 612), where the road continues north as part of US 1-9 Truck.

==History==

In the 1927 New Jersey state highway renumbering, what is now Route 440 was defined as two separate routes. The Middlesex County portion from Route 4 (now Route 35) to the present location of the Outerbridge Crossing was legislated as Route S4, a spur of Route 4. Meanwhile, the Hudson County portion of the route was legislated as a part of Route 1, a route that was to run from Bayonne to the New York border in Rockleigh. Route S4 was eventually extended west to the Garden State Parkway. This route followed Pfeiffer Boulevard and the one-way pair of Lawrence Avenue and Grove Street. Meanwhile, Route 1 only existed as a state-maintained highway north of West 63rd Street in Bayonne; south of there, traffic used Hudson Boulevard to access the Bayonne Bridge. A road carrying Route 1 was proposed to be built on landfill in the Passaic River; however, it was never constructed. In the 1953 New Jersey state highway renumbering, both Route S4 between the Garden State Parkway and the Outerbridge Crossing as well as Route 1 between West 63rd Street and Communipaw Avenue became Route 440 in order to match NY 440.

In 1959, an additional piece of Route 440 was legislated to run from the Bayonne Bridge to 63rd Street to complete the route, running over the waters of the Newark Bay; this was never built. In the mid-1950s, a freeway alignment was proposed for Route 440 in Middlesex County. This route, to be called the Middlesex Freeway, was to connect the New Jersey Turnpike and I-287 to the Outerbridge Crossing. Construction began on the freeway in 1967 and it was completed in 1974. The old alignment of Route 440 along Pfeiffer Boulevard between the Garden State Parkway and Route 35 became Route 184. A freeway was also proposed in the 1960s for Route 440 in Hudson County connecting the Bayonne Bridge to I-78 and filling in the gap in the route. In 1976, Route 440 was proposed along with Route 169 in a plan to redevelop the waterfront area of Bayonne. However, NJDOT shelved the project a year later due to low traffic volumes and feared environmental impact to the Newark Bay. Route 169 was later constructed as a four-lane arterial completed in 1992. In 2001, Route 169 was redesignated as Route 440 in order to complete the gap in the route.
On January 8, 2008, Gov. Jon Corzine announced plans for a new 35-cent toll on the Middlesex County portion of Route 440, in addition to increases on existing toll roads, to help raise funds to reduce New Jersey&#x27;s outstanding debt. However, he dropped the idea to toll Route 440 a month later after mounting opposition to the idea.
Between 2015 and 2018 the New Jersey Turnpike Authority reconstructed exit 14A between I-78 and Route . Construction began in 2017 to replace the overpass carrying Route 440 over the Garden State Parkway and US 9 and it was completed in 2019.

In anticipation of a general increase of activity in the Port of New York and New Jersey and new development on West Side and Hackensack Riverfront in Jersey City studies are being conducted to transform the roadway into a multi-use urban boulevard that includes possible grade separations, medians, and a new traffic circle at its northern terminus.

By Joint Resolution No. 4, approved July 3, 1997, the New Jersey Legislature designated the portion of Route 440 in the city of Perth Amboy as the Edward J. Patten Memorial Highway. Democrat Edward J. Patten, a former Mayor of Perth Amboy, New Jersey, later served as Secretary of State of New Jersey and represented New Jersey&#x27;s 15th congressional district in the United States House of Representatives.

<text>The Canadian Rockies Trail Guide by Brian Patton and Bart Robinson, describes 225 hiking and backpacking trails in the Canadian Rockies, including in Banff National Park and Jasper National Park. The first edition was published in 1971, with subsequent editions in 1978, 1986, 1990, 1992, 1994, 2000, 2007, 2011, and 2022 (10th edition). The book is published by Summerthought Publishing of Banff, Alberta. Trail updates are supplied by the book&#x27;s authors on their Canadian Rockies hiking blog.

The Trail Guide is one of the best-selling non-fiction books in Canada, often referred to as a &quot;bible&quot; by hikers. Its first seven editions sold more than 230,000 copies. 

For the first edition, the two authors hiked 108 trails with a custom-built trail odometer, which allowed them to measure trail distances more accurately than the Parks Canada trail signs. 

For each trail, the book lists:
* the length of time normally required to complete the trail
* the amount of elevation gain or loss, in metres and feet
* the maximum elevation in metres and feet
* the topographic map(s) covering the area
* how to get to the trailhead including GPS
* distances, in kilometres, to notable features along the way
* detailed description

The Whyte Museum hosted a retrospective exhibit for the book&#x27;s fortieth anniversary in 2011.

<text>Southwark Bridge ( ) is an arch bridge in London, for traffic linking the district of Southwark and the City across the River Thames. Besides when others are closed for temporary repairs, it has the least traffic of the Thames bridges in London.

==History==



In 1811 the private Southwark Bridge Company was formed, and authorised by the (51 Geo. 3. c. clxvi) to build a bridge across the Thames.

Construction of the first Southwark Bridge, designed by John Rennie the Elder, commenced in 1814, and it opened in 1819, having cost £700,000 to build, equivalent to £ in . Fifty people lost their lives during the construction.

On the 1818 Cary map of London, it was labelled as Queen Street Bridge. All subsequent maps label it as Southwark Bridge. The bridge consisted of three large cast-iron spans supported by granite piers. The bridge was notable for having the longest cast iron span, , ever made. Unsurprisingly, it became known colloquially as &quot;The Iron Bridge&quot; as mentioned inter alia in Charles Dickens&#x27; &quot;Little Dorrit&quot;. The iron spans were cast in Masbrough, Rotherham.

It was a commercial tolled operation which was trying to compete with the toll free Blackfriars and London bridges nearby, but the company became bankrupt. From 1864 the bridge was rented by the City of London Corporation, and made toll-free. Following the passage of the &#x27; (28 &amp; 29 Vict. c. cxcvi) it was purchased outright by the corporation in 1868 for £218,868, equivalent to £ in , about a third of the construction cost. The Southwark Bridge Company was subsequently wound-up by the &#x27; (35 &amp; 36 Vict. c. cl).

In 1912 the City of London Corporation decided a wider replacement bridge was required, to accommodate increased traffic. A new bridge on the site was designed by Ernest George and Basil Mott. A contract was awarded to Sir William Arrol &amp; Co. in 1913 to construct the bridge for the Bridge House Estates. War delayed progress, and the bridge was eventually opened for use on 6 June 1921 by King George V.

Halfway along the bridge on the Western side is a plaque which is inscribed:

 &quot;Re-built by the Bridge House Estates Committee&quot;&lt;br&gt;
 &quot;of the Corporation of London&quot;&lt;br&gt;
 &quot;1913-1921&quot;&lt;br&gt;
 &quot;Opened for traffic by their Majesties&quot;&lt;br&gt;
 &quot;King George V and Queen Mary&quot;&lt;br&gt;
 &quot;6th June 1921&quot;&lt;br&gt;
 &quot;Sir Ernest Lamb CMG, JP Chairman&quot;&lt;br&gt;
 &quot;Basil Mott, CB Engineer&quot;&lt;br&gt;
 &quot;Sir Ernest George RA Architect&quot;
The bridge provides access to Upper Thames Street on the north bank and, due to the ring of steel, there is no further road access to the City and the north. The bridge is owned and maintained by Bridge House Estates, a charitable trust overseen by the City of London Corporation. The current bridge was given Grade II listed structure status in 1995.

==Nearby==
At the north-west side is Vintners&#x27; Court, a 1990s office block which has a classical façade of columns and pediment; this was developed on the site owned by the Worshipful Company of Vintners whose hall is behind it on Upper Thames Street.

The south end is near the Tate Modern, the Clink Prison Museum, the Globe Theatre, and the &quot;Financial Times&quot; and Ofcom buildings. Below the bridge on the south side are some old steps, which were once used by Thames watermen as a place to moor their boats and wait for customers.

Below the bridge on the south side is a pedestrian tunnel, part of the Queen&#x27;s Walk Embankment, containing a frieze depicting the Thames frost fairs.

Cycle Superhighway 7 runs along the bridge.

==In popular culture==
*Southwark Bridge appears in many films, including &quot;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix&quot; (2007).
*The cream painted houses on the south side of the bridge, Anchor Terrace, just after the FT building, were used for the exterior shots of the shared house in &quot;This Life&quot;.
*The 1819-1920 &quot;Iron Bridge&quot; is mentioned in the first sentence of &quot;Our Mutual Friend&quot; by Charles Dickens, and several times in his &quot;Little Dorrit&quot;, where in Chapter 24 he identifies the toll as being one penny.
*In the 1964 Disney film &quot;Mary Poppins&quot;, the Banks family mistakenly think that George W. Banks has committed suicide by jumping off the bridge after he is fired from his job at the bank.
*DCI Luther and Alice Morgan meet at Southwark Bridge in the season 3 finale of the BBC crime drama &quot;Luther&quot;.
*The bridge appears in the final scene of &quot;Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels&quot; with Tom leaning over the bridge with his cell phone in his mouth set to drop antique guns in the Thames River.

<doc id="360327" wikidata="Q224958" url="?curid=360327" title="Thierry, Count of Flanders">
<text>Theoderic (, , ; – 17 January 1168), commonly known as Thierry of Alsace, was the fifteenth count of Flanders from 1128 to 1168. With a record of four campaigns in the Levant and Africa (including participation in the Second Crusade, the failed 1157–1158 siege of the Syrian city Shaizar, and the 1164 invasion of Egypt), he had a rare and distinguished record of commitment to crusading.

==Countship==
Theoderic was the youngest son of Duke Theoderic II of Lorraine and Gertrude, daughter of Count Robert I of Flanders. After the murder of his cousin, Charles the Good, in 1127, Theoderic claimed the County of Flanders, but another cousin, William Clito, became count instead with the support of King Louis VI of France. William&#x27;s politics and attitude towards the autonomy of Flanders made him unpopular, and by the end of the year Bruges, Ghent, Lille, and Saint-Omer recognized Theoderic as a rival count. Theoderic&#x27;s supporters came from the Imperial faction of Flanders.

Louis VI of France had Raymond of Martigné, the Archbishop of Reims, excommunicate Theoderic. Louis VI then besieged Lille, but was forced to retire when Henry I of England, William Clito&#x27;s uncle, transferred his support to Theoderic. However, Theoderic was defeated at Axspoele and fled to Bruges. He was forced to flee Bruges as well, and went to Aalst, where he was soon under siege from William, Godfrey I of Leuven, and Louis VI. The city was about to be captured when William died on 28 July 1128 from an infected wound sustained during the siege, leaving Theoderic as the only claimant to the seat.

Theoderic set up his government in Ghent and was recognized by all the Flemish cities as well as King Henry, who had his Flemish lords in England swear fealty to him. Theoderic himself swore homage to Louis VI after 1132, in order to gain the French king&#x27;s support against Baldwin IV, Count of Hainaut, who had advanced his own claim on Flanders.

==Pilgrimage and Second Crusade==
In 1132, his wife, Suanhilde, died, leaving only a daughter. In 1139, he went on pilgrimage to the crusader Kingdom of Jerusalem, and married Sibylla of Anjou, daughter of King Fulk of Jerusalem and the widow of William Clito; a very prestigious marriage. This was the first of Theoderic&#x27;s four pilgrimages to the Holy Land. While there he also led a victorious expedition against Caesarea Phillippi, and fought alongside his father-in-law in an invasion of Gilead. He soon returned to Flanders to put down a revolt in the Duchy of Lower Lotharingia, ruled at the time by Godfrey III of Leuven.

Theoderic joined the Second Crusade in 1147. He led the crossing of the Maeander River in Anatolia and fought at the Battla of Attalya in 1148, and after arriving in the crusader Kingdom he participated in the Council of Acre, where the ill-fated decision to attack Damascus was made. 

Theoderic participated in the Siege of Damascus, led by his wife&#x27;s half-brother Baldwin III of Jerusalem, and with the support of Baldwin, Louis VII of France, and Conrad III of Germany, he lay claim to Damascus. However, the native crusader barons preferred one of their own nobles, Guy I Brisebarre, lord of Beirut. According to William of Tyre, the resulting dispute contributed to the final failure of the siege: &#x27;for the local barons preferred that the Damascenes should keep their city rather than to see it given to the count&#x27;, and so did all they could to ensure the siege collapsed. Therefore, William continues, many contemporaries blamed Theoderic for the ultimate failure of the Second Crusade (though it is notable that William himself declines to say whether he believed Theoderic responsible). 

During his absence, Baldwin IV of Hainaut invaded Flanders and pillaged Artois; Sibylla reacted strongly and had Hainaut pillaged in response. The Archbishop of Reims intervened and a treaty was signed. When Theoderic returned in 1150, he took vengeance on Baldwin IV at Bouchain, with the aid of Henry I, Count of Namur and Henry II of Leez, Bishop of Liège. In the subsequent peace negotiations, Theoderic gave his daughter Marguerite in marriage to Baldwin IV&#x27;s son, the future Baldwin V, Count of Hainaut.

==Return to Holy Land==
In 1156, Theoderic had his eldest son married to Elizabeth of Vermandois, daughter and heiress of Raoul I of Vermandois. In 1156, he returned to the Holy Land, this time with his wife accompanying him. He participated in Baldwin III&#x27;s siege of Shaizar in 1157, but the fortress remained in Muslim hands when a dispute arose between Theoderic and Raynald of Châtillon over who would possess it should it be captured. He returned to Flanders 1159 without Sibylla, who remained behind to become a nun at the convent of St. Lazarus in Bethany. Their son Philip had ruled the county in their absence, and he remained co-count after Theoderic&#x27;s return. In 1164, Theoderic returned once more to the Holy Land. He accompanied King Amalric I, another half-brother of Sibylla, to Antioch and Tripoli. He returned home in 1166, and adopted a date palm as his seal, with a crown of laurels on the reverse.

==Death==
Thierry died on 17 January 1168 and was buried in the Abbey of Watten, between Saint-Omer and Gravelines. His rule had been moderate and peaceful; the highly developed administration of the county in later centuries first began during these years. There had also been great economic and agricultural development, and new commercial enterprises were established; Flanders&#x27; greatest territorial expansion occurred under Theoderic.

==Family==
Theirry&#x27;s first wife, Margaret of Clermont (or Swanhilde), died in 1132, leaving only one daughter:

#Laurette of Flanders, who married four times: Iwain, Count of Aalst; Henry II, Duke of Limburg; Raoul I of Vermandois, Count of Vermandois; and Henry IV of Luxembourg. Laurette finally retired to a nunnery, where she died in 1170.

Theoderic secondly married Sibylla of Anjou, daughter of Fulk V of Anjou and Ermengarde of Maine, and former bride of William Clito. Their children were:

#Philip I (died 1191)
#Matthew (died 1173), married Countess Marie I of Boulogne
#Margaret I (died 1194), married Ralph II, count of Vermandois and Valois (died 1167, son of Ralph I), and then she married Baldwin V, Count of Hainaut
#Gertrude (died 1186), married Humbert III of Savoy
#Matilda, abbess of Fontevrault
#Peter (died 1176), elected but never consecrated bishop of Cambrai

<doc id="360334" wikidata="Q2660320" url="?curid=360334" title="Bankside">
<text>Bankside is an area of London, England, within the London Borough of Southwark. Bankside is located on the southern bank of the River Thames, east of Charing Cross, running from a little west of Blackfriars Bridge to just a short distance before London Bridge at St Mary Overie Dock. It is part of a business improvement district known as &#x27;Better Bankside&#x27;.

==History==
===Toponymy===
The &#x27;banke&#x27; was reclaimed by the Bishop of Winchester who owned the manor of the Clink of which this is part. There is a map plan in the Duchy of Lancaster archive showing &#x27;the way to the banke&#x27;. The name is recorded in 1554 as &quot;the Banke syde&quot; and means &#x27;street along the bank of the Thames&#x27;. In 1860 Southwark Street was created to connect the Blackfriars and London bridge crossings here and that can be regarded as the area&#x27;s informal southern perimeter.

===Urban development===
Bankside is the riverside of the former liberties of the Clink and Paris Garden. In the Elizabethan period, because it was outside the City of London and its authority, the area of the Clink and Paris Garden became occupied by the bear baiting pits and playhouses, including the Rose, the Hope Theatre, the Swan and the Globe Theatre of which a replica was constructed in the late 1990s. The history of the area is traced in a study that traces the earliest known history of a particular building on Bankside until the present day. It has experienced regeneration in recent decades, becoming a significant tourist destination, and forms a business improvement district. The skyline of Bankside is dominated by the former Bankside Power Station, which now houses the Tate Modern.

A major new development in the area is the Bankside 1/2/3 complex on Southwark Street. Together, these three buildings house about 5,000 employees. Bankside 1, also known as the Blue Fin Building, was built for and partially occupied by IPC Media, while Bankside 2 and 3 are occupied by The Omnicom Group Ltd. The architect for the buildings was Allies and Morrison.

==Governance==
It is part of the Borough and Bankside Community Council which corresponds to the Southwark electoral wards of Cathedrals and Chaucer. They are part of the Bermondsey and Old Southwark Parliament constituency and the Member of Parliament is Labour&#x27;s Neil Coyle. It is within the Lambeth and Southwark London Assembly constituency.

==Transport==
Since 1754 the Blackfriars Bridge has formed a connection to the north and in 1819 Southwark Bridge has connected the area into the City. In 2000 a direct pedestrian connection was opened between the Tate Modern and St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral via the Millennium Bridge, which also hosts two Cycle Hire stations. 

Blackfriars station on the City side north bank of the river was redeveloped as part of the Thameslink Programme and opened a Bankside entrance in 2012. London Bridge and Southwark are the other stations closest to Bankside, located to the east and south of it respectively. It is served by bus routes 381 and RV1 which are hydrogen powered.

<doc id="360336" wikidata="Q469588" url="?curid=360336" title="Philip I, Count of Flanders">
<text>Philip I (1143 – 1 August 1191), commonly known as Philip of Alsace, was count of Flanders from 1168 to 1191. During his rule Flanders prospered economically. He took part in two crusades and died of disease in the Holy Land.

==Count of Flanders==

Philip was born in 1143 as the son of Count Thierry of Flanders and Sibylla of Anjou. His reign began at the age of 14 in 1157, while he acted as regent and co-count for his father, who had returned to the Kingdom of Jerusalem in 1156 after participating the Second Crusade. He defeated Count Floris III of Holland, who was captured in Bruges and remained in prison until 1167, at which point he was being ransomed in exchange for recognition of Flemish suzerainty over Zeeland. By inheritance, Philip also recovered for Flanders the territories of Waasland and Quatre-Métiers.

In 1159, Philip married Elisabeth, elder daughter of count Ralph I of Vermandois and Petronilla of Aquitaine. Upon the abdication of his brother-in-law Ralph II in 1167, Elisabeth and Philip inherited the County of Vermandois. This pushed Flemish authority further south, to its greatest extent thus far, and threatened to completely alter the balance of power in northern France.
Philip governed wisely with the aid of Robert d&#x27;Aire, whose role was almost that of a prime minister. They established an effective administrative system and Philip&#x27;s foreign relations were excellent. He mediated in disputes between Louis VII of France and Henry II of England, between Henry II and Thomas Becket, and arranged the marriage of his sister Margaret with Count Baldwin V of Hainaut.

Philip and Elisabeth were childless. In 1175, Philip discovered that Elisabeth was committing adultery and had her lover, Walter de Fontaines, beaten to death. Philip then obtained complete control of her lands in Vermandois from King Louis VII of France. Philip&#x27;s brothers Matthew and Peter of Alsace also died in 1177, before going on crusade, he designated Margaret and Baldwin as his heirs.

==Philip&#x27;s first crusade==

In the Holy Land, King Baldwin IV of Jerusalem hoped that Philip would take part in a planned invasion of Egypt, for which purpose the crusaders had allied with the Byzantine Empire. A Byzantine fleet of 150 galleys was waiting at Acre when Philip arrived on 2 August 1177. Philip had other plans, however. He and King Baldwin IV of Jerusalem were first cousins, sharing a grandfather, King Fulk, whose daughter from his first marriage, Sibylla of Anjou, was Philip&#x27;s mother. Baldwin IV was a leper and childless, and offered Philip the regency of the Kingdom of Jerusalem as his closest male relative currently present there. Philip refused both this and the command of the army of the kingdom, saying he was there only as a pilgrim. Instead Baldwin appointed Raynald of Châtillon, to whom Philip would act as an assistant. As William of Tyre says, &quot;this being the situation, the count at last revealed the secret thought of his mind and did not try to conceal to what end all his plans were.&quot; He had come to have his own vassals married to his cousins, Baldwin&#x27;s sister Sibylla and half-sister Isabella.

Sibylla&#x27;s husband William of Montferrat had just died, leaving her pregnant with the future Baldwin V. William of Tyre, the chief negotiator in this dispute, told the count it would be improper to marry her off again so soon. According to the chronicle of Ernoul, Philip was also rebuffed by Raymond III of Tripoli, who also claimed the regency, as well as by Raymond&#x27;s supporters from the Ibelins, who hoped to marry the princesses into their own family. Baldwin of Ibelin insulted the count in public. Philip left Jerusalem in October to campaign in the north for the Principality of Antioch, participating in an unsuccessful siege of Harim before returning home. Meanwhile, the Byzantine alliance against Egypt was abandoned. In November, Baldwin IV and Raynald defeated Saladin at the Battle of Montgisard.

==War with France==

Philip returned from the holy land in 1179, at which point Louis VII, now sick, named him guardian of his young son Philip II. One year later, Philip of Alsace had his protégé married to his niece, Isabelle of Hainaut, offering the County of Artois and other Flemish territories as dowry, much to the dismay of Baldwin V. When Louis VII died, Philip II began to assert his independence. War broke out in 1180. Picardy and Île-de-France were devastated. King Philip refused to give open battle and gained the upper hand. Baldwin V, at first allied with his brother-in-law, intervened in 1184 on behalf of his son-in-law, King Philip, in support of his daughter&#x27;s interests. The dispute between Count Philip and Baldwin was encouraged by King Philip, who went so far as to name Baldwin his representative in negotiations with the Count.

Philip&#x27;s wife, Elisabeth, died in 1183, prompting King Philip II to seize the province of Vermandois on behalf of Elisabeth&#x27;s sister, Eleonore. Philip then remarried, to Theresa, daughter of Afonso I, the first King of Portugal. Philip gave Theresa a dower that included a number of major Flemish towns, in an apparent slight to Baldwin V. Fearing that he would be surrounded by the royal domain of France and the County of Hainaut, Philip signed a peace treaty with King Philip II and Count Baldwin V on 10 March 1186, recognizing the cession of Vermandois to the king, although he was allowed to retain the title Count of Vermandois for the remainder of his life.

==Philip&#x27;s second crusade==

In 1190, Philip took the cross for a second time and joined the Flemish contingents which had already gone to Palestine. After arriving at the Siege of Acre, he was stricken by the epidemic passing through the crusader camp, and died on 1 August 1191. His body was brought back to Flanders by his wife Theresa, who acted as regent during his absence. Philip was buried in Clairvaux Abbey. Since he was unsuccessful in producing an heir with Countess Theresa, he was succeeded by his sister Margaret I and brother-in-law Baldwin VIII.

Philip had an illegitimate son, Thierry, who went on the Fourth Crusade and married the daughter of Isaac Komnenos of Cyprus.
==Legacy==

Philip seems to represent the end of one kind of feudal world and the beginning of a new type of sovereignty, put into practice by King Philip: for the first time, a king of France ruled over a count of Flanders. Despite a costly war, the economic expansion of Flanders did not stop, as witnessed by the number of communal charters signed by Count Philip. By the end of his reign, the county had entered into a period of unprecedented prosperity.

Philip may have been the patron of Chrétien de Troyes while he was writing his last romance, &quot;Perceval, the Story of the Grail&quot;. In the opening lines, Chrétien honours Philip with &quot;excessive praise&quot; (Roach, Frappier, Hilka, et al.) for providing him with the book he adapted into the &quot;best tale ever told in a royal court&quot;. The work, which was obviously begun sometime before Philip&#x27;s death, remains unfinished.

<text>In the maintenance of file systems, defragmentation is a process that reduces the degree of fragmentation. It does this by physically organizing the contents of the mass storage device used to store files into the smallest number of contiguous regions (fragments, &quot;extents&quot;). It also attempts to create larger regions of free space using compaction to impede the return of fragmentation.

Defragmentation is advantageous and relevant to file systems on electromechanical disk drives (hard disk drives, floppy disk drives and optical disk media). The movement of the hard drive&#x27;s read/write heads over different areas of the disk when accessing fragmented files is slower, compared to accessing the entire contents of a non-fragmented file sequentially without moving the read/write heads to seek other fragments.

== Causes of fragmentation ==

Fragmentation occurs when the file system cannot or will not allocate enough contiguous space to store a complete file as a unit, but instead puts parts of it in gaps between existing files (usually those gaps exist because they formerly held a file that the file system has subsequently deleted or because the file system allocated excess space for the file in the first place). Files that are often appended to (as with log files) as well as the frequent adding and deleting of files (as with emails and web browser cache), larger files (as with videos) and greater numbers of files contribute to fragmentation and consequent performance loss. Defragmentation attempts to alleviate these problems.

=== Example ===
An otherwise blank disk has five files, A through E, each using 10 blocks of space (for this section, a &quot;block&quot; is an allocation unit of the filesystem; the block size is set when the disk is formatted and can be any size supported by the filesystem). On a blank disk, all of these files would be allocated one after the other (see example 1 in the image). If file B were to be deleted, there would be two options: mark the space for file B as empty to be used again later, or move all the files after B so that the empty space is at the end. Since moving the files could be time-consuming if there were many files which needed to be moved, usually the empty space is simply left there, marked in a table as available for new files (see example 2 in the image). When a new file, F, is allocated requiring 6 blocks of space, it could be placed into the first 6 blocks of the space that formerly held file B, and the 4 blocks following it will remain available (see example 3 in the image). If another new file, G, is added and needs only 4 blocks, it could then occupy the space after F and before C (example 4 in the image).

However, if file F then needs to be expanded, there are three options, since the space immediately following it is no longer available:

# Move the file F to where it can be created as one contiguous file of the new, larger size. This would not be possible if the file is larger than the largest contiguous space available. The file could also be so large that the operation would take an undesirably long period of time. 
# Move all the files after F until one opens enough space to make it contiguous again. This presents the same problem as in the previous example: if there are a small number of files or not much data to move, it isn&#x27;t a big problem, but if there are thousands or even tens of thousands of files, there isn&#x27;t enough time to move all those files.
# Add a new block somewhere else, and indicate that F has a second &quot;extent&quot; (see example 5 in the image). Repeat this hundreds of times and the filesystem will have a number of small free segments scattered in many places, and some files will have multiple extents. When a file has many extents like this, access time for that file may become excessively long because of all the random seeking the disk will have to do when reading it.

Additionally, the concept of “fragmentation” is not only limited to individual files that have multiple extents on the disk. For instance, a group of files normally read in a particular sequence (like files accessed by a program when it is loading, which can include certain DLLs, various resource files, the audio/visual media files in a game) can be considered fragmented if they are not in sequential load-order on the disk, even if these individual files are &quot;not&quot; fragmented; the read/write heads will have to seek these (non-fragmented) files randomly to access them in sequence. Some groups of files may have been originally installed in the correct sequence, but drift apart with time as certain files within the group are deleted. Updates are a common cause of this, because in order to update a file, most updaters usually delete the old file first, and then write a new, updated one in its place. However, most filesystems do not write the new file in the same physical place on the disk. This allows unrelated files to fill in the empty spaces left behind.

== Mitigation ==
Defragmentation is the operation of moving file extents (physical allocation blocks) so they eventually merge, preferably into one. Doing so usually requires at least two copy operations: one to move the blocks into some free scratch space on the disk so more movement can happen, and another to finally move the blocks into their intended place. In such a paradigm, no data is ever removed from the disk, so that the operation can be safely stopped even in the event of a power loss. The article picture depicts an example.

To defragment a disk, defragmentation software (also known as a &quot;defragmenter&quot;) can only move files around within the free space available. This is an intensive operation and cannot be performed on a filesystem with little or no free space. During defragmentation, system performance will be degraded, and it is best to leave the computer alone during the process so that the defragmenter does not get confused by unexpected changes to the filesystem. Depending on the algorithm used it may or may not be advantageous to perform multiple passes. The reorganization involved in defragmentation does not change logical location of the files (defined as their location within the directory structure).

Besides defragmenting program files, the defragmenting tool can also reduce the time it takes to load programs and open files. For example, the Windows 9x defragmenter included the Intel Application Launch Accelerator which optimized programs on the disk by placing the defragmented program files and their dependencies next to each other, in the order in which the program loads them, to load these programs faster. In Windows, a good defragmenter will read the Prefetch files to identify as many of these file groups as possible and place the files within them in access sequence.

At the beginning of the hard drive, the outer tracks have a higher data transfer rate than the inner tracks. Placing frequently accessed files onto the outer tracks increases performance. Third party defragmenters, such as MyDefrag, will move frequently accessed files onto the outer tracks and defragment these files.

Improvements in modern hard drives such as RAM cache, faster platter rotation speed, command queuing (SCSI/ATA TCQ or SATA NCQ), and greater data density reduce the negative impact of fragmentation on system performance to some degree, though increases in commonly used data quantities offset those benefits. However, modern systems profit enormously from the huge disk capacities currently available, since partially filled disks fragment much less than full disks, and on a high-capacity HDD, the same partition occupies a smaller range of cylinders, resulting in faster seeks. However, the average access time can never be lower than a half rotation of the platters, and platter rotation (measured in rpm) is the speed characteristic of HDDs which has experienced the slowest growth over the decades (compared to data transfer rate and seek time), so minimizing the number of seeks remains beneficial in most storage-heavy applications. Defragmentation is just that: ensuring that there is at most one seek per file, counting only the seeks to non-adjacent tracks.

===Partitioning===
A common strategy to optimize defragmentation and to reduce the impact of fragmentation is to partition the hard disk(s) in a way that separates partitions of the file system that experience many more reads than writes from the more volatile zones where files are created and deleted frequently. The directories that contain the users&#x27; profiles are modified constantly (especially with the Temp directory and web browser cache creating thousands of files that are deleted in a few days). If files from user profiles are held on a dedicated partition (as is commonly done on UNIX recommended files systems, where it is typically stored in the /var partition), the defragmenter runs better since it does not need to deal with all the static files from other directories. (Alternatively, a defragmenter can be told to simply exclude certain file paths.) For partitions with relatively little write activity, defragmentation time greatly improves after the first defragmentation, since the defragmenter will need to defragment only a small number of new files in the future.

=== Offline defragmentation ===
The presence of immovable system files, especially a swap file, can impede defragmentation. These files can be safely moved when the operating system is not in use. For example, ntfsresize moves these files to resize an NTFS partition. The tool PageDefrag could defragment Windows system files such as the swap file and the files that store the Windows registry by running at boot time before the GUI is loaded. Since Windows Vista, the feature is not fully supported and has not been updated.

In NTFS, as files are added to the disk, the Master File Table (MFT) must grow to store the information for the new files. Every time the MFT cannot be extended due to some file being in the way, the MFT will gain a fragment. In early versions of Windows, it could not be safely defragmented while the partition was mounted, and so Microsoft wrote a hardblock in the defragmenting API. However, since Windows XP, an increasing number of defragmenters are now able to defragment the MFT, because the Windows defragmentation API has been improved and now supports that move operation. Even with the improvements, the first four clusters of the MFT remain unmovable by the Windows defragmentation API, resulting in the fact that some defragmenters will store the MFT in two fragments: The first four clusters wherever they were placed when the disk was formatted, and then the rest of the MFT at the beginning of the disk (or wherever the defragmenter&#x27;s strategy deems to be the best place).

===Solid-state disks===
When reading data from a conventional electromechanical hard disk drive, the disk controller must first position the head, relatively slowly, to the track where a given fragment resides, and then wait while the disk platter rotates until the fragment reaches the head. A solid-state drive (SSD) is based on flash memory with no moving parts, so random access of a file fragment on flash memory does not suffer this delay, making defragmentation to optimize access speed unnecessary. Furthermore, since flash memory can be written to only a limited number of times before it fails, defragmentation is actually detrimental (except in the mitigation of catastrophic failure). However, Windows still defragments an SSD automatically (albeit less vigorously) to prevent the file system from reaching its maximum fragmentation tolerance (when the metadata can’t represent any more file fragments). Once the maximum fragmentation limit is reached, subsequent attempts to write to disk fail.

==Approach and defragmenters by file-system type==

* FAT: MS-DOS 6.x and Windows 9x-systems come with a defragmentation utility called Defrag. The DOS version is a limited version of Norton SpeedDisk. The version that came with Windows 9x was licensed from Symantec Corporation, and the version that came with Windows 2000 and XP is licensed from Condusiv Technologies.
* NTFS was introduced with Windows NT 3.1, but the NTFS filesystem driver did not include any defragmentation capabilities. In Windows NT 4.0, defragmenting APIs were introduced that third-party tools could use to perform defragmentation tasks; however, no defragmentation software was included. In Windows 2000, Windows XP and Windows Server 2003, Microsoft included a defragmentation tool based on Diskeeper that made use of the defragmentation APIs and was a snap-in for Computer Management. In Windows Vista, Windows 7 and Windows 8, the tool has been greatly improved and was given a new interface with no visual diskmap and is no longer part of Computer Management. There are also a number of free and commercial third-party defragmentation products available for Microsoft Windows.
* BSD UFS and particularly FreeBSD uses an internal reallocator that seeks to reduce fragmentation right in the moment when the information is written to disk. This effectively controls system degradation after extended use.
* Btrfs has online and automatic defragmentation available.
* Linux ext2, ext3, and ext4: Much like UFS, these filesystems employ allocation techniques designed to keep fragmentation under control at all times. As a result, defragmentation is not needed in the vast majority of cases. ext2 uses an offline defragmenter called codice_1, which does not work with its successor ext3. However, other programs, or filesystem-independent ones such as codice_2, may be used to defragment an ext3 filesystem. ext4 is somewhat backward compatible with ext3, and thus has generally the same amount of support from defragmentation programs. Currently e4defrag can be used to defragment an ext4 filesystem, including online defragmentation.
* VxFS has the codice_3 utility that includes defrag operations.
* JFS has the codice_2 utility on IBM operating systems.
* HFS Plus introduced in 1998 with Mac OS 8.1 has a number of optimizations to the allocation algorithms in an attempt to defragment files while they are being accessed without a separate defragmenter. There are several restrictions for files to be candidates for &#x27;on-the-fly&#x27; defragmentation (including a maximum size 20MB). There is a utility, , by Coriolis Systems available since OS X 10.3. On traditional Mac OS defragmentation can be done by Norton SpeedDisk and TechTool Pro.
* WAFL in NetApp&#x27;s ONTAP 7.2 operating system has a command called codice_5 that is designed to defragment large files.
* XFS provides an online defragmentation utility called codice_6.
* SFS processes the defragmentation feature in almost completely stateless way (apart from the location it is working on), so defragmentation can be stopped and started instantly.
* ADFS, the file system used by RISC OS and earlier Acorn Computers, keeps file fragmentation under control without requiring manual defragmentation.

<text>André Kertész (; 2 July 1894 – 28 September 1985), born Andor Kertész, was a Hungarian-born photographer known for his groundbreaking contributions to photographic composition and the photo essay. In the early years of his career, his then-unorthodox camera angles and style prevented his work from gaining wider recognition. Kertész never felt that he had gained the worldwide recognition he deserved. Today he is considered one of the seminal figures of 20th century photography.

Expected by his family to work as a stockbroker, Kertész pursued photography independently as an autodidact, and his early work was published primarily in magazines, a major market in those years. This continued until much later in his life, when Kertész stopped accepting commissions. He served briefly in World War I and moved to Paris in 1925, then the artistic capital of the world, against the wishes of his family. In Paris he worked for France&#x27;s first illustrated magazine called &quot;VU&quot;. Involved with many young immigrant artists and the Dada movement, he achieved critical and commercial success.

Due to German persecution of the Jews and the threat of World War II, Kertész decided to emigrate to the United States in 1936, where he had to rebuild his reputation through commissioned work. In the 1940s and 1950s, he stopped working for magazines and began to achieve greater international success. His career is generally divided into four periods, based on where he was working and his work was most prominently known. They are called the Hungarian period, the French period, the American period and, toward the end of his life, the International period.

== Biography ==

===Early life and education===
Andor Kertész was born on 2 July 1894 in Budapest to the middle-class Jewish family of Lipót Kertész, a bookseller, and his wife, Ernesztin Hoffmann. Andor, known as &quot;Bandi&quot; to his friends, was the middle child of three sons, including Imre and Jenő. When Lipót died in 1908 from tuberculosis, the widowed Ernesztin was without a source of income to support their three children. Ernesztin&#x27;s brother, Lipót Hoffmann, provided for the family and acted much like a father to the boys. The family soon moved to Hoffman&#x27;s country property in Szigetbecse. Kertész grew up in a leisurely pace of life and pastoral setting that would shape his later career path.

Hoffman paid for his middle nephew&#x27;s business classes at the Academy of Commerce until his 1912 graduation, and arranged his hiring by the stock exchange soon after. Unlike his older brother Imre, who worked at the exchange in Budapest for all his life, Kertész had little interest in the field. He was drawn to illustrated magazines and to activities like fishing and swimming in the Danube River near his uncle&#x27;s property.

Kertész&#x27;s first encounters with magazine photography inspired him to learn photography. He was also influenced by certain paintings by Lajos Tihanyi and Gyula Zilzer, as well as by poetry.

===Hungarian period===

After earning enough money, Kertész quickly bought his first camera (an ICA box camera) in 1912, despite his family&#x27;s protests to continue his career in business. In his free time, he photographed the local peasants, Romani people, and landscape of the surrounding Hungarian Plains (the &quot;puszta&quot;). His first photograph is believed to be &quot;Sleeping Boy, Budapest, 1912&quot;. His photographs were first published in 1917 in the magazine &quot;Érdekes Újság&quot;, during World War I, while Kertész was serving in the Austro-Hungarian army. As early as 1914 (for example, &quot;Eugene, 1914&quot;), his distinctive and mature style was already evident.

In 1914, at the age of 20, he was sent to the frontline, where he took photographs of life in the trenches with a lightweight camera (a Goerz Tenax). Most of these photographs were destroyed during the violence of the Hungarian Revolution of 1919. Wounded in 1915 by a bullet, Kertész suffered temporary paralysis of his left arm.

He was sent for convalescence to a military hospital in Budapest, but was later transferred to Esztergom, where he continued to take photographs. These included a self-portrait for a competition in the magazine &quot;Borsszem Jankó&quot;. His most famous piece of this period was &quot;Underwater Swimmer, Esztergom, 1917&quot;, the only surviving work of a series of a swimmer whose image is distorted by the water. Kertész explored the subject more thoroughly in his series of &quot;Distortions&quot; photographs during the early 1930s.

Kertész did not heal soon enough to return to combat, and with peace in 1918, he returned to the stock exchange. There he met his future wife Erzsebet Salomon (later changed to Elizabeth Saly, also spelled Sali), who also worked at the exchange. He began to pursue her romantically. During this period of work and throughout his whole career, he used Elizabeth as a model for his photographs. Kertész also took numerous photographs of his brother Jenő. Kertész left his career at the exchange to try agricultural work and beekeeping during the early 1920s. This venture was brief given the political turmoil that accompanied the revolution and coming of communism.

After returning to the stock exchange, Kertész decided to emigrate, to study at one of France&#x27;s photographic schools. His mother dissuaded him, and he did not emigrate for several years. Working during the day at the exchange, he pursued photography the rest of the time.

In 1923, the Hungarian Amateur Photographer&#x27;s Association selected one of his photographs for its silver award, on the condition that he print it by the bromoil process. Kertész disliked this, so turned down the medal. Instead, he was given a diploma from the association. On its 26 June 1925, the Hungarian news magazine &quot;Érdekes Újság&quot; used one of his photographs for its cover, giving him widespread publicity. By that time, Kertész was determined to photograph the sights in Paris and join its artistic culture.

===French period===
Kertész emigrated to Paris in September 1925, leaving behind his mother, his unofficial fiancée Elizabeth, both brothers, and his uncle Hoffman, who died shortly afterward. Jenő later emigrated to Argentina. Elizabeth Kertész remained until her future husband was well enough established in Paris that they could marry. Kertész was among numerous Hungarian artists, including François Kollar, Robert Capa, Emeric Fehér, Brassaï, and Julia Bathory. Man Ray, Germaine Krull and Lucien Aigner, who also emigrated to Paris during this period.

Initially Kertész took on commissioned work for several European magazines, gaining publication of his work in Germany, France, Italy and Great Britain. Soon after arriving in Paris, Kertész changed his first name to André, which he kept for the rest of his life. In Paris he found critical and commercial success. In 1927 Kertész was the first photographer to have a one-man exhibition; Jan Slivinsky presented 30 of his photographs at the &quot;Sacre du Printemps Gallery&quot;. Kertész had become connected with members of the growing Dada movement. Paul Dermée dubbed him &quot;Brother Seer&quot; and &quot;Brother Seeing Eye&quot; during his first solo exhibit, alluding to a medieval monastery where all the monks were blind bar one. Over the next years, Kertész was featured in both solo exhibits and group shows. In 1932 at the Julien Levy Gallery in New York, the price of Kertész&#x27;s proofs was set at US$20 ($  in 2025), a large sum of money during the Great Depression.

Kertész and other Hungarian artists formed a synergistic circle; he was featured in exhibits with some of them later in his life. Visiting his sculptor friends, he was fascinated by the Cubism movement. He created photo portraits of painters Piet Mondrian and Marc Chagall, the writer Colette, and film-maker Sergei Eisenstein. In 1928, Kertész switched from using plate-glass cameras to a Leica. This period of work was one of his most productive; he was photographing daily, with work divided between magazine commissions through the late 1920s and his personal pieces. In 1930, at the &quot;Exposition Coloniale&quot; in Paris, Kertész was awarded a silver medal for services to photography.
Kertész was published in French magazines such as &quot;Vu&quot; and &quot;Art et Médecine&quot;, for which his work was used for numerous covers. His greatest journalistic collaboration was with Lucien Vogel, the French editor and publisher of &quot;Vu&quot;. Vogel published his work as photo essays, letting Kertész report on various subjects through images. The photographer was intrigued with the variety of topics assigned by Vogel.

In 1933 Kertész was commissioned for the series, &quot;Distortion&quot;, about 200 photographs of Najinskaya Verackhatz and Nadia Kasine, two models portrayed nude and in various poses, with their reflections caught in a combination of distortion mirrors, similar to a carnival&#x27;s house of mirrors. In some photographs, only certain limbs or features were visible in the reflection. Some images also appeared in the 2 March issue of the &quot;girly magazine&quot; &quot;Le Sourire&quot; and in the 15 September 1933 issue of &quot;Arts et métiers graphiques&quot;. Later that year, Kertész published the book &quot;Distortions&quot;, a collection of the work.

In 1933 Kertész published his first personal book of photographs, &quot;Enfants&quot;, dedicated to his fiancée Elizabeth and his mother, who had died that year. He published regularly during the succeeding years. &quot;Paris&quot; (1934) was dedicated to his brothers Imre and Jenő. &quot;Nos Amies les bêtes&quot; (&quot;Our Friends the Animals&quot;) was released in 1936 and &quot;Les Cathédrales du vin&quot; (&quot;The Cathedrals of Wine&quot;) in 1937.

===Marriage and family===
In the late 1920s, Kertész secretly married the French portrait photographer Rosza Klein (she used the name Rogi André). The marriage was short-lived and he never spoke about it.

In 1930, he ventured back to Hungary to visit his family. After his return to Paris, Elizabeth followed him in 1931, despite opposition by her family. Elizabeth and André remained together for the rest of their lives. Despite his mother&#x27;s dying in early 1933, Kertész married Elizabeth on 17 June 1933. He was said to have spent less time with his artist friends in favor of his new wife.

In 1936 they emigrated to New York, where within a decade, they became naturalized citizens. After creating and running a successful cosmetic business for years, in 1977 Elizabeth died of cancer.

===Pending war===
Social and political tensions were rising in Europe with the growing strength in Germany of the Nazi Party. Many magazines emphasized stories about political topics and stopped publishing Kertész because of his apolitical subjects. With his commissioned work dropping and persecution of Jews increasing, Kertész and Elizabeth decided to move to New York. He was offered work at the Keystone agency owned by Ernie Prince. In 1936, Kertész and Elizabeth boarded the SS &quot;Washington&quot; bound for Manhattan.
The couple arrived in New York on 15 October 1936, with Kertész intent on finding fame in America. They lived at the Beaux Arts Hotel in Greenwich Village. Kertész found life in America more difficult than he had imagined, beginning a period which he later referred to as the &quot;absolute tragedy&quot;. Deprived of his artist friends, he also found that Americans rejected having their photos taken on the street. Soon after his arrival, Kertész approached Beaumont Newhall, director of the photographic department at the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA), who was preparing a show entitled &quot;Photography 1839–1937&quot;. Offering Newhall some of his &quot;Distortions&quot; photographs, Kertész bristled at his criticism, but Newhall did exhibit the photographs. In December 1937 Kertész had his first solo show in New York at the PM Gallery.

The Keystone agency, who had offered him offsite work, required him to stay in the company&#x27;s studio. Kertész tried to return to France to visit, but had no money. By the time he had saved enough, World War II had begun and travel to France was nearly impossible. His struggles with English compounded his problems. Years after learning to speak French in Paris, it was difficult for him to learn another new language. The lack of fluent language added to his feeling like an outsider.

Frustrated, Kertész left Keystone after Prince left the company in 1937. He was commissioned by &quot;Harper&#x27;s Bazaar&quot; for an article on the Saks Fifth Avenue department store in their April 1937 issue. The magazine continued to use him in further issues, and he also took commissions from &quot;Town and Country&quot; to supplement his income. &quot;Vogue&quot; invited the photographer to work for the magazine, but he declined, believing it was not appropriate work for him. He chose to work for &quot;Life&quot; magazine, starting with a piece called &quot;The Tugboat&quot;. Despite orders, he photographed more than just tugboats, including works on the entire harbor and its activities. &quot;Life&quot; refused to publish the unauthorized photographs. Kertész resented the constraints on his curiosity.

On 25 October 1938, &quot;Look&quot; printed a series of Kertész photographs, entitled &quot;A Fireman Goes to School&quot;; but credited them mistakenly to Ernie Prince, his former boss. Infuriated, Kertész considered never working with photo magazines again. His work was published in the magazine &quot;Coronet&quot; in 1937, but in 1939 he was excluded when the magazine published a special issue featuring its &quot;Most memorable photographs&quot;. He later severed all ties to the magazine and its editor Arnold Gingrich. After being excluded from the June 1941 issue of &quot;Vogue&quot;, dedicated to photography, Kertész broke off relations with them. He had contributed to more than 30 commissioned photo essays and articles in both &quot;Vogue&quot; and &quot;House and Garden&quot;, but was omitted from the list of featured photographers.

In 1941, the Kertész couple were designated as enemy aliens because of World War II (Hungary was fighting on the side of the Axis powers). Kertész was not permitted to photograph outdoors or to have any project related to national security. Trying to avoid trouble because Elizabeth had started a cosmetics company (&quot;Cosmia Laboratories&quot;), Kertész ceased to do commissioned work and essentially disappeared from the photographic world for three years.

On 20 January 1944, Elizabeth became a US citizen; and Kertész was naturalized on 3 February. Despite competition from photographers such as Irving Penn, Kertész regained commissioned work. He was omitted from the list of 63 photographers which &quot;Vogue&#x27;s&quot; identified as significant in its &quot;photographic genealogical tree&quot;. But, &quot;House and Garden&quot; commissioned him to do photographs for a Christmas issue. In addition, in June 1944 László Moholy-Nagy, director of the New Bauhaus – American School of Design offered him a position teaching photography. Despite the honor, he turned the offer down.

In 1945, Kertész released a new book, &quot;Day of Paris&quot;, made up of photographs taken just before his emigration from France. It gained critical success. With his wife&#x27;s cosmetic business booming, Kertész agreed in 1946 to a long-term, exclusive contract with &quot;House and Garden&quot;. Although it restricted his editorial freedom and required many hours in the studio, the pay of at least US$10,000 per annum ($  per year in 2025) was satisfactory. All photographic negatives were returned to him within six months for his own use.

Kertész worked in the settings of many famous homes and notable places, as well as overseas, where he traveled again in England, Budapest and Paris, renewing friendships and making new ones. During the 1945–62 period at &quot;House and Garden&quot;, the magazine published more than 3,000 of his photographs, and he created a high reputation in the industry. With little time for his personal work, Kertész felt starved of being able to exercise more artistic creativity.

=== Later life ===

In 1946, Kertész had a solo exhibition at the Art Institute of Chicago, featuring photographs from his &quot;Day of Paris&quot; series. Kertész said this was one of his greatest times in the United States. In 1952, he and his wife moved to a 12th-floor apartment at 2 Fifth Avenue near Washington Square Park, the setting for some of his best photographs since having immigrated to the US. Using a telephoto lens, he took a series of snow-covered Washington Square, showing numerous silhouettes and tracks. In 1955 he was insulted to have his work excluded when Edward Steichen&#x27;s &quot;The Family of Man&quot; show was featured at MoMA. Despite the success of the Chicago show, Kertész did not gain another exhibit until 1962, when his photographs were shown at Long Island University.

Kertész lived at 2 Fifth Avenue during the construction and inauguration of the former World Trade Center. He photographed the Twin Towers from his apartment on multiple occasions prior to his death.

===International period===

Toward the end of 1961, Kertész broke his contract to Condé Nast Publishing after a minor dispute, and started doing his own work again. This later period of his life is often referred to as the &quot;International period&quot;, when he gained worldwide recognition and his photos were exhibited in many countries. In 1962 his work was exhibited in Venice; in 1963, he was one of the invited artists of the &quot;IV Mostra Biennale Internazionale della Fotografia&quot; there and he was awarded a gold medal for his dedication to the photographic industry. Later in 1963, his work was shown in Paris at the Bibliothèque nationale de France. He later visited Argentina to see his younger brother Jenő for the first time in years. Kertész experimented with color photographs, but only produced a few.

In 1964, soon after John Szarkowski became the photography director at the Museum of Modern Art, he featured Kertész in a solo show. With his work critically acclaimed, Kertész gained recognition in the photographic world as an important artist. 
The work of Kertész was featured in numerous exhibitions throughout the world in his later life, even into his early nineties. Due to his newfound success, in 1965 Kertész was appointed as a member of the American Society of Media Photographers.

His awards rapidly accumulated. In 1974 he received a Guggenheim Fellowship; in 1974 he was awarded Commander of the French Ordre des Arts et des Lettres; in 1977 he received the Mayor&#x27;s Award of Honor for Arts and Culture in New York; in 1980 he received the Medal of the City of Paris, and the first Annual Award of the Association of International Photography Art Dealers in New York; and in 1981 he received an honorary Doctorate of Fine Arts from Bard College, and the New York Mayor&#x27;s Award of Honor for Arts and Culture.

During this period, Kertész produced a number of new books. He was able to recover some of the negatives he had left in France decades before.
Despite his successes, Kertész still felt unrecognised as a photographer. His last years were spent travelling to various locations around the globe for his exhibitions, especially Japan, and rekindling friendships with other artists. To deal with the loss of his wife in 1977, Kertész fell back on his new network of friends, often visiting them to talk. By this time, he was said to have learned basic English and talked in what his friends called &quot;Kertészian&quot;, a mixture of Hungarian, English and French.

In 1979, the Polaroid Corporation gave him one of their new SX-70 cameras, which he experimented with into the 1980s. Still growing in fame, Kertész was granted the National Grand Prize of Photography in Paris in 1982, as well as the 21st Annual George Washington Award from the American Hungarian Foundation the same year.

In 1980, Kertész sat for Canadian artist Arnaud Maggs, resulting in the large-scale portrait project &quot;André Kertész, 144 Views&quot; (1980). According to Maggs, Kertész described the work as a &quot;portrait mosaic.&quot;

==Critical evaluation==

Throughout most of his career Kertész was depicted as the &quot;unknown soldier&quot; who worked behind the scenes of photography, yet was rarely cited for his work, even up to his death in 1985. Kertész thought himself unrecognised throughout his life, despite spending his life in the eternal search for acceptance and fame. Though Kertész received numerous awards for photography, he never felt both his style and work was accepted by critics and art audiences alike. Although, in 1927, he was the first photographer to have a solo exhibition, Kertész said that it was not until his 1946 exhibition at the Art Institute of Chicago, that he first felt he received positive reviews on his work, and often cites this show as one of his finest moments in America. During his stay in America, he was cited as being an intimate artist, bringing the viewer into his work, even when the picture was that of subjects such as the intimidating New York City and even his reproduced work printed after his death received good reviews; &quot;Kertész was above all a consistently fine photographer&quot;. Kertész&#x27;s work itself is often described as predominantly utilising light and even Kertész himself said that &quot;I write with light&quot;. He was never considered to &quot;comment&quot; on his subjects, but rather capture them – this is often cited as why his work is often overlooked; he stuck to no political agenda and offered no deeper thought to his photographs other than the simplicity of life. With his art&#x27;s intimate feeling and nostalgic tone, Kertész&#x27;s images alluded to a sense of timelessness which was inevitably only recognised after his death. Unlike other photographers, Kertész&#x27;s work gave an insight into his life, showing a chronological order of where he spent his time; for example, many of his French photographs were from cafés where he spent the majority of his time waiting for artistic inspiration.

Although Kertész rarely received bad reviews, it was the lack of commentary that led to the photographer feeling distant from recognition. Now, however, he is often considered to be the father of photojournalism. Even other photographers cite Kertész and his photographs as being inspirational; Henri Cartier-Bresson once said of him in the early 1930s, &quot;We all owe him a great deal.&quot; When he was 90 years old, a person asked him why he was still taking photographs. He replied, &quot;I&#x27;m still hungry.&quot;

<doc id="360350" wikidata="Q1820154" url="?curid=360350" title="Nain Rouge">
<text>The Nain Rouge (French for &quot;red dwarf&quot;) is a legendary creature of the Detroit, Michigan area whose appearance is said to presage misfortune for the white settlers of the area. There are no records that indicate the legend of the Nain Rouge existed prior to the 1880s.

According to various narratives surrounding the figure, Detroit&#x27;s founder Antoine de la Mothe Cadillac was told by a fortuneteller to appease the Nain Rouge, but he instead attacked it with his cane and shouted, &quot;Get out of my way, you red imp!&quot; As a consequence, a string of bad luck befell Cadillac; he was charged with abuse of power and reassigned to Louisiana, later returning to France where he was briefly imprisoned and eventually lost his fortune. The Nain Rouge is also known as &quot;the Demon of the Strait.&quot;

The Nain Rouge legend has become part of contemporary Detroit culture. There are several alcoholic drinks named after the Nain Rouge, and the legend has been the basis for the films &quot;Devil&#x27;s Night: Dawn of the Nain Rouge&quot; and Eric Millikin&#x27;s &quot;The Dance of the Nain Rouge.&quot; Each Spring, there is an event called the &quot;Marche du Nain Rouge&quot; where hundreds of people chase the Nain Rouge out of the city and burn them in effigy.

==Legend==
The Nain Rouge first appeared in Marie Caroline Watson Hamlin&#x27;s 1883 book &quot;Legends of Le Détroit,&quot; where she described the Nain Rouge as a dwarf, &quot;very red in the face, with a bright, glistening eye,&quot; and with &quot;a grinning mouth displaying sharp, pointed teeth&quot;. The Nain Rouge was then included in Charles M. Skinner&#x27;s 1896 book &quot;Myths And Legends Of Our Own Land&quot;, described as &quot;a shambling, red-faced creature, with a cold, glittering eye and teeth protruding from a grinning mouth.&quot;

Legend holds that Nain Rouge&#x27;s appearance would presage terrible events for the white people of the city, and foretell success for the Indigenous People. The creature is said to have appeared on July 30, 1763 before the Battle of Bloody Run, where 58 British soldiers were killed by Native Americans from Chief Pontiac&#x27;s Ottawa tribe. Supposedly, the Nain Rouge &quot;danced among the corpses&quot; on the banks of the Detroit River after the battle, and the river &quot;turned red with blood&quot; for days after. According to the tale, all the misfortunes of Governor and General William Hull leading to the surrender of Detroit in the War of 1812 are blamed on the Nain Rouge.

Several sightings were later reported during the 20th century. Two utility workers claim to have seen the creature just before the 1967 Detroit riots, and supposedly, it was also seen before an ice storm in 1976.

There are no records that indicate the legend of the Nain Rouge existed in the 18th century, when Antoine de la Mothe Cadillac was in authority in Detroit. The earliest record, Hamlin&#x27;s &quot;Legends of Le Détroit&quot;, wasn&#x27;t published until 1883, 180 years after Cadillac was said to have been cursed by the Nain Rouge. However, some claim that it originates in the early 1700s French settlement of Detroit, supposedly deriving from Norman French tales of the lutin, a type of hobgoblin. Some also claim that the Nain Rouge originated with supposed Native American legends of an &quot;impish offspring of the Stone God&quot;.

Wellesley College assistant professor Kate Grandjean, a specialist in early American and Native American history, says &quot;My personal feeling is it&#x27;s really not quite as simple as just European colonists appropriating some Native American spirit ... I think, and it seems to be demonstrable in the historical record, that the Nain that we know in Detroit today probably has both French and Native traditions sort of wrapped up in it.&quot;

Grandjean says the Nain Rouge is a defender of sorts for “those on the losing end of history ... Historically, the Nain Rouge has mostly been a menace to those in power.”

== Local culture ==
The Nain Rouge legend has become an enduring part of the folklore of the Detroit area.

=== Nain Rouge alcoholic drinks ===
Detroit Beer Company, a brewpub in Downtown Detroit, has as its signature brew a &quot;Detroit Dwarf&quot; lager, named in honor of the Nain Rouge. In 2015 Woodberry Wine, a distributor and wholesaler of fine wines and Kindred Vines Import Company, an importer of French and Italian wines both based out of the Metro-Detroit area introduced &quot;Nain Rouge Red&quot;; a French red wine blend named after the Nain Rouge dwarf.

=== &quot;Marche du Nain Rouge&quot; ===
Each Spring since 2010, a costumed parade called the &quot;Marche du Nain Rouge&quot; has been held in Detroit, in which a person dressed like the Nain Rouge is chased out of the city. An effigy of the Nain Rouge is then burned, in what the organizers describe as &quot;banishing the evil spirit from the city for another year&quot;. The parade participants wear masked costumes, supposedly so the Nain Rouge will not recognize them.

Critics have protested the banishment parade, arguing that the Nain Rouge is being unfairly blamed for the city&#x27;s problems, and no one should be banished from the city, particularly those who have been there the longest and who are being targeted based on the color of their skin. One protester has said &quot;Originally the Nain Rouge was a Native American Earth spirit, a protector of Detroit. They turned him into a devil.&quot;

Hundreds of people attend the event. The 2014 parade included a speech from Alexis Wiley, a representative for Mayor Mike Duggan, the first white mayor of the majority-black city since the early 1970s.

=== &quot;Devil&#x27;s Night: Dawn of the Nain Rouge&quot; ===
&quot;Devil&#x27;s Night: Dawn of the Nain Rouge&quot; is a 2019 English language feature film directed by Sam Logan Khaleghi based on the creature of the same name. The film marks the debut of Eminem&#x27;s younger brother Nathan Kane Mathers. Swifty McVay, of the hip hop group D12, played the role of the mayor of Detroit and composed the song “Scariest Thing&quot; for the film.

=== &quot;The Dance of the Nain Rouge&quot; ===
Artist Eric Millikin has been creating work based on the Nain Rouge since at least the early 2000s. His &quot;The Dance of the Nain Rouge is a&quot; 2023 short animated documentary film about the Detroit folklore legend of the Nain Rouge. The film is described as &quot;an experimental decolonial Detroit demonology deepfake dream dance documentary.&quot; It was awarded &quot;Best Animation Film&quot; at the 2024 Absurd Film Festival in Italy.

<doc id="360353" wikidata="Q1757027" url="?curid=360353" title="Portcullis House">
<text>Portcullis House (PCH) is an office building in Westminster, London, England, that was commissioned in 1992 and opened in 2001 to provide offices for 213 members of the Parliament of the United Kingdom and their staff. The public entrance is on the Embankment. Part of the Parliamentary Estate, the building augments limited space in the Palace of Westminster and surroundings.

== History and use ==
The architects, Michael Hopkins and Partners, published their design in 1993 and the existing buildings on the site were demolished in 1994. At the same time, the London Underground was building the Jubilee Line Extension, including a new interchange station at Westminster tube station which occupies the same area; the two were thus designed and built as a single unit. Construction began with works to the existing District line station at sub-basement level. The track had to be lowered slightly and underpinned to allow the extensive excavation to the Jubilee line many feet below. The building above ground began to rise in 1998 and opened in 2001. It is located at the corner of Bridge Street (at the western end of Westminster Bridge) and Victoria Embankment – overlooking the River Thames – and adjacent to the Norman Shaw South Building, which also overlooks the river.
The building is named after the chained portcullis used to symbolize the Houses of Parliament on letterheads and official documents. Portcullis House accommodates about one third of members of parliament; other Members and Parliamentary departments have offices in the two Norman Shaw Buildings (formerly known as Scotland Yard), in the buildings at 1 Parliament Street and at 7 Millbank, and in the Palace of Westminster itself.

The first floor of Portcullis House is open to members of the public to allow attendance at Committee sessions. Throughout the rest of the building, as with the rest of the Parliamentary Estate, members of the public must remain with a passholder. There is a Post Office branch within Portcullis House that is not open to the public.

== Design ==

The building was designed by Michael Hopkins and Partners and incorporates Westminster tube station below it. A thick slab of concrete separates Portcullis House from the station, reportedly to defend against any underground bomb attacks. The load is borne by the walls, without interior posts. The corners of the building are hung from the roof using massive steel beams . The design life of 120 years meant that aluminium bronze was chosen for exposed metal on the roof and walls. The structure also includes granite from Devon and was the last consignment to be excavated at Merrivale Quarry on Dartmoor. The columns between the windows are constructed of post-tensioned Birchover Gritstone.

The building&#x27;s curious profile, with its rows of tall chimneys, is intended to recall the Victorian Gothic design of the Palace of Westminster and to fit in with the chimneys of the Norman Shaw Building next door. Portcullis House&#x27;s chimneys are not used to expel fumes but are part of an unpowered air conditioning system, which is designed to draw air through the building by exploiting natural convection flows. It is based on the system used in 1996 in the Eastgate Centre, Harare, Zimbabwe.

The building itself was designed to look and feel like a ship inside. All the offices and passages are made up with bowed windows and light oak finishing. Each floor looks identical to the others except the ground floor which houses the main courtyard with ship-like metallic sails suspended overhead. The courtyard is decorated with trees and two shallow baths of water.

The offices at Portcullis House are generally in sets of two sharing a common bay in the centre. Each floor is unofficially allocated to a different political party so that generally MPs with similar politics are kept together. The first floor houses a number of conference suites and committee rooms, which are named after famous politicians Betty Boothroyd, Harold Macmillan, Margaret Thatcher, Clement Attlee, Harold Wilson, and Jo Grimond. These Committee rooms are accessible to the public and are fitted with television cameras and microphones, to broadcast the proceedings via BBC Parliament and via parliamentlive.tv.

All rooms in the building are fitted with &quot;annunciators&quot; (monitors which announce in real-time the current business in the Chambers of the House of Commons, the House of Lords, or both). &quot;Division bells&quot; are also installed throughout the building, which alert MPs to the calling of a division (vote) in the Chamber of the House of Commons. Along with this, visual aids (a flashing image of a bell) are displayed on television sets and computer desktops in MPs&#x27; offices when the Division bell sounds.

On the ground floor are a range of services including a waiter-service restaurant (&quot;The Adjournment&quot;), informal cafeteria (&quot;The Debate&quot;) and a coffee shop (&quot;The Despatch Box&quot;), available only to pass holders and their guests. There is also a post office and an &quot;e-library&quot;, an enquiry point where Members and staff can use networked computers, run by the House of Commons Library. There is also an underground passage into the Palace of Westminster and a connection to the 1 Parliament Street building and to the Norman Shaw Buildings. For security reasons this is now the main route of access for Parliament.

== Cost ==
When commissioned in 1992 the cost of Portcullis House was to be £165m. After building cost inflation and delays, the price increased to £235m. Costs included £150,000 for decorative fig trees, £2m for electric blinds and, for each MP, a reclining chair at £440. A parliamentary inquiry into the over-spend was carried by Sir Thomas Legg. Although completed in 2000, the report was never published. By April 2012 the fig trees, which were rented, had cost almost £400,000.

<text>Earl of Stockton is a title in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. It was created on 24 February 1984 for Harold Macmillan, the former Conservative prime minister (from 1957 to 1963), less than three years before his death in 1986. At the same time he received a subsidiary title Viscount Macmillan of Ovenden, of Chelwood Gate in the County of East Sussex and of Stockton-on-Tees in the County of Cleveland, also in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. The viscountcy is used as a courtesy title by the earl&#x27;s heir apparent.

 the titles are held by the first holder&#x27;s grandson, being the second earl, who succeeded in 1986 on his grandfather&#x27;s death (namely Alexander Macmillan, 2nd Earl of Stockton, son of Maurice Macmillan, Viscount Macmillan of Ovenden, only son of the first earl, who died in 1984). The earldom and viscountcy are the most recent hereditary peerages created outside of the royal family and, with the Thatcher baronetcy (which is not a peerage), the only hereditary titles which survive of the few created since 1965.

The family seat was Birch Grove, near Chelwood Gate, East Sussex, but it was sold by the 2nd Earl in 1989.

<text>William Eugene Smith (December 30, 1918 – October 15, 1978) was an American photojournalist. He has been described as &quot;perhaps the single most important American photographer in the development of the editorial photo essay.&quot; His major photo essays include World War II photographs, the visual stories of an American country doctor and a nurse midwife, the clinic of Albert Schweitzer in French Equatorial Africa, the city of Pittsburgh, and the pollution which damaged the health of the residents of Minamata in Japan. His 1948 series, &quot;Country Doctor&quot;, photographed for &quot;Life&quot;, is now recognized as &quot;the first extended editorial photo story&quot;.

== Life and early work ==
William Eugene Smith was born in Wichita, Kansas, on December 30, 1918, to William H. Smith and his wife Nettie (née Lee). Growing up, Smith had become fascinated by flying and aviation. When Smith was 13, he asked his mother for money to buy photographs of airplanes. His mother instead lent him her camera and encouraged him to visit a local airfield to take his own photos. When he returned with his exposed film, she developed the pictures for him in her own improvised darkroom.

By the time he was a teenager, photography had become his passion; he photographed sports activities at Cathedral High School and at the age of 15 his sports photos were published by Vigil Cay, sports editor at the &quot;Wichita Press&quot;. On July 25, 1934, &quot;The New York Times&quot; published a photo by Smith of the Arkansas River dried up into a plate of mud, evidence of the extreme weather events that were devastating the Midwest. These weather conditions had a disastrous effect on agriculture. Smith&#x27;s father, who was a grain dealer, saw his business head towards bankruptcy and he committed suicide.

Smith graduated from the Wichita North High School in 1936. His mother used her Catholic church connections to enable Smith to obtain a photography scholarship which helped to fund his tuition at the University of Notre Dame, but at the age of 18 he abruptly quit university and moved to New York City. By 1938 he had begun to work for &quot;Newsweek&quot; where he became known for his perfectionism and thorny personality. Smith was eventually fired from &quot;Newsweek&quot;; he later explained &quot;Newsweek&quot; wanted him to work with larger format negatives but he refused to abandon the 35 mm Contax camera he preferred to work with. Smith began to work for &quot;Life&quot; magazine in 1939, quickly building a strong relationship with then picture editor Wilson Hicks. Smith married Carmen in 1941 with whom he had four children, their first Marissa in 1942, Juanita and Patric year of birth unknown and Kevin in 1956. It is unknown when they divorced. He married Aileen in 1971 and again unknown if they divorced, but he ended his relationship with Aileen as he began a relationship with Sherry Suris and moved in with her after completing the Minamata book in 1974, as laterly mentioned below in New York. 

== War work ==

In September 1943, Smith became a war correspondent for Ziff-Davis Publishing and also supplied photos to &quot;Life&quot; magazine. Smith took photos on the front lines in the Pacific theater of World War II. He was with the American forces during their island-hopping offensive against Japan, photographing U.S. Marines and Japanese prisoners of war at Saipan, Guam, Iwo Jima, and Okinawa. Smith&#x27;s awareness of the brutality of the conflict sharpened the focus of his ambition. He wrote &quot;You can&#x27;t raise a nation to kill and murder without injury to the mind... It is the reason I am covering the war for I want my pictures to carry some message against the greed, the stupidity and the intolerances that cause these wars and the breaking of many bodies.&quot; Ben Maddow wrote: &quot;Smith&#x27;s photographs of 1943 through 1945 show his swift development from talent to genius.&quot; In 1945, Smith was seriously injured by mortar fire while photographing the Battle of Okinawa.

In 1946, he took his first photograph since being injured: a picture of his two children walking in the garden of his home which he titled &quot;The Walk to Paradise Garden.&quot; The photograph became famous when Edward Steichen used it as one of the key images in the exhibition &quot;The Family of Man,&quot; which Steichen curated in 1955. After spending two years undergoing surgery, Smith continued to work at &quot;Life&quot; until 1955.

== 1950s ==
Between 1948 and 1954 Smith photographed for &quot;Life&quot; magazine a series of photo essays with a humanist perspective which laid the basis of modern photojournalism, and which were, in the estimate of Encyclopædia Britannica, &quot;characterized by a strong sense of empathy and social conscience.&quot;

In August 1948 Smith photographed Dr. Ernest Ceriani in the town of Kremmling, Colorado, for several weeks, covering the doctor&#x27;s arduous work in a thinly populated western environment, grappling with life and death situations. (One of the most vivid images shows Ceriani looking exhausted in a kitchen, having performed a Caesarean section during which both mother and baby died.) The essay &quot;Country Doctor&quot; was published by Life on September 20, 1948. It has been described by Sean O&#x27;Hagan as &quot;the first extended editorial photo story&quot;.

In late 1949, Smith was sent to the UK to cover the General Election, when the Labour Party, under Clement Attlee, was re-elected with a tiny majority. Smith also travelled to Wales where he photographed a series of studies of miners in South Wales Valleys. Critics have compared Smith&#x27;s work to similar studies made by Bill Brandt. In a documentary made by BBC Wales, Dai Smith located a miner who described how he and two colleagues had met Smith on their way home from work at the pit and had been instructed on how to pose for one of the photographs published in &quot;Life.&quot;

From Wales, Smith travelled to Spain where he spent a month in 1950, photographing the village of Deleitosa, Extremadura, focusing on themes of rural poverty. Smith attracted the suspicion of the local Guardia Civil, until he finally made an abrupt exit across the border to France. &quot;A Spanish Village&quot; was published in Life on April 9, 1951, to great acclaim. Ansel Adams wrote Smith a letter of praise, which Smith carried in his pocket for three years, unable to write a reply.

In 1951, Smith persuaded &quot;Life&quot; editor Edward Thompson to let him do a photo-journalistic profile of Maude E. Callen, a black nurse midwife working in rural South Carolina. For weeks Smith accompanied Callen on her exhausting schedule, rising before dawn and working into the evening. The essay &quot;Nurse Midwife&quot; was published in &quot;Life&quot; on December 3, 1951. It was well received and resulted in thousands of dollars in donations to create the Maude Callen Clinic, which opened in Pineville, South Carolina in May 1953, with Smith present at the ceremony.

In 1954, Smith photographed an extensive photo-essay about the work of Albert Schweitzer at his clinic at Lambaréné in Gabon, West Africa. It was later revealed that one of his most famous images had been extensively manipulated. Smith made many layouts of his Schweitzer pictures which he submitted to &quot;Life,&quot; but the final layout of the story published on November 15, 1954, entitled &quot;A Man of Mercy,&quot; angered Smith because editor Edward Thompson used fewer pictures than Smith wanted, and Smith thought the layout crude. He sent a formal 60-day notice of resignation letter to &quot;Life&quot; in November 1954.

After leaving &quot;Life&quot; magazine, Smith joined the Magnum Photos agency in 1955. There he was commissioned by Stefan Lorant to produce a photographic profile of the city of Pittsburgh. The project was supposed to take him a month and to produce 100 images. It ended up occupying more than two years and producing 13,000 photographic negatives. The intended book was never delivered to Lorant, and Smith&#x27;s obsessive work was bailed out by money from Magnum, causing strain between Smith and the photo-journalist collective.

==Jazz Loft Project==
In 1957, Smith left his wife Carmen and their four children in Croton-on-Hudson and moved into a loft space at 821 Sixth Avenue in Midtown Manhattan which he shared with David X. Young, Dick Cary, and Hall Overton. Smith laid down an intricate network of microphones and obsessively took photographs and recorded jazz musicians playing in the loft space, including Thelonious Monk, Zoot Sims and Rahsaan Roland Kirk. From 1957 to 1965, Smith made approximately 4,000 hours of recordings on 1,740 reel-to-reel tapes and nearly 40,000 photographs in the loft building in Manhattan&#x27;s wholesale flower district. The tapes also contain recorded street noise in the flower district, late-night radio talk shows, telephone calls, television and radio news programs, and random loft dialogues among musicians, artists, and other Smith friends and associates. The Jazz Loft Project, devoted to preserving and cataloging the works of Smith, is directed by Sam Stephenson at the Center for Documentary Studies at Duke University, in co-operation with the Center for Creative Photography at the University of Arizona and the Smith estate.

In August 1970, at the age of 51, Smith met Aileen Sprague, who would later become his wife. She served as a translator for Smith when he was interviewed in a Fujifilm commercial. Aileen was the daughter of a Japanese mother and an American father, raised in Tokyo before they moved to the United States when she was 11. At the time of meeting Smith she was 20 years old and went to Stanford University. Only a week after meeting, Smith asked her to become his assistant and live with him in New York. Aileen agreed, dropped out of university and began living with Smith.

== Japan and Minamata ==
In the fall of 1970, Kazuhiko Motomura, a friend of Smith, moved to the United States. He proposed to Smith and Aileen to visit Japan and cover the Minamata disease. They accepted the invitation and arrived in Japan on August 16, 1971, where they married 12 days later.

Between September 1971 and October 1974, they rented a house in Minamata, both a fishing village and a &quot;one company&quot; industrial city in Kumamoto Prefecture, Japan. There, they created a long-term photo-essay on Minamata disease, the effects of mercury poisoning caused by a Chisso factory discharging heavy metals into water sources around Minamata.

In January 1972, Smith accompanied activists who were meeting representatives of the Chisso trade unionists at Chiba, to ask why union workers were used by the company as bodyguards. The group was attacked by Chisso Company employees and members of the union local who beat Smith up, badly damaging his eyesight. Smith and Aileen continued to work together to complete the Minamata project, despite the fact that Aileen informed Smith she was divorcing him as soon as the book was finished. They were supported by the publisher Lawrence Schiller and finished the book in Los Angeles.

The book was published in 1975 as &quot;Minamata&quot;, Words and Photographs by W. Eugene Smith and Aileen M. Smith. Its centerpiece photograph and one of his most famous works, &quot;Tomoko and Mother in the Bath,&quot; taken in December 1971, drew worldwide attention to the effects of Minamata disease. The photograph shows a mother cradling her severely deformed daughter in a traditional Japanese bath house. The photograph was the centerpiece of a Minamata disease exhibition held in Tokyo, in 1974. In 1997, Aileen M. Smith withdrew the photo from circulation in accordance with Tomoko&#x27;s parents&#x27; wishes.

In 2020, the film &quot;Minamata&quot; dramatized the story of Smith&#x27;s documentation of the pollution and the ensuing protests and campaign in Japan. Johnny Depp played W. Eugene Smith and Minami played Aileen.

==Move to Arizona and death==
Smith returned from his stay in Minamata, Japan, in November 1974, and, after completing the &quot;Minamata&quot; book, he moved to a studio in New York City with a new partner, Sherry Suris. Smith&#x27;s friends were alarmed by his deteriorating health and arranged for him to join the teaching faculty of the Art Department and Department of Journalism at the University of Arizona. Smith and Suris moved to Tucson, Arizona in November 1977. On December 23, 1977, Smith suffered a massive stroke, but made a partial recovery and continued to teach and organize his archive. Smith suffered a second stroke and died on October 15, 1978. He was cremated and his ashes interred in Crum Elbow Rural Cemetery, Hyde Park, New York.

==Legacy==
Summarizing Smith&#x27;s achievements, Ben Maddow wrote:&quot;His vocation, he once said, was to do nothing less than record, by word and photograph, the human condition. No one could really succeed at such a job: yet Smith almost did. During his relatively brief and often painful life, he created at least fifty images so powerful that they have altered the perception of our history.&quot;

Writing in &quot;The Guardian&quot; in 2017, Sean O&#x27;Hagan described Smith as &quot;perhaps the single most important American photographer in the development of the editorial photo essay.&quot;

According to the International Center of Photography, &quot;Smith is credited with the developing the photo essay to its ultimate form. He was an exacting printer, and the combination of innovation, integrity, and technical mastery in his photography made his work the standard by which photojournalism was measured for many years.&quot;

In 1984 Smith was posthumously inducted into the International Photography Hall of Fame and Museum.

===&quot;The Big Book&quot;===
&quot;The Big Book (The Walk to Paradise Garden)&quot; is a conceptual photobook that Smith worked on from 1959 until his death, intending to serve as retrospective sum of his work as well as a reflection of his life philosophies. Considered &quot;unviable and non-commercial&quot; at the time, due to having 380 pages and 450 images in two volumes, it was unpublished in his lifetime but was finally published in a facsimile reproduction in 2013 by the University of Texas Press with an added third volume of essays and texts. The work includes two of Smith&#x27;s original volumes which present his imagery not according to story, as they would have been published at the time of their creation, but rather according to Smith&#x27;s own creative process. The University of Texas publication comes with a third book included in the slip-case, offering contemporary essays and notes.

===W. Eugene Smith Memorial Fund===

The W. Eugene Smith Memorial Fund promotes &quot;humanistic photography&quot;. Since 1980, the fund has awarded photographers for exceptional accomplishments in the field.

<text>Waterloo Bridge () is a road and foot traffic bridge crossing the River Thames in London, between Blackfriars Bridge and Hungerford Bridge and Golden Jubilee Bridges. Its name commemorates the victory of the British, Dutch and Prussians at the Battle of Waterloo in 1815. Thanks to its location at a strategic bend in the river, the bridge offers good views of Westminster, the South Bank and the London Eye to the west, and of the City of London and Canary Wharf to the east.
==History==
===First bridge===



The first bridge on the site was designed in 1809–10 by John Rennie for the Company of Proprietors of The Strand Bridge (the Strand Bridge Company). The Strand Bridge Company built the bridge privately, in return for charging tolls to cross it.

Originally named &#x27;the Strand Bridge&#x27;, following the victory of the Battle of Waterloo, the bridge was renamed in 1816 (before its opening) to &#x27;the Waterloo Bridge&#x27;. The bridge company was at the same time renamed &#x27;The Company of Proprietors of The Waterloo Bridge&#x27;. It opened in 1817 as a toll bridge.

The granite bridge had nine arches, each of span, separated by double Doric stone columns, and was long, including approaches– between abutments–and wide between the parapets.

During the 1840s the bridge gained a reputation as a popular place for suicide attempts. In 1841, the American daredevil Samuel Gilbert Scott was killed while performing an act in which he hung by a rope from a scaffold on the bridge. In 1844 Thomas Hood wrote the poem &quot;The Bridge of Sighs&quot;, which concerns the suicide of a prostitute there.

The bridge was depicted by the French Impressionist Claude Monet in his series of 41 works from 1900 to 1904, and by the English Romantic John Constable, whose painting depicting its opening is displayed at Anglesey Abbey in Cambridgeshire.

The bridge was nationalised in 1878 and placed under the control of the Metropolitan Board of Works, which removed the toll from it.

Michael Faraday tried in 1832 to measure the potential difference between each side of the bridge caused by the ebbing salt water flowing through the Earth&#x27;s magnetic field using magnetohydrodynamics.

Serious problems were found in Rennie&#x27;s bridge piers from 1884 onward, after scour from the river flow (which had increased following the demolition of Old London Bridge) damaged their foundations. By the 1920s the problems had increased, and settlement at pier five necessitated the closure of the whole bridge while some heavy superstructure was removed and temporary reinforcements were put in place.

In 1925, a temporary steel framework was built on top of the existing bridge and then placed next to it for the use of southbound vehicles (the postcard image shows this, and the settlement especially to the left of the fifth pier).

===Second bridge===
In the 1930s, London County Council decided to demolish the bridge and replace it with a new structure designed by Sir Giles Gilbert Scott. The engineers were Ernest Buckton and John Cuerel of Rendel Palmer &amp; Tritton. The project was placed on hold due to the Second World War.

Scott, by his own admission, was no engineer, and his design, with reinforced concrete beams (illustrated) under the footways, leaving the road to be supported by transverse slabs, was difficult to implement. The pairs of spans on each side of the river were supported by beams continuous over their piers, and these were cantilevered out at their ends to support the centre span and the short approach slabs at the banks. The beams were shaped &quot;to look as much like arches as ... beams can&quot;. They are clad in Portland stone, which is cleaned by rain. To guard against the possibility of further subsidence from scour, each pier was given a number of jacks that can be used to level the structure.

Construction of the new bridge began in 1937 and it was partially opened on Tuesday 11 March 1942 and &quot;officially opened&quot; in September 1942. However, it was not fully completed until 1945. It is the only Thames bridge to have been damaged by German bombers during the Second World War.

The building contractor was Peter Lind &amp; Company. At the outbreak of war, despite an immediate order being issued by the Ministry of Transport, that the bridge construction was of national importance, the supply of male labour to execute the heavy works became acute. From the start of the war through to the bridge completion, women became the preponderant members of the construction workforce. This resulted in the project being referred to for many years as &quot;The Ladies&#x27; Bridge&quot;. Lind used elm wood from the old bridge for the dining room floor of Hamstone House, his house that he commissioned and built in 1938 at St George&#x27;s Hill in Surrey.

Georgi Markov, a Bulgarian dissident, was assassinated on Waterloo Bridge on 7 September 1978 by agents of the Bulgarian secret police, the Committee for State Security, possibly assisted by the Soviet security agency, the KGB. He was killed with a poisoned pellet possibly fired from an umbrella.

===Reuse of original parts===
Granite stones from the original bridge were subsequently &quot;presented to various parts of the British world to further historic links in the British Commonwealth of Nations&quot;. Two of these stones are in Canberra, the capital city of Australia, sited between the parallel spans of the Commonwealth Avenue Bridge, one of two major crossings of Lake Burley Griffin in the heart of the city. Stones from the bridge were also used to build a monument in Wellington, New Zealand, to Paddy the Wanderer, a dog that roamed the wharves from 1928 to 1939 and was befriended by seamen, watersiders, Harbour Board workers and taxi drivers. The monument, built in 1945, is on Queens Wharf, opposite the Wellington Museum. It includes a bronze likeness of Paddy, a drinking fountain, and drinking bowls below for dogs. 

Another piece of the stone is situated under the sundial in the Wellington Boat Harbour Park, next to Clyde Quay Marina, an area of historical significance in Wellington Harbour. Several stone balusters from the demolished bridge were sent in the late 1930s by the author Dornford Yates to be used in his French home &#x27;Cockade&#x27;, but the Fall of France in 1940 interrupted this project. They were shipped after the war to his new house in Umtali, Rhodesia (now Mutare, Zimbabwe).

Recovered timbers from the bridge were used for shelves and wall panels in the library at Anglesey Abbey.

==Geography==

The south end of the bridge is in the area known as the South Bank, which includes the Royal Festival Hall, London Waterloo, Queen Elizabeth Hall and the Royal National Theatre, as well as the BFI Southbank, which is directly beneath the bridge.

The north end of the bridge passes above the Victoria Embankment where the road joins the Strand and Aldwych alongside Somerset House. This end housed the southern portal of the Kingsway Tramway Subway until the late 1950s.

The entire bridge was given Grade II* listed structure protection in 1981.

The nearest London Underground station is Temple, the nearest National Rail station is London Waterloo.

==In popular culture==

*Robert E. Sherwood&#x27;s play &quot;Waterloo Bridge&quot; (1930), the story of a soldier who falls in love and marries a woman he meets on the bridge in an air raid during the First World War, was made into films released in 1931, 1940 and 1956. The second of these film versions starred Vivien Leigh and Robert Taylor.
*&quot;After the Lunch&quot;, a poem by Wendy Cope about two lovers parting on Waterloo Bridge, now forms the lyric of the song &quot;Waterloo Bridge&quot; by Jools Holland and Louise Marshall.
*The bridge features in the film &quot;A Window in London&quot; (1940). The hero, played by Michael Redgrave, is a crane driver who is working on the construction of the bridge. Images can be seen of the incomplete rebuilding work in progress.

<text>Broughty Castle is a historic castle on the banks of the River Tay in Broughty Ferry, Dundee, Scotland. It was completed around 1495, although the site was earlier fortified in 1454, when George Douglas, 4th Earl of Angus, received permission to build on the site. His son, Archibald Douglas, 5th Earl of Angus, was coerced into ceding the castle to the crown. The main tower house forming the centre of the castle with four floors was built by Andrew, 2nd Lord Gray, who was granted the castle in 1490.

==History==

===The Rough Wooing===
The castle saw military action during the 16th-century War of the Rough Wooing. After the battle of Pinkie in September 1547, it was surrendered by purchase to the English by its owner, Lord Gray of Foulis. A messenger from the castle, Rinyon (Ninian) Cockburn, who spoke to the English supreme commander the Duke of Somerset before the castle was rendered was given a £4 reward. The Scottish keeper, Henry Durham, was rewarded with an English pension, income from the fishing, and an import/export licence. Durham later lent the English commander £138. William Patten, the English writer who accompanied Somerset, noted the castle&#x27;s strategic importance;&quot;it standeth in such sort at the mouth of the river Tay, that being gotten, both Dundee and St. John&#x27;s Town (Perth), and many other towns else shall become subject to this hold or be compelled to forgo their use of the river.&quot;

The position of the old castle itself was advantageous to modern warfare, as it was discovered that the swift river current made naval bombardment impractical. Soon after taking possession, the English garrison further fortified Broughty by building a ditch across the landward side of the castle&#x27;s promontory. Edward Clinton began the refortification, on the advice of an Italian engineer, Master John Rossetti, and left 100 men guarded by three ships. William Bruce of Earlshall feared the English would build an outpost on the south say of the Tay. The garrison was first led by Sir Andrew Dudley, the Duke of Northumberland&#x27;s brother, who hoped to distribute Tyndale&#x27;s Bible in Dundee. 
Andrew Dudley wrote in October 1547; &quot;as for soldiers, there was never man had so weak a company, given all to eating and drinking and slothfulness&quot;, although, &quot;the house stands well.&quot; His garrison included Italian and Spanish soldiers, and he hoped that Grey of Wilton would send him an expert French surgeon. The town of Dundee agreed to support the garrison and resist the Governor of Scotland, Regent Arran on 27 October 1547. The Constable of Dundee, John Scrimgeour, and the baillies and council signed the agreement, although under the duress of Dudley&#x27;s two gunships.

The Earl of Argyll tried to capture the castle on 22 November 1547 and again in January 1548 with 150 men led by the soldier Duncan Dundas, without success. Thomas Wyndham brought two more ships in December 1547 and burnt Balmerino Abbey on Christmas Day. On 12 January 1548, one hundred matchlock guns were delivered from Berwick, with powder flasks, matches, touch boxes, and bullet moulds. Sir Thomas Palmer and the Italian military engineer &quot;Master John&quot;, Giovanni di Rossetti, who was made master of ordnance at Broughty, made plans to improve the fortifications, noting that the castle was overlooked by a nearby hill. In February 1548, 100 workmen were sent from Berwick and new armaments including falcon guns, cannonballs for demi-culverins, bows, bills, pikes, cresset lights, cables and anchors. Palmer set to work fortifying the hill in February and also considered ambitious plans to build a citadel in Dundee with the demolition of the church and tolbooth. Andrew Dudley waited for lead to make a new platform (probably for artillery) on the castle tower in March 1548.
Andrew Dudley was succeeded by John Luttrell who had been the commander at Inchcolm. On 11 May 1548, the English commander at Haddington, Grey of Wilton wrote to Luttrell that he could not expect more supplies because of the expected French fleet. Grey of Wilton warned him against Scottish assassins in June, and Somerset required him to dismiss the German mercenaries in his command. There was some relief for Luttrell, as Lord Methven took away the guns of the Scottish counter-battery for redeployment at the Siege of Haddington on 6 June 1548.

Meanwhile, Luttrell had been ordered to build a new fortification on an adjacent site. In November he wrote to Somerset describing the progress of this work explaining that the ramparts made from turf were unstable and could not be strengthened. Luttrell said his enemies would not need guns; &quot;for theye shall fynde hytt fallen downe redy to ther handys.&quot; In December 1548, Patrick, Lord Gray of Foulis, was summoned to account for his treasons against the Government of Scotland, and although the French commanders argued for his execution, he was eventually pardoned at Regent Arran&#x27;s command.

In February 1549 Luttrell was joined by Pedro de Negro and his band of Spanish soldiers. In July Luttrell complained that the Spanish soldiers had not yet received pay or clothing.

Thomas Wyndham and his nephew Luttrell&#x27;s activities on the Forth were called into question in November 1549, and the Earl of Rutland was required to investigate whether one of the ships they had seized was a lawful prize. On Christmas Day 1549, Mary of Guise held a conference at Stirling Castle with her guests, and they agreed that more French guns could be brought to besiege Broughty. Robert Hamilton of Briggis directed labourers called &quot;pioneers&quot; to dig entrenchments for the guns.

Twelve English ships arrived to support the defenders and it was 12 February 1550 before the French and Scots managed to recapture Broughty. Mary of Guise watched the successful assault on 6 February 1550 from a vantage point across the Tay. Paul de Thermes led the French troops, 240 were injured and 50 killed. The garrison surrendered six days later at midnight. James Dog of Dunrobin claimed Luttrell as his prisoner and his papers were captured. His ransom of £1000 Scots was raised on 16 May 1550 as an exchange for the sons of George Douglas of Pittendreich and the Master of Semple who were prisoners in England. (George Douglas&#x27;s son would later rule Scotland as Regent Morton.) Luttrell was promptly re-arrested for debts to a Dundee merchant, Robert Craig, but Regent Arran paid the merchant in September, and Luttrell was allowed home.

===War of the Three Kingdoms===
The castle was attacked again, in 1651, by General Monck and his Parliamentary army during the Wars of the Three Kingdoms. On this occasion the Royalist defenders fled without a fight. After 1666, when the Gray family sold the castle, it gradually became more ruinous.

===Military and modern use===
In 1846 the castle was bought by the Edinburgh and Northern Railway Company in order to build an adjacent harbour for their railway ferry. In 1855 the castle was acquired by the War Office with the intention of using it to defend the harbour from the Russians. In 1860 renewed fears of a French invasion led the War Office to rebuild and fortify the site. The site was rebuilt according to the designs of Robert Rowand Anderson. The walls of the main courtyard were rebuilt and new wings and courtyards were added to the tower. A caponier was added along the south-east side of the courtyard. Emplacements for nine large guns were also constructed. A small enclosure on the west side of the courtyard was also built. During the First World War, the castle battery mounted two 4.7-inch Quick Firing guns.

From 1886 to 1887 a range was built to house submarine miners to the east of the castle. In an emergency these would lay mines in the Tay Estuary to damage enemy shipping. In 1889–1891 a magazine was built within the western enclosure which also led to a major remodelling of the gun emplacements. The castle remained in military use until 1932, and again between 1939 and 1949. The last defence-related alteration was made in the Second World War when a defence post was built within the top of the main tower.

In 1969 the castle opened as a museum operated by Dundee city council. The museum is free of charge but is not wheelchair accessible. Its steep spiral staircase also renders it problematic to the elderly.

The structure is designated a scheduled ancient monument.

<text>Westminster Bridge is a road-and-foot-traffic bridge crossing over the River Thames in London, linking Westminster on the west side and Lambeth on the east side.

The bridge is painted predominantly green, the same colour as the leather seats in the House of Commons which is on the side of the Palace of Westminster nearest to the bridge, but a natural shade similar to verdigris. This is in contrast to Lambeth Bridge, which is red, the same colour as the seats in the House of Lords and is on the opposite side of the Houses of Parliament.

In 2005–2007, it underwent a complete refurbishment, including replacing the iron fascias and repainting the whole bridge.
It links the Palace of Westminster on the west side of the river with County Hall and the London Eye on the east and was the finishing point during the early years of the London Marathon.

The next bridge downstream is the Hungerford Bridge &amp; Golden Jubilee Bridges and upstream is Lambeth Bridge. Westminster Bridge was designated a Grade II* listed structure in 1981.

==History==






For over 600 years (at least 1129–1729), the nearest Thames bridge to London Bridge was at Kingston. From late Tudor times congestion in trading hours at London Bridge (for road goods and carriages from Kent, Essex, much of Surrey, Middlesex and beyond) often amounted to more than an hour. A bridge at Westminster was proposed in 1664, but opposed by the Corporation of London and the watermen. Further opposition held sway in 1722. However an intervening bridge (albeit in timber) was built at Putney in 1729 and the scheme received parliamentary approval in 1736. Financed by private capital, lotteries and grants, Westminster Bridge was built between 1739–1750, under the supervision of the Swiss engineer Charles Labelye. The bridge opened on 18 November 1750.

The City of London responded to Westminster Bridge and the population growth by removing the buildings on London Bridge and widening it in 1760–63. With Putney Bridge, the bridge paved the way for four others within three decades: Blackfriars Bridge (1769, built by the City), Kew Bridge (1759), Battersea Bridge (1773), and Richmond Bridge (1777) by which date roads and vehicles were improved and fewer regular goods transported by water.

The bridge assisted the expanding West End to the developing South London as well as goods and carriages from the more estuarine counties and the East Sussex and Kentish ports. Without the bridge, traffic to and from the greater West End would have to negotiate streets often as congested as London Bridge, principally the Strand/Fleet Street and New Oxford Street/Holborn. Roads on both sides of the river were also built and improved, including Charing Cross Road and around the Elephant &amp; Castle in Southwark.

By the mid-19th century the bridge was subsiding badly and expensive to maintain. The current bridge was designed by Thomas Page and opened on 24 May 1862. With a length of and a width of , it is a seven-arch, cast-iron bridge with Gothic detailing by Charles Barry (the architect of the Palace of Westminster). The bridge carried a tram line for much of the first half of the twentieth century, from 1906 until 1952. On 5 July that year the last tram made a ceremonial journey across the bridge. Since the removal of Rennie&#x27;s New London Bridge in 1967 it is the oldest road structure which crosses the Thames in central London.

On 22 March 2017, a terrorist attack started on the bridge and continued into Bridge Street and Old Palace Yard. Five people – three pedestrians, one police officer, and the attacker – died as a result of the incident. A colleague of the officer (who was stationed nearby) was armed and shot the attacker. More than 50 people were injured. An investigation into the attack was conducted by the Metropolitan Police.

<doc id="360374" wikidata="Q17102626" url="?curid=360374" title="Young Scientist and Technology Exhibition">
<text>The BT Young Scientist and Technology Exhibition, commonly called the Young Scientist Exhibition, is an Irish annual school students&#x27; science competition that has been held in the Royal Dublin Society, Dublin, Ireland, every January since the competition was founded by Tom Burke and Tony Scott in 1965.

==The competition==
The purpose of the competition is to encourage interest in science in secondary schools. For the 51st year of the competition in 2016, there were over 2,000 entries, from 396 schools which was the highest number ever, 550 of which were selected for the Exhibition at the RDS.

Students apply to participate in the competition. Their science project entries are evaluated by judges and about one-third of applicants are accepted to participate in the public exhibition. Students are allocated exhibition stands in an exhibition hall where they set up their projects for viewing by the public. Competing projects are judged during the three days of the exhibition, and prizes are awarded.

Projects are awarded in five categories: biology, physics, social and behavioural sciences, health and wellbeing and technology. Health and wellbeing is the newest category, only being added in 2023 to celebrate the 60th anniversary and to lower admissions to social and behavioural sciences. Three levels of entry are accepted, junior, intermediate and senior. In each category three main prizes are awarded; other prizes include a display award, highly commended rosettes, and a cancer awareness award. The winners of the BT Young Scientist and Technology Exhibition advance to participate in prestigious international events such as the European Union Contest for Young Scientists.

John Monahan was the inaugural winner of the Young Scientist Exhibition in 1965; then a student of Newbridge College, his project was an explanation of the process of digestion in the human stomach. He went on to establish a NASDAQ-listed biotech company in California after attending University College Dublin.

Aer Lingus sponsored the competition for the first 33 years. 2021 marked the 21st year in which the Exhibition was sponsored by BT Ireland. It has produced at least one author, Sarah Flannery, and one billionaire, Patrick Collison. Many of the past winners have gone on to establish international companies in the technology they developed. One of the most notable was Baltimore Technologies.

Tom Burke, who co-founded the exhibition with physicist Tony Scott, died in March 2008. An award at the event (a bursary offered to senior participants) was named in his memory.

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the first ever virtual Young Scientist &amp; Technology Exhibition was held in January 2021 with over 1,000 students representing more than 200 schools taking part.

On 11 February 2025, BT Ireland announced it would step down as organiser and sponsor of the Young Scientist and Technology Exhibition after 25 years.

<doc id="360375" wikidata="Q378271" url="?curid=360375" title="Baldwin I, Margrave of Flanders">
<text>Baldwin I (probably 830s – 879), also known as Baldwin Iron Arm (; the epithet is first recorded in the 12th century), was the first margrave of Flanders, which evolved into the County of Flanders.

==Elopement with a princess==
At the time Baldwin first appears in the records he was already a count, presumably in the area of Flanders, but this is not known. Count Baldwin rose to prominence when he eloped with Judith, daughter of Charles the Bald, king of West Francia. Judith had previously been married to Æthelwulf and Æthelbald, kings of Wessex, but after the latter&#x27;s death in 860, she returned to France.

Around the Christmas of 861, at the instigation of Baldwin and with her brother Louis&#x27;s consent, Judith escaped the custody into which she had been placed in the city of Senlis, Oise after her return from England. She fled north with Count Baldwin. Charles had given no permission for a marriage and tried to capture Baldwin, sending letters to Rorik of Dorestad and Bishop Hungar, forbidding them to shelter the fugitive.
After Baldwin and Judith had evaded his attempts to capture them, Charles had his bishops excommunicate the couple. Judith and Baldwin responded by travelling to Rome to plead their case with Pope Nicholas I. By 23 November 862, their plea was successful in that they had won the support of Pope Nicholas. In June 863 Rodoald, Bishop of Porto in Italy and John, Bishop of Cervia were sent by Pope Nicholas to pressure King Charles into consenting to Judith and Baldwin&#x27;s marriage. Later that year they were allowed to return to Francia and get married in the cathedral in Auxerre. Charles the Bald refused to attend either the betrothal or the marriage, but he restored Baldwin to all his previous honors.

King Charles appointed Baldwin Margrave of Flanders, responsible for repelling the Viking invasions. Some theorize Charles did this in the hope that Baldwin would be killed. Baldwin was very successful in the position and used it to build his domain. By 870, in addition to Flanders, Baldwin had acquired the lay-abbacy of Saint Peter&#x27;s Abbey in Ghent and is assumed to have also acquired the county of Waasland, or parts thereof by this time.

===Issue===
Baldwin I and Judith had:
* Charles, who was named after his maternal grandfather but died at a young age
* Baldwin II (c. 866 – 918), who succeeded as margrave of Flanders
* Ralph (c. 869 – murdered 896), who became count of Cambrai around 888; he and his brother joined King Zwentibold of Lotharingia in 895, attacked Vermandois and captured Arras, Saint-Quentin and Peronne, and ended up captured and killed by Herbert I of Vermandois
* Guinidilda, who married Wilfred I the Hairy, Count of Barcelona.

==Career==
Baldwin developed himself as a very faithful and stout supporter of Charles and played an important role in the continuing wars against the Vikings. He is named in 877 as one of those willing to support the emperor&#x27;s son, Louis the Stammerer. During his life, Baldwin expanded his territory into one of the major principalities of Western Francia. He died in 879 and was buried in the Abbey of St-Bertin, near Saint-Omer.

<text>County Hall (sometimes called London County Hall) is a building in the district of Lambeth, London that was the headquarters of London County Council (LCC) and later the Greater London Council (GLC). The building is on the South Bank of the River Thames, with Westminster Bridge being next to it, to the south. It faces west toward the City of Westminster and is close to the Palace of Westminster. The nearest London Underground stations are and . It is a Grade II* listed building.

== History ==

The building was commissioned to replace the mid 19th-century Spring Gardens headquarters inherited from the Metropolitan Board of Works. The site selected by civic leaders was previously occupied by four properties: Float Mead (occupied by Simmond&#x27;s flour mills), Pedlar&#x27;s Acre (occupied by wharves and houses), Bishop&#x27;s Acre (occupied by Crosse &amp; Blackwell&#x27;s factory) and the Four Acres (occupied by workshops and stables).

The main six storey building was designed by Ralph Knott. It is faced in Portland stone in an Edwardian Baroque style. The construction, which was undertaken by Holland, Hannen &amp; Cubitts, started in 1911 and the building was opened by King George V in 1922. The North and South blocks, which were built by Higgs and Hill, were added between 1936 and 1939. The Island block was not completed until 1974.

In 1945, the World Trade Union Conference took place at the hall.

The Island Block was built on what was then a roundabout (now a peninsula) between County Hall, St Thomas&#x27; Hospital and Waterloo Station. It was notable to the passing public for three main reasons: it was of a completely different architectural character to any of the other nearby buildings, it had no entrances at ground level (though there were emergency exits), being accessible only by a bridge and a tunnel both from the SE County Hall building, and it had orange sunshades, designed to be lowered and raised together automatically when the sun shone, rather than by local control which would look less pleasing on the outside. The controls quickly malfunctioned, leaving the unwanted &quot;random&quot; effect while also causing excess heat and glare inside the building which the occupants could not control. Disliked by many Londoners, it was nonetheless considered &quot;distinguished&quot; by its architect and some other experts, and noted as an early example of open-plan office interior, which should have been listed.

For 64 years County Hall served as the headquarters of local government for London. During the 1980s the then powerful Labour-controlled GLC led by Ken Livingstone was locked in conflict with the Conservative national government of Margaret Thatcher. The façade of County Hall frequently served as a billboard for opposition slogans which could be seen from the Palace of Westminster.

When the government of Margaret Thatcher abolished the GLC in 1986, County Hall lost its role as the seat of London&#x27;s government. Talk soon became of what was to happen to the building, and there were plans to relocate the London School of Economics to the site which did not proceed. The building remained in use by the Inner London Education Authority (ILEA) until its abolition in 1990 when the building was transferred to the London Residuary Body and eventually sold to Shirayama Shokusan, a Japanese investor. On 21 October 2005, the High Court of England and Wales upheld a bid by the owners of the building, Shirayama Shokusan, to have the Saatchi Gallery evicted on grounds of violating its contract, particularly using space outside of the rented area for exhibits.
The Island Block was demolished in 2006 to make way for a hotel, the Park Plaza Westminster Bridge. The building, also known as &quot;No 1 Westminster Bridge Road&quot;, had been disused since 1986 and had been described as an eyesore.

A blue plaque commemorates the LCC, GLC and the Inner London Education Authority at County Hall.

==Attractions==
Today, County Hall is the site of a number of leisure attractions including a hub for Merlin Entertainments whose Sea Life London Aquarium, London Dungeon, Shrek&#x27;s Adventure! and The London Eye are all based in and around the building. 

In 2007, County Hall hosted Star Wars: The Exhibition. The exhibition featured original costumes, props, and vehicles from the Star Wars film series and was created to commemorate the 30th anniversary of the original film&#x27;s release.

From 2008 to 2012, County Hall was home to the London Film Museum founded by Jonathan Sands, which exhibited original props, costumes and sets from a variety of feature films.

Since October 2017, the old council chamber has also been the home to a site-specific production of Agatha Christie&#x27;s Witness for the Prosecution.

<text>Sarah Flannery (born 1982, County Cork, Ireland) was, at sixteen years old, the winner of the 1999 Esat Young Scientist Exhibition for her development of the Cayley–Purser algorithm, based on work she had done with researchers at Baltimore Technologies during a brief internship there. The project, entitled &quot;Cryptography – A new algorithm versus the RSA&quot;, also won her the EU Young Scientist of the Year Award in 1999.

==Biography==
Flannery&#x27;s education included a primary all-girls school and secondary education at Scoil Mhuire Gan Smál in Blarney.

Following the competition win, in 2001 Flannery co-authored &quot;In Code&quot; with her father, mathematician David Flannery (1952-2023). It tells the story of the making and breaking of the Cayley-Purser algorithm, as well as the enjoyment she got from solving mathematical puzzles while growing up. She dedicates many of her accomplishments in the fields of mathematics and cryptography to her father&#x27;s support during her childhood.

She studied computer science at Peterhouse, a college of the University of Cambridge, graduating in 2003, and, as of 2006, worked for Electronic Arts as a software engineer. She worked at TirNua as a &quot;Chief Scientist&quot;. She developed the virtual economy in a game and the back-end web services that powered the game features. She has also worked at RockYou, and several other institutions involved in software development and computer science.

Before working at TirNua, Flannery was software engineer working directly with then Electronic Arts Worldwide Chief Technology Officer, Scott Cronce, and, later, with many fellow Tirnua founders on her first virtual world.

At EA, she successfully set up the EA Open Source program using the Essential Project. Flannery created data visualizations on software architecture and game content creation which were used to directly impact the quality of both. She also successfully ran and turned around the virtual economy within EA-Land (formerly The Sims Online).

Previously, she worked on the technical and scientific computing software product Mathematica for Wolfram Research.

The lights on St. Patrick&#x27;s Street, one of the main thoroughfares of Flannery&#x27;s home city of Cork, are named after her.

Flannery is the sister of the singer and songwriter Mick Flannery.

<doc id="360381" wikidata="Q769327" url="?curid=360381" title="Mount Athabasca">
<text>Mount Athabasca is in the Columbia Icefield of Jasper National Park in Canada. The mountain was named in 1898 by J. Norman Collie, who made the first ascent on August 18 of that year. Athabasca is the Cree language name for &quot;where there are reeds&quot;, which originally referred to Lake Athabasca. Mount Athabasca is unusual, in that water flows to the Pacific Ocean from the western slope, the Arctic Ocean from the northeastern slope, and to Hudson Bay from the southeastern slope.
==Routes==

There are several climbing routes, including:
* North Glacier (Normal Route) II
* Silverhorn II
* AA Col II
* Regular North Face III 5.8
* North Ridge III 5.5
* The Hourglass 300m, III, AI3-4

One of the most prominent features of Mount Athabasca is a horned-shaped tip near the top called the &quot;Silverhorn&quot;. The Silverhorn is one of the easier routes to the summit but requires more caution and ability than the normal route because of blue ice and falling ice from other parties. Although not apparent from the typical roadside view of the mountain, the south side of Silverhorn contains a scrambling route but one must still cross the north glacier to get to it. From the top of the Silverhorn, the summit is a rather easy 15-minute plod in good summer weather over the narrow snow-covered summit ridge.

<doc id="360385" wikidata="Q13580377" url="?curid=360385" title="History of the Aromanians">
<text>This article is about the history of the [[Aromanians]]. For the history of Northern Vlachs (Romanians), see History of Romania.

==Origins==

Aromanians were identified as Vlachs in medieval times. Vlachs, also Wallachian (and many other variants), is a historical term and exonym used from the Middle Ages until the Modern Era to designate speakers of Eastern Romance languages living in the Balkans and north of the Danube. The Vlach peoples from the south Balkans have generally been identified as the indigenous populations with Thracian &amp; Illyrian (Thraco-Illyrian) and Greco-Roman (Hellenic) and true Roman empire origins. Many Vlachs settled into the less-accessible mountainous areas of Greece and other areas in the Balkans because of the barbarian (Germanic, Avar and Bulgar) invasions and immigrations of the 5th-7th centuries. They can be found all over the Balkan peninsula. Aromanians can be found in Greece, Bulgaria, Albania and the Republic of North Macedonia, while Romanians in Romania, Moldova, Ukraine, Serbia and Hungary. Their occupations were mostly trading, live-stock breeding, shepherding and craftsmanship. According to language studies Aromanian was spoken (and still is) in the southern region of Balkan peninsula (Dardania, Epirus, Macedonia, Thrace), and no later than the 10th century separated from the larger area where Common Romanian presumably was spoken.

==History==

===Byzantine period===

In 980 emperor Basil II conferred the dominion over the Vlachs of Thessaly on one Nikulitsa.

As Kekaumenos records, a first revolt against imperial rule occurred in 1066 under the lead of Nikoulitzas Delphinas, nephew of the 10th century Vlach leader, but it was not until after the collapse of the Empire in the Fourth Crusade that the Vlachs would set up their own, autonomous, principality – &quot;Great Wallachia&quot;.

Benjamin of Tudela, a Spanish Jew who visited Thessaly in 1173, describes the Vlachs as living in the mountains and coming down from them to attack the Greeks. In relation with the Byzantine Empire, he adds: &quot;no Emperor can conquer them&quot;.

Ivanko was a Vlach leader of a small autonomous land and he is the one who killed Ivan Asen I, the ruler of Vlach-Bulgarian state. Ivanko established an autonomous land between the Maritza and Struma rivers, and towards the shores of the Aegean Sea, favouring the settlement of the Vlachs in these areas.

Niketas Choniates wrote about a Vlach called Dobromir Chrysus who established an autonomous polity in the upper region of Vardar river and Moglena.

The chronicles of Nicetas Choniates, Benjamin of Tudela, Geoffroy de Villehardouin, Henry of Valenciennes, Robert de Clari, and other sources account for the existence of this state, comprising Thessaly, as opposed to other two &quot;Wallachias&quot;, &quot;Little Wallachia&quot; in Acarnania and Aetolia, and an &quot;Upper Wallachia&quot; in Epirus. This coincides with the period of the first Vlach state entities across the Balkan Peninsula: Great Wallachia, Wallachia and Moldavia. 
After the conquest of Thessaly by the medieval state of Epirus in the 1210s, the Vlachs/Aromanians became the elite troops of the Epirote army against the Latin Crusaders as well as against the armies of Nicaea, a rival state to Byzantium.

===Ottoman period===
During the Ottoman period, Aromanian culture and economic power became more evident, as Vlachs concentrated in major urban centers. For example, the city of Moscopole at that time was one of the largest cities of the Balkans, having a population of 60,000 (for comparison, at that time Athens was a village inhabited by 8,000 people). Moscopole had its own printing house and academies, flowing water and sewerage network. They enjoyed some degree of religious and cultural autonomy within the Greek Orthodox Millet (a Turkish term for a legally protected ethnic and religious minority groups). They enjoyed a special status, being formally exempted from the law prohibiting non-Muslims from carrying weapons, only having to pay a modest tribute to the Ottomans. In 1778 however, Moscopole was nearly razed to the ground by the troops of Ali Pasha. This episode and the Orthodox religion of the Vlachs were the factors which caused a violent and energetic struggle against the Ottomans, assigning to the Vlachs a major role in the various wars and revolutions against Ottoman rule that culminated in the creation of the states which they now inhabit: Albania, North Macedonia, Bulgaria and Greece.

People of Aromanian origin were to be found among the protagonists of early Greek political life, as they found opportunities to establish themselves in this new state. This is explained by the fact that many Aromanians, who, as mentioned, belonged to the Greek Orthodox Millet, adopted the Greek language under the influence of the Greek schools and churches, the only ones entitled by the Ottomans to function and to by maintained by the Ecumenical Patriarchs of Constantinople. Thus, in Ottoman eyes, they were practically equated with Greeks. For instance, the future Patriarch Athenagoras, born in Ottoman Epirus, was considered a Greek by descent. But some Vlachs wanted to preserve their language, customs and culture, and as might be expected there was a strong reaction against this policy of Hellenization. Sir Charles Eliot clearly states his work &quot;Turkey in Europe&quot; that &quot;...The Bulgarians, Serbs and Vlachs have millets of their own and do not cooperate in the Hellenic cause&quot; and that &quot;we hear of Vlach bands who are said to contend (fight against) Greeks in the region of Karaferia (Veria)&quot;. There was also pressure on Aromanians to become linguistically assimilated, which can be traced back to the 18th century, when assimilation efforts were encouraged by the Greek missionary Cosmas of Aetolia (1714–1779) who taught that Aromanians should speak Greek because as he said &quot;it&#x27;s the language of our Church&quot; and established over 100 Greek schools in northern and western Greece. The offensive of the clergy against the use of Aromanian was by no means limited to religious issues but was a tool devised in order to convince the non-Greek speakers to abandon what they regarded as a &quot;worthless&quot; idiom and adopt the superior Greek speech: &quot;There we are Metsovian brothers, together with those who are fooling themselves with this sordid and vile Aromanian language... forgive me for calling it a language&quot;, &quot;repulsive speech with a disgusting diction&quot;.

===Awakening of the Aromanian identity, and Romanian sponsorship===
Their arrival there coincided with the spreading in Europe of the ideals of the French Revolution: nationhood, equality, mother tongue and human rights. In Habsburg-occupied Transylvania, they would connect with the latinophile Romanian intelligentsia, as part of what was known as the Transylvanian School. These intellectuals promoted the ideas which would spark the period known as the National awakening of Romania, which, after a century&#x27;s time ceased to be under &quot;de jure&quot; Ottoman rule. It is in these times that Aromanian personalities became prominent, such as Gheorghe Constantin Roja, the author of &quot;Untersuchungen uber die Romanier oder sogenannten Wlachen, welche jenseits der Donau wohnen&quot; (&quot;Researches upon the Romanians or the so-called Vlachs, who live beyond the Danube&quot;; Pesth, 1808). The first attempt to create a literary language for those described as &quot;Macedo-Romanians&quot; was Roja&#x27;s &quot;Maiestria ghiovasirii romanesti cu litere latinesti, care sant literele Romanilor ceale vechi&quot;(Buda, 1809). Another Aromanian emigrant was Mihail G. Boiagi. In 1813, he would publish in Vienna the book Γραμματική Ρωμαϊκή ήτοι Μακεδονοβλαχική/&quot;Romanische oder Macedonowlachische Sprachlehre&quot; (&quot;Romance or Macedono-Vlach Grammar&quot;). In the foreword to his work, Boiagi wrote: &quot;Even if the Vlachs would claim, say, Hottentot origin, even in that case they ought to have the right and duty to cultivate themselves in their mother tongue, as the most appropriate way to fulfill their creed&quot;. The Metsovo-born Dimitrie Cozacovici would publish in 1865 in Bucharest the &quot;Gramatica Romaneasca tra Romanilii dit drepta Dunarelei lucrata de D. Athanasescu, si typarita cu spesele D.D. Cosacovici, Roman din Metsova, spre an inaugura prima scoala Romana din Macedonia&quot; (&quot;Romanian Grammar to serve the Romanians South of the Danube worked by D. Athanasescu and printed from the donations of D.D. Cozacovici, Romanian of Metsovo, in order to inaugurate the first Romanian school of Macedonia&quot;).

A century later, almost 100 Romanian schools were opened in the Ottoman territories of Macedonia and Albania, starting as early as 1860. It is noted that this initiative was proposed by the Aromanian Diaspora living in Bucharest. The first nucleus of the Vlach schooling in Macedonia and Pindus was to be established in 1860 and its initiators were a group of Aromanians then living in Bucharest: D.D. Cozacovici (native of Metsovo), Zisu Sideri, Iordache Goga (native of Klissoura) and others. Together they initiated the Macedo-Romanian Cultural Society, under the endorsement of the then Romanian ruling class. The Macedo-Romanian Cultural Society had as its members (together with its Aromanian founding core represented by D.D. Cozacovici, Sideri, Goga, Grandea etc.) also the acting Prime and Foreign Ministers, as well as the Head of the Romanian Orthodox Church, and the elite of the Romanian political class: Mihail Kogălniceanu, Ion Ghica, Constantin Rosetti, etc.

One of the greatest figures during the Aromanian awakening was Apostol Margarit, a native of Avdela in southern Macedonia, on the slopes of the Pindus mountains. As early as 1862, Apostol Margarit introduced the vernacular in the school of the large prosperous town of Klissoura (&quot;Vlaho-Klisura&quot;), in the Kastoria region of Macedonia. Nicepheros, the Greek bishop of Kastoria tried for many years to close down the school, but without success. In December, 1879, the first unsuccessful attempt on the life of Apostol Margarit took place. Margarit was wounded during a second attempt on his life during December 1890. There were Vlach schools in Klissoura, Krushevo, Nizepole, Trnovo, Gopesh, Ohrid, old Avdela in the Pindus mountains and new Avdela near Veria. Later more schools were founded in Macedonia, and then a Vlach high school was established in Bitola (Monastir) in the 1880s. The Greeks were naturally alarmed by the national reawakening of the Vlachs. At their peak, just before the Balkan Wars, there were 6 secondary gymnasiums, and 113 primary schools, teaching in Vlach. Due to the ongoing pressures from the Greek Church in the Ottoman provinces of Rumelia, Vlachs and their schools were viewed with suspicion. In 1880 Greek guerrillas attacked some villages near Resen because the village priests had committed the unpardonable sin of using Vlach in the church services. In the same year the Greek bishop of Kastoria had the schoolmaster in Klissoura arrested because he taught in the Vlachs&#x27; native language. In 1903, the Aromanian organization Society Farsharotu was founded in the United States. A momentous date in the history of the Vlachs was May 23, 1905, when the Sultan issued a decree officially recognizing the Vlachs and affirming their rights to maintain their schools and churches. Following the proclamation of the decree, the Greek bishops, and the armed bands they supported, unleashed a campaign of terror on the Aromanians to discourage them from taking advantage of their rights. In 1905, the Vlach abbot of the Holy Archangel monastery in the Meglen region was murdered by a Greek band. In the summer of 1905 some villages near Bitola were attacked. On October 27, 1905, Greek guerillas attacked the village of Avdela in the Pindus, birthplace of Apostol Margarit, and razed it to the ground. Then in 1906, in the town of Véria (&quot;Berea&quot;), the priest Papanace was murdered as he was on his way to church to serve the Divine Liturgy in Vlach. The Romanian Vlach school in the village of Avdhela in Pindus, which was one of the first Romanian sponsored Vlach schools, active as early as 1867, was burned and razed to the ground on 27 October 1905 by Greek guerrillas. This event prompted street anti-Greek demonstrations in Bucharest in the autumn of 1905 of the Aromanians living there, and a rupture of diplomatic relations between Romania and Greece.

Romania, with the support of Austro-Hungary, succeeded in the acceptance of the Aromanians (&quot;Vlachs&quot;) as a separate millet (ethno-religious community) with the decree (irade, &quot;spoken will&quot;) of May 22, 1905 by Sultan Abdulhamid, so the Ullah millet (&quot;Vlach millet&quot;) could have its own churches and schools. This was a success of the Romanian national agitation policy in European Turkey in the last part of the 19th century. The day this event was announced, 23 May 1905 (the next day), is now commemorated as the Aromanian National Day.

Romania continued to subsidize schools until 1948, when the communist regime ended all links. George Padioti, an Aromanian author (born and living all his life in Greece) describes one of the last liturgy services in Vlach:

According to Sevold Braga in his treatise &quot;Die Aromunische Minderheit in Griechenland&quot; (Albumul Macedo-Roman II, Freiburg 1964), the Romanian help suddenly stopped with the coming of Communism. Braga&#x27;s explanation was that in fact Romania had shown its true face, having used the Aromanians for its own purposes during the Ottoman rule, but afterwards throwing them away and disowning them.

Greek historians, when mentioning the Vlachs that attended the Romanian-sponsored churches and schools of Macedonia, Epirus and parts of Albania, describe them as being victims of Romanian propaganda, suggesting that they sent their children to schools where they were taught that they are Romanians.

The Vlachs, recognized as a separate nation by the 1878 Treaty of Berlin, were for the first time incorporated in Greece only in 1881, when Thessaly and a part of Epirus were offered to Greece by the Great Powers. Having been split into two by the new borders, the bulk of the Vlachs of these province petitioned the Great Powers of the time to be let to stay within the boundaries of the Ottoman Empire, but in vain. Greece followed a policy of creating a Greater Greece, according to the &quot;Megali Idea&quot;. Most of the Aromanians became part of the Greek state in 1913 after the rest of Epirus and parts of Macedonia became part of Greece after the First Balkan War.

Roughly at the same time, the first studies regarding the Aromanians were published by western observers. Among these, names like Rebecca West, Osbert Lancaster or Sir Charles Eliot&#x27;s are worth to be mentioned. Lancaster, who visited Greece in 1947, stated:

===Interbellum and World War II===
The Inter-war period is of great interest regarding Aromanian history. The main event was the immigration of the Aromanians in the first decades of the 20th century. One of the reasons for the sudden departure of the Vlachs, had to do with the policies of the Greek state, who had to accommodate one and a half million of Greeks of Asia Minor following the 1923 exchange of populations between Greece and Turkey. In addition, the Romanian state had offered them land and privileges, in order to populate its new province of Dobruja, soon after annexing it from Bulgaria. The 25% of the region&#x27;s population still traces its origins in Greece.

The last important episode concerns the Principality of Pindus episode. During World War II, the Italian occupation of Greece provided an opportunity for some Aromanians to create what they called &quot;Vlach homeland&quot;. This fascist puppet state would not survive even nominally past Italy&#x27;s exit from the war in September 1943.

===Post-war situation in Greece===
Aromanians today come after more than 50 years after the closure of the last school and church in the Vlach language. The old term &quot;Vlachos&quot; is still used as a &quot;pejorative&quot; by Greeks. After the Regime of the Colonels fell in 1974 however, the first local cultural organizations were formed to prevent the extinction of the language and culture. These organisations never had any government support. The Aromanian language had never been included in the educational curriculum of Greece, as it had always been considered a vulgar language. On the contrary, their use has been strongly discouraged. Such attitudes have led many Vlach parents to discourage their children from learning their mother tongue in order to avoid discrimination and maltreatment. Currently there is no education for Aromanian children in their mother tongue, and there are no public television or radio stations broadcasting fully or partially in Aromanian.

After pressure from the Union for Aromanian Language and Culture in Germany, the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (PACE) examined a report on the Aromanians in 1997 which reported the critical situation of the Aromanian language and culture, and adopted Recommendation 1333 (1997) in which it was said that the Greek government, among others, should do whatever is necessary to respect their culture and facilitate education in Aromanian and to implement its use in schools, churches and the media. The Greek Vlachs oppose the introduction of the language into the education system as European Union and leading Greek political figures have suggested, viewing it as an artificial distinction between them and other Greeks. For example, the former education minister, George Papandreou, received a negative response from Aromanian mayors and associations to his proposal for a trial Aromanian language education programme. The Panhellenic Federation of Cultural Associations of Vlachs expressed strong opposition to PACE&#x27;s recommendation in 1997 that the tuition of Aromanian be supported so as to avoid its extinction. On the other hand, there is a small minority within the community which strongly supports such efforts. On a visit to Metsovo, Epirus in 1998, the Greek President Costis Stephanopoulos called on Aromanians to speak and teach their language, so as not to be lost. There are currently no schools or churches teaching and holding services in Aromanian language.

While many Aromanians identify themselves as both Vlachs and Greeks, a small segment of the native Vlach inhabitants of Greece identify themselves as fully separate from the Greeks. This appears to be the case of some of the more remote villages of Pindus, where, sheltered somehow from contact with the dominant Greek culture, the older generation of the Vlachs converses in a separate language and customs. German academic Thede Kahl, whose broader perspective on the Aromanian community in Greece has been questioned by some nationalists, argues in his study &quot;&quot;Ethnologica Balkanica (&quot;The Ethnicity of Aromanians after 1990: the Identity of a Minority that Behaves like a Majority&quot;)&quot;&quot;:

Debate and discussion continues, with differing perspectives. Vlachs in Greece insist they are happy in practicing their dual identity. Some Vlachs outside Greece suggest difficulties may still be illustrated by the Sotiris Bletsas case. Bletsas was arrested in Greece while distributing copies of European Bureau for Lesser-Used Languages material covering linguistic minorities in Greece at an Aromanian festival in 1995. He was put on trial on 2 February 2001 and was first convicted, but was subsequently cleared on 18 October 2001.
