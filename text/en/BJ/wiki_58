<text>Campione d&#x27;Italia (; ) is a (municipality) of the Province of Como in the Italian region of Lombardy. Located on the shores of Lake Lugano, it is an enclave surrounded by the Swiss canton of Ticino. At its closest, the enclave is less than from the rest of Italy, but the intervening mountainous terrain requires a journey by road through the Swiss village of Bissone of over to reach the nearest Italian town, Lanzo d&#x27;Intelvi, and over to reach the city of Como.

==History==
In the first century BC, the Romans founded the garrison town of Campilonum to protect their territories from Helvetii invasions.

In 777, Toto of Campione, a local Lombard lord, left his inheritance to the archbishopric of Milan. Ownership was transferred to the abbey of Sant’Ambrogio. In 1512, the surrounding area of Ticino was transferred from the ownership of the bishop of Como to Switzerland by Pope Julius II, as thanks for the support in the War of the Holy League. However, the abbey maintained control over what is now Campione d&#x27;Italia and some territory on the western bank of Lake Lugano.

When Ticino chose to become part of the Swiss Confederation in 1798, the people of Campione chose to remain part of the Cisalpine Republic. In 1800, Ticino proposed exchanging Indemini for Campione. In 1814 a referendum was held, and the residents of Campione opposed it. In 1848, during the wars of Italian unification, Campione petitioned Switzerland for annexation. This was rejected due to the Swiss desire for neutrality.

After the Italian unification in 1861, all land west of Lake Lugano and half of the lake were given to Switzerland so that Swiss trade and transport would not have to pass through Italy. The &quot;d&#x27;Italia&quot; was added to the name of Campione in the 1930s by the regime of Italian dictator Benito Mussolini, making the name translatable to &quot;Champion of Italy&quot;, and an ornamental gate to the village was built. This was to assert the enclave&#x27;s Italian character.

During World War II, the US Office of Strategic Services (OSS – the precursor to the CIA), partly through Berne OSS chief Allen Welsh Dulles, maintained a unit in Campione for operations in Italy. At the time the Italian fascist regime did not have control over the enclave. The Swiss ignored the situation as long as the Americans kept a low profile. Postage stamps were issued during this period inscribed &quot;Campione d&#x27;Italia&quot; and valued in Swiss currency.

==Demography==
The population of the enclave according to the Italian Census was:
==Economy and administration==
Campione has had a considerable amount of economic and administrative integration with Switzerland, but against the wishes of its residents, it formally became part of the EU customs territory on 1 January 2020. VAT will apply, but the tax rate will remain that of Switzerland (much lower than that of Italy). A border crossing will be established.

Prior to that time, it was &quot;de facto&quot; in the customs territory of Switzerland, meaning most of the public services were carried out by Swiss providers, such as refuse collection, telecommunications, and vehicle registration. The enclave enjoyed considerable tax breaks and was exempt from VAT. Campione d&#x27;Italia was one of four Italian cities issued a casino licence and took advantage of this by operating the Casinò di Campione, as gambling laws are less strict than in either Italy or Switzerland; also a legacy of the pre-World War II era. Although (as part of Italy) the euro is formally the only legal tender, in practice the main operating currency in the commune has been the Swiss franc, but euros are widely accepted. Salaries are paid in Swiss francs.

Pursuant to bilateral agreements, Italians residing in Campione also benefit from many services and facilities located in Swiss territory, such as hospital care, that would otherwise be available only to Swiss residents. People working in Campione but living in Switzerland have access to Swiss unemployment and other state help, which does not apply to those living within Campione village limits, which is legally Italy.

Firefighters and ambulances are provided by the Swiss authorities. However, security is provided by the Carabinieri (Italian military police) and the village also has a Polizia Locale group.

Previously, mail could be sent to Campione using either a Swiss postal code (CH-6911) or an Italian one (IT-22061) via Switzerland or Italy, but the Swiss postal code has ceased to be valid, with mail instead being charged at the same international rate as that between Switzerland and Italy. Consequently, all mail is now processed and delivered by Poste Italiane, not Swiss Post. The telephone system remains Swiss, meaning that calls from Italy and all other countries outside Switzerland require the international dialling code for Switzerland, +41, with the exception of the town hall, which can be reached using the code for Italy, +39. 

Similarly, motor vehicles, which used Ticino registration plates, were no longer allowed to do so, or to be insured in Switzerland. Instead, they were required to be registered in Como. However, electricity has always been supplied from Italy.

=== Casinò di Campione ===
The Casinò di Campione was the largest employer in the municipality up until its closure in 2018. The casino then reopened in 2022. It was founded in 1917, owned by the Italian government, and operated by the municipality. The income from the casino was sufficient for the operation of Campione without the imposition of taxes, or obtaining of other revenue. It was Europe&#x27;s largest casino.

The casino was declared bankrupt on 27 July 2018. The economic impact was a threat to the entire village, with everything from pizzeria owners and taxi drivers to the municipal fire department on the list of creditors. Locals feared that without the casino, the commune would become a ghost town. Under the customs deal of 2020 Italy agreed to settle debts to Swiss creditors estimated at nearly €5 million. The casino re-opened on 26 January 2022.

==Education==
Schools within the comune are the Scuola Materna G. Garibaldi, the &quot;Scuola Elementare&quot;, and the &quot;Scuola Media&quot;.

== Sports ==
AP Campionese is a football club based in Campione d&#x27;Italia. The club plays in the Swiss football league system.

<doc id="365922" wikidata="Q3489941" url="?curid=365922" title="3rd Summit of the Americas">
<text>The 3rd Summit of the Americas was a summit held in Quebec City, Quebec, Canada, on April 20–22, 2001.

This international meeting was a round of negotiations regarding a proposed Free Trade Area of the Americas. The talks are perhaps better known for the security preparations and demonstrations (known as the Quebec City protest) that surrounded them than for the progress of the negotiations.

==Overview==
The &quot;Summits of the Americas&quot; is the name for a continuing series of summits bringing together the leaders of North America and South America. The function of these summits is to foster discussion of a variety of issues affecting the western hemisphere. These high-level summit meetings have been organized by a number of multilateral bodies under the aegis of the Organization of American States. In the early 1990s, what were formerly &quot;ad hoc&quot; summits came to be institutionalized into a regular &quot;Summits of the Americas&quot; conference program.

* December 9–11, 1994 – 1st Summit of the Americas at Miami in the United States.
* December 7–8, 1996 – Summit of the Americas on Sustainable Development at Santa Cruz de la Sierra in Bolivia.
* April 18–19, 1998 – 2nd Summit of the Americas at Santiago in Chile.

== Progress of the negotiations ==
The talks were the third in the negotiation process for the FTAA. 34 heads of state and government met in Quebec City, representing all the countries of North and South America, except Cuba. Partially due to resistance from the leaders of some poorer countries, no deal was reached in Quebec City.

The participants did make a statement titled &quot;The Declaration of Quebec City&quot; which includes the quotation: &quot;We, the democratically elected Heads of State and Government of the Americas, have met in Quebec City at our Third Summit, to renew our commitment to hemispheric integration&quot; 

== Security and public response ==
===Preparations===

From the beginning, the authorities indicated their intent to use very intensive security measures to restrict the ability of anti- and alter-globalization movement protesters to approach the area where the summit was to take place, in light of the well-known previous incidents in Seattle (November 30, 1999), Prague (September 26, 2000), and Montreal (November 20, 2000).

The most controversial of these preparations was the construction of a 3-metre high concrete and wire fence around a large section of La Colline Parlementaire that encircled the meeting site, the National Assembly and many government and residential buildings. Only residents, summit delegates and certain accredited journalists were allowed inside. Businesses and churches within the area were not permitted to open.

The Royal Canadian Mounted Police, in collaboration with the Canadian Forces, the Canadian Security Intelligence Service, Sûreté du Québec and local municipal police forces provided security.

===Protests===
The Quebec City protests (called A20) were one of the largest anti-globalization demonstrations to that point, attracting some 20,000 protesters from throughout the Americas. Groups represented at the protest included trade unions, civil society groups such as Greenpeace and the Council of Canadians, New Democratic Party and Parti Québécois caucuses, and a great many groups from faith communities, universities and colleges.

In addition to the political concerns of the anti-globalization movement, many focused their attention on the division of the city with the security barrier, and what they saw as the draconic nature of police responses.

Protesters began to arrive on Friday, April 20, many being hosted at Université Laval, college campuses, and churches. A number of clashes with police took place on Friday afternoon, with the first perimeter breach on Boulevard René-Lévesque Est, less than 5 minutes after the protesters arrived at the site, and in the evening. Many peaceful gatherings, including a vegan supper and concert underneath the Dufferin-Montmorency Autoroute, also took place.
The primary day of protests was Friday, April 20. It began with the Second Peoples&#x27; Summit of the Americas, an educational and political gathering near the Gare du Palais, in the lower city east of the summit site. From there, the protesters marched northwest along Boulevard Charest towards Rue de la Couronne. The number of people marching has been estimated at anywhere from 50,000 to 150,000.

Protests were divided into three classes: &quot;green zone,&quot; being legal protests with no risk of arrest; &quot;yellow zone,&quot; peaceful, unsanctioned protest with some risk of arrest or confrontation with police, and &quot;red zone,&quot; being direct acts of civil disobedience carrying a high risk of arrest. This innovative division was developed after the G-20 protest in Montreal in October 2000, which though meant to be peaceful suffered from sporadic violence. A number of riot police on horseback were used to disperse the violent protestors. The zone system was meant to protect those who do not wish to run the risk of arrest or of police violence.

At Rue de la Couronne, the protest march split, with the majority of protesters (the green zone) heading north, towards a main rally at the Colisée.
Protesters favouring the yellow or red zones headed south, towards Cap Diamant. Many spread out through the Saint-Jean Baptiste area north of and below the fence; others marched along the edge of the mountain on Côte d&#x27;Abraham towards its intersection with the Dufferin-Montmorency Autoroute, through which the fence passed. Peaceful protesters, including individuals running speaker&#x27;s corners, were in great numbers throughout this area during the afternoon.

Protestors who headed towards the yellow and red zones confronted the fence. Approximately 15 minutes after the bulk of the march reached the fence on Boulevard René Lévesque, the fence was brought down by protestors, which the security personnel deemed a clear security threat and danger not only to the conference delegates in the area, but also to the police.

A number of people moved into the once fenced-off area, and a catapult that launched teddy bears was rolled in. Eventually, the police line fell back and was replaced by a second line of officers, all wearing gas masks. The protestors were then repulsed by the police.
Police responded to the protesters in the &quot;green zone&quot; by firing tear gas canisters, water cannon, and rubber bullets, dispersing large groupings of protesters both violent and peaceful, including teach-ins and teams of medics providing first aid to other protesters. Other tactical interventions aimed at arresting various perceived movement leaders and the expulsion of the independent media centre and protest clinic from their locations. So much tear gas was used that delegates were incommoded inside their meeting halls. The security wall was breached on several occasions, though protester incursion across the perimeter was limited. According to David Graeber in his book &quot;Direct Action: An Ethnography&quot;, &quot;plastic bullets were being used increasingly, and from guns with laser sights so at night people could often see that the cops were intentionally aiming for heads or groins.&quot;

Protests continued into the night. In addition to continued peaceful protests and acts of civil disobedience, some protesters vandalized storefronts and advertisements and built bonfires. Police continued to respond with tear gas, in several cases firing at areas beneath the mountain where no protests were taking place, as well as with direct assaults on protester positions.

Protests concluded on Sunday, April 22.

===Response to protest conduct===

Police claimed that their actions were justified in protecting delegates from &quot;red-zone&quot; attempts to break through the fence, as well as to violent protesters destroying property and attacking the police, the media, and other protesters.
Many protesters accuse the police of excessive force, claiming that the police&#x27;s abundant use of tear gas and rubber bullets was both completely disproportionate to the scale of violence, and primarily directed at unarmed, peaceful demonstrators with dispersal of violent protesters an afterthought. A number of protesters were severely injured by rubber bullets; also, tear gas canisters were fired directly at protesters on numerous occasions, in violation of the protocols governing their use. They also criticize the actions of prison authorities. Altogether, the anti-globalization movement describes the actions of the police in Quebec City as an attempt to suppress dissent.

Intelligence operations prior to the event were also criticized, For example, Joan Russow, then leader of the Green Party of Canada, was arrested while attempting to photograph the prison where protesters would be held. During the event, some prominent protesters such as Jaggi Singh were arrested by undercover police officers while they were engaging in legal activities in &quot;green-zone&quot; areas.

A formal complaint regarding the RCMP&#x27;s conduct was filed by New Democrat MP Svend Robinson with the Commission for Public Complaints against the RCMP. On November 13, 2003, the complaint&#x27;s chairwoman Shirley Heafey found that &quot;RCMP members used excessive and unjustified force in releasing tear gas to move the protesters when a more measured response could have been attempted first.&quot; The commission recommended improved crowd-control techniques, disciplinary action against certain officers, and a formal apology to protesters.

<text>Rakaposhi (; ) also known as Dumani () is a mountain within the Karakoram range in Gilgit-Baltistan in Pakistan-administered Kashmir. It is situated in the middle of the Nagar and the Bagrote Valleys. The mountain is extremely broad, measuring almost from east to west. It is the only peak on earth that descends directly and without interruption for almost 6,000 meters from its summit to its base.

==Geography==
Rakaposhi is a mountain in the Karakoram mountain range in the Gilgit-Baltistan territory, about north of the city of Gilgit. It is the 27th-highest mountain in the world. Rakaposhi rises over the Nagar Valley.

Rakaposhi is the only mountain in the world with more than 5,000 meters height between its base camp and its summit; by contrast, all of the other tallest mountains in the world have less than 5,000 meters from base camp to the top.

The first successful recorded ascent was in 1958 by Mike Banks and Tom Patey, members of a British expedition, via the southwest Spur/Ridge route. It was over 20 years before another team successful reached the summit, in 1979.

==Park==

Rakaposhi is also known as Dumani (&quot;Mother of Mist&quot; or &quot;Mother of Clouds&quot;). The people of Nagar and Bagrot Valley have dedicated the Rakaposhi range mountain area as a community park. The minister for the northern areas inaugurated the park. The Rakaposhi mountain range is the home of endangered species such as Marco Polo sheep, snow leopard, brown bear, and wolves.

==Notable features==

Rakaposhi is notable for its exceptional rise over local terrain. On the north, it rises in only an 11.2 km (7 mi) horizontal distance from the Hunza River. There are views of Rakaposhi from the Karakoram Highway on the route through Nagar. A tourist spot in the town of Ghulmet (located in the Hunza Valley) called &quot;Zero Point of Rakaposhi&quot; is the closest view point of the mountain.

Rakaposhi is the only mountain in the world that rises straight from the nearby cultivated fields to the height of 25,550 feet. From many places this wonderful spectacle can be viewed right from the base to the top.

==Time line==

* 1892 Martin Conway explored the south side of Rakaposhi.
* 1938 M. Vyvyan and R. Campbell Secord made the first reconnaissance and climbed a north-western forepeak (about ) via the northwest ridge.
* 1947 Secord returned with H. W. Tilman and two Swiss climbers, Hans Gyr and Robert Kappeler; they ascended via the Gunti glacier to 5,800 m (19,000 ft) on the south-west spur.
* 1954 A Cambridge University team, led by Alfred Tissières, attempted the peak via the south-west spur but only reached 6,340 m (20,800 ft). Tissières&#x27; party included Major General Mian Hayaud Din, the Chief of General Staff of the Pakistan Army and liaison officer, and George Band who was a member of the team that made the first ascent of Everest in 1953 and was later to be part of the team who made the first ascent of Kangchenjunga. An Austro-German expedition led by Mathias Rebitsch also attempted the same route on the mountain a couple of months earlier in the season but, because of the avalanche risk in the Rakaposhi area at the time, they moved to climb in an area c. 40 km to the NE.
* 1956 A British-American expedition, led by Mike Banks, reached 7,163 m (23,500 ft) on the Southwest Ridge, above the Gunti glacier.
* 1958 The first successful recorded ascent: Mike Banks and Tom Patey, members of a British expedition, via the Southwest Spur/Ridge route. They both suffered minor frostbite during the ascent to the summit on June 25. 
* 1964 An Irish expedition, led by Paddy O’Leary with Joss Lynam as deputy, attempted the long and difficult Northwest Ridge.
* 1971 Karl Herrligkoffer led an attempt on the elegant but difficult North Spur (or North Ridge).
* 1973 Herrligkoffer returned to the North Spur but was again unsuccessful due to time and weather problems.
* 1979 A Polish-Pakistan expedition ascended the Northwest Ridge from the Biro Glacier.
* 1979 A Japanese expedition from Waseda University, led by Eiho Ohtani, succeeded in climbing the North Spur. Summit party: Ohtani and Matsushi Yamashita. This ascent was expedition-style, done over a period of six weeks, with 5000 m of fixed rope.
* 1984 A Canadian team achieves a semi-alpine-style ascent of the North Spur, using much less fixed rope than the Japanese team had. Summit party: Barry Blanchard, David Cheesmond, Kevin Doyle.
* 1985-1987 Various unsuccessful attempts on the long East Ridge.
* 1986 A Dutch team climbed a variation of the Northwest Ridge route.
* 1995 An ascent via the Northwest Ridge.
* 1997 An ascent via the Southwest Spur/Ridge (possibly the original route).
* 2000 An attempt from the east side Bagrot Valley Hinercha Glacier.
* 2002 A Canadian caliber attempt period of 2 weeks from front side of base camp Hinercha glacier Bagrote valley gilgit east side.
*2004 An attempt from the east side Bagrot Valley Hinercha Glacier.
*2019 An ascent by two Japanese mountainers, Kazuya Hiraide and Kenro Nakajima.
*2021 A successful ascent by Wajidullah Nagari and two Czech climbers, Jacob Vicek and Peter Macek.
==Climbing routes==

The routes with successful summits so far have been (see the timeline as well):
* Southwest Spur/Ridge (first ascent route). Long, but not exceedingly technical. Some tricky gendarmes (rock pinnacles). Has been repeated.
* From the east side, it is short route to climb 
* Northwest Ridge. Long, and more technically difficult than the Southwest Spur/Ridge. Has been repeated.
* North Spur (a.k.a. North Ridge). Shorter than the above two routes, but much more technically difficult. Has been repeated, including a semi-alpine style (capsule-style) ascent.

Attempts have also been made from the east side Bagrot Valley Hinearcha Glacier, the East Ridge, and the North Face.

<text>Mount Kenya (Meru: &quot;Kĩrĩmaara,&quot; Kikuyu: &quot;Kĩrĩnyaga&quot;, Kamba: &quot;Ki nyaa&quot;, Embu: &quot;Kĩ nyaga&quot;) is an extinct volcano in Kenya and the second-highest peak in Africa, after Kilimanjaro. The highest peaks of the mountain are Batian (), Nelion () and Point Lenana (). Mount Kenya is located in the former Eastern and Central provinces of Kenya; its peak is now the intersection of Meru, Embu, Kirinyaga, Nyeri and Tharaka Nithi counties, about south of the equator, around north-northeast of the capital Nairobi. Mount Kenya is the source of the name of the Republic of Kenya.

Mount Kenya is a volcano created approximately 3 million years after the opening of the East African Rift. Before glaciation, it was high. It was covered by an ice cap for thousands of years. This has resulted in very eroded slopes and numerous valleys radiating from the peak. There are currently 11 small glaciers, which are shrinking rapidly, and may disappear by 2050. The forested slopes are an important source of water for much of Kenya.

There are several vegetation bands from the base to the peak. The lower slopes are covered by different types of forest. Many alpine species are endemic to Mount Kenya, such as the giant lobelias and senecios and a local subspecies of rock hyrax. An area of around the centre of the mountain was designated a National Park and listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1997. The park receives over 16,000 visitors per year.

==Mount Kenya National Park==
Mount Kenya National Park, established in 1949, protects the region surrounding the mountain. Currently, the national park is within the forest reserve which encircles it. In April 1978 the area was designated a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve. The national park and the forest reserve, combined, became a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1997.

The Government of Kenya had four reasons for creating a national park on and around Mount Kenya. These were the importance of tourism for the local and national economies, preserving an area of great scenic beauty, conserving the biodiversity within the park, and preserving the water catchment for the surrounding area.

Kenya&#x27;s government has announced a project to discourage animals from straying into small holdings surrounding the Park and devastating crops, which will see the Park enclosed by an electric fence with five electrified strands. Kenya&#x27;s Rhino Ark Trust, a non-profit organization, has been putting up fences in key areas around the country. As of 2021, 250 kilometres (160 miles) out of a planned 450 kilometres (280 miles) have been constructed in the Mt. Kenya area. The fence discharges an electric shock, but is not dangerous to humans or animals.

==Local culture==

The main ethnic groups living around Mount Kenya are Kikuyu, Ameru, Embu and Maasai. The first three are Bantus while the Maasai are Nilotes. The mountain is as an important aspect of their cultures. They arrived in the Mount Kenya area in the last several hundreds of years.

===Kikuyu===

The Kikuyu people live on the southern and western sides of the mountain. They are agriculturalists, and make use of the highly fertile volcanic soil on the lower slopes. They believe that God, &quot;Ngai&quot; or &quot;Mwene Nyaga&quot;, lived on Mount Kenya when he came down from the sky. They believe that the mountain is Ngai&#x27;s throne on earth. It is the place where Gĩkũyũ, the father of the tribe, used to meet with God. Thus according to the Kikuyu records, Gĩkũyũ is the first person on Earth to ascend the mountain. &#x27;Mwene Nyaga&#x27; in the Kikuyu language can also translate as the &quot;Owner of the Ostriches&quot; or &quot;Owner of the white patches (of snow)&quot; where &#x27;Mwene&#x27; translates to &#x27;owner&#x27;, and &#x27;Nyaga&#x27; to Ostriches or white patches. The snow (in Kikuyu: Ira) caps of the mountain symbolically represent a crown on God&#x27;s habitation.
Kikuyu used to build their houses with doors facing the mountain. The Kikuyu name for Mount Kenya is &quot;Kirima Kĩrĩ Nyaga&quot; (Mt. Kirinyaga), which literally translates to the mountain that has the &quot;Nyaga&quot; – Ostriches. The mountain, therefore, is locally accepted as &#x27;God&#x27;s Resting Place&#x27; or &#x27;Where God Lives&#x27;.

The Kikuyu name for Mt. Kenya is &quot;Kĩrĩnyaga&quot; which literally means &#x27;the one with the ostrich&#x27;. The ostrich has dark feathers and a white tail– when the bird bends its head to the ground with its tail in the air, its body forms a triangular shape with a white peak, closely resembling the snow capped mountain of Kĩrĩnyaga. The name &quot;Kĩrĩnyaga&quot; therefore figuratively means &#x27;the one with white tails&#x27;, referring to the glaciers among the peaks of the mountain.

Translated to the Kamba language, &quot;kĩrĩnyaga,&quot; would be &quot;ki nyaa&quot;. This is the name that Ludwig Krapf was given when he sighted the mountain from Kitui (in Kamba county). He recorded it as Kenya. It became the name of not only the mountain but also the country.

===Embu===
The Embu people live to the south-east of Mount Kenya, and believe that the mountain is God&#x27;s home (the Embu word for God is &quot;Ngai&quot;, &quot;Murungu&quot; or &quot;Mwene Njeru&quot;).The Embu name for Mount Kenya is &#x27;Kĩ nyaga&#x27; which means similar to the Kikuyu &#x27;the one with the ostrich&#x27;. The mountain is sacred, and they build their houses with the doors facing toward it. The Embu people are closely related to the Ameru and Mbeere people. The Mbeere and Akamba are the settlers of the southeast side of the mountain.

===Ameru===
The Ameru occupy the east, north, and north-western slopes of the mountain. They are generally agricultural and also keep livestock and occupy what is among the most fertile land in Kenya. The Meru god &quot;Murungu&quot; was from the skies. Their name for Mt. Kenya is &quot;Kirimaara&quot;, which means &#x27;mountain with white features&#x27;.

===Maasai===

The Maasai are semi-nomadic people, who use the land to the north of the mountain to graze their cattle. They believe that their ancestors came down from the mountain at the beginning of time. The Maasai name for Mount Kenya is &quot;Ol Donyo Keri&quot;, which means &#x27;mountain of stripes&#x27;, referring to the dark shades as observed from the surrounding plains. At least one Maasai prayer refers to Mount Kenya:
==Geology==
Mount Kenya is a stratovolcano that was active in the Plio-Pleistocene. The original crater was probably over high; and potentially up to high, making the prehistoric Mount Kenya higher than present-day Kilimanjaro. Since it became extinct there have been two major periods of glaciation, which are shown by two main rings of moraines below the glaciers. The lowest moraine is found at around . Today the glaciers reach no lower than . After studying the moraines, Gregory put forward the theory that at one time the whole summit of the mountain was covered with an ice cap, and it was this that eroded the peaks to how they are today.

The lower slopes of the mountain have never been glaciated. They are now mainly cultivated and forested. They are distinguished by steep-sided V-shaped valleys with many tributaries. Higher up the mountain, in the area that is now moorland, the valleys become U-shaped and shallower with flatter bottoms. These were created by glaciation.

When Mount Kenya was active there was some satellite activity. The northeastern side of the mountain has many old volcanic plugs and craters. The largest of these, Ithanguni, even had its own ice cap when the main peaks were covered in ice. This can be seen by the smoothed summit of the peak. Circular hills with steep sides are also frequent in this area, which are probably the remains of small plugged vents. However, as the remaining mountain is roughly symmetrical, most of the activity must have occurred at the central plug.

The rocks that form Mount Kenya are mainly basalts, rhomb porphyrites, phonolites, kenytes and trachytes. Kenyte was first reported by Gregory in 1900 following his study of the geology of Mount Kenya.

The geology of the Mount Kenya area was first described scientifically by Joseph Thomson in 1883. He saw the mountain from the nearby Laikipia Plateau and wrote that it was an extinct volcano with the plug exposed. However, as he had only seen the mountain from a distance his description was not widely believed in Europe, particularly after 1887 when Teleki and von Höhnel ascended the mountain and described what they considered to be the crater. In 1893 Gregory&#x27;s expedition reached the Lewis Glacier at . He confirmed that the volcano was extinct and that there were glaciers present. The first thorough survey by Europeans was not undertaken until 1966.

==Peaks==

The peaks of Mount Kenya are almost all of volcanic origin. The majority of the peaks are located near the centre of the mountain which have an Alpine appearance due to their craggy nature. Typically of Alpine terrain, the highest peaks and gendarmes occur at the intersection of ridges. The central peaks only have a few mosses, lichens, and small alpine plants growing in rock crevices. Further away from the central peaks, the volcanic plugs are covered in volcanic ash and soils. The vegetation growing on these peaks is typical for their vegetation band.

The highest peaks are Batian (), Nelion () and Pt Lenana (). Batian and Nelion are within of each other, separated by the &quot;Gate of the Mists&quot; gap of .

Other peaks around the central plug include Pt Piggot (), Pt Dutton (), Pt John (), Pt John Minor (), Krapf Rognon (), Pt Peter (), Pt Slade () and Midget Peak (). All of these have a steep pyramidal form.

Significant craggy outlying peaks include Terere () and Sendeyo () which form a pair of twin peaks to the north of the main plug. Together, they form a large parasitic plug. Other notable peaks include The Hat (), Delamere Peak, Macmillan Peak and Rotundu.

==Glaciers==

The glaciers on Mount Kenya are retreating rapidly. The Mountain Club of Kenya in Nairobi has photographs showing the mountain at the time of the first recorded ascent in 1899, and again more recently; the retreat of the glaciers is very evident. Descriptions of ascents of several of the peaks advise the use of crampons, but this is true only in some cases and at higher elevations. Every year there is less new snow accumulating in winter than melting in summer, even on the Lewis Glacier (the largest of them) in winter, so there is no formation of new ice. It is predicted to be less than 30 years before there will no longer be ice on Mount Kenya. Glacial retreat and disappearance can be caused by changes in temperature trends, or by a change in precipitation trends.

The glacier names are (clockwise from the north):
* Northey(, Krapf, Gregory, Lewis, Diamond, Darwin, Forel, Heim, Tyndall, Cesar, Josef.
The total area covered by glaciers on the mountain was recorded as about in the 1980s, far less than that recorded by the first observations, made in the 1890s. A new 2024 study shows that only 10% of the surface-area mentioned for the 1980&#x27;s remains (6,9 ha remains, about half as much as in 2016). 

===Periglacial landforms===
Although Mount Kenya is on the equator the freezing nightly temperatures result in periglacial landforms. There is permafrost a few centimetres (inches) below the surface. Patterned ground is present at to the west of Mugi Hill. These mounds grow because the repeated freezing and thawing of the ground draws in more water. There are blockfields present around where the ground has cracked to form hexagons. Solifluction occurs when the night temperatures freeze the soil before it thaws again in the morning. This daily expansion and contraction of the soil prevent the establishment of vegetation.

==Rivers==

Mount Kenya is the main water catchment area for two large rivers in Kenya; the Tana, the largest river in Kenya, and the Ewaso Nyiro North. The Mount Kenya ecosystem provides water directly for over 2 million people. The rivers on Mount Kenya have been named after the villages on the slopes of the mountain that they flow close to. The Thuchi River is the district boundary between Tharaka Nithi and Embu. Mount Kenya is a major water tower for the Tana river which in 1988 supplied 80% of Kenya&#x27;s electricity using a series of seven hydroelectric power stations and dams.

The density of streams is very high, especially on the lower slopes which have never been glaciated. The ice cap which used to cover the mountain during the Pliocene eroded large U-shaped valleys which tend to only have one large stream.
Where the original shape of the shield volcano is still preserved, there have been millions of years for streams to erode the hillside. This area is therefore characterised by frequent deep fluvial V-shaped valleys.
The gradual transition from glaciated to the fluvial valley can be clearly observed.

Rivers that start on Mount Kenya are the tributaries of two large Kenyan rivers: the Tana and the Ewaso Ng&#x27;iro rivers. A lot of Mount Kenyan rivers flow into the Sagana which itself is a tributary of the Tana, which joins at the Masinga Reservoir. The rivers in the northern part of the mountain, such as the Burguret, Naru Moru, Nanyuki, Likii, and Sirimon flow into the Ewaso Nyiro. The rivers to the southwest, such as the Keringa and Nairobi flow into the Sagana and then into the Tana. The remaining rivers to the south and east, such as the Kathitâ (Largest River in Meru), Mutonga, Nithi, Thuchi, and Nyamindi, flow directly into the Tana.

==Natural history==
Mount Kenya has several altitudinal ecological zones, from the savanna surrounding the mountain to the nival zone by the glaciers. Each zone has a dominant species of vegetation. Many of the species found higher up the mountain are endemic, either to Mount Kenya or East Africa.

There are also differences within the zones, depending on the side of the mountain and the aspect of the slope. The southeast is much wetter than the north, so species more dependent on moisture can grow. Some species, such as African alpine bamboo, are limited to certain aspects of the mountain because of the amount of moisture.

===Zones===

The climate of Mount Kenya changes considerably with altitude, forming belts of community types. Around the base of the mountain is fertile farmland. The people living around the mountain have cultivated this cool, relatively moist area for centuries.

Mount Kenya is surrounded by forests. The vegetation in the forests depend on rainfall, and the species present differ greatly between the northern and southern slopes. As time has passed the trees on the edge of the forest have been logged and the farmland has encroached further up the fertile slopes of the mountain.

Above the forest is a belt of African alpine bamboo. This zone is almost continuous but is restricted to small isolated bunches in the north because of low rainfall. The bamboo is natural, and does not require forest disturbance. Tracks are common through the bamboo. Bamboo suppresses other vegetation, so it is uncommon to find trees or other plants here.
Above the bamboo is the timberline forest. The trees here are often smaller than the trees in the forests lower down the mountain. The forest here is more intact because it is less accessible and better protected.

When the trees can no longer grow the vegetation changes into heathland and chaparral, at around . Heathland is found in the wetter areas, on the west side of Mount Kenya, and is dominated by giant heathers. Chaparral is found in drier areas and grasses are more common. and bushfires still occur.

As the altitude increases the temperature fluctuations become extreme and the air becomes thinner and drier. This region is known as the Afro-alpine zone. The environment here is isolated, with the only similar area nearby being the Aberdares, which are away. Many of the species here are endemic, with adaptations to the cold and fluctuating temperatures. Typical plants here include giant groundsels (senecios) and giant lobelias.

The region where the glaciers have recently retreated from is nival zone. It is the area that plants have not yet been able to colonise.

===Flora===

The flora found on Mount Kenya varies with altitude, aspect, and exposure. As the altitude increases, the plants have to be more specialised, with adaptations to strong sunlight with ultraviolet, lower mean temperatures, and freezing night temperatures.

Plants in the Afro-alpine zone have overcome these difficulties in several ways. One adaptation is known as the giant rosette, which is exhibited by giant senecio, giant lobelia, and giant thistle (&quot;Carduus&quot;), which use bud leaves to protect their buds from freezing. Giant rosette senecios form single-aged stands that drive community structure over decades.

Many plant species in the Afro-alpine zone of Mount Kenya are giant versions of lowland (or temperate) relatives. However, nearer the nival zone the plants decrease in size again.

===Fauna===

The majority of animals live lower down on the slopes of Mount Kenya. Here there is more vegetation and the climate is less extreme. Various species of monkeys, several antelopes, tree hyrax, porcupines, and some larger animals such as elephants and buffalo all live in the forest. Predators found here include hyenas and leopards, and occasionally lions.

There are fewer mammals found at high altitudes on Mount Kenya. The Mount Kenya hyrax and common duiker can live here, and are important to the ecosystem. Some smaller mammals, such as the groove-toothed rat, can live here by burrowing into the giant senecios and using their thick stem of dead leaves as insulation. The Mount Kenya mole-rat &quot;Tachyoryctes rex&quot; occurs at high altitudes, living in visible mounds. Leopards are resident in the alpine zone.

Other mammal species are only occasional visitors. Remains of elephants, monkeys, and bongo have been found high in the alpine zone, and other sightings are remembered in names such as Simba Tarn (simba means lion in Swahili).

Several bird species live in the Afro-alpine zone, including sunbirds, alpine chats and starlings and the raptors, augur buzzard, lammergeier and Verreaux&#x27;s eagle, the latter of which specializes in hunting hyraxes. Birds are important in this ecosystem as pollinators.

==Climate==

The climate of Mount Kenya has played a critical role in the development of the mountain, influencing the topography and ecology amongst other factors. It has a typical equatorial mountain climate which Hedberg described as &quot;winter every night and summer every day.&quot; Mount Kenya is home to one of the Global Atmosphere Watch&#x27;s atmospheric monitoring stations.

===Seasons===

The year is divided into two distinct wet seasons and two distinct dry seasons which mirror the wet and dry seasons in the Kenyan lowlands. As Mount Kenya ranges in height from , the climate varies considerably over the mountain and has different zones of influence. The lower, southeastern slopes are the wettest as the predominant weather system comes from the Indian ocean. This rainfall supports dense montane forests on these slopes. High on the mountain most of the precipitation falls as snow. Combined, these water sources feed 11 glaciers.

The current climate on Mount Kenya is wet, but drier than it has been in the past. The temperatures span a wide range, which diminishes with altitude. In the lower alpine zone temperature usually do not go below . Snow and rain are common from March to December, but especially in the two wet seasons. The wet seasons combined account for 5/6 or 83% of the annual precipitation. The monsoon, which controls the wet and dry seasons, means that for most of the year there are south-easterly winds, but during January and February the dominant wind direction is north-easterly.

Mount Kenya, like most locations in the tropics, has two wet seasons and two dry seasons as a result of the monsoon. From mid-March to June the heavy rain season, known as the &quot;long rains&quot;, brings approximately half of the annual rainfall on the mountain. This is followed by the wetter of the two dry seasons which lasts until September. October to December are the &quot;short rains&quot; when the mountain receives approximately a third of its rainfall total. Finally from December to mid-March is the drier dry season when the mountain experiences the least rain.

===Daily pattern===
During the dry season, the mountain almost always follows the same daily weather pattern. Large daily temperature fluctuations occur which led Hedberg to exclaim &quot;winter every night and summer every day.&quot; There is variation in minimum and maximum temperatures day to day, but the standard deviation of the mean hourly pattern is small.
A typical day is clear and cool in the morning with low humidity. The mountain is in direct sunlight which causes the temperatures to rise quickly with the warmest temperatures occurring between 09:00 and 12:00. This corresponds to a maximum in the pressure, usually around 10:00. Low on the mountain, between , clouds begin to form over the western forest zone, due to moist air from Lake Victoria. The anabatic winds caused by warm rising air gradually bring these clouds to the summit region in the afternoon. Around 15:00 there is a minimum in sunlight and a maximum in humidity causing the actual and perceived temperature to drop. At 16:00 there is a minimum of pressure. This daily cover of clouds protects the glaciers on the southwest of the mountain which would otherwise get direct sun every day, enhancing their melt. The upwelling cloud eventually reaches the dry easterly air streams and dissipates, leading to a clear sky by 17:00. There is another maximum temperature associated with this.

Being an equatorial mountain the daylight hours are constant with twelve-hour days. Sunrise is about 06:30 with the sun setting at 18:30 (both EAT = UTC+3). Over the year there is a one-minute difference between the shortest and longest days. At night, the sky is usually clear with katabatic winds blowing down the valleys. Above the lower alpine zone there is usually frost every night.

==History==

===European documentation===

The first European to report seeing Mount Kenya was Dr Johann Ludwig Krapf, a German missionary, from Kitui,
a town away from the mountain. The sighting was made on 3 December 1849,
a year after the first sighting of Mount Kilimanjaro by a European.

Krapf was told by the Embu people that lived around the mountain that they did not ascend high enough on the mountain because of the intense cold and the white matter that rolled down the mountains with a loud noise. This led him to infer that glaciers existed on the mountain. It was Krapf who gave the mountain the name &quot;Kenya&quot;, but the derivation of this is not known with certainty.
Krapf also noted that the rivers flowing from Mount Kenya, and other mountains in the area, were continuously flowing. This was very different from the other rivers in the area, which swelled up in the wet season and completely dried up after the rainy season had ended. As the streams flowed even in the driest seasons he concluded that there must be a source of water up on the mountain, in the form of glaciers. He believed the mountain to be the source of the White Nile.

In 1851 Krapf returned to Kitui. He travelled closer to the mountain, but did not see it again. In 1877 Hildebrandt was in the Kitui area and heard stories about the mountain, but also did not see it. Since there were no confirmations to back up Krapf&#x27;s claim people began to be suspicious.

In 1883 Joseph Thomson passed close by the west side of the mountain and confirmed Krapf&#x27;s claim. He diverted his expedition and reached up the slopes of the mountain but had to retreat because of trouble with local people. The first European exploration high onto the mountain was achieved in 1887 by Count Sámuel Teleki. He managed to reach on the southwestern slopes. On this expedition Teleki mistakenly believed he had found the crater of a volcano.

In 1892, Teleki and von Höhnel returned to the eastern side but were unable to get through the forest.

In 1893, an expedition managed to ascend Mount Kenya as far as the glaciers. This expedition was traveling from the coast to Lake Baringo in the Rift Valley and was led by Dr. John W Gregory, a British geologist. They managed to ascend the mountain to around and spent several hours on the Lewis Glacier with their guide. On his return to Britain, Gregory published papers and a narrative account of his achievements.

George Kolb, a German physician, made expeditions in 1894 and 1896 and was the first to reach the moorlands on the east side of the mountain. More exploration occurred after 1899 when the Uganda Railway was completed as far as the future site of Nairobi.

===Mackinder&#x27;s expedition===
On 28 July 1899, Sir Halford John Mackinder set out from the site of Nairobi on an expedition to Mount Kenya. The members of the expedition consisted of 6 Europeans, 66 Swahilis, 2 Maasai guides, and 96 Kikuyu. The Europeans were Campbell B. Hausberg, second in command and photographer; Douglas Saunders, botanist; C F Camburn, taxidermist; Cesar Ollier, guide; and Josef Brocherel, guide, and porter.
The expedition made it as far as the mountain but encountered many difficulties on the way. The country they passed through was full of plague and famine. Many Kikuyu porters tried to desert with women from the villages, and others stole from the villages, which made the chiefs very hostile towards the expedition. When they reached the base camp on 18 August, they could not find any food, suffered two of their party killed by the local people, and eventually had to send Saunders to Naivasha to get help from Captain Gorges, the Government Officer there.

Mackinder pushed on up the mountain and established a camp at in the Höhnel Valley. He made his first attempt on the summit on 30 August with Ollier and Brocherel up the southeast face, but they had to retreat when they were within of the summit of Nelion due to nightfall.

On 5 September, Hausberg, Ollier, and Brocherel made a circuit of the main peaks looking for an easier route to the summit. They could not find one. On 11 September Ollier and Brocherel made an ascent of the Darwin Glacier, but were forced to retreat due to a blizzard.

When Saunders returned from Naivasha with the relief party, Mackinder had another attempt at the summit with Ollier and Brocherel. They traversed the Lewis Glacier and climbed the southeast face of Nelion. They spent the night near the gendarme and traversed the snowfield at the head of the Darwin Glacier at dawn before cutting steps up the Diamond Glacier. They reached the summit of Batian at noon on 13 September 1899 and descended by the same route.

During the expedition, Mackinder ordered for 8 of the 90 African porters, who he had bought from a slave owner to carry his supplies, to be shot.

===1900–1930===

After the first ascent of Mount Kenya, there were fewer expeditions there for a while. The majority of the exploration until after the First World War was by settlers in Kenya, who were not on scientific expeditions. A Church of Scotland mission was set up in Chogoria, and several Scottish missionaries ascended to the peaks, including Rev Dr. J. W. Arthur, G. Dennis and A. R. Barlow. There were other ascents, but none succeeded in summitting Batian or Nelion.

New approach routes were cleared through the forest, which made access to the area of the peak far easier. In 1920, Arthur and Sir Fowell Buxton tried to cut a route in from the south, and other routes came in from Nanyuki in the north, but the most commonly used was the route from the Chogoria mission in the east, built by Ernest Carr. Carr is also credited with building Urumandi and Top Huts.

On 6 January 1929, the first ascent of Nelion was made by Percy Wyn-Harris and Eric Shipton. They climbed the Normal Route, then descended to the Gate of Mists before ascending Batian. On 8 January they reascended, this time with G. A. Sommerfelt, and in December Shipton made another ascent with R. E. G. Russell. They also made the first ascent of Point John. During this year the Mountain Club of East Africa was formed.

At the end of July 1930, Shipton and Bill Tilman made the first traverse of the peaks. They ascended by the West Ridge of Batian, traversed the Gate of Mists to Nelion, and descended the Normal Route. During this trip, Shipton and Tilman made the first ascents of several other peaks, including Point Peter, Point Dutton, Midget Peak, Point Pigott, and either Terere or Sendeyo.

===1931 to present day===
In the early 1930s, there were several visits to the moorlands around Mount Kenya, with fewer as far as the peaks. Raymond Hook and Humphrey Slade ascended to map the mountain, and stocked several of the streams with trout. By 1938 there had been several more ascents of Nelion. In February, Miss C Carroll and Mtu Muthara became the first woman and African respectively to ascend Nelion, in an expedition with Noel Symington, author of &quot;The Night Climbers of Cambridge&quot;, and on 5 March Miss Una Cameron became the first woman to ascend Batian.

During the Second World War there was another drop in the ascents of the mountain. The most remarkable ascent during this period was by three Italians who were being held in a British POW camp at the base of the mountain in Nanyuki. They escaped from camp to climb the mountain&#x27;s third peak, Point Lenana, before &quot;escaping&quot; back into camp. Felice Benuzzi, the team leader, retold his story in the book &quot;No Picnic on Mount Kenya&quot; (1946).

In 1949 the Mountain Club of Kenya split from the Mountain Club of East Africa, and the area above was designated a National Park. A road was built from Naro Moru to the moorlands, allowing easier access.

Many new routes were climbed on Batian and Nelion in the next three decades, and in October 1959 the Mountain Club of Kenya produced their first guide to Mount Kenya and Kilimanjaro. On Kenyan independence in 1963, Kisoi Munyao raised the Kenyan flag at the top of the mountain. He died in 2007 and was given a heroic funeral attended by the Kenyan president Mwai Kibaki. In the early 1970s the Mount Kenya National Park Mountain Rescue Team was formed, and by the end of the 1970s, all major routes on the peaks had been climbed.

On 19 July 2003, a South African registered aircraft, carrying 12 passengers and two crew, crashed into Mount Kenya at Point Lenana; nobody survived. This was not the first aircraft lost on the mountain; there is also the wreckage of at least one helicopter that crashed before 1972.

In March 2012 a massive fire raged on Mount Kenya, devouring thousands of hectares of ancient forests and endangered wildlife.

==Mountaineering==

===Climbing routes===

Most of the peaks on Mount Kenya have been summited. The majority of these involve rock climbing as the easiest route, although some only require a scramble or a walk. The highest peak that can be ascended without climbing is Point Lenana, . The majority of the 15,000 visitors to the national park each year climb this peak. In contrast, approximately 200 people summit Nelion and 50 summit Batian, the two highest peaks.

When ascended directly, Batian is usually climbed via the North Face Standard Route, UIAA grade IV+ (or 5.6+ YDS). The first recorded ascent of Batian was on 13 September 1899 by Sir Halford John Mackinder, Cesar Ollier, and Josef Brocherel. The Normal Route is the most climbed route up Nelion, and thence across to Batian. It was first climbed by Eric Shipton and Percy Wyn-Harris on 6 January 1929. It is possible to traverse between the two peaks, via the Gates of Mist, but this often involves spending a night in the Howell hut on top of Nelion. There is a bolted abseil descent route off Nelion.

Mount Kenya&#x27;s climbing seasons are a result of its location only from the equator. During the northern summer, the rock routes on the north side of the peak are in good summer condition, while at the same time, the ice routes on the south side of the peak are in prime shape. The situation is reversed during the southern summer. The two seasons are separated by several months of the rainy season before and after, during which climbing conditions are generally unfavorable.

Mount Kenya is home to several good ice routes, the two most famous being the Diamond Couloir and the Ice Window route. Snow and ice levels on the mountain have been retreating at an accelerated rate in recent years, making these climbs increasingly difficult and dangerous. The Diamond Couloir, a steep ice couloir fed by the fusion of the upper Diamond Glacier, was first climbed by National Park staff Phil Snyder and Thumbi Mathenge in October 1973. A direct finish was pioneered in 1975 by Yvon Chouinard and Michael Covington The couloir was once climbable in summer or winter but now is virtually unclimbable in summer conditions and is seldom deemed in climbable condition even in winter. Last climbing reports describe the route very difficult, especially in the lower section. The route has changed into a modern ice climb with a very difficult 60m first pitch, starting with 8m of overhanging M7 dry tooling, followed by 50m of USA Grade V ice and by 6 pitches of moderate climbing on good ice and finally one pitch of water ice USA Grade IV+ ice at the headwall before getting to the Upper Diamond Glacier.

The satellite peaks around the mountain also provide good climbs. These can be climbed in Alpine style and vary in difficulty from a scramble to climbing at UIAA grade VI. They are useful for acclimatisation before climbing the higher peaks and as ascents in their own right.

===Walking routes===

There are eight walking routes up to the main peaks. Starting clockwise from the north these are the: Meru, Chogoria, Kamweti, Naro Moru, Burguret, Sirimon, and Timau Routes.
Of these Chogoria, Naro Moru, and Sirimon are used most frequently and therefore have staffed gates. The other routes require special permission from the Kenya Wildlife Service to use.

The Chogoria route leads from Chogoria town up to the peaks circuit path. It heads through the forest to the south-east of the mountain to the moorland, with views over areas such as Ithanguni and the Giant&#x27;s Billiards Table before following the Gorges Valley past the Temple and up to Simba Col below Point Lenana. The Mountain Club of Kenya claims that Ithanguni and the Giant&#x27;s Billiards Table offer some of the best hillwalking in Kenya.

The Naro Moru route is taken by many of the trekkers who try to reach Point Lenana. It can be ascended in only 3 days and has bunkhouses at each camp. The route starts at Naro Moru town to the west of the mountain and climbs towards Mackinder&#x27;s Camp before joining the Peak Circuit Path. The terrain is usually good, although one section is called the Vertical Bog.

The Sirimon route approaches Mount Kenya from the northwest. The path splits on the moorlands, with the more frequently used fork following the Mackinder Valley and the quieter route traversing into the Liki North Valley. The paths rejoin at Shipton&#x27;s Cave just below Shipton&#x27;s Camp on the Peak Circuit Path.

The Peak Circuit Path is a path around the main peaks, with a distance of about and height gain and loss of over . It can be walked in one day, but more commonly takes two or three. It can also be used to join different ascent and descent routes. The route does not require technical climbing.

Development is currently underway for a new route up the mountain starting from the Ragati conservancy and running up the ridge between the Naro Moru route and the old Kamweti trail.

==Etymology==

The origin of the name Kenya is not clear but perhaps linked to the Kikuyu, Embu, and Kamba words &quot;Kirinyaga&quot;, &quot;Kirenyaa&quot; and &quot;Kiinyaa&quot; which mean &quot;God&#x27;s resting place&quot; in all three languages.

In the 19th Century, the German explorer, Ludwig Krapf, recorded the name as both &quot;Kenia&quot; and &quot;Kegnia&quot; believed by some to be a corruption of the Kamba version.
Others however say that this was on the contrary a very precise notation of the correct African pronunciation .
 Wangari Maathai tells the following story about the naming: Krapf and Johannes Rebmann asked their guide, a member of the Kamba community, who was carrying a gourd, what they called the mountain, and the guide, believing that the Germans were referring to the gourd, replied &quot;kĩĩ-nyaa&quot;, which became the name of the mountain and then the country.
In any case, the name was for a long time pronounced by colonial-heritage Europeans as . The European pronunciation has been abandoned in modern times, in favor of the African version.

===Names of peaks===
The peaks of Mount Kenya have been given names from three different sources. Firstly, several Maasai chieftains have been commemorated, with names such as Batian, Nelion, and Lenana. They commemorate Mbatian, a Maasai Laibon (Medicine Man), Nelieng, his brother, and Lenana and Sendeyo, his sons. Terere is named after another Maasai headman.

The second type of name that was given to peaks is after European climbers and explorers. Some examples of this are Shipton, Sommerfelt, Tilman, Dutton, and Arthur.

The remaining names are after well-known Kenyan personalities, except John and Peter, which were named by the missionary Arthur after two disciples. There is a group of four peaks to the east of the main peaks named after European settlers; Coryndon, Grigg, Delamere, and McMillan.

<text>The Laplace–Stieltjes transform, named for Pierre-Simon Laplace and Thomas Joannes Stieltjes, is an integral transform similar to the Laplace transform. For real-valued functions, it is the Laplace transform of a Stieltjes measure, however it is often defined for functions with values in a Banach space. It is useful in a number of areas of mathematics, including functional analysis, and certain areas of theoretical and applied probability.

==Real-valued functions==
The Laplace–Stieltjes transform of a real-valued function &quot;g&quot; is given by a Lebesgue–Stieltjes integral of the form

:formula_1

for &quot;s&quot; a complex number. As with the usual Laplace transform, one gets a slightly different transform depending on the domain of integration, and for the integral to be defined, one also needs to require that &quot;g&quot; be of bounded variation on the region of integration. The most common are:

* The bilateral (or two-sided) Laplace–Stieltjes transform is given by formula_2
* The unilateral (one-sided) Laplace–Stieltjes transform is given by formula_3 The limit is necessary to ensure the transform captures a possible jump in at , as is needed to make sense of the Laplace transform of the Dirac delta function.
* More general transforms can be considered by integrating over a contour in the complex plane; see .

The Laplace–Stieltjes transform in the case of a scalar-valued function is thus seen to be a special case of the Laplace transform of a Stieltjes measure. To wit,

:formula_4

In particular, it shares many properties with the usual Laplace transform. For instance, the convolution theorem holds:

:formula_5

Often only real values of the variable &quot;s&quot; are considered, although if the integral exists as a proper Lebesgue integral for a given real value , then it also exists for all complex with .

The Laplace–Stieltjes transform appears naturally in the following context. If &quot;X&quot; is a random variable with cumulative distribution function &quot;F&quot;, then the Laplace–Stieltjes transform is given by the expectation:

:formula_6

The Laplace-Stieltjes transform of a real random variable&#x27;s cumulative distribution function is therefore equal to the random variable&#x27;s moment-generating function, but with the sign of the argument reversed.

==Vector measures==
Whereas the Laplace–Stieltjes transform of a real-valued function is a special case of the Laplace transform of a measure applied to the associated Stieltjes measure, the conventional Laplace transform cannot handle vector measures: measures with values in a Banach space. These are, however, important in connection with the study of semigroups that arise in partial differential equations, harmonic analysis, and probability theory. The most important semigroups are, respectively, the heat semigroup, Riemann-Liouville semigroup, and Brownian motion and other infinitely divisible processes.

Let &quot;g&quot; be a function from [0,∞) to a Banach space &quot;X&quot; of strongly bounded variation over every finite interval. This means that, for every fixed subinterval [0,&quot;T&quot;] one has

:formula_7

where the supremum is taken over all partitions of [0,&quot;T&quot;]

:formula_8

The Stieltjes integral with respect to the vector measure &quot;dg&quot;

:formula_9

is defined as a Riemann–Stieltjes integral. Indeed, if π is the tagged partition of the interval [0,&quot;T&quot;] with subdivision , distinguished points formula_10 and mesh size formula_11 the Riemann–Stieltjes integral is defined as the value of the limit

:formula_12

taken in the topology on &quot;X&quot;. The hypothesis of strong bounded variation guarantees convergence.

If in the topology of &quot;X&quot; the limit

:formula_13

exists, then the value of this limit is the Laplace–Stieltjes transform of &quot;g&quot;.

==Related transforms==

The Laplace–Stieltjes transform is closely related to other integral transforms, including the Fourier transform and the Laplace transform. In particular, note the following:

* If &quot;g&quot; has derivative &quot;g&#x27; &quot; then the Laplace–Stieltjes transform of &quot;g&quot; is the Laplace transform of &quot;g′&quot;. formula_14
* We can obtain the Fourier–Stieltjes transform of &quot;g&quot; (and, by the above note, the Fourier transform of &quot;g′&quot;) by formula_15
==Probability distributions==
If &quot;X&quot; is a continuous random variable with cumulative distribution function &quot;F&quot;(&quot;t&quot;) then moments of &quot;X&quot; can be computed using

:formula_16

===Exponential distribution===

For an exponentially distributed random variable &quot;Y&quot; with rate parameter &quot;λ&quot; the LST is,

:formula_17

from which the first three moments can be computed as 1/&quot;λ&quot;, 2/&quot;λ&quot;2 and 6/&quot;λ&quot;3.

===Erlang distribution===

For &quot;Z&quot; with Erlang distribution (which is the sum of &quot;n&quot; exponential distributions) we use the fact that the probability distribution of the sum of independent random variables is equal to the convolution of their probability distributions. So if
:formula_18

with the &quot;Yi&quot; independent then
:formula_19
therefore in the case where &quot;Z&quot; has an Erlang distribution,
:formula_20

===Uniform distribution===
For &quot;U&quot; with uniform distribution on the interval (&quot;a&quot;,&quot;b&quot;), the transform is given by

:formula_21

<text>In the Zone is the fourth studio album by American singer Britney Spears. It was released on November 15, 2003, by Jive Records. Spears began writing songs during her Dream Within a Dream Tour, not knowing the direction of the record. She stated she was an autobiographical songwriter, although not to the point where she felt self-exploited. During the process, she ended her highly-publicized relationship with singer Justin Timberlake. With the tour&#x27;s conclusion in July 2002, Spears planned to take a six-month break from her career; however, recording for the album commenced in November.

For &quot;In the Zone&quot;, Spears experimented with different producers, trying to find those with whom she had chemistry. She collaborated with artists such as Madonna and the Ying Yang Twins, while contributions came from a wide range of producers, including Bloodshy &amp; Avant, R. Kelly, Trixster, Moby, Guy Sigsworth and the Matrix. Their final result was an eclectic record incorporating pop and urban music styles with instrumentation from techno and Middle Eastern genres. Its lyrical themes range from romance and partying to more explicit ones such as sex and masturbation. Spears explained that the album&#x27;s sexual nature was subconscious and emerged while she was in the process of developing the album.

&quot;In the Zone&quot; received positive reviews upon its release, with music critics widely praising its innovative production, aesthetics, lyricism and blend of eclectic genres, though some criticized Spears&#x27; vocals on certain tracks for being distant and processed. A global commercial success, it debuted atop the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 with first-week sales of 609,000 copies, making Spears the first female artist to have her first four albums reach number one. Retrospectively, the album is widely considered a major turning point in Spears&#x27; artistic journey and a culmination in her transition from a teen pop star to a more adult artist. Various critics have considered it the album that pushed Spears past her contemporaries and establishing her as the definitive female artist of the 2000s.

&quot;In the Zone&quot; was promoted with four singles. &quot;Me Against the Music&quot;, featuring Madonna, reached the top ten in nearly every country except the United States, where it only peaked at number 35 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. &quot;Toxic&quot; peaked atop the charts in eight countries and at number nine on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, becoming Spears&#x27; first US top-ten hit since &quot;Oops!... I Did It Again&quot; (2000), and won Spears her first Grammy Award. &quot;Everytime&quot; peaked at number 15 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and within the top ten nearly everywhere else. &quot;Outrageous&quot; was plagued by a lack of promotion due to Spears injuring her knee while filming its accompanying music video, and only peaked at number 79 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. To further promote the album, Spears embarked on the Onyx Hotel Tour (2004).

== Background and development ==
In October 2001, Spears released her third studio album &quot;Britney&quot;, which portrayed more mature themes. Despite selling over four million copies in the United States, it was viewed as &quot;poor-selling&quot; in comparison to her previous efforts. The following year, her three-year relationship with pop singer Justin Timberlake ended after months of speculation. After the Dream Within a Dream Tour in support of &quot;Britney&quot; ended in July 2002, Spears announced a six-month break. In November, she revealed that she had started working on her next studio album. She explained: &quot;Well, actually, I just said that I wanted two or three weeks off. [...] And the whole world was like, &#x27;Ohmigod, [&quot;sic&quot;] she&#x27;s gone...&quot;

While in Europe, Spears met with William Orbit and Daft Punk about possible collaborations, and originally confirmed previous collaborators Darkchild and the Neptunes as producers. When asked by &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; about the direction of the record, Spears responded it was an organic evolution, adding: &quot;It should just happen naturally from the way you feel. [...] Whatever happens, happens&quot;. Additionally, Spears scheduled meet-and-greets with Timbaland and Missy Elliott in an effort to help evolve her sound. Elliott was enlisted in further production work with Nisan Stewart for Spears&#x27; project; however, none of the initial material was released. Spears also worked with James Murphy of LCD Soundsystem, but their work was unproductive; Murphy said: &quot;We were both lying on the floor, head-to head, working on lyrics in a notepad. She seemed eager to please, but it went nowhere. She went to dinner and just never came back.&quot; Limp Bizkit frontman Fred Durst wrote and produced three trip hop tracks recorded by Spears in January 2003. However, after news of an affair between them broke, Durst told Jive Records he would not let them use the songs. In March 2003, Lauren Christy from the Matrix spoke about the development of the album with MTV News, and likened their work with Spears to Madonna&#x27;s album &quot;Ray of Light&quot; (1998). Scott Spock, also from the Matrix, continued comparing her to Madonna by saying:

She&#x27;s taking it to the next level in her career. Madonna constantly takes what&#x27;s in the club and puts what she does on top of it and makes it mainstream. I think Britney is starting to embrace that concept where she&#x27;s looking to work on different stuff, instead of using the same familiar, and applying it to her. [...] I don&#x27;t think [her fans] will be freaked out or upset. I think they&#x27;ll be really into what&#x27;s going to happen.

Spears previewed several songs to Quddus Philippe of MTV in May 2003, including &quot;Touch of My Hand&quot;, &quot;Brave New Girl&quot; and &quot;Everytime&quot;. Spears commented: &quot;I&#x27;ve really been able to take my time and have creative control and make [the new album] special, special, special.&quot; On August 27, Spears opened the 2003 MTV Video Music Awards by performing a medley of &quot;Like a Virgin&quot; and &quot;Hollywood&quot; with Madonna, Christina Aguilera and Missy Elliott. The performance started with Spears appearing on stage on top of a giant wedding cake while wearing a wedding gown and veil; she sang the first few lines of &quot;Like a Virgin&quot; before Aguilera appeared from behind the cake and joined her. Madonna then emerged from the cake wearing a black coat and a hat and started singing &quot;Hollywood&quot; before proceeding to kiss Spears and Aguilera on the lips. Elliott came out from a wedding chapel to sing her song &quot;Work It&quot; halfway through the performance. The kiss generated strong reaction from the media. The performance was listed by &quot;Blender&quot; magazine as one of the 25 sexiest music moments in television history. In 2008, MTV listed the performance as the number-one opening moment in the history of the MTV Video Music Awards.

== Recording and production ==

For &quot;In the Zone&quot;, Spears worked with hit producers such as Bloodshy &amp; Avant, R. Kelly, Diddy, Christopher Stewart, Moby, Guy Sigsworth and the Matrix. She first started writing songs for the album during her Dream Within a Dream Tour. Spears commented about writing while touring: &quot;The only thing that was scary to me is that I didn&#x27;t know if they were good. [But] You can&#x27;t trust anybody. You have to go with your feelings.&quot; Spears commented that she was an autobiographical songwriter, although not to the point she felt self-exploited. Following the end of the tour, Spears invited her friend and backing vocalist Annet Artani to her home in Los Angeles. They started writing songs at the piano, and shortly after, they traveled to Lake Como in Lombardy, Italy. Among the tracks they worked on was &quot;Everytime&quot;, which Artani confirmed to be written as a response to Justin Timberlake&#x27;s &quot;Cry Me a River&quot;, as well as &quot;Shine&quot;, written by Spears about her sister Jamie Lynn, which was left unfinished. Earnest recording of the album began in November 2002. Spears commented that although she did not know initially what direction she wanted to go with the album, she took time to work with different producers and to find those who she had chemistry with. The first song recorded for &quot;In the Zone&quot; was &quot;Touch of My Hand&quot;, and Spears said it &quot;really did provide a balance for the rest of the record. We just went from there.&quot; Following the recording sessions for &quot;Everytime&quot; at the Conway Recording Studios in Los Angeles, Spears complimented Sigsworth, saying: &quot;I just basically told him exactly how I wanted the song to sound. And he was so amazing because there&#x27;s a lot of producers you tell them things and they don&#x27;t get it. And you&#x27;re like oh, that&#x27;s not the right way. He got it just right. He was amazing.&quot;

Christopher Stewart and Penelope Magnet, known collectively as RedZone, presented Spears with the third song they had written and produced, titled &quot;Pop Culture Whore&quot;. While her management liked the track, she rejected it, telling them the song &quot;sucked&quot;. After bonding with Spears during a night in New York City to &quot;get in her world&quot;, as Magnet explained, it was easier to &quot;actually write and know what she would and wouldn&#x27;t say, to know where her real vibe is&quot;. Stewart and Magnet began working on the first version of &quot;Me Against the Music&quot;; Stewart came up with the track, while Magnet developed the melody on a piano and some of the lyrics. During the recording sessions, Stewart recalls that the studio&#x27;s air-conditioning died for three days, but Spears &quot;didn&#x27;t complain or anything, and for me that shows she&#x27;s where she is for a reason.&quot; While rehearsing for their performance at the 2003 MTV Video Music Awards, Spears played a finished version of &quot;Me Against the Music&quot; to Madonna. After Madonna commented that she liked the track, Spears asked her to do the song with her. RedZone then handed &quot;Me Against the Music&quot; to Madonna, who arranged and recorded her vocal additions on her own, therefore making the song a duet. Spears, who had been a fan of Madonna for years, was &quot;beyond surprised&quot; when she heard Madonna&#x27;s verse. She said &quot;I just asked her to do a little thing, but she really went there. She did a lot of stuff to it.&quot; RedZone were then enlisted to work on several more songs for the album, including co-writing &quot;Early Mornin&#x27;&quot;, recording background vocals for &quot;Outrageous&quot; and producing &quot;The Hook Up&quot;.

The Matrix commented that after they presented songs to Spears, she tailored them to suit herself, especially the lyrics. Member Lauren Christy said: &quot;... she really knows what she wants. She knows if she&#x27;s trying something on that doesn&#x27;t fit right for her. She&#x27;s like, &#x27;No, that&#x27;s not me.&#x27; She&#x27;s not one to strap on some sort of fake image.&quot; Christy also claimed to be impressed with Spears&#x27;s vocal ability during the recording of &quot;Shadow&quot;. Steve Anderson, Lisa Greene and Stephen Lee wrote &quot;Breathe on Me&quot; at Metrophonic Studios in London. Before meeting with the other writers, Anderson thought of two concepts for songs specifically for Spears: one he had worked on &quot;for ages&quot;, and &quot;Breathe on Me&quot;, which he drafted on the morning of the sessions. Greene and Lee did not like the first concept, and they wrote &quot;Breathe on Me&quot; with Anderson. The song was produced by Mark Taylor, who kept most of the programming done by Anderson. With Taylor, Spears recorded &quot;Breathe on Me&quot; and &quot;And Then We Kiss&quot;, latter of which did not make the album. Other recording locations for the album included the Battery Studios, Daddy&#x27;s House Recordings and The Dojo in New York City; 3:20 Studios, Decoy Studios, Pacifique Recording Studios, Record Plant and Westlake Recording Studios in Los Angeles; The Chocolate Factory, in Chicago, Triangle Sound Studios in Atlanta, Olympic Studios in London, and Murlyn Studios in Stockholm. Throughout 2003, Spears started testing tracks by playing them in nightclubs such as Show in New York City. Before the album was released, Spears&#x27; manager Larry Rudolph commented that it was important for Spears to continue moving away from a traditional pop sound, citing &quot;I&#x27;m a Slave 4 U&quot; and &quot;Boys&quot; from &quot;Britney&quot; as departures from her previous music. Barry Weiss, then-president of Jive Label Group, added: &quot;She has achieved what she set out to achieve, which was to make a mature album that didn&#x27;t sound like something she would have done three years while still making a commercial album that has hit singles. [...] It&#x27;s the kind of record she should be doing right now, and it came down to her to make it.&quot;

== Music and lyrics ==
According to &quot;Billboard&quot;, &quot;In the Zone&quot; marked a musical departure for Spears. Instead of traditional pop, the album is darker and more dance-oriented. Spears talked about the overall sound of the album with &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, saying: &quot;I&#x27;d describe it as trance-y, kind of vibe record—something you could listen to that&#x27;s no so song-structured [...] Of course I&#x27;m not doing &#x27;...Baby One More Time&#x27; and those massive hits anymore. I think this record is where I am at right now in my life. It&#x27;s sensual, it&#x27;s sexual. I&#x27;m probably writing about that subconsciously because I don&#x27;t have that right now.&quot; Sal Cinquemani of &quot;Slant Magazine&quot; described the record&#x27;s sound as &quot;bold mix of hip-hop and dance music&quot;, while Amy Schriefer of NPR stated the album &quot;mix[es] dance, house, crunk, Diwali beats and Neptunes-style hip hop&quot;. Tom Bishop of BBC News stated that the record combines bhaṅgṛā, R&amp;B and hip hop. Caroline Sullivan of &quot;The Guardian&quot; deemed &quot;In the Zone&quot; &quot;a happy collision of house, dreamy electro-pop and Britney’s lyrical preoccupations [...] which have her perched on the cusp between teen poppet and sexually confident woman.&quot; According to William Shaw of &quot;Blender&quot;, the main theme of &quot;In the Zone&quot; is &quot;Spears’s awakening to her sexuality as a single woman.&quot;

&quot;In the Zone&quot; opens with &quot;Me Against the Music&quot;, constructed as a duet with Madonna after she was added to the track. Spears and Madonna trade lines during the verses, and Madonna sings solo in the bridge. The instrumentation in the song includes influences of hip hop and funk guitars. The song&#x27;s lyrics feature Spears and Madonna singing of the pleasures of letting go on the dancefloor, in &quot;I&#x27;m up against the speaker / Trying to take on the music / It&#x27;s like a competition&quot;. The second song, &quot;I Got That (Boom Boom)&quot;, is an Atlanta-style hip hop track featuring the Ying Yang Twins. &quot;Showdown&quot; has &quot;bubbly&quot; beats and its lyrics, about &quot;fighting and making up with carnal relations&quot;, include the lines &quot;I don&#x27;t really want to be a tease / But would you undo my zipper, please?&quot; &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; classified the song pop-dancehall. &quot;Breathe on Me&quot; was described as the most sensual song of the record and compared to Madonna&#x27;s 1992 studio album &quot;Erotica&quot;. On the Euro trance and ambient-techno song with trip hop influences, Spears sings: &quot;Oh, it&#x27;s so hot, and I need some air / And boy, don&#x27;t stop &#x27;cause I&#x27;m halfway there&quot; and &quot;Just put your lips together and blow.&quot; &quot;Early Mornin&#x27;&quot; depicts Spears looking for men at a club in New York City. The song has a percolating beat and featured subdued vocals from Spears, who purrs and yawns through the track. The nightclub Show is referenced. &quot;Toxic&quot;, which Spears later named her favorite song from her career, was originally offered to Australian singer Kylie Minogue. It contains elements of hip hop, electropop, and bhangra music, and features varied instrumentation, such as drums, synthesizers, high-pitched strings and surf guitars. Lyrically, &quot;Toxic&quot; talks about being addicted to a lover.

&quot;Outrageous&quot; is a hip hop-inspired track which, according to MTV, features Spears &quot;whisper[ing] and moan[ing] [...] with a snake charmer melody giving the song an exotic feel.&quot; The lyrics address materialism and amusement, with the singer referencing in the chorus a number of things that give her pleasure. On &quot;Touch of My Hand&quot;, which Spears felt it was comparable to Janet Jackson&#x27;s &quot;That&#x27;s the Way Love Goes&quot; (1993), she sings in a lower register. The instrumentation contains elements of music from the Far East, particularly in its use of the Chinese instrument the erhu, and its lyrics refer to masturbation: &quot;Into the unknown, I will be bold / I&#x27;m going to the places I can be out of control / And I don&#x27;t want to explain tonight / All the things I&#x27;ve tried to hide.&quot; &quot;The Hook Up&quot; has a reggae feel and features Spears singing in a Jamaican Patois accent. The power ballad &quot;Shadow&quot; talks about how reminders of a lover can still linger after he&#x27;s gone. The lyrics of &quot;Brave New Girl&quot; talk about a young woman finding her passion and losing inhibitions. Backed by choppy, electro-funk beats, she sings in a bouncy near-rap: &quot;She&#x27;s gonna pack her bags, she&#x27;s going to find her way, she&#x27;s going to get right out of this / She don&#x27;t want New York, she don&#x27;t want L.A., she&#x27;s going to find that special kiss.&quot; The Eurodance and pop song was inspired by No Doubt, Blondie and Madonna. &quot;Everytime&quot; begins with a piano introduction accompanying Spears&#x27;s breathy vocals, which build from soft to strong throughout the song. Its lyrics are a plea for forgiveness for inadvertently hurting a former lover. In the song, Spears explains she feels unable to continue in lines such as &quot;Everytime I try to fly I fall / Without my wings I feel so small&quot;. During an interview with MTV, Spears said: &quot;It&#x27;s about heartbreak, it&#x27;s about your first love, your first true love. That&#x27;s something all people can relate to, because you all have that first love that you think you&#x27;re going to be with the rest of your life.&quot; When asked if &quot;Everytime&quot; was about Justin Timberlake, she responded: &quot;I&#x27;ll let the song speak for itself.&quot; The Rishi Rich&#x27;s Desi Kulcha Remix of &quot;Me Against the Music&quot; removes the original melody of the song and adds a clattering backbeat and Punjabi shouts. On the international editions bonus track &quot;The Answer&quot;, Spears sings that her lover is the answer to all her needs: &quot;Who can hold me tight, keep me warm through the night? / Who can wipe my tears when it&#x27;s wrong, make it right? / Who can give me love till I&#x27;m satisfied? / Who&#x27;s the one I need in my life?&quot;. On the Australian, Japanese and UK editions bonus track &quot;Don&#x27;t Hang Up&quot;, she pleads on the phone for her lover to keep her satisfied long-distance.

== Release and promotion ==

To promote &quot;In the Zone&quot;, Spears first performed the lead single &quot;Me Against the Music&quot; at the 2003 NFL Kickoff Live on September 4, 2003. The performance segued into a medley of &quot;...Baby One More Time&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;m a Slave 4 U&quot;, which included pyrotechnics. On September 14, Spears played a surprise concert at Rain Nightclub in the Palms Casino Resort, and performed &quot;Me Against the Music&quot;, &quot;Breathe on Me&quot; and a medley of &quot;...Baby One More Time&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;m a Slave 4 U&quot;. On October 18, she performed &quot;Me Against the Music&quot; and &quot;Everytime&quot; on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;. Spears opened the 2003 American Music Awards on November 16 with a performance of &quot;Me Against the Music&quot;. The following day, a concert special titled &quot;Britney Spears: In the Zone&quot; aired on American Broadcasting Company (ABC). On November 18–the day &quot;In the Zone&quot; was released in the United States–she performed &quot;Me Against the Music&quot; and &quot;(I Got That) Boom Boom&quot; on &quot;Total Request Live&quot; at Times Square. The ABC special and &quot;Total Request Live&quot; performances would later be included on video album &quot;Britney Spears: In the Zone&quot;, released on April 6, 2004. The video debuted atop the US Music Video Sales and was certified double platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). &quot;Me Against the Music&quot; was also performed on &quot;The Tonight Show with Jay Leno&quot; on November 17, 2003, and on &quot;Live with Regis and Kelly&quot; on November 24. She also performed &quot;Toxic&quot;, &quot;Breathe on Me&quot; and &quot;Me Against the Music&quot; as the headliner of the Jingle Ball on December 8, at the Staples Center.

In November 2003, Zomba Label Group president Barry Weiss had spoken to &quot;Billboard&quot; and said that &quot;In the Zone&quot; was being promoted on a global level, exhausting areas such as print and electronic media, television, radio and video to raise awareness of its release. In addition, Jive worked with lifestyle marketer the Karpel Group to market the album to the gay community. Other broader-based marketing efforts included a tie-in with marketing company LidRock, where after ordering a soda at Sbarro, customers received a cup featuring the artwork and a three-inch disc in the lid featuring &quot;Brave New Girl&quot; and songs by two other artists; in December, an updated LidRock disc was made available, including a remix of &quot;Me Against the Music&quot; without Madonna, as well as songs by fellow Jive acts Nick Cannon and Bowling for Soup. Regal Theaters also showed a short film that included footage of the making of Spears&#x27;s music videos. Two national television advertising campaigns had begun on November 1–one with a teaser ad on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; and another exclusively on MTV. No sponsored cross-marketing campaigns were planned, as Larry Rudolph explained: &quot;[This time] it&#x27;s going to be more about the music than about corporate tie-ins.&quot; In terms of international exposure, during a four-month period Spears was featured in seven mini TV-specials and over 150 interviews outside the US. Among the international performances were Spears opening the NRJ Music Awards in France with &quot;Toxic&quot; on January 24, 2004, and a performance of &quot;Everytime&quot; on the June 25 episode of &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; in the United Kingdom, which became the final televised performance in support of the album.
A tour to further promote &quot;In the Zone&quot; was announced in December 2003, originally titled In the Zone Tour. However, Spears was sued for trademark infringement by the San Diego company Lite Breeze, Inc. and was banned from using the phrase &quot;in the zone&quot;, hence the tour&#x27;s title was changed to The Onyx Hotel Tour. It commenced on March 2, 2004 at the San Diego Sports Arena. Spears felt inspired to create a show with a hotel theme which she later mixed with the concept of an onyx stone. The stage, inspired by Broadway musicals, was less elaborate than her previous tours. The setlist was composed mostly by songs from &quot;In the Zone&quot; as well as some of her past songs reworked with different elements of jazz, blues and Latin percussion. Tour promoter Clear Channel Entertainment marketed the tour to a more adult audience than her previous shows, while sponsor MTV highly promoted the tour on television shows and the network&#x27;s website. The tour was divided into seven segments: &quot;Check-In&quot;, &quot;Mystic Lounge&quot;, &quot;Mystic Garden&quot;, &quot;The Onyx Zone&quot;, &quot;Security Cameras&quot;, &quot;Club&quot; and the encore. &quot;Check-In&quot; displayed performances with dance and advanced in the hotel theme. &quot;Mystic Lounge&quot; featured an homage to &quot;Cabaret&quot; and other musicals, while remixing some of Spears&#x27;s early hits. &quot;Mystic Garden&quot; displayed a jungle-inspired stage. &quot;The Onyx Zone&quot; displayed a ballad performance with acrobats. &quot;Security Cameras&quot; was the raciest part of the show, with Spears and her dancers emulating different sexual practices. &quot;Club&quot; displayed a performance with urban influences. The encore consisted of a system malfunction interlude and Spears performed wearing a red ensemble. The tour received mixed reviews from contemporary critics, who praised it for being an entertaining show while criticizing it for looking &quot;more [like] a spectacle than an actual concert&quot;. The Onyx Hotel Tour was commercially successful, grossing $34 million. In March, Spears suffered a knee injury onstage which forced her to reschedule two shows. On June 8, Spears fell and hurt her knee again while filming the accompanying music video for &quot;Outrageous&quot;. She underwent surgery and the remainder of the tour was cancelled.

== Singles ==
&quot;Me Against the Music&quot; was released as the lead single from &quot;In the Zone&quot; on October 14, 2003. Jive Records&#x27; choice for the first single was originally &quot;Outrageous&quot;, but Spears convinced them to release &quot;Me Against the Music&quot;. The song received mixed reviews from music critics; some felt it was a strong dance track, while others referred to it as lackluster and disappointing. &quot;Me Against the Music&quot; achieved international commercial success, peaking atop of the charts in countries such as Australia, Denmark, Hungary, Ireland and Spain, as well as the European Hot 100 Singles. It also peaked at number two in Canada, Italy, Norway and the United Kingdom, and inside the top five in many other countries; however, it peaked at number 35 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, being Spears&#x27; lowest-charting lead single. The song won the Hot Dance Single of the Year award at the 2004 &quot;Billboard&quot; Music Awards. In the song&#x27;s accompanying music video, directed by Paul Hunter, Spears chases Madonna inside a nightclub.

&quot;Toxic&quot; was released as the second single from &quot;In the Zone&quot; on January 12, 2004, to widespread critical acclaim. After trying to choose between Jive&#x27;s suggestions &quot;(I Got That) Boom Boom&quot; and &quot;Outrageous&quot;, Spears selected &quot;Toxic&quot; instead. It attained worldwide commercial success, reaching the top five in 15 countries, while topping the charts in Australia, Canada, Hungary, Norway and the United Kingdom. In the United States, it peaked at number nine on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, becoming her first single to peak inside the top ten since &quot;Oops!... I Did It Again&quot; (2000). Directed by Joseph Kahn, the accompanying music video for the song portrays Spears as a secret agent in the search of a vial of green liquid. After she steals it, she enters an apartment and poisons her unfaithful boyfriend. The video also includes interspersed scenes of Spears naked with diamonds over her body. &quot;Toxic&quot; won Spears her first Grammy Award, for Best Dance Recording (2005), and is often referred to as one of her signature songs.

&quot;Everytime&quot; was released as the third single from &quot;In the Zone&quot; on May 10, 2004, to critical acclaim. A commercial success, it peaked within the top five in most countries, while reaching the top of the charts in Australia, Hungary, Ireland and the United Kingdom, and number 15 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. Its accompanying music video, directed by David LaChapelle, portrays Spears as a star hounded by paparazzi, who drowns in her bathtub when she starts bleeding from a wound in her head. In the hospital, doctors fail to resuscitate her while a child is born in the next room, implying she reincarnated. The original treatment would have had Spears killing herself from a drug overdose, but the plot was removed after it received criticism by several organizations, who perceived it as a glamorization of suicide.

&quot;Outrageous&quot; was released as the fourth and final single from &quot;In the Zone&quot; on July 13, 2004. The song was finally chosen as a single after it was selected as the theme song for the film &quot;Catwoman&quot; (2004). It received mixed reviews from critics, as some praised its funky sound, noting its influence from Michael and Janet Jackson, while others deemed it &quot;forgettable&quot;. Plagued by low promotion, the song became the album&#x27;s lowest-charting single, peaking at number 79 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. Directed by Dave Meyers, its accompanying music video was being filmed in New York City on June 8, when Spears injured her knee and had to undergo arthroscopic surgery. The video was cancelled, as well as the remainder of the Onyx Hotel Tour and the feature in the &quot;Catwoman&quot; soundtrack.

== Critical reception ==
Upon its release, &quot;In the Zone&quot; received generally favorable reviews from music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 66, based on 13 reviews. Jason Shawhan of About.com gave a positive review, saying that while the album&#x27;s vibe is sexy, the result is a personal statement from Spears. He also added: &quot;T[here]&#x27;s another thing about Spears&#x27; new record, as none of her previous albums ever managed to produce any kind of sustained emotional response than the pleasure that comes from a good pop record. I miss Max Martin, for sure, but it feels like Ms. S. has been paying attention to La Ciccone. To put it another way, this is Britney&#x27;s &quot;True Blue&quot;.&quot; Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic said that the album &quot;[is] all club-ready, but despite some hints of neo-electro and the Neptunes, it doesn&#x27;t quite sound modern—it sounds like cuts from 1993 or Madonna&#x27;s &quot;Bedtime Stories&quot; and &quot;Ray of Light&quot;. Production-wise, these tracks are not only accomplished but much more varied than any of her previous albums.&quot; Ruth Mitchell of the BBC called &quot;Early Mornin&#x27;&quot; the best track from the album, but added: &quot;Sadly, her attempts to prove her new-found maturity are what overwhelm and cloud all that is good about &quot;In The Zone&quot;.&quot; Mim Udovitch of &quot;Blender&quot; commented: &quot;This I&#x27;m-coming-out record is an unhesitant move from songs of the heart to songs of the groin [...] No longer a girl, freed from slavery, now fully a woman, she makes a pretty convincing mistress.&quot;

David Browne of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; called &quot;Brave New Girl&quot; and &quot;Touch of My Hand&quot; the best and most straightforward moments of &quot;In the Zone&quot;, but added that &quot;On a CD intended to celebrate her lurch into adulthood, Spears remains distant and submerged. For all her freedom, she&#x27;s still finding her way.&quot; Jon Pareles of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; said: &quot;[Spears&#x27;] voice is so processed, its physicality almost disappears. [...] &quot;In the Zone&quot; offers strip-club, 1-900 sex, accommodating and hollow. Beyond the glittering beats, Spears sounds about as intimate as a blowup doll.&quot; Sal Cinquemani of &quot;Slant Magazine&quot; stated: &quot;Britney&#x27;s fourth album, &quot;In The Zone&quot;, finds the pop tart coming of age with a bold mix of hip-hop and dance music, wiping clean the last traces of her bubblegum-pop past. [...] For the most part, &quot;In The Zone&quot; is a big, fat, thumping love letter to the dancefloor, which makes Madonna&#x27;s involvement [...] even more appropriate.&quot; Dorian Lynskey of &quot;The Guardian&quot; commented: &quot;Unlike previous Britney albums, &quot;In the Zone&quot; has no filler and no shoddy cover versions, just 57 varieties of blue-chip hit-factory pop. There is southern hip-hop, deep house, Neptunes-style R&amp;B, the ubiquitous Diwali beat and, most importantly, oodles of Madonna.&quot; Jason King of &quot;Vibe&quot; deemed it as &quot;A supremely confident dance record that also illustrates Spears&#x27;s development as a songwriter.&quot;

== Legacy ==
&quot;In the Zone&quot; has been declared a metamorphosis for Spears by numerous critics. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic commented: &quot;If 2001&#x27;s &quot;Britney&quot; was a transitional album, capturing Spears at the point when she wasn&#x27;t a girl and not yet a woman, its 2003 follow-up, &quot;In the Zone&quot;, is where she has finally completed that journey and turned into Britney, the Adult Woman.&quot; Erlewine compared Spears to her peer Christina Aguilera, explaining that both equated maturity with transparent sexuality and the pounding sounds of nightclubs, but while Aguilera &quot;comes across like a natural-born skank, Britney is the girl next door cutting loose at college, drinking and smoking and dancing and sexing just a little too recklessly, since this is the first time she &quot;can&quot; indulge herself.&quot; Sal Cinquemani of &quot;Slant Magazine&quot; stated: &quot;For a girl who&#x27;s always seemed too sexed-up for her age, &quot;In the Zone&quot; finds Britney finally filling her britches, so-to-speak. Her little girl coquettishness actually works now—maybe because, at 21, she&#x27;s finally a woman.&quot; Jason King of &quot;Vibe&quot; said the album showcased a transformed Spears, &quot;no longer a girl, and all the woman any man can handle.&quot;

Following the abrupt conclusion of the Onyx Hotel Tour due to her knee injury, Spears embarked on a prolonged hiatus from performing, and would not release another studio album until &quot;Blackout&quot; in October 2007. She began a relationship with Kevin Federline, whom she met while on tour in April 2004 and married on September 18. Her first greatest hits album &quot;Greatest Hits: My Prerogative&quot; was released in November, debuting at number four on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. Spears was unable to promote it, though the album produced two international hit singles–&quot;My Prerogative&quot; and &quot;Do Somethin&#x27;&quot;. In September 2005, Spears gave birth to her first son Sean Preston, giving birth to her second son Jayden James a year later. In November 2006, filed for divorce from Federline, citing irreconcilable differences; the divorce was finalized in July 2007. Within that period, Spears was involved in a series of media scandals and suffered from a mental breakdown, most notably shaving her head in February 2007.

Several critics have credited &quot;In the Zone&quot; for influencing pop music of the 2000s. In 2009, Amy Schriefer of NPR listed the album among the &quot;50 Most Important Recordings of the Decade&quot;. Calling it &quot;a primer on the sound of pop in the &#x27;00s&quot;, she deemed Spears as the ideal vehicle for a futuristic sound, since she was still trying to break away from her teen pop past. Schriefer praised &quot;Toxic&quot; and &quot;Everytime&quot;, and added: &quot;While the decade&#x27;s history of celebrity obsession, paparazzi voyeurism and conflicted constructions of female sexuality and motherhood are written on Spears&#x27; body, the decade&#x27;s history of impeccably crafted pop is written on her body of work.&quot; Celebrating the album&#x27;s 15th anniversary in 2018, Jason Lipshutz of &quot;Billboard&quot; claimed it &quot;signaled a more mature direction for Spears as she explored electronic music and hip-hop like never before. And the record&#x27;s lyrics — which referenced her breakup with Justin Timberlake and pushed back at her critics in the media — celebrated new levels of independence and candor for the singer.&quot;

Los Angeles pop-up museum The Zone, celebrating Spears&#x27; &quot;iconic songs, videos, and outfits through Instagram-worthy photo ops, interactive displays and personalized content activated by special RFID wristbands&quot;, was titled after the album and opened in January 2020.

<text>Elle Fictions (stylized ELLE Fictions) is a Canadian French language specialty channel owned by Remstar Media Group. The channel broadcasts general entertainment programming targeting young adult women.

This channel was founded as a music television channel named MusiquePlus in 1986 as a joint venture between CHUM Limited—owner of its English-language sister MuchMusic, and Montreal-based radio broadcaster Radiomutuel. Following the acquisition of CHUM by CTVglobemedia, Radiomutuel&#x27;s successor Astral Media acquired CHUM&#x27;s stake in MusiquePlus, marking its separation from common ownership with its English counterpart. After the 2013 acquisition of Astral by CTVglobemedia&#x27;s successor Bell Media, MusiquePlus was sold to V Media Group, parent company of Quebec&#x27;s V network. 

As with its English counterpart, MusiquePlus was formerly oriented primarily towards music programming. Due to shrinking interest in music television because of the growth of online platforms, MusiquePlus increasingly focused on non-music programming targeting a young adult audience, such as comedy, films, and reality shows. After the CRTC abolished genre protection rules in 2015, V Media Group announced in February 2019 that it planned to relaunch MusiquePlus as a general entertainment channel targeting women. This channel was officially relaunched, licensed from the French women&#x27;s magazine &quot;Elle,&quot; on August 26, 2019 while MuchMusic was renamed to Much in 2013 and adopted its current format, eventually removing music programming completely in 2020, and changing its demographic to men.

As a former Category A service, Elle Fictions was required to be carried on the basic service of all digital television providers serving the province of Quebec. The channel is typically offered optionally at the discretion of providers outside of the province.

==History==
=== MusiquePlus ===
Launching on September 2, 1986, MusiquePlus originated with an eight-hour schedule, sharing channel space with TVJQ (a predecessor of VRAK.TV); it consisted of music videos and interviews and performances that were taped from a studio on Boulevard St. Laurent in Montreal. Four hours of this programming was produced from MuchMusic&#x27;s studios in Toronto and sent to Vidéotron for broadcast in Quebec to subscribers of MuchMusic. This programming is repeated once daily.

CHUM later applied to the CRTC in 1987 for a licence to operate MusiquePlus as a dedicated 24-hour channel. The CRTC approved its application, and MusiquePlus was launched as a separate channel on September 1, 1988. The channel was a joint venture between CHUM Limited and Radiomutueleach owning 50%. Radiomutuel was acquired by Astral Media in June 1999.

In July 2006, CTVglobemedia announced it would make a bid to buy CHUM Limited. Initial plans were to keep MusiquePlus and MusiMax, although CTVglobemedia soon announced that it would sell its stake in MusiquePlus and Musimax. On April 11, 2007, Astral announced that it would acquire the remaining 50% of MusiMax and MusiquePlus from CTVglobemedia, giving it full ownership—separating the network from its original parent. This deal was completed on June 30, 2007—to signify its independence from MuchMusic, MusiquePlus adopted a new logo the following year in September 2008.

On August 23, 2010, Astral launched a high definition feed of MusiquePlus.

==== Sale to Remstar/V Media Group ====

While MusiquePlus has operated separately from MuchMusic ever since the deal, the network was almost re-united with its former parent in 2012 when CTVglobemedia&#x27;s successor Bell Media attempted to acquire the entirety of Astral Media for an estimated $3.38 billion. However, the proposed deal was rejected by the CRTC. On March 4, 2013, following consultation with the Competition Bureau, Bell announced that it would go through with the purchase, but divest MusiquePlus, Musimax, and four other Astral-owned channels.

On December 4, 2013, Remstar, owners of the French television system V, announced that it would acquire MusiquePlus and MusiMax for an undisclosed amount. On September 11, 2014, the CRTC approved the sale. The acquisition is valued at $15.5 million; to fund the purchase, Remstar sold 15% stakes in the holding company V Media Group to the Caisse, Fonds de solidarité FTQ and Investissement Québec, and sold $1.5 million in advertising time across MusiquePlus and MusiMax to Bell. Remstar also successfully applied to have the amount of music-oriented programming the channel must air reduced to 80%. The sale was closed on September 16, 2014.

=== Elle Fictions ===
In February 2019, V Media Group announced that MusiquePlus would be replaced later in the year by a network featuring scripted programming catered towards a female audience. The company cited the successful relaunch of sister channel MusiMax as the general entertainment channel Max as a factor in the decision.

In May 2019, it was announced that the channel would launch on August 26 as Elle Fictions and that it would feature series and films targeting &quot;active&quot; young adult women. The branding is licensed from the French magazine &quot;Elle&quot;: the French Canadian version of the magazine had previously been published by Remstar rival Groupe TVA, but it had been announced that the rights were being acquired by KO Media—owned by local personality Louis Morissette.

In October 2024, Canada Post announced commemorative postage stamps honouring MuchMusic and MusiquePlus, depicting their respective headquarters.

<text>In telecommunications, point-to-multipoint communication (P2MP, PTMP or PMP) is communication which is accomplished via a distinct type of one-to-many connection, providing multiple paths from a single location to multiple locations.

Point-to-multipoint telecommunications is typically used in wireless Internet and IP telephony via gigahertz radio frequencies. P2MP systems have been designed with and without a return channel from the multiple receivers. A central antenna or antenna array broadcasts to several receiving antennas and the system uses a form of time-division multiplexing to allow for the return channel traffic.

== Modern point-to-multipoint links ==

In contemporary usage, the term point-to-multipoint wireless communications relates to fixed wireless data communications for Internet or voice over IP via radio or microwave frequencies in the gigahertz range.

Point-to-multipoint is the most popular approach for wireless communications that have a large number of nodes, end destinations or end users. Point to Multipoint generally assumes there is a central base station to which remote &quot;subscriber units&quot; or customer premises equipment (CPE) (a term that was originally used in the wired telephone industry) are connected over the wireless medium. Connections between the &quot;base station&quot; and &quot;subscriber units&quot; can be either line-of-sight or, for lower-frequency radio systems, non-line-of-sight where link budgets permit. Generally, lower frequencies can offer non-line-of-sight connections. Various software planning tools can be used to determine feasibility of potential connections using topographic data as well as link budget simulation. Often the point to multipoint links are installed to reduce the cost of infrastructure and increase the number of CPE&#x27;s and connectivity.

Point-to-multipoint wireless networks employing directional antennas are affected by the hidden node problem (also called hidden terminal) in case they employ a CSMA/CA medium access control protocol. The negative impact of the hidden node problem can be mitigated using a time-division multiple access (TDMA) based protocol or a polling protocol rather than the CSMA/CA protocol.

The telecommunications signal in a point-to-multipoint system is typically bi-directional, TDMA or channelized. Systems using frequency-division duplexing (FDD) offer full-duplex connections between base station and remote sites, and time-division duplex (TDD) systems offer half-duplex connections.

Point-to-multipoint systems can be implemented in licensed, semi-licensed or unlicensed frequency bands depending on the specific application. point-to-point and point-to-multipoint links are very popular in the wireless industry and when paired with other high-capacity wireless links or technologies such as free space optics (FSO) can be referred to as backhaul.

The base station may have a single omnidirectional antenna or multiple sector antennas, the latter of which allowing greater range and capacity.

<doc id="365938" wikidata="Q1139164" url="?curid=365938" title="Germline">
<text>In biology and genetics, the germline is the population of a multicellular organism&#x27;s cells that develop into germ cells. In other words, they are the cells that form gametes (eggs and sperm), which can come together to form a zygote. They differentiate in the gonads from primordial germ cells into gametogonia, which develop into gametocytes, which develop into the final gametes. This process is known as gametogenesis.

Germ cells pass on genetic material through the process of sexual reproduction. This includes fertilization, recombination and meiosis. These processes help to increase genetic diversity in offspring.

Certain organisms reproduce asexually via processes such as apomixis, parthenogenesis, autogamy, and cloning. Apomixis and Parthenogenesis both refer to the development of an embryo without fertilization. The former typically occurs in plants seeds, while the latter tends to be seen in nematodes, as well as certain species of reptiles, birds, and fish. Autogamy is a term used to describe self pollination in plants. Cloning is a technique used to creation of genetically identical cells or organisms.

In sexually reproducing organisms, cells that are not in the germline are called somatic cells. According to this definition, mutations, recombinations and other genetic changes in the germline may be passed to offspring, but changes in a somatic cell will not be. This need not apply to somatically reproducing organisms, such as some Porifera and many plants. For example, many varieties of citrus, plants in the Rosaceae and some in the Asteraceae, such as &quot;Taraxacum&quot;, produce seeds apomictically when somatic diploid cells displace the ovule or early embryo.

In an earlier stage of genetic thinking, there was a clear distinction between germline and somatic cells. For example, August Weismann proposed and pointed out, a germline cell is immortal in the sense that it is part of a lineage that has reproduced indefinitely since the beginning of life and, barring accident, could continue doing so indefinitely. However, it is now known in some detail that this distinction between somatic and germ cells is partly artificial and depends on particular circumstances and internal cellular mechanisms such as telomeres and controls such as the selective application of telomerase in germ cells, stem cells and the like.

Not all multicellular organisms differentiate into somatic and germ lines, but in the absence of specialised technical human intervention practically all but the simplest multicellular structures do so. In such organisms somatic cells tend to be practically totipotent, and for over a century sponge cells have been known to reassemble into new sponges after having been separated by forcing them through a sieve.

&quot;Germline&quot; can refer to a lineage of cells spanning many generations of individuals—for example, the germline that links any living individual to the hypothetical last universal common ancestor, from which all plants and animals descend.

== Evolution ==
Plants and basal metazoans such as sponges (Porifera) and corals (Anthozoa) do not sequester a distinct germline, generating gametes from multipotent stem cell lineages that also give rise to ordinary somatic tissues. It is therefore likely that germline sequestration first evolved in complex animals with sophisticated body plans, i.e. bilaterians. There are several theories on the origin of the strict germline-soma distinction. Setting aside an isolated germ cell population early in embryogenesis might promote cooperation between the somatic cells of a complex multicellular organism. Another recent theory suggests that early germline sequestration evolved to limit the accumulation of deleterious mutations in mitochondrial genes in complex organisms with high energy requirements and fast mitochondrial mutation rates.

==DNA damage, mutation and repair==

Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are produced as byproducts of metabolism. In germline cells, ROS are likely a significant cause of DNA damages that, upon DNA replication, lead to mutations. 8-Oxoguanine, an oxidized derivative of guanine, is produced by spontaneous oxidation in the germline cells of mice, and during the cell&#x27;s DNA replication cause GC to TA transversion mutations. Such mutations occur throughout the mouse chromosomes as well as during different stages of gametogenesis.

The mutation frequencies for cells in different stages of gametogenesis are about 5 to 10-fold lower than in somatic cells both for spermatogenesis and oogenesis. The lower frequencies of mutation in germline cells compared to somatic cells appears to be due to more efficient DNA repair of DNA damages, particularly homologous recombinational repair, during germline meiosis. Among humans, about five percent of live-born offspring have a genetic disorder, and of these, about 20% are due to newly arisen germline mutations.

==Epigenetic alterations==
Epigenetic alterations of DNA include modifications that affect gene expression, but are not caused by changes in the sequence of bases in DNA. A well-studied example of such an alteration is the methylation of DNA cytosine to form 5-methylcytosine. This usually occurs in the DNA sequence CpG, changing the DNA at the CpG site from CpG to 5-mCpG. Methylation of cytosines in CpG sites in promoter regions of genes can reduce or silence gene expression. About 28 million CpG dinucleotides occur in the human genome, and about 24 million CpG sites in the mouse genome (which is 86% as large as the human genome). In most tissues of mammals, on average, 70% to 80% of CpG cytosines are methylated (forming 5-mCpG).

In the mouse, by days 6.25 to 7.25 after fertilization of an egg by a sperm, cells in the embryo are set aside as primordial germ cells (PGCs). These PGCs will later give rise to germline sperm cells or egg cells. At this point the PGCs have high typical levels of methylation. Then primordial germ cells of the mouse undergo genome-wide DNA demethylation, followed by subsequent new methylation to reset the epigenome in order to form an egg or sperm.

In the mouse, PGCs undergo DNA demethylation in two phases. The first phase, starting at about embryonic day 8.5, occurs during PGC proliferation and migration, and it results in genome-wide loss of methylation, involving almost all genomic sequences. This loss of methylation occurs through passive demethylation due to repression of the major components of the methylation machinery. The second phase occurs during embryonic days 9.5 to 13.5 and causes demethylation of most remaining specific loci, including germline-specific and meiosis-specific genes. This second phase of demethylation is mediated by the TET enzymes TET1 and TET2, which carry out the first step in demethylation by converting 5-mC to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5-hmC) during embryonic days 9.5 to 10.5. This is likely followed by replication-dependent dilution during embryonic days 11.5 to 13.5. At embryonic day 13.5, PGC genomes display the lowest level of global DNA methylation of all cells in the life cycle.

In the mouse, the great majority of differentially expressed genes in PGCs from embryonic day 9.5 to 13.5, when most genes are demethylated, are upregulated in both male and female PGCs.

Following erasure of DNA methylation marks in mouse PGCs, male and female germ cells undergo new methylation at different time points during gametogenesis. While undergoing mitotic expansion in the developing gonad, the male germline starts the re-methylation process by embryonic day 14.5. The sperm-specific methylation pattern is maintained during mitotic expansion. DNA methylation levels in primary oocytes before birth remain low, and re-methylation occurs after birth in the oocyte growth phase.

<text>Dame Sian Seerpoohi Elias (born 13 March 1949) was the 12th chief justice of New Zealand, and was therefore the most senior member of the country&#x27;s judiciary. She was the presiding judge of the Supreme Court of New Zealand and on several occasions acted as administrator of the Government.

==Early life and family==
Born in London of an Armenian father and a Welsh mother (hence her Welsh forename and Armenian surname), Elias arrived in New Zealand in 1952, and later attended Diocesan School for Girls in Auckland. She completed a law degree from the University of Auckland in 1970, and then undertook further study at Stanford University. She took up employment with an Auckland law firm in 1972, beginning her career as a barrister three years later. She also served as a member of the Motor Spirits Licensing Appeal Authority and of the Working Party on the Environment.

Elias is married to Hugh Fletcher, former CEO of Fletcher Challenge and a former Chancellor of the University of Auckland.

==Early judicial career==

Elias served as a Law Commissioner from 1984 to 1988. She is also known for her work in relation to various Treaty-related cases. In 1990, she was awarded a New Zealand 1990 Commemoration Medal in recognition of her services. In 1988 she and Lowell Goddard were made the first women Queen&#x27;s Counsel in New Zealand. Elias became a judge of the High Court in 1995, and occasionally sat on the Court of Appeal.

== Chief Justice ==

On 17 May 1999, Elias was sworn in as Chief Justice of New Zealand, the first woman to hold that position in New Zealand. In the 1999 Queen&#x27;s Birthday Honours, she was appointed a Dame Grand Companion of the New Zealand Order of Merit.

=== Service as Administrator of the Government ===
One aspect of the role of chief justice that of administrator of the Government when the governor-general is unable to fulfil their duties (due to a vacancy in the position, illness, absence from New Zealand or some other cause). Elias most prominently held the role of administrator of the Government from 22 March 2001 until 4 April 2001, between the terms of Sir Michael Hardie Boys and Dame Silvia Cartwright, from 4 August 2006 until 23 August 2006 between Cartwright&#x27;s term and that of Sir Anand Satyanand, from 23 August 2011 until 31 August 2011 between the terms of Satyanand and Sir Jerry Mateparae, from 31 August 2016 until 28 September 2016 between the terms of Mateparae and Dame Patsy Reddy, and at other times when the governor-general has been unable to act.

=== Support for Māori Treaty claims ===
In 1984, Elias helped Ngāneko Minhinnick&#x27;s Manukau Harbour claim to the Waitangi Tribunal. This led to work on other treaty cases, including as counsel in &quot;New Zealand Maori Council v Attorney-General&quot;, and in a claim to prevent the Government selling radio frequencies, and the case challenging the 1994 Māori electoral option. In June 2003 she was involved in a landmark case which allowed for the possibility that the Māori Land Court could issue freehold title over the foreshore and seabed. The subsequent legal uncertainties and upheavals in Māoridom dominated the political agenda for the next 18 months.

=== The Blameless Babes speech ===
In July 2009, Elias caused controversy with her remarks in the annual Shirley Smith address, organised by the Wellington Branch of the New Zealand Law Society&#x27;s Women-in-Law committee. The annual lecture is given in honour of noted criminal defence lawyer, Shirley Smith. The speech was entitled &quot;Blameless Babes&quot; after a quote from Smith, who wrote &quot;[providing] a prison at the bottom of the cliff is not a solution. Criminals will just go on falling into it, at great cost to the community. We have to find out why blameless babes become criminals.&quot;

In her speech, Elias expressed concern about prison overcrowding and argued against what she described as the &quot;punitive and knee-jerk&quot; attitude of politicians towards the criminal justice system.

As a final point, Elias said that unless New Zealand takes action to address the underlying causes of crime, Government may be forced into the position of using executive amnesties to reduce the growing number of prisoners. The Chief Justice&#x27;s comments were widely reported in the media. Simon Power, the Minister of Justice, said in response: &quot;The Chief Justice&#x27;s speech does not represent Government policy in any way, shape or form&quot;.

<text>Limpopo () is the northernmost province of South Africa. It is named after the Limpopo River, which forms the province&#x27;s western and northern borders. The term Limpopo is derived from Rivombo (Livombo/Lebombo), a group of Tsonga settlers led by Hosi Rivombo who settled in the mountainous vicinity and named the area after their leader. The Lebombo mountains are also named after them. The river has been called the Vhembe by local Venda communities of the area. The capital and largest city in the province is Polokwane, while the provincial legislature is situated in Lebowakgomo.

The province is made up of three former homelands of Lebowa, Gazankulu and Venda and part of the former Transvaal province. The Limpopo province was established as one of nine provinces after the 1994 South African general election. The province&#x27;s name was first &quot;Northern Transvaal&quot;, later changed to &quot;Northern Province&quot; on 28 June 1995, with two other provinces. The name was later changed again in 2002 to the Limpopo Province. Limpopo is made up of three main ethnic groups: the Pedi, the Tsonga and the Venda.

Traditional leaders and chiefs still form a strong backbone of the province&#x27;s political landscape. Established in terms of the Limpopo House of Traditional Leaders Act, Act 5 of 2005, the Limpopo House of Traditional Leaders&#x27; main function is to advise the government and the legislature on matters related to custom, tradition, and culture, including developmental initiatives that affect rural communities. On 18 August 2017, Kgosi Malesela Dikgale was re-elected as the Chairperson of the Limpopo House of Traditional Leaders.

==History==
The world heritage site of the Mapungubwe National Park boasts archaeological finds from the period of a powerful local kingdom that ruled here between 800 CE and 1290 existed. The remains of a settlement from the period between the 15th and 17th century can be seen in Thulamela in the northern part of the Kruger National Park.

Until 1994 it was the northern part of the former Transvaal Province. For a short period since 1994 it was called the Province of Northern Transvaal and thereafter, through the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa Amendment Act No. 20 of 1995 from July 1995 initially &quot;Northern Province&quot;. The province was named after the Limpopo River by decision of the provincial assembly in 2002, and at the same time most of the cities on its territory were renamed. However, the renaming of the province required an amendment to the South African constitution, which was passed with an amending law was made in 2003.

In 2013, Stan Mathabatha replaced his predecessor Cassel Mathale (both ANC) as Prime Minister.

==Geography==

Limpopo Province shares international borders with districts and provinces of three countries: Botswana&#x27;s Central and Kgatleng districts to the west and northwest respectively, Zimbabwe&#x27;s Matabeleland South and Masvingo provinces to the north and northeast respectively, and Mozambique&#x27;s Gaza Province to the east. Limpopo is the link between South Africa and countries further afield in sub-Saharan Africa. On its southern edge, from east to west, it shares borders with the South African provinces of Mpumalanga, Gauteng, and North West. Its border with Gauteng includes that province&#x27;s Johannesburg-Pretoria axis, the most industrialised metropolis on the continent. The province is central to regional, national, and international developing markets.

Limpopo contains much of the Waterberg Biosphere, a massif of approximately which is the first region in the northern part of South Africa to be named a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve.

==Law and government==

The current Premier of Limpopo Province is Phophi Ramathuba, representing the African National Congress.

==Economy==

Limpopo has a total population of 6.015 million with 1.641 million households. The province has a relatively high Human Development Index (HDI) of 0.710, which is the third highest in South Africa.

===Agriculture===
The bushveld is beef cattle country, where extensive ranching operations are often supplemented by controlled hunting. About 80% of South Africa&#x27;s game hunting industry is in Limpopo.
Sunflowers, cotton, maize and peanuts are cultivated in the Bela-Bela and Modimolle areas. Modimolle is also known for its table grapes. An embryotic wine industry is growing in Limpopo. Tropical fruit, such as bananas, litchis, pineapples, mangoes and pawpaws, as well as a variety of nuts, are grown in the Tzaneen and Louis Trichardt areas. Tzaneen is also at the centre of extensive citrus, tea, and coffee plantations and a major forestry industry. Most of the farmers and households lack a water supply which makes them drill boreholes on their premises.

===Housing===
Most Limpopo residents live in rural areas; this has led to a new phenomenon of rural development, where the residents have invested in building lavish homes on their tribal land. Limpopo rural houses have been profiled by TV channels, lifestyle vloggers, social media influencers, and Africa&#x27;s biggest facts brand, Africa Facts Zone. According to 96.2% of Limpopo live in formal housing, above the national average of 84.0%. This makes Limpopo the province with the highest percentage of people living in formal housing in South Africa.

===Mining===

Limpopo&#x27;s rich mineral deposits include the platinum group metals, iron ore, chromium, high- and middle-grade coking coal, diamonds, antimony, phosphate, and copper, as well as mineral reserves like gold, emeralds, scheelite, magnetite, vermiculite, silicon, and mica. Commodities such as black granite, corundum, and feldspar are also found. Mining contributes to over a fifth of the provincial economy.

Limpopo has the largest platinum deposit in South Africa. The Waterberg Coalfield, the eastern extension of Botswana&#x27;s Mmamabula coalfields, is estimated to contain 40% of South Africa&#x27;s coal reserves.

===Tourism===
The Limpopo Department of Economic Development, Environment and Tourism has targeted the province as a preferred eco-tourism destination. Its Environment and Tourism Programme encompasses tourism, protected areas, and community environment development to achieve sustainable economic growth.

While Limpopo is one of South Africa&#x27;s poorest provinces, it is rich in wildlife, which gives it an advantage in attracting tourists. Both the private and public sectors are investing in tourism development.

Near Modjadjiskloof, at Sunland Baobab farms, there is a large Baobab tree which has been fashioned into a relatively spacious pub.

==Transportation and communications==
The province has excellent road, rail, and air links. The N1 route from Johannesburg, which extends the length of the province, is the busiest overland route in Africa in terms of cross-border trade in raw materials and beneficiated goods. The port of Durban, South Africa&#x27;s busiest, is served directly by the province, as are the ports of Richards Bay and Maputo. Polokwane International Airport is situated just north of Polokwane. Limpopo province contains approximately 56 airports and airstrips.

==Education==
The Department of Education is responsible for effecting quality education and training for all. The Department has to coordinate all professional development and support. Policies, systems, and procedures had to be developed.

===Educational institutions===
As of December 2020, 12.9% of the Limpopo population had attained some post-school qualifications. The following higher education institutions are found in Limpopo: 
*University of Limpopo (Polokwane, Mankweng)
*University of Venda (Thohoyandou)
*Tshwane University of Technology (Polokwane Campus)
* Capricorn College for TVET (Polokwane)

* Mopani South East TVET College (Phalaborwa)
* Sekhukhune TVET College (Motetema)
*Vhembe TVET College (Venda)
* Waterberg TVET College (Mokopane)

==Sports==
*Association football: Polokwane was one of South Africa&#x27;s host cities for the 2010 FIFA World Cup, with matches being played at the Peter Mokaba Stadium. Football clubs in the province include Real Rovers, Silver Stars, Black Leopards, Polokwane City, Magesi, Baroka, Ria Stars and Dynamos.
*Rugby union: Limpopo has no provincial rugby team of its own; it is represented in the domestic Currie Cup by the Pretoria-based Blue Bulls. The Blue Bulls also operate a Super Rugby franchise, the Bulls. Limpopo nonetheless produces its share of top players. Most notably, the second most-capped forward in the history of the country&#x27;s national team, Victor Matfield, is a native of Polokwane.
*Basketball: The province is home to Limpopo Pride, a professional team that plays in South Africa&#x27;s top basketball division, the Basketball National League.

==Demographics==
The population of Limpopo consists of several ethnic groups distinguished by culture, language, and race. 97.3% of the population is Black, 2.4% is White, 0.2% is Coloured, and 0.1% is Indian/Asian. The province has the smallest percentage and second smallest total number of White South Africans in the country. However, there are several localities with a White majority, notably Hoedspruit and Modimolle. It also has the highest Black percentage out of all the provinces.

The Northern Sotho people comprise the largest percentage of the population, 52% of the province. The Tsonga people comprise about 24.0% of the province; the Tsonga also comprise about 11.5% of Mpumalanga province since the southern part of their homeland, Gazankulu, was cut off from Limpopo and allocated to Mpumalanga. The Venda make up about 16.7%. Afrikaners make up the majority of Limpopo&#x27;s White population, about 95,000 people; English-speaking Whites number just over 20,000. Vhembe district has the smallest share of White people in Limpopo, about 5,000 total. In contrast, the Waterberg district has the largest share of Whites, with more than 60,000 Whites residing there. Coloureds and Asians/Indians make up a tiny percentage of the province&#x27;s total population.

===HIV / AIDS===

At 18.5% (2007), Limpopo has a relatively high incidence of HIV compared to other South African provinces. Cases rose from 14.5% to 21.5% between 2001 and 2005, with a slight fall between 2005 and 2007. However, as at 2019, the Limpopo province HIV stats sat at (13.2%) which is one of the lowest in comparison with other provinces in South Africa.

<text>299 Queen Street West, also known as Bell Media Queen Street or Bell Media Studios, is the headquarters of the television/radio broadcast hub of Bell Canada&#x27;s media unit, Bell Media, and is located at the intersection of Queen Street West and John Street in Downtown Toronto, Ontario, Canada. The building previously served as the headquarters of CTVglobemedia until Bell Canada acquired CTV again in 2011 as well as CHUM Television, a division of CHUM Limited, until CTV acquired CHUM in 2007, and was once known as the CHUM-City Building. It is now head offices and downtown Toronto studios for Bell Media.

With its 1913 neo-Gothic terra cotta façade, the building is designated as a heritage property by the City of Toronto&#x27;s Heritage Preservation Services under the Ontario Heritage Act and has served as a broadcast facility since 1987.

== Overview ==
The building serves as the official headquarters of Bell Canada&#x27;s media unit, Bell Media, as well as the home of various Bell Media television properties, most of which were originally owned by CHUM, although some properties that CTV already owned prior to 2007 have moved some or all of their operations here since then as well. Current occupants include CTV Drama Channel, BNN Bloomberg, CTV Comedy Channel, E!, Oxygen True Crime, CTV Life Channel, Much (formerly MuchMusic) and CTV Sci-Fi Channel. Selected CTV programs, including &quot;etalk&quot; and &quot;The Social&quot; are produced at the building and selected network offices are located in this facility.

Aside from the CTV network programming, Toronto station CFTO-TV has relatively little presence at the Queen Street facility. The primary studios for CTV Toronto, and the CTV network&#x27;s national operations are located at 9 Channel Nine Court at Highway 401 and McCowan Road in Scarborough, where many of Bell Media&#x27;s other co-owned channels such as CP24, CTV News Channel, USA Network, TSN, as well as the master controls for the CTV stations in Eastern Canada, are located (see below).

== History and architecture ==

The site where 299 Queen resides was once occupied by Beverley House, built on what was Lot 16 in 1812 for D’Arcy (Edward) Boulton Jr.(1785-1846), son of G. D&#x27;Arcy Boulton and named for brother in law Sir John Beverley Robinson, who served as Chief Justice of Upper Canada. The home was modified from the smaller original Boulton home to a larger home. While it served briefly as home to Charles Poulett Thomson, 1st Baron Sydenham as Governor General of the Province of Canada but remained owned Robinson family until 1910 when Elizabeth Street Robinson (widow of Christopher Robinson and son of Boulton Jr.) sold and was demolished after 1911.

The current five-storey building was originally constructed as the headquarters of the Methodist Church of Canada in 1913 by Burke, Horwood and White. The Methodists joined with two other denominations to form the United Church of Canada in 1925, for which the building served as the headquarters until 1959. By this time the Ryerson Press, originally the publishing arm of the Methodist Church, had grown to occupy the entire building.

===CHUM Limited &amp; CTVglobemedia===
In 1979, family owned CHUM Limited (then solely a radio network) purchased the rest of Citytv to which it did not yet own, which prompted the building purchase by CHUM in 1985. Toronto architecture firm Quadrangle was hired to restore and renovate the building into an innovative broadcast hub. After two years of outfitting for it broadcast operations, it was re-opened in May 1987 as the new television headquarters for the company and its various outlets, including Citytv Toronto (which was previously located at 99 Queen St. East). CHUM Limited&#x27;s overall corporate headquarters and its Toronto radio stations continued to be based at 1331 Yonge Street.

The building&#x27;s east wall was decorated with an actual older style news truck seemingly bursting out of the building; the front tires of the truck can still be seen spinning regularly. From the time the truck was erected there, it originally bore the old &quot;CityPulse Live-Eye&quot; decal; which has been replaced and overhauled with the &quot;CP24 Breaking News&quot; decal following the acquisition by CTVglobemedia.

Previously, the northwest corner of the building used to contain a &quot;Speakers&#x27; Corner&quot; videobooth, where for a dollar anyone could record two minutes of oneself. The booth was removed as part of renovations and upgrades to the MuchMusic studios in 2010, and the space where the video booth was located has since been enclosed and is used as production space for &quot;The Social&quot;.

While the outside facade has been restored and remains intact, the building&#x27;s interior has been modernized into one of the world&#x27;s most innovative media complexes. 299 Queen Street West was designed to have no TV studios; the entire building was rigged for audio and video. The building has been engineered so that public space, working areas, offices, stairwells, and even the parking lot may all be used as optimal shoot locations. Many television shows produced by the various outlets operating out of the building over the years, such as Citytv&#x27;s &quot;Breakfast Television&quot;, &quot;CityLine&quot; and the former &quot;Electric Circus&quot;, were filmed live on the ground floor. The ground floor at the corner of Queen and John features giant glass sliding partitions so that the building can be open to the street. The studios formerly used for MuchMusic are now used for &quot;The Social&quot;, and the studio used for &quot;CityLine&quot; and &quot;Breakfast Television&quot; on Citytv, then briefly for &quot;eTalk&quot; on CTV, is now used for &quot;The Marilyn Denis Show&quot;.

The annual MuchMusic Video Awards show is/was held as a street party that takes place in the parking lot, studios, rooftop, as well as Queen and John Streets adjacent to the building. Queen and John is subsequently shut down from the early-afternoon into the evening on the day the show is/was scheduled to take place.

299 Queen Street West served as the national broadcast headquarters for the 2007 Live Earth concert, with several CTVgm-owned media outlets and personalities collaborating to broadcast the live event nationally for 28 hours. The building also served as the headquarters for CTV&#x27;s multi-platform coverage of the 32nd Toronto International Film Festival in September 2007, acting as the launching pad of red carpet coverage, galas, film parties, film premieres, festival breaking news, and other related events. Various corporate divisions, such as eTalk, Star!, MuchMusic, MTV Canada, Bravo!, FashionTelevisionChannel and &quot;Canada AM&quot;, collaborated on the event coverage.

===Bell Media era===
Although acquired by Bell Media together with other CHUM entities, the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission required CTVgm to sell Citytv Toronto and four other Citytv stations in Canada to Rogers Media in 2007. Since then, the Citytv signage at the front building was replaced with an &quot;eTalk&quot; logo (since removed); the Citytv logos on the landmark mural behind the former Virgin Mobile previously known as the Much store and the CHUM-City Store prior to that were replaced and overhauled with various logos of Bell Media&#x27;s co-owned television channels, as well as the logo for CTV&#x27;s entertainment news program &quot;eTalk&quot; shown one dish (since removed); and the main Citytv signage on the building&#x27;s east façade was replaced with a CTV logo and a private balcony, looking out from the company&#x27;s boardroom. The Bravo sign above the CP24 studios was replaced with a Bell Media sign after the acquisition by Bell Canada. Citytv Toronto officially moved out of 299 Queen Street West into its new home at 33 Dundas Street East on September 8, 2009.

It was announced in 2008 that Toronto radio operations including, CHUM (AM) and CHUM-FM, would be relocating to adjacent building 250 Richmond Street West. The iconic &#x27;CHUM Dial 1050 / Radio 1045&#x27; sign was unveiled on June 15, 2009 and they officially moved on August 19, 2009.

===2010–present===
BNN later moved into the building on December 6, 2010, and uses the space previously utilized by Citytv&#x27;s CityNews department, the BNN newsroom is adjacent to that of CP24&#x27;s newsroom.

On July 30, 2013, Bell Media announced that CFRB and CKFM-FM would be moving to the adjacent building 250 Richmond Street West, (part of the Bell Media Queen Street complex) from 2 St. Clair Avenue West. This marked the end of CFRB&#x27;s 49-year tenure at their 2 St. Clair Avenue West studios. The move took place on May 10, 2014.

In 2016, 299 Queen West received a landmark designation from the Ontario Association of Architects.

On June 20, 2024, Bell announced that BNN and CP24 would relocate from 299 Queen Street West to 9 Channel Nine Court in Agincourt, with CP24 moving in November 26, 2024, and BNN moving in the third quarter of 2025.

==Other Bell Media facilities in Toronto==
Alongside 299 Queen Street West, other Bell Media properties are operated from other facilities in the Toronto area:

* In mid-2015 it was announced the Virgin Mobile at much store would become a new street front facility for Much Digital Studios as part of their multi-channel new media network. The facility is part of the Bell Media Queen Street complex but is not directly connected to any other building. It had previously been the expanded ChumCity Store (relocated from within the ground-floor studio at 299, when not in use for shows like &quot;Breakfast Television&quot; or &quot;Electric Circus&quot;), as well as the first location for Moses Znaimer&#x27;s MZTV Museum of Television.
* Studios for Bell Media&#x27;s Toronto-based radio channels including CFRB, CHUM-FM, &amp; CKFM-FM; and Downtown Toronto studios for CHUM (AM), are currently located at 250 Richmond Street West at Richmond and Duncan streets which is adjacent and connected to 299 Queen Street West by bridge to 260 Richmond Street West.
* Several other Bell Media television channels, including CTV&#x27;s flagship station, CFTO-DT; along with CP24, CTV News Channel; TSN, USA Network, CTV Wild Channel, CTV Nature Channel; as well as the master controls for the CTV and CTV 2 stations in Alberta, Southern Ontario, and Eastern and Atlantic Canada (including CHWI-DT Windsor, CFPL-DT London, CKVR-DT Barrie, CHRO-DT Ottawa, CTV 2 Atlantic, CTV 2 Alberta, CKY-DT Winnipeg, CKCO-DT Kitchener, CTV Northern Ontario, CJOH-DT Ottawa and CFCF-DT Montreal); as well as some of the technical operations for TSN Radio 1050 are operated from 9 Channel Nine Court in Agincourt. Additionally, CHUM (AM)&#x27;s studios for television syndication of its radio programs are located inside 9 Channel Nine Court.

<doc id="365964" wikidata="Q187832" url="?curid=365964" title="Mandy Moore">
<text>Amanda Leigh Moore (born April 10, 1984) is an American actress, singer and songwriter. She rose to fame with her 1999 debut single &quot;Candy&quot;, which peaked at number 41 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. Her debut studio album, &quot;So Real&quot; (1999), received platinum certification by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). The title track from her reissue of &quot;So Real&quot;, &quot;I Wanna Be With You&quot; (2000), became Moore&#x27;s first top 40 single, peaking at 24 on the chart. Moore then released the studio albums &quot;Mandy Moore&quot; (2001), &quot;Coverage&quot; (2003), &quot;Wild Hope&quot; (2007), &quot;Amanda Leigh&quot; (2009), &quot;Silver Landings&quot; (2020), and &quot;In Real Life&quot; (2022). She has sold ten million albums worldwide. 

Moore made her feature film debut in 2001 with a minor voice role in &quot;Dr. Dolittle 2&quot;, before playing a supporting role in the comedy &quot;The Princess Diaries&quot;. She received recognition for her starring role in the romantic drama &quot;A Walk to Remember&quot; (2002). Her subsequent film credits include &quot;How to Deal&quot; (2003), &quot;Chasing Liberty&quot; (2004), &quot;Saved!&quot; (2004), &quot;Racing Stripes&quot; (2005), &quot;Because I Said So&quot; (2007), &quot;License to Wed&quot; (2007), &quot;Love, Wedding, Marriage&quot; (2011), &quot;47 Meters Down&quot; (2017), &quot;The Darkest Minds&quot; (2018), and &quot;Midway&quot; (2019). She voiced Rapunzel in the Disney animated musical fantasy film &quot;Tangled&quot; (2010).

From 2016 to 2022, she starred as Rebecca Pearson in the NBC family drama series &quot;This Is Us&quot;, receiving nominations for a Golden Globe Award and a Primetime Emmy Award. In 2019, she received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.

==Early life==
Moore was born on April 10, 1984, in Nashua, New Hampshire, to Stacy (née Friedman), a former news reporter who once worked for the &quot;Orlando Sentinel&quot;, and Donald Moore, a pilot for American Airlines. Moore was raised Catholic, but had stopped practicing religion by 2004 and has since developed a &quot;hodgepodge of things&quot; that she believes. Moore is of English, Scottish, and Irish descent. She has an older brother, Scott, and a younger brother, Kyle. When Moore was two months old, she and her family moved to Longwood, Florida, outside of Orlando, because of her father&#x27;s job. She attended the Park Maitland School, where she discovered her &quot;passion for singing and the stage.&quot; From 1998 to 1999, Moore went to the Bishop Moore Catholic High School in Orlando. Moore is the step-sister of actress Carly Craig. Her brothers and mother are gay, and both parents have entered new relationships after their divorce.

==Career==
===1993–1999: Career beginnings===
Moore became interested in singing and acting at a young age, and called her British maternal grandmother, Eileen Friedman, a professional ballerina in London, one of her inspirations. Moore said &quot;My parents thought it was just a phase I&#x27;d grow out of. But I stuck to it and begged them for acting lessons, for voice lessons.&quot;

Moore began acting in lead roles in a number of local productions and performing the national anthem at a number of events in Orlando. She was twelve years old when she went to the Stagedoor Manor performing arts camp. Production director Konnie Kittrell said about Moore &quot;She was a quiet, sweet girl&quot;, and said that she earned a number of solos, but &quot;She wasn&#x27;t a spotlight seeker.&quot;

When Moore was thirteen she began working on music. One day while working in an Orlando studio, she was overheard by Victor Cade, a delivery man who had a friend in A&amp;R at Epic Records. Cade sent this friend a copy of Moore&#x27;s unfinished demo, and Moore signed on with the label.

===1999–2000: &quot;So Real&quot;, MTV stardom, and &quot;I Wanna Be with You&quot;===
After signing with Epic Records, Moore began working on her debut album. While recording the album, Moore had to leave Bishop Moore Catholic High School when she was in the ninth grade and continued receiving her education from tutors. In the summer of 1999, Moore began touring with the boy band NSYNC. Later that year, Moore toured with the boy band Backstreet Boys.

Moore&#x27;s debut single, &quot;Candy&quot;, was released on August 17, 1999, in the U.S. The single was a commercial success in a number of countries, and has been compared to the singles of fellow teen pop singers Jessica Simpson, Christina Aguilera, and Britney Spears. It debuted at number 88 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, before peaking at number 41 on the chart. The single later received a Gold certification from the RIAA, for sales exceeding 500,000 copies in the U.S. The single was the most successful in Australia, where it peaked at number 2 on the ARIA Charts and received a Platinum certification. Moore began to host and VJ at MTV, contributing to numerous shows including &quot;Total Request Live&quot;, &quot;Say What? Karaoke&quot;, and her own talk show which was originally called &quot;The Mandy Moore Show&quot; before being retitled as &quot;Mandy&quot;.

Moore&#x27;s debut studio album, &quot;So Real&quot;, was released on December 7, 1999, by 550 Music through Epic Records. The album received a limited release in a few countries. It received generally mixed reviews from critics when it was released, and Moore continued to be compared to other teen pop singers. Allmusic said about the album, &quot;Fifteen-year-old Mandy Moore&#x27;s debut album sounded like it was inspired almost entirely by listening to recent hit albums by &#x27;N Sync, the Backstreet Boys, and Britney Spears.&quot; &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; had a similar opinion about the album, and gave it a C− in their review. The album debuted at number 77 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart. It continued to climb the chart until it peaked at number 31. It received a Platinum certification from the RIAA, for sales exceeding one million copies in the U.S. alone. The album&#x27;s second single, &quot;Walk Me Home&quot;, did not have the same success of its predecessor, failing to appear on any major charts.

Before promotion for &quot;So Real&quot; had ended, Moore began working on more music. The single &quot;I Wanna Be with You&quot;, was released on April 3, 2000. &quot;I Wanna Be with You&quot; spent 16 weeks on the chart and reached its peak of 24 during its ninth week on the chart. The song became her first Top 20 hit on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Pop Songs chart, where it peaked at number 11. The single became Moore&#x27;s second Top 20 hit in Australia, where it peaked at number 13. It was a minor success on the German Media Control Charts, where it peaked at number 70. The single received mixed reviews. &quot;Billboard&quot; praised the song and said, &quot;Top 40 programmers and listeners alike will love Moore more with this track&quot;, and Allmusic called the song a highlight track from the album.

A reissue of &quot;So Real&quot;, titled &quot;I Wanna Be with You&quot;, was released on May 9, 2000. Marketed as &quot;a new version of Mandy&#x27;s debut&quot;, the album was a compilation of new songs, remixes, and songs from Moore&#x27;s debut album &quot;So Real&quot;. Internationally, where the &quot;So Real&quot; album was not released, &quot;I Wanna Be with You&quot; served as Moore&#x27;s debut album, with multiple alternative track listings. The album received generally mixed reviews and was criticized for not being a true follow-up. Allmusic called the album &quot;trashier, flashier, gaudier, and altogether more disposable&quot; than its predecessor &quot;So Real&quot;. The album was a commercial success, debuting and peaking at number 21 on the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart. It received a Gold certification from the RIAA, for sales exceeding 500,000 copies in the U.S. alone. Moore won the Kids&#x27; Choice Awards for &quot;Favorite Rising Star&quot; for the album in 2000. &quot;Walk Me Home&quot; was re-released in the United States as the second single from &quot;I Wanna Be with You&quot; and was slightly more successful than its original release, peaking at number 38 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Pop Songs chart. The final single from the album, &quot;So Real&quot; was released in selected territories on June 13, 2000. In Australia, the single became her second Top 40 hit, peaking at number 21 on the ARIA Charts. The single peaked at number 18 on the Official New Zealand Music Chart.

===2001–2002: &quot;Mandy Moore&quot; and early acting roles===
In 2001, Moore began working on her second studio album, which was said to move away from the bubblegum pop sound and image she became known for. Moore said during an interview with &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine that &quot;All of the music has started to look and sound the same&quot; and that she chose to move in a different musical direction. Moore said that she wanted to feature more live instruments when performing, saying she wanted &quot;no more dancers, no more singing to tracks. I got tired of that in a big way&quot;.

The album&#x27;s lead single, &quot;In My Pocket&quot;, was released on May 29, 2001. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; said the single had &quot;pumping, Indian-influenced Eurodisco&quot;. It failed to chart on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 in the U.S., but peaked at number 2 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Bubbling Under Hot 100 Singles chart, and it reached number 21 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Pop Songs chart. The song became her third Top 20 hit in Australia, where it peaked at number 11 on the ARIA Charts.

Moore&#x27;s self-titled second studio album, &quot;Mandy Moore&quot;, was released on June 19, 2001. The album had uptempo dance and pop songs and influences from Middle Eastern music. The album received mixed to average reviews from critics. Allmusic called the album a &quot;lush, layered production&quot;. The album debuted and peaked at number 35 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart, and received a Gold certification from the RIAA. The album has sold an estimated 1.5 million copies worldwide. The album reached number 37 on the ARIA charts in Australia, her highest peak in the country to date. The album&#x27;s second single, &quot;Crush&quot;, was released on August 28, 2001; it peaked at number 35 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Pop Songs chart, and it climbed to number 25 on the ARIA Charts.

Moore made her feature film debut in 2001, where she voiced a Girl Bear Cub in the comedy &quot;Dr. Dolittle 2&quot;, which starred Eddie Murphy. Later that year, Moore co-starred with Anne Hathaway in the comedy &quot;The Princess Diaries&quot;, based on Meg Cabot&#x27;s novel &quot;The Princess Diaries&quot;, and was released on August 3, 2001. She played Lana Thomas, the rival of Mia Thermopolis (Hathaway). On her role, Moore told &quot;InStyle&quot; Magazine, &quot;I&#x27;m the crude popular girl who gets ice cream in her face.&quot; The film received mixed reviews. Rotten Tomatoes reported that 47% of 113 sampled critics gave the film positive reviews and that it got a rating average of 5.2 out of 10. In the film, Moore performed a cover of Connie Francis&#x27;s 1958 song &quot;Stupid Cupid&quot; while at a beach party.

In 2002, Moore made her starring debut with Shane West and Peter Coyote in the romantic drama &quot;A Walk to Remember&quot;, based on Nicholas Sparks&#x27;s novel &quot;A Walk to Remember&quot;. She played Jamie Sullivan, the unpopular daughter of Reverend Sullivan (Coyote). The film opened at #3 at the U.S. box office raking in $12,177,488 in its opening weekend. The film received generally negative reviews. Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; praised Moore and West&#x27;s &quot;quietly convincing&quot; performances. It was a modest box office hit, earning $41,281,092 in the U.S., and was a sleeper hit in Asia. The total revenue generated worldwide was $47,494,916. Moore received a number of nominations and awards for her performance in the film. Commenting on the film in 2010, she said: &quot;It was my first movie and I know people say it may be cliché and it&#x27;s a tearjerker or it&#x27;s cheesy, but for me, it&#x27;s the thing I&#x27;m most proud of.&quot; Moore&#x27;s self-titled album&#x27;s third and final single, &quot;Cry&quot;, was released on November 4, 2001, to help promote the film.

===2003–2006: &quot;Coverage&quot; and continued acting===
In 2003, Moore began working on her third studio album, later revealed to be a cover album called &quot;Coverage&quot;. The album had covers of 1970s and 1980s songs and was produced by John Fields. Moore&#x27;s cover of John Hiatt&#x27;s 1987 song &quot;Have a Little Faith in Me&quot; was released as the album&#x27;s lead single shortly before the album. The song peaked at number 39 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Pop Songs chart but did not enter the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. &quot;Coverage&quot; was released on October 21, 2003, and received generally mixed reviews. Allmusic called the album a &quot;leap to musical maturity,&quot; &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; called it an &quot;effort to shed her bubblegum-blond image.&quot; The album debuted at number 14 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart, with first week sales of 53,000. This made it Moore&#x27;s highest debut on the chart and highest-peaking album to date, but was also her lowest-selling and her first album not to be certified by the RIAA. Moore&#x27;s cover of XTC&#x27;s 1982 song &quot;Senses Working Overtime&quot; was released as the album&#x27;s second single and failed to have any chart success. Later that year, Moore&#x27;s cover of Carole King&#x27;s 1971 song &quot;I Feel the Earth Move&quot; was included on the compilation album &quot;Love Rocks&quot; from LGBT rights supporters.

In 2004, Moore left Epic after five years because of creative differences. Moore and the label released her greatest hits album, &quot;The Best of Mandy Moore&quot;, on November 16, 2004, to end her contract. The album reached number 148 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. Moore&#x27;s third compilation album, &quot;Candy&quot;, was released on April 5, 2005.

In 2003, Moore co-starred with Allison Janney, Peter Gallagher, and Trent Ford in the romantic comedy-drama &quot;How to Deal&quot; which was based on Sarah Dessen&#x27;s novels &quot;That Summer&quot; and &quot;Someone like You&quot;. She played Halley Martin, a cynical and rebellious seventeen-year-old who deals with falling in love with Macon Forrester (Ford), the new boy at her school and her relationships and issues with her family and friends. The film failed to find teenage audiences in the U.S. and grossed a total of $14 million domestically.

In 2004, Moore co-starred with Matthew Goode in the romantic comedy &quot;Chasing Liberty&quot;. She played Anna Foster, the rebellious eighteen-year-old &quot;First Daughter&quot; who wants more freedom from the Secret Service. The film grossed approximately $12 million. Both &quot;How to Deal&quot; and &quot;Chasing Liberty&quot; received generally negative reviews, respectively; but Ebert singled Moore&#x27;s performances out again and said in his review of &quot;How to Deal&quot; that Moore has &quot;an unaffected natural charm&quot; and &quot;almost makes the movie worth seeing,&quot; and said in his review of &quot;Chasing Liberty&quot; that she has &quot;undeniable screen presence and inspires instant affection.&quot; Other critics called Moore an &quot;actress of limited range,&quot; but one review of &quot;Chasing Liberty&quot; called her the &quot;most painless of former pop princesses.&quot; Late in 2004, Moore co-starred with Jena Malone, Macaulay Culkin and Patrick Fugit in the religion satirical comedy-drama &quot;Saved!&quot;. She played Hilary Faye Stockard, a proper and popular girl at a Christian high school. The film received generally positive reviews; it did not receive a wide release. Moore&#x27;s performance was praised, with one critic calling her a &quot;demented delight&quot; and another calling it her best performance to date. She and Michael Stipe covered The Beach Boys&#x27; 1966 song &quot;God Only Knows&quot;, which bookended the film.

In 2005, Moore co-starred in the sports family comedy-drama &quot;Racing Stripes&quot;, where she voiced Sandy the white horse, and guest-starred in the HBO comedy-drama &quot;Entourage&quot;. Moore was originally scheduled to star in the films &quot;Cursed&quot;, &quot;Havoc&quot; and &quot;The Upside of Anger&quot;, which were all eventually released in 2005, but without her involvement in any of them.

In 2006, Moore guest-starred as Julie Quinn in two episodes of the fifth season of the NBC medical sitcom &quot;Scrubs&quot;, that were the ninth episode &quot;My Half-Acre&quot; and the tenth episode &quot;Her Story II&quot;. The same year, she guest-starred in the Fox animated sitcom &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, where she voiced Tabitha Vixx in the seventeenth-season finale called &quot;Marge and Homer Turn a Couple Play&quot;.

Moore co-starred with Hugh Grant, Dennis Quaid and William Dafoe in Paul Weitz&#x27;s satirical comedy &quot;American Dreamz&quot;, which was released in April 2006. She played Sally Kendoo, a sociopathic contestant on a singing competition series modelled after &quot;American Idol.&quot; Weitz said that he had Moore in mind for the role before she was cast, explaining that &quot;there&#x27;s something inherently sweet about Mandy; it makes it all the more interesting to see her in a villainess role.&quot; Moore has said that she enjoys playing mean-spirited characters, but fears being typecast as a villain. The film opened at number nine at the U.S. box office, eventually totaling barely $7 million, and it received generally mixed reviews. Owen Gleiberman of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; praised Moore&#x27;s and Grant&#x27;s &quot;wicked barbed chemistry&quot; in their roles, but Robert Koehler of &quot;Variety&quot; called Moore&#x27;s role a &quot;pitch-perfect study of a woman for whom a reality show is reality.&quot;

Later in 2006, Moore voiced Nita, the heroine of the Disney animated sequel &quot;Brother Bear 2,&quot; which was released directly to DVD on August 29, 2006. ComingSoon.net praised Moore&#x27;s &quot;surprisingly good performance&quot;. That same year, Moore was originally cast in Emilio Estevez&#x27;s drama &quot;Bobby,&quot; but was replaced by Mary Elizabeth Winstead.

===2007–2009: &quot;Wild Hope&quot; and &quot;Amanda Leigh&quot;===

In early 2006, Moore said that she missed her music career and that singing is what she was the &quot;most passionate about&quot;. In 2004, Moore signed with Sire Records after her contract with Epic ended, but she left the label in May 2006 because of creative differences. She signed with The Firm Music, owned by EMI, in July that year, calling her recording contract &quot;especially exciting&quot;, and saying that she left Sire because she did not want to &quot;follow the mainstream&quot;, but rather have &quot;complete control and freedom&quot; over her music.

Moore co-starred with Diane Keaton, Gabriel Macht and Tom Everett Scott in the romantic comedy &quot;Because I Said So&quot;. The film was released on February 2, 2007, and received mixed to negative reviews, but was a financial success, earning over $69 million worldwide at the box office. Later that year, Moore co-starred with John Krasinski and Robin Williams in the romantic comedy &quot;License to Wed&quot; which was released on July 3, 2007. The film received overwhelmingly negative reviews but was a financial success, grossing $43.8 million domestically and $69.3 million worldwide. &quot;Variety&quot; called the film &quot;an astonishingly flat romantic comedy, filled with perplexing choices&quot;, but called Moore&#x27;s performance &quot;appealing&quot;.

On September 24, 2007, Moore guest-starred in the CBS sitcom &quot;How I Met Your Mother&quot; in the third-season premiere episode &quot;Wait for It&quot;. Later that year, she co-starred with Billy Crudup, Tom Wilkinson and Dianne Wiest in the romantic comedy &quot;Dedication&quot;. She played Lucy Reilly, a struggling children&#x27;s book illustrator who falls in love with Henry Roth (Crudup). The film premiered at the 2007 Sundance Film Festival and received mixed to positive reviews from critics.

Moore&#x27;s fourth studio album &quot;Wild Hope&quot; was released on June 19, 2007, and Moore collaborated with record producer John Alagía and a number of musicians on it, including Chantal Kreviazuk, Lori McKenna, Rachael Yamagata and The Weepies. Moore stayed alone in a house in Woodstock in Upstate New York while recording the album in late 2006. Moore performed the album&#x27;s lead single &quot;Extraordinary&quot; at the Brick Awards on April 12, 2007, and launched a tour in the summer of 2007.

The album received mixed to positive reviews from critics. &quot;Billboard&quot; said that &quot;&quot;Wild Hope&quot; is the gratifying sound of a singer finally finding her comfort zone. Gone is the sugary pop of Moore&#x27;s early career, replaced instead by thoughtful musings on love and life…an album full of subtle, but undeniable hooks.&quot; The album debuted on the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 at #30, selling 25,000 copies the first week of its release, according to &quot;Billboard&quot;. The album also reached No. 9 on The Top Internet albums. To date, the album has sold over 120,000 copies in the U.S. and more than 350,000 copies worldwide. On February 23, 2008, Moore released the album in Australia, and subsequently toured with musician Ben Lee and the West Australian Symphony Orchestra in Western Australia, supporting inaugural &quot;American Idol&quot; winner Kelly Clarkson on her tour.
Moore began working on her fifth studio album &quot;Amanda Leigh&quot; in 2008. Recording sessions for the album took place around December 2008 in Boston, Massachusetts with singer-songwriter, record producer, pianist, and guitarist Mike Viola. The album&#x27;s lead single &quot;I Could Break Your Heart Any Day of the Week&quot; was released on March 17, 2009, and its music video premiered on April 20, 2009, on Yahoo! Music. The single failed to have an impact on any major charts.

&quot;Amanda Leigh&quot; was released on May 26, 2009. On the album, Moore said, &quot;The music is all a reflection of me now, not somebody else&#x27;s choices.&quot; To promote the release, Moore visited a number of talk shows, performing &quot;I Could Break Your Heart Any Day of the Week&quot; on shows including &quot;The Ellen DeGeneres Show&quot; and &quot;The Tonight Show with Jay Leno&quot;. On May 26, 2009, she performed songs from the album at Amoeba Music in Hollywood. The album received generally positive reviews. &quot;Time&quot; magazine called the album &quot;impeccably recorded&quot;. An article on the album by &quot;Paper&quot; magazine said, &quot;Mandy (in the album)... shows real thoughtful and emotional depth.&quot; &quot;Paper&quot; finished by saying that &quot;Moore is a far better musician than she&#x27;s often given credit for.&quot; It debuted at number 25 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, selling 16,000 copies in the U.S. during the week of its release, and at number 4 on the Top Independent albums chart. To date, the album has sold an estimated 100,000 copies. The album was recorded just prior to Moore&#x27;s marriage to musician Ryan Adams and was her final album for over ten years.

=== 2010–2015: &quot;Tangled&quot; and further acting ===
After a break of almost two years from film roles, Moore co-starred with Martin Freeman in the romantic comedy &quot;Swinging with the Finkels&quot;. The film was shot in the United Kingdom in 2009 and was released in 2011. Moore co-starred with Kellan Lutz in the romantic comedy &quot;Love, Wedding, Marriage&quot;. The film was shot in 2010 and released in 2011. In 2010, Moore made a guest-starring appearance as Mary Portman in the ABC medical drama &quot;Grey&#x27;s Anatomy&quot;, for the two-part sixth-season finale, her first television role since 2007. She returned to the show for two episodes of the seventh season.

Also that year, Moore co-starred with Zachary Levi where she voiced Rapunzel in the CGI Disney animated fantasy musical comedy &quot;Tangled&quot;. The film received generally positive reviews from critics. Rotten Tomatoes reported that 89% of critics have given the film a positive review based on 185 reviews, with an average score of 7.5/10. The site&#x27;s consensus read: &quot;While far from Disney&#x27;s greatest film, &quot;Tangled&quot; is a visually stunning, thoroughly entertaining addition to the studio&#x27;s classic animated canon.&quot; Another review aggregator Metacritic, which assigned a weighted average score from 0–100 out of reviews from mainstream film critics, calculated a score of 71 based on 34 reviews. CinemaScore polled conducted during the opening weekend revealed the average grade cinemagoers gave the film was an &quot;A+&quot; on an A+ to F scale. It earned $200,821,936 in North America, and $389,900,000 in other countries, for a worldwide total of $590,721,936. 

Worldwide, it is the 17th-highest-grossing animated film, the eighth-highest-grossing film of 2010, and the third-highest-grossing 2010 animated film, behind &quot;Toy Story 3&quot; and &quot;Shrek Forever After.&quot; It is also the third Disney film appearing in the Top 10 films of 2010. It was the third-highest-grossing film worldwide produced by Walt Disney Animation Studios, behind &quot;Frozen&quot; (2013) and &quot;The Lion King&quot; (1994), as of 2011. Moore and Levi performed the film&#x27;s theme song, &quot;I See the Light&quot;, at the 83rd Academy Awards, where it was nominated for Best Original Song. The song also won a Grammy Award for Best Song Written For Visual Media as well as Best Song at the Las Vegas Film Critics Society. In October 2011, it was announced that she was set to star in an ABC sitcom called &quot;Us and Them&quot;, but the pilot was eventually passed by the network. In 2012, she co-starred with Carla Gugino and Rufus Sewell in Sebastian Gutierrez&#x27;s crime drama &quot;Hotel Noir,&quot; which was released on October 9, 2012, in the U.S. From 2012 to 2013, Moore voiced Mara in the short-lived Disney XD animated science fiction series &quot;&quot;. She voiced the title character in the Disney Junior animated series &quot;Sheriff Callie&#x27;s Wild West&quot; from 2014 to 2015.

In July 2012, Moore announced that she would be collaborating with her then-husband, musician Ryan Adams, on her upcoming sixth studio album. She said: &quot;There&#x27;s a lot to say and a lot that&#x27;s happened to me in the last three or so years since the last record&#x27;s come out, so I have been writing a lot and it&#x27;s definitely going to be an intense, emotional record. I&#x27;m excited about it. I&#x27;m excited to get into the studio and start recording.&quot; On February 20, 2013, it was announced Moore would be starring as Louise in the ABC sitcom &quot;Pulling&quot;, based on the British sitcom &quot;Pulling&quot;. The pilot was written by Lee Eisenberg and Gene Stupnitsky, but in March, as the pilot came closer to production, Moore&#x27;s character was moved in a different direction and Moore considered herself to no longer be the right fit for the role. Moore asked to leave the pilot and ABC agreed to it. In a July 2014 interview with CBS News, Moore said that 2014 was &quot;the year of actual progress forward&quot; on her sixth album and said it was more &quot;dangerous&quot; and &quot;raw&quot; than her previous albums, and said that she hoped to start recording the album in Adams&#x27;s studio later in the summer. On September 5, 2014, she appeared on two tracks on Adams&#x27;s self-titled fourteenth album, &quot;Ryan Adams&quot;. From 2014 to 2015, Moore had a recurring role as Dr. Erin Grace in the short-lived Fox medical comedy-drama &quot;Red Band Society&quot;.

In June 2015, it was confirmed that Moore and Levi would reprise their roles as Rapunzel and Eugene &quot;Flynn Rider&quot; Fitzherbert in an animated television series based on &quot;Tangled&quot;. The series, &quot;&quot;, set between &quot;Tangled&quot; and &quot;Tangled Ever After&quot;, premiered on the Disney Channel in 2017. Moore co-starred with Claire Holt in the underwater survival thriller &quot;47 Meters Down.&quot; Filming began at Pinewood Studios in the United Kingdom and Dominican Republic on June 18, 2015, and finished on August 7, 2015. The film was released on June 16, 2017.

In September 2015, Moore said that she was continuing to work on her sixth album. &quot;I&#x27;ve been working on music steadily for the last couple of years,&quot; she explained. &quot;I guess 2016 will be the re-emergence of my music. That side of my life has been dormant for too long in my opinion.&quot;

===2016–present: &quot;This Is Us&quot;, awards recognition, and albums &quot;Silver Landings&quot; and &quot;In Real Life&quot;===
In September 2016, Moore began co-starring as Rebecca Pearson in the NBC family comedy-drama &quot;This Is Us&quot;, where she later received a Golden Globe Award nomination for her role. In July 2017, Moore announced her intentions to return to music in an interview with &quot;People.&quot; She said, &quot;I want to return to music&quot; and that &quot;I don&#x27;t have a record label, but I have a lot of music written. Next year, I&#x27;ve decided I&#x27;m putting it out there!&quot; In July 2018, she also said on &quot;Jimmy Kimmel Live!&quot; that she might collaborate with her now husband, musician Taylor Goldsmith, Dawes&#x27; lead singer and guitarist, on her new music. In August 2018, Moore co-starred with Amandla Stenberg and Patrick Gibson in the dystopian science-fiction thriller &quot;The Darkest Minds.&quot; In November, she reprised her role as Rapunzel in the Disney CGI animated comedy &quot;Ralph Breaks the Internet&quot; with John C. Reilly, Sarah Silverman, Gal Gadot, Taraji P. Henson, Kristen Bell and Jane Lynch. The film grossed almost $500 million worldwide and received generally positive reviews from critics, who called it a &quot;worthy successor&quot; and praised the animation, humor, characters, plot and the vocal performances of Reilly and Silverman. The film received a Best Animated Feature nomination at the 76th Golden Globe Awards and 24th Critics&#x27; Choice Awards.

In February 2019, Moore co-starred with Justin Bartha, Barbara Jacques and Paul Lieberstein in the short comedic action film &quot;The Big Break&quot;. In March, she co-starred with J.K. Simmons, Sebastian Stan, Max Greenfield and Maika Monroe in the drama &quot;I&#x27;m Not Here&quot; and voiced Courtney in the Fox animated sitcom &quot;Family Guy&quot;, in the season 17 episode &quot;No Giggity, No Doubt&quot;. On March 25, 2019, Moore received her star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. On September 17, 2019, Moore released her first original song in over a decade, the single &quot;When I Wasn&#x27;t Watching&quot;, with an accompanying music video; this was followed by the single &quot;I&#x27;d Rather Lose&quot; on October 31. In November, she co-starred in the independent historical drama &quot;Midway&quot; with Ed Skrein, Patrick Wilson, Luke Evans, Aaron Eckhart, Nick Jonas, Dennis Quaid, and Woody Harrelson.

On March 6, 2020, Moore released her sixth studio album &quot;Silver Landings&quot; via Verve Forecast Records. She said regarding her decision to sign with Verve Forecast in late 2019, &quot;I had slight PTSD from being on labels in the past ... but Verve truly feels like it&#x27;s run by a bunch of deeply creative people who aren&#x27;t necessarily just concerned with the numbers game&quot;. The album was preceded by the single &quot;Save a Little for Yourself&quot; with an accompanying music video.

On May 13, 2022, Moore released her seventh studio album, &quot;In Real Life&quot;. The album was preceded by the release of the single &quot;In Real Life&quot; on March 8. It was accompanied by a cameo-laden music video which featured many of her &quot;This Is Us&quot; co-stars in addition to Wilmer Valderrama, Hilary Duff, Matthew Koma, Amanda Kloots, and Karamo Brown, among others. On April 5, Moore released her second single off the album, &quot;Little Dreams&quot;.

==Musical style and influences==

When Moore&#x27;s musical career began in 1999, she was known for her bubblegum pop sound and image. In 2006, Moore talked about her early albums, saying she believed her debut album &quot;So Real&quot; was appropriate for her age at their time of release, but that she &quot;would give a refund to everyone who bought [her] first two albums&quot; if she could. During a radio interview in April 2006, the show&#x27;s co-host—who had seen Moore&#x27;s comments—asked her for a refund on her debut album, which she fulfilled. Moore has since said that she has become more comfortable with her older music, and that she has found new ways to present her more bubblegum-friendly songs with contemporary musical arrangements.

Moore has often been praised by music critics for branching off and writing her own music. &quot;Billboard&quot; said, &quot;She has successfully dropped all the tacky accoutrements of her past and turned into a sweet, classy singer-songwriter whose charms are readily apparent&quot;. AllMusic said, &quot;Moore smoothly evolved from adolescent starlet to mature songwriter, continuing to distance herself from the scene that had launched her career one decade prior&quot;.

Moore has said that she was inspired by film and television as a child. In 2012, she stated that her then-husband, musician Ryan Adams, had a huge influence on her music and introduced her to heavy metal.

==Personal life ==

Moore dated actor Zach Braff from 2004 to 2006. 

In 2008, Moore began dating musician Ryan Adams. They became engaged in February 2009 and married on March 10, 2009, in Savannah, Georgia. In January 2015, Moore filed for divorce from Adams while he was in New York, citing &quot;irreconcilable differences&quot;. Moore and Adams later released a joint statement explaining their decision, calling it a &quot;respectful, amicable parting of ways&quot;, but in 2019, she called him emotionally abusive. Court documents obtained later revealed that they had been legally separated for nearly six months before the filing. The divorce was finalized in June 2016.

In 2015, Moore began dating musician Taylor Goldsmith. They were engaged in September 2017 and married on November 18, 2018, in Los Angeles, California.

She later learned that her house was still standing, but that almost all of the contents inside were lost due to damage from being surrounded by fire from all sides. Her relatives&#x27; house burned down in the fire. She was subsequently criticized online after sharing on Instagram that a GoFundMe page had been set up for them. People accused her of not being sensitive to the needs of people whose houses burned down who do not have rich celebrities as relatives. Critics also claimed that one of the reasons for such intense backlash to her GoFundMe request was that she allegedly had the &quot;audacity as a multimillionaire&quot; to ask for money from people &quot;living paycheck to paycheck.&quot; She responded by telling her fans that she was helping out her relatives, and to &quot;kindly F OFF&quot;.

<doc id="365965" wikidata="Q725370" url="?curid=365965" title="Ashikaga clan">
<text>The  was a Japanese samurai clan and dynasty which established the Ashikaga shogunate and ruled Japan from roughly 1333 to 1573. The Ashikaga were descended from a branch of the Minamoto clan, deriving originally from the town of Ashikaga in Shimotsuke Province (modern-day Tochigi Prefecture).

For about a century, the clan was divided in two rival branches, the Kantō Ashikaga, who ruled from Kamakura, and the Kyōto Ashikaga, rulers of Japan. The rivalry ended with the defeat of the first in 1439. The clan had many notable branch clans, including the Hosokawa, Imagawa, Hatakeyama (after 1205), Kira , Shiba, and Hachisuka clans. After the head family of the Minamoto clan died out during the early Kamakura period, the Ashikaga came to style themselves as the head of the Minamoto, co-opting the prestige which came with that name.

Another Ashikaga clan, not related by blood, and derived instead from the Fujiwara clan, also existed.

== History ==
Emperor Go-Daigo (1288–1339) destroyed the Kamakura shogunate in 1333, but was unable to control the unrest produced. The emperor&#x27;s inefficient rule led to one of his greatest generals, Ashikaga Takauji (1305–1358), to betray him in 1335. This established the Northern Court, named after its location in Kyoto, which was north of Go-Daigo&#x27;s court. The conflict between Go-Daigo and the Ashikaga clan is known as the Northern and Southern Courts disturbance (南北朝の動乱). In 1392, the Southern Court surrendered to the third shogun Ashikaga Yoshimitsu (1358–1408).

== Notable Shōguns ==
The Ashikaga clan had 15 Shōguns from 1333 to 1573. Some were more powerful or prominent than others. Ashikaga Yoshimitsu was the third shogun of the Ashikaga clan. He made the Ashikaga Shogunate strong and stable. Ashikaga Yoshimitsu was responsible for the defeat of the Southern Court in 1392. Known for his patronage of the arts, he constructed the Kinkaku-ji in 1397. Yoshimitsu also expanded foreign relations with Ming China. Yoshimitsu sent an embassy to Ming Dynasty China in 1401, headed by priest Soa and Hakata merchant Koetomi. They brought with them a conciliatory memorial to the emperor, and numerous gifts including horses, fans, gold, screens, paper, swords, armor, and inkstone cases. The mission was successful, and returned to Japan the following year. A Ming envoy returned alongside Soa and Koetomi, and presented Yoshimitsu with an official imperial Chinese calendar, and documents officially recognizing (or investing) him as &quot;King of Japan.&quot;

After the death of Yoshimitsu, the Ashikaga Shogunate lost power and influence. In 1429, Ashikaga Yoshinori, the sixth shogun, adapted Yoshimitsu&#x27;s policies in order to strengthen the power of the Shogunate. He wanted to increase military power but faced opposition. His 12-year reign saw the restoration of diplomatic ties and trade between Japan and China that had been the fourth Shogun, Yoshimochi&#x27;s undertaking.

Ashikaga Yoshiaki was the 15th and last Shogun. He came into power in 1568 with the help of the general Oda Nobunaga. After rivalry emerged between the two, Nobunaga defeated Yoshiaki and banished him from Kyoto. This effectively ended the rule of the Ashikaga clan in 1573.

<text>Latin dance is a general label, and a term in partner dance competition jargon. It refers to types of ballroom dance and folk dance that mainly originated in Latin America, though a few styles originated elsewhere.

The category of Latin dances in the international dancesport competitions consists of the Cha-cha-cha, Rumba, Samba, Paso Doble, and Jive.

Social Latin dances (Street Latin) include salsa, mambo, merengue, rumba, bachata, bomba and plena. There are many dances which were popular in the first part of the 20th century, but which are now of only historical interest. The Cuban danzón is a good example.

Perreo is a Puerto Rican dance associated with reggaeton music with Jamaican and Caribbean influences. Argentinian folk dances are chacarera, escondido and zamba, also tango used to be a popular dance until the mid-20th century. Cueca is Chilean folk dance. Uruguayan folk dances are pericón, polka, ranchera, etc, also candombe is a common street and parade dance in the cities. Typical Bolivian folk dances are the morenada, kullawada, caporales and the recently created tinku. In Colombia, one of the typical dances is the cumbia.

== Origin ==
Latin dance draws from indigenous American, Iberian, and West African influences. The earliest native roots for Latin dance came from the Aztecs, Guarani, Aymara, Incas and Tehuelches among others. When sixteenth-century seagoing explorers returned home to Portugal and Spain, they brought along tales of the native peoples. According to Rachel Hanson, no one knows how long these dance traditions were established, but they were already being developed and ritualized when they were observed by the Europeans. This suggests that these Native influences became the foundation for Latin dancing. Indigenous dance often told stories of everyday activities such as hunting, agriculture, or astronomy. When European settlers and conquistadors began to colonize South America in the early sixteenth century, they reinvented the local dance traditions, but still kept the styles of the natives. Catholic settlers merged the native culture with their own and incorporated catholic saints and stories to the dance. The Europeans were captivated by the highly structured, large member dance working together in a precise manner.

After the Europeans brought home the Aztec/Inca influences in the sixteenth century, they incorporated their own styles to the dance. Since the Aztec/Inca dances were performed in a group, many of the European dances were performed by a male and female. This was a new practice because European dances prohibited male and female dance partners from touching each other. The benefits of such a dance style allowed musical appreciation and social integration, which became the form of Latin dance. However, “much of the storytelling element disappeared from the genre as the focus moved toward the rhythm and steps,” Hanson explains. The movement evolved differently because it brought a certain element of daintiness to the Aztec dances since the steps were smaller and the movements were less forceful. Combining African styles along with the Native and European influences is what truly makes Latin possible.

The movement and rhythms of African influences left a permanent mark in Latin dance. When the African slaves were forced to Europe in the 1500s, their culture brought styles such as basic, simple movements (putting emphasis on the upper body, torso, or feet) and intricate movements like the coordination of different body parts and complex actions such as “fast rotation, ripples of the body, and contraction and release, as well as variations in dynamics, levels, and use of space.” The difference between the African and European styles was that it included bent knees and a downward focus (grounded to the earth) rather than a straight-backed upward focus like the Europeans, and whole-foot steps than toes and heels. These influences from African roots have allowed Latin dance to become what it is today.

== Development ==

Latin dance is a mix of various dance styles from cultures around the world, creating a dance style encompassing this new age of Latin culture. Influences deriving from West African, African American, and European dance styles were all comprised in the making of many of these Latin dances such as: Salsa, Mambo, Merengue, Rumba, Cha-cha-cha, Bachata, and Samba. Not only have these cultures shaped this style of dance, they&#x27;ve also shaped the music made in Latin America. Music became the engine for Latin dancing because it guided the dance steps with its measure, speed, and the feeling it evoked, from energetic to sensual. Many of these beats come from European folk music, West African beats, and African American jazz. Various Latin American regions developed independent styles, and from each genre, or combination of styles, a different genre was born. For example, the Mambo which was created in the 1940s emerged through the combination of American swing and Cuban &quot;Son&quot; music. Another example is the Romania and Egyptian cultural dance of belly dancing, which has traveled its way to Spain and gained its influence in the repertoire of the Latin dance known as flamenco due to the Moorish conquest of Iberia (Spain) in the Eighth-Century. Though Latin dance is a social dance that can be seen in Quinceañeras, parties, and in other social gatherings, there is no required cultural clothing required for this style of dancing. However, in the dance sport competition world of &quot;Latin dance&quot; each category in Latin dance has its own unique styled costumes along with it. Short rimmed dresses, fringe hems, a skirt or dress, braided hems, and boa feathers and flowers can be seen throughout costume designs.

== The modernization of Latin dance ==
Following the music, movement history, and the rhythms, Latin dance evolved over time and individual steps slowly shifted the repertoire of each dance. It has several different forms and many modernized styles which creates a problem because it is shifting away from its Native, European, and African roots. A popular aerobic dance class known as Zumba is said to be influenced by Latin rhythm and steps. However, there are disagreements among Latin dancers about whether Zumba is a true Latin dance.

<text>X3D Fritz was a version of the Fritz chess program, which in November 2003 played a four-game human–computer chess match against world number one Grandmaster Garry Kasparov. The match was tied 2–2, with X3D Fritz winning game 2, Kasparov winning game 3 and drawing games 1 and 4. 
==Match conditions==

Fritz ran on four Intel Pentium 4 Xeon CPUs at 2.8 GHz.

The match was unique in how Kasparov relayed his moves to the computer. In most human–computer matches, the human makes their moves on a normal board, as in a normal game. These moves are fed into the computer by an intermediary seated where a normal human opponent would be, and its replies played on the board by the same person. In this match, however, no normal board and no intermediary was used. Instead, Kasparov, wearing special glasses provided by X3D Technologies Corp, saw a three-dimensional projection of the board floating in the air in front of him. He spoke his moves out loud, thus conveying them to the computer which had a speech recognition system. The computer&#x27;s replies were shown on the projected board.

The time controls for each game were as follows:
* Start with 120 minutes.
* After move 40, add 60 minutes.
* After move 60, add 15 minutes and 30 seconds per move.

The match was held at the New York Athletic Club in New York City, United States. Kasparov got US$150,000 for playing and an extra $25,000 for the drawn match. Kasparov would have earned an extra $50,000 instead if he had won.

==Games==

The moves of the games are given below.

===Game 1: November 11, 2003, Kasparov–Fritz ½–½===

Opening: Queen&#x27;s Gambit Declined (QGD) semi-Slav: Stoltz variation&lt;br&gt;
ECO: D45

The first game, with Kasparov as White, ended in a draw after Kasparov sacrificed a pawn in the Semi-Slav for a better position. He eventually won a rook for a bishop and pawn, but was unable to convert the advantage into a win. Fritz managed to open lines against Kasparov&#x27;s king, and drew with perpetual check.

1. Nf3 d5 2. c4 c6 3. d4 Nf6 4. Nc3 e6 5. e3 Nbd7 6. Qc2 Bd6 7. g4 Bb4 8. Bd2 Qe7 9. Rg1 Bxc3 10. Bxc3 Ne4 11. O–O–O Qf6 12. Be2 Nxf2 13. Rdf1 Ne4 14. Bb4 c5 15. cxd5 exd5 16. dxc5 Qe7 17.

===Game 2: November 13, 2003, Fritz–Kasparov 1–0===
Opening: Ruy Lopez: Berlin defense&lt;br&gt;
ECO: C65

The second game, with Fritz as White, was a Ruy Lopez. Kasparov played the Berlin Defence (3...Nf6), with which Vladimir Kramnik had drawn against Deep Fritz in the 2002 Brains in Bahrain match (and which Kramnik had also successfully employed as a drawing variation against Kasparov himself in their 2000 World Championship match). Fritz, however, avoided the simplifying main line (4.0-0 Nxe4 5.d4 Nd6 6.Bxc6 dxc6 7.dxe5 Nf5 8.Qxd8+ Kxd8), instead keeping pieces on the board with 4.d3. Kasparov seemed to have at least equal chances until he blundered on move 32 when short of time (see time control) and lost.

1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 Nf6 4. d3 d6 5. c3 g6 6. O–O Bg7 7. Nbd2 O–O 8. Re1 Re8 9. d4 Bd7 10. d5 Ne7 11. Bxd7 Nxd7 12. a4 h6 13. a5 a6 14. b4 f5 15. c4 Nf6 16. Bb2 Qd7 17. Rb1 g5 18. exf5 Qxf5 19.

Qxf8 Nd4 35. Bxd4 exd4 36. Re8 Rg8 37. Qe7+ Rg7 38. Qd8 Rg8 39. Qd7+ 1–0

===Game 3: November 16, 2003, Kasparov–Fritz 1–0===

Opening: QGD semi-Slav: accelerated Meran (Alekhine variation)&lt;br&gt;
ECO: D45

Game three was another Semi-Slav, but Fritz varied from game one early with 5...a6. Kasparov replied with 6.c5 which took the game into the sort of closed position which it is generally believed computers do not play well. The game followed one between Samuel Reshevsky and Paul Keres from the 1948 World Championship Tournament until move 12 when Kasparov varied (Black eventually won that game, though White seemed to be better out of the opening). Kasparov won a pawn while keeping the position closed, and Fritz did not appear to understand the closed position well, moving its pieces back and forth with no obvious plan. In the meantime, Kasparov pushed his extra a-pawn and broke through on the queenside. With the computer having absolutely no counterplay and Kasparov about to force through his b-pawn to promote, winning more material, the Fritz operators resigned on move 45, making the match tied at 1½–1½.

1. Nf3 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 d5 4. d4 c6 5. e3 a6 6. c5 Nbd7 7. b4 a5 8. b5 e5 9. Qa4 Qc7 10. Ba3 e4 11. Nd2 Be7 12. b6 Qd8 13. h3 O–O 14. Nb3 Bd6 15. Rb1 Be7 16. Nxa5 Nb8 17. Bb4 Qd7 18. Rb2 Qe6 19.

===Game 4: November 18, 2003, Fritz–Kasparov ½–½===

Opening: Queen&#x27;s Gambit Accepted (QGA): classical, 6...a6&lt;br&gt;
ECO: D27

Fritz, with the White pieces again, varied from game two immediately with 1.d4. A Queen&#x27;s Gambit Accepted followed, and for a while Kasparov followed a rapid game he had won with Black against Kramnik in 2001. Whereas in that game he exchanged his queen for a rook, bishop and pawn (with 13...Nxd5 14.Rad1 Nxf4 15.Rxd8 Rxd8), here he played more soberly, rapidly exchanging pieces, and quickly drawing. The match ended tied, 2-2.

1. d4 d5 2. c4 dxc4 3. Nf3 e6 4. e3 a6 5. Bxc4 c5 6. O–O Nf6 7. Bb3 cxd4 8. exd4 Nc6 9. Nc3 Be7 10. Re1 O–O 11. Bf4 Na5 12. d5 Nxb3 13. Qxb3 exd5 14. Rad1 Be6 15. Qxb7 Bd6 16. Bg5 Rb8 17.

<doc id="365989" wikidata="Q1018001" url="?curid=365989" title="Butoh">
<text>is a form of Japanese dance theatre that encompasses a diverse range of activities, techniques and motivations for dance, performance, or movement. Following World War II, butoh arose in 1959 through collaborations between its two key founders, Tatsumi Hijikata and Kazuo Ohno. The art form is known to &quot;resist fixity&quot; and is difficult to define; notably, founder Hijikata Tatsumi viewed the formalisation of butoh with &quot;distress&quot;. Common features of the art form include playful and grotesque imagery, taboo topics, and extreme or absurd environments. It is traditionally performed in white body makeup with slow hyper-controlled motion. However, with time butoh groups are increasingly being formed around the world, with their various aesthetic ideals and intentions.

==History==

Butoh first appeared in post-World War II Japan in 1959, under the collaboration of Tatsumi Hijikata and Kazuo Ohno, &quot;in the protective shadow of the 1950s and 1960s avant-garde&quot;. A key impetus of the art form was a reaction against the Japanese dance scene then, which Hijikata felt was overly based on imitating the West and following traditional styles like Noh. Thus, he sought to &quot;turn away from the Western styles of dance, ballet and modern&quot;, and to create a new aesthetic that embraced the &quot;squat, earthbound physique... and the natural movements of the common folk&quot;. This desire found form in the early movement of . The term means &quot;dance of darkness&quot;, and the form was built on a vocabulary of &quot;crude physical gestures and uncouth habits... a direct assault on the refinement (&quot;miyabi&quot;) and understatement (&quot;shibui&quot;) so valued in Japanese aesthetics.&quot;

The first butoh piece, &quot;Forbidden Colors (禁色, Kinjiki)&quot; by Tatsumi Hijikata, premiered at a dance festival in 1959. It was based on the novel of the same name by Yukio Mishima. It explored the taboo of homosexuality and ended with a live chicken being held between the legs of Kazuo Ohno&#x27;s son Yoshito Ohno, after which Hijikata chased Yoshito off the stage in darkness. Mainly as a result of the audience outrage over this piece, Hijikata was banned from the festival, establishing him as an iconoclast.

The earliest butoh performances were called (in English) &quot;Dance Experience&quot;. In the early 1960s, Hijikata used the term to describe his dance. He later changed the word &quot;buyo&quot;, filled with associations of Japanese classical dance, to &quot;butoh&quot;, a long-discarded word for dance that originally meant European ballroom dancing.

In later work, Hijikata continued to subvert conventional notions of dance. Inspired by writers such as Yukio Mishima (as noted above), Comte de Lautréamont, Antonin Artaud, Jean Genet and Marquis de Sade, he delved into grotesquerie, darkness, and decay. At the same time, Hijikata explored the transmutation of the human body into other forms, such as those of animals. He also developed a poetic and surreal choreographic language, , to help the dancer transform into other states of being.

The work developed beginning in 1960 by Kazuo Ohno with Tatsumi Hijikata was the beginning of what now is regarded as &quot;butoh&quot;. In Nourit Masson-Sékiné and Jean Viala&#x27;s book &quot;Shades of Darkness&quot;, Ohno is regarded as &quot;the soul of butoh&quot;, while Hijikata is seen as &quot;the architect of butoh&quot;. Hijikata and Ohno later developed their own styles of teaching. Students of each style went on to create different groups such as Sankai Juku, a Japanese dance troupe well known to fans in North America.

Students of these two artists have been known to highlight the differing orientations of their masters. While Hijikata was a fearsome technician of the nervous system influencing input strategies and artists working in groups, Ohno is thought of as a more natural, individual, and nurturing figure who influenced solo artists.

Starting in the early 1980s, butoh experienced a renaissance as butoh groups began performing outside Japan for the first time; at this time the style was marked by &quot;full body paint (white or dark or gold), near or complete nudity, shaved heads, grotesque costumes, clawed hands, rolled-up eyes and mouths opened in silent screams.&quot; Sankai Juku was a touring butoh group; during one performance by Sankai Juku, in which the performers hung upside down from ropes from a tall building in Seattle, one of the ropes broke, resulting in the death of a performer. The footage was played on national news, and butoh became more widely known in America through the tragedy. A PBS documentary of a butoh performance in a cave without an audience further broadened awareness of butoh in America.

In the early 1990s, Koichi Tamano performed atop the giant drum of San Francisco Taiko Dojo inside Grace Cathedral, San Francisco, in an international religious celebration.

There is a theatre in Kyoto, Japan, called the Kyoto Butoh-kan, which attempts to be dedicated to regular professional butoh performances.

===Debate===
There is much discussion about who should receive the credit for creating butoh. As artists worked to create new art in all disciplines after World War II, Japanese artists and thinkers emerged from economic and social challenges that produced an energy and renewal of artists, dancers, painters, musicians, writers, and all other artists.

A number of people with few formal connections to Hijikata began to call their own idiosyncratic dance &quot;butoh&quot;. Among these are , and Teru Goi. Although all manner of systematic thinking about butoh dance can be found, perhaps Iwana Masaki most accurately sums up the variety of butoh styles:

While &#x27;Ankoku Butoh&#x27; can be said to have possessed a very precise method and philosophy (perhaps it could be called &#x27;inherited butoh&#x27;), I regard present-day butoh as a &#x27;tendency&#x27; that depends not only on Hijikata&#x27;s philosophical legacy but also on the development of new and diverse modes of expression.

The &#x27;tendency&#x27; that I speak of involved extricating the pure life which is dormant in our bodies.

Hijikata is often quoted saying what opposition he had to a codified dance: &quot;Since I believe neither in a dance teaching method nor in controlling movement, I do not teach in this manner.&quot; However, in the pursuit and development of his own work, it is only natural that a &quot;Hijikata&quot; style of working and, therefore, a &quot;method&quot; emerged. Both Mikami Kayo and Maro Akaji have stated that Hijikata exhorted his disciples not to imitate his own dance when they left to create their own butoh dance groups. If this is the case, then his words make sense: There are as many types of butoh as there are butoh choreographers.

===New Butoh===
In 2000 Sayoko Onishi established in Palermo, Italy where she founded the International Butoh Academy at the presence of master and butoh founder Yoshito Ohno. Sayoko Onishi and Yoshito Ohno are credited as being the first butoh choreographers to speak about New Butoh style. The academy name was changed to New Butoh School in 2007. In 2018 the New Butoh School established in Ruvo di Puglia, Italy.

== Butoh exercises ==

Most butoh exercises use image work to varying degrees: from the razorblades and insects of Ankoku Butoh, to Dairakudakan&#x27;s threads and water jets, to Seiryukai&#x27;s rod in the body. There is a general trend toward the body as &quot;being moved&quot;, from an internal or external source, rather than consciously moving a body part. A certain element of &quot;control vs. uncontrol&quot; is present through many of the exercises.

Conventional butoh exercises sometimes cause great duress or pain but, as Kurihara points out, pain, starvation, and sleep deprivation were all part of life under Hijikata&#x27;s method, which may have helped the dancers access a movement space where the movement cues had terrific power. It is also worth noting that Hijikata&#x27;s movement cues are, in general, much more visceral and complicated than anything else since.

Most exercises from Japan (with the exception of much of Ohno Kazuo&#x27;s work) have specific body shapes or general postures assigned to them, while almost none of the exercises from Western butoh dancers have specific shapes. This seems to point to a general trend in the West that butoh is not seen as specific movement cues with shapes assigned to them such as Ankoku Butoh or Dairakudakan&#x27;s technique work, but rather that butoh is a certain state of mind or feeling that influences the body directly or indirectly.

Hijikata did in fact stress feeling through form in his dance, saying, &quot;Life catches up with form,&quot; which in no way suggests that his dance was mere form. Ohno, though, comes from the other direction: &quot;Form comes of itself, only insofar as there is a spiritual content to begin with.&quot;

The trend toward form is apparent in several Japanese dance groups, who recycle Hijikata&#x27;s shapes and present butoh that is only body-shapes and choreography which would lead butoh closer to contemporary dance or performance art than anything else. A good example of this is Torifune Butoh-sha&#x27;s recent works.

Iwana Masaki, a butoh dancer whose work shies away from all elements of choreography, states:

I have never heard of a butoh dancer entering a competition. Every butoh performance itself is an ultimate expression; there are not and cannot be second or third places. If butoh dancers were content with less than the ultimate, they would not be actually dancing butoh, for real butoh, like real life itself, cannot be given rankings.

==Defining butoh==
Critic Mark Holborn has written that butoh is defined by its very evasion of definition. The &quot;Kyoto Journal&quot; variably categorizes butoh as dance, theater, &quot;kitchen,&quot; or &quot;seditious act.&quot; The &quot;San Francisco Examiner&quot; describes butoh as &quot;unclassifiable&quot;. The &quot;SF Weekly &quot;article &quot;The Bizarre World of Butoh&quot; was about former sushi restaurant Country Station, in which Koichi Tamano was &quot;chef&quot; and Hiroko Tamano &quot;manager&quot;. The article begins, &quot;There&#x27;s a dirty corner of Mission Street, where a sushi restaurant called Country Station shares space with hoodlums and homeless drunks, a restaurant so camouflaged by dark and filth it easily escapes notice. But when the restaurant is full and bustling, there is a kind of theater that happens inside…&quot; Butoh frequently occurs in areas of extremes of the human condition, such as skid rows, or extreme physical environments, such as a cave with no audience, remote Japanese cemetery, or hanging by ropes from a skyscraper in front of the Washington Monument.

Hiroko Tamano considers modeling for artists to be butoh, in which she poses in &quot;impossible&quot; positions held for hours, which she calls &quot;&quot;really&quot; slow Butoh&quot;. The Tamano&#x27;s home seconds as a &quot;dance&quot; studio, with any room or portion of yard potentially used. When a completely new student arrived for a workshop in 1989 and found a chaotic simultaneous photo shoot, dress rehearsal for a performance at Berkeley&#x27;s Zellerbach Hall, workshop, costume making session, lunch, chat, and newspaper interview, all &quot;choreographed&quot; into one event by Tamano, she ordered the student, in broken English, &quot;Do interview.&quot; The new student was interviewed, without informing the reporter that the student had no knowledge what butoh was. The improvised information was published, &quot;defining&quot; butoh for the area public. Tamano then informed the student that the interview itself was butoh, and that was the lesson. Such &quot;seditious acts,&quot; or pranks in the context of chaos, are butoh.

While many approaches to defining butoh—as with any performative tradition—will focus on formalism or semantic layers, another approach is to focus on physical technique. While butoh does not have a codified classical technique rigidly adhered to within an authoritative controlled lineage, Hijikata Tatsumi did have a substantive methodical body of movement techniques called Butoh Fu. Butoh Fu can be described as a series of cues largely based on incorporating visualizations that directly affect the nervous system, producing qualities of movement that are then used to construct the form and expression of the dance. This mode of engaging the nervous system directly has much in common with other mimetic techniques to be found in the history of dance, such as Lecoq&#x27;s range of nervous system qualities, Decroux&#x27;s rhythm and density within movement, and Zeami Motokiyo&#x27;s qualitative descriptions for character types.

==Influence==
Teachers influenced by more Hijikata style approaches tend to use highly elaborate visualizations that can be highly mimetic, theatrical, and expressive. Teachers of this style include Yukio Waguri, Yumiko Yoshioka, Minako Seki and Koichi and Hiroko Tamano, founders of Harupin-Ha Butoh Dance Company.

There have been many unique groups and performance companies influenced by the movements created by Hijikata and Ohno, ranging from the highly minimalist of Sankai Juku to very theatrically explosive and carnivalesque performance of groups like Dairakudakan.

==International==
Many Nikkei (or members of the Japanese diaspora), such as Japanese Canadians Jay Hirabayashi of Kokoro Dance, Denise Fujiwara, incorporate butoh in their dance or have launched butoh dance troupes.

More notable European practitioners, who have worked with butoh and avoided the stereotyped &#x27;butoh&#x27; languages which some European practitioners tend to adopt, take their work out of the sometimes closed world of &#x27;touring butoh&#x27; and into the international dance and theatre scenes include SU-EN Butoh Company (Sweden), Marie-Gabrielle Rotie, Kitt Johnson (Denmark), Vangeline (France), and Katharina Vogel (Switzerland). Such practitioners in Europe aim to go back to the original aims of Hijikata and Ohno and go beyond the tendency to imitate a &#x27; master&#x27; and instead search within their own bodies and histories for &#x27;the body that has not been robbed&#x27; (Hijikata).

Marie-Gabrielle Rotie has studied Butoh since 1993, and was fortunate to study in Asbsestos Kan with the widow of Tatusmi Hijikata - Motofuji, and also with Kazuo and Yoshito Ohno in their studio, as well as many other Butoh choreographers who have now departed, including Carlotta Ikeda and Ko Muorubushi. She established and organised Butoh in the UK since 1994 and was the first European artist to receive notable funding support for her pioneering work informed by Butoh into mainstream dance organisations in UK including the Royal Opera House, The Place Theatre and Royal National Theatre (she was choreographer and chorus performer for &#x27;Bacchai&#x27; for Sir Peter Hall). Her choreographer in film includes for The Northman (2022) and movement choreography for Nosferatu (2024/5) for film director Robert Eggers, had enormous positive press responses, particularly for her work with lead actress Lily Rose Depp. 

LEIMAY (Brooklyn) emerged 1996-2005 from the creative work of Shige Moriya, Ximena Garnica, Juan Merchan, and Zachary Model at the space known as CAVE. LEIMAY has organized and run diverse programs including, the NY Butoh Kan Training Initiative which later became the NY Butoh Festival; Vietnamese Artist in Residency; NY Butoh Kan Training Initiative which turned into the NY Butoh Kan Teaching Residency and now is called LEIMAY Ludus Training). A key element of LEIMAY&#x27;s work has become transformation of specific spaces. In this way, the space – at times a body, environment or object – and the body – at times dancer, actor, performer or object – are fundamental to LEIMAY&#x27;s work.

Eseohe Arhebamen, a princess of the Kingdom of Ugu and royal descendant of the Benin Empire, is the first indigenous and native-born African butoh performer. She invented a style called &quot;Butoh-vocal theatre&quot; which incorporates singing, talking, mudras, sign language, spoken word, and experimental vocalizations with butoh after the traditional dance styles of the Edo people of West Africa. She is also known as Edoheart.

COLLAPSING&quot;silence&quot; Performance Troupe (San Francisco) was established and co-founded by Indra Lowenstein and Terrance Graven in 1992 and was active until 2001. They were a movement-based troupe that incorporated butoh, shibari, ecstatic trance states, and Odissi. They designed all of their costumes, props, puppets, and site-specific installations, while collaborating with live musicians such as Sharkbait, Hollow Earth, Haunted by Waters, and Mandible Chatter. In 1996, they were featured at The International Performance Art Festival and also performed at Asian American Dance Performances, San Francisco Butoh Festival, Theatre of Yugen, The Los Angeles County Exposition (L.A.C.E.), Stanford University, Yerba Buena Center for the Arts, the beginning years at Burning Man, and various other venues creating multi-media dance performances.

In 1992, Bob DeNatale founded the Flesh &amp; Blood Mystery Theater to spread the art of butoh. Performing throughout the United States, Flesh &amp; Blood Mystery Theater was a regular participant in the San Francisco Butoh Festival of which DeNatale was an Associate Producer. DeNatale&#x27;s other butoh credits include performing in the film Oakland Underground (2006) and touring Germany and Poland with Ex…it! &#x27; 99 International Dance Festival.

In 2018, Patruni Sastry redesigned Butoh Natyam with the blend of Indian classical dance Bharatanayam with the pedagogy of butoh and presented/performed across 200 shows in India. in later years Patruni also used Butoh as a part of their drag practice.

<text>refers to the classical Japanese performing art of dance.

 developed from earlier dance traditions such as and , and was further developed during the early Edo period (1603–1867), through the medium of kabuki dances, which often incorporated elements from the older dance genres. Although the term means &quot;Japanese dance&quot;, it is not meant to refer to Japanese dance in general, and instead refers to a few dance genres such as , which are performed in theatre. differs from other varieties of Japanese traditional dance, in that it is a refined style intended as entertainment on a public stage.

The term is a modern term coined during the Meiji period (1868–1911) as a term for &quot;dance&quot;, and the writer Tsubouchi Shōyō is believed to have been the first to use the term . Prior to this, dance was generally referred according to its particular dance genre, such as and . The term is a combination of the characters , which can also be pronounced , and , which can also be pronounced . Shōyō intended to be a term for , a form of dance drama in kabuki plays, but the term has now grown to cover several Japanese dance styles, including the modern dance form . As a genre of dance that has multiple influences, borrows from many different dance traditions developed over a long period, overlaps with theatre and has many different schools, there is some difficulty in defining and categorizing .

== Definition ==
=== Wider definition ===
In the broad sense, refers to the dances , and .

* - in the exact definition refers solely to alone
* or - dance born and developed in the region of Kyoto and Osaka (the Kamigata region). developed during the Edo period, and would be performed at private parties on a relatively small surface, such as the surface of one tatami mat. Its movements are slow and gentle. It can be accompanied by music (), composed for a soloist. It is also called , referring to the name of the room () where it is practiced.
* or – has known European and American influences during the 20th century. In the Taishō period (1912–1926), Western arts-inspired writer Tsubouchi Shōyō proposed changes to the performance of kabuki theater, resulting in a new style of dance known as , performed by artists wanting to experiment with a new form of expression.

=== Narrower definition ===
In the narrow sense, refers solely to .

The term dates to the Meiji period. Until then, was referred to by various names such as , , or more simply .

The choreographers of , whose first appearance dates back to around 1673, founded schools to teach this dance to amateurs. , listed as an important intangible cultural property since 1955, is performed by both a kabuki actor and a dancer.

== Dance styles and elements ==

Unlike Noh, , kabuki and theater, which feature male performers, is also performed by women. There are two different dance styles taught in : , &quot;female roles&quot;, and , &quot;male roles&quot;. Thus, a woman can play a male role, and a man can play a female role.

 has three main elements: , and . is a static and abstract movement with an emphasis on the ritual aspect, which is often present in the adaptation sequences of the nô theater; is a dynamic and rhythmic movement resulting from , a dance invented by a Buddhist monk around the 10th century; includes theatrical, dramatic and figurative body language (such as writing a letter, drinking sake, etc.), representing the actions of everyday life in the Edo period.

== Influences ==
=== Kabuki ===
 schools were founded by choreographers (who were originally kabuki musicians or actors), or by actors. These two backgrounds mean that both still share the same dance repertoire.

=== Noh ===
There are many plays which are inspired by Noh theater plays. The three major series of - , and - are adapted from the Noh plays , and , as well as the repertoire series, adapted from Noh during the Meiji period, with inspiration taken from the approach of kabuki adapting Noh dramas. For these plays, Noh dance () is integrated into the choreography.
Even before the Meiji period, there were already -origin kabuki dance plays, but, like Noh, was much adapted after the Meiji period, and this repertoire was appropriated by kabuki actors of this period.
The plays , and , are acts in the kabuki plays adapted from , and .

In addition, during climaxes of plays adapted from (, ), (a style of acting imitating the movements of puppets) is used: the character is supported by puppeteers standing behind him and moves as if he was a puppet.

== Plays ==

 plays consists mainly of kabuki dance plays () created in the Edo period, such as and . In addition, there are plays choreographed with the kabuki dance technique. The themes of the plays are plentiful: legends, classical literature, historical figures, crime stories, and life and customs in the Edo period. There are also adaptations of Noh, , and theater.

Plays danced by one person take up about 60% of the repertoire, and plays danced by more than two people make up the rest of the repertoire. About 60% of the plays consist of pure dance plays without drama (metamorphosis play, Edo period daily life play, festive play), compared to around 40% dramatic plays.

Not all parts can be classified perfectly, but they can be roughly grouped into the following categories:
In the Noh play , the most sacred play mixing dance and prayer ritual for a bountiful harvest and prosperity, three characters, Okina, Senzai and Sanbasō, appear. The latter&#x27;s dynamic dance gave rise to a series of repertoires in kabuki: the play is the most ritualistic, and the rest of the repertoire develops the more entertaining aspects for kabuki: , , , , , , etc.


The Noh play, inspired by the myth of the Dōjōji temple, was adapted in the kabuki dance as , which then gave birth to the main series of the repertoire: , , , , , , etc.
The Noh play , in which the Buddhist monk sees mythical lions playing with peonies at Mount Seiryo in China, was adapted as an (female role) dance in the early kabuki period, resulting in the plays , and . It was around the Meiji period that the adaptation came closer to Noh: the majestic lion dance is performed by a (male actor) in the plays and .
A number of center around stories of ghosts or phantoms.
: A newly-engaged man burns the letter of a courtesan, with whom he had a love affair. In the smoke, the spirit of the courtesan appears and speaks resentfully. The play, , gave variations such as (confession of (literally &quot;castle-toppler&quot;, a moniker given to courtesans) Takao).
: Two characters with totally identical appearances dance together, and one reveals his true, ghostly nature: this style, which originated in a Noh play , has become in vogue with many plays as from . The most famous plays are (the last act of the kabuki play ) and . In these plays, the main character is a ghost with two spirits inside. The souls of two lovers who have killed each other come together in an vengeful half-male, half-female spirit.
=== ===
Inspired by the category of Noh plays about madness, this theme was developed in dance plays from the earliest period of kabuki. Apart from themes of madness in love, another common theme in is madness due to the loss of a child: in the Edo period, a child could be taken away to be sold to circus troupes. In , the central character of the child&#x27;s mother commonly loses her mind to grief, and becomes a traveling artist who searches for her child, singing and dancing. In Noh, this theme is featured in the plays , and .

* Madness among men: , 
* Madness among women: , , , .

; Description of the landscape
: For a long time in Japanese art there has been a style called which describes a journey to a destination. This theme was very popular with the people of the Edo period, as it depicted the freedom of travelling in contrast to the constriction of movement under the shogunate. However, travellers would also be depicted facing melancholy, such as retribution for wrongdoing or attachment to a person met along the journey they must leave. themes are found in the plays (Act VIII of the kabuki play ), (Act IV of the kabuki play ), (Act IV of the kabuki play ).
; Double love suicide
: Since the play (double suicide in Sonezaki) by Chikamatsu Monzaemon, the genre of has been associated with themes of a double suicide: a couple consider killing each other at the end of their journey. There, character psychology is brought to the fore, and the description of the landscape becomes a background. Later, a new style entered into vogue: a peddler or a street artist intervenes during the couple&#x27;s journey, remonstrating with them: (Act IV of the kabuki play ), , .

In , the same actor transforms into different characters with a rapid change of costume, and plays between three and twelve (usually seven) characters, one after another – male and female of all ages, from different periods and of all social strata, animals, apparition, and gods. was very popular at the start of the 19th century, particularly with the two great actors Bandō Mitsugorō III and Nakamura Utaemon III, who competed to develop this genre. Today, the genre of is broken down into several plays, one for each character, which are performed independently, like the famous play , which was originally the first part of a series of five quick-changes: the girl changes into a , a , a and a boatman. Nowadays, many quick-change plays no longer exist in their entirety, with one exception: (six great poets), a play of one performer transforming into 5 poets, for which all 5 quick-changes are still extant and known of.

The most famous plays are , , , , , , and .


* Traditional festival (): The pleasure of popular life was undoubtedly the and many pieces on this theme show the people&#x27;s passion for this festival: , etc.
* Annual events: , etc.
* Peddler: The variety of occupations among the citizens of Edo was surprising, including a peddler or a street performer, who animated the city of Edo. A peddler was not just a salesman, but was accompanied by various performances or songs, sometimes comical, to attract children, and in some cases with an extravagant costume: , etc.
* Street artist: , etc.

* Noh: In the Edo period, when belonging to the warrior class was distinguished from the kabuki which was an entertainment of the popular classes, the adaptation of Noh in the kabuki dance tended to move away from the original piece by completely changing the context, the characters, and the staging. However, in the Meiji era, when the kabuki tried to renew the popular image by introducing the Noh of a high dress, the adaptation of this medieval theater was made by approaching this noble taste, while keeping the content and style of the original piece: , etc.
* : Like Noh, was adapted in kabuki dance after the Meiji era: , etc. However, even before this period, there was already an adaptation of , such as pieces , etc., but it was transformed into kabuki style.
The genre, which already existed in the Edo period in the field of music, consists of pieces created to celebrate the founding of a new school, the inheritance of a name or the inauguration of an establishment etc. Also, around the beginning of the Meiji era, musicians broke away from the kabuki world, and school leaders performed new pieces every New Year. These festive pieces, celebrating prosperity and auspiciousness, were given choreography, often in the style of Noh dance: this genre is called , presented in general in the style called (dance with the kimono or the , without costume): .

== Schools ==
Japan has about two hundred nihon-buyō schools, including the &quot;five great schools&quot;:
# founded in 1849 by Hanayagi Jusuke I, who was a disciple of Nishikawa Senzō IV. This is the school with the most disciples.

<text>In computer programming, rank with no further specifications is usually a synonym for (or refers to) &quot;number of dimensions&quot;; thus, a two-dimensional array has rank &quot;two&quot;, a three-dimensional array has rank &quot;three&quot; and so on.
Strictly, no formal definition can be provided which applies to every programming language, since each of them has its own concepts, semantics and terminology; the term may not even be applicable or, to the contrary, applied with a very specific meaning in the context of a given language.

In the case of APL the notion applies to every operand; and dyads (&quot;binary functions&quot;) have a &quot;left rank&quot; and a &quot;right rank&quot;.

The box below instead shows how &quot;rank of a type&quot; and &quot;rank of an array expression&quot; could be defined (in a semi-formal style) for C++ and illustrates a simple way to calculate them at compile time.
#include &lt;type_traits&gt;
#include &lt;cstddef&gt;
/* Rank of a type
 *
 * Let the rank of a type T be the number of its dimensions if
 * it is an array; zero otherwise (which is the usual convention)
template &lt;typename T&gt; struct rank
 static const std::size_t value = 0;

template&lt;typename T, std::size_t N&gt;
struct rank&lt;T[N]&gt;
 static const std::size_t value = 1 + rank&lt;T&gt;::value;

template &lt;typename T&gt;
constexpr auto rank_v = rank&lt;T&gt;::value;

/* Rank of an expression
 * Let the rank of an expression be the rank of its type

template &lt;typename T&gt;
using unqualified_t = std::remove_cv_t&lt;std::remove_reference_t&lt;T»; 

template &lt;typename T&gt;
auto rankof(T&amp;&amp; expr)
 return rank_v&lt;unqualified_t&lt;T»;

Given the code above the rank of a type T can be calculated at compile time by
:rank&lt;T&gt;::value
or the shorter form

:rank_v&lt;T&gt;

Calculating the rank of an expression can be done using
:rankof(expr)

<doc id="366009" wikidata="Q348358" url="?curid=366009" title="Jack Swigert">
<text>John Leonard Swigert Jr. (August 30, 1931 – December 27, 1982) was an American NASA astronaut, test pilot, mechanical engineer, aerospace engineer, United States Air Force pilot, and politician. In April 1970, as command module pilot of Apollo 13, he became one of 24 astronauts who flew to the Moon. Ironically, due to the &quot;slingshot&quot; route around the Moon they chose to safely return to Earth, the Apollo 13 astronauts flew farther away from Earth than any other astronauts before or since, though they had to abort the Moon landing.

Before joining NASA in 1966, Swigert was a civilian test pilot and fighter pilot in the Air National Guard. After leaving NASA, he ran for Senate but lost in a primary election against Bill Armstrong. Later he ran for Congress, but while running was diagnosed with cancer. He won the election for Colorado&#x27;s new 6th district in 1982, but died before being sworn in.

==Early life==
John Leonard Swigert Jr. was born on August 30, 1931, in Denver, Colorado to parents Dr. John Leonard Swigert Sr. (1901–1974) and Virginia Seep Swigert (1906–1994). Swigert&#x27;s father was an ophthalmologist. At the age of 14, he became fascinated by aviation. While he would have been content just watching planes take off from nearby Combs Field, young Jack became determined to do more than be a spectator. He took on a newspaper route to earn money for flying lessons, and by age 16 he was a licensed private pilot. He was a member of the Boy Scouts of America and attained the rank of Second Class Scout. He attended Blessed Sacrament School, Regis Jesuit High School and East High School, from which he graduated in 1949.

Swigert received a Bachelor of Science degree in mechanical engineering from University of Colorado in 1953, where he also played football for the Buffaloes. He later earned a Master of Science degree in aerospace engineering from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (Hartford campus) in 1965, and a Master of Business Administration degree from University of Hartford in 1967.

His recreational interests included golf, handball, bowling, skiing, swimming, and basketball. His hobbies included photography.

==Flight experience==
Following his graduation from Colorado in 1953, Swigert joined the United States Air Force (USAF). Upon graduation from the Pilot Training Program and Gunnery School at Nellis Air Force Base, Nevada, he was assigned as a fighter pilot in Japan and South Korea. In 1953, he survived his plane crashing into a radar unit on a Korean airstrip.

After completing his tour of active duty in the USAF, he served as a jet fighter pilot with the Massachusetts (1957–1960) and Connecticut Air National Guard (1960–1965). Swigert held a position as engineering test pilot for North American Aviation before joining NASA. He was previously an engineering test pilot for Pratt &amp; Whitney, from February 1957 to June 1964.

He logged over 7,200 hours in flight, including more than 5,725 hours in jet aircraft.

==NASA career==
After unsuccessfully applying for NASA&#x27;s second and third astronaut selections, Swigert was accepted into the NASA Astronaut Corps as part of NASA Astronaut Group 5 in April 1966. Swigert became a specialist on the Apollo command module: he was one of the few astronauts who requested to be command module pilots.

Swigert was a member of Apollo 7&#x27;s astronaut support crew, the first support crew for an Apollo mission; he served as Capsule communicator (CAPCOM) during the ascent phase of the flight.

===Apollo 13===

Swigert was one of three astronauts aboard the Apollo 13 Moon mission launched April 11, 1970. Originally part of the backup crew for the mission, he was assigned to the mission three days before launch, replacing astronaut Ken Mattingly. The prime crew had been exposed to German Measles (the rubella virus) from Charles Duke and, because Mattingly had no immunity to the disease, NASA did not want to risk him falling ill during critical phases of the flight.

Apollo 13 was the third crewed lunar-landing attempt, but was aborted after the rupture of an oxygen tank in the spacecraft&#x27;s service module. Swigert was the astronaut who first announced, &quot;Houston, we&#x27;ve had a problem here&quot;. The statement was then repeated by commander of the flight Jim Lovell. Swigert, along with fellow astronauts Lovell and Fred Haise, traveled around the Moon and returned safely to Earth on April 17 after about 5 days and 23 hours, and received the Presidential Medal of Freedom the next day.

=== Apollo–Soyuz Test Project ===
NASA Director of Flight Crew Operations Deke Slayton, who selected the astronauts, recommended Swigert as command module pilot for the Apollo–Soyuz Test Project, the first joint mission with the Soviet Union. Slayton felt Swigert deserved another chance to fly after having been selected for Apollo 13 two days before launch, and performing well.

During 1972, the Apollo 15 postal covers incident caused NASA investigators to inquire into other astronauts. A number of Apollo astronauts, including Swigert, had made agreements with West German stamp dealer Hermann Sieger, who originated the idea for the Apollo 15 covers, to autograph philatelic items in exchange for a payment of about $2,500. Swigert originally denied involvement when interviewed by NASA investigators. According to Christopher C. Kraft, the investigators subpoenaed his bank records, finding more funds than expected, and records of a predated charitable donation. Swigert&#x27;s subsequent admission caused NASA Deputy Administrator George M. Low to remove him from Apollo–Soyuz.

==Post-NASA career==
Aware that his spaceflight career was most likely over, Swigert took a leave of absence from NASA in April 1973 and went to Washington, D.C. to become executive director of the Committee on Science and Astronautics, U.S. House of Representatives.

Swigert eventually left NASA and the committee in August 1977 to enter politics. He ran for the U.S. Senate in 1978, but was soundly defeated in the Republican primary in September by Congressman Bill Armstrong, who was far better known. In 1979, Swigert became vice president of B.D.M. Corporation in Golden. He left in 1981 to join International Gold and Minerals Limited as vice president for financial and corporate affairs.

In February 1982, Swigert left International Gold and Minerals Limited to run for U.S. Congress in the newly created 6th district as a Republican. When a malignant tumor in his right nasal passage was found, the astronaut-politician disclosed this to the voters. Doctors told him he would finish radiation treatments on June 15 and make a complete recovery. However, in August, Swigert developed back pain and was diagnosed with bone marrow cancer. On November 2, 1982, he won the seat with 64% of the popular vote.

==Death==
On December 19, 1982, seven weeks after his election, he was airlifted from his home in Littleton to Georgetown University Hospital in Washington, D.C. He died of respiratory failure at its Lombardi Cancer Center on December 27, seven days before the beginning of his congressional term, aged 51. He was the last member-elect of the House to die before taking office until Luke Letlow&#x27;s death from COVID-19 in December 2020.

Fifteen astronauts, including fellow Apollo 13 crewmates Jim Lovell and Fred Haise, were among the thousand mourners at his full military honors funeral in Denver, presided over by Archbishop James Casey, which included a missing man flyover by A-7 Corsairs of the Colorado Air National Guard. He is buried alongside his parents (especially his father who predeceased him by eight years and his mother who outlived him for twelve years) in Mount Olivet Cemetery in Wheat Ridge.

==Awards, honors, and organizations==
Swigert received the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics (AIAA) Octave Chanute Award for 1966 for his participation in demonstrating the Rogallo wing as a feasible land landing system for returning space vehicles and astronauts.

President Richard Nixon awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom to the Apollo 13 crew shortly after the conclusion of their mission. Following a sparse parade, Swigert received the City of New York Gold Medal on June 3. He received the City of Houston Medal for Valor, 1970. Swigert received the American Astronautical Society Flight Achievement Award for 1970. He was given University of Colorado-Boulder&#x27;s Distinguished Engineering Alumnus Award in 1970. Vice President Spiro Agnew presented the crews of Apollo 11, 12, and 13 with the NASA Distinguished Service Medal in 1970. The Apollo 13 crew also received the AIAA Haley Astronautics Award in 1971, which included a small monetary award and a medal.

Swigert was awarded the 1972 Antonian Gold Medal.

He was presented an Honorary Doctorate of Science degree from American International College in 1970, an Honorary Doctorate of Laws degree from Western State University in 1970, and an Honorary Doctorate of Science from Western Michigan University in 1970.

In 1983, Swigert was among 14 Apollo astronauts inducted into the International Space Hall of Fame.

In 1988, Swigert was inducted into the Colorado Aviation Hall of Fame.

In 1995, Swigert was portrayed by Kevin Bacon in Ron Howard&#x27;s film &quot;Apollo 13&quot;.

In 1997, Swigert, along with 23 other Apollo astronauts, was posthumously inducted into the U.S. Astronaut Hall of Fame which is located at the Kennedy Space Center.

He was elected in September 2003 to the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute Alumni Hall of Fame.

In 1997, a statue of Swigert made by George and Mark Lundeen was placed on display in the U.S. Capitol Building as one of two statues given by the state of Colorado to the National Statuary Hall Collection. As of December 2008 the statue is on display in Emancipation Hall in the United States Capitol Visitor Center. A duplicate statue is currently on display at Denver International Airport Terminal B, where passengers exit the airport&#x27;s train system.

The Space Foundation was founded in 1983 in part to honor the memory and accomplishments of Swigert. In 2004, the Space Foundation launched the John L. &quot;Jack&quot; Swigert Jr. Award for Space Exploration, which is presented annually to an individual, group, or organization that has made a significant contribution to space exploration. On August 18, 2009, the Space Foundation and Colorado Springs District 11 partnered to open the Jack Swigert Aerospace Academy.

Swigert was a member of numerous organizations. He was a fellow of the American Astronautical Society; associate fellow of the Society of Experimental Test Pilots and the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics; and member of the Quiet Birdmen, Phi Gamma Delta, Pi Tau Sigma, and Sigma Tau.

<doc id="366013" wikidata="Q1137644" url="?curid=366013" title="Pumori">
<text>Pumori (, ) (or Pumo Ri) is a mountain on the Nepal–China border in the Mahalangur section of the Himalayas. Pumori lies just eight kilometres west of Mount Everest. Pumori, meaning &quot;the Mountain Daughter&quot; in Sherpa language, was named by George Mallory. &quot;Pumo&quot; means young girl or daughter and &quot;Ri&quot; means mountain in Sherpa language. Climbers sometimes refer to Pumori as &quot;Everest&#x27;s Daughter&quot;. Mallory also called it Clare Peak, after his daughter.

Pumori is a popular climbing peak. The easiest route is graded class 3, although with significant avalanche danger. Pumori was first climbed on May 17, 1962, by Gerhard Lenser on a German-Swiss expedition. Two Czechs (Leopold Sulovský and Zdeněk Michalec) climbed a new route on the south face in the spring of 1996.

An outlier of Pumori is Kala Patthar (), which appears as a brown bump below the south face of Pumori. Many trekkers going to see Mount Everest up close will attempt to climb to the top of Kala Patthar.

==Trekking and mountaineering==
Nearly 500 people had summitted Pumori by 2005, at a cost of 42 lives. It was noted for its increasing popularity by 2008, with such features as being able to use the Everest base camp for Nepal (when occupied) when trekking or climbing Pumori and offering views of Tibet, Nepal and Everest. However, there have been some dangers from avalanches including some Spanish climbing teams that took heavy losses (such as in 1989 and 2001), and the 2015 avalanche, which was triggered by the 2015 earthquake, originated from the Pumori-Lingtren ridge.

In 1982 a group climbing to Pumori also did a ski-hike around Everest. Jim Bridwell led the climbing expedition to Pumori.

==Ascents==
* 1962 first ascent by Gerhard Lenser of a German-Swiss expedition.
* 1974 &quot;West Face&quot; new route by Alpine Club Unpo, Japan, summit reached by Minoru Takagi and Nobuyaki Kaneko on Oct 13.
* 1982 &quot;Saphire Bullets of Pure Love&quot; new route/first winter ascent by Jim Bridwell, summited by Bridwell, Janet Reynolds (first woman ascent), Ned Gillette, January 6, Everest Grand Circle Expedition, book copyright 1985 Mountaineers Publishing, Seattle Washington
* 1986 &quot;East Face&quot; new route by Hiroshi Aota and Yoshiki Sasahara (Japan) over three days, summiting on December 3.
* 1986 &quot;1985 Catalan Route&quot; on East Face, solo by Todd Bibler, summit reached December 5.
* 2002 Three women (Leila Bahrami, Mitra Nazari, and Farhondeh) from an Iranian expedition reached the summit on October 20 via the southeast face to the east ridge. The Sherpas twice stopped opening the route to the team as they did not expect the women to manage the difficulties.
* 2017 First Winter Ascent of the peak was done for the first time by a Pakistani mountaineer Muhammad Ali Sadpara.

==Ski attempts==
* 1995 Jim Zellers and Tom Burt completed the first snowboard descent of Pumori
* 2013 Seb de Sainte Marie and Paul Holding unsuccessfully attempted to climb and ski the West Face.

==Accidents==
*In late October 1988 two Icelandic climbers died on the mountain. They were found 30 years later, in November 2018 by an American mountaineer.
*In 1989 a team of four Spanish climbers were killed in an avalanche on Pumori, and again in September 2001 another Spanish team was killed in an avalanche.
*On 19 October 2002, five Basque mountaineers were swept 600–800 metres down the southeast face by an avalanche caused by seracs falling above them.
*On 25 April 2015 a 7.8 MW earthquake struck Nepal and triggered several avalanches on and around Mount Everest, including one that hit Everest Base Camp. A witness described it as &quot;a huge avalanche coming off Pumori&quot;. The avalanche traveled through part of the Khumbu Icefall and into the South Base Camp. At least 19 were killed.

<text>In computer programming, a dope vector is a data structure used to hold information about a data object, especially its memory layout.

==Purpose==
Dope vectors are most commonly used to describe arrays, which commonly store multiple instances of a particular datatype as a contiguous block of memory. For example, an array containing 100 elements, each of which occupies 32 bytes, requires 100 × 32 bytes. By itself, such a memory block has no place to keep track of how large the array (or other object) is overall, how large each element within it is, or how many elements it contains. A dope vector is a place to store such information. Dope vectors can also describe structures which may contain arrays or variable elements.

If such an array is stored contiguously, with the first byte at memory location &quot;M&quot;, then its last byte is at location . A major advantage of this arrangement is that locating item &quot;N&quot; is easy: it begins at location . Of course, the value 32 must be known (this value is commonly called the &quot;stride&quot; of the array or the &quot;width&quot; of the array&#x27;s elements). Navigating an array data structure using an index is called dead reckoning.

This arrangement, however (without adding dope vectors) means that having the location of item N is not enough to discover the index N itself; or the stride; or whether there are elements at or . For example, a function or method may iterate over all the items in an array and pass each one to another function or method, which does not know the item is part of an array at all, much less where or how large the array is.

Without a dope vector, even knowing the address of the entire array does not tell you how big it is. This is important because writing to the element in an array that only contains &quot;N&quot; elements, will likely destroy some other data. Because many programming languages treat character strings as a kind of array, this leads directly to the infamous buffer overflow problem.

A dope vector reduces these problems by storing a small amount of metadata along with an array (or other object). With dope vectors, a compiler can easily (and optionally) insert code that prevents accidentally writing beyond the end of an array or other object. Alternatively, the programmer can access the dope vector when desired, for safety or other purposes.

==Description==
The exact set of metadata included in a dope vector varies from one language and/or operating system to another, but a dope vector for an array might contain:

* a pointer to the location in memory where the array elements begin (this is normally identical to the location of the zeroth element of the array (element with all subscripts 0). (This might not be the first actual element if subscripts do not start at zero.)
* the type of each array element (integer, Boolean, a particular class, etc.).
* the rank of an array.
* the extent of an array (its range of indices). (In many languages the starting index for arrays is fixed at zero, or one, but the ending index is set when the array is (re-)allocated.)
* for arrays where the extent in use at a given time may change, the maximum and current extents may both be stored.
* the stride of an array, or the amount of memory occupied by each element of the array.

A program then can refer to the array (or other dope-vector-using object) by referring to the dope vector. This is commonly automatic in high-level languages. Getting to an element of the array costs a tiny bit more (commonly one instruction, which fetches the pointer to the actual data from out of the dope vector). On the other hand, doing many other common operations are easier and/or faster:

* Without a dope vector, determining the number of elements in the array is impossible. Thus it is common to add an extra element to the end of an array, with a &quot;reserved&quot; value (such as NULL). The length can then be determined by scanning forward through the array, counting elements until this &quot;end-marker&quot; is reached. Of course, this makes length-checking much slower than looking up the length directly in a dope vector.
* Without knowing the extent of an array, it is not possible to free() (unallocate) that memory when it is no longer needed. Thus, without dope vectors, something must store that length somewhere else. For example, asking a particular OS to allocate space for a 3200-byte array, might cause it to allocate 3204 bytes at some location M; it would then store the size in the first 4 bytes, and tell the requesting program the allocated space starts at M+4 (so that the caller will not treat the extra 4 bytes as part of the array proper). This extra data is not considered a dope vector, but achieves some of the same goals.
* Without dope vectors, extra information must also be kept about the stride (or width) of array elements. In C, this information is handled by the compiler, which must keep track of a datatype distinction between &quot;pointer to an array of 20-byte-wide elements&quot;, and &quot;pointer to an array of 1000-byte-wide elements&quot;. This means that a pointer to an element in either kind of array can be incremented or decremented in order to reach the next or previous element; but it also means that array widths must be fixed at an earlier stage.

Even with a dope vector, having (only) a pointer to a particular member of an array does not enable finding the position in the array, or the location of the array or the dope vector itself. If that is desired, such information can be added to each element within the array. Such per-element information can be useful, but is not part of the dope vector.

Dope vectors can be a general facility, shared across multiple datatypes (not just arrays and/or strings).

<doc id="366023" wikidata="Q617224" url="?curid=366023" title="Wear">
<text>Wear is the damaging, gradual removal or deformation of material at solid surfaces. Causes of wear can be mechanical (e.g., erosion) or chemical (e.g., corrosion). The study of wear and related processes is referred to as tribology.

Wear in machine elements, together with other processes such as fatigue and creep, causes functional surfaces to degrade, eventually leading to material failure or loss of functionality. Thus, wear has large economic relevance as first outlined in the Jost Report. Abrasive wear alone has been estimated to cost 1–4% of the gross national product of industrialized nations.

Wear of metals occurs by plastic displacement of surface and near-surface material and by detachment of particles that form wear debris. The particle size may vary from millimeters to nanometers. This process may occur by contact with other metals, nonmetallic solids, flowing liquids, solid particles or liquid droplets entrained in flowing gasses.

The wear rate is affected by factors such as type of loading (e.g., impact, static, dynamic), type of motion (e.g., sliding, rolling), temperature, and lubrication, in particular by the process of deposition and wearing out of the boundary lubrication layer. Depending on the tribosystem, different wear types and wear mechanisms can be observed.

==Wear types and mechanisms==
Types of wear are identified by relative motion, the nature of disturbance at the worn surface or &quot;mechanism&quot;, and whether it effects a self regenerative or base layer.

Wear mechanisms are the physical disturbance. For example, the mechanism of adhesive wear is adhesion. Wear mechanisms and/or sub-mechanisms frequently overlap and occur in a synergistic manner, producing a greater rate of wear than the sum of the individual wear mechanisms.

===Adhesive wear===

Adhesive wear can be found between surfaces during frictional contact and generally refers to unwanted displacement and attachment of wear debris and material compounds from one surface to another. Two adhesive wear types can be distinguished:
#Adhesive wear is caused by relative motion, &quot;direct contact&quot; and plastic deformation which create wear debris and material transfer from one surface to another.
#Cohesive adhesive forces, holds two surfaces together even though they are separated by a measurable distance, with or without any actual transfer of material.
Generally, adhesive wear occurs when two bodies slide over or are pressed into each other, which promote material transfer. This can be described as plastic deformation of very small fragments within the surface layers. The asperities or microscopic high points (surface roughness) found on each surface affect the severity of how fragments of oxides are pulled off and added to the other surface, partly due to strong adhesive forces between atoms, but also due to accumulation of energy in the plastic zone between the asperities during relative motion.

The type of mechanism and the amplitude of surface attraction varies between different materials but are amplified by an increase in the density of &quot;surface energy&quot;. Most solids will adhere on contact to some extent. However, oxidation films, lubricants and contaminants naturally occurring generally suppress adhesion, and spontaneous exothermic chemical reactions between surfaces generally produce a substance with low energy status in the absorbed species.

Adhesive wear can lead to an increase in roughness and the creation of protrusions (i.e., lumps) above the original surface. In industrial manufacturing, this is referred to as galling, which eventually breaches the oxidized surface layer and connects to the underlying bulk material, enhancing the possibility for a stronger adhesion and plastic flow around the lump.

A simple model for the wear volume for adhesive wear, formula_1, can be described by:

formula_2 

where formula_3 is the load, formula_4 is the wear coefficient, formula_5 is the sliding distance, and formula_6 is the hardness.

===Abrasive wear===

Abrasive wear occurs when a hard rough surface slides across a softer surface. ASTM International defines it as the loss of material due to hard particles or hard protuberances that are forced against and move along a solid surface.

Abrasive wear is commonly classified according to the type of contact and the contact environment. The type of contact determines the mode of abrasive wear. The two modes of abrasive wear are known as two-body and three-body abrasive wear. Two-body wear occurs when the grits or hard particles remove material from the opposite surface. The common analogy is that of material being removed or displaced by a cutting or plowing operation. Three-body wear occurs when the particles are not constrained, and are free to roll and slide down a surface. The contact environment determines whether the wear is classified as open or closed. An open contact environment occurs when the surfaces are sufficiently displaced to be independent of one another

There are a number of factors which influence abrasive wear and hence the manner of material removal. Several different mechanisms have been proposed to describe the manner in which the material is removed. Three commonly identified mechanisms of abrasive wear are:

# Plowing
# Cutting
# Fragmentation

Plowing occurs when material is displaced to the side, away from the wear particles, resulting in the formation of grooves that do not involve direct material removal. The displaced material forms ridges adjacent to grooves, which may be removed by subsequent passage of abrasive particles.

Cutting occurs when material is separated from the surface in the form of primary debris, or microchips, with little or no material displaced to the sides of the grooves. This mechanism closely resembles conventional machining.

Fragmentation occurs when material is separated from a surface by a cutting process and the indenting abrasive causes localized fracture of the wear material. These cracks then freely propagate locally around the wear groove, resulting in additional material removal by spalling.

Abrasive wear can be measured as loss of mass by the Taber Abrasion Test according to ISO 9352 or ASTM D 4060.

The wear volume for single-abrasive wear, formula_1, can be described by:

formula_8 

where formula_3 is the load, formula_10 is the shape factor of an asperity (typically ~ 0.1), formula_11 is the degrees of wear by an asperity (typically 0.1 to 1.0), formula_4 is the wear coefficient, formula_5 is the sliding distance, and formula_6 is the hardness.

===Surface fatigue===
Surface fatigue is a process in which the surface of a material is weakened by cyclic loading, which is one type of general material fatigue. Fatigue wear is produced when the wear particles are detached by cyclic crack growth of microcracks on the surface. These microcracks are either superficial cracks or subsurface cracks.

===Fretting wear===
Fretting wear is the repeated cyclical rubbing between two surfaces. Over a period of time fretting which will remove material from one or both surfaces in contact. It occurs typically in bearings, although most bearings have their surfaces hardened to resist the problem. Another problem occurs when cracks in either surface are created, known as fretting fatigue. It is the more serious of the two phenomena because it can lead to catastrophic failure of the bearing. An associated problem occurs when the small particles removed by wear are oxidized in air. The oxides are usually harder than the underlying metal, so wear accelerates as the harder particles abrade the metal surfaces further. Fretting corrosion acts in the same way, especially when water is present. Unprotected bearings on large structures like bridges can suffer serious degradation in behaviour, especially when salt is used during the winter to deice the highways carried by the bridges. The problem of fretting corrosion was involved in the Silver Bridge tragedy and the Mianus River Bridge accident.

===Erosive wear===

Erosive wear can be defined as an extremely short sliding motion and is executed within a short time interval. Erosive wear is caused by the impact of particles of solid or liquid against the surface of an object. The impacting particles gradually remove material from the surface through repeated deformations and cutting actions. It is a widely encountered mechanism in industry. Due to the nature of the conveying process, piping systems are prone to wear when abrasive particles have to be transported.

The rate of erosive wear is dependent upon a number of factors. The material characteristics of the particles, such as their shape, hardness, impact velocity and impingement angle are primary factors along with the properties of the surface being eroded. The impingement angle is one of the most important factors and is widely recognized in literature. For ductile materials, the maximum wear rate is found when the impingement angle is approximately 30°, whilst for non-ductile materials the maximum wear rate occurs when the impingement angle is normal to the surface. A detailed theoretical analysis of dependency of the erosive wear on the inclination angle and material properties is provided in.

For a given particle morphology, the erosion rate, formula_15, can be fit with a power law dependence on velocity:

formula_16

where formula_17 is a constant, formula_18 is velocity, and formula_19 is a velocity exponent. formula_19 is typically between 2 - 2.5 for metals and 2.5 - 3 for ceramics.

===Corrosion and oxidation wear===

Corrosion and oxidation wear occurs both in lubricated and dry contacts. The fundamental cause are chemical reactions between the worn material and the corroding medium. Wear caused by a synergistic action of tribological stresses and corrosion is also called tribocorrosion.

===Impact Wear===

Impact wear is caused by contact between two bodies. Unlike erosive wear, impact wear always occurs at the same, well-defined place. If the impact is repeated, then usually with constant kinetic energy at the moment of impact. The frequency of impacts can vary. Wear can occur on both bodies, but usually, one body has significantly higher hardness and toughness and its wear is neglected.

===Other Types of Wear===
Other, less common types of wear are cavitation and diffusive wear.

==Wear stages==
Under nominal operation conditions, the wear rate normally changes in three different stages:

*Primary stage or early run-in period, where surfaces adapt to each other and the wear-rate might vary between high and low.
*Secondary stage or mid-age process, where steady wear can be observed. Most of the component&#x27;s operational life is spent in this stage.
*Tertiary stage or old-age period, where surfaces are subjected to rapid failure due to a high rate of wear.

The wear rate is strongly influenced by the operating conditions and the formation of tribofilms. The secondary stage is shortened with increasing severity of environmental conditions, such as high temperatures, strain rates and stresses.

So-called wear maps, demonstrating wear rate under different operation condition, are used to determine stable operation points for tribological contacts. Wear maps also show dominating wear modes under different loading conditions.

In explicit wear tests simulating industrial conditions between metallic surfaces, there are no clear chronological distinction between different wear-stages due to big overlaps and symbiotic relations between various friction mechanisms. Surface engineering and treatments are used to minimize wear and extend the components working life.

==Wear testing==

Several standard test methods exist for different types of wear to determine the amount of material removal during a specified time period under well-defined conditions. ASTM International Committee G-2 standardizes wear testing for specific applications, which are periodically updated. The Society for Tribology and Lubrication Engineers (STLE) has documented a large number of frictional, wear and lubrication tests. Standardized wear tests are used to create comparative material rankings for a specific set of test parameter as stipulated in the test description. To obtain more accurate predictions of wear in industrial applications it is necessary to conduct wear testing under conditions simulating the exact wear process.

An attrition test is a test that is carried out to measure the resistance of a granular material to wear.

==Modeling of wear==

The Reye–Archard–Khrushchov wear law is the classic wear prediction model.

==Measuring wear==

=== Wear coefficient ===

The wear coefficient is a physical coefficient used to measure, characterize and correlate the wear of materials.

=== Lubricant analysis ===
Lubricant analysis is an alternative, indirect way of measuring wear. Here, wear is detected by the presence of wear particles in a liquid lubricant. To gain further insights into the nature of the particles, chemical (such as XRF, ICP-OES), structural (such as ferrography) or optical analysis (such as light microscopy) can be performed.

<text>AltaVista was a web search engine established in 1995. It became one of the most-used early search engines, but lost ground to Google and was purchased by Yahoo! in 2003, which retained the brand, but based all AltaVista searches on its own search engine. On July 8, 2013, the service was shut down by Yahoo!, and since then the domain has redirected to Yahoo!&#x27;s own search site.

== Etymology ==
The word &quot;AltaVista&quot; is formed from the words for &quot;high view&quot; or &quot;upper view&quot; in Spanish (alta + vista); thus, it colloquially translates to &quot;overview&quot;.

== Origins ==
AltaVista was created by researchers at Digital Equipment Corporation&#x27;s Network Systems Laboratory and Western Research Laboratory who were trying to provide services to make finding files on the public network easier. Paul Flaherty came up with the original idea, along with Louis Monier and Michael Burrows, who wrote the Web crawler and indexer, respectively. The name &quot;AltaVista&quot; was chosen in relation to the surroundings of their company at Palo Alto, California. AltaVista publicly launched as an Internet search engine on December 15, 1995. 

Ilene H. Lang was the founding CEO of AltaVista after being recruited by Digital Equipment Corporation to build its software business.

At launch, the service had two innovations that put it ahead of other search engines available at the time: It used a fast, multi-threaded crawler (Scooter) that could cover many more Web pages than were believed to exist at the time, and it had an efficient back-end search, running on advanced hardware.

== Popularity ==

AltaVista was the first searchable, full-text database on the World Wide Web with a simple interface. Another distinguishing feature of AltaVista was its minimalistic interface, which was lost when it became a Web portal, but regained when it refocused its efforts on its search function. It also allowed the user to limit search results from a domain, reducing the likelihood of multiple results from the same source.

AltaVista&#x27;s site was an immediate success. Traffic increased steadily from 300,000 hits on the first day to more than 80 million hits per day two years later. The ability to search the Web, and AltaVista&#x27;s service in particular, became the subject of numerous articles and even some books. The AltaVista site became one of the top destinations on the Web, and in 1997 it earned US$50 million in sponsorship revenue. It was the 11th most visited Web site in 1998 and in 2000.

AltaVista was the most favored search engine used by professional researchers at the &quot;Internet Search-Off&quot; study in February 1998, with 45 percent of the researchers choosing it. Second place belonged to HotBot at 20 percent.

By using the data collected by the crawler, employees from AltaVista, together with others from IBM and Compaq, were the first to analyze the strength of connections within the budding World Wide Web in a seminal study in 2000.

In 2000, AltaVista was used by 17.7% of Internet users while Google was used by only 7% of Internet users, according to Media Metrix.

== Technology ==

As of 1998, AltaVista is based on weighted boolean search. There are two major search modes: simple querying and advanced querying.

=== Query format ===
A &quot;simple query&quot; looks like `word1 word2 &quot;phrase&quot; -word3 +word4` which is interpreted as &quot;(word1 OR word2 OR &quot;phrase&quot;) AND NOT word3 AND word4&quot;. Words within double quotes are phrases: they must be adjacent in a document for the document to match the query. A &quot;query term&quot; is a word or a phrase.
An &quot;advanced query&quot; is an explicit Boolean expression. In advanced query mode, `and`, `or`, and `not` are interpreted as Boolean operators rather than as search terms. Advanced queries may also include `near`: the words on either side of `near` must be close -- but not necessarily adjacent.

Both simple and advanced queries support `host:xx.yy.zz` which queries only documents found on the hostname (web domain) `xx.yy.zz`. A pull-down menu allows the user to restrict result pages only to pages in a particular language. In the advanced search, an input box allows the user to restrict the results to pages last modified on a certain date, or within a range of dates.

AltaVista returned URLs ranked by its internal &quot;relevance function&quot;. Each page contains 10 URLs. The user may click on &quot;3&quot;, for instance, to get to the 21st-30th most relevant URLs. This differed from some other search engines, where the user can jump to only the next 10 or previous 10 URLs.

=== Query log ===
AltaVista logs user requests in a &quot;query log&quot; A request may consist of a new query or a new result screen for a previously submitted query. Each request includes the following fields: Unix timestamp for the query; cookie (blank if the user has disabled cookies); query terms; result URLs; other user-specified query modifiers, such as a restriction on the result pages&#x27; language or date of last modification; metadata, such as whether the query is a simple or an advanced query, the browser the submitter is using, the IP address of the submitting host, etc.

AltaVista collected session information to study querying behavior. A &quot;session&quot; is a series of queries by a single user made clustered within a small range of time. Queries with the same cookie are assumed to come from the same user. For those 4% of queries in which the user has disallowed cookies, then the pair &quot;domain IP / web browser used&quot; was used. It was a poor substitute for cookies, particularly for large ISPs such as AOL, where ~10,000 of users shared a single IP address.

== Business transactions ==
In 1996, AltaVista became the exclusive provider of search results for Yahoo!. In 1998, Digital was sold to Compaq, and in 1999, Compaq redesigned AltaVista as a Web portal, hoping to compete with Yahoo!. Under CEO Rod Schrock, AltaVista abandoned its streamlined search page and focused on adding features such as shopping and free e-mail. In June 1998, Compaq paid AltaVista Technology Incorporated (ATI) $3.3 million for the domain name &quot;altavista.com&quot; – Jack Marshall, cofounder of ATI, had registered the name in 1994.

In June 1999, Compaq sold a majority stake in AltaVista to CMGI, an Internet investment company. CMGI filed for an initial public offering (IPO) for AltaVista to take place in April 2000, but when the Internet bubble collapsed, the IPO was cancelled. Meanwhile, it became clear that AltaVista&#x27;s Web portal strategy was unsuccessful, and the search service began losing market share, especially to Google. After a series of layoffs and several management changes, AltaVista gradually shed its portal features and refocused on search. By 2002, AltaVista had improved the quality and freshness of its results and redesigned its user interface.

In February 2003, AltaVista was bought by Overture Services, Inc. for $140 million. In July 2003, Overture was taken over by Yahoo!. After Yahoo! purchased Overture, AltaVista used the same search index as Yahoo! Search - the same search engine it had provided results to previously.

In December 2010, a Yahoo! employee leaked PowerPoint slides indicating that the search engine would shut down as part of a consolidation at Yahoo!.

== Free services ==
AltaVista provided Babel Fish, a Web-based machine translation application that translated text or webpages from one of several languages into another. It was later superseded by Yahoo! Babel Fish in May 2008 and now redirects to Bing&#x27;s translation service.

AltaVista also provided a free email service which had 200,000 active registered email accounts using the &quot;altavista.com&quot; domain and others before shutting down in March 2002. Domestic US accounts were closed; others were sold to Mail.com.

== First CAPTCHA system ==
To fight against an increasing number of malicious internet bots, AltaVista implemented the first practical CAPTCHA schemes to protect against fraudulent account registrations. They implemented it specifically to prevent bots from adding URLs to their web search engine.

== Shutdown ==
On June 28, 2013, Yahoo! announced on its Tumblr page that AltaVista would shut down on July 8, 2013; since that date, visits to AltaVista&#x27;s home page redirect to Yahoo!&#x27;s main page.

<text>Luigi Lablache (6 December 1794 – 23 January 1858) was an Italian opera singer of French and Irish ancestry. He was most noted for his comic performances, possessing a powerful and agile bass voice, a wide range, and adroit acting skills: Leporello in &quot;Don Giovanni&quot; was one of his signature roles.

== Biography ==
Luigi Lablache was born in Naples, the son of Nicolas Lablache, a merchant from Marseille, France, to an Irish lady Rose Anne Maguire. He was educated from 1806 at the Conservatorio della Pietà de&#x27; Turchini in Naples, where Gentili taught him the elements of music, and Giovanni Valesi instructed him in singing, while at the same time he studied the violin and cello. He fled the Conservatorio five times in order to pursue an acting career, but each time he was brought back in disgrace. His voice was a beautiful contralto, and just before it broke he sang the solos in Mozart&#x27;s &quot;Requiem&quot; on the death of Joseph Haydn in 1809.

Before long he became possessed of a magnificent bass, which gradually increased in volume until at the age of twenty it had attained a compass of two octaves from E-flat below to E-flat above the bass stave. In 1812, when only eighteen, he was engaged at the Teatro di San Carlo, Naples, and appeared in Valentino Fioravanti&#x27;s &quot;La Molinara&quot;. From 1812 to 1817, he sang at Palermo. In 1817, at La Scala in Milan, he took the part of Dandini in Rossini&#x27;s &quot;La Cenerentola&quot;. The opera &quot;Elisa e Claudio&quot; was written for him in 1821 by Saverio Mercadante and his position was assured. His reputation spread throughout Europe.
From Milan he went to Turin, returned to Milan in 1822, then appeared at Venice, and in 1824 at Vienna. Going back to Naples after an absence of twelve years, he created a great sensation as Assur in Rossini&#x27;s &quot;Semiramide&quot;. On 30 March 1830, under Ebers&#x27;s management, he was first heard in London as Geronimo in Cimarosa&#x27;s &quot;Il matrimonio segreto&quot; and thenceforth appeared there annually, also singing in many provincial festivals. In 1827 Franz Schubert wrote three songs in Italian (Op. 83, D. 902) for Lablache, marvellous exercises in Rossinian pastiche; they are among the last songs he ever wrote.

A physically imposing man, his voice was at all times extraordinarily powerful; but he could produce comic, humorous, tender, or sorrowful effects with equal ease and mastery. As an actor, he excelled equally in comic and tragic parts. His chief rôles were Leporello (his greatest part), Geronimo the Podestà in &quot;La gazza ladra&quot;, Dandini in &quot;La Prova d&#x27; un&#x27; Opera Seria&quot;, Henry VIII in &quot;Anna Bolena&quot; the Doge in &quot;Marino Faliero&quot;, and Oroveso in &quot;Norma&quot;. He created the title role in Donizetti&#x27;s &quot;Don Pasquale&quot; in 1843 and Massimiliano in Verdi&#x27;s &quot;I masnadieri&quot; in 1847. Towards the close of his career he played two new characters of quite different types with great success, Shakespeare&#x27;s Caliban in Fromental Halévy&#x27;s &quot;La Tempesta&quot; and Gritzenko, the Kalmuck, in Scribe&#x27;s and Meyerbeer&#x27;s &quot;L&#x27;étoile du nord&quot;.

At the funeral of Beethoven in 1827 he was one of the thirty-two torchbearers who surrounded the coffin, and he also sang in Mozart&#x27;s &quot;Requiem&quot;. He sang the same &quot;Requiem&quot; at Chopin&#x27;s funeral in 1849. He was the soloist, singing a &quot;Lacrimosa&quot;, at Bellini&#x27;s funeral in 1835.

In 1836/37 he taught singing to Princess Victoria of the United Kingdom, the later Queen Victoria.

Luigi Lablache died at Naples on 23 January 1858, and was buried at Maisons-Laffitte, near Paris.

Lablache had married the singer Teresa Pinotti in 1813, and they had thirteen children; several of them, notably Frederick Lablache, were also singers. His eldest daughter, Francesca (Cecchina), married the pianist Sigismond Thalberg in 1843, and his younger daughter, Therese, married the opera singer Hans von Rokitansky. The actor Stewart Granger was his great-great-grandson, and the BBC TV Antiques Roadshow expert Bunny Campione is also a descendant.

<text>Lifetime is a Canadian English-language discretionary specialty channel based on the eponymous American basic cable channel owned by Showcase Television Inc., a subsidiary of Corus Entertainment. It broadcasts films, television shows and reality series aimed at women.

The channel was launched on September 7, 2001 as Showcase Diva as a digital offshoot of Showcase by Alliance Atlantis focusing on films targeting a female audience. After a series of ownership changes, the channel was relaunched into its current name in 2012 with the Lifetime branding licensed by A&amp;E Networks.

==History==

In November 2000, Alliance Atlantis (via the Showcase Television subsidiary) was granted approval by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) to launch a television channel called &quot;Romance Television&quot;, described as &quot;a national English-language Category 2 specialty television service devoted to romance. Programming will include relationship- themed game shows and magazine style programs featuring romantic vacation resorts. Other programs will explore romantic moments in people&#x27;s lives, as well as classic romantic feature films, epic mini-series and made-for-television movies.&quot;

The channel was launched on September 7, 2001 as Showcase Diva, a spin-off of Showcase. Programming consisted of primarily television dramas and films.

On January 18, 2008, Canwest Global acquired control of Showcase Diva through its purchase of Alliance Atlantis&#x27; broadcasting assets, which were placed in a trust in August 2007.
On October 27, 2010, ownership changed again as Shaw Communications gained control of Showcase Diva as a result of its acquisition of Canwest and Goldman Sachs&#x27; interest in CW Media.
On May 30, 2012, it was announced that Showcase Diva would be rebranded as a Canadian version of Lifetime on August 27, 2012, through a brand licensing agreement with the U.S. channel&#x27;s parent company A&amp;E Networks. The rebrand would result in the addition of more reality series, talk shows and other original series from Lifetime to the channel&#x27;s films and television dramas.

An HD feed was launched on May 29, 2013, along with the never-before-seen HD feeds for H2, Slice, and the DHX-owned Disney Junior service (now known as Family Jr.).

In February 2022, Lifetime was added to streaming bundle StackTV. It was later added in February 2023 to the Global TV app along with the Canadian version of the Magnolia Network.

<doc id="366033" wikidata="Q3328453" url="?curid=366033" title="Max (Canadian TV channel)">
<text>Max is a Canadian French language specialty channel owned by Remstar Media Group, a division of Remstar. The channel primarily broadcasts entertainment programming, focusing on scripted television series and films.

Established in 1997 as MusiMax as a joint venture between CHUM Limited and Radiomutuel, it was originally conceived as a sister network to MusiquePlus, and focused primarily on adult contemporary music (making it the French-language equivalent to MuchMusic&#x27;s then-sister network MuchMoreMusic). After the acquisition of CHUM by CTVglobemedia, Radiomutuel&#x27;s successor Astral Media acquired CHUM&#x27;s stake in MusiMax, marking its separation from common ownership with its English counterpart. When Astral was acquired by CTVglobemedia&#x27;s predecessor Bell Media in 2013, MusiquePlus was sold to V Media Group, parent company of Quebec&#x27;s V network.

As with its English counterpart, MusiMax was formerly oriented primarily towards music programming. Due to shrinking interest in music television because of the growth of online platforms, MusiMax increasingly focused on non-music programming targeting a young adult audience, such as scripted programming and films. In 2016, Remstar relaunched MusiMax as Max into its current format while M3 (the former MuchMoreMusic) was replaced into the Canadian version of Gusto, which was renamed into CTV Life Channel in 2019.

As a former Category A service, Max was required to be carried on the basic service of all digital television providers serving the province of Quebec. The channel was, and still is, typically offered optionally at the discretion of providers outside of the province.

==History==

CHUM Limited first pursued a license from the CRTC for MuchMoreMusic—an adult contemporary counterpart to MuchMusic—in 1993, as part of a round of applications for new specialty channels. CHUM also proposed MusiquExtra, a French-language counterpart that would be a sister to MusiquePlus. The CRTC approved only Maclean-Hunter and Rawlco Communications&#x27; The Country Network, denying all other applicants.

CHUM submitted its proposals again in January 1996; they included both MuchMoreMusic and its French counterpart with Radiomutuel, now known as MusiMax, which proposed a service &quot;designed for an adult audience that will be devoted to music in all its forms&quot;&quot;.&quot; On September 4, 1996, the CRTC approved CHUM and Radiomutel&#x27;s application for Musimax. The channel launched on September 8, 1997.
In June 1999, Astral Media announced it would take over Radiomutuel and gain control of Radiomutuel&#x27;s assets including MusiMax shortly thereafter. In July 2006, CTVglobemedia announced it would acquire CHUM Limited. While the company initially planned to keep MusiquePlus and MusiMax, it instead elected to sell its stakes in the networks. On April 11, 2007, Astral Media announced that it would be acquiring the remaining 50% in MusiMax and MusiquePlus from CHUM Limited, giving it majority ownership. The sale was completed on June 30, 2007.
On March 4, 2013, following the Competition Bureau&#x27;s approval of Bell Media&#x27;s takeover of Astral, Bell announced that it would sell MusiquePlus, MusiMax, and Family and its three sister networks in an attempt to relieve CRTC concerns regarding the takeover. On December 4, 2013, Remstar, owners of the French television system V, announced that it would acquire MusiquePlus and MusiMax for an undisclosed amount through its subsidiary V Media Group. On September 11, 2014, the CRTC approved the sale. The acquisition is valued at $15.5 million; to fund the purchase, Remstar will sell 15% stakes in V Media to the Caisse, Fonds de solidarité FTQ and a third unannounced investor, and sell $1.5 million in advertising time across MusiquePlus and MusiMax to Bell. Remstar also successfully applied to have the amount of music-oriented programming the channel must air reduced to 80%. The sale was closed on September 16, 2014.

On August 29, 2016, MusiMax rebranded as Max, switching to a general entertainment format.

==Max HD==
On August 23, 2010, Astral launched a HD feed of MusiMax called MusiMax HD. It is available on Bell Fibe TV, Cogeco and Vidéotron. On August 29th, 2016, Musimax HD rebranded to Max HD due to the name change.

<doc id="366038" wikidata="Q7623704" url="?curid=366038" title="Stride of an array">
<text>In computer programming, the stride of an array (also referred to as increment, pitch or step size) is the number of locations in memory between beginnings of successive array elements, measured in bytes or in units of the size of the array&#x27;s elements. The stride cannot be smaller than the element size but can be larger, indicating extra space between elements.

An array with stride of exactly the same size as the size of each of its elements is contiguous in memory. Such arrays are sometimes said to have unit stride. Unit stride arrays are sometimes more efficient than non-unit stride arrays, but non-unit stride arrays can be more efficient for 2D or multi-dimensional arrays, depending on the effects of caching and the access patterns used. This can be attributed to the principle of locality, specifically &quot;spatial locality&quot;.

==Reasons for non-unit stride==
Arrays may have a stride larger than their elements&#x27; width in bytes in at least two cases:

===Overlapping parallel arrays===
Some languages allow arrays of structures to be treated as overlapping parallel arrays with non-unit stride:
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

struct MyRecord {
 int value;
 char *text;

/** Print the contents of an array of ints with the given stride.
 Note that size_t is the correct type, as int can overflow. */
void print_some_ints(const int *arr, int length, size_t stride)
 int i;
 printf(&quot;Address\t\tValue\n&quot;);
 for (i=0; i &lt; length; ++i) {
 printf(&quot;%p\t%d\n&quot;, arr, arr[0]);
 arr = (int *)((unsigned char *)arr + stride);
}

int main(void)
 int ints[100] = {0};
 struct MyRecord records[100] = {0};

 print_some_ints(&amp;ints[0], 100, sizeof ints[0]);
 print_some_ints(&amp;records[0].value, 100, sizeof records[0]);
 return 0;


This idiom is a form of type punning.

===Array cross-section ===
Some languages like PL/I or Fortran allow what is known as an &quot;array cross-section&quot;, which selects certain columns or rows from a larger array. For example, if a two-dimensional array is declared as

declare some_array (12,2)fixed;

an array of one dimension consisting only of the second column may be referenced as

some_array(*,2)
===Example of multidimensional array with non-unit stride===
Non-unit stride is particularly useful for images. It allows for creating subimages without copying the pixel data. Java example:
public class GrayscaleImage {
 private final int width, height, widthStride;
 /** Pixel data. Pixel in single row are always considered contiguous in this example. */
 private final byte[] pixels;
 /** Offset of the first pixel within pixels */
 private final int offset;

 /** Constructor for contiguous data */
 public Image(int width, int height, byte[] pixels) {
 this.width = width;
 this.height = height;
 this.pixels = pixels;
 this.offset = 0;
 this.widthStride = width;

 /** Subsection constructor */
 public Image(int width, int height, byte[] pixels, int offset, int widthStride) {
 this.width = width;
 this.height = height;
 this.pixels = pixels;
 this.offset = offset;
 this.widthStride = widthStride;

 /** Returns a subregion of this Image as a new Image. This and the new image share
 the pixels, so changes to the returned image will be reflected in this image. */
 public Image crop(int x1, int y1, int x2, int y2) {
 return new Image(x2 - x1, y2 - y1, pixels, offset + y1 * widthStride + x1, widthStride);

 /** Returns pixel value at specified coordinate */
 public byte getPixelAt(int x, int y) {
 return pixels[offset + y * widthStride + x];
}

<text>Nuptse or Nubtse (Sherpa: नुबचे, Wylie: Nub rtse, ) is a mountain in the Khumbu region of the Mahalangur Himal, in the Nepalese Himalayas. It lies WSW of Mount Everest. The main peak, Nuptse I at an elevation of , was first climbed on May 16, 1961, by Dennis Davis and Sherpa Tashi. After a hiatus of almost 20 years, Nuptse again became the objective of mountaineers, with important routes being put up on its west, south, and north faces.

== Name ==
Nuptse is Tibetan for &quot;west peak&quot;, as it is the western segment of the Lhotse-Nuptse massif.

== Geography ==
Nuptse lies WSW of Mount Everest. It is a dramatic peak when viewed from the south or west, and it towers above the base camp for the standard south col route on Everest. However, it is not a particularly independent peak: its topographic prominence is only . Hence it is not ranked in the list of highest mountains.

The main Nuptse ridge contains 7 summits:


== Climbing ==
Nuptse was first climbed in 1961 and a few times thereafter.
* 1961 - First ascent of the North Ridge on May 16 by Dennis Davis and Sherpa Tashi as part of a British expedition led by Joe Walmsley. Tashi was the first human to set foot on the summit as Davis waited to take photos. Davis followed closely after Tashi. On May 17, other members of the same expedition reached the summit: Chris Bonington, Les Brown, James Swallow and Pemba Sherpa. 
* 1975 - The Joint British Army-Royal Nepalese Army Nuptse Expedition in an attempt to be the second team atop Nuptse ended in tragedy with the loss of four climbers to falls.
* 1979 - Ascent of the North Ridge on October 19 by Georges Bettembourg, Doug Scott, Alan Rouse and Brian Hall. 
* 1984 - First ascent of the West Ridge by Yvan Estienne, Rémi Roux, &quot;et al&quot;., an expedition led by Raymond Renaud. 
* 1994 - First ascent of the south pillar of Nuptse Shar I by Frenchmen Michel Fauquet and Vincent Fine, who were stopped by the wind on the summit ridge from the summit. The climb was nominated for a Piolets d&#x27;Or.
* 1997 - Nuptse - Nup II (7742 m) - on top: Tomaž Humar, Janez Jeglič
* 2008 - Opening of the south face by Stéphane Benoist and Patrice Glairon-Rappaz; nominated for the Piolets d&#x27;Or in 2008.
* 2017 - Frédéric Degoulet, Benjamin Guigonnet and Hélias Millerioux open a route on the south face.
* 2023 - On 8 May, a team of 3 climbers from the US and 6 Sherpas were the first to reach the summit in the year. It is reported that at least 65 climbers in 6 teams have obtained permits for Nuptse.

==In culture==
In 1987, Sally McCoy, Director of Equipment at The North Face, an American outdoor recreation products company, was part of the Snowbird Everest Expedition. This inspired The North Face to create outerwear named after peaks and glaciers of the region. In 1992, the company introduced the Nuptse Jacket. It featured a novel baffle construction to reduce shifting of the down and to increase warmth. The Nuptse jacket in bright colours was popular in New York City in the 1990s, especially among school kids and rappers. The Nuptse line of outdoors clothing has expanded to over 60 items in 2023.

<text>Claude Chevalley (; 11 February 1909 – 28 June 1984) was a French mathematician who made important contributions to number theory, algebraic geometry, class field theory, finite group theory and the theory of algebraic groups. He was a founding member of the Bourbaki group.

==Life==
His father, Abel Chevalley, was a French diplomat who, jointly with his wife Marguerite Chevalley née Sabatier, wrote &quot;The Concise Oxford French Dictionary&quot;. Chevalley graduated from the École Normale Supérieure in 1929, where he studied under Émile Picard. He then spent time at the University of Hamburg, studying under Emil Artin and at the University of Marburg, studying under Helmut Hasse. In Germany, Chevalley discovered Japanese mathematics in the person of Shokichi Iyanaga. Chevalley was awarded a doctorate in 1933 from the University of Paris for a thesis on class field theory.

When World War II broke out, Chevalley was at Princeton University. After reporting to the French Embassy, he stayed in the U.S., first at Princeton and then (after 1947) at Columbia University. His American students included Leon Ehrenpreis and Gerhard Hochschild. During his time in the U.S., Chevalley became an American citizen and wrote a substantial part of his lifetime&#x27;s output in English.

When Chevalley applied for a chair at the Sorbonne, the difficulties he encountered were the subject of a polemical piece by his friend and fellow &quot;Bourbakiste&quot; André Weil, titled &quot;Science Française?&quot; and published in the &quot;Nouvelle Revue Française&quot;. Chevalley was the &quot;professeur B&quot; of the piece, as confirmed in the endnote to the reprint in Weil&#x27;s collected works, &quot;Oeuvres Scientifiques, tome II&quot;. Chevalley eventually did obtain a position in 1957 at the faculty of sciences of the University of Paris and after 1970 at the Université de Paris VII.

Chevalley had artistic and political interests, and was a minor member of the French non-conformists of the 1930s. The following quote by the co-editor of Chevalley&#x27;s collected works attests to these interests:

&quot;Chevalley was a member of various avant-garde groups, both in politics and in the arts... Mathematics was the most important part of his life, but he did not draw any boundary between his mathematics and the rest of his life.&quot;
==Work==
In his PhD thesis, Chevalley made an important contribution to the technical development of class field theory, removing a use of L-functions and replacing it by an algebraic method. At that time use of group cohomology was implicit, cloaked by the language of central simple algebras. In the introduction to André Weil&#x27;s &quot;Basic Number Theory&quot;, Weil attributed the book&#x27;s adoption of that path to an unpublished manuscript by Chevalley.

Around 1950, Chevalley wrote a three-volume treatment of Lie groups. A few years later, he published the work for which he is best remembered, his investigation into what are now called Chevalley groups. Chevalley groups make up 9 of the 18 families of finite simple groups.

Chevalley&#x27;s accurate discussion of integrality conditions in the Lie algebras of semisimple groups enabled abstracting their theory from the real and complex fields. As a consequence, analogues over finite fields could be defined. This was an essential stage in the evolving classification of finite simple groups. After Chevalley&#x27;s work, the distinction between &quot;classical groups&quot; falling into the Dynkin diagram classification, and sporadic groups which did not, became sharp enough to be useful. What are called &#x27;twisted&#x27; groups of the classical families could be fitted into the picture.

&quot;Chevalley&#x27;s theorem&quot; (also called the Chevalley–Warning theorem) usually refers to his result on the solubility of equations over a finite field. Another theorem of his concerns the constructible sets in algebraic geometry, i.e. those in the Boolean algebra generated by the Zariski-open and Zariski-closed sets. It states that the image of such a set by a morphism of algebraic varieties is of the same type. Logicians call this an elimination of quantifiers.

In the 1950s, Chevalley led some Paris seminars of major importance: the &quot;Séminaire Cartan–Chevalley&quot; of the academic year 1955-6, with Henri Cartan and the &quot;Séminaire Chevalley&quot; of 1956-7 and 1957-8. These dealt with topics on algebraic groups and the foundations of algebraic geometry, as well as pure abstract algebra. The Cartan–Chevalley seminar was the genesis of scheme theory, but its subsequent development in the hands of Alexander Grothendieck was so rapid, thorough and inclusive that its historical tracks can appear well covered. Grothendieck&#x27;s work subsumed the more specialised contribution of Serre, Chevalley, Gorō Shimura and others such as Erich Kähler and Masayoshi Nagata.

<text>CBC News Network (formerly CBC Newsworld) is a Canadian English-language specialty news channel owned by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC). It is Canada&#x27;s first all-news channel, and the world&#x27;s third-oldest television service of this nature (after CNN in the United States, and Sky News in the United Kingdom.)

CBC News Network is funded by cable subscriber fees and commercial advertising, unlike the CBC&#x27;s main television network, and it cannot directly receive operational funds from the corporation&#x27;s public funding allotment. Nonetheless, the network benefits from synergies with other CBC services; such as the ability to share reporters and programs with the main network.

CBC News Network&#x27;s French-language counterpart is Ici RDI, also owned by the CBC (or, &quot;Société Radio-Canada&quot; in French).

==Revenue==

According to the 2014 &quot;Communications Monitoring Report&quot; by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC), CBC News Network in 2014 had 11.3 million subscribers and a revenue of $86.7 million.

==History==
With CNN and CNN International already being widely available in Canada during the 1980s and beyond, private and state-owned Canadian broadcasters began to apply for a licence for a similar 24-hour news service in Canada. In 1987, the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) awarded a licence to the CBC.

The launch of the CBC&#x27;s 24-hour news service was delayed several times: first when Allarcom, who had filed a competing application for an all-news channel, chose to appeal the CRTC decision; second, when the federal cabinet issued a directive to the CBC to revise its service plan for the network to include private commercial broadcasters and to launch a parallel French language service; and lastly, when cable companies were reluctant to add the service just five months after a similar launch of numerous other channels.

CBC Newsworld finally began broadcasting on 31 July 1989 from several regional studios in Halifax, Toronto, Winnipeg and Calgary, becoming Canada&#x27;s first all-news channel. (As of 2017, there are production studios in Vancouver, Toronto and Halifax.)

In the 1990s, the channel also aired repeats of CBC Television&#x27;s political sketch comedy series &quot;This Hour Has 22 Minutes&quot; and &quot;Royal Canadian Air Farce&quot;, but these were discontinued in 2001 after a CRTC directive that the shows did not qualify as news programming.

In 2000, because of a fee dispute between Persona (then known as Regional Cablesystems; later acquired by Eastlink) and the CBC, CBC News Network was dropped by a number of Persona-owned cable systems. Thereafter, while CBC News Network was sometimes thought to be a mandatory basic cable channel, these cable systems did not carry the channel at all during much of the 2000s.

===Newsworld International===

Some of CBC News Network&#x27;s programming also aired on the now-defunct Newsworld International, an American cable news network co-owned by the CBC and the Power Corporation of Canada. CBC Newsworld (as it was then known) produced some programming for Newsworld International, and scheduled programming from other news networks like Britain&#x27;s BBC World, which did not air on the Canadian channel.

Soon after, Newsworld International was sold to USA Networks in 2000, then to Vivendi Universal Entertainment in 2001, and then to Al Gore and Joel Hyatt in 2004. Newsworld continued to provide the network&#x27;s programming until Gore and Hyatt launched their own network, Current TV, on 1 August 2005. In 2013, the channel was sold again to the Al Jazeera Media Network and became Al Jazeera America on 20 August 2013.

===2009 re-launch===
In December 2008, it was reported that the CBC planned to revamp Newsworld in 2009, as the result of a strategic review and market survey. The CBC found that consumer awareness of CBC Newsworld was lower in comparison to other specialty channels, and there was a perception that the CBC broke stories too slowly. Tentative plans also called for the revamped channel to have more prominent displays of news headlines and weather reports.

On 21 October 2009, it was announced that CBC Newsworld would be renamed CBC News Network on October 26 as part of a larger re-launch of the CBC News division. A new lineup of programs was introduced to the network, with a greater emphasis towards live news coverage. New programs included &quot;CBC News Now&quot; (the channel&#x27;s rolling news coverage), &quot;Power &amp; Politics&quot;, &quot;The Lang and O&#x27;Leary Exchange&quot; (a business news program hosted by Amanda Lang and &quot;Dragons&#x27; Den&quot;-investor Kevin O&#x27;Leary), and &quot;Connect with Mark Kelley&quot;.

===CBC News Network HD===
In January 2009, the CBC launched an HD simulcast of CBC News Network (then CBC Newsworld) called CBC Newsworld HD. The channel was renamed CBC News Network HD on 26 October 2009 to coincide with the renaming of CBC Newsworld to CBC News Network. The HD feed has been confirmed at 720p resolution on Shaw Cable after it was added to the lineup in 2014. It is available through all major television providers in the country.

==Programming==
CBC News Network used to air a number of magazine-style programs, along with hourly news updates. The network has moved from that style of programming to focusing solely on live-news and documentary programs, including &quot;The Passionate Eye&quot; and &quot;Rough Cuts&quot;—both of which used to be hosted by Michaëlle Jean—and &quot;Politics&quot;—a political affairs program hosted by Don Newman that aired twice daily. &quot;The Hour&quot; with George Stroumboulopoulos was launched in 2005 in an attempt to attract younger viewers; similar news-oriented talk shows, such as &quot;Pamela Wallin Live&quot;, &quot;CounterSpin&quot;, &quot;Face Off&quot;, and &quot;Benmergui Live&quot;, also aired on the network in the 1990s.

The network&#x27;s daytime schedule consists of live rolling news coverage, branded as CBC Newsroom (formerly known as &quot;CBC News Now&quot;), which airs weekdays from 10:00a.m. to 4:00p.m. ET, Saturdays from 6:00a.m. to 5:30p.m. ET, and Sundays from 6:00a.m. to 4:00p.m. ET (with a two-hour break from 10:00a.m. to 12:00p.m. ET). Instead of producing a separate noon-hour program, most CBC Television stations simulcast CBC News Network from 12:00 to 1:00pm local time, with an &quot;L-bar&quot; showing local news and weather headlines.

&quot;Power &amp; Politics&quot; airs live from 5:00 to 7:00p.m. ET. From 7:00 to 9:00p.m. on weekdays, CBC News Network airs Canada Tonight.

Beginning with the Atlantic Time Zone airing at 9:00p.m. ET, &quot;The National&quot;—CBC News&#x27; flagship nightly newscast—runs live until 2:00a.m. ET and then on a loop until 6:00 a.m. ET the following morning.

Other original programming that appear on CBC News Network includes:

* &quot;Marketplace&quot; — Canadian consumer watchdog series
* &quot;The Fifth Estate&quot; — investigative documentary newsmagazine series
* &quot;The Passionate Eye&quot; — documentary television series
* &quot;Rosemary Barton Live&quot; — live weekly program on political news and issues, hosted by CBC&#x27;s chief political correspondent Rosemary Barton.
* &quot;The Investigators&quot; — hosted by Diana Swain

Since 2021, the channel has also simulcast CBC Radio One&#x27;s news phone-in show &quot;Cross Country Checkup&quot; on Sunday afternoons.

In 2023, CBC announced several programming changes, including news hosts, for both weekday and weekend programs. Among the changes was an official name change to daytime and weekend rolling news programming to ‘CBC Newsroom’. ‘CBC Rundown with Andrew Nichols’ was also ended, in favour of an expanded two-hour &quot;Canada Tonight&quot;.

In February 2025, the network announced that &quot;Canada Tonight&quot; will be replaced with a new two-hour show, &quot;Hanomansing Tonight&quot;, hosted by Ian Hanomansing.

<doc id="366059" wikidata="Q912124" url="?curid=366059" title="Jidai Matsuri">
<text>The is a traditional Japanese festival (also called matsuri) held annually on October 22 in Kyoto, Japan. It is one of Kyoto&#x27;s three major festivals, with the other two being the &quot;Aoi Matsuri&quot;, held annually on May 15, and the &quot;Gion Matsuri&quot;, which is held annually from 17 to July 24. It is a festival enjoyed by people of all ages, participating in its historical reenactment parade dressed in authentic costumes representing various periods, and characters in Japanese feudal history.

The Jidai Matsuri traces its roots to the relocation of the Japanese capital from Kyoto to Tokyo during the Meiji Restoration in 1868. This involved the relocation of the Emperor of Japan and the Imperial family, the Imperial Palace, and thousands of government officials and subjects to the new city. Fearing for Kyoto&#x27;s loss of glory and interest from her people, and to commemorate its history, the city government and the Kyoto prefectural government commemorated the 1100th anniversary of the founding of Heian-kyō (平安京), which was the former name of Kyoto, in 794 by (737–806). To inaugurate the first Jidai celebration in 1895, the city government built the to enshrine the spirit of Emperor Kanmu. To add meaning to the festival, it staged a costume procession representing people of each era in Kyoto history. In 1940, the local government decided that on top of honouring Emperor Kanmu, the Jidai festival was also to be held in honour of (July 22, 1831 – January 30, 1867) for his work in unifying the country, the power of the imperial court and the affirmation of Kyoto as the center of Japan at the decline of the Tokugawa shogunate and the end of the Edo period.

The Jidai Matsuri begins in early morning with the mikoshi (portable shrines) brought out of the Kyoto Imperial Palace so that people may pay their respects. The mikoshi represents both Emperor Kanmu and Emperor Kōmei. The five-hour, two-kilometer costume procession begins in the afternoon, with approximately 2,000 performers dressed as samurai, military figures, and common people, from the earliest eras to the Meiji era. These are followed by Japanese women who are dressed in elaborate . Finally, the mikoshi are carried from the palace and are accompanied by a costumed military band that plays the gagaku. The procession ends at the Heian Shrine.

The Jidai Matsuri in 2019 was rescheduled to 26 October due to the Enthronement ceremony of Emperor Naruhito.

<doc id="366061" wikidata="Q692398" url="?curid=366061" title="Bojinka plot">
<text>The Bojinka plot (; ) was a large-scale, three-phase terrorist attack planned by Ramzi Yousef and Khalid Sheikh Mohammed for January 1995. They planned to assassinate Pope John Paul II; blow up 11 airliners in flight from Asia to the United States, with the goal of killing approximately 4,000 passengers and shutting down air travel around the world; and crash a plane into the headquarters of the United States Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) in Langley, Virginia.

Despite careful planning, the Bojinka plot was disrupted after a chemical fire drew the attention of the Philippine National Police – Western Police District (PNP-WPD, now known as Manila Police District PNP-MPD) on January 6–7, 1995. Yousef and Mohammed were unable to stage any of the three attacks. The only fatality resulted from a test bomb planted by Yousef on Philippine Airlines Flight 434, which killed one person and injured 10 others. They also planted two other bombs in a shopping mall and theater in the southern Philippines. Elements of the Bojinka plot (including the plan to crash a plane into the CIA headquarters) would be used in the September 11 attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, six years later.

==Terminology and etymology==
The plot is also known as Oplan Bojinka, Operation Bojinka, Project Bojinka, and Bojinga. FBI officials described Operation Bojinka as &quot;48 hours of terror&quot;.

Several news media outlets, including &quot;Time Asia&quot;, incorrectly stated that the word &quot;Bojinka&quot; means &quot;loud bang&quot; or &quot;explosion&quot; in the Serbo-Croatian language. Endnote 7 of Chapter 5 of the &quot;9/11 Commission Report&quot; states that Khalid Sheikh Mohammed says &quot;bojinka is not Serbo-Croatian for &#x27;big bang&#x27;&quot;, as has been widely reported, but rather a nonsense word he adopted after hearing it on the front lines in Afghanistan.&quot;

==Financing==
Funding for the Bojinka plot came from Osama bin Laden, Hambali, and from front organizations operated by Mohammed Jamal Khalifa (bin Laden&#x27;s brother-in-law).

Wali Khan Amin Shah was the financier of the plot. He funded the plot by laundering money through his girlfriend and other Manila women, several of whom were bar hostesses and one of whom was an employee at a KFC restaurant. They were bribed with gifts and holiday trips so that they would open bank accounts to stash funds.

The transfers were small, equivalent to about 12,000 to 24,000 Philippine pesos ($500 to $1,000 US), and would be handed over each night at a Wendy&#x27;s or a karaoke bar. The funds went to &quot;Adam Sali&quot;, an alias used by Ramzi Yousef. The money came through a Filipino bank account owned by Jordanian Omar Abu Omar, who worked at International Relations and Information Centre, an Islamic organization run by Mohammed Jamal Khalifa.

A company called Konsojaya also provided financial assistance to the Manila cell by laundering money to it. Konsojaya was a front company that was started by the head of the group Jemaah Islamiyah, an Indonesian named Riduan Isamuddin, also known as Hambali. Wali Khan Amin Shah was on the board of directors of the company.

==Planning==
As soon as Yousef arrived in Manila, along with other &quot;Arab Afghans&quot; who were creating cells in Manila, he began work making bombs. Yousef had shown up in Singapore with Shah earlier in the autumn of 1994. The two got their Philippine visas in Singapore.

He left Manila for several days, but was met by Islamist emissaries upon his return to Metro Manila. They asked him to attack United States President Bill Clinton, who was due to arrive in the Philippines on November 12, 1994, as part of a five-day tour of Asia. Although Yousef thought of several ways to kill the president, including placing nuclear bombs on Clinton&#x27;s motorcade route, firing a Stinger missile at Air Force One or the presidential limousine, launching theater ballistic missiles at Manila, and killing him with phosgene, a chemical weapon, he decided against this, reasoning the plan to be too difficult. However, he incorporated his plan to kill the then-incumbent Pope John Paul II into the Bojinka plot.

In 1994, Yousef and Khalid Sheik Mohammed started testing airport security. Yousef booked a flight between Kai Tak International Airport in Hong Kong and Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport near Taipei. Mohammed booked a flight between Ninoy Aquino International Airport near Manila and Kimpo International Airport near Seoul. The two had already converted 14 bottles of contact lens solution into bottles containing nitroglycerin, which was readily available in the Philippines. Yousef had taped a metal rod to the arch of his foot, which would serve as a detonator. The two wore jewelry and clothing with metal to confuse airport security. To support their claim that they were meeting women, they packed condoms in their bags.

On December 8, Yousef moved into the Doña Josefa Apartments (later known simply as the Josefa Apartments and eventually converted to a hotel in 2019 under the name &quot;Mannra Hotel&quot;) in the Malate district under the alias &quot;Najy Awaita Haddad&quot;, using a fake Moroccan identity. He booked Unit 603 in advance with a ₱80,000 deposit and an additional ₱40,000. Mohammed purported himself to be a Saudi or Qatari plywood exporter named &quot;Abdul Majid&quot;. Upon settling in the unit, both men had already started planning Operation Bojinka.

Edith Guerrera, the manager, jokingly claimed with the receptionist after the two men asked for new registration forms, claiming that &quot;they have forgotten their names&quot;, adding that the first ones were torn up, but nevertheless gave in to their requests. Unknown to them, Yousef had accidentally put his actual name on the first form.

The apartment was chosen because of its location; it was away from the Apostolic Nunciature, the Holy See&#x27;s diplomatic mission in the Philippines, and down the street from Manila Police Station No. 9 on Quirino Avenue. One of the windows of the unit looks down on the path that the Papal motorcade was to take. A conspirator named Abdul Hakim Murad went to Manila with Yousef and stayed at the same apartment.

People were suspicious of the men in Unit 603, who were described as being very secretive. According to Guerrera, the men gave the impression that they were in the Philippines to study, adding that &quot;They looked like students&quot;. She also revealed that they double-locked the door when they were inside or out, and never asked for a cleaning crew to clear up the room, also adding that they &quot;had chemical burns on their hands&quot;, carried boxes, and never hired other people to help them. Also unknown to them, the boxes contained chemicals bought from suppliers in Manila and Quezon City in Metro Manila, which Yousef used to make his bombs.

According to Abdul Hakim Murad, he gave Yousef an idea for crashing a plane into the CIA&#x27;s headquarters; Yousef took this suggestion but did not draft plots for it at the moment, before heading off with Mohammed to Puerto Galera for scuba diving.

==Test bombs: mall, theater, 747 airliner==

Yousef&#x27;s first operational test of his bomb was inside a mall in Cebu City. The bomb detonated several hours after he put it in a generator room. It caused minor damage, but it proved to Yousef that his bomb was workable. On December 1, 1994, Yousef placed a bomb under a seat in the Greenbelt Theatre in Manila to test what would happen if a bomb exploded under an airline seat. The bomb went off, injuring several patrons.

Following this incident, Yousef booked the Manila-Cebu leg of the Narita-bound Philippine Airlines Flight 434 under the alias Armaldo Forlani, using a forged Italian passport. During this leg, he built another bomb, which had one-tenth of the power that his final bombs were planned to have, in the lavatory of the aircraft, setting the timer for four hours. Yousef planted the bomb inside the life jacket pouch of seat 26K, which he moved into after takeoff, and disembarked in Cebu. 

The bomb exploded while the aircraft was over Japan&#x27;s Minamidaitō Island, part of Okinawa Prefecture, killing Haruki Ikegami, a Japanese businessman occupying the seat; an additional 10 passengers were injured. The flight was carrying 273 passengers in total. The blast blew a hole in the floor and the cabin&#x27;s rapid expansion severed several control cables in the ceiling, cutting off control of the plane&#x27;s right aileron, as well as both the captain and first officer&#x27;s steering controls. Usually, 26K, the seat that Yousef chose to plant the bomb, would be positioned directly over the centre fuel tank, and the detonation of the bomb would have caused a crippling explosion, but on this particular airframe, a former Scandinavian Airlines aircraft, the seat was two rows forward from normal. The flight crew kept control of the Boeing 747-200 and brought it into an emergency landing at Okinawa&#x27;s Naha Airport. Satisfied with the deadly results of the attack, Yousef then planned which flights to attack for &quot;Phase II&quot; of the plot.

==Phase I: Pope assassination plot==

The first plan was to assassinate Pope John Paul II when he visited the Philippines during the World Youth Day 1995 celebrations. On January 15, 1995, a suicide bomber would dress up as a priest, while John Paul II passed in his motorcade on his way to the San Carlos Seminary in Makati. The assassin planned to get close to the Pope and detonate the bomb. The planned assassination of the Pope was intended to divert attention from the next phase of the operation. About 20 men had been trained by Yousef to carry out this act prior to January 1995.

The details of Phase I were found in the evidence discovered in the investigation into Unit 603 in the Doña Josefa.

==Phase II: Airline bombing plot==
The next plan would have involved at least five terrorists, including Yousef, Shah, Murad, and two more unknown operatives. Beginning on January 21, 1995, and ending on January 22, 1995, they would have placed bombs on 11 United States-bound airliners which had stopovers scattered throughout East Asia and Southeast Asia. All of the flights had two legs, wherein the bombs would be planted inside life jackets under seats on the first leg, and each bomber would then disembark. He would then board one or two more flights and repeat. After all of the bombers had planted bombs on all of the flights, each man would then catch flights to Lahore, Pakistan. The attackers never needed U.S. visas, as they only would have been on the planes for their first legs within Asia.

American airlines had been chosen instead of Asian airlines to maximize the shock toward Americans. The flights targeted were listed under operatives with codenames: &quot;Zyed&quot;, &quot;Majbos&quot;, &quot;Markoa&quot;, &quot;Mirqas&quot; and &quot;Obaid&quot;. The explosions were to be timed by the operatives before they disembarked from the plane. The aircraft would have exploded over the Pacific Ocean and the South China Sea almost simultaneously. If this plan worked, several thousand passengers would have perished, and air travel would likely have been shut down worldwide. The U.S. government estimated the prospective death toll to be about 4,000 if the plot had been executed. (For comparison, about 3,000 were killed during the September 11 attacks in the United States.)

===Bomb===

The &quot;Mark II microbombs&quot; had Casio digital watches as the timers, stabilizers that looked like cotton wool balls, and an undetectable quantity of nitroglycerin as the explosive. Other ingredients included glycerin, nitrate, sulfuric acid, and minute concentrations of nitrobenzene, silver azide (silver trinitride), and liquid acetone. Two 9-volt batteries in each bomb were used as a power source. The batteries would be connected to light bulb filaments that would detonate the bomb. Murad and Yousef wired an SCR (silicon controlled rectifier) as the switch to trigger the filaments to detonate the bomb. There was an external socket hidden when the wires were pushed under the watch base as the bomber would wear it. The alteration was so small that the watch could still be worn in a normal manner.

Yousef got batteries past airport security during his December 11 test bombing of Philippine Airlines Flight 434 by hiding them in hollowed-out heels of his shoes. Yousef smuggled the nitroglycerin on board by putting it inside a small container, reputedly containing contact lens cleaning solution.

===Airports planned to be targeted===
====Asia====

* Kai Tak Airport in British Hong Kong
* Narita International Airport in Tokyo, Japan
* Ninoy Aquino International Airport in Manila, Philippines
* Chiang Kai-shek (Taoyuan) International Airport in Taipei, Taiwan
* Singapore Changi Airport in Singapore
* Gimpo International Airport in Seoul, South Korea
* Bangkok (Don Mueang) International Airport in Bangkok, Thailand

====United States====

* Honolulu International Airport, Honolulu, Hawaii
* John F. Kennedy International Airport, New York City, New York
* Los Angeles International Airport, Los Angeles
* Chicago O&#x27;Hare International Airport, Chicago, Illinois
* San Francisco International Airport, San Francisco

===Targeted flights===

* &quot;Zyed&quot; was to attack a Northwest Airlines Manila-Seoul-Los Angeles flight, then a United Airlines Seoul-Taipei-Honolulu flight, and then a United Taipei-Bangkok-San Francisco flight. Zyed would then flee to Karachi, Pakistan after disembarking in Bangkok.
* &quot;Majbos&quot; was to attack a United Airlines Taipei-Tokyo-Los Angeles flight, with him disembarking in Tokyo, and then proceed to a United Tokyo-Hong Kong-New York flight. After disembarking in Hong Kong, he would have fled to Karachi, Pakistan.
* &quot;Maroka&quot; was to attack a Northwest Airlines Manila-Tokyo-Chicago flight, with him disembarking in Tokyo, and then proceed to a Northwest Tokyo-Hong Kong-New York flight. After disembarking in Hong Kong he would have escaped to Karachi.
* &quot;Mirqas&quot; was to attack a United Airlines Manila-Seoul-San Francisco flight, with him disembarking in Seoul, and then proceed to a Delta Air Lines Seoul-Taipei-Bangkok flight. After disembarking in Taipei he would have escaped to Karachi.
* &quot;Obaida&quot; was to attack a United Airlines Singapore-Hong Kong-Los Angeles flight and a United Airlines Los Angeles-Hong Kong-Singapore flight which would become a Singapore-Hong Kong-San Francisco flight. After arriving in Singapore, Obaida was to flee to Pakistan.

==Phase III: CIA plane crash plot==

Abdul Hakim Murad&#x27;s confession detailed Phase III in his interrogation by the Manila police after his capture.

Phase III would have involved Murad either renting, buying, or hijacking a small airplane, preferably a Cessna. The airplane would be filled with explosives. He would then crash it into the Central Intelligence Agency headquarters in the Langley area in Fairfax County, Virginia. Murad had been trained as a pilot in North Carolina, and was slated to be a suicide pilot.

There were alternate plans to hijack a 12th commercial airliner and use that instead of the small aircraft, probably due to the Manila cell&#x27;s growing frustration with explosives, as they knew testing them in a house or apartment was dangerous, and could easily give away the terrorist plot. Khalid Sheikh Mohammed likely made the alternate plan.

A report from the Philippines to the United States on January 20, 1995, stated, &quot;What the subject has in his mind is that he will board any American commercial aircraft pretending to be an ordinary passenger. Then he will hijack said aircraft, control its cockpit and dive it at the CIA headquarters.&quot;

Another plot that was considered would have involved the hijacking of more airplanes. The World Trade Center (New York City, New York), The Pentagon (Arlington, Virginia), the United States Capitol (Washington, D.C.), the White House (Washington, D.C.), the Sears Tower (Chicago, Illinois), the U.S. Bank Tower (Los Angeles, California) and the Transamerica Pyramid (San Francisco, California) would have been the likely targets. In his confession to Filipino investigators, prior to the foiling of Operation Bojinka, Abdul Hakim Murad said that this part of the plot was dropped since the Manila cell could not recruit enough people to implement other hijackings. This plot would eventually be the base plot for the September 11 attacks which involved hijacking commercial airliners as opposed to small aircraft loaded with explosives and crashing them into their intended targets. However, only the World Trade Center (which was destroyed) and The Pentagon (which suffered partial damage) were hit. The original plan for the September 11 attacks was to hijack ten airplanes, with one of them confirmed to have been planned to crash into the U.S Bank Tower in Los Angeles. Additionally, the United States Capitol and the White House were the potential targets of United Airlines Flight 93 but were never hit due to passengers revolting against the hijackers, which caused the hijacked plane to crash into a field near Shanksville, Pennsylvania.

==Discovery and termination==

The plot was abandoned after an apartment fire at the six-story Doña Josefa apartments occurred in Manila, Philippines, on the evening of Friday, January 6, 1995. The fire occurred before Pope John Paul II was scheduled to visit the Philippines on January 12.

According to the initial accounts of the Philippine authorities, Abdul Hakim Murad started a chemical fire in the kitchen sink in Room 603 on the sixth floor of the Doña Josefa apartment by pouring water on a substance. The fire was spotted at about 11:00p.m. after residents complained about a strange odour. Edith Guerrera, the owner of the apartments, called the fire brigade, but the fire went out unassisted. Yousef and Murad had told the firefighters to stay away before they fled. Police Major Francisco F. Bautista and his staff, including watch commander Aida D. Fariscal, decided to investigate the situation and saw four hot plates in their packing crates, what looked like cotton batting soaked in a beige solution, and loops of green, red, blue, and yellow electrical wiring. The telephone rang, and the police ran downstairs, thinking that it was a trap. Fariscal had been suspicious of the men in Room 603 due to the recent wave of bombings (committed by Yousef) that hit Metro Manila and Philippine Airlines Flight 434. Seeking a search warrant, they left and asked 11 judges before finding one that would grant a warrant.

A 2002 &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; article stated that the police deliberately set a fire to rouse the men out of their apartment.

After police discovered the evidence, they arrested a man who called himself &quot;Ahmed Saeed&quot;. &quot;Saeed&quot;, who later proved to be Murad, claimed that he was a commercial pilot who was on his way to the precinct house to explain that what he claimed to be firecrackers had gone off. Murad initially tried to run away, but he was arrested after he tripped over a tree root. The arresting officer, having lost his handcuffs, improvised a solution by tying Murad&#x27;s hands with the elastic cord taken from the officer&#x27;s raincoat. Murad was hauled to the precinct in a taxi van with the help of two other people. He offered 110,740 Philippine pesos (US$2,000) to the policemen if they would agree to let him go, but the officers refused. At the precinct, Murad signed a statement saying that he was innocent and that he was a tourist visiting his friend in his chemical import/export business. He then mumbled about &quot;two Satans that must be destroyed: the Pope and America.&quot;

Fariscal was later depicted in the 2006 docudrama &quot;The Path to 9/11&quot;, in which US agencies in the script gave her much credit. An actress portrays her in the &quot;Mayday&quot; episode &quot;Bomb on Board&quot;. The widow of a slain police officer, she had spent 17 years as a homemaker before enrolling in the police department in 1977. She became well known in her home nation, which awarded her the equivalent of 33,222 pesos ($700) and a trip to Taiwan. The CIA awarded her a certificate reading &quot;in recognition of your personal outstanding efforts and co-operation.&quot; Her decision to investigate the fire was key to disrupting the plot and forcing Yousef to flee.

==Evidence in Room 603==
When the officers returned to Suite 603 at 2:30a.m. on January 7, they found street maps of Manila with routes plotting the papal motorcade, a rosary, a photograph of the pontiff, bibles, crucifixes, papal confessions, and priest clothing, including robes and collars. This collection of objects, and a phone message from a tailor reminding the occupant that &quot;the cassock was ready to be tried on&quot;, along with the fact of the Pope&#x27;s impending visit, was enough for Police Major Francisco F. Bautista to infer that an assassination plot had been interrupted. A search warrant was granted by 4:00a.m. on January 7.

More chemicals, such as gallons of sulfuric acid, picric acid, nitric acid, glycerin, acetone, sodium chlorate, nitrobenzoyl, ammonia, silver nitrate, methanamine, and ANFO were found. Several cans of gasoline and two large Welch&#x27;s grape juice bottles containing nitroglycerin were found. Equipment such as thermometers, graduated cylinders, large cooking kettles, funnels, fuses, filters, soldering irons, beakers, mortars, pestles, different electronic fusing systems, timers, switches, and circuit breakers were found. Also discovered in the search was a finished remote-controlled brass pipe bomb, as well as another pipe bomb that was about to be packed. The apartment also contained a chemistry textbook and chemical dictionary, a &quot;Time&quot; magazine with the cover story on international terrorism, as well as a pharmacy receipt and bottle of contact lens solution. In a cupboard under the sink, a finished time bomb and other Casio watches were found.

The most conclusive piece of evidence found was a manual written in Arabic on how to build a liquid bomb.

Stacks of 12 false passports, including Norwegian, Afghan, Saudi, and Pakistani were also found in the apartment. Investigators found a business card from Mohammed Jamal Khalifa; Saeed apparently possessed five telephone numbers from Khalifa. Investigators also found phone numbers for Rose Masquera, Mohammed&#x27;s girlfriend.

===Yousef&#x27;s computer===

Yousef&#x27;s project was discovered on four floppy disks and an off-white Toshiba laptop inside his apartment, two weeks before the plot would have been implemented. Several encrypted files on the hard drive contained flight schedules, calculations of detonation times, and other items.
The first string of text in one of the files states, &quot;All people who support the U.S. government are our targets in our future plans and that is because all those people are responsible for their government&#x27;s actions and they support the U.S. foreign policy and are satisfied with it. We will hit all U.S. nuclear targets. If the U.S. government keeps supporting Israel, then we will continue to carry out operations inside and outside the United States to include ...&quot; which is where the text ended.

A file named &quot;Bojinka&quot; lists the 11 flights between Asia and the United States, which were grouped under five codenames. Strings were found, such as &quot;codice_1&quot; (for United flight 80), and &quot;codice_2&quot; (for Northwest Flight 30).

The laptop had names of dozens of associates, including some photographs of a few of them and including contact information for Mohammed Jamal Khalifa. They contained records of information about five-star hotels, dealings with a London trading corporation, a meat market owner in Malaysia, and an Islamic center in Tucson, Arizona. Information about how money moved through an Abu Dhabi banking firm was found.

A communication signed &quot;Khalid Shaikh + Bojinka&quot; was also found on Yousef&#x27;s computer that threatened to attack targets &quot;in response to the financial, political and military assistance given to the Jewish state in the occupied land of Palestine by the United States Government.&quot; The letter also said that the bombers claimed to have the &quot;ability to make and use chemicals and poisonous gas ... for use against vital institutions and populations and the sources of drinking water.&quot;

The letter also threatened to assassinate Fidel V. Ramos, then-President of the Philippines, as well as attack aircraft if the United States did not meet the group&#x27;s demands. The letter said that the group claiming responsibility was the &quot;Fifth Division of the Liberation Army&quot;.

The evidence found at the Doña Josefa filled three police vans.

==Murad&#x27;s confession==

Sometime after police arrested Saeed, he had called Ramzi Yousef&#x27;s cellular phone.

Saeed turned out to be Abdul Hakim Murad, who was sent to the apartment to retrieve the computer after the fire. Murad was sent to Camp Crame, the headquarters of the Philippine National Police. Murad at first taunted investigators. For 67 days, he endured &quot;tactical interrogation&quot; by Filipino investigators.

According to journalists Marites Dañguilan Vitug and Glenda M. Gloria, authors of the book &quot;Under the Crescent Moon: Rebellion in Mindanao&quot;, agents hit Murad with a chair and club of wood when he did not talk. They forced water into his mouth, and crushed out lit cigarettes on his genitals. Murad&#x27;s ribs were completely cracked. Agents were surprised that he survived. According to an investigator, he finally confessed out of fear of Jews after an agent masquerading as a member of the Mossad told him that he was being sent to Israel.

Murad admitted in his interrogations, &quot;This is my — the best thing. I enjoy it&quot;, and &quot;because the United States is the first country in this world making trouble for us, for Muslims and for our people.&quot;

He talked about the bombs. &quot;Nobody [would] think that it&#x27;s [an] explosive&quot;, he said, referring to the watches Ramzi Yousef planned to put on the airliners. He said that the nitroglycerin &quot;which even if you&#x27;ll put in the X-ray, you will never, nobody can&quot; detect it.

Murad confessed that he was on a quest to be a martyr. He confessed to being the hijacker as part of Phase II of his plan. Murad was extradited to the United States on April 12, 1995. His testimony helped convict Yousef.

==Manhunt==
Wali Khan Amin Shah was arrested at an apartment complex on January 11 after police saw that a pager called by Yousef was registered in the name of Shah&#x27;s girlfriend. Shah escaped from custody about 77 hours later. Shah was found to be a conspirator after authorities saw photos of him scanned on the laptop that contained information about the plot, as well as cell phone numbers that led investigators to the apartment. Yousef and Khalid Sheikh Mohammed were able to escape from the Philippines to Pakistan. On January 31, 1995, Yousef flew from Pakistan to Thailand in an attempt to place suitcase bombs on a Delta Airlines and United Airlines aircraft. When that failed, he flew back to Pakistan.

After receiving Murad&#x27;s phone call, Yousef made plans to leave and flew to Singapore about five hours after Murad&#x27;s arrest. One day after Bojinka was discovered, Yousef made his way to Pakistan. Mohammed went to Pakistan days or weeks afterwards.

The Philippines forwarded details on the Bojinka plot to the United States in April 1995. Konsojaya was heard via wiretaps to be frequently in contact with Mohammed Jamal Khalifa&#x27;s charitable organization until the plot was discovered.

Yousef was arrested in the Su-Casa guest house in Islamabad, Pakistan on February 7, 1995, after a 23-day manhunt. Yousef later boasted to Secret Service agent Brian Parr about his plan. Wali Khan Amin Shah, the financier, was picked up in Malaysia in December 1995. His identity was revealed after he was fingerprinted. Shah was also extradited to the United States.

All three conspirators received life sentences for participating in the plot. Yousef also received a 240 year sentence along with his life sentence for the 1993 World Trade Center bombing. Yousef was sentenced on January 8, 1998, and Murad was sentenced on May 16, 1998. Shah has been cooperating with the government since August 1998.

Mohammed Jamal Khalifa, a Saudi businessman from Jeddah who was married to one of Osama bin Laden&#x27;s sisters, was in the Philippines earlier in 1994. He was arrested in 1994 in Mountain View, California, for conspiring in the 1993 World Trade Center bombing. He was financing the Bojinka plot, according to the content that the Filipino investigators forwarded to the United States. The United States Immigration and Naturalization Service deported Khalifa to Jordan in May 1995. He was acquitted by the Jordanian court and moved to Saudi Arabia. He was murdered in his hotel room in January 2007 in Madagascar.

==Aftermath==
U.S. investigators did not find the connection with Khalid Sheikh Mohammed to al-Qaeda until several years later.

Khalid Sheikh Mohammed decided that explosives were too risky to use in his next plot, and chose instead to use airplanes. The plot was later revised and executed during the September 11 attacks. Khalid Sheikh Mohammed was arrested in Rawalpindi, Pakistan in 2003.

Yousef filed a motion for a new trial in 2001. The United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit heard the case on May 3, 2002, and announced on April 3, 2003 the decision that Yousef and his partners were to remain incarcerated.

Bojinka was included in a number of 9/11 documentaries and mini-series, including &quot;The Path to 9/11&quot;, and &quot;The Secret History of 9/11&quot;.

<text>CKVR-DT (channel 3) is a television station in Barrie, Ontario, Canada, serving as the flagship station of the CTV 2 system. It is owned and operated by Bell Media alongside Toronto-based CTV flagship CFTO-DT, channel 9 (although the two stations maintain separate operations); it is also sister to 24-hour regional news channel CP24. CKVR-DT&#x27;s studios and transmitter are co-located at 33 Beacon Road in Barrie.

The station was founded by Ralph Snelgrove on September 28, 1955 and was the smallest community in North America to have its own television station. CKVR was a longtime CBC affiliate, having been so for forty years from its inception. CHUM Limited acquired the station in 1969, becoming one of the first privately owned stations by the company. The station ended its affiliation with the CBC in 1995 and the station was rebranded as &quot;The New VR&quot;. During its short time as an independent station, CKVR&#x27;s heavy intense news and other locally produced programming were modeled after its longstanding Citytv station in Toronto. CHUM later used CKVR-TV as the basis and flagship station of a television system, acquiring and establishing new stations under the NewNet name, which became more conventional after CHUM acquired the assets of Craig Media in 2004 while CKVR and the rest of the NewNet system was relaunched as A-Channel in 2005.

In July 2006, CTVglobemedia (then known as Bell Globemedia) announced its intent to acquire CHUM Limited, but was required to divest the Citytv stations due to conflicts with CTV stations it already owned in the same markets. CTV chose to keep the A-Channel stations including CKVR, as well as CKVR-TV&#x27;s sister news channel CP24 and its other cable channels MuchMusic, but divested CITY-TV and its sister stations to Rogers Media. CKVR was rebranded thrice to A in 2008, followed by CTV Two in 2011 and again as CTV 2 in 2018 and since its eventual acquisition by Bell, CKVR&#x27;s programming became more conventional in nature.

==CBC Television affiliate==
===Early history===
Ralph Snelgrove, the owner of CKBB (now known as CIQB-FM) was awarded a television license in 1954 by the CBC Board of Governors to operate in Barrie. The station first signed on the air on September 28, 1955, and the callsign was derived from Snelgrove whose first initial and that of his wife, Valerie, form part of the station&#x27;s callsign though it was originally to be called CKBB-TV after a radio station. It originally operated as a privately owned affiliate of CBC Television. 

In 1969, the station was purchased by CHUM Limited, becoming one of the first television stations owned by the company.

On September 7, 1977, a private aircraft, owned by Falconbridge Nickel Mines Ltd., dropped altitude to in dense fog and struck CKVR&#x27;s transmitter tower, killing all five people aboard the plane and destroying the tower and antenna. The station&#x27;s auxiliary tower was also destroyed and there was some damage to the main studio building. The tower also supported the antennae for CHAY-FM (93.1 FM) and a rebroadcaster (on UHF channel 55) of Radio-Canada station CBLFT (channel 25) in Toronto, the studio/transmitter link of CKBB (950 AM, now on 101.1 FM), as well as paging and other communications systems. The CKVR antenna was an RCA six-bay turnstile. On the following morning, the CBC secured the use of a tower for CKVR. The first sections of the new temporary tower were lifted into place on September 10. On September 19, CKVR&#x27;s antenna was hoisted into place on the new tower, along with those for CBLFT and CHAY-FM, with the transmission line also being put in place. After work on the tower was completed, tests were made to the transmitter&#x27;s signal. At 8:35 p.m. that evening, the transmitter was turned on with a colour bar test pattern being broadcast. At 8:55 p.m., CKVR vice president and general manager Jack Mattenley went on the air in a live broadcast with a message of sympathy and words of gratitude to viewers. CKVR returned to the air at a reduced power of 40,000 watts until a new tower was built in 1978.

===1985 Barrie tornado===

On May 31, 1985, an F4 tornado, one of the most powerful and devastating tornadoes in Canadian history, struck Barrie, just a short distance from CKVR&#x27;s studio facility and transmitter tower (the twister was among several other ones that were spawned during a massive tornado outbreak that affected parts of Eastern Canada and the Eastern United States), killing 12 people, injuring 600 people and destroying many homes and businesses in Barrie. CKVR broadcast extensive coverage of the storm&#x27;s aftermath for several days, and spent that summer helping the people of Barrie recover and rebuild. The station also held a day-long telethon in June of that year to raise funds for the tornado victims.

===Programming changes===
Once the CN Tower in Toronto was completed in 1976, atop which CBC flagship CBLT (channel 5) transmits from, the signal coverage areas of CKVR and CBLT overlapped considerably. CKVR management began to consider a different course for the station that took several years to become realized. By the late 1980s, programming outside of CBC and local news was mostly classic reruns such as &quot;I Love Lucy&quot;, &quot;Star Trek&quot;, &quot;The Addams Family&quot; and others, to the point where the station was often branded as &quot;CKVR Classic Television&quot;. Thanks to the acquisition of Toronto&#x27;s CITY-TV by CHUM in 1979, CKVR was (technically) part of a twinstick, and Citytv programming began to air in limited timeslots.

==The New VR and A-Channel==

Eventually, the station&#x27;s financial situation became untenable; then-general manager Doug Garraway explained in a presentation to the CRTC in spring 1994, &quot;the CBC no longer wants us, in point of fact we can no longer afford to remain affiliated with them.&quot; CKVR was expected to have lost $5 million by the end of 1995. As a result, the station made the decision to drop CBC programming and go in a new direction.

On September 1, 1995, CKVR ended its affiliation with the CBC and converted into an independent station as &quot;The New VR&quot;, and began targeting its programming towards younger viewers. As part of the relaunch, newscasts were overhauled to be similar in format to Toronto sister station CITY-TV, classic shows were dropped in favour of newer programs (including, among others, the syndicated &quot;Action Pack&quot; block, the short-lived newsmagazine &quot;Day and Date&quot;, and encore presentations of Citytv&#x27;s original productions, like &quot;CityLine&quot; and &quot;MovieTelevision&quot;; cross-promotion between both stations also commenced), and the station became an official broadcaster of the Toronto Raptors NBA franchise (sharing coverage with Citytv). Over $1 million was invested into new equipment for the station. 

The new direction was successful—as CHUM Limited began replicating CKVR&#x27;s format on its other stations, including several that it had acquired from Baton Broadcasting in 1997 (including CHRO-TV in Pembroke, CHWI-TV in Wheatley, CFPL-TV in London and CKNX-TV in Wingham), which formed the basis for a television system originally known as NewNet. At various times during the late 1990s and early 2000s, CKVR also broadcast mid-week games from the Raptors, as well as games from the NHL&#x27;s Toronto Maple Leafs. The Maple Leafs and Raptors games were carried on all of NewNet&#x27;s stations across Ontario with the exception of CHRO-TV, which did not carry Maple Leafs games due to the fact that CHRO is in the home market of the Ottawa Senators. CKVR also broadcast &quot;WWF Monday Night Raw&quot; for a time in the late 1990s as well.

In the early 2000s, plans were being created for CKVR to move from their original facility to a new, state-of-the-art broadcast centre in Barrie&#x27;s historic Allandale Station, much as other CHUM properties had street-side studios located in city centres. CHUM purchased the of land, including the station buildings, for C$1,050,000 in 2000. CHUM planned to restore the Allandale Station building as part of their plan, but changed their plan in 2004. In 2007, CHUM agreed to sell the property to the City for the same amount CHUM originally paid. CHUM received a Charitable Donation tax receipt reflecting the increased value of the property since 2000 largely due to the restoration and site works completed by CHUM.

In February 2005, CHUM announced plans to consolidate the master control departments for CKVR, CFPL, CHRO, CHWI and CKNX at 299 Queen Street West in Toronto (which housed most of CHUM&#x27;s television services including MuchMusic and CP24 and had also housed the operations for Toronto television station, CITY-TV at the time), and to consolidate the traffic and programming departments of the other stations at CFPL&#x27;s facilities in London, resulting in the loss of approximately nine staff members from CKVR. Those operations were migrated to the Toronto facilities on June 3, 2005.

After CHUM&#x27;s acquisition of Craig Media, its A-Channel stations in Western Canada were converted to owned-and-operated stations of the Citytv system on August 2, 2005. On the same day, the previous brand was transferred to the NewNet stations, resulting in CKVR rebranding under the A-Channel name.

==Bell ownership==
On July 12, 2006, CTV owner Bell Globemedia (the latter which renamed it to CTVglobemedia in January 2007) announced plans to purchase CHUM Limited for C$1.7 billion, with plans to divest itself of the A-Channel stations and the Access Alberta educational-commercial stations and cable channel. That same day, CHUM laid off over 281 employees and CKVR was mostly not affected, which CHUM intends to return the station to its local focus.

On April 9, 2007, it was announced that Rogers Communications would acquire the A-Channel network of stations (including CKVR), along with several other CHUM&#x27;s speciality channels from CTVglobemedia as part of its pending take over CHUM Limited. The Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) said it would only approve CTVglobemedia&#x27;s purchase of CHUM if it sold off the latter company&#x27;s Citytv stations instead, while being permitted to keep the A-Channel stations (including CKVR). CTVglobemedia took control of the A-Channel stations and the rest of CHUM Limited&#x27;s assets (excluding the Citytv network of stations, which were sold to Rogers Communications) on June 22, 2007. Richard Gray was named head of news for the A-Channel stations and CKX-TV in Brandon, Manitoba (another station that was included in the CHUM acquisition). Gray reported directly to the CTVgm corporate group instead of CTV News to preserve autonomy in news presentation and management. Gray began to oversee CKVR and the other news departments; CHRO, CFPL, CKX-TV, CKNX-TV, CHWI and CIVI in Victoria, British Columbia. On August 11, 2008, the A-Channel system (and the Atlantic Satellite Network, an independent cable channel in Atlantic Canada which Baton/CTV had acquired from CHUM in 1997) were rebranded as &quot;A&quot;.
On September 10, 2010, Bell Canada announced plans to re-acquire 100% of CTVglobemedia, a deal which was approved by the CRTC on March 7, 2011; the deal was finalized on April 1, 2011, with CTVglobemedia being absorbed into Bell Media.

On May 30, 2011, Bell Media announced that the A system would be relaunched as CTV Two effective on August 29, 2011. Along with the relaunch came the rebranding of CKVR&#x27;s newscasts as &quot;CTV News&quot; (a brand that was already used for the newscasts on CTV&#x27;s owned-and-operated stations, including network flagship CFTO in nearby Toronto), and the implementation of an anchor desk for its newscasts as well as the addition of a high definition feed on its new digital signal.

==News operation==

CKVR-DT presently broadcasts hours of locally produced newscasts each week (with one hour-long show each weekday at 6 p.m., and half-hour shows at 11 p.m. on weekdays, and at 6 p.m. and 11 p.m. on Saturdays and Sundays); in regards to the number of hours devoted to news programming, it is the lowest local newscast output out of any English-language television station in the Toronto market as a whole (of the English stations serving the immediate Toronto area, CBC O&amp;O CBLT-DT produces the lowest newscast output with 11 hours each week). In addition to CKVR&#x27;s news centre in Barrie, CKVR-DT also operates news bureaus in Collingwood and Muskoka. The station&#x27;s newscasts are branded &quot;CTV News Barrie&quot; in line with other CTV and CTV 2 owned-and-operated stations which also use similar branding. The station currently produces a one-hour local news programs weeknights at 6 p.m., and half-hour programs nightly at 11 p.m., and on weekends at 6 p.m.

During the station&#x27;s CBC years, their newscasts were branded as &quot;CKVR Total News&quot; and featured a conventional newscast format. One young reporter, Kevin Frankish, reported for the station on the 1985 tornado, and eventually was promoted to CITY-TV&#x27;s news operation.

When the station was relaunched in 1995, their newscast underwent a similar overhaul. The station&#x27;s news now took after CITY-TV&#x27;s groundbreaking &quot;CityPulse&quot;, including an open newsroom set where anchors and reporters stood up to present the news. The focus of the newscast was also broadened to include more of the communities around Barrie, resulting in the newscast being dubbed &quot;VRLand News&quot;, &quot;VRLand&quot; being an all-encompassing term for the station&#x27;s coverage area. By 1999, the newscast had been renamed to simply &quot;VR News&quot;.

During the station&#x27;s latter years under CHUM ownership, CKVR simulcast the flagship Toronto edition of CITY-TV&#x27;s morning program &quot;Breakfast Television&quot;, with local news inserts incorporated that focused on stories within the Barrie area. In 2008, CKVR debuted a three-hour weekday morning news program titled &quot;A Morning&quot;, which was anchored by K.C. Colby (now weather specialist for the station&#x27;s weekday evening newscasts) and Jennifer Buchanan.

Due to financial difficulties, CTVglobemedia cancelled &quot;A Morning&quot;, and the public affairs programs &quot;A News This Week&quot; (a pre-recorded wrap of the week&#x27;s top stories, which debuted in the 1990s) and &quot;Ontario News This Week&quot; (a review of the week&#x27;s top stories across the province, which also debuted in 2008) on March 4, 2009, laying off 24 employees at the station as part of a larger series of cutbacks and massive layoffs which resulted in the losses of 118 jobs at A&#x27;s stations across Canada. The morning program was replaced by rebroadcasts of CKVR&#x27;s 11 p.m. newscast.

Evening co-anchor Lance Chilton resigned from the station on June 14, 2010, to work in the real estate industry. In August 2010, Tony Grace, who had served as anchor and national reporter for Ottawa sister station CHRO, was named the new Senior News Anchor for CKVR effective September 20, 2010.

In September and October 2015, the station celebrated its 60th anniversary with a special five part news series of in-depth feature reports on the station&#x27;s history. The week culminated with a live broadcast of &quot;CTV News at 6&quot; on October 2, 2015, from the Barrie waterfront, featuring staff and on-air personalities past and present. The anniversary series examining the station&#x27;s history was also rebroadcast as a half-hour special hosted by Tony Grace on December 28, 2015.

==Technical information==
===Subchannel===
===Analogue-to-digital conversion===
CKVR shut down its analogue signal, over VHF channel 3, on August 31, 2011, the official date on which Canadian television stations in CRTC-designated mandatory markets transitioned from analogue to digital broadcasts. The station flash cut its digital signal into operation, broadcasting on channel 10, using virtual channel 3.

===Transmitters===
The current CKVR Television Tower is a high guyed mast for FM and television signal transmission located at in Barrie. It was built in 1978, after a light plane crashed into the smaller incarnation of the tower the previous year.

CKVR previously operated low-power rebroadcast transmitters in the communities of Parry Sound, Huntsville and Haliburton, respectively on VHF channels 11, 8 and 5. The Parry Sound transmitter moved to VHF channel 12 in the mid-1970s before Kitchener CTV station CKCO-TV (channel 13) opened a rebroadcast transmitter in Huntsville on channel 11. The Haliburton transmitter was located very close to another CBC affiliate transmitter, CHEX-TV in Peterborough, located at Minden and broadcasting on channel 7. The channel 5 transmitter was shut down when Toronto&#x27;s CBLT moved from channel 6 to channel 5, and became largely redundant as a result of CKVR&#x27;s increased transmission tower height in the early 1970s. The Huntsville transmitter increased to full power in 1991 to better cover much of Muskoka and Haliburton County; it was bought by the CBC in 1995 as part of CKVR&#x27;s disaffiliation from the CBC, and became a rebroadcaster of CBLT (remaining in operation until CBC shut down its analogue rebroadcasters in July 2012). CKVR kept its Parry Sound transmitter, and CBC established CBLT transmitters in Barrie and Parry Sound at that time, on channels 16 and 18, respectively.

On May 30, 2011, Bell Media announced plans to add a rebroadcast transmitter in Southern Ontario in 2012, to allow new advertising opportunities in the Toronto–Hamilton market. An application was filed with the CRTC and Industry Canada on June 17, 2011, to allow for a digital repeater (CKVP-DT) on UHF channel 42 in Fonthill, serving Niagara Falls, Fort Erie and St. Catharines, and a repeater (CHCJ-DT) on UHF channel 35 on CHCH-DT&#x27;s tower, serving Hamilton, Oakville, Haldimand County, Caledonia, Brantford, Milton and Cambridge. This application was approved on January 26, 2012. On May 17, 2012, Bell Media had announced to the CRTC that it was unable to negotiate a lease with Channel Zero, owners of CHCH (and its broadcast tower). It requested and received permission to test its signal on one of its own towers, the Bell microwave tower located on Upper Wentworth Street at Fennell Avenue, for a period of one year. In addition to this technical amendment, the station&#x27;s Hamilton transmitter is to be fed by fibre optic connection, instead of being satellite-fed, rendering it less susceptible to interference during thunderstorms. On July 8, 2013, Bell Media applied for a substantial increase in power for CHCJ-DT, from 5 kW to 150 kW average (390 kW maximum) with a slight decrease in height to 110.0 meters. This was approved on January 15, 2014, despite an objection from Rogers Media, with the addition of the site on Upper Wentworth Street as its permanent transmitter site (to compensate for the loss of CHCH-DT&#x27;s tower space).

On February 11, 2016, Bell Media applied for its regular license renewals, which included applications to delete a long list of transmitters, including CKVR-TV-1. Bell Media&#x27;s rationale for deleting these analog repeaters is below:
&quot;We are electing to delete these analog transmitters from the main licence with which they are associated. These analog transmitters generate no incremental revenue, attract little to no viewership given the growth of BDU or DTH subscriptions and are costly to maintain, repair or replace. In addition, none of the highlighted transmitters offer any programming that differs from the main channels. The Commission has determined that broadcasters may elect to shut down transmitters but will lose certain regulatory privileges (distribution on the basic service, the ability to request simultaneous substitution) as noted in Broadcasting Regulatory Policy CRTC 2015–24, Over-the-air transmission of television signals and local programming. We are fully aware of the loss of these regulatory privileges as a result of any transmitter shutdown.&quot;
At the same time, Bell Media applied to convert the licenses of CTV Two Atlantic (formerly ASN) and CTV Two Alberta (formerly ACCESS) from satellite-to-cable undertakings into television stations without transmitters (similar to cable-only network affiliates in the United States), and to reduce the level of educational content on CTV Two Alberta.

<text>CFPL-DT (channel 10) is a television station in London, Ontario, Canada, part of the CTV 2 system. It is owned and operated by Bell Media alongside Kitchener-based CTV station CKCO-DT (channel 13), although the two stations maintain separate operations. CFPL-DT&#x27;s studios and local transmitter are located on Communications Road on the southwestern side of London, and its Wingham-area rebroadcast transmitter is located on Tower Road in South Bruce.

==History==
CFPL was founded by Walter J. Blackburn, who also owned London&#x27;s major newspaper, the &quot;London Free Press&quot;, as well as radio station CFPL on both the AM and FM bands. The television station first came on the air on November 28, 1953, with four hours of programming per day. That night, there was a major fire in London, on which CFPL&#x27;s news program was able to report almost immediately during its first news hour. The station&#x27;s transmitter was originally located atop the CFPL Television Tower, which was completed that year.

CFPL was the second privately owned station in Canada (CKSO-TV in Sudbury, now CICI-TV, was the first). Its news program was the first to be scheduled at 6 p.m., during &quot;the supper hour&quot;, which set the standard for other stations in Canada. In 1973, the station expanded its supper-hour news to a full hour. CFPL also later became one of the first in Canada to broadcast in colour. From the day it began broadcasting, CFPL was affiliated with the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. In 1961, CFPL-TV began transmitting its signal from a tall guyed tower located in London, which is one of the oldest supertall television towers in Canada. In 1963, it became the CBC affiliate for Kitchener as well after CKCO-TV switched to CTV.

CFPL was the CBC&#x27;s largest private affiliate, but wanted to produce and broadcast more local programming. This caused its relations with the CBC to worsen over the years. CBC required affiliates like CFPL to carry a minimum amount of its schedule, and, according to station management, CBC programming was less lucrative by that time. Nonetheless, CFPL was a very successful station, and posted good profits. It finally disaffiliated with CBC and went independent on September 4, 1988. CFPL&#x27;s slogan following disaffiliation was &quot;The fun is here!&quot;, but the slogan did not last. With no CBC programming, such as &quot;The National&quot; and &quot;Hockey Night in Canada&quot; to attract viewers, ratings plummeted and so did revenues. By the end of 1989, the station was almost bankrupt, but tried to hang on as an independent station for another few years, even though its programming schedule did not have much beyond news to attract viewership.

In 1992, amid poor ratings and low revenues, the station was sold to Baton Broadcasting. In 1994, the various Baton stations, including CFPL, merged to form first &quot;Ontario Network Television&quot;, then renamed Baton Broadcast System. Baton greatly increased CFPL&#x27;s news department, hiring dozens of people and rebranding the newscast as &quot;News Now&quot;. While Baton focused much of energy on news programming, it cut much non-news local programming from many stations, including CFPL. The long-time lifestyles program &quot;One O&#x27;Clock Live&quot; was cancelled in early 1997, for example.

===As The New PL===

In 1997, Baton sold CFPL and some of its other television stations to CHUM Limited. Under CHUM, CFPL joined the NewNet system and was accordingly rebranded &quot;The New PL&quot; on September 7, 1998. This was not done without controversy. In April that year, CHUM fired news co-anchor Al McGregor, which generated harsh criticism of the station&#x27;s new owners and its new format in style of Citytv&#x27;s programming. News director George Clark replaced him as co-anchor for some time, but he left the station in early 2001. In October 2002, Kate Young moved on to a community relations position at the station, and reporter Kathy Mueller replaced her as anchor at 6 p.m. Dan MacLellan joined the station from A-Channel station CKEM-TV in Edmonton (now a Citytv owned-and-operated station) at that time, and became her co-anchor.

In February 2005, CHUM announced plans to consolidate the master control operations for CFPL, CKVR, CHRO, CHWI and CKNX at 299 Queen Street West in Toronto, and consolidating the traffic and programming departments at CFPL in London, resulting in the loss of approximately 13 staff members from CFPL. On June 3, 2005, at approximately 10 a.m., the London master control signal came to an end, as the new consolidated master control took to air.

===As A-Channel London===

On August 2, 2005, CFPL was rebranded as A-Channel as part of CHUM Limited&#x27;s rebranding of the NewNet stations. While Craig Media&#x27;s A-Channel stations merged into Citytv following CHUM&#x27;s acquisition of Craig Media in 2004. &quot;NewsNow at Noon&quot; was cancelled one month earlier. On July 12, 2006, CTV owner CTVglobemedia announced plans to purchase A-Channel owner CHUM Limited for , with plans to divest itself of the A-Channel stations and the Access Alberta cable channel.

On April 9, 2007, Omni Television owner Rogers Communications applied to the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) to purchase all of the A-Channel stations (including CFPL), CKX-TV and several cable channels being put up for sale in the wake of CTVglobemedia&#x27;s pending acquisition of the CHUM group.

On June 8, 2007, the CRTC announced its approval of CTVglobemedia&#x27;s purchase of CHUM Limited, but added a condition that CTVglobemedia must sell off CHUM&#x27;s Citytv stations to another buyer while keeping the A-Channel stations (including CFPL), in effect cancelling the planned sale of A-Channel to Rogers Media.

On June 22, 2007, all of the CHUM Limited channels (with the exception of Citytv) were officially taken over by CTVglobemedia. On July 26, 2007, CTVglobemedia named Richard Gray the head of news for the A-Channel stations and CKX-TV.

===As A London===

On August 11, 2008, CFPL was rebranded as A as part of CTVglobemedia&#x27;s rebranding of the A-Channel stations. A rebranding campaign began earlier in June 2008 with newscasts being referred to by the station&#x27;s employees as &quot;A News&quot;. Following the closure of sister station, CKNX-TV in Wingham on August 31, 2009, that station became a repeater of CFPL.

On September 10, 2010, BCE announced plans to re-acquire 100% of CTVglobemedia&#x27;s broadcasting arm, including CFPL (and the entire A television system). Under the deal, Woodbridge Company Limited, Torstar, and the Ontario Teachers&#x27; Pension Plan would together receive $1.3 billion in either cash or equity in BCE, while BCE will also assume $1.7 billion in debt (BCE&#x27;s existing equity interest is $200 million, for a total transaction value of $3.2 billion). Woodbridge will also regain majority control of the Globe and Mail Inc., with Bell retaining a 15% interest. The deal was approved by the CRTC on March 7, 2011.

On April 1, 2011, Bell Canada finalized its purchase of the assets of CTVglobemedia it did not already own, with CFPL (along with the rest of the A system) officially becoming part of Bell Media.

===As CTV Two/CTV 2 London===

On May 30, 2011, Bell Media announced that the A television stations, including CFPL, would be rebranded as CTV Two on August 29, 2011. On that date, CFPL rebranded from &quot;A London&quot; to &quot;CTV Two London&quot;. At the same time, &quot;A News London&quot; became &quot;CTV News London&quot;, also the station began carrying programming (excluding newscasts for the time being) in a high definition format.

On March 18, 2012, riots were started by students of Fanshawe College when St. Patrick&#x27;s Day parties got out of hand. A CFPL news van was set on fire.

On June 27, 2016, it was announced that Bell Media filed a proposal with the CRTC to shut down CKNX-TV, which is among 40 of its television transmitters (all rebroadcasters of other stations) slated for closure, due to maintenance costs, high cable and satellite viewership, and no generation of revenue.

This was part of Bell&#x27;s regular periodic licence renewal process, which began on February 11, 2016. Bell Media&#x27;s rationale for deleting these analogue repeaters is below:
&quot;We are electing to delete these analog transmitters from the main licence with which they are associated. These analog transmitters generate no incremental revenue, attract little to no viewership given the growth of BDU or DTH subscriptions and are costly to maintain, repair or replace. In addition, none of the highlighted transmitters offer any programming that differs from the main channels. The Commission has determined that broadcasters may elect to shut down transmitters but will lose certain regulatory privileges (distribution on the basic service, the ability to request simultaneous substitution) as noted in Broadcasting Regulatory Policy CRTC 2015–24, Over-the-air transmission of television signals and local programming. We are fully aware of the loss of these regulatory privileges as a result of any transmitter shutdown.&quot;
At the same time, Bell Media applied to convert the licences of CTV 2 Atlantic (formerly ASN) and CTV 2 Alberta (formerly ACCESS) from satellite-to-cable undertakings into television stations without transmitters (similar to cable-only network affiliates in the United States), and to reduce the level of educational content on CTV2 Alberta.

==Local programming==

===Programs produced in the past===
* London Tigers baseball (1989–1993)
* &quot;Reach for the Top&quot;
* &quot;The Red Green Show&quot; (1993–1994, in association with YTV)
* &quot;Take Your Choice&quot; (1960–1971)

===News operation===
CFPL-DT presently broadcasts ten hours of locally produced newscasts each week (with hours on weekdays and Sundays, and one hour on Saturdays). During the late 1950s and early 1960s, Ward Cornell anchored sports before moving on to &quot;Hockey Night in Canada&quot;. Prior to 1972, Hugh Bremner, anchor of &quot;Panorama Newsreel&quot;, became anchor of the new &quot;FYI&quot;. A half-hour summer replacement program at 5:30 p.m. (preceding the news) called &quot;Pie in Your FYI&quot;, a spoof of &quot;FYI&quot; was played one summer in the 1960s. It began with a CFPL personality being hit in the face with a pie, and featured skits and spoofs of advertising.

From 1972 to 1981, the flagship newscast, &quot;FYI&quot; was anchored by Jack Burghardt. During the 1980s, &quot;FYI&quot; was anchored first by Eric Sorensen (1981–1984), then Neil Stevens (a former weather anchor at CBET Windsor). In January 1985, CFPL hired its first female anchor, Kate Young, who co-anchored &quot;FYI&quot; with Stevens. Despite female news anchors becoming commonplace across Canada and the United States by the mid-1980s, this was a controversial move, and many London viewers were very upset by there being a female anchor. Young continued to anchor the 6 p.m. newscast for the next 17 years, and she became a well-known and respected face in the London community. Tragically, her co-anchor Stevens was killed in a car crash near Alvinston, Ontario, early on July 17, 1987. Al McGregor was appointed as Young&#x27;s co-anchor in 1988, a post he held for the next 10 years. Throughout the 1980s, the sports anchor was Pete James (now with CJBK radio), and the weather forecaster was Jay Campbell.

During the station&#x27;s ownership by Baton, the newscasts were retitled &quot;News Now&quot;, which carried over into the CHUM era. When CHUM took over, the previously standard news format gave way to one replicating that used by then-sister station Citytv and other NewNet stations, in which anchors read the news standing up from a large open newsroom referred to as the &quot;news environment&quot;. 
Anchor Kathy Mueller resigned as of August 19, 2008, after a 13-year career at the station to pursue a new career with the Canadian Red Cross in Indonesia, assisting with relief efforts resulting from the 2004 tsunami disaster. Jay Campbell also retired as CFPL weather specialist on October 16, 2009, after a 28-year career at the station, and was replaced by 11 p.m. weeknight weather specialist, Julie Atchision on October 19, 2009. On September 8, 2010, Atchision left the station due to maternity leave and was replaced by Ross Hull, who was the weather specialist for the 6 and 11 p.m. weeknight newscasts until he left to work as a weather specialist for CTV station CKCO-TV in Kitchener. Hull is now a meteorologist with Global owned-and-operated station CIII-DT in Toronto.

On March 4, 2009, CFPL replaced &quot;A Morning&quot; with six back to back repeats of the previous night&#x27;s 11 p.m. newscast as part of a larger series of cutbacks which axed 118 jobs at the A stations.

On December 24, 2011, CFPL&#x27;s 6 p.m. main news anchor, Dan McLellan was arrested and was subsequently charged with several counts of assault, and as a result, he resigned from his duties at the station. Tara Overholt subsequently became the anchor of the 6 p.m. weekday newscasts.

==Technical information==

===Subchannel===
===Analogue-to-digital conversion===
On August 31, 2011, when Canadian television stations in CRTC-designated mandatory markets transitioned from analogue to digital broadcasts, CFPL-TV flash cut its digital signal into operation on VHF channel 10.

<text>Luxair, legally , is a flag carrier of Luxembourg with its headquarters in Munsbach, Luxembourg, and hub at Luxembourg Airport. It operates scheduled services to destinations in Europe, North Africa, the Mediterranean and the Middle East with additional charter and seasonal services. It is Luxembourg&#x27;s only passenger-carrying airline offering regular, non-charter service.

==History==
===Early years===
Luxair descended from Luxembourg Airlines, which was founded in 1948. Luxair was set up in 1961 to meet the growing demand for air links between Luxembourg and other European cities. In 1962, Luxembourg Airlines became Luxair and began flights by launching a Luxembourg–Paris route with a Fokker F27 Friendship.

From 1964 to 1969, Luxair operated three Lockheed L-1649A Starliner aircraft in a cooperative agreement with Trek Airways, from Luxembourg to Johannesburg. The Starliners were painted in Luxair livery and were registered in Luxembourg. By 1967, Luxair&#x27;s fleet consisted of three Fokker F27 Friendships and one Vickers Viscount. The latter was written off in a non-fatal accident in 1969 and replaced the following year by the airline&#x27;s first jet airliner, a Sud Aviation Caravelle. By 1976, Luxair was operating a Boeing 707 with a Boeing 737-200 then joining the fleet in 1977.

Over the years, Luxair gradually introduced further jet aircraft: Boeing 737-400s and Boeing 737-500s; as well as Fokker 50 turboprops and Embraer ERJ-135 and ERJ-145 regional jets. In the 1980s, Boeing 747SPs owned by South African Trek Airways and operated by LUXAVIA were painted in Luxair colours, flying routes between South Africa and Europe, as well as holiday charters from Luxembourg. 
LUXAVIA was a joint venture between Trek Airways and Luxair, enabling Trek Airways to avoid the repercussions of widespread anti-Apartheid boycotts.

===Development since the 2000s===
In March 2003, Luxair ordered two new Boeing 737-700s to replace its older Boeing aircraft. The first of the new aircraft was delivered on 18 February 2004. A third aircraft was ordered in August 2003 and delivered in January 2005.On 21 December 2003, Luxair launched a new logo depicting a flying boomerang. The previous logo had been in use for 42 years. To move to an all-jet fleet, the last Fokker 50 aircraft was withdrawn from service in April 2005. The rising cost of oil made operating regional jets increasingly difficult. To lessen its exposure, Luxair decided to reintroduce turboprop aircraft, and in June 2006 it signed a firm order with Bombardier Aerospace for three Dash 8-Q400s, plus three options. The last of the three aircraft was delivered in September 2007. Two additional Q400s were ordered later.

In October 2008, Luxair decided to place an order for its first Boeing 737-800. This aircraft replaced the last Boeing 737-500 in Luxair&#x27;s fleet and facilitated Luxair&#x27;s offer on its holiday destinations. In 2009, the airline was awarded as the most punctual scheduled operator at London City Airport during 2008 by Flight on Time, based on CAA statistics. In 2011 Luxair carried 1,302,771 passengers.

In 2013 and 2014, two new Boeing 737-800s fitted with &quot;Boeing Sky Interior&quot; became part of the fleet, which enabled Luxair to retire the last Boeing 737-500 from service.

In July 2015, Luxair&#x27;s minority shareholder Lufthansa announced it would sell its 13 per cent stake in the airline it had held since 1993. The government of Luxembourg was named as the preferred buyer. In November 2015, the sale was finalized when Lufthansa sold its entire stake to the state of Luxembourg. Luxair also announced it would stop flying its route to Frankfurt Airport previously operated on a codeshare with Lufthansa as the latter started the same route itself. Luxair is still part of the Lufthansa frequent flyer program &quot;Miles &amp; More&quot;.

After the bankruptcy of Air Berlin, Luxair announced they would begin flying from Saarbrücken Airport to Berlin Tegel Airport utilising a Bombardier CRJ700 which Luxair leased from Adria Airways based in Saarbrücken.

==Corporate affairs==
===Ownership===
As of November 2015, after Lufthansa sold its shares, the airline is owned by the State of Luxembourg (52.04%), Banque et Caisse d&#x27;Épargne de l&#x27;État (21.81%), Banque Internationale à Luxembourg (13.14%), the Luxair Group and others (13.11%). In total, the State of Luxembourg owns 74.98% of the company through various state-owned corporations and its holding of 10% of Banque Internationale à Luxembourg.

===Special liveries===
Starting from 2020, Luxair released special liveries for some of its aircraft. On 25 July 2021, the company introduced the &quot;SUMO Artwork Luxair&#x27;s Boeing 737/800&quot;. The livery was designed by the local street artist Christian &quot;SUMO&quot; Pearson. The special livery was meant to spread a positive message at the moment of the restart of operations after the first COVID-19 lockdown and was the main action of the company&#x27;s broader &quot;FlyingIsAnArt&quot; project:
On 25 November 2020, the company released a de Havilland Q400 with an orange logo to raise awareness for violence against women.

In July 2022, Luxair was the world&#x27;s first airline to paint a livery of one of its aircraft in a rainbow, to support Luxembourg Pride Month. This project inspired the German carrier Lufthansa, which one year later decided to do the same on one of its aircraft.

In October 2022, Luxair painted one of its aircraft with pink artwork by the local artist Lisa Junius in partnership with Think Pink Lux, to contribute to the Pink October worldwide campaign.

==Accidents and incidents==
*On 22 December 1969, a Vickers Viscount (registration LX-LGC) arriving from Frankfurt Airport, Germany, landed 60% on the right-hand side of R24, hit a snowbank piled up by snowplows at the intersection with runway 20 during landing and rollout at Luxembourg Findel Airport in freezing fog weather. No passengers were killed, but the aircraft was damaged beyond repair. It was scrapped in May 1970.
*On 6 November 2002, Luxair Flight 9642, a Fokker 50 (registration LX-LGB) incoming from Berlin, Germany, crashed in a field near the village of Niederanven during its final approach to Luxembourg Findel Airport. Twenty passengers and two crew members died, including artist Michel Majerus. Only the pilot in command and one passenger survived. This is the only fatal accident in Luxair&#x27;s history.
*On 30 September 2015, Luxair Flight 9562, operated by a Bombardier Q400, was taking off from Saarbrücken Airport when the first officer retracted the landing gear before the aircraft lifted off. The aircraft collapsed onto its belly and came to a stop on the runway. The aircraft was damaged beyond repair and Luxair ordered a replacement Q400 to be delivered in August 2016.
*On 4 February 2024, Luxair Flight 5682 flying between Ljubljana and Luxembourg was forced to land in Munich, after pilots reported a crack in their cockpit windshield. The Dash-8 plane was grounded for approximately 31 hours in Munich, repaired, and returned to Luxembourg.

<doc id="366097" wikidata="Q2000846" url="?curid=366097" title="Peace Arch">
<text>The Peace Arch () is a monument situated near the westernmost point of the Canada–United States border in the contiguous United States, between the communities of Blaine, Washington and Surrey, British Columbia. Construction of the tall arch was headed by American lawyer Sam Hill and dedicated in September 1921. The Peace Arch commemorates the signing of the Treaty of Ghent in 1814, and symbolizes a long history of peace between the two nations. The monument is built on the exact U.S.–Canada boundary, where Interstate 5 on the U.S. side of the border becomes Highway 99 on the Canadian side, in the grass median between the northbound and southbound lanes.

The monument and the surrounding land is part of Peace Arch Park. Within the park is Peace Arch Border Crossing, a major border crossing between Interstate 5 and British Columbia Highway 99.

==Description==

The Peace Arch has the flags of United States and Canada mounted on its crown, and two inscriptions on both sides of its frieze. The inscription on the U.S. side of the Peace Arch reads &quot;Children of a common mother&quot; (referring to the two nations&#x27; common origin from the British Empire), and the words on the Canadian side read &quot;Brethren dwelling together in unity&quot; (). Within the arch, each side has an iron gate mounted on either side of the border with an inscription above each gate: the one on the east side read &quot;May these gates never be closed&quot;, while on the west side read &quot;1814 Open One Hundred Years 1914&quot;.

The surrounding park, Peace Arch Park, consists of Peace Arch Provincial Park on the Canadian side and Peace Arch State Park on the American side of the border.

About 500,000 people visit the Peace Arch each year. The monument and surrounding park is considered an international park. As such, visitors do not require either a passport or visa to pass through their applicable border crossing so long as they stay within the boundaries of the park and leave the park into the country from which they entered.

Because of the Peace Arch monument, the border crossing between Surrey and Blaine is popularly known as the &quot;Peace Arch Border Crossing&quot;. In Canada, the crossing is officially named Douglas after Sir James Douglas, the first governor of the Colony of British Columbia. It is one of the busiest border crossings between Canada and the United States, and the busiest such crossing west of Detroit.

== History ==

Border inspection services at what is now known as the Peace Arch Border Crossing long predated the 1921 construction of the Peace Arch.

In 1914 Samuel Hill, lawyer for the Great Northern Railway, organized an international fundraising campaign to build the Arch. American architect Harvey Wiley Corbett donated his talents to design the Arch. International volunteers began constructing in 1920. It was dedicated on September 6, 1921, and was considered one of the first earthquake-resistant structures built in North America.

The Peace Arch Park has been the site of various international events and protests. In 1952, African-American singer and activist Paul Robeson, banned from international travel during the Red Scares, performed several concerts at the site. He sang from a flatbed truck on the American side to an audience in Canada. The Peace Arch was vandalized with paint and other damage by Canadian protestors demonstrating against the Cambodian campaign during the Vietnam War on May 9, 1970.

On February 9, 2010, the Vancouver 2010 Olympic Torch Relay visited the north side of the Peace Arch, while Premier Gordon Campbell and Governor Christine Gregoire addressed a crowd of several hundred people.

<doc id="366100" wikidata="Q1697067" url="?curid=366100" title="Sarubobo">
<text>is a Japanese amulet, particularly associated with the town of Takayama in Gifu Prefecture. &quot;Sarubobo&quot; are red human-shaped dolls, with no facial features, made in a variety of sizes. Traditionally, &quot;sarubobo&quot; are made by grandmothers for their grandchildren as dolls, and for their daughters as a charm for good marriage, good children and to ensure a well-rounded couple.

==Etymology==
&quot;Sarubobo&quot; literally translated from the Japanese as &quot;a baby monkey&quot;. &quot;Saru&quot; is the Japanese word for monkey, and &quot;bobo&quot; is the word for baby in the dialect of Takayama.

There are several reasons why the amulet has this name. The sarubobo is associated with three wishes:

* Protection from bad things.
In Japanese, the English word &quot;leave&quot; translates as &quot;saru&quot;, so possession of a sarubobo means that bad things will &quot;saru&quot;

*A happy home, a good match
In Japanese, a happy home is &quot;kanai enman&quot;, a good match is &quot;ryo-en&quot; (Another way of saying &quot;saru&quot; is &quot;en&quot;.)

*Having an easy delivery on birth.
Monkeys&#x27; childbirth is easy.

The face of the &quot;sarubobo&quot; is traditionally red, as is the face of baby monkeys.

==Facelessness==
&quot;Sarubobo dolls&quot; and charms usually have no facial features. The reasons for this are unclear, but some have been suggested. One suggestion is that, originally, &quot;sarubobo&quot; were made from left over cloth and made by relatives, so there was no need for them to be completely accurate.

Another suggestion is that the absence of a face allows the owner to imagine it - when the owner is sad, they can imagine their &quot;sarubobo&quot; to be sad too. A common tale told by the people of Takayama is that the facelessness is the result of the dolls being made during the period of World War II. The mothers knew that these were hard and unhappy times but, did not want to give the dolls sad faces. So they left them faceless.

==Modern &quot;sarubobo&quot;==

Nowadays, &quot;sarubobo&quot; are a popular souvenir in Takayama, and are available in many different colours and shapes from souvenir shops. There is even a Hello Kitty doll dressed as a sarubobo.

The differently coloured &quot;sarubobo&quot; are each associated with different wishes;

*The red is for luck in marriage, fertility and childbirth
*Blue - for luck in study and work
*Pink - for luck in love
*Green - for luck in health
*Yellow - for luck in money
*Black - to remove bad luck

There is also a differently-shaped &quot;sarubobo&quot; called a &quot;tobibobo&quot;.

<text>The University of Oxford has 36 colleges, three societies, and four permanent private halls (PPHs) of religious foundation. The colleges and PPHs are autonomous self-governing corporations within the university. 

These colleges are not only houses of residence, but have substantial responsibility for teaching undergraduate students. Generally tutorials (one of the main methods of teaching in Oxford) and classes are the responsibility of colleges, while lectures, examinations, laboratories, and the central library are run by the university. Students normally have most of their tutorials in their own college, but often have a couple of modules taught at other colleges or even at faculties and departments. Most colleges take both graduates and undergraduates, but several are for graduates only.

Undergraduate and graduate students may name preferred colleges in their applications. For undergraduate students, an increasing number of departments practise reallocation to ensure that the ratios between potential students and subject places available at each college are as uniform as possible. For the Department of Physics, reallocation is done on a random basis after a shortlist of candidates is drawn upon and before candidates are invited for interviews at the university.

For graduate students, many colleges express a preference for candidates who plan to undertake research in an area of interest of one of its fellows. St Hugh&#x27;s College, for example, states that it accepts graduate students in most subjects, principally those in the fields of interest of the fellows of the college.

A typical college consists of a hall for dining, a chapel, a library, a college bar, senior, middle (postgraduate), and junior common rooms, rooms for 200–400 undergraduates, and lodgings for the head of the college and other dons. College buildings range from medieval to modern, but most are made up of interlinked quadrangles or courtyards, with a porter&#x27;s lodge controlling entry from the outside.

The first modern merger of colleges was in 2008, with Green College and Templeton College merging to form Green Templeton College. The number of PPHs also reduced when Greyfriars closed in 2008 and when St Benet&#x27;s Hall closed in 2022. Reuben College, established in 2019, is the first new Oxbridge college since 1990, when Kellogg College was established.

==History==

The collegiate system arose because Oxford University came into existence through the gradual agglomeration of numerous independent institutions. Over the centuries several different types of college have emerged and disappeared.

===Monastic halls===
The first academic houses were monastic halls. Of the dozens established during the 12th–15th centuries, none survived the Reformation. The modern Dominican permanent private hall of Blackfriars (1921) is a descendant of the original (1221), and is sometimes described as heir to the oldest tradition of teaching in Oxford.

===Academic halls===

As the university took shape, friction between the hundreds of students living where and how they pleased led to a decree that all undergraduates would have to reside in approved halls. 

What eventually put an end to the medieval halls was the emergence of colleges. Often generously endowed and with permanent teaching staff, the colleges were originally the preserve of graduate students. However, once they began accepting fee-paying undergraduates in the 14th century, the halls&#x27; days were numbered. Of the hundreds of Aularian houses (from the Latin for &quot;hall&quot;) that sprang up, only St Edmund Hall (c. 1225) remains.

===Colleges===
The oldest colleges are University College, Balliol, and Merton, established between 1249 and 1264, although there is some dispute over the exact order and precisely when each began teaching. The fourth oldest college is Exeter, founded in 1314, and the fifth is Oriel, founded in 1326.

===Women&#x27;s colleges===

Women entered the university in 1879, with the opening of Lady Margaret Hall and Somerville College, becoming members of the University (and thus eligible to receive degrees) in 1920. Other women&#x27;s colleges before integration were St Anne&#x27;s, St Hilda&#x27;s and St Hugh&#x27;s. In 1974 the first men&#x27;s colleges to admit women were Brasenose, Hertford, Jesus, St Catherine&#x27;s and Wadham. By 2008 all colleges had become co-residential, although one of the Permanent Private Halls, St Benet&#x27;s Hall, did not start to admit postgraduate women until Michaelmas term 2014 and women undergraduates until Michaelmas 2016.

===Postgraduate and mature colleges===
Some colleges, such as Kellogg, Linacre, Nuffield, St Antony&#x27;s, St Cross and Wolfson only admit postgraduate students. All Souls admits only fellows. Harris Manchester is intended for &quot;mature students&quot; with a minimum age of 21. The newest college of the University, Reuben College, was established in 2019 as graduate-only, enrolling its first students in 2021 using the premises of the Radcliffe Science Library.

===Societies===
Kellogg, Reuben and St Cross are the only Oxford colleges without a royal charter. They are officially societies of the university rather than independent colleges and are considered departments of the university for accounting purposes.

===Private halls===

The Oxford University Act 1854 and the university statute &quot;De aulis privatis&quot; (On private Halls) of 1855, allowed any Master of Arts aged at least 28 years to open a private hall after obtaining a licence to do so. One such was Charsley&#x27;s Hall.

===Permanent private halls===
The Universities Tests Act 1871 opened all university degrees and positions to men who were not members of the Church of England (subject to safeguards for religious instruction and worship), which made it possible for Catholics and Non-conformists to open private halls. The first Catholic private halls were Clarke&#x27;s Hall (now Campion Hall), opened by the Jesuit Order in 1896 and Hunter Blair&#x27;s Hall (later St Benet&#x27;s Hall) opened by the Benedictine Order in 1899. 
In 1918 the university passed a statute to allow private halls which were not run for profit to become permanent private halls and the two halls took their current names.

==List of colleges==


==List of permanent private halls==


==College and permanent private hall arms and colours==
Each college and permanent private hall has its own arms, although in some cases these were assumed rather than granted by the College of Arms. Under King Henry VIII Oxford colleges were granted exemption from having their arms granted by the College of Arms; and some, like Lady Margaret Hall, have chosen to take advantage of this exemption, whilst others, such as Oriel, despite having used the arms for many centuries, have recently elected to have the arms granted officially. 

The blazons below are taken from the Oxford University Calendar unless otherwise indicated. Shields are emblazoned as commonly drawn, and notable inconsistencies between blazons and emblazons (the shields as drawn) are indicated.

Each college also has its own colours used on items such as scarves and rowing blades.
===Notes===
==Heads of Houses==
The senior member of each college is an officer known generically as the Head of House. Their specific title varies from college to college as indicated in the list below. While the Head of House will usually be an academic, it is not uncommon for a person to be appointed who has had a distinguished career outside academic circles.

For a list of current Heads of Houses, see Heads of Houses.

*Principal: Brasenose, Green Templeton, Harris Manchester, Hertford, Jesus College, Lady Margaret Hall, Linacre, Mansfield, St Anne&#x27;s, St Edmund Hall, St Hilda&#x27;s, St Hugh&#x27;s, Somerville, Regent&#x27;s Park, and Wycliffe Hall
*Master: Balliol, Pembroke, St Catherine&#x27;s, St Cross, St Peter&#x27;s, University College, and Campion Hall
*Warden: All Souls, Keble, Merton, New College, Nuffield, St Antony&#x27;s, and Wadham.
*President: Corpus Christi, Kellogg, Magdalen, Reuben, St John&#x27;s, Trinity, and Wolfson
*Provost: Oriel, The Queen&#x27;s College, and Worcester
*Rector: Exeter and Lincoln
*Dean: Christ Church
*Regent: Blackfriars

The dean of Christ Church is head of both the college and the cathedral. The president of Kellogg College is also the director of the Department for Continuing Education.

==Finances==
As of 2019 the accounts of the Oxford colleges included total assets of £6.6 billion. This figure does not reflect all the assets held by the colleges as their accounts do not include the cost or value of many of their main sites or heritage assets such as works of art or libraries. The total endowments of the colleges were £5.1 billion as of 2019. Individual college endowments ranged from £1.2m (Green Templeton) to £577.6 million (Christ Church).

== Selectivity ==

===Postgraduate===
In contrast to undergraduate programmes where the constituent college or hall handles both admissions and teaching, postgraduate students are admitted through a department, which is responsible for postgraduate education and supervision. As the university operates on a collegiate system, all matriculated students are required to maintain an affiliation with a college or hall which is tasked with offering student support, welfare, and accommodation. Although the University of Oxford is already selective, an additional level of selectivity exists depending on different colleges and halls. Colleges and halls differ in their levels of selectivity, as evidenced by their varying offer rates. Except All Souls College which consists principally of research fellows, Nuffield College consistently possesses the lowest offer rate and is thus considered the most selective college. On the other hand, Kellogg College and St Antony College are among the least selective colleges, typically characterised by higher offer rates.

The table below exhibits the offer rates for postgraduate applications across each college over multiple academic years.

==Academic rankings==
For some years, an unofficial ranking of undergraduate colleges by performance in Final Honour Schools examinations, known as the Norrington Table, was published annually. As the table only took into account the examination results for the year of publication, college rankings could fluctuate considerably.

Beginning in 2005, the University of Oxford started publishing a list of colleges classified by a &quot;Norrington Score&quot;, effectively replicating the Norrington Table. The university claims to have published the results &quot;in the interests of openness&quot;. Although the university says that the college listings are &quot;not very significant&quot;, the 2005 table was the first Norrington Table with official data and also probably the first to be accurate. Dame Fiona Caldicott, the Chairman of the Conference of Colleges, said that in previous years some students had used the Data Protection Act 1998 to ensure their results were not published, rendering the unofficial tables inaccurate.

==College rivalries==
A tradition of the university is a friendly rivalry between colleges. Often, two neighbouring colleges will be rivals, and each college will pride itself in its athletic victories over the other one. Examples include:
* Jesus and Exeter
* Brasenose and Lincoln
* Balliol and Trinity
* Christ Church and Pembroke
* Keble and St John&#x27;s
*St Catherine&#x27;s and Magdalen
*St Hugh&#x27;s and St Anne&#x27;s.

== Architectural influence ==
The Oxford and Cambridge colleges have served as an architectural inspiration for Collegiate Gothic Architecture, used by a number of American universities including Princeton University and Washington University in St. Louis since the late nineteenth century.

<text>Major General Sir Newton James Moore, (17 May 1870 – 28 October 1936) was an Australian politician, businessman and army officer. He served as the eighth Premier of Western Australia from 1906 to 1910 and, following service in the First World War, was a member of the House of Commons of the United Kingdom from 1918 to 1932. He was the father of Sir Rodney Moore.

==Early life and career==

Newton Moore was born in Fremantle, Western Australia, son of James Moore, auctioneer and later mayor of Bunbury, and Elizabeth Dawson, schoolteacher. He was educated at Arthur Street Primary School in Bunbury before attending Prince Alfred College in Adelaide, South Australia. In 1886, he was apprenticed as a surveyor to Alexander Forrest. After qualifying in 1894, he worked as a contract surveyor in and around the Bunbury area. In April 1898 he married Isabella Lowrie, sister of William Lowrie.

In 1899 Moore was elected to the Bunbury Municipal Council, and was Mayor of Bunbury from 1900 to 1904. In 1903 he was also a member of the Royal Commission on Forestry, and during 1904 and 1905 he was President of the Municipal Association of Western Australia.

Moore was also involved in the Western Australian militia, commencing a long career as a private with the BRV (Bunbury Rifle Volunteers) in 1894. By 1900 he had risen to captain and was instrumental in assisting in the formation of the BRV Mounted Infantry Section, which was later incorporated into the WAMI (Western Australian Mounted Infantry). After the Commonwealth reorganisation of 1903, the unit was renamed the 18th (WAMI) Australian Light Horse. Moore served as acting commander until 1908, when he was promoted to lieutenant colonel and officially appointed the commanding officer. In August 1908, Moore was appointed commanding officer of the 5th Military District Intelligence Section, where he remained until March 1914.

==State politics and premier==
In 1901, Moore contested the Western Australian Legislative Assembly seat of Bunbury, but was unsuccessful. In 1904 he contested the seat again and won. In August 1905, he was appointed Minister for Lands and Agriculture in Cornthwaite Rason&#x27;s government. On Rason&#x27;s resignation on 7 May 1906, he became Premier of Western Australia. At 36 years old, he was at the time the youngest ever premier. He remains the most inexperienced politician ever to hold the office, having served in parliament for less than two years at the time of his appointment.

Moore&#x27;s emphasis as Premier was on agricultural development. He personally retained the Lands and Agriculture portfolio, and pursued a policy of cheap land for settlers. His government laid the foundations of the Wheatbelt, and brought the state into line with the rest of Australia through an Income and Land tax, despite opposition from the conservative Legislative Council.

In September 1907, after a dispute with the Legislative Council, Moore resigned as premier. However, Governor Bedford would not accept his resignation, nor would he consent to an early dissolution, so Moore resumed office. In 1908, Moore led the Liberal Party to another election victory. As the state had previously seen nine Premiers in a little over five years, this was a welcome respite from a period of great instability. Moore was Minister for Justice from 14 May 1909 until 30 June 1909, when he relinquished both the Agriculture and Lands portfolio and the Justice portfolio, and took up the office of Colonial Treasurer. On 16 September 1910, Moore resigned as Premier and Colonial Treasurer on the grounds of ill health.

==Agent-General and First World War==
Moore was made a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George in June 1908, and knighted as a Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George in June 1910. In February 1911, he resigned his Bunbury seat to take up the office of Agent-General for Western Australia in London.

In 1915, during World War I, while still Agent-General, the Australian government appointed him General Officer Commanding Australian Imperial Forces in the United Kingdom. He held that position until 1917, during which time he was promoted to the rank of major general. In November 1915 he was promoted to temporary colonel.

==British politics==

In 1918, Moore resigned as Agent-General after being invited by the Conservative Party to stand for the British House of Commons seat of St George&#x27;s, Hanover Square, which had been made vacant by the death of former Prime Minister of Australia Sir George Reid. He was elected to the seat on 4 October 1918. In the 1918 general election on 14 December he instead stood for and won the seat of Islington North. After a break from politics in 1923 and 1924, he won the seat of Richmond (Surrey) in the general election of 29 October 1924, and held it until his resignation on 13 April 1932. For ten years, he was Chairman of the Standing Orders Committee of the House of Commons. He established himself as an excellent representative of Australia, and his opinion on Empire matters was highly valued by British ministers.

After retiring from politics, Moore became President of the British Empire Steel Corporation, a company with interests in Western Australia and Canada. He was also a director of several important companies. He died on 28 October 1936 at a nursing home in London, following surgery.

Newton Moore Senior High School in Bunbury is named after him.

<doc id="366108" wikidata="Q467938" url="?curid=366108" title="Summit of the Americas">
<text>The Summit of the Americas (SOA) are institutionalized gatherings of heads of state and government of the member states of the Western Hemisphere where leaders discuss common policy issues, affirm shared values and commit to concerted actions at the national and regional level to address continuing and new challenges faced by countries in the Americas. 

Since the beginning of the Summits Process, the Heads of State and Government have established a vast array of priorities that appropriately tackles the priorities and the necessities of the people of the Hemisphere. Democracy has always been a central subject in the Summits despite the heterogeneity of Summit themes. It has been addressed according to the needs and concerns of the Member states, including the construction of a democratic hemispheric community, the preservation and strengthening of the democratic system, good governance, and the relationship between democracy and socio-economic issues. 

To improve the Summit Process, the Summits Secretariat has worked actively and jointly with the OAS General Secretariat and Member States and has prepared an initial proposal for a follow-up system on the mandates of the Summits of the Americas. SISCA is a mechanism that provides Member States the tools to achieve the targets set in the mandates, in order to be measurable for the medium and long-term through a results-oriented management. 

Cuba was expelled from the OAS under pressure from the United States after the Cuban Revolution of 1959. Cuba participated in the 2015 summit in Panama, and sent its foreign minister to the subsequent 2018 summit in Peru. In the early 1990s, the formerly &quot;ad hoc&quot; summits were institutionalized into a regular &quot;Summit of the Americas&quot; based on the principles of democracy and free trade. The meetings, organized by a number of multilateral bodies led by the OAS, provide an opportunity for discussions about a variety of issues and topics. 

The last summit to take place was the 9th Summit of the Americas in Los Angeles, United States of America from June 8–10, 2022. 

== History ==

==List of summits==
The events that garnered the most general public and media attention were the Quebec City and Mar del Plata summits (3rd and 4th respectively), both of which provoked very large anti-globalization and anti-Free Trade Area of the Americas protests and attendant police response.

== Summit of the Americas Secretariat ==
The Summit of the Americas Secretariat forms part of the institutional mechanism of the Summits of the Americas Process and provides support in the areas of planning, implementation, outreach, and follow up of Summit mandates. 

In the First Summit of the Americas, held in Miami in 1994, several international organizations contributed documents and suggestions that were considered by the coordinators and participants of the Summit. At the OAS, the Permanent Council, with the Secretary General, Cesar Gaviria, attended the Summit and talked about the importance of this event for Inter-American relations and for building trust amongst the countries and institutions of the Inter-American system. 

Later, the OAS had an essential role in the preparation and execution of the Summit on Sustainable Development held in Santa Cruz de la Sierra, Bolivia in 1996. The negotiation meetings on the Declaration and Plan of Action were held at OAS headquarters, with the support from the OAS as technical secretariat. 

The OAS played an active role in preparing for the Second Summit of the Americas which took place in Santiago, Chile in 1998. The OAS offered technical support for the organization of the preparatory meetings in several thematic areas such as education, science and technology, public participation, and drugs, among others. The OAS was mandated with keeping &quot;the institutional memory of the Summit Process and provide technical support to the Summit Implementation Review Group (SIRG)&quot;. As a result, the Secretary General created the Office of Summit Follow Up (OSFU) in 1998. 

The Third Summit of the Americas, held in Quebec City, Canada in 2001, recognized the central role of the OAS in the support of this process. The Office of Summit Follow up was in charge of the management of documents through the Summit website and organized the negotiation meetings with the government of Canada. In Quebec, the OAS Secretary General signed &quot;Executive Order Number 02-03&quot; on May 31, 2002, which strengthened the responsibilities of the Office of Summit Follow Up and changed its name to the Secretariat for the Summit Process. The Order also specified the Secretariat&#x27;s responsibility to coordinate activities concerning civil society participation in the Summit Process. New duties also included presiding over the Joint Summit Working Group. 

In the Special Summit of the Americas, held in Monterrey, Mexico in January 2004, governments signed the Declaration of Nuevo León. The governments called for the organizations of the Inter-American system to provide in-depth support and assistance in the preparation for the Fourth Summit of the Americas. 

The Summits of the Americas Secretariat played a fundamental role in preparing for the Fourth Summit of the Americas, held in Mar del Plata, Argentina in November 2005. In this Summit, the Heads of State and Government gathered to discuss the theme: &quot;Creating Jobs to Confront Poverty and Strengthen Democratic Governance.&quot; In the Plan of Action of Mar del Plata, the institutions of the JSWG were called to perform specific tasks in order to achieve the objectives in terms of growth and democratic governance in the region. 

During the Fifth Summit of the Americas, held in Trinidad and Tobago from April 17 to 19, 2009, the Heads of State and Government embarked upon a new era of inter-American relations. The Summit focused on securing citizens&#x27; future by promoting human prosperity, energy security and environmental sustainability, underlying th importance of a process that began in 1994. 

The Sixth Summit of the Americas was held in Cartagena de Indias, Colombia on April 14-15, 2012, and its mandates focused on the integration of physical infrastructure in the Americas, solving poverty, inequality and inequity, disaster risk reduction and management, access to and use of information and communication technologies, and the implementation of policies for citizen security and the prevention of transnational organized crime. 

The Seventh Summit of the Americas was held in Panama City, Panama on April 10-11, 2015. 

The Eighth Summit of the Americas (Lima, April 13-14, 2018) was held under the leadership of the government of Peru. The Lima Commitment: &quot;Democratic Governance against Corruption&quot; was the first document of mandates adopted by Heads of State and Government at a Summit of the Americas since the Fourth Summit held in Mar del Plata, Argentina (2005). 

The Ninth Summit of the Americas was held in Los Angeles on June 6-8, 2022, during times of recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. The Heads of State and Government adopted five documents of mandates on health and resilience, democratic governance, energy transition, green future, and digital transformation.

=== Summit Implementation Review Group (SIRG) ===
The Summit Implementation Review Group (SIRG), is the core management body of the Summits Process and is composed of government officials of the countries of the hemisphere, which are represented in the SIRG by their appointed National Coordinators. 

The SIRG was created in 1995 and is presided over by the Chair of the Summit of the Americas Process. The Dominican Republic as the host of the X Summit, to be held in 2025, is the current chair of the SIRG. 

The SIRG meets on average 3 times a year, with at least one meeting held at the Ministerial level. The SIRG is responsible for reporting annually to the Foreign Ministers on progress achieved in fulfilling Summit Mandates. 

At the Quebec Summit in 2001, the SIRG and its Executive Council were charged with the responsibility of following-up, together with the support of the OAS Office of Summit Follow Up, which became the Secretariat of the Summit Process. 

=== Joint Summit Working Group (JSWG) ===
The Joint Summit Working Group (JSWG) coordinates the support of thirteen Inter-American and international institutions to the Summits Process. These institutions provide technical guidance to countries in the identification and negotiation of issues addressed in the Summits process. 

The JSWG also plans and carries out projects and initiatives to implement Summit commitments and supports Inter-American ministerial meetings and their linkages to the Summits process. The JSWG also participates in Summit policy dialogues to exchange ideas regarding policy approaches for the Summits process. 

The JSWG is chaired by the OAS Summit of the Americas Secretariat. The following institutions are members of the JSWG: 

* Organization of American States, Summit of the Americas Secretariat
* Pan American Health Organization (PAHO)
* Inter-American Institute for Cooperation on Agriculture (IICA)
* Inter-American Development Bank (IDB)
* Economic Commission on Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC)
* Central American Bank for Economic Integration (CABEI)
* Development Bank of Latin America and the Caribbean (CAF)
* The World Bank
* Caribbean Development Bank (CDB)
* International Organization for Migration (IOM)
* International Labor Organization (ILO)
* United Nations Development Programme (UNDP)
* Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD)

=== Social actors ===
Civil society organizations, indigenous peoples, youth, private sector, labor unions and other social actors play an essential role in the Summits Process. They provide recommendation on the thematic areas to the Member States in preparation for future Summits and assist in the implementation of initiatives in the development of the hemispheric agenda. 

At previous Summits, the Heads of State and Government recognized the importance of including social actors and encouraged governments to cooperate with social actors in the formulation and implementation of development policies and programs.

<doc id="366111" wikidata="Q1140935" url="?curid=366111" title="Shallow Hal">
<text>Shallow Hal is a 2001 American romantic comedy film starring Gwyneth Paltrow and Jack Black about a man who falls in love with a woman after being hypnotized into only seeing a person&#x27;s inner beauty. Directed by the Farrelly brothers, it was filmed in and around Charlotte, North Carolina as well as Sterling and Princeton, Massachusetts at Wachusett Mountain. The supporting cast features Jason Alexander, Joe Viterelli, and Susan Ward. &quot;Shallow Hal&quot; was released in theaters on November 9, 2001 by 20th Century Fox, and grossed $141 million against a $40 million budget.

== Plot ==
Harold &quot;Hal&quot; Larson spends his nights being rejected by beautiful women at night clubs with his friend Mauricio. He holds a steady job at JPS Funds, a financial institution run by president Steve Shanahan, but is dismayed after being denied a long-sought promotion. Hal is attracted to his neighbor Jill, who rejects him due to his shallow lifestyle. One day, Hal becomes trapped in an elevator with life coach Tony Robbins, who hypnotizes him into only seeing a person&#x27;s inner beauty. Hal, not realizing he has been hypnotized, later meets Steve&#x27;s morbidly obese daughter, Rosemary. Because of her kind and generous personality, Rosemary appears to Hal as a slender, beautiful trophy blonde and he is instantly smitten with her. Used to being overlooked due to her appearance, Rosemary initially interprets Hal&#x27;s interest as mockery, but begins to date him once she realizes his feelings for her are sincere.

Concerned by Hal&#x27;s new taste in women, Mauricio convinces Tony to give him the trigger phrase to undo the hypnosis, which is &quot;Shallow Hal wants a gal&quot;. During a dinner date, Rosemary tells Hal she has been asked by the Peace Corps to go on a 14-month mission in Kiribati. Mauricio phones Hal and says the trigger phrase, then arrives at the restaurant and drags Hal out before he can see the real Rosemary. Outside, Mauricio reveals the truth about Tony&#x27;s hypnotherapy. Hal does not believe him until he runs into Katrina, a woman who initially appeared beautiful to him, but whom he now sees in her true, physically unattractive state. Hal begins to avoid Rosemary, who becomes depressed as a result. Jill develops an interest in Hal, having observed him overcome his shallow nature through his relationship with Rosemary, and invites him to dinner. While on the date with Jill, Hal realizes he loves Rosemary, who has, coincidentally, arrived at the same restaurant with her family and sees the two sitting together. Assuming the worst, she leaves in tears. While heading to the nearest payphone, he walks right past Rosemary, not recognizing her; he then calls her to reassure her of his feelings. Confused and distraught, Rosemary insults and effectively breaks up with him.

Five days later, Steve informs Hal that Rosemary’s ex-boyfriend and Peace Corps partner, Ralph, wants to get back together with her. While seeking Rosemary out at the hospital where she volunteers, Hal encounters a young patient named Cadence whom he had previously seen as a perfect little girl due to the hypnosis, but now sees is covered in severe burn scars. This changes Hal&#x27;s views on outer beauty in general and inspires him to go after Rosemary. Mauricio admits that he stopped the hypnosis out of envy toward Hal&#x27;s happiness, and confesses that he has an inoperable vestigial tail which has prevented him from ever getting close to a woman. Hal convinces Mauricio to embrace his abnormality.

Hal heads to the Peace Corps recruiting office and confronts Ralph, believing he and Rosemary have gotten back together, though Ralph denies this and informs Hal that Rosemary&#x27;s parents are throwing her a farewell party. Hal, Mauricio, and Ralph arrive at Rosemary&#x27;s parents&#x27; home. Rosemary initially rebuffs Hal&#x27;s presence, but accepts his apology when Hal professes his love for her. Rosemary says she is still leaving on her Peace Corps mission, but Hal says he is coming with her, having just been sworn into the Peace Corps by Ralph&#x27;s friend Li&#x27;iBoy. Hal tries to carry Rosemary bridal-style to the car, but cannot lift her. Moved by his gesture and effort, she triumphantly carries him instead. As they drive off, Mauricio meets a woman who loves dogs, and the two walk off together as he wags his tail.

== Production ==

Writer Sean Moynihan is legally blind and was inspired by Tony Robbins to write the script. Earlier versions of the story did not include Robbins&#x27; character; instead, a psychic was responsible for Hal&#x27;s change of view.
In December 1999 Paltrow was in talks to star. The Farrelly brothers tried unsuccessfully to get Garry Shandling to star as Mauricio before Jason Alexander was cast. 

Production was moved up in order to get the film completed before July 1 and a threatened Screen Actors Guild strike.
Filming took place in Charlotte, North Carolina.

The Farrelly Brothers defended the movie and its plot to critics, arguing it was more than a mere &quot;fat joke&quot; type of movie and was instead one that had a strong message about &quot;inner beauty&quot;.

Gwyneth Paltrow played both roles, slim and fat Rosemary (except for a couple of close-up shots of fat Rosemary below the neck, which were played by her body double Ivy Snitzer), and had to wear a specially designed 25-pound fatsuit and prosthetic make-up. She later admitted that she did not enjoy partaking in production of the movie, in particular dreading having to wear the fat suit and makeup. The prosthetic make-up effects and body suits for Rosemary, Rosemary&#x27;s mother, and all of the secondary characters were designed and created by Tony Gardner and his company Alterian, Inc.

==Reception==
===Box office===
In its opening weekend at the U.S. box office, &quot;Shallow Hal&quot; grossed $22.5 million, opening at #2 behind &quot;Monsters, Inc.&quot;. It grossed a total of $141.1 million, of which $70.7 million was in the United States.

===Critical response===
On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a rating of 49%, based on 134 reviews, and an average rating of 5.5/10. The site&#x27;s critical consensus reads, &quot;While surprisingly sweeter and warm-hearted than previous Farrelly outings, &quot;Shallow Hal&quot; is also less funny and more bland&quot;. On Metacritic, it has a score of 48% based on reviews from 33 critics, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;C+&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times &quot; gave it 3 out of 4 and called it &quot;Often very funny, but it is also surprisingly moving at times&quot;.
A. O. Scott of &quot;The New York Times&quot; called it &quot;a series of fat jokes...[turned] into a tender fable and a winning love story&quot;.

Todd McCarthy of &quot;Variety&quot; wrote: &quot;With the relatively untested Black coming on awfully strong, the lack of directorial finesse lets the enterprise down, creating some clunky scenes and dead air where laughs might have been expected.&quot;

===Awards===
The film was nominated at the 2002 Teen Choice Awards as Choice Movie: Comedy and its leads were nominated Choice Movie: Comedy Actor (Jack Black) and Choice Movie: Comedy Actress (Gwyneth Paltrow).

==Home media==
&quot;Shallow Hal&quot; was released on VHS and DVD in July 2002, and topped the rental charts the week it was released. It also performed well on Pay-Per-View. Fox released the film only 30 (rather than 45) days after its debut on DVD and video, and it became the top performing PPV title of 2002.

<doc id="366112" wikidata="Q243257" url="?curid=366112" title="Chikungunya">
<text>Chikungunya is an infection caused by the &quot;Alphavirus chikungunya&quot; (CHIKV). The disease was first identified in 1952 in Tanzania and named based on the Kimakonde words for &quot;to become contorted&quot;. 

Symptoms include fever and joint pain. These typically occur two to twelve days after exposure. Other symptoms may include headache, muscle pain, joint swelling, and a rash. Symptoms usually improve within a week; however, occasionally the joint pain may last for months or years. The risk of death is around 1 in 1,000. The very young, old, and those with other health problems are at risk of more severe disease.

The virus is spread between people by two types of mosquitos: &quot;Aedes albopictus&quot; and &quot;Aedes aegypti&quot;, which mainly bite during the day. The virus may circulate within a number of animals, including birds and rodents. Diagnosis is done by either testing the blood for viral RNA or antibodies to the virus. The symptoms can be mistaken for those of dengue fever and Zika fever, which are spread by the mosquitoes. It is believed most people become immune after a single infection.

The best means of prevention are overall mosquito control and the avoidance of bites in areas where the disease is common. This may be partly achieved by decreasing mosquitoes&#x27; access to water, as well as the use of insect repellent and mosquito nets. In November 2023 the USFDA approved an adults-only vaccine (Ixchiq) for prevention of the disease. Once infected and symptomatic, recommendations to patients should include rest, fluids, and medications to help with fever and joint pain.

In 2014, more than a million suspected cases occurred globally. While the disease is endemic in Africa and Asia, outbreaks have been reported in Europe and the Americas since the 2000s; in 2014, an outbreak was reported in Florida in the continental United States, but as of 2016 there were no further locally-acquired cases. 

==Signs and symptoms==
Around 85% of people infected with the chikungunya virus experience symptoms, typically beginning with a sudden high fever above . The fever is soon followed by severe muscle and joint pain. Pain usually affects multiple joints in the arms and legs, and is symmetric – i.e. if one elbow is affected, the other is as well. People with chikungunya also frequently experience headache, back pain, nausea, and fatigue. Around half of those affected develop a rash, with reddening and sometimes small bumps on the palms, foot soles, torso, and face. For some, the rash remains constrained to a small part of the body; for others, the rash can be extensive, covering more than 90% of the skin. Some people experience gastrointestinal issues, with abdominal pain and vomiting. Others experience eye problems, namely sensitivity to light, conjunctivitis, and pain behind the eye. This first set of symptoms – called the &quot;acute phase&quot; of chikungunya – lasts around a week, after which most symptoms resolve on their own.

Many people continue to have symptoms after the &quot;acute phase&quot; resolves, termed the &quot;post-acute phase&quot; for symptoms lasting three weeks to three months, and the &quot;chronic stage&quot; for symptoms lasting longer than three months. In both cases, the lasting symptoms tend to be joint pains: arthritis, tenosynovitis, and/or bursitis. If the affected person has pre-existing joint issues, these tend to worsen. Overuse of a joint can result in painful swelling, stiffness, nerve damage, and neuropathic pain. Typically the joint pain improves with time; however, the chronic stage can last anywhere from a few months to several years.

Joint pain is reported in 87–98% of cases, and nearly always occurs in more than one joint, though joint swelling is uncommon. Typically the affected joints are located in both arms and legs. Joints are more likely to be affected if they have previously been damaged by disorders such as arthritis. Pain most commonly occurs in peripheral joints, such as the wrists, ankles, and joints of the hands and feet as well as some of the larger joints, typically the shoulders, elbows and knees. Pain may also occur in the muscles or ligaments. In more than half of cases, normal activity is limited by significant fatigue and pain. Infrequently, inflammation of the eyes may occur in the form of iridocyclitis, or uveitis, and retinal lesions may occur. Temporary damage to the liver may occur.

People with chikungunya occasionally develop neurologic disorders, most frequently swelling or degeneration of the brain, inflammation or degeneration of the myelin sheaths around neurons, Guillain–Barré syndrome, acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, hypotonia (in newborns), and issues with visual processing. In particularly rare cases, people may develop behavioral changes, seizures, irritation of the cerebellum or meninges, oculomotor nerve palsy, or paralysis of the eye muscles.

Newborns are susceptible to particularly severe effects of Chikungunya infection. Signs of infection typically begin with fever, rash, and swelling in the extremities. Around half of newborns have a mild case of the disease that resolves on its own; the other half have severe disease with inflammation of the brain and seizures. In severe cases, affected newborns may also have issues with bleeding and blood flow and problems with heart function.

In addition to newborns, the elderly, and those with diabetes, heart disease, liver and kidney diseases, and human immunodeficiency virus infection tend to have more severe cases of Chikungunya. Around 1 to 5 in 1,000 people with symptomatic Chikungunya die of the disease.

==Cause==
===Virology===
&quot;Chikungunya virus&quot; (CHIKV), is a member of the genus &quot;Alphavirus&quot;, and family &quot;Togaviridae&quot;. It was first isolated in 1953 in Tanzania and is an RNA virus with a positive-sense single-stranded genome of about 11.6kb. It is a member of the Semliki Forest virus complex and is closely related to Ross River virus, O&#x27;nyong&#x27;nyong virus, and Semliki Forest virus. Because it is transmitted by arthropods, namely mosquitoes, it can also be referred to as an arbovirus (arthropod-borne virus). In the United States, it is classified as a category B priority pathogen, and work requires biosafety level III precautions.

Three genotypes of this virus have been described, each with a distinct genotype and antigenic character: West African, East/Central/South African, and Asian genotypes. The Asian lineage originated in 1952 and has subsequently split into two lineages – India (Indian Ocean Lineage) and South East Asian clades. This virus was first reported in the Americas in 2014. Phylogenetic investigations have shown two strains in Brazil – the Asian and East/Central/South African types – and that the Asian strain arrived in the Caribbean (most likely from Oceania) in about March 2013. The rate of molecular evolution was estimated to have a mean rate of 5 × 10−4 substitutions per site per year (95% higher probability density 2.9–7.9 × 10−4).

===Transmission===
Chikungunya is generally transmitted from mosquitoes to humans. Less common modes of transmission include vertical transmission, which is transmission from mother to child during pregnancy or at birth. Transmission via infected blood products and through organ donation is also theoretically possible during times of outbreak, though no cases have yet been documented. The incubation period ranges from one to twelve days and is most typically three to seven.

Chikungunya is related to mosquitoes, their environments, and human behavior. The adaptation of mosquitoes to the changing climate of North Africa around 5,000 years ago made them seek out environments where humans stored water. Human habitation and the mosquitoes&#x27; environments were then very closely connected. During epidemics, humans are the reservoir of the virus. Because high amounts of virus are present in the blood at the beginning of acute infection, the virus can be spread from a viremic human to a mosquito, and back to a human. During other times, monkeys, birds, and other vertebrates have served as reservoirs. 

Chikungunya is spread through bites from &quot;Aedes&quot; mosquitoes, and the species &quot;A. aegypti&quot; was identified as the most common vector, though the virus has recently been associated with many other species, including &quot;A. albopictus&quot;. Research by the Pasteur Institute in Paris has suggested &quot;Chikungunya virus&quot; strains in the 2005–2006 Reunion Island outbreak incurred a mutation that facilitated transmission by the Asian tiger mosquito (&quot;A. albopictus&quot;). Other species potentially able to transmit &quot;Chikungunya virus&quot; include &quot;Ae. furcifer-taylori&quot;, &quot;Ae. africanus&quot;, and &quot;Ae. luteocephalus&quot;.

==Mechanism==
&quot;Chikungunya virus&quot; is passed to humans when a bite from an infected mosquito breaks the skin and introduces the virus into the body. The pathogenesis of chikungunya infection in humans is still poorly understood, despite recent outbreaks. It appears that &quot;in vitro&quot;, &quot;Chikungunya virus&quot; is able to replicate in human epithelial and endothelial cells, primary fibroblasts, and monocyte-derived macrophages. Viral replication is highly cytopathic, but susceptible to type-I and -II interferon. &quot;In vivo&quot;, in studies using living cells, chikungunya virus appears to replicate in fibroblasts, skeletal muscle progenitor cells, and myofibers.

The type-1 interferon response is important in the host&#x27;s response to chikungunya infection. Upon infection with chikungunya, the host&#x27;s fibroblasts produce type-1 alpha and beta interferon (IFN-α and IFN-β). In mouse studies, deficiencies in INF-1 in mice exposed to the virus cause increased morbidity and mortality. The chikungunya-specific upstream components of the type-1 interferon pathway involved in the host&#x27;s response to chikungunya infection are still unknown. Nonetheless, mouse studies suggest that IPS-1 is an important factor, and that IRF3 and IRF7 are important in an age-dependent manner. Mouse studies also suggest that chikungunya evades host defenses and counters the type-I interferon response by producing NS2, a nonstructural protein that degrades RBP1 and turns off the host cell&#x27;s ability to transcribe DNA. NS2 interferes with the JAK-STAT signaling pathway and prevents STAT from becoming phosphorylated.

In the acute phase of chikungunya, the virus is typically present in the areas where symptoms present, specifically skeletal muscles, and joints. In the chronic phase, it is suggested that viral persistence (the inability of the body to entirely rid itself of the virus), lack of clearance of the antigen, or both, contribute to joint pain. The inflammation response during both the acute and chronic phases of the disease results in part from interactions between the virus and monocytes and macrophages. &quot;Chikungunya virus&quot; disease in humans is associated with elevated serum levels of specific cytokines and chemokines. High levels of specific cytokines have been linked to more severe acute disease: interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-1β, RANTES, monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1), monokine induced by gamma interferon (MIG), and interferon gamma-induced protein 10 (IP-10). Cytokines may also contribute to chronic &quot;Chikungunya virus&quot; disease, as persistent joint pain has been associated with elevated levels of IL-6 and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF). In those with chronic symptoms, a mild elevation of C-reactive protein (CRP) has been observed, suggesting ongoing chronic inflammation. However, there is little evidence linking chronic &quot;Chikungunya virus&quot; disease and the development of autoimmunity.

===Viral replication===
The virus consists of four nonstructural proteins and three structural proteins. The structural proteins are the capsid and two envelope glycoproteins: E1 and E2, which form heterodimeric spikes on the viron surface. E2 binds to cellular receptors in order to enter the host cell through receptor-mediated endocytosis. E1 contains a fusion peptide which, when exposed to the acidity of the endosome in eukaryotic cells, dissociates from E2 and initiates membrane fusion that allows the release of nucleocapsids into the host cytoplasm, promoting infection. The mature virion contains 240 heterodimeric spikes of E2/E1, which after release, bud on the surface of the infected cell, where they are released by exocytosis to infect other cells.

==Diagnosis==
Chikungunya is diagnosed on the basis of clinical, epidemiological, and laboratory criteria. Clinically, acute onset of high fever and severe joint pain would lead to suspicion of chikungunya. Epidemiological criteria consist of whether the individual has traveled to or spent time in an area in which chikungunya is present within the last twelve days (i.e.) the potential incubation period). Laboratory criteria include a decreased lymphocyte count consistent with viremia. However a definitive laboratory diagnosis can be accomplished through viral isolation, RT-PCR, or serological diagnosis.

The differential diagnosis may include other mosquito-borne diseases, such as dengue or malaria, or other infections such as influenza. Chronic recurrent polyarthralgia occurs in at least 20% of chikungunya patients one year after infection, whereas such symptoms are uncommon in dengue.

Virus isolation provides the most definitive diagnosis, but takes one to two weeks for completion and must be carried out in biosafety level III laboratories. The technique involves exposing specific cell lines to samples from whole blood and identifying &quot;Chikungunya virus&quot;-specific responses. RT-PCR using nested primer pairs is used to amplify several chikungunya-specific genes from whole blood, generating thousands to millions of copies of the genes to identify them. RT-PCR can also quantify the viral load in the blood. Using RT-PCR, diagnostic results can be available in one to two days. Serological diagnosis requires a larger amount of blood than the other methods and uses an ELISA assay to measure chikungunya-specific IgM levels in the blood serum. One advantage offered by serological diagnosis is that serum IgM is detectable from 5 days to months after the onset of symptoms, but drawbacks are that results may require two to three days, and false positives can occur with infection due to other related viruses, such as o&#x27;nyong&#x27;nyong virus and Semliki Forest virus.

Presently, there is no specific way to test for chronic signs and symptoms associated with Chikungunya fever although nonspecific laboratory findings such as C reactive protein and elevated cytokines can correlate with disease activity.

==Prevention==

Although an approved vaccine exists, the most effective means of prevention are protection against contact with disease-carrying mosquitoes and controlling mosquito populations by limiting their habitat. Mosquito control focuses on eliminating the standing water where mosquitos lay eggs and develop as larvae; if elimination of the standing water is not possible, insecticides or biological control agents can be added. Methods of protection against contact with mosquitos include using insect repellents with substances such as DEET, icaridin, PMD (p-menthane-3,8-diol, a substance derived from the lemon eucalyptus tree), or ethyl butylacetylaminopropionate (IR3535). However, increasing insecticide resistance presents a challenge to chemical control methods.

Wearing bite-proof long sleeves and trousers also offers protection, and garments can be treated with pyrethroids, a class of insecticides that often has repellent properties. Vaporized pyrethroids (for example in mosquito coils) are also insect repellents. As infected mosquitoes often feed and rest inside homes, securing screens on windows and doors will help to keep mosquitoes out of the house. In the case of the day-active &quot;A. aegypti&quot; and &quot;A. albopictus&quot;, however, this will have only a limited effect, since many contacts between the mosquitoes and humans occur outdoors.

===Vaccination===
==Treatment==
Currently, no specific treatment for chikungunya is available. Supportive care is recommended, and symptomatic treatment of fever and joint swelling includes the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as naproxen, non-aspirin analgesics such as paracetamol (acetaminophen) and fluids. Aspirin is not recommended due to the increased risk of bleeding. Despite anti-inflammatory effects, corticosteroids are not recommended during the acute phase of disease, as they may cause immunosuppression and worsen infection.

Passive immunotherapy has potential benefits in the treatment of chikungunya. Studies in animals using passive immunotherapy have been effective, and clinical studies using passive immunotherapy in those particularly vulnerable to severe infection are currently in progress. Passive immunotherapy involves administration of anti-CHIKV hyperimmune human intravenous antibodies (immunoglobulins) to those exposed to a high risk of chikungunya infection. No antiviral treatment for &quot;Chikungunya virus&quot; is currently available, though testing has shown several medications to be effective &quot;in vitro&quot;.

===Chronic arthritis===
In those who have more than two weeks of arthritis, ribavirin may be useful. The effect of chloroquine is not clear. It does not appear to help acute disease, but tentative evidence indicates it might help those with chronic arthritis. Steroids do not appear to be an effective treatment. NSAIDs and simple analgesics can be used to provide partial symptom relief in most cases. Methotrexate, a drug used in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, has been shown to have a benefit in treating inflammatory polyarthritis resulting from chikungunya, though the drug mechanism for improving viral arthritis is unclear.

==Prognosis==
The mortality rate of chikungunya is slightly less than 1 in 1000. Those over the age of 65, neonates, and those with underlying chronic medical problems are most likely to have severe complications. Neonates are vulnerable as it is possible to vertically transmit chikungunya from mother to infant during delivery, which results in high rates of morbidity, as infants lack fully developed immune systems. The likelihood of prolonged symptoms or chronic joint pain is increased with increased age and prior rheumatological disease.

==Epidemiology==


Historically, chikungunya has been present mostly in the developing world. The disease causes an estimated 3 million infections each year. Epidemics in the Indian Ocean, Pacific Islands, and in the Americas, continue to change the distribution of the disease.
In Africa, chikungunya is spread by a sylvatic cycle in which the virus largely cycles between other non-human primates, small mammals, and mosquitos between human outbreaks. During outbreaks, due to the high concentration of virus in the blood of those in the acute phase of infection, the virus can circulate from humans to mosquitoes and back to humans. The transmission of the pathogen between humans and mosquitoes that exist in urban environments was established on multiple occasions from strains occurring on the eastern half of Africa in non-human primate hosts. This emergence and spread beyond Africa may have started as early as the 18th century. Currently, available data does not indicate whether the introduction of chikungunya into Asia occurred in the 19th century or more recently, but this epidemic Asian strain causes outbreaks in India and continues to circulate in Southeast Asia. In Africa, outbreaks were typically tied to heavy rainfall causing increased mosquito population. In recent outbreaks in urban centers, the virus has spread by circulating between humans and mosquitoes.

Global rates of chikungunya infection are variable, depending on outbreaks. When chikungunya was first identified in 1952, it had a low-level circulation in West Africa, with infection rates linked to rainfall. Beginning in the 1960s, periodic outbreaks were documented in Asia and Africa. However, since 2005, following several decades of relative inactivity, chikungunya has re-emerged and caused large outbreaks in Africa, Asia, and the Americas. In India, for instance, chikungunya re-appeared following 32 years of absence of viral activity. Outbreaks have occurred in Europe, the Caribbean, and South America, areas in which chikungunya was not previously transmitted. Local transmission has also occurred in the United States and Australia, countries in which the virus was previously unknown. In 2005, an outbreak on the island of Réunion was the largest then documented, with an estimated 266,000 cases on an island with a population of approximately 770,000. In a 2006 outbreak, India reported 1.25 million suspected cases. Chikungunya was introduced to the Americas in 2013, first detected on the French island of Saint Martin, and for the next two years in the Americas, 1,118,763 suspected cases and 24,682 confirmed cases were reported by the PAHO.

An analysis of the genetic code of &quot;Chikungunya virus&quot; suggests that the increased severity of the 2005–present outbreak may be due to a change in the genetic sequence which altered the E1 segment of the virus&#x27; viral coat protein, a variant called E1-A226V. This mutation potentially allows the virus to multiply more easily in mosquito cells. The change allows the virus to use the Asian tiger mosquito (an invasive species) as a vector in addition to the more strictly tropical main vector, &quot;Aedes aegypti&quot;. Enhanced transmission of &quot;Chikungunya virus&quot; by &quot;A. albopictus&quot; could mean an increased risk for outbreaks in other areas where the Asian tiger mosquito is present. &quot;A albopictus&quot; is an invasive species which has spread through Europe, the Americas, the Caribbean, Africa, and the Middle East.

After the detection of zika virus in Brazil in April 2015, the first ever in the Western Hemisphere, it is now thought some chikungunya and dengue cases could in fact be zika virus cases or coinfections.

==History==

The disease was first described by Marion Robinson and W.H.R. Lumsden in a pair of 1955 papers, following an outbreak in 1952 on the Makonde Plateau, along the border between Mozambique and Tanganyika (the mainland part of modern-day Tanzania). Since then outbreaks have occurred occasionally in Africa, South Asia, and Southeast Asia; recent outbreaks have spread the disease over a wider range.

The first recorded outbreak may have been in 1779. This is in agreement with the molecular genetics evidence that suggests it evolved around the year 1700.

According to the original paper by Lumsden, the term &#x27;chikungunya&#x27; is derived from the Makonde root verb &quot;kungunyala&quot;, meaning to dry up or become contorted. In concurrent research, Robinson glossed the Makonde term more specifically as &quot;that which bends up&quot;. It is understood to refer to the contorted posture of people affected with severe joint pain and arthritic symptoms associated with this disease. Subsequent authors overlooked the references to the Makonde language and assumed the term to have been derived from Swahili, the &quot;lingua franca&quot; of the region. The erroneous attribution to Swahili has been repeated in numerous print sources. Erroneous spellings of the name of the disease are also in common use.

==Research==
Chikungunya is one of more than a dozen agents researched as a potential biological weapon.

This disease is part of the group of neglected tropical diseases.

<text>St Stephen&#x27;s House is a theological college in Oxford, England affiliated with the Church of England. From 2003 to 2023 it was a permanent private hall of the University of Oxford. 

The college typically matriculates a small number of undergraduate students (just 5 in the academic year 2022–23), but has graduate students in a number of fields including theology, Byzantine studies, education, and music. Between 2003 and 2023, roughly one quarter of the students were pursuing professional training as classroom teachers, and another quarter professional theological and ministerial training as priests, with the other half following a diverse range of studies and research, many remotely or on a flexible basis.

The hall is rooted in and has a history of Anglo-Catholicism.

==History==

St Stephen&#x27;s House was founded in 1876 by members of the Oxford Movement within the Church of England, and was originally located in the very centre of Oxford, on what is today the site of the New Bodleian Library. Its principal founder was Edward King, Regius Professor of Moral and Pastoral Theology at Oxford and later Bishop of Lincoln.

In 1919 the college relocated to new buildings in Norham Gardens, near the University Parks and Lady Margaret Hall. The college moved again in 1980, having outgrown its earlier buildings, and now occupies the former Anglican Monastery of the Society of St. John the Evangelist (Cowley Fathers).

The college was an &quot;Associated Institution&quot; of the University of Oxford, able to matriculate students in the fields of theology and philosophy, until 2003, when it became a permanent private hall of the university. Since September 2023, it is no longer a permanent private hall, but remains an Anglican theological college. This decision was taken because an increasing proportion of students at the college now study for their qualifications at Durham University via the Church of England Common Awards.

==Buildings==
The college is located in east Oxford, between the Iffley and Cowley Roads (to west and east) and James Street and Marston Street (to north and south), with entrances onto all these roads. Although there are some modern buildings, notably the Moberly Close residential accommodation building, most of the college buildings are older, and have listed status.

Grade I listing applies to the Church of St John the Evangelist, which is the principal college chapel, and an arts centre, as well as housing some teaching and research facilities in its sacristies and song school. Constructed in 1894–1896 to a design by George Frederick Bodley (1827–1907), it has held grade I listing since 1968. The castellated west tower was added in 1902. The east, west, and north-east windows contain stained glass designed by C. E. Kempe (1837–1907) and made in about 1900.
The Church also contains painted Stations of the Cross by the late Pre-Raphaelite artist, Edward Arthur Fellowes Prynne, created for the Cowley Fathers between 1918 and 1921.
Grade II listing was applied to the bulk of the college&#x27;s other central buildings in 1992. This listing includes the college&#x27;s main cloister built in 1899 to a design by Bodley, the three lesser cloisters, the Benson Building (residential and teaching accommodation built late nineteenth century, probably designed by Clapton Crabb Rolfe), the King Building (residential, teaching, and administrative accommodation, including the college refectory, the library, and the common room, also designed by Bodley), and the two smaller chapels – the Founders Chapel, and the Ninian Comper designed House Chapel.

St John&#x27;s Church (and sometimes also the college cloisters) has been since 2012 the performance and display venue for SJE Arts Oxford, a society promoting performing arts and music, and which organises an annual summer choral festival at the college site.

The Song School, once the music department of SSJE, and later the residence of the college&#x27;s vice principal, has since 2008 housed the Centre for Muslim-Christian Studies, Oxford, an independent body whose senior teaching and research staff are mostly current or former members of the Faculty of Theology and Religion, University of Oxford.

==Arms==
In 2020, St Stephen&#x27;s House was granted by the College of Arms the current arms &quot;Per chevron Gules and Sable in chief two Cross crosslets and in base a Celestial Crown Or&quot; and badge &quot;A Cross Crosslet Or surmounted by a closed Book Gules leaved Argent and charged with a key wards upwards Or&quot;. The badge is used on the college sports kit.

Prior to this, the college used the assumed arms &quot;Gules a Celestial Crown between three Bezants two and one Or, on a chief Sable an Apostolic Eagle between two Crosses crosslet Or&quot;.

<doc id="366120" wikidata="Q861618" url="?curid=366120" title="Naniwa-ku, Osaka">
<text>is one of 24 wards of Osaka, Japan. It has an area of 4.37 km2, and a population of 51,567.

== General information ==
Largely a residential area itself, Naniwa-ku is adjacent to and has in recent years blurred into the Namba district, which is south Osaka&#x27;s transport hub and centre of commerce, entertainment, shopping, and culture.

Naniwa retains significant Burakumin and Korean communities. The plight and struggle of both communities in Japan is represented in Liberty Osaka (Osaka Human Rights Museum).

Almost the entire ward was decimated in air attacks during bombing in March 1945. Few buildings pre-dating World War II remain.

== Attractions ==
Naniwa is the site of a number of well-known commercial areas like Nipponbashi, where Capcom and SNK are headquartered. Locally known as Den Den Town (Electric City), Nipponbashi was traditionally a concentration for Osaka&#x27;s electrical appliance outlets, though the emergence of several large electrical department stores over in recent years has seen its shop space make a gradual shift away from the electrical appliance sector. Directly to its south is Shin Sekai (New World), an entertainment district famous for the Tsutenkaku Tower and Janjan Alley.

Amongst Naniwa&#x27;s sites is the Imamiya Ebisu Shrine, which sponsors the lively Toka Ebisu Festival. Naniwa is the site of the Osaka Prefectural Gymnasium (&quot;Osaka-furitsu taiiku-kaikan&quot;), where the Grand Sumo Tournament is held in March (&quot;Ozumo Sangatsu Basho&quot;) and Liberty Osaka - the Osaka Human Rights Museum. Naniwa also contains the massive modern shopping, dining, and entertainment complex, Namba Parks.

<doc id="366124" wikidata="Q520170" url="?curid=366124" title="Elephantine papyri and ostraca">
<text>The Elephantine Papyri and Ostraca consist of thousands of documents from the Egyptian border fortresses of Elephantine and Aswan, which yielded hundreds of papyri and ostraca in hieratic and demotic Egyptian, Aramaic, Koine Greek, Latin and Coptic, spanning a period of 100 years in the 5th to 4th centuries BCE. The documents include letters and legal contracts from family and other archives and are thus an invaluable source of knowledge for scholars of varied disciplines such as epistolography, law, society, religion, language, and onomastics. The Elephantine documents include letters and legal contracts from family and other archives: divorce documents, the manumission of enslaved people, and other business. The dry soil of Upper Egypt preserved the documents.

Hundreds of these Elephantine papyri span 100 years, during the 5th to 4th centuries BCE. Legal documents and a cache of letters survived, turned up on the local &quot;grey market&quot; of antiquities starting in the late 19th century, and were scattered into several Western collections.

A number of the Aramaic papyri document the Jewish community among soldiers stationed at Elephantine under Achaemenid rule, 495–399 BCE. The so-called &quot;Passover Letter&quot; of 419 BCE (discovered in 1907), which appears to give instructions for the observance of the Festival of Unleavened Bread (though Passover itself is not mentioned in the extant text), is in the Egyptian Museum of Berlin.

The standard reference collection of the Aramaic documents from Elephantine is the &quot;Textbook of Aramaic Documents from Ancient Egypt&quot;.

==Discovery, excavation, collections and publications==
Between 1815 and 1904, all discoveries were unprovenanced and came via informal discoveries and antiquities dealers; only later were they understood by scholars to have originated from Elephantine. The first known such papyri were bought by Giovanni Belzoni and Bernardino Drovetti; a number of Aramaic letters and a demotic letter were presented by Belzoni to the Musei Civici di Padova in 1819 and three hieratic pieces from Drovetti – and the Turin Aramaic Papyrus – were deposited at the new Museo Egizio in Turin in 1824.

Formal excavation of the mound at Elephantine Island began in 1904, and continued for the next seven years. Further finds were discovered through the first half of the 20th century.

The mode of burial of the documents remains unknown, but they are thought to have been stored laterally and horizontally in close proximity to each other.

===Major discoveries===
The major Elephantine collections consist of discoveries from the end of the 19th and start of the 20th century, and these collections are now in museums in Berlin, Brooklyn, Cairo, London, Munich, and Paris. The largest collection is in the Berlin State Museums with texts in each of the languages.
* 1875–76: The British Museum acquired two Aramaic and one Coptic ostraca from the Rev. Greville John Chester. The two Aramaic ostraca are now known as CIS II 138 (also known as NSI 74, KAI 271 and British Museum E14219) and CIS II 139 (British Museum E14420)
* 1890s: From Luxor via the dealer Abd el-Megid was purchased a bilingual family archive which included three Greek legal texts and a demotic matrimonial document
* 1893: American collector Charles Edwin Wilbour acquired a number of papyri, including 12 Aramaic documents from the Anani archive. Wilbour’s family passed the documents to the Brooklyn Museum a few decades after his death, and they were published in 1953. It was at this time that scholars concluded that &quot;Wilbour had acquired the first Elephantine papyri&quot;.
* 1898–99: Richard August Reitzenstein and Wilhelm Spiegelberg acquired the first identifiable Aramaic papyrus from Elephantine in 1898–99. He donated it to what is now the National and University Library in Strasbourg.
* 1899: The Papyrussammlung und Papyrusmuseum of Vienna acquired four demotic documents, probably via Jakob Krall
* 1901: Archibald Henry Sayce acquired a fragmented Aramaic papyrus and three Aramaic ostraca, which he donated to the Bodleian Library in Oxford 
* 1901–02: large collection of Greek and demotic papyri, including an IOU of a blacksmith from Syene, were acquired by Théodore Reinach; this collection is now in the Sorbonne.
* Early 1900s: Over a number of years, Baroness Mary Cecil and Robert Mond acquired from dealers in Aswan a total of 11 Aramaic papyri from the Mibtahiah archive. These were donated to the Egyptian Museum in Cairo, which retained nine; one was subsequently acquired by the Bodleian. Their high profile publication in 1906 by Sayce and Cowley catalyzed expeditions for more Aramaic papyri. They were originally thought to have been found in Aswan rather than on the Elephantine island.
* 1904: The first (brief) excavation on the Elephantine mound took place, after Sayce encouraged Gaston Maspero to excavate to search there for more Aramaic texts. No Aramaic texts were found, but a number of Greek and demotic fragments were. 
* Early 1906 until 1908: the German expedition was assigned to excavate the Western side of the mound; following Otto Rubensohn having been told by local Egyptians that it was the find spot of the recently discovered Aramaic papyri. The expedition worked for three seasons, two under the direction of Rubensohn and the third under Friedrich Zucker. The daily logs reported the discovery of papyri and ostraca, but made no record of their find-spots; the report was published by Hans Wolfgang Müller in 1980–82. The Aramaic, and some Greek, papyri were well published, but most of the demotic, hieratic, and Coptic texts were not. The Demotic and Greek papyri were found early on. The first Aramaic papyri were discovered on New Years day, 1907 in the rubble of a room at the northern edge of the mound, 0.5m beneath the surface; this was found to be part of an &quot;Aramaic quarter”, a housing complex which yielded numerous Aramaic papyri. The three most significant of these Aramaic documents were published in 1907 by Eduard Sachau. Many of these discoveries are now in the Berlin State Museums; however, between 1907–12 ten Greek and demotic pieces, and many further Aramaic papyri, were transferred to the Egyptian Museum in Cairo.
* Late 1906 until 1911: following the German successes, the French were assigned to excavate the eastern side of the mound. There were four campaigns, the first two under Charles Clermont-Ganneau, the third under Joseph Étienne Gautier, and the fourth under Jean Clédat. Daily records were kept; these were deposited in the Académie de Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres in the Institut de France in Paris and some parts have been published. The excavations discovered hundreds of Aramaic, demotic, Greek, Coptic and Arabic ostraca; these are now held at the Egyptian Museum in Cairo and the Académie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres in Paris. It also discovered five Greek papyri, and a hieratic papyrus now at the Louvre. 
* 1907: The Byzantine &quot;Patermouthis archive&quot; of approximately 30 documents was acquired in two halves: Robert de Rustafjaell acquired half in Luxor for the British Museum in 1907, and Friedrich Zucker acquired half in Cairo for the Bavarian State Library in Munich in 1908. Coptic papyri acquired by Rustafjaell at the same time are now in the British Library.
* 1910–11: A batch of Arabic papyri were acquired by the State Library of Hamburg
* 1926: Bernard P. Grenfell and Francis W. Kelsey acquired seventy-seven Greek papyri, including one from Elephantine, for the University of Wisconsin, Madison.
* 1945: Sami Gabri discovered the Hermopolis Aramaic papyri in Tuna el-Gebel (Hermopolis West): eight Aramaic letters which were deposited in the Department of Archaeology of the University of Cairo.

===Individual finds attributed to Elephantine===
Numerous smaller finds have been attributed to Elephantine:
* 1815–19: a number of Aramaic letters and a demotic letter were presented by Giovanni Belzoni to the Musei Civici di Padova in 1819
* 1817–18: &quot;Papyrus Bibliothèque Nationale&quot;: Bibliothèque Nationale, Butehamun correspondence letter bought by Frédéric Cailliaud
* 1819 &quot;Papyrus Edmonstone&quot;: A Greek manumission document was acquired in 1819 by Sir Archibald Edmonstone and is still in the hands of a private collector.
* 1821: &quot;Papyrus Paris&quot;: Bibliothèque Nationale, a Greek conveyance document from a traveler named Casati.
* 1824: &quot;Turin Aramaic Papyrus&quot;: acquired by Bernardino Drovetti and donated to the new Museo Egizio in Turin in 1824, a hieratic charge sheet against the Elephantine Khnum priests. Donated together with two other hieratic letters from the Butehamun correspondence probably sent from Elephantine. 
* 1828: &quot;Papyrus Leiden&quot;: Giovanni Anastasi acquired, allegedly at Philae but presumably at Elephantine, on behalf of the Rijksmuseum van Oudheden in Leiden, a 5th century Greek petition to Emperor Theodosius.
* 1862: &quot;Papyrus Valençay&quot;: A Ramesside hieratic letter from the collection of the Duke of Valençay, now in the private collection of Jean Morel in the Château de Fins, Dun-le-Poëlier. It may have been originally purchased in 1862–63 by Count Eustachy Tyszkiewicz.
* 1881: &quot;Papyrus Dodgson&quot;: In January, 1881 Elkanah Armitage acquired a demotic papyrus on Elephantine which he presented to Aquila Dodgson; it was subsequently passed in 1932 to the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford.
* 1887: The &quot;Dream ostracon&quot; (CIS II 137, also known as NSI 73 and KAI 270) is brought back from Elephantine by Adolf Erman

* 1914: Sayce gave the Bodleian Library a Coptic ostracon
* 1920: James Henry Breasted purchased from Mohareb Todrous at Luxor for the Oriental Institute of the University of Chicago an Arabic reddish brown leather parchment.
* 1927: &quot;Papyrus Lob&quot;: Spiegelberg acquired for the Staatliche Sammlung Agyptischer Kunst in Munich a demotic papyrus which became known by the name of the benefactor Dr. James Lob.
* 1930: The Bristol Museum and Art Gallery acquired a Coptic ostracon from Francis Fox Tuckett
* Early 1930&#x27;s: Berlin State Museums acquired a unique hieratic leather document.

==Jewish documents==
=== Historical significance ===

The Elephantine papyri pre-date all extant manuscripts of the Hebrew Bible, and thus give scholars a very important glimpse at how Judaism was practiced in Egypt during the fifth century BCE, as they seem to show evidence of the existence in c. 400 BCE of a polytheistic sect of Jews. It is widely agreed that this Elephantine community originated in the mid-seventh or mid-sixth centuries BCE, likely as a result of Judean and Samaritan refugees fleeing into Egypt during the times of Assyrian and Babylonian invasions. They seem to have had no knowledge of a written Torah or the narratives described therein.

Also important is the fact that the papyri document the existence of a small Jewish temple at Elephantine, which possessed altars for incense offerings and animal sacrifices, as late as 411 BCE. Such a temple would be in clear violation of Deuteronomic law, which stipulates that no Jewish temple may be constructed outside of Jerusalem. Furthermore, the papyri show that the Jews at Elephantine sent letters to the high priest in Jerusalem asking for his support in re-building their temple, which seems to suggest that the priests of the Jerusalem Temple were not enforcing Deuteronomic law at that time. Cowley notes that their petition expressed their pride at having a temple to Ya&#x27;u (no other god is mentioned in the petition) and gave no suggestion that their temple could be heretical.

Upon first examination, this appears to contradict commonly accepted models of the development of Jewish religion and the dating of the Hebrew scriptures, which posit that monotheism and the Torah should have already been well-established by the time these papyri were written. Most scholars explain this apparent discrepancy by theorizing that the Elephantine Jews represented an isolated remnant of Jewish religious practices from earlier centuries, or that the Torah had only recently been promulgated at that time.

Niels Peter Lemche, Philippe Wajdenbaum, Russell Gmirkin, and Thomas L. Thompson have argued that the Elephantine papyri demonstrate that monotheism and the Torah could not have been established in Jewish culture before 400 BCE, and that the Torah was therefore likely written in the Hellenistic period, in the third or fourth centuries BCE.

=== Jewish temple at Elephantine ===

The Jews had their own temple to Yahweh which functioned alongside that of the Egyptian god Khnum. Along with Yahweh, other deities – ʿAnat Betel and Asham Bethel – seem to have been worshiped by these Jews, evincing polytheistic beliefs. Other scholars argue that these theonyms are merely hypostases of Yahweh, and dispute the idea that the Elephantine Jews were polytheists.

Excavation work done in 1967 revealed the remains of the Jewish colony centered on a small temple.
The &quot;Petition to Bagoas&quot; (Sayce-Cowley collection) is a letter written in 407 BCE to Bagoas, the Persian governor of Judea, appealing for assistance in rebuilding the Jewish temple in Elephantine, which had recently been badly damaged by an anti-Jewish rampage on the part of a segment of the Elephantine community.

In the course of this appeal, the Jewish inhabitants of Elephantine speak of the antiquity of the damaged temple:

The community also appealed for aid to Sanballat I, a Samaritan potentate, and his sons Delaiah and Shelemiah, as well as Johanan ben Eliashib. Both Sanballat and Johanan are mentioned in the Book of Nehemiah, , .

There was a response of both governors (Bagoas and Delaiah) which gave the permission by decree to rebuild the temple written in the form of a memorandum:
&quot;1Memorandum of what Bagohi and Delaiah said 2to me, saying: Memorandum: You may say in Egypt ... 8to (re)build it on its site as it was formerly...&quot;.

By the middle of the 4th century BCE, the temple at Elephantine had ceased to function. There is evidence from excavations that the rebuilding and enlargement of the Khnum temple under Nectanebo II (360–343) took the place of the former temple of YHWH.

In 2004, the Brooklyn Museum created a display entitled &quot;Jewish Life in Ancient Egypt: A Family Archive From the Nile Valley,&quot; which featured the interfaith couple of Ananiah, an official at the temple of Yahou (a.k.a. Yahweh), and his wife, Tamut, who was previously an Egyptian slave owned by an Aramean master, Meshullam. Some related exhibition didactics of 2002 included comments about significant structural similarities between Judaism and the ancient Egyptian religion and how they easily coexisted and blended at Elephantine.

===Anat-Yahu===
The papyri suggest that, &quot;Even in exile and beyond, the veneration of a female deity endured.&quot; The texts were written by a group of Jews living at Elephantine near the Nubian border, whose religion has been described as &quot;nearly identical to Iron Age II Judahite religion&quot;. The papyri describe the Jews as worshiping Anat-Yahu (mentioned in the document AP 44, line 3, in Cowley&#x27;s numbering). Anat-Yahu is described as either the wife (or paredra, sacred consort) of Yahweh or as a hypostatized aspect of Yahweh.

===The family archive of Ananiah and Tamut===
The eight papyri contained at the Brooklyn Museum concern one particular Jewish family, providing specific information about the daily lives of a man called Ananiah, a Jewish temple official; his wife, Tamut, an Egyptian slave; and their children, over the course of forty-seven years. Egyptian farmers discovered the archive of Ananiah and Tamut on Elephantine Island in 1893, while digging for fertilizer in the remains of ancient mud-brick houses. They found at least eight papyrus rolls which were purchased by Charles Edwin Wilbour. He was the first person to find Aramaic papyri. The papyri have been grouped here by topic, such as marriage contract, real estate transaction, or loan agreement.

Ancient marriage documents generally formalized already existing relationships. In this case, Ananiah and Tamut already had a young son when the document was drawn up. Because Tamut was a slave when she married Ananiah, the contract has special conditions: usually, it was the groom and his father-in-law who made Jewish marriage agreements, but Ananiah made this contract with Tamut&#x27;s master, Meshullam, who legally was her father. In addition, special provision was made to free the couple&#x27;s son, also a slave to Meshullam; perhaps Ananiah consented to the small dowry of either 7 or 15 shekels (the text is ambiguous) in order to obtain his son&#x27;s freedom. Future children, however, would still be born slaves. In contrast to Jewish documents like this one, contemporaneous Egyptian marriage documents were negotiated between a husband and wife.

====Deed of Emancipation====
Nearly twenty-two years after her marriage to Ananiah, Tamut&#x27;s master released her and her daughter, Yehoishema, from slavery. It was rare for a slave to be freed. And though a slave could marry a free person, their children usually belonged to the master. As an institution, slavery in Egypt at that time differed in notable ways from the practice in some other cultures: Egyptian slaves retained control over personal property, had professions, and were entitled to compensation. During the Persian Period in Egypt, it was not uncommon to sell children, or even oneself, into slavery to pay debts.

====Real estate documents====

=====Bagazust and Ubil sell a house to Ananiah=====

This document to the right describes a property purchased by Ananiah, twelve years after his marriage, from a Persian soldier named Bagazust and his wife, Ubil. The property, in a town on Elephantine Island, named for the god Khnum, was located across the street from the Temple of Yauh and adjacent to the Persian family of Ubil&#x27;s father. As such proximity might suggest, the Egyptians, Jews, and Persians in Elephantine all lived among one another. The renovation of the house and its gradual transfers to family members are the central concerns of the next several documents in Ananiah&#x27;s family archive.

=====Ananiah gives Tamut part of the house=====
Three years after purchasing the house from Bagazust and Ubil, Ananiah transferred ownership of an apartment within the now renovated house to his wife, Tamut. Although Tamut thereafter owned the apartment, Ananiah required that at her death it pass to their children, Palti and Yehoishema. As with all property transfers within a family, this gift was described as made &quot;in love&quot;.

=====Ananiah gives Yehoishema part of the house=====
Drawn up thirty years after the preceding papyrus, this document is one of several that gradually transferred ownership of Ananiah and Tamut&#x27;s house to their daughter, Yehoishema, as payment on her dowry. The legal descriptions of the house preserve the names of Ananiah&#x27;s neighbors. They included an Egyptian who held the post of gardener of the Egyptian god Khnum and, on the other side, two Persian boatmen. Image of document in gallery.

=====Ananiah gives Yehoishema another part of the house=====
For his daughter Yehoishema&#x27;s dowry, Ananiah had transferred to her partial ownership of the house he shared with Tamut. After making more repairs to the building, Ananiah transferred a further section of the house, described in this document, to the dowry. Image of document in gallery.

=====Ananiah and Tamut sell the house to their son-in-law=====
This papyrus records the sale of the remaining portion of Ananiah and Tamut&#x27;s house to Yehoishema&#x27;s husband. Possibly because the clients were dissatisfied with something the scribe had written, at one point the text of the document breaks off and then starts over again, repeating what has gone on before with some additions. The boundary description included here refers to the Temple of Yauh in Elephantine, now rebuilt eight years after its destruction in 410 BCE during a civil war conflict that arose out of a land dispute. Image of document in gallery below.

====Loan agreement====
Sometime in December 402 BCE, Ananiah son of Haggai borrowed two monthly rations of grain from Pakhnum son of Besa, an Aramean with an Egyptian name. This receipt would have been held by Pakhnum and returned to Ananiah son of Haggai when he repaid the loan. No interest is charged but there is a penalty for failing to repay the loan by the agreed date. The receipt demonstrates that friendly business relations continued between Egyptians and Jews in Elephantine after the expulsion of the Persians by Amyrtaeus, the only pharaoh of the Twenty-eighth Dynasty of Egypt.

<text>Jakobstad (; , ) is a town in Finland, located on the west coast of the country. Jakobstad is situated in Ostrobothnia, along the Gulf of Bothnia. The population of Jakobstad is approximately , while the sub-region has a population of approximately . It is the most populous municipality in Finland.

Jakobstad covers a land area of . The population density is . Neighboring municipalities are Larsmo, Pedersöre, and Nykarleby. The city of Vaasa is located southwest of Jakobstad.

Jakobstad is a bilingual municipality with Finnish and Swedish as its official languages. The population consists of Finnish speakers, Swedish speakers, and speakers of other languages.

==Origin of the names==
The Swedish name literally means &quot;Jacob&#x27;s City&quot; or &quot;Jacob&#x27;s Town&quot;, in reference to Jacob De la Gardie. The town was founded at the old harbour of the parish &quot;Pedersöre&quot; and this name lives on in the Finnish name of the municipality, &quot;Pietarsaari&quot;, literally &quot;Peter&#x27;s Island&quot;.

== History ==
The town was founded in 1652 by Ebba Brahe, the widow of the military commander Jacob De la Gardie, and was granted city privileges by Queen Christina of Sweden. The town was founded at the old harbour of the parish &quot;Pedersöre&quot;. Pedersöre remains an independent municipality neighbouring Jakobstad.

The city grew slowly at first, with the authorities scarcely promoting any growth. In 1680 the inhabitants were ordered to relocate to the cities of Kokkola, Oulu and Nykarleby, but the order was rescinded. Wars also contributed to the slow growth, and the city was invaded by Russian troops twice during the Greater Wrath, and large parts of the town were burnt to the ground. A majority of the inhabitants fled the city. While those with means moved across the sea to the Swedish side, others took shelter in the forest or in the archipelago. Many were captured or killed. During the 1720s, some of the previous inhabitants returned, while newcomers also added to the population. The subsequent decades were finally marked by a period of growth, and the current church was built in 1731.

The economic foundation was laid in the mid 18th century, with tar manufacturing and tobacco packaging at its centre. Trade started to develop rapidly in Jakobstad as of 1765, when the cities along the Finnish shore of the Gulf of Bothnia were granted privileges by the Swedish crown to trade directly with foreign countries. This also led to shipbuilding becoming a major activity in Jakobstad. The first ships to sail with goods to foreign countries were the galeas &quot;Jacobstads Wapen&quot; and the brig &quot;Enigheten&quot;. Trade and shipbuilding made Jakobstad a wealthy city, and a notable businessman of that time was the merchant and shipbuilder Adolf Lindskog, who also became one of the richest men in Finland.

The early 19th century was a time of upheaval, which saw the 1808–1809 war between Sweden and Russia, as well as a devastating fire in 1835 that destroyed approximately half of the city. Despite this, the economic progress continued, and a brewery, a matchstick factory and several banks were founded after 1850. In 1859, the merchant and shipowner Peter Malm started a steam powered sawmill, which was only the second such installation in Finland. The Crimean War was a major setback to shipping industry, as the British navy puts up an effective blockade and the shipping fleet in Jakobstad during the Åland War was reduced from 26 ships to 9.

Notable businessmen in the 19th century were Otto Malm and Wilhelm Schauman, the latter founding a chicory (coffee substitute) factory in Jakobstad in 1883. This moment in time is usually considered as the start of industrialization in Jakobstad. In 1900, the Strengberg tobacco factory was the largest employer in Jakobstad.

An artillery school was located in Jakobstad during the Finnish Civil War. During World War II, the city was bombed once by Soviet bomber planes, causing a few casualties. Up until the 1960s, the town was pretty small and mainly Swedish speaking with a pretty small finnish speaking minority, but because of the industrial expansion in the 1960s and 1970s, the need for additional work force caused a large influx of Finnish speakers and the city became almost majority finnish speaking.

===Early industries===

During the second half of the 19th century, the city changed from a city of shipping to an industrial city. From 1850 to 1900, the population increased from about 1,500 to over 6,000 inhabitants. The existing factories developed rapidly and new factories were established. Production in the factories was still small-scale. The city produced everything from beer and spirits to soaps and matches. The Finnish-speaking population in the city increased sharply when the tobacco factory expanded and was in great need of labor.

== Politics ==
Results of the 2017 Finnish municipal election in Jakobstad:
== Events ==
At the end of July, Jakobsdagar takes place. The event lasts for an entire week and includes various festivities such as concerts, merchant stalls, competitions, and performances. It attracts a large number of people each year. 

The name of the event translates to &quot;Jacob&#x27;s days&quot; and refers to the name of the city. 

At the end of November a chamber music festival called Rusk is held annually in Jakobstad. At the heart of this festival embracing superb chamber music and various other genres of the arts is the Schauman Hall in the centre of town, but the events also spread out into the surrounding urban environment. 

== Culture and sights ==
*Jakobstad City Hall (in Swedish: Jakobstads rådhus) is a historic building in the city which was completed in 1875. The current look of the building dates from 1890.
*Jakobstad is the home of the galeas &quot;Jacobstads Wapen&quot;, a full-scale replica built between 1987 and 1992, based on the original 1755 drawings by Swedish naval architect Fredrik Henrik af Chapman 
*Jakobstad - Pietarsaari Museum is the main museum in the city, concentrating on maritime and ship building history
*The Arctic museum Nanoq is located just outside Jakobstad.
* Cikoriamuseet was the only museum focused on chicory in Finland. In the former chicory factory from the 19th century, visitors can familiarize themselves with the production of chicory, get acquainted with Wilhelm Schaumans early industrial career and also experience authentic old factory conditions. The museum in Jakobstad will also offer art exhibitions and other events.
*The botanical garden Skolparken (in Swedish: &quot;the school park&quot;), with approximately 1,000 plant species, is renowned both as one of the most northerly botanical gardens in the world and for its classical park architecture. The foundation was laid in 1915 and the park was completed in 1932. The funding was provided by the Schauman family, who wanted to honour the memory of Elise and Viktor Schauman. The park was designed by the prominent Finnish garden architect Bengt Schalin.
*Skata is a protected residential area close to the city centre which dates from 1783. Up until the late 19th century, Skata was home primarily to sailors and their families. As of the 1890s, it transformed into a mainly working class area, providing housing to a large part of the work force employed by the Strengberg tobacco factory.
* Pedersöre Church

=== Food ===
In the 1980s, a rural liverwurst was named traditional food of Jakobstad. The culture of cafés and restaurants is lively in Jakobstad anyway, as the Strengberg tobacco factory was the first Finnish industrial plant to offer lunch to its employees. Jakobstad has ethnic restaurants, home-cooked lunch restaurants, à la carte restaurants and cafés, pubs and nightclubs.

The town&#x27;s football team FF Jaro currently plays in Veikkausliiga, the top league in Finland. They are also home to Kakkonen side Jakobstads BK. The woman&#x27;s league football club FC United has been very successful over the years.

<text>In mathematics, Pontryagin duality is a duality between locally compact abelian groups that allows generalizing Fourier transform to all such groups, which include the circle group (the multiplicative group of complex numbers of modulus one), the finite abelian groups (with the discrete topology), and the additive group of the integers (also with the discrete topology), the real numbers, and every finite-dimensional vector space over the reals or a -adic field.

The Pontryagin dual of a locally compact abelian group is the locally compact abelian topological group formed by the continuous group homomorphisms from the group to the circle group with the operation of pointwise multiplication and the topology of uniform convergence on compact sets. The Pontryagin duality theorem establishes Pontryagin duality by stating that any locally compact abelian group is naturally isomorphic with its bidual (the dual of its dual). The Fourier inversion theorem is a special case of this theorem.

The subject is named after Lev Pontryagin who laid down the foundations for the theory of locally compact abelian groups and their duality during his early mathematical works in 1934. Pontryagin&#x27;s treatment relied on the groups being second-countable and either compact or discrete. This was improved to cover the general locally compact abelian groups by Egbert van Kampen in 1935 and André Weil in 1940.

== Introduction ==
Pontryagin duality places in a unified context a number of observations about functions on the real line or on finite abelian groups:
* Suitably regular complex-valued periodic functions on the real line have Fourier series and these functions can be recovered from their Fourier series;
* Suitably regular complex-valued functions on the real line have Fourier transforms that are also functions on the real line and, just as for periodic functions, these functions can be recovered from their Fourier transforms; and
* Complex-valued functions on a finite abelian group have discrete Fourier transforms, which are functions on the dual group, which is a (non-canonically) isomorphic group. Moreover, any function on a finite abelian group can be recovered from its discrete Fourier transform.

The theory, introduced by Lev Pontryagin and combined with the Haar measure introduced by John von Neumann, André Weil and others depends on the theory of the dual group of a locally compact abelian group.

It is analogous to the dual vector space of a vector space: a finite-dimensional vector space formula_1 and its dual vector space formula_2 are not naturally isomorphic, but the endomorphism algebra (matrix algebra) of one is isomorphic to the opposite of the endomorphism algebra of the other: formula_3 via the transpose. Similarly, a group formula_4 and its dual group formula_5 are not in general isomorphic, but their endomorphism rings are opposite to each other: formula_6. More categorically, this is not just an isomorphism of endomorphism algebras, but a contravariant equivalence of categories – see &quot;&quot;.

== Definition ==

A topological group is a locally compact group if the underlying topological space is locally compact and Hausdorff; a topological group is &quot;abelian&quot; if the underlying group is abelian.
Examples of locally compact abelian groups include finite abelian groups, the integers (both for the discrete topology, which is also induced by the usual metric), the real numbers, the circle group &quot;T&quot; (both with their usual metric topology), and also the &quot;p&quot;-adic numbers (with their usual &quot;p&quot;-adic topology).

For a locally compact abelian group formula_4, the Pontryagin dual is the group formula_8 of continuous group homomorphisms from formula_4 to the circle group formula_10. That is,
formula_11
The Pontryagin dual formula_8 is usually endowed with the topology given by uniform convergence on compact sets (that is, the topology induced by the compact-open topology on the space of all continuous functions from formula_4 to formula_10).

For example,formula_15
== Pontryagin duality theorem ==

&lt;/math&gt; between any locally compact abelian group formula_4 and its double dual.}}

Canonical means that there is a naturally defined map formula_17 ; more importantly, the map should be functorial in formula_4. For the multiplicative character formula_19 of the group formula_4, the canonical isomorphism formula_21 is defined on formula_22 as follows:
formula_23
That is, formula_24

In other words, each group element formula_25 is identified to the evaluation character on the dual. This is strongly analogous to the canonical isomorphism between a finite-dimensional vector space and its double dual, formula_26, and it is worth mentioning that any vector space formula_1 is an abelian group. If formula_4 is a finite abelian group, then formula_29 but this isomorphism is not canonical. Making this statement precise (in general) requires thinking about dualizing not only on groups, but also on maps between the groups, in order to treat dualization as a functor and prove the identity functor and the dualization functor are not naturally equivalent. Also the duality theorem implies that for any group (not necessarily finite) the dualization functor is an exact functor.

== Pontryagin duality and the Fourier transform ==

=== Haar measure ===
One of the most remarkable facts about a locally compact group formula_4 is that it carries an essentially unique natural measure, the Haar measure, which allows one to consistently measure the &quot;size&quot; of sufficiently regular subsets of formula_4. &quot;Sufficiently regular subset&quot; here means a Borel set; that is, an element of the σ-algebra generated by the compact sets. More precisely, a right Haar measure on a locally compact group formula_4 is a countably additive measure μ defined on the Borel sets of formula_4 which is &quot;right invariant&quot; in the sense that formula_34 for formula_25 an element of formula_4 and formula_37 a Borel subset of formula_4 and also satisfies some regularity conditions (spelled out in detail in the article on Haar measure). Except for positive scaling factors, a Haar measure on formula_4 is unique.

The Haar measure on formula_4 allows us to define the notion of integral for (complex-valued) Borel functions defined on the group. In particular, one may consider various &quot;Lp&quot; spaces associated to the Haar measure formula_41. Specifically,
formula_42

Note that, since any two Haar measures on formula_4 are equal up to a scaling factor, this formula_44-space is independent of the choice of Haar measure and thus perhaps could be written as formula_45. However, the formula_44-norm on this space depends on the choice of Haar measure, so if one wants to talk about isometries it is important to keep track of the Haar measure being used.

=== Fourier transform and Fourier inversion formula for &quot;L&quot;1-functions ===

The dual group of a locally compact abelian group is used as the underlying space for an abstract version of the Fourier transform. If formula_47, then the Fourier transform is the function formula_48 on formula_5 defined by
formula_50
where the integral is relative to Haar measure formula_41 on formula_4. This is also denoted formula_53. Note the Fourier transform depends on the choice of Haar measure. It is not too difficult to show that the Fourier transform of an formula_54 function on formula_4 is a bounded continuous function on formula_5 which vanishes at infinity.

 \widehat f(\chi)\chi(x)\ d\nu(\chi) \qquad \mu\text{-almost everywhere} &lt;/math&gt;
If formula_57 is continuous then this identity holds for all formula_25.}}

The &quot;inverse Fourier transform&quot; of an integrable function on formula_5 is given by
formula_60
where the integral is relative to the Haar measure formula_61 on the dual group formula_5. The measure formula_61 on formula_5 that appears in the Fourier inversion formula is called the dual measure to formula_41 and may be denoted formula_66.

The various Fourier transforms can be classified in terms of their domain and transform domain (the group and dual group) as follows (note that formula_67 is Circle group):

As an example, suppose formula_68, so we can think about formula_5 as formula_70 by the pairing formula_71 If formula_41 is the Lebesgue measure on Euclidean space, we obtain the ordinary Fourier transform on formula_70 and the dual measure needed for the Fourier inversion formula is formula_74. If we want to get a Fourier inversion formula with the same measure on both sides (that is, since we can think about formula_70 as its own dual space we can ask for formula_66 to equal formula_41) then we need to use
formula_78

However, if we change the way we identify formula_70 with its dual group, by using the pairing
formula_80
then Lebesgue measure on formula_70 is equal to its own dual measure. This convention minimizes the number of factors of formula_82 that show up in various places when computing Fourier transforms or inverse Fourier transforms on Euclidean space. (In effect it limits the formula_82 only to the exponent rather than as a pre-factor outside the integral sign.) Note that the choice of how to identify formula_70 with its dual group affects the meaning of the term &quot;self-dual function&quot;, which is a function on formula_70 equal to its own Fourier transform: using the classical pairing formula_86 the function formula_87 is self-dual. But using the pairing, which keeps the pre-factor as unity, formula_88 makes formula_89 self-dual instead. This second definition for the Fourier transform has the advantage that it maps the multiplicative identity to the convolution identity, which is useful as formula_54 is a convolution algebra. See the next section on the group algebra. In addition, this form is also necessarily isometric on formula_91 spaces. See below at Plancherel and &quot;L&quot;2 Fourier inversion theorems.

=== Group algebra ===

The space of integrable functions on a locally compact abelian group formula_4 is an algebra, where multiplication is convolution: the convolution of two integrable functions formula_57 and formula_94 is defined as
formula_95

This algebra is referred to as the &quot;Group Algebra&quot; of formula_4. By the Fubini–Tonelli theorem, the convolution is submultiplicative with respect to the formula_54 norm, making formula_98 a Banach algebra. The Banach algebra formula_98 has a multiplicative identity element if and only if formula_4 is a discrete group, namely the function that is 1 at the identity and zero elsewhere. In general, however, it has an approximate identity which is a net (or generalized sequence) formula_101 indexed on a directed set formula_102 such that formula_103

The Fourier transform takes convolution to multiplication, i.e. it is a homomorphism of abelian Banach algebras formula_104 (of norm ≤ 1):
formula_105

In particular, to every group character on formula_4 corresponds a unique &quot;multiplicative linear functional&quot; on the group algebra defined by
formula_107

It is an important property of the group algebra that these exhaust the set of non-trivial (that is, not identically zero) multiplicative linear functionals on the group algebra; see section 34 of . This means the Fourier transform is a special case of the Gelfand transform.

=== Plancherel and &quot;L&quot;2 Fourier inversion theorems ===
As we have stated, the dual group of a locally compact abelian group is a locally compact abelian group in its own right and thus has a Haar measure, or more precisely a whole family of scale-related Haar measures.

 \left|\widehat{f}(\chi)\right|^2 \ d \nu(\chi).&lt;/math&gt;
In particular, the Fourier transform is an formula_91 isometry from the complex-valued continuous functions of compact support on formula_4 to the formula_91-functions on formula_5 (using the formula_91-norm with respect to formula_41 for functions on formula_4 and the formula_91-norm with respect to formula_61 for functions on formula_5).}}

Since the complex-valued continuous functions of compact support on formula_4 are formula_91-dense, there is a unique extension of the Fourier transform from that space to a unitary operator
formula_120
and we have the formula
formula_121

Note that for non-compact locally compact groups formula_4 the space formula_98 does not contain formula_124, so the Fourier transform of general formula_91-functions on formula_4 is &quot;not&quot; given by any kind of integration formula (or really any explicit formula). To define the formula_91 Fourier transform one has to resort to some technical trick such as starting on a dense subspace like the continuous functions with compact support and then extending the isometry by continuity to the whole space. This unitary extension of the Fourier transform is what we mean by the Fourier transform on the space of square integrable functions.

The dual group also has an inverse Fourier transform in its own right; it can be characterized as the inverse (or adjoint, since it is unitary) of the formula_91 Fourier transform. This is the content of the formula_91 Fourier inversion formula which follows.

In the case formula_130 the dual group formula_5 is naturally isomorphic to the group of integers formula_132 and the Fourier transform specializes to the computation of coefficients of Fourier series of periodic functions.

If formula_4 is a finite group, we recover the discrete Fourier transform. Note that this case is very easy to prove directly.

== Bohr compactification and almost-periodicity ==
One important application of Pontryagin duality is the following characterization of compact abelian topological groups:
That formula_4 being compact implies formula_5 is discrete or that formula_4 being discrete implies that formula_5 is compact is an elementary consequence of the definition of the compact-open topology on formula_5 and does not need Pontryagin duality. One uses Pontryagin duality to prove the converses.

The Bohr compactification is defined for any topological group formula_4, regardless of whether formula_4 is locally compact or abelian. One use made of Pontryagin duality between compact abelian groups and discrete abelian groups is to characterize the Bohr compactification of an arbitrary abelian &quot;locally compact&quot; topological group. The &quot;Bohr compactification&quot; formula_141 of formula_4 is formula_143, where &quot;H&quot; has the group structure formula_5, but given the discrete topology. Since the inclusion map
formula_145
is continuous and a homomorphism, the dual morphism
formula_146 
is a morphism into a compact group which is easily shown to satisfy the requisite universal property.

== Categorical considerations ==

Pontryagin duality can also profitably be considered functorially. In what follows, LCA is the category of locally compact abelian groups and continuous group homomorphisms. The dual group construction of formula_5 is a contravariant functor LCA → LCA, represented (in the sense of representable functors) by the circle group formula_148 as formula_149 In particular, the double dual functor formula_150 is &quot;covariant&quot;.
A categorical formulation of Pontryagin duality then states that the natural transformation between the identity functor on LCA and the double dual functor is an isomorphism. Unwinding the notion of a natural transformation, this means that the maps formula_151 are isomorphisms for any locally compact abelian group formula_4, and these isomorphisms are functorial in formula_4. This isomorphism is analogous to the double dual of finite-dimensional vector spaces (a special case, for real and complex vector spaces).

An immediate consequence of this formulation is another common categorical formulation of Pontryagin duality: the dual group functor is an equivalence of categories from LCA to LCAop.

The duality interchanges the subcategories of discrete groups and compact groups. If formula_154 is a ring and formula_4 is a left formula_154–module, the dual group formula_5 will become a right formula_154–module; in this way we can also see that discrete left formula_154–modules will be Pontryagin dual to compact right formula_154–modules. The ring formula_161 of endomorphisms in LCA is changed by duality into its opposite ring (change the multiplication to the other order). For example, if formula_4 is an infinite cyclic discrete group, formula_5 is a circle group: the former has formula_164 so this is true also of the latter.

== Generalizations ==

Generalizations of Pontryagin duality are constructed in two main directions: for commutative topological groups that are not locally compact, and for noncommutative topological groups. The theories in these two cases are very different.

=== Dualities for commutative topological groups ===

When formula_4 is a Hausdorff abelian topological group, the group formula_5 with the compact-open topology is a Hausdorff abelian topological group and the natural mapping from formula_4 to its double-dual formula_168 makes sense. If this mapping is an isomorphism, it is said that formula_4 satisfies Pontryagin duality (or that formula_4 is a &quot;reflexive group&quot;, or a &quot;reflective group&quot;). This has been extended in a number of directions beyond the case that formula_4 is locally compact.

In particular, Samuel Kaplan showed in 1948 and 1950 that arbitrary products and countable inverse limits of locally compact (Hausdorff) abelian groups satisfy Pontryagin duality. Note that an infinite product of locally compact non-compact spaces is not locally compact.

Later, in 1975, Rangachari Venkataraman showed, among other facts, that every open subgroup of an abelian topological group which satisfies Pontryagin duality itself satisfies Pontryagin duality.

More recently, Sergio Ardanza-Trevijano and María Jesús Chasco have extended the results of Kaplan mentioned above. They showed that direct and inverse limits of sequences of abelian groups satisfying Pontryagin duality also satisfy Pontryagin duality if the groups are metrizable or formula_172-spaces but not necessarily locally compact, provided some extra conditions are satisfied by the sequences.

However, there is a fundamental aspect that changes if we want to consider Pontryagin duality beyond the locally compact case. Elena Martín-Peinador proved in 1995 that if formula_4 is a Hausdorff abelian topological group that satisfies Pontryagin duality, and the natural evaluation pairing
formula_174
is (jointly) continuous, then formula_4 is locally compact. As a corollary, all non-locally compact examples of Pontryagin duality are groups where the pairing formula_176 is not (jointly) continuous.

Another way to generalize Pontryagin duality to wider classes of commutative topological groups is to endow the dual group formula_5 with a bit different topology, namely the &quot;topology of uniform convergence on totally bounded sets&quot;. The groups satisfying the identity formula_178 under this assumption&lt;/math&gt; is dual to formula_5 in the same sense.}} are called &quot;stereotype groups&quot;. This class is also very wide (and it contains locally compact abelian groups), but it is narrower than the class of reflective groups.

=== Pontryagin duality for topological vector spaces ===
In 1952 Marianne F. Smith noticed that Banach spaces and reflexive spaces, being considered as topological groups (with the additive group operation), satisfy Pontryagin duality. Later B. S. Brudovskiĭ, William C. Waterhouse and K. Brauner showed that this result can be extended to the class of all quasi-complete barreled spaces (in particular, to all Fréchet spaces). In the 1990s Sergei Akbarov gave a description of the class of the topological vector spaces that satisfy a stronger property than the classical Pontryagin reflexivity, namely, the identity
formula_180 
where formula_181 means the space of all linear continuous functionals formula_182 endowed with the &quot;topology of uniform convergence on totally bounded sets&quot; in formula_183 (and formula_184 means the dual to formula_181 in the same sense). The spaces of this class are called stereotype spaces, and the corresponding theory found a series of applications in Functional analysis and Geometry, including the generalization of Pontryagin duality for non-commutative topological groups.

=== Dualities for non-commutative topological groups ===
For non-commutative locally compact groups formula_4 the classical Pontryagin construction stops working for various reasons, in particular, because the characters don&#x27;t always separate the points of formula_4, and the irreducible representations of formula_4 are not always one-dimensional. At the same time it is not clear how to introduce multiplication on the set of irreducible unitary representations of formula_4, and it is even not clear whether this set is a good choice for the role of the dual object for formula_4. So the problem of constructing duality in this situation requires complete rethinking.

Theories built to date are divided into two main groups: the theories where the dual object has the same nature as the source one (like in the Pontryagin duality itself), and the theories where the source object and its dual differ from each other so radically that it is impossible to count them as objects of one class.

The second type theories were historically the first: soon after Pontryagin&#x27;s work Tadao Tannaka (1938) and Mark Krein (1949) constructed a duality theory for arbitrary compact groups known now as the Tannaka–Krein duality. In this theory the dual object for a group formula_4 is not a group but a category of its representations formula_192.
The theories of first type appeared later and the key example for them was the duality theory for finite groups. In this theory the category of finite groups is embedded by the operation formula_193 of taking group algebra formula_194 (over formula_195) into the category of finite dimensional Hopf algebras, so that the Pontryagin duality functor formula_196 turns into the operation formula_197 of taking the dual vector space (which is a duality functor in the category of finite dimensional Hopf algebras).

In 1973 Leonid I. Vainerman, George I. Kac, Michel Enock, and Jean-Marie Schwartz built a general theory of this type for all locally compact groups. From the 1980s the research in this area was resumed after the discovery of quantum groups, to which the constructed theories began to be actively transferred. These theories are formulated in the language of C*-algebras, or Von Neumann algebras, and one of its variants is the recent theory of locally compact quantum groups.

One of the drawbacks of these general theories, however, is that in them the objects generalizing the concept of a group are not Hopf algebras in the usual algebraic sense. This deficiency can be corrected (for some classes of groups) within the framework of duality theories constructed on the basis of the notion of envelope of topological algebra.

<doc id="366141" wikidata="Q6593218" url="?curid=366141" title="List of Oxbridge sister colleges">
<text>Most of the colleges forming the University of Cambridge and University of Oxford are paired into sister colleges across the two universities. The extent of the arrangement differs from case to case, but commonly includes the right to dine at one&#x27;s sister college, the right to book accommodation there, the holding of joint events between JCRs and invitations to May balls.

Most of the pairings reflect similarities between the two colleges concerned, often parallel histories. For example, University College, Oxford (an ancient and prestigious college, founded 1249) is paired with Trinity Hall, Cambridge (of equivalent reputation, founded 1350). William Wykeham&#x27;s statutes for New College, Oxford, founded in 1379, formed the basis of the foundation of its sister college, King&#x27;s College, Cambridge. The two Colleges both share distinguished choral reputations. Founded by scholars from Merton College, one of Oxford&#x27;s oldest colleges (founded 1264), Peterhouse (Cambridge, 1284) is Cambridge&#x27;s first college. Similarly, Somerville College, Oxford (founded in 1879 as a women&#x27;s institution) has Girton College, Cambridge (also historically a women&#x27;s college, founded 1869) as its sister college. St Catherine&#x27;s College, Oxford (the most recent undergraduate college in Oxford, founded 1963) is paired with Robinson College, Cambridge (the newest Cambridge college, founded 1977).

Oriel College and St Hugh&#x27;s College, Oxford currently each dispute the other&#x27;s claim to sister-college status with Clare College, Cambridge. While Oriel and Clare share a common founding year of 1326 and a long history of association, in the 1980s the newly coeducational Clare associated with the then female-only St. Hugh&#x27;s to protest against Oriel&#x27;s remaining all male. Today both St. Hugh&#x27;s and Oriel are coeducational.

<doc id="366146" wikidata="Q283511" url="?curid=366146" title="Triple Alliance (1717)">
<text>The Triple Alliance was a defence pact signed on 4 January 1717 in The Hague between the Dutch Republic, France and Great Britain, against Bourbon Spain in an attempt to maintain the agreements of the 1713–15 Peace of Utrecht. The three states were concerned about Spain becoming a superpower in Europe. As a result, militarisation took place and caused great havoc to civilians. That enraged Spain and other states and led to brinkmanship. The alliance became the Quadruple Alliance the next year, after the accession of Holy Roman Emperor Charles VI.

== Background ==

The War of the Spanish Succession had ended with a compromise: Philip V of Bourbon was recognised as king of Spain, but he and his descendants had to renounce all claims to the French throne, while the French king Louis XIV and his descendants had to renounce all claims to the Spanish throne. Philip V also had to cede Sicily to Savoy, and the Spanish Netherlands, Milan, Sardinia and Naples to Austria. Philip resented these conditions, and sought to recapture the lost territories to strengthen Spain in the post-war period without starting a new great war. Meanwhile, he supported the Cellamare conspiracy to seize the French regency (exerted by Philippe II, Duke of Orléans over infant king Louis XV) for himself.

After the deaths of Louis XIV and Queen Anne, relations between France and Great Britain improved. The new British king George I and the new French regent Philippe of Orléans were cousins, and both regimes faced threats. Orléans was concerned that his domestic enemies, particularly Louis Auguste de Bourbon, Duc de Maine, would combine with Spain to overthrow him, and George I wished to persuade the French to withhold support for any further Jacobite risings.

== Formation ==
According to Louis de Rouvroy, duc de Saint-Simon, who opposed the alliance, the British Ambassador to Paris, John Dalrymple, 2nd Earl of Stair, argued that the short-term advantage to both regimes of an alliance outweighed their traditional differences. Orléans agreed, as did his secretary Guillaume Dubois, the future Cardinal, together with James Stanhope, 1st Earl Stanhope, the English Secretary of State, who is generally regarded as the principal author of the alliance.

The Anglo-French Alliance (1716–1731) was concluded on 9 or 10 October 1716. It took several months to be ratified. Then, on 4 January 1717, the Dutch Republic concluded a defence pact with Britain and France in The Hague, in effect enlarging the bilateral alliance to a trilateral one.

== Contents of the agreement ==
On 4 January 1717, Guillaume Dubois and Pierre Antoine de Châteauneuf sent by Philip II of Orléans (regent of France during the minority of King Louis XV), William Cadogan representing George I of Great Britain and the delegates of the States General of the Netherlands, reunited in the city of The Hague, signed the agreement, which included as main points the following:

* Ratification of the agreements reached in the treaties of Utrecht of 1713.
* France would expel James Stuart, pretender to the English crown, from his residence in Avignon.
* The Dutch Republic would expel from their territory the supporters of James Stuart, considered rebels against England.
* France should demolish the Mardyke Canal, built after the dismantling of the port of Dunkirk as agreed in the Treaty of Utrecht.
* In the event that one of the signatory countries saw its territory invaded by forces of a foreign country or had to face internal rebellions, the other two would provide military help. In such a case, France and England would contribute 8,000 infantry and 2,000 cavalry each; the Dutch Republic would contribute 4,000 infantry and 1,000 cavalry. At the request of the invaded country, these troops could be replaced by an equivalent naval force. This point would only be valid in the territories of the signatories in Europe.

== Aftermath ==
In 1718, with the adhesion of the Holy Roman Empire through the signing of the Treaty of London, it became the Quadruple Alliance.

Saint-Simon, who loathed Dubois, argued that the Bourbon Kingdoms of France and Spain should be perpetual allies, but that took no account of present realities. The Spanish conquest of Sardinia (22 August – 30 October 1717) and the Cellamare conspiracy fully justified Orléans&#x27;s concerns about Spanish intentions, and the successful conclusion to the War of Quadruple Alliance vindicated the decision to ally with Great Britain and the Dutch Republic.

<text>Andrews&#x27; beaked whale (Mesoplodon bowdoini), sometimes known as the deep-crest beaked whale or splay-toothed whale, is one of the least known members of a poorly known genus. The species has never been observed in the wild, and is known only from specimens washed up on beaches.

==Taxonomy==
The species was first described in 1908 by the American scientist Roy Chapman Andrews from a specimen collected at New Brighton Beach, Canterbury Province, New Zealand, in 1904. He named it in honor of George S. Bowdoin, a donor and trustee to the American Museum of Natural History.

==Description==

The body of Andrews&#x27; beaked whale is robust in comparison with other members of the genus. The melon is low, and the beak is short and thick. The lower jaw is peculiar in that halfway through it rises up significantly with the teeth extending over the rostrum. The head also sometimes has a light patch on the sides, more prominent in the males. The male, overall dark gray to black, has a lighter &quot;saddle&quot; marking between the blowhole and dorsal fin on its back. Males also carry scars typical of the genus. Females are slate gray with grayish-white flanks and belly. Cookiecutter sharkbites are present in both sexes. Females are believed to reach at least and males . The young are believed to be around long when born.

==Behavior==
The calving season may be during summer and autumn off New Zealand. Otherwise, any behavior is completely unknown.

==Population and distribution==
Andrews&#x27; beaked whales live in the Southern Hemisphere, and the precise range is uncertain. Some 35 stranded specimens have been recorded in Australia and New Zealand, Macquarie Island, the Falkland Islands, and Tristan da Cunha. That range may imply a circumpolar distribution. However, there are no confirmed sightings to confirm this.

==Conservation==
Andrews&#x27; beaked whale has never been hunted, and there are no records of it being caught in fishing gear. In addition, Andrews’ beaked whale is covered by the Memorandum of Understanding for the Conservation of Cetaceans and Their Habitats in the Pacific Islands Region (Pacific Cetaceans MOU).
