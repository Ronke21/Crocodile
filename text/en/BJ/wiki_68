<text>The West Bank barrier, West Bank wall or the West Bank separation barrier, is a separation barrier built by Israel along the Green Line and inside parts of the West Bank. Israel describes the wall as a necessary security barrier against Palestinian political violence; whereas Palestinians describe it as an element of racial segregation and a representation of Israeli apartheid, who often call it &quot;Wall of Apartheid&quot;. At a total length of upon completion, the route traced by the barrier is more than double the length of the Green Line, with 15% of its length running along the Green Line or inside Israel, and the remaining 85% running as much as inside the West Bank, effectively isolating about 9% of the land and approximately 25,000 Palestinians from the rest of the Palestinian territory.

The barrier was built by Israel following a wave of Palestinian political violence and incidents of terrorism inside Israel during the Second Intifada, which began in September 2000 and ended in February 2005. The Israeli government cites a decreased number of suicide bombings carried out from the West Bank as evidence of its efficacy, after such attacks fell from 73 between 2000 and July 2003 (the completion of the first continuous segment) to 12 between August 2003 and the end of 2006. While the barrier was initially presented as a temporary security measure at a time of heightened tensions, it has since been associated with a future political border between Israel and the State of Palestine.

The barrier has drawn criticism from Palestinians, human rights groups, and members of the international community, who have all argued that it serves as evidence of Israel&#x27;s intent to annex Palestinian land under the guise of security. It has also been alleged that the construction of the wall aims to undermine the Israeli–Palestinian peace process by unilaterally establishing new &quot;de facto&quot; borders. Key points of dispute are that it substantially deviates eastward from the Green Line, severely restricts the travel of many Palestinians, and impairs their ability to commute to work within the West Bank or to Israel. The International Court of Justice issued an advisory opinion finding that the barrier qualifies as a violation of international law. In 2003, the United Nations General Assembly adopted a resolution that charged Israel&#x27;s building of the barrier to be a violation of international law and demanded its removal by a vote of 144–4 with 12 abstentions.

The walled sections of the barrier have become a canvas for graffiti art, with its Palestinian side illustrating opposition to the barrier, Palestinian resistance, their right to return, as well as human rights in general.

==Names==

In Hebrew, descriptions include: &quot;separation fence&quot; (, ); &quot;separation wall&quot; (, &#x27;) and &quot;security fence&quot; (, &#x27;).

In Arabic, it is called &quot;wall of apartheid&quot;/&quot;racial segregation wall&quot; , &quot;&quot;, indicating an allegation of Israeli apartheid.

In English, the BBC&#x27;s style guide uses the terms &quot;barrier&quot; (sometimes &quot;separation barrier&quot; or &quot;West Bank barrier&quot;) as do &quot;The Economist&quot;, PBS and &quot;The New York Times&quot;. The Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs uses the phrase &quot;security fence&quot; in English. The International Court of Justice has used the term &quot;wall&quot;, explaining that &quot;the other expressions sometimes employed are no more accurate if understood in the physical sense.&quot; It is also referred to as the &quot;Apartheid Wall&quot; or &quot;Apartheid Fence&quot; in a derogatory manner. &quot;Seam zone&quot; () refers to the land between the 1949 Armistice Agreement Line and the fence.

==Structure==

The barrier is described by the Israeli Defense Forces as a &quot;multi-layered composite obstacle&quot;, parts of it consisting of a high concrete wall, while other stretches consist of a multi-layered fence system, with three fences with pyramid-shaped stacks of barbed wire on the two outer fences and a lighter-weight fence with intrusion detection equipment in the middle; an anti-vehicle ditch; patrol roads on both sides; and a smooth strip of sand for &quot;intrusion tracking&quot;.

Where the multi-layered fence system is employed, it contains an exclusion area of in width on average, with some sections having an exclusion area that reaches up to . The concrete wall has a width of , and the wall is high.

==Route==



The barrier runs partly along or near the 1949 Jordanian–Israeli armistice line (&quot;Green Line&quot;) and partly through the Israeli-occupied West Bank diverging eastward from the armistice line by up to to include on the western side several of the areas with concentrations of highly populated Israeli settlements, such as East Jerusalem, the Ariel Bloc (Ariel, Karnei Shomron, Kedumim, Immanuel etc.), Gush Etzion, Givat Ze&#x27;ev, Oranit, and Maale Adumim.

The barrier nearly encircles some Palestinian towns, about 20% follows the armistice line, and a projected or about 13.5% of the West Bank area is on the west side of the wall. According to a study of the April 2006 route by the Israeli human rights organization B&#x27;Tselem, 8.5% of the West Bank area will be on the Israeli side of the barrier after completion, and 3.4% partly or completely surrounded on the eastern side. Some 27,520 to 31,000 Palestinians will be captured on the Israeli side. Another 124,000, on the other hand, will effectively be controlled and isolated. Some 230,000 Palestinians in Jerusalem will be placed on the West Bank side. Most of the barrier was built at the northern and western edges of the West Bank, mostly beyond the Green Line and created 9 enclaves, which enclosed . An additional barrier, circa 10 km long, run south of Ramallah.

Israel states that the topography does not permit putting the barrier along the Green Line in some places because hills or tall buildings on the Palestinian side would make the barrier ineffective against terrorism. The International Court of Justice states that in such cases it is only legal to build the barrier inside Israel.

The barrier route has been challenged in court and changed several times. Argument presented to the court has reiterated that the cease-fire line of 1949 was negotiated &quot;without prejudice to future territorial settlements or boundary lines&quot; (Art. VI.9).
==Timeline==
In 1992, the idea of creating a physical barrier between the Israeli and Palestinian populations was proposed by then-prime minister Yitzhak Rabin, following the murder of an Israeli teenage girl in Jerusalem. Rabin said that Israel must &quot;take Gaza out of Tel Aviv&quot; in order to minimize friction between the peoples.

Following an outbreak of violent incidents in Gaza in October 1994, Rabin said: &quot;We have to decide on separation as a philosophy. There has to be a clear border. Without demarcating the lines, whoever wants to swallow 1.8 million Arabs will just bring greater support for Hamas.&quot; Following an attack on HaSharon Junction, near the city of Netanya, Rabin made his goals more specific: &quot;This path must lead to a separation, though not according to the borders prior to 1967. We want to reach a separation between us and them. We do not want a majority of the Jewish residents of the state of Israel, 98% of whom live within the borders of sovereign Israel, including a united Jerusalem, to be subject to terrorism.&quot;

In 1994, the first section of a barrier (slabs of concrete contiguous for miles) was constructed. The section follows the border between Bat Hefer and Tulkarm communities.

In 1995, the Shahal commission was established by Yitzhak Rabin to discuss how to implement a barrier separating Israelis and Palestinians. Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak, prior to the Camp David 2000 Summit with Yasser Arafat, vowed to build a separation barrier, stating that it is &quot;essential to the Palestinian nation in order to foster its national identity and independence without being dependent on the State of Israel&quot;.

In November 2000, during Israeli-Palestinian peace negotiations in Washington, Prime Minister Ehud Barak approved financing of a fence between the Wadi Ara region and Latrun. Not until 14 April 2002, the Cabinet of Prime Minister Ariel Sharon decided to implement the plan and establish a permanent barrier in the Seam Area. On 23 June 2002, the Ariel Sharon Government definitely approved the plan in principle and work at the barrier began.

At the end of 2002, due to government inaction, several localities who suffered the most from lack of a border barrier had already started to build the barrier using their own funds directly on the green-line.

By 2003, had been completed and in 2004, Israel started the southern part of the barrier.


In February 2004, the Israeli government said it would review the route of the barrier in response to US and Palestinian concerns. In particular, Israeli cabinet members said modifications would be made to reduce the number of checkpoints Palestinians had to cross, and especially to reduce Palestinian hardship in areas such as the city of Qalqilyah which the barrier completely surrounds. On February 20, 2005, the Israeli cabinet approved the barrier&#x27;s route on the same day it approved the execution of the Gaza disengagement plan. The length of the route was increased to (about twice the length of the Green Line) and would leave about 10% of the West Bank, including East Jerusalem and nearly 50,000 Palestinians on the Israeli side. It also put the large settlement Maale Adumim and the Gush Etzion bloc on the Israeli side of the barrier, effectively annexing them. The final route, when realized, closes the Wall separating East Jerusalem, including Maale Adumim, from the West Bank. Before, the exact route of the barrier had not been determined, and it had been alleged by opponents that the barrier route would encircle the Samarian highlands of the West Bank, separating them from the Jordan valley. In June 2004, in exchange for Finance Minister Benjamin Netanyahu&#x27;s support Israel&#x27;s planned withdrawal from Gaza, Prime Minister Sharon pledged to build an extension of the barrier to the east of the settlement Ariel to be completed before the finish of the withdrawal from the Gaza Strip. Despite the ICJ ruling that the wall beyond the Green Line is illegal, Ariel Sharon reiterated on September 8, 2004, that the large settlement blocs of Ariel, Ma&#x27;aleh Adumim and Gush Etzion will be on the Israeli side of the Barrier. He also decided that the Barrier would run east of Ariel, but its connection with the main fence be postponed. Israel appropriated Palestinian private land to build the fence upon and started preparations for constructing the wall to the farthest point ever inside the West Bank, beyond the Green Line, long, and wide.

In 2005, the Israeli Supreme Court made reference to the conditions and history that led to the building of the barrier. The Court described the history of violence against Israeli citizens since the breakout of the Second Intifada and the loss of life that ensued on the Israeli side. The court ruling also cited the attempts Israel had made to defend its citizens, including &quot;military operations&quot; carried out against &quot;terrorist acts&quot;, and stated that these actions &quot;did not provide a sufficient answer to the immediate need to stop the severe acts of terrorism. ... Despite all these measures, the terror did not come to an end. The attacks did not cease. Innocent people paid with both life and limb. This is the background behind the decision to construct the separation fence (Id., at p. 815).&quot;

In 2006, of the barrier had been completed, was under construction and had not yet been started. On April 30, 2006, the route was revised by a cabinet decision, following a suicide bombing in Tel Aviv. In the Ariel area, the new route corrects an anomaly of the previous route that would have left thousands of Palestinians on the Israeli side. The Alfei Menashe settlement bloc was reduced in size, and the new plan leaves three groups of Palestinian houses on the Palestinian side of the fence. The barrier&#x27;s route in the Jerusalem area will leave Beit Iksa on the Palestinian side; and Jaba on the Israeli side, but with a crossing to the Palestinian side at Tzurif. Further changes were made to the route around Eshkolot and Metzadot Yehuda, and the route from Metzadot to Har Choled was approved.

In 2012, (62%) of the barrier had been completed.

In September 2014, eight years after approving the 45 km stretch of barrier enclosing Gush Etzion, no progress had been made on it, and Israel reopened the debate. The fence is scheduled to go through the national park, the Nahal Rafaim valley, and the Palestinian village of Battir. The Israeli land appropriated in Gva&#x27;ot would be on the Palestinian side of the barrier. On 21 September 2014, the government voted to not reauthorize the barrier in the Gush Etzion area.

In 2022, of the barrier that had been built as a multi-layered fence were replaced by new sections of the 9-meter high concrete wall.

==Effectiveness==
Suicide bombings have decreased since the construction of the barrier. Israeli officials (including the head of the Shin Bet) quoted in the newspaper &quot;Maariv&quot; have said that in the areas where the barrier was complete, the number of hostile infiltrations has decreased to almost zero. &quot;Maariv&quot; also stated that Palestinian militants, including a senior member of Islamic Jihad, had confirmed that the barrier made it much harder to conduct attacks inside Israel. Since the completion of the fence in the area of Tulkarm and Qalqilyah in June 2003, there have been no successful attacks from those areas. All attacks were intercepted or the suicide bombers detonated prematurely. In a March 23, 2008 interview, Palestinian Islamic Jihad leader Ramadan Shalah complained to the Qatari newspaper &quot;Al-Sharq&quot; that the separation barrier &quot;limits the ability of the resistance to arrive deep within [Israeli territory] to carry out suicide bombing attacks, but the resistance has not surrendered or become helpless, and is looking for other ways to cope with the requirements of every stage&quot; of the intifada.

Other factors are also cited as causes for the decline. According to &quot;Haaretz&quot;, a 2006 report by the Shin Beit concluded that &quot;[t]he fence does make it harder for them [terrorists]&quot; but that attacks in 2005 decreased due to increased pursuing of Palestinian militants by the Israeli army and intelligence organizations, Hamas&#x27;s increased political activity, and a truce among Palestinian militant groups in the Palestinian Territories. Haaretz reported, &quot;[t]he security fence is no longer mentioned as the major factor in preventing suicide bombings, mainly because the terrorists have found ways to bypass it.&quot; Former Israeli Secretary of Defence Moshe Arens says that the reduction in Palestinian violence is largely due to the IDF&#x27;s entry into the West Bank in 2002.

==Effects on Palestinians==
The barrier has many effects on Palestinians including reduced freedoms, reduction of the number of Israel Defense Forces checkpoints and road closures, loss of land, increased difficulty in accessing medical and educational services in Israel, restricted access to water sources, and economic effects.

===Reduced freedoms===
In a 2005 report, the United Nations stated that:
An often-quoted example of the effects of the barrier is the Palestinian town of Qalqilyah, a city of around 45,000, which is surrounded almost on all sides by the barrier. One 8 meter-high concrete section of this wall follows the Green Line between the city and the nearby Trans-Israel Highway. According to the BBC, this section, referred to as an &quot;anti-sniper wall&quot;, is intended to prevent gun attacks against Israeli motorists on the Trans-Israel Highway. The city is accessible through a military checkpoint on the main road from the east, and a tunnel built in September 2004 on the south side connects Qalqilyah with the adjacent village of Habla. In 2005, the Israeli Supreme Court ordered the government to change the route of the barrier in this area to ease movement of Palestinians between Qalqilyah and five surrounding villages. In the same ruling, the court rejected the arguments that the fence must be built only on the Green Line. The ruling cited the topography of the terrain, security considerations, and sections 43 and 52 of The Hague Regulations 1907 and Article 53 of the Fourth Geneva Convention as reasons for this rejection.
In early October 2003, the IDF OC Central Command declared the area between the separation barrier in the northern section of the West Bank (Stage 1) and the Green Line a closed military area for an indefinite period. New directives stated that every Palestinian over the age of twelve living in the enclaves created in the closed area have to obtain a &quot;permanent resident permit&quot; from the Civil Administration to enable them to continue to live in their homes, approximately 27,250 people in all. Other residents of the West Bank have to obtain special permits to enter the area.

===Fewer checkpoints and roadblocks===
In June 2004, &quot;The Washington Times&quot; reported that the reduced Israeli military incursions in Jenin have prompted efforts to rebuild damaged streets and buildings and a gradual return to a semblance of normality, and in a letter dated October 25, 2004, from the Israeli mission to Kofi Annan, Israel&#x27;s government pointed out that a number of restrictions east of the barrier have been lifted as a result of it, including a reduction in checkpoints from 71 to 47 and roadblocks from 197 to 111. &quot;The Jerusalem Post&quot; reports that, for some Palestinians who are Israeli citizens living in the Israeli Arab town of Umm el-Fahm (population 42,000) near Jenin, the barrier has &quot;significantly improved their lives&quot; because, on one hand, it prevents would-be thieves or terrorists from coming to their town and, on the other hand, has increased the flow of customers from other parts of Israel who would normally have patronised Palestinian business in the West Bank, resulting in an economic boom. The report states that the downsides are that the barrier has divided families in half and &quot;damaged Israeli Arabs&#x27; solidarity with the Palestinians living on the other side of the Green Line&quot;.

A UN report released in August 2005 observed that the existence of the barrier &quot;replaced the need for closures: movement within the northern West Bank, for example, is less restrictive where the Barrier has been constructed. Physical obstacles have also been removed in Ramallah and al-Bireh Governorate and Jerusalem Governorate where the Barrier is under construction.&quot; The report says that more freedom of movement in rural areas may ease Palestinian access to hospitals and schools, but also says that restrictions on movement between urban population centers have not significantly changed.

===Loss of land===
Parts of the barrier are built on land seized from Palestinians, or between Palestinians and their lands. In a 2009 report, the UN said that the most recent barrier route allocates more segments to be built on the Green Line itself compared to previous draft routes of the barrier. However, in its current route the barrier annexes 9.5% of the total area of the West Bank to the Israeli side of the barrier.

In early 2003, 63 shops straddling the Green Line were demolished by the IDF during construction of the wall in the village of Nazlat Issa. In August 2003, an additional 115 shops and stalls (an important source of income for several communities) and five to seven homes there were also demolished.

According to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA), 15 communities were to be directly affected, numbering about 138,593 Palestinians, including 13,450 refugee families, or 67,250 people. In addition to loss of land, in the city of Qalqilyah one-third of the city&#x27;s water wells lie on the other side of the barrier. The Israeli Supreme Court says the Israeli government&#x27;s rejection of accusations of a &quot;de facto&quot; annexation of these wells, stating that &quot;the construction of the fence does not affect the implementation of the water agreements determined in the (interim) agreement&quot;.

The United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Western Asia (ESCWA) estimates that in the north of the West Bank about 80 per cent of Palestinians who own land on the other side of the barrier have not received permits from the Israeli authorities, and hence cannot cultivate their fields.

Israel has built a barrier in the Jordan Valley near the Jordanian border. A plan to build another barrier between the West Bank and the Jordan valley was abandoned because of international condemnation after the 2004 International Court ruling, instead instituting a restrictive permit regime for Palestinians. However, it has changed the route to allow settlements to annex parcels of land. The existing barrier cuts off access to the Jordan River for Palestinian farmers in the West Bank. Israeli settlement councils already have de facto control of 86 percent of the Jordan Valley and the Dead Sea as the settler population steadily grows there. In 2013, Ehud Barak, Israeli Defense Minister at the time, proposed that Israel should consider unilateral disengagement from the West Bank and the dismantling of settlements beyond the separation barrier, but maintain a military presence in the Jordan Valley along the West Bank-Jordan border.

===Health and medical services===
Médecins du Monde, the Palestinian Red Crescent Society and Physicians for Human Rights-Israel have stated that the barrier &quot;harms West Bank health&quot;. Upon completion of the construction, the organizations predict, the barrier would prevent over 130,000 Palestinian children from being immunised, and deny more than 100,000 pregnant women (out of which 17,640 are high risk pregnancies) access to healthcare in Israel. In addition, almost a third of West Bank villages will suffer from lack of access to healthcare. After completion, many residents may lose complete access to emergency care at night. In towns near Jerusalem (Abu Dis and al-Eizariya), for example, average time for an ambulance to travel to the nearest hospital has increased from 10 minutes to over 110 minutes. A report from Physicians for Human Rights-Israel states that the barrier imposes &quot;almost-total separation&quot; on the hospitals from the population they are supposed to serve. The report also said that patients from the West Bank visiting Jerusalem&#x27;s Palestinian clinics declined by half from 2002 to 2003.
===Rights, freedom and mobility of Palestinians working in Israel===
The wall significantly impacts the rights, freedom and mobility of Palestinian workers especially. 
It represents for Palestinians a complex system of control, surveillance and oppression. According to the Washington Post, about 70000 Palestinians cross checkpoints daily to work in Israel, mainly in construction sites. Security forces at checkpoints have the authority to turn back Palestinians without reason or, as often is the case, turn a short commute into an hours-long, humiliating journey. Workers leave their homes in the very early morning, some as early as 2am, and spend hours commuting, not returning to their homes until the late evening. The military checkpoints they need to cross are usually overcrowded, in poor conditions and characterized by long processing times. They are herded through congested steel cages and metal turnstiles and go through invasive security checks. They are not allowed to take their own tools, food and drinks with them, adding an additional financial burden. Several human rights organizations, such as Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch, have reported human rights abuses inside checkpoints, including arbitrary arrests and unlawful shootings. The daily struggle and humiliation of going through a checkpoint is not only for workers but also for those communities that were cut in two by the presence of the separation wall. West Bank Palestinians who live on the Jerusalem side in areas like Nabi Samuel are forbidden to go to the Jerusalem site outside their homes and must cross a checkpoint to attend schools or go to work or to the hospital.

===Economic changes===

In 2013, the World Bank cited estimates of costs to the West Bank economy attributable to &quot;barriers&quot; combined with &quot;checkpoints and movement permits&quot; of USD $185m and $229m. Foreign Affairs contributor David Makovsky estimated the number of West Bank Palestinians who lived on the Israeli side in 2004 as &quot;fewer than one percent&quot; but noted that a larger number living in enclaves like Qalqiliya adjacent to the fence were also adversely affected. The Israeli human rights organisation B&#x27;Tselem says that &quot;thousands of Palestinians have difficulty going to their fields and marketing their produce in other areas of the West Bank. Farming is a primary source of income in the Palestinian communities situated along the Barrier&#x27;s route, an area that constitutes one of the most fertile areas in the West Bank. The harm to the farming sector is liable to have drastic economic effects on the residents – whose economic situation is already very difficult – and drive many families into poverty.&quot;

==Legality==
===United Nations Security Council===
In October 2003, a United Nations resolution to declare the barrier illegal where it deviates from the Green Line and should be torn down was vetoed by the US in the United Nations Security Council.

On May 19, 2004, the UN passed Security Council Resolution 1544 reiterating the obligation of Israel, the occupying Power, to abide scrupulously by its legal obligations and responsibilities under the Fourth Geneva Convention, and called on Israel to address its security needs within the boundaries of international law. In a special emergency session of the General Assembly, the United Nations asked the International Court of Justice [ICJ] to evaluate the legal status of the barrier. Israel chose not to accept ICJ jurisdiction nor make oral statements, and instead submitted a 246-page written statement containing the views of the Government of Israel on Jurisdiction and Propriety to the Court.

===International Court of Justice===
In a 2004 advisory opinion by the International Court of Justice, &quot;Israel cannot rely on a right of self-defence or on a state of necessity in order to preclude the wrongfulness of the construction of the wall&quot;. The Court asserted that &quot;the construction of the wall, and its associated régime, are contrary to international law.&quot;

So in the July 9, 2004, advisory opinion the ICJ advised that the barrier is a violation of international law, that it should be removed, that Arab residents should be compensated for any damage done, and that other states take action to obtain Israel&#x27;s compliance with the Fourth Geneva Convention. The ICJ said that an occupying power cannot claim that the lawful inhabitants of the occupied territory constitute a &quot;foreign&quot; threat for the purposes of Article 51 of the UN Charter. It also explained that necessity may constitute a circumstance precluding wrongfulness under certain very limited circumstances, but that Article 25 of the International Law Commission&#x27;s Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts (ARSIWA) bars a defense of necessity if the State has contributed to the situation of necessity. The Court cited illegal interference by the government of Israel with the Palestinian&#x27;s national right to self-determination; and land confiscations, house demolitions, the creation of enclaves, and restrictions on movement and access to water, food, education, health care, work, and an adequate standard of living in violation of Israel&#x27;s obligations under international law. The Court also said that Israeli settlements had been established and that Palestinians had been displaced in violation of Article 49, paragraph 6, of the Fourth Geneva Convention. On request of the ICJ, Palestine submitted a copious statement. The UN Fact Finding Mission and several UN Rapporteurs subsequently said that in the movement and access policy there has been a violation of the right not to be discriminated against on the basis of race or national origin.

Israeli supporters of the barrier stood in the plaza near the courthouse, holding the portraits of 927 terror victims. The organization Christians for Israel helped bring the No. 19 bus, on which eleven civilians were killed, to the Hague.

===Israel===
In April 2003, B&#x27;Tselem stated that &quot;Israel has made cynical use of security claims to justify grave human rights violations in the Occupied Territories...Among other things the determination of the route of the barrier was based on political considerations, the attempt to leave the settlements to the west of the barrier, and protection of access routes for religious sites – none of which are at all related to military considerations. This situation is likely to render the entire separation barrier project illegal according to international law.&quot;

On June 30, 2004, the Supreme Court of Israel ruled that a portion of the barrier west of Jerusalem violated the rights of Palestinians, and ordered of existing and planned barrier to be rerouted. However, it did rule that the barrier is legal in principle and accepted the Israeli government&#x27;s assertion that it is a security measure.

On September 15, 2005, the Supreme Court of Israel ordered the Israeli government to alter the route of the barrier to ensure that negative impacts on Palestinians would be minimized and proportional.

==Opinions of the barrier==
===United Nations===
In December 2003, Resolution ES-10/14 was adopted by the United Nations General Assembly in an emergency special session.&lt;ref name=&quot;ES-10/14&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; 90 states voted for, 8 against, 74 abstained. The resolution included a request to the International Court of Justice to urgently render an advisory opinion on the following question: What are the legal consequences arising from the construction of the wall being built by Israel, the occupying Power, in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including in and around East Jerusalem, as described in the report of the Secretary-General, considering the rules and principles of international law, including the Fourth Geneva Convention of 1949, and relevant Security Council and General Assembly resolutions? The court concluded that the barrier violated international law. On 20 July 2004, the UN General Assembly accepted Resolution ES-10/15 condemning the barrier with 150 countries voting for the resolution and 10 abstaining.&lt;ref name=&quot;ES-10/15&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; 6 countries voted against: Israel, the US, Australia, the Federated States of Micronesia, the Marshall Islands and Palau. The US and Israel rejected both the verdict and the resolution. All 25 members of the European Union voted in favour of the resolution after it was amended to include calls for Israelis and Palestinians to meet their obligations under the &quot;roadmap&quot; peace plan.

===Israeli opinions===
According to a survey conducted by the Tami Steinmetz Center for Peace Research, an academic research institution of Tel Aviv University, there was overwhelming support for the barrier among the Jewish population of Israel: 84% in March 2004 and 78% in June 2004.

Some Israelis oppose the barrier. The Israeli Peace Now movement has stated that while they would support a barrier that follows the 1949 Armistice lines, the &quot;current route of the fence is intended to destroy all chances of a future peace settlement with the Palestinians and to annex as much land as possible from the West Bank&quot; and that the barrier would &quot;only increase the blood to be spilt on both sides and continue the sacrificing of Israeli and Palestinian lives for the settlements.&quot; Some Israeli left wing activists, such as Anarchists Against the Wall and Gush Shalom, are active in protests against the barrier, especially in the West Bank towns of Bil&#x27;in and Jayyous.

Shaul Arieli, a senior member of the Council for Peace and Security and one of the architects of the Geneva Initiative wrote in &quot;Haaretz&quot; in March 2009 of the importance &quot;to complete the fence along a route based on security considerations.&quot; Arieli found the fence to be justified due to legitimate concerns of Palestinian terrorism and violence, but was critical of the then-government&#x27;s alleged negligence of completing the fence due to budgetary and political considerations. He called on the public to &quot;demand that the new government complete the fence quickly and along a logical route.&quot;

Daniel Ayalon, Israel&#x27;s ambassador to the United States, suggested that reduced ability to conduct attacks would &quot;save the political process&quot; because the barrier would neutralize the ability of militant groups &quot;to hold that process hostage&quot; by conducting these acts.

Natan Sharansky, Minister of Housing and Construction at the time, viewed the security fence as an option for Israel to defend itself, because the Palestinian Authority had not become a partner in fighting terror, as it was obliged to do under all the agreements that it signed

The Anti-Defamation League heavily criticized the ruling of the Court of Justice condemning the West Bank Barrier, asserting that the outcome was stacked against Israel in advance through the biased wording of the submission. It said that Israel was systematically excluded from any say in the Court&#x27;s makeup and asserted that an anti-Israel environment prevails at the General Assembly, which &quot;regularly demonize[s] Israel&quot;. According to the ADL, the politicized nature of the process that produced the opinion threatens to undermine the integrity of the Court and contravene constructive efforts to promote peace in the region.

===Palestinian opinions===
The Palestinian population and its leadership are essentially unanimous in opposing the barrier. A significant number of Palestinians have been separated from their own farmlands or their places of work or study, and many more will be separated as the barriers near Jerusalem are completed. Furthermore, because of its planned route as published by the Israeli government, the barrier is perceived as a plan to confine the Palestinian population to specific areas. They state that Palestinian institutions in Abu Dis will be prevented from providing services to residents in the East Jerusalem suburbs, and that a 10-minute walk has become a 3-hour drive in order to reach a gate, to go (if allowed) through a crowded military checkpoint, and drive back to the destination on the other side.

More broadly, Palestinian spokespersons, supported by many in the Israeli left wing and other organizations, say that the hardships imposed by the barrier will breed further discontent amongst the affected population and add to the security problem rather than solving it.

In his November 2006 interview with Al-Manar TV, Palestinian Islamic Jihad leader Ramadan Salah said that the barrier is an important obstacle, and that &quot;if it weren&#x27;t there, the situation would be entirely different.&quot;

The Palestinian National Authority has accused the U.S. of rewarding construction of the barrier and replied, &quot;[t]he U.S. assurances are being made at the expense of the Palestinian people and the Arab world without the knowledge of the legitimate Palestinian leadership. They are rewarding illegal occupation, settlement and the apartheid wall.&quot;

For over five years (2005–2010), hundreds of Palestinians and Israeli activists gathered every week to protest the barrier at the town of Bil&#x27;in. A number of Palestinian protesters have been killed by the IDF while protesting. Covert operatives of the Israeli government have posed as protesters and threw stones in the general direction of the IDF to create a pretext for arresting protesters. Protesters posed as members of the fictional &quot;Na&#x27;vi&quot; race of the major motion picture &quot;Avatar&quot; during protests following release of the movie, in an effort to compare the Palestinian struggle with that of the fictional Na&#x27;vi race, who must defend themselves and their homeland against foreign invaders.
Between 23 December 2013 and 5 January 2014 a major demonstration against the wall was staged in London, in the grounds of St James&#x27;s Church, Piccadilly. The demonstration was entitled &quot;Bethlehem Unwrapped&quot;, and featured a large section of replica wall, reproducing both the fabric of the Israeli wall, and the graffiti to be found on it. Protesters staffed the wall in order to explain the demonstration to visitors and passers-by. Large signs were erected, drawing attention to intentional protest against the wall. Particular reference was made to the International Court of Justice judgement of 9 July 2004 that the security wall contravened international law. The demonstration took place just days after the death of Nelson Mandela, and prominence was therefore given on billboards to Mandella&#x27;s statement &quot;The UN took a strong stand against apartheid...We know too well that our freedom is incomplete without the freedom of the Palestinians&quot;. The replica wall, which was 8 metres tall (the same height as the actual wall) was constructed as an art installation by Justin Butcher, Geof Thompson, and Dean Willars, who also credited Deborah Burtin of Tipping Point North South. They invited visitors to add additional graffiti, particularly in the forms of prayers for peace. St James&#x27; Church, which allowed the demonstration on its grounds, and permitted its own church building to be almost entirely hidden by the wall, issued a public statement supporting the right of Israel to defend its borders, but condemning the wall, and the suffering which it caused to Palestinian peoples. The church statement drew attention to the request of the World Council of Churches for all Christians to oppose the wall.

===Other International opinions===
====The Red Cross====
The Red Cross has declared the barrier in violation of the Geneva Convention. On February 18, 2004, The International Committee of the Red Cross stated that the Israeli barrier &quot;causes serious humanitarian and legal problems&quot; and goes &quot;far beyond what is permissible for an occupying power&quot;.

====Human rights organizations====
Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch and other Human rights groups have protested both the routing of the wall and the means by which the land to build the wall was obtained. The Israeli women of Machsom Watch regularly monitor events at checkpoints and report their findings. In a 2004 report Amnesty International wrote that &quot;The fence/wall, in its present configuration, violates Israel&#x27;s obligations under international humanitarian law.&quot;

They continue:

Since the summer of 2002 the Israeli army has been destroying large areas of Palestinian agricultural land, as well as other properties, to make way for a fence/wall which it is building in the West Bank.

In addition to the large areas of particularly fertile Palestinian farmland that have been destroyed, other larger areas have been cut off from the rest of the West Bank by the fence/wall.

The fence/wall is not being built between Israel and the Occupied Territories but mostly (close to 90%) inside the West Bank, turning Palestinian towns and villages into isolated enclaves, cutting off communities and families from each other, separating farmers from their land and Palestinians from their places of work, education and health care facilities and other essential services. This in order to facilitate passage between Israel and more than 50 illegal Israeli settlements located in the West Bank.

====World Council of Churches====
On February 20, 2004 the World Council of Churches demanded that Israel halt and reverse construction on the barrier and strongly condemned &quot;violations of human rights and humanitarian consequences&quot; that resulted from the construction of the barrier. While acknowledging Israel&#x27;s serious security concerns and asserting that the construction of the barrier on its own territory would not have been a violation of international law, the statement called on &quot;member Churches, Ecumenical Councils of Churches, Christian World Communions and specialized ministries of churches to condemn the wall as an act of unlawful annexation.&quot;

====United States opinion====

In 2003, when the Bush administration was considering reducing loan guarantees to Israel to discourage construction of the fence, then Secretary of State Colin Powell criticized the project. He said, &quot;A nation is within its rights to put up a fence if it sees the need for one. However, in the case of the Israeli fence, we are concerned when the fence crosses over onto the land of others.&quot; Response from pro-Israel members of Congress criticized the possible reduction in loan assistance. For example, Senator Joe Lieberman, D-Conn., said, &quot;The administration&#x27;s threat to cut aid to Israel unless it stops construction of a security fence is a heavy-handed tactic.&quot; Lieberman criticized the threat as improper between allies, and continued, &quot;The Israeli people have the right to defend themselves from terrorism, and a security fence may be necessary to achieve this.&quot;

On April 14, 2004, President of the United States George W. Bush said &quot;In light of new realities on the ground, including already existing major Israeli population centers, it is unrealistic to expect that the outcome of final status negotiations will be a full and complete return to the armistice lines of 1949, and all previous efforts to negotiate a two-state solution have reached the same conclusion.&quot;

On May 25, 2005, Bush said, &quot;I think the wall is a problem. And I discussed this with Ariel Sharon. It is very difficult to develop confidence between the Palestinians and Israel with a wall snaking through the West Bank.&quot; The following year, addressing the issue of the barrier as a future border, he said in a letter to Sharon on April 14, 2004 that it &quot;should be a security rather than political barrier, should be temporary rather than permanent and therefore not prejudice any final status issues including final borders, and its route should take into account, consistent with security needs, its impact on Palestinians not engaged in terrorist activities.&quot; President Bush reiterated this position during a May 26, 2005 joint press conference with Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas in the Rose Garden.

In 2005, Hillary Clinton, at the time a U.S. Senator from New York, said she supports the separation fence Israel is building along the edges of the West Bank, and that the onus is on the Palestinian Authority to fight terrorism. &quot;This is not against the Palestinian people,&quot; she said during a tour of a section of the barrier being built around Jerusalem. &quot;This is against the terrorists. The Palestinian people have to help to prevent terrorism. They have to change the attitudes about terrorism.&quot;

In 2007, Senator Charles Schumer said: &quot;As long as the Palestinians send terrorists onto school buses and to nightclubs to blow up people, Israel has no choice but to build the Security Wall.&quot;

====European Union opinion====
According to EU foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton, the EU considers the barrier to be illegal to the extent it is built on Palestinian land.

====Canadian opinion====
The Canadian Government recognizes Israel&#x27;s right to protect its citizens from terrorist attacks, including through the restriction of access to its territory, and by building a barrier on its own territory for security purposes. However, it opposes the barrier&#x27;s incursion into and the disruption of occupied territories. Considering the West Bank (including East Jerusalem) to be &quot;occupied territory&quot;, the Canadian government considers the barrier to be contrary to international law under the Fourth Geneva Convention. It opposes the barrier and the expropriations and the demolition of houses and economic infrastructure preceding its construction.

===Border opinions===
Although the Barrier is purported to be a temporary defense against Palestinian attacks, many view it as significant in terms of future negotiations over Israel&#x27;s final borders. Some speculate that because sections of the barrier are not built along the Green Line but in the West Bank, the real purpose is to acquire territory. Some people describe the barrier as the &quot;de facto&quot; future border of the State of Israel. James Zogby, president of the Arab American Institute, has said that the barrier has &quot;unilaterally helped to demarcate the route for future Israeli control over huge West Bank settlement blocks and large swathes of West Bank land&quot;. According to B&#x27;Tselem, &quot;the overall features of the separation barrier and the considerations that led to determination of the route give the impression that Israel is relying on security arguments to unilaterally establish facts on the ground ...&quot; Chris McGreal in &quot;The Guardian&quot; writes that the barrier is, &quot;evidently intended to redraw Israel&#x27;s borders&quot;.

Some have speculated that the barrier will prejudice the outcome of border negotiations in favor of the Israelis. Yossi Klein Halevi, Israeli correspondent for &quot;The New Republic&quot;, writes that &quot;[b]uilding over the green line, by contrast, reminds Palestinians that every time they&#x27;ve rejected compromise – whether in 1937, 1947, or 2000 – the potential map of Palestine shrinks... The fence is a warning: If Palestinians don&#x27;t stop terrorism and forfeit their dream of destroying Israel, Israel may impose its own map on them... and, because Palestine isn&#x27;t being restored but invented, its borders are negotiable.&quot;

The Israeli Deputy Defence Minister in 2000 stated that the barrier did not necessarily delineate the boundaries of a future Palestinian State.

On March 9, 2006, &quot;The New York Times&quot; quoted then-acting Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert as stating that if his Kadima party wins the upcoming national elections, he would seek to set Israel&#x27;s permanent borders by 2010, and that the boundary would run along or close to the barrier.

In 2012 it was reported that Israel had presented principles for drawing a border, which essentially propose to turn the West Bank separation barrier into the border with a future Palestinian state.

===Relation to Israeli apartheid===

Ahmad Hajihosseini, Observer for the Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC), said that building and maintaining the wall is a crime of apartheid,&lt;ref name=&quot;UN_SC/7895&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; isolating Palestinian communities in the West Bank and consolidating the annexation of Palestinian land by Israeli settlements.

Malcolm Hedding, a South African minister who worked against South African apartheid and executive director of the International Christian Embassy in Jerusalem, said that the West Bank barrier has nothing to do with apartheid but is instead about Israel&#x27;s self-defense. 

===Art, books, film===


The wall has been used as a canvas for many paintings and writings. It has been called the &quot;world&#x27;s largest protest graffiti&quot;. Some of these (but not all) have been removed by the Israelis, and sometimes by people on the Palestinian side.

Graffiti on the Palestinian side of the wall has been one of many forms of protest against its existence, demanding an end to the barrier, or criticizing its builders and its existence (&quot;Welcome to the Ghetto-Abu Dis&quot;).

In August 2005, U.K. graffiti artist Banksy painted nine images on the Palestinian side of the barrier. He describes the barrier as &quot;the ultimate activity holiday destination for graffiti writers&quot;, and returned in December 2007 with new images for &quot;Santa&#x27;s ghetto&quot; in Bethlehem.

The exhibition &quot;Santa&#x27;s Ghetto in Bethlehem 2007&quot; was co-organized by Banksy and a number of other artists with the aim of drawing attention to poverty in the West Bank and boosting tourism. On the wall, it features, among other images, a peace dove dressed in a bulletproof vest that is being aimed at, a young girl frisking a soldier, a donkey that is facing a soldier who is checking his identity papers, as well as a rat, one of Banksy&#x27;s recurring themes, with a slingshot. One of Italian artist Blu&#x27;s contributions to the project, featured a walled Christmas tree surrounded by a number of stumps. American contemporary artist Ron English pasted portraits of Mickey Mouse dressed as a Palestinian with the slogan &quot;You are not in Disneyland anymore&quot; on the wall. In an expression of frustration, Palestinian artist &quot;Trash&quot;, glued the lower part of a leg on the wall that is appearing to kick through it.

Although many artists received positive attention and reviews, some Palestinian people had negative opinions toward the artists&#x27; movement. A street artist from New York, Swoon, put two works on the Sentry towers in Bethlehem. She did not anticipate that some Palestinians would be opposed to her efforts. Swoon states that there was much enthusiasm from the kids of the Aida refugee camp, who were excited about the new artwork going on the wall. While the kids were excited, many elders believed that the children would grow up with the wrong, positive idea of the wall. One elder from the refugee camp claimed that &quot;they don&#x27;t necessarily want the kids to start viewing that area positively, and so they see the work as a thing of beauty, but in a place where beauty shouldn&#x27;t be&quot; (Parry, 10). Most international artists felt that they were creating &quot;something for the people trapped behind wall, as well as creating an international symbol that would be broadcast around the world. [The elder man] wasn&#x27;t speaking about international symbols, but about what it means to live in the shadow of an 80 foot guard tower&quot; (Parry, 10). Although the graffiti artists felt that they were making a statement with their pieces that would help bring attention and help to the Palestinians, many Palestinians feel that it turns the wall into something beautiful. By painting on the wall, some Palestinians feel that the wall turns into a work of art instead &quot;of an aggressive prison Wall&quot; (Parry, 10). Of course, transforming the wall into something positive was not the intention of the artists. They thought that their work would bring out the oppressiveness and the emotion responses of the people affected by the wall.

On June 21, 2006, when he visited Israel to give a concert, Pink Floyd&#x27;s Roger Waters wrote &quot;Tear down the wall&quot; on the wall, a phrase from the Pink Floyd album &quot;The Wall&quot;.

In 2007, with their project &quot;Face2Face&quot;, French artists JR and &quot;Marco&quot;, organized what was then (until at least 2010), considered to be the largest illegal photography exhibition ever made. In monumental formats, portraits of Israelis and Palestinians of similar professions and backgrounds were pasted next to each other on the wall. The idea was to highlight similarities rather than differences between the peoples. The project spanned over eight cities on both sides of the wall such as Bethlehem, Jericho, Ramallah and Jerusalem. The project was subsequently hosted by a number of exhibitions around the world including the Biennale di Venezia in Italy, the Foam-Musée de la Photographie in Amsterdam, the summer photography festival &quot;Recontres d&#x27;Arles&quot; in Arles, Southern France, Artitud in Berlin, Germany, Artcurial in Paris, France and the Rath Museum in Geneva, Switzerland. JR&#x27;s work, including &quot;Face2Face&quot; is currently shown at the Watari-Um Museum in Tokyo, Japan.

As part of a Dutch–Palestinian collaboration, led by Palestinian activist Faris Arouri, Internet users were invited to submit 80-character long messages to be spray-painted on the security barrier in exchange for a donation of 30 Euro. Messages that included or incited racism, hate, violence or pornography were rejected. About two-thirds of the money raised was donated to social, cultural and educational grassroots projects such as the renovation of the Peace and Freedom Youth Forum&#x27;s open Youth Center in Bir Zeit. When the project was ended, it was claimed to have reached 550,000,000 people worldwide and placed 1,498 messages on the wall. One of the organizers of &quot;Send a message&quot;, Justus van Oel, a Dutch theater director, commissioned South African anti-apartheid activist and theologian Farid Esack to compose a letter to be placed on the wall in 2009. The result was a 1,998-word letter in English written in a single line and stretching over near the town of Ramallah, comparing the situation in the Palestinian territories to the South African apartheid era.

The British photojournalist William Parry has recently published a book entitled &quot;Against the Wall&quot;. The wall was the primary focus of British playwright David Hare&#x27;s dramatic monologue &quot;Wall&quot;, which is being adapted as a live-action/animated feature-length documentary by the National Film Board of Canada, to be completed in 2014.

The barrier is also the subject of the 2011 documentary film, &quot;5 Broken Cameras&quot;, which documents the story of Emad Burnat, a Palestinian farmer of the Palestinian village of Bil&#x27;in, who had intended to use his videocamera to record vignettes of his son&#x27;s childhood but ended up filming the resistance movement to the Israeli separation wall that was erected through his village. This award-winning film tells the story of the nonviolent protests of the village residents and the international and Israeli activists who join them, and of how in the course of his filming one after another of his cameras is shot or smashed.

==Other barriers==

Two similar barriers, the Israeli Gaza Strip barrier and the Israeli-built 7–9 meter (23–30 ft) wall separating Gaza from Egypt (temporarily breached on January 23, 2008), which is currently under Egyptian control, are also controversial.

<text>In microprocessor design, gate count refers to the number of logic gates built with transistors and other electronic devices, that are needed to implement a design. Even with today&#x27;s processor technology providing what was formerly considered impossible numbers of gates in a single chip, gate counts remain one of the most important overall factors in the end price of a chip. Designs with fewer gates will typically cost less, and for this reason gate count remains a commonly used metric in the industry.

<doc id="367937" wikidata="Q515857" url="?curid=367937" title="Jack Agazarian">
<text>Jack Charles Stanmore Agazarian (27 August 1915 – 29 March 1945), code name Marcel, was an agent for the United Kingdom&#x27;s clandestine Special Operations Executive (SOE) organization in France during World War II. The purpose of SOE was to conduct espionage, sabotage, and reconnaissance in countries occupied by Nazi Germany and other Axis powers. SOE agents allied themselves with French Resistance groups and supplied them with weapons and equipment parachuted in from England. Agazarian was a wireless operator with the Prosper network based in Paris.

Agazarian was captured by the Germans on 30 July 1943 when he showed up for a scheduled meeting with a fellow agent. The Germans had captured the other agent and were trying to lure the deputy leader of SOE&#x27;s French Section, Nicolas Bodington, to the meeting, but Agazarian attended instead. He was later executed. Agazarian&#x27;s wife Francine was also a SOE agent.

==Early life==
Agazarian was born in London, to an Armenian father, Berge Rupen Agazarian, and French mother, Jacqueline Marie-Louise Le Chevalier, the second of six children. He was educated in both France and England at Dulwich College. After completing his education he worked with his father in the family business. He joined the Royal Air Force in 1940 soon after the outbreak of World War II and the SOE&#x27;s French Section on 30 May 1942 and was trained as a wireless operator. His younger brother, Noel Agazarian, also joined the Royal Air Force, but as a Spitfire pilot; he went on to be a flying ace in the Battle of Britain before being killed in action on 16 May 1941. His sister Monique Agazarian flew for the Air Transport Auxiliary during the same conflict.

Agazarian received an honorary commission as a pilot officer in the RAFVR on 10 September 1942. He was promoted to honorary flying officer on 12 January 1943.

==Special Operations Executive==

During his training Agazarian was well-liked by the instructors at SOE who described him as &quot;intelligent, witty, brilliant, and clever.&quot; M.R.D. Foot, the official historian of the SOE, described Agazarian as &quot;handsome and dashing.&quot;

On 29 December 1942 Agazarian parachuted into France near Étrépagny and made his way to Paris to join the newly created Prosper network headed by Francis Suttill. He was the second of Prosper&#x27;s two radio operators. Gilbert Norman was Prosper&#x27;s other wireless operator and Andrée Borrel was the network&#x27;s courier. In January 1943, the three were joined by Henri Déricourt, air operations officer, who arranged for clandestine air flights between England and northern France to transport agents and supplies. 
Prosper was SOE&#x27;s most important network in France. The task of Suttill and his associates was to create and assist a resistance movement that would harass and weaken the German occupiers of France and contribute to the success of an allied invasion of France in 1943. (The plans for a 1943 invasion were later abandoned, and the invasion did not take place until 6 June 1944.) Prosper had early and rapid success, setting up or reviving more than 60 resistance networks (or circuits) in northern France and managing and supplying a large number of SOE agents and French operatives. Agazarian&#x27;s wife, Francine Agazarian, joined him in Paris in March 1943 as a second courier for Prosper.

Competent wireless operators were scarce and Agazarian and Norman were busy transmitting and receiving messages with SOE headquarters in London. Agazarian reported that he sent and received messages for more than 20 SOE agents. That was worrisome from a security standpoint as each SOE network was supposed to have its own wireless operator with little or no contact between networks or even among the members of the same network. The size and scope of Prosper was also a security problem. Agents congregated in the same apartments and met each other in the same cafes. Norman, Borrel, and Agazarian and his wife met frequently to play poker at a Paris cafe.

===The Dutch Affair===
In May 1943, Hermann Giskes, head of German Abwehr intelligence in the Netherlands, sent two Dutch agents posing as SOE agents to Paris. The Abwehr agents learned from double agents how to find Agazarian and other Prosper agents and met them at the cafe they frequented. The Dutch agents said they needed to return to England. Agazarian accepted the two Dutch men as authentic SOE agents and took on the task of arranging a flight for them to England with Déricourt, the air operations officer. As it turned out, the objective of the Dutch agents was to infiltrate and gather information about the Prosper network. On 9 June, in a curious affair perhaps indicating competition and lack of coordination between the German Abwehr and the Gestapo, the Gestapo staged a raid on the cafe and arrested or pretended to arrest one of the two Dutch agents. Agazarian escaped and continued to work with the other Dutch agent.

Suttill was disturbed by the incident, regarding Agazarian as careless and too ambitious to have his own SOE network rather than working for Suttill as a wireless operator. 
He sent Agazarian and his wife back to England on a clandestine flight the night of 16/17 June. At SOE headquarters in London, Agazarian defended himself against the charges by Suttill and also reported that Déricourt was a security risk.

===Prosper destroyed===
Acting on the information collected by the Dutch infiltrators and other sources, on 23 June the Germans began arresting members of Prosper including Norman, Borrel, and Suttill. Over the next three months, thirty SOE agents and hundreds of local agents associated with Prosper were arrested, of whom 167 are known to have been deported to Germany where about one-half were executed, killed, or died in concentration camps. The Germans also captured Norman&#x27;s wireless and sent or forced Norman to send messages to SOE in London to project an air of normalcy in Paris. The SOE F Section chief, Maurice Buckmaster ignored clear indications in the text of the messages that they were not authentic. A newly arrived wireless operator, Noor Inayat Khan, initially escaped arrest and informed SOE headquarters of the arrests although the situation in Paris was unclear. The SOE believed that Gilbert Norman was still free because of the messages sent from his machine.

===The Bodington mission===

Agazarian returned to France via airplane on the night of 22–23 July 1943 with F Section Deputy Nicolas Bodington in a mission to determine the status of the Prosper network. They were met by Déricourt, who had not been arrested and was under suspicion of being a German double agent, but was Bodington&#x27;s friend. Through an exchange of radio messages between Agazarian and &quot;Gilbert Norman&quot; (actually the Germans) a meeting was arranged with &quot;Norman&quot; on 30 July at an address in the rue de Rome near Gare St-Lazare. Bodington and Agazarian were suspicious. According to M.R.D. Foot, they tossed a coin to see who would attend the meeting and Agazarian lost. However, an eye-witness said that Bodington ordered Agazarian to attend the meeting. Agazarian was arrested by the Germans when he arrived at the meeting site. Bodington later returned safely to England to report that the Prosper network had indeed been destroyed by the Germans.

According to Foot, Agazarian was tortured but revealed nothing about Prosper during his imprisonment at Fresnes prison near Paris. He was later moved to Flossenbürg concentration camp in Germany and was executed on 29 March 1945. Just prior to his execution Agazarian tapped out in Morse code on the wall of his cell a message to his wife. The Danish prisoner who received the message later delivered it to SOE and Agazarian&#x27;s wife.

===Consequences===
The circumstances surrounding the destruction of SOE&#x27;s Prosper Network and the arrest of Agazarian and other SOE agents has stimulated debate among historians of the SOE. Henri Déricourt&#x27;s role in the destruction of Prosper remains unclear; after the war he was tried as a double agent and admitted contacts with the Germans, but acquitted because of testimony in his favour by his friend Bodington—who has himself been accused of being involved in a mysterious plot by British intelligence to sacrifice SOE agents to distract German attentions from the pending invasions of Italy and Normandy. Foot and Suttill&#x27;s son, Francis, have debunked the conspiracy theories about the destruction of Prosper. Foot attributed Prosper&#x27;s downfall to &quot;incompetence and insecurity.&quot;

==Legacy==
Jack Agazarian is honored on the Runnymede Memorial in Surrey, England, on the SOE memorial at Flossenbürg, and also on the Roll of Honor on the Valençay SOE Memorial in Valençay, in the Indre département of France. He received a posthumous mention in dispatches on 13 June 1946, and was also awarded the &quot;Légion d&#x27;honneur&quot; and &quot;Croix de guerre&quot; by France.

<text>Helpless is a play by Dusty Hughes which premièred at the Donmar Warehouse, London on March 2, 2000. It is set in England before, during, and after the 1997 general elections, which resulted in New Labour&#x27;s landslide victory and in Tony Blair becoming prime minister.

==Outline of the plot==
Will and Claire are typical children of the 1960s: They had their socialist and Marxist ideals and, a couple back then, rebelled against The Establishment and, generally, tried to fight for what they considered the right causes. They also tried to adapt their own lifestyle to their ideals. But a quarter of a century or more later, circumstances have forced them to change: Will and Claire have long split up. Will is now a minor actor doing TV commercials and sharing his flat with his grown-up daughter, Frankie. Claire is abroad most of the time doing charity work in Third World countries. Although raised to be a critical and independent young woman, Frankie has nevertheless adopted one or two characteristics of her own generation. When the play opens she is having an affair with Ben, a young man her age who works in the phone centre of some courier service.

Will meets a woman in her early thirties, Kate, who is desperate to find a man who will make her pregnant. She thinks she has found the right one in Will when they meet by chance. Will is too weak to openly tell her that, at 48, he would rather not be a father again. At the same time, at a book launch, Frankie—who goes there instead of her father—is chatted up by Hugh. Hugh is in fact her godfather and an old friend of her parents&#x27;, but over the past decades they have drifted apart. At first Frankie openly tells him that he is too old for her (&quot;I don&#x27;t do dinners&quot;), but then she genuinely (or so) falls in love with him and chucks Ben, who, as a consequence, turns pathological and starts following her around, declaring his love for her. Hugh has become a bestselling author under the &quot;nom de plume&quot; of Alice Wilde, writing popular novels where &quot;something happens in every paragraph&quot; (Will). This is how Hugh has got rid of his old convictions—by making money and being successful (and even being offered an OBE). He has left his wife and his three kids and now starts living with Frankie.

Gradually, the follies of their youth come to the surface. Early in May 1997, at Hugh&#x27;s flat, they all come together to have an election party (with the TV turned off), clinging to what has been left of their left-wing ideals and reminiscing about the old days. (For example, Will has brought two heavy boxes containing all his vinyl records of the 1960s and 1970s, which he gives to Frankie as a present.) They smoke a joint together (including Frankie—this is how she has been brought up, too). Their meeting is also some kind of reunion: for the first time after more than a year, Will and Claire see their daughter again.

From Hugh&#x27;s point of view, their (married) life is not really so great as may be expected. Hugh misses his children enormously (they still phone him and tell him about the little things they have just been doing) but he is not at all encouraged by Frankie to go and see them. Hugh has been given a seven-figure contract for three new novels, but now, after the first one, he seems to have writer&#x27;s block. Hugh and Frankie have been travelling around a lot, Hugh has sold his house in India, and under Frankie&#x27;s influence, they have given a considerable amount of money to charitable causes (the wrong ones, Claire thinks). Hugh asks Will to explain his looming financial crisis to Frankie, but Will refuses (&quot;She&#x27;s your problem now.&quot;).

During that election party Claire, high on pot, talks about her fling with Hugh way back in the 1970s—an affair Will knew about and (willy-nilly) approved of but which is news to the horrified Frankie. It turns out that Claire&#x27;s life has not been easy: She has been held responsible for the deaths of a group of freedom fighters in Africa who, as she claims, acted against her instructions and who were shot by enemies. As far as her private life is concerned, she admits that she has been chasing a French doctor across half the continent, but in the end he found someone else. Now she offers Will to move in with her again.

Will, however, has other plans. He has an on-and-off relationship with Kate. It takes Kate a long time (too long really) to find out that Will does not want to make her pregnant (&quot;Did you come this morning? Did you ejaculate?&quot;—this is what she asks him in front of the others. Only gradually does he admit that he has faked an orgasm.). In order not to have to admit that he is unwilling to be a father again, he is even prepared to pay £2,000 for artificial insemination (IVF). Will and Kate go to the clinic together, Kate is operated on and six of her eggs are removed from her womb for insemination with Will&#x27;s sperm. But Will is not capable (mentally rather than physically) to ejaculate in the small room that has been provided for that purpose. (He claims to be completely exhausted, and that his mobile phone started ringing while he was trying.) So Kate walks out on him. In the final scene, however, she is nine months pregnant. Will readily admits he is not the father but he and Kate will stay together, and he will assist her in bringing up her child, although—the biological father being black (&quot;Nigerian&quot;) -- everybody will realize that it is not his child.

==From the reviews==
&quot;If anyone out there wonders whatever happened to the hard-Left, young things of the Seventies, Dusty Hughes has an answer. In his appealing comedy of disillusion and disappointment, Hughes sets his sights upon three lapsed Lefties for whom the middle-aged pursuit of love, and particularly young lovers, has replaced politics. Souls have been sold. Ideals put out to grass. And Hughes puts a genial cynicism to work at his middle-aged trio&#x27;s expense. But the ample mockery to which he subjects these lost-hopers is not hostile. For Hughes was fairly far to the Left in his own youth. &quot;Helpless&quot;&#x27;s rueful fun is essentially lighthearted. It never stoops to serious political argument or recriminations. But, oh, how the play looks back in witty nostalgia to a lost England of plenty when we &quot;had everything. Free orange juice. Free milk. Free education. Free love…&quot; Hughes skims lightly and at speed over things political. His 90-minute play is far more a light comedy of sexual and social manners, made piquant by the gulf between the generations, than it is political elegy.&quot; (&quot;The London Evening Standard&quot;).

&quot;Utterly slick and relentlessly determined to entertain, &quot;Helpless&quot;, a new play by Dusty Hughes at the Donmar Warehouse, lives solely on the surface. Its six characters all sound like mere Characters In Plays, nothing more. They have flamboyant entrance lines in which they draw attention to themselves and deliver more plot exposition than is sane; they go in for longer-than-long conversations of oneliners (like endless tennis rallies between players you don&#x27;t care about); they do a great deal of speaking at cross-purposes. All of which makes all six of them deeply irritating, and all of which proves wholly contrived. Hughes&#x27;s themes feel like so much tokenism. None of the characters is believable. Or interesting. Worst, in a play about different kinds of liberal socialists between the late 1990s and today, the unspontaneous soundbite artificiality of the way they talk just sounds like so much spin.&quot; (&quot;The Financial Times&quot;).</text><links>

<text>Honeymoon Suite is a Canadian rock band formed in 1981 in Niagara Falls, Ontario. The band&#x27;s name was a nod to the fact that Niagara Falls is the unofficial honeymoon capital of the world.

==History==
=== 1981–1985 ===
The band was originally formed in 1981 by Johnnie Dee (vocals, guitar), Brad Bent (keyboards, vocals) and Mike Lengyell (drums, formerly with The Diodes). By 1983, the line-up changed, with Dee (the only original remaining member) now on rhythm guitar and lead vocals, along with new recruits Derry Grehan on lead guitar and Dave Betts on drums, both of whom had recorded two albums as members of Toronto-based new wave group Steve Blimkie and the Reason. Grehan became the band&#x27;s primary songwriter, and penned &quot;New Girl Now,&quot; which won them an unsigned band contest put on by Toronto radio station Q107.

Various keyboard players and bassists came and left during this time, but on the strength of &quot;New Girl Now,&quot; WEA Canada signed the band to the label. Ray Coburn was added as a permanent new member on keyboards as the sessions got underway for the group&#x27;s debut LP, but the band still had no bass player so bassist Brian Brackstone was recruited as a session player. Brackstone played on the entire album; bassist Gary Lalonde (formerly with Rose and Toronto) was added to the line-up after the album was completed and appeared in the album&#x27;s group photos and played with the band live. 
The band&#x27;s self-titled debut album, produced by Tom Treumuth, was released in June 1984. The album featured four charting hits in Canada: a completely re-recorded version of &quot;New Girl Now,&quot; &quot;Burning In Love,&quot; &quot;Wave Babies,&quot; and &quot;Stay In the Light.&quot; &quot;New Girl Now&quot; was also Honeymoon Suite&#x27;s first single to reach the top-50 in the United States.

Their follow-up album, &quot;The Big Prize&quot;, produced by Bruce Fairbairn, was equally successful in Canada with four more hits: &quot;Bad Attitude,&quot; &quot;Feel It Again,&quot; &quot;What Does It Take,&quot; and &quot;All Along You Knew.&quot; Grehan still wrote the lion&#x27;s share of the band&#x27;s material, but Dee and Coburn also contributed songs to this album; &quot;Feel It Again&quot;, a Coburn composition, reached the Top 40 in the US, while Grehan&#x27;s &quot;What Does It Take&quot; reached #52, buoyed by its inclusion on the soundtrack for the John Cusack film &quot;One Crazy Summer&quot;. In 1989, &quot;Bad Attitude&quot; was featured in the series finale of &quot;Miami Vice&quot;, played during a Ferrari driving segment that mirrored one from the series&#x27; pilot episode, continuing throughout Crockett and Tubbs&#x27; final battle.

=== 1986–2001 ===
In 1986, keyboardist Ray Coburn left the band, replaced by Rob Preuss of Burlington, Ontario-based Spoons. Also during 1986, the band produced the track &quot;Those Were the Days&quot; for the Charlie Sheen film &quot;The Wraith&quot;.

In the spring of 1987, the band performed the title track for the Mel Gibson film &quot;Lethal Weapon&quot;, which was composed by Michael Kamen. In the winter of 1987, the band started work on their third album in L.A. Unfortunately, Johnnie Dee was hit by a car at LAX airport, breaking his leg in several places and required surgery to insert a ten-inch pin to help the leg heal properly. While Dee was recovering in the hospital, one-time Doobie Brothers member Michael McDonald was brought in to help out with the recording sessions; he wrote lyrics and sang back up on &quot;Long Way Back,&quot; a forthcoming track for their next album.

In 1988, their third album was finally released: &quot;Racing After Midnight&quot;, produced by Ted Templeman (of Van Halen fame) and Jeff Hendrickson. That album made the top 10 in Canada, but was not as successful in the U.S. Singles included &quot;Love Changes Everything,&quot; &quot;Looking Out for Number One,&quot; &quot;Cold Look&quot; (Europe only), and &quot;It&#x27;s Over Now.&quot; By now, while Grehan was still the primary songwriter, Dee and Preuss frequently co-wrote with Grehan.

In 1989, the band released their first greatest hits compilation, &quot;The Singles&quot;, which included two new charting singles in Canada: &quot;Still Loving You&quot; and &quot;Long Way,&quot; both written by Grehan. Preuss left and Coburn rejoined the band in time to embark on &quot;The Singles&quot; tour, which would turn out to be the last tour featuring the band&#x27;s classic line-up until 2007.

By 1991, Lalonde and Betts had left the band, and were replaced by Steve Webster (from Billy Idol&#x27;s band) on bass, and Jorn Anderson (from Fludd and Alannah Myles) on drums. The band returned to the studio to craft &quot;Monsters Under the Bed&quot; with Paul Northfield producing and the team of Grehan/Coburn/Dee was responsible for the songwriting. Singles &quot;Say You Don&#x27;t Know Me&quot; and &quot;The Road&quot; were moderately successful in Canada. 

Ray Coburn left the band again after the release of this album and was replaced on keyboards by Peter Nunn. Jorn Anderson also left the band during this time and was replaced by drummer Creighton Doane (from Harem Scarem) for the &quot;Monsters Under the Bed&quot; Tour. Creighton continued to play drums with the band for next few years, appearing on their first live album &quot;13 Live&quot; released in 1995.

The band continued to tour in the &#x27;90s, although many line-up changes continued to occur, with only Dee and Grehan remaining as the consistent members. Sass Jordan bassist Stan Miczek joined in 1998 for the first of his 3 two-year stints with the band.

=== 2002–present ===

In 2002, they released their first new studio album in 11 years, &quot;Lemon Tongue&quot;. Playing on the album were Grehan and Dee, who were by now the group&#x27;s only official members, and who also wrote all the songs as a team. Also appearing on &quot;Lemon Tongue&quot; were Peter Nunn and Gary Brent on keyboards; Rob Laidlaw on bass; and Randy Cooke on drums. The album was released on an independent label and leaned towards a more artistic and adventurous direction than their previous rock releases. The European release of this album was titled &quot;Dreamland&quot; and featured many track changes, dropping five songs and adding four others, including a remake of their 1989 Canadian hit &quot;Still Lovin&#x27; You.&quot; The credited band on the &quot;Dreamland&quot; album (and presumably the band that recorded the new tracks) consisted of Dee, Grehan, Laidlaw, Nunn and new drummer Bret Carrigan.

In 2004, Dee released a solo album (&quot;Songs in Dee&quot;) featuring backing by the other members of Honeymoon Suite, along with guest musicians such as Kim Mitchell and Rik Emmett.

In 2006, the band released another greatest hits collection entitled &quot;Feel It Again: An Anthology&quot;, a 2-CD set featuring most of the band&#x27;s singles, selected album tracks, and rare and unreleased material.

In June 2007, the band officially announced the return of a reunited classic line-up of Johnnie Dee, Derry Grehan, Ray Coburn, Gary Lalonde, and Dave Betts. The band toured extensively throughout Canada in 2007 and 2008. However, only Johnnie Dee and Derry Grehan appeared on the new 2008 CD &quot;Clifton Hill&quot;, produced by Tom Treumuth (who produced the self-titled &quot;Honeymoon Suite&quot; debut album in 1984), and named after the famous landmark in the centre of the tourist activity in Niagara Falls. The album was released in Canada in late September 2008 on Koch Records and subsequently by Italian melodic rock label Frontiers Records on October 10, 2008. The new album is described by guitarist Derry Grehan as &quot;somewhat of a return musically to the sound that we had in the &#x27;80s.&quot;

In 2009, the band continued to tour Canada and select Northeastern United States cities. However, on September 1, 2009, it was announced that the band had again parted ways with original keyboardist Ray Coburn. Peter Nunn returned to the band&#x27;s line-up to replace him for the second time. The band made an appearance at Firefest 6 Nottingham, England in October, 2009.

On 18 November 2016, Honeymoon Suite released a 9 track EP, the first new music in 8 years, titled &quot;Hands Up&quot; on PledgeMusic website.

In February 2017, it was announced that Honeymoon Suite would appear at Rockingham Festival 2017, this to be held at Nottingham Trent University, UK, between 20 and 22 October 2017, the band scheduled to appear on Friday 20th. In the months approaching Rockingham 2017, the band cancelled their show to pursue a different opportunity. Their slot was replaced by John Parr.

On 26 September 2019, the band released their new single &quot;Tell Me What You Want&quot; on YouTube. On 19 June 2020, they issued another single entitled &quot;Find What You&#x27;re Looking For.&quot;

On February 16, 2024, Honeymoon Suite released their new album entitled &quot;Alive&quot; through Frontiers music.

<doc id="367947" wikidata="Q332580" url="?curid=367947" title="Thomas Hughes">
<text>Thomas Hughes (20 October 1822 – 22 March 1896) was an English lawyer, judge, politician and author. He is most famous for his novel &quot;Tom Brown&#x27;s School Days&quot; (1857), a semi-autobiographical work set at Rugby School, which Hughes had attended. It had a lesser-known sequel, &quot;Tom Brown at Oxford&quot; (1861).

Hughes had numerous other interests, in particular as a Member of Parliament, in the British co-operative movement, and in a settlement—Rugby, Tennessee, USA—reflecting his values.

== Early life ==
Hughes was the second son of John Hughes, editor of the &quot;Boscobel Tracts&quot; (1830), and was born in Uffington, Berkshire (now Oxfordshire). He had six brothers, and one sister, Jane Senior, who later became Britain&#x27;s first female civil servant. At the age of eight he was sent to Twyford School, a preparatory public school near Winchester, where he remained until the age of eleven. In February 1834 he went to Rugby School, which was then under the celebrated Thomas Arnold, a contemporary of his father at Oriel College, Oxford.

Hughes excelled at sports rather than in scholarship, and his school career culminated in a cricket match at Lord&#x27;s Cricket Ground. In 1842 he went on to Oriel College, and graduated BA in 1845. At Oxford, he played cricket for the university team in the annual University Match against Cambridge University, also at Lord&#x27;s, and a match still regarded as first-class cricket.

==Legal career==
Hughes was called to the bar in 1848, became Queen&#x27;s Counsel in 1869 and a bencher in 1870. He was appointed to a county court judgeship in the Chester district in July 1882.

==Social interests==
A committed social reformer, Hughes became involved in the Christian socialism movement led by Frederick Maurice, which he joined in 1848. In January 1854 he was one of the founders of the Working Men&#x27;s College in Great Ormond Street, and was the college&#x27;s principal from 1872 to 1883.

Hughes gave evidence in 1850 to a House of Commons committee on savings. In so doing he participated in a Christian Socialist initiative, which led shortly to the Industrial and Provident Societies Partnership Act 1852, and the emergence of the industrial and provident society. The Act was the work of Robert Aglionby Slaney, with whom Hughes worked in alliance.

Hughes was involved also in the formation of some early trade unions, and helped finance the printing of Liberal publications; and acted as the first President of the Co-operative Congress in 1869, serving on the Co-operative Central Board. He invested with William Romaine Callender in co-operative mills, in 1866.

==In politics==

Hughes was elected to Parliament as a Liberal for Lambeth (1865–68), and for Frome (1868–74). He stood as candidate in 1874 for Marylebone in 1874, but dropped out just before the election, despite support from Octavia Hill. The context for the end of his political career was the unpopularity with Hughes&#x27;s Frome constituents of his support for the Elementary Education Act 1870.

As an MP Hughes worked on trade union legislation, but was not in a position to have major changes passed. He had greater success in improving the legal position of co-operatives, which in particular became able to operate as a limited company. The issue of legal obstacles to the operation of labour unions was topical, and in 1867 Hughes was made a member of a Royal Commission set up to consider the matter. Initially he was the only one on the committee sympathetic to the union point of view; after some lobbying he was joined by Frederic Harrison, and a concession was made to union representatives, allowing them observer places in the proceedings. Hughes then worked with Harrison and Robert Applegarth to diminish the effect of some of the testimony from employers.

The outcome of this commission was that Harrison, Hughes and Lord Lichfield produced a minority report (1869), recommending that all the legal restrictions should be dropped. Then the matter was raised again in a second Commission, at the end of Hughes&#x27;s time in Parliament. At that point Alexander Macdonald used a minority report to refer back to Hughes&#x27;s earlier view; but Hughes signed the majority report. It advocated amendment of the Master and Servant Act 1867, but little substantive change to the Criminal Law Amendment Act 1871 and the law of conspiracy.

==Volunteers==
During the invasion scare of 1859, Hughes raised the 19th (Bloomsbury) Middlesex Rifle Volunteer Corps from among the students of the Working Men&#x27;s College, and commanded it with the rank of Lieutenant-Colonel until 1869, when he became the unit&#x27;s first Honorary Colonel. The battalion was known as &#x27;Tom Brown&#x27;s Corps&#x27;. Hughes estimated that it was the poorest in London, Rifle Volunteer Corps at the time being predominantly middle class. He also served as deputy editor of the &quot;Volunteer Services Gazette&quot;.

==Later life==
In 1878–9 Hughes began writing &quot;The Manual for Co-operators&quot; (1881), with Vansittart Neale, for the Co-operative Congress. As a side-product he developed an interest in the model village. In 1880, he acquired the ownership of Franklin W. Smith&#x27;s &quot;Plateau City&quot; and founded a settlement in America—Rugby, Tennessee—which was designed as an experiment in utopian living for the younger sons of the English gentry. It followed closely on the failed colony Buckthorn (existing about 1872 to 1879), established by another Englishman, Charles Lempriere, in western Virginia; this settlement had supposedly been suggested by Hughes. Rugby was also unsuccessful on its own terms, but it still exists and is listed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places.

Hughes was also a prominent figure in the anti-opium movement, and a member of the Society for the Suppression of the Opium Trade.

At the end of the 1880s Hughes clashed with John Thomas Whitehead Mitchell of the Co-operative Wholesale Society, over the vertical integration Mitchell favoured for the Society. Hughes died in 1896 aged 73, at Brighton, of heart failure, and was buried there.

==Works==
While living at Wimbledon, Hughes wrote his famous story &quot;Tom Brown&#x27;s School Days&quot;, which was published in April 1857. He is associated with the novelists of the &quot;muscular school&quot;, a loose classification but centred on the fiction of the Crimean War period. Although Hughes had never been a member of the sixth form at Rugby, his impressions of the headmaster Thomas Arnold were reverent.

Hughes also wrote &quot;The Scouring of the White Horse&quot; (1859), &quot;Tom Brown at Oxford&quot; (1861), &quot;Religio Laici&quot; (1868), &quot;Life of Alfred the Great&quot; (1869) and the &quot;Memoir of a Brother&quot;. His brother, George Hughes, was the model for the Tom Brown character.

==Family==
In 1847, Hughes married Frances Ford, daughter of Rev. James Ford, and niece of Richard Ford, and they settled in 1853 at Wimbledon. Their house there was built by the North London Working Builders&#x27; Association, a Christian Socialist co-operative; and was shared with J. M. F. Ludlow and his family; Ludlow already shared barristers&#x27; chambers with Hughes, and the arrangement lasted four years. There were five sons (Maurice, James, George, John, and Arthur) and four daughters (Lilian, Evie, Caroline and Mary) of the marriage.

Lilian Hughes perished in the sinking of the RMS &quot;Titanic&quot; in 1912. The youngest child Mary Hughes was a well known Poor Law guardian and volunteer visitor to the local Poor Law infirmary and children&#x27;s home.

==Legacy==

A Hughes Scholarship was founded at Oriel College, Oxford. It was a closed award, open only to members, or sons of members, of some Co-operative Societies, in which aspect the award reflected Hughes&#x27;s involvement with the Co-operative Movement. The first scholar was elected to Oriel in 1884. It was later combined with an award honouring the social reformer Edward Vansittart Neale.

A statue of Hughes (pictured right) stands outside Rugby School Library: the sculptor was Thomas Brock, and the statue was unveiled in 1899.

<doc id="367954" wikidata="Q1714329" url="?curid=367954" title="Justiciar">
<text>Justiciar is the English form of the medieval Latin term or (meaning &quot;judge&quot; or &quot;justice&quot;). The Chief Justiciar was the king&#x27;s chief minister, roughly equivalent to a modern Prime Minister of the United Kingdom.

The Justiciar of Ireland was an office established during the Anglo-Norman invasion of Ireland and was a key tool in its colonisation. Following the conquest of the Principality of Wales in the 13th century, the areas that became personal fiefs of the English monarchs were placed under the control of the Justiciar of North Wales and the Justiciar of South Wales.

A similar office was formed in Scotland, although there were usually two or three – the Justiciar of Scotia, the Justiciar of Lothian and, in the 13th century, the Justiciar of Galloway. These offices later evolved into a national one called Lord Justice-General. The modern title is Lord President of the Court of Session.

Similar positions existed in continental Europe, particularly in Norman Italy and in Sweden.

==England==
In Norman England, kings enlarged the scope of royal justice by delegating judicial authority to members of the (Latin for &quot;king&#x27;s court&quot;). These were called justiciars. Henry I () appointed local justiciars to supervise a county or group of counties. It was not until the reign of Henry II (1154–1189) that the title was exclusively applied to the king&#x27;s chief minister.

After the Norman Conquest of 1066, the King of England was also Duke of Normandy and divided his time between the two territories. In his absence, William the Conqueror () temporarily delegated viceroyal authority to trusted officers described variously as regent, custodian, and prefect. When William Rufus () became king, this temporary role developed into a more permanent and defined office. Rufus entrusted the control of government administration to his chaplain, Bishop Ranulf Flambard of Durham. Flambard ran the government at all times, even when Rufus lived in England. Historian Frank Barlow argues that Flambard was the first chief justiciar. While Flambard was probably the first to exercise the powers of a chief justiciar, he never held that rank officially. Nevertheless, he was described by contemporary chronicler Orderic Vitalis as a .

Sometime around 1107 or 1108, Henry I appointed his chancellor, Roger of Salisbury, as the first chief justiciar. Roger was described by chroniclers as (Latin for &quot;second from the king&quot;). Roger oversaw the administration of justice, ecclesiastical appointments, and royal finances. According to the chronicler Symeon of Durham, Roger made most decisions for the royal government. Historian Bryce Lyon writes that &quot;Roger was a sort of medieval prime minister but a minister immeasurably more powerful because his only responsibility was to his lord the king.&quot;

The chief justiciar was responsible for directing the royal household, the , and the government departments. Nevertheless, he was not a member of the household. He was the presiding officer of the exchequer and directed the procedures of the as the chief royal justice. He also supervised the itinerant justices.

The chief justiciar was invariably a great noble or churchman, and the office became very powerful and important; enough to be a threat to the king. The last great justiciar, Hubert de Burgh, 1st Earl of Kent, was removed from office in 1232, and the chancellor soon took the position formerly occupied by the chief justiciar as second to the king in dignity, as well as in power and influence. Under King Edward I, the office of justiciar was replaced by separate heads for the three branches into which the King&#x27;s Court was divided – justices of the Court of Common Pleas, justices of the Court of King&#x27;s Bench, and barons of the Court of Exchequer.

===List of chief justiciars of England===
==Scotland==

In Scotland, justiciars were the king&#x27;s lieutenants for judicial and administrative purposes. The office was established in the 12th century, either by Alexander I or by his successor, David I. The title of &#x27;Justiciar&#x27; was reserved for two or three high officials, the chief one—the Justiciar of Scotia—having his jurisdiction to the north of the River Forth. The Justiciar of Lothian dealt with the part of the kingdom south of the Forth-Clyde line. The role of justiciar evolved into the current Lord Justice-General, the head of the High Court of Justiciary, head of the judiciary in Scotland, and a member of the Royal Household. 
The Duke of Argyll still holds the hereditary title of High Justiciar of Argyll, but no responsibilities now attach to it.

==Wales==

Following Edward I of England&#x27;s conquest of the Principality of Wales (1277–1283), the Statute of Rhuddlan established the governance of the areas of Wales under direct royal control. The new counties of Anglesey, Caernarfonshire and Merioneth were administered on behalf of the king by the Justiciar of North Wales, while Carmarthenshire and Cardiganshire were placed under the control of the Justiciar of South Wales.

==Ireland==

The title &quot;justiciar&quot; or &quot;chief justiciar&quot; was commonly borne by the chief governor of Ireland in the centuries after the Norman invasion of Ireland. By the fifteenth century the chief governor was usually styled the King&#x27;s Lieutenant, with the justiciar a subordinate role that evolved into the Lords Justices of Ireland.

==Other jurisdictions==

The title Justiciar was given by Henry II of England to the Seneschal of Normandy.

In the 12th century, a &quot;magister justitiarius&quot; appeared in the Norman kingdom of Sicily, presiding over the Royal Court (&quot;Magna Curia&quot;), empowered, with his assistants, to decide, inter alia, all cases reserved to the Crown. There is no clear evidence that this title and office were borrowed from England; it was probably based on a Norman practice instituted in both realms. In the 13th century the office of justiciar was instituted in several principal localities around Sicily.

In medieval Sweden, the &quot;lagman&quot; (&quot;lawspeaker&quot;) was the judge, or person learned in law, for a province, an area with several local district courts. Since the position corresponds to the general meaning of &quot;justiciar&quot;, &quot;justiciar&quot; is often used to translate &quot;lagman&quot; in English texts. Lagmän (plural) were generally also members of the Senate of the realm, an institution corresponding to the English Privy Council. Finally, the Swedish term &quot;riksdrots&quot; is often translated as &quot;Lord High Justiciar of Sweden&quot;.

<text>Gilbert Maurice Norman (7 April 1915 – 6 September 1944) was a British Army officer who served in the Special Operations Executive in France during World War II.

Norman was born in Saint-Cloud, Hauts-de-Seine, to an English father and a French mother and was educated in France and England. He joined the army, receiving a commission in the Durham Light Infantry in November 1940 and was subsequently recruited into the Special Operations Executive (SOE). In November 1942, he was sent into France to join the newly formed Prosper network, but on 24 June 1943 was arrested by the Gestapo, together with cell leader Francis Suttill and courier Andrée Borrel.

Norman was taken to the Paris headquarters of the &quot;Sicherheitsdienst&quot; at 84 Avenue Foch. The Germans used Norman&#x27;s captured wireless set to transmit their own false messages to SOE Headquarters in Baker Street. Norman attempted to warn London that he was in captivity by not giving the Germans the second part of his security check, which they did not know about. Omitting the security check from a message was specifically designed to act as a duress code which would warn London that the sender was being coerced. However, Norman was frustrated when London sent a curt reply telling him to correct the omission.

The Germans were thus able to set a trap which resulted in the capture of Jack Agazarian who had been sent with Nicholas Bodington to investigate the fate of the Prosper network. Norman was shipped to Mauthausen concentration camp, where he was executed on 6 September 1944.

Major Gilbert Norman is honoured on the Brookwood Memorial in Surrey, England, and is also on the &quot;Roll of Honour&quot; on the Valençay SOE Memorial in the town of Valençay, in the Indre departément of France.

==Early life and education==
Glover was born on July 22, 1946, in San Francisco, California, the son of Carrie (née Hunley) and James Glover. Both of his parents were postal workers, and were active in the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), working to advance equal rights. Glover&#x27;s mother, daughter of a midwife, was born in Louisville, Georgia, and graduated from Paine College in Augusta, Georgia. His father was a World War II veteran. He graduated from George Washington High School in San Francisco.

As an adolescent and a young adult, Glover had epilepsy but has not had a seizure since age 35. He attended San Francisco State University (SFSU) in the late 1960s but did not graduate. SFSU later awarded him the Presidential Medal of San Francisco State University for his service to education. Glover trained at the Black Actors&#x27; Workshop of the American Conservatory Theater.

==Career==
=== 1979–1984: Early roles ===

Glover originally worked in city administration working on community development before transitioning to theater. He has said:

His first theater involvement was with the &quot;American Conservatory Theater&quot;, a regional training program in San Francisco. Glover also trained with Jean Shelton at the Shelton Actors Lab in San Francisco. In an interview on &quot;Inside the Actors Studio&quot;, Glover credited Jean Shelton for much of his development as an actor. Deciding that he wanted to be an actor, Glover resigned from his city administration job and soon began his career as a stage actor. Glover then moved to Los Angeles for more opportunities in acting.

Glover made his film acting debut in &quot;Escape from Alcatraz&quot; (1979). He has since had a variety of film, stage and television roles. His earlier work included a recurring role on &quot;Hill Street Blues&quot;, and the role of Moses Hadner in the 1984 drama film &quot;Places in the Heart&quot;.

=== 1985–2000: Breakthrough and acclaim ===
Glover gained acclaim in 1985 starring as the husband to Whoopi Goldberg&#x27;s character Celie in the celebrated literary adaptation &quot;The Color Purple&quot;. The same year he played Lieutenant James McFee in the crime thriller film &quot;Witness&quot;, and Mal in the western film &quot;Silverado&quot;.

Glover is best known for playing Los Angeles police Sergeant Roger Murtaugh in the action film &quot;Lethal Weapon&quot; (1987), and in the 1989, 1992 and 1998 sequels of the film series, starring alongside Mel Gibson. He received Primetime Emmy Award nominations for his roles as Nelson Mandela in the HBO television film &quot;Mandela&quot; (1987) and Joshua Deets in CBS western miniseries &quot;Lonesome Dove&quot; (1989). In 1990, he earned top billing for the first time in the blockbuster &quot;Predator 2&quot; with Gary Busey, the sequel to the science-fiction action film &quot;Predator&quot;. That same year, he starred in Charles Burnett&#x27;s &quot;To Sleep with Anger&quot;, for which he won the Independent Spirit Award for Best Male Lead. He also appeared in films such as &quot;Grand Canyon&quot; (1991) and &quot;Bopha!&quot; (1993).
During his career, Glover has also made several cameos, appearing, for example, in the Michael Jackson video &quot;Liberian Girl&quot; of 1987. In 1994, Glover and actor Ben Guillory founded the Robey Theatre Company in Los Angeles in honor of the actor and concert singer Paul Robeson. Its purpose was to focus on theatre by and about Black people.

Also in 1994, Glover made his directorial debut with the Showtime channel short film &quot;Override&quot;. That same year, he played the role of baseball manager George Knox in &quot;Angels in the Outfield&quot; for Walt Disney Pictures. Disney originally wanted Bob Hoskins for the role of George Knox, but he was considered too short for the role and Glover was cast because of his height and is the same size as the actors playing the California Angels.

In common with Humphrey Bogart, Elliott Gould and Robert Mitchum, who have played Raymond Chandler&#x27;s private eye detective Philip Marlowe, Glover played the role in the episode &quot;Red Wind&quot; of the Showtime network&#x27;s 1995 series &quot;Fallen Angels&quot;, earning him a Primetime Emmy Award nomination. Also that year, Glover played Captain Sam Cahill in the war film &quot;Operation Dumbo Drop&quot;.

In 1997, under his former production company banner Carrie Films, Glover executive produced numerous films of first time directors including Pamm Malveaux&#x27;s &quot;neo-noir&quot; short film &quot;Final Act starring Joe Morton&quot;, which aired on the Independent Film Channel. In 1998, he starred as Paul D. in the drama film &quot;Beloved&quot;, based on Toni Morrison&#x27;s novel. In addition, Glover has been a voice actor in many children&#x27;s movies including &quot;The Prince of Egypt&quot; (1998), &quot;Antz&quot; (1998) and &quot;Our Friend, Martin&quot; (1999). In 2000, he played Will Walker in TNT biographical film &quot;Freedom Song&quot;, which earned him another Primetime Emmy Award nomination.

=== 2001–present: Established actor ===
Glover was featured in the Wes Anderson directed 2001 film &quot;The Royal Tenenbaums&quot;, also starring Gwyneth Paltrow, Anjelica Huston, Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson.

In 2004, he appeared in the low-budget horror film &quot;Saw&quot; as Detective David Tapp. In 2005, Glover and Joslyn Barnes announced plans to make &quot;No FEAR&quot;, a film about Dr. Marsha Coleman-Adebayo&#x27;s experience. Coleman-Adebayo won a 2000 jury trial against the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The jury found the EPA guilty of violating the civil rights of Coleman-Adebayo on the basis of race, sex, color and a hostile work environment, under the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Coleman-Adebayo was terminated shortly after she revealed the environmental and human disaster taking place in the Brits, South Africa vanadium mines. Her experience inspired the passage of the Notification and Federal Employee Anti-discrimination and Retaliation Act of 2002 (No-FEAR Act). the &quot;No Fear&quot; title has not appeared but &quot;The Marsha Coleman-Adebayo Story&quot; was announced as the next major project of No Fear Media Productions.

Glover portrayed David Keaton in the television film &quot;The Exonerated&quot; (2005)—a real-life story of Keaton&#x27;s experience of being arrested, jailed, and then freed from death row. In 2006, he voiced Miles, an elderly mule, in the animated film &quot;Barnyard&quot;, and played Marty Madison in the musical &quot;Dreamgirls&quot;. In 2007, he played Colonel Isaac Johnson in the action thriller &quot;Shooter&quot;.

In 2009, Glover performed in &quot;The People Speak&quot;, a documentary feature film that uses dramatic and musical performances of the letters, diaries and speeches of everyday Americans, based on historian Howard Zinn&#x27;s &quot;A People&#x27;s History of the United States&quot;. He also had recurring roles on the shows &quot;ER&quot; and &quot;Brothers &amp; Sisters&quot;.

Glover played President Wilson, the President of the United States in &quot;2012&quot;, a disaster film directed by Roland Emmerich and released in theaters November 13, 2009. In 2010, Glover participated in the black comedy film &quot;Death at a Funeral&quot;, and a Spanish film called &quot;I Want to Be a Soldier&quot;. In 2012, he starred in the film &quot;Donovan&#x27;s Echo&quot;.

Glover co-starred in the science fiction comedy film &quot;Sorry to Bother You&quot;, which was released in theaters on July 6, 2018. He also appeared in the film &quot;The Last Black Man in San Francisco&quot; (2019). In December 2019, he played Milo Walker in the action comedy film &quot;&quot; starring Dwayne Johnson, Kevin Hart, Jack Black and Karen Gillan.

== Unrealized projects ==

Glover sought to make a film biography of Toussaint Louverture for his directorial debut. In May 2006, the film had included cast members Wesley Snipes, Angela Bassett, Don Cheadle, Jonathan Rhys Meyers, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Roger Guenveur Smith, Mos Def, Isaach de Bankolé and Richard Bohringer. Production, estimated to cost $30 million, was planned to begin in Poland, filming from late 2006 into early 2007. In May 2007, President of Venezuela Hugo Chávez contributed $18 million to fund the production of &quot;Toussaint&quot; for Glover, who was a prominent U.S. supporter of Chávez. The contribution annoyed some Venezuelan filmmakers, who said the money could have funded other homegrown films and that Glover&#x27;s film was not even about Venezuela.

In April 2008, the Venezuelan National Assembly authorized an additional $9,840,505 for Glover&#x27;s film. In 2015, Glover gave an update on the Toussaint project, stating, &quot;The film that we always missed is a movie on the Haitian revolution and Toussaint Louverture. The company is fortuitously named after him and that was the movie that I wanted to do. We&#x27;ve developed a script. We thought we were going to get it done four years ago. We thought we were going to be making it right now. But also there are other kinds of things that intrigue me.&quot;

== Public appearances ==
Glover appeared at London Film and Comic Con 2013 at Earls Court 2 over 2.5 days during Friday 5th to Sunday, July 7. He participated in a panel discussion in McComb, Mississippi on July 16, 2015. The event, co-sponsored by The Gloster Project and Jubilee Performing Arts Center, included noted authors Terry McMillan and Quincy Troupe.

On January 30, 2015, Glover was the Keynote Speaker and 2015 Honoree for the MLK Celebration Series at the Rhode Island School of Design (Providence, RI). Glover used his career and personal story to speak on the topic &quot;Creativity and Democracy: Social Change through the Arts&quot;. At the University of the Virgin Islands, Glover gave a speech that encouraged the graduates in their upcoming journey.

It was announced in July 2018 that Glover will be the featured guest at the Port Townsend Film Festival in Washington State.

Mr Glover attended the Seattle Storm versus Los Angeles Sparks on September 15, 2024. He was announced over the public address system and received a standing ovation. 

==Personal life==
Glover married Asake Bomani in 1975 and they have a daughter, Mandisa, born in 1976. Glover and Bomani divorced in 2000. Glover married Eliane Cavalleiro in 2009. They divorced in 2022.

Glover purchased a house in Dunthorpe, Oregon, in 1999. As of 2011, he no longer lives in Oregon.

==Activism==

===Civil rights activism===

While attending San Francisco State University (SFSU), Glover was a member of the Black Students&#x27; Union, which, along with the Third World Liberation Front and the American Federation of Teachers, collaborated in a five-month student-led strike to establish a Department of Black Studies. The strike was the longest student walkout in U.S. history. It helped create not only the first Department of Black Studies but also the first School of Ethnic Studies in the United States.

Hari Dillon, current president of the Vanguard Public Foundation, was a fellow striker at SFSU. Glover later co-chaired Vanguard&#x27;s board. He is also a board member of the Algebra Project, the Black AIDS Institute, Walden House and Cheryl Byron&#x27;s &quot;Something Positive Dance Group&quot;. He was charged with disorderly conduct and unlawful assembly after being arrested outside the Sudanese Embassy in Washington during a protest over Sudan&#x27;s humanitarian crisis in Darfur.

In 1999, he used his leverage as a former San Francisco cab driver to raise awareness about African Americans being passed over for white passengers. In response, Rudolph Giuliani launched Operation Refusal, which suspended the licenses of cab drivers who favored white passengers over black ones.

Glover&#x27;s long history of union activism includes support for the United Farm Workers, UNITE HERE, and numerous service unions. In March 2010, Glover supported 375 union workers in Ohio by calling upon all actors at the 2010 Academy Awards to boycott Hugo Boss suits following announcement of Hugo Boss&#x27;s decision to close a manufacturing plant in Ohio after a proposed pay decrease from $13 to $8.30 an hour was rejected by the Workers United Union.

On November 1, 2011, Glover spoke to the crowd at Occupy Oakland on the day before the Oakland General Strike where thousands of protestors shut down the Port of Oakland.

===Political activism===
Glover was an early supporter of former North Carolina Senator John Edwards in the 2008 Democratic presidential primaries until Edwards&#x27; withdrawal, although some news reports indicated that he had endorsed Ohio Congressman Dennis Kucinich, whom he had endorsed in 2004. After Edwards dropped out, Glover then endorsed Barack Obama. In February 2016, Glover endorsed Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders for the Democratic presidential nomination. In February 2019, Glover again endorsed Sanders for US president in 2020.

In 2017, he co-authored a petition along with Noam Chomsky, Mark Ruffalo, Nancy Fraser, Oliver Stone and Eve Ensler, urging French citizens to vote for candidate Jean-Luc Mélenchon in the 2017 presidential election.

Glover was an outspoken critic of George W. Bush, calling him a known racist. &quot;Yes, he&#x27;s racist. We all knew that. As Texas&#x27;s governor, Bush led a penitentiary system that executed more people than all the other U.S. states together. And most of the people who died were Afro-Americans or Hispanics.&quot;

Glover&#x27;s support of California Proposition 7 (2008) led him to use his voice in an automated phone call to generate support for the measure before the election.

On April 16, 2010, Glover was arrested in Maryland during a protest by SEIU workers for Sodexo&#x27;s alleged unfair and illegal treatment of workers. He was given a citation and later released. The Associated Press reports &quot;Glover and others stepped past yellow police tape and were asked to step back three times at Sodexo headquarters. When they refused, officers arrested them.&quot;

On the foreign policy of the Obama administration, Glover said: &quot;I think the Obama administration has followed the same playbook, to a large extent, almost verbatim, as the Bush administration. I don&#x27;t see anything different... On the domestic side, look here: What&#x27;s so clear is that this country from the outset is protecting the interests of wealth and property. Look at the bailout of Wall Street. Why not the bailout of Main Street? He may be just a different face, and that face may happen to be black, and if it were Hillary Clinton, it would happen to be a woman... But what choices do they have within the structure?&quot;

Glover wrote the foreword to Phyllis Bennis&#x27; book, &quot;Challenging Empire: How People, Governments, and the UN Defy US Power.&quot; Glover is also a member of the board of directors of the Center for Economic and Policy Research, a think tank led by economist Dean Baker.

===International===
====Africa====
Glover is an active board member of the TransAfrica Forum. On April 6, 2009, Glover was given a chieftaincy title in Imo State, Nigeria. His title, &quot;Enyioma of Nkwerre&quot;, means &quot;A Good Friend&quot; in the language of the Igbo people of Eastern Nigeria.

====Brazil====
In 2018, Glover, as the UN Goodwill Ambassador, met with Lula to express solidarity and support for his presidential candidacy. During a trip to Brazil, he also met with the family of Marielle Franco, the City Council member and LGBT activist murdered in Rio de Janeiro.

====Caribbean and Haiti====
On January 13, 2010, Glover compared the scale and devastation of the 2010 Haiti earthquake to the predicament other island nations may face as a result of the failed Copenhagen summit the previous year. Glover said: &quot;the threat of what happens to Haiti is a threat that can happen anywhere in the Caribbean to these island nations ... they&#x27;re all in peril because of global warming ... because of climate change ... when we did what we did at the climate summit in Copenhagen, this is the response, this is what happens&quot;. In the same statement, he called for a new form of international partnership with Haiti and other Caribbean nations and praised Venezuela, Brazil and Cuba, for already accepting this partnership.

====Iraq War====
Danny Glover had been an outspoken critic of the Iraq War before it began in March 2003. In February 2003, he was one of the featured speakers at Justin Herman Plaza in San Francisco where other notable speakers included names such as author Alice Walker, singer Joan Baez, United Farm Workers co-founder Dolores Huerta and Rep. Barbara Lee, D-Oakland.
Glover was a signatory to the April 2003 anti-war letter &quot;To the Conscience of the World&quot; that criticized the unilateral American invasion of Iraq that led to &quot;massive loss of civilian life&quot; and &quot;devastation of one of the cultural patrimonies of humanity&quot;.

During an anti-war demonstration in Downtown Oakland in March 2003, Glover praised the community leaders for their anti-war efforts saying that &quot;They&#x27;re on the front lines because they are trying to make a better America. ... The world has come together and said &#x27;no&#x27; to this war—and we must stand with them.&quot;

====Venezuela====
In January 2006, Harry Belafonte led a delegation of activists, including Glover, activist/professor Cornel West, and activist/Santa Cruz Barrios Unidos Founder and Executive Director Daniel NANE Alejandrez in a meeting with President of Venezuela Hugo Chávez. In 2006, Glover had begun working on a film about Toussaint Louverture, who led the 18th century revolt in Haiti and, it was reported, that Chavez supported the film, &quot;hoping the historical epic will sprinkle Hollywood stardust on his effort to mobilise world public opinion against imperialism and western oppression.&quot; In 2007, Glover agreed with Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez that the Touissant Louverture film would be financed by Venezuela. On May 19, 2007, the National Assembly of Venezuela approved giving Glover $18 million for the film. The following year, on April 9, 2008, the National Assembly of Venezuela, at the request of the Chávez, approved another $9 million to be handed to Glover in order to &quot;continue&quot; the filming of the film about Touissant. Surprisingly, in an interview dated January 5, 2015, published in &quot;Filmmaker&quot; magazine, Glover says, &quot;The film that we always missed is a movie on the Haitian revolution and Toussaint Louverture. The company is fortuitously named after him and that was the movie that I wanted to do. We&#x27;ve developed a script. We thought we were going to get it done four years ago. We thought we were going to be making it right now. But also there are other kinds of things that intrigue me&quot;. , the film had not been made.

Glover was also a board member of TeleSUR, a media network primarily funded by the Venezuelan government. During the beginning of the 2014 Venezuelan protests, Glover extended his support to Chávez&#x27;s successor, President Nicolás Maduro, calling members of his government &quot;the stewards&quot; of Venezuela&#x27;s democracy. Glover also told Venezuelan government supporters to go fight for the sovereignty of Maduro&#x27;s government. Through the crisis in Bolivarian Venezuela, Glover continued to show his support for the Bolivarian government and President Maduro&#x27;s administration.

====Israel====
On September 2, 2009, Glover signed an open letter of objection to the inclusion of a series of films intended to showcase Tel Aviv—without the participation of Palestinian filmmakers, at the Toronto International Film Festival.

===Music===
Glover has become an active member of board of directors of The Jazz Foundation of America. He became involved with The Jazz Foundation in 2005, and has been a featured host for their annual benefit &quot;A Great Night in Harlem&quot; for several years, as well appearing as a celebrity MC at other events for the foundation. In 2006, Britain&#x27;s leading African theatre company Tiata Fahodzi appointed Glover as one of its three Patrons, joining Chiwetel Ejiofor and Jocelyn Jee Esien opening the organization&#x27;s tenth-anniversary celebrations (February 2, 2008) at the Theatre Royal Stratford East, London.

In 2023, he was inducted into the Black Music &amp; Entertainment Walk of Fame in Atlanta, Georgia. &quot;IndieWire&quot; named him one of the best actors never to have received an Academy Award nomination.

<doc id="367969" wikidata="Q392226" url="?curid=367969" title="Acts of Supremacy">
<text>The Acts of Supremacy are two acts passed by the Parliament of England in the 16th century that established the English monarchs as the head of the Church of England; two similar laws were passed by the Parliament of Ireland establishing the English monarchs as the head of the Church of Ireland. The 1534 Act declared King Henry VIII and his successors as the Supreme Head of the Church, replacing the Pope. This first Act was repealed during the reign of the Catholic Queen Mary I. The 1558 Act declared Queen Elizabeth I and her successors the Supreme Governor of the Church, a title that the British monarch still holds.

Royal supremacy is specifically used to describe the legal sovereignty of the king (i.e., civil law) over the law of the Church in England.

== First Act of Supremacy 1534 ==
The first Act of Supremacy, passed on 3 November 1534 (26 Hen. 8. c. 1) by the Parliament of England was one of the first major events in the English Reformation. It granted King Henry VIII of England and subsequent monarchs royal supremacy and stated that the reigning monarch was the supreme head of the Church of England.

The Act declared that the king was &quot;the only supreme head on Earth of the Church of England&quot; and that the Crown shall enjoy &quot;all honours, dignities, preeminences, jurisdictions, privileges, authorities, immunities, profits, and commodities to the said dignity.&quot; The wording of the act made clear that Parliament was not granting the king the title (thereby suggesting that they had the right to withdraw it later); rather, it was acknowledging an established fact. In the Act of Supremacy, Henry VIII withdrew support for the authority of the pope and the Roman Catholic Church and asserted the independence of the &quot;Ecclesia Anglicana&quot;. He appointed himself and his successors as the supreme rulers of the English church. Earlier, Henry VIII had been declared &quot;Defender of the Faith&quot; () in 1521 by Pope Leo X for his pamphlet accusing Martin Luther of heresy. Parliament later conferred this title upon the king in 1544.

Henry VIII was motivated to issue the Act for multiple reasons. He desperately wanted a male heir to continue his line, and after wars and succession crises, aimed to ensure that his dynastic lineage would continue without challenge. When Catherine of Aragon did not bear a son, the king tried for years to annul his marriage to her, having convinced himself that God was punishing him for marrying his brother&#x27;s widow. 

Despite his close alignment with the Catholic Church and other papal annulments, Pope Clement VII refused to grant Henry VIII an annulment. Roman Catholic doctrine viewed a marriage contract as indissoluble until death, and the papacy argued that a marriage could not simply be annulled because of a canonical impediment previously dispensed. Additionally, the emperor of the Hapsburg empire at this time, Charles V, was the nephew of Catherine of Aragon, and for the Pope to declare that marriage invalid would be to separate the Church from the good favour of the emperor. 

Henry VIII subsequently passed the Treasons Act, which stated that to disavow the Act of Supremacy and to deprive the king of his &quot;dignity, title, or name&quot; was to be considered treason. Thus, the king&#x27;s control over the English religion was absolute and those who held to Catholic beliefs were swiftly punished. The most famous public figure to resist the Treasons Act was Sir Thomas More, who was convicted of treason and executed by beheading. 

=== Irish Act of Supremacy 1537 ===
In 1537, the (28 Hen. 8. c. 5 (I), &quot;An Act authorising the King, His Heirs and Successors, to be supreme Head of the Church of Ireland&quot;) was passed by the Parliament of Ireland, establishing Henry VIII as the supreme head of the Church of Ireland, as had earlier been done in England.

== Second Act of Supremacy 1558 ==

Henry VIII&#x27;s Act of Supremacy was repealed in 1554 during the reign of his staunchly Roman Catholic daughter, Queen Mary I. Upon her death in November 1558, her Protestant half-sister Elizabeth I succeeded to the throne. The first Elizabethan Parliament passed the Act of Supremacy 1558 that declared Elizabeth the Supreme Governor of the Church of England and instituted an Oath of Supremacy requiring anyone taking public or church office to swear allegiance to the monarch as head of the Church and state. Anyone refusing to take the oath could be charged with treason.

The use of the term &quot;Supreme Governor&quot; as opposed to &quot;Supreme Head&quot; pacified some Catholics and those Protestants concerned about a female leader of the Church of England. Elizabeth, who was a &quot;politique&quot;, did not prosecute nonconformist laymen, or those who did not follow the established rules of the Church of England unless their actions directly undermined the authority of the English monarch, as was the case in the vestments controversy. Thus, it was through the Second Act of Supremacy that Elizabeth I officially established the now reformed Church of England. This was a part of the Elizabethan Religious Settlement.

Historian G. R. Elton has argued that, &quot;in law and political theory the Elizabethan supremacy was essentially parliamentary, while Henry VIII&#x27;s had been essentially personal.&quot; The royal supremacy was extinguished during the British Interregnum from 1649, but was restored in 1660. The Stuart kings used it as a justification for controlling the appointment of bishops.

The conflation in the Crown of supreme lay authority over church and state made every secular subject of the Crown a spiritual subject of the Church as well; the Church was co-extensive with the State. Contemporary English theologian Richard Hooker described the situation thus:

<doc id="367976" wikidata="Q3026161" url="?curid=367976" title="Diana Rowden">
<text>Diana Hope Rowden (31 January 1915 – 6 July 1944) served in the Women&#x27;s Auxiliary Air Force and was an agent for the United Kingdom&#x27;s clandestine Special Operations Executive (SOE) during World War II. Rowden was a member of SOE&#x27;s Acrobat circuit in occupied France where she operated as a courier until she was arrested by the Gestapo. She was subsequently executed at the Natzweiler-Struthof concentration camp.

==Early life==

Born in England, Rowden was the daughter of Major Aldred Clement Rowden (British Army) and his wife, Muriel Christian Maitland-Makgill-Crichton, whom he married on 16 July 1913 at St Mark&#x27;s, North Audley Street in London&#x27;s fashionable Mayfair district. The marriage was not successful and her parents separated when she was still a young child, whereupon she moved with her mother and two younger brothers, Maurice Edward Alfred and Cecil William Aldred, to southern France as a small income went farther there than in England. She and her brothers spent much of their time there on the beach, fishing and boating, swimming and gliding.

Rowden&#x27;s cousin, Mark Chetwynd-Stapylton, remembers playing games of hide and seek with the Rowden children when they came to visit and bicycle rides on Berkhamsted Common. Sixty years later he was left with a faint impression of Rowden as &quot;a bit of a tomboy&quot;, reddish-haired, freckled, with slightly protruding teeth.

Her mother was apparently an eccentric who was remembered by her nephew (Mark) as &quot;amusing even if possessing a somewhat caustic – and biting – wit and not much worried about what she said and to whom&quot;. When living in France Mrs Rowden was known to locals, according to her sister, as &quot;the mad Englishwoman&quot;.

Rowden attended schools in Sanremo and Cannes on the French Riviera, but her family soon returned to England, settling at Hadlow Down, near Mayfield, East Sussex, where she continued her education at Manor House School in Limpsfield, Surrey, as Mrs Rowden was, according to her nephew, mindful enough of her parental responsibilities to finish off the haphazard schooling Rowden had in France with a proper English education.

The Manor House was set beneath a low line of hills. A girl who shared a room with Rowden (Elizabeth Nicholas), remembered the place later in terms of &quot;the smell of ink and chalk dust, the lazy drones of bees around the flower beds, goal posts pointing bleak and white towards a winter sky.&quot; Elizabeth, who would later write a book about Rowden (&quot;Death Be Not Proud&quot;), remembered how bitterly Rowden resented the restrictions of life at school. &quot;She was of it, but never part of it. She was&quot;, she thought later, &quot;too mature for us. We were still schoolgirls in grubby white blouses concerned with games and feuds and ha-ha jokes. She was already adult, and withdrawn from our diversions; none of us, I think, ever knew her.&quot;

Elizabeth was amazed to learn years later from Mrs Rowden about Diana&#x27;s early years &quot;as a sea urchin&quot;, napping on the deck of the &quot;Sans Peur&quot; with a line tied around her big toe to wake her if a fish bit, gutting her catch &quot;with a cheerful confidence, marketing, carousing, sailing a small boat with reckless skill. &quot;It seemed to Elizabeth that the change in Rowden&#x27;s personality from spontaneity to reserve was explained by the change of scene to a manor in Surrey where she longed for the life she had led in France, &quot;for the yacht and the sea and the warm sun of the Mediterranean and her raffish, careless, unpredictable companions.&quot;

In 1933, when Rowden was considered sufficiently educated, if not entirely finished, she returned to France with her mother (leaving the two boys at school in England) and enrolled at the Sorbonne, and tried her hand at freelance journalism.

==Red Cross to WAAF (1940-43)==

When Germany invaded France in 1940 she volunteered to serve with the French Red Cross, being assigned to the Anglo-American Ambulance Unit. The Allied collapse in May 1940 prevented her evacuation from France and she remained there until the summer of 1941 when she escaped to England via Spain and Portugal.

In September 1941, she joined the Women&#x27;s Auxiliary Air Force (WAAF), working at the Department of the Chief of Air Staff as Assistant Section Officer for Intelligence duties, before being posted in July 1942 to Moreton-in-Marsh, where she was promoted to Section Officer.

During a brief hospitalisation in the West Country to recuperate from a minor operation, Rowden met a convalescing pilot (Squadron Leader William Simpson) who had been working for the French Section of SOE. She first came to the attention of the Special Operations Executive when Harry Sporborg, a senior SOE staff member, saw her file and requested that she be appointed his secretary, but she had already joined the WAAF and began military training. Simpson worked part-time for SOE and with whom she discussed her desire to return to France and take part in resistance work and caused him to tell some of his colleagues in Baker St (SOE occupied much of the western side of Baker Street, hence the nickname &quot;the Baker Street Irregulars&quot;).

==Special Operations Executive (1943-44)==
In early March 1943, she received an invitation to a preliminary interview with an officer of SOE F Section, during which the interviewer was favourably impressed. It was duly noted that she was &quot;very anxious to return to France and work against the Germans&quot;, and after she had been seen by other members of F Section staff, it was decided that she would be given the chance she had been looking for. She was officially posted to Air Intelligence 10, actually seconded to SOE, on 18 March 1943, and immediately sent off to training.

Her training report described her as &quot;not very agile&quot;, but with &quot;plenty of courage&quot;, and &quot;physically quite fit&quot;. One of her best subjects was fieldcraft, in which she &quot;did some excellent stalks&quot;. She was &quot;a very good shot, not at all gun-shy. Grenade throwing, very good&quot;. Her instructor found her &quot;very conscientious&quot; and &quot;a pleasant student to instruct&quot;. Her commandant&#x27;s report described her as a &quot;strange mixture. Very intelligent in many ways but very slow in learning any new subject&quot;. She had trouble with technical details and her signalling was described as a grief to herself and others, not worth while persevering with as it only discourages her. She hates being beaten by any subject, so must have got through a lot of hate down here.&quot; He concluded, &quot;I think she has enjoyed the course and could be useful.&quot;
On 9 June 1943, Rowden received orders for her first mission, and a week later, on the night of 16/17 June, she stepped out of a Lysander on a moonlit meadow in the Loire Valley a few miles north-east of Angers. Within minutes two other agents, Cecily Lefort and Noor Inayat Khan, had landed. The three women, who had been sent to operate as couriers for the organizers of various circuits (also known as networks) in different parts of France, were met by a reception committee organized by F Sections&#x27; air movements officer, Henri Déricourt, and quickly spirited to their destinations. Rowden was bound to the area of the Jura Mountains south-east of Dijon and just west of the Swiss border to work for the organizer of the Acrobat circuit, led by John Renshaw Starr. Her papers were in her cover name of Juliette Thérèse Rondeau. Her name in the field among fellow agents was Paulette while her code name in messages to London was Chaplain. She lived in a small room at the back of the Hôtel du Commerce with access to a roof if she had to leave in a hurry without being seen.

Her primary was acting as a courier delivering messages to other agents and members of the underground, and she would travel constantly, mostly by bicycle over the neighbouring roads bordering the Pines, but would also deliver instructions to agents as far afield as Marseille, Lyon, Besançon, Montbéliard, and even Paris, and bring their messages back to the W/T operator (John Young) for transmission. Young was a Scotsman who spoke poor French, so Rowden&#x27;s duties included escorting him around so he would not have to speak French. On one of her trips to Marseille the German police boarded the train and began inspect papers, so she locked herself in the W/C until they had passed through her car. Rowden got to know the local maquis who described her as without fear – &quot;sans peur&quot;.

She went out at night to meet local members of the resistance in the moonlit fields, setting flares and shining flashlights to guide in the planes with parachute drops of arms, ammunition and explosives. Some of these explosives were used to sabotage the Peugeot factory at Sochaux, near the town of Montbéliard, which had been turning out tank turrets for the Wehrmacht and engine parts for the Luftwaffe. A raid by Allied bombers had failed to damage the factory and caused hundreds of civilian deaths in the town, so Harry Rée (an SOE agent known as César) approached the local director of the factory (a Peugeot family member) and convinced him to facilitate sabotage at the factory as the alternative was another bombing raid that could cause many more deaths.

Barely a month after her arrival, Starr was arrested, betrayed by a double agent who had infiltrated the circuit, so Young and Rowden were on the run. Rowden briefly sheltered in a little bistro and shop at Epy. After three weeks at Epy she joined Young in what would be their last hideout thanks to the help of the Janier-Dubry family, which consisted of an elderly widow and her son and daughter-in-law of the family name, and her two daughters and their husbands, the Juifs and the Paulis. Together they owned a local sawmill outside Clairvaux-les-Lacs, a village about 15 kilometres from the town of Lons-le-Saunier. In August Rowden and Young were established in the house of the Juifs.

Since her description had likely been distributed, Rowden dyed her hair and changed the way she wore it, got rid of the clothes she had been wearing and borrowed some others. She also dropped the codename Paulette and assumed the name Marcelle. She helped around the house while the Juif children loved her as she joined in their games and went tobogganing with them down the log slide outside the house, and to Madame Juif she seemed as tough as a man and as tireless as a child.

==Arrest and execution==
===Feldgendarmerie raid===

In November, Young received a message that a new agent named Benoit would arrive. Benoit arrived at a nearby house and identified himself, after which M. Janier-Dubry drove him to Lons-le-Saunier to retrieve a suitcase and were accompanied by Rowden. In Lons they met Henri Clerk a &quot;résistant&quot; from St Amour, and had a drink with him at the Café Strasbourg, one of the circuit&#x27;s mail drops. They returned around six that evening and were chatting with Madame Juif, who was cooking dinner, when the door burst open and the room was filled with Feldgendarmerie, the German military police, armed with machine guns.

Rowden, Young and Benoit were handcuffed and taken to Lons, though the false Benoit as he later came to be known returned with some of the Germans and confronted the family at gunpoint and demanded that they hand over the wireless set and crystals, at one point firing into the walls as the Germans searched the home but found nothing. The wireless set had been hidden by Young and later taken away by a local &quot;résistant&quot;, while Madame Juif had taken a radio crystal from Young&#x27;s raincoat hanging behind the door and slipped it under the mattress of the baby&#x27;s crib when no-one was looking. Benoit and the Germans left after looting the home of valuables and took Madame Pauly with them, who returned after the war after having been imprisoned in Ravensbrück.

When the war ended the Janier-Dubry family expected to see Rowden again or at least to write, but they never heard from her again. Rowden liked to say that after the war she would return in her uniform and in a big American car and, instead of the laborious climb to the château on foot, they would shoot up the hill like a rocket.

From Lons, Rowden had been taken to Paris the next day and remained at Gestapo headquarters in the Avenue Foch for two weeks and, on 5 December 1943, was placed in a cell in the women&#x27;s division of Fresnes Prison, the grey fortress-like penitentiary a few miles south of Paris.

===Moved to Germany===
On 13 May 1944, Rowden, together with three other captured female SOE agents, Andrée Borrel, Vera Leigh and Sonia Olschanezky, were moved from Fresnes to the Avenue Foch along with four other women whose names were Yolande Beekman, Madeleine Damerment, Eliane Plewman and Odette Sansom, all of whom were F Section agents. Later that day they were taken to the railway station, and each handcuffed to a guard upon alighting the train. Sansom, in an interview after the war, said:

We were starting on this journey together in fear, but all of us hoping for something above all that we would remain together. We had all had a taste already of what things could be like, none of us did expect for anything very much, we all knew that they could put us to death. I was the only one officially condemned to death. The others were not. But there is always a fugitive ray of hope that some miracle will take place.

When the women arrived in Germany, they were put into separate cells in the prison in Karlsruhe (Justizvollzugsanstalt Karlsruhe) – Sansom with a woman who had been in prison for three years because her own daughter (a member of the Hitlerjugend) had denounced her for listening to the BBC, and Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses. The agents were treated no differently from other prisoners – markedly better than those in concentration camps – and were given manual work to do, peeling potatoes, sewing, etc., which helped pass the time. Occasionally, through the high bars, they could hear Allied bombers headed for targets within Germany, so on the whole things looked good for them even if there was the possibility of dying in an air raid. The war was unmistakably coming closer to an end and they could reasonably expect to be liberated by the Allies before too long.

===Execution at Natzweiler-Struthof===

Some time between five and six in the morning on 6 July 1944, not quite two months after their arrival in Karlsruhe, Borrel, Leigh, Olschanezky and Rowden were taken to the reception room, given their personal possessions, and handed over to two Gestapo men who then escorted them 100 kilometres south-west by closed truck to the Natzweiler-Struthof concentration camp in France, where they arrived around three-thirty in the afternoon. The women&#x27;s arrival was apparently unexpected as was the order by one of the women&#x27;s escorts that the four women were to be executed immediately.

As women were a rarity in the camp their presence immediately attracted attention from both German guards and prisoners. The four women were led through the center of the camp down to the cellblock at the bottom of the camp by SS men and held there until later that night. &quot;One could see from their appearance that they hadn&#x27;t come from a camp,&quot; said a French prisoner. &quot;They seemed young, they were fairly well groomed, their clothes were not rubbish, their hair was brushed, and each had a case in their (&quot;sic&quot;) hand.&quot; 

The four women were initially together but later put into individual cells. Through the windows, which faced those of the infirmary, they managed to communicate with several prisoners, including a Belgian prisoner, Dr Georges Boogaerts, who passed one of the women (whom he later identified as Borrel from a photograph) cigarettes through the window. Borrel threw him a little tobacco pouch containing some money.

Albert Guérisse, a Belgian army physician who had headed the Pat O&#x27;Leary escape line in Marseille, recognized Borrel as one of his former helpers. He exchanged a few words with another of the women, who said she was English (Leigh or Rowden) before she disappeared into the cellblock building. At the post-war trial of the men charged with the execution of the four women, Guérisse stated that he was in the infirmary and had seen the women, one by one, being escorted by SS guards from the cellblock (Zellenbau) to the crematorium a few yards away. He told the court: &quot;I saw the four women going to the crematorium, one after the other. One went, and two or three minutes later another went.&quot;

Inside the building housing the crematorium, each woman in turn was told to undress for a medical check and a doctor gave her an injection for what he told one of them was a vaccination against typhus, but was in fact a 10 cc dose of phenol which the doctor believed was lethal. When the woman became unconscious after the injection, she was inserted into the crematorium oven. Guérrise said, &quot;The next morning the German prisoner in charge of the crematorium explained to me that each time the door of the oven was opened, the flames came out of the chimney and that meant a body had been put in the oven. I saw the flames four times.&quot; The door was locked from the outside during the executions, but it was possible to see the corridor from a small window above the door, so the prisoner in the highest bunk was able to keep up a running commentary on what he saw.

The prisoner Guérisse referred to was Franz Berg, who assisted in the crematorium and had stoked the fire that night before being sent back to the room he shared with two other prisoners before the executions. Berg said:

More than one witness talked of a struggle when the fourth woman was shoved into the furnace. According to a Polish prisoner named Walter Schultz, the SS medical orderly (Emil Brüttel) told him the following: &quot;When the last woman was halfway in the oven (she had been put in feet first), she had come to her senses and struggled. As there were sufficient men there, they were able to push her into the oven, but not before she had resisted and scratched [Peter] Straub&#x27;s face.&quot; The next day Schultz noticed that the face of the camp executioner (Straub) had been severely scratched.

The camp doctor (Werner Rohde) was executed after the war. Franz Berg was sentenced to five years in prison and Straub to 13 but both received the death penalty in another trial for a different crime and were hanged on the same day as Rohde. The camp commandant (Fritz Hartjenstein) received a life sentence; he was later sentenced to death in France and died awaiting execution.

==Awards and honours==

Posthumously, Rowden was appointed a MBE (later withdrawn due to the policy on posthumous awards of this order) and Mentioned in Despatches by the British government, and awarded the Croix de Guerre 1939-1945 by the French government.

Her name is registered with the Scottish National War Memorial in Edinburgh Castle, at the Runnymede Memorial in Surrey, England, on the FANY memorial at St Paul’s Knightsbridge, London, on the &quot;Roll of Honour&quot; on the Valençay SOE Memorial in the town of Valençay, in the Indre département of France, and on the &quot;Roll of Honour&quot; in Limpsfield, Surrey. She is also commemorated on the Tempsford Memorial in the village of Tempsford in the county of Bedfordshire in the East of England and on the town war memorial in Moreton-in-Marsh. A later memorial, the SOE Agents Memorial in Lambeth Palace Road (Westminster, London), is dedicated to all SOE agents.

The concentration camp where she died is now a French government historical site: a plaque to Rowden and the three women who died with her is part of the Deportation Memorial on the site. In 1985, SOE agent and painter Brian Stonehouse, who saw Rowden and the other female SOE agents at the Natzweiler-Struthof concentration camp just before their deaths, painted a watercolour of the four women which now hangs in the Special Forces Club in London.

<text>Moncalieri (; ) is a &quot;comune&quot; (municipality) of 56,134 inhabitants (31 January 2022) about directly south of downtown Turin (to whose Metropolitan City it belongs), in Piedmont, Italy. It is the most populous suburb of Turin and it is notable for its castle, built in the 12th century and enlarged in the 15th century, which later became the favorite residence of King Victor Emmanuel II of Italy and of his daughter Princess Maria Clotilde of Savoy. It is part of the World Heritage Site &quot;Residences of the Royal House of Savoy&quot;.

==History==
Moncalieri was founded in 1228 by some inhabitants of Testona (now a &quot;frazione&quot; of the &quot;comune &quot;of Moncalieri) as a refuge from the assaults from Chieri. The easy access to the Po River and the bridge (a Templar possession for a long time) that it commanded granted a certain flourishing to the city, which became a free &quot;comune&quot; and housed a number of monastic institutions.

In the 17th century it was acquired by the House of Savoy, whose members often lived in their castle here during the summer. During the unification of Italy it was the site of the famous Proclamation of Moncalieri. Having maintained its tradition as a summer resort, today Moncalieri is also home to many high technology companies.

==Main sights==

The castle is one of the Savoy Residences listed as a World Heritage Site. It hosts since 1919 a prestigious carabinieri school.

Close to the castle, the descending square of Piazza Vittorio Emanuele II was in the past the major centre for the Moncalieri activities. Its cobbled pavement was built back in 1825, and a sculpture-fountain of Neptune (&quot;Il Saturnio&quot;) can be found in the top part of it. For aesthetic as well as practical reasons, the Neptune fountain was several times moved back and forth. A small passage connects this square to the prestigious Real Collegio Carlo Alberto, school aimed for aristocratic descendants. Nowadays, the Collegio Carlo Alberto is managed by a joint initiative of the Compagnia di San Paolo and the University of Turin; their mission is to foster research and teaching in law, economics, finance and political science.

The Gothic church of &quot;Santa Maria della Scala&quot; houses the remains of the local patron. Other churches of interest are the later &quot;San Francesco&quot;, &quot;Sant&#x27;Egidio&quot; and the &quot;Chiesa del Gesù&quot;.

==Culture==
Moncalieri is devoted to Beato Bernardo: around the day dedicated to him (July 12), a historical reconstruction of his arrival in Moncalieri from Baden-Baden in 1458 is held.

<text>The Panther tank, officially Panzerkampfwagen V Panther (abbreviated Pz.Kpfw. V) with ordnance inventory designation: &quot;Sd.Kfz.&quot; 171, is a German medium tank of World War II. It was used in most European theatres of World War II from mid-1943 to the end of the war in May 1945.

The Panther was intended to counter the Soviet T-34 medium tank and to replace the Panzer III and Panzer IV. Nevertheless, it served alongside the Panzer IV and the heavier Tiger I until the end of the war. While having essentially the same Maybach V12 petrol (690 hp) engine as the Tiger I, the Panther had better gun penetration, was lighter and faster, and could traverse rough terrain better than the Tiger I. The trade-off was weaker side armour, which made it vulnerable to flanking fire, and a weaker high explosive shell. The Panther proved to be effective in open country and long-range engagements. The Panther had excellent firepower, protection and mobility, though early variants suffered from reliability issues. The Panther was far cheaper to produce than the Tiger I. Key elements of the Panther design, such as its armour, transmission, and final drive, were simplifications made to improve production rates and address raw material shortages.

The Panther was rushed into combat at the Battle of Kursk in the summer of 1943 despite numerous unresolved technical problems, leading to high losses due to mechanical failures. Most design flaws were rectified by late 1943 and early 1944, though the Allied bombing of production plants in Germany, increasing shortages of high-quality alloys for critical components, shortage of fuel and training space, and the declining quality of crews all impacted the tank&#x27;s effectiveness. Though officially classified as a medium tank, at 44.8 metric tons the Panther was closer in weight to contemporary foreign heavy tanks. The Panther&#x27;s weight caused logistical problems, such as an inability to cross certain bridges; otherwise, the tank had a very high power-to-weight ratio which made it highly mobile.

The naming of Panther production variants did not follow alphabetical order, unlike most German tanks - the initial variant, Panther &quot;D&quot; (&quot;Ausf. D&quot;), was followed by &quot;A&quot; and &quot;G&quot; variants.

==Development and production==
===Design===
The Panther was born out of a project started in 1938 to replace the Panzer III and Panzer IV tanks. The initial requirements of the VK 20 series called for a fully tracked vehicle weighing 20 tonnes and design proposals by Krupp, Daimler-Benz and MAN ensued. These designs were abandoned and Krupp dropped out of the competition entirely as the requirements increased to a vehicle weighing 30 tonnes, a direct reaction to the encounters with the Soviet T-34 and KV-1 tanks and against the advice of Wa Prüf 6. The T-34 outclassed the existing models of the Panzer III and IV in certain metrics, such as effective armour thickness and gun caliber. At the insistence of General Heinz Guderian, a special tank commission was created to assess the T-34. Among the features of the Soviet tank considered most significant was the sloped armour, which gave much improved effective armour thickness, the wide track, which improved mobility over soft terrain, and the gun, which had good armour penetration and fired an effective high-explosive round. Daimler-Benz (DB), which designed the successful Panzer III and StuG III, and Maschinenfabrik Augsburg-Nürnberg AG (MAN) were given the task of designing a new 30- to 35-tonne tank, designated VK 30.02, by April 1942.

The &quot;VK 30.02(DB)&quot; design resembled the T-34 in its hull and turret and was also to be powered by a diesel engine. It was driven from the rear drive sprocket with the turret situated forward. The incorporation of a diesel engine promised increased operational range, reduced flammability and allowed for better use of petroleum reserves. Adolf Hitler considered a diesel engine imperative for the new tank. DB&#x27;s proposal used an external leaf spring suspension, in contrast to the MAN&#x27;s proposal of twin torsion bars. Wa Prüf 6&#x27;s opinion was that the leaf spring suspension was a disadvantage and that using torsion bars would allow greater internal hull width. It also opposed the rear drive because of the potential for track fouling. Daimler-Benz still preferred the leaf springs over a torsion bar suspension as it resulted in a silhouette about shorter and rendered complex shock absorbers unnecessary. The employment of a rear drive provided additional crew space and also allowed for a better slope on the front hull, which was considered important in preventing penetration by armour-piercing shells.

The MAN design embodied a more conventional configuration, with the transmission and drive sprocket in the front and a centrally mounted turret. It had a petrol engine and eight torsion bar suspension axles per side. Because of the torsion bar suspension and the drive shaft running under the turret basket, the MAN Panther was higher and had a wider hull than the DB design. The Henschel company&#x27;s design concepts for their Tiger I tank&#x27;s suspension/drive components, using its characteristic &quot;Schachtellaufwerk&quot; format – large, overlapping, interleaved road wheels with a &quot;slack-track&quot; using no return rollers for the upper run of track, also features shared with almost all German military half-track designs since the late 1930s – were repeated with the MAN design for the Panther. These multiple large, rubber-rimmed steel wheels distributed ground pressure more evenly across the track. The MAN proposal also complemented Rheinmetall&#x27;s already designed turret modified from that of the VK 45.01 (H), and used a virtually identical Maybach V12 engine to the Tiger I heavy tank&#x27;s Maybach HL230 powerplant model.

The two designs were reviewed from January to March 1942. &quot;Reichsminister&quot; Fritz Todt, and later his replacement Albert Speer, both recommended the DB design to Hitler because of its advantages over the initial MAN design. At the final submission, MAN refined its design, having learned from the DB proposal apparently through a leak by a former employee in the &quot;Wa Prüf 6&quot;, senior engineer Heinrich Ernst Kniepkamp and others. On 5 March 1942, Albert Speer reported that Hitler considered the Daimler-Benz design to be superior to MAN&#x27;s design. A review by a special commission appointed by Hitler in May 1942 selected the MAN design. Hitler approved this decision after reviewing it overnight. One of the principal reasons given for this decision was that the MAN design used an existing turret designed by Rheinmetall-Borsig, while the DB design would have required a brand new turret and engine to be designed and produced, delaying the commencement of production. This time-saving measure compromised the subsequent development of the design.

Albert Speer recounted in his autobiography &quot;Inside the Third Reich&quot;:
On 27 February 1944, it was redesignated simply PzKpfw Panther, as Hitler ordered that the Roman numeral &quot;V&quot; be deleted from its designation. In contemporary English-language literature it is sometimes referred to as the &quot;Mark V&quot;.

===Production===
A mild-steel prototype of the MAN design was produced by September 1942 and, after testing at Kummersdorf, was officially accepted. It was put into immediate production. The start of production was delayed, mainly because of a shortage of specialized machine tools needed for the machining of the hull. Finished tanks were produced in December and suffered from reliability problems as a result. The demand for this tank was so high that the manufacturing was soon expanded beyond MAN to include Daimler-Benz (Berlin-Marienfelde, former DMG plant), Maschinenfabrik Niedersachsen Hanover (MNH, a subsidiary of Eisenwerk Wülfel) and the Tiger I&#x27;s original designer, Henschel &amp; Sohn in Kassel.

The initial production target was 250 tanks per month at the MAN plant at Nuremberg. This was increased to 600 per month in January 1943. Despite determined efforts, this figure was never reached due to disruption by Allied bombing, and manufacturing and resource bottlenecks. Production in 1943 averaged 148 per month. In 1944, it averaged 315 a month (3,777 having been built that year), peaking with 380 in July and ending around the end of March 1945, with at least 6,000 built in total. Frontline combat strength peaked on 1 September 1944 at 2,304 tanks, but that same month a record number of 692 tanks were reported lost.

The process of streamlining the production of German armoured fighting vehicles first began after Speer became a &quot;Reichsminister&quot; in early 1942, and steadily accelerated through to 1944; the production of the Panther tank coincided with this period of increased manufacturing efficiency. At the beginning of the war, German armoured fighting vehicle manufacturers had employed labour-intensive and costly manufacturing methods unsuitable for the needs of mass production; even with streamlined production methods introduced later, Germany never approached the efficiency of Allied manufacturing during World War II.

The Allies directed their bombing at the common bottleneck for both Panther and Tiger production: the Maybach engine plant. This was bombed the night of 27/28 April 1944 and production halted for five months. A second factory had already been planned, the Auto Union Siegmar plant (the former Wanderer car factory), and this came on line in May 1944. The targeting of Panther factories began with a bombing raid on the DB plant on 6 August 1944, and again on the night of 23/24 August. MAN was struck on 10 September, 3 October and 19 October 1944, and then again on 3 January and 20/21 February 1945. MNH was not attacked until 14 and 28 March 1945.

In addition to interfering with tank production goals, the bombing forced a steep drop in the production of spare parts (as a percentage of tank production, it dropped from 25–30% in 1943 to 8% in late 1944). This compounded the problems with numbers of operational Panthers and their reliability, as the tanks in the field had to be cannibalised for parts.

===Production figures===
The Panther was the third most produced German armoured fighting vehicle, after the Sturmgeschütz III assault gun/tank destroyer at 9,408 units, and the Panzer IV tank at 8,298 units.

===Cost===
A Panther tank cost 117,100 Reichsmark (RM) to produce.
This compared with 82,500 RM for the StuG III, 96,163 RM for the Panzer III, 103,462 RM for the Panzer IV, and 250,800 RM for the Tiger I. These figures did not include the cost of the armaments and radio. Using forced labour on the production lines greatly reduced costs, but also greatly increased the risk of sabotage (postwar French Army studies in 1947 found that many Panthers had been sabotaged during production). The Germans increasingly strove for production methods that would allow higher production rates and lower cost. By comparison the total cost of the early production Tiger I in 1942–1943 was stated to be as high as 800,000 RM.

According to rough estimates, the labour hours required to produce one Panther were 25% higher in comparison to the Panzer III (i.e. four Panthers for every five Panzer III tanks built).

==Design==
The weight of the production model was increased to 45 tonnes from the original plans for a 35-tonne tank. Hitler was briefed thoroughly on the comparison between the MAN and DB designs in the report by Guderian&#x27;s tank commission. Armour protection appeared to be inadequate, while &quot;the motor mounted on the rear appeared to him correct&quot;. He agreed that the &quot;decisive factor was the possibility of quickly getting the tank into production&quot;. On 15 May 1942, informed MAN that Hitler had decided in favour of the MAN design for the Panther and ordered series production of the tank. The upper glacis plate was to be increased from to . Hitler demanded that an increase to should be attempted and that at least all vertical surfaces were to be ; the turret front plate was increased from to .

The Panther was rushed into combat before all of its teething problems had been corrected. Reliability was considerably improved over time, and the Panther proved to be a very effective fighting vehicle, although some of its design flaws, such as weak final drive, were never fully rectified.

General Hasso von Manteuffel considered the Panther Germany&#x27;s &quot;most satisfactory&quot; tank, saying it &quot;would have been close to the ideal, had it been possible to design with a lower silhouette.&quot;

===Crew===
The Panther had five crew members: commander, gunner, loader, driver, and radio operator. The commander, loader and gunner were in the turret, while the driver and radio operator were in the hull of the vehicle. The driver sat on the front-left side of the tank and next to him was the tank&#x27;s machine gunner, whose tasks also included operating the radio.

===Engine===
The first 250 Panthers were powered by a Maybach HL210 P30 V12 petrol engine, which delivered 650 metric hp at 3,000 rpm and had three simple air filters. Starting in May 1943, Panthers were built using the 700 metric horsepower (690 hp, 515 kW) at 3,000 rpm, 23.1 litre HL230 P30 V12 petrol engine. To save on aluminium, the light alloy block in the HL210 was replaced with one made of cast iron. Two multistage &quot;cyclone&quot; air filters were used to improve dust removal. The engine&#x27;s power output was reduced when low-grade petrol was used. With its fuel capacity of of petrol, a fully fuelled Panther&#x27;s range was on surfaced roads and cross country.

The HL230 P30 engine was a very compact tunnel crankcase design, and it kept the space between the cylinder walls to a minimum. The crankshaft was composed of seven &quot;discs&quot; or main journals, each with an outer race of roller bearings, and a crankshaft pin between each disc. To reduce the length of the engine by an inch or so, and reduce unbalanced rocking moment caused by a normal offset-Vee type engine, the two banks of 6 cylinders of the V-12 were not offset: the &quot;big ends&quot; of the connecting rods of each cylinder pair in the &quot;V&quot; where they mated with the crankpin were thus at the same spot with respect to the engine block&#x27;s length rather than offset. This required a &quot;fork and blade&quot; matched pair of connecting rods for each transversely oriented pair of cylinders. Usually, &quot;V&quot;-form engines have their transversely paired cylinders&#x27; connecting rods&#x27; &quot;big ends&quot; simply placed side by side on the crankpin, with their transverse pairs of cylinders offset slightly to allow the connecting rod big ends to attach side by side while still being in the cylinder bore centreline. This compact arrangement with the connecting rods was the source of considerable problems initially. Blown head gaskets were another problem, which was corrected with improved seals in September 1943. Improved bearings were introduced in November 1943. An engine governor was also added in November 1943 that reduced the maximum engine speed to 2,500 rpm. An eighth crankshaft bearing was added beginning in January 1944 to reduce motor failures.

The engine compartment was designed to be watertight so that the Panther could ford water obstacles; however, this made the engine compartment poorly ventilated and prone to overheating. The fuel connectors in early Panthers were not insulated, leading to the leakage of fuel fumes into the engine compartment, which caused engine fires. Additional ventilation was added to draw off these gases, which only partly solved the problem of engine fires. Other measures taken to reduce this problem included improving the coolant circulation inside the motor and adding a reinforced membrane spring to the fuel pump. Despite the risks of fire, the fighting compartment was relatively safe due to a solid firewall that separated it from the engine compartment.

Engine reliability improved over time. The average service life expectancy without the need to dismount the engine from the tank was about 2000 km, or around 100 working hours. A French assessment in 1947 of their stock of captured Normandy Panther A tanks concluded that the engine had an average life of and maximum life of .

===Suspension===
The suspension consisted of front drive sprockets, rear idlers and eight double-interleaved rubber-rimmed steel road wheels on each side – in the so-called &quot;Schachtellaufwerk&quot; design on a dual torsion bar suspension. The dual torsion bar system, designed by Professor , allowed for a wide travel stroke and rapid oscillations with high reliability, thus allowing for relatively high speed travel over undulating terrain. The extra space required for the bars running across the length of the bottom of the hull, below the turret basket, increased the overall height of the tank. When damaged by mines, the torsion bars often required a welding torch for removal.

The Panther&#x27;s suspension was over-engineered, and the &quot;Schachtellaufwerk&quot; interleaved road wheel system made replacing inner road wheels time-consuming (though it could operate with missing or broken wheels). The interleaved wheels also had a tendency to become clogged with mud, rocks and ice, and could freeze solid overnight in the harsh winter weather that followed the autumn &quot;rasputitsa&quot; (muddy season) on the Eastern Front. During its design phase, the problem of the running gear becoming blocked with mud or snow was reduced to a minimum. Shell damage could cause the road wheels to jam together and become difficult to separate. Interleaved wheels had long been standard on all German half-tracks, with extra wheels providing better flotation and stability and more armour protection for the thin hull sides than systems with smaller or non-interleaved wheels; but its complexity meant that no other country ever adopted this design for their tanks.

The Inspector General of Armoured Troops reported in May 1944:
In September 1944, and again in March/April 1945, MAN built a limited number of Panthers with overlapping non-interleaved steel-rimmed 80 cm diameter road wheels originally designed for Henschel&#x27;s Tiger II and late-series Tiger I Ausf. E tanks. These steel-rimmed wheels were introduced from hull number 121052 due to raw material shortages.

From November 1944 through February 1945, a conversion process began to use sleeve bearings in the Panther tank, as there was a shortage of ball bearings. The sleeve bearings were primarily used in the running gear; plans were also made to convert the transmission to sleeve bearings, but were not carried out due to the ending of Panther production.

===Steering and transmission===
Steering was accomplished through a seven-speed AK 7-200 synchromesh gearbox from Zahnradfabrik Friedrichshafen (ZF), and a MAN single radius steering system, operated by steering levers. Each gear had a fixed radius of turning, ranging from for 1st gear up to for 7th gear. The driver was expected to judge the sharpness of a turn ahead of time and shift into the appropriate gear to turn the tank. The driver could also engage the brakes on one side to force a sharper turn. This was a much simplified design compared to the Tiger tanks.

The AK 7-200 transmission was capable of pivot turns but only when the ground resistance on both tracks was the same. This high-torque method of turning could cause failures of the final drive. The overstressed transmission system led to premature stripping of the third gear. This was compounded by alloy shortages which made gears more brittle and prone to failure. To reach the final drive for repair, the entire driver&#x27;s compartment and transmission had to be disassembled and lifted out.

====Final drive====
The Panther&#x27;s main weakness was its final drive unit. The problems stemmed from several factors. The original MAN proposal had called for the Panther to have an epicyclic gearing (planetary) system in the final drive, similar to that used in the Tiger I. Germany suffered from a shortage of gear-cutting machine tools and for mass-production numerous simplifications were made to the design and its manufacture, sometimes against the wishes of designers and army officers. Consequently, the final drive was changed to a double spur system; although simpler to produce, the double spur gears had higher loads, making them prone to failure.

A report by Dr. Puschel of MAN said &quot;The main cause of these failures was fatigue of the compound intermediate gear due to the low-core strength of the material used and the absence of case hardening at the critical sections&quot; and &quot;the use of split ring dowels with only a few bolts to retain the main drive gear to its flange proved unsatisfactory. This difficulty was subsequently overcome by...fitting bolts.&quot;

German industry made a number of modifications to the final drive units on the Panther Ausf. G in September and October 1944 to increase the durability of the unit.
Jacques Littlefield, of the Military Vehicle Technology Foundation, which restored a Panther Ausf. A, said &quot;we found that the alloy and gears used in their construction were as good as we could make them today. I suspect the main problem with the final drive was that they were designed for a much lighter version of the Panther...Once they started to up-armor the Panther, there was no room to beef up the final drives to handle the extra weight.&quot;

===Armour===
Initial production Panthers had a face-hardened glacis plate (the main front hull armour piece), but as armour-piercing capped rounds became the standard in all armies (thus defeating the benefits of face-hardening, which caused uncapped rounds to shatter), this requirement was deleted in March 1943. By August 1943, Panthers were being built only with a homogeneous steel glacis plate. The front hull had of armour angled at 55 degrees from the vertical, welded but also interlocked with the side and bottom plates for strength. The combination of moderately thick and well-sloped armour meant that heavy Allied weapons, such as the Soviet 122 mm A-19, 100 mm BS-3 and US 90 mm M3, were needed to assure penetration of the upper glacis at normal combat ranges.

The armour for the side hull and superstructure (the side sponsons) was much thinner at . The thinner side armour was necessary to reduce the weight, but made the Panther vulnerable to hits from the side by all Allied tank and anti-tank guns. German tactical doctrine for the use of the Panther emphasized the importance of flank protection and -thick spaced armour or armoured skirts, known as &quot;Schürzen&quot; were added. Intended to provide protection for the lower side hull from Soviet anti-tank rifles such as the PTRS-41, the armour was fitted on the hull side. &quot;Zimmerit&quot; coating against magnetic mines started to be applied at the factory on late Ausf. D models beginning in September 1943; an order for field units to apply &quot;Zimmerit&quot; to older versions of the Panther was issued in November 1943. In September 1944, orders to stop all application of &quot;Zimmerit&quot; were issued, based on false rumours that hits on the &quot;Zimmerit&quot; had caused vehicle fires. Panther crews were aware of the weak side armour and made augmentations by hanging track links or spare roadwheels onto the turret and/or the hull sides.

The rear hull top armour was only thick, and had two radiator fans and four air intake louvres over the engine compartment that were vulnerable to strafing by aircraft.

As the war progressed, Germany was forced to reduce or eliminate critical alloying metals in the production of armour plate, such as nickel, tungsten and molybdenum; this resulted in lower impact resistance levels compared to earlier armour. In 1943, Allied bombers struck and severely damaged the Knaben mine in Norway, eliminating a key source of molybdenum; supplies from Finland and Japan were also cut off. The loss of molybdenum, and its replacement with other substitutes to maintain hardness, as well as a general loss of quality control, resulted in an increased brittleness in German armour plate, which developed a tendency to fracture when struck with a shell. Testing by U.S. Army officers in August 1944 in Isigny, France showed catastrophic cracking of the armour plate on two out of three Panthers examined.

===Armament===
The main gun was a Rheinmetall-Borsig 7.5 cm KwK 42 (L/70) with semi-automatic shell ejection and a supply of 79 rounds (82 on Ausf. G). The main gun used three different types of ammunition: APCBC-HE (&quot;Pzgr. 39/42&quot;), HE (&quot;Sprgr. 42&quot;) and APCR (&quot;Pzgr. 40/42&quot;), the last of which was usually in short supply. While it was of a calibre common on Allied tanks, the Panther&#x27;s gun was one of the most powerful of World War II, due to the large propellant charge and the long barrel, which gave it a very high muzzle velocity and excellent armour-piercing qualities — among Allied tank guns of similar calibre, none had equivalent muzzle energy. Only the British Sherman Firefly conversion&#x27;s Ordnance QF 17-pounder gun — 3 inch (76.2mm) calibre, and a 55 calibre long (L/55) barrel, with its access to APDS shot — had more potential armour perforation power, but it was considerably less accurate owing to disturbances caused by the separation of shot and sabot and at a cost of less severe damage inside the target after perforation of the armour. The flat trajectory and accuracy of the full bore ammunition also made hitting targets much easier, since accuracy was less sensitive to errors in range estimation and increased the chance of hitting a moving target. The Panther&#x27;s 75 mm gun had more penetrating power than the main gun of the Tiger I heavy tank, the 8.8 cm KwK 36 L/56, although the larger 88 mm projectile might inflict more damage if it did penetrate. The 75 mm HE round was inferior to the 88mm HE round used for infantry support, but was on par with most other 75mm HE rounds used by other tanks and assault guns.

The tank typically had two MG 34 armoured-fighting-vehicle-variant machine-guns featuring an armoured barrel-sleeve. An MG 34 machine-gun was located co-axially with the main gun on the gun mantlet; an identical MG 34 was located on the glacis plate and fired by the radio operator. Initial Ausf. D and early Ausf. A models used a &quot;letterbox&quot; flap enclosing its underlying thin, vertical arrowslit-like aperture, through which the machine gun was fired. In later Ausf. A and all Ausf. G models (starting in late November-early December 1943), a ball mount in the glacis plate with a K.Z.F.2 machine-gun sight was installed for the hull machine-gun.

Initial Ausf. D were equipped with the Nebelwurfgerät with the later Ausf. A and Ausf. G receiving the Nahverteidigungswaffe.

===Ammunition storage===
Ammunition storage for the main gun was a weak point. All the ammunition for the main armament was stored in the hull, with a significant amount stored in the sponsons. In the Ausf. D and A models, 18 rounds were stored next to the turret on each side, for a total of 36 rounds. In the Ausf. G, which had deeper sponsons, 24 rounds were stored on each side of the turret, for a total of 48 rounds. In all models, four rounds were also stored in the left sponson between the driver and the turret. An additional 36 rounds were stored inside the hull of the Ausf. D and A models – 27 in the forward hull compartment directly underneath the mantlet. In the Ausf. G, the hull ammunition storage was reduced to 27 rounds total, with 18 rounds in the forward hull compartment. For all models, three rounds were kept under the turntable of the turret. The stowage of 52 rounds of ammunition in the side sponsons made this area the most vulnerable point on the Panther since penetration here usually led to catastrophic ammunition fires. The loader was stationed in the right side of the turret. With the turret facing forward, he had access only to the right sponson and hull ammunition, and so these served as the main ready-ammunition bins.

===Turret===

The front of the turret was a curved thick cast armour mantlet. Its transverse-cylindrical shape meant that it was more likely to deflect shells, but the lower section created a shot trap. If a non-penetrating hit bounced downwards off its lower section, it could penetrate the thin forward hull roof armour, and plunge down into the front hull compartment. Penetrations of this nature could have catastrophic results, since the compartment housed the driver and radio operator sitting along both sides of the massive gearbox and steering unit. Also, four magazines containing main gun ammunition were located between the driver/radio operator seats and the turret, directly underneath the gun mantlet when the turret was facing forward.

From September 1944, a slightly redesigned mantlet with a flattened and much thicker lower &quot;chin&quot; design started to be fitted to Panther Ausf. G models, the chin being intended to prevent such deflections. Conversion to the &quot;chin&quot; design was gradual, and Panthers continued to be produced to the end of the war with the rounded gun mantlet.

The Ausf. A model introduced a new cast armour commander&#x27;s cupola, replacing the forged cupola. It featured a steel hoop to which a third MG 34 or either the coaxial or the bow machine gun could be mounted for use in the anti-aircraft role.

Powered turret traverse was provided by the variable speed Boehringer-Sturm L4 hydraulic motor, which was driven from the main engine by a secondary drive shaft, the same system as on the PzKpfw.VI Tiger. On early production versions of the Panther maximum turret traverse was limited to 6º/second, whilst on later versions a selectable high speed traverse gear was added. Thus the turret could be rotated 360 degrees at up to 6º/second in low gear independent of engine rpm (same as on early production versions), or up to 19º/second with the high speed setting and engine at 2000 rpm, and at over 36º/second at the maximum allowable engine speed of 3000 rpm. The direction and speed of traverse was controlled by the gunner through foot pedals, the speed of traverse corresponding to the level of depression the gunner applied to the foot pedal. This system allowed for very precise control of powered traverse, a light touch on the pedal resulting in a minimum traverse speed of 0.1 deg/sec (360 degrees in 60 min), unlike in most other tanks of the time (e.g. US M4 Sherman or Soviet T-34) this allowed for fine laying of the gun without the gunner needing to use his traverse handwheel.

==Combat history and use==
Panthers were supplied to form &quot;Panzer Abteilung&quot; 51 (Tank Battalion 51) on 9 January, and then &quot;Panzer Abteilung&quot; 52 on 6 February 1943.

===Eastern Front===
The Panther tank was seen as a necessary component of Operation Citadel, and the attack was delayed several times because of their mechanical problems and to receive more Panthers, with the eventual start date of the battle only six days after the last Panthers had been delivered to the front. This resulted in major problems in Panther units during the Battle of Kursk, as tactical training at the unit level, coordination by radio, and driver training were all seriously deficient.

It was not until 23–29 June 1943 that a total of 200 rebuilt Panthers were finally issued to Panther Regiment von Lauchert, of the XLVIII Panzer Corps (4 Panzer Army). Two were immediately lost due to motor fires on disembarking from the trains. By 5 July, when the Battle of Kursk started, there were only 184 operational Panthers. Within two days, this had dropped to 40. A report on 20 July 1943 showed 41 Panthers as operational, 85 as repairable, 16 severely damaged and needing repair in Germany, 56 burnt out because of enemy action, and two destroyed by motor fires.

The Panther demonstrated its capacity to destroy any Soviet armoured fighting vehicle from long distance during the Battle of Kursk, and had a very high overall kill ratio. It constituted less than seven percent of the estimated 2,400–2,700 total armoured fighting vehicles deployed by the Germans in this battle, but claimed 267 destroyed tanks. Despite this, its greatest historical role in the battle may have been a highly negative one—its contribution to the decisions to delay the original start of Operation Citadel for a total of two months, time which the Soviets used to build up an enormous concentration of minefields, anti-tank guns, trenches and artillery defences.

After the losses of the Battle of Kursk, the German Army went into a permanent state of retreat from the Red Army. The numbers of Panthers were slowly built up again on the Eastern Front, and the operational percentage increased as reliability improved. In March 1944 Guderian reported: &quot;Almost all the bugs have been worked out&quot;, although many units continued to report significant mechanical problems, especially with the final drive. The greatly outnumbered Panthers came to be used as mobile reserves to fight off major attacks.

The highest total number of operational Panthers on the Eastern Front was achieved in September 1944, when some 522 were listed as operational out of a total of 728. Throughout the rest of the war Germany continued to keep the great majority of Panther forces on the Eastern Front, where the situation progressively worsened for them. The last recorded status, on 15 March 1945, listed 740 on the Eastern Front, of which 361 were operational. By this time the Red Army had entered East Prussia and was advancing through Poland.

In August 1944 Panthers were deployed during the Warsaw Uprising as mobile artillery and troop support. At least two of them were captured in the early days of the conflict and used in actions against the Germans, including the liberation of the Gęsiówka concentration camp on 5 August, when the soldiers of &quot;Wacek&quot; platoon used the captured Panther (named &quot;Magda&quot;) to destroy the bunkers and watchtowers of the camp. Most of the Germans in the camp were killed; the insurgents had lost two people and liberated almost 350 people. After several days the captured tanks were immobilized due to the lack of fuel and batteries and were set ablaze to prevent them from being recaptured.

In February 1945 during the Lower Silesian offensive operation, one captured ex-German &quot;Panther&quot; tank with an experienced crew from under the command of the Hero of the Soviet Union Lt. was used in a reconnaissance mission. At dusk, the tank passed through the forest, attacked from the flank and destroyed three enemy &quot;Panther&quot; tanks, but then, during the retreat to Soviet positions, it was hit by German artillery and damaged. After the battle the tank was written off due to lack of spare parts and maintenance problems.

===Western Front – France===

At the time of the invasion of Normandy in June 1944, there were initially only two Panther-equipped Panzer regiments in the Western Front, with a total of 156 Panthers between them. From June through August 1944, an additional seven Panther regiments were sent into France, reaching a maximum strength of 432 in a status report dated 30 July 1944.

The majority of the German tank forces in Normandy — six and a half divisions — were drawn into fighting the Anglo-Canadian forces of the 21st Army Group around the town of Caen. The numerous operations undertaken to secure the town became collectively known as the Battle of Caen. While there were areas of heavy wooded bocage around Caen, most of the terrain was open fields which allowed the Panther to engage the attacking enemy armour at long range — its combination of superior armour and firepower allowed it to engage at distances from which the Shermans could not respond. Conversely, by the time of the Normandy Campaign, British divisional anti-tank regiments were well equipped with the excellent 17-pounder gun, and some U.S.-supplied M10 tank destroyers had their 3-inch gun replaced with the 17pdr (giving the 17pdr SP Achilles), making it equally as perilous for Panthers to attack across these same fields. The British had begun converting regular M4 Shermans to carry the 17-pounder gun (nicknamed Firefly) prior to the D-Day landings. While limited numbers meant that during Normandy usually not more than one Sherman in each troop of four tanks was a Firefly variant, the lethality of the gun against German armour made them priority targets for German gunners.

In the meantime, U.S. forces, facing one and a half German panzer divisions, mainly the &quot;Panzer Lehr&quot; Division, struggled in the heavy, low-lying bocage terrain west of Caen. Like the Sherman, the Panther struggled in the bocage country of Normandy, and was vulnerable to side and close-in attacks in the built-up areas of cities and small towns. The commander of the &quot;Panzer Lehr&quot; Division, Gen. Fritz Bayerlein, reported on the difficulties experienced by the Panther tank in the fighting in Normandy:


Bayerlein still appreciated the Panther&#x27;s virtues used in the right conditions, writing: &quot;An ideal vehicle for tank battles and infantry support. The best tank in existence for its weight&quot;.

Through September and October, a series of new &quot;Panzerbrigades&quot; equipped with Panther tanks were sent into France to try to stop the Allied advance with counter-attacks. This culminated in a number of tank battles; firstly at Dompaire (12-14 September 1944) against the French 2nd Armoured Division where the newly formed 112 Panzer Brigade was decimated, which included the loss of 34 Panthers, and few losses for the French in return. Soon after that, the Battle of Arracourt (18–29 September) took place, and again mostly Panther-equipped German forces suffered heavy losses fighting against the 4th Armored Division of Patton&#x27;s Third Army, which were still primarily equipped with 75 mm M4 Sherman tanks and yet again, came away from the battle with few losses. The Panther units were newly formed, poorly trained and tactically disorganized; most units ended up stumbling into ambushes against seasoned U.S. tank crews.

===Western Front – Ardennes offensive===
A status report on 15 December 1944 listed an all-time high of 471 Panthers assigned to the Western Front, with 336 operational (71 percent). This was one day before the start of the Battle of the Bulge; 400 of the tanks assigned to the Western Front were in units sent into the offensive.

The Panther once again demonstrated its prowess in open country, where it could hit its targets at long range with near-impunity, and its vulnerability in the close-in fighting of the small towns of the Ardennes, where they suffered heavy losses. A status report on 15 January 1945 showed only 97 operational Panthers left in the units involved in the operation, out of 282 still in their possession. Total writeoffs were listed as 198.

The Operation Greif commando mission included five Panthers assigned to &quot;Panzerbrigade 150,&quot; disguised to look like M10 tank destroyers by welding on additional plates, applying U.S.-style camouflage paint and markings. This was carried out as part of a larger operation that involved soldiers disguised as Americans to attack U.S. troops from the rear. The disguised Panthers were detected and destroyed.

In February 1945, eight Panzer divisions with a total of 271 Panthers were transferred from the West to the Eastern Front. Only five Panther battalions remained in the west.

One of the top German Panther commanders was &quot;SS-Oberscharführer&quot; Ernst Barkmann of the 2nd SS-Panzer Regiment &quot;Das Reich&quot;. By the end of the war, he had some 80 tank kills claimed.

Historian Steven Zaloga observed that the Panther&#x27;s performance in the Ardennes operation against American M4 Shermans was disappointing for a vehicle of its technical specifications, given the Panther&#x27;s superior armour and armament to the Sherman. Zaloga argues that this was down to the fact that at this point in the war, the quality of German tank crews had fallen and most Panther crews were inexperienced with minimal training. The lack of training exacerbated the Panther&#x27;s technical weaknesses (poor power train durability and a lack of fuel and spare parts), resulting in many Panthers breaking down which were unable to be salvaged. Thus while a Panther was superior to a Sherman in the hands of an experienced crew, inadequate training, coupled with Sherman numerical superiority, resulted in a poor combat performance for the vehicle during the offensive.

===Fortification===
From 1943, Panther turrets were mounted in fixed fortifications known officially as &quot;Ringstände&quot; (the type was called &quot;Tobruks&quot; because the practice first encountered during the North African campaign around the port of Tobruk).

Two types of turret emplacements were used: &quot;Pantherturm III – Betonsockel&quot; (concrete base) and &quot;Pantherturm I – Stahluntersatz&quot; (steel sub-base). Some used normal production turrets, but most were reinforced with additional roof armour to withstand artillery fire. They housed ammunition storage and fighting compartment along with crew quarters. A total of 182 of these were installed in the fortifications of the Atlantic Wall and Siegfried Line (&quot;Westwall&quot;), 48 in the Gothic Line and Hitler Line, 36 on the Eastern Front, and two for training and experimentation, for a total of 268 installations by March 1945. They proved costly to attack, and difficult to destroy.

===Battalion organisation===
From September 1943, one &quot;Panzer&quot; battalion with 96 Panthers which constituted the &quot;Panzer&quot; regiment of a &quot;Panzer-Division&quot;, was organised thus:

* Battalion Command (composed of Communication and Reconnaissance Platoons)
** Communication Platoon – 3 × &quot;Befehlswagen&quot; Panther Sd.Kfz. 267/268
** Reconnaissance Platoon – 5 × Panther
* 1st Company – 22 × Panther
** Company Command – 2 × Panther
** 1st Platoon – 5 × Panther
** 2nd Platoon – 5 × Panther
** 3rd Platoon – 5 × Panther
** 4th Platoon – 5 × Panther
* 2nd Company – 22 × Panther
* 3rd Company – 22 × Panther
* 4th Company – 22 × Panther
* Service Platoon – 2 × &quot;Bergepanther&quot; Sd.Kfz. 179

From 3 August 1944, the new &quot;Panzer-Division 44&quot; organisation called for a &quot;Panzer&quot; division to consist of one &quot;Panzer&quot; regiment with two &quot;Panzer&quot; battalions, one of 96 Panzer IVs and one of 96 Panthers. Actual strengths tended to differ, and became far lower after losses.

===Reliability===

The first production Panther tanks were plagued with mechanical problems. The engine was dangerously prone to overheating and suffered from connecting rod or bearing failures. Petrol leaks from the fuel pump or carburettor, as well as motor oil leaks from gaskets, produced fires in the engine compartment; which resulted in the total write-off of three Panthers due to fires. Transmission and final drive breakdowns were the most common and difficult to repair. A large list of other problems were detected in these early Panthers, and so from April through May 1943 all Panthers were shipped to Falkensee and Nürnberg for a major rebuilding program. This did not correct all of the problems, so a second program was started at Grafenwoehr and Erlangen in June 1943. Reliability improved with the Ausf. A and later G of the Panther, with availability rates going from an average of 37% by end of 1943 to an average of 54% in 1944.

The first Panthers saw combat at Kursk in summer 1943, revealing reliability issues beyond that typically expected for a new weapon system. Combat readiness remained low throughout 1943. A contemporary report reported that, &quot;Until reaching the first preparation area, 50% of the vehicles were inoperative: 2/3 of them with engine breakdowns and 1/3 with and lateral transmission system.&quot; Fuel pump failures were also common. The Panther&#x27;s operational rate at the end of July 1943 was only 16 percent.

After measures taken by Maybach from the beginning of 1944, the reliability and service life of the HL230 engine increased significantly, in practice equalling that of the HL120 engine found in the Panzer III and Panzer IV.

Guderian wrote on 5 March 1944: &quot;The frontline reports said service life of the tank&#x27;s engine had increased up from 700 to 1,000 km [435 to 621 miles]. In addition, the same Panther tank-equipped unit reported that final drive breakdowns had ended and that transmission and steering gear failures were now within an acceptable range, which is damning with faint praise.&quot; Guderian commented on the reliability: &quot;From 6 March to 15 April 1944, the &quot;1.Abteilung/Panzerregiment 2&quot; (1st Battalion, 2nd Panzer Regiment) reported a distance of between 1,500 km to 1,800 km. Four of their seven Panthers were still combat ready without any transmission or engine failure.&quot;

On 22 April 1944, the same battalion reported how a good driver and commander can improve reliability: &quot;This kept in mind, the battalion reported PzKpfw V Chassis No. 154338, Engine No. 8322046 reading 1,878km with driver Obergrefeiter Gablewski, 4.Kp/PzRgt 2. The vehicle was still totally operational. All items were in great condition but the tracks. The consumption of the engine has been 10ltr per 100km. The vehicle was still operating with its first engine and transmission. 

The Inspector General of Armoured Troops summarised in May 1944: &quot;The average lifespan of a Panther can now be roughly equal to that of a Panzer IV with around 1,500–2,000 kilometers between two major repair and maintenance processes, but in several cases, at approximately 1,500 km, the gear has broken down and the boxes have had to be replaced.&quot; This accompanied a report from I./Panzer Regiment 2 noting that engine fires had reduced, heavy wear on steering due to lack of crew instruction and time for maintenance, weakness in the reduction gear causing breakdowns and requesting improvements 

An example of Panther reliability appeared in the June 1944 edition of Nachrichtenblatt der Panzertruppen (Armoured Troops Bulletin), from a Panther-recovery tank driver&#x27;s report: &quot;Unteroffizier Krause of a Panther workshop platoon has driven his Panther recovery tank – Chassis No. 212132 – 4,200 km until 3 May 1944 without making any engine changes and without suffering any damage to the side reduction gears (Seitenvorgelege), gear change or clutch. Approximately 1000 km have been covered with a Panther tank in tow. The vehicle and engine are still in great condition and operational. 

On 28 June 1944, after the initial response to the Allied landings in Normandy, Guderian reported that &quot;The Panther is inclined to catch fire quickly. The lifetime of the Panther&#x27;s engines (1,400 to 1,500 km) is much higher than the Panther&#x27;s final drives. A solution to the final drive teething is immediately needed.&quot;

The various improvements began to have an effect on the combat-ready rate of the tanks deployed on the Eastern Front, which increased from 37% in February, to 50% in April, and 78% by the end of May 1944. In September and October 1944, further modifications were fitted into the final drives as countermeasures to the reported problems including worn gear teeth, parts, bearings, and insufficient lubrication.

A report from PzBrig 112 dated 16 September 1944 read:

This report shows that most technical problems on the Panther had been resolved, and it proved to be a reliable fighting vehicle. It also showed that the deployment of German tanks was very restricted: The entire battalion was lost.

==Allied response==
===Soviet===
The Tiger I and Panther tanks were German responses to encountering the T-34 in 1941. Soviet firing tests against a captured Tiger in April 1943 showed that the T-34&#x27;s 76 mm gun could not penetrate the front of the Tiger I; and could only penetrate the side at very close range. An existing Soviet 85 mm anti-aircraft gun, the D-5T, also proved disappointing. Several captured German Tiger I tanks were shipped to Chelyabinsk, where they were subjected to 85 mm fire from various angles. The 85 mm gun could not reliably penetrate the Tiger I except at ranges within the lethal envelope of the Tiger I&#x27;s own 88 mm gun. The Soviets had already embarked on the 85-mm-gun upgrade path before encountering the Panther tank at the Battle of Kursk.
The Battle of Kursk convinced the Soviets of the need for even greater firepower. A Soviet analysis of the battle in August 1943 showed that a Corps artillery piece, the A-19 122 mm gun, had done well against the German armoured fighting vehicles in that battle, and so development work on the 122 mm-equipped IS-2 began in late 1943. First encounters with enemy tanks revealed that the 122 mm BR-471 shell could punch through the Panther&#x27;s frontal armour at a range of . The early results of the IS-2&#x27;s combat employment, which were confirmed by firing tests in Kubinka 1944, compelled the designers to seek innovative solutions. According to German tactical instructions, a Panther had to close to to guarantee penetration of the IS-2&#x27;s frontal armour, while the IS-2 could penetrate the Panther at ranges of .

A Wa Prüf 1 report states that when set at a 30-degree angle the glacis plate of the Panther could not be penetrated by the 122 mm BR-471 AP shell, the lower glacis could be penetrated from , the turret mantlet from and the turret front from . The Panther&#x27;s 75 mm gun could penetrate the IS-2 model 1943&#x27;s mantlet from , turret from , and driver&#x27;s front plate from . From the side, the Panther&#x27;s armour was penetrable by the 122 mm D-25T from over . The Panther carried more ammunition and had a faster firing cycle: for every 1–1.5 shots of the IS-2, the Panther and Tiger could fire 3-4 times. With the addition of a semi-automatic drop breech over the previously manual screw, this breech modification increased the IS-2&#x27;s rate of fire to 3-4 rounds per minute.

The IS-2 proved to have surprisingly good anti-tank capabilities due to the D-25T&#x27;s extremely heavy HE projectiles. Standard doctrine for purpose-built anti-tank guns of the period universally relied on small, dense solid projectiles propelled to high velocities, optimized for punching through armour. However, the 122 mm HE shell would easily blow off the turret, drive sprocket and tread of the heaviest German tank even if it could not penetrate its armour.
The SU-152 self-propelled heavy howitzer was produced in large numbers throughout 1943, with the first SU-152s being issued to new heavy mechanised gun regiments raised in May 1943. It mounted a 152 mm gun-howitzer on the chassis of a KV-1S heavy tank. Later production used an IS tank chassis and was re-designated ISU-152. Because of its adopted role as an impromptu heavy tank destroyer, capable of knocking out the heaviest German armoured vehicles — Tiger and Panther tanks, and Elefant tank destroyers — it was nicknamed Zveroboy (&quot;Beast Slayer&quot;). As a self-propelled artillery piece, the SU-152 was generally issued with HE rounds rather than armour-piercing projectiles. The 152mm HE round produced a massive blast that did not rely on velocity for its effectiveness, making them effective against any German tank, including the Panther, Tiger and Elefant. It was renowned for its ability to rip the turret completely off a Panther or Tiger tank (at any range) by sheer blast effect alone, and numerous German AFVs were claimed as destroyed or damaged by SU-152 fire during the Battle of Kursk.

Early 1945, the SU-100 tank destroyer saw extensive service, when Soviet forces defeated the German Operation Frühlingserwachen offensive at Lake Balaton. The SU-100 quickly proved itself to be able to penetrate around of vertical armour from a range of and the sloped front armour of the Panther from .

===American and British===
The Western Allies were aware of the Panther and had access to technical details through the Soviets, but there was a difference in the American and British camps as to the significance of the tank. After taking two years to catch up with German tank design in Africa, the British were wary of falling behind yet again. They had developed the excellent 17-pounder anti-tank gun, but did not yet have a vehicle in service that could fit this large gun into its turret. For its part, the U.S. Army did not believe that the Panther would be a significant problem, and did not foresee their armoured forces having to fight pitched engagements against large numbers of Panthers. The Panther was not seen in combat by the Western Allies until early 1944 at Anzio in Italy, where Panthers were employed in small numbers. Until just before D-Day (6 June 1944), the Panther was thought to be another heavy tank that would not be built in large numbers.

Shortly before D-Day, Allied intelligence reported that large numbers of Panthers were being used in the Panzer divisions, and an attempt was made to investigate Panther production. Using a statistical analysis of the serial numbers on the road wheels on two captured tanks, U.S. intelligence estimated Panther production for February 1944 to be 270 units, much greater than what had been anticipated. This estimate was very accurate, especially compared to previous methods, as German records after the war showed production of Panthers for the month of February 1944 was 276. This indicated that the Panther would be encountered in much larger numbers than had previously been thought. In the planning for the Battle of Normandy, the U.S. Army expected to face a handful of German heavy tanks alongside large numbers of Panzer IVs. At this point, it was too late to prepare to face the Panther. As it turned out, 38% of the German tanks in Normandy were Panthers, whose frontal armour could not be penetrated by the 75 mm guns of the US M4 Sherman.
The British recognised the danger posed by the increasing armour-strength of German tanks, and work started in 1941 on a more powerful anti-tank gun which appeared in service from February 1943. The Cromwell tank was to use a 50-calibre long 75mm &quot;High Velocity&quot; gun. When these programmes were delayed, a stop-gap solution was found. The 17-pounder could through modifications be fitted to a Sherman, and orders for this Sherman Firefly were placed in 1943. By the time of the Normandy invasion, 340 Sherman Fireflies were available to the Commonwealth armoured divisions. The British lobbied for American production lines to be modified to produce Fireflies, but these suggestions were declined by the U.S. Army, in part due to the poor performance of British tank designs in North Africa. There were also 200 interim Cruiser Mk VIII Challenger tanks (a project begun in 1942) with the 17-pounder and other improved tank-designs were under development. British and Commonwealth tank units in Normandy were initially equipped at the rate of one Firefly in a troop with three Shermans or Cromwells. This ratio increased until, by the end of the war, half of the British Shermans were Fireflies. The Comet with a gun similar to the 17-pounder had also replaced the 75 mm gun Sherman in some British units. The 17-pounder with APCBC shot was more or less equivalent in performance to the Panther&#x27;s 75 mm gun, but superior with APDS shot.

At the time, U.S. armour doctrine was dominated by the head of Army Ground Forces, Gen. Lesley McNair. An artilleryman by trade, he believed that tanks should concentrate on infantry-support and exploitation roles; leaving enemy tanks to be dealt with by the tank destroyer force, which was a mix of towed anti-tank guns and lightly armoured fighting-vehicles with open-top turrets with 3-inch (76.2 mm) (M10 tank destroyer), 76 mm (M18 Hellcat) or later, 90 mm (M36 tank destroyer) guns. This doctrine led to a lack of urgency in the U.S. Army to upgrade the armour and firepower of the M4 Sherman tank, which had previously done well against the most common German tanks – Panzer IIIs and Panzer IVs – in Africa and Italy. As with the Soviets, the German adoption of thicker armour and the 7.5 cm KwK 40 in their standard armoured-fighting-vehicles prompted the U.S. Army to develop the more powerful 76 mm version of the M4 Sherman tank in April 1944. Development of a heavier tank, the M26 Pershing, was delayed mainly by McNair&#x27;s insistence on &quot;battle need&quot; and emphasis on producing only reliable, well-tested weapons, a reflection of America&#x27;s supply line to Europe.

An AGF (Armored Ground Forces) policy statement of November 1943 concluded the following:
U.S. awareness of the inadequacies of their tanks grew only slowly. All U.S. M4 Shermans that landed in Normandy in June 1944 had the 75 mm gun. The general purpose 75 mm M4 gun could not penetrate the Panther from the front at all, although it could penetrate various parts of the Panther from the side at ranges from . The 76 mm gun could also not penetrate the front hull armour of the Panther, but could penetrate the Panther turret mantlet at very close range. In August 1944, the HVAP (high velocity armour-piercing) 76 mm round was introduced to improve the performance of the 76 mm M4 Shermans. With a tungsten core, this round could still not penetrate the Panther glacis plate, but could punch through the Panther mantlet at , instead of the usual for the normal 76 mm round. Tungsten production shortages meant that this round was always in short supply, with only a few available per tank, and some M4 Sherman units never received any.

Whereas Sherman tanks fired rounds with a high flash powder that made them easier to spot by German tankers to spot them, rounds fired by German tanks used a low flash powder, making it harder for Allied crews to spot them. Shermans, even though they were around 15 tons lighter than Panthers, had worse cross country mobility due to their narrower tracks. A U.S. corporal stated:
The 90 mm M36 tank destroyer was introduced in September 1944; the 90 mm round also proved to have difficulty penetrating the Panther&#x27;s glacis plate, and it was not until an HVAP version of the round was developed that it could effectively penetrate it from combat range. It was very effective against the Panther&#x27;s front turret and side.

The high American tank losses in the Battle of the Bulge against a force largely of Panther tanks brought about a clamour for better armour and firepower. At General Eisenhower&#x27;s request, only 76 mm gun-armed M4 Shermans were shipped to Europe for the remainder of the war. Small numbers of the M26 Pershing were also rushed into combat in late February 1945. A dramatic newsreel film was recorded by a U.S. Signal Corps cameraman of an M26 stalking and then blowing up a Panther in the city of Cologne, after the Panther had knocked out two M4 Shermans.

The production of Panther tanks and other German tanks dropped off sharply after January 1945, and eight of the Panther regiments still on the Western Front were transferred to the Eastern Front in February 1945. The result was that, for the rest of the war during 1945, the greatest threats to the tanks of the Western Allies were no longer German tanks, but infantry anti-tank weapons, such as the Panzerschreck and Panzerfaust, infantry anti-tank guns, such as the ubiquitous 7.5 cm Pak 40, and tank destroyers, such as the Marder, StuG III, StuG IV, and Jagdpanzer. A German Army status report dated 15 March 1945 showed 117 Panthers left in the entire Western Front, of which only 49 were operational.

==Further development==
===Panther II===


The early impetus for upgrading the Panther came from the concern of Hitler and others that it lacked sufficient armour. Hitler had already insisted on an increase in its armour once, early in its design process in 1942. Discussions involving Hitler in January 1943 called for further increased armour; initially referred to as Panther 2 (it became the Panther II after April 1943). This upgrade increased the thickness of the glacis plate to , the side armour to , and the top armour to . Production of the Panther 2 was slated to begin in September 1943.

On 10 February 1943, Dr. Wiebecke (chief design engineer for MAN) suggested thoroughly redesigning the Panther II and incorporating Tiger components such as the steering gears, final drive, entire suspension, and turret based on Eastern Front experience. Total weight would increase to more than 50 metric tons. Another meeting on 17 February 1943 focused on sharing and standardizing parts between the Tiger II tank and the Panther II, such as the transmission, all-steel 80 cm diameter road-wheels (only overlapping and not interleaved as the original &quot;Schachtellaufwerk&quot; road-wheel design used) and running gear. In March 1943, MAN indicated that the first prototype would be completed by August 1943. A number of engines were under consideration, among them the new Maybach HL234 fuel-injected engine (900 hp operated by an 8-speed hydraulic transmission) and the BMW 003 aviation turbojet-derived, GT 101 turboshaft powerplant, planned to be of some 1,150 shaft horsepower output and weighing only some 450 kg (992 lb) without its transmission, only some 38% of the weight of the Panther&#x27;s standard Maybach HL230 V-12 gasoline-fueled piston engine.

Thus, plans to replace the original Panther design with the Panther II were already underway before the first Panther had even seen combat. But from May to June 1943, work on the Panther II ceased as the focus was shifted to expanding production of the original Panther tank. It is not clear if there was ever an official cancellation: this may have been because the Panther II upgrade pathway was originally started at Hitler&#x27;s insistence. The direction that the design was headed would not have been consistent with Germany&#x27;s need for a mass-produced tank, which was the goal of the Reich Ministry of Armament and War Production.

One Panther II chassis was completed and eventually captured by the U.S.; it was displayed at the Patton Museum in Fort Knox until 2010. It has since been moved to the National Armor and Cavalry Museum at Ft. Benning, GA. An Ausf. G turret is mounted on this chassis.

===Ausf. F and Schmalturm turret===

After the Panther II project died, a more limited upgrade of the Panther was planned, centred around a re-designed turret. The Ausf. F variant was intended for production in April 1945, but the end of war ended these plans.

The earliest known redesign of the turret was dated 7 November 1943 and featured a narrow gun mantlet behind a thick turret front plate. Another design drawing by Rheinmetall dated 1 March 1944 reduced the width of the turret front even further; this was the &quot;Turm-Panther (Schmale Blende)&quot; (Panther with narrow gun mantlet). Several experimental &quot;Schmaltürme&quot; (literally: &quot;narrow turrets&quot;) were built in 1944 with modified versions of the production Panther&#x27;s 7.5 cm KwK 42 L/70 standard gun, which were given the designation of KwK 44/1. A few were captured and shipped back to the U.S. and Britain. One badly damaged turret is on display at the Bovington Tank Museum. It had been used as a post-war range target until its historical significance was recognised.

The &quot;Schmalturm&quot; had a much narrower front face of armour sloped at 20 degrees; side turret armour was increased to from ; roof turret armour increased to from ; and a bell shaped gun mantlet similar to that of the Tiger II was used. This increased armour protection also had a slight weight saving due to the overall smaller size of the turret. The &quot;Schmalturm&quot; also addressed an inherent flaw with the earlier rounded mantlet in which incoming shots would ricochet off the lower half of the mantlet plate and go through the hull roof or into the turret ring.

The Panther Ausf. F would have had the &quot;Schmalturm&quot;, with its better ballistic protection, and an extended front hull roof which was slightly thicker. The Ausf. F&#x27;s &quot;Schmalturm&quot; was to have a built-in stereoscopic rangefinder — using twin matching armoured blisters, one on each turret side, much like the Americans&#x27; post-war M47 Patton tank — and lower weight than the original turrets. A number of Ausf. F hulls were built at Daimler-Benz and Ruhrstahl-Hattingen steelworks; there is no evidence that any completed Ausf. F saw service before the end of the war.

===E-50===

The E series of experimental tanks — E-10, E-25, E-50, E-75, E-100 (the numbers designated their weight class) — was proposed to further streamline production with an even greater sharing of common parts and simplification of design. In this scheme, the Panther tank would have been replaced by the E-50. A Belleville washer-based, hull sidemount suspension system was proposed to replace the complex and costly dual torsion bar system. The &quot;Schmalturm&quot; would have been used, likely with a variant of the 8.8 cm L/71 gun.

=== Upgunning to the 8.8 cm ===
During the development of the Schmalturm turret, Krupp proposed an up-gunned varriant using the 8.8 cm KwK 43 L/71 and modifying the turret minimally. Several drawings were made. Krupp&#x27;s drawing Hln-130 shows that the gun was to be mounted 35 cm further forward than the 7.5 cm, with the gun carriage being 35 cm further back. This necessitated an extension to the turret. However, the gun still reduced internal space, making it harder to load. Krupp´s Hln-E142 drawing, called ´Pz.Kpfw. “Panther” mit 8.8 cm L/71 (Kw.K.43)´, dating back to November 17, 1944, shows that the 8.8 would have had depression/elevation angles of -8/15 and would have lengthened the tank to 9.25 meters long.

On January 23, 1945, a meeting was held by the Entwicklungskommission in which the project was handed over to Daimler-Benz. The turret ring of the Daimler-Benz Panther-Schmalturm-8.8 cm was enlarged by 100 mm, which increased the weight by 1 tonne. For the most part, however, the design was an 8.8 cm Kw.K.43 L/71 with repositioned trunnions in a mostly unchanged Schmalturm turret. By March 1945, Daimler-Benz was slated to produce a soft-steel prototype. At this time, Krupp returned to the project under a request from Colonel Crohn. They were given the task of developing a turret for the 8.8 cm, which was an adaption of their previous design. The design was approved on March 14, 1945, with production slated to begin in the last quarter of 1945.

=== Derived vehicles ===
* &quot;Jagdpanther&quot; – heavy &quot;Jagdpanzer&quot;-style casemate-hulled tank destroyer with the 88 mm L/71 cannon 
* &quot;Befehlspanzer&quot; Panther – command tank with additional radio equipment
* &quot;Beobachtungspanzer&quot; Panther – artillery observation tank armed with only two MG 34
* &quot;Bergepanther&quot; – armoured recovery vehicle
* &quot;Flakpanzer Coelian&quot; – self-propelled anti-aircraft gun project, planned to be armed with twin Flak 43 37 mm guns in an armoured turret

==Foreign and postwar use==

Although a technologically sophisticated vehicle, the Panther&#x27;s design had a very limited influence on postwar tank development. The French postwar AMX 50 tank prototype was indirectly influenced by it through the Entwicklung series, but never entered series production. According to Steven Zaloga, the Panther was arguably a forebear to the modern main battle tank.

The Panther itself also saw some limited use outside the German military, both before and after 1945.


During the war, the Red Army employed a number of captured Panthers. These were repainted with prominent Soviet emblems and tactical markings to avoid friendly fire incidents. Unlike captured Panzer IVs and StuGs, the Soviets generally only used Panthers and Tigers that had been captured intact and used them until they broke down, as they were too complex and difficult to transport for repair. Panzer IVs and StuGs, on the other hand, were so numerous in terms of spare parts and easy to repair that they could be used over a much longer period in combat conditions.

In July/August 1944, Hungary received at least 5 Panthers (Ausf. A or Ausf. G) which were used effectively in combat under the command of Hungarian tank ace Ervin Tarczay. They were received by the 2nd Company, 1st Battalion of the 3rd Armoured Regiment. A batch of 10-12 Panthers which were originally destined for Romania were given to Hungary in late 1944 because Romania switched sides. The Panthers took part in intense battles from early September 1944 to early 1945, fighting around the Carpathians, in the Battle of Torda and around Polgár, later making a fighting withdrawal north-west towards Budapest. The last surviving Panthers were reported to be lost in Slovakia by early 1945.

During March–April 1945, Bulgaria received 15 Panthers of various makes (D, A, and G variants) from captured and overhauled Soviet stocks; they only saw limited (training) service use. They were dug down, with automotive components removed, as pillboxes along the Bulgarian-Turkish border as early as the late 1940s. The final fate of these pillbox Panthers is unknown, but sources indicate that they were replaced and scrapped in the 1950s.

In May 1946, Romania received 13 Panther tanks from the USSR. They were initially used by the 1st Armoured Brigade, but in 1947 the equipment was ceded to the Soviet-organized &quot;Tudor Vladimirescu Division&quot;, which was transformed from a volunteer infantry division into an armoured one. The Panther tank was officially known as T-V (T-5) in the army inventory. These tanks were in poor condition and remained in service until about 1950, by which time the Romanian Army had received T-34-85 tanks. All of the tanks were scrapped by 1954. The tanks were different models: Ausf. A, Ausf. D, and Ausf. G. They were shown to the public in 1948, during the 1 May parade in Bucharest, painted with Romanian markings. Until 1950, the T-V (T-5) was the heaviest tank available to the Romanian Army.


During the Warsaw Uprising, the Polish Home Army captured and used two Panther tanks. One, nicknamed &quot;Magda&quot;, was used by Batalion Zośka&#x27;s armoured platoon under the command of Wacław Micuta to liberate the Gęsiówka concentration camp. At least one captured tank was used by the Polish People&#x27;s Army post-war.

One captured vehicle (named &quot;Cuckoo&quot;) also saw service with the British Coldstream Guards for some time.

Germany sold Japan a single Panther along with a Tiger in September 1943; by the time it was ready in 1944, it was impossible to ship due to Allied naval interdiction.

In 1946, Sweden sent a delegation to France to examine surviving specimens of German military vehicles. During their visit, the delegates found a few surviving Panthers and had one shipped to Sweden for further testing and evaluation, which continued until 1961. The tank is on display in the Deutsches Panzermuseum in Munster.

After the war, France was able to recover enough operable vehicles and components to equip the French Army&#x27;s 503e Régiment de Chars de Combat with a force of 50 Panthers from 1944 to 1952, with about a dozen remaining in use by that time. In 1947, the French War Ministry wrote an evaluation of them entitled &quot;Le Panther 1947&quot;. These remained in service despite being partially replaced by French-built ARL 44 heavy tanks.

The last production Panthers were produced at the factory just after the end of World War II, using available components, by German staff under the supervision of the Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers (REME). Nine Panthers and twelve Jagdpanthers were produced and shipped back to Britain for post-war trials. A complete Panther and a complete Jagdpanther from that production batch are now at the Bovington Tank Museum in Dorset.

* Deutsches Panzermuseum, Munster, Germany. Ausf. A command tank (the original engine replaced with a Daimler-Benz MB 837 Aa-500 from a Kanonenjagdpanzer)
* Wehrtechnische Studiensammlung, Koblenz, Germany. Ausf. G. Completed after the war in the Panther factory under supervision by UK REME engineers, used for tests
* Kubinka Tank Museum, Russia. Ausf. G
* The Australian Armour and Artillery Museum, Australia. Ausf. A (restored to working order in 2020, previously owned by Rex &amp; Rod Cadman Collection in the UK)

;More or less intact, but not in working order

* Canadian War Museum. In January 2008 a partially restored Panther Ausf. A was put on display. It had been donated to the museum from CFB Borden, which acquired it following V-E celebrations in May 1945. Spent two years in restoration prior to being put on display.
* Panzermuseum Thun, Thun, Switzerland. Advertised as variant D/G hybrid, with an Ausf. D hull and Ausf. G turret. There are many questions surrounding this vehicle. The turret has a replacement sheet metal mantlet, vaguely resembling a late Ausf. G mantlet, with no ports for gunners sight or coaxial machine gun. The pistol port on the turret rear indicates an Ausf. A or early Ausf. G. The hull with the &quot;letterbox&quot; machine gun slot indicates an Ausf. D or early Ausf. A. The turret and hull numbers could help identify the correct model designation for the hybrid but neither of the numbers were made public.
* The Wheatcroft Collection, United Kingdom. Four Panthers in the collection, all four are simultaneously being restored with most of the work beginning in 2025. Early Ausf. A (DEMAG production)
* Liberty Park, National War and Resistance Museum, Overloon, Netherlands. Ausf. G. This tank was abandoned by its crew during the Battle of Overloon after being knocked out by a PIAT projectile, with its two running wheels on the right side being hit and its crew killed when they abandoned the tank.

* U.S. Army Armor &amp; Cavalry Museum, Fort Moore, USA. Four Panthers in the collection: Ausf. A; Ausf. G; late Ausf. G; Panther II hull (with late Ausf. G turret added as placeholder after the war).
* Private collector, Heikendorf, Germany. An almost intact Panther Ausf. G was found In July 2015 in the basement of a private residence near Kiel, seized by the police and later transported away by the Bundeswehr. In August 2021 a court in Kiel found the tank no longer to be useable as a weapon of war and ordered the defendant to sell it within 2 years to a suitable institution in exchange for a conditional discharge.
* , Breda, Netherlands. The only known complete surviving Ausf. D. This tank was donated by the Polish 1st Armoured Division after liberation of Breda. It was restored in 2004–2005 for static display by Kevin Wheatcroft in exchange for its parts.

<text>Frauen-Liebe und Leben (&quot;A Woman&#x27;s Love and Life&quot;) is a cycle of poems by Adelbert von Chamisso, written in 1830. They describe the course of a woman&#x27;s love for her man, from her point of view, from first meeting through marriage to his death, and after. Selections were set to music as a song-cycle by masters of German Lied, namely Carl Loewe (1836), Franz Lachner (c1839), and Robert Schumann (1840). The setting by Schumann (his opus 42) is now the most widely known.

==Chamisso&#x27;s poems==
There are nine lyrics in the cycle, to which Chamisso gave the title &quot;Frauen-Liebe und Leben&quot;. It was first published in 1830, and twice in 1831 in the first editions of his poetry, and of his complete works.

Schumann in his cycle did not set the final stanza of No. 2 (&#x27;Er, der Herrlichste von allen&#x27;) with its sudden change of mood. He also left out the last poem, No. 9 &#x27;Traum der eignen Tage&#x27;, which is addressed to the now aged protagonist&#x27;s granddaughter (&quot;Tochter meiner Tochter&quot;). Loewe set all nine poems in full, although only the first seven were published together.

==Nomenclature==
The original published titles of the poem-cycle and the song-cycles are:
* Chamisso (1830): &quot;Frauen-Liebe und Leben&quot;
* Loewe (1836): &quot;Frauenliebe&quot;
* Lachner (c1839): &quot;Frauenliebe und -leben&quot;
* Schumann (1840): &quot;Frauenliebe und Leben&quot;

The Schumann work has been edited and published several times since 1840, and all the current reliable music publishers still use the original 1840 published title, &quot;Frauenliebe und Leben&quot;, as do a majority of secondary sources discussing Schumann&#x27;s song cycle. However, &quot;Frauenliebe und -leben&quot; has been used in a minority (approximately one third) of recently published secondary sources, and also on some LP and CD covers. This latter spelling is a &#x27;correct&#x27; style of written German using the (i.e. suspended or hanging dash in a list of things), although it does not accurately reflect the work&#x27;s published title.

==Schumann&#x27;s setting==

Schumann composed his setting &quot;Frauenliebe und Leben&quot;, Op. 42, in 1840, his &quot;year of song&quot; in which he wrote numerous lieder and three other complete song cycles: &quot;Liederkreis&quot;, Op. 24, &quot;Liederkreis&quot;, Op. 39 and &quot;Dichterliebe&quot;, Op. 48. There are eight poems in his cycle, together telling a story from the protagonist&#x27;s first meeting her love, through their marriage, to his death. They are:

#&#x27;Seit ich ihn gesehen&#x27; (&quot;Since I saw him&quot;)
#&#x27;Er, der Herrlichste von allen&#x27; (&quot;He, the noblest of all&quot;)
#&#x27;Ich kann&#x27;s nicht fassen, nicht glauben&#x27; (&quot;I cannot grasp or believe it&quot;)
#&#x27;Du Ring an meinem Finger&#x27; (&quot;You ring upon my finger&quot;)
#&#x27;Helft mir, ihr Schwestern&#x27; (&quot;Help me, sisters&quot;)
#&#x27;Süßer Freund, du blickest mich verwundert an&#x27; (&quot;Sweet friend, you gaze&quot;)
#&#x27;An meinem Herzen, an meiner Brust&#x27; (&quot;At my heart, at my breast&quot;)
#&#x27;Nun hast du mir den ersten Schmerz getan&#x27; (&quot;Now you have caused me pain for the first time&quot;)

Schumann&#x27;s choice of text was very probably inspired in part by events in his personal life. He had been courting Clara Wieck, but had failed to get her father&#x27;s permission to marry her. In 1840, after a legal battle to make such permission unnecessary, he finally married her.

The songs in this cycle are notable for the fact that the piano has a remarkable independence from the voice. Breaking away from the Schubertian ideal, Schumann has the piano contain the mood of the song in its totality. Another notable characteristic is the cycle&#x27;s circular structure, in which the last movement repeats the theme of the first.

The composer&#x27;s initial MS sketches, dated 11 July 1840, are still extant. They mostly outline the voice part on single staves, with just a few bars of piano postlude at the very end of No. 8.

=== Recordings ===
There have been many recordings of Schumann&#x27;s setting.

== Loewe&#x27;s setting ==

Carl Loewe&#x27;s &quot;Frauenliebe&quot;, for mezzo-soprano and piano, was published as his opus 60 in 1836. He called it a Liederkranz (&#x27;wreath [or garland] of songs&#x27;), rather than a Liederkreis (&#x27;song-cycle&#x27;).

Although Loewe set all nine of Chamisso&#x27;s poems in September 1836, only the first seven were published together during his lifetime. No. 9, &#x27;Traum der eignen Tage&#x27;, was published separately in 1869, and No. 8 remained in MS until 1904 when it was included in the Breitkopf &amp; Härtel complete edition of his works.

===Recordings===
*Brigitte Fassbaender, mezzo-soprano; Cord Garben, piano (DGG DG 423 680-2)
*Callista Huffman, mezzo-soprano; Giorgi Latsabidze, piano (USC NCH 511-10)

== Lachner&#x27;s setting ==

Franz Lachner (1803–1890) made a setting entitled &quot;Frauenliebe und -leben&quot; for soprano, horn (or cello) and piano as his Op. 59 (c1839); he made another arrangement for soprano, clarinet and piano, published in 1847 as his Op. 82.

Like Schubert&#x27;s &quot;Auf dem Strom&quot;, D. 943, it is part of the small repertoire of solo vocal music ensemble with horn. Lachner&#x27;s youngest brother, Vincenz Lachner, wrote a song &#x27;Waldhornruf&#x27; (Hunting horn call&#x27;) for tenor, horn and piano.

===Recordings===
*Evelyn Tubb (soprano), Lesley Schatzberger (clarinet), Richard Burnett (fortepiano) – Classicprint CPV005CD.
*Aríon Trio (Andrea Weigt, soprano; Stefan Henke, horn; Rainer Gepp, piano), Antes Edition BM CD 31.9120.

<text>Samuel Eli Cornish (1795 – November 6, 1858) was an American Presbyterian minister, abolitionist, publisher, and journalist. He was a leader in New York City&#x27;s small free black community, where he organized the first congregation of black Presbyterians in New York. In 1827 he became one of two editors of the newly founded &quot;Freedom&#x27;s Journal&quot;, the first black newspaper in the United States. In 1833 he was a founding member of the interracial American Anti-Slavery Society.

==Biography==

===Early life and education===
Cornish was born in Sussex County, Delaware, in 1795, to free parents of mixed race. As a young man, in 1815 he moved to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, which had a large community of free blacks. After moving to New York City in 1856, Cornish organized the first congregation of black Presbyterians in the city.

===Career===
When Cornish was ordained in 1822, his parish was officially established as the New Demeter Street Presbyterian Church, making it the first black Presbyterian Church in New York City. He later ministered at the First African Presbyterian Church in Philadelphia, and Emmanuel Church in New York City. Cornish held high-ranking positions within the American Bible Society and the American Missionary Association, founded in 1846. He was one of the four founding black members; there were a total of 12 founders.

In March 1827 he became one of two editors of &quot;Freedom&#x27;s Journal&quot;, the first black newspaper in the United States. The other editor was John Russwurm. It was intended to serve the 300,000 free blacks in the country and especially New York&#x27;s community, as well as to offset the racist commentary of local papers in the city. Cornish left the paper in September 1827, likely due to pressure from Presbyterian colleagues Samuel Miller and Archibald Alexander over attacks against the American Colonization Society by Russwurm in the paper.

During the two years Russwurm was in sole charge of &quot;Freedom&#x27;s Journal&quot;, he reversed his position on colonization and lost many readers. He emigrated to Liberia in 1829. Cornish returned to the paper and tried to revive it, changing the name to &quot;The Rights of All,&quot; but the paper folded in less than a year. Cornish later was editor for the &quot;Weekly Advocate&quot;, later renamed the &quot;Colored American&quot;, from 1837 to 1839. The paper was owned by Philip Alexander Bell.

In 1833 Cornish was one of the founding members of the American Anti-Slavery Society, whose membership and leaders were interracial. He was active with them until 1840. That year, he left to join the newly formed American and Foreign Anti-Slavery Society, largely because of disputes with William Lloyd Garrison over religion in the Abolitionist movement. Cornish used his position as a journalist and editor to inform the public on the issues involving abolitionism.

=== Personal life ===
Samuel Cornish married Jane Livingston in 1824 in New York City, where he lived most of his life. The couple had four children.

Cornish died on November 6, 1858, in Brooklyn, New York. He was 63 years old.

<text>The Soo Locks (sometimes spelled Sault Locks but pronounced &quot;soo&quot;) are a set of parallel locks, operated and maintained by the United States Army Corps of Engineers, Detroit District, that enable ships to travel between Lake Superior and the lower Great Lakes. They are located on the St. Marys River between Lake Superior and Lake Huron, between the Upper Peninsula of the U.S. state of Michigan and the Canadian province of Ontario. They bypass the rapids of the river, where the water falls . The locks pass an average of 10,000 ships per year, despite being closed during the winter from January through March, when ice shuts down shipping on the Great Lakes. The winter closure period is used to inspect and maintain the locks.

The locks share a name (usually shortened and anglicized as &quot;Soo&quot;) with the two cities named Sault Ste. Marie, in Ontario and in Michigan, located on either side of the St. Marys River. The Sault Ste. Marie International Bridge between the United States and Canada permits vehicular traffic to pass over the locks. A railroad bridge crosses the St. Marys River just upstream of the highway bridge.

The first locks were opened in 1855. Along with the Erie Canal, constructed in 1824 in central New York State, they were among the great infrastructure engineering projects of the antebellum United States. The Soo Locks were designated a National Historic Landmark in 1966.

==United States locks==
The U.S. locks form part of a canal formally named the St. Marys Falls Canal. The entire canal, including the locks, is owned and maintained by the United States Army Corps of Engineers, which provides free passage. The first iteration of the U.S. Soo Locks was completed in May 1855; it was operated by the state of Michigan until transferred to the U.S. Army in 1881.

===Locks===
The configuration consists of two parallel lock chambers.Starting at the Michigan shoreline and moving north toward Ontario, these are:

*The MacArthur Lock, built in 1943. It is long, wide, and deep. This is large enough to handle ocean-going vessels (&quot;salties&quot;) that must also pass through the smaller locks in the Welland Canal. The first vessel through was the SS &quot;Carl D. Bradley&quot;. Per 33 CFR § 207.440 (v), &quot;The maximum overall dimensions of vessels that will be permitted to transit MacArthur Lock are 730 feet in length and 75 feet in width, except as provided in paragraph (v)(1) of this section.&quot; Per U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Sault St Marie, the length of the ship is restricted to 730’ due to the southwest wall alignment entering and exiting the MacArthur Lock.

*The Poe Lock, built in 1896. The first vessel to pass through was the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers tug USS &quot;Hancock&quot;. The original Poe Lock was engineered by Orlando Poe and, at long and wide, was the largest in the world when completed in 1896. The lock was re-built in 1968 to accommodate larger ships, after the Saint Lawrence Seaway opened and made passage of such ships possible to the Great Lakes. It is now long, wide, and deep. It can take ships carrying of cargo. The Poe is the only lock that can handle the large lake freighters used on the Upper Lakes. The first passage after the rebuild was by the &quot;Phillip R. Clarke&quot; in 1969.

===Former locks===
*The State Lock, built between 1853 and 1855. The State of Michigan was given land by the federal government to construct a lock to allow for quicker transit of new copper and iron ore deposits discovered around the Lake Superior basin. The lock consisted of two chambers back-to-back to bridge the difference in water level. The each chamber ws long, wide at the top of its walls and at its bottom, and deep. The State Lock was replaced by the original Poe Lock in 1896.
*The Weitzel Lock, was built between 1873 and 1881 directly south of the State Lock, and was the first lock to be operated by the federal government. At long, wide, and deep, it was the longest lock in the world upon its completion. It was decommissioned in 1919, and was eventually replaced by the MacArthur Lock in 1943.
*The Davis Lock, built in 1914. At the time of its completion, the Davis Lock was the longest lock in the world at long, and was also wide and deep. It was officially decommissioned in 2010.
*The Sabin Lock, built in 1919. It was constructed as a twin lock to the Davis Lock, and named after Louis Sabin, who served as the Detroit District Engineer. It was officially decommissioned in 2010 at the same time as the Davis Lock.

===New lock===

A new lock is under construction and is slated to be completed by 2030. Groundbreaking for the new lock project was held on June 30, 2009. The lock will be equal in size to the Poe Lock and will provide much needed additional capacity for the large lake freighters. The new lock replaces two locks (Davis Lock and Sabin Lock), which were obsolete and used infrequently. In May 2020, construction on Phase One of the replacement of the Sabin Lock was started.

North of the new lock is an additional channel with a small hydroelectric plant, which provides electricity for the lock complex.

===Engineers Day===
The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Detroit District, operates the Soo Locks Visitors Center and viewing deck for the public. On the last Friday of every June, the public is allowed to go behind the security fence and cross the lock gates of the U.S. Soo Locks for the annual Engineers Day Open House. During this event, visitors are able to get close enough to touch ships passing through the two regularly operating locks. Other than on that day, because the locks are United States Federal property under command of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, unauthorized personnel and civilians are restricted from the locks under threat of fines or imprisonment for trespassing.

==Canadian lock==
The first lock to be built in the St. Marys River was on the Canadian side in 1798 by the Northwest Fur Company to facilitate the fur trade. It was destroyed by the Americans in 1814 during the War of 1812 to disrupt British trade. Currently, a single small lock is operated on the Canadian side of the Soo. Opened in 1895, it was rebuilt in 1987, and is long, wide and deep. The Canadian lock is used for recreational and tour boats; major shipping traffic uses the U.S. locks.

<text>John Ashford Renshaw Starr (6 August 1908 – 1996), code names Emile and Bob, was a British artist and an agent in France of the United Kingdom&#x27;s clandestine Special Operations Executive (SOE) organization during World War II. He was the organiser (leader) of the Acrobat network (or circuit) which operated in Dijon. The purpose of SOE in occupied France was to conduct espionage, sabotage and reconnaissance. SOE agents allied themselves with French Resistance groups and supplied them with weapons and equipment parachuted in from England.

Starr was wounded and captured by the German SS on 18 July 1943 and imprisoned for the remainder of the war. After World War II, Starr was accused by several other SOE agents of collaboration with the Germans while he was a captive. John Starr&#x27;s brother George Starr was also an SOE agent.

== Early life ==
Starr was born in Heaton Moor, Lancashire, the son of an American father, Alfred Demarest Starr, a bookkeeper who became a naturalised British subject, and an English mother, Ethel Renshaw, he was a grandson of William Robert Renshaw. He studied art in Paris and in 1934 he married a French woman, Michelle Vergetas, and the couple had one child, Ethel. Starr tried to join the Royal Air Force in 1938 but was rejected because his father was an American. He was in Paris when World War II began in 1939, and in early 1940 joined the King&#x27;s Own Scottish Borderers and later was assigned to the Field Security Police. He escaped to England when France was overrun by Nazi Germany. He joined the SOE in early 1941.

==Special Operations Executive==
===First Mission===
Starr parachuted &quot;blind&quot; (without being met on the ground) near Valence on the night of 27–28 August 1942. His job was to evaluate the food requirements for the CARTE network, a resistance group which claimed that, with SOE support, it could raise an army of 300,000 men to resist the German occupation of France. Starr made his way from Valence to a villa in Cannes where he met SOE agent Peter Churchill and CARTE leader Andre Girard. Starr learned from Churchill and his own experience that CARTE was largely a fantasy of Girard&#x27;s. He returned to England in November. Oddly enough, as he was boarding a small boat to slip out of France, he encountered his older brother George who was arriving in France as an SOE agent.

===Second Mission===

Starr was held in high regard by SOE and, along with a wireless operator, John Young, he parachuted into France again on the night of 15–16 May 1943, landing near Blye in the French Alps. He was designated as the organiser (leader) of the Acrobat network, operating around Saint-Étienne and Dijon. Shortly after his arrival, Starr narrowly escaped being captured in Clermont-Ferrand. The Germans had penetrated several SOE networks and captured agents in that area. Starr was joined in Acrobat by saboteur Harry Rée and courier Diana Rowden. Rée soon departed for another network. He did not like Starr&#x27;s &quot;assertive manner&quot; and believed the network was insecure.

===Capture and collaboration===
On 18 July 1943 Starr was captured by the Germans after being betrayed by a Frenchman he had recruited. He attempted to escape en route to a prison in Dijon and was shot twice in the thigh and foot. He was placed in the custody of the Sicherheitsdienst (or SD), the intelligence service of the SS. In Dijon, he said the Germans tortured him by beating on his wounded thigh but he didn&#x27;t reveal any significant information to them. He was transferred to Fresnes Prison in Paris and in late September to SD headquarters at 84 Avenue Foch in Paris.

The head of the Paris SD was an ex-policemen named Hans Kieffer, a man more dedicated to persuasion than torture. Kieffer persuaded Starr to use his artistic talents to redraw a map and some charts of SOE operations in France. In return, Starr was given a private room in the building and dined in the officer&#x27;s mess which served excellent food. Another SOE prisoner at 84 Avenue Foch was Gilbert Norman who told Starr that the Germans knew everything about SOE and that nothing he said would be news to them. Starr justified his cooperation with the SD by saying he was gathering information on SD operations that would be useful to SOE if he could escape. Along with SOE wireless operator, Noor Inyat Khan, and a French colonel, Leon Faye, he tried to escape in late 1943 by climbing out the skylight of his room onto the roof of the building, but the three were soon recaptured. Kieffer threatened to shoot them, but relented on condition that they gave their word of honor not to attempt another escape. Khan and Faye declined; but Starr gave his word. Khan and Faye were sent to concentration camps in Germany and later executed.

After the escape attempt, Starr again became friendly with the Germans, even going out to restaurants with some of them and on an operation to identify the bodies of British airmen who had been shot down near Paris. He helped the SD send bogus wireless messages by correcting spelling and editing mistakes. The Germans he worked with later described him as &quot;weak and misguided rather than knowingly treacherous.&quot;

===A German concentration camp===
Starr remained at Avenue Foch until August 1944 when, after the Normandy Invasion and with allied armies approaching Paris, he was transported to the concentration camp at Sachsenhausen near Berlin. According to his account he avoided execution in 1945 due to a quarantine resulting from a typhus outbreak within the camp. The opportunity arose to smuggle himself into a group of prisoners who were being transferred to the Mauthausen concentration camp near Linz. By using his ability to pass himself off as a Frenchman, he joined a group of French and Belgian prisoners who were released into the custody of the Red Cross and taken to Switzerland as the war in Europe drew to a close.

==Post World War II==
Starr testified at the war crimes trial of Josef Kieffer. He said that Kieffer had not mistreated prisoners and that he did not believe that Kieffer would &quot;take part in the deliberate murder of British prisoners.&quot; Kieffer was found guilty and hanged.

Stories from other SOE agents who shared his captivity at Avenue Foch resulted in doubts being raised about Starr&#x27;s loyalty, and his case became the subject of an MI5 investigation, which concluded that although his behaviour was suspicious, there were no grounds for criminal prosecution. After the war, Starr opened a night-club in Hanley, Staffordshire, with Alfred and Henry Newton, SOE agents (and brothers) whom he had met during his training and also at the Avenue Foch. The brothers had been at Buchenwald concentration camp. Starr later returned to live in Paris, then moved to Switzerland where he died in 1996.

<doc id="367990" wikidata="Q3101929" url="?curid=367990" title="George Reginald Starr">
<text>Lieutenant-Colonel George Reginald Starr (6 April 1904 – 2 September 1980), code name Hilaire, was a British mining engineer and an agent of the United Kingdom&#x27;s clandestine Special Operations Executive (SOE) organisation in World War II. He was the organiser (leader) of the Wheelwright network in southwestern France from November 1942 until the liberation of France from Nazi German occupation in September 1944. The purpose of SOE was to conduct espionage, sabotage and reconnaissance in occupied Europe against the Axis powers. SOE agents in France allied themselves with French Resistance groups and supplied them with weapons and equipment parachuted in from England. 

Starr&#x27;s accomplishments include building up a large network of resistance groups, carrying out a number of sabotage operations in the months leading up to the Normandy invasion on 6 June 1944, rescuing from imprisonment about 50 important resistance leaders and allied airmen shot down over France, and participation as a leader in the liberation of southwestern France from German occupation. By mid-1944 Starr had more than 20 SOE agents working for him, second in numbers only to the earlier (and defunct) Prosper or Physician network. 

In the estimation of M.R.D. Foot, the official historian of the SOE, Starr was one of the half-dozen best agents of the SOE in France. He was one of only three SOE agents to be promoted to the rank of Lt. Colonel, along with Richard Heslop and Francis Cammaerts. One of the French agents of the SOE, Philippe de Gunzbourg, compared Starr as a leader to Lawrence of Arabia. Starr&#x27;s wartime record was not, however, without controversy. He had a confrontation with Charles de Gaulle after the liberation of France, and one of his agents, Anne-Marie Walters, accused him of permitting the torture of captured collaborators. 

Starr&#x27;s brother, John Renshaw Starr, was also an SOE agent.

==Early life==
He was born in London on 6 April 1904, one of two sons of Alfred Demarest Starr, an American bookkeeper who became a naturalised British subject, and Englishwoman Ethel Renshaw. He was a grandson of William Robert Renshaw. He was educated at Ardingly College, and at the age of 16, undertook a four-year apprenticeship as a coal-miner in Shropshire. After studying mining engineering at the Royal School of Mines, Imperial College London, he joined the Glasgow firm of Mather and Coulson Ltd, manufacturers of mining equipment. He worked in several countries in Europe installing mine equipment. Starr&#x27;s second wife, Pilar Canudas Ristol, who he met in Spain, worked in Spain for SOE during World War II.

Starr was described by his wireless operator, Yvonne Cormeau, as short in stature, five feet six inches in height, very nervous, a heavy cigarette smoker, and a man who took duty and responsibility seriously and would never ask a person to do anything he would not do himself. Cormeau was his closest associate, &quot;confidante and, a few alleged, his lover.&quot;
==World War II==
===Building a network===
Starr was working in Liège Province, Belgium in 1940 when the German invasion began. He escaped back to England with British forces in the Dunkirk evacuation. He joined the British Army, being commissioned on the General List. He was subsequently recruited into the Special Operations Executive (SOE) for his language skills (although his spoken French was described as &quot;atrocious&quot;) and given the code name &quot;Hilaire&quot;. 

On 3 November 1942 Starr arrived by boat with several other SOE agents at Port Miou on the Mediterranean coast of Vichy France. A few days later the Germans occupied Vichy which made SOE operations there much more dangerous than previously. Starr was scheduled to go to Lyon to work there, but the Lyon SOE network was penetrated in October 1942 and the agents arrested. SOE agent Henri Sevenet persuaded Starr to go instead to the Gascony region in southwestern France where a resistance movement was forming. His instincts were correct. SOE networks were more secure in rural areas which had a much smaller presence of German soldiers and milice, the pro-German French militia, than large urban areas.

Starr based himself in Castelnau-sur-l&#x27;Auvignon, a rural village of 300 persons, without running water or electricity. Local leaders were sympathetic to the resistance and the nearest Germans to the village were in the city of Agen, distant. Starr posed as a retired Belgian mining engineer who had made a fortune in the Congo. From Castelnau, Starr began to build up a local resistance movement, called by SOE the Wheelwright Network (or Circuit). Starr was very conscious of security, communicating with his contacts only through couriers or the spoken word, never putting words to paper, and building up his network one trusted associate at a time. In January 1943, the SOE in London parachuted weapons and explosives into Castelnau. They were hidden in a medieval dungeon beneath the church in the village. Starr&#x27;s ability to call on the United Kingdom to provide weapons made him a power among the nascent rural resistance organisations called maquis (whose members were called maquisards). Also, in January 1943, Starr borrowed a wireless operator from another network to facilitate communication with SOE in London.

These initial successes aside, in spring 1943, seemingly forgotten by SOE headquarters in London, Starr was suffering from a skin disease probably caused by stress and contemplating failure and the abandonment of his mission. He sent Denise Bloch, an SOE agent on the run from another part of France, to Spain and hence to England with a written report (violating his own rule against written communication) requesting money and a wireless operator of his own. London&#x27;s immediate answer was to send an aeroplane to hover over Castelnau to communicate with Starr by short-range S-Phone to determine that he was still alive. Starr affirmed his existence by greeting the pilot with a string of expletives and finally got attention from London. It was soon &quot;raining containers&quot; full of arms and equipment for the maquis. Starr&#x27;s SOE team would expand to include explosives expert Claude Arnault, wireless operator Yvonne Cormeau, and courier Anne-Marie Walters.

All did not go smoothly, however, in the fractious world of the French Resistance. Starr had setbacks, rivals and enemies, some of whom he managed to marginalise. The Germans arrested several of his trusted associates. Starr was accused of being a &quot;warlord,&quot; a law unto himself, and independent of the French Resistance to the German occupation.

===Security===
M.R.D Foot said that the motto of every successful secret agent was &quot;dubito, ergo sum&quot; (&quot;I doubt, therefore I survive.&quot;), and Starr is on a short list of agents who survived by paying careful attention to security. Starr&#x27;s caution extended to the people he worked with. On the boat which brought him to France in 1942 he complained about being &quot;in charge of three bloody women,&quot; Marie-Thérèse Le Chêne, Mary Katherine Herbert, and Odette Sansom, all SOE agents. He took a special dislike to Sansom, who would become one of the most honoured SOE agents. In December 1942, he was suspicious of another SOE agent, Denise Bloch, who was fleeing from the Gestapo. He initially thought her to be a nuisance and contemplated her &quot;liquidation,&quot; but learned to trust her, sending her back to the United Kingdom with an appeal for SOE assistance to his network. Starr also broke with Henri Sevenet, the Frenchman who had brought him to southwestern France and helped him become established. Among his complaints about his courier, Anne-Marie Walters, was that she wore &quot;high Paris fashion,&quot; thus violating his principle of being inconspicuous.

===Sabotage===
The maquisards and their leaders wanted to begin harassing Germans as resistance forces were doing elsewhere in France. In December 1943 Starr requested and received permission from SOE headquarters to begin attacking the Gestapo and railroads in his region. On New Year&#x27;s Eve 1943, Starr reported that the maquisards he had trained had destroyed more than 300 locomotives by carefully placing explosives on the engines. 

The National Gunpowder Factory near the city of Toulouse was a high priority for destruction by the allies. However, a daylight bombing raid by the Royal Air Force would kill many of the 6,000 French workers at the factory. London asked Starr to try to destroy the &#x27;factory as an alternative to bombing. In March 1944 Claude Arnault and Anne-Marie Walters smuggled explosives to Toulouse. On 28 March, Arnault sneaked into the plant at night, placed explosives, and destroyed 30 electric motors out of 31 in the &#x27;factory which were used to grind gunpowder. The factory was out of operation for six weeks.

In April and May 1944, the resistance carried out a number of additional sabotage operations against factories and railroads, including a factory near Lourdes which made parts for aeroplanes and armoured vehicles. Arnault repeated his earlier success by sneaking into the factory at night along with three other men and destroying machinery with explosives. 

Sabotage successes notwithstanding, the French resistance was impatient in the early months of 1944. The French were beginning to lose confidence that the allies would ever invade France and liberate the country from German occupation. The joke circulated that &quot;the English will fight to the last Frenchman.&quot;

===Battle of Castelnau===

With the Normandy Invasion on 6 June 1944, the SOE wanted the maquisards to convert from being saboteurs to armed fighters directly contesting German forces. Starr began distributing arms to resistance groups. Starr collected 300 men, one-half French and one-half Spanish, at Castelnau sur l&#x27;Auvignon and prepared to begin an armed uprising against the Germans. The Spaniards in Starr&#x27;s forces were former members of the Spanish Republican Army who had fled to France after their defeat in the Spanish Civil War. Many of them were communists. Starr was one of only a few SOE agents who was able to persuade the feuding communists and non-communists to join together to form a single resistance force. 

However, the Germans learned that Castelnau was Starr&#x27;s base and on 21 June an estimated 1,500 soldiers of the German army attacked. Nineteen of the maquisards were killed and the Germans captured the village. A rear guard blew up the explosives left behind during the retreat, destroying most of the village. The Germans completed the destruction. Starr and his surviving maquisards retreated all the way to the hamlet of Lannemaignan, west of Castelnau. Another eleven maquisards died during the retreat. On 2 July, the Germans attacked Lannemaignan with artillery and bombers. Still on the run, Starr led the maquisards south to the town of Panjas where he joined forces with his friend, the French resistance leader Maurice Parisot. Starr&#x27;s men became part of the Armagnac Battalion with Parisot as the commander. Starr became his adviser.

===Armagnac Battalion===
The Armagnac Battalion was a polyglot collection of 1,900 men of a dozen different nationalities who came together in June 1944 after the Normandy landings. After the battle of Castelnau and other conflict, the men of the various resistance groups making up the battalion, including Starr&#x27;s, were short of ammunition. Starr was ordered by SOE headquarters to attack German army units, but his pleas for air-drops of ammunition were ignored. Angered, he sent a wireless message to London saying, &quot;I have given orders to the men under my command to manufacture bows and arrows. As soon as this is completed, we will attack and destroy these fucking divisions.&quot; The message got London&#x27;s attention and ammunition supplies began arriving.

The battalion fought a battle with units of the German Das Reich Division at Estang on 2 July, but was forced to abandon its positions by German bombing. On 14 July, 4,000 Germans were advancing on the Armagnac Battalion but, inexplicably, withdrew toward Toulouse. On 12 August, the Armagnacs liberated the village of Aire-sur-l&#x27;Adour with little loss and on 20–21 August surrounded and accepted the surrender of 192 Germans, including two colonels, at L&#x27;Isle-Jourdain, only from Toulouse, the largest city in the region, the objective of the Armagnacs, and the stronghold of the remnants of the German army in the region. Starr, long accustomed to the shadows of the war, now donned his British uniform and led columns of men. 

On 21 August, Toulouse fell to the French Forces of the Interior, the umbrella organisation of resistance fighters. Starr and Yvonne Cormeau drove into the city, American and British flags on their car. The liberation of southwestern France was complete. However, the leader of the Armagnac Battalion, Maurice Parisot, was killed on 6 September; while an American aeroplane was landing, a propeller broke away from the motor and struck him.

===Starr and De Gaulle===
The withdrawal of the Germans from southwestern France left the area in political chaos in which &quot;feudal barons,&quot; of whom Starr was among the most important, took control. On 16 September 1944, General Charles de Gaulle, head of the Provisional Government of the French Republic, visited Toulouse. De Gaulle had little respect for the Resistance which had varying philosophies among its different groups of how France should be governed post-war. On meeting Starr and other resistance leaders, De Gaulle denounced them as mercenaries. He ordered Starr to leave France. Starr replied that he was in France under the authority of the allies and he did not recognise De Gaulle as his superior officer. De Gaulle threatened to arrest him but Starr stood his ground, and the meeting ended with a handshake. Nine days later, on 25 September, Starr and his wireless operator, Yvonne Cormeau, made a hasty departure from France.

De Gaulle&#x27;s reaction to Starr and the resistance fighters reflected De Gaulle&#x27;s &quot;obsession with restoring the authority of the state and allowing no challenges to its – to his – authority.&quot;

===Allegations of torture===

In late July 1944, Starr ordered his youthful courier, Anne-Marie Walters, to leave France accusing her of disobedience. When Walters returned to London, she said that Starr had countenanced torture of French collaborators with the Germans. On 1 November 1944, Starr, who had returned to London, was interviewed by SOE. He recounted &quot;with relish&quot; an incident of torture, causing consternation in the SOE although the interviewers said that he could not be blamed for the tortures committed by the French Resistance. In February 1945, a court of enquiry with testimony from Starr, Walters, and others took place. The part of the transcript of the enquiry containing Walter&#x27;s testimony has disappeared from the record. On 28 February, the conclusion of the &quot;rather perfunctory court of enquiry&quot; (in the words of M.R.D. Foot), was that &quot;there is no justification whatever for any imputation against Lt. Col. Starr of inhumanity or cruel treatment to any prisoner at any time under his control or under the control or troops or resistance forces under his immediate command or control.&quot;

==Post-war==
After the war, Starr was sent to Essen in the Ruhr district to direct the re-opening of German coal mines. He later returned to his previous employer, Mather and Coulson, as managing director before retiring to live in France. 

Starr died in a hospital in Senlis, France on 2 September 1980.

<text>The Royal Logistic Corps provides logistic support functions to the British Army. It is the largest Corps in the Army.

==History==

The Royal Logistic Corps (RLC) was formed on 5 April 1993, by the union of five British Army corps:

* Royal Engineers Postal and Courier Service
* Royal Corps of Transport
* Royal Army Ordnance Corps
* Royal Pioneer Corps
* Army Catering Corps

The RLC comprises both Regular and Army Reserve units.

The RLC is the only combat service support corps of the British Army with battle honours, derived from the usage of previous transport elements of the Royal Waggon Train, and their successors as cavalry. The battle honours are:

* Peninsula
* Battle of Waterloo
* Lucknow
* Taku Forts
* Peking

==Cap badge==
The RLC cap badge is an amalgamation of the cap badges of the forming corps:

* The laurel and garter band is from the Royal Engineers
* The Indian star is from the Royal Corps of Transport
* The shield in the centre is from the Royal Army Ordnance Corps
* The crossed axes are from the Royal Pioneer Corps
* The motto, &quot;We Sustain&quot;, is from the Army Catering Corps

The inscription on the garter band &quot;Honi soit qui mal y pense&quot; can be translated as &quot;Shame on anyone who thinks evil of it&quot;. It is the motto of the Order of the Garter.

==Headquarters==
The Corps Headquarters is at Worthy Down Camp near Winchester. It is headed by a Colonel (Colonel RLC) as the professional head of the Corps. Col RLC is responsible for the Moral Component, regimental infrastructure and support and works to Commander Home Command. Col RLC remains responsible for the Corps of Drums, which often parades with the RLC Band.
(AG).

The RLC Band was formed in 1993. It provides musical support while also representing the Royal Logistic Corps, and on occasion, the wider British Army. They are able to produce no more than 12 working ensembles at a time. These include a marching band, big band, fanfare team, and acoustic groups.

===Museum===
The Royal Logistic Corps Museum was based at Princess Royal Barracks, Deepcut near Camberley in Surrey, but was closed prior to a move to Worthy Down near Winchester, where it re-opened in May 2021.

==List of units==
===Regiments===
===Specialist sub-units===
*Commando Logistic Support Squadron RLC – part of the Commando Logistic Regiment

==Master General of Logistics==
There is also a ceremonial head (instituted in 2009), who heads the Corps and its wider family such as the Associations and Cadets, known as the Master General of Logistics (MGL). Holders of the post include:

*General Sir Kevin O&#x27;Donoghue (2009–2012)
*Lieutenant General Sir Mark Poffley (2012–2021)
*Major General Simon T. Hutchings (2021–2024)

<doc id="368017" wikidata="Q1345855" url="?curid=368017" title="Tom Campbell (California politician)">
<text>Thomas John Campbell (born August 14, 1952) is an American academic, educator, and politician. He is a professor of law at the Dale E. Fowler School of Law, and a professor of economics at the George Argyros School of Business and Economics, at Chapman University, in Orange, California.

He was Dean of Chapman University School of Law from 2011 to 2016, Director of Finance for the State of California from 2004 to 2005, a former five-term Republican United States Congressman from California&#x27;s 12th and 15th districts, a former member of the California State Senate, a former professor at Stanford Law School, former dean of the Haas School of Business, and former professor of business administration at the University of California, Berkeley.

In 2000, he retired from his House seat to run for the U.S. Senate but lost decisively to incumbent Dianne Feinstein. On June 8, 2010, he lost his third bid for the United States Senate, campaigning once again for the seat held by Democrat Barbara Boxer but losing the Republican nomination to Carly Fiorina.

Campbell is a member of the ReFormers Caucus of Issue One.

==Early life==
Born in Chicago, Campbell was the valedictorian of Chicago&#x27;s St. Ignatius College Prep, Class of 1969. He went on to obtain his B.A. and M.A. degrees from the University of Chicago (1973), a J.D. from Harvard Law School (1976) and then a subsequent Ph.D. in economics from the University of Chicago (1980). He served as a clerk to U.S. Supreme Court Justice Byron White from 1977 to 1978 and, the year before that, for U.S. Court of Appeals Judge George E. MacKinnon. His mentor was Milton Friedman. Tom Campbell&#x27;s father was the late Hon. William Joseph Campbell, a former Chief Judge of the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois. While Tom Campbell was raised in a Democratic family, he joined the Republican Party in 1980.

Campbell was admitted to the Illinois bar in 1976 and went into private practice in Chicago. He was a White House Fellow in the offices of the Chief of Staff and Counsel (1980–1981). He then served in the Reagan Administration as Director of the Bureau of Competition in the Federal Trade Commission from 1981 to 1983, the youngest person ever to serve in that position.

==Law professor==
Campbell became a law professor at Stanford Law School in 1983, receiving tenure as a full professor in 1987.

==Congressional and State Senate career==

Campbell ran for the Republican nomination in California&#x27;s 12th Congressional District, which included his home in Campbell and the campus of Stanford University. The 12th had traditionally been a moderate Republican bastion, but had grown increasingly friendly to Democrats over the years. Campbell soundly defeated first-term incumbent Ernie Konnyu in the Republican primary and narrowly defeated his Democratic opponent, San Mateo County Supervisor Anna Eshoo. He served two terms before making an unsuccessful bid for the Republican nomination for the Senate seat being vacated by Alan Cranston. He lost the Republican primary to a considerably more conservative Republican, Bruce Herschensohn, who in turn was defeated by Democratic Congresswoman Barbara Boxer. His political career might have been in jeopardy in any case; his district had been renumbered as the 14th District and had been made considerably more Democratic than its predecessor. Eshoo won the seat and still holds it today; no Republican running in this district (now numbered as the 18th District) has won more than 39 percent of the vote since Campbell left office.

In 1993, California State Senator Becky Morgan stepped down mid-term, and Campbell won a special election to succeed her; the state Senate district overlapped significantly with his old congressional district. In the California state Senate, Campbell was Chairman of the Housing Committee, Vice Chairman of the Education Committee, and served on the Budget Committee. California Journal rated him the Best Problem Solver in the State Senate, the Most Ethical State Senator, and the overall Best State Senator.

In 1995, 15th District Democratic Congressman Norman Mineta, later the Secretary of Commerce under President Bill Clinton and Secretary of Transportation under George W. Bush, unexpectedly resigned. Campbell&#x27;s home had been re-drawn into this San Jose-based district, and he ran in the special election. Mineta had held the seat since 1975, and it was widely considered a safe Democratic district. Despite the considerable disadvantage in voter registration and Democratic attempts to tie him to Speaker Newt Gingrich, Campbell won the December special election easily. He won a full term almost as easily in 1996 and was handily re-elected in 1998.

During both of his stints in Congress, Campbell was regarded as one of the most moderate House Republicans. Though conservative on fiscal matters, he is socially liberal, being pro-choice on abortion and in favor of gay rights. This was not surprising, as Bay Area Republicans tend to be more moderate on social and environmental matters than their counterparts in the rest of California. He has a decided libertarian streak, and remains popular with libertarian-leaning Republicans. As a fiscal conservative, he was the only Republican in the House to vote against the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997.

Campbell led a group of 17 bipartisan members of Congress who filed a lawsuit against President Clinton in 1999 over his conduct of the war in Kosovo. In the filing, they accused Clinton of not reporting to Congress within 48 hours on the status of the action as required by the 1973 War Powers Resolution and not first obtaining a declaration of war from Congress as required in the Constitution. Congress had voted 427 to 2 against a declaration of war with Yugoslavia and had voted to deny support for the air campaign. A federal judge dismissed the lawsuit, ruling that since Congress had voted for funding after the U.S. was actively engaged in the war with Kosovo, legislators had sent a confusing message about whether they approved of the war. Campbell said afterwards that this was a sidestepping of the law, and lawmakers who disagree with a war should not be forced to cut off funding for troops who are in the midst of it in order to get a judge to order an end to it.

In 2000, Campbell won the Republican nomination to take on Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein. Although he touted his service as a moderate Republican representing a strongly Democratic district, he was considered a decided underdog. Campbell was badly defeated, losing by over 19 points. He even lost his own district by almost 15 points. Democratic State Assemblyman Mike Honda, a Mineta protege, won Campbell&#x27;s House seat by 12 points over Republican State Assemblyman Jim Cunneen, a former aide to Campbell. As of 2020, Campbell is the last elected Republican to have represented a significant portion of San Jose above the county level.

In 2008, Campbell wrote in &quot;Reason&quot; that he would be voting no on Proposition 8, the proposed ballot measure banning same-sex marriage in the state, per his Republican beliefs that &quot;government should be limited. Government has no business making distinctions between people based on their personal lives&quot;. Proposition 8 eventually passed by a margin of 52-48%.

Campbell is a supporter of the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact.

==Return to legal scholarship==

In 2000, Campbell returned to Stanford. He remained there until his appointment at the Haas School of Business at UC Berkeley in 2002. In the intervening years, he began to assemble the material, out of his professional political experiences, for his book The Separation of Powers in Practice with Stanford University Press.

As Dean of the Haas School, Campbell stressed the study of corporate social responsibility and business ethics amid an era of corporate scandals. A full-fledged Center for Responsible Business was established. In September 2004, Campbell was named by California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger to his newly formed Council of Economic Advisors. From 2004 to 2005, Campbell took a leave of absence from his Berkeley post to serve as director of the California Department of Finance in the Schwarzenegger administration.

On August 27, 2007, Campbell announced that he would step down from his position at Haas in the summer of 2008. In mid-2008, Campbell joined the Palo Alto office of Los Angeles-based Gibson, Dunn &amp; Crutcher LLP. Campbell joined the Chapman School of Law for a 2-year visiting appointment which began January 2009, serving as the Fletcher Jones Distinguished Visiting professor at Chapman University School of Law. In February 2011, Chapman announced that Campbell would be its new Dean. Campbell replaced interim Dean Scott Howe, who replaced Dean John C. Eastman, who stepped down to seek the 2010 Republican nomination for Attorney General of California (Campbell had filed paperwork to seek the 2010 Republican nomination for Governor of California the day after stepping down as Dean of Haas before going on to seek the 2010 Republican nomination for U.S. Senator from California; neither Eastman and Campbell won the Republican nomination in their respective races).

In July 2008, Tom Campbell filed the necessary paperwork in order to establish a committee with the intent to raise funds for a prospective race for the Republican nomination to be Governor of California in 2010.

On January 13, 2010, the &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; reported that Campbell would run for the United States Senate, instead of for Governor of California. Campbell&#x27;s Web Site confirmed it. In the primary on June 8, Campbell finished a distant second to former Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina, in a race that also included State Assemblyman Chuck DeVore. The primary election received national attention, in part due to a campaign ad released by Carly Fiorina, depicting Campbell as a &quot;Demon Sheep&quot;.

===2016 U.S. presidential election===
In August 2016, Campbell published an op-ed in &quot;The Mercury News&quot; calling on the Republican National Committee to replace Donald Trump as the nominee for president, and saying Campbell would withdraw from the Republican Party if that did not happen. Campbell wrote:

On Aug. 9, Trump said, &quot;If she gets to pick her judges, nothing you can do, folks. ... Although the Second Amendment people -- maybe there is, I don&#x27;t know.&quot; Trump&#x27;s campaign explained this meant Second Amendment supporters would defeat Clinton at the ballot box. That, however, is not a logical interpretation of the remark. The context was what can be done if Clinton becomes president; not what can be done to stop her from becoming president. As such, this is a statement of great recklessness, made all the more so by our present environment of violence used to advance extremism.

Trump&#x27;s words were similar to other calls he has made to ignore the rule of law. He has proposed ordering members of the U.S. military to violate American law regarding torture, assuring us that his orders, rather than the law, would be obeyed. He has encouraged physical violence by individuals against protesters at his rallies, assuring anyone doing so that he would cover their legal costs. He has threatened to use the antitrust laws against a company and an individual because the newspaper that individual owns has criticized him.

Campbell also said he could not support the Democratic nominee, Hillary Clinton, either, due to her involvement in the email controversy. Campbell officially changed his registration to independent shortly thereafter.

In 2016, Campbell wrote a column for the &quot;Orange County Register&quot;, which, while not endorsing Gary Johnson for president, suggested libertarian-leaning Republicans should consider him. Campbell was later one of 30 former Republican members of Congress who wrote an open letter denouncing Trump&#x27;s candidacy. Campbell was also included on a list of potential Supreme Court nominees issued by Libertarian Party nominee Gary Johnson. Campbell was speculated to be a possible candidate for the Libertarian nomination in 2020, but instead he endorsed former Judge Jim Gray for the nomination. Campbell proceeded to co-found the centrist Common Sense Party due to what he perceived as a want for such a party among California residents.

<doc id="368020" wikidata="Q234178" url="?curid=368020" title="Bangor, Gwynedd">
<text>Bangor (; ) is a cathedral city and community in Gwynedd, North Wales. It is the oldest city in Wales. Historically part of Caernarfonshire, the community had a population of 15,060 at the 2021 census, and the built up area had a population of 16,990. Landmarks include Bangor Cathedral, Bangor University and Garth Pier. The Britannia and Menai Suspension bridges connect the city to the Isle of Anglesey.

==History==


The origins of the city date back to the founding of a monastic establishment on the site of Bangor Cathedral by the Celtic saint Deiniol in the early 6th century AD. itself is an old Welsh word for a wattled enclosure, such as the one that originally surrounded the cathedral site. The present cathedral is a somewhat more recent building and has been extensively modified throughout the centuries. While the building itself is not the oldest, and certainly not the biggest, the bishopric of Bangor is one of the oldest in the UK.

In 973, Iago, ruler of the Kingdom of Gwynedd, was usurped by Hywel, and requested help from Edgar, King of England, to restore his position. Edgar, with an army, went to Bangor and encouraged both Iago and Hywel to share the leadership of the realm. Asserting overall control however, Edgar confirmed liberties and endowments of the Bishop of Bangor, granting land and gifts. From 1284 until the 15th century, Bangor bishops were granted several charters permitting them to hold fairs and govern the settlement, later ones also confirming them as Lord of the Manor.

Bangor remained a small settlement until the start of the 18th century. The main mail coach route from London to Dublin via Holyhead passed to the east of Bangor, crossing the Lavan Sands to reach a ferry across the Menai Strait to Beaumaris. In 1718 a sub-postmaster was appointed based in Bangor and the mail coach route was diverted to pass through Bangor on its way to the alternative Porthaethwy ferry. Being on the mail coach route considerably increased the trade passing through Bangor and encouraged its growth. Development was further spurred by slate mining at nearby Bethesda, beginning in the 1770s by Richard Pennant, becoming one of the largest slate quarries in the world. The route between London and Holyhead was much improved by Thomas Telford building the A5 road; it runs through the centre of the city and over the Menai Suspension Bridge, which was also completed to his designs in 1826. Bangor railway station opened in 1848.

Bangor&#x27;s status grew due to further industry, such as shipbuilding, as well as travel, not just from Telford&#x27;s road, but through tourism mainly from Liverpool via steamboat.

Friars School was founded as a free grammar school in 1557 and the University College of North Wales (now Bangor University) was founded in 1884. In 1877, the former became a school ship, moored on the Menai Strait at Bangor and had 260 pupils. Closed after the end of hostilities of World War I, she was sold for scrap and broken up in 1919.

In World War II, parts of the BBC evacuated to Bangor during the worst of the Blitz. The BBC continue to maintain facilities in the city (see Media).

==City status==
Bangor is the only place in Wales which continues to hold city status by ancient prescriptive right, due to its long-standing cathedral and past privileges granted. St Davids had also been a city by prescriptive right, but lost its status in the 1880s and was only formally restored to city status in 1994. In 1927 a government list was drawn up detailing which settlements were cities, with Bangor being included as the only medieval Welsh city with extant rights.

By means of various measures, Bangor is one of the smallest cities in the UK. Using 2011 statistics, comparing Bangor to:
* Population of city council areas in Wales, is third smallest (18,322 residents) with St Davids (1,841) and St Asaph (3,355).
* City council area size within Wales, is the second smallest city () behind St Asaph ().
* Urban areas within Wales, is third smallest, placed () behind St Davids () and St Asaph ()
* City council area size within the UK, is fourth smallest after the City of London (), Wells and St Asaph.
* Urban areas within the UK, is fifth smallest.
* Population of city council areas within the UK, is sixth smallest.

==Geography==
Bangor lies on the coast of North Wales near the Menai Strait, which separates the island of Anglesey from Gwynedd, the town of Menai Bridge lying just over the strait. The combined population of the two amounted to 22,184 at the 2011 census. Bangor Mountain at lies to the east of the main part of the city, but the large housing estate of Maesgeirchen, originally built as council housing, is to the east of the mountain near Port Penrhyn. Another ridge rises to the north of the High Street, dividing the city centre from the south shore of the Menai Strait; this area is known as Upper Bangor (&quot;Bangor Uchaf&quot;).

The Bangor community area includes the suburbs of Garth and Hirael both immediately north of the city centre; Upper Bangor north west of the centre; West End, Glan-adda, Bryn Llwyd and Coed Mawr to the south west; Y Maes to the south; Glantraeth, Tan-y-bryn and Maesgeirchen are to the east. The suburbs of Penhros-garnedd, Treborth and Minffordd are within the community of Pentir adjoining the city to the south and south west. Port Penrhyn and the tiny estate of Plas-y-coed, adjoin the city within the Llandygai community.

Bangor has two rivers within its boundaries. The River Adda is a largely culverted watercourse which only appears above ground at its western extremities near the Faenol estate, whilst the River Cegin enters Port Penrhyn at the eastern edge of the city. Port Penrhyn was an important port in the 19th century, exporting the slates produced at the Penrhyn Quarry.

==Governance==

There are two tiers of local government covering Bangor, at community (city) and county level: Bangor City Council (Cyngor Dinas Bangor) and Gwynedd Council (Cyngor Gwynedd). The city council meets at Penrhyn Hall on Fford Gwynedd and has its offices in the adjoining building, which was built in 1866 as the Diocesan Registry.

In 2021, Owen Hurcum was unanimously elected as mayor, making history as the youngest-ever mayor in Wales at 22, as well as the first ever non-binary mayor of any UK city.

In 2012, Bangor was the first city in the UK to impose a night-time curfew on under-16s throughout its centre. The six-month trial was brought in by Gwynedd Council and North Wales police, but opposed by civil rights groups.

Bangor lies within the Bangor Aberconwy constituency for elections to the UK parliament. Arfon is the constituency for elections to the Senedd.

===Administrative history===
Bangor was an ancient parish, which historically included a large rural area to the south and south-west of the city itself. The city was sometimes described as an ancient borough and was said to hold certain privileges. However, Bangor had no municipal charters and any corporation it may have had in medieval times did not endure. A government survey of boroughs in 1835 noted that it was plausible that Bangor may once have had a corporation, but found no evidence of any such corporation having operated for many years. Instead, Bangor was governed by the parish vestry and the Bishop of Bangor in his capacity as lord of the manor until the 19th century.

In 1832, a parliamentary borough of Bangor was established as one of the boroughs which made up the Carnarvon Boroughs constituency. The area of the parliamentary borough of Bangor was made a local board district in 1850, with an elected local board to govern the city. Over time the local board gained more powers for managing local affairs, but by the 1870s it was seen as ineffective. A petition was made for the city to be formally incorporated as a municipal borough, which would give it more extensive powers of local government. A municipal charter incorporating the city was duly granted in 1883. The Local Government Act 1894 directed that parishes could no longer straddle borough boundaries and so the part of Bangor parish outside the borough became the separate parish of Pentir.

The municipal borough of Bangor was abolished in 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972. A community called Bangor was created instead, covering the area of the abolished borough. District-level functions passed to Arfon Borough Council, which was in turn replaced in 1996 by Gwynedd Council. As part of the 1974 reforms, Bangor&#x27;s city status, which had been held by the abolished borough, was transferred to the new community.

==Demography==
Bangor is ethnically diverse, with 85% of the population identifying as White British, followed by 8% Asian or Arab, 3% Mixed Race, 2% Black and 2% other ethnic. This makes Bangor 85% white and 15% non-white, which means the city has one of the highest ethnicity populations in Wales for its population of over 15,000.

In religion, Christianity was followed by 8,816 residents, Islam followed by 892 residents, and 6,526 residents not identifying with any religion or identifying with other religions. Christianity is the most prominent religion but the second largest group followed no religion. In 2021, Muslims in Bangor complained that restrictions imposed in the city had left women unable to worship at the mosque during Ramadan, while arrangements, such as outdoor prayers, had been made in other parts of Wales .

==Transport==
Bangor railway station is a stop on the North Wales Coast Line, between , and . Services are operated by Transport for Wales.

Bus services are provided predominantly by Arriva Buses Wales; routes connect the city with Holyhead, Caernarfon and Llandudno.

The A5 runs through the centre of Bangor; it connects Holyhead, Shrewsbury and London. The A55 runs immediately to the south of Bangor, providing a route to Holyhead and Chester.

The nearest airport with international flights is Liverpool John Lennon Airport, which is by road.

Bangor lies at the western end of the North Wales Path, a long-distance coastal walking route to Prestatyn. Cycle routes NCR 5, NCR 8 and NCR 85 of the National Cycle Network pass through the city.

==Culture==
=== Heritage and nature conservation ===
The head office of Gwynedd Archaeological Trust is located on Garth Road. The Trust was established in 1974 and carries out surveys, outreach and education, and excavations across Gwynedd and Anglesey.

The North Wales Wildlife Trust is also based on Garth Road, and manages the nature reserves at &quot;Eithinog&quot; and &quot;Nantporth&quot;.

=== Music and arts ===

Classical music is performed regularly in Bangor, with concerts given in the Powis and Prichard-Jones Halls as part of the university&#x27;s Music at Bangor concert series. The city is also home to Storiel (the new name for the Gwynedd Museum and Art Gallery), which is located in Bangor Town Hall. A new arts centre complex, &quot;Pontio&quot;, the replacement for Theatr Gwynedd, was scheduled for completion in the summer of 2014, but the opening was delayed until November 2015.

Bangor hosted the National Eisteddfod in 1890, 1902, 1915, 1931, 1940 (through the medium of radio), 1943, 1971 and 2005, as well as an unofficial National Eisteddfod event in 1874.

Garth Pier is the second longest pier in Wales and the ninth longest in the British Isles, at in length. It was opened in 1893 and was a promenade pier for the amusement of holiday-makers, who could stroll among the pinnacle-roofed kiosks.

In 1914, the pier was struck by a vessel that had broken free of its moorings. The damaged section was repaired temporarily by the Royal Engineers but, when in 1922 a permanent repair was contemplated, it was found that the damage was more severe than had been thought. The repairs were made at considerable cost and the pier remained open until 1974, when it was nearly condemned as being in poor condition. It was sold for a nominal price to Arfon Borough Council who proposed to demolish it, but the County Council, encouraged by local support, ensured that it survived by obtaining Grade II Listed building status for it.

When it was listed that year, the British Listed Buildings inspector considered it to be &quot;the best in Britain of the older type of pier without a large pavilion at the landward end.&quot; Restoration work took place between 1982 and 1988, and the pier was re-opened to the public on 7 May 1988. In November 2011, essential repair work was reported to be required, the cost being estimated at £2 million. A grant from the Heritage Lottery Fund was sought but the application was rejected.

===Cathedral===

The Cathedral Church of St Deiniol is a Grade I Listed building and is set in a sloping oval churchyard. The site has been used for Christian worship since the sixth century but the present building dates from the twelfth century. It has a two-bay chancel, transepts, a crossing tower, a seven-bay nave and a tower at the west end.

===Theatre===
The 344-seat Theatr Gwynedd was opened on Deiniol Road in 1975 by the university and closed in 2008; the building was demolished in 2010. Prior to Theatr Gwynedd, Bangor was home to the County Theatre, a converted chapel on Dean Street. The building was altered in 1912 for theatrical productions and converted to a nightclub in 1986, currently known as &quot;Trilogy Nightclub&quot;.

The Pontio Arts and Innovation Centre by Bangor University on Deiniol Road, opened in 2015, has a theatre and a one screen cinema.

The Archdeacon&#x27;s House in Bangor was the setting for act 3, scene I of William Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Henry IV, Part 1&quot;.

=== Cinemas ===
Bangor once housed two cinemas:
* The Electric Pavilion – later Arcadia Cinema – stood on the High Street close to the station from about 1910 to 1930. This site was redeveloped for The Plaza Cinema, which operated from 1934 to 2006. A new building was built on the site and is now occupied by Ty Willis student accommodation and a Domino&#x27;s Pizza branch.
* The City Cinema opened in 1919, at 130–132, High Street. Building work started in 1914, but was likely delayed because of the war. The cinema closed in 1983, although the building is still there and is now occupied by a dance academy and a snooker club.

A one-screen cinema opened as part of the Pontio building in 2015.

=== Recreation ===
Bangor has two King George V fields; these are located on Beach Road and Heol Dewi.

==Retail trade==
Bangor has the longest High Street in Wales at . Bangor has a central shopping area around the High Street and retail outlets on Caernarfon Road, on the outskirts of the city. One of these is St. David&#x27;s Retail Park, built on the site of the demolished St David&#x27;s maternity hospital.

In 1865, Morris Wartski, a refugee from the Tsarist pogroms, first established a jewellery business on Bangor&#x27;s High Street and then a drapery store. His son, Isidore, went on to develop the drapery business and to create a large, fashionable store. He also redeveloped the Castle Inn on High Street in Bangor, which then became the high-class Castle Hotel. Wartski was a very popular mayor of the city and a great patron of local sports and charities. Wartski Fields were bequeathed to the city and people of Bangor by his widow, Winifred Marie, in memory of Isidore Wartski.

==Welsh language==
Gwynedd is the most Welsh-speaking county in Wales, with 65.4% of people saying they could speak it at the 2011 Census, although Bangor has been significantly more anglicised than its hinterland and the rest of Gwynedd, mostly because of the large student population. While nearby towns in Gwynedd, such as Bethesda and Caernarfon, were still 75–80% Welsh speaking in 2011, Bangor was already only 53.4% Welsh speaking as early as 1971.

In 2011, only 36% of the population of Bangor said they could speak Welsh; a significant decrease from the 46% recorded at the 2001 Census. In 2015, of primary school pupils 5 years and over, the following percentages spoke Welsh fluently at home:
* Ysgol Ein Harglwyddes – &lt; 3%
* Ysgol Cae Top – &lt; 3%
* Ysgol Hirael – 10%
* Ysgol Glancegin – 14%
* Ysgol Llandygai – 17%
* Ysgol Y Faenol – 23%
* Ysgol Y Garnedd – 61%

The city has long been the most cosmopolitan settlement in Gwynedd, attracting incomers from both England and further afield, with Bangor University being a key institution. At the 2011 Census, 49.3% of Bangor&#x27;s population was born outside Wales. Nevertheless, Welsh was the majority vernacular of the city in the 1920s and 1930s; at the 1921 Census, 75.8% of Bangor&#x27;s inhabitants could speak Welsh with 68.4% of those aged 3–4 being able to, indicating that Welsh was being transmitted to the youngest generation in most homes. The 1931 Census showed little change, with 76.1% of the overall population being able to speak Welsh.

==Education==
Bangor University and Coleg Menai are located in the city. There are a few secondary schools, these include Ysgol Friars, Ysgol Tryfan and St. Gerard&#x27;s School. There are also a number of primary and infant schools. Ysgol Y Faenol, Ysgol Y Garnedd and Ysgol Cae Top are all primary schools.

==Hospital==

Ysbyty Gwynedd is located in Bangor in the suburb of Penrhosgarnedd. It has 403 beds, making it smaller than the other district general hospitals in Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board (after Wrexham Maelor Hospital with 568 beds and Glan Clwyd Hospital near Rhyl with 424 beds.

The former Caernarfon and Anglesey General Hospital operated from 1809 to 1984 in Upper Bangor, on the site now occupied by a Morrisons supermarket.

==Sport==
Bangor has a long-established football team, Bangor City F.C. which currently competes in the Cymru North, the second tier of Welsh football. Bangor City won the Welsh Premier League on three occasions (1994, 1995, 2011) and were continuous members of the league from its inception until 2018. Bangor City have also won the Welsh Cup eight times, most recently in the 2010 competition. Before 1992, they were members of the English football pyramid, peaking with the Northern Premier League title in 1982 and being FA Trophy runners-up in 1984. They have also competed in the UEFA Cup Winners&#x27; Cup three times (including its final season, 1998–99, before being merged into the UEFA Cup), UEFA Champions League twice and UEFA Cup five times, though they have not progressed far in any of the European competitions.

Fans wanting to protect football in the city, formed a breakaway club called Bangor 1876 F.C. in the summer of 2019 and, on 19 June 2019, the FAW announced the new club had been accepted into the Gwynedd League for the 2019–20 season.

Bangor is also home to rugby union team Bangor RFC who play in the WRU Division Two North league. As well as the city&#x27;s team, the university boasts a very competitive rugby union team, which won the title in its BUCS league in the 2015-16 season and also undefeated in 2022 and 2023. The university&#x27;s rugby team shares a performance and development programme with Rygbi Gogledd Cymru (RGC), who are the regional representative club for the North Wales Rugby Development Region.

==Media==
The Bangor Aye is an independent online news and information service for the city and surrounding area.

Bangor is home to a small BBC broadcasting centre, producing a large amount of output for BBC Radio Cymru. The studios are also the main North-West Wales newsroom for television, radio and on-line. The BBC&#x27;s Light Entertainment Department moved to Bangor during World War II and many classic programmes (like &quot;It&#x27;s That Man Again&quot;) came from Bangor.

Bangor was also previously home to two commercial radio stations, Heart Cymru (now Capital Cymru) (serving Anglesey and Gwynedd) and the now-defunct Heart North Wales Coast (now Capital North West and Wales) (serving the North Wales Coast), which shared studio facilities on the Parc Menai office complex; the studios were closed in August 2010 after the stations were moved to Wrexham.

Bangor University also has its own student radio station called Storm FM, which broadcasts to the Ffriddoedd Site and from their website.

In 1967, The Beatles came to Bangor, staying in Dyfrdwy, one of the halls comprising Adeilad Hugh Owen (Hugh Owen Building), now part of the Management Centre, for their first encounter with Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, during which visit they learned of the death of their manager Brian Epstein.

On 24 February 2010, BBC Radio 1&#x27;s &quot;The Chris Moyles Show&quot; announced Bangor as the location for Radio 1&#x27;s Big Weekend concert festival. The morning show was broadcast on location from Bangor, with the announcement as well as a portion of the lineup being revealed. International acts such as Rihanna, MGMT, Kesha and Alicia Keys played as well as homegrown British acts such as Biffy Clyro, Pixie Lott, Cheryl Cole, Pendulum and Dizzee Rascal.

The town is mentioned in the Fiddler&#x27;s Dram 1979 hit single &quot;Day Trip to Bangor&quot;. The release was shrouded in controversy after reports that the song was actually inspired by a trip to nearby Rhyl; there were rumours of an outcry among local councillors and businesses in Rhyl about the missed opportunity for tourism which would have been generated. Songwriter Debbie Cook stated that the song was specifically written about Bangor.

==Bangor, Pennsylvania==
The United States town of Bangor in the Lehigh Valley region of eastern Pennsylvania draws its name from Bangor, Gwynedd. It was settled around 1760 by Robert M. Jones, an emigrant from Bangor, Gwynedd who went on to be influential in the development of the town&#x27;s slate industry. Slate quarries still exist in the small Pennsylvania town, but only a few are still functioning. A life-sized statue of Jones, dedicated on 24 September 1914, remains in the town centre. The influence of Bangor, Gwynedd is visible in the stone walls, square gardens, flowers, and greenery that mirror those of its Welsh namesake. Also like Bangor (Wales), Bangor (Pennsylvania) has piles of slate residue and shale reminiscent of the area.

<text>Sima Lun () (born before 250 – poisoned June 5, 301), courtesy name Ziyi (), was titled the Prince of Zhao () and the usurper of the Jin Dynasty from February 3 to May 31, 301. He is usually not counted in the list of Jin emperors due to his brief reign, and was often mentioned by historians as an usurper. He was the third of the eight princes commonly associated with the War of the Eight Princes.

==Early career==
As Sima Yi&#x27;s ninth and youngest son, Sima Lun held a number of minor titles during the Cao Wei regencies of his father and half-brothers Sima Shi and Sima Zhao. Around February or March 250, he was enfeoffed as Marquis of Anle Village, and when Sima Zhao established the Five Feudal Ranks of Zhou in 264, his fief was changed to Viscount of Dong&#x27;an, and he was designated Remonstrating and Consulting Grandee. 

After his nephew Sima Yan established the Jin dynasty on 8 February 266, Sima Lun was named the Prince of Langye Commandery the next day. He served as a general and governor at times during his nephew&#x27;s reign, but was undistinguished; several times he was accused of crimes, such as when sending Cavalier Commander Liu Ji to pay laborers wanting to rob imperial furs, but each time Emperor Wu pardoned him of them. On 5 October 277, his principality was moved to Zhao.

During the early reign of Emperor Hui, on 19 September 291, Sima Lun was placed in charge of the military command of Xu (徐州) and Yan (兖州) Provinces. About a month later, on 30 October, Lun&#x27;s post was changed; he was placed in charge of the military command of Qin (秦州, modern eastern Gansu) and Yong (雍州, modern central and northern Shaanxi) Provinces. During his tenure, his misgovernance contributed to conditions where the Di and the Qiang rebelled under the Di chief Qi Wannian in 296. His chief strategist Sun Xiu was arrested and initially set to be executed, but was spared by his half-brother Sima Rong. Sima Lun and Sun were recalled to the capital Luoyang, where he flattered Empress Hui&#x27;s empress Jia Nanfeng (who was then the &quot;de facto&quot; regent) and became trusted by her. Lun then requested a high level office, but was rebuffed by Empress Jia&#x27;s advisors Zhang Hua and Pei Wei.

==As regent==
Empress Jia, in jealousy, deposed the crown prince Sima Yu (born not of her, but of her husband&#x27;s concubine Consort Xie Jiu) in February 300. Later, there was a conspiracy to overthrow her and restore the crown prince. Sima Lun was persuaded to join the conspiracy, but Sun Xiu had another plan for him: he should encourage Empress Jia to assassinate the crown prince in exile, and then use the assassination as the excuse to overthrow her. Sima Lun accepted this plan and persuaded her to assassinate the crown prince, which she did in April 300. He then declared a coup against her in May and arrested her, slaughtering her clan and her associates (including Zhang and Pei). He then forced her to commit suicide.

Sima Lun then became regent for the developmentally disabled Emperor Hui, but was described as being not particularly more intelligent than Emperor Hui. Even though he carried the regent title, true power was in Sun Xiu&#x27;s hands. Under Sun Xiu&#x27;s persuasion, he deposed Emperor Hui and declared himself emperor in February 301, offering Emperor Hui the honorific title of retired emperor but putting him under house arrest. Emperor Hui&#x27;s grandson, the crown prince Sima Zang (司馬臧), was executed.

==As emperor==
The act of usurpation brought widespread anger. In order to appease those who might be angry at his usurpation, Sima Lun rewarded many people with honors. Sun, in particular, was issuing edicts based on his own whims. Suspecting three autonomous key princes—Sima Jiong the Prince of Qi (Emperor Hui&#x27;s cousin and the son of Emperor Hui&#x27;s uncle, Prince Xian of Qi Sima You), Sima Ying the Prince of Chengdu (Emperor Hui&#x27;s half-brother), and Sima Yong the Prince of Hejian (the grandson of Emperor Hui&#x27;s great-granduncle Sima Fu, Prince Xian of Anping), each of whom had strong independent military commands—Sun sent his trusted subordinates to be their assistants. Prince Jiong refused and declared a rebellion to restore Emperor Hui. Prince Ying, Sima Ai the Prince of Changshan (Emperor Hui&#x27;s half-brother), and Sima Xin (司馬歆) the Duke of Xinye (the son of a granduncle of Emperor Hui, Sima Jun) all declared support for Prince Jiong. Prince Yong initially sent his general Zhang Fang (張方) with intent to support Sima Lun, but then heard that Princes Jiong and Ying had great forces, and so declared for the rebels instead. Sima Lun&#x27;s forces were easily defeated by Princes Jiong&#x27;s and Ying&#x27;s forces, and after declaring himself emperor for three months, Sima Lun was captured by officials in Luoyang who declared for the rebellion as well and forced him to issue an edict returning the throne to Emperor Hui. Sima Lun was then forced to commit suicide. Sun and other associates of Sima Lun were executed, as were all of Sima Lun&#x27;s sons. Sima Lun was posthumously demoted to commoner rank as &quot;Commoner Zhao&quot;.

<text>James Forten (September 2, 1766March 4, 1842) was an American abolitionist and businessman in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. A free-born African American, he became a sailmaker after the American Revolutionary War. Following an apprenticeship, he became the foreman and bought the sail loft when his boss retired. Based on equipment he himself had developed, he established a highly profitable business. It was located on the busy waterfront of the Delaware River, in an area now called Penn&#x27;s Landing.

James Forten used his wealth and social standing to work for civil rights for African Americans in both the city and nationwide. Beginning in 1817, he opposed the colonization movements, particularly that of the American Colonization Society. He affirmed African Americans&#x27; claim to a stake in the United States of America. He persuaded William Lloyd Garrison to adopt an anti-colonization position and helped fund his newspaper &quot;The Liberator&quot; (1831–1865), frequently publishing letters on public issues. He became vice-president of the biracial American Anti-Slavery Society, founded in 1833, and worked for national abolition of slavery. His large family was also devoted to these causes, and two daughters married the Purvis brothers, who used their wealth as leaders for abolition.

==Early life and education==

James Forten was born free on September 2, 1766, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, one of two children of Thomas and Margaret Forten; a Philadelphia sailmaker, Thomas Forten was the grandson of a slave who had &quot;freed himself.&quot;

However, Thomas Forten died young (possibly because of falling from a high place), and his son James started to work at the age of seven to help his mother and sister. At first he was a chimney sweep, later becoming a grocery-store clerk. He also attended the African School, run by Quaker abolitionist Anthony Benezet, who founded it to educate black children free of charge. His mother insisted that he continue in school, but by the age of nine, Forten had left school to work full-time. His early years of work became a measure for progress in his life and career.

At the age of 14, during the Revolutionary War, Forten served on the privateer &quot;Royal Louis&quot;, commanded by Captain Stephen Decatur Sr. The &quot;Royal Louis&quot; was captured by a Royal Navy warship. Captain John Beazley, who had captured the privateer, was impressed with Forten. Forten recalled that Beazley offered Forten the opportunity to be educated in Great Britain with his son, Henry, but Forten replied, &quot;I have been taken prisoner for the liberties of my country, and never will prove a traitor to her interest.&quot; Beazley instead saw to it that he was treated as a prisoner of war along with the rest of the crew of the &quot;Royal Louis&quot;.

The prisoners were all transported to , then moored in Wallabout Bay, later the site of the Brooklyn Navy Yard.

Forten was fortunate as he was exchanged after seven months&#x27; imprisonment. He was released on parole after giving a promise not to fight in the war. He walked from Brooklyn to Philadelphia to return to his mother and sister. He signed up on a merchant ship, which sailed to England. He lived and worked there for more than a year in a London shipyard.

When Forten returned to Philadelphia in 1790, he became apprenticed to sail-maker Robert Bridges, his father&#x27;s former employer and a family friend. Forten learned quickly in the sail loft. This was where the large ship sails were cut and sewn. Before long, the young man was promoted to foreman.

==Career==
At Bridges&#x27; retirement in 1798, Forten bought the sail loft. By developing a tool to help maneuver the large sails, by 1810, Forten had built up one of the most successful sail lofts in Philadelphia. He created the conditions he worked for in society, employing both black and white workers. Because of his business acumen, Forten became one of the wealthiest Philadelphians in the city, black or white.

==Marriage and family==
James Forten married twice: his first wife, Martha Beatte (or Beatty) of Darby Township, Delaware County, died after only a few months of marriage (1804). In 1806, he married Charlotte Vandine (1785–1884). James and Charlotte Forten had nine children: Robert Bridges Forten, Margaretta, Harriet, Sarah Louisa, Charlotta, William Deas, Mary Theresa, Thomas Willing Francis, and James Jr. Robert and James Jr. succeeded their father in the family sail-making business.

The children grew up in and committed to the abolition movement. Robert, named for his father&#x27;s former boss and mentor, was a vigorous anti-slavery activist. William studied at the abolitionist Oneida Institute. Sisters Harriet and Sarah Louisa married the prominent abolitionist brothers Robert Purvis and Joseph Purvis, respectively. Educated at Amherst College, they were sons of a British immigrant and his wife, a free woman of color. They used their great wealth in lives of public service. Margaretta was a lifelong educator and became an officer of the Philadelphia Female Anti-Slavery Society in 1845.

The Fortens&#x27; granddaughter Charlotte Forten Grimké became a poet, diarist and educator. Her diary from teaching men who were free and their children in the South after the Civil War became well known; it was republished in scholarly editions in the 1980s.

==Public activism==
Having become well established, in his 40s Forten devoted both time and money to working for the national abolition of slavery and gaining civil rights for blacks. They were severely discriminated against in Pennsylvania and the North, and generally could not vote or serve on juries. He felt a sense of obligation to work on these issues of his community. &quot;...in 1801, he was among the signers of a petition to the U.S. Congress calling for the abolition of the slave trade and the modification of the Fugitive Slave Law of 1793.&quot;

In 1813 he wrote a pamphlet called &quot;Letters From A Man of Colour&quot;, published anonymously. (See External links below.) (Many people knew he had written it.) He denounced a bill under consideration in the Pennsylvania legislature that required all black emigrants to Pennsylvania to be registered with the state, and protested treating free blacks any differently than whites. Some legislators were worried about the number of free blacks who migrated into the state, competing with white laborers. In addition, they knew fugitive slaves often used Pennsylvania as a destination or byway to other free areas, as it was bordered by slave states to the south.

Forten believed the bill was a step backward for black Pennsylvanians. In his &quot;Letters,&quot; Forten argued that the bill would violate the rights of any free blacks entering the state and set the people apart as somehow not equal to whites. Forten wanted the many respectable citizens of the black community to be recognized and valued. In the end, the bill was not passed, and James Forten became known for his succinct and passionate pamphlet.

In the early 19th century, some black and white Americans supported movements to &quot;resettle&quot; free blacks on the African continent, in Canada, or in Haiti, which achieved independence from France in 1804. In the late 18th century, the British had founded Freetown as a colony in present-day Sierra Leone, for the resettlement of Black Britons from London, together with those Black Loyalists who wanted to leave Nova Scotia. During the American Revolutionary War, the Crown had offered freedom to slaves who left Patriot masters. The British evacuated thousands of freed slaves along with their troops, and resettled more than 3,000 Black Loyalists in Nova Scotia, where it granted land. Others went to London or the West Indies.

The American Colonization Society (ACS) was formed in December 1816, organized to found the colony of Liberia in West Africa for a similar purpose. It offered to help blacks to go there voluntarily, with provisions of aid for supplies, housing and other materials. Made up of abolitionists, slaveholders, and missionaries, its members supported voluntary relocation of free blacks and newly freed slaves to Africa, to solve the &quot;problem&quot; of blacks in American society. In the first two decades after the Revolution, the number of free blacks rose significantly, due both to wholesale abolition of slavery in the North, as well as an increase in manumissions in the South by men moved by revolutionary ideals. In some areas, the new competition for social resources resulted in a rise in racial discrimination against free blacks. Southerners wanted to remove free blacks from their region, as they believed the free people destabilized slavery. Northerners thought a new colony might give the blacks more independence and a chance to create their own society. The proposal was also supported by clergy who expected the black Americans to evangelize Christianity to Africans. News about the organization, especially racist remarks by such leaders as Henry Clay of Kentucky, a national politician, raised fears among many free blacks that the ACS proposed to deport them wholesale to Africa.

Forten had supported Paul Cuffee, a Boston shipbuilder, who in 1815 transported 38 free blacks to Sierra Leone, with the idea they could make a better life where not impeded by white racism. He was well aware of continuing problems due to harsh discrimination against blacks in the United States.

To address community concerns and discuss the potential for colonization, James Forten worked with Bishop Richard Allen of the African Methodist Episcopal Church, the first independent black denomination in the United States; Absalom Jones, and James Gloucester to organize a meeting on this topic in Philadelphia. Their announced meeting in January 1817 at Bethel AME Church drew 3,000 attendees from Philadelphia. Hearing the strong views of this public forced a dramatic turning point for these leaders.

By this time, most free blacks and slaves had been born in the United States and claimed it as their own, with their own families. At the meeting, Forten called for a vote, asking who favored colonization. Not one man said yes. When he asked who was against it, the crowd resounded with &quot;No!&quot; that made the hall ring. All claimed the US as their own, and wanted to gain their full civil rights there as citizens. After that meeting, Forten and the ministers strongly opposed the ACS, and Forten later converted William Lloyd Garrison, a younger white abolitionist from Boston, against the colonization schemes. Following the January meeting, Forten helped draft a Resolution of the sense of the public, which he and other leaders sent to the Pennsylvania congressional delegation. In August they published a longer &quot;Address to the Inhabitants of the City and County of Philadelphia,&quot; which attacked colonization.

He absorbed his community&#x27;s arguments and noted that most American blacks had been in the United States for many generations and had claim to it as their land. Although the ACS advertised Liberia as a place of opportunity for free blacks, the colony struggled to survive and many colonists died of disease. There were risks of re-enslavement by illegal slave traders and smugglers. Relationships with the native Africans were not desirable.

After Haiti became established as an independent black republic in 1804, some Americans were interested in emigrating there. In the early 1820s, President Jean-Pierre Boyer united all the island of Hispaniola under Haitian control. He also gained official recognition for the nation from France for the first time, but at the cost of a high indemnity that crippled the country financially for generations. He appealed to American free blacks to immigrate there and help its development. Its independence raised many complex issues for free Blacks in the United States. Despite his support for the new nation, Forten was among important Black leaders who opposed immigration for Americans. He firmly believed that Blacks should be allowed to play an equal role in their land of the United States. He consistently said that it was far better for them to fight for an egalitarian US society rather than to flee the country.

Forten helped William Lloyd Garrison start up his newspaper, &quot;The Liberator,&quot; in 1831, supporting it financially. He frequently published letters in it, as &quot;A Colored Man of Philadelphia.&quot; Garrison also wrote articles against colonization, describing the poor living conditions in Liberia. They wanted others to know that the ACS was not necessarily working in the best interest of black Americans.

According to his biographer Julie Winch:

By the 1830s, his was one of the most powerful African-American voices, not just for men and women of color in his native city, but for many thousands more throughout the North. He knew how to use the press and the speaker&#x27;s podium. He knew about building alliances, when to back down and when to press forwards with his agenda. His rise to prominence, his understanding of the nature of power and authority, his determination to speak out and be heard are object lessons in the realities of community politics. Disfranchised he might have been, but voiceless he never was.

James Forten managed his sail loft and stayed active in the abolitionist movement until very late in his life, continuing to write for &quot;The Liberator&quot;. He died on March 4, 1842, at the age of 75 in Philadelphia. Thousands of people, both black and white, attended his funeral.

==Death==
He died on March 4, 1842, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and is interred at Eden Cemetery in Collingdale, Pennsylvania.

==Legacy and honors==
Bolden wrote of him: &quot;When James Forten died, he left behind an exemplary family, a sizable fortune, and a legacy of philanthropy and activism that inspired generations of black Philadelphians.&quot;

In 2001, scholar Molefi Kete Asante listed James Forten on his list of &quot;100 Greatest African Americans&quot;.

In February 2023, the Museum of the American Revolution in Philadelphia will open the first-ever museum exhibition dedicated to Forten&#x27;s life and family, &quot;Black Founders: The Forten Family of Philadelphia&quot;.

<text>The First Things First manifesto was written 29 November 1963 and published in 1964 by Ken Garland. It was backed by over 400 graphic designers and artists and also received the backing of Tony Benn, radical left-wing MP and activist, who published it in its entirety in &quot;The Guardian&quot; newspaper.

Reacting against a rich and affluent Britain of the 1960s, it tried to re-radicalize a design industry which the signatories felt had become lazy and uncritical. Drawing on ideas shared by critical theory, the Frankfurt School, and the counter-culture of the time, it explicitly reaffirmed the belief that design is not a neutral, value-free process.

It rallied against the consumerist culture that was purely concerned with buying and selling things and tried to highlight a Humanist dimension to graphic design theory. It was later updated and republished with a new group of signatories as the First Things First 2000 manifesto.

<text>The First Things First 2000 manifesto, launched by &quot;Adbusters&quot; magazine in 1999, was an updated version of the earlier First Things First manifesto written and published in 1964 by Ken Garland, a British designer.

The 1999 manifesto was signed by a group of 33 figures from the international graphic design community, many of them well known, and simultaneously published in &quot;Adbusters&quot; (Canada), &quot;Emigre&quot; (Issue 51) and &quot;AIGA Journal of Graphic Design&quot; (United States), &quot;Eye&quot; magazine no. 33 vol. 8, Autumn 1999, &quot;Blueprint&quot; (Britain) and &quot;Items&quot; (Netherlands). The manifesto was subsequently published in many other magazines and books around the world, sometimes in translation. Its aim was to generate discussion about the graphic design profession&#x27;s priorities in the design press and at design schools. Some designers welcomed this attempt to reopen the debate, while others rejected the manifesto.

The question of value-free design has been continually contested in the graphic design community between those who are concerned about the need for values in design and those who believe it should be value-free. Those who believe that design &quot;can&quot; be free from values reject the idea that graphic designers should concern themselves with underlying political questions. Those who are concerned about values believe that designers should be critical and take a stand in their choice of work, for instance by not promoting industries and products perceived to be harmful. Examples of projects that might be classified as unacceptable include many forms of advertising and designs for cigarette manufacturers, arms companies and so on. &quot;Adbusters&quot; has been a significant outlet for these ideas, especially in its commitment to detournement and culture jamming.

<text>Charles-Antoine Campion, italianized as Carlo Antonio Campioni (16 November 172012 April 1788) was a French-Italian composer who was born in Lorraine, France. He was a prolific composer and represented a link between Baroque compositional methods and those of the Classical style.

==Life==
===Early years and employment in Livorno===
Campion was born in Lunéville (Meurthe-et-Moselle) in Lorraine to Jacques and Charlotte Bruget. Not much is known about his early musical education in Lorraine, but he may have been a student of Henri Desmarets. Given that his father was serving in the Lorraine court, his family was transferred to Florence, Italy at the same time as the rise to the throne of the Tuscan &quot;Granduca&quot; (Grand Duke) Francis of Lorraine in 1737. During this period of time, he presumably came into contact with Giuseppe Tartini, who was Campion&#x27;s teacher. From 1752 to 1762, Campion was Chapel Master of the Cathedral in Livorno. He was fortunate to be friends with some aristocrats, and succeeded in having his opera (&quot;Venere placata&quot;, libretto by Marco Coltellini) performed for the celebration in Livorno (at the Avvalorati Academy) of the royal wedding of Joseph II and Princess Isabella of Parma in 1760. On 14 February 1763, the Grand Duke, with no regard to the normal selection procedures, nominated Campion Master of the Court Chapel, which combined that of the Cathedral and the Baptistry. It is possible that father Giovanni Battista Martini advised the Grand Duke to nominate Campion; it is known that Campion had been in contact with Martini previously (letters between the two men, who shared a passion for old music, are conserved at the International Museum and Music Library in Bologna).

===Employment in Florence and international recognition===
The employment of Campion followed the idea and desire to rebuild the court&#x27;s musical activities in Florence, which was intended to be reestablished by the Lorraines after the decline during the &quot;Reggenza&quot; period: an intention that became intensified with the new Grand Duke Peter Leopold. During his employment in Florence, Campion gained the respect of Italian and European cultural society for his taste and his collection of antique music. Charles Burney mentions him as a great collector in his &quot;The Present State of Music in France and Italy&quot;, affirming that his collection was second only to that of Martini. In the 1760s, he traveled abroad in order to promote the publication of his music. He printed his music in Amsterdam and Paris under his own supervision, and Walsh published his works in London. The Walsh editions were diffused worldwide and were highly appreciated by Thomas Jefferson, who became a great collector of Campion&#x27;s compositions for violin, of which he even kept a thematic catalogue. In 1766 he married Margherita Perloz Brunet, a harpsichord expert and painter, to whom he dedicated some of his keyboard compositions. There is some information regarding his meeting with Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, who at the time was only fourteen, in Florence in 1770.

===Final years and the querelle with Ligniville===
In the 1770s, Campion was the protagonist of a harsh with the Marquise Eugenio di Ligniville who was also from Lorraine and participated in the regeneration of the Florentine musical activities and supported the nomination of Campion to Master of the Unified Courts. Ligniville, himself, also gained from this nomination and received the appointment of Superintendent of the Music of the Real Chamber and Chapel. The nature of their contracts very clearly established the fact that Ligniville&#x27;s concern was to ensure more complex performances, while Campion&#x27;s task was to guarantee ordinary routine musical activities and administrative tasks. However, in 1772, perhaps driven by the desire for attention or by a competitive tendency unique to himself, Ligniville told the Grand Duke to not be satisfied by his superior musical status and accused Campion of not being able to manage the Capella, both economically and musically. This might have been an attempt to take Campion&#x27;s job. The accusations were not supported by many in the Duke&#x27;s court: Campion was well-liked by the Grand Duke himself and his officials. He succeeded in personally reacting to the attack, demonstrating his ability by writing the &quot;Trattato teorico e pratico dell&#x27;accompagnamento del cimbalo con l&#x27;arte di trasportare in tutti i toni e sopra tutti gli strumenti&quot; (a treaty of composition) dedicated to Peter Leopold (the autograph is found at the Florence Conservatory). During the debate which lasted four years, Father Martini became indirectly involved, and although he was personally closer to Ligniville, Father Martini confirmed Campion&#x27;s talent. As a result of his excessive accusations, in 1776 Ligniville was stripped of his responsibilities and fired, while Campion remained in his position, and received many honors until his death in 1788.

==Works and style==
Campion was a prolific composer and represents a &quot;&quot; between Baroque compositional methods and those of the Classical style. He composed many instrumental pieces for harpsichord and strings, which were mentioned previously as being extremely successful abroad for demonstrating an excessive chromatic style, surely influenced by his teacher Tartini. He worked very often with sacred music, in which on the contrary demonstrates a very rigid approach to counterpoint. Many of his sacred compositions originate from celebrations and the court: for example, the &quot;Requiem&quot; for the death of Francis I of Lorrain (1766, the autograph is in Berlin, see Source section); the &quot;Te Deum&quot;, written for the birth of the heir to the throne Francis II (1768), which required almost 200 performers; and the &quot;Requiem&quot; for the Florentine celebration of the death of Maria Theresa (1781), today in Vienna (see Sources). Oddly, there are no profane celebratory compositions by Campion if not the cited &quot;Venere placata&quot; for the marriage of Josef II, and the incomplete &quot;Etruria fortunata&quot;, written for Peter Leopold, which was probably unfinished because of Campion&#x27;s death (the autograph is conserved in Fiesole, see Sources). It is also important to mention the non-celebratory profane cantatas &quot;T&#x27;amo bell&#x27;idol mio&quot;, for voice and instruments (conserved at the Conservatory of Florence), and the epithalamic cantata written for the Pichi family, today in Ancona.

==Sources==
===Autographs===
Campion&#x27;s autographs are found in the following places: 
*Florence: the Conservatory Luigi Cherubini conserves the cited &quot;Trattato teorico e pratico dell&#x27;accompagnamento del cimbalo con l&#x27;arte di trasportare in tutti i toni e sopra tutti gli strumenti&quot;, dedicated to Peter Leopold (it remains unedited), and has at least 5 autographs of sacred music in addition to numerous contemporary manuscripts: all of the documents mostlty digitalized on Italian database &quot;Internet Culturale&quot;.
*Ancona: «Luciano Benincasa» library conserved a probable autograph of the epithalamic cantata for the Pichi family.
*Fiesole: in the library of the local music school (in the «Stefanelli» collection) was found the incomplete autograph of the cited &quot;Etruria fortunata&quot;, which is conserved in an elegant binding from the late 1700s.

<text>James McCune Smith (April 18, 1813 – November 17, 1865) was an American physician, apothecary, abolitionist and author. He was the first African American to earn a medical degree. His M.D. was awarded by the University of Glasgow in Glasgow, Scotland, where a building has been dedicated to him. After his return to the United States, he also became the first African American to run a pharmacy in the nation.

In addition to practicing as a physician for nearly 20 years at the Colored Orphan Asylum in Manhattan, Smith was a public intellectual: he contributed articles to medical journals, participated in learned societies, and wrote numerous essays and articles drawing from his medical and statistical training. He used his training in medicine and statistics to refute common misconceptions about race, intelligence, medicine, and society in general. He was invited as a founding member of the New York Statistics Society in 1852, which promoted a then new science. Later he was elected as a member in 1854 of the recently founded American Geographic Society. He was never admitted to the American Medical Association or local medical associations, very likely as a result of the systemic racism that Smith confronted throughout his medical career.

He has been most well known for his leadership as an abolitionist: a member of the American Anti-Slavery Society, with Frederick Douglass he helped start the National Council of Colored People in 1853, the first permanent national organization for blacks. Douglass called Smith &quot;the single most important influence on his life.&quot; Smith was one of the Committee of Thirteen, who organized in 1850 in Manhattan to resist the newly passed Fugitive Slave Law by aiding refugee slaves through the Underground Railroad. Other leading abolitionist activists were among his friends and colleagues. From the 1840s, Smith lectured on race and abolitionism and wrote numerous articles to refute racist ideas about black capacities.

Both Smith and his wife were of mixed African and European descent. As he became economically successful, Smith built a house in a mostly white neighborhood; in the 1860 census he and his family were classified as white, along with their neighbors. (In the census of 1850, while living in a predominately African-American neighborhood, they had been classified as mulatto.) Smith served for nearly 20 years as the physician at the Colored Orphan Asylum in New York. After it was burned down in July 1863 by a mob in draft riots in Manhattan, in which nearly 100 blacks were killed, Smith moved his family and practice to Brooklyn for their safety. Many other blacks left Manhattan for Brooklyn at the same time. The parents stressed education for their children. In the 1870 census, his widow and children continued to be classified as white.

== Early life and education ==
Smith was born into slavery in 1813 in Manhattan and was set free on July 4, 1827, at the age of 14, by the Emancipation Act of New York. That was the final date when New York officially freed its remaining slaves. His mother was an enslaved woman named Lavinia who achieved her freedom later in life; in 1855, Smith described her as a &quot;self-emancipated woman&quot;. She was born into slavery in South Carolina and had been brought to New York as a slave. His father was Samuel Smith, a white merchant and his mother&#x27;s master, who had brought her with him to New York from South Carolina.
He grew up only with his mother. As an adult, James Smith alluded to other white ancestry through his mother&#x27;s family, saying he had kin in the South, some of whom were slaveholders and others slaves.
Smith attended the African Free School (AFS) #2 on Mulberry Street in Manhattan, where he was described as an &quot;exceptionally bright student&quot;. He was selected to deliver an oratory to the Marquis de Lafayette, the French war hero who visited the school on September 10, 1824, during his tour of the country. Smith was among numerous boys from the school who went on to have brilliant careers, some of whom he worked with as adults in the abolitionist cause.

In the course of his studies, Smith was tutored by Rev. Peter Williams Jr., a graduate of the African Free School who had been ordained in 1826 as the second African-American priest in the Episcopal Church. Upon graduation, he applied to Columbia University and Geneva Medical College in New York State, but was denied admission due to racial discrimination. Williams encouraged Smith to attend the University of Glasgow in Scotland. He and abolitionist benefactors of the AFS provided Smith with money for his trip overseas and his education. Smith kept a journal of his sea voyage that expressed his sense of mission. After arriving in Liverpool and walking along the waterfront, he thought: &quot;I am free!&quot;

Through abolitionist connections, he was welcomed there by members of the London Agency Anti-Slavery Society. According to the historian Thomas M. Morgan, Smith enjoyed the relative racial tolerance in Scotland and England, which judicially abolished slavery in the 1770s. (New York abolished all slavery in 1827.) He studied at the University of Glasgow and obtained a bachelor&#x27;s degree in 1835, a master&#x27;s degree in 1836, and a medical degree in 1837. He completed an internship in Paris.

Smith knew he would face discrimination upon his return. When he tried to book a trip back to the United States after completing his studies, the ship captain refused passage because of Smith&#x27;s race. His passage was secured by an intervention from John Murray, a prominent Glasgow abolitionist who wrote to the captain directly. When Smith did return to Manhattan, he was met with a hero&#x27;s welcome by his former classmates and teachers who applauded his determination to fight for civil rights on American soil.

== Marriage and family ==
After establishing himself upon his return to New York City, in the early 1840s Smith married Malvina Barnett, a free woman of color who had graduated from the Rutgers Female Institute. The couple had eleven children; five survived to adulthood (the name of one child is unknown): 
*Frederick Douglass Smith (d. 1854), not to be confused with Frederick Douglass
*Peter Williams (d. 1854)
*Mary S.
*James W. (born 1845) became a teacher; he married and had an independent household by 1870 
*Henry M. (1847 – d. before 1859)
*Amy G. (–1849 – d. December 1849)
*Mary (also called Maude), born ––56; never married; became a teacher and was living with her widowed brother Donald in 1900 in Queens. (Note: In the 1900 census, her birth was reported as September 1842, but this is not consistent with her age in the 1860 and 1870 censuses, and she did not appear in the 1850 census.)
*Donald (born 1858) became a lawyer, married and was a widower by 1900, living in Queens. His household included his older sister Maude and two siblings of his late wife: his widowed brother-in-law Edward, a physician born in England, and sister-in-law Emma Callaghan, an unmarried teacher.
*John Murray, (born February 1860), named after his father&#x27;s Scottish friend, John Murray worked in Florida in an orange grove in the 1880s, per the Florida 1885 census. He married in 1888, and their three children were born in Florida. By 1900, he returned to Brooklyn with his family, and worked there as a printer. In 2019, a descendent rediscovered his maternal ancestry through various genealogical records. His son was Jay Murray Smith, who married a Rose (or Rosa) Larm from New York.
*Guy B., born 1862, first worked as a seaman. By 1900, he was married with several children and worked as a salesman. His youngest daughter was named Antoinette.

In 1850, the senior Smiths&#x27; household included four older women: Lavinia Smith, age 67 (his mother: b. c.1783 – d. bet.1860-1870), born in South Carolina and listed first as head of household; Sarah Williams, 57 (widow of Peter Williams Jr.); Amelia Jones, 47; and Mary Hewlitt, 53, who were likely relatives or friends. By then Smith and his wife Malvina had three children: James, Henry, and Amy. Each member of the household was classified as mulatto (or of mixed ancestry). All but Lavinia Smith were born in New York. They lived in a mixed neighborhood in the Fifth Ward; in the census, nearly all other neighbors on the page were classified as white; many were immigrants from England, Ireland, and France.

By 1860, Smith was doing very well; he had moved to Leonard Street within the Fifth Ward and had a mansion built by white workmen. His total real property was worth $25,000. His household included a live-in servant, Catherine Grelis from Ireland. Listed as a separate household at his address were Sara D. Williams, 57, and Mary Hertell (should be Hewlitt, as above), 50. (These were likely the same Sara and Mary as in the 1850 census, although their ages did not change.) No one on this census page had a racial designation. By the conventions of the time, this means that they were classified as white by the census enumerator; totals of white persons only are given at the bottom of the page.

After the draft riots in Manhattan in 1863, Smith and his family were among prominent African Americans who left Manhattan and moved to Brooklyn, then still separate cities. He no longer felt safe in their old neighborhood.

In the 1870 census, Malvina (now a widow) and their four children were living in Ward 15, Brooklyn. All were classified as white. Their son James W. Smith, who had married a white woman, was living in a separate household and working as a teacher; he was also classified as white. The Smith children still at home were Maud, 15; Donald, 12; John, 10; and Guy, 8; all were attending school. These five Smith children survived to adulthood: James, Maud, Donald, John and Guy. The men married white spouses, but Maud never married. All were classified as white from 1860 onward.

They worked as teachers, a lawyer, and business people. Smith&#x27;s unique achievements as a pioneering African-American physician were rediscovered by twentieth-century historians. They were relearned by his descendants in the twenty-first century, who identified as white and did not know about him with the passage of generations. A three-times-great-granddaughter took a history class and found his name in her grandmother&#x27;s family Bible. In 2010, several Smith descendants commissioned a new tombstone for his grave in Brooklyn. They gathered to honor him and their African-American ancestry.

== Career ==

=== Medicine ===
McCune Smith received his medical doctorate from Glasgow University in 1837. The university&#x27;s medical school was one of the leading programmes in Europe. After his graduation, he was awarded a prestigious gynacological residency at Glasgow&#x27;s Lock hospital for women. Based on his experience in the hospital, he published two articles in the &quot;London Medical Gazette&quot;. They are the first scientific articles known to have been published by an African American in a scientific journal. The articles exposed the unethical use of an experimental drug upon non-consenting female patients.

When Smith returned to Manhattan in 1837 with his degrees, he was greeted as a hero by the black community. He said at a gathering, &quot;I have striven to obtain education, at every sacrifice and every hazard, and to apply such education to the good of our common country.&quot; He was the first university-trained African-American physician in the United States. During his practice of 25 years, he was also the first Black to have articles published in American medical journals, but he was never admitted to the American Medical Association or to local ones.

He established his practice in Lower Manhattan in general surgery and medicine, treating both black and white patients. He started a school in the evenings, teaching children. He established what has been called the first black-owned and operated pharmacy in the United States, located at 93 West Broadway (near present-day Foley Square). His friends and activists gathered in the back room of the pharmacy to discuss issues related to their work in abolitionism.

In 1846, Smith was appointed as the only physician of the Colored Orphan Asylum (also known as the Free Negro Orphan Asylum), at Forty-fourth Street and Fifth Avenue. (Before that time, the directors had depended on &quot;pro bono&quot; services of physicians.) He worked there for nearly 20 years. The asylum was founded in 1836 by Anna and Hannah Shotwell and Mary Murray, Quaker philanthropists in New York. Trying to protect the children, Smith regularly gave vaccinations for smallpox. Leading causes of death were infectious diseases: measles (for which there was no vaccine), smallpox, and tuberculosis (for which there was no antibiotic at the time). In addition to caring for orphans, the home sometimes boarded children temporarily when their parents were unable to support them, as jobs were scarce for free blacks in New York. Waves of immigration from Ireland and Germany in the 1840s and 1850s meant that many new immigrants were competing for work.

Smith was always working for the asylum. In July 1852, he presented the trustees with 5,000 acres of land provided by his friend Gerrit Smith, a wealthy white abolitionist. The land was to be held in trust and later sold for benefit of the orphans.

=== Abolitionist movement ===
While in Scotland, Smith joined the Glasgow Emancipation Society and met people in the Scottish and English abolitionist movement. In 1833, Great Britain abolished slavery in the British Empire (slavery in England had been abolished in 1107, but this was not finally confirmed in law until the Somerset v Stewart case in 1772. Scotland has a separate legal system and a similar case to Somerset confirmed the invalidity of slavery under Scottish law in 1778.) When Smith returned to New York, he quickly joined the American Anti-Slavery Society and worked for the cause in the United States. He worked effectively with both Black and white abolitionists, for instance maintaining a friendship and correspondence with Gerrit Smith that spanned the years from 1846 to 1865.

Publishing lectures quickly brought him to the attention of the national abolitionist movement. His &quot;Destiny of the People of Color&quot;, &quot;Freedom and Slavery for Africans&quot;, and &quot;A lecture on the Haitian Revolution; with a note on Toussaint L&#x27;Ouverture&quot;, established him as a new force in the field. He directed the Colored People&#x27;s Educational Movement (to the memory of Abraham Lincoln). In 1850, as a member of the Committee of Thirteen, Smith was one of the key organizers of resistance in Manhattan to the newly passed Fugitive Slave Act that required states to aid federal law enforcement in capturing escaped slaves. As did similar groups in Boston, his committee aided fugitive slaves to escape capture and helped connect them to people of the Underground Railroad and other escape routes.

During the mid-1850s, Smith worked with Frederick Douglass to establish the National Council of Colored People, one of the first permanent Black national organizations, beginning with a three-day convention in Rochester, New York. At the convention in Rochester, he and Douglass emphasized the importance of education for their race and urged the founding of more schools for Black youth. Smith wanted choices available for both industrial and classical education. Douglass valued his rational approach and said that Smith was &quot;the single most important influence on his life&quot;. Smith tempered the more radical people in the abolitionist movement and insisted on arguing from facts and analysis. He wrote a regular column in Douglass&#x27;s paper, published under the pseudonym &quot;Communipaw&quot;.

Opposing the emigration of American free blacks to other countries, Smith believed that native-born Americans had the right to live in the United States and a claim by their labor and birth to their land. He gathered supporters to go to Albany to testify to the state legislature against proposed plans to support the American Colonization Society that had supported sending free Blacks to the colony of Liberia in Africa. He contributed money to revive the &quot;Weekly Anglo-African&quot; in 1861, as an anti-emigrationist newspaper.

In the mid-1850s, Smith joined James W.C. Pennington and other black leaders in establishing the Legal Rights Association (LRA) in Manhattan. A pioneering minority-rights association, the LRA waged a nearly ten-year campaign against segregated public transportation in the city. This organization successfully defeated segregation in New York and served as a model for later rights organizations, including the National Equal Rights League and the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), founded in the early twentieth century.

=== Draft Riots ===
In July 1863, during the draft riots in Manhattan, Irish rioters attacked Blacks throughout the city and burned down the orphan asylum. The children were saved by the staff and Union troops in the city. During its nearly 30 years, the orphan asylum had admitted 1310 children, and typically, had approximately 200 in residence at a time.

After the riots, Smith moved his family and business out of Manhattan to Brooklyn, as did other prominent Blacks. Numerous buildings had been destroyed in their old neighborhoods, and estimates were that some 100 Blacks were killed in the rioting. No longer feeling safe in the lower Fourth Ward, the Smiths moved to Williamsburg, Brooklyn.

=== Professional associations and writings ===

Smith was a prolific writer and essayist. The historian John Stauffer of Harvard University says: &quot;He was one of the leaders within the movement to abolish slavery, and he was one of the most original and innovative writers of his time.&quot;

In 1839, he followed Samuel Cornish as editor of &quot;The Colored American&quot;, a New York weekly newspaper owned by Philip Alexander Bell. Among his notable writings was a debate with John Hughes, the Roman Catholic Archbishop of New York, who was known as a racist and anti-abolitionist.

In 1840, Smith wrote the earliest known case report by a Black physician, entitled &quot;Case of Ptyalism with fatal termination&quot; that his associate Dr. John Watson read at a meeting of the New York Medical and Surgical Society. In 1844, Smith published an article entitled &quot;On the Influence of Opium upon the Catamenial Functions&quot; in the &quot;New York Journal of Medicine&quot;, the earliest known contribution to the medical literature by a Black physician.

He drew from his medical training to discredit popular misconceptions about differences among the races. In 1843, he gave a lecture series entitled &quot;Comparative Anatomy and Physiology of the Races&quot; to demonstrate the failings of phrenology, which was a so-called &quot;scientific&quot; practice of the time that was applied in a way to draw racist conclusions and attribute negative characteristics to ethnic Africans. He rejected the practice of homeopathy, an alternative to the scientific medicine being taught in universities. Although he had a successful medical career, Smith was never admitted to the American Medical Association or local associations because of racial discrimination.

In Glasgow, he was trained in the emerging science of statistics. He published numerous articles applying his statistical training. For example, he used statistics to refute the arguments of slave owners, who wrote that Blacks were inferior and that slaves were better off than were free Blacks or white urban laborers. To do this, he drew up statistical tables of data derived from the census.

When John C. Calhoun, then U.S. Secretary of State claimed that freedom negatively affected Black Americans and that the 1840 U.S. Census showed that Blacks in the North had high rates of insanity and mortality, Smith responded with a masterful paper. In &quot;A Dissertation on the Influence of Climate on Longevity&quot; (1846), published in &quot;Hunt&#x27;s Merchants&#x27; Magazine&quot;, Smith analyzed the census both to refute Calhoun&#x27;s conclusions and to show the correct way to analyze data. He showed that Blacks in the North lived longer than slaves, attended church more, and were achieving scholastically at a rate similar to whites. Based on Smith&#x27;s findings, John Quincy Adams, acting in his capacity in the House of Representatives, called for an investigation of the census results. However, Calhoun responded by appointing a pro-slavery crony who determined that the census was flawless, and the 1840 census was never corrected.

In 1847, the founding year of the New York Academy of Medicine (NYAM), Smith was nominated for resident fellowship by two founding members of the academy. Because of his race, Smith&#x27;s nomination posed a challenge for the fledgling, but rapidly growing academy and its committee on admissions, who wished to avoid &quot;agitation of the question&quot;. After discussions, correspondence, and procedural postponements throughout 1847, the committee on admissions eventually neither accepted nor rejected Smith, but instead implemented a rule to permit Smith to be regarded as &quot;not nominated&quot;, a unique designation that effectively rejected his fellowship.

As Smith started publishing, his work was quickly accepted by newer scientific organizations: in 1852 Smith was invited to be a founding member of the New York Statistics Institute. In 1854 he was elected as a member by the American Geographical Society (founded in New York in 1851 by top scientists as well as wealthy amateurs interested in exploration). The Society recognized him by giving him an award for one of his articles. He joined the New-York Historical Society.

Among numerous other works supporting abolitionism and dealing with issues related to race, Smith was known for his introduction to Frederick Douglass&#x27;s second autobiography, &quot;My Bondage and My Freedom&quot; (1855). It expressed the new independence in African-American accounts of slavery, compared to earlier works that had to seek approval for authentication from white abolitionists, as readers rejected some harsh accounts of conditions under slavery.

Smith wrote: &quot;The worst of our institutions, in its worst aspect, cannot keep down energy, truthfulness, and earnest struggle for the right&quot;.

In addition, during the 1850s Smith gained prominence with African-American readers and abolitionist readers of all ethnicities for his regularly published (often weekly) columns in &quot;Frederick Douglass Paper&quot;. Smith&#x27;s commentaries on African-American culture, local and national politics, literature, and styles of dress made him one of the earliest Black public intellectuals to gain popularity in the U.S.

In 1859, Smith published an article using scientific findings and analysis to refute the former president Thomas Jefferson&#x27;s theories of race, as expressed in his well-known &quot;Notes on the State of Virginia&quot; (1785). Dr. Vanessa Northington Gamble, a medical physician and historian at George Washington University, in 2010 noted: &quot;As early as 1859, Dr. McCune Smith said that race was not biological but was a social category.&quot; He commented on the positive ways that ethnic Africans would influence U.S. culture and society, in music, dance, food, and other elements. His collected essays, speeches, and letters have been published as &quot;The Works of James McCune Smith: Black Intellectual and Abolitionist&quot; (2006), edited by John Stauffer.

=== Later years and death ===
In 1863, Smith was appointed as professor of anthropology at Wilberforce College, the first African American-owned and operated college in the United States. Smith was too ill to take the position. He died two years later, on November 17, 1865, at the age of 52, from congestive heart failure. This was nineteen days before ratification of the Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution that abolished slavery. He was buried at Cypress Hills Cemetery in Brooklyn. Smith was survived by his widow, Malvina, and five children.

To escape racial discrimination and have more opportunities, his children passed into white society: the four surviving sons married white spouses; his unmarried daughter lived with a brother. They worked as teachers, a lawyer, and as business people. Smith&#x27;s unique achievements as a pioneering African-American physician were rediscovered by twentieth-century historians. They were relearned by his descendants in the twenty-first century, who identified as white and did not know about him, when a great-great-great-granddaughter took a history class and found his name in her grandmother&#x27;s family bible. In 2010, several Smith descendants commissioned a new tombstone for his grave in Brooklyn and gathered to honor him and their African-American ancestry.

=== Honors and legacy ===
In November 2018, the New York Academy of Medicine (NYAM) posthumously inducted Smith as a fellow of the academy, 171 years after his nomination and 153 years after his death. At the 2018 Discourse and Awards ceremony, NYAM President Judith Salerno presented a replica certificate of fellowship to Professor Joanne Edey-Rhodes, who accepted on behalf of Smith&#x27;s descendants. In 2019, the academy also formally unveiled a portrait of Smith, commissioned by Academy Fellow Dr. Daniel Laroche and painted by artist Junior Jacques. It now is on display at the academy.

The University of Glasgow, Smith&#x27;s alma mater, has named its new Learning Hub building the James McCune Smith Learning Hub and it opened to students early in 2021. The university has also established a scholarship and an annual lecture named after Smith.

<doc id="368046" wikidata="Q8189896" url="?curid=368046" title="Gridlock">
<text>Gridlock is a form of traffic congestion where continuous queues of vehicles block an entire network of intersecting streets, bringing traffic in all directions to a complete standstill. The term originates from a situation possible in a grid plan where intersections are blocked, preventing vehicles from either moving forwards through the intersection or backing up to an upstream intersection.

The term &quot;gridlock&quot; is also used incorrectly to describe high traffic congestion with minimal flow (which is simply a traffic jam), where a blocked grid system is not involved. By extension, the term has been applied to situations in other fields where flow is stalled by excess demand, or in which competing interests prevent progress.

==Cause==
Traditional gridlock is caused by cars entering an intersection on a green light without enough room on the other side of the intersection &quot;at the time of entering&quot; to go all the way through. This can lead to the car being trapped in the intersection when the light turns green in the other direction. If the same situation occurs simultaneously in multiple intersections, these cars can be trapped in the intersections indefinitely.

In many jurisdictions, drivers are therefore prohibited from entering an intersection at a green light if there is no room for them to clear the intersection. If all drivers follow this rule, gridlock is impossible.

Another type of gridlock can occur during traffic surges between highway on-ramps and off-ramps located within a quarter mile of each other. Traffic exiting the highway may back up and block the entering vehicles. Those entering vehicles in turn back up and block the exiting vehicles.

Gridlock is sometimes cited as an example of the prisoner&#x27;s dilemma (from game theory). Mutual cooperation among drivers would give the maximum benefit (prevention of gridlock), but this may not happen because of the desire to maximize one&#x27;s own benefit (shortest travel time) given the uncertainty about the other drivers&#x27; commitment to equal cooperation.

==Enforcement==

===New York City===
In New York City, drivers who &quot;block the box&quot; are subject to a moving violation that comes with a US$90.00 penalty. Mayor Michael Bloomberg, noting that the ten-minute ticketing process actually contributes to overall traffic congestion, has asked the New York State Legislature to remove &quot;blocking the box&quot; from the moving violation category. This reclassification would give more traffic agents authority to write tickets and change the current ticketing procedure, which requires that the issuing officer physically stop the violating car in traffic.

===Virginia Beach, Virginia===
In Virginia Beach, Virginia, roads around the oceanfront feature signs at every intersection stating &quot;Don&#x27;t Block the Box&quot;, and threatening a $200 fine.

===Texas===
In Austin, Texas, a &quot;Don&#x27;t Block the Box&quot; initiative began in 2015. A similar program was piloted in San Antonio in 2017.

==Effects==
The obvious effects are driver frustration and trip delay. Another effect in cities is exacerbated by the presence of urban street canyons, which effectively trap air pollution and increase air pollution exposures of motorists as well as the general urban population. Noise pollution can be aggravated by excessive starting and stopping noise of gridlocked facilities.

==Alleviating gridlock==
To make a traffic system less susceptible to gridlock, a traffic metering system can be introduced. These systems determine the optimal number of vehicles allowed in a traffic system, and prevent any extra vehicles from entering. This can be done with traffic control devices, such as traffic lights or warning signs, or a better public transportation system. This type of system is used in Zurich, Switzerland.

==Etymology==
According to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, the word &quot;gridlock&quot; was coined in New York City in the early 1970s. The word appeared in an IEEE publication in 1971 in a different context. The first appearances of &quot;gridlock&quot; in newspapers occurred during the 1980 New York City transit strike. The word is attributed to Sam Schwartz, who was then the chief traffic engineer for the New York City Department of Transportation at the time of the strike. Schwartz said the word &quot;gridlock&quot; was used internally in his department during the 1970s, perhaps as early as 1971. Writing up a memo of emergency recommendations for senior officials, he recalled the words of a colleague several years earlier who had been analyzing a proposal to close Broadway to vehicular traffic. His colleague gave the plan the thumbs-down, worrying that it would simply &quot;lock up the grid&quot;. Schwartz was always struck by that image and titled his 1980 memo &quot;Gridlock Prevention Plan&quot;. In another interview Mr. Schwartz said that he coined the term in the mid 1970s with fellow traffic engineer, Roy Cottam, who &quot;was a little paranoid and thought he would be blamed for gridlock and so he gave me all the credit&quot;.

<text>In various cultures, a middle name is a portion of a personal name that is written between a person&#x27;s given name and surname.
A middle name is often abbreviated and is then called middle initial or just initial.

A person may be given a middle name regardless of whether it is necessary to distinguish them from other people with the same given name and surname. In cultures where a given name is expected to precede the surname, additional names are likely to be placed after the given name and before the surname, and thus called middle names.

==Usage in various languages==
===English===
Among royalty and aristocracy, middle names have been used since the late 17th century (and possibly earlier), as exemplified in the name of the Stuart pretender James Francis Edward Stuart (1688–1766). Despite their relatively long existence in North America, the term &quot;middle name&quot; was not recorded until 1835, in the periodical &quot;Harvardiana&quot;.

Not every name that stands as the middle word in a three-name string is a middle name. Major classes of this theme are as follows:
* When part of a two-word given name: for example, &quot;Mary Anne&quot; and &quot;Jo Anne&quot;. 
* When part of a two-word surname, that is, a compound surname: for example, David Lloyd George or Henry Bence Jones, whose surnames are open compounds (that is, &quot;Bence&quot; is not his middle name; &quot;Bence Jones&quot; is his compound surname). 
* A maiden name expressed: for example, Hillary Clinton (&quot;née&quot; Rodham) is sometimes known as &quot;Hillary Rodham Clinton&quot;. 
* A patronymic in any of various Slavic languages, including Russian and Bulgarian, such as &quot;Nikita Sergeyevich Khrushchev&quot;, is not normally considered a middle name. Russian language and culture has certain norms for when someone is to be called by their given name plus patronymic versus a title plus the surname (for example, &quot;Nikita Sergeyevich&quot; versus &quot;Mr. Khrushchev&quot;). The distinction is similar to the T–V distinction. See also eastern Slavic naming customs. 
* Traditional Québécois names: Traditionally, Roman Catholic Québécois, Franco-Ontarian, and Franco-Manitoban children were given three names, the first being Joseph or Marie, the second the godfather&#x27;s or godmother&#x27;s name, and the third the name chosen by the parents for the child. Examples include Jean Chrétien (Joseph Jacques Jean Chrétien) and Gabrielle Roy (Marie Rose Emma Gabrielle Roy). Some children (especially those with English mothers) were given extra names that could serve as middle names in the anglophone tradition; for example, Pierre Elliott Trudeau (Joseph Philippe Pierre Yves Elliott Trudeau). These traditions became less common after the Quiet Revolution.

In the United States, the middle name is often abbreviated to the middle initial (e.g. Mary Lee Bianchi becomes Mary L. Bianchi). This is usually standard for signatures or omitted entirely in everyday use (e.g. just Mary Bianchi). An individual may have more than one middle name, or none. In the United Kingdom, for comparison, she would usually be referred to as either Mary Bianchi, M. L. Bianchi, or Mary Lee Bianchi, or she may choose Lee Bianchi, and informally there may be familiar shortenings.

In countries that primarily speak English—such as Australia, Canada, Ireland, New Zealand, the United States, and the United Kingdom—the forename of a relative is sometimes used as one&#x27;s middle name to honor familial heritage. Typical examples are a father named John William Smith whose son is named Thomas John Smith or a grandmother named Mary Grace Tilley whose granddaughter is named Ashley Mary Smith. In many cases in the United States, however, a person&#x27;s middle name does not derive from relatives, but is used instead to honor close family friends or notable public figures. A rare case of an individual being given only an initial as a middle name, with the initial not explicitly standing for anything, was Harry S. Truman. (He once told reporters—apparently at odds with his own practice—that the S should thus not be followed by a period.) Other people with single-letter middle names include Robert B. Hollander Jr. and Mark M Davis.

More than two given names are fairly common. In Britain, they are traditionally more common among the upper and middle classes.

There is a minor tradition in English-speaking countries whereby maiden names from the family tree that are especially celebrated by the family are carried into succeeding generations as middle names or as given names, whereas the tradition of married names would otherwise obliterate them. For example, this is how the first name of Johns Hopkins came to have the terminal &quot;-s&quot; that differentiates it from &quot;John&quot;; &quot;Johns&quot; was the surname of some of his ancestors. It is also how Robert Strange McNamara got his middle name (it was his mother&#x27;s maiden name). There is some overlap between open-compound surnames and maiden-names-as-middle-names; in various cases the same motivation (preserving maiden names from oblivion) has produced both such kinds of names, and there are instances from the nineteenth century that are ambiguous today as to how the bearers of a name thus inspired parsed it themselves (either as part of a compound surname or as a middle name). 

The abbreviation &quot;N.M.N.&quot; (no middle name) or &quot;N.M.I.&quot; (no middle initial), with or without periods, is sometimes used in formal documents in the United States, where a middle initial or name is expected but the person does not have one. Rarely a person may adopt a middle initial to overcome the problems imposed by systems whose design failed to properly handle the absence of one, or to ensure uniqueness. For example, screenwriter David X. Cohen was born David Samuel Cohen, but adopted the middle initial &quot;X&quot; when he joined the Writers Guild of America, as there was already a member named David S. Cohen, and the union forbid multiple writers from using the same name.

A middle name that is rather unusual among English speakers is that of Jennifer 8. Lee, an American author. Lee was not given a middle name at birth so she chose &quot;8&quot; when she was a teenager, in a nod to her Chinese ancestry; in Chinese culture, the number eight symbolizes prosperity and good luck. 

====Middle name as primary forename====
In England and the United States, some who choose to be known primarily by their middle name abbreviate their first name as an initial, e.g. J(ohn) Edgar Hoover, J(ohn) Paul Getty, J(ulius) Robert Oppenheimer and F(rancis) Scott (Key) Fitzgerald. 

Others simply omit the first name in regular usage, treating their middle name like a first name, e.g. (Thomas) Woodrow Wilson. Many politicians use their middle name or its shortened version as a first name—for example, (Addison) Mitch(ell) McConnell, (Willard) Mitt Romney, (Thomas) Jon(athan) Ossoff, (Raymond) Jon Tester, (Rafael Edward) Ted Cruz and (Marion Michael) Mike Rounds are all U.S. senators who use their middle names as first names. In the U.K., many politicians, including several prime ministers, have been known primarily by their middle name, or one of their middle names. The ten prime ministers to have done so are (Andrew) Bonar Law, (James) Ramsay MacDonald, (Arthur) Neville Chamberlain, (Robert) Anthony Eden, (Maurice) Harold Macmillan, (James) Harold Wilson, (Leonard) James Callaghan, (James) Gordon Brown, (Alexander) Boris (de Pfeffel) Johnson, and (Mary Elizabeth) Liz Truss.

===Indian languages===
Traditional names in India vary regionally due to its ethnic and religious diversity. Modern Hindu names across India adopt a first name, which is usually a word in Sanskrit or an indigenous Indian language, a middle name (on rare instances), which is usually the name of a child&#x27;s father or spouse in case of a married lady followed by the surname which is usually the caste that the person&#x27;s family belongs to, usually taken from the father or husband. However, diversity exists even here, for instance middle and last names from the traditionally matrilineal Nair community in Kerala are based on the mother&#x27;s family. For example, in the case of the well-known statesman, V. K. Krishna Menon, his first name would be Krishna, the V stands for Vengyalil, which is a well known aristocratic Nair family from Kerala that Krishna&#x27;s mother belonged to, the K stands for Krishnan, his father&#x27;s name and the surname is Menon, one of the Nair subcastes. In modern times, this name would perhaps be styled as Krishna Vengyalil Krishnan Menon, in that order, Vengyalil Krishnan being the middle name. Traditionally the Dalit population of India were excluded from India&#x27;s caste system and do not have a middle name and a caste surname. The same is true for people who have given up their caste identity, whose name just includes the person&#x27;s first name followed by their father&#x27;s name. Sometimes, the place of birth of an individual is included as their middle name.

Among the Sikhs of India, many have adopted the middle name Singh or Kaur which mean lion and princess respectively. This is followed by their Punjabi caste surname. Nowadays, many Sikhs have done away with their caste surname and have just kept Singh or Kaur as their surname.

Among Indian Muslims, similar naming conventions to Hindus and Sikhs are followed, but the names are usually in Arabic, Persian or Urdu.

==Usage in various regions==
===Philippines===
Middle names constitute the mother&#x27;s maiden surname; is inserted between the given name and the surname (father&#x27;s surname) and almost always abbreviated signifying that it is a &quot;middle name&quot;. 

For example; given the name Jose Patricio Santos. This is usually abbreviated to Jose P. Santos. The abbreviated &quot;P&quot; signifies it is the maternal maiden surname.
If a person has two given names, Jonathan Jose P. Santos, the abbreviated &quot;P&quot; will represent the mother&#x27;s surname. The given name would therefore be Jonathan Jose. The second name &quot;Jose&quot; is never classified as a middle name. There have been a few documented exceptions, such as Benigno S. Aquino III, Jose P. Laurel, and Manuel L. Quezon, whose Western-style middle initials actually stand for their second given names Simeon, Paciano, and Luis respectively.

===Scandinavia===
The naming conventions of the Scandinavian countries do not call given names middle names. While extra first names often are referred to as middle names in everyday language, the laws in those countries do not reflect that and consider all of them first names. A person can have multiple first names, but usually, only one of them is used in addressing the person. A passport contains all names, but all except the surname are listed as first/given names. Names combined with a hyphen are counted as one name. A person named &quot;Ulrika Britt-Inger Marie Fredriksson&quot; has three first names and one last name, and this individual could choose to go by any of those three first names.

Unlike the middle names in some English-speaking countries that are used as initials, the additional first names are usually either spelled out in full or fully omitted. Together with a person&#x27;s personal identification number in Sweden, Denmark, Norway, or Iceland, only signing with the name of address and the last name is usually sufficient for almost all legal documents. A person can change the name they go by to one of the other already given names without applying for a name change. It is possible to apply to have the order swapped if desired, as the first of the first names will be assumed to be the name of address.

In Denmark, Norway, and Sweden, the legal term middle name refers most often to names that were originally surnames, but not part of the last name of the name bearer. A middle name could be one&#x27;s mother&#x27;s maiden name or the last name of another recent ancestor (for instance a grandparent). 

In the example Carl Viggo Manthey Lange, the names Carl and Viggo are given names, while Manthey is a middle name and Lange is the family name. Manthey is his mother&#x27;s maiden name. Unless his full name is used, he is correctly referred to as Mr. Lange, not as Mr. Manthey Lange. 

In Sweden, however, although middle names were introduced in the Name Act of 1963, later called &quot;tilläggsnamn&quot; (added name), and then &quot;mellannamn&quot; (middle name) in the Name Act of 1983, the Name act of 2017 removed the term entirely. Existing last-name middle names may still be used, but can no longer be added.

Occasionally, Scandinavians choose to use their middle name as their surname in everyday life. So Per Gottfrid Svartholm Warg has Per and Gottfrid as his given names, where Gottfrid, not Per, is his name of address, Svartholm as his middle name and Warg as his last name, but in practice he uses Svartholm as a surname.

===Vietnam===
Traditional middle names in Vietnamese are &quot;Văn&quot; for male names and &quot;Thị&quot; for female names. However, modern Vietnamese do not consider these to be attractive names, especially &quot;Thị&quot;. Therefore, nowadays popular middle names also are popular first names. Middle names play an important role in Vietnamese full names; they could help create beautiful names when combined with first names, distinguishing people who have the same first name (there are many common last names in Vietnam), and also distinguishing the gender of the names (unisex names are used widely in Vietnam). Hence, Vietnamese rarely abbreviate their middle names.

<text>The Lord&#x27;s Resistance Army insurgency is an ongoing conflict between the Lord&#x27;s Resistance Army (LRA), a Ugandan militant religious extremist group, against the government of Uganda. Following the Ugandan Civil War, militant Joseph Kony formed the Lord&#x27;s Resistance Army and launched an insurgency against the newly installed President Yoweri Museveni. The stated goal was to establish a Christian state based on the Ten Commandments. Currently, there is low-level LRA activity in eastern areas of the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the Central African Republic. Kony proclaims himself the &#x27;spokesperson&#x27; of God and a spirit medium.

The insurgency has become one of Africa&#x27;s longest conflicts and has resulted in a lasting humanitarian crisis. The LRA has been accused by the International Criminal Court of widespread human rights violations, including mutilation, torture, slavery, rape, the abduction of civilians, the use of child soldiers, and a number of massacres. By 2004, the LRA had abducted more than 20,000 children, caused the displacement of 1.5 million civilians, and killed an estimation of 100,000 civilians.

==Background==
The National Resistance Army (NRA), commanded by Yoweri Museveni, overthrew President Tito Okello in January 1986. In retaliation for the Ugandan Army&#x27;s actions in the Luwero triangle, the NRA committed numerous acts of brutality against the Acholi. Fearing the loss of their customary dominance over the national military, some Acholis rebelled. By August, the northern districts held by the new government forces had erupted into a full-fledged popular insurrection.

==Timeline==
===Early history (1987–1994)===
In January 1987, Joseph Kony made his first appearance as a spirit medium, one of many who emerged following the initial success of the Holy Spirit Movement of Alice Auma. 

Former Uganda People&#x27;s Democratic Army commander Odong Latek convinced Kony to adopt conventional guerrilla warfare tactics, primarily surprise attacks on civilian targets, such as villages. The LRA also occasionally carried out large-scale attacks to underline the inability of the government to protect the populace. Until 1991, the LRA raided the populace for supplies, which were carried away by villagers who were abducted for short periods of time. The fact that some NRA units were known for their brutal actions ensured that the LRA were given at least passive support by segments of the Acholi population.

March 1991 saw the start of &quot;Operation North&quot;, which combined efforts to destroy the LRA while cutting away its roots of support among the population through heavy-handed tactics. As part of Operation North, Acholi Betty Oyella Bigombe, the Minister charged with ending the insurgency, created the Arrow Boys, a local militia mostly armed with bows, arrows, and other traditional weapons as a form of local defense. As the LRA was armed with modern weaponry, the Arrow Boys were severely underpowered.

The creation of the Arrow Groups angered Kony, who began to feel that he no longer had the support of the population. In response, the LRA mutilated numerous Acholi whom they believed to be government supporters. While the government efforts were a failure, the LRA reaction caused many Acholi to finally turn against the insurgency. However, this was tempered by the deep-seated antagonism towards the occupying government forces.

Following Operation North, Bigombe initiated the first face-to-face meeting between representatives of the LRA and the government. The LRA asked for a general amnesty for their combatants and stated that they would not surrender but were willing to &quot;return home.&quot; However, the government&#x27;s stance was hampered by disagreement over the credibility of the LRA negotiators and political infighting. In particular, the military had learned that Kony was negotiating with the Sudanese government for support while talking to Bigombe and felt that Kony was simply trying to buy time.

At a second meeting on 10 January 1994, Kony asked for six months to regroup his troops. By early February the tone of the negotiations was growing increasingly acrimonious, and following a meeting on 2 February, the LRA broke off negotiations stating that they felt that the NRA was trying to entrap them. Four days later, President Yoweri Museveni announced a seven-day deadline for the LRA to surrender. This ultimatum ended the Bigombe Initiative.

===Spillover into neighboring countries (1994–2002)===

Two weeks after Museveni delivered his ultimatum of 6 February 1994, it was reported that LRA fighters had crossed the northern border and established bases in southern Sudan with the approval of the Khartoum government. Sudanese aid was a response to Ugandan support for the rebel Sudan People&#x27;s Liberation Army (SPLA) fighting in the civil war in the south of the country. Also, convinced that the Acholi were now collaborating with the Museveni government, Kony began to target civilians with his increased military strength. Mutilations became commonplace (especially cutting off ears, lips, and nose), and 1994 saw the first mass abduction of children and youth.

The most infamous of these was the Aboke abductions of 139 female students in October 1996. As most of the LRA combatants are abducted children, a military offensive against the LRA is widely perceived by the Acholi as a massacre of victims. Government attempts to destroy the rebels are thus viewed as another cause for grievance by the Acholi. The moral ambiguity of this situation, in which abducted young rebels are both the victims and perpetrators of brutal acts, is central to the conflicted attitudes of many Acholi towards the rebels.

The government&#x27;s response was a scorched-earth policy ordering all Acholis to leave their homes in 48 hours and move to &quot;protected villages&quot; beginning in 1996, later called Internally Displaced People&#x27;s Camps. This further deepened the antagonistic attitude that many Acholi had toward the government, especially as the population continued to be attacked by the LRA even within the &quot;protected camps.&quot; The camps were crowded, unsanitary, miserable places to live and have been described as death camps. World Health Organization data indicated that these camps caused the death of ten times as many people as the LRA.

Meanwhile, in 1997 the Sudanese government of the National Islamic Front began to recede from its previous hardline stance. Following the 11 September 2001 attacks in the US, the relationship between Sudan and Uganda abruptly changed. Cross-border tensions eased as support to proxy forces fell. Some of the hundreds of thousands of civilians displaced by the war began to return home. The number of people displaced by the conflict declined to about half a million, and people began to talk openly about the day when the &quot;protected camps&quot; would be disbanded.

===Operation Iron Fist and continued insurgency (2002–2005)===

In March 2002, the Uganda People&#x27;s Defence Force (UPDF) launched a massive military offensive, named &quot;Operation Iron Fist&quot;, against the LRA bases in southern Sudan, with agreement from the National Islamic Front. This agreement, coupled with the return of Ugandan forces that were deployed in the Democratic Republic of Congo upon the official end of the Second Congo War, created what the Ugandan government felt was an ideal situation in which to end a conflict that had become both an embarrassment and political liability. After several months of uncertainty, LRA forces began crossing back into Uganda and carrying out attacks on a scale of brutality not seen since 1995 to 1996, resulting in widespread displacement and suffering in regions, such as Soroti, that had never previously been touched by the insurgency.

A series of local initiatives spearheaded by traditional and religious leaders as well as diplomatic initiatives during these years failed, especially since Kony&#x27;s negotiating position remained uncertain, but the conflict gained unprecedented international coverage. During a November 2003 field visit to Uganda, United Nations Undersecretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator Jan Egeland stated, &quot;I cannot find any other part of the world that is having an emergency on the scale of Uganda, that is getting such little international attention.&quot; In December 2003, Ugandan President Museveni referred the LRA to the International Criminal Court (ICC) to determine if the LRA is guilty of international war crimes.

From the middle of 2004 on, rebel activity dropped markedly under intense military pressure. The government was also the target of increasingly pointed criticism from the international community for its failure to end the conflict. International aid agencies questioned the Ugandan government&#x27;s reliance on military force and its commitment to a peaceful resolution. The army also admitted that it had recruited child soldiers who escaped the LRA into the military.

In mid-September 2005, a band of LRA fighters, led by Vincent Otti, crossed into the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) for the first time. President Museveni declared that, if Congolese authorities did not disarm the LRA combatants, the UPDF would be sent across the border in pursuit. This sparked a diplomatic row between the governments of the DRC and Uganda, with both militaries making a show of force along their border, while the Congolese ambassador to the United Nations sent a letter to the UN Secretary-General demanding that an economic embargo be placed on Uganda in retaliation.

===Peace talks and truce (2006–2008)===

A series of meetings were held in Juba starting in July 2006 between the government of Uganda and the LRA. The talks were mediated by Riek Machar, the Vice President of Southern Sudan, and by the Community of Sant&#x27;Egidio. The talks, which resulted in a ceasefire by September 2006, were described as the best chance for a negotiated settlement since the peace initiative of Betty Bigombe in 1994.

These talks were agreed to after Joseph Kony released a video in May in which he denied committing atrocities and seemed to call for an end to hostilities, in response to an announcement by Museveni that he would guarantee the safety of Kony if peace was agreed to by July. In late June 2006, the Government of Southern Sudan formally invited Uganda to attend peace talks, and on 14 July 2006, talks began in Juba. On 4 August 2006, Vincent Otti declared a unilateral ceasefire and asked the Ugandan government to reciprocate. ICC indictee Raska Lukwiya was killed in battle on 12 August 2006.

The government and the LRA signed a truce on 26 August 2006. Under the terms of the agreement, LRA forces will leave Uganda and gather in two assembly areas protected by the government of Sudan. The Ugandan government agreed not to attack those areas. LRA rebels had begun gathering in the assembly areas by mid-September. Talks continued to be hindered by demands and counter-demands. Meanwhile, the government began a process of creating &quot;satellite camps&quot; to decongest the main IDP camps.

In a broader context, the government of Southern Sudan viewed the talks as a means of ridding itself of a foreign army that was complicating its delicate relationship with the Khartoum government. The request by the Ugandan Government for the ICC to suspend war crimes indictments against leaders of the LRA was condemned by international human rights groups but largely supported by leaders and civilians within northern Uganda.

By mid-2007, thousands of IDPs had moved into the decongestion camps. However, the populace remained cautious about the prospect of a peace deal, with many refusing to return to their ancestral homes before a definitive end to the insurgency.

Following a period in which the peace talks were suspended, the Juba Initiative Project enabled the resumption of the talks in May 2007, thanks to the efforts of the United Nations Special Representative of the Secretary-General for LRA-affected areas, Joaquim Chissano. The talks were again mediated by the Government of Southern Sudan, but with the support of the United Nations and logistic facilitation from the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA).

On 20 August 2007, Uganda declared that it was seeking legal advice on setting up a war crimes court. In November 2007, an LRA delegation led by Martin Ojul journeyed to Kampala to restate its commitment to a peaceful resolution of the conflict. Ojul later led the delegation on a tour of northern Uganda to meet victims of the insurgency and ask their forgiveness. However, reports surfaced that LRA deputy commander Otti had been executed on or around 8 October 2007 over an internal power struggle with Kony.

===Renewed fighting (2008–present)===
In February 2008, LRA launched its first known attack in the Central African Republic in Bassigbiri, Haut-Mbomou. In the next month, LRA raided the first major town in Haut-Mbomou, Obo.

In June 2008, diplomats reported that the Lord&#x27;s Resistance Army had bought new weapons and was recruiting new soldiers, adding 1,000 recruits to the 600 soldiers it already had. At about the same time, Uganda, South Sudan, and Congo-Kinshasa agreed to a plan to crush the movement together; the South Sudanese Government claimed that the Lord&#x27;s Resistance Army killed 14 of their soldiers in a raid on June 7 2008, in Nabanga, DR Congo. 

The LRA was alleged to have killed at least 400 people in attacks on a number of villages in the DR Congo on and after Christmas Day, 2008. Throughout 2009, the LRA was blamed for several attacks in Southern Sudan, DR Congo, and Central African Republic. In March 2010, news emerged about a December 2009 massacre in DR Congo perpetrated by the LRA.

In May 2010, US President Barack Obama signed the Lord&#x27;s Resistance Army Disarmament and Northern Uganda Recovery Act into law. In October 2011, Obama announced the deployment of 100 US troops to aid other anti-LRA forces in subduing LRA leader Joseph Kony, citing the aforementioned act in a letter to the heads of both houses of Congress.

On 23 March 2012, the African Union announced its intentions to send an international brigade of 5,000 military troops &quot;from Uganda, South Sudan, Central African Republic, and Congo, countries where Kony&#x27;s reign of terror has been felt over the years ... to join the hunt for rebel leader Joseph Kony and to &quot;neutralize&quot; him. According to the statement, &quot;the mission would commence on 24 March 2012 and the search would last until Kony was caught&quot;, after which the task force would be disbanded. The effort is Ugandan-led and backed by the US with the 100 advisers already there, who are offering advice, intelligence and training, along with equipment. The brigade established its headquarters in Yambio, South Sudan, close to the border with the DRC, and is commanded by a Ugandan officer; while, a Congolese officer has oversight of intelligence operations.

On 12 May 2012, Ugandan soldiers with the African Union brigade captured a senior LRA leader in the Central African Republic (CAR), Caesar Achellam, a veteran rebel commander with the rank of Major General. Because he was a leading military strategist for the LRA, Achellam&#x27;s arrest signified a considerable setback for Joseph Kony&#x27;s fight to evade capture.

On 6 June, the UN secretary-general, Ban Ki-moon, released an initial report covering the activities of the LRA from 2009 to 2012. The report itself stated that &quot;at least 45 children have been killed and maimed&quot; during this time period and at least &quot;591 children, including 268 girls have been abducted&quot;. Though it was noted by Radhika Coomaraswamy, the UN special representative on children and conflict, that the &quot;actual numbers of abductions are much higher, these are just the ones we are aware of&quot;. The report also stated that the LRA is currently made up of between 300 and 500 fighters, with around half of them being children.

The LRA was reported to be in the East CAR town of Djema in 2012 but forces pursuing the LRA withdrew in April 2013 after the government of the CAR was overthrown by the Séléka Coalition rebels. In November 2013, Kony was reported to be in poor health in the East CAR town of Nzoka and Michel Djotodia, president of the CAR, claimed he was negotiating with Kony to surrender. US officials doubted that Kony genuinely wanted to surrender.

In early November 2013, suspected LRA militants attacked five villages in the Western Equatoria region of South Sudan. Three people were killed and one wounded, aside from looting the rebels also set fire to several houses.

On 4 December 2013, 13 LRA militants including senior commander Samuel Kangu were killed in the aftermath of a UPDF ambush in CAR. The rebels were reportedly tracked with the aid of US-provided intelligence.

On 11 December 2013, 19 LRA guerrillas surrendered to African Union troops in Zembio, CAR.

According to UN estimates, at least 65 LRA attacks took place in CAR and DRC during the first quarter of 2014 during which 93 people were reportedly abducted and two killed.

On 7 May 2014, United Nations secretary-general Ban Ki-moon stated that senior LRA commanders were stationed in South Sudan&#x27;s border areas with Sudan and the Central African Republic.

On 20 May 2014, delegates from Uganda, DRC, South Sudan and CAR held a three-day conference in South Sudan regarding the LRA insurgency.

On 13 August 2014, LRA insurgents launched attacks on villages in the vicinity of Billi, DRC, killing 4 people and injuring 2. FARDC troops clashed with the militants before the latter retreated.

On 23 August 2014, 13 LRA hostages escaped from captivity, six days later 12 more hostages followed suit. The escapees were abducted between 2004 and August 2014, and managed to reach Digba and Ango, DRC, respectively, following a FARDC offensive.

Between 28 and 31 December 2014, LRA perpetrated three attacks in the area of Dungu, DRC. Two people were wounded in the aftermath of an attack on Faradje, the village of Mangasaba was looted, and a merchant from Kiliwa was also robbed by the guerrillas.

On 9 January 2015, LRA&#x27;s second in command Dominic Ongwen surrendered to US troops stationed in CAR. He claimed to have defected from the Ugandan rebellion. U.S. State Department spokeswoman Jennifer Psaki commented saying, &quot; his defection would be a historic blow to the LRA&#x27;s command structure.&quot;

On 15 January 2015, LRA rebels conducted a number of kidnappings in the villages of Bulumasi and Pangali, Bondo territory, DRC. A total of 10 people were taken hostage during the incident.

On 21 January 2015, LRA militants killed three FARDC soldiers in the aftermath of an ambush conducted at the town of Nangume in the vicinity of Wando, DRC. Dozens of civilians were wounded, three were abducted and two hundred families were also displaced from the area following raids LRA militants.

On 5 February 2015, a band of twenty suspected LRA guerrillas abducted eight people and engaged in looting in the villages of Dizaga and Digba, DRC.

On 16 February 2015, LRA guerrillas killed three people and injured four others, on Road IV, located in the Dungu territory, DRC.
On 12 April 2015, a total of 8 FARDC soldiers went missing in action, following a LRA ambush outside the Mangbangu village, DRC. An unidentified corpse was found in the area, a day after the incident.

On 30 March 2017, the United States Military announced it was ending its anti-LRA campaign, Operation Observant Compass.

On an unspecified date in April 2017, a United States special forces soldier shot and killed an LRA fighter who drew a weapon on the American. The American had been escorting an African Union peacekeeper when the incident occurred.

On 19 April 2017, Uganda announced that it would begin withdrawing forces from the Central African Republic where it has been trying to hunt down Joseph Kony in the country for 9 years.

On 6 May 2021, LRA commander Dominic Ongwen was sentenced to 25 years in Ugandan prison over war crimes and crimes against humanity in Uganda.

On 7 April 2024 Russian mercenaries from the Wagner Group conducted an operation in the Haute-Kotto prefecture near the town of Sam Ouandja to apprehend the leader of the Lord&#x27;s Resistance Army, Joseph Kony. While managing to kill some fighters, the operation failed to find the group leader due to him earlier leaving for another base.

== Impact ==
The insurgency was historically confined to the region known as Acholiland, consisting of the districts of Kitgum, Gulu, and Pader, though since 2002 violence has overflowed into other Ugandan districts. The LRA also operated across the porous border region with Southern Sudan and most recently into the north-eastern Ituri Province of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The plight of the affected people has received little media coverage in the developed world. Not until April 2004 did the UN Security Council issue a formal condemnation. A 2005 poll of humanitarian professionals, media personalities, academics and activists identified the conflict in the north of Uganda as the second worst &quot;forgotten&quot; humanitarian emergency in the world, after the conflicts of the neighbouring DRC.

The US government estimates that up to 12,000 people have been killed in the violence, with many more dying from disease and malnutrition as a direct result of the conflict. Nearly two million civilians have been forced to flee their homes, living in internally displaced person (IDP) camps and within the safety of larger settlements, sleeping on street corners and in other public spaces. The problems of the camps have been expatiated by the government ordering villagers into the camps on pain of being classified as rebels and on occasion shelling those villages who refused to relocate.

While many abductees are taken to carry items looted from raided villages, some are also used as soldiers and sex slaves. The group performs abductions primarily from the Acholi people, who have borne the brunt of the 18-year LRA campaign. The United Nations estimated in the mid-2000s that around 25,000 children have been kidnapped by the LRA since 1987. However, several pieces of research have concluded that the figure was significantly higher. In June 2007, UC Berkeley&#x27;s Human Rights Center researchers worked with reception centers in northern Uganda to compile a database of 25,000 former abductees that went through reception centers.

By triangulating data from different sources on the number of former abductees, the research conservatively estimates that the LRA has abducted 24,000 to 38,000 children and 28,000 to 37,000 adults as of April 2006. The research further found that while women represented only about a third of all the abductees, they tended to stay longer with the LRA compared to men. Women are forced to serve as sexual and domestic servants. According to a survey of 750 youth in Kitgum and Pader, at least 66,000 youth between the ages of 13 and 30 have been abducted. One-third of all boys and one-sixth of all girls had been taken for at least one day.

Of these, 66% of males were taken for longer than two weeks, while the equivalent number for females was 46%. If a female was gone for more than two weeks, there was a one in four chance that she had not returned. Males were again found to be taken for longer periods of time on average, with two in five males that were abducted for more than two weeks not having returned. The number of abductions was greatest in 2002 and 2003, perhaps in retaliation for Operation Iron Fist. However, the average age of abductees has risen from about 13 in 1994 to nearly 18 in 2004, coinciding with the rise in number, and fall in length, of abductions.

While the LRA now appears to consist of less than two thousand combatants that are under intense pressure from the Ugandan military, the government has been unable to end the insurgency to date. Ongoing peace negotiations are complicated by an investigation and trial preparation by the International Criminal Court. Meanwhile, military operation is going on. The conflict continues to slow down Uganda&#x27;s development efforts, costing the poor country&#x27;s economy a cumulative total of at least $1.33 billion, which is equivalent to 3% of GDP, or $100 million annually.

===&quot;Night commuters&quot;===

At the height of the conflict, each night, as many as 40,000 children children between the ages of 8 and 14, referred to as &quot;night commuters&quot; or &quot;night dwellers,&quot; would walk up to from IDP camps to larger towns, especially Gulu, in search of safety and to avoid abduction by the LRA. Refuge was offered at churches, hospitals, bus stations and temporary shelters before the children returned home again each morning. Because of this phenomenon, religious leaders from different denominations staged a one-week solidarity demonstration by sleeping in the streets with the children, which generated further attention of the conflict from the world.

===Awareness===
Initiatives to raise international awareness for these children included the &quot;GuluWalk&quot; and the work of the Resolve Uganda. Night commuters are also the subject of documentaries such as &quot;Stolen Children&quot;, &quot;War/Dance&quot;, and &quot;Invisible Children&quot;.

The &quot;Invisible Children&quot; documentary sponsored the Global Night Commute, an event similar to GuluWalk. On 29 April 2006, over 80,000 youths from around the world converged on urban centers in 130 major cities around the world in solidarity with displaced Ugandan children. The Invisible Children organization also raised awareness for those in the Internally Displaced Camps (IDPs) through its &quot;Displace Me&quot; event held in 15 cities across the US on 28 April 2007. Over 68,000 people participated in the event which required participants to sleep outside in &quot;homes&quot; made out of cardboard, similar to those in the IDPs.

Another program, The Name Campaign, asks people to wear nameplate necklaces imprinted with the first name of one of the thousands of abducted children as a means of raising public awareness.

Danny Glover and Don Cheadle have both been vocal advocates on behalf of the children of Northern Uganda.

On 5 March 2012, the Invisible Children organization posted the &quot;Kony 2012&quot; video on YouTube which was widely seen. As of 22 March, 2023, the film had over 103 million views on video-sharing website YouTube.

<text>Robert Lawrence Stine (; born October 8, 1943) is an American novelist. He is the writer of &quot;Goosebumps,&quot; a horror fiction novel series which has sold over 400 million copies globally in 35 languages, becoming the second-best-selling book series in history. The series spawned a media franchise including two television series, a video game series, a comic series, and two feature films. Stine has been referred to as the &quot;Stephen King of children&#x27;s literature&quot;. 

Stine wrote the teenage horror fiction series &quot;Fear Street&quot;, which has sold over 80 million copies and has been adapted into a trilogy of films. His other horror fiction novel series include &quot;Rotten School&quot;, &quot;Mostly Ghostly,&quot; &quot;Nightmare Hour&quot;, and &quot;The Nightmare Room&quot;. He has also written dozens of humor books for children, under the alias Jovial Bob Stine.

== Early life ==

Stine was born on October 8, 1943 in Columbus, Ohio, the son of Lewis Stine, a shipping clerk, and Anne Feinstein. He grew up in Bexley, Ohio. He comes from a Jewish family. Stine began writing at age nine, when he found a typewriter in his attic, subsequently beginning to type stories and joke books. Stine said that he remembered reading the &quot;Tales from the Crypt&quot; comic books when he was young and credited them as one of his inspirations. He graduated from Ohio State University in 1965 with a Bachelor of Arts in English. While at OSU, Stine edited humor magazine &quot;The Sundial&quot; for three years. He later moved to New York City to pursue his career as a writer.

Stine was editor and responsible for much of the writing (other contributors included writers Robert Leighton, Suzanne Lord and Jane Samuels and artists Sam Viviano, Samuel B. Whitehead, Bob K. Taylor, Bryan Hendrix, Bill Basso, and Howard Cruse). Recurring features included &quot;Hey – Lighten Up!&quot;, &quot;It Never Fails!&quot;, &quot;Phone Calls&quot;, &quot;Joe&quot; (a comic strip by John Holmstrom), &quot;Phil Fly&quot;, &quot;Don&#x27;t You Wish...&quot;, &quot;Doctor Duck&quot;, &quot;The Teens of Ferret High&quot;, &quot;First Date&quot; (a comic strip by Alyse Newman), and &quot;Ask Doctor Si N. Tific&quot;.

In 1986, Stine wrote his first horror novel, called &quot;Blind Date&quot;. He followed with many other novels, including &quot;The Babysitter&quot;, &quot;Beach House&quot;, &quot;Hit and Run&quot;, and &quot;The Girlfriend&quot;. He was also the co-creator and head writer for the Nickelodeon children&#x27;s television series &quot;Eureeka&#x27;s Castle&quot;, original episodes of which aired as part of the Nick Jr. programming block during the 1989–1995 seasons.

In 1989, Stine started writing &quot;Fear Street&quot; books. Before launching the &quot;Goosebumps&quot; series, Stine authored three humorous science fiction books in the &quot;Space Cadets&quot; series titled &quot;Jerks in Training&quot;, &quot;Bozos on Patrol&quot;, and &quot;Losers in Space&quot;. In 1992, Stine and Parachute Press went on to launch &quot;Goosebumps&quot;.

In 1995, Stine&#x27;s first novel targeted at adults, called &quot;Superstitious&quot;, was published. He has since published three other adult-oriented novels: &quot;The Sitter&quot;, &quot;Eye Candy&quot;, and &quot;Red Rain&quot;.
In the first decade of the 21st century, Stine worked on installments of five different book series, &quot;Mostly Ghostly&quot;, &quot;Rotten School&quot;, &quot;Fear Street&quot;, &quot;The Nightmare Room&quot;, &quot;Goosebumps Horrorland&quot; and the stand-alone novels &quot;Dangerous Girls&quot; (2003) and &quot;The Taste of Night&quot; (2004). Also, a direct-to-DVD movie &quot;The Haunting Hour Volume One: Don&#x27;t Think About It&quot;. Starring Emily Osment, the film was released by Universal Home Entertainment on September 4, 2007 and was successful enough to spawn a spin-off, anthology, TV series &quot;R. L. Stine&#x27;s The Haunting Hour&quot;.

In 2014, Stine brought the &quot;Fear Street&quot; books back with his novel &quot;Party Games&quot; (). The release of the &quot;Fear Street&quot; novel &quot;Give Me a K-I-L-L&quot; took place in 2017 (). Jack Black portrayed a fictionalized version of Stine in the 2015 film &quot;Goosebumps&quot;, while Stine himself made a cameo appearance in the film, playing a teacher named &quot;Mr. Black&quot;. In the film&#x27;s sequel, &quot;Goosebumps 2: Haunted Halloween&quot; (2018), Stine had another cameo, as Principal Harrison, while Black reprised his role as Stine in several scenes. A &quot;Fear Street&quot; trilogy of films was released by Netflix in 2021.

In 2019, Stine appeared on an episode of the children&#x27;s TV series &quot;Arthur&quot;. In &quot;Fright Night&quot;, which aired in the 23rd season of the show, Stine voices Bob Baxter, the uncle of main character Buster Baxter. In the episode, Bob is shown to moonlight as a writer of scary stories, alluding to his real-life career as the author of the &quot;Goosebumps&quot; series.

==Awards and recognition==
According to &quot;Forbes&quot; List of the 40 best-paid Entertainers of 1996–97, Stine placed 36th with an income of $41 million for the fiscal year. His books have sold over 400 million copies worldwide as of 2008, landing on many bestseller lists. In three consecutive years during the 1990s, &quot;USA Today&quot; named Stine as America&#x27;s number one best-selling author.

Among the awards he has received are the 2002 Champion of Reading Award from the Free Public Library of Philadelphia (that award&#x27;s first year), the Disney Adventures Kids&#x27; Choice Award for Best Book-Mystery/Horror (three-time recipient) and the Nickelodeon Kids&#x27; Choice Awards (also received three times). In 1995, Stine was listed on &quot;People Weekly&quot;″s &quot;Most Intriguing People&quot; annual list, and in 2003, the Guinness Book of World Records named Stine as the best-selling children&#x27;s book series author of all time. He won the Thriller Writers of America Silver Bullet Award in 2007, and the Horror Writers Association&#x27;s Lifetime Achievement Award in 2014. His stories have even inspired &quot;R. L. Stine&#x27;s Haunted Lighthouse&quot;, 4D movie-based attractions at SeaWorld (San Antonio and San Diego) and Busch Gardens (Williamsburg and Tampa).

In 2013, Stine won the Bram Stoker Award for Lifetime Achievement. In 2017, Stine was awarded the Inkpot Award.

==Personal life==
On June 22, 1969, Stine married Jane Waldhorn, an editor and writer who later co-founded Parachute Press in 1983. The couple&#x27;s only child, Matthew (b. June 7, 1980), works in the music industry.
Through their son, Stine and his wife have one grandson (b. February 2014).

<text>Charles Lenox Remond (February 1, 1810 – December 22, 1873) was an American orator, activist and abolitionist based in Massachusetts. He lectured against slavery across the Northeast, and in 1840 traveled to the British Isles on a tour with William Lloyd Garrison. During the American Civil War, he recruited blacks for the United States Colored Troops, helping staff the first two units sent from Massachusetts. From a large family of African-American entrepreneurs, he was the brother of Sarah Parker Remond, also a lecturer against slavery.

==Biography==

===Early years===
Remond was born in Salem, Massachusetts to John Remond, a free man of color from the island of Curaçao, who was a hairdresser, and Nancy Lenox, daughter of a prominent Bostonian, a hairdresser and caterer. Massachusetts had effectively abolished slavery after the Revolution with its new constitution. The eldest son of eight children, Charles Remond began his activism in opposition to southern slavery early. His siblings included sisters Nancy, Cecilia, Maritchie Juan, Caroline, and Sarah Parker, and a younger brother John Remond.

While in his twenties, Remond started speaking for abolition at public gatherings and conferences in Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Maine, New York and Pennsylvania.

===Activism===
In 1838, the Massachusetts Anti-Slavery Society chose him as one of its agents. As a delegate from the American Anti-Slavery Society, in 1840 he traveled with William Lloyd Garrison, a leading American abolitionist, to the World&#x27;s Anti-Slavery Convention in London. The young Remond gained a reputation as an eloquent lecturer and is reported to have been the first black public speaker on abolition. He was described as expressing himself with &quot;militancy&quot; and wit.

Remond proposed resolution at the first national Colored Convention in Philadelphia, PA (1830) calling for blacks to leave &quot;en masse&quot; any church &quot;that discriminated against them in seating or at the communion table.&quot; Their resolution was adopted.

In 1840, when female delegates were denied seats at the World Anti-Slavery Convention in London, Lenox and Garrison protested and walked out with the women.

In 1857 at a meeting held in New Brighton by Remond and his sister Sarah, also an abolitionist lecturer, Remond said, &quot;When the world shall learn that &#x27;mind makes the man&#x27;-- that goodness; moral worth, and integrity of soul, are the true tests of Character, then prejudice against caste and color, will cease to be.&quot;

During the Civil War, Remond recruited black soldiers in Massachusetts for the United States Colored Troops of the Union Army, helping man the early, famed units of the 54th Massachusetts Infantry.

===Work===
Remond&#x27;s family owned and operated a successful hairdressing business, and catering service in which several members participated. His three sisters, Cecilia, Maritchie, and Caroline, owned a women&#x27;s hair salon and the largest wig factory in the state.

Remond eventually struck out on his own. After the Civil War ended, he moved to Boston, where he worked as a clerk in the United States Customs House. He also worked as a street lamp inspector. He later purchased a farm in South Reading (now Wakefield), Massachusetts.

==Marriage and family==
Remond was married in September 1850 to Amy Matilda Cassey (née Williams), the daughter of Rev. Peter Williams, Jr. She was the widow of wealthy Philadelphia barber Joseph Cassey, with whom she had eight children including Peter William Cassey and an adopted daughter, Annie E. Wood, the maternal aunt of Charlotte Forten Grimke. After her marriage to Remond, she moved to Salem, where she lived until her death on August 15, 1856.

Two years later, Remond married again, to Elizabeth Magee, a native of Virginia, in Newton on July 5, 1858. The abolitionist preacher, Rev. Theodore Parker, officiated. Before her death in 1871, Elizabeth and Remond had four children: Amy Matilda (1859–72), Charles Lenox, Jr. (1860–82), Wendell Phillips (1863–66), and Albert Ernest Remond (1866–1903).

Remond died in Boston in December 1873. He is buried in Harmony Grove Cemetery, in Salem.

Frederick Douglass named one of his sons for him: Charles Remond Douglass.

<doc id="368071" wikidata="Q1278637" url="?curid=368071" title="The Wild Wild West">
<text>The Wild Wild West is an American Western, spy, and science fiction television series that ran on the CBS television network for four seasons from September 17, 1965, to April 11, 1969. Two satirical comedy television film sequels were made with the original stars in 1979 and 1980 and the series was adapted for a theatrical film in 1999.

Developed at a time when the television Western was losing ground to the spy genre, this show was conceived by its creator, Michael Garrison, as &quot;James Bond on horseback.&quot; Set during the administration of President Ulysses S. Grant (1869–1877), the series followed Secret Service agents James West (Robert Conrad) and Artemus Gordon (Ross Martin) as they foiled the plans of megalomaniacal villains to take over part or all of the United States, protected the President, and solved crimes. The show featured a number of fantasy elements, such as the technologically advanced devices used by the agents and their adversaries. The combination of the Victorian era time-frame and the use of Vernean technology has led several steampunk web sites to cite the show as a pioneering influence on the genre. This aspect was accentuated even more in the 1999 film adaptation.

Despite high ratings, the series was cancelled near the end of its fourth season as a concession to Congress over television violence.

==Concept==

&quot;The Wild Wild West&quot; told the story of two Secret Service agents: the fearless and handsome James West (played by Robert Conrad), and Artemus Gordon (played by Ross Martin), a brilliant gadgeteer and master of disguise. Their mission was to protect President Ulysses S. Grant and the United States from all manner of dangerous threats. The agents traveled in luxury aboard their own train, the &quot;Wanderer&quot;, equipped with everything from a stable car to a laboratory. James West had served as an intelligence and cavalry officer in the American Civil War (1861–1865) on Grant&#x27;s staff; his &quot;cover&quot;, at least in the pilot episode, is that of &quot;a dandy, a high-roller from the East&quot;. Thereafter, however, there is no pretense, and his reputation as the foremost Secret Service agent often precedes him. According to the later TV movies, West retires from the Service by 1880 and lives on a ranch in Mexico. When he retires, Gordon, who was a captain in the Civil War, returns to show business as the head of a troupe of traveling Shakespeare players.

The show incorporated classic Western elements with an espionage thriller, science fiction/alternate history ideas (in a vein similar to what would later be called steampunk), in one case horror (&quot;The Night of the Man Eating House&quot;) and humor. Episodes were also inspired by Edgar Allan Poe, H. G. Wells and Jules Verne. In the tradition of James Bond, there were always beautiful women, clever gadgets and delusional arch-enemies with half-insane plots to take over the country or the world.

The title of each episode begins with &quot;The Night&quot; (except for &quot;Night of the Casual Killer&quot; in the first season). This followed other idiosyncratic naming conventions established by shows such as &quot;Wagon Train&quot; (1957–1965), where nearly every episode was titled &quot;The (Name) Story&quot; or &quot;The Story of (Name)&quot;; &quot;Rawhide&quot; (1959–1965), in which a majority of episode titles began with &quot;Incident&quot;; and &quot;The Man from U.N.C.L.E.&quot; (1964–1968), whose episodes were titled &quot;The (Blank) Affair&quot;.

==Episodes==

==Characters==
===Leads===
Before &quot;The Wild Wild West&quot;, Robert Conrad played private detective Tom Lopaka in ABC&#x27;s &quot;Hawaiian Eye&quot; for four seasons (1959–63). In November 1964, he was making the film &quot;Young Dillinger&quot; (1965) with Nick Adams, Victor Buono and John Ashley (all of whom would later guest star on &quot;The Wild Wild West&quot;) when his agent sent him to CBS to audition for the West role. Conrad claimed to be the 17th actor to test for the part. Others tested included Robert Horton, Ray Danton and James &quot;Skip&quot; Ward. Conrad also claimed that John Derek left the audition without testing.

Conrad performed nearly all of his own stunts in the series. &quot;For the first few episodes we tried stuntmen,&quot; Conrad explained, &quot;but the setup time slowed production down, so I volunteered. Things started moving quicker when I took the jumps and the spills. We started meeting the budget.&quot; Early on, he was doubled by Louie Elias or Chuck O&#x27;Brien.

On January 24, 1968, however, during filming of &quot;The Night of the Fugitives&quot; near the end of the third season, Conrad fell from a chandelier onto the stage floor and suffered a concussion. &quot;A little gymnastics — chandelier work,&quot; he later explained. &quot;I didn&#x27;t chalk up properly and I went 15 feet to the concrete and fractured my skull. I was in intensive care for 72 hours, with a six-inch lineal fracture of the skull and a high temporal concussion.&quot; As a result, production of the series ended two weeks early. Conrad spent weeks in the hospital and had a long convalescence slowed by constant dizziness. The episode was eventually completed and aired early in the fourth season, with footage of the fall left in. Conrad later told Percy Shain of the &quot;Boston Globe&quot;, &quot;I have the whole scene on film. It&#x27;s a constant reminder to be careful. It also bolstered my determination to make this my last year with the series. Four seasons are enough of this sort of thing.&quot; Thereafter, Conrad was doubled for the dangerous stunts, but still participated in fight scenes.

Prior to &quot;The Wild Wild West,&quot; Ross Martin co-starred in the CBS series &quot;Mr. Lucky&quot; from 1959 to 1960, portraying Mr. Lucky&#x27;s sidekick, Andamo. The series was created by Blake Edwards, who also cast Martin as villains in his films &quot;Experiment in Terror&quot; (1962) and &quot;The Great Race&quot; (1964).

Martin once called his role as Artemus Gordon &quot;a show-off&#x27;s showcase&quot; because it allowed him to portray over 100 different characters and perform dozens of different dialects during the course of the series. He sketched his ideas for his characterizations and worked with the makeup artists to execute the final look. Martin told Percy Shain of the &quot;Boston Globe&quot;, &quot;In the three years of the show, I have run a wider gamut than even those acknowledged masters of disguise, Paul Muni and Lon Chaney. Sometimes I feel like a one man repertory company. I think I&#x27;ve proven to myself and to the industry that I am the No. 1 character lead in films today.&quot; The industry acknowledged Martin&#x27;s work with an Emmy nomination in 1969.

Martin broke his leg in a fourth-season episode, &quot;The Night of the Avaricious Actuary&quot;, when he dropped a rifle, stepped on it, and his foot rolled over it. Martin told Percy Shain, &quot;In the scene where I was hurt, my stand-in tried to finish it. When the shell ejected from the rifle, it caught him in the eye and burned it. We still haven&#x27;t finished that scene. It will have to wait until I can move around again.&quot;

A few weeks later, after completing &quot;The Night of Fire and Brimstone&quot;, Martin suffered a heart attack on August 17, 1968 (this was exactly two years after the show&#x27;s creator, Michael Garrison, died). Martin&#x27;s character was replaced temporarily by other agents played by Charles Aidman (four episodes as Jeremy Pike), Alan Hale Jr. (as Ned Brown) and William Schallert (two episodes as Frank Harper), and West worked solo in two other episodes. Aidman said the producers had promised to rewrite the scripts for his new character, but this simply amounted to scratching out the name &quot;Artemus Gordon&quot; and penciling in &quot;Jeremy Pike&quot; (his character&#x27;s name). Pat Paulsen (one episode as Agent Bosley Cranston) is frequently thought of as a Martin substitute, but he appeared in one of Aidman&#x27;s episodes, and his character would have been present even if Martin had appeared. Martin returned in mid-December to work in the final three episodes to be filmed.

===Villains===
The show&#x27;s most memorable recurring arch-villain was Dr. Miguelito Quixote Loveless, a brilliant but petulant and cal dwarf portrayed by Michael Dunn. Initially he had two companions: the towering 7&#x27;2&quot; Voltaire, played by Richard Kiel; and the beautiful Antoinette, played by Dunn&#x27;s real-life singing partner, Phoebe Dorin. Voltaire disappeared without explanation after his third episode, but Kiel returned in a different role in &quot;The Night of the Simian Terror&quot;. Antoinette vanished after her sixth episode due to demands by Dunn&#x27;s jealous real-life wife.

According to the television film &quot;The Wild Wild West Revisited&quot;, Loveless eventually dies in 1880 from ulcers, brought on by the frustration of having his plans consistently foiled by West and Gordon. (His son, played by Paul Williams in the TV film, subsequently seeks revenge on the agents.)

Although several actors appeared in different villainous roles, only one other character had a second encounter with West and Gordon: Count Manzeppi, played flamboyantly by Victor Buono. Manzeppi was a diabolical genius of &quot;black magic&quot; and crime, wholike Dr. Lovelesshad an escape plan at the end. Buono played a different villain in the pilot episode, and also returned in &quot;More Wild Wild West&quot; as &quot;Dr. Henry Messenger&quot;, a parody of Henry Kissinger.

Agnes Moorehead won an Emmy for her role as Emma Valentine in &quot;The Night of the Vicious Valentine&quot;. Other villains were portrayed by Ed Asner, Christopher Cary, Yvonne Craig, Robert Duvall, Anthony Eisley, Boris Karloff, Harvey Korman, Martin Landau, Delphi Lawrence, Robert Loggia, Ida Lupino, Burgess Meredith, Ricardo Montalbán, Leslie Nielsen, Ramon Novarro, Carroll O&#x27;Connor, Susan Oliver, Percy Rodrigues, Jo Van Fleet, Sam Wanamaker, William Windom, and H. M. Wynant.

While the show&#x27;s writers created their fair share of villains, they often started with the nefarious, stylized and sometimes anachronistic inventions of these madmen (or madwomen) and then wrote the episodes around the devices. Henry Sharp, the series&#x27; story consultant, would sketch the preliminaries of the designs (eccentrically numbering every sketch &quot;fig. 37&quot;), and give the sketch to a writer, who would build a story around it.

===Recurring characters===
* Dr. Miguelito Quixote Loveless (Michael Dunn), ten episodes. The agents&#x27; nemesis.
* Colonel Richmond (Douglas Henderson), ten episodes. West and Gordon&#x27;s control officer in the Secret Service.
* President Ulysses S. Grant (James Gregory in the pilot; Roy Engel thereafter), seven episodes.
* Antoinette (Phoebe Dorin), six appearances. Loveless&#x27; female companion, often seen playing a piano or string instrument and singing duet with Loveless. Dorin and Dunn (Loveless) had a real-life nightclub act, &quot;Michael Dunn and Phoebe&quot;, in which they sang and exchanged banter. According to Dorin, while filming the episode &quot;The Night of the Murderous Spring&quot;, her costume became entangled in the machinery used to pull the boat she and Dunn were in underwater. Dunn did not hesitate to follow her down and help her escape.
* Jeremy Pike (Charles Aidman), four episodes. One of several agents paired with Jim during Artemus&#x27; absence in the fourth season. Appears in the final Loveless episode, &quot;The Night of Miguelito&#x27;s Revenge&quot;.
* Tennyson (Charles Davis), three episodes. West&#x27;s butler/valet. Seen randomly in the first season because the episodes were not always broadcast in production order.
* Voltaire (Richard Kiel), three episodes. Loveless&#x27; mostly silent, giant bodyguard. (Kiel also played Dimos Buckley in &quot;The Night of the Simian Terror&quot;.)
* Count Carlos Mario Vincenzo Robespierre Manzeppi (Victor Buono), two appearances. A master of dark magic and leader of a handpicked teams of assassins. (Buono also played Juan Manolo in &quot;The Night of the Inferno&quot;, the first episode, and Henry Messenger in &quot;More Wild Wild West&quot;, the final production.)
* Frank Harper (William Schallert): Another agent paired with Jim in the fourth season. He appears in the series&#x27; only two-part episode, &quot;The Night of the Winged Terror&quot;. (Schallert played different characters in two other episodes.)

==Production==
===Creation, writing and filming===
In 1954, director/producer Gregory Ratoff purchased the film rights to Ian Fleming&#x27;s first James Bond novel, &quot;Casino Royale,&quot; for $600. CBS, meanwhile, bought the TV rights for $1,000, and on October 21, 1954, the network broadcast an hour-long adaptation on its &quot;Climax!&quot; series, with Barry Nelson playing American agent &quot;Jimmy Bond&quot; and Peter Lorre playing the villain, Le Chiffre. CBS also approached Fleming about developing a Bond TV series. Fleming later contributed ideas to NBC&#x27;s &quot;The Man from U.N.C.L.E.&quot;.

In 1955, Ratoff and Michael Garrison formed a production company to make a &quot;Casino Royale&quot; film, with Ratoff set to direct and 20th Century Fox set to distribute. Production stalled when Ratoff and Garrison could not obtain financing. In 1960, Hedda Hopper reported that Ratoff&#x27;s film would star Peter Finch as Bond. But Ratoff died that December and his widow sold the film rights to producer Charles K. Feldman for $75,000. Feldman and director Howard Hawks were interested in making &quot;Casino Royale&quot; with Cary Grant as Bond. Eventually Feldman was offered $500,000 and a percentage of the profits to let Harry Saltzman and Cubby Broccoli make the film with Sean Connery. Feldman turned them down, and eventually produced the spoof &quot;Casino Royale&quot; in 1967. By then, Garrison and CBS had brought James Bond to television in a unique way.

The series&#x27; pilot episode, &quot;The Night of the Inferno&quot;, was filmed in December 1964. It was produced by Garrison and, according to Robert Conrad, cost $685,000. The episode was scripted by Gilbert Ralston, who had written for numerous episodic TV series in the 1950s and 1960s. (Western novelist and screenwriter Clair Huffaker also worked on the concept.) In a later deposition, Ralston explained that he was approached by Michael Garrison, who &quot;said he had an idea for a series, good commercial idea, and wanted to know if I could glue the idea of a western hero and a James Bond type together in the same show.&quot; Ralston said he then created the Civil War characters, the format, the story outline and nine drafts of the pilot script that was the basis for the television series. It was his idea, for example, to have a secret agent named Jim West who would perform secret missions for President Ulysses S. Grant. Ralston later sued Warner Bros. over the 1999 theatrical film &quot;Wild Wild West&quot;, which was based on the series.

As indicated by Robert Conrad on his DVD commentary, the show went through several producers in its first season. This was apparently due to conflicts between the network and Garrison, who had no experience producing for television and had trouble staying on budget. At first, Ben Brady was named producer, but he was shifted to &quot;Rawhide&quot;, which had its own crisis when star Eric Fleming quit at the end of the 1964–65 season. &quot;Rawhide&quot; lasted another 13 episodes before it was cancelled by CBS.

The network then hired Collier Young. In an interview, Young said he saw the series as &quot;The Rogues&quot; set in 1870 (&quot;The Rogues&quot;, which he had produced, was about con men who swindled swindlers, much like the 1970s series &quot;Switch&quot;). Young also claimed to have added the wry second &quot;Wild&quot; to the series title, which had been simply &quot;The Wild West&quot; in its early stages of production. Young&#x27;s episodes (2–4) featured a butler named Tennyson who traveled with West and Gordon, but since the episodes were not broadcast in production order, the character popped up at different times during the first season. Conrad was not sorry to see Young go: &quot;I don&#x27;t mind. All that guy did creatively was put the second &#x27;wild&#x27; in the title. CBS did the right thing.&quot;
Young&#x27;s replacement, Fred Freiberger, returned the series to its original concept. It was on his watch that writer John Kneubuhl, inspired by a magazine article about Michael Dunn, created the arch-villain Dr. Miguelito Quixote Loveless. Phoebe Dorin, who played Loveless&#x27; assistant, Antoinette, recalled: &quot;Michael Garrison came to see [our] nightclub act when he was in New York. Garrison said to himself, &#x27;Michael Dunn would make the most extraordinary villain. People have never seen anything like him before, and he&#x27;s a fabulous little actor and he&#x27;s funny as hell.&#x27; And, Garrison felt, if Michael Dunn sang on every show, with the girl, it would be an extraordinary running villain. He came backstage and he told us who he was and he said he was going to do a television show called &quot;The Wild Wild West&quot; and we would be called. We thought, &#x27;Yeah, yeah, we&#x27;ve heard all that before.&#x27; But he did call us and the show was a fantastic success. And that&#x27;s how it started, because he saw the nightclub act.&quot; Loveless was introduced in &quot;The Night the Wizard Shook The Earth&quot;, the show&#x27;s sixth produced, but third televised episode. The character became an immediate hit and Dunn was contracted to appear in four episodes per season. Because of health problems, however, Dunn only appeared in 10 episodes instead of 16.

After 10 episodes (5–14), Freiberger and executive producer Michael Garrison were, according to &quot;Variety&quot;, &quot;unceremoniously dumped,&quot; reputedly due to a behind-the-scenes power struggle. Garrison was replaced by Phillip Leacock, the executive producer of &quot;Gunsmoke&quot;, and Freiberger was supplanted by John Mantley, an associate producer on &quot;Gunsmoke&quot;. The exchange stunned both cast and crew. Garrison, who owned 40% of &quot;The Wild Wild West&quot;, knew nothing about the changes and had not been consulted. He turned the matter over to his attorneys. Freiberger said, &quot;I was fired for accomplishing what I had been hired to do. I was hired to pull the show together when it was in chaos.&quot; Conrad said, &quot;I was totally shocked by it. Let&#x27;s face it, the show is healthy. I think Fred Freiberger is totally correct in his concept of the show. It&#x27;s an administrative change, for what reason I don&#x27;t know.&quot;

Mantley produced seven (15–21) episodes, then returned to his former position on &quot;Gunsmoke&quot; and Gene L. Coon took over as associate producer. By then, Garrison&#x27;s conflict with CBS was resolved and he returned to the executive producer role. Coon left after six episodes (22–27) to write &quot;First to Fight&quot; (1967), a Warner Bros. film about the Marines. Garrison produced the last episode of season 1 and the initial episodes of season 2.

Garrison&#x27;s return was much to the relief of Ross Martin, who once revealed that he was so disenchanted during the first season that he tried to quit three times. He explained that Garrison &quot;saw the show as a Bond spoof laid in 1870, and we all knew where we stood. Each new producer tried to put his stamp on the show and I had a terrible struggle. I fought them line by line in every script. They knew they couldn&#x27;t change the James West role very much, but it was open season on Artemus Gordon because they had never seen anything like him before.&quot;

On August 17, 1966, however, during production of the new season&#x27;s ninth episode, &quot;The Night of the Ready-Made Corpse&quot;, Garrison fell down a flight of stairs in his home, fractured his skull and died. CBS assigned Bruce Lansbury, brother of actress Angela Lansbury, to produce the show for the remainder of its run. In the early 1960s Lansbury had been in charge of daytime shows at CBS Television City in Hollywood, then vice president of programming in New York. When he was tapped for &quot;The Wild Wild West&quot;, Lansbury was working with his twin brother, Edgar, producing legitimate theater on Broadway.

The first season&#x27;s episodes were filmed in black and white and they were darker in tone. Cinematographer Ted Voightlander was nominated for an Emmy Award for his work on one of these episodes, &quot;The Night of the Howling Light&quot;. Subsequent seasons were filmed in color and the show became noticeably campier.

&quot;The Wild Wild West&quot; was filmed at CBS Studio Center on Radford Avenue in Studio City in the San Fernando Valley. The 70-acre lot was formerly the home of Republic Studios, which specialized in low-budget films, including Westerns starring Roy Rogers and Gene Autry and Saturday morning serials (which &quot;The Wild Wild West&quot; appropriately echoed). CBS had a wall-to-wall lease on the lot starting in May 1963 and produced &quot;Gunsmoke&quot; and &quot;Rawhide&quot; there, as well as &quot;Gilligan&#x27;s Island&quot;. The network bought the lot from Republic in February 1967 for $9.5 million. Beginning in 1971, MTM Enterprises (headed by actress Mary Tyler Moore and her then-husband Grant Tinker) became the Studio Center&#x27;s primary tenant. In the mid-1980s the Western streets and sets were replaced with new sound stages and urban facades, including the New York streets seen in &quot;Seinfeld&quot;. In 1995, the lagoon set that was originally constructed for &quot;Gilligan&#x27;s Island&quot; was paved over to create a parking lot.

Among iconic locations used for filming were Bronson Canyon (&quot;Night of the Returning Dead&quot; S02 E05) and Vasquez Rocks (&quot;Night of the Cadre&quot; S02 E26).

The TV movies used Old Tucson Studios and Apacheland Studios in Tucson, Arizona, and Gold Canyon, Arizona, respectively.

===Train===

For the pilot episode, &quot;The Night of the Inferno&quot;, the producers used Sierra Railroad No. 3, a 4-6-0 locomotive that was, fittingly, an anachronism: Sierra No. 3 was built in 1891, 15 to 20 years after the series was set. Footage of this train, with a 5 replacing the 3 on its number plate, was shot in Jamestown, California. Best known for its role as the Hooterville Cannonball in the CBS series &quot;Petticoat Junction&quot;, Sierra No. 3 probably appeared in more films and TV shows than any other locomotive in history. It was built by the Rogers Locomotive and Machine Works in Paterson, New Jersey.

When &quot;The Wild Wild West&quot; went into series production, however, an entirely different train was employed. The locomotive, a 4-4-0 named the Inyo, was built in 1875 by the Baldwin Locomotive Works in Philadelphia. Originally a wood-burner, the Inyo was converted to oil in 1910. The Inyo, as well as the express car and the passenger car, originally served the Virginia and Truckee Railroad in Nevada. They were among the V&amp;T cars sold to Paramount Pictures in 1937–38. The Inyo appears in numerous films including &quot;High, Wide, and Handsome&quot; (1938), &quot;Union Pacific&quot; (1939), the Marx Brothers&#x27; &quot;Go West&quot; (1940), &quot;Meet Me in St. Louis&quot; (1944), &quot;Red River&quot; (1948), Disney&#x27;s &quot;The Great Locomotive Chase&quot; (1956) and &quot;McLintock!&quot; (1963). For &quot;The Wild Wild West&quot;, Inyo&#x27;s original number plate was temporarily changed from No. 22 to No. 8 so that footage of the train could be flopped horizontally without the number appearing reversed. Footage of the Inyo in motion and idling was shot around Menifee, California, and reused in virtually every episode. Stock footage of Sierra No. 3 occasionally resurfaced as well.

These trains were used only for exterior shots. The luxurious interior of the passenger car was constructed on Stage 6 at CBS Studio Center. Designed by art director Albert Heschong, the set reportedly cost $35,000 in 1965 (over $290,000 in 2021 dollars). The interior was redesigned with lighter wood when the show switched to color for the 1966–67 season.

The train interior was also used in at least one episode of &quot;Gunsmoke&quot; (&quot;Death Train&quot;, aired January 27, 1967) and in at least two episodes of &quot;The Big Valley&quot; (&quot;Last Train to the Fair&quot;, aired April 27, 1966, and &quot;Days of Wrath&quot;, aired January 8, 1968). All three series were filmed at CBS Studio Center and shared other exterior and interior sets. Additionally, the train interior was used for an episode of &quot;Get Smart&quot; (&quot;The King Lives?&quot;, aired January 6, 1968) and the short-lived &quot;Barbary Coast&quot; (&quot;Funny Money&quot;, aired September 8, 1975).

After its run on &quot;The Wild Wild West&quot;, the Inyo participated in the Golden Spike Centennial at Promontory, Utah, in 1969. The following year it appeared as a replica of the Central Pacific&#x27;s &quot;Jupiter&quot; locomotive at the Golden Spike National Historical Site. The State of Nevada purchased the Inyo in 1974; it was restored to 1895 vintage, including a wider smoke stack and a new cowcatcher (pilot) without a drop coupler. The Inyo is still operational and displayed at the Nevada State Railroad Museum in Carson City. The express car (No. 21) and passenger car (No. 4) are also at the museum.

Another veteran V&amp;T locomotive, the Reno (built in 1872 by Baldwin), was used in the two &quot;Wild Wild West&quot; TV movies. The Reno, which resembles the Inyo, is located at Old Tucson Studios.

The 1999 &quot;Wild Wild West&quot; film adaptation used the Baltimore &amp; Ohio 4–4–0 No. 25, one of the oldest operating steam locomotives in the U.S. Built in 1856 at the Mason Machine Works in Taunton, Massachusetts, it was later renamed The William Mason in honor of its manufacturer. For its role as &quot;The Wanderer&quot; in the film, the engine was sent to the steam shops at the Strasburg Rail Road for restoration and repainting. The locomotive is brought out for the B&amp;O Train Museum in Baltimore&#x27;s &quot;Steam Days&quot;.

Both the Inyo and The William Mason appeared in the Disney film &quot;The Great Locomotive Chase&quot; (1956).

===Theme music===
The main title theme was written by Richard Markowitz, who previously composed the theme for the TV series &quot;The Rebel&quot;. He was brought in after the producers rejected two attempts by film composer Dimitri Tiomkin.

In an interview by Susan Kesler (for her book &quot;The Wild Wild West: The Series&quot;) included in the first season DVD boxed set, Markowitz recalled that the original Tiomkin theme &quot;was very, kind of, traditional, it just seemed wrong.&quot; Markowitz explained his own approach: &quot;By combining jazz with Americana, I think that&#x27;s what nailed it. That took it away from the serious kind of thing that Tiomkin was trying to do...What I did essentially was write two themes: the rhythmic, contemporary theme, Fender bass and brushes, that vamp, for the cartoon effects and for West&#x27;s getting himself out of trouble, and the heraldic western outdoor theme over that, so that the two worked together.&quot;

Session musicians who played on the theme were Tommy Morgan (harmonica); Bud Shank, Ronnie Lang, Plas Johnson and Gene Cipriano (woodwinds); Vince DeRosa and Henry Sigismonti (French horns); Uan Rasey, Ollie Mitchell and Tony Terran (trumpets); Dick Nash, Lloyd Ulyate, Chauncey Welsch and Kenny Shroyer (trombones); Tommy Tedesco and Bill Pitman (guitars); Carol Kaye (Fender bass); Joe Porcaro (brushes) and Gene Estes, Larry Bunker and Emil Richards (timpani, percussion).

Markowitz, however, was never credited for his theme in any episode; it is believed that this was due to legal difficulties between CBS and Tiomkin over the rejection of the latter&#x27;s work. Markowitz did receive &quot;music composed and conducted by&quot; credits for episodes he had scored (such as &quot;The Night of the Bars of Hell&quot; and &quot;The Night of the Raven&quot;) or where he supplied the majority of tracked-in cues (such as &quot;The Night of the Grand Emir&quot; and &quot;The Night of the Gypsy Peril&quot;). He finally received &quot;theme by&quot; credit on both of the TV movies, which were scored by Jeff Alexander rather than Markowitz (few personnel from the series were involved with the TV movies).

===Graphics===
The animated title sequence was another unique element of the series. Created by Michael Garrison Productions and DePatie-Freleng Enterprises, it was directed by Isadore &quot;Friz&quot; Freleng and animated by Ken Mundie, who designed the titles for the film &quot;The Great Race&quot; and the TV series &quot;Secret Agent,&quot; &quot;I Spy&quot;, &quot;Rawhide&quot; and &quot;Death Valley Days&quot;.

The screen was divided into four corner panels abutting a narrow central panel that contained a cartoon &quot;hero&quot;. The hero looked more like a traditional cowboy than either West or Gordon, and from each corner panel encountered cliché western characters and situations that never appeared in the show. In the three seasons shot in color, the overall backdrop was an abstracted wash of the flag of the United States, with the upper left panel colored blue and the others containing horizontal red stripes.

The original animation sequence is:
* The hero strikes a match, lights a cigar, and begins walking in profile to the right.
* Behind the hero, in the lower left panel, a bandito backs out of a bank; the hero subdues him with a karate chop to the back.
* In the upper right panel, a cardsharp tries to pull an ace of spades from his boot, but the hero draws his gun and the cardsharp drops the ace.
* In the upper left panel, a gunman picks up and points a six-shooter at the hero, who drops his gun and puts his hands up. The hero shoots the gunman with his sleeve Derringer; the gunman&#x27;s hand falls limp. The hero then quickly retrieves his own gun and puts it back in his holster.
* A woman in the lower right panel taps the hero on the hat with her parasol. He pulls her close and kisses her. She draws a knife but, mesmerized by his kiss, turns away and slumps against the side of the frame. He tips his hat and walks away with his back to the camera. There were two versions of this vignette; this one appears during the first season. When the show switched to color, the hero knocked the woman down with a right cross to the jaw. This variant also appears in the original pilot episode (included on the DVD release) when the series was titled &quot;The Wild West&quot;. Despite this, James West never hit a woman in any episode, although he grappled with many. The closest he came was when he slammed a door against the shotgun-holding evil Countess Zorana in &quot;The Night of the Iron Fist&quot;. In &quot;The Night of the Running Death&quot;, he slugged a woman named Miss Tyler, but &quot;she&quot; was a man in drag (actor T. C. Jones). The original animation, with the hero winning the woman over with a kiss, was a more accurate representation of West&#x27;s methods than the right cross. 
* The hero walks away into the distance and the camera zooms into his panel. The title &quot;The Wild Wild West&quot; appears. The camera then swish pans to an illustration of the train, with Conrad&#x27;s and Martin&#x27;s names on the ends of different cars.

Each episode had four acts. At the end of each act, the scene, usually a cliffhanger moment, would freeze, and a sketch or photograph of the scene replaced the cartoon art in one of the corner panels. The style of freeze-frame art changed over the course of the series. In all first-season episodes other than the pilot, the panels were live-action stills made to evoke 19th-century engravings. In season 2 (the first in color) the scenes dissolved to tinted stills; from &quot;The Night of the Flying Pie Plate&quot; on, however, the panels were home to Warhol-like serigraphs of the freeze-frames. 

The end credits were displayed over each episode&#x27;s unique mosaic of scenes. In the final season, however, a generic design was used under the end credits. Curiously, in this design, the bank robber is unconscious, the cardsharp has no card and the lady is on the ground, but the six-shooter in the upper left-hand panel has returned. The freeze-frame graphics were shot at a facility called Format Animation. The pilot is the only episode in which the center panel of the hero is replaced by a sketch of the final scene of an act; he is replaced by the villainous General Cassinello (Nehemiah Persoff) at the end of the third act.

During the first season, the series title &quot;The Wild Wild West&quot; was set in the font Barnum, which resembles the newer font P. T. Barnum. In subsequent seasons, the title appeared in a hand-drawn version of the font Dolphin (which resembles newer fonts called Zebrawood, Circus and Rodeo Clown). Robert Conrad&#x27;s name was also set in this font. Ross Martin&#x27;s name was set in the font Bracelet (which resembles newer fonts named Tuscan Ornate and Romantiques). All episode titles, writer and director credits, guest cast and crew credits were set in Barnum. During commercial breaks, the title &quot;The Wild Wild West&quot; also appeared in Barnum.

This teaser part of the show was incorporated into The History Channel&#x27;s &quot;Wild West Tech&quot; (2003–05).

===Dates given in the series===
The series is generally set during the presidency of Ulysses S. Grant from 1869 to 1877; occasional episodes indicate a more precise date:
* &quot;The Night of the Glowing Corpse&quot; (S1E7) is set during the Franco-Prussian War of July 19, 1870 – May 10, 1871.
* &quot;The Night of the Eccentrics&quot; (S2E1) takes place four years after the execution in 1867 of Emperor Maximilian I of Mexico, i.e. 1871. This is supported by a reference to President Benito Juárez, who stepped down in 1872.
* In &quot;The Night of the Eccentrics&quot;, Count Manzeppi hums &quot;Ride of the Valkyries&quot; which was first performed on June 26, 1870. 
* &quot;The Night of the Man Eating House&quot; (S2E12) states that Liston Day has been in solitary confinement for 30 years and later that he was arrested April 23, 1836. This would put it around 1866, three years before the Grant presidency began.
* In &quot;The Night of the Brain&quot; (S2E21), Artemus Gordon shows James West a newspaper dated July 12, 1872. West states, &quot;July 12, that&#x27;s an interesting date, but it happens to be tomorrow.&quot; After the events described happen, they again get tomorrow&#x27;s newspaper and we see the date: July 14, 1872.
* &quot;The Night of the Lord of Limbo&quot; (S2E15) takes place seven years after the end of the Civil War, making it 1872.
* &quot;The Night of the Tartar&quot; (S2E19) takes place five years after the 1867 purchase of Alaska [i.e., 1872]
* &quot;The Night of the Whirring Death&quot; (S1E20) opens with the caption &quot;San Francisco 1874&quot;.
* &quot;The Night of the Returning Death&quot; is set 13 years after the start of the Civil War [i.e., 1874]
* In &quot;The Night of the Flaming Ghost&quot; (S1E18), West says, &quot;If the real John Brown had lived he&#x27;d be almost 75 years old by now.&quot; Brown was born May 9, 1800.
* In &quot;The Night of the Arrow&quot; (S3E16), a cavalry officer resigns his commission as of April 6, 1874.
* In &quot;The Night of the Avaricious Actuary&quot; (S4E11), the heading of a letter shown on screen is dated 1875.
* In &quot;The Night of the Underground Terror&quot; (S3E19), the sadistic commandant of a prison camp is said to have escaped justice for 10 years, presumably from the end of the war in 1865.
* In &quot;The Night of the Samurai&quot; (S3E6), Baron Saigo says Admiral Perry took the sword over 30 years earlier. Assuming the date of Perry&#x27;s first visit to Japan (July 8, 1853), that would mean the episode takes place after 1883, or some six years after the end of the Grant presidency.
* In &quot;The Night that Terror Stalked the Town&quot;, Loveless has a headstone prepared for West, showing his birthdate as July 2, 1842.
* In &quot;The Night of the Kraken&quot; (S4E6), there is an assassination attempt on Admiral David Farragut, who died in 1870.

==Cancellation==
Some episodes were considered violent for their time and that, rather than low ratings, ultimately was the series&#x27; downfall. In addition to gunplay, there were usually two fight sequences per episode. These were choreographed by stuntman and bit player Whitey Hughes and Conrad and performed by Conrad and a stock company of stuntmen, including Red West, Dick Cangey and Bob Herron (who doubled for Ross Martin).

After Conrad suffered a concussion falling from a chandelier in &quot;The Night of the Fugitives&quot;, the network insisted that he defer to a stunt double (his chair on the set was newly inscribed: &quot;Robert Conrad, ex-stuntman, retired by CBS, Jan. 24, 1968&quot;). &quot;[W]hen I came back for the fourth season, I was limited to what I could do for insurance reasons,&quot; Conrad explained. &quot;So I agreed and gradually I did all the fights but couldn&#x27;t do anything five feet off the ground and of course that went out the window.&quot; He was doubled by Jimmy George. Often, George would start a stunt, such as a high fall or a dive through a window, then land behind boxes or off-camera where Conrad was hidden and waiting to seamlessly complete the action. This common stunt technique, known by filmmakers as &quot;the Texas Switch&quot;, was often used by Ross Martin and his double, Bob Herron.

It was hazardous work. Hughes recalled, &quot;We had a lot of crashes. We used to say, &#x27;Roll the cameras and call the ambulances!&#x27;&quot; Conrad recalled in 1994, &quot;The injuries started at the top. Robert Conrad: 6-inch fracture of the skull, high temporal concussion, partial paralysis. Ross Martin: broken leg. A broken skull for Red West. Broken leg for Jimmy George. Broken arm for Jack Skelly. And Michael Dunn: head injury and a spinal sprain. He did his own stunts. And on and on.&quot; 
As a result of the April 1968 assassination of Martin Luther King and the June 1968 assassination of Robert F. Kennedy, President Johnson created the U.S. National Commission on the Causes and Prevention of Violence. One of the questions it tackled was whether violence on television, including graphic news coverage of the Vietnam War, was a contributing factor to violence in American society. The television networks, anticipating these allegations, moved to curtail violence on their entertainment programs before the September start of the 1968–69 television season. Television reporter Cynthia Lowrey, in an article published in August 1968, wrote that &quot;The Wild Wild West&quot; &quot;is one of the action series being watched by network censors for scenes of excessive violence, even if the violence is all in fun.&quot;

However, despite a CBS mandate to tone down the mayhem, &quot;The Night of the Egyptian Queen&quot; (aired November 15, 1968) contains perhaps the series&#x27; most ferocious barroom brawl. A later memo attached to the shooting script of &quot;The Night of Miguelito&#x27;s Revenge&quot; (aired December 13, 1968) reads: &quot;Note to Directors: The producer respectfully asks that no violent acts be shot which are not depicted in the script or discussed beforehand. Most particularly stay away from gratuitous ad-libs, such as slaps, pointing of firearms or other weapons at characters (especially in close quarters), kicks and the use of furniture and other objects in fight scenes.&quot; Strict limits were placed on the number of so-called &quot;acts of violence&quot; in the last episodes of the season (and thus the series). James West rarely wears a gun in these episodes and rather than the usual fisticuffs, fight sequences involved tossing, tackling or body blocking the villains.

In December 1968, executives from ABC, CBS and NBC appeared before the President&#x27;s Commission. The most caustic of the commissioners, Rep. Hale Boggs (D-Louisiana), decried what he called &quot;the Saturday morning theme of children&#x27;s cartoon shows&quot; that permit &quot;the good guy to do anything in the name of justice.&quot; He also indicted CBS for featuring sadism in its primetime programing (&quot;The Wild Wild West&quot; was subsequently identified as one example). The Congressman did, however, commend CBS for a 25% decline in violence programming in prime time compared to the other two networks.

Three months later, in March 1969, Sen. John O. Pastore (D-Rhode Island) called the same network presidents before his Senate communications subcommittee for a public scolding on the same subject. At Pastore&#x27;s insistence, the networks promised tighter industry self-censorship and the Surgeon General began a $1 million study on the effects of television. Congress&#x27;s concern was shared by the public: in a nationwide poll, 67.5% of 1,554 Americans agreed with the hypothesis that TV and movie violence prompted violence in real life.

Additionally, the National Association for Better Broadcasting (NABB), in a report eventually issued in November 1969, rated &quot;The Wild Wild West&quot; &quot;as one of the most violent series on television.&quot;

After being excoriated by the two committees, networks scrambled to expunge violence from their programming. &quot;The Wild Wild West&quot; received its cancellation notice in mid-February, even before Pastore&#x27;s committee convened. Producer Bruce Lansbury always claimed that &quot;It was a sacrificial lamb … It went off with a 32 or 33 share which in those days was virtually break-even but it always won its time period.&quot; This is confirmed by an article by Associated Press reporter Joseph Mohbat: &quot;Shows like ABC&#x27;s &#x27;Outcasts&#x27; and NBC&#x27;s &#x27;Outsider&#x27;, which depended heavily on violence, were scrapped. CBS killed &#x27;The Wild, Wild West&#x27; despite high ratings because of criticism. It was seen by the network as a gesture of good intentions.&quot; The networks played it safe thereafter: of the 22 new television shows that debuted in the fall of 1969, not one was a Western or detective drama; 14 were comedy or variety series.

Conrad denounced Pastore for many years, but in other interviews he admitted that it probably was time to cancel the series because he felt that he and the stuntmen were pushing their luck. He also believed the role had hurt his craft. &quot;In so many roles I was a tough guy and I never advanced much,&quot; Conrad explained. &quot;&quot;Wild Wild West&quot; was action adventure. I jumped off roofs and spent all my time with the stuntmen instead of other actors. I thought that&#x27;s what the role demanded. That role had no dimension other than what it was—a caricature of a performance. It was a comic strip character.&quot;

==Domestic and foreign syndication==
The series was shown in the United Kingdom on the ITV network starting May 5, 1968. It was reasonably popular, but has not been seen on British terrestrial television since the early 1980s. In France the series was known locally as &quot;Les Mystères de l&#x27;Ouest&quot;, where it was successful since all four seasons were released in a DVD boxed set there before they were released in the U.S.

In the summer of 1970, CBS reran several episodes of &quot;The Wild Wild West&quot; on Mondays at 10 p.m. as a summer replacement for &quot;The Carol Burnett Show&quot;. These episodes were &quot;The Night of the Bleak Island&quot; (aired July 6); &quot;The Night of the Big Blackmail&quot; (July 13); &quot;The Night of the Kraken&quot; (July 20); &quot;The Night of the Diva&quot; (July 27); &quot;The Night of the Simian Terror&quot; (August 3); &quot;The Night of the Bubbling Death&quot; (August 11); &quot;The Night of the Returning Dead&quot; (August 17); &quot;The Night of the Falcon&quot; (August 24); &quot;The Night of the Underground Terror&quot; (August 31); and &quot;The Night of the Sedgewick Curse&quot; (September 7). Curiously, none of these featured the most frequent and popular villain, Dr. Loveless.

TV critic Lawrence Laurent wrote, &quot;The return of &quot;Wild Wild West&quot; even for a summer re-run isn&#x27;t surprising. CBS-TV was never really very eager to cancel this series, since over a four-year run that began in 1965 the &quot;Wild Wild West&quot; had been a solid winner in the ratings. Cancellation came mainly because CBS officials were concerned about the criticism over televised violence and to a lesser degree because Robert Conrad had grown slightly weary of the role of James West. Ever since last fall&#x27;s ratings started rolling in, CBS has wished that it had kept &quot;Wild Wild West&quot;. None of the replacements have done nearly as well and, as a result, all of the Friday programs suffered.&quot;

That fall, CBS put the program into syndication, giving it new life on local stations across the country. This further antagonized the anti-violence lobby, since the program was now broadcast weekdays and often after school. One group, The Foundation to Improve Television (FIT), filed a suit on November 12, 1970, to prevent WTOP in Washington, D.C., from airing &quot;The Wild Wild West&quot; weekday afternoons at 4 pm. The suit was brought in Washington, D.C., specifically to gain government and media attention. The suit said the series &quot;contains fictionalized violence and horror harmful to the mental health and well-being of minor children&quot;, and should not air before 9 pm. WTOP&#x27;s vice president and general manager, John R. Corporan, was quoted as saying, &quot;Since programs directed specifically at children are broadcast in the late afternoon by three other TV stations, it is our purpose to counter-program with programming not directed specifically at children.&quot; U.S. District Court Judge John J. Sirica, who later presided over the trial of the Watergate burglars and ordered U.S. President Richard Nixon to turn over White House recordings, dismissed the lawsuit in January 1971, referring FIT to take their complaint to the FCC. FIT appealed, but a year and a half later the U.S. Court of Appeals upheld the district court decision dismissing the suit on the grounds that FIT had not exhausted the administrative remedies available to them. By then, WTOP had stopped broadcasting the series altogether. At that time, the show was in reruns on about 57 other local stations across the country, including WOR in New York and WFLD in Chicago.

In October 1973, the Los Angeles-based National Association for Better Broadcasting (NABB) reached a landmark agreement with KTTV, a local station, to purge 42 violent cartoon programs, including &quot;Mighty Mouse&quot;, &quot;Magilla Gorilla&quot;, &quot;Speed Racer&quot; and &quot;Gigantor&quot;. Additionally, the NABB cited 81 syndicated live-action shows that &quot;may have a detrimental influence on some children who are exposed to such programming without parental guidance or perspective&quot; when they are telecast before 8:30 p.m. This list included &quot;The Wild Wild West&quot;, &quot;The Avengers&quot;, &quot;Batman&quot;, &quot;The Man from U.N.C.L.E.&quot;, &quot;Roy Rogers&quot;, &quot;&quot; and &quot;The Lone Ranger&quot;. In Los Angeles, such shows opened with a cautionary announcement: &quot;Parents — we wish to advise that because of violence or other possible harmful elements, certain portions of the following program may not be suitable for young children.&quot; The NABB hoped to use the cartoon ban and warning announcement as a model for similar agreements with other local stations.

By then, &quot;The Wild Wild West&quot; was running on 99 local stations. Its ongoing popularity throughout the 1970s prompted two television movie sequels, &quot;The Wild Wild West Revisited&quot; (1979) and &quot;More Wild Wild West&quot; (1980) (see below). By the spring of 1985, the original series was still carried on 74 local stations.

In the late 1980s, the series was still seen on local stations in Boston, Hartford, Philadelphia, Pittsburgh and Los Angeles, among other cities. Significantly, WGN (Chicago), which carried the show at 10 a.m. on Sundays, became available nationally through cable television.

In 1994, &quot;The Wild Wild West&quot; began running on Saturdays at 10 a.m. on Turner Network Television (TNT), which preferred the color episodes to the black and white ones. The series was dropped from WGN soon after. Hallmark Channel aired the series in 2005 as part of its slate of Saturday afternoon Westerns but dropped it after only a few weeks.

While the series became scarce on television, each season was released on DVD, beginning with season 1 in 2006 and concluding with the final season early in 2008 (see below). In 2014, it was announced that the series was being prepped for Blu-ray.

In 2006, the series began running weekdays and/or weekends on MeTV, then Sundays on the Heroes &amp; Icons digital channel. As of 2024, &quot;The Wild Wild West&quot; was airing on MeTV on Saturday mornings. As of 2015, the series aired in the United Kingdom on the Horror Channel.

===Television films===
Conrad and Martin reunited for two satirical comedy television film sequels, &quot;The Wild Wild West Revisited&quot; (broadcast May 9, 1979) and &quot;More Wild Wild West&quot; (broadcast October 7, 1980). &quot;Revisited&quot; introduced Paul Williams as Miguelito Loveless Jr., the son of the agents&#x27; nemesis. Loveless planned to substitute clones for the crowned heads of Europe and the President of the United States. This plot is similar to the second-season episode &quot;The Night of the Brain&quot;, which featured a different villain.

Most of the exteriors were filmed at Old Tucson Studios in Arizona, where there are Western sets and a functioning steam train and tracks. Interiors were shot at CBS Studio Center. Ross Martin said, &quot;We worked on a lot of the same sets at the studio, including the interiors of the old train. We used the same guns and gimmicks and wardrobes with the waistlines let out a little bit. The script, unlike the old shows, is played strictly for comedy. It calls for us to be ten years older than when we were last seen. There are a lot more laughs than adventure.&quot;

&quot;More Wild Wild West&quot; was initially conceived as a rematch between the agents and Miguelito Jr., but Williams was on tour and unavailable for the film; his character was changed to Albert Paradine II and played by Jonathan Winters. This explains why the story begins with various clones of Paradine being murdered; the first film ends with word that Loveless had cloned himself five times. Paradine planned world conquest using a formula for invisibility, recalling the first-season episode &quot;The Night of the Burning Diamond&quot;.

Both TV films were campier than the TV series, although Conrad and Martin played their roles straight. Both films were directed by veteran comedy Western director Burt Kennedy and written by William Bowers (in the latter case with Tony Kayden, from a story by Bowers); neither Kennedy nor Bowers had worked on the original series. &quot;The Wild Wild West Revisited&quot; takes the agents to a town called Wagon Gap. This was a nod to the Abbott and Costello film, &quot;The Wistful Widow of Wagon Gap&quot; (1947), which was based on a treatment by Bowers and D. D. Beauchamp of a short story by Beauchamp.

Conrad once revealed that CBS intended to do yearly TV revivals of &quot;The Wild Wild West.&quot; &quot;Variety,&quot; in its review of the first TV movie, concurred: &quot;A couple of more movies in this vein, sensibly spaced, could work in the future.&quot; Ross Martin&#x27;s death in 1981, however, put an end to the idea. Conrad was later quoted in Cinefantastique about these films: &quot;We all got along fine with each other when we did these, but I wasn&#x27;t happy with them only because CBS imposed a lot of restrictions on us. They never came up to the level of what we had done before.&quot;

==Home media==
The first season of &quot;The Wild Wild West&quot; was released on DVD in North America on June 6, 2006, by CBS Home Entertainment (distributed by Paramount Home Entertainment). Although it was touted as a special 40th anniversary edition, it appeared 41 years after the show&#x27;s 1965 debut. Robert Conrad recorded audio introductions for all 28 first-season episodes, plus a commentary track for the pilot. The set also featured audio interviews by Susan Kesler (for her book, &quot;The Wild Wild West: The Series&quot;), and 1970s era footage of Conrad and Martin on a daytime talk show. The second season was released on DVD on March 20, 2007; the third season was released on November 20, 2007; and the fourth and final season was released on March 18, 2008. None of the later season sets contained bonus material.

A 27-disc complete series set was released on November 4, 2008. It contains all 104 episodes of the series, as well as both reunion telefilms.

On May 12, 2015, CBS Home Entertainment released a repackaged version of the complete series set, at a lower price, but did not include the bonus disc that was part of the original complete series set. On June 13, 2016, the bonus disc was released as a standalone item.

In France, where the series (known locally as &quot;Les Mystères de l&#x27;Ouest&quot;) was a big hit, all four seasons were released in a DVD boxed set before their U.S. release. The French set, released by TF1 Video, includes many of the extras on the U.S. season 1 set and many others. &quot;The Night of the Inferno&quot; is presented twiceas a regular episode in English with Conrad&#x27;s audio commentary, and in a French-dubbed version. All of the episodes are presented in English with French subtitles and several episode titles differ in translation from the original English titles. For example, &quot;The Night of the Gypsy Peril&quot;, &quot;The Night of the Simian Terror&quot; and &quot;The Night of Jack O&#x27;Diamonds&quot; respectively translate as &quot;The Night of the White Elephant&quot;, &quot;The Night of the Beast&quot; and &quot;The Night of the Thoroughbred&quot;. Both TV movies are included as extras, but only in French-dubbed versions. The set also features a 1999 interview with Robert Conrad at the Mirande Country Music Festival in France.

==Theatrical film adaptation==

Warner Bros. optioned the film rights to &quot;The Wild Wild West&quot; in 1992. Mel Gibson was cast as James West, with Richard Donner set to direct from a screenplay by Shane Black (Donner had directed three episodes of the original series). In 1997, as the film was still being developed with other directors, writers and stars, Gilbert Ralston, who wrote the TV pilot, sued Warner Bros. over the upcoming feature film based on the series he helped create. Ralston died in 1999 before his suit was settled; however, Warner Bros. paid his family between $600,000 and $1.5 million.

In 1999, a theatrical feature-length film co-produced and directed by Barry Sonnenfeld was released as &quot;Wild Wild West&quot; (without the definite article used in the series title). Loosely based on the original series, the film re-imagined James West as a Black man (played by Will Smith), and Artemus Gordon (played by Kevin Kline) was portrayed as egotistical and bitterly competitive with West. Significant changes were also made to Dr. Loveless (played by Kenneth Branagh). No longer a dwarf, he was portrayed as a legless double amputee confined to a steam-powered wheelchair (similar to that employed by the villain in the episode &quot;The Night of the Brain&quot;). Loveless, whose first name was changed from Miguelito to Arliss, was a bitter Southerner who sought revenge on the North after the American Civil War.

Robert Conrad was reportedly offered a cameo as President Grant, but turned it down when the producers wanted him to read for the part. He was outspoken in his criticism of the film, which was now a comedic showcase for Will Smith with little in common with the original series. He was not opposed to casting a Black actor as Jim West: &quot;The African-American casting of that role is probable and should not be an issue,&quot; Conrad said. &quot;I think the casting of (Will) Smith is the issue. I appreciate his popularity. However, I&#x27;d prefer an actor with more athletic prowess. He&#x27;s a good comedian but just not my choice to play my role. Best would be a Wesley Snipes body with a Denzel Washington head.&quot; Conrad was also offended by the racial overtones of the film. &quot;There is a reference in it to a racial slur,&quot; Conrad said. &quot;I hope it&#x27;s not in the final version. I said, &#x27;Why are we going in this direction. Why not just play James West black without explaining it?&#x27; He also criticized the casting of Branagh as a double amputee, rather than a little-person actor, in the role of Loveless. &quot;Michael Dunn did such a great job playing Dr. Loveless, and he was by far the best villain on the show,&quot; Conrad said. &quot;There are so many talented dwarfs but they wanted Kenneth Branagh.&quot; In a &quot;New York Post&quot; interview (July 3, 1999), Conrad stated that he disliked the film and that contractually he was owed a share of money on merchandising that he was not paid. He also had a long-standing feud with producer Jon Peters. &quot;He was dating my 17-year-old daughter,&quot; Conrad explained, &quot;saying he was divorced when he wasn&#x27;t.&quot;

Conrad later took special delight in accepting the Golden Raspberry Awards for the film in 1999. It was awarded Worst Picture, Worst Director, Worst Screenplay, Worst Original Song (for the song &quot;Wild Wild West&quot; by Smith) and Worst Screen Couple.

In 2009, Will Smith apologized publicly to Conrad while doing promotion for &quot;Seven Pounds&quot;:
==In other media==

The series spawned several merchandising spin-offs, including a seven-issue comic book series by Gold Key Comics, and a paperback novel, Richard Wormser&#x27;s &quot;The Wild Wild West&quot;, published in 1966 by Signet (), which adapted the episode &quot;The Night of the Double-Edged Knife&quot;.

===Books===
In 1988, Arnett Press published &quot;The Wild Wild West: The Series&quot; by Susan E. Kesler (), a thorough production history and episode guide.

In 1998, Berkeley Books published three novels by author Robert Vaughan &quot;The Wild Wild West&quot; (), &quot;The Night of the Death Train&quot; (), and &quot;The Night of the Assassin&quot; ().

In 2019, Epic Press published a new novel by Joseph Covino, Jr, paying tribute to the series with a novel faithful in both style and spirit, &quot;Night of the Nobility Cult: A Wild, Wild Western&quot;.

===Comics===
In 1990, Millennium Publications produced a four-issue comic book miniseries (&quot;The Night of the Iron Tyrants&quot;) scripted by Mark Ellis with art by Darryl Banks. A sequel to the TV series, it involved Dr. Loveless in a conspiracy to assassinate President Grant and the President of Brazil and put the Knights of the Golden Circle into power. The characters of Voltaire and Antoinette were prominent here, despite their respective early departures from Dr. Loveless&#x27; side in the original series. A review from the Mile High Comics site states: &quot;This mini-series perfectly captures the fun mixture of western and spy action that marked the ground-breaking 1960s TV series.&quot; The storyline of the comics miniseries was optioned for motion picture development.

In the 75th volume of the Belgian comic book series &quot;Lucky Luke&quot; (&quot;L&#x27;Homme de Washington&quot;), published in 2008, both James West and Artemus Gordon have a minor guest appearance, albeit the names have been changed to &quot;James East&quot; and &quot;Artémius Gin&quot;.

===Television===
When Robert Conrad hosted &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; on NBC (January 23, 1982), he appeared in a parody of &quot;The Wild Wild West&quot;. President Lincoln states his famous quip that, if General U.S. Grant is a drunk, he should send whatever he is drinking to his other, less successful generals. Lincoln dispatches West and Gordon (Joe Piscopo) to find out what Grant drinks. They discover that Grant is held captive by Velvet Jones (Eddie Murphy).

===Soundtrack album===
On July 11, 2017, La-La Land Records released a limited edition 4-disc set of music from the series, featuring Richard Markowitz&#x27;s theme, episode scores by Markowitz, Robert Drasnin, Dave Grusin, Richard Shores, Harry Geller, Walter Scharf, Jack Pleis and Fred Steiner and Dimitri Tiomkin&#x27;s unused theme music.

===Contemporary merchandise===
Like many television series, &quot;The Wild Wild West&quot; had several merchandise tie-ins during its run:
==Proposed revivals==
After the success of the first TV movie, CBS planned to revive the show as a series of yearly specials. The death of Ross Martin in 1981 ended that discussion. On October 5, 2010, &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; reported that Ronald D. Moore and Naren Shankar were developing a remake of &quot;The Wild Wild West&quot; for television, but the project apparently stalled. In December 2013, Moore told &quot;Wired&quot; that &quot;&quot;Wild Wild West&quot; and &quot;Star Trek&quot; were two of my great loves. I watched both in syndication in the &#x27;70s. &quot;Wild Wild West&quot; was really interesting, that combination of genres—a Western and secret agent, and they dabbled in the occult and paranormal. I really wanted to do a new version for CBS. I still think it&#x27;s a great property. Someday I hope to go back to it.&quot;

A pastiche webseries titled &quot;Back to the Wild Wild West&quot; began production in November 2011, but apparently has been stalled.

<text>Rodolphe Kreutzer (15 November 1766 – 6 January 1831) was a French violinist, teacher, conductor, and composer of forty French operas, including &quot;La mort d&#x27;Abel&quot; (1810).

He is probably best known as the dedicatee of Beethoven&#x27;s Violin Sonata No. 9, Op. 47 (1803), known as the &quot;Kreutzer Sonata&quot;, though he never played the work. Kreutzer made the acquaintance of Beethoven in 1798, when at Vienna in the service of the French ambassador, Jean-Baptiste Bernadotte (later King of Sweden and Norway). Beethoven originally dedicated the sonata to George Bridgetower, the violinist at its first performance, but after a quarrel he revised the dedication in favour of Kreutzer.

== Biography ==
Kreutzer was born in Versailles, and was initially taught by his German father, who was a musician in the royal chapel, with later lessons from Anton Stamitz. He became one of the foremost violin virtuosos of his day, appearing as a soloist until 1810. He embedded with the Army of Italy under the command of Napoleon Bonaparte in 1797, charged with copying Italian musical manuscripts and returning them to France as trophies. He was a violin professor at the Conservatoire de Paris from its foundation in 1795 until 1826. He was co-author of the Conservatoire&#x27;s violin method with Pierre Rode and Pierre Baillot, and the three are considered the founding trinity of the French school of violin playing. For a time, Kreutzer was leader of the Paris Opera, and from 1817 he conducted there, too. He died in Geneva and is buried in Paris at the Père Lachaise Cemetery.

== Work ==
Kreutzer was well known for his style of bowing, his splendid tone, and the clearness of his execution. His compositions include nineteen violin concertos and forty operas (including &quot;Jeanne d&#x27;Arc in Orléans&quot; 1790, &quot;Paul and Virginie&quot; 1791, &quot;Lodoïska&quot; 1791, &quot;Astianax&quot; 1801, &quot;Aristippe&quot; 1808 (dedicated to Hortense de Beauharnais), &quot;Abel&quot;, 1810). His best-known works, however, are the &quot;42 études ou caprices&quot; (42 &quot;études&quot; or &quot;capricci&quot;, 1796) which are fundamental pedagogic studies.

<text>Charles Cotesworth Pinckney (February 25, 1746 – August 16, 1825) was an American statesman, military officer and Founding Father who served as United States Minister to France from 1796 to 1797. A delegate to the Constitutional Convention where he signed the Constitution of the United States, Pinckney was twice nominated by the Federalist Party as its presidential candidate in 1804 and 1808, losing both elections.

Born into a planter class family from South Carolina, Pinckney practiced law for several years and was elected to the colonial legislature. A supporter of independence from Great Britain, Pinckney served in the American Revolutionary War, rising to the rank of brigadier general. After the war, he won election to the South Carolina legislature, where he and his brother Thomas represented the landed slavocracy of the South Carolina Lowcountry. An advocate of a stronger federal government, Pinckney served as a delegate to the 1787 Philadelphia Convention, which wrote a new federal constitution. Pinckney&#x27;s influence helped ensure that South Carolina would ratify the United States Constitution. A town and district named Pinckneyville in South Carolina were named after Charles in 1791.

Pinckney declined George Washington&#x27;s first offer to serve in his administration, but in 1796 Pinckney accepted the position of minister to France. In what became known as the XYZ Affair, the French demanded a bribe before they would agree to meet with the U.S. delegation. Pinckney returned to the United States, accepting an appointment as a general during the Quasi-War with France. Though he had resisted joining either major party for much of the 1790s, Pinckney began to identify with the Federalist Party following his return from France. The Federalists chose him as their vice presidential nominee in the 1800 presidential election, hoping that his presence on the ticket could win support for the party in the American South. Though Alexander Hamilton schemed to elect Pinckney president under the electoral rules then in place, both Pinckney and incumbent Federalist President John Adams were defeated by the Democratic-Republican candidates.

Seeing little hope of defeating popular incumbent president Thomas Jefferson, the Federalists chose Pinckney as their presidential nominee for the 1804 election. Neither Pinckney nor the party pursued an active campaign, and Jefferson won in a landslide. The Federalists nominated Pinckney again in 1808, in the hope that Pinckney&#x27;s military experience and Jefferson&#x27;s economic policies would give the party a chance of winning. Though the 1808 presidential election was closer than the 1804 election had been, Democratic-Republican nominee James Madison nonetheless prevailed.

==Early life and family==
Charles Cotesworth Pinckney was born in Charlestown in the Province of South Carolina on February 25, 1746, into the planter class. He was the son of Charles Pinckney, who would later serve as the chief justice of the Province of South Carolina, and Eliza Lucas, a celebrated planter and agriculturalist, who is credited with developing indigo cultivation in this area. His younger brother, Thomas Pinckney, later served as governor of South Carolina, as did his first cousin once removed, Charles Pinckney.

In 1753, Pinckney&#x27;s father moved the family to London, England, where he served as the colony&#x27;s agent. Both Charles and his brother Thomas were enrolled in the Westminster School, where they continued as students after the rest of the family returned to South Carolina in 1758. Pinckney enrolled in Christ Church, Oxford, in 1763 and began studying law at Middle Temple in 1764. After a short stint at a military academy in France, Pinckney completed his studies in 1769 and was called to the English bar. He briefly practiced law in England before establishing a legal practice in Charleston.

After returning to the American colonies in 1773, Pinckney married Sarah Middleton. Her father Henry Middleton later served as the second president of the Continental Congress, and her brother Arthur Middleton signed the Declaration of Independence. Sarah died in 1784. In 1786, Pinckney married again, to Mary Stead, who came from a wealthy family of planters in Georgia. Pinckney had three daughters.

Pinckney studied botany in France in 1769 for a year. For his assistance to the French botanist André Michaux, he was honored by having a plant species named for him: Pinckneya pubens.

==Early political career==
After returning to South Carolina from Europe, Pinckney began to practice law in Charleston. He was first elected to a seat in the colonial legislature in 1770. In 1773 he served as a regional attorney general. When war erupted between the thirteen American colonies and Great Britain in 1775, Pinckney stood with the American Patriots; in that year he was a member of the first South Carolina provincial congress, which helped South Carolina transition from being a British colony to being an independent state. During the American Revolutionary War, he served in the lower house of the state legislature and as a member of the South Carolina Senate, in addition to his military service.

==Revolutionary War==

Pinckney joined the colonial militia in 1772, and he helped organize South Carolina&#x27;s resistance to British rule. In 1775, after the American Revolutionary War had broken out, Pinckney volunteered for military service as a full-time regular officer in George Washington&#x27;s Continental Army. As a senior company commander with the rank of captain, Pinckney raised and led the elite Grenadiers of the 1st South Carolina Regiment. He participated in the successful defense of Charleston in the Battle of Sullivan&#x27;s Island in June 1776, when British forces under General Sir Henry Clinton staged an amphibious attack on the state capital. Later in 1776 Pinckney took command of the regiment, with the rank of colonel, a position he retained to the end of the war.

After this, the British Army shifted its focus to the northern and mid-Atlantic states. Pinckney led his regiment north to join General Washington&#x27;s troops near Philadelphia. Pinckney and his regiment participated in the Battle of Brandywine and the Battle of Germantown. Around this time he first met fellow officers Alexander Hamilton and James McHenry, who became future Federalist statesmen.

In 1778, Pinckney and his regiment, returning to the South, took part in a failed American expedition attempting to seize British East Florida. The expedition ended because of severe logistical difficulties and a British victory in the Battle of Alligator Creek Bridge. Later that year, the British Army shifted its focus to the southern theater, capturing Savannah, Georgia, in December 1778. In October 1779, the southern Army of Major General Benjamin Lincoln, with Pinckney leading one of its brigades, attempted to re-take the city in the Siege of Savannah. This attack was a disaster for the Americans, who suffered numerous casualties.

Pinckney participated in the 1780 defense of Charleston against British siege, but the city fell. Major General Lincoln surrendered his 5,000 men to the British on May 12, 1780, and Pinckney became a prisoner of war. As such, he demonstrated leadership, playing a major role in maintaining the troops&#x27; loyalty to the Patriot cause. During this time, he said, &quot;If I had a vein that did not beat with the love of my Country, I myself would open it. If I had a drop of blood that could flow dishonorable, I myself would let it out.&quot; He was kept in close confinement until his release in 1782. In November 1783, he was commissioned a brevet brigadier general shortly before the southern regiments were disbanded. He was promoted to major general during his subsequent service in the South Carolina militia.

==Constitutional Convention==
With the conclusion of the Revolutionary War, Pinckney returned to his legal practice, becoming one of the most acclaimed attorneys in South Carolina. He also returned to the lower house of the South Carolina legislature, and he and his brother Thomas became major political powers in the state. He became an advocate of the landed elite of the South Carolina Lowcountry, who dominated the state&#x27;s government during this period. Though close friends with fellow legislator Edward Rutledge, Pinckney opposed Rutledge&#x27;s attempts to end the importation of slaves, arguing that South Carolina&#x27;s economy required the continual infusion of new slaves. Pinckney also took the lead in negotiating the end to a border dispute with the state of Georgia, and he signed the Convention of Beaufort, which temporarily solved some of the disputes.

The Revolutionary War had convinced many in South Carolina, including Pinckney, that the defense of the state required the cooperation of the other colonies. As such, Pinckney advocated a stronger national government than that provided by the Articles of Confederation, and he represented South Carolina at the Constitutional Convention of 1787, where his younger cousin Charles Pinckney also served as a delegate. Pinckney advocated that African American slaves be counted as a basis of representation. According to a book review in &quot;The New York Times&quot; in January 2015:

The Northwest Ordinance of July 1787 held that slaves &#x27;may be lawfully reclaimed&#x27; from free states and territories, and soon after, a fugitive slave clause – Article IV, Section 2 – was woven into the Constitution at the insistence of the Southern delegates, leading South Carolina&#x27;s Charles C. Pinckney to boast, &#x27;We have obtained a right to recover our slaves in whatever part of America they may take refuge, which is a right we had not before.&#x27;

Pinckney advocated for a strong national government (albeit one with a system of checks and balances) to replace the weak one of the time. He opposed as impractical the election of representatives by popular vote. He also opposed paying senators, who, he thought, should be men of independent wealth. Pinckney played a key role in requiring treaties to be ratified by the Senate and in the compromise that resulted in continued American participation in the international slave trade for at least twenty years. He also opposed placing a limitation on the size of a federal standing army.

Pinckney played a prominent role in securing the ratification of the Federal Constitution in the South Carolina convention of 1788, and in framing the South Carolina Constitution in the convention of 1790. At the ratification convention, Pinckney distinguished three types of government and said republics were where &quot;the people at large, either collectively or by representation, form the legislature&quot;. After this, he announced his retirement from politics.

==XYZ Affair==

In 1789, President George Washington offered Pinckney his choice of the State Department or the War Department; Pinckney declined both. When Washington offered Pinckney the role of Secretary of State in 1795, Pinckney declined but accepted the post of minister to France in 1796. Relations with the French First Republic were then at a low ebb: the Jay Treaty between the U.S. and Great Britain had angered members of the ruling French Directory, and they had ordered the French Navy to step up seizures of American merchant vessels found to be trading with Britain, with whom France was at war. When Pinckney presented his credentials in November 1796, they were refused, with the Directory stating that no ambassador could be accepted until the outstanding crisis was resolved. Pinckney was outraged by the offense.

After Pinckney reported this to the recently inaugurated President John Adams in 1797, a commission composed of Pinckney, John Marshall, and Elbridge Gerry was established to treat with the French. Gerry and Marshall joined Pinckney at The Hague and traveled to Paris in October 1797. After a cursory preliminary meeting with the new French Foreign Minister Talleyrand, the commissioners were approached informally by a series of intermediaries who spelled out French demands. These included a large loan to France, which the commissioners had been instructed to refuse, and substantial bribes for Talleyrand and members of the Directory, which the commissioners found offensive. These exchanges became the basis for what became known as the &quot;XYZ Affair&quot; when documents concerning them were published in 1798.

Talleyrand, who was aware of political differences in the commission (Pinckney and Marshall were Federalists who favored Britain, and Gerry wavered politically between moderate Federalist ideas and the Jeffersonian Republicans, who favored France and were strongly hostile to Britain), exploited this division in the informal discussions. Pinckney and Marshall left France in April 1798; Gerry remained behind in an unofficial capacity, seeking to moderate French demands. The breakdown of negotiations led to what became known as the undeclared Quasi-War, pitting the two nation&#x27;s navies against each other.

With a potential war looming, Congress authorized the expansion of the Army, and President Adams asked Washington to take command as commander-in-chief of the Army. As a condition for accepting the position, Washington insisted that Pinckney be offered a position as a general. Washington believed that Pinckney&#x27;s military experience and political support in the South made him indispensable in defending against a possible invasion by the French. Many Federalists feared that Pinckney would chafe at serving under Hamilton, who had been appointed as Washington&#x27;s second-in-command, but Pinckney pleasantly surprised the Federalists by accepting his appointment as a general without complaint. Pinckney led the Army&#x27;s southern department from July 1798 to June 1800.

==Presidential candidate==

Pinckney and his political allies had resisted becoming closely allied with the Federalist or Democratic-Republican parties during the 1790s, but Pinckney began to identify as a Federalist following his return from France. With the support of Hamilton, Pinckney became the Federalist vice presidential nominee in the 1800 presidential election. Pinckney&#x27;s military and political service had won him national stature, and Federalists hoped that Pinckney could win some southern votes against Democratic-Republican nominee Thomas Jefferson. Hamilton had even greater hopes, as he wished to displace Adams as president and viewed Pinckney as more amenable to his policies. In-fighting between supporters of Adams and Hamilton plagued the Federalists, and the Democratic-Republicans won the election. Pinckney refused to become involved in Hamilton&#x27;s plans to make him president and promised not to accept the votes of any elector who was not also pledged to Adams.

Federalists saw little hope of defeating the popular Jefferson in the 1804 election; though the party remained strong in New England, Jefferson was widely expected to win the southern and mid-Atlantic states. With little hope of winning the presidency, the Federalists nominated Pinckney as their presidential candidate, but neither Pinckney nor the Federalists pursued an active presidential campaign against Jefferson. The Federalists hoped that Pinckney&#x27;s military reputation and his status as a southerner would show that the Federalist Party remained a national party, but they knew that Pinckney had little chance of winning even his own home state. Jefferson won the election in a rout, taking 162 electoral votes compared to Pinckney&#x27;s 14. Pinckney&#x27;s defeat in South Carolina made him the first major party presidential nominee to lose his own home state.

Jefferson&#x27;s second term proved more difficult than his first, as the British and French attacked American shipping as part of the Napoleonic Wars. With Jefferson&#x27;s popularity waning, Federalists entertained stronger hopes of winning back the presidency in 1808 than they had in 1804. With the support of Jefferson, James Madison was put forward as the Democratic-Republican nominee. Some Federalists favored supporting a renegade Democratic-Republican in James Monroe or George Clinton, but at the Federalist nominating convention, the party again turned to Pinckney. With a potential war against France or Britain looming, the Federalists hoped that Pinckney&#x27;s military experience would appeal to the nation. The Federalists won Delaware and most of New England, but Madison won the remaining states and won a commanding majority of the electoral college.

==Final years and death==
After the 1808 election, Pinckney focused on managing his plantations and developing his legal practice. From 1805 until his death in 1825, Pinckney was president-general of the Society of the Cincinnati. Pinckney was elected a member of the American Antiquarian Society in 1813. Pinckney was elected to the American Philosophical Society in 1789.

Pinckney died on August 16, 1825, and was buried in St. Michael&#x27;s Churchyard in Charleston, South Carolina. His tombstone reads, &quot;One of the founders of the American Republic. In war he was a companion in arms and friend of Washington. In peace he enjoyed his unchanging confidence.&quot;

==Views on slavery==
Pinckney was a life-long slave owner. He repeatedly espoused the belief that slavery was necessary to the economy of states like South Carolina and opposed emancipation. At the Constitutional Convention, he did agree to abolish the importation of slaves in 1808, but his rationale was based on how stopping this trade would increase the value of large existing slave holdings like his. In 1801, Pinckney owned about 250 slaves. When his daughter Eliza married, Pinckney gave her fifty slaves. On his death, he bequeathed his remaining slaves to his daughters and nephews.

In the South Carolina House of Representatives, on January 18, 1788, Pinckney offered several defenses for the lack of a bill of rights in the proposed U.S. Constitution. One was that bills of rights generally begin by declaring that all men are by nature born free. The reporter&#x27;s summary of his observation concludes, &quot;Now, we should make that declaration with a very bad grace, when a large part of our property consists in men who are actually born slaves.&quot;

<text>Charles Pinckney (August 13, 1699 – July 12, 1758) was a South Carolina politician and colonial agent. He was also the father of two candidates for Vice-President and President. 

==Early life==
Pinckney was born in Charleston South Carolina in 1699.

==Career==
Pinckney studied law in England, and had become a politically active leader in the colony. He was South Carolina&#x27;s first native-born attorney, and served as advocate general of the Court of Vice-Admiralty, justice of the peace for Berkeley County, and attorney general. He was elected as a member of the Commons House of Assembly and Speaker of that body intermittently from 1736–1740, and he was a member of the Royal Provincial Council.

Pinckney also served as attorney general of the Province of South Carolina in 1733, speaker of the assembly in 1736, 1738 and 1740, chief justice of the province in 1752–1753, and agent for South Carolina in England in 1753–1758.

==Personal life==
In 1744, Pinckney married, as his second wife, Eliza Lucas (1722–1793), the daughter of Lt. Colonel George Lucas, of Dalzell&#x27;s Regiment of Foot in the British Army. They were the parents of four children, three of whom lived to adulthood:

* Charles Cotesworth Pinckney (1746–1825), a signer of the U.S. Constitution and the Federalist candidate for President in 1804 and 1808 and Vice-President in 1800.
* George Lucas Pinckney (1747–1747), who died in infancy.
* Harriott Pinckney (1748–1830), who married Daniel Horry and lived at Hampton Plantation in McClellanville, South Carolina.
* Thomas Pinckney (1750–1828), who negotiated Pinckney&#x27;s Treaty with Spain in 1795 and was the Federalist candidate for Vice-President in 1796. 

He was the uncle of Colonel Charles Pinckney (1731–1784) and the great-uncle of Governor Charles Pinckney (1757–1824).

Pinckney died on July 12, 1758 in Mount Pleasant, South Carolina.

<text>Elizabeth &quot;Eliza&quot; Pinckney ( Lucas; December 28, 1722 May 27, 1793) was an American farmer. 

Pinckney transformed agriculture in colonial South Carolina, where she developed indigo as one of its most important cash crops. Its cultivation and processing as dye produced one-third the total value of the colony&#x27;s exports before the Revolutionary War. The manager of three plantations, Pinckney had a major influence on the colonial economy.

Together with her husband Charles Pinckney, Eliza raised a daughter and two sons, Charles Cotesworth Pinckney and Thomas Pinckney, who became prominent politicians in South Carolina and were nominated for president and vice president of the United States by the Federalist Party.

==Early life and education ==
Elizabeth (known as Eliza) Lucas was born on December 28, 1722, on the island of Antigua, in the colony of the British Leeward Islands in the Caribbean. Lucas grew up on Poorest, one of her family&#x27;s three sugarcane plantations on the island. She was the eldest child of Lieutenant Colonel George Lucas, of Dalzell&#x27;s Regiment of Foot in the British Army, and Ann (probably Meldrum) Lucas. She had two brothers, Thomas, and George, and a younger sister Mary (known to her family as Polly). 

Colonel and Mrs. Lucas sent all their children to London for schooling. It was customary for elite colonists to send boys to England for their education when they might be as young as 8 or 9. Girls would not be sent until their mid-teens when nearing marriageable age. During this period, many parents believed that girls&#x27; futures of being wives and mothers made education in more than &quot;the three Rs&quot; and social accomplishments less necessary. But Eliza&#x27;s ability was recognized. She treasured her education at boarding school, where studies included French and music, but she said her favorite subject was botany. She wrote to her father that she felt her &quot;education, which [she] esteems a more valuable fortune than any [he] could have given [her], … Will make me happy in my future life.&quot;

==Move to South Carolina==
In 1738, the year Eliza would turn 16, Colonel Lucas moved his family from Antigua to South Carolina, where he had inherited three plantations from his father. With tensions increasing between Spain and England, he believed his family would be safer in Carolina than on the tiny, exposed island in the West Indies. Eliza&#x27;s grandfather, John Lucas, had acquired three tracts of land: Garden Hill on the Combahee River (1,500 acres), another 3,000 acres on the Waccamaw River, and Wappoo Plantation (600 acres) on Wappoo Creek—a tidal creek that connected the Ashley and Stono Rivers. They chose to reside at Wappoo, which was 17 miles by land to Charleston (then known as Charles Town) and six miles by river. 
In 1739, Colonel Lucas had to return to his post in Antigua to deal with the political conflict between England and Spain. He was appointed lieutenant governor of the island. England&#x27;s involvement in the War of the Austrian Succession thwarted his attempts to move back to South Carolina with his family. Eliza&#x27;s letters to him show that she regarded her father with great respect and deep affection, and demonstrated that she acted as head of the family in terms of managing the plantations. Her mother died shortly after they moved.

==Career==
Eliza was 16 years old when she became responsible for managing Wappoo Plantation and its twenty slaves, plus supervising overseers at two other Lucas plantations, one inland producing tar and timber, and a rice plantation on the Waccamaw River. In addition, she supervised care for her extremely young sister, as their two brothers were still in school in London. As was customary, she recorded her decisions and experiments by copying letters in a letter book. This letter book is one of the most impressive collections of personal writings of an 18th-century American woman. It gives insight into her mind and into the society of the time.

From Antigua, Colonel Lucas sent Eliza various types of seeds for trial on the plantations. They and other planters were eager to find crops for the uplands that could supplement their cultivation of rice. First, she experimented with ginger, cotton, alfalfa and hemp. Starting in 1739, she began experimenting with cultivating and improving strains of the indigo plant, for which the expanding textile market created demand for its dye. When Colonel Lucas sent Eliza &quot;indigofera&quot; seeds in 1740, she expressed her &quot;greater hopes&quot; for them, as she intended to plant them earlier in the season.

After three years of persistence and many failed attempts, Eliza proved that indigo could be successfully grown and processed in South Carolina. While she had first worked with an indigo processing expert from Montserrat, she was most successful in processing dye with the expertise of an indigo-maker of African descent whom her father hired from the French West Indies.

Eliza used her 1744 crop to make seed and shared it with other planters, leading to an expansion in indigo production. She proved that colonial planters could make a profit in an extremely competitive market. Due to her successes, the volume of indigo dye exported increased dramatically from 5,000 pounds in 1745–46, to 130,000 pounds by 1748. Indigo became second only to rice as the South Carolina colony&#x27;s commodity cash crop, and contributed greatly to the wealth of its planters. Before the Revolutionary War, indigo accounted for more than one-third of the value of exports from the American colonies.

==Writings==
From the time that she began her life in South Carolina on Wappoo Plantation to the time that she died in Philadelphia in 1793, Eliza carefully copied all her conversations and letters into a &quot;letter-book.&quot; She organized her writings into multiple volumes, each depicting with great detail a different period during her life. The volumes recount most of her life, with the bulk of her writings referring to the time between 1739 and 1762.

The first few volumes range from the years 1739 to 1746. They begin with her description of her family&#x27;s move to the plantation in South Carolina when she was 16 years old. Throughout these years, she began to experiment with the indigo seeds along with others that her father had sent to her. Her letters describe several years of experiments that she did on the crop to make it successful. They also detail her marriage to longtime friend and neighbor Charles Pinckney in 1744.

The second set of volumes begins around 1753 and ends around 1757. By this time, Eliza and Charles had begun their new life together and had children. These sets reference the time she and her family moved to London for her husband&#x27;s job. They lived there for about five years while Charles worked as the commissioner of the South Carolina colony.

The third set of volumes covers 1758 through 1762. It corresponds with the family&#x27;s return to South Carolina and soon after, the death of her husband. She was in charge of overseeing her family&#x27;s plantations along with her late husband&#x27;s as well. She lived as a widow for more than thirty years until her death in 1793 while she was searching for a cure for breast cancer. Though she continued to keep copies of her letters after her husband died, very few of them remain today.

This letter-book is one of the most complete collections of writing from 18th century America and provides a valuable glimpse into the life of an elite colonial woman living during this time period. Her writings detail goings on at the plantations, her pastimes, social visits, and even her experiments with indigo over several years. Many scholars consider this letter-book extremely precious because it describes everyday life over an extended period of time rather than a singular event in history. Eliza passed her letter-book on to her daughter Harriott, who in turn passed it to her daughter. It was passed down from mother to daughter well into the 20th century, at which point the Lucas-Pinckney family donated it to the South Carolina Historical Society.

==Personal life==

Eliza knew independence at a very young age. Her determination to stay independent carried over into her personal life. George Lucas, Eliza&#x27;s father, presented two potential suitors—both wealthy, connected, South Carolina socialites—to Eliza in the years before she fell in love with and married Charles Pinckney. Eliza rejected both suitors. This was very strange and even unheard of in 18th-century colonial America.

Eliza and Charles Pinckney, a planter on a neighboring plantation, became attached after the death of his first wife. Eliza had been very close to the couple before his wife&#x27;s death. They were married on May 25, 1744. She was 21 years old and took her family responsibilities seriously, vowing:to make a good wife to my dear Husband in all its several branches; to make all my actions Correspond with that sincere love and Duty I bear him… I am resolved to be a good mother to my children, to pray for them, to set them good examples, to give them good advice, to be careful both of their souls and bodies, to watch over their tender minds.

Mr. Pinckney had studied law in England and had become a politically active leader in the colony. He was South Carolina&#x27;s first native-born attorney, and served as advocate general of the Court of Vice-Admiralty, justice of the peace for Berkeley County, and attorney general. He was elected as a member of the Commons House of Assembly and Speaker of that body intermittently from 1736 to 1740, and he was a member of the Royal Provincial Council. Eliza was unlike many women of her time, as she was &quot;educated, independent, and accomplished.&quot; When the Pinckneys lived in Charleston, Eliza was soon planting oaks and magnolias at their mansion overlooking the bay, and corresponding regularly with major British botanists.

Eliza soon gave birth to three sons and a daughter: Charles Cotesworth (1746–1825), George Lucas, Harriott Pinckney (1749–1830), and Thomas (1750–1828). George Lucas Pinckney, her father&#x27;s namesake, died soon after birth in June 1747. In 1753, the family moved to London for five years. Shortly after their return in 1758 to South Carolina, Charles Pinckney contracted malaria and died. Widowed, Eliza continued to manage their extensive plantations, in addition to the Lucas holdings. Most of her agricultural experiments took place before this time.

The surviving Pinckney sons became influential leaders. Charles was a signatory of the United States Constitution and was the Federalist vice-presidential candidate in 1800. In 1804 and 1808, he was the Federalist candidate for president. Thomas was appointed Minister to Spain, where he negotiated Pinckney&#x27;s Treaty in 1795, guaranteeing American navigation rights on the Mississippi River to New Orleans. He was the Federalist vice presidential candidate in 1796. Harriott married Daniel Horry and lived at Hampton Plantation, now a South Carolina State Historic Site.

==Death==
Eliza Lucas Pinckney died of cancer, in Philadelphia, in 1793. President George Washington served as a pallbearer at her funeral at St. Peter&#x27;s Church, in Philadelphia where she had traveled for treatment. 

==Honors and legacy==
*2008 - Inducted into the South Carolina Hall of Fame

<text>The Dunkard Brethren Church is a Conservative Anabaptist denomination of the Schwarzenau Brethren tradition, which organized in 1926 when they withdrew from the Church of the Brethren in the United States.

The Dunkard Brethren Church observes the ordinances of baptism, feetwashing, communion, the holy kiss, headcovering, and anointing of the sick.

In 2001, the Dunkard Brethren Church had approximately 1035 members in 26 congregations. As with other Conservative Anabaptist fellowships, the Dunkard Brethren Church holds revival services and Sunday School, in addition to being engaged in evangelism and missionary work.

==Name==
The name &quot;Dunkard&quot; or &quot;Dunker&quot; is derived from the Pennsylvania German word &quot;dunke&quot;, which comes from the German word &quot;tunken&quot;, meaning &quot;to dunk&quot; or &quot;to dip&quot;. This refers to their preference for the trine immersion method of baptism, in the forward position, observed by all of the various branches of Schwarzenau Brethren.

== History ==
The Dunkard Brethren are a branch of the Schwarzenau Brethren or Dunkards, an Anabaptist tradition that emerged during the Radical Pietist revival. This movement began in 1708, when Alexander Mack and seven other believers conducted baptism of new members by immersion in the Eder river in Germany.

The Church of the Brethren represented the largest body of churches that descended from this original pietist and Anabaptist movement. For the history until 1926 see Church of the Brethren: Early history and Church of the Brethren: The Great Schism.

Early in the 20th century, some members of Church of the Brethren in the United States, the largest of the branch of the Schwarzenau Brethren, began to believe that there was a drift away from the old apostolic standards, such as the wearing of plain dress and the headcovering. Benjamin Elias Kesler (1861–1952), an Elder of the Church of the Brethren in Missouri, addressed these concerns in a monthly paper. It was 20 pages and called &quot;The Bible Monitor,&quot; which he first published in October 1922. In 1923, Kesler was refused a seat at the Annual Conference. His conservative sympathizers held a separate meeting in each of the next three years.

During the Annual Conference in 1926, concerns nearly identical to those of Kesler and his sympathizers were addressed by other members, but not resolved in a way that satisfied Kesler and his followers. Subsequently the Kesler group withdrew from the Church of the Brethren and in 1926 formed the Dunkard Brethren Church.

=== Immigration to the U.S. ===
In 1719, led by Peter Becker, twenty families left Germany and immigrated to Germantown, Pennsylvania, where they settled in what was then a separate community outside Philadelphia. Alexander Mack led 200 other Brethren to the Netherlands in 1720; after living there for nine years, they found that religious conditions had deteriorated. They immigrated to Pennsylvania, joining the original Dunkard group.

==Belief and practice==

Dunkard Brethren practice believer&#x27;s baptism, that is, reserving baptism for a person old enough to commit to belief. A believer is immersed three times to represent the Trinity: once in the name of the Father, once in the name of the Son, and once in the name of the Holy Spirit. Most of the women of the Dunkard Brethren dress in a plain manner, which has been associated with other Conservative Anabaptists, such as the Conservative Mennonites (including the Beachy Mennonites), as well as Old Order Anabaptist groups, such as the Old Order Brethren and Old Order Mennonites. Women are also expected to wear a plain white headcovering, usually in the form of a kapp. Men keep their hair cut short.

The Dunkard Brethren practice the holy kiss and the love feast with feetwashing. Divorce is not allowed for members of the church. They are discouraged from buying life insurance. Dunkard Brethren do not swear oaths to the state or organizations, and do not file lawsuits without permission of the church. The use of alcohol and tobacco is forbidden, as is watching television, or participating in gaming or gambling. Participation in politics, or labor unions, and membership in secret fraternal societies such as the Freemasons are seen as contrary to the Gospel and a pure heart.

==Members and congregations==

In 1980 there were 1,035 members in 26 congregations. The Dunkard Brethren Church has 25 congregations in the United States, with approximately 900 members. The majority of the churches are located in Pennsylvania, Maryland, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, California, and Ohio. They support a mission among the Navajo Indians in New Mexico, and a mission in Africa.

==Publication==
The church&#x27;s publication, a paper that has been published monthly since October 1922, is called &quot;The Bible Monitor&quot;.
